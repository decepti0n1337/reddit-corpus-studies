Cool. Then go drop dreads on things. I hear they do lots of damage.
---

---
I don‚Äôt understand the issue you are having.
---
---
---
If you only knew how many there are to be sold, stuck in the market, because they produced so much that even they cant afford to buy more because they arelady have too much
---
I mean he spread out the cargo and didn‚Äôt have 4.5 bil in the first hull. Gotta give him props for that.
---
Should add these to recons
---
Before the Empire. We must be cautious.
---
they probably didn't want to mark jita 4-4 as *the station* for a long while, sandbox nature of the game and all that
---
Keep playing it for years and you'll hate it, apparently. /s
---
It's a great game that has stood the test of time
---
do they just hit warp to gate and alt tab or some shit? How the fuck does anyone lose a JF to this shit
---
ü§î are they alts?
---
Kill all ramjags
---
Yesn't. blops can still use covert cynos and I think even jump through a blops bridge (why tho)
---
Then one can use use .NET Standard. It will integrate with all other major frameworks (Mono, Xamarin, WPF, etc.) as well as .NET Core just fine. If your app turns into a slideshow it's certainly not C#'s fault.
---
You have a gap in your argument:
---
Your stockpile is a wormhole
---
lmao
---
It's amazing how many bad JF pilots there are still... Like an endless supply, every once in a while a competent one gets caught but 99/100 these kills are handed to these guys on a silver platter lol... Still credit to them for putting in the work to catch em
---
god no.
---
well is up to you but i tell you to stay and keep playing  you never know waht to find on eve
---
Happy to hear you like it!
---
You won't need extra cap, the engagement should be over by the time you need it.
---
Remember you can turn off modules; you don't need to be running your MWD all the time, for example.
---
You can fit Stasis Webifiers to slow them down, Target Painters to increase your applied damage, or extra scramblers to counter warp core stabilizers.
---
He is referring to the nonexistence of this concept named "Safety". It's Santa Claus.
---
Risk cannot be mitigated completely. Be it high sec to null, there is always risk.
---
To your question in the post I am replying to while something may not be impossible it could very well be improbable. Enough that an effort will not be made.
---
Well, he also has Abysal Ballistic Control x3 on RSs, that should totally outbalance the Nestor price spike
---
What is the difference between a POS and a Citadel?
---
God thats fucking cancee
---
The ram jag needed a buff

Mixed fuel...did something change that allows jf to use any fuel type?
---
Once you hit 6 month you start understanding the lingo and mechanics and few politics groups !!! Don‚Äôt give up keep playing
---
There always is a threshold of when increasing a DPS does not matter a lot anymore. You still alpa frigates with a Nestor, all you need is just to land a hit, which takes time, no matter whether you have RS with double DPS or not. You will win most of the time killing a Drifter, but that might give you how much - 3-5mins advantage?
---
But yeah, I get that using Rorq is probably a very smart idea, so thumbs up to OP.
---
The entire system or something specific like Jita 4-4? Jita is still full of local spam which is 99.9% scams and Jita 4-4 still has a lot of things cheaper than Tranquility Trading Tower in Perimeter.
---
And I thank you as well.  All three of you came together to make my desktop happen.  My wife and son's all commented on it as well!
---
Jump freighters* plural lol
---
Yeah but they aren't necessary at all, they add 20-40dps or something? 4 cheap dps bs will do more dps than the nestor multibox unfortunately. You can greatly cheap out on his setup. Advantage of nestors isn't isk/h, it's just that it's easier to bail at any point. You still need rolling ships in addtion to them
---

nice one ! :)
---
Also didn't drop corp fast enough.
---
Indeed.
---
At least old clone rules made people more apt to pay a ransom for their pod if they forgot to up their clone state. Still few and far between, but before that people would pay based on implants as well. As you said though, everyone is rich now, or at least rich enough.
---
I can move the Rattlesnake for a modest fee!
---
The writers named it that because of their military experience.  It's an Easter Egg.
---
So you were involved in RMT.
---
Information arrays to bring local back....?
---
Unironically yes. All it would take is a ctrl-space, d-click station as soon as the cyno went up. Or, you know, just hit align and then hit warp once you're aligned. Surely you can sit and watch your screen for at most, like a minute (if it's a reverse undock).
---
Targeting Systems Stabilizer
---
I agree, i don't find cloaked things fun either, which is why i don't fly them (except the occasional bomber in a frig gang w/ hyena support, but thats only for torps in an easy roaming package). 
---
You misunderstand, while i'm happy CCP did *something* to address cyno's, i don't really feel this is a step in the right direction and it'll be gamed within a few months (120-200k EHP falcons) and we'll be back where we were, but with an extra ship. 
---
There is a difference between "actively hunting to kill capitals" and "i'm roaming with my 5-8 corp mates and every fight involves a capital that insta-blaps you". Capital application is dumb, which might be one reason CCP is being so obtuse about forcing recons on you to sacrifice to get capitals on grid immediately. Capital application severely limits the ships you can bring on grid. Yes, you can counter them with logi/100mn/low sig ships fit specifically for them, but people don't roam in that stuff unless they either 100% expect to be dropped on, or are out hunting capitals. It tends to get really boring when you can't just fly ships you enjoy because every fight involves a capital that doesn't need any support to insta-blap you.
---
&gt; Hell there were people here getting tons of upvotes for saying "capitals shouldn't be able to apply damage to subcaps"  
---
Which again is not indicative that **all** small gang people think that way. The important part a lot you guys seem to forget, is that most people want capitals to apply to subs, *when they have subcaps supporting them properly*. I don't think i'd ever want it to be where capitals can't apply at all to any sub, but it should be a lot harder than just launching fighters and getting a killmail while you point/web them without sacrificing any mids.
---
I will leave a fleet as soon as I find out the fight is arranged.
---
look at that guys killboard 
---
does he seeem like the kind of person that knows about fuel difference
---
Maybe Small Trig Citadel? If so, Upwell Small Citadels can be expected. In any case, it looks very interesting.
---
its not bad its just .............. jita
---
Trig rorq please ignore
---
I hope with a station that cool I can walk in it
---
Combat is about imposing your will on the enemy. It‚Äôs about no rules, unfettered fight until you get a result. And one side wins for whatever reason, but that reason is organic.
---
As unlikely as it would be, it'd be cool if that was an attack battlecruiser. Dread is more likely though.
---
I doubt its a pos, in the picture, the "white" items/shapes appear to be ships docked on a trig structure. Think of it more like a triglavian shipyard, rather than a POS.
---
RMT for salvage, make it look real.
---
Bitch please. What are you five years old and saying "mirror". Bring real arguments or stfu.
---
Assuming they haven't spent the intervening years making them more scary as well.
---
He won't be out in a couple of centuries. I'm sure he won't mind if you borrowed it for a bit... :\^)
---
not sure what you mean by bad. it's the place with the lowest prices in the game. like any overcrowded marketplace it's full of people trying to take your money. never use trade windows and don't accept any contracts posted in local, most are scams. some of them are legit but until you learn how much things should cost and how to spot scams just stick to using the in game market function and you should be fine.
---
It's new
---
No its not. Objective facts like the game having less players are objective facts. Less people out in space is objective facts. The game being one step close to dying is objective facts. Dont try to pull deep thinking here.
---
Im not even gonna bother with this one since its plain bad and you are still talking in narrative terms "perfect intel". Dude, get real.
---
You have made no real arguments outside of just ranting. But you are correct in youre just being subjective. An objective person would see issues even if it goes against their own preference.
---
I keep seeing references to ‚Äúram jag‚Äù, so what‚Äôs this fit?
---
:(
---
Looks like the 5m ones are kspace to c6 holes...
---
It's a lot easier for sneaky boi logistics if nothing else. Jumping through null without citadels will still be very iffy but overall a lot safer.
---
What about when the cyno is 3 90k ehp recons?
---
Yeah...I just remembered the chart had 5m ones...which are all kspace to c6 sadly :(
---
?? there are almost no wars, because people have no need to fight each other(i mean big blocks), EVE need change that will push ppl to fight. I dont mean that fighting should be easier/harder/mechanic changes. I mean that there should be something that can be obtained from conquered space/alliance, because now theres no point in fighting, and we are seeing that now. Big blobs will stay were they are, and nothing will change.
---
How does one loose so many jump freighters? Those fuckers are expensive.
---
Only sort of.
---
The isk sink of the fees is the same between old npc and new citadel's.
---
Align before you warp ez pz
---
You are pretty cool
---
JF Pilot cynos into an NPC station.
---
Outisde of station is random newbie ship.
---
JF Pilot docks.

Super jumps in, puts out fighters
---
JF undocks. Aligns to gate.

Super alphas JF.
---
the video is old but this is the main idea of most of the kills. also in same system as above kill along with same person i believe
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAx1VLFoQlE&amp;feature=youtu.be
---
Very much this.
---
You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy...
---
Great prices, though.
---
Everybody gets the argument you're making.
---
Nobody disagrees.
---
What people disagree on is where that balance should be.
---
And how are the new cyno changes terrible for logistics?
---
Now you have hidden 30 second cynos for jp freighters. That's a logistics buff.
---
&gt;Correct me if i'm wrong (I'm sure you will :P ), but the story behind the blackout is CONCORD that decided to keep some precious fuel to the empire's systems only.
---
That's not really the case. What happened was an escalation of Drifter activity in nullsec caused CONCORD's communications division (whose name escapes me) to suffer losses in their regular shipments of Quantum-Entangled Helium-4 (QEHe-4), which is a necessary fuel for the fluid router communications network.
---
Because of this, and because fluid router outposts will no longer have regular shipments, CONCORD is forced to ration these outposts' usage of QEHe-4, prioritising necessary communications (ie. capsuleer brain scan data, emergency transmissions, etc.) and deprioritising unnecessary communications (ie. maintaining continuous updates of the individuals connected to each system's Local communications system to every capsuleer in said system). 
---
Fluid router outposts are still getting QEHe-4, just not nearly as much as they need for all the communications they normally handle.
---
&gt;I just don't understand why we can still get the stats of people passing thought them and what is happening to them in those systems.
---
Fluid router stations are limited in the total amount of data they can transmit, as each bit of data sent out disentangles a small amount of QEHe-4, and sending up-to-the-second updates on the capsuleers in local space to every person in said local space is heavy on data. Especially as capsuleer vessels might also query individual other capsuleers' information (ie. right-clicking and selecting "show info") which will require updating their local ship databases, consuming more QEHe-4. 
---
Thus, CONCORD has throttled that data. By contrast, hourly updates on data such as the number of ships lost in a system or the number of pilots undocked in a system takes a relatively low amount of data (and thus a low amount of QEHe-4) to manage.
---
maybe they confused the website with fw
---
You have just welped 1.5b worth of recons and now have none left to bring in back up.
---
Ah, "free" another one of those concepts that doesn't meet reality.
---
Everything has a price, even if your not the one paying it.
---
I digress, what are you referring to? Something with high risk mitigation like cloaks?
---
Organization can field 50 70b Titans and lose a shit ton of dreads no problem, but losing a few recons breaks the bank, got it.
---
Pretty sure you also just said that, since cynos are hard to kill off anyway, people don't shoot them.
---
So if they know they can't stop the cyno, why are the enemy going to be killing off your recons?
---
Only like ship damage. Battleships can only it battleships and so on.
---
Is the cost different to bridge than to jump yourself? But bridging back after bridging in with a full fuel hold might be a reason.
---
Bleh so far away. Hours drive that turns into 2 and a half with traffic ugh.
---
Alright thanks for the tips
---
[removed]
---
You can reduce the lock time down to 3 second with the rigs
---
Can we please get a blackout of Jita?
---
so let me get this straight, after 5+ years of inactivity you come to reddit of all places to ask what to do if your account got negged?
---
Arch Linux updated:
---
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pyfa/
---
Hi, I‚Äôm new here. Can you explain why aligning is important?
---
All I see is a fight. A fight between Leshak gangs in a wormhole. Both sides supported by logi. And what a fight this was.
---
&gt; Don't they like collecting Capsuleer biomass?
---
They'll take anything they can get their hands on. Before the newest NPE you would go take on a Drifter station where they were processing hundreds of thousands of corpses for whatever they were using them for.
---
Honestly the way i would use them is starting off with the T2 reps. When you establish how hard the incoming damage is pulse the ancil to augment your reps. Have the ancil OFF automatic reload so if you run out of paste you can keep running it to augment the T2. Try not to over rep.
---
&gt;Not live, but stay on-grid without dieing regardless of my piloting
---
so what you're saying is you want the risk to YOU removed, but it should still exist for the people who's space you decided to go hunting in.... lul
---
dreads, titans and heavy fighters shouldn't apply to sub caps for shit. That's what battleships and light fighters are for.
---
After I wrote that I realized that mechanic Y and Z could very well be Cynos and Local. While personally don't think those are contributing factors towards imbalance, as they have been around for ages. But I could see how they could be looked at.
---
Specifically I was referring to Rorqs yields and citadels (specifically manufacturing). I am a Rorq miner. I actually like mining. I like PVP too, Large scale Cap combat to be specific. But for Rorqs, yes I feel they yield too much and are scalable too much, creating and abundance to minerals. Add to that manufacturing installations that are not limited in slots, being able to maximum use those minerals, it creates a bonanza of proliferation. That proliferation fuels even more security in the "homelands", creating the umbrella, which self reinforces more mining, more gains, more proliferation. And in all honesty, makes perfect sense to me--it my homeland, why would I not use the biggest stick I have to keep my citizens (rorqs) safe. I actually don't have problem with the umbrella, but that is a conversation for another time. 
---
My preferred method would be to look to the interaction of Mining Yields, to Manufacturing, and Null security. Not quick fix Cyno and black out. The later reeks to me of "I don't know how to put the genie back in the bottle, so I will just do the quick fix, appeal to to vocal, to hurt the big guys". As a member of one of the big guys, that promptly makes me not want to give that gaming company my money. 
---
TDLR: I wold prefer a more comprehensive look at the interaction of systems, rather than band aids
---
It has an explosive restiance amp and is loaded with explosive rockets. That‚Äôs exactly the damage resists and type you want to use against angels. You could swap the explosive amp and nova rockets to a thermal amp and inferno rockets for Serpentis. Not sure if the jackdaw shares the same resist profile as T1 ships though, in which case it will only have a base 20% thermal resist instead of the base 50% explosive resist. So one thermal hardener might not be enough.
---
To be on the safe side of things, just avoid looking at Local Chat while you are there... hell, I've been playing for years and never even glance at it.
---
&gt;It's not just empire building that's the point of Nullsec.
---
That's quite literally the ENTIRE point of player owned nullsec. To build your own empire and control/defend it.
---
&gt;And with local, the risk in null is essentially zero.
---
And yet people still died every minute in nullsec while local was turned on
---
&gt;so let me get this straight, after 5+ years of inactivity you come to reddit of all places to ask what to do if your account got negged?
---
The eve forums sucked five+ years ago.
---
Looks like a Triglavian POS stick to me
---
Can we not go to ANTIFA capital of the US?
---
You have character slots, make a new character and then transfer the isk that way.
---
Someone get that poor soul a notebook with EVE installed and a decent internet conection. Talk about good rehab... I can only wonder how many mass murders were avoided by people managing to channel their inner demons and sociopathic behaviour into this game.
---
So it's like a warp beacon?
---
&gt;Vnis are 60m fitted and you can do that 45-60m/hr
---
Ok, I'll go ahead and call bullshit on your numbers, the avg. carrier pilot is making at best 45-50 mil an hour ratting if they do everything perfectly and align to the next site instead of a station for safety, there is no fucking way a VNI is out earning a carrier pilot.
---
And anchor a 2nd KS right on top of wh?
---
I am stupid, not seeing the explosive hardener. Jackdaw has 60% thermal resist, according to EVEMon ship browser.
---
Nicely done.
---
imagine ignoring the reason the umbrella works and how it came to be because it doesn't benefit your point. People got tired of being ganked by nano gangs so they came up with a counter.
---
Ah sounds like it has the caldari T2 profile then. One thermal hardener would bring it over 80% then.
---
well how the fuck else are you going to find a target? Without local to tell you if there is even someone in the system you have no way of knowing if there is even anyone to hunt when you enter a system now. In a large system I might have to warp and dscan 2-4 times to get all the signs checked just to find out I'm wasting my time because the system is empty.
---
Doing the tutorials was easier and safer as I could do them in any system outside of Jita and null, and they were easy enough I could do my alts over lunch via remote desktop on my phone.
---
&gt;You know what I want a lot more than easy kills? Actual fights.
---
You know what you aren't going to get when people can't find you without tripping over you with dscan? A fight.
---
Praise Bob from whom all blessings flow. Praise Bob all capsuleers below.
---
Wait are you saying it's good now, or that it was good 6-15 years ago?
---
Since when do supers alpha a JF?
---
Only nullbears bitch about the blackout
---
If you go to Jita just use the market window and don't communicate with any of the locals. Make a docking bookmark on station range and a warp out bookmark a couple hundred km off station, and do not ever forget to use them.
---
how?
---
"but it still can be referred to isk printing. " No it can't because mining does not create isk, its creates ore you can trade for isk, but selling ore on t he market does not in any way increase the total amount of isk in the game. Only rat bounties and mission running does that.
---
yes  because your reasons for why it is low is no longer true potentially
---
Wait, how do I update my clone? Is that just purchasing Omega?
---
&gt;Can we not go to ANTIFA capital of the US?
---
You don't like milkshakes?
---
All I had to do was exit the station, warp to the cloning center's beacon, and then kill 1-10 rats that died in two hits and couldn't hurt me back. What's safer than that?
---
You're getting a little philosophical here, but okay.
---
A lot of people are going to try this and find out how easy it is to get Really Elite Krabbing Technique.
---
The Neocom II app has a pretty decent fitting module inside it.
---
The poor soul's been put in Protective Custody, I see... lol
---
They have, the lore says each empire has at least one Iapetan titan in drydock at any given time for maintenance and upgrades.
---
yes, katana is pornmakers 2nd nyx, he uses them together sometimes too
---
Its an old game mechanic that got removed. You had to purchase a clone, if you didn't and you died you would lose skills.
---
Wtb trig fighters/drones
---
Gotcha thx
---
Not sure if serious, but no. In the good ol' days you had to update your clone regularly in case you got podded and lost a ton of skill points. It cost a frikken fortune the older/more skilled your character got - if you were a PvP'er.
---
You used to have to purchase an upgraded clone that has a certain amount of skill points or you would lose your skill points up to the amount of the base clone.
---
This is no longer part of the game.
---
&gt; In terms of firepower a few capsuleer-piloted Titans will outclass a Iapetan Titan though.
---
No, they won't. Promethean titans are more resource efficient because you can build many of them for a far lesser cost in resources than one Iapetan, allowing you to spread them out instead of putting all your eggs in one basket, but they're still far less powerful than an Iapetan titan.
---
They are hard to kill off now because they have 300k ehp and only need to get a carrier in.
---
Recons will just get blapped instantly as soon as they appear.
---
And with the risk of once they all die, there goes you are back up, you are screwed
---
It's quite clear you don't know how cap fights work.
---
If you click ‚Äúwarp to‚Äù you can‚Äôt re-dock quickly. So you‚Äôre stuck aligning while in the warp command for about a minute unless you manually stop the ship first. 
---
But if you align first, you can quickly dock if someone lands on you, or just immediately warp once you‚Äôre fully aligned.
---
And all three double wraps survived. I‚Äôd love to know what was inside.
---
not bigger enough, also i wonder if my instadock will get fucked by this
---
Ask them to at least reset your balance to zero, since you (probably) had no idea that the guy was giving you ISK payed with real money.
---
Two hours turns into two and a half, not bad.
---
Oke there are some implied assumptions, that are likely completely unclear without me explicitly writing them out.
---
So, first of all, I don't deal with specific changes there for a reason ( I'm trying to relay a spirit of wants more than if X is good ). 
---
Now I do find it funny you consider killing a couple of ratters a successful roam because personally, I consider that well unsuccessful my idea of success get a memorable fight out of the locals ( something that has been a massive rarity for years now ).
---
Also, realize you're dealing with one of the better people at solo small gang pvp when talking about suitonia and really all he can get is a couple of ratting ships like really that's not a healthy scenario. 
---
Now the thing that is implied but never stated is I don't think a new group will catch up by trying to be a better GSF honestly there is no motivation there any group catching up will have to have it's own unique niche that the exploit to catch up.
---
This is currently faced with 2 massive problems:
---
1. The empire building playstyle better than any alternative ( like you literally can't play the game in any other way and be a viable nullsec alliance )
---
2. Right now if you are not of a particular size limit the barriers to entry of getting to that size are too high. 
---
Now do the current change's solve this no, they help gankers somewhat so it gives small groups at the very least a niche beyond being worse empires, but it's likely not going to solve all the problems, like a lot of playstyles need saving right now if you want eve to ever have any diversity again ( because right now really if your not empire-building your hurting yourself and the only reason to not do it is a really strong dislike of that playstyle where why do I keep playing becomes a common question ). 
---
Making the cyno killable honestly opens up way more options of the attackers as even under fax reps like blopses are killable and grid control can be established meaning temporary cap advantage can be a thing, yes that means a risky escalation but not being a death sentence likely makes such a thing a lot more likely. 
---
Like for me the biggest one that needed to me removed is the panic cyno thing and really that means you need to remove triage cyno siege cyno bastion cyno etc etc.
---
I might be able to double the Rattle after you move it.
---
*I‚Äôm* autistic? Buddy, you didn‚Äôt even use english correctly in your first statement, let‚Äôs not get too hasty.
---
No, 1 hour drive that turns into 2 and a half.
---
It's more me trying to point out the scam without explicitly pointing it out, to hopefully make it a teachable moment for multiple people.
---
Nevermind
---
Haven't ignored it but he straw manned a argument I haven't made. I'm not arguing with him about that because it's not my argument so stop acting like it is.
---
Imagine taking in so much spod you think I'm ignoring it cause it doesn't benefit my point. I haven't made a argument about it so how the fuck do you know my point?
---
I‚Äôm trying to understand what the poster way up there was saying about not being able to defend miners and ratters. What specifically about the changes makes it impossible? My impression is that it makes it notably more difficult but I‚Äôm not sure I understand the argument so there‚Äôs a lot of assumption going on here. 
---
I assume that the cyno changes and blackout make defending ratters and miners more difficult to the point that the poster thinks it‚Äôs no longer viable to make a home in null. I acknowledge that it‚Äôs harder but I‚Äôm not sure what makes it impossible. So I assume that the added risk of losing stuff is what makes it untenable and I am stating that I don‚Äôt necessarily think that the added risk is a bad thing.
---
Oh you mean those sites made to kill rats to earn bounties? yea that's pve
---
Statement is bullshit - it's illegal at a federal Level but it's decriminalised in some states for small offences.
---
Just coming back to Eve after a few years and trying to relearn everything again. My question is, is there a cheat sheet somewhere that tells me what each ship type is used for? Like a general idea what a bs or a bc would be used for so I know what route I want to go in my skills?  Ty!
---
&gt;Imagine taking in so much spod you think I'm ignoring it cause it doesn't benefit my point.
---
imagine referring to meme's so much they start effecting your own ability to think. I know what was being posted about and he's completely right. There IS risk, but it is mitigated in some ways due to the organization of the 20k+ group that lives there. That's not a straw man argument, its directly related to the topic at hand you just don't like it.
---
Does your reading still fail you? It doesn't address anything I said in the post above his reply. Making it a strawman argument.
---
noun: strawman
---
    1.
---
    an intentionally misrepresented proposition that is set up because it is easier to defeat than an opponent's real argument.
---
Apparently not to ccp it's also about risk vs reward or would you be happy with them giving you hs level sites? 
---
The only difference meant between them isn't just empire building you dunce. The risk has been nearly eliminated if you have a combined iq of 2 so they are adding more.
---
imagine telling someone they were wrong and then not even knowing the upper mass limit on the wormhole they are using.
---

https://i.imgur.com/DdFBPbV.png basically this. some put nos in the highs etc but this is a general idea of it.
---
There havent been a dozen posts for any of our ihub wins. Many of them were never posted about. Winterco really hasnt started winning fights. Their big win of the last few weeks was the 46dp feed, but that was widely covered. They consistently lose most other fights though. Even today they lost a fight in autz and then another fight in early ustz. Yesterday the only large fight was a 45% to 55% where legacy acheived the strat goal in a situation where i have specifically told fcs to take even trade fights like that.
---
Popping ihubs in feyth is roughly equivalent to popping ihubs in scalding. Which if you tracked happens alot and is never talked about as well. 
---
They did RESET the BOZ ihub but im quite curious to see any evidence of us ever chirping about resseting ihubs.

This war has been great and if PL making a big effort so frat can go even for a while is what it takes so be it. Nonetheless we have a deep fc roster and they have Elo. 
---
LETS SEE WHAT THE FUTURE BRINGS?

Your argument: There needs to be more risk  
---
His argument: There IS risk but it is migrated by organization and numbers  
---
This is not a misrepresentation of anything, it is a direct response to your statement that there needs to be more risk than currently exists.

Sweet! Awesome!

But only if you are legit. I shall carefully read your profile to be sure!
---
&gt;Apparently not to ccp it's also about risk vs reward
---
Which Rise just recently addressed on a twitch stream when he admitted they took things WAY to far and are having to look at ways of increasing the payout to offset the increase in risk, meaning its not balanced risk and reward, they did it wrong and now they have to turn rewards up to compensate.
---
Yes, that capitals (or titan bridges) can connect to from multiple systems away.
---
Never in my statement did it say that the players reducing the risk was the issue. So it is sure players have reduced it but CCP have done more to reduce it and they agree which is why they are adding more risk.
---
In a post about the changes to the game it's shocking I'm talking about them and not player organization. So again please learn to read and interpret what's being said.
---
Ur studpid
---
Ever since they did the whole capital revamp some 4+ years ago.  A nyx/hel set up to do this can oneshot a fully expanded rhea.  Other non-expanded fits and JF hulls vary in hp and may not die instantly
---
Oooohh, that's gone now?  Is it replaced with anything else?  What's different?  I wanna get back into EVE.
---
haha you must not play many games then, Bob bless you proud warrior
---
oook oook
---
It was cooler when NSH took the constellation in a night
---
It's just not a thing any more.
---
Ok, so the QEHe-4 is the vital stuff that make the capsuleers immortals, great!  I wonder if I was against the capsuleers what what I would attack... That's not the point.  
---
So CONCORD prioritizes the communication and information taken by the gates. They have to scan our brain before we die. I hope they know who we are, cause the informations from the brain might need more than a hacking module to get the identity of someone. So, one way or another, they know who's in any given system. 
---
If they give, for example, the average pilots in Space in the last 30 minutes, it means that there's a timestamp on every scan made by the gates and people passing through it. Otherwise, they would not have the information.
---
For the sake of the argument, let's say they scan the whole system every 5 minutes and give this information to the capsuleers. Why, can't they just give the other pilots id? 
---
If they have to use QEHe-4 to send this information, they should use some chat window that we use as capsuleers. Not like we have any limitation to communicate with each other. Cause, no matter on what fuel we use to communicate through new Eden, CONCORD should use it too. Seems more efficient. And keep the QEHe-4 for the immortality stuff. (If my security status is low, will CONCORD prioritize those with high security status if they come too short on QWHe-4?)
---
I mean, either give the information that they have with an x minutes delay or don't give the information at all and come back with some RP explanation.
---
i under stand they are volunteers my point is new players are getting bad info i was just passing on what i saw as a older player on a new toon
---
It was removed with no substitute. As for other things that are different, jump clones are a thing, lets you set a clone in a station and jump to it with a cooldown. You can jump to a clone in the same station your in to switch out implants. There is a free to play method now, which lets you log in and do stuff, but your locked out of higher end skills. More recent thing is null sec has delayed local, so it acts like wormhole space, you only show up if you speak.
---
Yeah, I can see why Snuff would be afraid to go there.
---
Only if Kyle Maclachlan comes.
---
I mean, the Naglfar looks kinda like a POS stick if you squint hard enough.
---
At least it‚Äôs on the side of the river they don‚Äôt hang out.
---
Old School Runescape.
---
fighter bomber have done this for a long time just check kb for that system
---
why? You're just arsefucking the entire AUTZ with that one...
---
Basically, you can now die as many times as you want(?) without fear of losing skill points. 
---
Bad news is, most skills and levels are now locked behind a paywall, which means if you're on a free account (i.e. alpha clone), you'll need to subscribe to the game to unlock them (i.e. upgrade to omega clone).
---
And they won't even zero out your wallet? That's a little extreme.
---
Leave your Neo-Nazi white power flags at home and you'll be fine.
---
sounds like your best bet is to beg murcy on ccp and explain you wasent playing and had no idea
---
Skill injectors
---
Big blobs have moved quite recently. I have yet to see evidence that they will stop doing so. Other blobs moved in. They brawl. We brawl. What game are you even playing?
---
This is starting to smell like a cleverly disguised ‚Äúlocal gib back REEEE‚Äù thread
---
I wish I had friends
---
What ram jags are very fun and engaging lets buff
---
That's ultra cool dude
---
There's going to be exactly two ship classes that can drop caps after this next change, not sure how that's plenty.
---
Legit answer, via the EVE forums, if you can survive long enough for someone to bite.
---
&gt;Feels a bit like propaganda with having nearly 50% more losses 
---
where did the 50% came from? you just pulling it out of your ass ?
---
Skyliner proteus?
---
No you already know that us capsuleers want 'Male Exotic Dancers Inside' ;)
---
Also, rofl. If I knew it was in New Eden, I would have taken it myself. I'm currently docked a half-dozen jumps down the pipe at the entrance in Antem.
---
Replace with forced comms that you can't disable while in system, not even turning off your PC's sounds.
---
As someone who played for years and stopped playing ~2010 I can confirm this. (Also may have something to do w/ BOB war)
---
&gt;Bad news is, most skills and skill levels are now locked behind a paywall, which means if you're on a free account (i.e. alpha clone), you'll need to subscribe to the game to unlock and use them (i.e. upgrade to omega clone).
---
Uhh, before "Alpha" and "Omega" clones became a thing, the entire game was locked behind a paywall. Free to play is basically a trial account with no time limit.
---
I would think semantics would say he's wrong. If he was saying it's improbable that a group like goons would save a subcap he is correct. Too much effort for no dank kills. Selflessness is not a goon trait.
---
That said he would also be correct (for himself) in saying at some point the risk is not worth the reward. The reward not being all that special in the first place, I can see this being the point it's not worth it. Also thusly the GAME not being worth the trouble.
---
People recreated match making lobbies in a sandbox game that didn't come with it prebuilt, because they wanted to. What's so weird about that?
---
&gt;People recreated match making lobbies in a sandbox game that didn't come with it prebuilt, because they wanted to.
---
I think it's more that they felt it *necessary* to, as there was the organic system wasn't working to a satisfactory level.
---
If someone agrees to purchase something you own of value, they can create a contract.
---
Eg if you had twenty million units MEX and someone was willing to buy it for 55/unit they could make a contract where they give you 1100m and you give them 20m MEX. Obviously double/triple check the contract but no fees are involved.
---
&gt;and they have Elo.
---
So what's the over/under on him burning out by christmas?
---
There's a bot for that
---
This is why you as a titan pilot should always run your ab or mwd to cap it below jump cap when doing bridges
---
don't fly expensive stuff in ships that die easily cause there are always gankers
---
Frigates are cancer and the fact that someone has to even take the time to lock one is too much.
---
the big brain move is to dock after session change, then undock.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
This guy jumped in and hit warp.
---
the sooner you quit eve and stop posting the better, also fuck off.
---
Yea... I probably should have worded that better. ._.
---
I'd prefer to see roaming replaced with raiding.
---
don't need to dscan when they park them 100 KM off the gate and have them just watch the overview
---
BR is from OP's video desc.
---
The clone insurance was more expensive than most fully fitted cruisers
---
Good news is, the entire game isn't locked behind a paywall anymore
---
It's because all those groups are really just relics of their former selves and have all devolved into being the same thing , an N+1 mass of grey melted crayons with very little character to show.
---
Modano is Godlike.
---
I didn't actually present any reasons.
---
Many many factors can be in play, it could just be that the current upswing (of which there isn't really much of one) could just be rebounding from a undervaluation.
---
We can't know anything based off such short time frame.
---
&gt; get blapped instantly as soon as they appear.
---
Nothing can do this.
---
You live in a cartoon world.
---
&gt;  risk of once they all die, there goes you are back up
---
So nothing changes then? If all your cynos die, there is no backup.
---
Reddit has informed me that there's no one left in 0.0 to be salty so that's not a problem!
---
Never told anyone they were wrong.
---
I literally said "I think"
---
Yeah, Jita's shit. No more T2 spod crystals up on the market. Wtf is this. Never had an issue buying anything in Jita before. And Caracal hulls were like 17 mil! That's almost twice what they should be!
---
Realtalk, no Jita isn't a terrible place that you should avoid. Jita 4 moon 4 Caldari Navy Assembly Plant is actually the one station in the game that I'm reasonably confident over 90% of players have gone to. It's just a big market hub with everything available for sale (except for my damn spod crystals appearently). And that draws all types of players there. Some want to kill any ship carrying expensive cargo, some want to scam you, many just want to sell you stuff or buy your stuff (often at manipulated prices), and most are just trying to load up or fit up their ships and go home. 
---
It's the Walmart of eve, and you get alot of weirdos, druggies, nutjobs and scumbags there, but theres also alot of mostly normal people too just trying to buy their shit and go home.
---
That doesnt matter you should never lose a jf to a super either way.
---
I love milkshakes but the cement and caustic lye gives me gas.
---
&gt;Super jumps in, puts out fighters
---
&gt;JF undocks. Aligns to gate.
---
But seriously this is absolute potato level. There is no excuse for aligning to gate lol
---
you don't have to squint very hard though.
---
as a jfyi, the milkshake cement thing was bullshit.  The cement wouldn't set up any time this century in the milk shake mix, it would quite literally just be a slightly denser cup of cold grey soup.
---
now, 20 minute dry wall mix, THAT would have done some damage.
---
Anything else would be heresy.
---
The EVE Uni wiki will have a lot of what you are looking for
---
I love these. Even though I'm not huge on wormholes as a playstyle I love how you make these videos.
---
More accurate BR: https://br.inyour.space/?s=4835&amp;b=8752380&amp;e=270&amp;t=ueqv
---
Or something in a fleet doctrine that'll allow you to survive long enough for logi to get a lock.
---
The proliferation of prearranged fights is usually a symptom of deeper problems that are driving players towards unhealthy behaviors. Hardly anyone would bother with the hassle of prearranged fights if the game was already capable of consistently delivering fulfilling organic PVP experiences for most everyone involved.
---
If your wormhole citadel gets blown up and you lose a T3C, do you lose a skill?
---
Cheers

---
If nothing else this war has brought plenty of content and i think we can all agree on that.
---
Is it just me or did that Windows 10 update fuck everyone and everything and my ability to run Eve???
---
it's "you're" like 90% of the time lmao
---
And yeah it is hard to get Elo lossmails. He has ejected and abandoned his fleet before when he's gonna die.
---
In a world where the most popular fleet doctrine is muninns, alphaing a recon as soon as it uncloaks is quite believable.
---
Gosh you are really showing just how daft you are, if you can't understand what people are explaining to you, then you are lost.
---
Panfam has aurohunen structures iirc.
---
So single expendable ships cant go out and cyno. 
---
Can the force recons not be escorted? 
---
I think instant capital deployment being more difficult than yeeting out some cheap frigs and seeing what sticks is a good thing. Capital deployment should take thought and come with strategic opportunity cost imo. 
---
That's based in the generic idea of capital ships and how they are in RL. I havent flown capitals in EVE
---
Too soon
---
For people that don't know : 
---
This is a playermade character (there are a few hundred in the game I believe) that they got to create because they supported the game in EA with I believe it was a 30$ or so package.
---
The character could even be made to look like you and could get custom clothing sometimes.
---
So no, the devs did not put in a Eve Online reference in themselves.
---
How much isk should your cargo be worth before being ganked?
---
Thanks
---
IS YOUR VISION CLEAR?
---
Will still be there.  Calling it now.
---
FIRST
---
Ding-Ding-Ding. We have a winner.
---
You've pretty much captured a summary of my views in two sentences.
---
The rule of thumb is 3 mil per 1k ehp I think? Also if you plan to spend lots of time in jita/ move expensive stuff it helps to have bookmarks that are insta warp undocks and at zero on the station so you have a minimal chance of dying.
---
you can check by your self in PYFA. just paste you fit there and right click on the cloacking device --&gt; module stats
---
none of the things you cite as facts are facts at all. now your just being hyper emotional, dont you see that? you'd think you'd be over losing a few excavators by now..
---
i think my arguments are pretty clear, im not surprised that youre dodging and projecting though.
---
That was meant to say newbro PvE. Auto correct fucked me.
---
I mean, in the same way that you're involved in theft of intellectual property, because you've probably heard a song from a source that didn't have permission to play it...
---
Basically it was a mechanic that made pod-death more expensive for older players because you had to buy increasingly higher clone grades to protect from SP loss on death.
---
Mostly what would end up happening is that you would forget to buy an upgraded clone and lose a rank in your most expensive skill. I definitely trained Advanced weapon upgrades V more than once.
---
Complicating this was the fact that you used to be able to remotely change your Death Clone to any station you had a Corp office in. So people would change their death location and self-destruct to be fast traveled to the other side of new eden. If the station you death cloned to did not have a medical bay, you had to risk undocking in an Alpha clone until you could find one. Also travel interceptors weren't interdiction nullified, so you could easily get caught in a gatecamp and podded in that vulnerable state.
---
Glorious. Take us back to RNK days.
---

---
This mission is approved by Lord Maldoror and  executed by Mr. Kryzhius(Cross) , in return to Elo's disrespectful comments on Rooks and Kings for years.
---
dumping to buy orders bypasses taxes, and isn't broker fee cut from the acquired isk? ^idk
---
what kind of spicy are we talking about here
---
I've only been playing for 4ish years, was it ever good?  
---
About once a year, follow a link to it, and log in.  Inevitably, I browse a bit, then whatthefuckisthisshitgetmeouttahere
---
o7o7
---
&gt; as soon as it uncloaks
---
Yup, in the middle of a fight, when targets and being called and shots being fired, a recon will decloak and be instantly destroyed. Because the fc recognizing the recon, calling it primary, the fleet decycling guns, targeting the recon shooting it and killing it happen instantly.
---
Yup.
---
Definitely faster than "cyno up, jump" right?
---
How do yo ulive in a world where the complicated reactions happen faster than the simple actions?
---
So i assume you mean null anoms are not for newbros? I think they generally are they are VERY easy to access that even newbros have been spinning hubs/havens on alphas. 
---
It's not optimal but they can access it and its some of the best isk they can make, out side of like c3s or lower deds. They just aren't running rattles for near carrier ticks cause they don't have the sp.
---
Well I wouldn't say cause they don't have the sp even though thats the setup before carrier. It's just pretty entry level with the sp from a recruitment link you can get into havens and clear them, or within a few days of training.
---
Null doesn't have high tier pve really outside of 10/10s and those npc satiyos. You guys just put bigger ships in the same sites to clear faster for more isk.
---
Yep, I found myself broke as hell after drunkenly yoloing a bunch of expensive stuff. I said fuck it and bought plex.  Had to sell it a few dozen at a time until I could afford the broker fees to unload the bulk.
---
Imagine seeing the faces of high sec pubbies when the null bloc super cap fleets roll into Jita
---
You seriously underestimate competent fcs and the people helping them.
---
You continue to prove how little you know about what you are talking about.
---

All the alliances in the QFC are either dead or just essentially renter's, realistically they are doing you a favor.

When does CCP's latest attempt to inflate their login stats start?

video does not load for me. mirror on a responsive and working website would be nice. thanks
---
God damn beautiful.  New Eden will be on its toes so much more now.
---
Eve is turning into World of Tanks.  Buy your ships from CCP and fly around shooting each other.  Screw the other aspects of the game.
---
Worked just fine for me using FireFox. I'm in the states, if you think it might be a regional thing.
---
Most people like milkshakes, but most dont want to be pelted with them just because they disagree politically.

But, I say that thinking we can have contrary opinions  and have civil discussions in this day and age. I must be a relic of a long lost civilization.

Rogue Drone FiBo?
---
More like FiDo.
---
1. Selling them on the market.  
---
 Recommended market hubs are "Jita 4 - Moon 4 - Caldari Navy Assembly Plant" or "Perimeter - Tranquility Trading Tower". Former is NPC solid station and mass transactions but takes a lot of tax. Latter is player station which can be potentially destroyed but less taxed. Expensive stuff like rare skins are usually sold through latter. You may have to change order price frequently to keep it cheapest in sell orders. You can just toss them upon buy orders but it'd be really low priced.
---
2. Make a public contracts.  
---
 Contracts are more flexible than selling through market. You can create bundles or auctions. Less tax. But you may need to advertise them on the Jita local to make it successfully completed. You can neither change the price after create contract.
---
3. Selling them through   
---
 There are Marketplace threads on eve-online official forum. Visit "[Sales Ads](https://forums.eveonline.com/c/marketplace/sales-ads)" and create your own topic. List what you'd sell and Link Eve-prisal. No scams are allowed here so the safest solution to sell rare items. You might have to bump your topic to make it sold faster.
---
Are you gonna do an update for the upcoming sisi changes (trig implants) ?
---
Trig carrier by the clade thats working with the rogue drones maybe?
---
Yes, a 4kdps ABC would be totally fair and balanced :D
---
Info: So my Ventures kept getting killed by Triglavian scouts. Now I can mine without worrying about them killing me as quickly!
---
Imagine at time when people are avoiding "anti fascists"
---
Sorry to say this, but they will murder this one too
---
&gt;Max Modules Of This Group Allowed
---
hate that shit
---
no
---
But it will take longer which gives me more of a chance to intervene.
---
and NPC null?
---
I'd try to avoid anyone that sets up 3 roadblocks forcibly detours people and makes me almost 2 hours late for my appointment.
---
Now you can mine FOREVER.
---
&gt; you look to poke the enemy in any way to force a reaction, but ccp removed all ways of disrupting your enemy without a 5 day timer
---
Technically you disrupted everyone in 5 jump radius already, with your mere presence.
---
nice ancil without paste
---
Except the fact that literally all the changes CCP is proposing is making NS just like WH with less isk potential so......oh except we can't roll gates like you can roll holes to keep baddies our and we have massive fleet engagements, so I guess after all the changes our rewards should be higher than yours
---
The loot cloud :3
---
I beg to differ considering not 2 hours ago I was part of a bomber fleet that dropped an Apostle, and that wasn't even in NS that was in LS. Sure he had about 10 carriers show up on grid to repel us and we went on our way but he was dead. And that was with local, with cynos, etc etc. Same shit happens in null regularly, but people don't focus on that. Not every hunter gets insta blapped, you just have to actually be smart. The problem is idiots who can't get killmails complain loudly enough that CCP listened, there are plenty of pilots who have actual skill who get kills regularly, blackout/cyno or not.
---
What measures can I take as an Orca pilot to mitigate being bumped off grid when I fleet up and mine in hisec?
---
Yeah this game is incredible, wish I started ages ago :'(
---
You only lose SP if you are sitting in it iirc.  Been a while since I've flown t3s
---
The ship skill tree and descriptions will give you a decent idea.  There are also clues in the mastery tab, but I wouldn't waste time on mastery 5 in almost all cases.
---
Errr
---
I find your lack of rigs disturbing
---
nooooo no it really wont
---
I already did it yesterday - see release page on github or my another comment in this thread.
---
So why are the confident fcs not going the cyno drops only the defense against cynos?
---
And the FC isn't the entire fleet.
---
Most of the fleet is f1 monkeys.
---
How is this any different than jumping around Sabres, t3s, or other obvious cynos? 
---
How easy was it to ship scan or just lookup a character on zkill to see ‚Äúwow this guy is obviously a cyno‚Äù 
---
Moving a ship through null undetected is easier than ever now that it takes more effort than copy pasting local into a channel being parsed by a 3rd party alert system.
---
I heard karmafleet is recruiting
---
i was so hoping for a video of this , ty friend
---
Has anyone actually managed to lance a goku/stuka fleet?
---
No words on how wrong you are friend
---
EVE is about coming up with theories testing them and improving based on the results. OP has the right attitude.
---
i hope so
---
We've only seen a portion of the changes. It's possible that the things that you are talking about will also be addressed. 
---
I'd also like to counter your point about getting the hammer dropped on you when in enemy space. You're right in this should he expected, the issue lies in the ubiquity, relative ease and relative power of this super escalation via cynos as opposed to a more conventional response.
---
POS stands for player owned stations.  They refer to the old style stick installation that gets anchored in space with different deployed structures used to do work.  These structures were protected by a bubble that only permitted entry with a password.  A citadel is the newer system where each station is self contained and works similar to a npc station.  They both require fuel to function, with citadels/refineries being more versatile, if more expensive to setup and run.
---
I mean the biggest problem is the caps are already there and most of the players that engaged in non-carebear playstyles are no longer playing the game, it feels so much like too little too late.
---
20mil per 10k ehp, dunno what math would be needed to figure out how much per thousand ehp.
---
I feel like the only one trying to cause drama is you. ü§î
---
They aren't it's still nothing like wspace by a far mile I can tell you have never lived there. Null is infinitely more safe rolling holes does nothing to stop people.
---
The second your rolled into your dead if your dread krabbing. Imagine ratting in your super and your just instantly dead with nothing you can do.
---
Your space is still infinitely safer then wspace krabbing. There's not some chance that you will just die because you undocked and warped to a site. That will never happen to you in your rorqual or super.
---
Your issue lies with no tanking your subcap or flying one with no tank so you die instantly not really shocking.You can't expect to run no tank and survive anything.
---
You also have massive fleet engagements where you only buy your hull once because of srp (even supers get srped now lul)instead you know like wspacers paying out of pocket.
---
I look at it exclusively to shit talk. End up having some pretty interesting conversations.
---
There's a rule of thumb on this? I've never had any problems in Jita at all.
---
Oh noice, I didn't see it, thanks bb
---
Oh dear... You're going to die.
---
Not my problem. I only go to Jita in a war-ineligible alt.
---
salty krab lulz
---
It's funny because for the last 4 years CCP has basically been at the back and call of the people that wanted safer null, now that they did 2 patches that don't fit that playstyle your screaming that CCP is nerfing the playstyle that has been dominating the game for the last 4 years like really?
---
grrrr gons hat gons
---
The problem is that they're not talking about \[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker\].
---
I see where you're coming from and I agree it's not a good attitude to invalidate how people feel, especially from a position of authority. I think where the conversation went astray was when you asked him his position. This created a power struggle. I don't think he responded to the power struggle well, but it wasn't really necessary in the first place. 
---
You probably would have been better off just letting him respond to your point about invalidating people, and carry on the conversation from there. If you wanted to make a point about handling people from a place of authority, maybe just make the point instead of leading him through a series of questions you already know the answer to, which comes across as condescending.
---
And tries to stab peaceful people on a bike doing no harm.
---
You do realize that the intention was to cause chemical burns due to the caustic lye thats in concrete, not to turn it into a hardened projectile?
---
Put some thought into it.
---
Hate speech is free speech, and so is the right to assemble and espouse horrible beliefs that everyone should be condemning.
---
Attacking someone for their political opinion, even if it is Nazi trash, is the definition of terrorism.
---
Hey TEST whats up, you're losing quite some ships to FRT recently
---
We only offer this sort of shit to get you hooked so you will be around to fight us. But yeah it is a good place for noobs, I agree.
---
Are you in a wormhole? If so, you might find some use for ECM.
---
People are leaving to wow over cyno changes? That's just silly.

Yeah I'm the same. Way too many war targets around.. I have my ganking alt that lives in high sec
---
Which level abyss is this?

is there an AAR ?

That is very good to hear.

we need more videos from AOM. im really curious to see how they're going

Ok thats not going to happen you can easily handle concrete with your bare hands bud.
---
Like you dont really believe contact with concrete will burn you right?
---
So like, bring some subcap support to kill the dictors?

I'm about to hit Month Three, myself. Still trying to figure out what I want to specialize in, which is tough because money is tight enough that I can't guarantee being able to stay Omega all the time. There's so much that can be done that I almost don't want to specialize in a given path. Right now I'm seeing how long I can stay alive in wormholes huffing gas in a Miasmos, just for shits and giggles.
---
So you have a problem with criminals that illegally block roadways.
---
Go to jita and sell them?
---
Year 13 here and I still enjoy it.  Hard part for me is that people won't get the fuck out of my single-player game and keep trying to gank me while I krab.
---
I still have nightmares from clarion call 3 of a blaster proteus shooting anitmatter at a target 15 km away doing 0 dps for 5 minutes.
---
Trust me Grath won't even bother to take the time to search "instant drying cement burns", you are 100% wasting your time trying to have any form of discussion with him.

And another one

That's 600 billion and that's just 2 regions,

Make that 700 billion:

And we just hit the Trillion:

I check like 7 regions out of them all, so like no your figures are wrong could you provide a source for your numbers?
---
At least one murder if you count me. :)

To be honest I'm surprised that nobody has done it sooner.
---
Really?
---
It never hurts to ask, but don't get upset when CCP says "No". The isk OP was gifted came from RMT.
---
Hey man their the one who messed with our boats (pearl harbor reference)
---
You have that backwards. Dumping to buy orders bypasses broker's fees and the sales tax cut is taken after you have the isk.
---
Want 300 spod crystals for 1.2mil a pop? I'll hook u up
---
It was a joke. Even though it may not look like that if someone browses my profile. :D
---
But yeah, who really knows what would have happened if we did not have games to dump our violent urges into.
---
CCP also have no idea.....
---
Would you say the same thing when trying to scare off an explorer off your loot?
---
I agree though, consider that when you're hunted, you have time. So don't take the first opportunity. Escape, get cloaked check zkill, realize it makes no sense to risk 700m now.
---
It's not just mining ships that need resources....
---
y tho
---
Space engineers
---
Like hel^(pun intended) why you want to use ECM when you need to use scram?
---
The first time I escaped a wormhole with a lot of loot (for me it was 100m), I saw a relic site in lowsec.. I went there for some reason. I see an atron on dscan. I had been hunted in wormhole and for a newbie without cloak I did pretty well. I see the atron slowly approaching, we were too in system so I already checked his profil (not zkill), I see 10 security rating so for some reason. I felt like he was going to be a friend. Then he destroyed my astero.
---
Yeah that was... inexplicably dumb haha. I didn't know what security meant at all but still.. uggh!
---
What's it like to be as sad as you?
---
&gt; Job losses are a by product of a recession not the cause or contributing factor.....
---
&gt; In a RL economic slump people lose their jobs and struggle to survive.
---
Maybe I'm crazy, but I don't see where that says job lose caused the slump.
---
you need to load that ancil repper with paste, and where are your drone mining augmentor rigs?
---
This is news to who?
---
Thanks for the for the formulas!
---
As for statistical damage lines - it's doable but definitely not on the graphs I already added. I'd rather add separate  graph of probability density or (reverse?) cumulative distribution. There is no room for more than 2 parameters, even with 3 attackers and 2 targets graph may become hard to read as-is.

There's an easy way to find out why people enjoy it.

While I did not profile specifically for this issue, I have another perception. Reads are alright, ORM's flushes are alright, ORM's commits are slow. I think that most likely it's due to SQLite rather than ORM, but - if my guess is correct - quite possibly something can be done, at a price of some safety: https://blog.devart.com/increasing-sqlite-performance.html
---
Is it 2009 already?
---
Lmao it's like you never saw the crying for previous changes. This isn't any  worse than that.
---
Also a lot of people have valid reasons to dislike these changes. What was it HIC changes that got an exponential amount of salt before? If they nerf cloaked bullshit next, this place will be literally seething too.
---
Eve is a game like any other. People want to have fun. If something negatively impacts your playstyle, it can impact your enjoyment too. That goes for anyone.
---
Should have just done buffer, not activie.
---
And shield tanked so you wouldn't be slower
---
how long does the ADC last? 28k EHP is crazy
---
Plexing like there's no tomorrow probably. I don't think any SRP would throw that many at him
---
Dat cap...  hope you can hold enough to warp off.
---
You re better mining on a Praxys...
---
But still... Maybe a Megatron, i saw a friend doing so, i bumped his ass 100km off the belt
---
The explanation is there, and it's passable. I just don't think you understand it, or you just don't like it and want something that suits your personal goals better. Not gonna happen.
---
Not him, but the active players, total kills in null etc are literally objective data. 
---
They are pure facts.
---
Once I've logged in I've asked in game and one of the suggestions was posting here and opening a ticket, so I thought it wouldn't hurt as I've guessed I'd get opinion and experiences with people who had similar experiences.
---
You contact them when you are stranded, and they'll give you directions to the cans, or escort you out if they have a chain to the hole.
---
So for tackle? No DPS?
---
Where's the mining battleship!
---
Me confirms .
---
Yeah in this particular case, the job of the ramjag is to get on target, tackle it down and suck its cap away ASAP in anticipation of a gang following to finish the kill.
---
Well, I kind of like Elo and BL (or whatever they fly as today), even if apparently we aren't [reddit friends](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/a7z0h1/the_story_of_bitter_moon_the_foundation_and_rooks/ec6sqna/). 
---
A quick glance at my archives suggests that this affection was once even rather mutual. In fact, I'll throw in a random file, why not:
---
In this example, Elo &amp; co./Black Legion had been circling a Goku fleet (Nulli Secunda). Black Legion - to their credit - often took outnumbered battles and were usually the underdog, so our moral priority was naturally to hunt the larger fleet, which in this case was Goku. (For the record I should add that in their time in Eve, Nulli weren't shy of taking on the odds either). I often felt bad when going after bomber hulls but you play the cards you're dealt. 
---
Elo (I believe) had a spy account on the Nulli comms and listened to them being pipebombed. Meanwhile, I had a spy on both comms. And so you can listen to the Black Legion comms as they arrived upon the graveyard of the Nulli fleet (a 'wreckball'), while Elo describes the sound of Nulli dying on Nulli comms. Go meta. 
---
http://www.rooksandkings.com/comms/BL_and_a_field_of_wrecks.mp3
---
Point is, they always seemed pleased with our work. And, in turn: coke, fast-talking, Munins and memes, it's all good. 
---
Anyway, a nice pipebomb by Fulcrum &amp; crew.
---
they usually contain a probe launcher + probes so you can scan yourself out. as said before contact them and they will guide you to it if you are lost
---

Why now and no neut?
---
It should have decent cap considering it has basically nothing using it's own cap
---
15 sec
---
&gt;when I used to roam null with my 5-10 man gang back in the day, and then the owners of that space showed up to fight in 40-50 subcaps (which was awesome, I can fight that),
---
You're either fighting absolutely incompetent players or you're chatting garbage. A 5-10 man roaming gang will get destroyed by any competent 40-50 man defence fleet so easily it may as well be a super. 
---
&gt;That's a great mechanic. I guess my only choice is now to go to Bomber's Bar if I ever want to fight anything in null.
---
Adapt then. Bait a super, tackle it, cyno in dreads/ your own super and there you go. Nano shit shouldn't be able to beat everything easily. At some point you should have to risk your own big guns for the reward of taking down theirs.
---
All missions aside from FW missions are within 6 jumps.
---
Well that's one way to adress supercap proliferation.
---

Cloaks are the most risk averse playstyle tbh.

May even have their own stations that just look like freeports.

It'd outmine this one exponentially, and have easily 10x the tank.

hey, i went by the numbers on screen. your stressing because theres 'hidden' issues with taskmanager. well i dont get them. my i5 doesnt go over 40degrees with a small overclock with just generic cooling.
---
ive laid out to you why i thought what i thought, and found what i found. no one is making you reply, child.
---
on a seperate note, are you saying your cpu temp is 5degrees under your atmospheric temp? i mean, that sounds just as hilarious as your other answers, are you telling me your using NO2 or LN2? holy shit bro if thats so xD
---

---
There was time when losing Titan was a big deal. It looks like this time returned and again: losing Titan is a big deal! ü•≥
---
But I'm quitting Eve and I need to give away all my isk.
---
It's like any other big city, so it's a complete shitshow.
---
Also those ISK doublers are all 100% legit. Just sent them loads of ISK.
---
it's far too big for a dread (look at current dread to battleship sizes)
---
And it kinda looks like a structure. Maybe some additional invasion stuff, or and offensive structure for players, idk
---
That‚Äôs not really quite enough grammar for me to understand what you want to say.
---
Someone instructed me to not do that.
---
Youd think people would learn how not to get caught like this
---
The central structure isn't a dread, but the vessels next to the Leshaks likely are.
---
You carry so much ISK in cargo, don't even try to fight... your goal here is to reach the market as SAFE as possible
---
I'm referring more to the vessels next to the Leshaks.
---
Wow that's pretty awesome for just running across something.
---
Would you be interested in selling the Manticore skin?  It's my favourite ship and I collect skins for it.
---
if the JF docks, you can still get them, infact it helps tbh if they dock. gives more time.
---
WoW classic, you will be back in 2 months max. WoW classic is shit, you simply have the pink glasses on. The thing that made classic great, was the new stuff, the progression of these new mechanics. But nowadays, these "new" mechanics are everywhere, and boring, because everyone min-maxed them already.

i mean, why?  how do we truely know if this guy and im sure 100s of others that try this story arnt actually alts of the toon that gave the bought isk out in the first place.

not worth the risk, keep the isk out the game. let this guy deal with it, hes not lost anything, he just didnt win that money anymore. hell get there

It had 3 types of guns , savager and 2 tank types and expadner fitted.

Don't judge creativity of newbie :D

yes, i LOVE eve because i loved testing fits, messing around, asking for a fit to be shared just so i can make sure it looks nothing like the fit shared, its ALOt of fun when your new.
---
few things r/lemonny3663 
---
when fighting NPC's generally you do not want an ancillary armour repper fit (it uses nanite paste to rep alot more, but this costs money, just use a normal t1 or t2 version.
---
also. generally people do not use cap injectors to do PVE. a capacitor battery or two? cap rechargers. theyll do the job for you to survive &lt;3 :D
---
have fun testing those fits! its absolutly ok to die
---
Ah I see, they lead you to it. Thanks!
---
It has nos so when the target neuts you, you can keep your tackle running.
---
Jita? jita is GREAT! sell almost anything, reasonable prices. no darn citadels there. 
---
the people, the locals in jita are all thiefs, murderers and scammers. do look out your window, do not talk to anyone in jita while you pass through. just get your stuff and leave :D

---
that warp out was fucking beautiful
---
Yea, no sorry work with it all the time and it doesn't burn.  You CAN get concrete rot in your hands if you don't clean up after but the idea that you made a milk shake concrete mess and it will cause burns is laughable.
---
Been quite literally covered in it before, definitely got plenty of spatter in my eyes over the years and probably ate some standing in a foundation hole when the pour starts and the spatter goes all over.
---
Heres a video of an old man vandalizing a concrete truck and then vandalizing the still wet pour, in shorts and no gloves.  He's covered by the end, not burning.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=123&amp;v=UTbxvOsNK14
---
Idk where this magical shit came up where you could throw some wet concrete on somebody and burn them but its flatly just not true, having worked with the substance for about 30 years now I've never been burned or known anybody, including career concrete guys, who have been burned.
---
Also thanks OSHA, who knew dust of any type was an eye irritant, fucking useless.  Nobody is more hated in the construction field than the OSHA man.
---
id not personally had copy paste issues ever before. with 3rd party tools i use its always worked fine?
---
can anyone explain why this has been added, what issues where people having?
---
Or, both in the 1 ship
---
Yea no been working with concrete for 30 years, worked with career form guys who've done concrete longer than either of us have been alive and it doesn't burn you.  Thanks OSHA for telling us dust is an eye irritant, didn't know.
---
I have probably gotten it in my mouth, for sure my eyes, and been covered from the elbows down, or below the knees working in shorts, for long enough for it to dry up and just get rubbed off as dust over the course of a day.  
---
Heres a video of an old man vandalizing a truck, he then vandalizes the fresh pour in shorts with no gloves on, he's covered in it.
---
Concrete does heat up as it cures, most definitely, but theres nothing thats going to burn you through basic contact like you or he are suggesting.
---
Git gud? 
---
Why should you have the Dotlan info? Shouldn't that be removed too with this whole Blackout phenomenon?
---
Munnin meta is just Ferox meta on Strong Crash!
---
40 strats or a ton of bombers have counterplay, unlike caps and fax which require n+1 caps to beat.
---
That sounds very romanticized. It sounds great but I haven't played long enough to know if it really was like that, though I wonder what would make people fight more then than now considering now people only fight when they are sure to win.
---
As for denying all content. That's not really true. They're just denying you (as the attacker) content. I'd say the majority of large nullsec block members are dying for a fight.
---
If you're in a 10 man fleet your target is off though, you can't attack the imperium with just 10 ships considering we get 50-100 people on even the most boring fleets. Maybe you should try the guys in tribute and vale of the silent. If the talking in station podcast where they had guests from those guys are to believed that's what you'll get over there.
---
If you're attacking a large empire you are bound to get boring fights but from what I've heard your best bet is attacking wormholers or tribute/vale of the silent.
---
So... Is he in the game or not? Is this real or not? That's what I want to know honestly.
---
Yeah, because they want to keep all the ISK to themselves.
---
I was on the receiving end of this pipebomb and it was very well executed.  The English speaking comms were a lot more calm than the Chinese as we all just sat and accepted the inevetable.  
---
Was fun...would rather not do again...
---
If you, somehow, got a loan in the past and the funds were *dirty* meaning someone down the line broke TOS. You just happened to be the person laundering the money,   whether you knew about it or not. A lot of shady characters were banned and all of their Isk taken out,  resulting in negative walrus across the New Eden. Next time you find that deal that is - to good to be true - think twice about the possible origin of cheap ingame ISK. and assets.
---
What is reasonable? I cash out only with 5-run-bpcs-items, usually around 300k to 400k LP per bulk, the faction items coming from them are sold in Jita within 48 hrs max. without even 0.01 warrioring ...
---
it could be. I admit exploring in T1 with only basic modules will still take time and be risky but that's what I'd try unless I had an alt that I could do it on.
---
Yes, this is in the game and he can be delivered to any prison randomly.
---
Of course the chance for these is already kind of low (maybe 1 in 100 or so? I really don't know) but seeing as there is a ton of them, I doubt you'll see him in normal gameplay soon.
---
But I believe you can request certain characters too, or at least look through them in the game.
---
Would've to check at home which is currently 7 hours away because work.
---
To be fair. If it's from them taking away the money he recieved he should still be above 0.
---
the thing is, he has received or bought illegal in game money. and spent more than he got. well. i guess they want to remove the isk from the game. and this is one way.
---
Aw man don‚Äôt get my hopes up
---
Building deathstar POSs was a massive pain in the ass but it was also something I enjoyed a lot.
---
Nah couldn't hit me

If you are rolling 20hrs a day, sure.

---
also witnessed DD + 2 Scalpel Combos
---
Eve is free to play now to let people try the game, there is no time limit on your free play but it is a little restricted.
---
Star citezen will not get much appreciation in the eve community for multiple reasons. and im not going to advise you to go there, it LOOKS great, but pretty broken game. not cheap from what ive been told.
---
Starcitezen and ED are more alike than eve, eve is different completely.
---
ive had plenty of hours of fun in ED but the fun did end after about 200hours.
---
ive watched about 7hours of Star citezen twitch gameplay and got bored.
---
ive played eve for 4years....and still play daily today
---
I've been told before I'm too honest. I don't scam. I've hauled fuel, faction battleships, modules, PI worth more than every isk I have because people trusted me. I've delivered every contract I've hauled, even when it's definitely not been in my favor.
---
People ask me why. Put simply, reputation means everything when I haul someone else's stuff. I would not get the contracts I do, the isk I do, or get *my arse rescued* by the people I've done contracts for if I was willing to steal from them.
---
In a game where you're allowed to cheat and steal, choosing not to has benefits.
---
I got an itch starting
---
Hold the fuck up. You aren't thinking burn like spontaneously combust are you? Like catch fire? You aren't actually that dumb are you? You know what chemical burns are right?
---
Do you listen to yourself?
---
&gt;The risk/reward balance (and consequently null being a high risk/high reward place) is not a player choice. If it was, then we wouldn't have mechanics like CONCORD, gate guns, and so on. The risk/reward is actively enforced by CCP and the game design. It is advertised by game trailers. It is a very essential Eve mechanic yields an interesting game, and has been here since Eve's creation. Yes, it is pretty much dictated. Making null safer than hisec shouldn't be a choice in a well-designed Eve.
---
CCP made that decision about the risk/reward, players according to the rules in the sandbox made the 'safety'.
---
&gt;I believe many people won't take the new deal involving higher risk. But that's also a good development. It means less faucets and a more sustainable Eve macroeconomy. Ofc some farmers will quit. But also many from the offending side are more active with blackout than ever.
---
Again, Rise already mentioned that the faucet issue was fixed by the application nerf to fighters and the NSA changes. Blackout and the following cyno nerf are just stomping it into the ground further.
---
&gt;None of this is about nullsec being unprofitable or nullseccers being "farmed to death". It is merely a taxation problem. In taxation problems you try to reach to an optimal number which won't be too oppressive to the tax payer (so he keeps his activities), yet high enough to match the needs of the overall system (healthcare et al in real life, content in Eve). Average null farmer loses something like 5% of his farm to hunters (3% in umbrella regions). I argue that 15% is a better ratio for the health of this game; so the risk is not too oppressive yet creates sufficient content. If it ever becomes higher than that, you will see me arguing that the risk in null is just too high.
---
Cool, so if the number drops to 0% due to everyone being docked up it should become even more dangerous? Also, this shouldn't have anything to do with what you consider a healthy ratio. As you mentioned CCP should decide on the ratio, not you.
---
&gt;They already lost a great number from the hunting, content-seeking players due to the current stagnation and safety in the last few years. The changes are attempts to address that stagnation and safety. You'll have to trust CCP on whether which balance is more profitable for them.
---
To quote many of those people: Git gud!
---
&gt;They are not stupid. They are far more on top of what's happening than you and the other disgruntled nullsec linemembers.
---
Wow, remember who you are Olmeca. You're not a politician sitting on the CSM for your voters. You're a **community** representative.
---
Grath literally works with all kinds of cement for a job and it doesn't burn dip shit.
---
Shhhh hyou arent supposed to point out RnK were risk averse bads blobbing in 100% safety.
---
Getting concrete on you isn't enough to cause a chemical burn sorry.  Like even if i threw a bucket of it at you its not going to work like that.
---
Now if i kept you sitting in it for a bit yea, you'd probably get fucked up but throwing a milk shake full of wet cement on somebody isn't going to cause you to get burned.
---
This isn't something i have to google to know about since you know, I work with it all the time.
---
the can NOT be scanned at all.   
---
Best you can do is try and work out some vectors and try and blind drop a bookmark as you pass them by etc.   
---
It works if you put them between celestials as people will eventually figure out the geometry you used. If to put them between anomalies or signatures they're harder (if not impossible) to blind drop.

* Loki (13,800,000kg): 652 isotopes
---
* BLOPS, taking a bridge (148,800,000kg): 7031 isotopes
---
* BLOPS, using its own drive: 350 isotopes
---
So it takes half as much fuel to jump a BLOPS with its own drive as it takes to bridge a cruiser the same distance.
---
purdy sure anyone would kill any rorqual if they could and if they don't its only because they cant
---
This fit has high active Explosive shield resistance, which is perfect vs Angels. If you're fighting something else like Serpentis, you can change the Explosive Deflection amplifier for something else, although I'm not sure how well it would fare. Missile ammo can be changed to anything you like.

Light fighter application and velocity buff by 20% please
---
Yap, you can track them down using DSCAN, just as you would use DSCAN to scan down a ship on a safespot ;)
---
&gt; Getting concrete on you isn't enough to cause a chemical burn sorry.
---
Not quickly, it's not basic enough for that. But if you can't wash it off yourself all day it might be a different story.
---
&gt;This isn't something i have to google to know about since you know, I work with it all the time.
---
You should also be aware then that when you get a ton of it on you all the time you will have less of a reaction to it than the normal folks who don't get splattered in wet concrete all the time.
---
Generally they'll be directly between two planets, and really close to one of them, so you would warp between them repeatedly and leave a bookmark each time, until you're on grid with it. I don't even think you can combat probe them.
---
So i've been playing for long time too. Indeed i have all the tools to be dangerous and i am, i've won my fare share of  "1 - 10 vs 5 - too many to count" and i'm totally fine with the idea that x5 numbers working together should be able to whipe the floor with me or my leet fleet. 
---
But here comes the umbrella meta and suddenly it doesn't matter how expensive my ship or pod is, it doesn't matter which tactics i use or how skilled i am because people have their perfect intel and cynos, so when i enter the system, everyone is either tethered allready or it's a carrier (which costs less than my t3c) that will just press the magic button. It is really beyond me how people were still able to die.
---
Null has never been really dangerous for a capable player (and blackout didn't change it), but when you don't have to know how to play or pay any attention or cooperate with others beyond joining a fleet and fitting a cyno - it's too safe.
---
not when they only drop on people they know they can kill before the counter play arrives. The risk averse nature of droppers is not going to change because dropping was made more inconvenient,  if anything its easier now, because only certain ships can counter drop them and they are easily melted.
---
If Signal Cartel puts them there, yes.
---
If it's your home hole blow it up. If not, don't touch it. We like Signal Cartel.
---
&gt; not without combat probes.
---
You can't combat probe them. That and the fact that the content is just some thousand ISK keeps most people from destroying them.
---
Should someone need them then the rescue team can be contacted [here](https://evescoutrescue.com/copilot/911).
---
and what should he do with that n years old IP? Ping it?
---
Soon they can just jump to covert cynos on safe pings.
---
these will be such a cancer
---
You mean 32bit right? Presuming you're taking about the 2038 problem.
---
Listen to this guy. He knows what he's talking about.
---
Are they bugged? Is no one sending in new reels? Suddenly they seem to work fine when there's a new skin pack to promote. I wish they showed a bit of news too, not unlike the tv in the old captain's quarters. 
---
*adjusts camera again
---
They take all the earned assets as well. Not sure how they calculate that but that's what I believe put me in the negative as I've traded a bunch and resold stuff with the isk I was given.
---
I know I'm a random internet person and I'm also very sceptical when I read stories such as these but I 100% did not buy isk for real money. I started playing in 2009ish and I was a noob (still am) that hung with some of the more well versed friends who gifted me a lot of stuff and guess some of it was against TOS. I had no idea. Probably should have. 
---
I'm still debating starting anew, or pulling the plex trigger. I have to admit it leaves a sour taste to be burned like this, but I'm also not sure if I want to abandon my character. I've asked CCP if it's possible to have my balance reset to zero but have to wait what they'll say. I've also asked to provide any evidence I have to prove I really had no idea.
---
CCP at one stage forced all the Rorqual pilots out of the POS's and into the belts - causing much anger and resentment. The PANIC module was a peace offering
---
Init. sure loves working with Pandafam lately.

That‚Äôs poo.

Lets Encrypt are just fine for it. 
---
Yes, they're short duration. But they can easily be automated for renewal.
---
Yes, they only validate control of the domain at time of issuance. But that's normal, other than for EV certificates.
---
And EV has had people demonstrate that it's near worthless, with clashes of organisation names. 
---
(Cert authorities are, basically, a scam. )

etc etc
---
you can still use station and not be shit. just align before warp and pay attention.
---
First time I hear about this, what drama they are planning to cause?
---
With Panfam we know exactly where they stand, Legacy on the other hand....
---
eh, he should have bitten that bullet, even if that meant losing some sp. after all, 13.2 years would have amounted to a bit over 312m sp :P
---
also, i'm not sure if the body isn't aging as usual, so he'd basically get out after say 60 years on basic mortality, lost the sp anyway, and then have to train up as before
---
Don't trust hoboleaks for everything.
---
Sometimes it's just attribute cleanup, when it's being handled a different way.
---
The crystal ball is murky and cracked.
---
MTU hunting in high sec. It's hilarious the amount of salt you get from popping those.
---
Maybe rather than connecting to thera.
---
It could be a wh static in system with random connections to systems/whs. Large mass
---
There's no goons on fairbanks you moron. You wouldn't know that because you can't read the paywalled section of their forums though.

eRA oF ChAOs - dELeTE JiTA 4-4
---
so iirc ccp's argument about structures and celestials not actually orbiting stuff was that it'd render the bookmarks invalid. now that they're rendering all the instawarp, instadock, gank, mtu and whatnot bookmarks around jita 4-4 invalid... will they make physics finally say yes?
---
Except the export function lists drones individually, not in stacks, a single Ishtar, Domi or Nestor can have 20+ lines of just drones
---
The most unpopular would be ganking miners and/ or popping their MTUs. They get angryyyyy. Not exactly what you were asking but definitely makes you unpopular in high sec.
---
Ok so:
---
* Your mining amount is awful. 100 times worse than the venture. You also have less room to store ore.
---
* Your resistances are low. You need resistances to be at least 60% for each element for whatever tank you are using. So a shield ship needs 60% in each shield resistance. 
---
* Resistances work as follows: the more you have the more damage % is blocked. So 60% thermal resistance makes you take 60% less thermal damage. Lots of armour/shielding is useless without resistances.
---
* Your capacitor is not stable. You will run out of power very quickly and your repair modules etc will all turn off. 
---
* You need to put manure paste in an ancillary armour repair, otherwise it is worse than a T1 armour repair. Nanite paste is expensive. 
---
* industrial cargo ships are NOT meant for combat or mining, so will fail at both. Your ship will die very quickly to those NPC ships. 
---
* you are safer in a venture as it can quickly warp out when you seen them arrive near you. This ship will be so slow to war away that they can just shoot it to death.
---
The issue is also the frenemy thing.
---
If goons roam in panfam space, they can hit structures, jump bridges etc. to provoke a response. And yes this can also be done outside of the umbrella range.
---
If goons roam in legacy space, we know they're friends on the strategic level, so pre-arranged fights have to happen as you can't poke their shit to provoke responses.
---
Hell, ansiblexes and cyno beacons are pupursefully easy to bash BECAUSE it makes it easy to provoke a response.
---
Yeah probably.
---
What's a bulkhead?
---
Hey man, cool with the ellipses, you only need three dots and you're using them in the wrong places and the wrong times!
---
CCP admitted that logistics was a unintended casualty of the cyno changes. Dont get me wrong - I like the changes, but now a JF pilot needs to train his 3-6 cyno alts to a level 5 skill, and put them in ships that cost actual money along a route that might not be safe.
---
Sounds like dota to me
---
Getting a monopoly on a valuable specific resource by camping it killing anybody not part of their scheme in both factions. It was very common on private servers due to the lax moderation, but might not fly with Blizzard's TOS
---
Yeah it has to be 32bit. There's no fucking way we've hit the maximum integer value for 64bit. Also, by that time, I'm sure even most companies will have switched to 64bit
---
POS stands for Player Owned Starbase, no affiliation to any stations at all, namewise.

Thank you for the correction, editing my post.

Krabs are pretty popular on Reddit and Twitter, and beyond.

Brigading.

90% of players in doughnut allys are absolutely incompetent.

That's why you carry a sneaky flight of combat drones to get on the km. l33t logi life.
---
Goddamn we fed a lot of carriers.
---
Great video..... but the music.......
---
Not that incompetent that you and your squad are getting 5-10 kills each before you die. 
---
Unless they're flying Ibises or something.
---
Well thanks for clarifying his point. If that‚Äôs the case, good riddance.
---
you mean the things in "the arms" of the structures? don't you think those will just be a part of the finalized structure?
---
Cause individual stuff, I don't see (could be my incompetence of course, wouldn't be the first time;) )
---
make it very low tracking, and it's okey again.
---
For the fun of those that can't be fucked holding sov.
---
ASCN lives on (in our hearts)
---
Actually i have \~6:1 kdr with \~10 points per kill. So yeah - pretty much that incompetent and not ibises.
---
Not getting a sec status hit for shooting people?
---
You drop in to buy/sell shit then get the fuck out of there.
---
Agreed. You can get up to all sorts of fun shenanigans in busy highsec space.
---
That‚Äôs exactly what someone with bots would say.
---
Yes there is a nod to EvE in PA. Think theres another prisoner as well, with an EvE bio.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt you needed to have spent the isk after receiving it to end up negative after they took it away?
---
With the new no local deal in null things are getting more interesting at least.
---
Should be, amazing stories with both inheritance, and the seyllin arc of chronicles, makes me miss tha side of eve
---
Someone get the OP a therapy dog.
---
It's just the standard "eLiTe pVP" sperge. One of those nonsense lines they like to throw at people when they don't actually have a valid argument but don't want to admit they don't know what they are talking about.

Ok. 99% safe.
---
Make. Blackout. Permanent.
---
Reinforced Bulkhead II. Low slot increases hull hp.
---
Agreed. Wouldn't stop regular carrier shenanigans though. They'd still be quite op.

How did you fit so many bad ideas into a single post? That‚Äôs quite an accomplishment.
---
Can't make an omlet without extracting salt from the spoiled, and entrenched brats of EVE online. Thought this game was filled with ruthless sociopaths?

---
Do warp core stabs work against burner rats that scram you?
---
When has winterco won? Maybe people will post about it when it actually happens.
---
Never
---
I don't understand. Why would you even try to align anywhere if there is a non-friendly super sitting next to you? Or do these usually jump in after the freighter starts moving?
---
Such an honor, and to think i was not even trying. :D
---
&gt;Thought this game was filled with ruthless sociopaths? 
---
Was until ccp removed all the content they were interested in.
---
Nice!
---
Well, winterco will.
---
Great pipebomb, but it's just another group dogpiling on winterco.
---
This was a ridiculously fun USTZ fleet. I should have gone to bed on a work night, but when Pandoralica stays up late, you don‚Äôt want to miss it!.
---
Smells like fear ... I like it!
---
Just to make things straight, either bring the local back with a delay representing the frequency at which the gate scan the system, or complete the blackout. Make the capsuleers real blind. Zkill have a great idea by asking CCP to delay all information by 2 hours.
---
Cause it seems like there‚Äôs a logic gaps behind the blackout. Just close it CCP. One way or another (or give me a more complete answer that make some sense ;) )
---
the specific part they'll run into is that it was forbidden in vanilla's tos to cooperate with the other faction, and they're building a cross-faction mafia

I'm hoping for a yulai ruin

Want a laugh I missed all the legacy action , why you ask . Well im a fan of Pandos and was watching the stream , when out of nowhere our legacy fc goes flying across the screen followed by caps jumping in. Turns out the ping for soem reason never made a sound on my discord lol
---
Player owned structures will never gain the trust level of an NPC-Station. I mean, what item except PLEX is traded mostly in Perimeter? I can find none
---
Great start, learning the most important lesson in EVE immediately ...
---
trustworthy only for donut members like you
---
This is why we have no new players staying in the game because of dumb mindless fuckwits like you with a mentality that is so outdated its untrue
---
Can confirm based on the number of downvotes and "that's not real PvP" comments I get from flairbaiting fools.
---
Captian quarters?
---
The spawning systems.
---
The systems you can spawn in as a new player.
---
He keeps a cyno up, sometimes jumps a JF through it to give them a sense of security, then jumps the nyx once the JF is halfway through aligning. Sometimes the JF spaghettis and doesn't dock (because you can't dock when you have initiated warp, you have to cancel then dock), and then the JF dies in a single volley.
---
It'll give you some help, better than not having it.
---
If someone is determined to bump you, your options are
---
1. be bumped.
---
2. Leave
---
3. use a bunch of alts in catalysts to gank them.
---
It's a pretty decent SIM. It's my go to when I got half an hour to kill and don't want to start anything heavy. It has some nice humour as well.
---
The nyx usually jumps after the JF undocks and hits warp
---
Oh I know. Just didn't play in a while.
---
&gt; JF pilot needs to train his 3-6 cyno alts to a level 5 skill
---
Well, he doesn't NEED to.
---
They only need to to take full advantage of the buff part of it.
---
It's a nerf at the low end, and a buff at the high end.
---
So you press dock because you should be aligning. Or you press ctrl space and then dock.
---
The nyx has to take at least 2 game ticks to hit you. And maybe you don't press warp when there's a noob ship sitting on the undock? If you undock to see a spooky obvious cyno maybe just... don't for a bit.
---
What are you even talking about anymore
---
Imagine caring this much about an even more garbage version of an already garbage game
---
Krabbing in carriers?
---
having more options to force player interaction
---
You have the Fax umbrella that I'd argue is more oppressive.
---
Umbrella is the most risk averse playstyle. Otherwise you'de be the one with cloak and didn't bitch about it.
---
&gt; because they wanted to.
---
almost every reply tells me different

Easy.

Health problems.
---
Bait with a cruiser to drop a cap on the guy who takes the bait. This is the problem with eve. Why not just man up and gate your carrier around looking for PvP.
---
&gt; dumb mindless fuckwits

Nice name your kid has ... hi mom btw o/

It is more about dropping on the carrier/super that will want to kill this cruiser.

oh for sure, im fully aware of how to look out for this. from hunting them myself. its pretty much why i stopped JF'ing unless its just alliance structure to alliance structure. its just a high risk. that can be avoided, but eve. you know
---
A) fit a better tank
---
B) Bring friends
---
C) sit some tackle on the other side and kill them there

D) bring more friends

Cyno inhibs take 60 seconds to anchor. Cynos are just lit as standard. Make cyno inhibs instant and it would be a fairer playing field

tldr anyone?
---
Chances are I was probing and exploring wormholes before you even started playing this game.
---
Got love how ccp makes ganking  so easy in highsec..
---
You can also always drop things into any citadel (no access required) and the asset safety them to low sec.  Costs 15% but better than losing the lot.
---
Yeah, no. I wasn't around reddit when hics were changed but it was a relief cause long scrams on an ass tanked ships were a cancer, so i guess you were among people patheticly bitching around it as you are now. Btw whtat's so good about current playstyle that is getting the negative impact - lack of brain activity or massive amount of rmt?
---
i appreciate you realize im not bad mouthing you specifically in any way. just saying that CCP, and the internet can never be sure, you know? so they may be resistant to help. but CCP can be awesome sometimes.
---
its completely not your fault, when i was new my CEO would do rewards as well, isk won off i want isk's website. but not earnt through it, just won. so i can understand your situation. hopefully you have some un needed assets to trade, sell on the toon etc. you can start small, selling little stuff to earn the isk back to sell the bigger stuff.
---
might suck, but its like real world debt in a way. im sure every million isk past all of this you will appreciate way more.
---
The real issue is you now have to be prepared
---
So, Harley Davidson owners?
---
Yea olmeca pointed out that I messed up the numbers, and I agreeed.  I did in 5second on a lazy thought while smoking a joint.
---
Why should I have to defend the CSM's own argument from itself?
---
So now go and break it down pve/pvp kills and all that bullshit I am too lazy to do so we can have a real comparison instead of all getting mad about not ganking vni bots.

Or are you just here to throw more shit on the wall too?

That doesn't make any sense. Try again.

How many have biomassed, you seem to know ?
---
He tells us how great blackout is and how shitty carebears are because they don‚Äòt play the game how he plays it.  Overall he shits on everyone who is a carebearer and says they deserve the destruction of their ganestyle.
---
Not worth reading it.
---
&gt;, so i guess you were among people patheticly bitching around it as you are now
---
You're a real idiot, you know that? It's the self proclaimed "hunter" types who cried then. Why the fuck would I have complained??
---
&gt;Btw whtat's so good about current playstyle that is getting the negative impact - lack of brain activity or massive amount of rmt?
---
I don't know what you're even trying to say here? Is English your first language
---
I just like how people cry for 4+ years asking for CCP to nerf PVE player and then make shitpost about PVE player crying because they get nerf
---
tbf the people crying are high sec bears that got pulled into null a few years ago cause ccp released invincible isk printin mashines.
---
Apparently FCs arw so good they can get an entire horde of f1 monkeys to retarget to a recon in an instant in the middle of battle, but they are also too crap to get all their caps through the cyno immediately.
---
&gt;  What was it HIC changes that got an exponential amount of salt before?
---
i remember the only salt coming from WH people since they would have lost a siginificant QOL improvement. no one else was crying, lurch HICs were broken as fuck
---
He asked how you can have an economic depression in a video game then goes on to say that it causes people to lose jobs and finishes with the fact that you cant lose jobs in a video game. Recessions and depressions are economic terms that have nothing to do with job or people's ability to hold them. In other words, you can have a recession or depression in eve. People won't lose their jobs, they will just quit playing since they wont have the spending power in game to make it worth it.

Less logged in accounts doesn't necessarily mean less players. 'The game is dying' is not an objective fact either.
---
Dude seriously you OK sounds like you are having a melt down go outside get some air lay off the "coffee".
---
If i was an idiot i'd joined goonswarm. English is not my first language and i'm pretty drunk - sorry for that. I'm trying to ask what was good about your dying  playstyle.
---
&gt;The game is dying' is not an objective fact either
---
I didn't say this.
---
&gt;Less logged in accounts doesn't necessarily mean less players.
---
It's a pretty strong indication. 
---
As is the less kills in null.
---
And when you do one thing for a long time, your reflex is much lower than it is when you start the thing.
---
You can compare that to people reacting to a car accident when they never had one before.
---
The proof that your opinion is retard, is that it just does not reflect the reality, without considering other are "potato  level".

Show me on this doll where the carebears touched you.

Those smartbombs are mesmerising.
---
You need some if you want to unlock things., for example, you need racial frigate V to unlock assault ships.
---
Also, some skills effect literally everything you do, and so training to V is worth it.
---
stick it in your ear.
---
Ah finally a guy that doesnt get butthurt. Luv u m8
---
yeah I thought the blanket statement was inaccurate, figured I'd ask.
---
You can check what level 5 of a skill will allow you to use in terms of equipment/ships/turrets/etc. If you‚Äôre considering training a skill to 5, check to see what it unlocks and if it‚Äôs nothing you‚Äôre going to use, then it‚Äôs probably not worth it unless you have nothing else that‚Äôs useful to train.
---
Nice
---
They are no one where near as OP as people make them out to be.
---
You can never drop too many titans.
---
We were isk positive :)
---
If nothing else, Most of the magic 14 so u can make the most out of ur ship fittings. 
---
subsequently upping ur dps it mining yield is always good. There are plenty of skills that aren't need to lvl 5 for most players, eg. Corp management skills. Some ships are op at lvl 5 too (compared to lvl 4), but you'd still have to be obsessed with flying that ship to make it worthwhile. If ure fighting bittervets, make damn sure ur lvl 5 because they certainly will be.
---
I love that one Avatar that isn't aligned properly, where is he going?
---
I'm not in goons.. and you don't even know my playstyle.
---
Where are you getting these baseless assumptions? Disliking the fact that gangs of cloaky T3Cs only ever engage shit they can kill with ease doesn't make me a goon.
---
Cloaked cowardice is a risk averse playstyle. That's a fact
---
TLDR?
---
Looking at that thread the amount of people falling for your title is hilarious.
---
CCP Hilmar &amp; CCP Burger doing AMA

Or he bought new stuff the replace the hauls he had just lost.

new mobile app coming to update skill queue and get skillbooks.  Hilmar lost a mining ship ages ago in eve and he thought this was a key point in his journey
---
There is a formula for friendship. 
---
CCP like saunas.
---
Not because I have an issue with small alliances like that, I actually think it's healthy for the game - but I'm curious. Why are you in a small alliance that works like that, rather than a nullbloc? Everything you described is very much possible in the nullblock alliances.
---
d'aw.
---
get well spacefriend.
---
^(dat apostrophe tho)

You can look it up and see that it came from a country or ISP that you wouldn't have logged in from. Then you'll be able to provide a time frame in a support ticket.

Nice to watch Opus ;)
---
Thing only Eve player can understand
---
No, but I had to sing gangnam style because my cell phone went off in the middle of class once.
---
So the counterpoint to the pilot being an idiot is that at some point you get lazy undocking the third most expensive class of ship in the game? You're not just bring r/eve ironic? Lol.
---
It depends on skill set. If I were in this situation, I'd wormhole my way out to a quiet corner of null and run relic sites for a few days.
---
If you need it to unlock something that you want, go ahead and train it.  
---
If you have nothing better to train, go ahead and train it.
---
If it doesn't unlock something you want, and the only benefit is some per-level percentage bonus, you probably have something better to train.
---
There are a FEW things where it truly shines, however.  Logistics ships 5 comes to mind as an example - Logi 4 is practically unusable in comparison.
---
judging by the pictures from the sauna last night I would say he probably is.

State of EVE - SP for logging in after "Blackout"
---
There is no counterpoint. Your sole contribution is to insult other persons, therefore you are an idiot.
---
You're the typical retard who "never makes mistakes" basically because he never tries something that may lead to mistake. Yet he has an opinion on what the other people do. Typically thinking that anybody would react under less than 2s when something new happens. 2s is the time you need to understand something is wrong.
---
  
---
You litterally have no idea what you are talking about, but accept to be that retard insulting people because "you would do better in their shoes". You were never in their shoes, and will never be. Mostly because you are  not even able to understand what they are doing.
---
Thank you, it was bugging me
---
I undocked yesterday to try to find something to to fight. From esotoria do insmother. All ratting index almost zero. After 20 jumps got myrmidon on dscan. Finally something. It was at a station.
---
More 20 Soo jumps. Nothing and nothingness
---
Decided to log off. But took a look at zkill. The myrmidon got dropped by 30 test bombers and blackops...
---
Yeah pvp is great
---
2016-2018 full of bullshit updates and now ccp trying fix their mistakes.
---
This is avenger level salt
---
A 10b ship loss won't cripple most people nowadays, and a lot of people have managed to AFK krab with an umbrella safety net into such ships with minimal piloting experience so it's not too surprising that people become complacent and careless.
---
We didnt hit 25k yesterday.
---
Titan 5, DD skills at 5, Triage and Siege skills at 5
---
Hopefully they never get any more development, if you need to power creep to innovate, you're not trying hard enough.
---
This is what silent mode is for!
---
WoW is only for big boi gamers.
---
Mh hours afk mining... only to see your POD floating in space, when you come back.
---
Perimeter 1.0 has better prices for Plex things. just saying
---
Lmao I'm in their shoes almost daily. Sure, my contribution is insulting them. What other contribution exists here? Literally the entire post was made to mock them.
---
I'm not even going to respond your whining fest about how 2 seconds is too quick a reaction time to know a super is on grid. Jesus christ lol.
---
I'm curious if your emotional lashing out is because you're the person that lost these 3 ships :thinking:
---
more like e-scooters
---
What a week to go on holiday üôÉ
---
That person is dumb, bad, and impatient
---
There isn't a "valid" RP explanation that pleases everyone for every mechanic or change... And there shouldn't be.
---
Some things happen for the sake of balance and the RP is an explanation for people who care about stuff like that, which matters but is not the important part.
---
Yes, they can do more with the "chaos" shit they have started, but you have presented the absolute worst reason for them to make balance changes like that. 
---
"Because the lore part doesn't quite add up"
---
Like lol.
---
&gt; so iirc ccp's argument about structures and celestials not actually orbiting stuff was that it'd render the bookmarks invalid. 
---
Also because that sounds incredibly hard to do.
---
&gt; You're either fighting absolutely incompetent players or you're chatting garbage 
---
We're talking about 40-50 F1 monkeys. The FC is pretty much the only competent person on that field. It's pretty simple, they rely on webbers and tacklers to catch us. If they can't web or tackle us, I can stay on field forever as long as I don't make a mistake.
---
&gt;Adapt then.
---
You think I didn't adapt? Why do you think Bomber's Bar became so popular? Why do you think whaling became so popular? It's the only reasonable way of taking down ships under an umbrella. If I cyno in dreads, what's going to happen? I now have 10 supers on grid because this is Delve and they can out-escalate whatever I can throw at them.
---
Who/what are carebears?
---
That's for sure. I'm looking forward to other changes that CCP makes in the chaos era.
---
Ok make sense. I was thinking myself but seeing talk about regen and a cap booster I was wondering. With the fact that you can disable the shield booster if you're targeted and stuff.
---
Does the rorq get unusually more targeted than the rattles by the way?
---
Meh, they‚Äôre probs going to stay blue to Legacy and FIRE, which also means goons can come help out.
---
Going up north after NCPL moved would‚Äôve been cool as there‚Äôs space they could grab without having to blue up yet another major entity, imo. But we see the state of their server anyways I guess.
---
Loosing a Titan is a big event in my opinion.
---
you are sooo rude ;)
---
They are old, I want to say around the time of faction caps and npc caps.
---
It's NC, so components only.
---
That's from days ago.
---
The freight cyno is today's new hotness.
---
If you have nothing to contribute, then STFU. That's basic education.
---
Laughing at people just proves my point : you are an ignorant and don't understand what could cause such a km (and yes 3 km in a row is much).
---
So no, you are not in their shoes. All you are doing here is show that you are a retard with your meaningless insults and "2s is easy".
---
But whatever, when you get some experience and you will make a mistake that costs you 10B I will be glad you voice your opinion.
---
Thank for sharing this setup. Frankly I just find it more fun than what I've seen. High dps ship that can actually do some pvp + a rorq that has an awesome siege animation. And not way less SP than 3 dreads setup and such.
---
I hope I survive long enough in wormholes to earn this setup.
---
Yep confirmed.
---
lol, we didn't hit 24k yesterday and when I looked during USTZ we had less than 16k.
---
Last one to unsub, turn off the lights please

Weird. I guess all my years of living in the US and working during EU times was just a fluke

Ah, that explains alotüëç
---
But for real. Do you not think this post was posted for everyone to laugh at the loss? 
---
If you're talking about contribution all you've done is whined that I did exactly what the OP does lol.
---
&gt; Turns out that's Eve is not a flight sim
---
More like submarines. Though manual piloting is a thing, particularly in PVP.
---
Eve is very social. If you wind up trying it, get out of your NPC starter corporation and into a player corp ASAP after you finish the tutorials.
---
It wasn‚Äôt so bad before the cyno announcement.
---
I‚Äôm sure that hemorrhaging players is good for the long term health of the game though.

They just trolled you into injecting cyno V and cov ops I

Of course can‚Äôt make an omelette if you don‚Äôt have any eggs either.

Wait, your shittibg me. I JUST BOUGHT 16 FUCKING CYNO CHEETAHS.
---
FUCK! Wts 16 cheetahs. No really. I just bought them minutes before reading this.
---
For how long has the MER been out?  Since the economist?  It was probably an interesting tool for an MMO with a complex industry model.*   But we should have realized the game was off the rails  when it became the scoreboard instead of an interesting source of data about where there were game-play imbalances.
---
(*) It really isn't close in either scope or breadth to even some of the simplest industries.
---
no.
---
That's a normal post because someone lost an unusual value in a short amount of time. So it's best to be able to discuss in case there was something other people in the same case should be aware of.
---
Also I explained you why you were wrong. Is it too difficult for you to understand that when you have several accounts, 2s to realize one of them is in danger is too little ? BTW cancelling a warp requires from 1 to 2s.
---
Let's go ahead and make a huge swath of the player base feel unwanted and chase them off.
---
The game is healthy enough to get by without them.
---
&gt;That sounds very romanticized.
---
Null back then was different. You know how there's basically no pve being done in lowsec (aside from newbros who don't know any better and some experienced players who know better) because it's pretty risky? Null was a bit like that. Nobody really had enough caps or supers to throw around willy-nilly to defend the ratters. Ratters defended themselves, reshipped, put out bait, etc. There were way fewer nullsec members, a lot less F1 monkeys.
---
&gt;I'd say the majority of large nullsec block members are dying for a fight.
---
Honestly, I wish that was true, but too many null block members are ping warriors. To give you an example, if you gank a ratter in a competent wormhole group, it's the start of the fight. They're going to reship and fight you off. In null, people just dock up and wait until the threat passes. If they're looking for content, they'd also reship and fight, but most are waiting until an FC can order them around and F1.
---
&gt;They're just denying you (as the attacker) content.
---
I mean, they won't be able to kill me either. I'll die if I stay on grid, but since that's a guarantee, I'll just escape. The reason it's denying content is that a fleet of 40-50 could be formed to fight me off. It denies content to me and it denies content to the alliance. But that's part of the business plan for null alliances that are like the goons. Deny all content that enters your space to create the safest ratting environment. If people who roam your space always get denied, they're just going to stop roaming.
---
&gt;we get 50-100 people on even the most boring fleets
---
I can fight 40-50 people with my 5-10-man gang because we rely on piloting skills, expensive ships and implants over fighting numbers. Probably not win, mind you, but I can get multiple kills and stay on grid for a while, as long as I pilot properly and don't get caught by their webs.
---

It's true, you can use whatever words you want and no one can stop you!
---
Don't expect anyone to *respect* you though, if you take that attitude.
---
Well, you do learn things every day when you play Eve.
---
There has definitely been a proliferation of bots over the years, particularly after the alphas were introduced and then buffed (free account botting with VNIs and Gilas).  Then the game model became Injectors -&gt; rorqs -&gt; more injectors -&gt; more rorqs.  
---
So how many of the online players up to now where actually "playing" and how many of those lost up to this point weren't accounts, alts, or alphas who ever actually fired at another player ship in anger?
---
Can you honestly say that having 10-15,000 ACTUAL players isn't better than what was before?  We know before was bad.  We don't know now is worse and many are saying it is better.
---
What he said ? Currently at work and don't have headphones with me
---
Newp. Sometimes if I am hauling isotopes, I plan my fuel load for the trip + e-cyno, and then stuff the fuel bays of each JF with some topes.  It adds up.
---
The Department of Heat Management at CCP is on vacation too
---
How do I refine or restrict search results in zkillboard? As an example, I can look at pod kills, but I want to restrict it to high sec only?
---
Each one had a double wrapped contract in it, and each one of these wraps dropped.
---
Transcribe for people who cant access twitch right now
---
**!**
---
 Do you need professional help for the massive level of meltdown you just displayed?
---
PS: we think you cant pvp yourself out of a paper bag^((cause you is bad)).
---
&gt;so what you're saying is you want the risk to YOU removed
---
It's not risk if there's 100% chance of me dying if I stay, it becomes a certainty. Outnumbered against a subcap fleet, I have a risk of making a piloting mistake and dying. Against a super, I'm just going to die 100% of the time if I stay on grid, so I leave. And you talk as if I'd always survive a fight, I'm usually flying ships and implants worth 1-2b, there's always the risk of losing billions by losing 1 ship and pod.
---
PI to make dank ISKs is a multi-account thing. And you can't do it just anyplace. Any sec higher than 0.2 is pretty much a waste of time for extracting, unless you keep your expectations very low.
---
Also, you launched carbon compounds? You didn't even refine them? Never, ever do that. Always have BIFs on the extractor planets, to turn the raw dirt into P1. *That* you can sell. It won't be dank ISK but it will not be a loss.
---
Oh boy did the IT guy just stole your wife or what?
---
Congratulations!
---
"...I think, like confirming anything, like 'Asset Safety is gone.'"    
---
It's obviously cut out of context.
---
Current changes push people for more alts, more multiboxing alphas/omegas...
---
A cruiser is a target for everything. Instead of baiting a carrier or super with a cruiser why not bait with a carrier ... or a super. If you‚Äôd done that from day 1 instead of dropping on frigates maybe these cyno changes would never have been discussed
---
Preach, if all you care about in EVE is making isk....then if you quit I'm ok with it if I have to get an alt and mine my own rocks to build what I need to shoot the other guy then so be it. If you're upset about the current CCP changes then leave PLEASE you dont bring any content to the game anyway lel
---
This is a false equivalency.
---
Simple maths will always win. 
---
100% of 16k is still less than 50% of 40k
---
Haaaaa make sence ! Vacations season huh. Please come back soon, my modules are cooking.
---
45% is normal. I happened to burn my 5mn in three cycles already with max skills.
---
[https://everef.net/type/35658](https://everef.net/type/35658)
---
19 heat damage, that means after one cycle your middle-rack heat is 19%, so 19% chance to damage the low modules. With no luck it means, the propmod gets the full damage (ie 19 damage). On next cycle, you have 38% chance to damage your modules. With no luck again, you can reach an additional damage of 19 on the 5mn, reaching 38 damage out of 40 hitpoints, or 95% damaged in 2 cycles.
---
With thermodynamics 5, now : you get \*0.75 to the heat effect. to 14.25 heat value per cycle, ie up to 28.5 after two cycles or 71.25%.
---
People just don't realize propmods get destroyed very fast. At the same time, heat is very useful on them so ‚Ä¶
---
I think I'm banned
---
Then I'm going to call your bullshit too. It's at the very minimum 100m isk/hr and can go up to 200m isk/hr if you're fitting for max clearing speed and lower tank.
---
For all sections of space? Or just null sec?
---
I can't open twitch right now, can someone plz transcript the conversation?
---
Begone null shill
---
So like the comment like 15 levels up from here said and it only took one comment to get there... you're alt tabbing while your jf aligns?
---
üòÇ
---
Don't do PI in places where the tax rate is that high.
---
Join a corp in low or null sec, or in a WH, where your corp controls the POCOs.

---
General rule of thumb:
---
If you use a skill *constantly*, or are trying to unlock a new Tech2 module or ship, train to Lv5.
---
If you use a skill frequently, train to Lv4. 
---
If you use a skill occasionally at best, train it to Lv3.
---
And in Delve that wouldn't make a difference, I wouldn't find a fight there anyways because everyone would just dock up and then I would get a super dropped on my small gang.
---
All of space, even your car and house will be gone.

Expect login rewards through October so Hilmar can get that big bonus for Daily Active users.

Funny how it's only the fraternity Chinese players test cries about being botters, but of course the ones allied with them are different lmao
---
Please be true!
---
And thats the fuckin problem right there
---
Idea for rig: module heatsink (someone find a cool name for it)
---
Reduces heat damage by x% but reduces PG or increases PG need of module type y by z%
---
Drawbacks can can be lowered with whatever rigging skill applies.
---
T2 version has same chance but additionally a 5% chance per heatey cycle and module to avoid heat damage completely.
---
There could be rigs for guns, launchers, shield boosts, repair systems, prop mods... or just for high, med, lowslot groups.
---
Some T3C subsystems have a feature similar to this already. If that should stack or not is the balance teams decision.
---
depends if the skill has a positive % effect or a negative % effect. 
---
positive effects include weapon spec. They give a % to a value (ie DPS).
---
negative effect include intys, adv weap upgrade, some propmod skills. The thing is, getting a 5th level in a -20% per level skill is actually getting rid of the effect (you reach -100%) which is an infinitely better effect that getting the skill to 4.  
---
so those negative effect skills are really needed at 5, although their priority changes according to your activity.
---
But getting inties 5, or adv weap upgrade 5, is really worth it. geting large artillery specialization V however is a bit less useful.
---
Bomber's bar and bomber fleet really took off after super umbrellas became a thing because they're pretty much the only thing that can fight and kill through a super umbrella. This is part of the staleness of Eve. As an outsider, the only thing I can do to fight any of the big nullblocs is to get 40-50 bombers and basically insta-blap a cap. The gameplay gets really samey. In null a few years back (before it was a ratting paradise), all kinds of fights happened in all areas of null. Big blocs were the areas to roam because they would form up to fight you. Killing a ratter was the start of an awesome fight, basically yelling "we're here! come fight us!". Now they dock up, deny any content with a super and form up fleets that basically only finds content in organized brawls with other blocs.
---
I'm not looking for kills, I'm looking for fights.
---
Imagine a time when people honestly think gangs of hipsters wearing black face masks and beating people they disagree with are "anti fascists"
---
Haaaa that would make more sence, i didnt knew that the "roll" are kinda random , thanks for infos
---
pretty sure it just adds weight to it, idiot.
---
https://zkillboard.com/ship/670/losses/highsec/
---
1) you go on the ship pages
---
2) you select losses
---
3) Then you add /highsec/ ; /lowsec/ ; /w-space/ : /nullsec/ at the end of the url
---
it works with a lot of things for exemple you have losses of specific ship in a specific space of a character/corporation/alliance : 
---
https://zkillboard.com/character/2112303514/losses/ship/29340/w-space/
---
a literal definition of terrorism.
---
if you eject from a T3C just before dying you'll lose SP, i think there a 15 minute timers after you exit the ship while you can still lose sp
---
I'm guessing it was somewhere in low sec?
---
Well yeah since the nerf they definitely aren't what they were, but they still fuck shit up. Depending on the target, you'll smash a group of subcaps pretty well with the right fit.
---
So have we seen our biggest titan battles already if the goal is to make them less safe and prevalent/easy to get?
---
Thermodynamics V, checking in
---
I think the bigger point he is trying to make is still valid, even if the numbers are off.  
---
Bottom line: Isn't a game where every logged in character is attached to an actual player (accounting for alts, of course) a better game than one inflated with some thousands of bots?  I think we'd all agree it is better.
---
It's a 3 second out of context clip.
---
Delete Titans!
---
You make that sound like a bad thing?
---
Are those last two just vanity items or do they actually do something?
---
the heat acquisition is constant (and actually continuous over time, it's not granted at the end of a cycle), the random part is 1- does the module actually generates damage ? this chance is heat% ; and 2-how is that heat dissipated among other modules ? in some cases the module generating heat will take zero damage and an adjacent module will take all.  I also happened to burn my shield booster when I had my MWD overheated, or my cap battery  on a cruiser, in the case of the cap battery the mwd was like 50% damaged only (large cap battery is 40Hp just like the 50mn). That's why now I always keep the passive modules on the bar, so that I can quickly assess the heat effect.
---
SOMETIMES PEOPLE BURP KAREN WE CANT ALL BE PERFECT LITTLE FLOWERS SOME OF US HAVE BODILY FUNCTIONS
---
Kinda wish we had BS sized modules to anchor ourselves in space.  Hell, make it cost ore to fuel.
---
Jita is great, there's people who double your isk there
---
Sure, but you‚Äôre making an assumption about how many bots aren‚Äôt logged in vs how many people. Fly around high sec and you‚Äôll see bots that were found in null before. Not one person on the site has any idea how many bots vs players Eve is losing, but everyone is using the ‚Äònumbers‚Äô to defend their personal guess.
---
Easy company... 10 miles up, 10 miles down
---
This so much.  Back when I flew a JF routinely, it was the most butt-clenching thing I did in Eve.  I never took chances, lit my own cynos, never on the undock so I couldn't be readily bumped, etc. etc.  If I didn't like the looks of local (often if there was anyone in local), I just logged and finished later.  But injectors and credit card warriors are impatient.
---
I like those concerned, menacing looks, means change is coming.
---
I think you have been confused by the meaning of combat explo ship.The Heron is a scanning ship for the most part and combat probes make it that you can find drones and other ships ( usefull for finding peoples safe or free drones ) as normal probes can only scan sig's ( worm holes, data relic, and DED sites ) which are in the probe scanner window.
---
...i see no effort in joining one of the winning teams. have you lived outside of megablocs the past 4 years? no jumb bridge network, no citadel network, no logistic wing, no supercap umbrella.
---
those 5 guys put more effort into their roaming then any individual joining a megabloc
---
That's the only thing that gets Eve in the news
---
I agree with your point, that's why I didn't quote numbers.  Only CCP might be able to tell us how many "real" players have unsubbed - and even then I'm sure there's some wiggle room in the calculations.  How can you ever be sure in the marginal cases? 
---
I'm fine with CCP's aggressive moves to combat botting and breathe some life into a stagnant game - assuming they fine tune them based on the results.  I know that's a big assumption...
---
With the updates to Cynos in September what are jump freighters pilots going to do? how are they going to handle this change?
---
This is actually really chill. Love it.
---
He‚Äôs given bigger ones in the past
---
Combat Exploration ship are any ship that can run DED and or be used for PVP
---
Just vanity
---
The initial hype is wearing off....
---
I will posit your math skills are better than your reading comprehension.  Conjectures were made but no specific numbers given.  I'll further posit that your anger and accusations stem from things in your own mind that you read into the comments of others.
---
We KNOW that alphas made innumerable isk-printing botting accounts possible.  We KNOW that the various changes and additions to mining, ratting, anoms and upwell structures buffed the "multi-account" gaming meta.  We don't know, but we strongly suspect, that like someone with a 200 character SP farm, most of those accounts were involved in krabbing only.
---
I'm nearing two months, and I feel you on the specialization. I'm restructuring my skilltraining queue every couple of days atm, haha
---
Oh look another Permavirgin post
---
Like op ever managed to get a wife.
---
School restarted for a lot of people, summer is over.
---
I hope they follow through on his comments and make them the rare beast they should be.  High maintenance costs plus blackout should equal less titans over time.  Queue the CFC comments about how this is bad for smaller groups.
---
That's a standard exploration heron, it doesn't need the expanded probe launcher or combat probes. No matter how you fit a heron, it's nowhere close to being a competitive combat ship.
---
The difference of core and combat probes is that combat probes have almost half the probe strength(so scanning things takes longer), but like you noticed yourself with combat probes you can see ships, drones, structures and all sorts of space junk. They're only really useful for getting Intel in nullsec/wormhole space, or hunting people who are not on a celestial, gate, station etc. It's also worth mentioning that the expanded launcher takes 200+ CPU, so it will cripple most fittings except t3 destroyers or cruisers.
---
If you want to do PvP
---
All my lowsec jf kills have been dudes jumping in and warping to highsec gate without docking.
---
The purpose of null is very simple...Moons...R64 in particular. See alot of what people forget is that Null provides the ONLY market to obtain those items that come from R64 Moon Materials.
---
I would disagree. This game (or any mmo) is a hobby of sorts for us. We need people playing of all playstyles even if it's not yours it effects you. If we continue to bleed off casual players what will we have left? Hardcore pvpers, hardcore multiboxers, and bots.
---
Maybe that's your idea of a good place for this game but I do not think so.
---
Are undock bookmarks not a thing anymore?
---
Sure it's a pain in the ass to make them, but JF's are fucking expensive!
---
It's complacency. Most JF pilots are used to using citadels, which don't have this issue unless they are a free port.
---
A lot of JF pilots do a shit load of jumps per day. And after  few months of that muscle memory steps in. And when you throw a new variable, like a super all of a sudden there and you've already aligned and are clicking dock as fast as possible, by the time you figure out why it's not docking it's to late.
---
It hasnt happened to me yet but it happens to a shit ton of people on a regular basis.
---
while i agree about asset safety seems like a much more smaller problem then them being able to dock in a keepstar
---
i mean, thats you. changes nothing.
---
We see whelp fleets , tc3s, bombers, afs, whole nine you just have to be smart. Actually had an ad solo charge my carrier.....I was so confused by that one, he ran off after costing me a few min in fighters lol. The content is there but you're either gonna bring a big fleet or use guerilla tactics.
---
I can't get tripwire to locate my character. My location shows up nowhere, doesn't matter if I clicked track my system, refresh page or change systems. I added the system I'm in, in a tab but I don't show up as in that system
---
By the nature of their having had to move to HS it implies that Botting has been nerfed because if it had been as lucrative they would have been doing it.
---
I don't know the economics of mission running.  Can an Alpha make is doing it?  Are they able to run L4s?  What does the setup cost?  And how exposed to ganker-hunters are they? 
---
If blackout nerfed botting as opposed to making it uneconomical, that too is an improvement.
---
A few thousand regular caps would probably do the trick tbh
---
We miss a *lot* of big fights because blocs form up 1000v1000 fleets and then don't bother jumping in because they don't want to risk their priceless titan fleet, or know the other side has more titans so there's no point putting a single ship on grid.
---
simple (circular) orbital motion is about 1h of coding; been there, coded that. add some complexity for integrating that into the tick, and legacy pos code, i'd say probably around a day of actual coding and developer testing. since some gm stated that he accidentally moved a station to a gate crashing the node, moving stations around is at least partially supported. ofc, i have no idea how much qa ccp would do with such a feature, that might take a bit of time as well.
---
for on-grid bookmarks, one could even consider a feature offsetting them to a station or celestial, so those would still work with orbiting structures. we would just need to assume that things on the same grid have the same orbital momentum, as ships in eve are way too slow for most orbits and catching up to a station would thus be impossible without an oversized mwd :P
---
Doesn't this argument suffer from the same weakness as mine?  If you are right, then wouldn't the logged in #'s go UP?
---
To cherry pick arguments in favor of your own biases is probably one of the strongest defining characteristics of us humans.
---
Yeah no, we hate titans but they are so broken that if you don't have enough you get rolled by groups that have more. That's been true since when they were implemented.
---
It's just easy to mass store them, before you had to log them off on sitters. That's probably what lead to proliferation of everything since there's no sitter bottleneck

Combat Scan Probes are for scanning ships, drones, structures. You don't need them for relic/data analysis scanning. In fact, they are worse for this because they can't narrow down to 0.25 AU, only 0.50 AU.
---
You should still carry 8 on you in case you need them, but primarily use core probes for exploration.
---
R64's exist in lowsec as well, however lowsec groups don't mine nearly as much.
---
I personally don't use SRP unless 100% necessary to start, but thats my choice. Maybe you've missed the talks, asset safety is probably going away (ya know like wormholes...) so unless you krab in a npc station thats not safer since your shit drops as loot, and people love loot pinatas, also when was the last time a super fleet jumped into your WH, oh yeah never because you can't just jump an overwhelming force in right. Granted I haven't seen it since I've been a goon but goons aren't the only null group I've flown with. Goons will be fine, I've said that over and over again, we are powerful enough both economically and militarily that we don't really need to worry but the little guys are gonna get fucked. They will always have the same connection to their space with no way to block it and now a when they get hit by a super fleet any allies they have wont be close by to help them. So these changes are gonna fuck the little guy and leave a whole lot of null either empty or blue doughnut will come both of which are negative effects. And no I have never lived in wspace because that seems boring as fuck, I prefer daytripping, and its really hard to take a wher complain seriously when they can drop a dread in siege mode and make 600m a site all while if playing smart have a much lower chance of getting dropped than anyone in null since all they have to do is ensure their connections are known, scanned, and rolled to preferable connections. Maybe we should take away mass restrictions on wh that outta keep the levels where they need to be, null gets more dangerous and so does wh since wh rewards are insane, what do you think? wh with time only.
---
Lol people talking like Titan slugfests and massive battles are every week. Meanwhile crying that there's nothing to do.
---
death to all super caps!
---
The risk is that they knock out so many real players that trying to breathe life into the game ends up choking it. But I personally think it‚Äôs a risk worth taking as long as they keep iterating changes based on their results. People on reddit stating something has been great for the game because the numbers show that bots aren‚Äôt logging in is what I‚Äôm against. We don‚Äôt know if blackout or the cyno changes will be a net positive or negative for the game and all these log in rewards are muddying up the waters even more.
---
Not really, player count has always gotten eve in the news. 
---
The game is pretty broken when what were supposed to be rare flagships, are just as common in a fleet as mainline battleships. Every F1 monkey in null sec owns a titan these days and it devalues them.

Rorqual is pretty good hauler - will trade ability to use 'excavators' for ability to use still hauling rorqual.

They removed at least 3 bottlenecks with upwell structures:
---
- storage
---
- building capacities (limitations to XL-CSAAs all gone, Sotiyos are basically limitless)
---
- Minerals (Rorqual Ore Inflation - What took a whole alliance multiple large scale mining Ops now can be done by a single ISBoxer-Rorqual-Autist in one weekend)
---
I think over everything storage was the true bottleneck.
---
Doesn't matter how many you can build if you can't store them.

Remove the ability for supers to dock in keepstars. DO it you cowards.

---
you have a point there
---
i doubt it with the current meta.
---
/u/RustyBoon the implants give a bonus to maximum damage, but a penalty to spool up time. So your max ramp is higher, but it takes you longer to get there.  
---
With the current numbers, a full set gives you a 1.8 higher damage modifier ( which, combined with the base ship modifier of 1.5) gives you a 270% total bonus damage. This comes with a 23% ramp up penalty, so these are only useful if your on the same target for a bit. 3ish minutes with a leshak.
---
Skill injectors. It's a double-edged sword.  One one side there's massive revenue increases. On the other side, anyone with a good paying job can inject into a titan for about $400 USD or less.  So it comes as no surprise there are so many titans. 
---
Now with the injector system not going anywhere, there is no fix for this. They could introduce a super-titan like ship but then people would just inject into those as well. 
---
They could bring back POS bubbles and not allow titans to dock in anything again.

I still have a slight grudge that you fled TQ because of "the fight few vs. many" wasnt possible anymore here like you claimed, just to join the Serenity prototype of the Turbo-Blob, the Umbrella and the pinnacle of economy destroying RMT.

well at least LM seems to have embraced the new meta
---
Real life permitting, come back to TQ and prove how good you still are ;)
---
I don't know for certain, but I would guess this is a LS/HS system where people are warping to the highsec gate.  In that case, lazy/dumb pilots just click warp or jump instead of align first, then warp/jump.  That gives the Nyx pilot enough time to cyno in an alpha before they can react.  An undock wouldn't help in this case unless your undock was off grid beyond the Nyx' targeting and fighter control range.
---
And 70% of snuffs. :)
---
We did not need all those players anyway.

won't happen, as the remains of RnK were succesfully taken forward to Turbo-Blob-Titan-Spam-RMT-days on Serenity ...

I'd venture to say that Armageddon Navy Issues being flown in PvP are rarer than Titans nowadays. Think i'd get more excited to see one of those, than a Titan.

Let them dock, but don't let them be put in asset safety, and let them drop in the keepstar wrecks.

as someone who has JUST FUCKING GOT A TITAN FINALLY after years of play, hardwork etc etc. please dont now remove DD's or make them unable to dock (OR if you make them unable to dock please ensure POS's stay so i can sotre mine somewhere not in random space xD i mean holy shit, balance them. whatever. or maybe give a lot of time between now and the changes or somthing. making me wanna cry xD i fucking worked my butt off for this shit. i agree capitals need addressing. and doing it is difficult. but LET ME DD somone first and be able to store it somehow lol

You have to do Burner Mission in this constellation http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Metropolis/Ani#const. to get my numbers. 90% of all Burner Mission are 1-2 jumps, don't ask why, something about the target system distribution algorithm from CCP.

The good thing for you is the only thing CCP cares less about than running a reliable merch store, is wormholes. It's basically the same.
---
I don't get it. It's CCP's decision making which got EvE where it is now. Also the fact that the Avatar has 16!!! skins, which i am sure made them quite some money, tells me enough, it is pure hypocrisy . They will nerf Titans just to come up with something new people can dump their money into.
---
&gt;hen I looked during USTZ we had less than 16k.
---
Clearly, because Hilmar wants EVE changes to be so stressful, people seek medication. Turns out, it's easier to deactivate accounts.

why would you not use headphones to fleet up at work? like what kind of fucking amateur play is that - quite frankly this seems like a reasonable termination decision.

I hate that you're not even wrong.

&gt;at having 10-15,000 ACTUAL players isn't better than what was before?  We know before was bad.  We don't know now is worse and many are saying it is better.

Yeah, I can, because it means EVE loses profitability... and when that happens...

I think you are over estimating the number of bots.

tldr

&gt;there is no fix for this

Except actually balancing the game beyond SP limitations.

Citadel's may have a higher initial cost, but they are wayyyy cheaper to maintain.
---
Yes, but fact is that Rorqual can move as fast and as far as JF, excluding higsec.                   
---
There is significant price between JF and Rorqual (T2 vs T1 mats) and stuff like rorqual can have tank.             
---
I know that it potentially can be used as light weapon platform, link ship, super scram ship and even shield logi - **but at the same time before rorqual became all of this ^(and mining ship) it was always been a hauling platform**

Lifes good man. Money making is quite good and the pvp is pretty consistent. Great place to be right now. I spent most of my eve career in null and moving to whs really brought new life back into the game for me.

Looks great. Curious to see what it can be fit to as well as its cycle time/sp requirement. Icon makes me think it behaves like covert cynos in that sense which might be nice.

&gt;No more risk free moving, no more risk free unlimited storage. More incentive to wreck some keepstars.

No.

How is that? Im curious about what you think in that context.

anything right of center is called "nazi trash" today. Even thought it isnt. Antifa are literally the facists they claim to hate.

But logically, with the module specifically pointing out the Jump Freighter class vessels specifically, leaves little to be misinterpreted of including Rorqs. Though I partially hope I'm wrong.

Yep, coffined characters was such compelling gameplay. And it will be even better when they phase out POSes to have undockable ships again.

You seem to be acting like titan proliferation is a new thing. You are actually wrong.  The proliferation of titans started with ccps dumb constalation sov idea a few (10?) Years ago.  The large alliances had a capital system the could not be attacked in anyway unless they lost 51% of the contolation.  Because of this, titans were mass produced.  While it is easier to store and build them, titan proliferation has been here a long time.  CCP envisioned titans as being rare and they were for the first few years. Then they made it stuoid easy and safe to build them. Now stupid easy and safe to store them.

---
Due to min maxing, and optimal PVE setups becoming mainstream I would say that most people are probably making more isk than a couple years ago.  
---
Depending on how long ago we are talking, "power corps" hasnt shifted substantially in a couple years. "Top" corps, as defined by isk killing youve got Hard Knocks, Lazerhawks, No Vacancies, Scary Wormhole People all stitting at the top. Newish faces you may not recognize Ehefkae is a "new" corp made up of No holes barred, Sleeper Social Club and some ex Lazerhawks people. Many were previously in Reload This. Theyve shot up to the top tier quickly and over the next couple months will probably find themselves frequenting the top 5 as well ( they already have last 2 months, but it may take a bit to catch up to older corps in a " killed last 12 months" frame).  
---
I cant really do mid size corps justice, theres just so many of them these days, the amount of corporations doing a moderate level of PVP in WH space almost doubled 2018-2019.
---
How is what? They haven't iterated on wormholes basically at all. Leshaks are new FOTM because their projection per mass is through the roof. More corps have gone to nullsec statics to harass kspace instead if waiting to roll into one of 5 (maybe?) C5 corps that will give you a fight. C4 corps are still cancer.
---
Ever since they added titan docking they should have added ship upkeep costs for supers. Would make a nice isk sink too.

The issue is if you let Rorquals use this cyno and the cyno can be used on any ship (which is the expectation) you will just see battle Rorquals fucking everywhere.

How about we don‚Äôt throw concrete mixed milkshakes at political opponents you retard?

Should be noted that corporations that aren't active in terms of PvP will very likely get evicted from wh space

False, this is how YOU feel. for me? owning sov, being part of a group owning sov is nothing. whatever thats thier thing. i wants fights and capital fights too (not just caps)
---
Pretty sure the corp CEO handled that just fine. This isn't a real fucking business; telling someone they're being too sensitive in a gaming context when they were, in fact, being too sensitive isn't a dick thing to say, it's just being truthful and a little blunt. You made yourself look like a pretentious, condescending idiot.
---
Nope I just started playing a last month!
---
Don't bother coming back, unless you are a wormholer. I would take this as a great gift.
---
I mean, what was wrong with the normal cyno and the covert cyno?  How is this supposed to be different other than advertising exactly what's going to be jumping through?
---
You are assuming that multiboxers had just 2 accounts. It wouldn't be uncommon for each player to have 5+ accounts simultaneously online
---
lol you are bad if you think that WHs are just like NS without local and cynos.
---
i Dont think your tacking into consideration, the big blocs of the current timeframe. have all been nullsec dudes for so long now, no matter what this game throws at them, while they have dudes in fleet, theyll own sov. and fight for it if needed. or farm to grow and take more. 
---
and no matter what pure pvp dudes that are just in it for the fun and the fights and (maybe the SRP too) will always fill the ranks
---
Welcome to literally everyone in Raiden, Eve's first Titan centric alliance literally 10 years ago basically.  
---
We worked hard for years (with no rorquals or ez mode stuff like today) and had unparalleled military might only for CCP to nerf them into de facto uselessness/POS ornaments for 5+ years after the fact.  
---
Working hard for something doesn't matter to CCP, it's why most of those players quit on the spot.
---
You don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs seriously acceptable to go and attack someone for their political opinion pre-emptively do you?
---
If that‚Äôs the case it‚Äôs acceptable to go commie bashing too
---
Why not remove capital asset safety in player made stations and add capital fuel to pilot the biggest ships in eve?
---
There'll probably be less ship restrictions to fitting and/or less skills required to use it. Currently, you need about 90 days more training for a cyno alt (with their proposed changes). Cyno V is a long train for bombers. And if you want to use a regular cyno, then you have to sacrifice a recon every time you do a JF run for every mid (which would cause a huge spike in shipping costs).
---
Then they would have to address Skill Injectors as well, because otherwise you can just inject sitters. It's all moot at this stage, just adds more hassle to deal with titans (and supers).
---
Tl;dr a lot of words from a retard
---
Add a siege module to Titans that significantly improves otherwise negligible DPS. That way they have no remote reps if they are being useful. Lower the EHP so they fit with the normal progression for T1-T2 ships. In short, make them essentially T2 Dreadnoughts with Doomsday devices.
---
sorry it's the "can" in your first post that sounds like a real question.

You should edit it to a real affirmation/proposition instead of a question.

you can switch view from side to top by double clicking anywhere on the map. for adjusting scan range I am using alt+ mousewheel ( down or up )
---
Yep, and you should watch who's on the undock.  And watch the killboards.  JF'ing actually has a whole lot of out of game work to do it well.
---
I‚Äôm not watching, but that would suck. Rolling ships are a big content generator. And using rolling offensively to trap someone IN is a lot of fun. Not really sure why it needs to go. If people dislike rage rolling, just add a delay to getting a new hole after one is rolled.
---
You cannot combat probes can!
---
Some very dedicated pilots can sometime triangulate cans with dscan and manage to find them but it's quite a terrible job.
---
im not sure id quit on the spot. but i fear it may accelerate the 'quitting' i love hardcore changes, but for me personally (and ive already stated capitals are stronk and need looking at) for me all my eve life, even now thier everywhere titan has been like, the god, the one. the aim. and is the fact the game spirals into higher and higher ships until titans are on grid punching each other in the face?
---
eve has ALWAYS had escalations. if we completely remove the titan and supercarrier from even being useful except structure shooting, what is the escalation? 
---
i guess im just 6months behind on CCP's timeline of actually fixing shit lol. i should of got a rorq, and plexed the fuck out of accounts with isk to mine with 100rorquals and help the game become aids to get there quicker lol (jkjk still glad i did not do this)

Nope, there are some guys you don't shoot if you spent some years in Jspace.

Oh yeah that is great event and great video
---
if your plan is to make them useless then you nailed it
---
This is exactly what removing rolling will do.
---
I definitely don't want titans/supers to be useless. I was on the capital balancing group that put supers where they are now. We didn't know about skill injectors, we didn't know about rorquals, and CCP buffed them far past what I (and most of the team) wanted. About the only thing they did right was implement haw guns, but even that wasn't done fully like I intended.

yup, Metropolis region

lol raiden was just BoB mk III and your titans were funded through all of the handouts BoB got from CCP

Things you should definitely get to 5:
---
* Any skill that directly affects *all* ships you pilot. Fitting skills, Spaceship Command, most things in Engineering, etc.
---
* Racial ships (for whatever ship-types you plan on flying)
---
* Weapon Operation and Weapon Support skills (for whatever weapon types you plan on utilizing)
---
 * You can probably just assume Drones are mandatory too, with how many ships make use of them.
---
* Cybernetics (being able to run +5 implants and swap freely while in a Citadel is great)
---
Things that basically require 5 to be useful but are only specific to some playstyles:
---
* Logistics Cruisers
---
 * Remote Repair systems as well if you fly Logi.
---
* Recon Ships
---
* Cynosural Field Theory (for Covert Cynos)
---
* Jump Drive Calibration
---
* Thermodynamics (big difference in overheating longevity)
---
Things that you would probably get a sidelong look for not having at 5 prior to using them:
---
* Command Ships/Command Destroyers/relevant boost Specialization (for boosting)
---
* Tactical Logistics/Weapons Reconfiguration (T2 Triage/Siege are **big**)
---
* Minmatar Carrier (specifically in the case of the Lif)
---
* Racial Titan
---
* Biology (double boost duration is fantastic)

That will change the PvP meta huge. Time for cap blob fleets.
---
They've already marked Jita as being special for a while now, as it's one of the few systems you can't put structures down in, with most of the others being the systems new players start in.
---
Given how good combat Rorquals are, no to the first part.
---
Would love to see an Isogen sink.
---
12 chars boosted to cyno5 checking in!
---
If it wasn't for the salty after taste of CCP's dick still in my mouth this game would look pretty good after all these changes.  
---
WHERE'S MY FUCKING MILLION SP YOU DICK HEADS
---
YES, the kind of proliferation we had since introduction of Citadels and Lifeblood Mining is unique. It went up from a total of just a very few hundred Titans to multiple thousands atm.
---
In 2013 PL was nearly untouchable with maybe 150 active Titans and some 300 Supers, today you have to add zeros to each of this numbers to be on the same relevance level.
---
persoanlly i think titans and super carriers have silly amounts of buffer. and it is unessesary, and maybe to bring the buffer closer to the rest of the game (and adjust DD's damage accordingly) might do alot of good. as without as much buffer, it brings battleship fleets closer to the level. if im making sence. why does my avatar need 40million ehp? and why can i get 80million ehp out of my active armour aeon? thats silly.
---
i think fighters are ok personally, not sure if sirens should exist.
---
i think hawguns on a titan are ok since the last nerf.
---
but the tanks? holy shit

Heavy cyno can have a mass limit and a delay and stuff and cost extra stront and generate a shameful aura around your ship so you know your place.
---
and in what way would this make wormholes/eve more dangerous? if anything it makes it safer to farm...
---
you get content by rolling your static if nothing is going on in your chain. content doesnt suddenly appear if you cant roll the static....
---
if anything, this makes wormholes safer and supports steamrolling/n+1
---
If you play a multiplayer video game, the first thing you should expect is for there to be adjustments made to the meta.
---
You already should.

I had [posted about this almost a month ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ciboup/itt_we_give_ccp_wild_ideas_to_fuel_their_midlife/ev58ase/?context=3), about three weeks before CCP made the current covert cyno changes for JFs.  
---
I had thought that giving JFs and rorquals an industrial cyno would still remove rookie ships from the equation, but not give them the current skill cliff (and expenses) that exists for covert cynos and T2 hulls - assuming, of course, that is something that CCP wanted to do.  They did say that the cyno changes weren't meant to make logistics more difficult (lol).
---
I had thought that allow combating rorquals to hotdrop to industrial cynos (which could, in my theory, only be fitted to t1/t2 industrial ships) would still allow that type of gameplay.  But, EVE is EVE and players would definitely abuse the shit out of that.
---
I'll be curious to see if this goes through, and what, if any, restrictions the cyno will have to hulls.  I was at the acceptance stage of the upcoming cyno changes and was actually looking forward to having a lot of bad JF pilots be wiped off the boards due to lack of cyno pilots.
---
This guy just needs podex
---
First they came for low sec, and I did not speak out‚Äî
---
     Because I did not use low sec.
---
Then they came for the Null sec, and I did not speak out‚Äî
---
     Because I did not use Null sec.
---
Then they came for the local, and I did not speak out‚Äî
---
     Because I did not need local.
---
Then they came for me‚Äîand there was no one left to speak for me.
---
It's not *that* terrible, takes about 5 minutes.
---
I hate agreeing with you, but you're right.
---
So devs are feeding the market with items out of thin air again? Just like they did with SomerBlink.
---
These probably wont have a high sp ship req, letting them be used for memorials too.
---
It's ok bby, even a broken shitposter is right twice a year.
---
I just want mine to die honorably so I can quit the game
---
Like it or not, the days when people can just sit in front of the computer for 12 hours doing repetitive stuff are over. Most of EVE players have very stressful real life responsibilities, and log in EVE for relaxation.
---
Every recent trend --- the hype for blackout, the cyno changes, and the experimental zkill blackout --- are just pushing for the game to be "harder". Or in other words, more difficult to settle down because of the reduced safety, and had to be vigilant at all times to... Do the most mundane PVE I've seen in all the MMOs. Champions of those changes say they will motivate people to fight and it's easier to get into fights because of that, but at the expense of making people more stressful when they *don't* want to fight.
---
It shouldn't come across as a surprise that some people, myself included, just chose to stop playing. I quite like roaming or joining a fleet to kill shit, but I can't afford to spend many hours trying to find something every day. If I am playing and I only have an hour or so, I would probably rat a bit while chatting with my friends --- or play other games. And those sessions constitute the majority of my EVE game time. Now that this experience is made worse, what should I do? Of course, play other games.
---
The core of EVE's slow decline and stagnation is not just because mechanics and wealth accumulation --- it had been shown, repeatedly, that you can beat a group of you have enough support for your war, regardless of how many Titans and how fortified the enemy space is. It's just that the population in general lost the appetite for war, because "we don't have time for it". For EVE to thrive, unfortunately both PVE and PVP have to become much faster paced (the latter will be fine if we can reduce tidi), or it will continue to lose players.
---
With the gird size expansion it is MUCH easier than it used to be.
---
for what the OP is trying to do he def doesnt need combat probes. but a quick correction, combat probes and core probes have the same sensor strength, and scan things with the same speed. ( unless using RSS, since there isnt a combat equivalent)
---
All I have to say is we better be able to jump into Cyno Jammed systems with it because that was literally the only light at the end of this cyno alt training hell hole y'all created.
---
Still need something so I can buy a cap next door to my staging and jump it to my staging without making my entire corp form for a moveop to protect the cyno
---
^^no ^^I'm ^^not ^^gating ^^it
---
Does that mean more or less players?
---
I see wut you did thurrrr
---
Thanks! Great event, i loved it &lt;3
---
sometimes you make sense, but the snark gets in the way. I'm trying hard to overlook the snark, and today it worked.
---
We don't like following other people's rules for the most part.
---
As for myself, but probably my corpmates will agree, I don't care for empire building, sov mechanics, participation requirements (all except PH have it), massive fleets where you anchor and press F1 when told, doing OPs where you don't have a clue what objective you are after and pretty much all that is required to be a part of a nullblock. Knowing who you fly with and knowing that whatever you do actually matters (as opposed to being Linemember#26367) is also a big part of it.
---
I've been in 1 of these after playing for like 5 years
---
Some people have played longer, and made it into two or even three!
---
that would be a very efficient way to completely kill off a large amount of PvP and make the EVE universe a lot less interesting
---
surely CCP is not that stupid, right?
---
Sounds like you need a QA department
---
but hat means more training into covops cynos and the ships that can use them. are JF pilots just going to absorb the new cost and deal with it or is it not really affecting them?
---
You know, they make a lot of good decaf coffees these days...
---
Remove their ability to dock and put storage/building capacity limits on citadels.
---
"Then what's the point of a keepstar???"
---
Delete keepstars then, see if I care. I didn't really come to null until just after the introduction of citadels, and even then it was starkly obvious it changed the landscape of that area enormously, into something far safer than it used to be. Goons was EVE on easy mode. As long as you watched local and equipped a cyno, you were free to rack up 30million-isk ticks day after day after day in complete safety. Hisec mining was more dangerous.
---
I certainly don't begrudge Goons the fruits of organizing so well, but CCP provided too many OP tools for taming the wild space. The end result was capitals and supers (including rorquals) becoming almost a line-member requirement, when they were supposed to be the king pieces in mixed fleets.
---
be more tolerant, zombie brains tend to leak and thus work much slower ...
---
good to know eve is matching the stock market
---
Warp scram fitted T1 Frig, and we can finish our hotpockets
---
I can double your ISK!
---
I'm afreight of this change
---
Please dont be true.
---
Titans are usually the *reason* there's nothing to do, since they auto hardcounter everything except blops &amp; invasions by your own titan fleet.
---
Lol I‚Äôm training 16 cyno alts to cyno 5 with  mtcs , at least we will save ozone üòâ
---
I was part of the QA team lol.
---
Man, I almost read: "Defunct Game"
---
This is CCP cleaning up irrelevant attributes from their tables.  Nothing is changing.
---
https://i.imgur.com/IfB15f4.png

Well. . . . at least the Fail part of your name tries to warn us before we read this I guess :S
---
Also IMPROVE FPS while scanning 50+ results please. The scanner window lags the game significantly when scanning fleets.
---
The one that are not mid-way from three planets should take quite a bit more than 5minutes. And the one aligned with a gone wormhole.. Well you have to be lucky
---
How the fuck is putting a hull on a bunch of moderate SP characters "easy" compared to just having a stack of 10 titans sitting in a Sotiyo/Keepstar?
---
It's a clean up.
---
I remember something about a dev giving a group of players ships and just replacing them as needed.
---
Adapt.
---
very cool
---
As I said before and got downvoted for (like I give a shite) pissing off customers is neither a way to retain customers or attract new customers.
---
For instance. I enjoyed my VNI NON botting NON afk. I don't enjoy my VNI as much any more. 
---
I personally know a guy with about 4 accounts who quit about 4 years ago after they sequentially nerfed of his favorite toys to the point they weren't fun anymore. Don't feel like doing the math but keep in mind most of that 4 years there was no alpha so it was Pay or Die(account goes dormant). So that's 4 years times 12 months times 4 accounts times whatever the account cost would have been over the years.
---
CCP is a business run by gamers who listen to other gamers, who I have observed might know plenty about gaming whilst knowing shite about business, rather than a business which has a game and run by business people.
---
This might be single handedly the worst change in the history of changes , maybe ever.
---
covops is cyno 5 and frigate 5 I think? I'm not sure but that has to be less than 1-2M SP. They are always useful anyway.
---
If you do have a JF, maybe you can afford the cost, or are you flying a ship you can't replace?
---
I only shoot signal cartel if they are taking my relic and data site....

If I see them in space I typically wave

In before the lazy masses don't understand this post to be a joke.

If we remove titans, what wars would magically start?

"Freight Cynosural Field are specifically designed to support Jump Freighters"

NO WAY REALLY

Outstanding!

Just what i know.
---
 I have characters that camp some system for pvp in null / low. (log in -&gt; undock -&gt; Dscan -&gt; pvp -&gt; dock -&gt; log off) I call it my system because i haunt it for more than 1 years.
---
One of my system was around 50 co each day before BO : yesterday it was 7
---
One of my system was arnoud 25 co each day before BO : yesterday it was 4
---
One of my systen was around 15 co each day, yesterday i was alone.
---
I didnt log other characters in other system, just log off and go do naughty stuff with my wife üòÉ . All of this system are low sec and not null. I didnt log characters in null yesterday because i was angry to have nobody to kill in the 3 first system, but yes in null it has dropped more. 
---
Ok we lost some bot that is good, but we lost also **a lot of real player.**
---
Eve winner there, does the ear method still work with delayed local?(cloaky alt account near the gate/hole with sound at max set only to the passage sound effect ?)
---
I do use the double clicking, but as I said it doesn't always register. I also have a crappy mouse and would like to not be forced to double click 60 times in a row.
---
I also use the mousewheel, I tried to bind a keyboard shortcut but if you try to move the probes and at the same time increase/reduce scan range, it can bug out a bit.
---
No more than any of their other recent changes. HTFU holers!
---
Sucks to be those botting RMT account owners who have no reason to log on for real money anymore.  I hope they get a good job in the real world ASAP to make up for that lost income stream.
---
Meanwhile low sec FW is having good fights every day just like before.  Log off reddit and come out to join us.

BoB mk3 with a grand total of one corp from BoB and the only one who joined after all the T20 stuff happened at that. Right.
---
Hilmar is a wormholer. He has been stuck there for 12 years or so, can't find his way out. This is just a means for him to get back to Jita.
---
what do you mean?
---
Rolling a WH is almost exclusively a PvP thing though, it also keeps fleet sizes smaller by limiting the amount of ships you can bring through.
---
Criting a WH is what crabs do, that means they don't roll the hole all the way.
---
So unlike "removing local" who fat crabs and bots actually wrote scripts for so they could automatically run and dock up. 
---
This change changes the actual PvP meta. So it's a small gang PvP nerf.
---
IDK maybe they want to nerf PvP, it's certainly a different direction then what the have been doing lately.
---
Sorry: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDL9VxLqdvw

Ya this makes sense. Goes to show a game can be ran into the ground in many different ways

Suddenly I long for Metropolis region, haven't really been there since 2002.

I had to unsub because of RL about a day or two before the blackout. I so wish I was playing now. The blackout looks awesome.
---
Wait what ? so i'm training my alt into covert cyno for nothing atm ?
---
Link or didn't happen
---
If they remove rolling I guess we all need to head to lowsec lol
---
Some support skills only give you a 2% bonus or so per level, some give 5%, so some are worth it in my opinion.
---
&gt; Heavy cyno can ... generate a shameful aura around your ship so you know your place.

Hahaha nice, take your upvote XD

What the actual fuck??

Third time I've posted this, but remember that this includes 12 days of non-blackout nullsec. That being said, I'm fairly confident that this demonstrates just who pulls out ahead in a no-local scenario.
---
No, the point is they should have only slightly more DPS than a Dreadnought when in siege mode. Just like a Dreadnought with a Doomsday device.
---
Sorry, newbie here.  What is WH roll and this change means?
---
Introduce something bigger.
---
Titans were once borderline useless and really just for prestige and egos.
---
I‚Äôm still waiting for the day Eve introduces a ship that has 200 guns that 10 different people could control and 1 person pilot.
---
Sounds like an opportunity.
---
good riddance anyway
---
This is terrible gameplay and logic.
---
PVP entities will adapt by quitting or moving to LS. Krabs will be safer than ever because there will be no more PVP entities left in wh space.
---
Thanks for the explanation - that actually makes sense!
---
Oh yeah.. thats a very serious look.. he actually has destain for the whole titan issue.
---
Hole rolling should be possible but it shouldn't spawn you another hole. 
---
It's stupid that someone can roll a hole endlessly until they find a system near their target which they know won't have scanned down this new hole in the last 3 minutes.
---
So this why so many Manticore EGO skins suddenly showed up to undercut my PLEX bought skin. Fuck you CCP! You fucking assholes.
---
Must be becuase of all the murder he committed just to try to reach a pc for Eve Online
---
oh the wormholers are suddenly upset about hilmar crashing in kool-aid man style with terrible ideas shouting ~chaos!!!!~ when its a meeting on wormholes
---
how odd
---
[Nice.](https://i.imgur.com/Ec84fGa.png)
---
Iron Crown is an alliance tho...
---
You use specifically fit battleships to reduce the remaining mass of a specific Wormhole until it collapses resulting in a new Wormhole. This is called rolling the hole. There are more specific details and ship types based on the size of the Wormhole bit that's the basic of it.
---
I love how sometimes it takes me 4+ tries to move the probes because the hitbox is so sucky.
---
&gt; Part of our work this month was the disassembly of an entire 250+ member corporation that was pretty much entirely comprised of botters.
---
&gt; Some members of the community may be aware of the corporation ‚ÄúIron Crown‚Äù (who ironically had the ticker I.S.K.). They were discussed extensively on both /r/eve and the official forums recently, and ironically one of their hulls was killed during the most recent Whack-A-Bot event in Yulai on Monday.
---
&gt; This corporation was levelled and its entire roster was permabanned in action this month that saw the shutdown of another botting ring in EVE Online.  
---
Lol fuck Iron Crown
---
Is your argument here that people spotting a recon would prepare them for a cyno post-patch? If not it's arguably one of the less noticable options as the person sitting on the gate would have to be very distracted not to see even an interceptor using the gate. At least a recon has the option of avoiding notice once it's in.
---
The bad direction being? I can't see it.
---
Thats the difference between old style players and past citadel Goons.
---
We have 12 Chars overall, but all have cyno5 while they have 12 Accounts at leats but all injectors went into more Rorqual Alts and not into Cynos ....
---
One titan is not a fleet... lol
---
like man idk specifically but you could ask the same question in the era of aoe remote DDs or spider tanked supercarriers
---
its not like there'll immediately be tons of awesome fights tomorrow but titans are bad for content and we should change them to be less bad for content
---
(Also it isn't just "which war" but "would that war have many real fights vs. just pacing in circles for 3 months eyeing each other up before 1 servercrash fight/one side decides they'd lose the fight so they leave without showing up"; the goon "invasion" of NC's vale or whatever space, where they just unanchored everything and walked away, is pretty symptomatic of what titans do to the meta. There wasn't any reason to bother staying to even try and fight gsf because goons have more titans, and there isn't a counter to that. In a more dread/carrier-focused meta you might have a chance to win a fight outnumbered, or at least losing isn't an unmitigated catastrophe the way welping a titan fleet is. Yes, I know that goons have more dreads too, but you can try position/fitting/fleetcomp gimmicks, which you can't with titans. And if you try and lose, you don't permanently cripple your alliance, which is a big factor for alliance leaders determining whether to put up a fight versus a superior opponent.)
---
The POS thing is a shipyard and the ships in the arms are in stages of being built...
---
This picture is caused by many design mistakes what CCP has done over the couple of years. Starting from injectors (what made getting into titan super easy) to over all ability to even make one. Same time Eve is not the game it was 2008 when you saw the titan and almost shat yourself, because you know your screen would go white in a second and you will die. Eve is old game and we never get back what it used to was. CCP at this point need to accept that Titans are no more the baddest and meanest endgame killing machines and just bring something bigger and meaner capital into the game. And finally not able to inject into it or the cycle repeats again.
---
"Sleeper components" are from wormholes only, right? They amount to a total of 12t isk while nullsec bounties and overseer effects add up to roughly 30t. Is there really a ratio of 3 nullsec-people for every wormholer?
---
&gt; Hole rolling should be possible but it shouldn't spawn you another hole. 
---
how to make wh farming almost 100% safe 101

Destruction line? Remains constant, no changes.

Enjoy the Blackout? When no one is left to kill.....

*nervously checks my iron crown spy*
---
nerfs for thee but not for me
---
I can help with that
---
Well removing the ability to roll your static means you will be stick with a Period basis hole for 16 hours with nothing to do but log off.
---
Or you could just Krab because people cant roll into you anymore. WH chains will be static, just like NS gates. You put a scout on it and go to town.
---
This change nerfs PVP and buffs krabs.
---
The man's got a point, unfortunately. That was how I got interested in EVE: hearing on Kotaku about some bigass fight that destroyed multiple years' worth of ISK in the matter of a few hours.
---
perhaps you are just upset about the chaos and your sensible analysis is actually tears??????????????
---
That...they are changing for wormhole space apparently. The sound for wormhole activation got removed on the test server.
---
Theres a public beacon in J-GAMP you should visit
---
This. Removing rolling only helps krabs. There is already a delay for when the K162 side appears if no one activates the new hole...
---
I‚Äôve used my Titans to make an actual difference in a fight once in the 7 years I have owned it.
---
I missed every actual major Titan fight over the past few years due to time zones, work, or RL deployments. I cannot even begin to count the number of blue ball major hype situations.
---
Agree. This is a bad idea unless the goal is to make krabs safer
---
+ injectors.  If the purpose is to help new players catch up, letting people inject into titans and rorquals is only going to net benefit experienced players with billions sitting around, because for every one injector the new player buys to 'catch up' the vet buys 5 and just pulls further ahead.
---
It's a fitting rewriting of a famous quote. What needs to be warned about that.
---
CHAOS!
---
Such as? Shooting defenseless miners isnt fun. Bumpingission runners isnt fun.
---
no this is actually distinctly different than reducing the ability of big blobs to drop 50 titans on frigate gangs
---
This would (probably) create an environment that was much worse for hunters, and if it removed mass limits, much *better* for big blobs who want to move 400 fat dudes through a wormhole.
---
But that would make PVE safer while PVP harder tho, thats not what any active wormhole group wants.CCP said themselves they want to make EvE more dangerous, your suggestion would havce the opposite effect
---
Insert Comical Ali Pic: There never were any Bots in Omist, not in KWG and not in AoM and we just could not defend against them throwing hundreds of Billions on us ....
---
Tell that to the Asian gay journalist who got beat so bad that he got a brain bleed. 
---
Seriously, if you are a defender of Antifa, you are a cunt. Now downvote me you cunts. Poor that salt.
---
Good
---
awesome!!!
---
Every wormhole has a limited number of 1 - the maximum amount of mass in ship that can jump through that wh and 2 - the number of mass of this wormhole. When the wh mass reached to 0 wh collapsed. WH roll is the process to collapse the wormhole, from what I know it based on each wormhole has static wormhole(s) - if static wh collapsed another wh with the same characteristic (HS,LS,NS,c1-6...) will appeared. If they found bad wh (cannot farm or lead to enemy wh...), they use ships to reduce the mass to 0 and collapse the wh so the new static will appeared, this process is done multiple time until they find what they need (good wh to farm or wh lead to target's system or they just need to close all way lead to their wh so they can farm easily). 
---
Now wh has unlimited mass, means that they cannot roll. In bad case they cannot farm or gank 1-2 days until the wormhole collapsed and the new one appeared or the worst situation is enemies have a wormhole lead directly to their system, that's mean they can send as many Supercapital ships to your system to blown up your corp's citadel.
---
No it's not. Good null alliances do it all the time to get rid of them in their own space.
---
first they came for the krabs and you laughed, now they come for you and well.. really we don't care anymore, just embrace CHAOS! 
---
grr goons etc
---
Exactly what ive noticed too, something is weird. My thoughts was it was somehow related to triglavian invasion effect "bad coding" or smth like this.
---
Rage rolling does seem OP, but what you described is worse. Then you could roll everything, lock yourself in, and be totally safe from threats unless they were already in the hole when you rolled. That‚Äôs bad.
---
Sounds good to me.
---
Joecuster is a newbro who started the game in 2017 in delve, take it easy on him ok?
---
I had suggested too!
---
It can be if you pick challenging targets and are into harvesting salt. Just because it's not your idea of fun doesn't make it so for everyone.
---
Good thinking
---
Rorquals can act as Jump Hictors so no it would not be well balanced
---
if you have an AB + orbit around a can, he can still bump you?
---
Cant be bothered to argue with someone who has the IQ of a wet paper towel
---
Likely they will make it more random so its harder to roll
---
awesome, no increase of kills. well done, blackout work
---
It's 5 skins and useless vanity items. 0 in game impact. Calm yourself.
---
Why?
---
Elo was on Serenity in an alliance that with blatant RMT managed to completely destroy the economic meta of the server, leading to PLEX-Sub costing 20 Bil. ISK and most players leaving the server?
---
Can I have your stuff before you stop logging ?
---
It's even easier to hit "dock" on a keepstar.  And then get out and dock another.  And another.  And another....
---
There literally already are...NC and PH has multiple citadels in Auro. I know because I've docked at plenty of them while JFing.
---
Sounds like these idiots weren't docking at our Alliance/Corp citadels, which is pure stupid. There are plenty of reasons to die as a JF pilot...undocking in a system where we own citadels should never be one of them.
---
Imagine one wh lead from trade hubs like Jita to a system suitable for farming in 24-48 hours, I'm wonder how many KM we can see?
---
Are you sure about the strength? I get ~99 strength on my Proteus with core probes but only 60(could be less, can't remember) with combats. When I say it takes longer, I mean the overall scanning process goes slower because of the reduced scan strength. Doesn't really matter with easy to scan sigs, but the high level ones can take much longer or even become impossible to scan.
---
ccp releases collateral damage 2
---
This is a question best suited to our [No stupid questions thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ctx62l/weekly_reve_no_question_is_stupid_thread_august/)
---
up to now I'm still not know what type of wormhole that you can bring Dreads to? Because I've heard the story that someone bring Dread to one wh to farm and be caught by hunters.
---
Did he get banned?
---
Thanks Bro. Fly safe..whilst you can fly at all. o7
---
Look at that line drop like a rock for bounties on the "Top 8 Sinks and Faucets Over Time" almost down to incursion and agent mission payouts.
---
&gt; 10 different people could control and 1 person pilot.
---
I was about to laugh at you but this sounds like an unironically good way to make non-titan-owners not be useless in big fights. There's probably no sane way to implement it but it'd be a lot better than generic "t2 megatitan" power creep.
---
&gt;"Sleeper components" are from wormholes only, right? They amount to a total of 12t isk while nullsec bounties and overseer effects add up to roughly 30t. Is there really a ratio of 3 nullsec-people for every wormholer?                  
---
/u/ccp_rise stuff i guess you want to address
---
make it cost slightly more than a dread as well then. and let them dock in fortizars as well.
---
wormhole salt is a delicacy

U forgot mining. And you probably underestimate the number of people in wormholes/overestimate the number of people in nullsec. i'd say its like a 2:1 ratio of nullseccers to wormholers. They are just more spread across all the holes/corps because one wormhole cant sustain too many people. However the biggest group of players is still hiseccers i think.
---
Yea lol knowing CCP they just erased the wrong people XD
---
I'm just a reporting comments lol, I actually knew spiders can do that but imagine if they just all had wings like a dragonfly.....   
---
The real gem here is the Hilmar comment and the fun that will be had on certain Eve streams...
---
Seems like CCP hates their own game today.
---
Yet every large Titan battle.... they go running to the gaming news stations, puffing their chests at how amazing these fights are.
---
Such a same.... Guess I will end up winning eve this year.
---
ccp is shaking some things up so definitely a good time to get back into it if you're ok with staying in your basement for the next few years
---
I've never claimed that the 'few vs. the many' wasn't possible on TQ anymore. In fact the point of doctrines like pipebombing and videos like CC4 was to show that there is always a way to continue to fight the same odds, if you're willing pursue it. 
---
I should also point out that I don't hate the 'blob' unto itself. Although the battlefield romance of outnumbered combat in desperate odds has more resonance for me, I absolutely respect the man-management and dedication needed to run the biggest Nullsec groups. When not trying to put a knife in their throat, I remember spending time recording the majesty of their biggest fleet battles and the fruits of that still turn up regularly in Eve marketing materials today. 
---
As for Serenity; I was already good friends with Fulcrum while I was still playing every day on TQ. And sending me to help the side who later became the rebels would have been about as much use to them as sending General Melchett.
---
turn on your monitor
---
Calm down buddy.
---
No, they banned the corp `southern race club`, not the alliance `Iron Crown`.
---
most of the stuff you can do in a titan already requires fuel
---
So, an AB on an orca isn't going to move me anywhere near the speeds I would need to be going to avoid a MWD machariel.  The battleship is just plain going to outmaneuver me.  Like the guy said, take the bump, leave, or gank him.  Those are my only options.  Problem is, it would take 30 catalysts to headshot a battleship.
---
What - for watching the stream lol?
---
Recon/blops is not neccecarily the only two ship classes that will be able to light cynos. As mentioned in the post on the cyno changes this could change in the future and this, I believe, is in line with that thinking as the timer can be modified per ship class basis if the line of ship classes expands.
---
Time to turbokrab in WH space!
---
Get fucked wh boyos
---
:-)
---
make them travel like subcaps just far slower so that you can run circles around them,
---
The current eve stream is super interesting. We're watching CCP make burgers and coleslaw. Top notch content.
---
Do you by any chance write lyrics for metal bands?
---
Also check out [returning vets information station](https://www.reddit.com/r/eve/wiki/returningvets)
---
So nothing is changed i see hahah
---
Just in time for Classic!
---
They obviously had some big problems to fix, but they totally screwed over the little guy in the process. Null seems pretty dead right now.
---
We knew those numbers were dropping, but those trade balance numbers are telling. Lots getting dumped into the jita market.
---
So your playstyle is more important than theirs? Got it.
---
Then the only other option is not to allow hole rolling at all.
---
You get what yiu are given and that's it.
---
I'm convinced hilmar doesn't know what he's doing.
---
Yeah thats no good. A better method to do this would add 1 extra static to every wormhole instead.
---
Agreed - have move on to Talking in Stations a while ago, just popped on to hear that gem dropped..
---
Tbh I like it
---
I wish it had been done alongside a reworked dscan though
---
Turnaround is fair play. I can already hear people coming for the krab holes.
---
Hello enlightened one.  No, but I used some in my op...
---
Your post is gone, but try /r/evejobs if you are looking for a corp!
---
It is what got Nolak banned, was a friend of someone. OP got off easy.
---
I used to live in Metropolis.  Great place for industry, as there's subtle connections to all of the main trade hubs from there.
---
Going to Jita from Metropolis requires a few... unsavory jumps, though.  Dodixie is a bit more roundabout but requires zero lowsec jumps.
---
Id prefer just removing them
---
wouldnt this make wormholes more dangerous since you wouldn't be able to roll holes to stop people from getting into it?
---
Imagine being so fucking stupid that this is what you take from the reply.
---
Ratting bounty down to 29T/month in July from 48T/month in June, and that's probably counting the 12 days during which people probably ratted like mad before Blackout.
---
Branch went from 4.9 to 1.6
---
Cobalt Edge from 2.1 to 0.8
---
Dekelin from 2.7 to 1.2
---
Providence from .832 to .400
---
Most nullsec ratting values dropped to between 40 and 30% of their prior total.
---
However, Delve went from 1.5 to 4.7 due to the tribute campaign ending. This is still lower than April, where Delve had 8.4. This ~50% drop is lower than most other null regions.
---
As a new player who started playing a few days ago due to all of the changes I've been hearing about that have been made to Eve Online recently to breathe new life into this game by its genius CEO who has so much experience playing his own game with next-level knowledge of the day-to-day mechanics players use, I am glad to see him taking more steps to enhance the game and bring more new players to the game, like myself.
---
Hey guys, new rorqual mining!
---
You guys are mining alot, wow.
---
*Every month shows crazy mining amounts*
---
**2-3 years later** Alright so now there's capitals everywhere. This isn't what we intended.
---
Am little guy, stop speaking for me you twat. Little guys are fine.
---
I've looked into this. But I couldn't figure it out. How do?
---
&gt; like a 2:1 ratio of nullseccers to wormholers
---
On R/eve maybe. IIRC CCP stated something like 5-7% of the playerbase lived in K space.
---
Brb buying 2 blocks of butter
---
One for the popcorn, one for the wormhole guys to use because they gonna need something to grease up with
---
probably because how much material you need to build them.
---
you can easily burn through 40m ehp with 15 dreads in a single siege cycle.
---
T2 capitals when?
---
Imagine a day when edgelords perceive the height is wit in a reddit comment is to not begin with the word imagine.
---
Imagine.
---
Remember that both players and bots contribute there; all we know for sure is that there is a sudden drop. It could very well be the amount earned by bots broken by the local change.
---
Imagine the static hs from someone's corp lead directly to Jita
---
Yeah the botters and rmters benefit!
---
whers are the real krabs
---
 21k accounts banned for hacking/botting/RMT and people wonder why the PCU dipped a bit, I think this discussion has officially jumped the shark.
---
That depends on what you want to "prove".
---
Its essentially pay to win, if you cant afford another account and to keep a character not even playing the game most of the time then you are sol.  That is horrible gameplay.
---
Because if you understood the implication of unroll-able holes it would mean less chaos not more. It would be an odd change not a chaotic one. 
---
But sure - shout ‚Äúhaha you too‚Äù if it makes you feel less fragile.
---
Funny, back when it was summer the excuse was "it's summer, everyone's on vacation.  They'll be back when summer's over"
---
There's now a six month steady drop in the production galaxy-wise, which is probably not an indication of great health for the game.  Curious what kicked that off in February.
---
I think you wanted to say WH space
---
What if i told you there much better stress free and non open pvp games on the market?
---
and i quote "Titans are disposable" - CCP
---
I think being unable to inject anything over rank 8 skills would be worthwhile. Want Titan 5? Train it.
---
Dank 50 LO per cyno savings!
---
At work can someone give a TLDR
---
Fatfingered, J and K are right next to each other.
---
It was, now the two null areas I roam on the regular are almost completely empty.  My people are still around but the pickins are getting slimmer by the day.  Certain groups will only undock when they get 30+ 50+ or 200+ players and they just dont have the numbers to engage a solo hecate or a 5-8 man frig/dessie gang dropping bubbles and camping gates in their Capitol system.
---
Who are you fucking John Lennon?
---
YEEEEAAAS!
---
o7 i liked ur post
---
16?  Amateur.
---
Yeah, I agree with all that. My favorite time I'm eve was when I was in HS and could play 10 hours a day. But now I'm an adult with responsibilities and it's harder to fit in an hour or two of playtime and feel like I'm still doing anything worthwhile. I'd rather just boot up rimworld and work on my drug colony
---
Idk why this made me laugh
---
So do it
---
Yes i know but again i want the freight aspect of the rorqual not other.     
---
Like this can be rig letting you use this cyno but it removes all drone bonuses and increases the EWAR cost like NSA
---
Removing the ability to roll holes is one of the most unbelievably stupid suggestions ive ever heard in my life.
---
That sounds like a really bad idea.
---
who do you think is most likely to run around the galaxy and kill every keepstar? goons / test / ncpl / others? which one of those groups have already established capital dominance over the others? 
---
people should ask themself "how can goons fuck me over with this change?" instead of "how can i harass goons with this change?"
---
We're so obviously going to miss that one always docked super pilot and his 8 rorq pilots. So horrible
---
"Goonswarm Federation" hmmmmmm
---
Excellent point. For JFs, this was really the only improvement. It'll be curious to see what else CCP has in store now.
---
Asset safety should be disabled. Magically warping assets is just stupid.
---
What the hell is this and why has it been not even 2 weeks since CCP changed their mind?
---
WH are a bit sort of a cut off sub game tbh.  They are sort of forgotten about to everyone else.  We should make them more visible.
---
Nice.
---
Nope, when I go, my stuff will be in asset safety.
---
Fixing a design problem by designing another problem doesn't fix it.
---
I wish the scanning window camera would remember it's position upon closing/reopening the window.
---
Awww, are the glory days of wormholes over? Kinda sad I missed it ;-;
---
I'm *so tired* of hearing people virtue signal their concern for "the little guy." Either be a little guy and complain, or talk about your experience as a non-little guy.
---
Wheres my 5 dollars? -CCP
---
&gt; but they totally screwed over the little guy in the process
---
No they did not.
---
I think this is an AWFUL awful decision, and frankly would drive a stake through the already struggling wh community.
---
What a fucking braindead decision.
---
CCP_Rise can't possibly agree with this decision.
---
Listen, i'm all for drastic changes, even in wormhole space, this is not "salt" because stuff changed.
---
This is basically removing wormholes as a whole as a viable lifestyle.
---
Rolling is how you get content, how you refresh your chain, how you actually live in wormhole space!
---
This is one of the most ignorant, lack of understanding, lack of game knowledge, and lack of player style understanding i've ever seen.
---
Fucking braindead.
---
Jesus, the blackout single-handedly fixed ISK inflation.
---
Please keep forever CCP.
---
I say remove asset safety completely
---
CSM meeting is ahead of us, hopefully CCP will rethink also normal cyno.        
---
Those are bad changes.
---
I didn't ask either of those questions. Regardless of changes made, they will *always* benefit some group more than others. 
---
Just an extension of Malcanis' Law. 
---
Also, now that I think about it, it still doesn't remove indefinite risk free storage, it would bring back holder toons so the ships won't get dropped. 
---
Though, that's still a nice bottleneck to have back (as commented below). Yes, that also probably benefits goons more than others, since they have a lot of money floating about to make them.
---
yeah. unpopular thought but being able to scan and warp to wrecks would be sweeeeet.
---
Bots were a problem, but the solution should have been to make ratting more engaging, not completely eliminate it. CCP took the lazy way out.
---
So, if I understand it right: 1. no more rolling (connection will be up a certain amount of time) and 2. no more mass limits (supertits will be able to enter/exit)?
---
Welcome to Glassing the Hole Era.
---
It buffs a different aspect of PVP, because if your home hole rolls a short chain or directly into 1DQ you'll get quite a bit of PVP.
---
So you think the game is well balanced?
---
That's what I've heard from alliance-mates. I might pop in the day before my sub expires and take a solo jaunt.
---
Until CCP cancel asset safety.
---
Essentially wich rule i broke? lol  
---
I cant imagine how difficult will be to regroup all of my assets. Probably my corp and my alliance dont exist anymore lol
---
No big wars really kicking off. Gotta remember NC. Basically said scree it and picked up structures rather than fighting for them.
---
An even more badass and expensive capital? Absolutely not. 
---
Injectable or no, you can't make the barrier to entry time or resources. Eventually too many people will have put in the time and alliances will have figured out how to get the resources and this entire cycle will repeat. 
---
True balance means the constraint has to come from the ship's purpose not from time or resources. The bigger a ship gets, the less versatile it should be. Capitals and super capitals should be extremely specialized ships so bringing a fuckton of them to a fight doesn't mean an automatic win.
---
the stargate jump and pcu maps paint a pretty bleak picture of how many people there are playing this game
---
I would personally like to see titans be a bit more vulnerable. Right now, getting a titan dropped on your is a real good signal that it is time to leave. I would like to see it so that when a titan drops, you will want to bring in dreads to try to kill it.
---
The cyno changes and ehp nerf should both assist with that goal.
---
oh i fully remember nc. fleeing in terror.  but it seems odd that there would be such a steady decline completely independent of everything else that's going on; war, no war, etc
---
The local change didn't break the bots.
---
You actually want a certain level of inflation. What you don't want is deflation. Rise said they might have gone too far in the last TiS podcast.
---
The drop prior to blackout was due to Imperium deploying for the war against NC. and the north. As that was ending and winding down, ratting and mining numbers were shooting back up, but then Sleepers and Blackout happened.
---
I did complain about the blackout , still think highly delayed chat would be better but I am content with it.
---
$5 says he either doesn't play Eve anymore and is just an armchair bittervet and/or is a null mega block member.
---
21k accounts banned for botting/RMT/hacking and people wonder why the PCU dipped a bit.
---
Can anyone link to when this was in the stream?
---
so, there are those things called bubbles and scouts... if noone is able to roll into me ill just bubblefuck everything and put scouts on holes. ez
---
even with wh rolling, catching anyone farming with battleships is nearly impossible. because lol xd mjd. ccp should finally put scrams into sites and remove astra-farming...
---
I would like to point out that insurance payouts rose a little with the falloff of bounty payouts....
---
and with bounties, look at how many accounts were banned for botting this month in the MSR... 
---
&gt;777 account bans for botting related activities.
---
botting is bad M'kay
---
Yeah the game doesn't need a decent sized playerbase anyway
---
At this point, some version of the mechanic seems like a necessary evil. I would love to see it nerfed in some way.
---
 Either through not letting supers (or even caps) end up in asset safety. Because what fucking transport ship does interbus have that can move them? lol.
---
Or by increasing the amount of isk required to retrieve the items. (Potentially giving a chunk of that isk to the entity that dealt the most damage to the structure killed)
---
I am totally for removing voluntary asset safety, however. I've had my shit deadzoned and was forced to firesale several times during Ye Olde Outpost wars, it's never been detrimental and you can usually always get most of your isk back with a firesale.
---
Depends where it is, right between 2 planets, sure. Between 2 anoms that has despawned long ago, gg. Took me 3h once, plus 10km/s burn owernight.
---
Shit. I'd just learned to count to thirty...
---
The issue is 90 percent of NSS are shit :/
---
Well I guess there is still FW low for pews.
---
nice meme
---
No, the dangerous thing are the people who are rolling into you, not using your static.
---
it just means when we roll into your nullsec ratting pocket you wont be ratting that day.
---
C5 and c6 connections you can take caps through I believe
---
First off set a limit on how many skill points you can have before injectors can‚Äôt be applied (not nerfed) then get rid of alpha accounts. After that get rid of excavator drones. This will make building a Titan and flying one a huge endeavour as it should be.  But as far as their being a problem to address with having a shit ton of Titans on the field I don‚Äôt see the problem. I mean you do have a lot of guys that have been play for over 10 years. Me being one of them. Did you really think we were going to stay in dreads for another 10? The only reason that I finally got into a super and a Titan is because of the ability to park them into a keepstar. The only events that seem to bring new players to the game are when you have massive battles with supers on field. And the main thing ccp wants to prevent is massive battles with supers on field. Think of how awesome eve would be if we could have 20,000 player battles that last over 48hrs with zero tidi. Now that‚Äôs a god dam internet spaceship game.
---
a capital sized cyno would be a good thing i think, if you make the powergrid/CPU requirements on it worth 2-3 capital modules you would have to pick and choose what capital mods you fit on your ship. Like "yea i could fit a cyno and 1 rep or i could fit 3 reps" it could also work on supers/titans "i could fit a cyno and 1 plate or i could fit 2 plates and no cyno"
---
&gt; If somebody has an issue (wheter it's founded or not), invalidating how they feel is not a healthy behaviour. 
---
This is just outright wrong, in real life and in game...... This is not how things work.
---
Yes, and then NSS groups roll into the region anyway because they're actively rolling their static. With this you roll holes in your area and you're almost guaranteed to be safe for hours on end.
---
The numbers have been this high since the introduction of alpha clone state afaik
---
Thank you for the explanation, I start to understand why it could be so bad.
---
&gt; Then the only other option is not to allow hole rolling at all.
---
according to who?
---
and if those are the only two options ill gladly take non rollable holes
---
That‚Äôs not how increased performance works in Eve (except for capitals and Supercapitals). You usually get marginal performance increases for a vastly disproportionate cost increase.
---
If you cant manage to have multiple accounts you have no business flying caps imo
---
Thanks. It's still downloaded, so maybe some day I'll give it a second go. At the moment i have fire emlem 3 houses, xenonauts and rocket league, and no time to play any of them.
---
Alphas can run up to L3
---
True. But by then, I'm sure the 500 players left won't miss me. 
---
Eve is dead meme apply here? lol
---
hear me out hear me out. also before you downvote me i completed over 500 nullsec havens so i know what im talking about.
---
- remove citadels from wohrmoles
---
- remove thera (risk-free asset storage)
---
Or maybe people in large null alliances might have to fleet up with people in system rather than just snuggling a cyno mod *gasp*
---
add a nullsec static to all c5 whs
---
That's dumb I want neutron blaster implants not homo alien implants
---
Anyone have a clip? I watched most of it and didn't catch that.
---
Most of the little guy arguments are posted by f1 fucktards following the leader narative.
---
Don't judge me. I'm ok with being a casual space trucker
---
Why would they anchor them in a place that's so hard to reach? How would their 'clients' reach them?
---
**Random mass limits** is far different (and honestly, more "chaos-y") than **no mass limits**
---
The former adds spookiness and chaos to wormholes.  The later destroys the innate geography of wormholes.  The knock-on effects of no mass would have huge ripples across EVE as people would use it for unlimited travel.  I can't see them doing this but I could see the random-ness being cranked up.
---
"Titan proliferation is a problem that CCP needs to address."
---
Yet here you are being dumber
---
Deflation would be bad, however i think the current deflation is temporary due to the playerbase still being in the process of adapting. I'd still expect it to return to inflation within a month or two.
---
Makes you wonder what the total % of online users are bots. The number itself is not extraordinary though, if someone is going to spend time automating the game, they're going to spend time automating the registration process as well.
---
&gt;stress free
---
&gt;non open pvp
---
Why the fuck did you even start playing EVE Online then?
---
i wish, then we'd be free from his incessant and brainless shitposting
---
You're wrong.
---
 [https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99006884/stats/](https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99006884/stats/)  You gonna send me a check? July was our second most kills in a sub 300 alliance. Also we somehow manage to have money to keep PvPing. But yea, the little guy is hurt in both getting pvp and making money right?
---
It costs about 40B to inject a single titan sitter that can only be accessed by one person (or at most a very small handful).
---
It costs less than 200B to drop a Keepstar that can store an infinite number of titans in ship/corp hangars that can be accessed and flown by any number of people as necessary.
---
add a thera static to all wormholer
---
You dont *need* that titan or supercarrier though. It's not a requirement for the game.
---
But how will people connect to the chain to get in? Its way more dangerous to wh krabbing when a fleet is rolling and looking for targets. They're ready to rush in and get you. Random connections are far easier to scout and avoid getting caught out in a pve ship because it's random for potential hostiles, too.
---
lets do it. ultimate thunderdome
---
Isn't that the question to all the null krabs?
---
Exactly. I'm not saying the little guy is or isn't hurting. But it's painfully obvious how big of a top-down talking point this is from nulbloc leadership.
---
Well Hilmar doesn't have any other projects to drive into the ground and bankrupt, so he has to focus his efforts on Eve and run it into the ground.
---
correct, most of the time.
---
Well, on the other hand the point of a ship is to fly the ship, not to keep it in perfect pristine safety forever as a POS ornament. Coffin characters wouldn't be stuck forever in a boring state if they'd, you know, play the game and go shoot shit. Then they'd either have fun with it or lose it.
---
No, but its still gated content at that point behind essentially a paywall, that's fucking dumb.
---
REMOVE SUPER DOCKING
---
its such a massive buff to blob alliances that they can dock
---
This is the exact opposite of chaos though. if they want choas in whs make mass limits and lifespan of the whs random lol
---
Fuckem we don't need them, all they ever did was cause massive inflation, and now CCP has to meddle with taxes and shit in order to fix it.
---
The real problem for me is content generation. If you arn't finding anything... Roll the hole and keep looking for people to shoot. If we can't the chain can get long and stagnant
---
your pun in the freight cyno thread made me chuckle (‚ó°‚Äø‚ó°‚úø)
---
If someone is multiboxing Alphas they are breaking the EULA.  
---
If they were multiboxing to multibox more....   I am not sure, I am certainly OK with losing multi accounts if someone is still playing with the pew-pew alt.
---
If they are multiboxing in order to pay for Omega, they they are a lost player (perhaps, assuming they were pew pewing at all in some way) but to CCP they are not a lost paying customer.  At that point I guess these are CCP's decisions to make.
---
Not every situation calls for a cap so t hat is essentially saying they cant play unless specific things happen then...
---
sounds exactly like what the blackout did to null
---
It was what they intended to boost plex and injector cashflow so they could attract potential buyers for their company. Now that¬¥s done and they need to figure out a way to undo the damage they¬¥ve caused to the potential longevity of their only active source of income.
---
[Yes it did](https://www.eveonline.com/article/pwp24p/monthly-security-report-july-2019)
---
&gt; We‚Äôre happy to report that in terms of the blackout, it seems to have hit botters harder than we expected, and of course it‚Äôs made it a lot easier for legitimate pilots who‚Äôve taken up the sport of bot hunting to get out there and surprise these scumbags with direct attacks on their infrastructure.
---
the strength is at the minimum probe scan size. because the minimum size of combat probes is 0.5au double that of core scanner probes it shows half but the only really comes into effect if you would need that 0.25 window to scan something down.
---
Hm I wasn‚Äôt aware they eliminated ratting. Don‚Äôt see it in any patch notes anywhere
---
Sweet suggestebuddys
---
So not a huge return and not as easy to bot?  ( I assume you also need pullers, and maybe to loot/salvage to get the return)?
---
This would mean a much lower economic impact per bot, yes?
---
What do you mean, spend time automating?
---
Since chains would be constantly mapped and only small changes occur during a given time it's a lot safer to just krab with scouts. The krabs will always find a way, but this would seriously hamper the majority of wormhole corps doing any sort of pvp, most likely to the point of them disbanding for a good chunk of them. 
---
There are groups like Dead Terrorists, Waffles, Tuskers, Goryn Clade, Kronos Ritual etc that live in a wormhole with a null static just to get to roll to different areas of null to get consistent pvp content. Even some NPSI groups like Bombers Bar work very much like this and it would effectively screw them over pretty hard.
---
That‚Äôs worth a try. 
---
I‚Äôd also be interested in seeing the effect of having scrams act as targeted cyno inhibs.
---
I assume it's a bit sleepy still, but less so than Molden Heath, and safer than Amamake üòã
---
Titans still have to be built. Multiboxing and Rorquals, especially the combination of both, made this possible.
---
Exactly.
---
The only way to balance a ship is by actually balancing the ship.
---
Caps (and in particular super caps) need to have defined roles and lower EHP. Dreads should have a specific role - maybe they're Titan blappers. Maybe Titans blap supers. Maybe supers blap other caps. Maybe carriers blap Dreads and battleships. It has to be rock papper scissors and there needs to be room for subcaps.
---
"Bring bigger ships and more of them" is shit gameplay.
---
Not if you use more then one computer. :D
---
Everyone knows they are using VM...
---
Yep. We could always afford to build way more than we could actually find pilots for.
---
oof, he was talking about the dude you replied to
---
An automated process to register new accounts, create characters, move them into location etc.
---
Happy to see this MSR
---
Molden Heath is/was the main halfway point for many JF's.  There's a reason why there's a booming ice market in that system.
---
ya but make the hole last 2 weeks so we can bash your structures
---
But it will be a lot of content generation ... like 100 supers coming to ur hole and pew pew ur house.
---
You would almost certainly kill the game with such a change. Casual players don't want to take a week-long break and come back to find they lost everything.
---
It would be a really fucking stupid change to make when the daily log in counts are already dropping quite a bit.
---
Remove all capital ships.  
---
Job done.
---
Why do you think a player who plays in LS would leave?  What were they doing in LS?  ( I presume you know some since there would be evidence in the KB's and dscan).
---
If you want to just kill things in your hour a day head to low sec. The content is there it's just that you guys aren't taking the initiative. You want the content to come to you but that's not how a player vs player game should work.
---
Who cares?

Holy shit. If that‚Äôs true then I have to give props to the security team. But then I wonder how many of those accounts were alphas, and immediately replaced.
---
All of the proposed changes to local and cynos are good. They're not nearly severe enough IMHO but they're good. They seem to be on a roll so why not, let them shake WHs up too.
---
Bless you!
---
Thanks fam. Good thing I dont use a KS then
---
Looks like the US stock market right now
---
if you want to bash 100 astras and athanors be my guest
---
Too clunky to implement that, I imagine. I'm not aware of a ship's behavior changing when jumping to a cyno. Rorqs while they do serve as cheap Jump Freighters were never meant for that role. Afraid you're gonna have to burn hard cynos for that or buy a JF.
---
Do you have the actual quote and details of what they want to implement or are you just getting buttmad about a reddit shitpost?
---
Bro you're posting cringe. You're gonna lose subscriber.
---
I was talking to you, saying that they guy pearl clutching about "the little guy" you replied to probably wasn't a little guy. I was in agreement with you.
---
The fact that non-titan owners are useless in a big fight is a huge problem.
---
Doubling down by making an even bigger "must have" ship is not the answer.
---
Hah... We can't even build supers since there isn't sov... If that actually is the case there really isn't much reason to live in wh space when that larger powers can just steamroll. I would have to move out. Although probably not quit. I'm not going to just give up on the chaos era like so many others.
---
Seems like the op struck a few nerves.
---
Wow, you are dense. The bots still worked, they just couldn't see local to warp to safety. They didn't just stop working.
---
NS static to " not one of the fun 3 ns regions" =  log off for 24
---
Give C6s a null static. Other even number wormhole classes have dual static (read c2 and c4), this would make wormholes even more active and bigger groups would have something to fight over since C6s are fairly limited in numbers compared to C5s which is the usual goto wormhole for big groups. Imagine everyone fighting over the given amount of C6-C6/NS wormholes and capital rolling NS for content.
---
Yes
---
The game is dead since 2003.
---
U R a gudposter
---
&gt;Yes, that also probably benefits goons more than others
---
not really, it only affects groups with keepstars by definition. and relevant supercap groups in recent memory (skillu, snuff, pl) all force people to have dedicated characters for supers/titans
---
You, uh, do realize people roll for pvp, right? 
---
Oh, your wh goes to wormhole B, which hoes to wh C, which actually links to wh A (which does happen)
---
Better logoff for 24h until the hole eols out and you try again for the daily pvp?
---
I'd definitely recommend getting ship skills to 5 for the ships you fly often. An extra 4% in resists or 5% damage can make a big difference. I get most things to 5 if they're relevant to my general day to day activities.
---
He‚Äôs definitely some kind of bitter vet, but formally from the star citizen alpha for several years. Very good hotas pilot but a massive whiner who used to constantly stir up conflict.
---
CFC sure cares about "the little guy" when their SOP is to drop 6 Supers on a 30 man Drake fleet.
---
They did that for Runescape. Tutorial bots right to whatever task they wanted
---
Yeah, let's wait for the actual announcement.
---
Over the course of 8 months. Take a look at the monthly number and see it is far less.
---
I would also point out that a dead previously NPC region like Syndicate is now #4 in the game for mining, above even Fountain. This would suggest people have swapped to moon mining as Athanors are a very good defense for your mining ships.
---
I don't think these numbers will last. The blackout is basically just a new meta. Once groups find a way to counter it, the numbers will climb right back up (assuming the game doesn't die from anymore upcoming changes, anyway).
---
They dropped primarily because most players decided to be cautious in light of a recent change to a core gameplay mechanic, not because said change makes it impossible to keep going at the previous numbers.
---
I think you would have to change the mechanics of them. Right now they are super aggressive and so if they did a mining fleet they would just  call reinforcements as soon as you warp in. No shooting by the player necessary. This would be very interesting and a way to mess with miners.
---
&gt; The fact that you can store a titan in perfect asset security is something we have to address (and presumable change).
---
CANNOT DISAGREE MORE.
---
I'm totally fine losing a titan in combat.  I made a decision to defend my assets, and it turned out to be the wrong decision.  That's fine, it's the nature of eve.  My asshole will pucker like someone shoved a warhead candy up there, but it will have happened because of the decision I made.  
---
I log in and find my titan was kill by a griefer corp while I slept?  Ragequit.  Instaragequit.
---
What did they actually say?
---
Multi-crew T2 Titans would be amazing.
---
But what am I supposed to do with this pitchfork and tar then?
---
No. If they touchit, they will fuck it. Never touch working system.
---
Or at very least make any new change optional.
---
Ev certs have been dead for a while browsers haven't supported it in about a year now even if you can still buy them.  There's no distinction in your browser to differentiate (or if there is, you should probably update your browser.)   Major top alexa sites (see stackoverflow) use letsencrypt just fine for their properties.  Identity Validation is what is used for the current classes of certs.  This is old news, if you're in this business, read up on the latest.
---
wtf am i even reading?
---
Elaborate please. 
---
Because from a logistic and strategic viewpoint it appears to be strictly better to not have your cap pilot be your main
---
For anybody here who wants whatever was said, https://www.twitch.tv/videos/471131984?t=02h21m11s
---
Sorry it's not the end of the world
---
I don't think numbers will ever hit previous numbers without a rollback or some buff to ratting safety/isk/hour. Then again that's not necessarily a bad thing.
---
Those suffering from a smoothness of brain really outed themselves on this one!
---
see you back here when you tire of pressing 1121123112112311211231121123, i love you and look forward to your return!! ^-^
---
i would like to add that providence also has more mining in july than in june.
---
Nope lol
---
Just trying to crush wormhole rolling is dumb
---
Have you ever lived in null? Im honestly curious because you have the impression that null is some super safe paradise. You can go on zkill and 9 out of the top ten most dangerous systems are nullsec systems. 90% of all the major battles that have happened in the last year have all been in nullsec. All these supers and titans and rorquals are dying in nullsec. But now im being forced to move into wormhole space by ccp. If i wanted to do that i would have moved back into my farming c6, this is were the real carebears and spod brains reside. But I wanted a place not only where I could PVP but also PVE without taking extreme means to do either or. There was always content when i logged in, always something to do. And I had the choice to participate or the choice not to and make some isk. Now that choice is being stripped from me because now I can do everything right and still lose big. Im being forced to fight or die. I choose death. I've lived through the greatest moments of this game and im content with those memories. But I will NOT condone you and your like destroying this game and I will not support CCP when this goes live.
---
Yeah we don't need players.
---
[streamable](https://streamable.com/bzk2x) for posterity purposes
---
Remove citadels... So no permanent residence? Like when the citadel dies everything drops so it can be a great way to make isk haha
---
&gt; This is basically removing wormholes as a whole as a viable lifestyle. 
---
In CCP eyes, WH were never an intended viable lifestyle, just go in, grab some loot, go back home. 8b/h is too much reward for the danger and effort involved.
---
Same, super umbrella was never an intended gameplay, too much ISK for the safety it provided.
---
So, in the Chaos Era, after the cyno nerfs (hitting ISK under umbrella) ... something was to be expected to nerf (hitting ISK in WH).
---
Well if it's random mass limits then you get to see how much risk WHers actually like.
---
Solution: Come out to null.
---
RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
wow dude, chaos is strong with this one xD
---
Some people cant afford multiple accounts and should not be paywalled out entirely from the larger ships.
---
Lol well when you put "he" when replying to what I say its not all too clear that you're actually referring to "he" the other guy
---
&gt; 8b/h is too much reward for the danger and effort involved.
---
No one is denying that, if they crushed cap escalations i'd be very much in favor of it.
---
Removing wormhole rolling is stupid as fuck.
---
&gt;something was to be expected to nerf (hitting ISK in WH).
---
Agreed, but that isn't what this change is about.
---
&gt;too much ISK for the safety it provided.
---
This makes it more safe.
---
The feature I really want is a key to center the probe formation on your mouse. Like, anything you can double click to center the scanner view on, also let us center the probe formation on. This would remove so much tedium from scanning.
---
They were often used as a haulers in nullsec not only as boosters.
---
&gt;But I personally think it‚Äôs a risk worth taking as long as they keep iterating changes based on their results. 
---
CCP says they do that.
---
CCP doesn't do that.
---
Also, when you "iterate" people into quitting, it's much, much harder to get them to start again.  So I think you're underestimating the risk.
---
I mean not really, you can always park it in a POS....
---
People managed it for many years prior to Citadel and they can manage again.
---
My assumption is they have sexual thoughts regarding what can only be described as; cartoons. Therefore are most likely dickless.  As in, they have no dicks.
---
I fear them not.
---
This was probably taken out of context.  Skills should be trained to level 5, however you should wait until you train other relevant skills to level 4 before doing so.  The benefit of each skill level is a linear increase but it is more like an exponential increase in time.
---
It‚Äôs init taking over the syndicate moons
---
How to make WHs effective for the Chaos Era:
---
- Increase the spawn rate of kspace to kspace WHs, especially in nullsec (from what I heard this was nerfed some time ago)
---
- Remove mass throughput limits of those types of holes only.
---
* citadels        
---
* rorqual mining        
---
* blackout     
---
* cyno changes     
---
* drifter boss farming with structures
---
what makes you think they deserve to be able to roll holes into anyones space
---
I doubt people meant nerf everything else when they asked for some love towards lowsec.
---
That sounds like a nice argument on paper, the reality is that you are barely able to use your cap effectively if you only have one account already
---
And you know this for every single bot in game how?
---
Yes.
---
Nullsec burning WH structures for loot
---
Yeah but:
---
1. You don't know what they are actually planning.
---
2. Devs don't really give a fuck about reddit outrage.
---
Those 2 actually make raging here and now kind of pointless.
---
Removing mass limits creates a series of other issues (hello capital move ops through wormholes just to name one) and actually removes a lot of risk related to WH PvP. Hillmar wants to create chaos so doing something like that doesn't really fit the theme. If they decide to do it however - I don't think there's anything we'll be able to do about it so why bother. Just live your life and wait for the announcement, you'll get mad and threaten to unsub then. Now it's pointless.
---
People are getting more organized in mining in non-Delve regions. Anathor fracks are being timed so that multiple fracks come out in one time block, which allows a large escorted mining fleet to hoover up large amount of ore in a short amount of time.
---
Time bring in the alpha accounts with praxes.
---
Already adapted.
---
&gt; No. Reward doesn't merely mean isk/hr. It includes many other factors:  
---
&gt;Afkability: Can you earn your money and yet attend a fleet?  
---
&gt;Scalability: Can you get more accounts and scale up your isk/hr?  
---
&gt;Sustainability: Can you farm as much money as you can if you kept farming 10+ hours every day?  
---
&gt;Accessibility: Can you merely join an alliance to access the farm, or will you need your own setup?  
---
&gt;Investment: How much prior investment do you need to start farming?  
---
&gt;Dedication: Do you need to dedicate your accounts to PvE to access the farming, or can you attend fleets?  
---
&gt;Ship Safety: Are people able to come interfere with your farming?  
---
&gt;Infrastructure Safety: What is the possibility of you losing the access to the infrastructure that enables your farm?  
---
&gt;All this taken into account, Rorqual mining in an umbrella alliance is the most rewarding activity by far.  
---
&gt;PS: I am not saying some of the above factors are not making it harder for Rorquals. For example 5b investment for 100m/hr return is quite high compared to other activities. But all of these bullet points taken together, Rorquals are the most rewarding.
---
Rorqual scalability is off the roof, mainly because of 40 accounts guys. But you know as well as me as this doesn't count for people that cannot afford it in the first place. Rorquals should have been modified long ago to prevent mass multiboxing. Multiboxing VNI's is a thing too, but unless you are god you will die alot during the blackout.
---
Despite that, wormhole are way more rewarding than nullsec, and Highsec incursions, while having a high entry cost, are also more profitable, not even talking about abysses. The only "winning" point of nullsec is infite respawn, which is made to accommodate large numbers of players. Reduced to one guy trying to make isk, nullsec is NOT profitable enough under current conditions. 
---
&gt; Capital engagement and travel is very much still possible. I have 7 dreadnought accounts that I regularly move. If anything, the non-mega empire people like me will lose more recons than anybody else, but we're not complaining. 
---
No competent supercapital FC will risk his fleet to jump on a recon while an enemy fleet is on grid, and warping on grid was and never will be an option.
---
&gt; I think the long term plan is there, and CCP is thinking sufficiently on these changes. They just aren't opening changes up to conversation too much, because null mega empire linemembers always dominate the majority of the conversation although you are actually not the majority in this game. That's where the new "talk less do more" attitude comes from. It's because linemembers like you dominate the talk as many of you are interested in the social aspect of this game, while hunters like me are typically less interested in talking and the social aspect of the game (except me which is why I ran for CSM). So we are just skipping a lot of one-sided talk. 
---
If the long term plan was there, it would have been implemented with all changes at the same time, because that's how you plan&amp;implement. Half-assed changes to gameplay were never going to be well-received and accepted.
---
When you're a game developer like CCP which has an in-game player electoral body to assist you in your work, you don't bypass them because "lol linemembers are too vocal". 
---
When you're a game developer, you don't deploy changes that piss of a big part of your playerbase without so much of a explanation ("eRA oF CHaoS" lol), especially when you're CCP and are known to never balance anything once it's live. I had the same discussion with falcon when he said he 
---
When you're a game developer, you actually have to care about your game and not reject the stagnation/abuse fault on players because you were fucking too lazy/not concerned enough to apply balance passes before the problem went live/went out of proportion.
---
How many times did we see post about how Rorquals would be when changes were announced ? How many post claiming Rorquals were fucking the economy/too scalable/unkillable after release ? How much time did it take CCP to actually act on it ?
---
Sorry, but I'm not sorry to not be able to trust CCP to have a long term plan to "balance things out" anymore unless it's set in stone, and even then I'll have my doubts.
---
MJD RAVENS IN EVERY HOLE!
---
Awww boohoo, WH carebears will not be able to close off their system for 2 hours while they mine and rat.
---
Alpha accounts in praxes.
---
Bud ... undock your titan if you are going away and logout in on keepstar undock ...........
---
Ah I didn't mean their cans, just cans in general where people have stashed stuff thinking surely nobody is autistic enough to get there, well joke's on them.
---
syndicate nr 4 on top mining??? 
---
wtf lives in syndicate :-)
---
I think you should step off reddit for a bit, friend. Reducing complicated and nuanced subjects to "witty", sarcastic, and oversimplified one liners can't be good for your long term intellectual health. You're impairing your ability to think deeply, and that's not a good thing.
---
We don't need players who aren't engaged with the game and who's activities only hurt the game (for example, AFK Rorqual multiboxers and AFK VNI/Carrier ratters who only have an inflationary effect on the economy). If a few supercarrier/Titan pilots leave as well, I won't cry about that, either.
---
what makes you think you should deserve to have such content on demand compared to other parts of space.  
---
there is always pvp just not always the type you want
---
CCP should have let everything run its course and just increase training difficulty of the caps and supers with a small penalty for existing supers.
---
THIS SOUNDS AMAZING! I APPROVE! I Look forward to visiting each and every one of you lucky wormholers soon‚Ñ¢.
---
Is it just me, or do these discussions on Titans sound remarkably like US politicians arguing about gun control?
---
I only ask because there's money to be made in East Texas if CCP figures it out - get a patent on gun control, then troll the government for royalties on the solution.
---
As a newbie I miss the SP :( now am just sorta exploring for Sansha stuff so I can buy skill injectors
---
It would be a great way to make a lot of pvp actually happen.. or are you saying that wormholers wouldn't want to pvp in their space when we come to visit?
---
If you can't afford to plex a second account you cant afford a super either. Your logic is retarded.
---
holes NEVER lead to jita
---
Time will come for those, no worries mate. This is CCP we're talking about here... ;)
---
Or it could mean you roll into Delve, Fountain, or Esoteria and end up with 1000 mouthbreathers in your hole flying MJD ravens.
---
Capital alts aren't players.
---
This fail bait is great. Most of this thread has been pretty metered discussion on the meaning, info gathering, and consequences the change could have. You are here still salty about huge balances to the PvP and difficulty of nullsec. Not only that but you are talking to people who adapt to new surroundings every day and will not be as hostile to a changing mechanic. Let alone threaten to or actually leave the game over it.
---
HTFU or move back to high sec.
---
i really appreciate ccp going out of their way to make me spend more time on other hobbies and activities, with my family or just outdoors  (‚úø‚ó†‚Äø‚ó†)
---
That counts as pvp. Which means wormholers should support this hands down, 100 % or their HTFU statements are bullshit.
---
We've adapted. Now your turn to adapt to the blackout.
---
That's my view as well. People keep reeing about removing asset safety. What if I want to go camping for a couple weeks? I come back and the supers that took me so long to get are just gone? At least in the past if I left it in a POS logged off it was there even if it was hell camped it was there.
---
Are the people reeing for it no lifers that are never away from the internet for any period of time? I get that asset safety is silly but it's here now, just completely ripping it away is nutty af.
---
Good point, there are many contributing factors.
---
Anyone thinking this is a good idea doesn't understand how wormholes work..
---
Well I don't think there's a single cap mod that's worth one or more faxes :P but yeah that could be a balance point or make the cyno mod hurt the capitals stats directly to reduce tics.
---
He might lose his Stratios to the Moa now without being able to kill the Moa with his Titan.
---
Let me bump it out of the pos next time then.
---
So.. you mean the pvp entities.. won't want to actually fight (pvp) in their home holes when people invade? That sounds like a bunch of nancy bullshit.
---
These exist, f135, f353 and f355 are all wormholes that lead to Thera. If you magically had a static f135 it would always go to Thera.
---
Its just one big failtrain of incompetence, and they plugged their ears going LALALALA CANT HEAR YOU for years and are now trying to bandaid the result.  About as shitty as one would expect, you can't bandaid that much fail.  Hilmtard hasn't realized that still.
---
Done. Alpha accounts in praxes. Your turn.
---
If you're sitting in it, it wouldn't go to asset safety anyway. No reason to undock them if the change was made. 
---
For active pilots that want to make sure their supers don't drop just use a holder, like Ye Olde POS days.
---
That is inconsistent with trig design.
---
Can we get a pic of the vitalshift skin? Looks like it'd be bad ass
---
ha
---
To add to this, extensively bluing entities to the point where more or less the entire server's might is concentrated under a single banner isn't something I see Elo doing.  What PIBC became personifies the worst fears of most content-loving folk on tranquility - the death of engagements between actually competitive entities. I understand that you (lord_maldoror) and fulcrum are friends. However, when you support an entity who's play-style is diametrically opposed to the "few vs many" mantra of RnK, _and_ who's managed to stagnate the server to the extent that it is necessary for pvp loving folk to abandon it, it's small wonder that your reputation in the eye's of people like Elo has taken a hit.
---
just people leaving the game because it became the boring fucking unilateral carebear and f1 pusher heaven CCP and the playerbase wanted it to be.
---
Undock and safe log
---
"Here's some PvE to replace the PvP were incapable of facilitating via balanced gameplay mechanics!" 
---
How bout fuckin no?
---
Or it means that they will indeed pump 500 battleships into your hole and accept your offer to friendly pvp.
---
Why bother if people can move a dozen supers into it
---
fleeing in terror... good one.
---
Blops is a fun and engaging gameplay.
---
This would be called the "bargaining" stage.
---
&gt;the fact you can store a titan, which is the size of a city, in perfect asset safety forever, and is never at risk, and the fact that is doesnt have any operating expenses, is a thing we need to address
---
FUCK YES
---
the hole will just get a bubble and a scout and its back to krabbing
---
There is nothing "deep" about your thoughts. There is nothing complicated about fewer players being bad for the game. What you need does not matter. CCP needs to turn a big enough profit or they will turn off the lights.
---
Im glad ccp is forcing a more diverse play style.
---
They should be called bullshit caches, as they are useless most of the time. 
---
you can't put a mobile depo inside them and if you're prepared enough to have md in cargo, you also have probes and launcher.
---
Without rolling j-space is just null except you have to scan your way through every system instead. If there is nothing for 20 jumps around you, you have to wait 16-24 hours for a new opportunity to find things, or wait for new chains to connect.
---
Initially, WH were not intended to live in, but a hit and run environment.
---
how is a "griefer" corp going to kill a keepstar while you're asleep? do you regularly sleep for 9 days straight?
---
also your titan wouldn't die if you were logged off in it, that's not how it works
---
Right now 40 keepstars have died. This number will only ever grow. If you weren't around for the player built stations they eventually were spammed so much that most regions were pretty close to fully saturated with stations. A similar thing will happen with this. 
---
Something could be done with with this idea. Something like systems with dead keepstars having a static to drifter holes for a year or something would be workable, but permanent wh to Thera would really quickly become really broken.
---
Doubtful
---
I guess you already forgot about the uproar from when CCP changed HICS.
---
i wonder how much this will fuck with my undocks and instadocks.
---
elite goons (init)
---
&gt; get rid of alpha accounts
---
How does this do anything to resolve the overabundance of Titans?
---
everyone runs when they know a neutral is there. why would this be different lol.
---
Wh's on suicide watch

I wanna live in Australia

How to Alienate Your Player Base by CCP ~~2015 2018~~ 2019 Edition
---
Whats limiting supers from entering isn't their mass, its simply not being allowed to use them. Despite the fact that nothing was said about mass at all this wouldn't change anyway.
---
wait, on graph it marks it at ~ 0.5T, while this https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/6wZj0T8uiaCWRQ2qxDbbLn/6f8d9fbd83ad879c374cbd2171291955/9a_sinksfaucets.png says 30T.
---
Nothing is certain until the dev blog, take these posts with a grain of salt.
---
kinda like removing atron cynos kills off the ability to catch and engage fleets
---
it's almost like ccp have no idea what the actual impact of their changes are, similar to the wormholers who have been spamming "HTFU nullbear!" while enjoying the most risk free isk printing in the game, followed by teleporting around the map killing big rock huffers in intense 1v40 situations
---
&gt;There is nothing complicated
---
Well thanks for proving my point.
---
And force super pilots to have an alt to fly other ships in the game? That sounds shitty just as much
---
&gt;Third time I've posted this, but remember that this includes 12 days of non-blackout nullsec. That being said, I'm fairly confident that this demonstrates just who pulls out ahead in a no-local scenario.
---
You posted reply this exactly 50 seconds after this post went up. Did you have the copy/pasta ready to go and thought the title said MER instead of MSR? Shaking my damn head...
---
&gt; if we completely remove the titan and supercarrier from even being useful except structure shooting, what is the escalation?
---
What is the escalation from the titan and supercarrier?
---
Hilmar seeing titans from a major block, freaks out ... are you serious? Like he suddenly realized Eve has titans? *shock*
---
Good. If null sec needs to be dangerous, so does wormholes. Being able to roll away pvp content you don't want is bull. If I cant roll or crit the gates to super rat making 300m an hour, Wormholers shouldn't be able to roll their connections to securely make 2 bill an hour krabbing with dreads.
---
1. Relaunch Eve, brand it Eve Classic or whatever
---
2. Never release anything developed post 2005
---
3. Everyone happy
---
Nice write up, thanks for posting
---
you sound salty
---
&gt;0 in game impact.
---
Except for the fact that they have market value.
---
I can type two sentences in fifty seconds. Can't anyone?
---
Still, yeah, I didn't even notice until you said something that this was the wrong thread. Whoops!
---
It's not the rule per se that brought me to this death, It happened because I made a serious misjudgement by assuming I was safe whilst there were indications I'm not
---
Wait until the dev blog before you take any of it seriously.
---
what i wanna know is - what happened for ccp to suddenly start making all these drastic changes? i mean, as opposed to doing them in the past 8-10 years or so.
---
A better change would be to make crit WHs die after 2-5 minutes. And all outbound connections auto opening after 2-5 minutes.
---
Right.  And in a "Month or two", when things haven't changed for the better, are you going to say "give it another month or two"?
---
Face it, these changes are BAD and the drops in players logging in, combined with a decreased MER (especially outside bigger blocs) is a bad combination
---
I‚Äôve only just started exploring null, I‚Äôm hardly a krab. I‚Äôve head about players targeting miners and haulers in economic warfare, and it sounded like the same reasoning to me.
---
Lol. I honestly didn't pay attention to it. I was flying one, was sad when it got needed but it was really overpowered haha. Frigates are actually an option now. Specifically assault frigs. Mind giving a quick explanation of the uproar?
---
People not logging in kills MMOs. But hey you keep posting how we don't need those players anyway..

except literally all the big whs groups have been asking ccp to make wh ratting more dangerous for years now. it was made safer with the introduction of citadels and the drifter. This literally makes wh ratting even safer. if your static is connected to a dead system you are good to go. leave a scout and bubble on it if you really want. you have to worry significantly less about someone rolling into you.
---
Should I put away the razor then?
---
Nice thanks man.
---
All of them
---
Keep it on hand
---
True. But as all things evolve the role changed. It's now the only space a citadel will just dump all your shit upon death and you still can't death clone into one. It's also not particularly hard to remove a group from a wh if they aren't moderately active so.
---
Even better, your hole's static goes to B, and B's static goes to your home. (Had that happen last week. Confused the hell out of our scout for a few minutes.)
---
The biggest issue currently is and always has been the DD module. Removing that would immediately make dreadbombs a million times more effective against Titan groups. DD always has and always will be a problematic and gamebreaking mechanic that makes balancing nearly impossible.
---
jesus christ that's like a compilation of ccpls posts on reddit. ccp are fucking retarded
---
They used to be the go to for hole rolling, but to get rid of Lurch HICS a byproduct was them no longer working for wormholers.
---
fun fact people dont like to fight 100 to 1. although maybe this will allow wh corps to get pretty big. 500 vs 500 might be fun
---
was the gate open for you to get out /
---
Best post on reddit this month
---
Because if this change were to happen, it would allow content to come to you.
---
Or just add the mooring they were talking about so people still don't have to tomb the character. Add an max that a Upwell Cancer Station can have moored and an upkeep to the moor.
---
JFC.  *Watch the video.*  They are talking about changing that.
---
I don't see how that has an effect on anything but ill answer your question none the less.
---
CCP made it this way to begin with, if they didn't think wormhole groups were supposed to operate with the random aspects of wormholes they would have fixed the issue that enabled people to anchor control towers in them like they originally intended.
---
Wormhole life is a lot harder and more tedious in a lot of ways, with the perks being better isk/hour pve sites and the ability to actively look for content in a large area by use of the wormhole mechanics. I feel this is a fair trade-off for the increased hassle and work
---
If CCP wants to nerf pve so be it, make even more wormholes spawn or something that would actually increase chances of pvp rather than nerf it. Taking away the pvp aspect of what makes wormholes attractive would just make it a giant krab party.
---
So what makes you think they don't deserve to do their bread and butter stuff which is hunting thru a NSS?
---
Aside from most of the magic 14, and skills that need level 5 for other skills (like cruiser 5 being needed for recon ships and weapons to 5 to get weapon specs) then yeah, training level 5 is often a waste of time as the diminishing returns just isn't beneficial, until you get to a point where you are set in what you are doing and have no other skills that will benefit you.
---
explain
---
Until they finally 86 POS :(
---
"rarely" is the qualifier there.
---
It is accurate, provided that we have a similar understanding of what makes it an exception.
---
Or limit the number of supers you can dock: Keepstars have three supercapital docks, so you should only be able to dock three at once. Or maybe limit the amount of supercapital docking space to a certain amount of m3.
---
&gt;People not logging in kills MMOs.
---
And people can stop logging in for a variety of reasons. One of those reasons, which affects every player, is inflation. Nerfing Rorquals or AFK Carrier ratting affects only a small group of players. However that small group of players has a huge negative effect on everyone else (including themselves, ironically!)
---
Like I said man. Stop reducing everything to some stupid one liner. It doesn't make you look clever, it makes you look ignorant and simple minded. Step off reddit for a bit. Maybe read some philosophy.
---
You realize how many dead WH systems there are? 
---
And then if you find someone the chances them undocking goes down if they know who you are. 
---
Then you're stuck with a garbo chain
---
Risk you take logging out for an extended period of time.
---
I wonder if the triglavian components got mixed in with sleeper components, or fall under "other"
---
This will definitely work in TIDI
---
Drops in players logging in? You mean to say drops in bots logging in.
---
Now this is advanced ~~shit~~ crap talking (‚úø‚ó†‚Äø‚Ä¢)
---
This is what my tax iskies are going to?  More big (corporate) government?  This is just corporate welfare subsidizing construction companies.   
---
*THANKS TIBUS HETH!*
---
i'm not really sure i can see my way to a change based on this that isn't basically locking in goonswarm's advantage forever
---
&gt;increase training difficulty of the caps and supers
---
Would have only delayed the inevitable and increased the barrier for newbies. This is the same argument for why injectors aren't the problem or the cause of the problem, they only accelerated us getting to where we are.
---
If mass limits are gone, might as well bring the supers and titans.
---
i wish goons would actually do that, but lets not kid ourselves. Also 99% of the connections won't be in 1dq so v0v. Hope you enjoy that booming spire static
---
I can't tell if this is satire or not
---
That seems to imply either a wider range of possible masses on the hole (which makes living in high-class space for cap rolling more desirable, I think) or maybe that your static will spawn even if rolled and not warped to. Either of these would be good changes.
---
Job numbers are doing fine. We are not heading into a recession.
---
^ i spy capitals. please vacate the sub and have a fantastic weekend.
---
Classic response. While lowsec has a somewhat higher chance of a fight it's by no means guaranteed that you will get it in the hour. I once watched my friend scanning through many lowsec systems for DEDs in his *Drake* and he only got caught after like 3 or 4 hours. Most of lowsec is also empty as hell especially not during primetime, and if someone is in local he's probably afk in one of the many citadels or in a warp tunnel.
---
I've seen this argument so many times and it has another fundamental error: that there are deeper reasons for people losing the initiative and saying "just take the initiative" aint gonna work. People want fast paced, consistent content these days and 1) the PVE content just doesn't work 2) the PVP content still takes too long to find. Yeah you may get to frag a frigate in the hour of play if you are lucky --- or would you rather play 2 League matches, a couple FF14 dungeons, or watch an episode of [insert the Netflix show you are watching]? People with more free time might delve into the industry and social aspects of the game, or even just have time to do more fleet based action (for example dreadbombing), but people with irregular playing time just gets fucked. And the demographic changes of the playerbase means there will be more and more of those people.
---
"AFK Carrier ratting" ... you've clearly never Carrier Ratted.
---
Haha. Salty? That‚Äôs like direct quote from what you people have been telling Null players?
---
Anything with a Jump drive shouldn't be able to be safety asseted IMHO
---
who. the fuck. cares. what was originally intended.
---
also, who. the fuck. cares. what some spodbrain thinks
---
there is far too many shouty capital letters in people's comments. can't we all just get along folks?
---
I'm legitimately just asking a question with this: why is deflation bad? I'm an engineering major college kid, and I don't even have an IRA or anything IRL... so I really just don't know much about economics.
---
Does it entrench current holders of assets and capital while making it increasingly difficult for smaller/newer players to advance? Does it represent a general loss of wealth? Or what exactly is the signature effect of deflation in the context of a game?
---
I'm not interested in your one liner. This isn't twitter. Either add to the discussion or GTFO.
---
I mean, htfu or move to high sec if you don't want to pvp...
---
Wormholers: Nullsec crying aboht the age of chaos is amazing. Hilmar we love you. Dpnt lwt thw Age of Chaos wver stop.
---
Hilmar: Chaos needs to be applied to WH space. Its far too safe and needs a fairly strong review. Especially regarding how easy and predictable it is to roll holes safely with the same results each and every time.
---
Wormholers: But The Age of Chaos was supposed to make the game balanced in ways that only BENEFITTED my playstyle. Hilmar doesnt know what hes doing, this will kill PvP for smaller groups. Unsubbing my accounts.
---
Itt now means as well that the connection ibside cannot be rolled as well. Meaning you can be stuck there as welll.
---
i'm so glad hilmar is looking so well and comfy in that finnbro's living room (‚úø‚ó†‚Äø‚ó†)  
---
he sounds like he's hitting the delete button on titans soon, making eve great again (‚óï‚Äø‚óï‚úø)
---
I literally quoted wormholers from this subreddit... so, do they sound salty? Heh..
---
Wormholers (post-blackout): lol nullbears get fucked adapt or die
---
The spodbrain in this thread all has goon or init flairs. Big thinks.
---
It will impact every wormhole exit
---
Lol... god damn it... I can't tell if the game is dying or if the community is killing it... it's so weird to me the way this is occurring. Like if it's random mass for whs. Great! We basically deal with that already to some extent and the consistent randomness would be something to get used to. Not being able to role would mean large stagnant chains and less time actually fighting anyone, arguably. 
---
I just don't get the weird... Almost rpg or city builder mentality people have where risk in a PvP game makes it suddenly unplayable. Or a mechanic change means the end of civilization as we know it because you need to actually think and adapt to the change. I love that aspect honestly but am totally lost when people rage quit over it. Don't get me wrong I love the salt. And this definitely won't faze the group I'm with unless it's a catastrophic blow to content generation. Last thing I wanna do is log off or crab because CCP things we fight too much.
---
Losing players certainly isn‚Äôt good.  Losing paying players worse yet for CCP.  I would be curious to know how many people haven‚Äôt logged in vs accounts, though.  Also how many online were bot accounts.
---
Can't wait to see the new model... It's gonna look magestic as fuck!! xD
---
On a side note, do any of that other news maybe be giving us a cause to believe we will be having a agency event coming soon? I really miss having those boosters --"
---
Also, new random skin drops, plz * *_* *
---
This. I think the way its presented is confusing, because I hear this often. unless you need to go down to .25au ( which, should be almost never barring high end data/relics) you will see no difference in scanning.
---
And yet, every day 200+ bombers pop out of a wormhole and drop on a lone guy in a rorqual or super... I don't think they agree with your statement.
---
Thank you very much for taking the time to write all of that up!
---
Just imagine you can scan all C6 in one big chain. :D
---
And just imagine we can connect all PvP corps in C5 space, then find a couple nulls that can't rolled and hunt with like 100 drekas + 30 guards + 20 ceptors and sabres ... "oh goons have 2 titans responded, go back 7 jumps into that C5 and now tackle some Test-Ships ... what`? Test responded? Hey guys, Brave Rorq over here" ... why fight against each other, if you have like 100 nullsec connections that you can all use in a big chain for a whole day.
---
AdApT oR dIe ScRuB
---
Nope, it's an entitled bee brain
---
We seem upset. Is it impossible to touch one aspect of the game without taking away from another?
---
Not *only*, but they're certainly the main source - it also drops in some missions and from Sleeper cache sites in k-space.
---
I would be satisfied with any capitals being unable to be put into asset safety as well. Blops makes a bit more sense to be able to be put into an interbus ship to get moved. 
---
If CCP did remove all jump drive capable ships from asset safety, I could deal with it. Plenty of time to do evac ops.
---
*praxii
---
If it can‚Äôt sync back to my desktop pyfa then it‚Äôs too much effort tbh
---
Why don't we remove all subcapital ships.
---
Both will have the exact same effect on the games player count.
---
I don't think wormholers have it harder then null sec group even with the logistics. maby if your solo. I think wormholers risk very little to get what they have access to compare to null sec. infact I am pretty sure that worm holes are safer and better isk then null.
---
How woemhokes work it means there is at least one  to thrwe wormhole or every type in null,low or high sec.
---
And the cyno changes remove large capital battles as a "viable lifestyle".  Yet I don't think you WH folks were all that concerned.
---
Looking forward to your static hitting 1DQ or D-P.  We'll come visit!  Content's content, right?
---
I think your analogy is unsound.
---
IT folks and engineers in general tend to take great pleasure when things go boom: take the BOFH as an example.
---
Carebears tend to show the same savage psychology as accountants, HR consultants, project managers and "change evangelists". All of whom succeed in turning functioning humans into infantile vegetables "for the greater good". These excuses are like canned vegatables: over cooked, devoid of flavour, utterly predictable, and only useful when thrown out a 10th floor window.
---
It has never stopped me from killing anything. gate guns and local is just roaming on hardmode.
---
&gt; And the cyno changes remove large capital battles as a "viable lifestyle".
---
No it didn't.
---
...Basically all of this is already shortcutted.
---
And why do you use the arrows? Use the flat faces from directly to that side. Takes 2 adjustments for any 3d space. The arrows will never be faster.
---
I'll take "Roaming nullified T3C null fleets for 500 Alex".
---
I think some of you need to understand wormholes. There are 2 different numbers to keep in mind  with wormholes,  
---
Jump mass, The max amount of mass that can be jumped through a wormhole, C5/C6 connections typically have a Jump mass of 1.3 tillion. So pretty much any normal capital. Carrier, Dread Fax or Rorqual. C4/3/2 have a jump mass of 300m, so battleships and below. C1, battlecruiser are the limit.  
---
Then you have  
---
Total mass.  Total mass is the max amount of mass that can be brought through the hole before it collapses. Most holes that can fit a capital have a mass of 3 or 5 billion. With that you can move 1 capital out and back in (remember caps weigh in at about 1.3 billion) or 2 out and back with some change.   
---
So now that we have that out of the way, With what is being said. Removing the ability to roll holes simply removes the total mass. You will still be limited with how big of ships you can move in with the jump mass. Supers and Titans would still be excluded from the party but moving hundreds of dreads and carriers from a null sec entrance to the C5 or C6 highway and glassing them over does seem like a good and profitable time!!! If null sec needs to be more dangerous, So do wormholes.
---
The only time you might see that many bombers is from bombers bar which would then be a fleet of a lot of different corps. A lot of which are from k space
---
&gt;A:Yes, we have spent a lot of time figuring that out, we are confident the numbers we quote are genuine new people that are trying to play the game, not alts or bots.
---
at a rate of 12k each week that's half a million players a year try eve - yet we can't get log in numbers, on a game you can play for free, to breach 30k?
---
Have you been to anywhere in placid, metropolis, blackrise, or even remotely close to pureblind. You null Bros have a huge jump gate network why dont you use it and find yourself some solo/small gang action anywhere in eve that isn't your krab space.
---
maby that should be what you have to deal with to live in a wormhole.
---
CCP made null with local as well. Everything was based around that. They decided to change the rules. Just like now for wormholes.
---
I am upset. Every moron's stupid wet fart of an idea is taking up room that could be quality shitposts, making it the new norm of this God forsaken shithole.
---
Also you're trying to fix PvP with PvE, which is retarded for reasons obvious to literally all players besides you apparently.
---
Sure but if the chain is shit you cant roll for anything better.
---
Does this mean that leshaks will have 7k~ dps with max skills and good fit?
---
&gt;Haha. Salty? That‚Äôs like a direct quote from what you people have been telling Null players?
---
Such simple minded people. Everything is fine as long as everyone else is getting "nerfed". HTFU! Learn to play! Adapt or die!
---
Then a little nerf hits them and WAAA WAAA WAAA.
---
"Accidentally" click jump instead of bridge.
---
Oh i forgot, your normal response to any thread in your space are 3-4 caracals, right? isn't that what you're warping to a wh in your space when someone pops up? Or was it another ship-type ... let me thing ... tin ... tan ... tiny ... tincan? ... ahhh titan ... yes thats it ..
---
So please tell me besides covering your rorqs with the amount of supers that nobody can counter in your space, what else do you do with wh's so far?
---
Sure but most wh systems are empty. It would only be an issue if a big group was connected.
---
Then suddenly you are stuck insise for three days. No wormhole exits.
---
Right.. but lets be honest about that. You said "the only time" and it literally is all day, every day. Come on man..
---
Let's say your static hits 1DQ or D-P.  And no longer has a mass limit.
---
That's hundreds of players who can come on in to your hole, all day long.  In 250-man fleets.  So much content, delivered right to you.
---
Read the guys other comments. Hes literally all salt.
---
He repeatedly referenced 600k a year as the number, so yeah, I think that's why we're seeing chaos era changes and new player focus. They want people to want to play the game, whereas most games are just trying to get players to play it.
---
A lot are yea
---
That cliff, yikes.
---
&gt; I think you should step off reddit for a bit, friend. Reducing complicated and nuanced subjects to "witty", sarcastic, and oversimplified one liners can't be good for your long term intellectual health. You're impairing your ability to think deeply, and that's not a good thing.
---
You‚Äôre not exactly doing the deepest braindives here. You‚Äôve equated all PvE as bad, ignored numerous sources of inflation that have nothing to do with the players you think should quit, blatantly ignoring the fact that many players have multiple activities they do in game and are asserting knowledge you don‚Äôt have.
---
Maybe take a deep breath and contemplate what EVE looks like if there‚Äôs nobody to buy plex, nobody to hunt in you‚Äôre elite smallgang, and nobody to shoot with your bomber fleets.
---
I‚Äôll save you the brain cycles: it looks dead.
---
&gt; We don't need players who aren't engaged with the game and who's activities only hurt the game (for example, AFK Rorqual multiboxers and AFK VNI/Carrier ratters who only have an inflationary effect on the economy). If a few supercarrier/Titan pilots leave as well, I won't cry about that, either.
---
No what we don‚Äôt need are players who‚Äôd rather tear apart the sandbox to make it easier for them to play their personal version of the game. We don‚Äôt need players who push shitty ‚Äúhealth of the game‚Äù narratives while ignoring the impact their proposals actually have on game health. We do t need more armchair devs who can make fucking terrible suggestions and get listened to while the majority of actual players don‚Äôt even read this subreddit and the majority of this subreddit ***isnt logging into the game***.
---
EVE would be healthier if r/EVE were closed. There‚Äôs 120k Reddit accounts subscribed to this sub and just some simple napkin math will tell you that doesn‚Äôt make any fucking sense. EVE is a game where the average player has two+ accounts. That means USTZ at 16k is 8,000 human players on average. Sure some of those 120k are throwaway Reddit alts. Not half though. Some of them are people interested in the game but who can‚Äôt find a way in. Some of them are lurkers for the drama that shows up here. But a big chunk of them are people who don‚Äôt log in anymore. People who quit, and who then proceed to wax philosophical about how the game should go back to a time they pretend the game was better or how if CCP would just make this one simple change they‚Äôd come back.
---
But they don‚Äôt. They don‚Äôt come back, because they didn‚Äôt quit because they hated the game. They never really quit because they‚Äôre still here. They just don‚Äôt log in any more because they have lives. They grew up, had kids, got married. If they hated the game they‚Äôd have left this sub too. They‚Äôd really be gone. Those people aren‚Äôt here because they actually left.
---
And then there‚Äôs hundreds of players of EVE who leave who were never on Reddit in the first place.
---
16k USTZ is bad. You can say what you want about how the game doesn‚Äôt need those people, but it just shows that you either don‚Äôt actually give a shit or don‚Äôt understand what makes EVE actually unique. So go outside. Take a breath. Contemplate what EVE looks like if the only thing left are hunters who are already so risk averse that they‚Äôd rather hunt PVE players than fights.
---
X to doubt. But bombers bar does run most days.
---
praxae
---
They wouldn't need to change anything... The mechanic you described is text book NPC mining fleets o/
---
You can hunt and kill the haulers for some special loot, on top of having a response fleet warping on top of you.
---
If you have negative standing with the mining fleet, they warp out the moment you reach the belt! o/
---
Aye no doubt
---
I stand corrected my brother.
---
Just out of interest, where would you bracket the Marketing professional?
---
That's not WH'ers, I doubt any group could form half that without a weeks worth of constant pings and everyone pulling all of their alts into home.
---
Oh that would actually be pretty funny. I would have to move into a more connectable wh but having the ability to just dunk on nullsec would be pretty funny. Just sniping ratting supers all day with their fancy new lack of local and cyno changes.
---
Don't mind him fella, he is just a bit salty about the recent changes and additions! :(
---
Yeah, actually it does.

---
Sure, I'll bite. 
---
The point is, your view points are clearly biased towards anti-cap, when you don't actually know how it works. It makes your arguments less compelling. If you understand the mechanics of carrier ratting,  you know if has its risks and its rewards, and its a manually intesive process. And if you don't understand the mechanics, then making "AFK Carrier" ratting comments undermines the message you are trying to send. 
---
Additionally, to paraphrase you, "we dont need titan/super pilots either, fuck em". You are seem to be stating any play style that isnt your own isnt worth having. That attitude will result in a very small player base of like minded people, which for a sand-box game, is unhealthy. If my assumption is incorrect, the your "fuck em" statement again doesnt convey the nuiance of you point. 
---
Thank you and have a nice day.
---
Sorry, I\`m just bad at this game ... I don\`t know things like that.
---
Anyway,  I suppose 500 battleships can be very effective at glassing.
---
&gt; Let them dock
---
In specific Titan-only "drydocks" that you have to build
---
Supporting a game requiring a second character that stays offline to store a ship is retarded too though. 
---
So you're both retarded.
---
No, my logic is not retarded.  What you stated is just plain wrong.
---
The fight for thera rule commence.
---
You should listen to him. He is the Expert.
---
Well you can basically do this ONE time. Nobody is rebuilding anything, if you can basically go through a complete chain with 1000 raven's just knocking over every entity that currently lives in wh-space ...
---
"hey look all those weak corps in wh-space can basically not defend against our 2000 ppl that we're bringing." If that is what you mean HTFU then yes hope for the best.
---
Many a person who ratted to buy in-game PLEX thinks they were a paying customer and that their Omega account counts as a paying player.  Unfortunately that just isn't the case.
---
They operate out of Thera. That's a wormhole. That pretty much sums it up.
---
I disagree that you can barely use it, in a group youll be able to use it fine.
---
ground floor!!! lol
---
I get confused when I hear something like this. In the small gang pvp fleets I usually fly with we almost always find something to fight... When I'm just with my alt flying about even more so.
---
So they're removing both ship mass limits and total mass limits?
---
I could see the total mass limit being removed, but ship mass? Wasn't one of the appeals of lower class wormholes that you couldn't bring in capitals, forcing sub-cap fleets to be a thing?
---
Depends on how you define "playerbase" and what those players are doing.
---
A significantly lower amount of people managed it and typically they were people who could afford maintaining multiple accounts.  Parking it in a pos is a good way for it to be stolen typically and is a bad idea.
---
Please no, part of why NS entities don't roll over WHs so often is how much of a Pita it is to seed a hole properly, waiting for a C5 group to get an NS wandering then throwing 100 dreads at it is not fun...
---
It's less that and more the ability to move an endlessly large fleet of guys through wormholes I'm concerned about.  The mass-limited gameplay and thus limited fleet sizes is one of the things that makes wormhole space unique.
---
And I moved here to get away from the fucking blobs, CCP.
---
So, what you are saying it.. it's ok that wormholers can conveniently choose to pvp any target they want by rolling holes all day long... but it's not ok for someone to be able to engage and evict them without jumping through month long logistical nightmares? Yea.. no. Enjoy the chaos.
---
Context:
---
Just 1v1ed a Brutix in my Hurricane, came so close I honestly think pushing my heat to 100% was what decided the fight.
---
I said kspace to kspace.
---
So what you're saying is that cynoing in capitals into a cap fight is difficult but not impossible and comes with challenges that make it harder to drop in, rather then having every fax that comes in have an immediate cyno?
---
Yeah, thats totally comparable to removing rolling from jspace /s
---
Kinda seems like the bare minimum. As in barely enough to do the job before you died.
---
&gt;Hillmar wants to create chaos so doing something like that doesn't really fit the theme
---
I don't think there'd be anything in the game more chaotic than your static landing in the middle of Goon, TEST or PH space, and no way to roll it away and no limit to what they could put into your hole.
---
Lol the Reddit circlejerk polarities from thread to thread are amazing. The last one was 'lel nullbear Tears delicious' this one is 'lel CCP is dead without us nullbears and our 20 alts'
---
If you mean bombers bar that's an NPSI group, not a single alliance, it's an amalgamation of many different alliances.
---
Also, thera is not a proper WH tyvm, stations + death clones are bad.
---
That was this year to date i believe.
---
 That's an absolutely stupid idea.
---
It depends on the individual marketing professional, their bailiwick and character.
---
Most are drones. Empty air heads of zero value, who's only accomplishment in life is getting into a suit. The grammarly ad execs are a specimen of the breed.
---
The other kind are actually useful. They know when to stop talking, how to make a dry martini, instinctively know what time goes where.
---
IT marketing execs are sadly incurable. They really are worthless: making endless promises, hopelessly underestimate work, then slither out as fast as you can say "you twat" when angry customer realises they've been scammed.
---
Oil and gas execs (it's a big field) are an absolute blast. One regailed me with his story of seismic tests off the coast of Peru, with people who hadnt slept in 3 days. They also drink like men should.
---
It's almost as if people have been saying they've been stupid this entire time.
---
It's sad that Test and Goons are super close friends. Otherwise maybe there should be a unlimited mass wh, that could potentially connect between goon staging and test staging. Just imagine what could happen there.
---
...Are you saying we should be extremely reactive making huge changes without ever giving them a chance to settle?
---
What are you on about?
---
&gt;significantly lower amount of people managed it 
---
Yes that's the point.
---
it isn't, inflation and deflation normally are just a byproduct of an underlying economic situation, that could be good or bad. Its a huge fucking web of reasons it could be good or bad, especially irl when you start to take into account foreign currencies and trade. Deflation really isn't a bad thing inherently, and I don't think it would be bad for eve, especially since most of the low end money making (bounties) is static and only benefits from it.
---
Cap escalation are not whats bringing in 8/b an hour. Being able to chain run WH sites with drifter response in a krab hole with 3 dreads netting over 600mill in blue loot (not counting salvage) in under 5 minutes is what is bringing in 8b and hour. All in relative safety as you can crit you connections limiting a hunter fleet.
---
Not trying to fix anything! Just thought of a possibly new fun element to throw into the current chaos mindset!
---
Now this is a good idea!
---
I never understand why people would fly armor or buffer tanked sleipnir
---
I'd be okay with that. The need for holder toons will increase the cost of ownership more than it does now. 
---
My super pilots are also used as dread and carrier pilots. This is only possible because of Keepstars. I jump clone back when a super op is called. 
---
Turning them back into coffins or at least requiring holder alts to keep them safe while not in use can add more operating cost for them.
---
Please CCP don't walk back your big changes.
---
Last thing we need is more &lt;10 mil isk, 50k EHP shield regen tanked cyno bullshit.
---
Tfw you still get yourself rolled out somehow
---
I am aware of who they are. Your response does not change my statement. (Apparently Thera only place has stations rofl.. what are citadels Alex?)
---
C5 and C6 cap holes are 3.3B btw, not 3B, it's a small distinction, but quite important.
---
Being able to move a hundred dreads through WH space would be absolute cancer, no groups in WH space could field even half that many since corps tend to be quite small...
---
TL:DR: How to let NS blob WHs
---
Stainguy actually suggested that but it's completely random which null region it connects to.
---
&gt;Cap escalation are not whats bringing in 8/b an hour.
---
then the next sentence
---
&gt;being able to chain run WH sites with drifter response in a krab hole with 3 dreads netting over 600mill in blue loot
---
What the fuck are you talking about you mong.
---
There are many other ways to resolve this problem while stepping on less toes and they did choose the one that flips the most tables. It's not like people don't think things need to change. They do. I just think it's dumb how they're doing. Non ironically I do not trust the people who broke the game to fix the game.
---
This is another reason why I wish CCP would move away from the massive nerf/buff mentality, and actually try iterating on their game design.
---
You'd constantly have heavy armour brawls, to the extent that people would run into ISK issues - especially with groups like AFK and HK who's doctrine ships can easily be 2-3B ISK and caps can easily be double figures...
---
Then that's a bad point.  They should be lower in relation to other ships being used in the same fleet.  But not by completely locking people out if they work towards it.
---
That's not the problem though. The problem is we won't be able to roll TO content. The idea of closing holes for pve is a part of the problem, but if we can't reset when we find a dead hole we can't do anything anyways. Increasing the number of wandering wormholes would be a better way to reduce the safety of pve.
---
Lol rip my suggestion üòÇ
---
&gt; So what you're saying is that cynoing in capitals into a cap fight is difficult but not impossible
---
And here I thought WHers were supposed to be the smart players.
---
Heck, there's even a TL:DR at the end you failed to read.
---
If you'd actually try reading this time, you'd find that the problem wasn't that it was "difficult".  The problem is that it's impossible.  You can't get enough EHP to cyno in a fleet via a BLOPs, and you can't position your fleet where you need to in order to fight the battle if the other side already has their supers on grid.
---
*...and suddenly wormholers didn't feel like cheering the chaos era anymore*
---
I feel like supers and Titans need to be nerfed and better balanced against other ships so that their proliferation is less of an issue.  I really don't think "make this more  annoying to use, so fewer people use them" is a winning strategy, besides the fact that it's the opposite of making the game more fun.
---
No docking? Dedicated characters, it's what we used to do anyway
---
Limit storage? Guess we'll find out just how many keepstars the power blocs can anchor... But I'd bet the answer is "enough"
---
Yeah, at AFK Carrier it was pretty clear you don't know WTF your talking about... or you are just blatantly trolling for salty response
---
Citadels in WH space are *very* different from stations, stations cannot be taken over so assets there are safe, whereas if a citadel dies there's no asset safety, all your shit just drops in space, also, WH citadels cannot support death clones, only stations can.
---
My guess is it'll be tornado Christmas, like how plex splitting was for scammers
---
I dont get what youre trying to say. But i like trains tbh
---
Hey GM Team,
---
2 weeks ago i start a ticket because my e-mail account was hacked.  I have not received any answer for these 2 weeks -.-  Are you so extremely busy with other things?
---
Make em bigger. No mass limits. No size limits. Everything can go into the black.
---
Shorten its lifetime to one day. 
---
Wormhole lifespan entangler - ihub module to increase wormhole lifesppan to max three days
---
Blackhole Burst Emitter - reduces chance that a woormgole appears bij 10 % per level depending
---
On system level 
---
Incursion Signal Emitter the other way around.
---
Increase if wormhole exit/entry chance
---
Mass Entanglement Emitter 
---
Per system level it can increases allowed mass on the wormholes. In system
---
All modules uses fuel block's to run.
---
Boom. Problen solved.
---
Expert like you I suppose.
---
I missed that, sorry, that still doesn't really fix anything, KSpace-KSpace has 0 effect on any WH systems and being able to get dreads around the map by jumping WH to WH sounds like insane force projection.
---
thera doesnt count is a pretty widely accepted fact
---
Sounds all good.
---
I like the idea of bold changes, and ideas coming from a firm philosophy.
---
You forgot the part where CCP has no one left to speak on their behalf as the raging mob comes for them in turn.
---
typically though you would think the bigger the ship the more versatile it would be.    All that space has to be used for something.
---
How often where you under extreme danger by anyone from wh space that had a connection somehow in your space? Do you feel you might get evicted out of your sov if wh-groups connect close to you?
---
How often did wh-groups ref and kill citadels in your home?
---
And lets assume there are wh groups really attacking a citadel in your space, how high is the chance we can close off the gates around us? Wait you cannot close gates? What? Your pods can come back to your system anytime if they are set correctly? What do you mean by cynos?
---
You see the issue? There are certain differences in amount of ppl in a wh-group and nullsec alliances and the possibilities to defend against an amount of ships.
---
Question .. Since you are mathing .. 
---
Take a moment to Calculate the percentage overall production and positive for negative flow. 
---
Example... jan though May saw .. say Goons produce 14% of all bounties and 22% of all mining recourse placed into the game.   
---
After black out they now are producing 22% and 30%. Meaning they have gained a value ad of 57% increase in bounties and 36% of increase in contribution Verse other Alliances. 
---
This will tell you who the true winners of the black out are
---
Op success, since presumably one of the issues CCP had with the status quo ante was how nullsec bounties were breaking the economy.
---
The problem with supers and caps is the veteran base (and sales/transfers of skilled toons).  Even newbies are able to buy such toons.  I think CCP never dreamt of having so many players/characters around for such a long time that could cause the current or past numbers of toons in supers.  There is no increased barrier for newbies,    but caps training time could have been increased with 20% and supers with 30%. But it should have been done a few years ago.  What is the point for any alliance to have a large fleet of supers.  I remember going to live in null as a newbie, only a few supers were in game and battles were faught with battlecruisers and battleships. Not with caps and supers. The time a small alliance was able to start conquering stations in a white noise/northern alliance held catch.
---
8B/Hr is not a realistic/sustainable option, only way you hit that is with C6 RG SB Rorqs, so good luck running all the sites in 30mins then not being able to farm for a week (plus, you still have 10+B on grid)
---
Seems to be Falcon's intention. Not quite the paradise he expects it to be.
---
Yeah probably woulda got alpha'd in the next volley.
---
Thought the goal was to aimlessly flip all the tables.
---
Fake news stats.
---
So literally nothing to do with wormhole space is how you fix wormholes?
---
Hunting, mining (yeah i spotted and kill rorqual in my system too) more times it s moon mining or gas mining, i spotted few also that were ratting, kiling citadel, gate caping, and so on.
---
Some of them were staging to blops too.
---
Well everything that you can do in LS.
---
The drop of activity is huge.
---
You wanted more action? you now get everyone, once they remove asset safety in jita and highsec stations. Lowsec systems with 500 ppl inside :D
---
&gt;As it requires at least an Alt with docking rights to recover any other item from a player owned structure atm 
---
Couldn't you asset safety it to another structure in system?
---
So most of the macro indicators are pretty much unchanged, except nullsec bounties, which were widely acknowledged (except by the nullblob, obviously) to be too easy to get before blackout.
---
Looks like it worked successfully.
---
I mean. If jumping into a wh in a 250man fleet is content for you nullbears, great i guess... having a hole to delve or other stagings is always awesome. Usually means alot of pewpew
---
Chaotic means unpredictable (https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/chaotic). Introducing stability into an environment doesn't increase the chaos and in the scenario you mention - the chaos would be nonexistent. 
---
What I mean is the result of such a change and such a scenario is basically 50/50 chance of one of the following happening:
---
1. Either Goon/Test/PH go into the WH and kill everyone within or 
---
2. They don't and nothing happens. 
---
This isn't really chaos, you know what I mean?
---
Sure, they can change whatever they want in whatever way they want, it's their game after all. However, whan I look at the recent changes, they deserve at least a tiny bit of faith in their good judgement.
---
Should they remove the mass limit as is suggested, this would most likely kill WH space the way we know it as the players would have to adapt to the perspective of fighting the 0.0 blob at a random moment in time. This would mean either having only basic shit in their WH homes to avoid huge losses or getting their own 20k people blob going and I'm pretty sure the vast majority of WH players would quit before doing that.
---
Yes, but rats may apply different numbers of points of warp disruption, so you might need more than one. (Some rats that "scram" also just point, even though the tooltip may say otherwise.)
---
if you aren't giving $ to CCP it does not affect their profitability.
---
Alphas, whether real players or bots, do not affect profitability.
---
Omegas that pay by buying PLEX on the market might be HURTING profitability.  A guy in my corp spends irl $ for CCP Plex during sales in order to fund his blingy PvP habit.  He has the $ but hates to krab.  (he also loses 1-2bil T3Cs in his PvP).  When PLEX is inflated by isk fountains, and when ships/mods are deflated by Rrorq mining and ratting, He gets a lot more bang for the $.  Which REDUCES the amount of $ he has to spend to replace the bling.  Very few people discuss that aspect of the macro economics.
---
Wormholer btw.
---
Bring it the fuck on, we're not hypocrites having aneurysms over the summer of chaos.
---
is it a bad point because you disagree with it?
---
&gt;You‚Äôve equated all PvE as bad
---
No. This is just a straw man. There are PvE activities which actively remove ISK from the game - anything that involves an LP store. And without PvE there's no minerals to build ships from, so no ships, and no ISK at all to even have an economy. Your statement is not only a straw man, but it's a ridiculous and flimsy straw man.
---
&gt;ignored numerous sources of inflation that have nothing to do with the players you think should quit
---
"Numerous sources", like what? Incursions and missions? They're balanced against LP stores.
---
[Just check the July MER](https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/6wZj0T8uiaCWRQ2qxDbbLn/6f8d9fbd83ad879c374cbd2171291955/9a_sinksfaucets.png). Bounties and blue loot are huge problems that they're finally just starting to fix with sinks and gameplay changes.
---
&gt;EVE is a game where the average player has two+ accounts.
---
This is patently false. CCP recently (last year or so, having trouble finding it again) released a bar graph that showed that something around 80%+ active players have only a single account.
---
&gt;16k USTZ is bad.
---
Okay, maybe. But what's your argument? That we need more AFK krabs just so CCP can make money?
---
It won't nerf income though. If people can't roll into you, you just wait until you have a dead chain, post a scout on your wormhole, and krab away. Zero risk
---
&gt; having a hole to delve or other stagings is always awesome. Usually means alot of pewpew
---
Now.  When you don't have to worry about them coming into your hole.
---
I like to think that somewhere out there there is someone who disliked the nullsec changes and moved to WH space who's soon going to get a whole new set of changes to dislike
---
[Nice.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jHzdMo-YCc)
---
&gt; and you can't position your fleet where you need to in order to fight the battle if the other side already has their supers on grid.
---
So what you're saying is that initiative, suprise, and getting people prepared to drop hard is an advantage, and that just simply having cynos on every cap in the center of these fights is one of the problems they are trying to fix?
---
*Gasp*
---
As I said, difficult not impossible.  You don't get your cake and eat it too.
---
Have your guys ready to go, decloak a suicide recon, and jam everything through best you can.
---
its not the same as removing wormhole rolling. That would be like telling you to gate your supers.
---
Chaos is indiscriminate you know that right?
---
I live in space that can be invaded and evicted at any time, all day and night long. Perhaps you have heard of null? I'm not sure why null and low sec should have the monopoly on being invadeable. Do you think that's nice and fair?
---
Just wait.
---
&gt; Introducing stability into an environment doesn't increase the chaos and in the scenario you mention - the chaos would be nonexistent.
---
The chaos would be the change from one day where your static is somewhere empty (so, nothing going on in your hole) to the next day when your static happened to open somewhere busy, and that somewhere busy was not severely limited in what they could send into the hole.
---
Triglavian components aren‚Äôt actually a faucet since there aren‚Äôt any NPCs that will buy them from you.  All the money made from selling them was already in the game.
---
As long as there are injectors this will not change.
---
SO, it doesn't have wormholes that can be rolled like any other wormhole? When did that change happen? I mean, since we are using semantics to say a place isn't a wormhole when the entire argument is to deflect away from it serving the exact purpose I was referring to.
---
I'm napkin mathing, will give better mathing once I get home.
---
Also means that significantly larger blob can into your pocket for the day. Shit day for everybody.
---
The mastery tab is pretty innacurate, but looking at the bonuses of each ship should give you a pretty good idea. You'll miss some of the more creative fits that way, but it'll get you started. If you're wondering about activities, like which ships are good for nullsec ratting, etc, then no. There is no such cheat sheet.
---
Bubbling your hole won't save you from nullified assaults amigo. (I'd like to see less nullification).
---
Fuck yes. Thank you scanners for keeping all the ping warriors occupied. Now your work has deminished and you can enjoy your miserable lives a little more. FCs will have more options with reliable connects. 
---
Bless the scouts, their notice dooms the foe.
---
We don't need dreads to do that.
---
Yeah. The problem is only partly that there's too many of them, the problem is mostly that if the other side brings them, there's no point in anything smaller. It's like capitals vs subcaps but on the next level up. Big ships need to have specific roles in a fight, not just be better at everything.
---
Doesn't this make covops dramatically more valuable?
---
It kind of fucks both parties actually.
---
Right, so does that have ANY impact on my statement that they use Thera (because it has wormholes) to rage roll and find content?
---
&gt;PKN Interstellar was founded by the so-called Pikotsaunen Kaatso Nuijaa, or "Dark Forest Business Club"
---
Dark Forest hmm? Wonder if anyone at CCP's read the 3-body problem :D
---
The most obvious option would be that asset safety does not apply to ships at all, right?
---
That means people arent going to lose everything they own if something bad happens, but it also means you cant just dump your fleet of supers into a station and its save until the end of time.
---
When you say "we're" - you may want to refer to all of the other wormholers in this exact thread that indeed are having aneurysms.
---
Unpredictability in rolling is fine by me. A larger variability could give some interesting consequences as long as they just don't suddenly pop without any warning.
---
&gt;We want to unwind the asset safety system eventually. Loss has meaning and should be able to occur in most situations.
---
Loss does have meaning out in space and even with asset safety already.  THis would be an incredibly dumb idea to remove it and I highly request CCP NOT remove asset safety.  Up the damn tax cost on it and call it a day.
---
Sitters always have been titan 1.
---
This is confusing. You're asking for cap brawls but claim to be a pirate? Last I checked, not many eve pirates use capital in their pirating.
---
It was just yesterday... hopefully the WE it s better.
---
I joined eve to be able to get into and build supercapitals.  It‚Äôs cool to me, it was cool to me 10 years ago.  I don‚Äôt like ‚Äúyou have any idea... how fast i am?!‚Äù playstyles, that‚Äôs just me.
---
Bring titans out of asset safety, 100%, but the hatred beyond that is absolutely moronic on Hilmars part.
---
The issue is they aren‚Äôt being used in situations they die in which is an issue of sinks, not supply.
---
Period.
---
It's a dumb idea because it comes from dumb people. All their ideas have been dumb. The same dumb people who broke the game in the first place.
---
I'm really hoping that they where *heavily* intoxicated because, with exception of a few, those are some of the most utterly retarded responses I've ever heard.
---
Capital brawls is fun but they not happen so often that it can be main activity.
---
Both for the reasons I stated and because I disagree with it yes.
---
&gt;So please tell me besides covering your rorqs with the amount of supers that nobody can counter in your space, what else do you do with wh's so far?  
---
Have you ever been to delve? Plenty of kills to be had if you don't completely suck at the game.
---
You just said you were a pirate...
---
come on now. you¬¥re pretty dumb. but not this dumb.
---
Before Sotiyos you had unlimited build queues in the POSes as well. They just weren't secure enough to make it a wise idea.
---
We are talking about future changes here. I don't think that train of thought should be based on POS...
---
Mass limits are already randomised (by ¬±10% or so).
---
it would make a difference probing ceptors in an unbonused ship if you could do it.
---
Dreads make it easier though, or carriers, raven blobs are nice, but there are counters and they aren't always ideal.
---
They get a bonus from PA if they reach certain targets by October.
---
I mean, r/classicwow lose their shit over everything.
---
Demented fucks demanding addons that exited back in the day should be banned today :D
---
Eve has taught me many things. The biggest thing it taught me is that humans have this incredible capacity for short sightedness, hypocricy and double standards.
---
When some of us tried to explain to the wormholes how k space with just the local shut off wouldnt work because of how porous null is (because of gates, cynos, and wormholes) the only reply was HTFU NUB, null is supposed to be dangerous.  No attempt to analyze what we were saying, nope, they just jumped to the conclusion that we were crying and laughwd it off.
---
Now here is ccp talking about wormhole changes that would.make living in wormholes really hard and the same people are reeeeweeeing about it.
---
I'm so tempted to say htfu it aint funny. The thought of idiotic wormholers suffering after celebrating when ccp did something like it to us is stong.  And also wrong, cheering the idea (or its implementation) would be as stupid as what the wormholers did. So I won't.
---
For the record I think its not a good idea given how wormholes work.
---
 See wormholers, its not actually that hard to think things through. Go ahead and give it a try, you might like it.
---
With ya there. Now I dont want cap blobs running around but I'm all for other weird shit
---
Size restrictions are separate from hole mass I think. Doesn't stop us from blobbing them and spoiling their fun anyway though.
---
It‚Äôs almost like there are people with varied opinions posting...
---
I've had probes die and needed those cans.
---
Was fun, helpful, used those probes, found a direct lowsec and bought new proves and replaced theirs.
---
&gt;A:We don't have anything to announce. Wormholes seem too routine and easy to get around. The ease of closing holes needs to be adjusted. All areas need attention.
---
Seems reasonable to me, i actually agree with everything he said.
---
This isn't "stop wormhole rolling"
---
Tbh I would like them visible on probe scan window without the need to scan them down just like anomalies are.  That would be interesting.  I could do without all the open mass because that's just open to blobbing etc which I'm not a fan off.  Keeping the mass makes things interesting by sending in certain size ships or fleets and its unknown how the fights work out.  Rather than through 100 dreads in and wreck every small group.  That's a very bad idea imho.
---
Just kill everyone until they die or leave, works every time.
---
&gt;The point is, your view points are clearly biased towards anti-cap
---
Yes and CCP is tending to agree with me that caps have become a huge problem. "You're biased" isn't an argument. Everyone has bias. Having a bias doesn't automatically invalidate a position. It depends on where the bias comes from.
---
Citing "sand-box" also isn't an argument. Sandboxes have borders.
---
&gt;Additionally, to paraphrase you, "we dont need titan/super pilots either, fuck em". You are seem to be stating any play style that isnt your own isnt worth having.
---
I fly caps. Making an assumption to build a straw man isn't a good look.
---
Boo fucking hoo, you gambled, you lost
---
&gt; So what you're saying is that initiative, suprise, and getting people prepared to drop hard is an advantage, and that just simply having cynos on every cap in the center of these fights is one of the problems they are trying to fix?
---
These battles are over a set objective with a known time limit.  Eg. Keepstars.
---
There is no surprise.  That's why the fleets are gigantic.
---
How 'bout this:  I'll take just as long to think about your analysis of this WH change as you do about the cyno change:
---
"But you WHs want content.  Us coming into your hole and blaping all of your citadels before the hole rolls away is just content. You should be prepared and drop hard to have the advantage!"
---
Sounds pretty dumb, doesn't it?  Now think about what you're saying.
---
NOICE
---
\-because noone was left in local
---
I love the idea of only being able to ‚Äúdock‚Äù or moor outside of the station. Remove auto tethering and make it a mooring feature? You would have to remove tethering from all structures. Redesign the keepstar so that it had mooring stations that extended to accept supercaps. 
---
But in the end, skill injectors are the main problem that brought on the influx of titans. Does ccp want to give up that line of income? Of course not... so they will continue to chase the tail of the main issue without actually fixing it.
---
&gt; Rolling a WH is almost exclusively a PvP thing though
---
No it isn't, WH corps roll statics for PVE content too. Some crit the holes in their static rather than rolling them to actually run sites, but they will certainly roll the static itself to find a good krab hole.
---
It's not the posters it's that each post develops a narrative that is then enforced by mass downvotes to people that go against it :P
---
Eve is a game of alts.          
---
I am true pirate not some lame guy stating this while shooting people in lowsec.     
---
'Pirate' in a lawless space is not a pirate.
---
Please point to me where the wormhole with wormholes that can be rolled and being called a wormhole is incorrect. I'll wait.
---
C6-c6 thunderdome is back baby!
---
That would sure be chaotic for wormhole space. The whole point of this "era" is to challenge players and pull them out of their comfort zone, we've got wormhole rolling down to a science now so maybe it's time for a change. 
---
Cool thing about playing for PVP is it gives you the freedom to live anywhere. Wormholes were hot shit for years, so if this change totally destroys them I'll just move to wherever the better PVP is. Once CCP finishes putting an end to this supercap umbrella titan spamming nonsense maybe that'll be nullsec again, who knows.
---
You're not even close to being able to form a coherent thought.
---
When you only have to regurgitate whatever talking points mittens cares about, making shit posts is pretty easy to do fast.
---
Makes perfect sense, gets downvoted anyway... That's Reddit for ya.
---
Limit the new holes to spawning within surrounding regions until daily reset? Obviously not the only two options.
---
&gt;Boom. WHs can now be removed
---
Perhaps for some. For me, it would be most of my assets as I don't keep many items I'm not using, but I do keep a ton of fitted ships so I can fill w/e role of w/e kind of fleet gets called. 
---
But, if it came to that, I could adapt. Quick fit, stacks of items, and reducing my stock of more expensive ships would mitigate the potential losses. 
---
Many different comments so far about the various ways Asset Safety can be nerfed without being removed. I think most are worth looking into at least.
---
Says the guy who thinks a 100kEHP recon can stay on a grid full of supers when a 600kEHP BLOPs can't.
---
Jump to beacon, nothing bad could happen
---
Its not like Titans &amp; Rorquals online would last very long.
---
Then who of these are the ones that are missing?  (genuine question)  
---
The people I know who are doing PvP (IOW, most of the people I know in EvE) are loving the changes.  They want the box shaken up.  
---
I myself used to explore for isk.  I have done so in many regions my corp has moved in search of PvP (Scalding Pass, GW, Fountain, Tribute, Vale, Venal.  And others I roamed a bit on my own via WHs) and over 3 years it was remarkable how the systems started filling up with insta-warping VNIs and even what I suspect were explorer bots.  Dozens of systems in a night and just VNIs on screen with as little imagination as ABCD1, ABCD2, ABCD3, etc.
---
And TEST can? Don‚Äôt most CNTZ timers go frats way pretty handily? I can‚Äôt imagine test alarm clicking to entirely evict Frat
---
Part of it was probably groups finishing up their need for new structures. Most have finished their jump bridge networks and cyno beacons and jammers. No other big things to build have popped up lately.
---
Not unless they also somehow limit the number of structures. What would currently happen if you'd allow 5 titans to moor on a fortizar?     
---
You would see a fort dropped for every 5th titan in any large group. 
---
Numbers are pulled out of my ass, but you get the picture.
---
with the cost of a fitted super you could plex an account for give or take 10 months
---
Eve doesnt need players that want to play WoW in space.
---
If you want a generic PvE MMO, play one. Last time I checked Eve wasnt supposed to be a generic PvE MMO.
---
Right but you have to understand that PVP groups roll for content dozens, often 100+ times, per day. And when they connect to a region with some activity they go hunting.
---
If holes weren't rollable, you'd have to wait for the hole to EOL. So you'd get maybe 1 connection per day. If it sucked and was dead, you'd have to just log off and try again the next day.
---
There's nothing to stop hundreds of nullseccers from coming into a wormhole as is. You can fit 650 bombers into a typical wormhole exit and back out again. Or roughly 65 Feroxes. Nothing stopping this from happening already. But it never does. Why is that? Wormholes jump in NS and roam all the time. NS groups never jump in wormholes and hunt for PVP. I think NS groups are just afraid of scary wormhole space and afraid of going anywhere they can't light their cynos and get saved by their super blobs, personally.
---
Dude you're delusional. Those lowsec dudes aren't pirates, they are FW or just plain outlaws. Piracy is a totally different game and it's got nothing to do with cap brawls whatsoever. This post is literally just about those cap brawls nothing about piracy. Cyno changes have nothing to do with pirates in eve. We frankly give no shits about cynos. 
---
You know nothing about me mate. I care not for null. My piracy is purely in null for the pew and highsec for the salt.
---
And they said I was the mad one here....
---
Perhaps you mean: 
---
&gt; All of the INIT and Goon people in this thread are eagerly looking to pvp with wormholers.
---
You can't easily roll away pvp content, rollers are super easy to catch and kill. You can roll away a connection which may provide content you don't want in the future, but that's rather different.
---
Ok, but the result of this is 100% predictable and I don't think that's what CCP is aiming for. Eve is a numbers game. 0.0 has more numbers and in such a case WH loses. That's it. No room for chaos here. Sure, a change like this would result in a lot more WH citadels dying and probably to 0.0 fleets that are currently limited in what they can field by the WH mass (this could of course be worked around but it requires significant effort and let's face it, people are lazy) - again, no room for chaos. 0.0 blob finds juicy hole, they roll in, they kill the tiny WH corp, they leave. No worries though, should a change like this happen (which I believe to be unlikely) wormholers would adapt. Eve players always adapt. Some quit, some change their professions, the rest adapts. I just fail to see how removing the limit would fit the theme of creating a more chaotic and unpredictable environment. In fact, the results I foresee are quite the opposite.
---
Yeah, i don't disagree that CCP has the ability, i just think it would be a bad idea for pvp content. 
---
He was talking about deserving tho, thats a whole other topic which is very nuanced and biased
---
Sure, they are safe for 1-2 weeks until it opens into a place with lots of people. Then those people go in and burn it down. Then it's not safe, it's smashed.
---
Praxi
---
According to EVEMon and current Jita prices it costs 22B for 18L 2S skill injectors and the skill books.      
---
So someone might have to sell a titan to afford 2 new titan sitters. Congratulations for adding a lot ore hassle and no gain to the game.
---
I thought there's a triglavian "blue loot" equivalent.
---
Don't forget virtually limitless construction lines.
---
You could take a few gates to find content? God forbid!
---
because every time chat broke, the bots carried on.
---
removing local chat doesn't break bots - we knew this way before blackout. back when removing local was a bug, not a feature.
---
Drifter will generally go for the rorq yes
---
Take a few gates to find content. Don't be lazy.
---
Pirates do all the dishonourable shady shit you're saying is no fun. No self respecting pirate engages in anything resembling a fair or honourable fight. That's completely antithetical to a pirate's life. It should be morally outrageous and inherently unfair actions you commit to if you want to really be a pirate.
---
where do you think plex comes from dingus
---
here's a hint: 500 plex costs 18bux. a normal sub costs 15bux. people who plex for their sub are giving ccp more money than those who don't.
---
If you're crabbing in a WH you crit the hole. You don't roll it.
---
We have yet to see hilmar acknowledge how bad injectors are for EVE.
---
&gt;10 different people could control and 1 person pilot.
---
You mean 10 different alts that one person presses F1 on.
---
I mean drops in number of players logging in.  I have seen numerous chats i was in with people outside the big groups simply dry up in the past 3 months. Ive also seen recruitment chat being quieter than before.
---
Real people are logging in less.  Sorry if that doesn't agree with your narrative, but ive got evidence to back up my position (not just personal experience).
---
http://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility
---
Check 6 months to see the drop.
---
&gt; but the solution should have been to make ratting more engaging, 
---
making ratting more tedious doesn't decrease botting - it increases it as people use bots to bypass the tedium.
---
Any time your no mass hole roles into a region with a big group of players, you would indeed have an element of chaos shoved in your hole.
---
Oh, you're using the term "cap escalation" as running the site in cap. Ya, I think that's the mix up. Capital escalation is actually the name of the mechanic for the site when you show up in a cap. You know, the extra battleships that show up. That's what I was arguing isn't causing 8b/h, those few extra ships. But running them in multiple caps, in safety and quickly should be changed.
---
Praxi*
---
Yeah, but not enough to really make it significant.  It is usually just the difference of turning on your MWD one extra time.
---
1. it depends on how expensive Plex is
---
2. so you'd basically be just attempting to keep your other account around all the time by doing money making activities constantly.  That sounds also awful.
---
I think the lance is in a good place, it takes skill to use property, isn't OP as fuck, and has counterplay. Bosons and targeted DDs are way too strong, to the point where I think those two should just be removed.
---
&gt; Right but you have to understand that PVP groups roll for content dozens, often 100+ times, per day. And when they connect to a region with some activity they go hunting.
---
Only if I'm required to have more understanding than the WH folks cheering the other changes.
---
IOW, there's significant sarcasm going on here.  It would be shitty for WHs, like the other changes are shitty for people who actually want to live in null instead of daytrip from their hole.
---
&gt; You can fit 650 bombers into a typical wormhole exit and back out again. Or roughly 65 Feroxes. Nothing stopping this from happening already. But it never does. Why is that?
---
There's no point.  Your hole will be gone before we can blap the citadels, and you will all just dock up if more than 5 ships enter your hole.
---
I don't care either way. If it's there I'll use it though. What kind of retard refuses free info?
---
Love that shakes feeling. Doing something high risk not knowing if someone will try and fuck you.
---
Does it matter at all nowdays?
---
It would die.  Slowly at first and then very fast.  But it would certainly die.  With EvE as it was we saw the last possible large entity war and it was a fizzle.
---
What this looks like is an attempt by CCP to revive the game by shaking the box.  They might shake it more.  They might do it well.  They might get lucky.  or they might mess it up more.  But it looks like they would rather take the chance of a revival than the assured death.  
---
I am in favor of change.  I HOPE it is good change.
---
&gt; chain run WH sites
---
You know WH sites don't respawn like your null havens right?
---
Yes, but roller are quite cheap. What's a 150m rolling mega here and there compared to the Billions that can be made nightly.
---
I hate that I can't not read your comments in your voice. Make it stop
---
Survey databases, yes
---
Give the alliance the ability to kick out moored ships as well, so that if someone goes super AFK for a long period of time they don't take up valuable Titan space.  Maybe with a delay or something.  On one hand I feel like it's wrong to punish players for not playing and to put a significant personal asset at risk, on the other, it's a Titan.  Also as long as it's a known mechanic, you'd have an incentive to not be "that guy" and you'd want to get your Titan out of alliance space if you were going on hiatus anyways.
---
Though if you could just kick ships out instantly it also offers another avenue for spies to have some fun, and you want to be *really really* sure of who you give the power to kick Titans out, and as a Titan pilot you'd want to be really sure you actually trust your Alliance's command structure.
---
Unless you know something we don't about where a wormhole will open.. it is indeed random and chaotic!
---
I don‚Äôt do anything with triglavians so I might be wrong but I‚Äôm pretty sure that there isn‚Äôt a blue loot equivalent.
---
Engaging != tedious. They could have increased rewards while requiring logi or some form of teamwork.
---
That was specifically in the section talking about July
---
The YTD total was MUCH higher
---
lol
---
THIS.
---
Yeah, but the random factor of wormhole location is already present.
---
They already did like 5 times, my sweet summer child.
---
Taxation is theft!
---
English subs would have been nice...
---
Read up more on the guy. Not pushing a blanket "violence is justified", but there is more to him than being a gay asian dude. Just be honest and don't push a narrative to hard, k?
---
You are using semantics here mate. 10 % or less of EVE lives in wormholes according to CCP. They also netted 12T last month in cash compared to null doing 30T with 10x the player base. WH space is indeed too easy to make money.
---
Also when scanning Thera....
---
&gt;again, no room for chaos. 0.0 blob finds juicy hole, they roll in, they kill the tiny WH corp, they leave
---
Ok, let's contrast that with the changes you do support:
---
WH group finds a ratting carrier outside their static.  They jump in, kill the carrier (they melt very quickly w/o a fax), they leave.  Every.  Single. Time.
---
Doesn't sound all that chaotic either, does it?
---
&gt; Let them dock, but don't let them be put in asset safety
---
so everyone will just log it off in tether? great idea
---
titans/supers being able to dock is the biggest cause of their proliferation, not them getting asset safety.
---
Asset safety and the dropping of loot from cit kills is something good to consider but its not something to be adressed in relation to supercaps specifically, don't overload different issues
---
Cyno Aeon please
---
Too funny
---
&gt; Clearly, because Hilmar wants EVE changes to be so stressful, people seek medication. Turns out, it's easier to deactivate accounts.
---
in the land of freedom where universal health care is taboo, i guess you gotta cut costs somewhere to afford your anti anxiety meds - may as well cut the thing causing the anxiety!
---
Literally not. Read up more on the history and tenents of facism.
---
Ok so you're all reeing over something which Hilmar didn't actually say.
---
He said it's too easy and routine to roll and close down holes. That's likely to mean something like an increased randomness on collapse mass, so you can't just follow your simple flowchart of how many jumps to do, and perhaps also having statics immediately spawn their K162 so you can't keep a hole closed.
---
Removing mass limits, or the ability to close a hole on demand, would be a really terrible change and I'm sure CCP have enough brain cells to work that out.
---
if your ingame income is so limited that you have to constantly be trying to make money to keep an account plexed then the propability of you being able to even afford a super in the first place is very low...
---
&gt; Fuckem we don't need them,
---
considering how much bitching y'all do that they're too safe and won't give you free kills - sounds like you do other wise you wouldn't be bitching about them being so safe.
---
Do you even know what a strawman argument is?
---
You talk about fewer AFK krabs being good but then go on to talk to me about how mining is essential. You think mining is a fun and active activity in game? You think that giving miners less isk per hour by deflating ISK is going to mean more of them mine? Especially when it‚Äôs now dramatically more difficult to do so without incurring significantly more risk of disruption?
---
Incursions and missions both generate raw isk. This ‚Äúbalanced against LP stores‚Äù is a great argument on paper but is just factually wrong.
---
I‚Äôve seen the July MER. I don‚Äôt see how it supports your argument.
---
Also please find me that bar graph, because I‚Äôve seen them talk on numerous occasions about average accounts per player. I‚Äôve also played for fifteen years in null, hisec, Lowsec, wormholes, and vagabonding in between. Of all the people I‚Äôve encountered over this long and strange journey I‚Äôve *rarely* met people who played with a singular account after their first few months of playing. Rarely enough that they stood out as dramatically as the people who have fifteen or more accounts.
---
None of my close friends who have played EVE has had a single account for more than a year of actively playing and yes all of that is anecdotal and feel free to take it with a grain of salt but honestly I don‚Äôt see how I could be so uniquely unlucky to have this experience. 
---
And for the last bit, I think maybe you should just read what I said again.
---
I think the BPOs were a bigger deal.
---
&gt;I can type two sentences in fifty seconds. Can't anyone?
---
&gt;Still, yeah, I didn't even notice until you said something that this was the wrong thread. Whoops!
---
So basically you admit that you had no intention of looking at the actual report, and we're just going to state that bots were benefiting from it regardless of any evidence.
---
Basically you've just admitted to being a parrot/propagandist lol
---
It would create a whole lot of content for null and low sec to invade wormholes. That is indeed content. Lots of it.
---
is this an unironic titan main i'm seeying here?
---
it just keeps giving
---
&gt;ch co
---
LOL the down votes. Legit, you guys are right, let's rewind eve to about 2008. You guys will have tons of fun on your completely empty server, but maybe not when all that's left are people who actually want to pvp with you, as it seems like you guys can only have fun ganking people in ratting/mining anoms.
---
Google sugar and cement.
---
Hey Dingus...   the guy grinding to buy the PLEX isn't creating the PLEX.  So it didn't come from him.  The PLEX wasn't paid for by the player (as in bought with $).
---
Now you can make an argument that this player created a DEMAND for the PLEX to be bought by another player with IRL $.  But there is a counter argument that they are reducing the demand by inflating the value of the PLEX through isk faucets and resource oversupply.    I think it has become a strong argument.
---
Just compare the RL $ cost of a titan.  If you wanted to buy it with $ it has dropped by a ridiculous amount (PLEX going up while at the same time titans going down), and this is mirrored in almost every ship, mod and structure in the game.  
---
So the guy who Rats and mines like crazy is making it so that other guy, the one who pays CCP for PLEX to sell, can now buy much MUCH more stuffs with the same PLEX purchase.  This hurts CCP profitability.
---
Next he'll be telling you all about his gets his shit for free because he mined it.
---
&gt;if your ingame income is so limited that you have to constantly be trying to make money to keep an account plexed then the propability of you being able to even afford a super in the first place is very low...
---
Or, that's just the nature of having to plex an account constantly.  And you will eventually be able to afford a super saving up.  So I disagree entirely.
---
That‚Äôs just an advertisement to get people interested in joining and keep the game relevant in gaming news.
---
And even then ... you have a fight and thats it ... after that you might even go together deeper into your chain and search for content.
---
Yep
---
œÄœÅ·æ∂ŒæŒµŒπœÇ
---
That sounds like a very minimal sitter but fair enough.
---
The point isn't having them on hand or owning them, the point is about being able to casually chuck 10 of em in build in a Sotiyo then stick em on contracts like you're making talwars.
---
The only way you could die anomaly ratting in nullsec with local is if you weren't actually playing the game and watching your screen. You literally only had to watch local and be able to press Ctrl+R and press the warp to citadel button.
---
We know from lots of the complaints about no longer being able to run 5 VNIs that that was in fact the case, and it's a good thing that now you have to pay attention to the game to make ISK.
---
&gt;the guy grinding to buy the PLEX isn't creating the PLEX. So it didn't come from him. The PLEX wasn't paid for by the player
---
why does this matter
---
Enough to roll me out a few times :(
---
But yeah, the current randomness is small. I'm just making it clear that there is already a random mass limit.
---
I get where you are going. I get that this would be a critical and massive change for wormholes. Just like black out and cyno changes. Without getting into you vs. me, I will admit I would be VERY looking forward to being able to invade and fight in lots and lots of wormholes. That would be a whole lot of new content on a scale I like and it would be great loot to replace my non-pve lifestyle.
---
You're a saint, thank you for finding the link.
---
&gt;Every. Single. Time.
---
Lol, nope! There are a lot of variables here, i.e. is the pilot paying attention (dscanning works you know...), does he have support ready, do you have enough ships to bring it down fast enough, maybe the ratting carrier has a brain and is able to kill the tackler and GTFO...
---
Just because you or your friends die every single time doesn't mean everyone does.
---
On the other hand, if a 0.0 group is able to defend their space, they probably have the resources to absolutely steamroll around 90% of WH corps. This seems a lot less chaotic an outcome.
---
Ended up selling it a few weeks ago and moved out of nullsec into lowsec for smaller gang pvp!
---
The clue is in the name. 'Force' recon. Recon for a force. They're not called Solo Recons.
---
IDK how I wound up responding to a month-old thread. But do keep us in mind, when you have some hours to devote. It's a very deep game.
---
They'll need parity with that (Or so they originally said), and iirc one of the Devs mentioned bringing back mooring
---
Yeah it's that two polarising opinion can sits so close together both with a bunch of upvotes and both with a bunch of downvoted comments below disagreeing with them. It's like they get everybody and their mother to upvote everything they post and downvote dissenting voices.
---
Thanks for the work you out into this, much appreciated!
---
Who knows. If you're outnumbered 1000 to 1500 in subcaps you've got a decent chance of winning anyway if you play well, and you won't go broke if you lose. If you're outnumbered 300 titans to 500 you're going to lose no matter what, and you'll be broke. So what's more conductive to starting fights rather than avoiding them?
---
A random mass limit would have negligable effect on krabs, they'll be fine with spending a few minutes on whatever new safe(ish) rolling technique comes to be.
---
It would be devastating for PVP groups however since you need to roll through a fuck ton of fluff to find content or krabs. As a result the krabs will roll everything safely like always, but the pvpers would be discouraged from rolling for them, allowing them to krab safely.
---
Can you shut down your system and control it so nobody can come in? Not even a ceptor? Or the other way arounds, if you are in trouble, are your friends completely disconnected from you and have no way to get to your system?
---
Yup, for months (years?) people have been complaining about the isk faucet of nullsec bounties. This report suggests that recent changes have corrected that problem.
---
EVE needs a lot of structural reform to keep it healthy. Fixing the overwhelming power imbalance of long-established players with unlimited resources is huge.
---
meh
---
We seem to have less people now than before we hard Rorqs and injectors. It seems pretty bad to me.
---
He literally talks about titans the way that sports league commissioners talk about scandals that happen
---
"This was a disgusting occurrence that does not represent the league, and we will take every step necessary to ensure that this type of behavior is taken seriously and punished accordingly"
---
Lovely, but you forgot to heat the RAH, that would have helped you a lot.
---
Suicide. Cyno.
---
by your own logic you wouldve done nothing but isk making for 10 months to afford a super then lol
---
Aah you mean the nullified t3 fleets that are used widely in nullsec because gates are bubbled?
---
Care to elaborate so we can examine the full extent of your spodbrain?
---
That would be awesome. 
---
There is a problem with mooring, though. If you removed keepstar docking and let them moor on smaller structures instead in limited numbers....      
---
Can you imagine seeing that many structures cluttering up space?
---
The capital escalation wave adds value and typically refering to running sites in dreads is refereed to as "capital escalating"
---
Cuz shit spawns at 70k
---
Yea.
---
&gt; costs 22b
---
&gt; So someone might have to sell a titan to afford 2 new titan sitters
---
that's not how profit works
---
With this change, no place will be able to locked down permanently. That is good.
---
EVE has always had a new-player retention problem. It's one of the most infamous and notorious games out there, but when people try it out they burnout very quickly.
---
EVE needs to give newbies a purpose - a way to be relevant.
---
It's not really about ISK, it's about the pilots getting killed and podded out. Another thing that nullsecers don't understand because you can med clone into your home.
---
Thank you Captain Obvious
---
Learn wormholes dude. He' just talking about mass of the hole, not the mass limit of the ships able to jump into different class holes. You can't jump supers and titans because of the jump limit not because of the mass. Two different things.
---
And what stops a nullblob with the current wh mechanics to come into my hole now?
---
repeating anything over and over = tedious.
---
the more click/attention intensive, the quicker it becomes tedious.
---
the reason i prefered AFK ratting was becuase it was the least tedious way of earning isk, even if the isk was pretty shitty. 
---
&gt;They could have increased rewards while requiring logi or some form of teamwork.
---
you've literally just described incursions - which is fine, if you can play on other people's timetables not your own. if you can't then fuck you i guess?
---
&gt; (dscanning works you know...),
---
If only there was an entire class of ships to negate that....Could even give one of them bonuses to tackle range and sensor damps.
---
&gt; does he have support ready
---
Nope.  We don't save ratting carriers now - there is not enough time.  They really are that flimsy.  After the changes....we still won't save ratting carriers.
---
&gt; do you have enough ships to bring it down fast enough
---
Yes, you do.  Again, carriers are flimsy without any faxes, and we're not gonna be able to jump a fax to it 90% of the time.
---
&gt; maybe the ratting carrier has a brain and is able to kill the tackler and GTFO.
---
....or you bring all of a second ship with a point?  Perhaps even one saber?
---
&gt; On the other hand, if a 0.0 group is able to defend their space, they probably have the resources to absolutely steamroll around 90% of WH corps.
---
That would be the point, yes.  A competent WH group already has a guaranteed kill on any carrier in null, thanks to blackout.
---
Who the fuck told you something about being honourable ?     
---
I want your stuff
---
I understand, but be mindful that chaos doesn't necessarily mean "let's fuck their shit up". This entire exchange is pure speculation on our part and I get where you're coming from, it's just that I don't believe this fits CCPs pattern of "chaos". I could be wrong of course, after all, all we have now is a shitpost basing on something Hillmar said during a stream. None of us know what will actually happen but one thing's for certain - people will adapt to the change. They always do, they always find the optimal way and if not - they'll quit. Should such a dramatic change happen, WHs will see a dramatic change and the most immiediate result would probably a lot of the people leaving. I'm pretty sure CCP realize that though and the best course of action is to just wait for the specifics.
---
my org is preparing to burn down someone else's sandbox for the first time. i'm very happy with our growth, and i'm super excited to see how we do in the coming days (‚óï‚Äø‚óï‚úø)
---
\&gt;small corp living in a C1 has a hole that rolls into Delve
---
\&gt;Goons steamroll with 300 battleships
---
It would be scary for sure, though probably fairly (?) safe because they wouldn't have the hole long enough for multiple timers
---
Mass limits and time.
---
They seem so advanced, think watching them mine in known space might hurt that feeling
---
What are peoples complaints about NPC mining fleets? They make the game feel more alive I think
---
Stranded pilots will be directed, once they contact Signal Cartel/EvE-Scout, to the cache. They have a very limited utility, since they can't provide refitting services, but they save a lot of stranded pilots and, at the very least, they provide people with the information (through their name) on how to seek help.
---
If you are not happy with a Rescue Cache in your system, please don't just destroy it: get in touch with Signal Cartel (Thrice Hapus being the CEO) and ask for your system to be blacklisted, so that can be expunged from records and the cache not re-sown there.
---
Scan and bubble your static, if you have a fuck ton of wormholes call it quits for the day. 
---
When it's quiet go full krab mode, clear everything (ideally in a quiet timezone) with eyes on your static and any incoming connections, if someone were to find you chances are they're multiple jumps deep into their chain, unformed, with minimal tackle. Chances are you can escape.
---
Prepare the disposable Alpha rollers!
---
&gt; So what's more conductive to starting fights rather than avoiding them?
---
neither - nobody's going to start a fight to begin with.
---
if you're guaranteed a steam roll with titan supremacy, why aren't the groups with the most titans steamrolling everything/everyone? 
---
answer: they have exactly dick all reason to do so - there's no reason to have a war right now.
---
Good to see all the risk-averse carebears crying in here.
---
&gt;You talk about fewer AFK krabs being good but then go on to talk to me about how mining is essential.
---
PvE activity is essential.
---
So is sodium. Without sodium, there is no life. But too much sodium and you die.
---
&gt;You think mining is a fun and active activity in game?
---
I actually do. I love mining. Lots of people do.
---
&gt;You think that giving miners less isk per hour by deflating ISK is going to mean more of them mine?
---
That ISK will have more buying power, so they'll actually be getting more *value*/hr.
---
&gt;Incursions and missions both generate raw isk. This ‚Äúbalanced against LP stores‚Äù is a great argument on paper but is just factually wrong.
---
Based on... what?
---
&gt;Also please find me that bar graph, because I‚Äôve seen them talk on numerous occasions about average accounts per player. I‚Äôve also played for fifteen years in null, hisec, Lowsec, wormholes, and vagabonding in between. Of all the people I‚Äôve encountered over this long and strange journey I‚Äôve rarely met people who played with a singular account after their first few months of playing. Rarely enough that they stood out as dramatically as the people who have fifteen or more accounts.
---
[I found one](http://targetcaller.blogspot.com/2015/09/players-and-accounts-courtesy-of-ccp.html). So the number is 65%, at least in 2015, not 85%. Blame my poor, old eyes on that one. Also, I swear I saw a graph like that in a FanFest presentation from 2018.
---
So, the average player has 1.7 accounts, but the majority of players (65%) only have 1 account. And considering the distribution this follows, your "napkin math" about how many of the 16k PCU are unique players is likely wrong. We know that, roughly, at least 10,000 of them are unique players.
---
Love to see how helpful the community is!
---
In fairness have been some posts from guys in smaller corps or "little guys" here, but they've just been met with reeeing, htfu, and "no I'm another little guy so you're wrong". 
---
So I feel like whatever someone says, it's discarded unless it fits the narrative that the blackout is great, only bots are leaving, there are way more kills than ever before, and other claims that the MER and concurrent player metrics seem to contradict.
---
Well said but I respectfully disagree. In this situation, the guy wayyy up top is basically saying that if a specific playstyle (hunters being reasonably able to succeed and current defense mechanics being nerfed) exists he sees no reason to play. So in essence you could be arguing against him as well. 
---
I agree with your conclusion, but I don‚Äôt know that it‚Äôs relevant to this particular discussion. I bid him adieu because of outwardly advocating for extremely low risk pve. It‚Äôs not constructive nor is it any way furthering a diverse set of play styles.
---
I can certainly type two sentences in a minute but I'm not sure I can read an entire article, understand it and write two *relevant* sentences in that time.
---
&gt;Permadeath is an interesting mechanic we would like to explore.
---
I have said for years that it would be incredible if you could invest a large amount of ISK to make a new permadeath character that is effectively part of a pirate faction and didn't play by the same rules.
---
That would be fascinating stuff.
---
Perhaps the bulk of income should be fast cash injections. Something you can't farm 24/7 but you make a lot in the short and few times you can commit to it. Don't get rid of anom farming but perhaps reduce the profitability there. If someone wants to grind all day let them grind. Sleeper sites are already basically this. We have Abyssals. We have moon mining. Commit three hours to moon mining and that's a pretty good chunk right there. Maybe another structure that cycles and finds pirate outposts that the corp can run together over the weekends. If only CCP still knew how to make games instead of just turning shit off.

I would think that if they (INIT and Goons) really wanted to pvp in WH space they would. Honestly, are there any mechanics that the large alliances have failed to capitalize on?

CEP and Caldari Navy Greenlight Kickout Station at Jita 4-4 for Big Lulz
---
Ya, lets not compare risk to profit. Null anomalies re spawn rates were nerfed, remember?. A single system cannot sustain more then 2 supers running sites without down time waiting for re spawns. I would gladly trade hours a day running havens in a super vs running a C5 krab hole once a month and making 5-8 billion in a couple nestors or dreads. 
---
Either way, it's nice to know that CCP isn't just looking to pick on null with all this chaos.
---
Mutha f****** sigh guess I should have waited before skill injecting cyno 5 on all my cyno toons
---
nobody said anything about having them moor in limited numbers. this is something you just made up to present a new problem that didn't exist before.
---
Sure. You win.
---
haha nice, the dd's hitting you while in warp was awesome.
---
Narrative? Are you fucking kidding me?? That little gay asian did literally nothing to warrant what happened to him. Fuck you and your racist communist twat brigade. Bring that shit to a location that allows conceal and open carry and we'll see how that fascist elderly beating bullshit goes. Bunch of fucking pussies.
---
He didn't say they wouldn't be able to close it. His concern is that it's too simple a mechanic.
---
Mmm no, that's definitely not what I said.  That  saving up can be done far more in between activites rather than racing to plex before the other plex wore off.
---
This confuses me. The VNI is a far better PVP ship than it was prior to the change. It's no longer a good ratting tool yes but you say you don't afk in it.
---
Maybe they see a couple hundred solo Hecates a day and they just can't be fucked doing anything about it anymore. Why would they undock for you?
---
&gt; so everyone will just log it off in tether? great idea
---
I'm fine with this. 
---
&gt; titans/supers being able to dock is the biggest cause of their proliferation, not them getting asset safety.
---
Mostly agreed. Docking is the source problem, asset safety just compounded it.
---
Burgers eyes after Hilmar spoke it out. I love it.
---
Unironically can I seriously have your stuff?
---
This isn‚Äôt true though - people roll and crit holes all the time to protect their krab hole
---
Oh we need players, I just wish it was easy to drop turbo-krabs and pick up more players interested in partaking in multiple aspects of the game and embracing all it has to offer, pvp included. I hope EVE can find a good balance. The right amount of danger for pve, and content for all types and sizes of pvp activities.
---
the widening gap b/t US imports to China and exports from China actually means the total opposite of what it says which is they are buying billions and billions of Merica cars
---
Eve players have already ruined one game by diplo'ing the fuck out of everything and running rackets together, so yeah, I'd say they have a reason to be concerned. Difference is Blizzard will wield the power of "No, against tos/Eula" to counteract it, instead of "uhhhh, we don't wanna really have to deal with it so let's just say everything is fair game and player driven!!?"
---
Because Titans are getting nerfed?
---
Eve's community is fascinating in their short-sighted desire to run down their own game by making it utterly inhospitable to new players joining.
---
There's so many advantages that a bittervet has, from the 50-80% combat edge from skills, to having alts and just better knowledge of the game.
---
But nope, capitals - and Titans at that - get nerfed and now the game is un-enjoyable and you may as well quit.
---
Aight.
---
Suicide cynos currently work because there's a cap with a cyno jumping to it.  Lag and bugs make jumping to the cyno not terribly reliable in these situations - the cyno is often slow to show up on the menu, and you usually have to hit jump 3-4x before it "takes"....but if you hit it too frequently you fuck up your client.
---
Which means even if everyone is totally ready, you get about one to 5 caps through.  Which currently is fine because those caps have cynos to bring in everyone else.
---
After the changes?  It means one to 5 dead caps.
---
Again, the cyno changes mean large cap battles are gone.  Because lots and lots of Eve breaks when the grid has that many ships, so things are done on that battlefield far, far differently than you'd think from smaller fights.
---
you're stretching
---
Are you new? thats literally how it was for more than a decade pre citadels and the game was infinitely better for it. Currently EVE is the worst it's ever been post 2008. Thats not nostalgia - it genuinely is.
---
Thank Jesus for Virtues.  No way I could ever go back to anything less than 2 AU.
---
Actually I run cap escalations in 3 minutes
---
So you are pushing for CCP to limit content? May as well unplug the server.
---
But I thought the titans were their fault.
---
You roll the hole while krabbing to get a good enough hole to actually krab in.  If my C4 static has like 3 anoms and 1 signature I'm going to roll it away to get a new hole that has more sites in it.  Also no you don't crit the hole for control you roll it away entirely and then don't open up the new connection meaning no one can get in or out until you decide to open up the new connection.
---
Bunch of nancies
---
which means youd be saving for far more than a year
---
Goons (and the other Big Players I can't name because I'm too ignorant) are a *status quo* Power at this point. Their advantage will last until they face changes they can't manage. As a small fish, I'm seeing CHAOS ERA as a sign that CCP recognizes this, and are trying to bring about that change. I think this is a Good Thing.
---
tbf that's 10b+ in practically ungankable ships
---
Bottom line it doesn't do what I want it to do the way I want it to do it when before it did. AND I invested time and isk to get it to do the way I want it to do it. That is ALL that matters.
---
I'll be down for removing asset safety when they let us kill NPC stations in null and low sec. No more risk free unlimited storage right?
---
&gt; Is it just me
---
Yes it's just you.
---
They got a lot more than $5 from me for the time period I'm talking about
---
Time? Why should wh mechanics have an impact on citadel timers? 
---
Mass limit? You just bragged about full fleets... 1000-1500 gokus are enough to evict ANY wh entity... so why shold mass be a problem?
---
Wish I could convince more of my homies to play EVE. It's such an old game that recruiting new people for it is tough. Wonder how well it would go if CCP threw out some paid advertisement for the game.
---
Hilmar wasn't clear which limits he was talking about.  (Frankly it wasn't all that clear he was talking about actually changing anything.)
---
Have you been reading this thread? Many agree to the randomness, just not the possible destruction of content generation.
---
Make it 50% and nothing on info
---
They can't undock because they aren't there, the citadels are empty.  Even if 99 other dudes where crawling around their space they wouldn't know it, and I assure you they aren't because I'll always take a 1v1 hecate fight.
---
Of supers. Everything else is fine or just inconsequential.
---
Yes, it's the bare minimum sitter.   
---
I don't disagree that there are too many titans in the game now. It's just something that could have been mitigated years ago. I disagree with making things more cumbersome and annoying to "fix" the game.
---
No mass limit wormholes will indeed make it much more fun to conduct wormhole fights for us.
---
So making the game harder for hunters preferred play style is bad is what your saying?
---
It was CCP who gave everybody injectors and Rorq mining so we could build more titans so we could make more free advertising.
---
Okay, but I'm curious what you expect it to do, that it does worse now that it did previously that is not AFK content. If you used it for active ratting, why not use a gila? If you are at the keyboard a gila does a better job than a VNI ever did.
---
Or did you misrepresent what you were upset about and do want it as an AFK ratting ship?
---
i liked the daily skill event; it was unobtrusive, simple to do while actually playing eve (shooting a random gate rat instead of slogging through a site), and the rewards were about right - nice to have but not painful if you missed a day. still not as good as the rogue drone one a few years back - quick to run combat sites that required gating all around a region and generated small scale fights galore - but still, pretty good.
---
What's that narrative been going around reddit the last few weeks? Oh yea, stop saying it will hurt the small guys.
---
What you DON‚ÄôT want to be locked out of a certain ship because you lost it on a fleet once?
---
You already can, you just have to work for it.
---
Supercarriers and titans can't use wormholes.
---
So they moved to Curse. Was getting asses kicked hard and then decided to switch because they couldnt farm angel and serp missions in peace.
---
I too enjoy tidiclusterfucked supercap brawls. It is an honor to hit f1 every 30 minutes like the trained baboon I am
---
No more of less a level of impact as blackout.
---
i mean so is rens lmao
---
You can also be rolled mid invasion and prevented from invading.
---
Were wormholers salty when they told nullsec to htfu?
---
Lol no wrong, if you roll the hole away it spawns a new hole, if it's a static, and yes it will show up without you jumping it. As for how you found the hole you want to crab in, it doesn't matter.
---
Point is to control a hole to crab you crit the hole.
---
Is he though?
---
Nullified T3Cs are slow as fuck, so you just scout them and warp anyway.
---
There are many reasons for that, the way titans are designed is one of them. Citadel mechanics are another big one. Equal resource distribution is another. The endless grind for more titans and FAX just to stay relevant is another. But you gotta start somewhere.
---
Besides, Goons did just steamroll Tribute, remember? Nothing but blue balls because there's no reason to even show up without titan supremacy.
---
Oh and if you want local go to low sec where you can mine null sec level ores on moons. And even running DED escalations in low are still profitable.
---
So you have no good connections for pvp or pve, you can‚Äôt role a hole till it dies? Might as well move out of WH space
---
It's not a *requirement* that you be able to be able to survive getting an assload of titans dropped on your head.
---
Wow, you took that and just ran with it hog wild huh? Speaks volumes that you literally threaten gun violence from your high horse of "violence is absolutely not justified". Funny how that works sometimes.
---
&gt;Time? Why should wh mechanics have an impact on citadel timers?
---
Well, the hole is going to time-out before all of the timers on your citadels can be run.  Which means we don't have enough time to blap those before the hole goes away even with perfect hole control.
---
&gt;so why shold mass be a problem?
---
'Cause we'd likely run into them, or close to them, if we were to try all the timers on your citadels.  Especially with our usual citadel-bashing fleets (we'd close the hole with \~1/3rd of the fleet).
---
SHAKE IT SHAKE IT BABY!!!!
---
8 years ago you didn‚Äôt have people multiboxing 10 rorqs or supercap umbrellas or near2 or botting at this extreme
---
Yes it will show up but after about 4 hours so that's more than enough time to krab out a new hole.  Its like you put on that badge to be one of the cool kids but you really don't know much about it do you?
---
It's about as painless as you could ask for to get it back to pyfa.  It has an HTTP server built in that you connect to in your desktop browser.  You can then download the fits in standard EFT or XML format and import into pyfa like anything else.  Or you can send it directly to/from the game with ESI.
---
Goons were deployed tho
---
Pretty much, nothing is set in stone yet.
---
So the only six WH farmers got 2T bounty each? Holy sleepers
---
It does help that wormholers actually undock.
---
Trust me, there are plenty of null sec players that completely understand wormholes. About the pilot being rolled out, The pilot you can bring back in with about 20 minutes of scanning your new connection? Do you not use rolling alpha accounts like a good wormholer?   
---
Take away the ability to roll holes, and now you don't have to worry about podding so much. Just bring the character back down the chain home. Getting evicted, everyone gets to pile in and podding becomes a lot less of a issue. There are pros and cons. Null sec alliances were told to adapt to the black out, and now the cyno changes that are on the horizon. Why should wormhole space be excluded from the chaos.
---
Thank you for that.
---
at this point I'll be in my JF by next weekend but with the cyno changes have to invest more time into my cyno alt account as well
---
These placeholders are really old, so probably something CCP gave up on
---
I don't think you fully grasp how many shitty nullsec regions there are.
---
Devilsaur mafias existed in vanilla too.
---
/u/ccp_rise /u/ccp_fozzie        
---
There is clearly something wrong here
---
But they are at much greater risk... Who would want their bots to lose ships left and right all day if they still used the same old bots?
---
No idea what any of those words mean. WoW is for nerds
---
This thread disagrees with your assertion that wormholers are fine, there are a ton of tears here.
---
You could always bottleneck their production by adding a required mat of limited supply. Not necessarily the best idea but you could make these mats drop from NPC capital spawns. As for nerfing things I've always disliked hitting thing with a hammer. Don't necessarily make them weaker but if you could drastically increase super capital lock times against subs. I think it's retarded to think that a handful of cruisers can easily kill a super like some low seccers want but if you have a one minute lock time on a subcapital then for all their might and power they're all of a sudden not very efficient and clearing subcapitals. You don't always have to nerf things to hell. Reduce the interaction the two can have with one another. It might even fix Fax being so oppressive in WHs. They can't make for good subcap logi if they can't lock subcaps in a timely fashion.
---
What's happening to the Eve monument? I kinda missed it ...
---
Probably only surefire way to kill fortress delve is to nerf supers to the point where subcaps are relevant again in fights for objectives
---
The problem I see with this (and this is not a personal attack) is that null sec practices have so far ruined every style of game-play they have come in contact with. Wherever null injects itself just destroys other types of play with blobs and terrible mechanics. Unfortunately, null alliances actually do function like a cancer. I think FW suffered the most from this and I would hate to see WH space end up like FW because null alliances are bored and over powered. It's my personal opinion and tbh it's one that is very unlikely to be swayed. I have nothing against the players in null but the alliances themselves are a crippling problem.
---
Rescue caches have helped hundreds of stranded players.
---
More info [https://evescoutrescue.com](https://evescoutrescue.com/home/esrc.php)
---
Supers can only be docked in slots in citadels. Base capacity is 3 slots for a fortizar and can be increased by a few with expensive modules. Titans would use 3 slots to dock.
---
Docked supers are visible from space as they would obviously stick out due to their size, and will die with the structure if not undocked.
---
Low power structures would detach their docked supers which would fight the attacking fleet under AI control at reduced effectiveness as a skeleton crew attempts to save the vessel but drops loot and a killmail when killed.  This would happen after their armor timer giving incentive for a fleet to reinforce the neglected citadel.
---
Nothing says painless like an http server!
---
600 mill in 3 minutes (one siege cycle). I assume with multiple dreads? Ya that isk to risk ratio is extremely off.  :)
---
i dont think that high. keep in mind that the current max Dps leshaks are already at 150%, we arent doubling their current value when we go 150-&gt; 270, we are adding another base damage. i think 3.5-4k is more in range, but it varies on skills, fit etc.
---
In short, coordination between guilds to control a resource.
---
It's almost like CCP did this on purpose to sell a bunch of injectors to people panicking at the changes...
---
&gt;CCP pls think of my killboard
---
&gt; Q:Eve monument staying where it is?
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; A:It'll be relocated
---
&gt; Q:Any plans to change the nameplate?
---
&gt; A:We like the idea of the snapshot in time, so right now we're not planning to change it.
---
&gt; Q:Cool statue in lobby, etc?
---
&gt; A:Lots of eve flavor in the new building.
---
They're on a healthy path, though.  Knocking down the level of safety needed to happen, and can now be incrementally rolled back by buffing payouts (which I believe Rise mentioned).  A galaxy that rats 40 trillion and loses 10 is a much more engaging universe than one that rats 31 trillion and loses 1, while still having similar macroeconomic conditions.
---
Enjoy your chaos!
---
Wormhole space IS invadeable though as it is, and removing rolling would arguably made invasions harder. Without rolling you essentially have to wait until you have a chain to where you want to go, with rolling you can roll from a staging wormhole and get to any wormhole you need to get to with time.
---
Null invasions are also SIGNIFICANTLY different in terms of pods and clones. Podding is huge in WH and fairly benign in Null.
---
Possibly yes.
---
Remove a few of them?
---
first of all it isn't, second of all why would that be a concern?
---
Why in the world is that a good idea? 
---
It makes less people die in J space and makes it a WHOLE lot safer to krab if you get a good bear hole in your static.
---
Have you read it and if so was it good?
---
The same could be said for any play styles that don't align with yours.
---
Wormholes being vulnerable to retaliation is gonna be awesome.
---
&gt;‚ÄúWe want you on your toes, we want you to feel like the blanket is being pulled from under you every single week."
---
This change would certainly live up to that. I look forward to meeting more Wormhole Whales who think because they rolled somewhere quiet that they're safe.
---
&gt; You want EVE to be more visible? Start streaming or support your streamers
---
zoomers get out
---
What is in TOS
---
grrrr wormholers
---
Yep.
---
I've been back playing for 10 months or so and was having a good time spinning VNIs with the occasional carrier ratting session for income. I just make isk for ships, I don't have a grand plan for being space rich. Opened up a new account to try triple boxing. Always x'ing up for fleets and occasionally seeking out my own trouble locally and in adjacent regions. I don't own a Rorqual.
---
VNI nerfs. Okay, I'll train to Ishtars so I can keep doing what I'm doing, buying ships and blowing them up.
---
Blackout announcement. Cool idea, I get it, but now I can't PVE at work, which means less isk to play with, so I log in less to actually PVP.
---
Cyno nerfs. Okay now it's getting a little mad. I just want to be able to move my own couple carriers and dreads without sacrificing a recon every time, but it's going to make logistics harder and more attention-intensive, so I may have even less time to play.
---
See what I'm getting at?
---
This vocal minority bitching about unassailable null fortresses got what they wanted, but it may kill the game for normie null folks like myself.
---
yes. have you met wormholers.
---
I'll just adapt.
---
I think CCP is in a shit place. If they didn't change anything the level of pve activity and botting goes up but real players who participate in a mix of activities get fed up and leave. Economy shits itself and the game dies a slow death over time because the game becomes so unbelievably stagnant for people who want to do more than rat/mine. On the other hand they try out these new changes, it has the potential to increase balanced and diverse gameplay for all types of players and leads to an overall healthier environment. Time will tell I guess. Are these changes satisfactory to all players? Of course not. Should CCP do something about the safety of PVE in Null? Oh fuck yes, in my opinion.
---
This is like a reverse argument that you hope a dev sees and thinks it's legit.
---
If a wormhole has no mass limit and will last 16 hours, I don't care if it's across the universe. If I want to invade it, I'll gate my 200 man fleet over there and jump in.
---
Seems like a complicated solution when you could just cap super capital storage. Though I'd personally like to see their production bottlenecked. Although the cat's already out of the bag and no upcoming alliance is going to have a chance in hell competing with existing alliances with established supercapital blobs. Some kind of buyback program is the only fair way I can see of reducing supercapital numbers.
---
This massive "I'm unsubbing" drama is because why? All over the nullsec local blackout?
---
Why blur the overview?
---
&gt; ratting bounties across whole New Eden by tens of thousands of players
---
&gt;tens of thousands of relevant unique players 
---
i really wish I could be as optimistic about the game's population as you are
---
If I'm losing SP or getting locked out of my ship every time I die, I'd most likely stop playing.
---
When the finish it and go live, everyone should move to the next station in line
---
There's arguably a difference between isk straight into wallet and loot drops that need to be transported from a wh to jita though
---
I'm not new, the game was NOT better for it all.  
---
&gt; Currently EVE is in the worst state it's ever been post 2008 - player numbers, fleet meta, pvp activity. Thats not nostalgia or bittervettery - it genuinely is fucking shocking how poor the game has become just in the last few years post citadels. The dev's realise as well which is why you are seeing streams like this in the first place. 
---
I agree but I do not agree that having to coffin characters is the solution to that.
---
&gt; Also, your pay to win argument is stupid as shit. Its entirely possible to maintain multiple accounts in this game without spending a single penny. If you aren't good enough at the game to do so, you don't deserve to own a Super. Harden the fuck up. 
---
MMm, no it's not.  You can sure plex accounts without spending a penny if you work your ass off for it and then you are just going to be basically maintaining that super account forever by constantly having to do money making for it, which is awful.  I argue that being good at the game in terms of PVE has nothing to with it and shouldnt have anything to do with it in the long wrong.  It sounds like you just want to have less competition and are the one needing to garden the fuck up.
---
&gt; Why is everyone so entitled these days? "*I DESERVE A TITAN ON MY ONE ACCOUNT AND I ALSO SHOULDN'T HAVE TO WORK FOR IT"* is essentially your argument. This is why the game has gone to shit. 
---
It's not entitlement to want to be able to get something in a video game on one account.  My argument isnt anywhere near having to not work for it, I absolutely think you should work for it over time, but requiring multiple accounts for it is dumb and pay to win.  You should stop conflating.
---
Or maybe another wormhole to another jspace and see where that goes. It's shocking how many of them want content delivered to them.
---
Stop acting like you will be locked out of the ship forever.
---
Fucking golden!
---
Eve isn't exactly real life, but deflation is bad because the value of money is increasing. Thus the incentive is to hold money, which grinds an economy to a halt
---
they say "we don't want to work for it" to invade them and they don't want to work for it to gank people.
---
Gamer who knows shite about business detected.
---
That didn't take long at all.
---
In my life I have owned among other things a Navigator and an Escalade.
---
I have also owned a Trans Am and a Camaro. These pairs are similar but not the same. It all boils down to what I myself want/choose at the time.
---
 &gt; stainguy
---
bokay
---
There is a lifetime on wormholes, not just mass...  hillmar was speaking of changimg the mass. the wormhole would collapse before you could run the second timer anyways...
---
Even 250gokus should be able to do the job most of time. Mass isnt a problem.
---
Every wormholer knows that they cant do anything against nullblobs. Right now or with changed wh mechanics soon?.. in the end n+1 will always win.
---
Nope, but you do need a few years
---
Didn't that one survive the ensuing fight?
---
nah just remove timers on keepstars, you brought a massive fuckoff fleet thats able to kill the thing, might aswell allow them to go all 3 layers at once
---
At the moment, small m3, high value things are shifting to Perimeter. PLEX, implants, some high value mods.
---
I don‚Äôt have a reason üò¨ first vid I‚Äôve done so next time I‚Äôll leave it clear - thx for feedback üëçüèª
---
Yeah I mean personally this discussion about too many titans was the one I was having when they first announced rorq changes. I think it's out the box now and you can't put it back.
---
What I can tell you is I've owned a titan and super on and off since mid 2014. Having had dedicated toons the whole time (1 bought, 1 trained, 1 injected) and 3 different titan hulls (rag &gt; avatar &gt; none &gt; avatar) over that time, I don't think the logistical effort of _ownership_ has really changed all that much. Even without being able to dock in a Keepstar tethering on a citadel is still way more convenient than POSes.
---
What's gotten easier is the _acquistion_. My first super was a shady deal with a guy who's alliance would have kicked him if he knew, using a third party we arranged through the EVE-O forum, where he gave me a pos password, ejected from the mostly unfit ship from the SMA, then immediately jumped to a cyno I'd set up 2 mids deep into hostile sov and work out how to get it the rest of the way home. Even if you were buying in alliance the process was the same, just you'd probably have half a dozen alliance leadership types who could do the third party and you'd be warping to a friendly POS after jumping to that cyno.
---
Today you can just grab one off your alliance contracts while docked in a station, buy one in a hostile keepstar and asset safety it, or grab one off public contracts in a freeport. Even if you're buying from a random person they can just go to a freeport and contract it to you.
---
Like if you've already got the thing nothing changes besides like idk having to bring out fuel to yourself in a T1 hauler, but the entire dynamic of acquisition changes.
---
Imagine unironically thinking the non-instant payout of an entire area of space should be less than just the bounty income of a single entity's space. What a time to be alive.
---
Not really. I think it's the combination of injecting both the alliances and the null mechanics into things that were not meant to have that kind of combo. It basically just breaks it. 
---
However, I say this as a person who has no actual play style. This has been a problem for me tbh. 
---
I think WH interaction is required but too much access would simply create another dead play style and destroyed space-type in EVE. Low sec is already wrecked so we don't need more of that or another FW system that's been hobbled down to Farmville.
---
If you ask for titans and forty show up who's going to tell half of them to go home?
---
&gt; If only there was an entire class of ships to negate that.
---
Never seen Lachesis used as primary tackle when hunting, besides, you can always have eyes on the wh/gate...
---
&gt; Nope. We don't save ratting carriers now - there is not enough time. They really are that flimsy.
---
Fit tank to them then... oh wait, them dank ticks would be lower... oh well, risk vs reward blah, blah...
---
&gt; Yes, you do. 
---
You seriously overestimate the manpower of the vast majority of WH groups.
---
&gt; ....or you bring all of a second ship with a point? Perhaps even one saber?
---
Carrier still has a major advantage of being tough and hard-hitting.
---
&gt; A competent WH group already has a guaranteed kill on any carrier in null, thanks to blackout.
---
Blackout didn't do shit here, just look at YOUR replies, not one is related to blackout and yet you blame it for the player's incompetence, bad luck, laziness, lack of situational awareness and risking too much.
---
...oh, and him dying isn't even close to being guaranteed.
---
What your replies show though, is the chaos surrounding trying to kill capital ratters. CCP - op success.
---
I wish you had even the smallest idea how any of this works.
---
Wormholes are mass limited, thats kinda the whole thing that makes the small groups of wormholes work. You'd have to infil an initial force without being noticed wouldn't you? It's almost like wormhole groups have to do the same things when evicting another wormhole group just without the extra couple of thousands of F1 monkies.
---
Really you don't? I think it's pretty simple, make them useless in any numbers at all.
---
If I'm reading the MER right, that's what was turned in not what dropped. If a significant portion is blown up then the potential is even more! And if a significant portion of drops is not blown up then what does it matter if you have to transport some?
---
I cannot wait to buy a cheap super in the near future :)
---
&gt;Hey guys, I paraphrased the conversation from [today's fanfest stream](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/471131984?t=20m13s) for those that don't/can't watch it. I would have like to have done exact quotes and timestamps but it takes so long I decided instead to just paraphrase. Sorry for typos or formatting issues, it's a lot.

&gt;Start of talk

&gt;Starting topic is "Death is a serious matter". It's what eve was founded on and has to continue. Hellmar tells story about losing his friends' ship to a gatecamp when in the bathroom.
---
&gt;Q: Are you willing to bring SP loss back from death?
---
&gt;&gt;A: We wouldn't want to directly bring back the same SP loss. There is something there with Jump Clones having different roles. There should be an aspect of "I am putting chips on the table" possibly past implants.
---
&gt;Q:Neocron idea - Temporary loss when you died, debuffs to progression
---
&gt;&gt;A:Possibly the opposite would be better, lose SP when you die and then SP comes back faster. Permadeath is an interesting mechanic we would like to explore.
---
Looking to put the final nail in the Faction Warfare coffin... bold strategy.
---
Truth
---
Gamer who wants a company to pander to HIS playstyle instead of their goal for their game detected.  That's not how this works. Go play Hello Kitty Online chummer.
---
Guys you have it all wrong. You won't need to roll holes anymore because you'll just right click and enter the target system you want to exit.
---
The lowered ratting bounties in null are of course _completely unrelated_ to the fact that many null krabs have decided to take their ball home and try to wait out the blackout change...
---
I would say less than that. For example weapon and racial drone specialization skills are sooo little gain for that skilling time. There are quite a few examples of this...
---
Mostly true, but the problem is the risk itself is overwhelming. It doesn't matter how much anoms pay out if you have no chance of survival against an adverasy. You basically need overwhelming help to come in about 10 seconds, which isn't feasible or worth the time/investment from your helpers, especially without a cyno.
---
Add on top of that the human tendency for risk avoidance, and it's completely stalling out NS.
---
I actually agree with Blackout and putting cynos on specialized ships, btw, I think the problem is overpowered cov ops stuff, lack of team-based ratting, and stuff like that.
---
&gt; 3-body problem
---
100%  
---
Hilmar talked about it in the Talking In Stations interview
---
https://tagn.wordpress.com/2019/08/18/chaos-fatigue/
---
I think the blackout has more of a psychological effect than a practical one. Sure, intel is restricted but apart from the couple of days immiedately after the blackout was introduced (when people flocked to hunt those 0.0 farmers) and when you exclude those that think it's now waaay to risky to rat/mine in 0.0, I don't think the effects are nearly as extensive as people believe.
---
&gt; If only there was an entire class of ships to negate that....Could even give one of them bonuses to tackle range and sensor damps.
---
might even be aligned and warp off once they show up on grid. also might look out for sigs so you don¬¥t land right in them.
---
&gt; Yes, you do. Again, carriers are flimsy without any faxes, and we're not gonna be able to jump a fax to it 90% of the time.
---
fitting tank is a thing. being PvP capable while PvEing is a thing. 
---
&gt; ....or you bring all of a second ship with a point?
---
neuts are a thing
---
&gt; Perhaps even one saber?
---
kill it
---
i mean i honestly don¬¥t give a fuck about this whole afair. but the reason why 90% of your carriers die when caught and plenty of them get caught in the first place is because they are piloted fucking retarded krabs that couldn¬¥t fight their way out of a wet paperbag if their life depended on it.
---
HTFU or go back to Highsec.
---
Effort and time. 
---
I don't super rat or wh krab but one is lot more demanding logistically I would imagine.
---
I don't give half a Fedo's arse about wormholes, I care more for increased conflict within kspace and ganking carebears in null without having to travel across the damn galaxy :)
---
Deflation in videogames indicates collapsing demand for goods and/or reduction of primary PvE/moneymaking, neither of which is a good signal of game health. In the first case, demand for goods in videogames is almost entirely some sort of consumables, which are used up in the course of player activities. A reduction in demand points to a reduction in consumption, which comes from a reduction in player activities that use up goods (almost all of them).
---
Deflation in IRL is somewhat different, but also extremely bad for the economy. Whenever there is deflation, money on hand increases in value. This means that people will stop spending and let their money appreciate rather than put the money to use in consumption or investments. This means companies aren't selling their good, which means companies aren't making money, which means people get fired. Modern Central banks would rather fly helicopters filled with money and throw it out the side rather than have deflation (what they actually do is send everyone a check and say "go buy shit").
---
&gt;  Deflation really isn't a bad thing inherently
---
Yes it is, go back to /r/libertarian.
---
Yup, and the resulting chaos would be glorious.
---
Why aren't you invading now?  When our nullsec chains connect to your space, you do nothing?  Despite what your flair bait alliamce may think, it doesn't take a year to evict a hole. It just takes knowledge and perseverance.
---
What's stopping you from doing that now?
---
And a lot safer undock
---
I don‚Äôt necessarily agree with the changes they are doing but stagnation is a big risk as well. I disagree with how they did the cyno changes but I‚Äôm not going to say I quit before I see the results nor conversely will I say it will be great for the game. I think there were other cyno changes that could have made them more even for attacker and defender but I‚Äôll keep playing until the game isn‚Äôt fun anymore. At that point I‚Äôll vote with my wallet and not a reddit thread. I like the discussion of changes on here but have grown tired of everyone pointing to one fact of many and then twisting it to fit their narrative.
---
You're missing the point.  Eve wasn't ever meant to be a passive at work activity.  And nullsec is MEANT TO BE DANGEROUS AS FUCK.  If you want that life go to highsec and earn the appropriate amount of money for your low investment into the game.
---
I think when he says 'the ability to close down holes' he is specifically talking about k162 mechanics in farms, where by rolling all the connections you can rat in safety (unless a new hole rolls into you)
---
My point is you're not the only one looking for a duel... when the Nth person in the last hour comes looking for one I'm going to go do something else instead. Even if someone did duel you that guy can't stop others from jumping in on the kill. Null sec isn't the best place for that kind of content bro and it honestly shouldn't be. CCP needs to show some love to low sec. Not the people who live there. Low sec itself.
---
&gt;or maybe that your static will spawn even if rolled and not warped to
---
Please. Please, CCP. Please. This would be *great*.
---
For one person or the group? Because super ratting is more logistically challenging for the group and WH ratting more so for the individual. But the WH payout is MUCH more lucrative.
---
What's stopping you now?  Other than ignorance and laziness.
---
Why? It doesn't even make sense in any realism perspective.
---
he's not talking about nerfing titans, he appears to be talking about making them harder to get and keep to make them "special" which is the same sort of dumb design philosophy that keeps getting them turned into the apex force of eve
---
Yep things need to change to flourish!
---
it wont make living in WHs really hard though, it will make them tedious and less fun. Depending on what they meant, and what gets changed adding randomized chances to lose your ship, just cause adds no value whatsoever.
---
Stretching is an important warm up before wildly jumping to conclusions.
---
Literally nobody.
---
Why should people be able to store a hundred dreads in NPC in complete safety? You're not making the game more difficult by favouring one community.
---
so you're telling me after playing for over a year someone still didn't figure out how to make more than 1.8-2b in a month but wants to get a super? sounds pretty retarded to me
---
Give a module that recover mass of wh (not exceeding max mass and with diminishing returns per hole). Hole control will be a bit more important to discourage leaving a hole crit and be safe.
---
thank you c80bec06142a4642947e, very cool!
---
&gt;imagine we can connect all PvP corps in C5 space
---
I stopped reading here
---
noted subcap-light alliance goonswarm, named for its tendency to bring small numbers of elite pilots as opposed to large numbers of people who struggle to know what ammo to load without a full-color poster explaining it
---
Hole being purposely rolled as a fleet approaches? Durrrrrr. Come on man. Fling insults elsewhere when you are asking such a dumb ass question.
---
To be honest, no more rolling isn't really the end of the world. It's going to make wormholes more boring, that's for sure, but it's not going to kill anything.
---
It was a nice change to have an actual discussion with someone. Fly safe o7
---
Precisely. Let's wait for the announcement and we'll see how it goes from there.
---
go away. bad ideas only in this thread.
---
I'll take rolling the hole as a fleet approaches Alex.
---
Where are you getting this from?
---
It's profitable because nobody does it. It won't be for long if people start doing just that.
---
ccp is TRYING to, but since hilmar has no idea what he's doing if they're GOING to is another story
---
Well, you could balance by making it harder to destroy structures. Get your point that it's here and part of the game though.
---
Initially, nullsec was not intended to be a safe place to afk multibox rorqs.
---
I do not think that word means what you think it means
---
Wtf lol. When I was in nullsec the two most cancerous things were cyno capabilities of having an entire carrier group land on your head at any moment which is the most powerful thing in gaming second only to god mode and the fact the second you flew somewhere everyone docked up. You speak like changing those thing to bring the pvpers back into the game is anything comparable to totally destroying pvp content generation in wh space. That would actually make it safer...if the chain is dead it means we can run it all day without worry.
---
And yeah no shit a 30-50 man wh corp is going to dock up when a fleet that size shows up. What are they going to do against it? A lot of wh PvP corps enjoy the restrictions on limit. It prevents totally one sided fights and fair fights are actually possible. Like don't get me wrong, stomping is fun but get so bland so quick. The excitement of a good balanced fight is the best part. Unfortunately wh space is the only area in eve this is really possible due to the mass and lack of cynos.
---
Remember that, when you complain about a hole opening in a dead region and you complain you have to gate to find content. It takes knowledge and perserverence.
---
This post is so wrong and uninformed. All wormholes have max mass per jump and total jump mass. This is what prevents supers from jumping through.
---
Maybe ungrouping every gun has some advantages when some guns burn out faster than others :3
---
That's hyperbole and you know it.
---
There is nothing psychological about invisible ships with a cyno and 200 bombers arriving. That is a physical interaction.
---
Actually this is a really good idea for right now. That could have some interesting implications. Can't be too powerful though.
---
You are gloating, yet still crying salty tears.  Love it.
---
&gt; as opposed to asking experts
---
Like who? The retards who populate this shithole?
---
Omg the nullsec salt in here! And the "no u" deflections! Its just so tasty!
---
I want to play too! Ok no mass limits, cool. So you can get anywhere you want now with any size of fleet so we don't need those silly old cyno thingies anymore (they will be useless shortly anyway right?) so we'll just take those out, ok?
---
What's the other thing u wanted? Oh yeah parity with WH pve? No problem! Whenever you run a nullsec anomaly it'll instantly respawn...in a random nullsec system, it'll be just like WH pve! Ran out of sites? No worries just gate around till you find that dead system they've all been stacking up in! We still cool?
---
So the biggest corp in eve online inhabiting ~100+ systems didn't make as much as the 2600+ wormhole systems with thousands of corporations combined? WoW
---
yeah this is right. although if CCP make farmholes riskier they should just auto-spawn a new static even if its not warped to. currently this change fucks over groups rolling for content just as much
---
Does the MER blue loot count include red loot?
---
Its querns, no one is shocked
---
Malcanis' Law at work.
---
Let's put that into perspective.   
---
All of WH space combined, with thousands of systems, hundreds of corporations, where the average member is much, MUCH more involved and active than in k-space, and said people risk EVERYTHING they have in citadels with no asset safety, made *only* 3 times more than all the overseer effects sold in game.   
---
 And that doesn't even count the value of bounties and additional loot you get from escalations and DEDs in k-space.  
---
Yeah...The Problem? This ain't it, chief.  
---
If you want to nerf WH PvE, put scrams in WH sites so that risk averse rattlesnakes can't just MJD away, and remove astrahaus farming. Honestly, what the fuck, CCP? Why is it even possible to PvE with a structure.
---
Thanks for this, useful.
---
I will read your wall of text.. and not try to poke fun. But yea, actually it is about difference of playstyle. You are OK with blackout impacting 60 % of the population or better but don't want a drastic change that impacts the play style of 3 to 5 % of the game. That's not really a cool thing.
---
You get em stainguy
---
None.  We get holes literally 1-2 jumps outside jita and we see no one jumping them.
---
and there are some in the gamedata that actually allow the mass of a super of which one has actually been seen before which doesn't allow supers to pass. now granted it wasnt a hole leading to w-space i don't see why the others should magically work if they ever happen to actually spawn if that one does not.
---
Yea, null had local. That was kinda how it all worked. Now it's different. This will also be different.
---
I think the past few MERs had a breakdown of blue loot vs red loot, haven't had a chance to look this one over but it'd be weird if they didn't list that.
---
Faxs in lower class wormholes are a pain in the arse. Its way easier to kill the response faxs in the null umbrella.
---
If I'm not mistaken CCP is changing auto-targeting missiles to force more asset commitment  to WH ratting  
---
Also the recent "All areas need attention" statement from CCP on WHs I'd wager they know this and will adjust it as they see fit in the near future
---
Nothing on info is just making it impossible not to get rolled out, I don't think that's a good idea. 50% is a bit much for me but I wouldn't object too much if that's what they went with.
---
No, you wish they wouldn't change wormholes so that they will have imminently more pvp content coming their way.
---
Yeah, you're a moron.
---
&gt; We have always hoped streamers would stream our game. 
---
Oh damn who's gonna tell him guys ROFL ohh n0n0n0
---
&gt;Bounties didnt work like we wanted. We like the idea of them but it's not working well. We want to change it to fix it so you could be a bounty hunter. Everyone loves boba fett. 
---
Member when bounty system was ridiculed as useless in 2007 ^(and probably before that too) ? I member. Things sure have changed in 12 year---wait...
---
i can't see this being made in a way that gives any sort of interesting gameplay to the guys piloting the ship. Titans are already one of the lowest apm boats in a game that requires pretty much zero mechanical execution in most situation where said titan would be used.
---
yeah sorry we aren't interested in fighting your supers with our caps
---
They were always able to be stored there. Before citadels it wasn't a problem. 
---
The major change came to supers, my recommendation is meant to balance their risk back to what they were originally intended to have.
---
Pretty sure red loot comes under "Other"  
---
Which totaled 6T, by the way. 12T was specified as Sleeper components.
---
It's not about trying to be excluded from the chaos, but preventing holes from being rolled doesn't make J space more chaotic or more suitable for PVP. It actually makes it safer - fewer people rolling into your krab hole, and 95% of the time the static is not active - and less suitable for hunting. It would be exactly the opposite of adding chaos to wormholes.
---
It's important to state at this point in the discussion that *this isn't actually what Hilmar said* and I'm sure they realise it would be a bad idea.
---
Our program of outreach and investment in traditionally disadvantaged communities is heart warmingly successful!
---
Don't be jealous
---
I take it you see this happen to you daily, yes?
---
&gt;has never lived in a wormhole
---
&gt;no its not
---
LUL
---
And the only way to find that entrance is to scan all of new eden vs chain rolling. Mass limits are important to Wormhole geography and scale. If you remove mass limits you remove the primary thing that makes wormholes unique from a combat perspective since mass efficient stops being a factor and fights are not scaled to mass limits.
---
Would essentially turn wormholes into less convenient null sec with Higher value lower frequency sites and no asset safety. Would make living in them largely pointless as well since you would be better served farming wormholes from null since you can just shove your ratting setup into the holes without concern.
---
none of the big ones do. no one does PvE in chain
---
hey aren't you guys getting evicted
---
I see the pings for it on one of two discords 5 days out of 7 (5-10 different dudes getting caught per day), for the last 12 months. So - yes.
---
You also lose everything in evictions. K-space doesn't have that.  
---
There are plenty of changes to make WH PvE more risky that WHers have called for for literally years.
---
No i input broadcast 80 bombers
---
yeah i can't wait for 50 vs 250 content. don't forget to bring your supers too
---
Who could have possibly seen that coming? Definitely not CCP!
---
I mean, I'll space bushido you with battleships vs. battleships. If our fleet wipes, we'll just come back with 200 more. I'm cool with things dying.
---
those russians are something else let me tell ya
---
So you're not getting caught but you're afraid of it. Sounds like a lovely psychological effect.
---
&gt;Project Discovery was made by interns and some of that UI is better than most of Eve.
---
Heh
---
Ah, I hadn't seen the separation between these in the "Faucet Breakdown" graph. Thanks!   
---
I assume both go into the broader "Commodity - NPC Market" number on the Sinks and Faucets graph; that 22t total looks right.
---
its the grr gon hat gon crowd, nothing to worry about
---
Just have to adapt how you see it and still take it as a good opportunity for a home with a non-permanent exit.
---
hey we found a rorq and got 20 supers dropped on us. was great content 10/10 would do again
---
Add quantity of citadels per region to the monthly economic report /u/ccp_falcon
---
Hey, we had 100 dudes drop on our solo carrier. Was great content 10/10 would do again.
---
I'm not saying this is what I want, but this is about what I expect
---
I really hope not because battle rorqs are dumb and shouldn't be encouraged.
---
Doest the 12t include Overseers? 
---
Are we gonna aknowledge that bounties isnt all of the income?  What about DEDs, Faction spawns, Capital spawns, Officers?
---
Just adapt lmao.
---
Praise you dude!
---
You gudpost. You dumbpost. This is the later. I¬¥m sure you¬¥ll figure out why eventually.
---
&gt;directly into 1DQ
---
&gt;250-man fleet forms and jumps the hole
---
&gt;max ping all carriers
---
&gt;100 carrier fleet forms and jumps the hole
---
yeah i'm gonna log off
---
There is a distinct difference between being aware something is occurring, because you see pings when you are at work, and actually being impacted by it. I mean, nice try wanting to pretend to be all big and bad space scary.. but no.
---
&gt; Eve wasn't ever meant to be a passive at work activity.
---
You may be right, but it evolved to be that way for some. And the only reason I engaged (past tense) in passive activities was so I could have fun with the active ones later on.
---
&gt; And nullsec is MEANT TO BE DANGEROUS AS FUCK.
---
[citation needed]
---
I've been playing off and on since 2006 and nullsec sovereignty has ALWAYS been billed as a place for corporations to make their own space. Can it be dangerous? Sure, if you don't defend it. But taking away local is just trying to mimic wormholes. Wormholes are meant to be the most dangerous part of space.
---
&gt;  If you want that life go to highsec and earn the appropriate amount of money for your low investment into the game.
---
If 'low investment' is 20+ hours a week then you're bent, my friend. It's a game. Whether you agree or not is irrelevant because you're not the only person playing it. 
---
Doesn't matter though, you'll get what you want. A null full of so-called elite PVPers just cloaky camping each other. Have fun.
---
Because it means the game will have players logging back in after a while that they've been unable to play/didn't feel the urge, to have all their stuff gone.
---
That will make people quit. Nobody should be punished for being unable to play due to real life. Many people cannot play constantly/must take long breaks for work etc
---
Safety was added so people would live in player owned null, instead of being based out of NPC stations or high sec. Removing it now will reverse that, and cause many people to leave null/move their items elsewhere. Once the feature was added, it makes no sense to remove it.  Sure charge higher fees etc, but removing it will do more harm than good.
---
We'll just adapt.
---
&gt; nice try wanting to pretend to be all big and bad space scary.. but no.
---
What do you mean?
---
oh my this guy has never lived inside a wormhole
---
Your statement regarding a psychological impact amigo.
---
I'm a little guy too. I'll be just fine playing some other game.
---
I love CCP and the Chaos Era changes they've been making recently. But  by God some of these are some of the worst ideas I've ever had the misfortune of hearing. What's next, bringing back learning skills?
---
But why would anyone live in wormhole that are effectively NS systems without TCUs and IHubs?  
---
Making them too similar would just make one of them obsolete which would likely be wormholes in this case.
---
Also, it's most likely not gonna be that different tbh, sounds more like tweaks to rolling rather than anything else, meaning an inconvenience most likely but not anything that would fuck it up completely.   
---
I'm really just arguing for more specific annoyances for pve rather than pvp. 
---
This is all a very interesting conversation, you can really feel all the repressed NS anger getting let out, but like they didn't really say that they would remove rolling rather that it was too easy as is.
---
It's not.
---
Don't need to live in a wormhole to know about not being lazy and taking 40 gates to get somewhere.
---
As soon a Star Citizen or something similar gets it's shite together guess what?
---
Finished the trilogy. I have some dislikes but overall would recommend.
---
Why would you live in null if you wanted no local and no asset safety and no cynos etc... you would live in a WH.. but they just changed all of that. Just like they are going to change wh.
---
You'll still be able to do that with a covert cyno, won't you? They haven't taken that change away?
---
In fact I understand quite well how PLEX works.  It isn't a "debt" it is a subscription, which is similar, but has it's own subset of accounting since a debt is collect-able but a subscription is usually not.  
---
That said, you don't know if the new owners care about revenue or cashflow.  Subscriptions = cashflow.  The money paid is cash, it will convert to revenue when it is redeemed.  The guy who bought plex to redeem the PLEX for game time increased revenue.  he did not provide the cash.  
---
Here is what you tell the accounting team: Cash is king.
---
why do you think we're in wormholes. we love pvp when its fun. its not fun pvp when we have 50 dudes and you bring 100 caps and say "hurr durr where is the pvp content at"
---
It'll happen, just have patience . .
---
The trick is to use the same email on every account, as they apparently only send out one mail per address.
---
Nope, those are probably the new orders he got from Pearl Abyss.
---
See, that's not ok. You are perfectly ok with it being fine to roll a hole and drop 20 or 50 dudes on someone and outnumber him 50 to 1 whenever you choose.. but not ok with someone doing it to you with 2 or 3x your numbers. That's called bullshit.
---
nullsec changes hurt krabs and bots exclusively. if your spodbrain actually understood wormhole mechanics then you'd realize this change hurts pvp groups more than krabs
---
And sometimes it's impossible because they were towards a sig which was outside the normal envelope of the system.
---
Depends what you do. 
---
If your favourite pastime is the abyss with a gila, and you don't leave a station without a full rack of T2 mediums, then racial drone is definitely worth it.
---
If you only ever station trade.. then no.
---
If they're easy to get to then people blow them up.
---
you ll buy a skill injector and boom you be back in the ship. PA's hand.
---
Initially titans/supers werent intended to be an assets of anyone with half a brain either... but here we are
---
why ravens when you can bring the caps?
---
&gt; 2) the PVP content still takes too long to find. Yeah you may get to frag a frigate in the hour of play if you are lucky
---
literally just go to amamake and its surroundings or tama and its surroundings, ofc if you go to fucking tash-murkon or some shit ya ain't finding shit
---
Battle of Asakai? Maybe, at least can't find the killmail for it. This one however apparently did the same thing and died: https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/8q65qq/titan_hits_jump_instead_of_bridge_panic_ensues/
---
They are the same address. Each one to a different account name.
---
neverending respawn of mineral resources in null, along with unlimited manufacture slots have definitely exacerbated the situation
---
invansions and ganks should obviously be of similar effort
---
Fair enough. So inflation/deflation is an effect/byproduct/indicator of a wider economic situation. And either inflation or deflation can indicate either a good or bad economic situation depending on perspective and context. It's not necessarily a primary cause of anything, it is the effect. I guess I knew that but I didn't connect the dots.
---
On that basis, in context, the severe decrease in inflation, or slight deflation (depending on whether we count the active isk delta) in the MER, is just an indicator of a change. Obviously that change being that less wealth (both liquid isk and mined resources) is being generated in null, or that less goods are being demanded. Not necessarily whether that change is good or bad.
---
Did I ever make any statements about me being big and scary? Everything I said about psychological effects is general in nature (or at least that's how I read it). I don't need or want anyone to be afraid of me. Quite the contrary, when people feel safe they're easier to kill :)... Oh, and I seldom visit 0.0. Not my kind of content anymore.
---
Bro.. pvp content is pvp content. Don't get all soft on me.
---
The first graph *probably* has per-day values. If you look at the graph for June, it hovers at around 1.6T ISK for the whole month. The [equivalent of the 2nd graph for June](https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/XsAHJlfgwVSMOUDzyThst/e0df31dea0ea1be2241ebadf17586987/9a_sinksfaucets.png) says bounty total for the month was 48T ISK. 30*1.6=48‚àé
---
Because once the structures are bashed and loot collected you can thunderdome the ravens and pod yourself home on the cheap while you can't do that with caps.
---
Like i said, bunch of domestic terrorist pussies. You'll chase down and hit old men, children, and journalists from behind with tire irons and hammers while covering your faces but you cowards would never pull that shit where people can defend themselves. 
---
There isn't any way what-so-ever any of you can justify any of the violence. Fucking coward pussies.
---
Exactly, we got stupid little mobile games for fiddling around a bit. EVE shouldn't fill that role, and if we lose some players because it did for to long then fine. I'm optimistic EVE can regain other types of players. 
---
Also, as said, there remain things you can do semi afk, just not in what's ment to be somewhat endgame content.
---
Here is some math for you. 
---
Delve has 97 systems, there are 2500 wormholes.   I knew I would regret upvoting one of your posts last week
---
okay, so you do get it.
---
so why does it matter where the actual dollars come from if ccp is still getting the money in the end
---
if i break the rules of the game and give a friend 2b and get him to buy a subscription for me, that is still a subscription applied to my account. it is ccp getting money in exchange for giving me subscription time.
---
if i add a layer of abstraction to this process, it is still exactly the same.
---
no he doesn¬¥t. he was busy afk ratting.
---
My general rule of thumb is to try to train everything to IV at minimum, III at absolute minimum. Then V if I use it constantly, if it's a basic skill, or if it's basically required (eg. Logi V).
---
This was taken *wildly* out of context.
---
How do your comms work? Is elo FCing and getting translated?
---
Don't sell it as an old game.  Sell it as a complex game with lots of areas where team play works, where they can find a role on other teams, and where a "small" fight has 20 nerds on each side, with wars of hundreds or thousands/side being possible.  And where decisions have consequences, which increases the rewarding feeling from achievement.
---
If your friends don't like complexity they shouldn't be playing EvE
---
Epic arcs. 4 in high sec, 2 in null. Can be done relatively fast, gets you some nice payout. And each once every 3 month's. That's pretty much what you are asking for, isn't it? It can be done on an alt on the same account with some training.
---
30 / 0.5 = 60 tho.
---
That is weird, indeed. For some reason they don't spam me. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Are you the same one who knows shite about business or someother little clueless shite? Not really paying attention as to who is who. I FULLY expect more of you to pop up. No shites given. For some reason you will state facts proven over time to some people and they will retort with bullshite, like you just did.
---
I don't like my chosen play style fucked with AFTER the fact.
---
My rules for gaming are the same as my rules for life:
---
Don't fuck with my toys after I acquire them.
---
Don't fuck with my chosen playstyle/business most ESPECIALLY just because some shite for brains bitches about it.
---
Same reason I won't buy a particular high end real world vehicle I was interested in UNTIL I found out the builder had remotely, yes, NERFED the damn thing AFTER the fact, so I'll never buy a damn thing from them.
---
Actually I chip every vehicle I buy anyway since a lot of them are sold nerfed in one way or another. Yeah it voids the engine warranty but no shites given.
---
only ppl who do ratting in a sub cap get hurt from blackout.
---
Is this what the "EvE iZ dEaD" brigade is down to? Taking shit wildly out of context?           
---
Why don't you criticise some of the other questionable things they *actually* said, instead of taking single quotes out of context?
---
You can also build them in C3 and above, right?
---
r/iamverybadass
---
There‚Äôre always google ads out for the game, but it‚Äôs pretty poor, like ‚ÄúBuy Plex!‚Äù. I think it‚Äôs more to remind people who have considered playing or quit that it still exists.
---
Crying is only bad when 
---
^wipes ^bitter, ^salty ^tears ^of ^rage ^from ^his ^eyes
---
They're doing it!
---
Logged out in space is fine actually. They end up logged on a POS or tetherable struct... Which may not be there anymore when they log back in.
---
Does that actually do anything?  PYFA numbers don't change when I do it
---
Sounds awful, go live in null if you love it so much.
---
yeah, because you can't leave a cloaky eyes in someone's hole to seed it for a later date. you can sneak hundreds of bombers or T3Ds into a hole before anyone would notice.  You guys have the number advantage.
---
I mean, you chose to get multiple accounts. And how hard is it really to select multiple emails at once?
---
Yep, can confirm they def spammed...
---
40k people vs the 12 people living in wormholes :P
---
"Peak"?  I'm not sure how much more "peak" dps can be given I overheated the guns to the last possible point of burning them out. What does "peak" mean to you?
---
"Alpha"?  Maybe I don't, please explain
---
Htfu?
---
I'd probably recommend he see a therapist too. Writing a shit-tier essay like that isn't something people of sound mind do.
---
yeah we're completely fine with blobbing the fuck out of krabs. you're in a rorq = don't be surprised if 50 dudes land on you and you have to PANIC and light a cyno.
---
and you're not really being outnumbered because you know you have a supercap umbrella ready to jump in within 10 minutes.
---
I have many. I get one email. Wierd
---
So you only want your play style buffed and don't care about anyone else. And you want easy content delivered to you.
---
it does not help once the RAH is spooled, while it is adjusting the faster cycle time makes it set to the incoming damage faster
---
As a frigate pvp'er, I sometime die 5+ times in an hour.
---
There is a way to link accounts but I don't know how. The accounts I frequently use are linked but the one which I created way before isn't, so it got another mail.
---
That isn't the transaction.  The PLEX is a fungible commodity bought by someone with real $.  It doesn't matter how it was redeemed, the person who redeemed it, if they didn't buy it with $, didn't get CCP any cash.  They merely created a demand for someone to buy the PLEX.  That isn't inconsequential, but it also isn't the transaction, in other words, on the macro level, it isn't what matters.  If you created too much of a demand for PLEX, the people paying RL $ for it are getting more than they would have otherwise, Ceritus Paribus (all else being equal), and hence reduced the amount of PLEX they need to buy and the amount of $ CCP receives.
---
I am not arguing this is what is happening as I don't have the figures.  But PLEX inflation coupled with material deflation certainly makes it FEEL like that is quite probable.  IOW, a TITAN was once seriously expensive, at hundreds of months of gametime.  recently it was more like 25-30?
---
No
---
Hm, gonna make life hard for armadas in bombers bar
---
Fun vid. 
---
Keep captions up just a second longer. 
---
If u can, focus camera in on the dying ship. 
---
I am curious about your Condor fits - u have different ewar on each? We run a similar type of thing where we do an Astero swarm. Much lolz.
---
Ok, as long as your consistent that works for me.
---
I'm cool with things dying. I however have a slight suspicion that yall are gonna just bring 1000 dudes and ref all the things
---
init is the wife in this relationship while syndicate moons are the abusing husband, they might leave them for a while but always come back
---
Like if there was massless wormhole any rando 2k man fleet could wander thru  the normal n+1 mechanics present in NS would become just as needed in wormholes so it would really just be the same shit with some additional risk and hassles for no reason.
---
Yes, they are going to change wormholes, but seemingly they aren't set on what changes they actually need to do. A lot of people have ideas which is always good and they post them here. The part i don't get is the part where this hurts your anus somehow. 
---
Null pve got shafted, null pvp didn't. But you want the entirety of wormhole space to get shafted because you're mad. I heard wormholes are pretty good btw, you could always move into one.
---
Like cynos are still a thing, but they arent't gonna be a 1 click safety net anymore.   
---
Wormhole space changes should be stuff like c5 site scrams instead of points, removed astra farming. FOF ratting got fixed like a day or two ago so they are already on it.  
---
This is all about risk/reward, and CCP is nerfing anything that makes somewhat afkable ISK
---
\&gt;mfw im in this corp and was there for the whole thing...  
---
Frozenar you were the problem...  
---
\-End Transmission-
---
Battlemoons.
---
Yup. Of all the things that would make me stop playing, that is it. Sounds like the worst idea ever posted on Reddit and i am not sure anyone has been retarded enough to recommend it. My God
---
I think injectors are kindof a crutch, yes ofc never adding them in the first place would‚Äôve been good, but there are also other ways to reduce super proliferation and CCP will never remove injectors, it‚Äôs not really realistic to expect them to
---
Or follow the chain and find something else? Maybe work for your content instead of thinking it should connect to your home system.
---
Eh, I don't think so. There's never not a chain leading from K-space to ones wormhole. Might take a little to scan but they are always there. If anything having the door always open I think would lead into more content. With so many connections and statics a new sig can appear is system at any time. It's more RNG and less control.
---
IRON CROWN IS GONE  ü¶Ä  ü¶Ä  ü¶Ä
---
bashing structures. hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm no thanks, ill pass on this amazing "pvp content"
---
Alpha damage is the damage applied only in the very first salvo. Nobody ever talks about "beta" damage, but that would be your DoT/DPS.
---
We can come blob in rorquals if you want?
---
Lol
---
An entire class of space, with thousands of systems, produced around 40% as much ISK as a single coalition of nullblobbers in what, 100 systems. And you think it's the wormholes that need the nerf.
---
Do you honestly think that people who live in a wh with a nullsec static, do so because they wanted the ez life?
---
Do you think that people who live in such a hole for the pvp content it provides, were too lazy to be bothered with putting effort into finding small/medium sized gang content in other ways before they moved into a wh?
---
Do you think at all?
---
Very close fight.
---
When you get to a certain skill point yes I agree, but when you're just starting out and for quite a while after then you want to be "pretty good" at most things instead of "spectacular" at one thing.
---
Roughly speaking, I think Lv3 is 4% of the time for 60% of the benefit; Lv4 is 20% of the time for 80% of the benefit, so when you're low on SP you have to really consider if that last 20% of the benefit is worth 80% of the time.
---
Sounds like good content.
---
The only thing I've seen of late was the HIC change which WHers seemed to throw a fit over. It messed with rolling holes for profit and PVP. It also made living in a WH more dangerous.
---
Buddy, if I don't get to see my space get shafted without hearing a hundred holers to shut the fuck up, you better believe I am going to enjoy seeing chaos hit your space.
---
Very nice tool, already tried it multiple times
---
Damn these Trump Chyna tweets are really doing damage
---
Thanks for the loot.
---
1. how in any way is that an umbrella. thats 1 hole. does your spodbrain really think faxes are more oppressive than supers
---
2. this is why we wormholes hate c4s
---
3. yeah good luck killing null faxes without a dreadbomb which we all know wormholes have access to, being in wormholes with super super good industry
---
4. form a leshak fleet.
---
I think that you are trying to argue a point I don't care about.
---
As long as you have an instadock and insta-undock and can MWD+cloak on the Perimeter gate you should be fine.
---
Oh wow did not know that, thanks!  How many cycles would you typically OH it for?
---
It is Jita price, this guy is being Silly lol  
---
\-member of said corp OP is trying to bash
---
 This guy gets it.
---
That makes a lot of sense, thanks!
---
Well said. After spending 9 hours at work at a desk, I have a hard time convincing myself to sit at my computer and play eve for a few hours. Especially knowing that conflict I am used to getting involved in (gate camps, small roaming skirmishes, sov trolling) has a low chance of happening. That has made it easier for me to just not sit at my desk and go watch TV. If I do sit at my desk its tinkering around in other games.
---
I don't listen to podcasts, generally, but I did play most of that one with him and Falcon on TIS a month or so back.
---
They basically admitted what you just said: over the years they've put a lot of effort into trying to engineer outcomes in the game with their changes, and for the most part it hasn't worked. So now they're just trying shit to see what happens. On the theory that If You Push Something Hard Enough, It Will Fall Over.
---
&gt;There‚Äôs a cull coming. We‚Äôre already seeing the signs.
---
If this is true, hopefully they'll start with the bottom tier of eve shitposters, such as yourself.
---
If I could physically punish you for writing this drivel, I would.
---
Perhaps if you left The Initative there would be more targets for you to attack? Given that they are blue to half the EVE universe. 
---
In my perspective I have had no issue finding targets. In under 30 minutes I can find people to shoot in lowsec or nullsec.
---
you admit that you currently blob via supercap umbrella and would love to blob more via unlimited-mass wormholes? nice
---
You just stated next door to your staging system the fix is in their called gates caps can use them.
---
HPP?
---
This is why the real life new people I brought to eve quit.
---
I admit that I like fleet combat of a larger size and would like to come fight!
---
Maybe i remembered wrong. But from memory "mooring" originally was described as big ships being able to be attached to structures and be seen from the outside.     
---
That basically implied a limited amount of slots per structure.
---
I didn't even get 1 mail from them.
---
Null faucets are balanced by risk.
---
Now it's time to balance wh faucets by risk.
---
Frankly wormholers are way less resistant to the idea of more farm ships dying than nullseccers.
---
Content would always be there. A single system in null cannot support more then 2-3 supers ratting at once. The re spawn timer ensure this. You have to venture out to different systems to find and empty on to rat in.
---
Wormholes should be no different, you should have to venture down any possible chains to find content (even more so with the amount of isk that can be made) rather then just rely on rolling the your static connection.
---
Sure, i still have some years left i hope.
---
The problem is how Supers and Titans apply damage to supcaps. Not How many of them exist.
---
&gt;The numbers are going to be down and due to this a legion of screeching morons are going to take those numbers and declare to the heavens that CCP is killing the game, even though judging overall health of the game by MER is even more of a flawed metric than PCU.
---
Oh hey, I was right again, it's already starting.
---
Addendum: but \*god fucking forbid\* C5 sites get scrams
---
Hippo?
---
If that K space exit is in Aridia or Solitude or something though it won't get any traffic.
---
&gt; With so many connections and statics a new sig can appear is system at any time
---
Removing the ability to roll would slow wormhole generation - every roll generates a new static.
---
sounds like a straightforward way to say "if you can't blob like nullsec does then get out of my game - AdApT oR DiE"
---
But... Wormhole already have that and much more. This is would be a large stripping of mechanics from the space that make it unique.
---
a USTZ FC takes the duty of CNTZ standing fleet would be respectful. 
---
Though pipebomb is wonderful, "This mission is approved by Lord Maldoror" is funny, TFW reading meme "cloud leadership".
---
anyway, RNK please come back to TQ to prove it.
---
How close can two astrahus be anchored to one another?
---
I am not trying to argue anything. I find it extremely hypocritical that an Initiative line member, who takes advantage of jf services, fleets and content served at his plate, titan rides back home cause *gates are for plebs* finds it in him to call out nerds for being lazy in their effort to find content, because they went to live in a wh and they want to be able to roll their null static.
---
laughable
---
No. Fuck no. Hell fucking no. Have you interacted with any of the NPC mining fleets yet? They already strip entire systems clean after DT every day. If you are in US TZ, the NPC mining fleets leave you scraps in the belts every day. Immersive? Makes the world come alive? Nope - literally just the AI taking resources out of your home systems.
---
Right in 2013 if you had a titan, you had a large dickstar or 2, you had a dedicated pilot and possibly a holding toon. Plus a covops logged off on grid with your titan POS.
---
And it was not uncommon for a whole second tier alliance to have only a couple titans used for bridging only.
---
Hell, I was in a small independent corp in npc null and we had cloakies/eyes on every titan POS we knew about in bridge range. Nowadays, that'd be pointless. No one's gonna bridge a fleet onto you, they'll just jump 20 titans.
---
Please don't engage Sharnhorst. He's a bad-faith piece of shit. Not worth it.
---
It‚Äôd be hilarious if instadocks end up inside the new model and work like the old sun bounces, ejecting freighters at thousands of km per second.
---
I mean, if you can't handle your hole.. maybe you could head up to high sec?
---
wait you have no idea how wormhole life works. no one rolls their static for PvE. no one PvEs in chain.
---
Like.. blackout going into null?
---
Hey buddy, you are trying to make this about me and my alliance. I'm just a dude that will enjoy this change. If you don't like that, harden the fuck up or go to high sec.

Now to a shrugging wormholer "LMAO FUCKING OWNED XDDDDD LOOK AT HOW BAD CHAOS ERA IS"
---
/me wonders if there will be more office space after the renovation.
---
Heh, make targeted DD temporarily polarize the titan. Like 90 second of polarization on an exponential decay, starts at 0% resists and scales back to 100% of active resists over 90 seconds.
---
Basically, yeah.
---
1. im calling it a FAX umbrella because i think its a funny name for faxs in wormholes. 
---
3. faxs are a pain in the arse in all classes
---
3. you can kill FAX easily in null with stukas even with supers on field since they are no where near as pimpfit.
---
7. fuck trig shit. 
---
Seriously though since the ancillary nerfs Faxs cant tank as well. The stacking penalties on multiple fax reps are also great but dont apply to the small scale WH fights, its really difficult to get the ships on field to brake their tanks quick enough. Honestly i got a major chip on my shoulder when it comes to FAXs in general.
---
I think it shifts by 1%/cycle, so for fighting a brutix probably 10ish cycles?
---
To a MUCH smaller degree since local doesn't shape the space in null. But I suppose you can argue removing it is removing the mechanic for the purposes of intel gathering.
---
Sorry most of the playerbase is more interested in being a nullsec f1 monkey which means we don't have 1000 bodies to throw around?
---
&gt; And why do you use the arrows
---
Constrained 1-direction drag. Slower but more precise.
---
I hate the idea too.  But at least people are trying out ideas....  don't stop the iteration because you are pursuing perfection.
---
This thread is just more proof that the eve reddit is dominated by bitter WHers who have nothing better to do than try and change the game to their playstyle, while nerfing anything that threatens them.
---
Outside of fucking with SP gain and the ship lockout suggestion most of this seemed pretty positive to me. SP loss is cancer and we should absolutely never be locked out of ships for any reason that we have the skills to fly.
---
Same here.
---
Enlighten me, I seem to have missed when Legacy alligned with northern forces during strategic operations.
---
whatever while I don't want to pick sides on the changes in this thread if we don't hold some sort of weight to what they are saying then nothing gets discussed and ccp makes more changes that people highly dislike or are against.
---
Halfway thru my first bag of it
---
I've experienced those days in a super. I wouldn't mind adding more adventure and uncertainty to the handling of supers again, but that's probably just nostalgia and doesn't fix the problem of titan proliferation that is already out of hand.    
---
Honestly, I don't know if Snuff/PL currently own a Keepstar, but let me tell you: It's fucking great! You dock at a decently stocked market, buy what you need, refit and reload and be on your way in a matter of minutes. No clumsy shuttling with a second character and refitting with a second ship.         
---
Taking that away from us might make the grr-goon destroyer pilots happy, but it doesn't fix the issue.             
---
Maybe those mooring ideas, that have been thrown around, can be a compromise that limits the storage of empty supers and titans while also providing the comfort of a Keepstar.
---
I guess we'll have to wait and see how it's gonna be, but i highly doubt it's gonna as annoying for me as the current null changes are to you. I just want to pew, so if CCP doesn't make it ultra hard to pvp im good tbh.
---
Most super/titans wouldn‚Äôt care. Only one I can think of that might have an issue is the avatar due to very bad cpu.
---
Normal capitals would have to really check on it.
---
6000+ wormholes, many with statics leading to high class space. A K162 can pop up at anytime. Either way wormholes are way to complacent hiding away krabbing in safety, picking which fights you want or don't want. Like Null, I agree it needs a shake up to make it more risk adverse and less safe. Why should it only be null that has all the fun?
---
TIL faxes that are "pimpfit" are harder to kill. Really makes you think.
---
if its really that hard for you to for a 20-man leshak fleet then you have much bigger problems than FaXeS So BrOkeN
---
Samsies. Wormholer btw
---
&gt;Never seen Lachesis used as primary tackle when hunting
---
Well, if you were having trouble landing tackle because of dscan, it would be logical to bring a recon to get initial tackle.
---
&gt;Fit tank to them then
---
We do.  They're still flimsy.
---
&gt;You seriously overestimate the manpower of the vast majority of WH groups.
---
You seriously overestimate the tank of a solo carrier.
---
&gt;Carrier still has a major advantage of being tough and hard-hitting.
---
Except for that "tough" part.  Add a little ewar and you've also taken care of hard-hitting.
---
&gt;Blackout didn't do shit here, just look at YOUR replies, not one is related to blackout
---
Uh, we are talking about how to avoid dscan.  When local existed, dscan wasn't necessary.  Try to keep up.
---
&gt;What your replies show though, is the chaos surrounding trying to kill capital ratters. CCP - op success.
---
Only if you're so out-of-touch you didn't think they were dying before the changes.
---
oh, you mean the loot that isn't mine that you most likely didn't get any of rather your alliances wallet did, np muhman
---
That makes me smile
---
Mark as spam
---
The erebus has similar CPU issues when you start fitting a phenomena generator, the levi has some PG issues unless you fit power diags, but overall i think if the module made you choose between a having a cyno and 3 guns or no cyno and 6 guns it would at least be a step in the right direction.
---
the other altnerative to this is to remove cynos from supers and titans and only allow carriers/dreads/fax to fit them with increased fitting cost so you had to choose. im a fan of either of those options
---
No thank you
---
‚ÄúNuLl FaUcEtS ArE OuT Of CoNtRoL‚Äù
---
&lt;provides proof that a very small minority of players our produce mega coalition income in nullsec without supercaps to blame&gt;
---
and then every wormholer comes here begging for people to look away and pretend it‚Äôs different.
---
Amazing
---
no, thank you.
---
I feel assaulted
---
I dont make things as spam if I actively pay them, not q great idea, hence why this free skill weekend is actually the most annoying shit ive seen
---
Well, I don't think there's anything to gain from further banter. Have a nice afternoon.
---
Preventing your neighbors from building empires.
---
I thought that was the goal at this point tbh
---
I mean you still have to do the work of scanning and other, bigger enemies, can hunt you down as well. So, +risk for everyone.
---
how is that "implied"?
---
You know what, my point of view is totaly wrong FAX is perfectly balanced because we got all these other perfectly balanced trig ships. Oh boy i do feel silly.
---
[you could just click the link in the mail to not get any mails anymore](https://imgur.com/EaYMy06)
---
1000km or so.
---
Unlike your posting
---
I can think of a few ways to actually do it that wouldn't be am absolute ass fucking to WH. But then again, my null opinion probably means little.
---
&gt;might even be aligned and warp off once they show up on grid. also might look out for sigs so you don¬¥t land right in them.
---
Recons land pretty fast, and ratting is mind-numbing.  You're gonna catch a lot who stop mashing dscan constantly.
---
Also....not land on sigs?  You think they're warping to 0 on combat anoms?
---
&gt;by choice
---
Nope.  Tank on a solo carrier is not terribly good, even when fit for tank.
---
&gt;neuts are a thing
---
Golly, perhaps you could bring three ships with a point then.  You only need to keep one up.
---
&gt;kill it
---
Be competent.  It's not like we use sabres on empty grids.
---
&gt;but the reason why 90% of your carriers die when caught and plenty of them get caught in the first place is because they are piloted by fucking retarded krabs that couldn¬¥t fight their way out of a wet paperbag if their life depended on it.
---
If that were actually true, you guys wouldn't have spent years whining about us being able to cyno in a rescue fleet.
---
Right. Blackout only had a small impact.
---
Trying to make sense of this:
---
Salvo?
---
DoT?
---
Could you define for me please and thank you kindly.
---
I'm actively advocating more pvp.
---
I love all this free SP this is freaking fantastic!!
---
Kids these days. Why, when *I* first learned to scan, you only got *3 probes* with Astrometrics I: if you wanted all 8, you had to train it to V.
---
[Read this](http://eve.aeonoftime.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/beginners_guide_v1.6.pdf), reflect on how good you've got it, and shut the fuck up and eat your veggies.
---
Now that's a waste, there's a 100mn, idk, Nereus I think, all meta fit, costs maybe 5mil.
---
Sounds like the dumbest fucking idea in the world. It's so clear from this comment that CCP does not even play their own game. 
---
We roll holes for content. If you make it impossible roll holes, or even make it so unpredictable that you can't do it reliably without locking one of your pilots out, how exactly are we supposed to roll our chain when it's fucking dead and quiet and there's no other groups? 
---
Maybe think about the implications before throwing random shit at us. Change is good but this feels like they are just grasping at straws for a solution to their declining playing count hoping one of these things will stick.
---
Ccp is famous for never iterating. Until this actuslly happens we have to assume that this is the new norm and ccp won't backtrack in changes killing the game.
---
Extra bonus, if they do backtrack some won't come back for fear of being kicked in the face again by ccp.
---
you're actually just delusional if you think supercap umbrellas -- which prevent any kind of pvp (except for nano shit) on a regional scale -- are more oppressive than faxes in wormhole space which can't even shoot back and are simply unkillable and can't instantly teleport from hole to hole or even from citadel undock to grid. btw when was the last time goons lost a super in delve?
---
I wanted to make a few *extra* comments on this. 
---
I apologize. I get it. It must be hard when people can afford bigger and better toys than you, and then actually use them to defend the space that *this game allows them* to claim. 
---
You want to fix this so that you can wander around sov space, regardless of whether or not it is controlled and defended by 20k people, and be able to just kill anything that you see with no risk to yourself or your ships. This is typical of every eve player I think, complain that *your playstyle* is the best, but too hard, please nerf everyone else because it isn't fair. I understand; **HOWEVER...**
---
Your ideas that amount to, "let's put the genie back in the bottle and return EVE to circa 2008" are not going to work. A lot of you were here in 2008, but a lot more of you were not. Let me refresh your memory. 
---
All making supers and Titans undockable is going to do is going to make people return to coffined holding characters or dedicated super/titan alts. Basically, people have a character that holds the ship, and always stays logged off until the ship is needed. What this will accomplish is:
---
1. Goons will still have the most Titans (and still use them);
---
2. Large capital fights will happen less (I know you do not care about this, but CCP might);
---
3. You will force already EVE rich people to plex another account. Maybe that's enough for you, because all you really want to do is make individual people's lives a little more difficult. 
---
Titans will not drop out of structures, and incidentally the only people this mechanic could *potentially hurt is*, drum roll... smaller organizations; or do you really think you will ever be able to sail into 1-DQ1A and start making it rain Titans? 
---
In the final analysis, if you do not like what Super, Titan, and Rorqual proliferation has done to EVE, look no further than CCP and the implementation of skill injectors--and that ship has sailed, even if they cut them off now; and I know CCP Rise says, "hey would have just ended up here anyway in the long run," and that *might* be true, though frankly it probably isn't. The fact of the matter is, by adding skill injectors CCP enabled anyone with enough cash or enough space on their credit card to get into these ships and circumvent the *years* of training these ships used to require. Years I might add that during quite a few people either changed their minds about flying a super or Titan, or left the game before they could fly one. 
---
There is no turning back the clock though. The game has changed too much since 2008, and frankly speaking, I think you would find that, unlike WoW Classic, the vast majority of the people who play this game would leave if we had to go back to 2008 mechanics; and not only would they leave, but if they tried to come back to find out their stuff dropped out of citadels that were destroyed or moved because asset safety was turned off, would not bother. 
---
None of this is to say that there are things about this game that should not be balanced better, or changed, but rolling back to ships that cannot dock is a *terrible* idea--and so is trying to recapture the days of the small roving subcap gangs--and even wanting that is a testament to the human minds ability to remember a past the way it never was to justify the demands of the present. 
---
Also, let me LOL in advance to the down votes this will get.
---
Im so glad your Mother and I sent you to a good Catholic school.
---
by actively advocating purging of all small groups that can't muster a 1000-man blob. makes sense to me
---
Holes being able to be rolled reliably and quickly is what allows wormhole krabbing to be dangerous. If the initial change went through and rage rolling couldn't happen both wormholes ( and let's be honest, nullsec too would be a lot safer)
---
The only danger that would have been introduced had it gone live was more risk in loosing disposable rolling ships which nobody actually cares about, other than the annoyance of having to get the pod back home.
---
\&gt;harden the fuck up
---
the irony is palpable
---
Intentional.
---
Gotcha thanks for the advice!  Just won a match against a Cyclone and tried OHing it and it seemed like I tanked better at least.   Only lost 25% armor or so.
---
Ram jags are meant to be really fast (interceptor fast) and scram/web with enough tank to hold until the dps lands. No need to keep transversal low, just ram and the ADC and masb will let you tank 3000 dps for 15 seconds.
---
Nos so your tackle doesn't get neuted off.
---
The issue with just capping storage is "what happens if a player quits/dies".  If there's no good way to remove their ship, you're essentially stuck with your storage reduced by that many players.
---
goons last lost a avatar yesterday in delve. If you think every super umbrella is as stong and as capable as goons then your as delusional as i am.
---
Hey, you can always move. Have you every tried out low sec?
---
Is this real?
---
It only appears that they are so little gain because you don't realize that bonuses are multipliers and not just added to each other.
---
So a 2% bonus to damage is not really a 2% bonus. It will actually add more then 2% to damage it's boosting if you have other bonus multipliers to the same damage weapon system. The more bonuses you have to that damage system the more each bonus increases your overall damage (ignoring for a second stacking penalties)
---
Think they just sent the email 18 times. I got 18 of them too even though i only have 4 accounts
---
Escalation adds fuckall value... You used to be able to make dank isk on just avengers but nowadays it's really not worth it...
---
 (‚úø‚ó†‚Äø‚ó†)  nullbears should play wow . teehee
---
Citadels are only super cheap if low power. Otherwise they get similar to a POS.
---
I'm sorry.
---
I'm sorry that you lack the ability to understand your own words.
---
I'm sorry you can't read between the lines, understand the references and extrapolate the underlying sentiment.  You probably don't get out much.
---
If my shitpost has evoked an emotional response, so severe, that you'll threaten somebody, anonymously, over the internet with violence.  
---
I'd say you're my target audience, and this is top tier shit.
---
EVE is not the game for PVP-er only. there are players enjoy doing PVE, indy. nullsec can be dangerous but cut out all nullsec PVE-er contents is another thing. Forcing PVE player becoming PVP-er is a bad idea.
---
You may enjoy PVP and you think it's the only way to play the game, it's fine. Just don't force others to play your style, it's a sandbox game.
---
Yes but the point is to introduce chaos to wormhole space. What you said has nothing to do with wormhole space.
---
yeah lowsec is great. I enjoy getting 20 supers dropped on by snuffed. why do you think wormholers are in wormholes in the first place? maybe its because we don't enjoy being in a blob. really makes you think
---
Personally I left LS to go to NS because of blackout
---
Okay. How do i put this?     
---
Imagine a fortizar with unlimited mooring spots (Or a new POS Schtick 2.0, whatever). 1200 goon titans moor on that structure and can be seen from the outside. How does that make sense?
---
Cyno changes will change that amigo. It will be a new time!
---
The HIC change didn't make things risky though. It was inconvenient but you could get the same level of security with a different ship and a few extra steps. 
---
Personally I didn't see why WHers got so mad about it, but I suspect it had more to do with the principle of CCP reneging on it's promise to not change the HIC role in WH rolling when they said they would be addressing lurch HICs. Also the "collateral damage" gaff was understandably infuriating.
---
So you telling me in a C5 to C5 you are only running site in your home hole? No one ever uses that C5 static for new sites when the home hole runs dry and  you got a corp full of ddes looking make billions? Please tell me how I am wrong.
---
Clearly you didn't fully understand Pveing in the chain and why it was brought up.
---
How many people live in those 97 systems and how many in those 2500 Wh?
---
&gt;When I was in nullsec the two most cancerous things were cyno capabilities of having an entire carrier group land on your head at any moment
---
Then you probably shouldn't have decided to engage a rorq or a super with your 10-person gang.  Just like it would be very silly for me to assume I'd win in a frigate against you in a T3C.
---
I've been among the people in subcaps trying to catch small roaming gangs.  The good ones get kills and don't get caught.  Heck, sutionia seemed to have a fondness for roaming Eso solo...and not getting caught.
---
The bad ones sit on a rorq for 10 minutes, sure that the tank will break any minute now.  And then come to r/Eve to complain about cynos.
---
&gt;the second you flew somewhere everyone docked up
---
I'm not saying it would be bad for the WH group to dock up if a giant null fleet appeared in their hole.  I'm saying it makes there not be a point to bring that giant null fleet into their hole.  It would be stupid to demand someone hand you a gank.  \*hint hint\*.
---
&gt;That would actually make it safer...if the chain is dead it means we can run it all day without worry
---
And if no one wanders into our space, we can run it all day without worry.
---
But we aren't actually locked into a single day.
---
Former CSM in action, ladies and gents.
---
i'll standby the fact that there is no place for subcaps under a supercap umbrella, which is the equivalent of saying "if you don't have a 100-man strong dread cache nearby then don't bother coming to delve"
---
Let there be an upkeep cost of docking Titans in a citadel. It rises exponentially per the n+1 Titans docked.
---
I interpreted it as more the rolling WH mechanic, not wormhole space in general. This discussion seemed to be specifically on the rolling of WHs.
---
Naw, I prefer when wh'ers rage-reee and lose their cool on forums with their CSM 12 tag proudly hanging off their turd post.
---
&gt; 30 / 0.5 = 60 tho.
---
What's that got to do with anything?
---
For july I can napkin-math the 30T ISK if I approximate the pre-drop to 10 days at 1.6T/day, and post-drop to 20 days at 0.5T/day. Totaling 29.2T ISK. Still looks like ISK/day for the y-axis.
---
If you compare losing local chat to a fundamental change to how travel is permitted within a class of space the impact is MUCH lower. 
---
Removing WH mass limits impacts all space with large over reaching changes that are not even limited to WHs. Null sec fleet also gain the power to move fleets of arbitrary sizes arbitrary distances without bridges or cynos across the map which is a huge change to force projection in Null.
---
Even if we completely disregard wormhole health I don't support that change either.
---
Hmmm, let's see, the largest group to leave the game and dropped their sov in the NE was a WH group.
---
People who adapt? You mean like HK that cried all over Reddit when INIT popped both of their Keepstars?
---
Or the people that flew to Reddit to bitch about loss of lurch Hictors?
---
Or the people now that are completely bewildered by this new change, because face it, it makes zero sense.
---
My playtime nor what I do when I'm playing hasn't changed a bit with the recent changes. The cyno changes will a bit, but it just means I have to do a bit of training on my cyno characters.
---
When they made an arrangement with NC/PH to Order66 our supercap fleet
---
The fuck do you mean, Eve is a second job you have to pay for.
---
Imagine that whole nullsec, lowsec and higsec generated 29T and WH space 12T
---
and ill standby that faxs and wormhole rolling shut down as many potential fights as the umbrella does. Maybe my hate on faxs is misdirected. either way it was a fun internet argument.
---
The HIC change didn't make things more risky though. It was inconvenient but you could get the same level of security with a different ship and a few extra steps. Not risk, just tedium.
---
Personally I didn't see why WHers got so mad about it, but I suspect it had more to do with the principle of CCP reneging on it's promise to not change the HIC role in WH rolling when they said they would be addressing lurch HICs. Also the "collateral damage" gaff was understandably infuriating. 
---
Admittedly, I didn't roll that much myself when I lived in WH space.
---
Nice. I particularly like the choice of the *Hungarian Dance Nr. 5* for the soundtrack. *Blue Danube* is hackneyed for space films though... who are you, Stanley Kubrick? If you *had* to use a selection from *The Planets*, why not *Mars, the Bringer of War*? Though I suppose there was jollity, at least on your part.
---
no one PvEs in chain. there might be a 3-man c5-c5 "corp" that only does pve but thats an oddity. you will literally never see lazerhawks or hard knocks or tdsin or novac rat in their chain. everyone has personal farmholes. we log into farmholes maybe twice a month and run sites in the hole because its much safer. 
---
clearly you have never lived in c5 space and you should check yourself before you make assumptions about how it operates
---
A few corrections:
---
* Supercapitals cannot enter WHs, and I doubt that'll change.  Even if one takes the interview answer as a removal of WH mass-based collapse, they'll almost definitely not be removing the maximum *per jump* mass, which is what prevents supercarriers and titans from entering them.
---
   * Removal of the maximum mass limit would, however, remove restrictions on how many dreads they bring to siege your stuff.  Currently, all capital-sized WHs have a maximum mass of 3 million kilotonnes, with dreadnoughts massing in at roughly 1.35 million kilotonnes.  This allows no more than 3 dreadnoughts through a specific hole, limiting siege potential.  Since FAX also mass about the same, bringing a FAX removes 1/3rd of your maximum dread potential.
---
* WH rolling is more specifically the process of massing a hole up in a calibrated way so you reduce it to &lt;=0 mass *while all of your people are on the correct side of it*.  That last piece is the tricky part, depending on the hole.  Capital-sized holes, for example, have a total possible mass _variance_ of roughly twice the mass if a Higgs-rigged battleship with MWD activated, or a bit under half the total mass of a single capital.
---
* Very few wormholes have greater than a 24-hour base duration.  Most are 24-hour or 16-hour.  Of the 89 different types of origin wormholes, 58 are 16h, 27 are 24h, and only 4 are 48h.
---
Bullshit.
---
&gt; now VNIs are dead, every newbro has to train into a domi to make any amount of isk worth a damn. 
---
Is this a troll post?
---
This is only blue loot - stuff that is sold to NPC buy orders.       
---
So on top of this you have materials for whole T3 production and other stuff like null relics spawning in the WH space.
---
Multiboxing rorqs and unlimited resources per regions are the biggest reason of proliferation.
---
I have 8 accounts currently unsubbed due to the morbid changes! This game is about to die in the next few years due to these changes! I'm saving myself the pain of having the lights shut off on my while I'm flying my Roq. 75% of my pvp friends are getting bored quickly, going from before changes 3-4 fleets per night to maybe 1 a week! Sad as this is Eve Online is surely but slowly dying!
---
Cat ears confirmed boys!
---
Well, idiots are present in all communities...
---
cyno change is dumber than this one. oh no snuffed will have to train recon alts in order to drop supers
---
Good one lmao
---
You should read deeper, then you might realize that my comments are more a counter to let nullsec see what would be possible besides their "hey we can stomp you unlimited by then" ...
---
Lol. I'm not disagreeing with you there.
---
Delayed by a week according to the EVE London Facebook page
---
&gt;Why do we only have two genders?
---
Unless we are getting new alien races, please find the source of this suggestion and escort them from the building.
---
Lol I guess being a newbro in his/her case is being a VNI null drone that null sec corps love to tax on.
---
Big changes are big changes.
---
Only time I engaged a rorqual was to get the caps dropped and leave to find another kill while they flew/cyno'd back home. Having any ship capable of cyno meant the maller flying around could drop caps on your small gang which was the most cancerous part. Limiting cynos allows for more balanced gameplay vs an "I win" button. 
---
Right and it's already possible to rat/run sites without issue and having the inability to go get content is a huge killer for wh space. Imagine having a random chance of not being able to get to some  nullsec regions you hunt in.
---
Sounded like he was only talking about rolling the holes. I didn't get any hint of removing shipmass limit out of that.
---
When you are out of ideas, sometimes you look in shitholes for new ones. That's normally a mistake, as there's always lots of shitters in shitholes. Just like wormholes, who knew?
---
In terms of 'look at this cool new meta thing I found', its old.
---
Thanks for the shoutout, and very sorry to leave that PR hanging so long; I hit a point last year where I had to step away from all my hobby projects to focus on other things, and I've only slowly been picking them back up again. Happy to see that graph code polished up and merged; thanks!
---
Thanks, nice of ccp to inform us isn't it.
---
A salvo is one barrage from a group of weapons. In EVE, one cycle of a weapon group. Can also refer to multiple ships firing at once.
---
Damage over Time.
---
Oh boy, I know I miss them fun days of VNI ratting.
---
Lmao wtf.
---
This number makes me think someones cat walked across their keyboard and they kept the value.
---
They already is a timer for your point nb3
---
I agree for the rest :)
---
prexananant
---
If you think it‚Äôs so lucrative, please pack up your stuff and join the world of no asset safety, no titans and no super umbrellas.
---
Also - no NPC bounties. The isk isn‚Äôt yours till you  actually sell it
---
Not really :)
---
Yeah no shit. Both sides have stupid people. Not to mention most of those seem like they didn't play in wh space because of the gameplay but to abuse the relative security they thought they had here. Like you said. They left. And I say good.
---
If they can distinguish genuine players from bots why aren't they banning the bots?
---
Then you need to go do those "safe" activities in high security space.  Nullsec must always be highly dangerous.
---
&gt;rimworld and work on my drug colony
---
Currently waiting for Classic to come out but I‚Äôve had Rimworld on the backlog for months and I‚Äôd like to dabble in making some meth in preparation for Monday. Is this a meme or can I actually make a drug empire if I do choose on Rimworld?
---
All this effort posting and *formatting* really makes me think you're not even trolling. Which would be sad considering how fucking retarded the post is.
---
Get rekt carebear
---
Probably as a CSM you see how many people live in specific area of space (aka ask CCP for % per area).         
---
This is 12T **only** in blue loot that was sold to NPC buy orders.          
---
This is **not all that dropped and yet have to be moved** ^(so value will be higher)            
---
On top of all of this blue income you have also materials for whole T3 production in New Eden.            
---
Not forgetting other stuff like classic null relics or ability to mine moons ^(but this is still in minority or done by people visiting WH space for higsec - so it will be not fair to include it)            
---
Somewhere ^(honestly don't know when i seen this) i think CCP stated that WH population is around 5-6% of whole New Eden.        
---
So yes - risk VS reward is bit broken here.         
---
Don't have any thing against the materials generated for T3 production - but WH space doing 12T of ISK injection when rest of New Eden (so higsec, lowsec and nullsec) do 29T is just silly and totally out of balance.             
---
Maybe it is time to remove blue loot from WH space and compensate with more T3 materials.        
---
The cheaper T3 ships will be the more will die and with the lack of rorqual mining they will balance the raise of the T2 production prices.         
---
/u/ccp_rise i ping you again, but i think you are the one that can change stuff.
---
Get together with the rest of Imperium, start planning. Maybe in a year you'll be able to do something about it.
---
MWD's burn out really fast.
---
If you can't handle the fact that his game is a huge time sink and that nullsec is meant to be pvp centric then you are the one who needs to find another game, not me.  There are plenty of other games to play that cater to people like you with decreased attention spans.
---
Well even when it does release, I hope it has a healthy balance. 1st place space mmo will go to the game that manages to mesh all play styles together in a balanced environment with a balanced economy. Easier said than done and I'd guess the only way to find out what works is trial and error. CCP probably realized what they were doing wasn't working so they had to shake it up. Maybe they shook it up too much? Hard to say, really. Like I said I think time will tell. I'm sure CCP and their shareholders don't want to make changes to make people quit, but you really can't please everyone and changes to the game will always have an ebb and flow.
---
Do you understand that if CCP never rebalanced ships, the game would be so ridiculously stagnant? Like many games rebalanced on a weekly or monthly basis to switch around the power hierarchy, that is absolutely a healthy part of a modern game.
---
&gt;The company now is super focused on Eve in the last 18 months.
---
Who woulda thought focusing on your flagship (and only product) would prove beneficial?! /s
---
It shifts a lot faster than 1%/cycle. You really don't need to OH for very long.
---
Stainguy is a goon alt, not sure why anyone takes his suggestions as anything less than propaganda
---
Sounds like you will just randomly roll your alts out.
---
EVE is outstanding in giving newbies a purpose compared to other MMOs. A day 1 char can tackle ships for a fleet and secure kills for experienced players. A day 1 WoW player is completely irrelevant to experienced WoW players.
---
The difference is, Eve has a very bad new player experience and most players won't tackle that frigate mostly because they're lost and don't know where to go or what to do.
---
You have the reading comprehension of a 4 year old or you're fucking stupid. I feel it's the latter. So lets break this down. 
---
Pve in the chain was just an example of what might happen if you could not roll wormholes anymore and looking for pve content to make your isk. I didn't say people did it now. 
---
Secondly you are full of shit if you don't think people in C5 corps don't use their C5/6 statics for pve. How the hell else are you going to make your dank isk..Bro. The purpose of getting a home hole with getting a good static is for pve AND pve. Check yourself fool.
---
Maybe we should ban you for telling others cheaters without having any proof or evidence? Ever think about that?
---
Its only condoning cheating when you can proof he has been/is cheating and I wouldn't condone if you had anything.
---
1 in 4 of your pvp friends are totally happy!
---
I'm a miner first and formost in eve. I'm not much of a pvper, with this said, the idea of permadeath fastinates me. 
---
I would love, to either be able to take one of my char, clone into say a blood raider clone, be no longer anld to clone and make it a challenge to see how long i could survive as a mining blood raider. Or start a new account and do this.
---
I love the idea of permadeath.  Esp if we could use the other factions besides the empires.
---
(As a non rper i always felt it was dumb that i could not, once again, join or be a blood raider and wage a holy war against cva)
---
We aren't here to kill the game. We are here to kill your game.
---
If it‚Äôs so lucrative and easy - go try and farm c5/6 sites by yourself. Good luck with with dude..
---
Ratting in NS was not a great experience. Nerfing AFK ratting, removing local, and putting cynos on certain ships only are all logical, good changes.
---
The problem is that those changes make ratting *even worse*. They need to make ratting/income-generation harder and more interesting without making it impossible and tedious. Because now it's impossible and still really boring.
---
Of course it is more fun when the toys we have are valuable and having meaning and everyone isn't flying the most expensive ship loaded with purples. 
---
I really have no idea where you are coming from. How is everyone having all the virtual assets fun?
---
You're very welcome to come to wormhole space to krab, we always needs more peeps in wormholes.
---
The lockout sounds like some shit straight from a mobile game. Do we get to watch an ad to skip it too?
---
One more. Yes please fix bounty hunting. As a former pirate hunter a long time ago, the very fact that killing pirate players eventually made me the bad guy too also felt dumb.
---
So take away the panic button and the Indy core. Boom. Game fixed. I'm out.
---
Make asset safety an account-level service, up there with password changes and support tickets.
---
You can initiate asset-safety via your account on the EVE website, or it will be initiated for you (with generous warning emails) if you haven't logged in for 30 (or whatever; user-configurable?) days. You also get a warning email that you have assets in a structure about to go into hull timer, and can safety your stuff *before* destruction from the email/EVE website/the app. 
---
*All* assets get safetyed, across all characters on that account.
---
Your assets get moved out of game-space entirely.  When you're ready to come back, subcap hulls/mods, and other resources get restored ~~immediately~~ on a short, but not abusable delay (6-12hrs); capital hulls and mods on a 7-day delay.  Assets go back to either the station they came from, or the closest lowsec npc station, like they do now.
---
This makes asset safety a tool for people who are taking a break from the *game*, not just choosing not to contest a specific timer.
---
Your lack of a grasp on basic economic principles is painful.
---
I always thought an explosive hole was your ass after eating chipotle
---
No I‚Äôm referring to when he hinted at looking into locking pilots out of ships if you lose it, and being sarcastic
---
I did the wh thing a few years ago, was fun for the most part there is something about smaller fights that is very fun where individual pilot skills comes into play more than the FC doing all the work
---
That's right, and remember in the land of capitalism and keep the gubberment off my medicare (literal statement from someone in an ACA town hall) that our mass shootings are a mental health issue, and healthcare is *not* a right.
---
&gt; is it fun for people to make significantly less isk? 
---
 
---
Yes. My isk has been devaluing for years. Stop inflation now.
---
Samesies.  See you out there.
---
&gt; I understood that initial plan something like 2 Titans per astrahus, one on top and one on the bottom or something like that.
---
No, you didnt, because that's something you literally made up right now. They never mentioned any specifics or limitations. This is literally headcanon you made up.
---
Even in a patch you need to verify that it's actually in game and works like they said it would in patch notes.
---
This 12T **just** in blue loot actually proves it is **waaaay tooooo** lucrative.
---
The way it's paraphrased here makes it seem like you might lose Amarr Frigate V but can relearn it at an accelerated speed (think 5x or 10x, maybe coupled to original training time).      
---
Still not a good idea, tbh. But hardly what you make it sound.
---
Classic chori shitpost
---
Just have received email from CCP with their weekend of free SP. It looks like everything is OK.
---
It is about number of people not area they inhabit.      
---
Not even alts as WH often have "private krab wormholes with alts"
---
What I'm asking for is a replacement for the current PvE system in null. If they insist on keeping Blackout and saying that the content is too easy and too profitable for one guy and it's too easy for bots to farm then they need to put forward some actual solutions because right now the hunter ratter game is heavily rigged in favour of one side and the reward never went up with that risk. If they want people in null sec having to work together so bad then give them content that is designed to be done with other people. Tell ten guys to cover each other in one Sanctum just isn't practical. It would alleviate the botting problem. It would address this 'infinite resource' thing they keep thinking is a problem. Flicking light switches just doesn't fix anything without causing more problems. It's a lazy approach.
---
I don't think that will ever change though. If the numbers ever go back up, people are going to screech that the game is dying because the isk faucets have been turned down. Heck, I bet that if the numbers don't change at all, people will find another reason to screech that eve is dying.
---
It was kind of unprompted from CCP Burger. Felt a bit weird. Then Hellmar mentioned that native americans have 5 genders.
---
Seriously, don't be buying new hulls or injecting skills until they confirm what the changes will actually be
---
12 T is in NPC buy orders.
---
Thanks very much for the feedback - I hear you on the camera focus (and the subs)..  There were actually only a couple of condor fits in the end, using diff scripts for tracking/range - one set had neuts tho which were great when stacked.
---
I find that hard to balance. We already have problems with balancing. 
---
I mean, if "not play by the same rules" means giving some kind of edge, you'd essentially introduce another P2W mechanic with your "large amount of ISK". That's a lot closer to gold ammo than feels comfortable. 
---
Maybe you've had something else entirely in mind?

I think that it's a bit different for Eve since demand for a lot of things is pretty constant, regardless of prices (as long as we're not talking about hyper-deflation). People are going to always shoot a certain amount of ammo and ships are going to blow up at a certain rate.
---
We've had hyper-inflation of PLEX prices though, a little deflation might help.
---
Well it's only really a problem if it's overlooked in development. Kinks can be ironed out. The problem is getting people to sit down to actually talk about real solutions instead of flipping all the tables hoping the problems go away.
---
I was talking about the question of if you lost a ship would they make it so you are locked out of said ship and how he said they might look into it
---
But if everyone makes more ISK then everyone has more money and can buy more things. That's how economics works, right? We can just keep printing money infinitely and the value of that money never changes?

Oh, I am perfectly fine with change; however, I am fine with changes that represent a well thought through effort to enhance the gameplay experience for everyone. 
---
Not changes that, I am literally not joking, the CEO of the company that makes the game has said cause people to be so anxious and upset about, they need to take medication. 
---
Fun fact, if you make MMOs for a living this is a *very bad* game design philosophy, that *prima facie* can only end in disaster.
---
Of course i made the numbers up. What they said is being able to see moored ships.      
---
How do you suggest that to work if not with some kind of limitation? Geez...
---
but basic economic principles aren't fun, they shouldn't be in a game!
---
Yea I 100% agree, locking someone out of a ship is a quick way to get many players to quit
---
Just go bash fortizars
---
But from what i see he didn't suggest being locked out? You are not locked out if you lose one rank like with T3C's. 
---
(like i said, i don't like the idea anyway)
---
Until CCP is no longer making enough money to keep the server live. Then you might re-evaluate your statement.
---
Agreed.  It's really heavy on big, out there ideas, but it is a bit meh on characterization and has some problems from that angle.  Some of the ideas though are just so way crazy yet... cool.
---
What the fuck is this post? You open with people making less money because they have to skill into bigger ships (you can use a myrm you don't need a domi) and how they're less safe because of changes. So it's less fun for newbie krabs. Then you go on this rant about munin meta. 
---
That's completely a choice of risk averse null seccers. No one wants to commit to whelping a fleet so the meta is ships that can alpha targets off grid while being far enough away to leave a fight if necessary.
---
Then you're whining about how it's harder for attackers to bridge in sub caps because of changes but defenders can still easily move subs around to respond. So is it more dangerous for krabs or less dangerous? You're arguing both sides here.
---
All you've proved is that people have fun different ways and trying to balance for "fun" in a game like eve which supposedly supports a huge variety is play styles is fucking bullshit.
---
I imagine any change to wh space that leads to more fights, losses or kills is welcome by the vast majority of wh players. 
---
Most of us want blood, always.
---
So how are groups bigger than 4 people then making money if they can't roll the statics?
---
If we farmed our static, and there is no chain going on in a C3 for example. Do we then sit there 16 hours and wait for no pvp and no ISK to go away because we're stuck with an empty unfarmable static hole?
---
If you wanna make the risk higher, fine, make more connections spawn, make frig roles higher or whatever.
---
This is not chaos, this is outright stupid.
---
In Null and Low they made things harder/unsafe.
---
This change would be negative for all wormholers. PvPers can't roll for PvP (unsafe!) anymore, and you can also not make any money anymore after you used your static hole for the day, so you remove the whole profit of wh space. It basically is unliveable then in, unless youre only 3 guys in a corp and can live from a single static or something.
---
This would be 1005% stupid.
---
Make the games harder for any means. You did it with Null and Low, so it's only fair if you want to hit us as well. But seriously the fuck don't make 20+ people sit 12 hours in a WH waiting for a new hole for content (either pvp OR pve). 
---
And no, if you constantly search content in highsec, lowsec and nullsec 85% of the time, what's the point in living in jspace then?
---
Delete wormholes
---
But that precision is basically never useful.
---
Shotgunning it works better.
---
Why are you ratting and mining for isk? Those are probably the worst ways to earn isk in EVE if you care about your isk per hour. 
---
Go wormhole diving for maybe an hour or two and you'll make enough to do some PVP stuff. Do some scamming for an hour and you'll be set for a month. 
---
Or even less effort: contract flipping. 
---
Null sec is **supposed** to be dangerous.
---
Nice to see you have a hard time balancing your point of view with others.
---
But this change nothing if a very small percentage of people managed to generate **41%** of isk when compared to the rest of New Eden.       
---
This is only what was already sold.            
---
Tell me what is the total PVE loses of whole New Eden to WH space during this time ... minimal when you compare this to all rating PVE ship loses in nullsec , lowsec and higsec.
---
Hmmm two of the "other" updates are about planetary/orbital structures.
---
From the way Hellmar has sounded in these conversations, it's a "no stone left unturned" sort of thing going on. I expect to see changes across the whole game as big as the nullsec changes.
---
No matter where you live, they are coming for you eventually. Prepare to be Chaos Era'd.

It's almost like CCP is a capitalist entity that relies on people actually paying for its services to keep the lights on, pay salaries, develop the game, etc. 
---
But you're right CCP clearly will do fine with just the part of r/eve sniffing their own farts and proclaiming "make the game harder and riskier for null sec and easier and riskless for me!"
---
Strangely I received one on each of the account instead of just one.
---
You can skip it for plex.
---
Same.
---
You can train the skill that makes it switch to the incoming damage faster
---
Thanks!  Mars was my first choice but then when I had it all put together it somehow wasn't working so I went for the more upbeat tone of Jupiter.  I think you're right though, it would fit much better in a more serious fleet op vid; maybe it'll make the next one.
---
The 4th question asks about if you died you could get locked out of a ship and hellmar says that they could look into it (would copy the exact line but it won‚Äôt let me on my phone)
---
Some of the best hunting holes are crit ones. We would always just take frigates through if we found anything worthwhile.
---
After reading that i was like man this dude is out of touch.
---
I have a few pertinent questions about the training data you used.
---
Sounds suspiciously similar to ‚Äúblued everyone around and now needs to go far to roam‚Äù
---
I think there's some confusion across two questions. One suggestion was a total lockout of a ship hull based on dying in that ship, and another suggestion was SP penalty for death, which Hellmar spun into the idea that you could lose SP but train it back much faster.
---
/u/Poops_mcpooper
---
I have one capital pilot. My main. Also, capital alts might not be players, but they are real accounts that need to be paid for, and money being paid to keep them running is part of what keeps EVE a 16 year old live MMO.
---
&gt;This is not all that dropped and yet have to be moved so value will be higher
---
No. The average out of old blue loot from the past getting sold and unsold blue loot from this month would balance out, unless you think some idiot somewhere is stockpiling tens of billions in blue loot on some sort of moronic market long hold
---
im happy with the new upcoming changes, will make eve much more exciting, it feels like we might avoid the same fate as serenity after all!
---
What about simply volume limits on stuff thats docked up in upwells? Subcaps and even some caps would be incpnsequential, but supers take up a bunch of space. It would limit the number of standby caps/supers that could be present in a particular upwell, forcing players to spread out their stuff and make it harder to instadrop a bunch of stuff at once
---
Yea, either way dumb ideas
---
The problem is that you can't gain stsndings with the trigs so there is no way to coexist.
---
You literally listed an unending list of nerfs to null sec while previously saying null hasn't been nerfed like other play styles.
---
My issue is long term goals. I look to a future where the endgame is in complete chaos. I see people skilling for a year or more for a playstyle that is subsequently eliminated(or near enough to being so). I just do not see a future to work towards in this game, much less a choice of playstyles.

Don‚Äôt know if my napkin maths is correct but that puts each dread at 8.89k dps for the whole siege cycle. Seems a lot.

we already lack asset safety. why shouldn't we be allowed to have a home like you? we also WILLINGLY set up an unsafe home that you can piss us off with really easily if you want to. but forcing us to live like homeless people in boxes is the eve online equivalent of social discrimination and right extremism, man.
---
Yet. More Chaos.
---
No, it doesn't. Have you tried farming those sites?
---
I mean the salvage is practically worthless, most the isk comes from blue loot and gas.
---
What if it was like 30+ vs single crab? Does it really matter if it is 200vs1 or 30vs1?
---
He was talking about how him (the CEO) and the other guy (the creative director) just point out problems that need to be addressed and rely on their teams to implement things in game to address those issues. Its not for him to say hey 'remove asset safety' make it so.
---
&gt;Tell me what is the total PVE loses of whole New Eden to WH space during this time
---
Let's compare the ISK value.
---
My Drake that I flew into a Triglavian conduit alone when they had just come out.
---
Blingy wormhole Nestor.
---
lol this is #5 ya spastic
---
Oof what a rose colored version of Raiden you have..
---
You can technically do both. We sometimes crit if we have enough scouts and everything and put the Rorquals out for moon mining.
---
most of the time we just roll it completely though. sometimes you dont even want to have frigates to watch.
---
and also you completely close any nonstatic holes (unless frig holes because pain in the ass)
---
Like it was initially planned by CCP
---
GUYS I NEED SKILL POINTS TO FLY A RECON ITS GATED BEHIND A PAYWALL

---
That sounds optimistic.
---
Eve streams are beyond boring, I wouldn't subject anyone to that.
---
Its not a paywall, you're using that word but it doesn't mean what you think it means.

By your logic every frigate after the noobie frigate is 'behind a paywall'

this man gets it

its a joke autismo

living in thera is quite different from normal WH life especially since most people in thera dont give a fuck about WHs itself and use it because its a great way to get around the map for pvp
---
Yes he is and no I'm not dumb, though it seems you might be.
---
What would be great is if there was automatic feedback message to bot reporters saying something like "Botter McBot was banned thanks to your reporting!". Would make it a lot less like you're just screaming into the void.
---
Long ago, I was pushing the suggestion that the Rorqual be allowed to bridge other industrials.
---
Maybe someday.
---
Lol thats literally not a logical line at all.  Im thinking you're the one that doesnt know what it means...
---
Make up your mind, is Kspace dying because of all the changes and people unsubbing and leaving in droves, with PCU dropping like stocks in 2008, or are there tens of thousands of dedicated gamers out here?
---
&gt;ou are assuming that multiboxers had just 2 accounts. It wouldn't be uncommon for each player to have 5+ accounts simultaneously onlin
---
Correct. I had 4 accounts and that is *far fewer* than a lot of people I know have. I have turned off 3, including my main, not so much because of the blackout, but because of the cyno changes. 
---
The last one will be turned off as soon as my trader's inventory is cleared and I've converted my liquid assets into plex. We will see if the game still exists in a year, maybe I will come back.
---
Well sorry you've spent so much time in the wrong game, in EVE you are handicapped unless you have multiple accounts, its always been this way and it'll always be this way, its quite literally part of the companies business model.
---
Sorry you wasted so much time, but considering how utterly fucking retarded your whole argument is, I'm lying and I'm not sorry.
---
I just don‚Äôt like having a limit on m3 stored in each station. It‚Äôs far too easy to get around by creating holding alts, and it would just create a annoyance 
---
by making people transfer stuff around by storing it in contracts, 
---
It would be a ok idea if it could be enforced, but without reworking half the trade mechanics this would only be an annoyance
---
Goons where on deployment, usually you rat at least twice that number. So you managed to outfarm all of w-space with one coalition?
---
Im new to the game, what is happening to eve ? I mean, is this going to die or is a little bit over dramatized ?
---
You have to pay a monthly sub to train skills bud, im just using your logic, they're all behind a paywall.
---
&gt; Well sorry you've spent so much time in the wrong game, in EVE you are handicapped unless you have multiple accounts, its always been this way and it'll always be this way, its quite literally part of the companies business model. 
---
Which is an awful model...
---
&gt; Sorry you wasted so much time, but considering how utterly fucking retarded your whole argument is, I'm lying and I'm not sorry. 
---
I'm not lying at all?  I think you just hate anything not in your small world view.
---
You better include all the overseer effects and red loot if you want to compare isk faucets.
---
Perspective: 5 % of the player base makes 41 % of the isk.
---
Clarity provided.
---
Sorry bud, caps can't jump alone, you need 2 accounts minimum for a capital pilot in EVE.
---
No you're not...bud...and no you dont have to pay for a sub to train past just the noob ships...so you're either just wrong and dumb or trying to lie badly?
---
No, 5 % of the player base made 41 % of the isk.
---
&gt;se it means EVE loses profitability... and when that happens...
---
Yeah, here is the thing. People *who are giving CCP money* are deactivating their accounts.
---
No shit?  You are really proving how retarded you are with every reply lol.
---
My small world view?  You're sitting here belting out tears like an self entitled little shit stain and you've got the balls to call somebody else's view small.
---
The game operates a certain way, if you dont like it, quite literally fuck all the way off.
---
no. cat ears are confirmed.
---
That's not how percentages work friend. You need to add 29 and 12 together before dividing 12 by the total x 100.
---
So you agree you need 2 accounts to fly a capital, its not a horrid business model it just is what it is.  
---
And you're crying about it.
---
&gt; My small world view? You're sitting here belting out tears like an self entitled little shit stain and you've got the balls to call somebody else's view small. 
---
lol, Sounds like this statement applies to you more than me.  Projecting much?
---
&gt; The game operates a certain way, if you dont like it, quite literally fuck all the way off. 
---
Or change shit thats broken and you instead can go fuck off?  So much hate.
---
If you don't have a massive time block to commit, then that's the entire point of Lowsec. Stations are safe, secure bases to state from and with FW warzones content isn't too far away. Just because the areas that are intended for the people with a lot of time (Wormholes and living in in nullsec) aren't as accessible to the lazy or time-constrained, doesn't mean there aren't ways to enjoy eve without pushing the giant commitment.
---
Except it's not. Abyssal red loot and other commodities that are farmed nearly exclusively in Kspace are being purposefully excluded by  Stainguy to push an Agenda. If you want to make a point, at least try to make it objective.
---
And that's not even addressing the fact that risk in W-space is so much higher than Kspace. No asset safety whatsoever. Random connections that can roll into you at any moment.
---
More insults! Triggering a bitch has never been this easy!
---
We need actual people that work with mechanics to have these interviews when talking about possible changes. I feel like I'm reading a political interview, the whole thing is just filled with nonanswers beyond the stupid SP and lockout ideas.
---
Speaking of losing SP and being locked out of ships, it's objectively horrible and sounds like an easy way to install microtransactions. "pay x to speed up your cooldown" or "pay x to instantly regain your SP!"
---
WTF is going on at CCP?
---
Except it is.
---
Ok let me correct that, you need a sub to train anything past 20 million sp, so everything past 20 million sp is locked behind a paywall, HOW DARE A FOR PROFIT COMPANY DO SOMETHING TO GENERATE INCOME.
---
Let me jump my super in your wormhole when there is a connection open in the system the super is in. This will balance it out quite nicely.
---
Just close local chat when in Jita, it's useless except for scamers
---
It will be fine, CCP just backstabed community too much. They did low effort changes to complexed game.
---
They should prepare a complex change to more aspects so people can understand and see positive sides of changes before everything collapses.
---
&gt; So you agree you need 2 accounts to fly a capital, its not a horrid business model it just is what it is. 
---
You need 2 accounts to jump on your own...OR you have a friend in your group.  But with the relying on multiple accounts, it IS a horrid business model for a video game.
---
&gt; And you're crying about it. 
---
Sounds like you're just crying about any change...you sound afraid.
---
Imo it was over dramatized in the past cant say the same for the present
---
Yikes.
---
Yea, i actually hate people like you who feel the world owes you something, I sit around at night and sometimes kill a chicken under a full moon in the hopes that an old god will visit people like you with aggressive pancreatic cancer.
---
Excellent point! Wow!
---
Because they actually can't and it's good PR to say otherwise.
---
Sounds like you made billions off recons and don‚Äôt want competition! Lol
---
That said, it‚Äôs always a risk buying hulls or injecting skills before changes are actually in the game.   Wait for the changes to actually take affect if you don‚Äôt want to take the risk.
---
At this point I‚Äôll take any changes. Let the chaos continue!
---
Lowsec has what you're looking for in terms of quick, cheap content or short mission running sessions.
---
If you want income you can do at work, now you're going to have to go to highsec.
---
So you're saying raise the minimum bounty to $15/hour?
---
depends on the fit, but you can easily get 8.5k to 9k on t1 guns. add in some pyrolancea drugs and overheat and its fairly accurate for most cases
---
12/29 gives you how much WH made isk in blue loot VS rest of the New Eden.
---
From a workload point of view, the changes are simple modification of some numbers of something that already exists ... so I\`m about 110% certain that they will remove mass limit and jump limit of WH.
---
Welcome to Glass the Hole Era.
---
&gt; Ok let me correct that, you need a sub to train anything past 20 million sp, so everything past 20 million sp is locked behind a paywall, HOW DARE A FOR PROFIT COMPANY DO SOMETHING TO GENERATE INCOME. 
---
And that's where one account imo is okay for that, Affording an account is alright and not oppressively money draining on a player for well hell most other games.  So yes How dare they REQUIRE you to have multiple accounts to fly a ship generating an exponential wall of money.
---
I'm fine with this, WH crabbing just became 90% safer.
---
I mean, I could add a lot of talking points full of shit like you did.. would that help?
---
you can see in here someone told hilmar about procedural generation about three days ago and he's latched onto it and is probably infuriating all of the devs telling them about how they're going to need to use this magical tool that generates infinite content
---
&gt; Yea, i actually hate people like you who feel the world owes you something, I sit around at night and sometimes kill a chicken under a full moon in the hopes that an old god will visit people like you with aggressive pancreatic cancer. 
---
So you're just an awful person in general and your opinion doesnt matter...got it.
---
or you spawn in cobalt edge and take 57 gates with 12 mobile warp disruptors... oh the fun.
---
Null bears: "Ha! Take that you filthy wormholers."
---
Wormholersbtw: "Bring it on."
---
It should be 100% random and unpredictable
---
What kind of backstabbing was that ?
---
Awww
---
&gt;  it IS a horrid business model for a video game
---
You can tell you're right by the way the game has been operating for 16 years that way, the company model seems to be serving both the company and the player base just fine.
---
&gt;OR you have a friend in your group
---
There, you fixed your own problem, you can have a friend sit in your titan/super when you're not using it since you're so into friends.
---
&gt;crying about any change
---
haha bitch please.
---
Only difference is you pop out of a wormhole into high sec and then contract red frog to deliver. Red Frog doesnt service nullsec last time I checked.
---
We are now in Blackout mode.          
---
Look at the drop of PVE activity in nullsec.         
---
For the next month bounty values will be lower while blue loot will be more visible issue.         
---
It is better address it now.
---
Why would anyone upvote this? You shouldn't be punished for *not* playing the game. If I lost my titan because I went on a work trip, vacation, or just took a healthy break from videogames, I wouldn't come back.
---
Oh well, it is what it is and there is actually zero chance CCP changes the way that operates, hopefully the knowledge of that will lead you to quit.
---
&gt; You can tell you're right by the way the game has been operating for 16 years that way, the company model seems to be serving both the company and the player base just fine. 
---
And the ever declining playerbase?  Serving just fine is definitely not true.
---
&gt; There, you fixed your own problem, you can have a friend sit in your titan/super when you're not using it since you're so into friends. 
---
And essentially not be able to own it, yeah that's not solving the problem at all.
---
&gt; haha bitch please. 
---
So that's a yes lol
---
I'd rather be a terrible person than a whiney self entitled little shit.
---
This ratting nullsec super or ratting titan if you wish to compare it this way.
---
Given that these 10 ventures would be logged off if it was a real person: More than zero, so it's enough to justify using the bot for the owner.
---
No, because unlike you, if I want to see change in something, I resort to facts and don't need to twist and omit data to achieve my goals. And now I'm blocking you, because you are just a shit troll who brings nothing to the table.
---
&gt; So, I must ask you CCP, *is it fun* for FCs to not have a cheap cyno to move sub fleet around offensively? With cyno beacons in almost every system, it's easy to move defensive fleets around, but if you want to attack an enemy system, you either have to whelp several force recons, worth at least 200m a pop, to gatecamps? *Is it fun* to have to take twice as long to burn your bridge cyno, even *if* you don't end up losing the ship? 
---
thats why you burn over covops/bombers and blops bridge the recons to a covert cyno first. and thanks to no local they wont know you have cyno recons ready in that system until its too late
---
&gt; it may kill the game for normie null folks like myself.
---
I think this is an important point that even I overlooked. CCP should look at the core demographics of EVE when making changes. For those of you not aware, EVE has one of the oldest median age playerbases in the industry (if not the oldest). 
---
When I started playing EVE in 2006 I was in my late 20s, finishing grad school. Now I am 42, I have a job, a wife, kids, etc., I really do not have the time I used to have to play the game, and I am sure this is true of *quiet a large portion* of the player base. 
---
Given that, the more changes CCP makes that require a greater time investment to do some pretty basic things, the less likely people are to login to do those basic things. The less they login, the less they interact with their social group (the thing that *really* keeps people playing MMOs), and eventually people get to the point they cannot justify spending any money paying for a game they don't play, or to hang out with friends they no longer hang out with.
---
&gt; Oh well, it is what it is and there is actually zero chance CCP changes the way that operates, hopefully the knowledge of that will lead you to quit. 
---
Maybe, maybe not.  We'll see.  Honestly with how toxic you are its you who should quite and get help.

!ThesaurizeThis

There‚Äôs really no way for us to know what the players of this game like or dislike in general. This subreddit has never represented the player base at large.

CCP will make decisions based upon what they think will generate the most revenue in the current environment. More often than not those decisions will never line up very well with the wishes and recommendations of the vast majority of the people posting here.

&gt; I'd rather be a terrible person than a whiney self entitled little shit. 
---
I have bad news for you...you're both of those things, unlike me ;)
---
My assumption is that not all people got Wh to move this stuff easily and safely.            
---
But yes this is most of the blue drop.        
---
Still this is 12T
---
Stuff like this really bothers me. I'm sure one dev could spend one hour brainstorming and come up with easily-programmed tweaks to significantly improve the bounty system.
---
But naw.
---
&gt; And the ever declining playerbase? Serving just fine is definitely not true.
---
The ever declining player base is every single MMO in existence. There aren't any that are thriving, they're all in some stage of death.
---
&gt;And essentially not be able to own it, yeah that's not solving the problem at all.
---
Lol, what, you'd still own it, you'd just use a friend to sit in it when you're not flying it, what the literal fuck is wrong with you that you would say you bought something you didn't own?
---
&gt;So that's a yes lol
---
I've seen 13 years worth of changes bud, shit doesn't phase me I trained everything a decade ago to be impervious to mechanical changes to the game.
---
No. 12 vs 29 does that. 12/29 is a fraction. 
---
Your 41% is irrelevant and misleading. The remaining 59% doesn't correspond to anything makes total isk generated over 100%.
---
Like 3 at least, maybe 3.5
---
&gt; A:NPCs fighting NPCs was unexpected. Drifters invaded space somewhat on their own, though there was some push there by us. We have been lazy and need to stop doing that.

The heck does this mean?

Hellmar talked about procedural generation on the TIS interview and that was a month ago...
---
Ahahahaha. Hey, have you dumb faggots worked out yet CCP are incompetent and have no idea what they are doing and are just plucking changes out of the thing fucking air? Because if you haven't, look into getting a padded helmet, because you may just be retarded enough to do yourself an injury. For the rest of you hopelessly addicted stockholm syndrome'd CCP dick suckers, have fun going down on this sinking ship!

why don't you enjoy your VNI any more? if you aren't afk hunters won't be able to catch you if you are watching dscan at all for combat probes

Every capsuleer deserves a living wage, regardless whether or not what they does is valuable to the "economy"!
---
&gt; The ever declining player base is every single MMO in existence. There aren't any that are thriving, they're all in some stage of death. 
---
This is also objectively not true, do you even know what facts are?
---
&gt;Lol, what, you'd still own it, you'd just use a friend to sit in it when you're not flying it, what the literal fuck is wrong with you that you would say you bought something you didn't own?
---
Because your holding it on a different account you dont have access to?  You are really not rational at all.
---
&gt; I've seen 13 years worth of changes bud, shit doesn't phase me I trained everything a decade ago to be impervious to mechanical changes to the game. 
---
Then quit proving me right and bitching about changes? Sounds like you think the game owes you something to not change like the little self entitled shit you are.
---
Not as much tears as when you got your black out. Fuck me, all that salt could have filled the Dead Sea twenty times over and more

Probably quite similar, while titan is under umbrella , the nestor is behind a locked door with ability to run when needed and friends that will come to help if needed.
---
&gt; justify spending any money paying for a game they don't pl
---
That's not true. Null sec was meant to be dangerous as fuck, but only in proportion to the time and effort sov holders put into defending it. Basically, your statement betrays this common attitude I keep seeing here that null sec should be 'dangerous as fuck' no matter how much work or effort the sov holder puts into defending their sandcastle. 
---
At which point, I have to ask, what is the point of the sandbox again then? What use is my alliance to me if, no matter what we do, the sandcastle we were encouraged to build in this sandbox game, means absolutely nothing? 
---
We might as well dispense with SOV space altogether, re-seed null sec with NPC stations, and call it a day.
---
pretty much yes, inflation in the economic sense is the cost of a certain basket of goods going up in relation to the last value, that's nto inherently good or bad. People overload the term far too much and overcomplicate things for some reason.
---
&gt; On that basis, in context, the severe decrease in inflation, or slight deflation (depending on whether we count the active isk delta) in the MER
---
ok you're getting it confused now, what you're talking about is the growth of the monetary base(more money in circulation). That's one thing that *can* and often does cause inflation, but its not inflation in itself. For inflation to -generally- happen people need to actually spend that money, that's why "velocity" of cash is calculated(its even in the mer i think), that's roughly the turnover of isk. Most of this stuff is skimming over and over simplification but yeah, there's a lot of overcomplicating individual terms but in reality they're as simple as they seem to be. Their interactions are certainly complex and all but the terms by themselves rarely are
---
You wouldn't lose it if you have a pilot sitting in it while it's logged out. 
---
If you have more supers in your hangar than you have pilots, is losing a few *Really* that detrimental to someone with that much wealth?
---
Amen!! I love how all the cry baby player cannot adapt to change so they whine and threaten to unsub. Get overselves adapt and improvise instead of whining about everything!
---
You shouldn't be punished for not playing the game. People aren't neckbeard NEETs that are able to play every day. People take breaks from the game, go on vacation, or are just generally too busy to paly at times. If that happened and I came back to see my titan disappeared, I'd just quit. Anyone with common sense would realize it's just not worth the time and effort to continue.
---
and if your neighbor is a dead end, you're stuck for a day or two and can log off right again. nice content

so they aren't interested in shooting a hecate? would you prefer if i brought a hurricane instead? what exactly do i need to bring in order to satisfy your desire to undock

I don't have that, but I do have like four copies of The Art Of New Eden that were in the signed batch.

removing the time of a K162 appearing is making it more dangerous but also not removing the possibility of rolling a new hole for ISK/content when your curent one is empty and empty.
---
I would 100/100 sign up for this. Make it more dangerous by all means, but don't take the possibility of making money AT ALL.
---
Here is more math for you. 
---
12t in all 2500 systems in WH space.  That‚Äôs 4.8 b per system.  31 days in July so that‚Äôs about 155mill per system per day. 
---
Those are poverty levels in delve. Let‚Äôs compare 
---
Delve ratted 4.7tril in 97 systems.  That‚Äôs an average of 1.56bil per system per day just  in bounties (not inc salvage and loot).  
---
Delve mined  5.77T in 97 systems.  That‚Äôs 1.918bil per system per day. 
---
Your argument is 100% invalid
---
Its a Stainguy post. Its gotta be a shitpost...right?
---
Yes, that ya definitely made people not lose ships
---
I mean it‚Äôs an entirely separate part of the issue but hey... grr krabs

Honestly, probing UI is 100% fine. You admit yourself that you have a shitty mouse.  
---
I spend a lot of time probing, an hour or more a day sometimes. I play on a 5 year old non-gaming laptop with a really shit mobile video card, and I have none of the issues with mouse clicks. I'm very sure this is just your mouse bud.
---
Your 29T is low. You are not including red loot and overseer effects, which is another 9T+, among other things.
---
Also, you are severely underestimating how many people live in WHs
---
&gt; You wouldn't lose it if you have a pilot sitting in it while it's logged out.
---
Ahh, so it should be a mechanic to remember to sit in my titan if I go off for long periods of time? Great idea.
---
I want to see change that let's me assault wormholes!
---
For some reason I didn't think the comet would be that old, interesting.
---
You're very welcome to come krab in wormholes if it's so much better than nullsec ratting, we'd be very happy to have more peeps in wormholes.
---
Yeap. Just like the good old days.
---
Fucking sick
---
I lived in Wormholes for 2 and a half year. Yes, it is safer than current nullsec outside of Rorquals under umbrellas and way more rewarding.
---
Try again dear. And I'm all for removing assets safety as a whole.
---
Blue loot should be very valuable. After some discussion with my crack team of quality control experts it has been decided that this thread sucks.

Dw they cheap

If people on this subreddit could just share their enjoyment with the game, rather than whining EVERY. FUCKING. DAY.

Dropping 40 Titans tends to do that

You might want to read what you're commenting on before posting stupid things in the future.

ventures can be used as alphas, so no plexxing cost. He would however be cheating by using multiple alpha accounts on top of possibly botting. Though the warp could be a fleet warp, did all the mining lasers get put on rocks at the same though?

Look that even CSM members agree that something is wrong with this 12T in blue loot.

&gt;Because your holding it on a different account you dont have access to? You are really not rational at all.

But he's your friend, you trust him enough to cyno you in blind where you might die but not enough to hold your titan while you do something else with the alt?  Seems theres a flaw in your logic here.

&gt;Then quit proving me right and bitching about changes?
---
I'm not bitching about changes, YOU are bitching about changes, I'm bitching about you whining about having to adapt to the changes that really ARE coming because you dont think they're fair.

Again, to be perfectly clear, I'm not unhappy with any changes the game company has made, I am however super critical of the stupid idead put forward by a  non game developer

i did, and i heard nothing that sounded like that

CCP have the values.

Like if 80% of this blue loot is generated in C5 and C6 then this is what CCP need to address.                
---
This is just to make serious issue visible.

SHHHHHH!!!

Don't interrupt the narrative.  We all know this isn't happening!!
---
Wouldn't it make more sense for DoTs to be called something like gammas?   Y'know, poisonous dots? :D
---
The funny thing is, there are many currently broken ways of pveing in wormholes, but we wormholers complain about it and have complained about it for months. But apparently, we're going to kill the game if we complain about null income being broken as well.
---
Yeah our group was very small and we never mined we always rolled into our static and shot stuff.  So most times we could only have maybe 2 scouts so one on each side of the krab static, close down all holes then just watch for new signatures.  After about 2ish-3 hours we'd open and close the statics again if we were still running.  We figured it was more security than putting them all crit.
---
Dude, it‚Äôs an average of 150mil per system per day.  You are a smart person do the math

Of course I didn't read the link. I thought it was the Monthly Economic Report, so I typed the thing I typed a couple of days ago saying "hey nerds keep it in your pants lol blackout started on July 12th." Go check my post history if you don't believe me.

You really should relax. Not everyone is out to get you. And even if they were, so fucking what? It's a video game.
---
What change am I crying about that the game company is making?  Be detailed
---
Not stonks
---
Nah, i'll just spend my time hoping the game company makes a few more changes that drive you away.
---
Pretty much anything proposed, here's your details:  See above in the chain.
---
I'll do the same for you ;)
---
this is the third attempt you're trying to post this
---
why?
---
lol, eat shit.  I've been an explorer or lived in wormholes for nearly my entire eve career.  It's not challenging, meaningful, or engaging to manually position the probes on celestials.  If dragging that little box around the scanner window is what makes you feel like a pro player, don't even worry your pretty little head. I'm not asking that that be removed.  Just a new additional QoL feature.  
---
Deal with enough dumbass cavemen irl that believe because something was hard in the past, you should suck it up and not improve things for yourself and others to listen to that shit online.  What a moronic attitude.
---
Only been caught once and that was because I did something stupid AK.
---
1)She simply isn't as efficient as she was
---
2)As I mentioned I don't like my toys messed with after I've bought them whether it's with time and isk in EVE or something I've gotten in the real world, like that vehicle I mentioned without mentioning that got chip nerfed through it's wireless connection.
---
Two posts with nearly identical titles, and I picked the wrong one. Calm down, miner.
---
No, the good "old" days meant you never left it. That means there's no risk of it magically disappearing while you were out of game. Having your titan disappear when you don't think about a shitty mechanic because real life is more important is shitty.
---
&gt;You really should relax. Not everyone is out to get you.
---
I wasn't aware that I was any kind of worked up, or that I thought someone was after me. I see that you spent as much time reading my post as the op
---
I'm not a miner. You're thinking of my alt.
---
It‚Äôs only 150mil per day average isk in wormholes.. do the math.  Your argument is invalid.
---
Scenario 1: Wormholes become more random, higher chance of roll out. Sweet I am all for that.
---
Scenario 2: Removing the ability to effectively roll a hole by yourself or with a small group. I'm not after the smaller groups leaving wormholes because they can't function due to having to keep dead chains for 16+ hours.
---
Scenario 3: Removing the ability to roll a hole. Absolutely not. Rolling holes is how we find our PvP content. It's how we find our ISK. It's how we rage roll for a specific system, which as per the HK eviction, we know is hard enough.
---
Why would I need to read the article to repost a thought I had about the article before it even came out? Go check my post history, genius.
---
Saying:
---
&gt;Basically you've just admitted to being a parrot/propagandist lol
---
Betrays your paranoia.
---
No that shortens the timer
---
No be specific, what change is CCP making that I'm mad about?
---
You say I'm upset about change, what change is the game company making that I'm upset about?
---
I really like the new ccp community guy :3
---
Cool!
---
Good luck mate, I hope you reach those stars you are aiming for!
---
Would prefer to burn it down
---
I tried quitting once, it didn't take, so i'll likely be here till the server shuts off enjoying my multiple accounts.
---
Seeing as you just asked the same thing ima copy and past my other reply:
---
" 
---
Pretty much anything proposed, here's your details: See above in the chain.
---
lol"
---
I find that unlikely.
---
Nonsense, you just scan further down the chain.
---
Also wondering
---
You could leave them. Just get a holder. 
---
If you care that much about the ship you'll have it safe. If life is more important, it's space pixels.
---
It was more an observation on your statement than anything. Saying that you're parroting your orgs talking point isn't exactly an unreasonable conclusion to come to, which precludes it from being paranoia by definition.
---
Funnily enough the manual lists Jovian as a playable race.
---
Second, spelled you‚Äôre your.
---
Are you incapable of citing a single change CCP is making that I'm unhappy with?
---
Theres no changes in this chain from the game company, so what are you talking about.  You say I'm crying about the game changing, I'm asking you to be very specific in citing the actual change the company is making that I'm unhappy with.
---
I can cite one that YOU'RE unhappy with, but something tells me you're completely incapable of doing the same thing.
---
That's not even remotely close to what they said when they were throwing stuff out about mass predictability.  
---
On top of that, nice hot armchair take.  Do you even know about the fallout of wormhole bugs they had when they changed the NS hole spawn rate and WH lifetime? It wasn't simple then, I don't see it being simple now.
---
No im just not gonna reiterate shit for you, stop being lazy.
---
Approved
---
Caps on public contracts used to generally cone with 15k fuel as part of the contract (if you wanted a quick sale). Now, they‚Äôre going to have to throw in a Recon hull.
---
Wish I did.. left it when I moved from my parents. Never seen again.
---
It's the definition of paranoia. You're ascribing nefarious intent to something completely without such nuance. So, relax. It's a video game.
---
Almost as if CCP put the mechanics in game that made this possible and players reacted to it. Nah, didn't happen.
---
God forbid you have to go looking for content more then one jump out of your wormhole. Unlike us null guys that go 20-30 jumps for a little bit of content.
---
*ure'st
---
Sorry for underestimating your autism
---
WHs get more isk than nullsec because they have no local... wait... STFU your ruining it!
---
" i wants fights and capital fights too (not just caps) " So go live in NPC nullsec and stop trying to force the sov part of nullsec to meet your vision of the game, it was not designed with that sole focus in mind.
---
TLDR. Bye?
---
Let me help you, there is no change made, present, past, or future that the company plans that I'm unhappy with.
---
HOWEVER
---
Your stupid fucking ideas dont fall under that category.  You dont get to present a stupid fucking idea and when shouted down for your stupidity, claim people dont like change.
---
They just dont like your stupid ideas, which is radically different.
---
For it to be paranoia I have to lack evidence or justification.
---
with anything less than a perfect anti-sub fit you can easily hold down and tank a carrier with a single battleship, anything smaller and they can barely track you without giving up 60% of the DPS to launch tackle fighters. They are nowhere near what they were.
---
They should call it the Cynosural Umbrella Nexus Targeter.
---
lol, been here for 13 years slim
---
so why are you going somewhere you know you won't get what you want? Just to have a reason to complain?
---
Why don't you get an Ishtar?  it will do the same thing for almost the same efficiency.
---
&gt; Weird, facts seem to be taking a shit on your chest.... 
---
Weird how your own first link also contradicts itself:
---
" Funny thing though.. is that the total of MMO players has been consistently growing, but the growth spike seems to have only struck popular MMOs (besides ESO and OSRS). Furthermore, the last dataset for total MMO players was in 2018-9, does this mean that this graph would also be hit by the spike once its updated? "
---
The second link I do like but it basically points out the same thing as the first one with the exception of total population of MMO gamers so its not exactly the whole picture.  
---
Your third link is a shit site with anecdotes essentially akin to buzzfeed but worse.  
---
So the total number of MMO players looks to be going up and getting spread across multiple mmos; IE to keep more players the game needs to make changes and do better to attract them from others.
---
Context is important, so the answer to my question was no you dont know what they mean.
---
&gt; But he's your friend, you trust him enough to cyno you in blind where you might die but not enough to hold your titan while you do something else with the alt? Seems theres a flaw in your logic here. 
---
No there isn,t this literally does not discount my point at all.
---
&gt;I'm not bitching about changes, YOU are bitching about changes, I'm bitching about you whining about having to adapt to the changes that really ARE coming because you dont think they're fair.  
---
&gt;Again, to be perfectly clear, I'm not unhappy with any changes the game company has made, I am however super critical of the stupid idead put forward by a non game developer
---
Right, so in other words you are crying about proposed changes but you think they're dumb when they're not because you again cant see past your own little world, got it.
---
You have taken breaks so not exactly all of that....umm fatso?
---
Wonderful news, because without hopelessly addicted stockholm syndrome cases like you shilling this garbage until the bitter end, the sinking of this ship wouldn't be half as entertaining.
---
Holy shit are we still crying over this?
---
ROFL by max tank you mean max feed fit? There is no carrier pilot making 100 mil an hour that's high end super ratting numbers... You've never even gone ratting in a carrier have you?
---
I only skimmed because you put up a wall of text without paragraphs. This is a not-nice thing to do.
---
Also, you‚Äôre taking a break. You‚Äôre not really leaving. You never leave.
---
You‚Äôve been doing this for 13 years. This is where your home is. You‚Äôll be back.
---
People always come back.
---
 I'm so mad at Hard Knocks! And I thought I was going to be a star. 'Course it all fell apart. I never did know who I could trust, and people I thought were my friends actually were my enemies.

I was working in construction, then I was in a hit-man role, and they sent me to a jailbreak and I got to wear this crazy suit. It was my lucky day! I was working for a hit man who was an ex-con.

Ive taken one break for 2 months last year in 13 years.

im hearing so many horrorstories about chipotle that i'm glad i've never even seen that stuff, let alone eaten.
---
&gt; Let me help you, there is no change made, present, past, or future that the company plans that I'm unhappy with. 
---
lol okay sure.
---
&gt;Your ~~stupid~~ fucking ideas dont fall under that category. You dont get to present a stupid fucking idea and when shouted down for your stupidity, claim people dont like change.  
---
&gt;They just dont like your stupid ideas, which is radically different.
---
Brilliant - I fixed that for ya.  
---
&gt;You dont get to present a stupid fucking idea and when shouted down for your stupidity, claim people dont like change.
---
Yeah definitely not shouted down for the stupidty but rather the fear of change so yes I do.
---
See above.
---
Don't even assume CCP will fix things mentioned in devblogs.
---
And I'd be force dby CCP. Imagine that
---
Nice self-own, there.
---
The thing is, you guys make 20-30 jumps in nullsec. If we take us for example: C2(HS/C3). Lets have a C3 static with a small corp in it, that also has a HS static and no sites. = we have no money/PvE to make, no ISK to earn. If we want to have any content, it has to be PvP and we probably have to do 20 Highsec Jumps first to even get to 0 itself, and then it's probably only gate camp "content" - it's not about the jumps. We as a group use every hole we get, even if it's the scenario above. We even found good content in the drone lands already, usually though we take 30 jumps to ER/Branch/wherever to get some.
---
This is though, because we have no NS static and use every single one we can get. If you have this as your main content, doing that every single day I can imagine it to be very frustrating.
---
Actually I have an idea and will post it.
---
The blood kernel is in the second room of the "Contested Amarr Bastion of Blood" complex in the Koona system. Warp to the plex, take the acceleration gate leading to "the slope", and then take the acceleration gate in the room you land in. The blood kernel is a "Deadspace Overseer's Structure" - you may have to modify your overview settings to see it there. I've included a couple of images to show you where it is in the second room:

If the only purpose a new player has is to get in a frig with a scram and be the tackle for a fleet, then it explains why 90% quit.
---
They need to be useful early in whatever they want, either market trading, mining, manufacturing, etc., not just a dumb tackle that dies in 5 seconds.

pls stop you retard

would be nice to have wh frig rats scram, to have rorqs spawn avengers, and have citadel weapons not affect drifters
---
other than that, wh krabbing is fine comparatively speaking
---
I think the difference in mentality between null and WH space was created largely by the existence of local chat, perhaps in time there wont be as stark a contrast between the voice of null and WH space. I think if you are more comfortable taking risks then you'll likely be much more comfortable with change
---
&gt; Right, so in other words you are crying about proposed changes but you think they're dumb when they're not because you again cant see past your own little world, got it.
---
No, again, your stupid fucking ideas aren't proposed changes and theres literally zero reason for anybody to support your stupidity.  Not liking your ideas because you're a whiney faggot doesn't mean we're against change, it means we're against you.
---
&gt;Context is important
---
Right, and in this instance, the context is proving you're a dumb ass, as the population of MMOS has declined, per game.  There is no MMO doing great (as i originally said) and ALL of them are experiencing a player population decline.
---
Thanks for helping out.
---
If some is an expressing a concern on the internet
---
1. You agree, and it's valid feedback
---
2. You disagree, and it's whining

Death should not punish you side of what you are purposefully risking.

If I don't have a choice on whether to risk it then it shouldn't be risked.

* Ship - yes

* Implants - yes (jump clones should be easier tho)
---
* SP - no

Aww, you sound like an angry carrier ratter.

People do tend to fall into this trap. Reddit is no more representative of Eve players than talk radio is representative of the body politic. It's just relatively few people bitching really really hard.

I've never met a wormholer who \*doesn't\* want this to happen. I know you know this, I'm just concurring.

Where to buy game time the cheapest (with real money)?
---
This guy...here... doe not hunt.
---
Good lord. The newbros are such babies. Cavalry Ravens? Nanovags? You little shits haven't lived through serious nerfs at all.
---
Uhhh duh? Welcome to Reddit?
---
I hope so. Rolling for content is integral to finding fights in w-space.
---
Had a connection to Esoteria, no dinos came through.
---
Never not train cloaking to V.
---
&gt; No, again, your stupid fucking ideas aren't proposed changes and theres literally zero reason for anybody to support your stupidity. Not liking your ideas because you're a whiney faggot doesn't mean we're against change, it means we're against you. 
---
Yeah you're the whiney faggot here, quite clearly.  Your jimmies are quite rustled.
---
&gt;Right, and in this instance, the context is proving you're a dumb ass, as the population of MMOS has declined, per game. There is no MMO doing great (as i originally said) and ALL of them are experiencing a player population decline.  
---
&gt;Thanks for helping out.
---
Actually by your own links it says ESO is doing great so thanks for proving me right...again.
---
They're called "paragraphs"
---
On the other hand last saturday was the highest peak in three months.
---
Two can play the statistics game.
---
&gt; Yeah definitely not shouted down for the stupidty but rather the fear of change so yes I do
---
Some random asshole walks up to you and says "I think you should be castrated", of course you're like "what, no thats dumb fuck off", and now that person is dancing in the street yelling "look at this guy afraid of change".
---
You're that guy.
---
Your ideas are dumb, the game company wouldnt touch them with a 10 foot pole, that doens't mean people are afraid of change, it means your ideas aren't good.  People don't have to enact bad ideas just to satisfy your fragile little ego.
---
Rolling hic makes the probability to be rolled out relatively small even if you don't use your brain at all. Remember how the wormholer cried when those where removed...
---
I thought they removed any loss of SP from the game including T3 ships?
---
Also revisit autopilot.  The most USELESS feature in EVE.  Seriously so bad I think it's only purpose is to separate the super bad from the regular bad.
---
nah im the other one in that example, you're the jester here.  
---
&gt; Your ideas are dumb, the game company wouldnt touch them with a 10 foot pole, that doens't mean people are afraid of change, it means your ideas aren't good. People don't have to enact bad ideas just to satisfy your fragile little ego. 
---
No you're just afraid of change, that's literally what all your little temper tantrum is about.
---
Why would krabs have no issues rolling easily but PvPers would in this case? Krabs are normally the risk averse, unless you mean not knowing hole size means PvPers would no longer roll at all as they'd be risking assets.
---
So far we don't know any information. So there is nothing to adapt too. But killing of entire regions of space just to add "chaos" seems counter productive...
---
Leshaks already can deal 4k dps heated
---
You still can't name a specific change im scared of.....
---
However, you are right in that the idea of you being in charge of making any choices for anything seems frightening
---
yeah! They could just roll for content - oh wait

---
Was stuff like First Light on the Fifth Day really that pro-PIBC? The Leaf Queen garnered as much affection in comments as anyone on the PIBC side.
---
As an aside, from my understanding, I don't think PIBC are able to strangle that server primarily by virtue of diplomatic victory. They were able to do so by winning key battles and then getting up earlier, staying up later and ruthlessly dropping their fleet on anything that moves. Some of their enemies surely joined them but they didn't just incorporate the bulk of their enemies: they tried to wipe them out (and many left the server). 
---
That's the same ruthless energy as the Goon and Bob hellcamps of their day (I remember Molle saying that once he'd subjugated all of nullsec into the GBC he'd go for low sec and high sec as well) and that represents fanaticism, which is a virtue dear to RnK. 
---
That sort of energy in a virtual world is a rare thing in an increasingly casual, tame gaming landscape where competition is funnelled into tightly governed spaces where corporate-friendly folks compete to see who can say/do the least controversial things. So in that sense, the people who put that kind of energy and fanaticism into Eve, even if they lead mega-coalitions, are still the few. 
---
Still, philosophy aside, on a pragmatic level I do tend to favour the underdog on the battlefield, which obviously latter-day PIBC weren't on Serenity. But then I also knew Fulcrum long before PIBC were "The Empire". 
---
(Not that I had the slightest influence on PIBC diplomatic policy, btw - and in fact, that's probably not even up to Fulcrum either. Military Bun has always steered the PIBC ship and that's his journey as much as RnK is mine)
---
I expect that once they settle in AOM will be a good addition to the TQ mix.
---
&gt; You still can't name a specific change im scared of.....
---
Still wont go in circles and do your work for you...
---
&gt; However, you are right in that the idea of you being in charge of making any choices for anything seems frightening 
---
Never said that ;).  
---
Learned alot about you today though, holy shit, you are a piece of work that's for sure.
---
&gt; Actually by your own links it says ESO is doing great so thanks for proving me right...again.
---
The article is old, ESO has not suffered the same fate as the rest, feel free to check.
---
&gt;Your jimmies are quite rustled
---
No, i detest people like you 'GUYS ITS NOT FAIR THIS COMPANY IS TRYING TO MAKE MONEY'
---
Have ad block on. All it takes is one fucking ad and you'll be back.
---
There was a large NPC battle a few weeks ago and no players were on grid to see. A mining fleet spawned and drifters attacked them and it kept escalating as the AI responded. There is an article about it
---
"follow the chain" ... I feel like you've never lived in a wormhole.   It takes real, actual time (5-10 min at least) to scan down a system in totality if you don't have a virtue set. It takes literally HOURS to build a wormhole map for your average-sized wh corp.  And after spending what might be hours scanning out that chain, you might find literally no one on your chain.  Literally. No one.  And then it might even dead end.  
---
At this point the only way to find more content then is to either (1) wait till your statics cycle or (2) roll your statics and scan a new chain.  The first means you might as well log off and wait until tomorrow. The second means you can find a fight or some sort of content in an hour or two.
---
Amazing photos. Thank you.  This is exactly where I have been looking for it and its not in my overview.  I have my overview set to show "all" under the general tab and nothing.
---
Pick-up groups (PUGs) that other games make very easy, should be easier. The closest we have is probably warptome incursions which has to manage its own system 
---
Having this in game e.g. someone can put up a fleet and have a purpose and inspect people's for or something like that, to join a temporary event like a trig invasion or sansha incursion. I think this is what a lot of newer players to eve expect but isn't really there. The only fleet I see when I open the window as not a member of a corp is the mining fleet 
---
Make all this easier and easier for new players to get into cool fights quickly.
---
&gt; The article is old, ESO has not suffered the same fate as the rest, feel free to check. 
---
lol Then you shouldnt have use it as an example, sounds like when I poke holes in your argument you arent learning.
---
&gt; No, i detest people like you 'GUYS ITS NOT FAIR THIS COMPANY IS TRYING TO MAKE MONEY' 
---
1. I never said that.
---
2. Detest all you like.  You have proven that you are really just not a person worth talking to in general and are really mean when your world gets challenged.
---
Sure i can. Its called open a tab and be l33t homie.
---
I propose you stop posting.
---
This is a stupid comment.
---
I just read in the comments this is your first video. So some free do's and don'ts:
---
\&gt; Brilliant intro. Made me enlarge it too fullscreen.
---
\&gt; Lovely music choice. 
---
\&gt; My god don't blur the overview. That is 60% of the video. I want to SEE what is happening besides some purple turds moving around.
---
Yep. Its honestly why everyone got worried about the statement about not being able to roll wormholes since that actually generates content in WH space. Without that, things could get really stagnate
---
&gt; Still wont go in circles and do your work for you...
---
This is you avoiding it because you can't.  You think your suggestions for game changes are on a level playing field with the actual game company changes and well, they're just not. At all.
---
&gt;Never said that ;).
---
Its what you're suggesting with your 'you're afraid of change' bullshit, changes you suggest are dumb.  Because you're dumb.
---
&gt;Learned alot about you today though, holy shit, you are a piece of work that's for sure.
---
Eat shit child rapist.
---
Idk if I agree with that.  There's a point where anoms are so lucrative that "already replaced" is a viable and profitable plan.  IE, a VNI paid for itself in less than 2 hours, so losing one every 6 is no big deal.  Buffing anom payouts only moves that cutoff point earlier.  Reliably ratting without loss shouldn't be possible, people just need to accept the ships-as-ammo paradigm.
---
The problem with "dying to fast to get help" is that it results in less content, but you can't buff ratting ship buffer enough to make a gang gank take 30 seconds without killing solo hunting.  Making PvE a more group endeavor would help, but part of the problem is how different PvP and PvE optimized fits are.  Closing that gap somehow would go a long way.

Their options were

1. Adapt

I guess they chose the latter.

i wish - it would've been more productive.
---
No 12 T in blue lot alone is not fine with so small population.
---
Thanks for the pointers!
---
&gt; Why are you ratting and mining for isk?
---
Because they're easy and I can do them without too much effort.
---
&gt; Those are probably the worst ways to earn isk in EVE if you care about your isk per hour. 
---
Then why is everyone bitching about it to the point CCP decided to nerf it all? :thinking:
---
&gt; Null sec is supposed to be dangerous.
---
Null sec is supposed to be a sandbox with less rules than low or high. If my group wants to take a few system and keep them safer than their surroundings, why does that bother you so much?
---
Yeah, I mean we all abuse that mechanic and it's to our advantage, but it is definitely a fair target for changing.
---
I'm really mean period, what have you ever done to deserve any treatment other than this?
---
You DID say it, leme quote it for you
---
&gt;Which is an awful model..
---
Thats you, crying that the game company is trying to turn a profit.
---
Don't ruin the salt mines, come on dude.

Monkey paw grants your wish. Value of blue loot is tripled but all wormholes now lead to Stain.

Stuff like that is incredibly nuanced and involved stuff like shoving homosexual men I to a different, lower class. It's nothing like college white girl special snowflake shit.
---
Never have actually been there since there is no LS gate.
---
&gt; nullsec is meant to be pvp centric
---
Since when has it not been? Do you think all of nullsec is Delve?
---
&gt; There are plenty of other games to play that cater to people like you with decreased attention spans.
---
Nice bait, but you could be more subtle.
---
you are aware that is all there is right? sleepers don't drop any regular loot and have no bounties that blueloot is the only thing worth anything that you get. there is no regular loot you can melt into minerals or sell on.
---
Also remove anomalies and make hunters have to scan them down. hah get fucked right
---
It's a great way to make money. I only have like 30 hours so my colony now is my first real "success" but it's working. 
---
The first half year or so plays like it normally would but after that you can slowly ramp up production until you have some dude who's dedicated job is making cocaine and joints lol.

Just gotta keep ur dudes outta the stash or monitor it so they don't get addicted, but they're useful tools to have in case of mental breaks.

The SP event has been really good for me and new player friends. We are finally able to do lots of training for things that were simply too long to do. I also love the recent game changes and am having fun. My alliance guys are pretty great too and I‚Äôve made lots of friends. I love people uwu
---
[oh canada.](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/804521-edgy)
---
Lol, funny NOW people are super concerned about sources of intel.
---
Actually the kills appear to be spread out more over the regions. Besides. For everyone apparently docking up, no extensive decrease is actually a good thing.
---
wait, jita can have WH ? I though it was a special system (I saw WH directly to amarr but never to Jita). Mind you, a direct hole to perimeter will be equally as bas :D ( or good, depends on who you're asking :p )
---
My old C5 corp made billions per day with just a few hours effort. Any buffs to blue loot would be far too lucrative honestly.
---
How did you become such a shit poster
---
Nah, I got 37 to the same address
---
Looking at you, wardec changes.
---
I see a RNK logo
---
i like it
---
&gt; You could leave them. Just get a holder.
---
You still didn't risk magically losing it when you logged off.
---
&gt;If you care that much about the ship you'll have it safe. If life is more important, it's space pixels.
---
That's such a pathetic way to look at it lmfao. I put time and effort into the game, it shouldn't get pissed away from inactivity. It's just one more reason for a person who's not currently playing to not come back and one more reason for a newer player who's considering investing a serious amount of time to not stick around.
---
If we use the rough assumption that each venture, unboosted is pulling in 8 m3/s, that's 480 m3 per minute. 
---
One veldspar rock is .1 m3 per unit. So that's 4800 veldpsar a minute roughly. That compresses down to 48 blocks at current jita rates is 2000 isk per, so 96k isk per minute (but for ease lets say 100k per minute. 
---
If the botter uses 10 botting ventures, he makes 1 mil a minute. Assuming 10 minutes is spent doing other things like warping off and unloading, we say 50 minutes in an hour so 50 mil an hour. 
---
And if he does it for 10 hours a day (which is low for botters, but is low to avoid detection) he makes 500 mil a day. Do that for 4 days and he can omega an account to boost even more money.
---
&gt; Because they're easy and I can do them without too much effort. I'd rather spend my active time PVPing or doing something that helps my corp/alliance.
---
They are the worst ways to earn isk. If you take a few moments to figure out better ways to earn isk you can have more liquid funds to buy PVP ships which helps your corp/alliance.
---
&gt; Then why is everyone bitching about it to the point CCP decided to nerf it all? :thinking:
---
Because they were too scalable for nullbears which breaks the game. People can scale the methods I mentioned earlier (contract flipping, scamming) too, but the majority of players are so focused on ratting being their only source of income they ignore it.
---
&gt; This isn't a solution. If I wanted to be in a wormhole, I'd be there.
---
Yes it is. If you do not care to adapt then you can die.
---
&gt; Because it means the game will have players logging back in after a while that they've been unable to play/didn't feel the urge, to have all their stuff gone 
---
That's literally almost every MMO game in existence, though. I get that it's now a game mechanic but that doesn't mean you can't try to fix it as it's clearly, fundamentally broken.
---
Surely there's room for balancing here.
---
Don't forget the totally unexpected increase in mining
---
&gt; Lowsec has what you're looking for in terms of quick, cheap content or short mission running sessions.
---
No it doesn't. I've been playing this game for over a decade. I know what I fucking want to do. I wasn't abusing anoms or shying away from conflict. I don't have 30 multiboxing rorquals. I just want to blaze a few anoms when I'm bored so I can afford fleets.
---
Now I can't. Your little crusade to punish nullbears is just fucking everyone over who doesn't have 50 hours a week to put into EVE.
---
freighter rigs were in a devblog
---
Please let this happen.  I want to see what 100 supers do, when Bob our lord and savior, closes the WH
---
Local was a two way street of intel, hunters could see activity, locals could see threats. Now just being logged in literally lights up a map of ones presence. 
---
I actually like the black out. Its the renaissance of black ops. And skills like being quick on dscan are more valuable. There's no skill in looking at a map that lights up with activity.
---
&gt;I too sit cloaked in belts/off moons and call it elite pvp hunter tactics. I've even got my killmails on my moms refrigerator, and she even added star stickers!
---
This is you friend. Do you.
---
Not gonna lie I wish I'd bought a few dozen recons a month or 2 ago lol
---
CCP is the one that made rorquals OP and scalable. CCP made citadels completely broken. CCP made skill injectors. CCP still hasn't fixed any of these. Now they're trying to treat the symptoms of players' natural responses to the gameplay mechanics they were given. We've had all this for over 3 years now. If they want to nerf everything they've had players working towards for the last 3 1/2 years, then I hope they aren't surprised when most of the people that played during that time quit. Because they got the players they were going after, even if it was unintentional. 
---
There still isn't any sign that CCP has some grand plan to fix things. Everything is just reactive. If they said, hey, we acknowledge this thing is broken, here's where we want to go, here's the fixes, we're giving you 6 months to adapt and prepare for changes, that would be one thing. But it's the quick changes that will make people just quit. "Hey guys, starting next week, no local lol." "So starting next month, all your cyno Alta won't work unless they can fly force recons or blops battleships." These decisions all reek of desperation.
---
&gt; That's not even remotely close to what they said when they were throwing stuff out about mass predictability. 
---
you do know that's _already a thing_, right?
---
a wormhole is &lt;x&gt; kg, +/- .... what is it, 15%?
---
imagine if they dial the swing up to 50%.
---
Autopilot isn't useless. When I blow up in a naked clone I self destruct to jita fit another ship and turn on autopilot to a low sec border. This doesn't get me there faster, but it allows me to do something else while my ship gets into a position to fight.
---
Carrying/transporting expensive goods/ships is a career, it's called logistics, whether it be personal or sourced. If autopilot warped to zero it would be the equivalent of getting tackled and someone pushing the autopvp button. It's not supposed to be as good as actually playing the game for glaringly obvious reasons.
---
&gt; You still didn't risk magically losing it when you logged off.
---
And with this change you still won't. What's your point?
---
Multiple accounts needs fixing. Not as a tool, but as a broken game mechanic. They should allow one account to launch all three characters simultaneously, maybe with additional cost, maybe not.
---
/r/oopsdidntmeanto
---
It was pretty obvious mate.
---
I second this.
---
The only evidence you have is fewer accounts logging in. You don‚Äôt know if they are bots or people. 
---
Everything else in your post is narrative. That is the narrative from a carebear perspective.
---
Can someone link what we are all talking about?  Holman said something about WH‚Äôs?
---
Oh I agree, the potential is there to make crazy isk but its difficult to do alone unlike in NS.   
---
Anoms dont respawn in WH's so you cannot do it 23/7 and once you farm out your system its time to play the rolling game.  You never know who or what you will roll into then.
---
Nav skills to V. All ships will benefit
---
I think they mean JF being able to jump to jammed systems. From the looks of it the cyno change could be more permanent than we expected and introducing a freight cyno will in all likelihood mean they won't be able to use covert cynos.
---
&gt;I don't see how they can fix industry in Null? 
---
uhh... it's probably the only part of null that isn't broken?
---
Yeah, you know that wh lifetimes were already a thing, and they did just _turn the dial_ and it actually didn't just_work.tm
---
&gt; I currently have a shitty mouse
---
Yeah CCP, fix that ASAP
---
As Hilmar said Burger and him are not Devs. You have to pay a dev for that and CCP is very against spending money for dev to do things for some weird reason.
---
It‚Äôs more of the using dreads to make obscene amounts of money, not so much the actual escalation itself.
---
No challenging targets in high sec. Choosing to bring 15 or 25 catalysts isnt challenging :P and just because you find ganking to be fun doesnt mean anyone else does.
---
Yeah, if it results in less holes being rolled, it'll mean a loss in content.
---
Almost made it 5 before I got the itch.
---
You should check out the new Monthly Security Report that is gonna report back on bannings and anti bot stuff on a monthly basis.

---
I'm sure a carrier putting out 3000dps only makes 10m more isk/hour than a cruiser doing 500dps. Yes, this makes total sense.
---
Don‚Äôt turrets track in degrees?
---
the funny thing is I am waiting for when PA starts to implement their brand of money-making.  We already see it with login rewards just a taste.  It won't be long before we see a big announcement with a change, eve will be completely free to play but if you want to train faster get more loot etc you will need to buy a "value pack" for the low low price of 19.99 a month.   min maxers will do it because eve has programmed us to seek out the most isk efficient way to produce something.   PA will benefit because instead of 15 bucks a month they get more players and a lot of those players will pay 4 bucks more a month to train faster loot more per kill mine more per minute etc.  It will happen eventually.     most folks will do it because they want to be called a poor.   and we will have become BDO in space.  Think i am wrong just look at the trig drops and the RNG.   wont be long before you can downgrade an enhanced piece when trying to get it to V down III   those that play BDO will know those symbols.   CCP can try and spin this however they want but we are already on the path that PA wants us to be on.
---
We know, you and other nullbears are throwing a tantrum.
---
I don't go there anymore, nullbloc grounds used to be good roaming grounds when people actually fought you, but then they decided that playing nullbears inc was better. Oh look, another newbro who quits Eve because his FC can't find content! I wonder why content no longer comes to their doorstep... I guess an arranged brawl will have to do.
---
I'm not arguing that point at all, for sure you're right, its just that in the age of instant intel where TACO and shit like NEAR2 made hunting an episode in tedium the cries about what gave intel were near non existent from people who didn't hunt.
---
Now, not so much. Suddenly we're all worried about what gives what intel.
---
Jump to the cyno if you miss us anytime.  Fly safe o7
---
Another one of these posts. High sec is that way ‚Äî-&gt;
---
I mis-read you first post last night as per tick not per hour, your avg carrier is around 30-40 mill a tick for just a little over 100 mill an hour, but your 200 mill per hour numbers are what supers make, so you have clearly never gone super or carrier ratting.
---
&gt; They are the worst ways to earn isk. If you take a few moments to figure out better ways to earn isk you can have more liquid funds to buy PVP ships which helps your corp/alliance.
---
How about I just play the way I fucking want, and you play the way you want and we'll call it a day? What a novel idea. 
---
But your puritanical bitching has reached CCP so here we are.
---
&gt; Because they were too scalable for nullbears which breaks the game.
---
Cool. The sledgehammer killed the mosquito. And maybe a few other things.
---
I'm not leaving, and I will adapt. Not because of asshats like you thinking you're brilliant for challenging the status quo, but because I like the people I play with - which is the point of EVE. Or at least it used to be.
---
But I won't be logging in as much either, because the adaptations I'm being pushed to are a) spend more time Rorqual mining in groups (which I don't do), b) find another place to play, or c) spend real money on PLEX. Fuck all those options.
---
Krabs have to only a few times. Usually just one static and maybe one connection. They have time to carefully roll that hole or two, you're adding maybe 10 minutes to their krab session.
---
PVPers have to roll repeatedly for hours to find anything. Dura Lexx for example play for like 4 or 5 hours a day, spending the majority of that time rolling. You're adding like 10 minutes to every single hole they roll, and going through 4 empty holes an hour is unbearably slow.

I snapped a photo of the same shot you took and the entire object and even the damaged old acceleration gate is not in my screenshot I think?  [https://ibb.co/Cvp7NcP](https://ibb.co/Cvp7NcP)
---
&gt; I'm really mean period, what have you ever done to deserve any treatment other than this? 
---
Literally the opposite of this is what any decent human being would ask...
---
&gt; You DID say it, leme quote it for you 
---
Remember when I said context was important?  I was referring specifically to the multi account approach that DOES NOT mean I dont think they ashould try to make money, just not with that approach to a video game.  So NO I did not say that.
---
&gt; MMO's have been in serious decline across all titles since 2015, theres nothing wrong with linking a 2017 series of articles about it, the information is still largely valid with one of the only changes being the 2 games doing good now aren't doing that great. It actually reinforces the point. 
---
Ah you are correct, I misread that part.  But that doesnt necessarily mean that we shouldnt try to change to attract more players back and try to at least reverse the curve for our game.
---
If the goal is to increase risk, as they talked about multiple times was the goal.
---
I tracked the data for each character and each day (yes, I like spreadsheets). I missed a few, but results are in:
---
    10,000 - 143 (76.47%)
---
    25,000 - 33 (17.65%)
---
    50,000 - 11 (5.88%)
---
    
---
I would guess the numbers are 75%, 20%, 5% as /u/welsknight said below.
---
I cant seem to find my stored cache of giveafucks to share with the CSM
---
&gt;nullbloc grounds used to be good roaming grounds when people actually fought you, but then they decided that playing nullbears inc was better
---
You mean they got tired of being farmed by your nano gang and made sure that you don't want to hunt in their money making territory?
---
Well they also haven‚Äôt made rapid fire game changing changes like this in the past so I‚Äôm open to the idea that this might be a new CCP we‚Äôre looking at. It‚Äôs a pessimistic hope but hope none the less. Sadly if I had to bet my life on it I‚Äôd put my bet on your argument though.

Once Stainguy stops.

What the f--k do you care anyway. The only thing you fly is a SB BS that requires only enough IQ to hit script input button.

Idiot

Hilmar is a fucking retard, nothing really new here. The only difference is that he's starting to drink the reddit Koolaid and listen to you other fucking retards.
---
Legit wish most of you would unsub and biomass in game.
---
Speculation is a bitch isn't it?
---
A239s that die as soon as you try to jump them?
---
Super heartwarming and refreshing.  Good luck with your masters!
---
how does this relate to my 138.71 tracking value?
---
I ran AFK ratting ships just as much or more than you did. I'm a sov null player as much as you are.
---
"blazing a few anoms" is still pretty safe if you live in a quiet area. By the time you start to raise a profile on Dotlan, you're done krabbing and you can go do something else. If you're in a busy area like Delve, then that's not a very good option. You might want to try a different route, or utilize the tons of Delve players to get a defense fleet rolling.
---
If you're short on time, then there are better ways to make money than afk ratting. DED sites, moons, explo depending on the region.
---
If you've been playing this game for a decade, then you definitely have the SP to easily get into any of those activities. If your flair is right, and you're in initiative, then get some buddies together and defend your space while you farm $$ or I hear you've been taking over all the moons in Syndicate to add to your control of all the moons in Outer Ring and Fountain. If you can't find something in all that, then you have bigger problems.
---
Yore graff is not gud.
---
Hey look its a Z142 thats not EOL, oh boy!
---
And it looks like this dude believed it, lmao. https://zkillboard.com/kill/73085962/
---
right and the changes that most wormholers would like (such as the ones i mentioned) would put a clamp on that faucet, without resorting to something as dumb as lowering the payout.
---
I support them doing this more, the only thing that should matter is patch notes.
---
Angular velocity in the overview is in rad/s, one rad is 57.2 degrees.
---
Bigger group than you think. There's a lot of nullsec and lowsec players who have krab holes, as well as the wormholers themselves.
---
&gt;then nothing gets discussed and ccp makes more changes that people highly dislike or are against.
---
Even when things are discussed and the CSM is consulted and they do ask for feedback they proceed to ignore all of that and do whatever the fuck they want anyway.
---
And then enforce one account? Id get behind that. I see why they didnt initially -- it goes against pretty much all game design ever -- but when we're at a point where everone has so many accounts, it seems prudent to limit it somehow, while ackowlesging that alts are required. I really like this solution. It feels the most elegant.
---
Nah. He figures his way of getting isk got nerfed so time to attack another‚Äôs. That overrides all logic at this point.
---
Good call
---
Lol the tears over the last few months have made me fat and the most hydrated I have ever been.
---
That dog don't hunt ....
---
even if your static rolled directly into hostile territory there would still be no need to panic. No one is coming through that hole for at least a minute. plenty of time to get off grid and tethered up.
---
the reason why new wormhole spawns are dangerous when ratting isn't because of the holes themselves. There's nothing inherently dangerous about them. It's the people that come through them that make them dangerous. Even if someone is looking for the k162 when your static rolls over they have to still notice it's there, scan it, look through, call for people to kill ratters, and then the people to kill even if they are organized have to warp to the hole. Plenty of time tbh.
---
They get dangerous when they are being rolled for content directly. This means the fleet is already assembled and ready to jump the hole once tackle is up. If you make the k162 spawn instantly on rolling the hole you no longer control when your target gets to find out when you rolled it. your target knows instantly and that time you spent scanning and warping to the hole is time they have to get safe and you get nothing.
---
Maybe a 5 min delay on the spawning of the k162 would be better so you can keep that control but it doesn't last long enough to really take advantage of defensively? And won't massless statics make it safer for null since they just now have to collectively evict every nullsec static (and they can bring endless numbers of people in for that) to keep people from staging from them?
---
Assuming the target is in range your guns can track at 2.4 rad/sec(1rad=57.29deg).
---
i wonder if this bot steals all of my personal info and sells it to ~~chinese~~ asian dudes
---
Well, not in Delve...but I can say most have just grown tired of the same old kitey gang, camping the same old gates, running off like they've always done when we respond with something that can catch them.  If you're tired of it, you can be certain that the same is true for most everyone.  The new injected player wants his kills and he wants them now.  Gone are the days of setting traps and springing them...so to get kills they go for the ratters, the miners, and anyone else not really bent on shooting anything.
---
In other news, look, there's a small gang camping the T5Z gate in 1DQ, surprise, surprise.
---
Great feedback! Thank you for the response
---
You want to see helpful responses go to the eve forums where people give input and CCP ignore it, while the CSM just make fun of people in the comments for having an opinion. That's why I stopped posting there years ago.
---
Great soundtrack! Really enjoy'd the pvp!
---
r/ihadastroke
---
Interesting, a lot of my friends returned to the game in large numbers and are loving life right now.
---
Sure we are. We will just go to nullsec which is preferred without ability to roll statics.
---
&gt; Literally the opposite of this is what any decent human being would ask...
---
lol, sure.  most decent human beings i know say respect is earned.
---
&gt;Remember when I said context was important? I was referring specifically to the multi account approach that DOES NOT mean I dont think they ashould try to make money, just not with that approach to a video game. So NO I did not say that.
---
Lol, you dont mind them making money as long as they do it how you say.  Well, they way THEY want to do it has kept them in business for 16 years, and resulted in a sale of the company for 300+ million actual dollars.
---
Wheres your personal benchmark for your good business choices?
---
You [right now](https://i.imgur.com/nhn9YUf.jpg).
---
What about all the other Null Sec alliances and the systems they've ratted in? As you are comparing the entirety of WH space with just one region. (Genuinely curious on the math).
---
&gt; I'm being pushed to are a) spend more time Rorqual mining in groups (which I don't do), b) find another place to play, or c) spend real money on PLEX. Fuck all those options.
---
You are **WRONG** and your mindset of refusing alternatives is your own issue. 
---
Good luck in space.
---
Im with you!
---
I think the black out has shown exactly how powerful "free" intel can be. And i believe the black out has been over all healthy for the game. But now with the focus on intel, coupled with ccp actually making changes, its time to examine all forms of ingame, and api parsed sources of intel. Given the current low skill forms of intel, that greatly favor the hunter, it can be stifling to certain styles of gameplay in a sandbox game. 
---
If it helped the game getting rid of local, why is it unreasonable to think blacking out esi, and ingame map intel would also help the game. I think it helps keep the hunter / prey dynamics in balance.
---
Maybe tie in seeing "bounty" payouts by faction standing?  Like if you have high caldari standing you can see where people are being paid by caldari to rat - etc
---
Gotta please the vocal Minority
---
Oh do you use some sort of a filter, because surely the tears are too salty and would dehydrate you instead.
---
After you train covert ops cloak, no point before. And, in an Astero you can get to instawarp (under 2second align time), and fit a couple of warp stabs on top if your skills are decent. Love it. But, wait till you are good at not dying in a heron before you try not to die in a 100mil fit.
---
prove it.
---
&gt; lol, sure. most decent human beings i know say respect is earned. 
---
Then you sure haven't earned it and I doubt they are decent human beings...
---
&gt;Lol, you dont mind them making money as long as they do it how you say. Well, they way THEY want to do it has kept them in business for 16 years, and resulted in a sale of the company for 300+ million actual dollars.  
---
&gt;Wheres your personal benchmark for your good business choices?
---
Not forcing people to use multiple accounts in a video game is a pretty good one.  As well it was the sale of their technology not multiple accounts that earned them that 300 million so dont conflate.  As well lack of growth of profits tends to disagree with your benchmark...
---
You sure like being wrong alot.
---
Well. You might not agree with him. You also might think he‚Äôs a little nuts. But in the scheme of /r/eve, this is worth reading.
---
I cant open twitch in my work.

Any of you can resume what the video says?

Thank you

---
5 min delay would be fine, too. it should be way lower than currently though.
---
touch√© for the last point you made. that would indeed a problem. this makes the randomized mass approach on kspace holes way more appealing and pretty much ousts the massless alternative.
---
thanks for your input.
---
Except you will. Especially if you have multiple supers on one account.
---
Response for the thank you! Feedback Great
---
That is not the problem.
---
The fact that is so easy to build it, you can dock it, and it wont die (faxes) is the real problem.
---
Injectors were never the problem, because wallet warriors always could buy titan pilots in forum.
---
I sold so many titan/super pilots before injectors get into the game.
---
good reminder! btw, I enjoy this game. 
---
nothing else to say. ;)
---
No no, im specifically asking you what company you've grown and sold for how much money.
---
You seem to think you're better at business than the company so lets compare the two of you.
---
&gt;As well it was the sale of their technology not multiple accounts that earned them that 300 million so dont conflate
---
Multiple accounts was likely one of the drivers, and their technology also encompasses those multiple accounts.  Pearl looked and saw a company that had talked players into maintaining multiple accounts in a genre where they're having trouble keeping players paying for a single account.
---
Also lol lack of profits, they sold the company for 300 million, do you think Pearl was out just doing icelandic community work?
---
The nano nerfs were good tho.
---
this all made sense when tracking was still in rads/second. It's not tracking has been 'unified' into a number completely unrelated to rads per second that's why people are confused.
---
Or if it is actually connected to rads/second it's never been explained anywhere that i can find. Just obtuse methods to convert from the new system to the old system so that it made sense.
---
BoB is not on your side anymore ...
---
You should also double check it every patch afterwords because sometimes they change the fonts and then the POSes start roaming...
---
well...pitter patter, let's get at 'er

How active the downvote brigade is here?

Big welp energy

&gt; No no, im specifically asking you what company you've grown and sold for how much money.You seem to think you're better at business than the company so lets compare the two of you
---
Ah the old wel lyou havent done it so you cant say shit argument.  Which in itself is bullshit.  I dont fly helicopters but if I see one in a tree I can definitely something went wrong.
---
&gt; Multiple accounts was likely one of the drivers, and their technology also encompasses those multiple accounts. Pearl looked and saw a company that had talked players into maintaining multiple accounts in a genre where they're having trouble keeping players paying for a single account. 
---
No that's you conflating they literally wanted the gaming technology behind the scenes not caring about the multiple accounts...
---
&gt; Also lol lack of profits, they sold the company for 300 million, do you think Pearl was out just doing icelandic community work? 
---
I already addressed this you dont really read well huh?
---
I remember once N3 and Russians were fighting and a Russian titan clicked jump instead of bridge.  Then the N3 titan bridging in tackle dictors hit jump instead of bridge.  Literally everything stopped for a good minute while they both sheepishly warped off field.
---
Best moment I've ever witnessed in EVE.
---
not if coupled with a reduction to say 20-30% of what the current holes are :)
---
&gt;If it helped the game getting rid of local, why is it unreasonable to think blacking out esi, and ingame map intel would also help the game. I think it helps keep the hunter / prey dynamics in balance.
---
I have a theory on why we get that intel, but its literally just a theory.
---
Its in the client and they can't get it out without a major client rewrite.  Local is actually still in the client, I'm told that should you want to see that data and you know how to manipulate the client you still can see it.
---
I'm sure it'd be the same with ESI data, if they eliminated it all the legit players would be blind, all the players who aren't concerned with the rules would still get that data which could make some seriously lopsided situations if one of the big alliances get access to that data while the others dont have it, so until they figure out a fix for that it'll stay. 
---
Not to mention that when Zkill went dark for a weekend literally everybody hated it.
---
You mean bots?
---
That‚Äôs not a good statement on r/eve üòÑüòÑ
---
The overview gives too much information. We should remove the overview.
---
It's the new business method.  Push your customers til their "heads explode" then back off and cater to them.  It's happening in a lot of businesses and to a lot of customers getting frustrated over things out of their control.  In this case, you get what you pay for then they change it...but that is part of the terms.  It would be different if it were a product line that over the years was just continually improved upon that you bought repeatedly, but here CCP has the power to change the product, which is really a service, in any way they desire even while you have "posession" of the product.  Bottom line is, nothing we have in game is owned by us players and if they want to change it to our dislike, they only leave us one option.
---
Of course, they could listen to the players but I'm not certain that happens either unless you are part of the small vocal crowd that makes a scene over it.  The silent majority usually can't be assed to do anything but walk away and by that time, the losers over at CCP will have pushed it too far.
---
Personally, I've removed the automatic resub option and over the next six months all of my accounts will be unsubbed.  Perhaps I'll be back as I'm not inclined to sell off all my stuff or give it away yet and that is really the gut check for if you are committed to leaving aka "head's about to explode".
---
Remember the haw weapon damage change?
---
Sounds like you need a little enjoyment
---
I got 26 emails today, spaced out so they came every few minutes instead of all at once
---
I am an organism that thrives in a highly alkaline environment.
---
Get rid of super docking, and build a new kind of tether that locks the titan in place while its sitting by a keepstar that lets the character access station services/assets.  That means that when a citadel blows up, the titans are free floating.  Then you're also limited by how much physical space around a structure you have for supers/titans.
---
I was promised my mini vexor pet with leopard skins last year
---
I only discovered EVE because i watched a YouTube top 10 video that covered Mittani's "force a suicide" incident. (this was about 3 years ago)
---
I agree with you that a normie-focused, agressive ad campaign would be what the game needs if they want to draw in players.
---
I have just the disc. No idea why i have the disc or when i acquired it. I didn't even try the game till 2008 and didn't start actually playing till 2013.
---
Rest in Dev blogs
---
But what‚Äôs the difference mechanically between rolling for content and rolling away from it? It‚Äôs not like the wormhole can detect if there is content down the chain and decide whether or not to roll based on that
---
My current titan pilot literally started her career as a holding toon.  I'm perfectly fine going back to those days.
---
Yep start 100 accounts get to char screen collect points log-off got to pad those number for ccp stockholders lol.
---
 Yep eve is dead, but there are 8000000 alpha's we are fine lol
---
In the good old days most people had a sitter alt who spent most of their time in it except during combat.
---
No worries, just looking out for you, and anyone with eyes.
---
Yeah, and you still never magically lost your titan. Why are people acting like this is a "gotchya"?
---
Jeeze no wonder you aren't on the csm anymore
---
You did if you didn't have a sitter.  Unpiloted titans have always been free for the taking when its house blew up.
---
I was thinking like, you cannot use the same chat as everyone else (who is a regular capsuleer, as opposed to a, say, Blood Raider), started with the same low SP amount but trained skills more quickly (as your character is permadeath), and so on. Can't use the same markets, **can** go to high-sec, but everything besides Concord is hostile, and so on.
---
You'd basically end up with a faction of players who were essentially Blood Raiders (or some other faction, this is just an example), that operated independently and separately from all of the other capsuleers. It would essentially be the EVE equivalent of "hardcore mode," for those who are really keen on PvPing everything and living off the grid. You'd probably have to give them a small region of space that only they can access in order to prevent some massive blob from 23/7 camping them.
---
It's likely a combination of factors. No big wars means there's not a lot of destruction, and sourplus items are stockpiling everywhere, leading to reduced manufacturing in general.
---
&gt; Ah the old wel lyou havent done it so you cant say shit argument. Which in itself is bullshit. I dont fly helicopters but if I see one in a tree I can definitely something went wrong.
---
Again, you know fuck all, what if that was the only safe place to land the chopper?  When you look at something you're completely unfamiliar with and make assumptions you end up an asshole.
---
&gt;No that's you conflating they literally wanted the gaming technology behind the scenes not caring about the multiple accounts...
---
Give me any evidence at all to support that choice. My evidence that you're wrong is that they didn't need to buy the company to get at the tech, none of which is remarkable in anyway shape or form.  They also didn't just close down eve and harvest the tech involved in it, they've kept the game running and and continued its development, further undermining your point.  If you buy a company for its tech, you harvest that and shed the skeleton of the company to keep costs down because you're a for profit business.
---
So, do you have any evidence to support your 'they bought it for the tech' position?  I bet you dont.
---
&gt;I already addressed this you dont really read well huh? 
---
Making up random shit is not addressing an issue.
---
He was my inspiration for this shitpost
---
Not sure if salty, sarcastic, stupid or a combination of those... so confusing.
---
&gt;nullsec changes hurt krabs and bots exclusively.
---
Incorrect. Changes to nullsec effect the majority of the game as its the main source of Minerals, PI, Modules, ships and ISK in the game. The fact you dont even know this shows your understanding of not just Nullsec but the game as a whole is severely lacking. 
---
&gt; if your spodbrain actually understood wormhole mechanics then you'd realize this change hurts pvp groups more than krabs
---
Also incorrect as you are purely looking at this from a defending Wormholer POV. Having a wormhole be harder to roll or removing the mass limit (Both of which Hilmar mentioned as possible changes.) would allow wormholers to have a more stable connection from their hole to Null (Hole cant be counter rolled by a small group in a gang of Higgs fit Sigils.) or be able to bring more and larger ships to counter cap umbrellas if they get rid of the mass limit, but as a balance to that they will also have the added risk of a invasion from a Null, Low, High or even enemy Wormhole PvP group meaning that Wormholes will become a more active arena of combat requiring an active defence of their Wormhole space instead of the current meta of throwing cheap easily replaceable ships at a wormhole until it pops which is the very opposite of PVP.
---
And the fact that SOME wormholers (Not even a majority are salty just the few very vocal ones who were VERY happy to rub any slight nerf in Nulls face only a few days ago. As an example a lot of my old WH corp are very happy with this possible change as things like the mass limits heavily restricted how they approached things like Null cap escalations etc.) are very salty about CCP not making a change, but just daring to mention a possible one in the future is the basis of my post.
---
The Age of Chaos is here to make Eve risker for all not just a certain group. The sooner you accept this the easier it will be. But if you wanna stay salty go ahead its just another salty reply I get to enjoy. 
---
7o.
---
It‚Äôs a good meme but it‚Äôs for omegas only
---
imagine not realizing how many people who play eve fondly remember classic WOW and actually plan to go back at least for a little while just for the feels.
---
Hilmar makes the impression on me like he does hold his own game in serious contempt.
---
No no, I‚Äôve been proven wrong. The average player only has 1.7 accounts with 65% of them only having a single account.
---
I‚Äôm not sure how bot accounts figure into that, and the data wasn‚Äôt explained how it was gathered, but it wasn‚Äôt noted it wasn‚Äôt perfectly accurate but it‚Äôs Quant showing graphs. Oh and apparently that 65% is old news and actually it‚Äôs more like 80% of players only have one account now.
---
Nobody fucking knows how you have so many people multiboxong rorquals so that it‚Äôs become a ‚Äúproblem‚Äù on ten accounts when everyone only has one or two accounts though. Mysteries of the void I guess.
---
"Eve is a friendship making machine"
---
I always believed the best ship in even is friendship!
---
I‚Äôm just envious you got a classic balanced 1v1 fight.
---
Oh no, please, go ahead and jump into a screeching panic.
---
yeah, there latest add push focuses on how you can spend money on plex to catch up to existing players. I'm not sure they realize how bad of an idea it is to sell the game to folks on the concept of "you are REALLY behind, but you can pay us to catch up, isn't that awesome?"
---
Why? Why do you care so much about who other people's internet spaceship characters are?
---
Probably because at first he sounded like he meant no rolling mechanics, which is terrible and dumb. What he meant was no sealing yourself in anymore, which anyone but a crab/bot wants to stop 100% safety (short of safe log, obvs)
---
I really hope they remove asset safety next.
---
I‚Äôve had a few friends return
---
The vast majority have unsubbed, even pvpers because ccp is trying to put nebulous hurdles on everything that provided content and growth.
---
To each their own experience, however from a business background i can say all the changes followed by sudden login events and dailies seems to be desperately trying to prove something that is VERY short term.
---
But the sheep in the masses will not put that much thought into it beyond ‚Äúgrr null adapt or die‚Äù which is, as i will always say.  Sad.
---
&gt;Again, you know fuck all, what if that was the only safe place to land the chopper?  When you look at something you're completely unfamiliar with and make assumptions you end up an asshole.
---
lols, that still means something was fucked up.  You must be a giant asshole making so many assumptions then.
---
&gt;Give me any evidence at all to support that choice. My evidence that you're wrong is that they didn't need to buy the company to get at the tech, none of which is remarkable in anyway shape or form. They also didn't just close down eve and harvest the tech involved in it, they've kept the game running and and continued its development, further undermining your point. If you buy a company for its tech, you harvest that and shed the skeleton of the company to keep costs down because you're a for profit business.  
---
&gt;So, do you have any evidence to support your 'they bought it for the tech' position? I bet you dont.
---
Yes they have articles about it you can look up stating specifically they bought it for the tech, including Hilmar stating it himself.  You can look these up easily, have fun.
---
&gt; Making up random shit is not addressing an issue. 
---
Good thing I didnt do that then.
---
All that talk of respect without realizing its a two way street.  Sad.
---
the other 3 are considering what game to play next because their idea of fun was shooting the 4th guy.
---
Theft is taxation!
---
Whining is part of the enjoyment though
---
In case you‚Äôre serious
---
Delve made more because they probably have more people there than all possible wormholes put together times 10. 
---
And Blue loot still beat bounties
---
I only have 4 subbed accounts üôÉ
---
It‚Äôs non stop PvP when I login. Today was cache tomorrow it will be somewhere else. Try joining a group that‚Äôs not surrounded by blues
---
\&gt; Whenever you run a nullsec anomaly it'll instantly respawn...in a random nullsec system,  
---
You mean exactly how it works now? Dont think you thought this through bud.
---
"How to have a 3some without one of the participants feeling left out"? 
---
Ok, no differnt 3-body problem.
---
I've heard similar descriptions similar to what you've described. It warrants a whole other conversation about information available to the client and information available to users. In shooters i know my ram is storing the location of enemies, and loot spawned in the world. If i edit the client to show me this information in real time thats considered hacking and i would be banned. That sounds similar to the steps taken by those pulling apart their clients to get information that the developer does not want available to users.
---
Empty You? I wouldn't have a problem with you guys if you did something actually useful like wardeccing CODE and taking out their citadels in Uedama and Niarja, or clearing out the hundreds of mobile depots the Chinese folks leave in Jita. But so far as I've seen, you folks like to cloak in on people trying to run missions and then when they take the completely logical step of warping out so as not to get ganked by some random murderhobo dropping on their deadspace pocket you take it as consent to "clean up their trash." I had to outfit a spare destroyer for salvage and drag it out 24 jumps to police my mission sites after you clowns pissed in my cheerios. A pleasant weekend excursion turned into a week-long slog because the most inept janitors in the star cluster couldn't understand why someone would leave a perfectly good MTU in space when a T3 ship with unknown intent drops on grid and cloaks up. The salt is warranted.
---
I unsubscribed from these letters many times already but still they send it to me. Gonna start marking them as spam for google mail system.
---
Have some silver
---
I‚Äôll help. It‚Äôs mostly stupid, somewhat sarcastic but trying to appear salty.
---
Can you link your killboard ?
---
While people can meme about all the people not logging on being bots, that only goes so far and at some point just gets silly.  
---
While the current changes are enjoyed by a segment of Eve, they also have significantly pissed off a good segment of the Null PvE players.  Real players who have been involved with Eve....even if it‚Äôs not exactly a gameplay that everyone likes.  
---
More than that though, they have changed the meta from a multi-box heavy one (VNI and Rorquals) to one that you don‚Äôt multibox these.  
---
So guess what...people that have multiple accounts to support undocking 6-8+ Rorquals or VNIs just will not run them.  Even if they stick around, and that really depends if they actually enjoy other activities in Eve and find something to do, it‚Äôs not going to involve undocking 6-8+ Rorquals or VNIs.  
---
This will translate into less people logging on, less people in space and less targets.  The number of real involved Eve players has been hidden by the multibox centric gameplay that is being phased out with the new meta.  
---
The more concerning thing from my point of view is that these people, not being invested in the new meta CCP wants, will just break the habit of actually logging in and giving a shit about Eve.  People, once happy to sub often times dozens of accounts, are just saying screw it and finding something else to do.  Absolutely the wrong people you want to piss off.  Gaming is building the habit of logging every day, undocking, and doing things you actually enjoy.  Break that habit and who knows what you will want to spend time/money on.  Even more so if that one person you piss off brings multiple accounts and undocks large numbers of ships.  
---
Oh well...meme on guys.  Only bots affected by the changes.  No real people....and even if they are real people screw them.  We want quality, not quality.  /sigh.
---
Lucky. I was stupid and resubbed all eight for a year after blackout and trigvasions thinking CCP was finally headed in the right direction.
---
But bro it was MILLIONS OF DOLLARS DESTROYED bro
---
&gt;  For JFs, this was really the only improvement

Your cyno not showing on everyone's overview wasn't an improvement?

Great idea!!!!!!!

the limited comments they made make it sound like they are just going to make it harder to get from place to place using wormholes, not sure how making it harder to go somewhere gets you more kills.
---
especially if they paid to inject into that ship in the first place. That's like having your dealer call the cops and reporting you for buying drugs after he sold them to you in the first place.
---
For carriers it‚Äôs fighters. For dreads it‚Äôs weapons. For titans it‚Äôs the poonday.
---
imagine you're a new player, you break down and pay for plex, buy a few injectors, get yourself up to cruiser skills, die and find yourself locked out of what you just paid cash for... I wonder if CCP would really be dumb enough to pull something that anti-paying customer?
---
WH space place is where advanced and old players live.       
---
We are talking about well suited people with a lot of assets and skill points.          
---
Chaos is about making life of this players harder.       
---
From what we see in MER this is area of uncontrolled isk  faucet in in form of blue loot.

---
Are there any specific features you'd want?
---
It kind of works perfectly, inside it's own little scope.
---
There will be a tipping point soon.  Not sure when it will be, but it will come as people and targets trickle away.  
---
Eve needs some number of involved people who actually are excited about the game and want to undock and do stuff.  Any stuff.  As those people go away, content creators will get tired and go away as well...which will cause less people to undock.  
---
I hope...really hope...that CCP does not make the sandbox so small that it appeals to insufficient numbers to keep space full.
---
Are you actually dumb or do you just not know what you're talking about but you're in too deep to quit?
---
Filthy casual. Why should the game be adapted to suit someone who plays ‚Äúsometimes‚Äù?
---
#It is about number of people in some area and not number of systems.
---
Ha ha ha. More anger!
---
Who gets the guillotine this time?
---
im not a wormholer, im a nullseccer just like you :)
---
Ya, you are also inherently troll like in your posting habits. So, be gone.
---
I wonder if there‚Äôs be any interest in  ‚Äúbring as many people as you can‚Äù frigate/cruiser brawl in NPC null, in priest of the state of the game? I bet it‚Äôd make news.

Well duh, they‚Äôre battleships lol

Fair
---
hilmar will never acknowledge that something that makes them more money is bad, even if it really does kill the game eventually. He'll happily take the money and lament the fall of the game all the way to the last day.
---
what? im in rote kapelle, a small sov holding alliance based in Tribute.
---
Oh wait, i forgot, we don't actually exist cause blackout basically screwed us little guys so we're all in highsec and dotlan/zkb is just fucking with ya
---
What? How high are you rn lol
---
You DO know if there's no content in the chain because you've scanned it out already and not found any. So you roll the chain and start again.
---
The bot doesn't require you to give it any info. Add it to a discord server and role-limit it into your #bot channel.
---
I am not, and CSM see this.
---
those are also the options ccp has btw :D

---
&gt; Im being forced to fight or die. I choose death. I've lived through the greatest moments of this game and im content with those memories. But I will NOT condone you and your like destroying this game and I will not support CCP when this goes live.
---
Haha. You‚Äôre either a great troll or the biggest crybaby pussy ever.
---
\&gt;My economically unsustainable cookie clicker playstyle got nerfed so the game is dying.
---
From the MER it looks like total faucet is just above 50 trillion. So blue loot is about 25% of it. Arguably way too much for the number of people who farm them. Should definitely be nerfed. But please stop talking about the 41%.
---
Maybe they could actually make the game enjoyable.
---
Thank you!
---
Yes, CSM knows how to do math.  
---
Let‚Äôs say there are 2500 people in wormholes total.  (One per system).   They make 150mil per day.  That‚Äôs called math
---
aww, making them sing their national anthem was always just cute. CCP hosted Sandslinger at Fanfest, playing back some of the prizes. 
---
fuck HK for dishonoring ransoms and fucking up the almost perfect e-bushido-land.

281 %

that was years later too. 
---
i still don't understand that one.
---
No more closing WH's forcefully. Remove the safety that is control over WH access. Cause chaos, don't be scared that people might come into your WH and shoot you.
---
If you didn't have a sitter, you just sat in it on your titan pilot. Why people are trying to parallel that with losing it by simply using the mechanics of a keepstar is beyond me.
---
Mine is stored away with the Mystery Code that I never use.
---
No one cared about how much intel the hunters were getting because it got somewhat balanced out by local alerting them to threats. Even with the "perfect" intel of local, there was no shortage of kills, just a shortage of lazy kills. Those that worked for kills, didn't do much complaining.
---
Now with local blocked, you either get lucky on Dscan or you die shortly after the hunter uncloaks beside you.
---
Serious question and honestly curious - How many of those 8 accounts were paid with real $?
---
You ether spread the blackout evenly, or watch as the side that got the short end of the stick... moves their sticks to high/lowsec. 
---
Unless you've got a shit ton of sticks, then it doesn't matter.
---
Thanks !
---
Subbed with IRL $$$. Use to plex them all years ago but when you have a newborn time is less for gaming.
---
The change would remove the current meta of knowing exactly how many jumps a cheap higgs fit sigil or Mega it takes to instantly roll a hole in Null Low High and WH space. Meaning they will need to be actually fought over by fleets trying to defend/attack. 
---
If the mass change goes ahead it will allow for backup to be brought in if Null drops caps from the fleet using said WH and as a balance to this it will also allow for wormhole to be properly attacked making the risk/reward imbalance present in wormhole space ownership to be properly addressed as Wormholers will no have to actually defend their space instead of just docking up and rolling to win any engagement as is the current favourite tactic of WH.
---
Your point about statics is correct though. A possible fix for that would be to have any wormhole with under a certain amount of mass passing through it every X minutes despawns faster. Dont like where it leads to? Dont use it and it despawns. If you or an enemy want to use it, then it has to be activity with it. That will also cut back on the use of WH's as a cap/super transport. You cant bank a wh to use later in the day to move shit through you have to risk doing it now incase it moves on.
---
Lol I have 8 naglfars and will probably move moneymaking into a wormhole soon.
---
RIP automod
---
WHers who don't have targets to shoot just sit here all day and whine. Maybe if we blacked out their access to the subreddit while they were in the WH...
---
There are 5201 k space systems in eve that I'm aware of. If the number of 29T is correct, that means about 180M per system per day! Sounds balanced? That means 95% of the player base makes 180M per system per day and about 5% makes 150M per system per day.
---
But why are we even using systems?
---
Most estimates say about 95% of characters live in K-space and 5% in J-space.
---
29T / 95 = 305B per 1% of characters.
---
12T / 5 = 2.4T or 2400B per 1% of characters.
---
Over 7 times as lucrative, amazing damn balance.
---
it keeps getting worse, I've been playing eve on and off since 2009, and I can't remember ever seeing the US prime time get down to under 20K players before.
---
Ooh. I kept thinking of a different question then. My Bad. 
---
Wow that's stupid btw. x)
---
Oh please do this.
---
yeah. The one he was talking about really is insane...
---
*Falcon is everywhere*  
---
*Falcon sees all*
---
If wormholes have one person per system, they make an average of 150m per day on loot.  That‚Äôs what the math says
---
There  is no 2500 in WH space - but CCP have all stats.      
---
Now lets assume there is this 2500 people in Wh space.     
---
This 2500 people made 12T in blue loot , a the same time rest of New Eden (so nullsec, lowsec AND HIGSEC) did 29T            
---
So how man people this is? ^(rest of New Eden)             
---
25.000?            
---
50.000 scattered across all zones?    
---
More?          
---
Don't want to spoil but this looking even worst for WH space if 2500 people can do 12T
---
It sure sounds better than what i had imagined!
---
The Valkyrie integration we actually needed was the ability to launch a respawning, fun-to-fly, low-sp ship from supercarriers
---
sadly with tidi even a space fighter would be pretty boring to pilot
---
Do you actually know how many people live or farm in WH systems across all time zones?
---
I DEFINITELY take a wait and see approach with tracker record these jokers have.
---
Maybe that's true.
---
Maybe I just enjoy a bit of controversial writing every now and then, have a look and see what'll fall out.  I'll admit, I'm not that great at it!
---
Oh, and people from NS, HS, and LS farm blue loot out if WH‚Äôs all the time.  I would say 1/2 of the blue loot is farmed by people that DONT live in WHs
---
... so what.
---
Shhh... Don't let the bad men know WH space can be significantly more profitable than anywhere else.
---
&gt; drops that need to be transported from a wh to jita
---
You only need to get them to empire. There are hundreds of NPCs all over the place buying them at the same price. There is no risk in doing that if you aren't a total idiot.
---
CCP where is my CYNO?! Insurance fraud all carriers and rorquals :monkaS:
---
I trained Mass Hysteria V on all of my toons!!!
---
It is not about if this is WH people or not.               
---
It is about blue loot itself that it is an issue.           
---
Remove blue loot or nerf it by like 80% and issue is solved.      
---
It is not that Wh space will be worthless - all T3 production is linked with it.
---
genuine question here pls no flame - Is this not what standing defense fleets are for? or an alt cloaked in a falcon or even just a battleship or something?
---
why is this sign not all over the internet
---
I didn't hate it fact is i think ccp needs to change kill/loss to a score card only no intel on fits
---
also i think it would be really good for the game if they remove the full report.
---
i too have heard the local system is just a cover and the information is there so couldn't ccp say
---
1 - cover the ingame info by removing the options to see it  
---
2 - close the esi for out of game
---
Not really speculation. Planning. If I was speculating I'd be buying 40 or so of them. 
---
I wanted to seed both conventional cynos and covert cyno ships along my route since I may not be super active over the next few weeks (back to college), but I was making the run from jita today. Dev blogs were supposed to be a legit source of info, and cyno chain maintenance doesn't do itself.
---
To be honest, if anyone actually want to dedicate their time to farming, they will do just fine. It's just a bit more hostiles, a bit more effort and a bit more lost ships. But that leads us to...
---
Why bother? People PVE either to get money or they can't PVP because of multiple reasons, time/effort being one. The PVE grind/catch up in this game is already brutal and we are making it even more stressful but still as repetitive. If those people can't/don't want to PVP, they ain't gonna PVP. Better watch Netflix until I get to weekend and I can sit in fleets/roam for hours. Then it just comes down to "Oh no I have friends coming on this weekend" "Damn I have to work this weekend too" "the kids are crying and I had to console them" to happen a few times, or when you log in you roam for 3 hours and found nothing/got instantly blown up by a gate camp, to make EVE more of a chore than a joy. 
---
You can't say "lul just move to lowsec" when some people may have a sense of belonging in an alliance, have long time friends there or is simply too fond of their playstyle. Especially when "lowsec is dead" was such a meme for a long time. People ain't leaving nullsec or highsec en master and if they do, they will probably going to leave the game altogether.
---
I think there's an argument that the "currently active in space" stat is too strong. Being able to tell where people are out shooting stuff right now is a lot of intel. Hourly history and the ability to see active areas in general doesn't seem unreasonable though.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law
---
You really have zero concept of math
---
I wish I could find some fucking enjoyment. Please. I. Want. To. Really. Bad.
---
And many are overlooking the increased PVP opportunities for ALL players this can bring.
---
PvP fights over holes would be required to ensure the defence of you space instead of just throwing a already known amount of higgs fit industrials or Megas at a Hole. It allows for more backup to be called from the wormhole if the target escalates. It introduces a risk to WH space that has been seriously lacking for a while now (Especially since the Blackout).
---
but he's not the only one
---
Wat a fucking garbage player
---
&gt; from the first half of 2019:
---
How dare you!
---
Go mine Veldspar in a Kestrel as a punishment!
---
Removing the total mass limit from any wormhole is a tremendously bad idea, it just means that a K space blob will invade and drop 300 nerds on the locals and evict them. Limited mass, changing connections are what makes wormhole space what it is.
---
&gt; the removal of any K162 spawn time delay.
---
&gt; Crit Jspace static holes should be able to close at any time, when critical, at random!
---
If they want to take away highly safe ratting, particularly with blingy stuff in high class holes (which is where the isk is ridiculous), that would certainly do it.
---
Afk ratting while watching Netflix I barely consider ‚Äúplaying eve‚Äù
---
Trash alliance get dunk by npc lmao
---
What is an NPC doing at a moon?
---
They need to rework the career agents a bit, and teaching people during the NPE to use autopilot and not teaching them how to use DScan is an issue
---
omg the original avatars were the best. The Gallente and all their plastic shit.
---
Got mine
---
Wormhole PVE require an active fleet most of the time, or if they are not you need high skill characters. Not everyone had that.
---
Then living in WH in general means you have to actively manipulate your space. Rolling holes, shipping supplies, fighting off attackers, that sort of stuff. Unlike in kspace you will be in a much more tight knit group and you have to work your part; while in null it just comes down to "do your PAP".
---
Whether null is supposed to be dangerous I don't know and I don't care. What matters is that whether it *should* be dangerous in what form. That's a whole different question.
---
What you are in actuality saying is no more rage rolling which means actually lowering the danger to the krab and taking away content to those who search for it. This seems to be the point people don‚Äôt understand. Nullseccers love to get mad when people don‚Äôt understand their gripes yet for some reason everybody is a WH space expert. Why? Because ur buddy has a krab hole that hasn‚Äôt been evicted yet?
---
Well, it may be, but CCP is one the line of breaking consistencies;) So, maybe.
---
After I heard the newest CCP interview though, it might also be, that a dedicated capital hunter weapon mechanic might be come within another precursor race.
---
Well, we will see. For now, we can just guess and hope
---
I give this guy two days until he gets his invincible destroyer blown out of the sky and does a giant arrogant rage rant in local.
---
Ikr, written panic attacks like this one tend to hinder constructive discussion.
---
because this is the edited version there is one like the one in eve  tough  where it warn's in small letter's at the bottem that the bridge is out, and it was suposingly been captured in canada go figure .
---
u/uwutranslator
---
Dude don‚Äôt bother. These points have been brought up over and over on Reddit and the various discord‚Äôs yet the Nullsec WH experts seem to love playing ignorance.
---
Haha sure anything for you my toxic friend :)
---
Like of all the changes that CCP could come out with, that would probably have the whole community saying that it‚Äôs shit
---
adapt
---
Still have my 2 copies. Never thought I'd play a game for 16 years...
---
Everyone knows this and knew it.
---
They just pretend not to because hell if something worked for you, wouldn‚Äôt you abuse he fuck out of and defend it too?
---
You see mass bombers and cloaked t3s because theyre fucking strong and almost impossible to catch
---
Nobody uses ships because they are ‚Äútoo weak to be used‚Äù. 
---
Everyone knows that null is dangerous, they just don‚Äôt like that they can ‚Äúlose‚Äù to someone more prepared.
---
I don‚Äôt need to, I make trillions in wormholes
---
&gt;We don't have a problem getting new players into the game. 12k-20k people each week login for the first time. 7 days later 90% are gone. Day 180 is when you are considered to be an eve player.  
---
Because being a new player isn't fun - at all - when placed on the Nullsec fast track. I see this shit happen all the time, people poached out of recruitment by some D-tier nullsec corp recruiting anyone with a pulse to get as much tax money as possible. They tell you, "move out here to our HQ as fast as possible so you can start having fun!". You move out there, and have no clue what's going on. Then they say, "well you've gotta start training for our doctrine ships (usually some dogshit tier hurricane doctrine), then you'll start having fun!". You train into some fucking horrid BC doctrine some mongo cooked up right after huffing some paint thinner at his desk in Eastern Europe and get roasted over and over by some ultra virgins flying some fun as fuck insane Phantasm doctrine or something. Then they say, "well you've gotta get an alt, and put it in a VNI so you can have some ISK, then you'll start having fun!". So you get your second sub going, get into your VNI, and realize it's going to take you like 40 hours of legit grinding to even break even on your new subscription. Then they say, "well you're not having fun because you can't fly the big toys!". So you train into a FAX and a Thanatos and sit in home defense fleet 25/8 desperately hoping someone gets tackled so you can jump - and when the moment finally comes by the time you load grid a sensor boosted HAW titan just killed the single Slicer tackling a procurer in some random belt and you get to gate home with no killmails.  
---
I understand that some people might like this shit. They might like playing that game. But at some point we have to be honest with ourselves and admit the obvious - that shit is just so unfun its not surprising at all that new players just say "fuck that lol" and move on to games like League of Legends. The majority of them probably never even bother to try solo/small gang PvP and experience the adrenaline filled side of EvE, arguably the only thing that sets it apart from every other shitfest grind focused MMO.
---
No heat on reactive. Bro were you just toying with him?
---
You can build them in any wormhole I believe. All you need is the correct structure to construct caps. Cam only have fax's, dreads, carriers and rorqs in wh's though no supers or titans
---
Nah. I wanna be able to identify (and play) as a drifter.
---
So the portal app (the Android one that's been needing new life for years) is getting updated? 
---
This is actually great news.
---
Totally agree. This would be a true blackout.
---
When i was a newbie skill injectors didn`t exist,and free SP also :D
---
Anyway i was supporting injectors change so new players could rise faster.However in this case CCP is trying to make old players login because they are against last changes CCP made and no one asked for :D
---
How is that even possible unless he's afk. 
---
And who the fuck goes afk in a super?
---
Yeah, well, there's no sitter bottleneck there either now, is there? Oh, hai skill injectors...
---
I'll need multiple sources and an actual research paper to back up your claims :)
---
Why are you spending time and/or money on a form of non-mandatory entertainment that you don't enjoy?
---
this evening stats :
---
7 log in the first one, i just kill one fucking cyno ibis, prospect mining warped when he sees me landing
---
Second system : 7 login,  nothing on Dscan
---
I log off and go do something else :D
---
When i logged we were 24k for a friday evening...
---
true stat.
---
&gt;Interesting, a lot of my friends
---
X ^(doubt)
---
&gt;returned to the game in large numbers
---
&gt;and are loving life right now.
---
This bit may actually be true
---
spoken like a true bellend.
---
Why whenever ratting is mentioned do people assume it's AFK?
---
As a new player, I never made it out to null, and I'm pretty happy about it in retrospect. I posted what I was looking for here, and a lowsec small-gang PvP corp messaged me and got me onboard. Now I'm at almost 150b destroyed in 2 months and I've only lost 1.3b in ships. It's been awesome learning from a small group of dedicated players and they know enough people that I got to a part of a titan bridge for the first time the other day, so we still get some cool action.
---
&gt; You can build them in any wormhole I believe. All you need is the correct structure to construct caps.
---
Well, you need to get the structure in, which is probably not possible in frig holes.
---
My characters are in the north or in the east, far from the imperium. I didnt see a blue.
---
30 min to find a fight, WTF, are you happy with it? It s so many time for so few fight.
---
.
---
So some of this is kind of worrying. IMO, any change that forces players to put more chips on the table in a fight without those chips offering an immediate benefit for the fight itself is just going to discourage PVP. That's the sad truth, but it is the truth. If people keep to the old mantra of "don't fly what you can't afford to lose," and they can now afford to lose fewer fights, then they're not going to risk flying as often as before.  
---
Pirate ships, deadspace modules, high end ammo, and combat implants can all offer a direct benefit in combat over their cheaper counterparts. So when players risk more of the high end stuff, they are also being rewarded with better performance. On the other hand, stuff like a full +5 learning implant set might as well be a box of plex in cargo, for all the good that's going to do you once the shooting starts. Forcing players to take more of *that* kind of risk which doesn't reward them with anything is the wrong way to go about making PVP more meaningful.  
---
If that wasn't bad enough, I predict CCP's line of thinking on risk is going to lead to unintended negative consequences as well. Trust is a very valuable commodity in the real world, but real world organizations also have mechanisms to deter and punish breaking trust that simply don't exist in EVE. If someone scams you successfully, you can at least still try to pursue and recover the stolen goods. You can try to track scammers down and get them locked away for a long time, so that they can't keep trying to scam you over and again immediately. You can also be pretty sure no less than 8 spies aren't all secretly the same person working against you behind your back, and so on. But scamming is rampant in EVE because the consequences for both failing a scam and getting caught after the fact are often pretty much nil. Stolen wealth stashed away in station or in wallets is untouchable. People can't be denied the means to just roll up a fresh alt to try and infiltrate your corp again right away. You can't even put a real life face to a toon most of the time, and so on. In light of this, EVE *needs* robust mechanisms for organizers to preemptively identify bad actors. If ESI digital fingerprinting gets scaled back, the consequence isn't just more chaos and conflict, but also less social interaction and cooperation in general once players adjust their behavior to the new risk vs reward scenario. You can always trust your own alts more than other players, so if you can't take reasonable measures to ensure other players are at least mostly trustworthy, then it makes sense to just not trust anyone *at all* whenever you can help it, and do as much as you can yourself. Given that EVE is a social game that thrives on player organizations and interactions, that again isn't a healthy outcome in my opinion.
---
&gt;who the fuck goes afk in a super?
---
Spotted the guy who has never flown a super...
---
It isn't that expensive right ? and the skills are not wasted because they are used in other ships.   
---
Its also not like the ship is completely useless now, just slightly worse at one thing but slightly better at another.
---
fuck yourself, delete yourself, and most of all be a man of your word. You cant even keep your account deleted. Its no wonder all your prior members talk shit about you. Me trying for a decade? Yeah, and succeeded. I have member retention, loyalty, and friends, with a much better fun, and win loss ratio than you. So, go back to being the piece of shit you are. Low class wormhole scrub? Yeah, keep your pea brain small dick antics in thera. ..|.
---
If you make an operating cost for titans I'm out. I already pay to play your shit game. Not fucking paying more to use a specific ship.
---
I agree with most if not all you are saying; conditions shouldn‚Äôt have gotten to a place where major changes are made to correct a problem they let fester for so long.  
---
I myself just came back after 2 years.  Right before my break I skilled a Nid toon and paid some real money to build cyno alts.  Granted I am no longer in a null alliance after a 2 year break but knowing I sunk SP (and $) into something now less valuable (actually useless atm) bothers me.  Spending even the minimal amount of $ I spent on cyno alts that are now useless sucks. Neither of those situations remotely compares to the setups a lot of folks have put together that became less valuable.  Those who spent $ are likely more bitter than those who paid with ISK.  I would be pissed too.
---
I don‚Äôt necessarily agree how they are going about things but there are too many high reward/low risk (sometimes low effort) ways to make ISK.  At the very least they should probably give SP to those who trained into the most impacted skills.  Even that won‚Äôt satisfy most, but it‚Äôd be something.
---
I think this could certainly help the afk/bot mining issue in HS.
---
Wanting to come pvp with you guys is what EVE is about. Dunno what you are on about.
---
&gt; you either get lucky on Dscan
---
There is no luck, there is skill.
---
Who the fuck wants SP loss on death back? There are already more than enough barriers for PVP, we dont need more.
---
Packs of cloakys will shred battleships/any subcap ratters. A standing fleet genuinely won't get on grid fast enough to save you.
---
Your alt cloaked will be their second kill. Unless you have numbers on grid, you'll die too quickly.
---
Given we are up +200 characters from blackout / etc and the vast majority of them are old hands returning the numbers speak for themselves.
---
The current wh meta is to keep rolling holes until you find pvp content. In other words, take a slot machine where you can just keep pulling the lever over and over again and make it so you can only pull the lever once per day.
---
What I think should happen is just cutting the bloat. EVE is complex and all, but most of the time we aren't even doing content. If we do a 2 hour fleet, then it's guaranteed that 80% of that is spent travelling. Between that and looking for content, it would easily fill our entire EVE section. You can play like 6 hours straight in fleets and not fire a single shot, and it only takes like two missed tackle to do that. That has to be rectified, but admittedly I don't know how.
---
Obviously, faster pace and more interesting PVE like abyssals are in general good, but the PVP side of things also need to get faster and easier to get started.
---
It's also nice when you're part of a small group and you get to see your contributions be appreciated. I won't sit here and act like I'm the most productive player ever but even the small stuff - when you make a clutch play or go through an insane fight even if you're losing, it really makes you happy to be a part of that small community.

In most, if not all nullsec alliances you get essentially none of that. The harder you push to be good at the game, even at a corporate level, the more you're dragged down by retards that literally want to krab 24/7 and have no intention of ever interacting with anyone in the game in a fun and meaningful way. It's insane to think that there are contingents in the game that would legitimately turn off access to the system they krab in if they could so they could fucking shoot red shapes in space 18-20 hours a day without interruption.
---
I get the idea that in Hellmar's vision he sees a world that is changing based on procedural generation, where different resources are in different areas and you have to move around and interact with others to be successful. He also says a few times that he does not like giving players any mechanisms to have more trust between each other, as trust is the only way you can have betrayal and have eve control itself. No alliance can be too large because more players need to be trusted and thus someone will run with the goods. It seems like this is the cycle Hellmar wants from the game. In his eyes, if you had perfect anti-trust mechanisms and no spies, what's the point? You just get a big "purple donut" as Hellmar calls it.
---
Sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm the only EVE player who actually gets EVE and never fails to find fun.
---
Or maybe it‚Äôs reddit. Buncha spergy millennial snowflakes. Oh I‚Äôm sorry was that ableist?
---
&gt; You must be a giant asshole making so many assumptions then.
---
Says the guy that assumed the copter was in the wrong spot because it was in a tree.
---
Something fucked up, it doesn't mean the chopper isn't exactly where it belonged.
---
&gt;Yes they have articles about it you can look up stating specifically they bought it for the tech, including Hilmar stating it himself. You can look these up easily, have fun.
---
Ok link one, do anything to support any statement you've made today besides being a faggot that says 'look it up'.
---
&gt;All that talk of respect without realizing its a two way street. Sad
---
Says the guy that came in and put a stupid idea in print then started screaming that people who didnt like his idea were scared of change.
---
What a piece of human garbage you are.
---
Umm while I do agree with your. Your accounting lingo is a bit off. 
---
Because if I remember right (work in retail accounting.) a subscription would is only able to count as a revenue till the start of the month depending what accounting method they are using. If you buy three month sub only one month of that sub is considered a revenue, and the other amounts go into what ever you want to name it but a liability account
---
Cash based system
---
Cash         15
---
Revenue. -15
---
Accrual which is what they most likely use
---
Cash 15
---
Sub revenue -5 
---
Deferred revenue -10
---
There is a whole other half to this that I am blanking on.
---
So when you buy the plex at a higher price they receive the money up front but they do not get the consist t income on the books.
---
How can you scan something that's removed? Scanning anoms I'd support though.
---
He‚Äôs a troll and a shit one at that. Classic dumbshit stainguy
---
Yeah sure you want to PVP, hence your membership in a blob.
---
static holes with infinite mass making them impossible to roll.
---
You assume all 2500 systems are populated and farmed...
---
I don't know a single wormhole based player that isn't space rich.
---
that will work cos people don't whine about destroying structures already.
---
Soon (tm)
---
Honestly tho, if we are ever gonna get them it could be somewhat soon
---
It feels strange when you jump into low sec and suddenly see people in local. I know what you mean...
---
You mean till you deliver it to an infinite npc buy order...
---
ok send me some
---
Pretty much the way I run my accounts.  I have said a long time ago that i am an adult with a good job.  Why the hell would I slave away to PLEX an account doing tedious activities.  
---
I had 7 accounts that I payed real money for because, god help me, I enjoyed Rorqual mining, had money to game and enjoyed having supers/Titans for PvP.  That game play is over pretty much, so I unsubscribed then.  Not to be pissy, but for the simple reason that the accounts are of zero use to me now.
---
Freight cyno might have the same SP requirement.
---
This. I take a couple 3 week vacations a year.
---
That tells you how few people are in them compared to the VAST payout.
---
It‚Äôs split fewer ways, meaning less people make far more. Take all of nullsec and divide by the 10s of thousands there and compare it per player payout
---
Wormholes pay far far more per person, and these facts are becoming more apparent
---
Because it's boring as shit. That's why I don't do it.
---
 Or by increasing the amount of isk required to retrieve the items. (Potentially giving a chunk of that isk to the entity that dealt the most damage to the structure killed) 
---
Increasing the isk yes as it removes it from the game.  local move 25% nearest low sec 65%
---
no to giving it to the attackers
---
So.. that isn't pvp?
---
The only one triggered here is you, and nullbears like you.
---
masochism
---
Nullbears blow up and throw a tantrum, more news at 11.
---
Congrats, went through the same thing twice (damn newborns).  I think you are probably in the minority of those paying for all of their accounts with $.  
---
Regardless of how anyone paid, spending time and resources building anything that gets whacked a bunch of times with a nerf bat is a bad deal.  This time it‚Äôs a pretty big bat they‚Äôve been swinging.
---
Lies lies lies what a fucking joke. 
---
Not hard to have better member retention when you‚Äôre still at the same 10 people you were at 10 years ago, never got better, never tried to improve, never even tried to be something better.
---
Be proud of your garbage shit tier Corp I guess.
---
Wait
---
Lots of us pve in chains.  Maybe not in C5s, but c3 and c4 holes are highly populated and dont provide enough isk in the home hole alone.
---
Origin of this comic panel?
---
How do you get the right number code for a certain ship?
---
Maybe.. my titan toon has enough spare SP right know to extract enough to make an entirely new dread pilot on the same account to perfect skills.
---
Who could have foreseen this easily predictable occurrence?
---
I missed the million SP by a day because I was in a field audit. 
---
I feel ya
---
You open a great steak restaurant where you‚Äôre customers love to come and get their carnivore on, but then you decide to listen to the bleats of vegan pansies who walk in and out without staying, and shift you‚Äôre focus to providing all-you-can eat tofu options.   Your quality of steak suffers as a result, and the carnivores stop coming to your restaurant.
---
What did you do wrong?
---
Who pays NS bounties ???
---
It‚Äôs free, no money necessary.
---
I mean, is that how it works in your world? If you say something, it must be true? Ha ha
---
its in the top comment
---
Enjoy high sec
---
Or only show up in local after uncloaking on the gate vOv
---
Most of the blue loot is probably being farmed by people that don‚Äôt even live in WHs (day trippers)
---
Well last time I ratted was in a carrier, so maybe I'm just used to actually having to pay attention. 
---
Never ratted AFK even in a VNI. I don't like feeding kills.
---
That‚Äôs speculative and akin to saying most bounties are earned by short term renters or incursions in ns 
---
It holds no basis.
---
I know it‚Äôs your playstyle, but you gotta see the writing on the wall... all the changes you wanted will come round circle to ya
---
Yeah that's a problem with you bud the hitbox is fine.
---
You're right I haven't. 
---
But I've never AFK'd my carrier. I cannot imagine I'd afk a ship 10x the price.
---
This bullshit really needs to die. How many ships have you ever tackled on a day one toon. Now how many brand new people playing the game for the first time have tackled and been a significant contribution to a small roaming gang on day one.
---
The answer is nobody. Because hunting and catching a guy actually requires a bit of experience.
---
A new player in eve is as useful as a day one player in wow in all practicality.
---
Probably their primary method of keeping index's up at the moment.
---
I mean we have the highest potential isk/hr, so we want to fight each other(at least some of us) as often as possible because we can afford it.
---
.....I googled it. Regret was had
---
Thermal compensater
---
Apologies, I should clarify. It takes me approximately that long for me to find a fight I am willing to engage in. Otherwise I can hurl myself into engagement in a, usually, quicker amount of time.
---
Please don‚Äôt assume I do PVE, I don‚Äôt.  
---
I am a math genius and a PVPer
---
&gt;imagine if they dial the swing up to 50%
---
Too high. That would 100% force you to roll in megas which increases rolling time, tanks finding content, and replaces it with only rolling mega losses.
---
I've extorted 45b from random people in PHorde over the last few weeks. No real reason, feels nice.
---
And yet no donations to poor MechaJeb Kerman's Thrasher fund :(
---
I think we should be able to upgrade wh‚Äôs so they infinitely spawn endless sites over and over and over.
---
That way we can cram 1000‚Äôs of people in each wh and it will be safe and we will all be happy.
---
16k online with 2-3k in Jita, 2-3k sitting in capitals in the various stagings. So... 10k might be real players out in space?
---
100% bring on the wrecking machine !  We adapt.
---
Oh no it's retarded.
---
Now I just need a JF for assembled ships
---
I never suggested living in a wormhole and would not suggest doing so for anyone who isn't willing to put in a significant amount of effort.
---
Hotkeys are bindable for selecting range. Its super nice
---
I remember when they said skill injectors where coming and player where on 2 sides  
---
side of ccp it is fine it won't be abused we can already buy skill via buy chars  
---
side against ccp this will creat issues players will be able to insta skill for xyz 
---
look what side was right,  ccp really have zero clue on it players even after so many years of running the game.
---
Seeing who can bring one more guy to press ctrl F1 isn't PvP. 
---
It's a fucking *chore*
---
:doubt:
---
Sorry you don't have friends. Boo hoo.
---
Most wormhole corps roll holes to avoid content.  I know there are plenty that do look for content but I‚Äôve had too many doors shut in my face by a pair of rolling mega‚Äôs
---
nice
---
Have you seriously never heard of solo or small gang pvp
---
But hey, he's got KSP2 to look forward to, so theres that.
---
Love have everyone falls for the salt
---
How do you report people to CCP that approach you about RMT outside of EVE, like through discord? I know one of their in game characters. Basically I posted an add to sell a bunch of stuff and they offered real life money in a personal message. I have screen shots.
---
What would you know about the game? You hide in your ivory towers in Wormhole space. You know nothing of the real battles, the grand battles of old that made this game famous. You were not part of that. You have no legacy. We do not need expensive ships nor a small ‚Äú leet‚Äù membership to succeed. Instead we have legions if T1 smooth brains that could crush your pathetic space with a single snap of the finger. Beware heathen scum. A single thought turned to action could send a single ping that could end you and your cohorts!
---
much appreciated
---
All these changes sound like great ways to make people not undock. I had to read this twice. Permadeath? Locked out of ships? SP loss?
---
Wow people are gonna want to engage way more with those cool changes. Definitely gonna see more eager soloists, too. Nothing's more fun than getting blobbed, losing SP and getting locked out of your ship! /s
---
How about they make modules worth more instead. SP, modules and ships are all isk anyways. If they want people to blow eachother up they should make fitted shit worth more as a motivator. Not add retarded losses that the enemy doesn't even reap a reward from. 
---
Seriously what the fuck are they on crack these are the worst ideas I've ever heard and I've browsed features and ideas on the eve forums...
---
Yeeeah  
---
Search for the source at your own risk, friends
---
Some weird guy sent all of our spy alts in Horde 100m. O.o
---
+ Resource Wars. Would be fun if it was worth something
---
They targeted C4 corps and miners.
---
C4 corps and miners.
---
We're   a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end   performing some of the hardest, most mentally demanding tasks. Over, and   over, and over all for nothing more than a little digital token in the  ledger saying  we did. Mining
---
We'll punish our selfs doing things others would consider torture, because we think it's fun. Mining
---
We'll   spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats of a   fictional spaceship all to draw out a single extra point of ore per   yield. Mining
---
Many of us have made   careers out of doing just these things: slogging through the grind,  all  day, the same belts over and over, hundreds of times to the point  where  we know every little rock detail such that some have attained  such miner nirvana that they can literally mine these belts blindfolded.
---
Do   these people have any idea how many evil wormholers have been smashed,   mining systems depleted, structures grinded for safety? All to  latter  be referred to as bragging rights in TiS discord?
---
These   wormholers honestly think this is a battle they can win? They think  they can control the narrative? We're already building a new one without  them. They take our  devs and turn them into hateful wormholers  spreading chaos? Miners aren't shy about throwing their isk else where.  They think calling us retarded, autistic,  npcs is going to change us?  We've been called worse things  by prepubescent 10 year olds with a  shitty hs corp. They picked a fight  against a group that's already  grown desensitized to their strategies  and methods. Who enjoy the  battle of attrition they've threatened us  with. Who take it as a  challange when they tell us we no longer matter.  Our obsession with  mining after being told we can't mine so much is so deeply  ingrained  from years of dealing with the evil ncpl laughing at how pathetic we  used to be that proving you people wrong has  become a very real need; a  honed reflex. now where is ncpl? in wormholes with their alts since  they cant stand to the honorable alliance of coalitions.
---
Miners  are elite and competative, hard core, by nature. We love a challange.  The worst  thing you did in all of this was to challange us. You're not  special,  you're not original, you're not the first; your structures are  just another rock. we will outlast you elite pvpers
---
MINERS RISE UP
---
by  supporting WORMHOLERS, you are LITERALLY supporting the deaths of   every single GROUP minority not just in NULLSEC, but in C4 WORMHOLES,  LOWSEC AND HIGHSEC as well. every single little guy that dies is the  FAULT OF WORMHOLERS. then you  go fucking thing "ahahaha miner owned!  get a permit!! gf epic win!" shut the fuck up. this  is fucking serious.  a REAL elite PVPer would realize he has to stand up  for his fellow  miners by virtue signaling. wormholers are nazis flying elite unkillable  nano bullshit cloaky gay ships that oppress miners and kill them  without mercy.  all WORMHOLES are run by the TRIUMVIRATE OF HATE   tyrants hK, BOLTA and HAWKS  who put drifters  in concentration  "farmhole" camps, use their wormholes to spread death and terror upon  innocent miners, building a wall of DEATH using ships that were built by  MINERS, and  killing any hope for peaceful wormholers. The only hope  for wormholes rest in C4 space, that has aligned itself with the good  guys of eve ( The imperium and legacy ) but their efforts are in vain  due to the other class wormholers oppressing c4 space. and its all  because you stupid  C5 apologists fucking incels gobbled up his lies and  cucked yourselves just to laugh  at innocent miners dying. all across  the new eden star cluster miners are dying on mass, and you sit in your  basement laughing.  "b-b- the miner resisted!"  But miners and C4  honorable wormholers of peace have had enough....the miners WILL rise to  fight the wh nazis in C2 and C5 space, C4 groups everywhere tweet the  narrative of freedom from the hk, hawks and volta oppressors of hate,  corps from of all ns and c4 space stand  together to break their evil  sphere of hate and resist, it is over. brisc has the  evidence. it may  not be now, it may not be soon, it may even be  posthumous. but hK and  hawks will go down. and once your precious tiny  dicked tiny handed  sphere of hate volta loving c5 wormhole is seeded by 2000 honorable  ravens you cockholsters are done for, we will go after the  c2&lt;ns/c5,  c5s, thera, and the mentally ill who  kill miners. their attempts to  undermine our peaceful alliance will not be  left unpunished, and we  will deal with them in time. and the other evil wormholer corps  too,   too. ALL THE DEAD MINERS ARE YOUR FAULT FOR NOT DOING ANYTHING,  fuck  you.
---
Oh yeah forgot about those
---
I accept raw isk or batches of Republic Fleet Firetails, whatever you feel like giving away. Same in game name.
---
TIA
---
The security report that said they banned a group who were still active hours after the report came out?
---
I'm not sure if I wanna compliment you on the baller warp out, or be annoyed that you warped out and the rest of the action is missing :P
---
Ok
---
It was over a year ago.
---
https://imperium.news/shall-we-play-a-game-emergent-ai-results-all-in-npc-fight/
---
To late.
---
Surprisingly it opened......kinda surprised my work network didn‚Äôt block it
---
Meh stop flexing
---
I think they've mentioned planning that
---
They should buff all supers, this would increase capital game play.
---
and most things he talked about in the TIS interview he had touched on in interviews over a year ago.
---
&gt; But killing of entire regions of space just to add "chaos" seems counter productive...
---
As a player who lives in nullsec myself, why don't you fucking tell me about your woes with them killing entire regions of space to add "chaos". Sucks when they hit your playstyle instead of someone else's, doesn't it?
---
Get rekt
---
&gt; blob will invade
---
But you could also counter-blob. Also nullsec alliances wouldn't evict you. They would just destroy all your stuff. You can just build it up again once the hole to them is closed.
---
Well done, 100m is a tone of isk to a new bro.
---
IIRC they were introduced in RMR, which is like 2005?
---
Heth's fucking commie excuse of a government wasting my money as usual. 
---
We could have *steamrolled* the frogs and liberated Caldari Prime a hundred times over by now.
---
For the bathroom, in stations.
---
Lol, unexpectedly works
---
Pray tell which regions of null have been killed off due to no local? And how exactly has the PvP content been stopped because of it?
---
They are rapidly approaching the bonus money from metrics date. That is reason for all of these login rewards and the stupid killing for XP event.
---
depends on your country, check verified seller's on eve's website. If in the US for example the cheapest might be CCP's website. AUS would be amazon.
---
You could also wait for a promotion on galaxy packs and such but no idea when it happens
---
It's pretty great. Moon mining, good DED sites, people to talk to, same stuff in lowsec. All the hunters are too busy trying to be "elite" and afk camp peoples ice and ore anoms in null to bother us.
---
explains a lot, tbh
---
Haha yehhh
---
It would be interesting to see down votes cast compared to upvoted.
---
While I agree with your post the fact it has so few in the three hour mark is a testament to how little traction the subreddit has in the player base.  And the fact its Friday too may have a large bearing.
---
Suffice to say EvE had a great origin - Everyone vs Everyone and has 15 years of human stories to glue people together for a lifetime.
---
They just don't have to or need to play the product that CCP are producing if they don't want to.
---
One of the best changes CCP ever made was to remove the SP loss from clones. It meant older players could actually feel ok about hopping into a rifter without worrying about having to "update" their 30mil clone. The result was people were much more willing to use high sp clones to fly "shitty" t1 ships and have more fun as a consequence. The meta opened up dramatically when they fixed this and helped to really bridge the gap where older players simply refused to fly t1 fun doctrines, because it simply wasn't worth it to lose a 3mil talwar and your 30mil + clone. And for those of us who lost high SP skills like JDC5 or FC5, usually because we were having so much fun that we forgot about updating our clone and instantly reshipped only to die again, you got pretty bitter as you spent the next month or so regaining the SP you lost due to flying in a rifter/incursus.
---
People didn't quit the game or stop playing back when medical clones were a thing, but they also had alot less fun. It was a legitimately awful mechanic, nobody enjoyed it and CCP needs to understand that this would be a very negative change.
---
if it's just a cyno, reassign attributes, get +3 implants for the right stats. Or buy an injector if you have too much isk and not enough time, that's what they're for.
---
search for the ship on zkill and look at the url bar : ship/rightnumbercode
---
Engineering Rigs - Auxilliary Thermal Vents
---
Works on all modules, no need to limit it to a certain type. It's underpowered compared to other choices.
---
BS 100% BS on the skill injectors,  It took years to train those chars now you can do it in minutes  
---
The fact that is so easy to build it, yes adding 'Excavator' Mining Drones was a massive mistake, should have just had t2 drones my fix stop the bpc drops and let the 'Excavator' Mining Drones die out over time
---
you can dock it, i was happy to have a pilot for my super/titan still do
---
it wont die (faxes) is the real problem, logistic is an issue with a lot of pvp i'd like to see titans get a siege module where they can't be remote repaired and there current dps bonus is linked to the module so you really have to fit it to do damage.  repair modules all of them should need nanite and Remote Capacitor Transmitters need cap boosters no more free repairs or capacitor
---
Stainguy might be wrong most of the time, but that doesn't mean he's wrong all the time. This is one of those times. Also enjoy WHs you can't roll in the future.
---
don't give them the pet idea... buy the multivessel contract for 501plex to fly your ship x2..
---
Or just do what CCP wants and max skill for all racial hills and ship types and win Eve.
---
Send lots of isk to people
---
Do RMT
---
Get caught
---
Watch the fireworks
---
It will fall over, lets just hope it isn't the game.
---
How stupid are you?
---
I absolutely do not disagree with you.  The economy of New Eden was being messed up by Rorqual yield and ratting.  
---
The thing that bothers me though, is that you could easily decrease the ore volumes by just blackout.  Much less intrusive and ham handed moves that fixes a lot of what was still wrong.  
---
With regard to Rorquals, the blackout was actually a nice move that made the risk of using excavators much too high, but not absolutely turning off the gameplay of multibox Rorquals that many people enjoy.  Lots of accounts.  Lots of ships undocked.  And lots of engaged people logged on to Eve and playing.  Lots of people with the habit to want to mine with multibox Rorquals, even for a fraction of the payoff.  
---
After the excavators were gone, a good number of people would still undock, because they are set up for it and enjoy the game play, but the harm to the economy would be significantly mitigated.  Maybe those people would shift things around and mix barges in.  Maybe some people would feed excavators like noobs.  In the end you changed the meta to a less harmful one, but did not destroy it.  You gave people ‚Äòan out‚Äô with similar but different gameplay.  They still log and undock.  
---
When you add to blackout the attack on the ‚Äòcapital umbrella‚Äô which has been a core underpinning of undocking nice things in Null for a long time, you make it actually stupid to undock Rorquals, not just less profitable or more risky.  Sure some people will, but with out any real reward, and astronomically higher risk, you pretty much will turn off the gameplay (multibox Rorqual or super ratting) to most people.  
---
Change one or the other and people will still play and take the risk.  Change both, and you shut down that entire part of the sandbox.  
---
You scan shear a sheep (or multiboxer) many times, but you can kill them only once.  The idea is to give them some reason to play their game, and not just kill the entire style of play.
---
You know you are contributing to the whiny bitch number right? :P
---
No thanks we're British.
---
I've heard of it. Done it. Now i want to introduce more Raven fleets to wormholers.
---
Harsh.
---
What is "little" in your opinion?
---
&gt;This subreddit has never represented the player base at large.
---
And this is true for every fanbase of anything on Reddit. It's a meme, but the vocal minority really does make a lot of noise, yet has the lowest impact on reality. 
---
Remember when CCP said "We don't respond to what players say, we respond to what they do"? That's probably called The Reddit Policy.
---
I remember the event 3k dps event rats, good day to sleep in
---
"Look at me doing charity"
---
It moves 5% resist from each 2 least taken damage type to 2 most taken damage type.
---
so for example if you‚Äôre facing kin/therm blaster damage,
---
RAH loses 5% em/ex resist and gain 5% therm/kin resist per cycle.
---
Glad you found for forever home bb. Enjoy
---
Something something, tiercide, something something.
---
It blows my goddamn mind that a MCT costs more than a full month of Omega on an alternate account.  I guess the philosophy is you invest in a MCT in order to train up an alt character that can then be used whenever you want once they‚Äôre trained to your liking for no additional monthly upkeep.  I feel like multiboxing is actually one of the biggest turn offs about this game to newer/more casual players and is right up there with botting and supercap/citadel proliferation in terms of big problems when it comes to people breaking into the game. The fact that it sometimes feels like you need to have at least one wholly alternate account that costs another 15$ a month to maintain in order to truly be effective feels weird to me. And don‚Äôt go telling me you can easily plex it, you average noob isn‚Äôt going to be paying for omega with isk for a bit, much less your average player who plays more casually. 
---
The same goes for people that multibox to the extreme and form one man mining fleets or one man PvE or even PVP fleets. It‚Äôs definitely an interesting play style, but it pushes newer players away from that content since there‚Äôs no reason to bring a suboptimal character who‚Äôs less skilled and flying a less blingy ship when you can do combat sites, trig invasions, and cleaning out entire belts all by yourself because if the newbie fucks up, your down the precious isk you‚Äôre using to pay for all your plex. 
---
But I mean, I kinda doubt we‚Äôll see anything come from it. It seems a fair number of people pay for their multi boxing with cold hard cash, and at the end of the day that‚Äôs what keeps the servers running.
---
Plot twist: They will only be fittable to force recons and Blops, just as normal Cynogens, but will have like 10% reduced CPU and liquid ozone requirement.
---
CCP wants to bamboozle us again.
---
Declare bankruptcy.
---
No shit, you've been earning too much isk for too long haha. Nothing say isk more than a a full bling 60 man sleipnir army
---
The botting caused inflation. It hasn't gone anywhere.
---
&gt; Pray tell which regions of null have been killed off due to no local? And how exactly has the PvP content been stopped because of it?
---
I guess you haven't seen the Rorqual market in the last couple of weeks XD
---
Or the ore markets for that matter.
---
I don't think anyone argues a asset safety removal because they want it like wspace. The issue is you can't deny people their assets for long periods of time through war like you used ot with old stations lul just  asset safety its all good I barely lose anything.
---
I mean you can jump a overwhelming force in look at the rage eviction and them bringing in 400 bombers at once. ( not overwhelming btw) but mass is limited but that much can kill anything.
---
So far these changes haven't left null empty have you looked at vale? like 6 groups taking sov there and fighting I fly with one of them. It hasn't really hurt small groups I don't think most of you know because you don't fly with them. They are still printing isk but they aren't rorqual mining cause they never have been able to pre changes.
---
Wormholes can be boring at times but the content I get is generally always a higher quality then what I get in nullsec(specially armor brawls fuck ya). The thing is that dread is dead the second its caught the only issue is not as many people in wspace since CCP nerfed capital escalations. Back in the day more krabs used to die because more rage rolling and log off traps.  Though it's still not hard to get rolled in on at all unless your krabbing in au tz and then rip your dread or dreads and that can't happen to your super because fax army.

Removing mass wouldn't solve anything and I consider that argument as a joke.  Though maybe it's because you don't live here. You get content from rolling your hole for chains with people in them or krabs ratting. That would just help krabs when they get a chain that has no one worth worrying about it in.
---
Most wormhole people are for making wspace more dangerous like the addition to scrams in sites to stop mjd rattles/nestors. Wormhole sites already have a lot more tackle then kspace sites but no scrams. Also the removal of astrahus farming drifters.
---
wspace is only safer if running nestors/rattles which I've never seen anyone argue in favor for because its harmful to the game.If you want content and wspace expect to be content when your krabbing aswell.
---
Also I know wormholes can seem boring but it's great imo the corp dynamic is a lot better I'd actually call them like your family when your in a tightknit group that doesn't really happen in kspace in big blocs which If you ever get bored I'd check it out the brawls are fun even though they happen less often.
---
It's not really unrelated.
---
It's just that all turrets had their sig resolution changed to 40k.
---
When they finally coded the autopilot there were no gui for it so we had to start it with /autopilot in the chat window.

&gt;Says the guy that assumed the copter was in the wrong spot because it was in a tree.  
---
&gt;Something fucked up, it doesn't mean the chopper isn't exactly where it belonged.
---
That's literally what it means lol.
---
Maybe obviously any loss would be related by how big you fly, ie maybe we're talking about capitals loss that would mean you can't jump in another capital right after.
---
It's like when a pilot get podded in wormholes, you can't go back to help your friends
---
I get what he's going for, but I just don't see it happening in the way he intends. There has to be a balance for sure. However, that balance often ends up being a triad between fun times, efficacy, and trust, and we have plenty of evidence showing players are often willing to sacrifice their own enjoyment in the name of striking the optimal balance between efficacy and trust. If something can be done either in cooperation with others, or by running an army of alts yourself, then no matter how tedious the latter option, by God somebody out there is going to take the safer route of self-flagellation.

Players are still going to want to kick butt while preserving their own hard work as much as they can. They're still going to want to have large, dominant alliances that can improve their chances of achieving those ends and put their mark on the game. Players can't help themselves. The effort they put into staking their claim in EVE is real, and so they'll want to protect the fruits of their labor as much as possible, even if CCP makes doing so less fun to do with others. And if the do-it-yourself paranoid approach happens to prove more reliable than trusting corpmates with responsibilities after the changes, then the paranoid EVE as a second job absolute dictators will have a tendency to percolate to the top. The future might still be large alliances run by people with too much trust (in their own alts), only now with smaller leadership circles of real players and more burnout.

No, they contributed.

&gt; Ok link one, do anything to support any statement you've made today besides being a faggot that says 'look it up'. 
---
You must really hate gay people.

&gt;Says the guy that came in and put a  stupid idea in print then started screaming that people who didnt like  his idea were scared of change.  
---
&gt;What a piece of human garbage you are.
---
You are the one who started that, I just responded in kind.  Its definitely not me whose the human piece of garbage here.  You have done nothing but essentially been a rude, disgusting person since you started posting.  You are the one that is the human garbage by far and its sad you dont realize it.
---
New pasta
---
Lol yes
---
So delete supers.
---
Improvise, Adapt, Overcome.
---
Or rather - liquidate, let omega run out, wait half a year.
---
Because screw CCP and their shotgun testing of bad ideas. It's getting out of hand recently.
---
WHers also kill more ISK per person than null.
---
The over abundance of titans is directly tied to skill injectors but they would rather keep their money faucet running
---
I feel like they should increase the prob strength by default, or make virtue set cheaper. It's really not fun to scan for hours but that's wormhole life
---
They‚Äôve also deleted about 22,000 accounts this year (bottling, RMT, hacking)
---
This isn't really whining, this is stating facts. Things might change, or not. Very zen, "what is the sound of a ship not docking?"
---
"none of the big wh corp do pve" right.
---
22,000 total (including RMT and hacking)
---
Because they can‚Äôt put those super pilots in subs and f1. Yup, solid plan
---
Oh you mean those predictable gates that lead to  hit spots you know you will find content in. Or maybe those bridges that skip a lot of those tedious jumps. Yeah, we ain‚Äôt got that bud.
---
thats cool with me, people that roll holes do so to prevent content.  I dont PVE. I am a math genius and a PVPer
---
Gun control in Texas. Lmbo, good luck
---
Hey all, It's been over a year since I made a video and I really wanted to get a refresher on my editing skills so here's my POV of the EQWO-Y Fight. Please let me know what you think!
