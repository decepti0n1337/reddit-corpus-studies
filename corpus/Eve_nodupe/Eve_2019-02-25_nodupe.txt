Lmao so now you think guys won that fight?

That says something about the quality of your acquaintances. I scrape the bottom of the barrel in highsec.

Yeah, I'm curious how much total goo was extracted from what I assume is all of southern Fountain

Intel Wars

C1-3 wormholes and nullsec, and just a T1 exploration frigate.
---
I've never even thought of hacks to be a thing in Eve either for some reason. Other games it seems a regular occurrence but Eve just seems different.
---
Not having to aim probably.
---
Confirmed?
---
Honestly 
---
its also true. The max damage and minimum align time untanked nyx is the VNI of 2019

That’s it. Wow

Do I need hacking or something?

have many more times are you going to copy paste the same comment?

Oh, that sounds like fun!   Can I come out with my freighter and join you?    o/

Dont you miss the Guardian Vexor? Fuck I wanted one so bad. But for PvP. Not this late stage horseshit.

I wonder how many delve minutes goons will say that cost

With null being just as safe or safer than highsec of course people leave high.

Before the moon mining changes, moon goo was mined by POS, and there were only so many of the best moons, and they were in certain regions/systems. Those got fought over. I also feel like the game used to have a lot more RP in it too. 
---
I played the game most actively from 2006-2009 and 2011-2013. Maybe it's just my rose tinted glasses. 
---
Great, you can have all of them. Nobody else wants to. Reward system (crafting/ lottery) is quite un- enjoyable.
---
And CCP is sending mails "guardian gala event ending soon, you can still participate!!!111"... Looks like an attempt to get people to do the event since participation is low.

you said:
---
&gt;As opposed to pl titans that won't even cyno in range of the enemy?
---
i said:
---
we did
---
so now that we have that out of the way if you wanna talk about who won ualx we can do that too
---
in addition to the keepstar, [we killed almost as much isk worth of dreads as we lost in titans, *and then we also killed 3 of your titans*. we won the objective (the keepstar), and the isk war](https://zkillboard.com/related/30004807/201807190800/)
---
in reality what you're probably talking about here is the fact that you nerds wasted 5 days of your life 24 hour hellcamping our super fleet.
---
but instead of actually doing anything with that time when you guys actually had the numbers to push objectives and we didn't have the supers to stop you, you did *nothing* except burn out your members manning the walls because even logged off and camped, our supers were still too intimidating for you
---
and after all that time the only kills it got you were that one blades of grass titan who didn't listen when he was told to stay logged off, and a few tri caps who logged in and suicided because they brought caps to the fight in ualx on their mains and needed to free up the characters
---
so grats
---
then the one time tapi actually did try to do anything during the hellcamp, by trying to reinforce pl's staging fort in zmv, it turned into [a hilarious welp](https://zkillboard.com/related/30004820/201807231900/) 
---
because you dinobrained retards can't fucking do anything right, even shitpost on reddit
---
go home, kid
---
It like we are reading completely different threads. 
---
makes sense
---
Not even words. A *name*. The words were inoffensive. 
---
I do agree that there does need to be some re visiting done to modules, however one of the other bonuses in your case is fitting room. If someone wants to make a fit without going extremely bling in order to have the fitting for the MPL II's, the Duals become a viable choice just for fitting room.
---
This might have been a test how players would react to lootboxes/ lootbox-ish mechanics.
---
Next event: Buy crates for plex straight from The Agency
---
On twitter, OP said he reported it to the GMs. 
---
Can you imagine? Reporting people to the GMs for having a *name* in the bio. The words aren't merely inoffensive and harmless, they're perfectly applicable to Eve and its gameplay and meta. Yet here we have someone so pathetic that they are going to try and police *harmless words* because they are so thin-skinned that they can't even be reminded the man existed without having conniptions. 
---
Do you know what a lot of the people who fought and died in that war did it for, fuckwit? The right to free speech. It's not a all-encompassing right, or entirely inviolate. There's many little exceptions to it, like hate-speech or inciting crimes/violence and so on, but this right here? 
---
The attempt to police someone's public speech because you're offended by the *existence of a name*? That's something those people would fucking fight *you* over. 
---
I loathe so much about the goons, but quoting something perfectly applicable and apt about Eve in an Eve Character's bio? Fuck me, you must bruise in light rain you worthless little shit. 
---
Well it's pretty common knowledge to even people who don't actively play eve that it's Burn Jita weekend.
---
I have nothing against the distribution of sites... I'm against the loot and how it's obtained.
---
People dislike this event so much I was giving away tokens and bpc's for free and no blue wanted them.
---
Is it really necessary to post any time init does anything?
---
COSMOS was supposed to take care of that. But they fired all the good devs and/or they quit.

WH bots are just as easy lmao. Eve PvE is solved.
---
How about what actually happened:
---
1) PL talked shit about coming to evict TEST from Eso with your big and scary super fleet
---
2) Jumped the said super fleet into a fight exactly once, lost the fight, got camped in for a week, and then immediately tucked tail and ran  back north.
---
3) Goes to help daddy NC. at X47, waits until all friendly and hostile Titan fleets commit to the grid already, cynos in completely out of range at the back of the formation, and then bails out again.
---
If new players are injecting into freighters and plexing the ISK to buy the hull, and they lose it- that's their fault they wasted their money. Welcome to Eve, HTFU

It actually looks a lot like he is searching for free supers. Titans be ok too.
---
Must be a shit bot then... 
---
Whatever you say goon
---
Talking Amarr ships, unless you're trying to fit more than 2 reps/plates, it shouldn't be much of a problem if you have energy weapons rigging IV and power grid management V. Also filling your 6th implant slot for that bit of extra fitting space is often far cheaper than blinging a module
---
It's the rose tinted glasses. The only difference now is you need to manually mine the moon's. 
---
I'm getting nostalgia seeing PL caps on a BR.

---
yea, you can do the gurista watch in about 2 minutes and the serpentis watch pretty quick too.  silver tags make it go extra fast.
---
He is still selling his assets in jita so he can buy another freighter
---
You need to learn how to use d-scan. It is useful in lowsec, nullsec and wormhole. Don’t go to any of these areas if you do not know how to use d-scan. The trick is to know when you are being hunted. In lowsec, you already have the best intel, ie, local chat. You also need to learn to fit your ship better. Looking at the loss mails, you probably need to skill up to use T2 mods. If you have not invested much into Amarr and want to rats in Serpentis/Guristas space, I suggest using weapon systems that can do Kin and/or Therm damage.
---
Yes
---
Yeah 6th slot is cheap but if I remember correctly last time I tried fitting a solo amarr BS with MPL II's I couldn't really make it work. I believe I was trying to fit twin rep, web, grappler, scram. My fitting skills are perfect.
---
Could be wrong though. I definitely agree that older modules need a touch up. Now that ECM has been blatted in to oblivion all of the ecm ships need something done to them as well.

---
&gt;1) PL talked shit about coming to evict TEST from Eso with your big and scary super fleet
---
yuh huh and then we moved it down and started kicking over keepstars. ualx wasn't the first
---
&gt; 2) Jumped the said super fleet into a fight exactly once, lost the fight, got camped in for a week, and then immediately tucked tail and ran back north.
---
we jumped our super fleet in looking for a fight like 19 fucking times, the one time you guys actually nutted up was the time when you had goons on the way to back you up
---
&gt;3) Goes to help daddy NC. at X47, waits until all friendly and hostile Titan fleets commit to the grid already, cynos in completely out of range at the back of the formation, and then bails out again.
---
we actually didn't jump supercaps into x47 at all iirc - afaik vince told us not to. we jumped in some dreads onto jay's bus to somewhat comic effect - half of our dreads either never loaded grid or never had modules function, but his disconnected titan was somehow able to log back in before dying, eject a nestor, refit to boson, and successfully fire it :ccp:
---
#it's not actually that hard to get your facts straight before you open your stupid mouth
---
#try it
---
Yeah rorqual as a hard cyno with enough scams to hold a super.  
---
Works 0.00001% of the time.  
---
you're clearly not paying attention
---
&gt; The only difference now is you need to manually mine the moon's. 
---
that's a pretty fucking huge difference, as it happens not everyone wants -or have the manpower- to mine hours upon hours like yall nullkrabs do.
---
Empty JFs and loaded freighters have become basically unusable near Jita over the past year. 
---
It's come to the point CCP will probably take action at some point.
---
Oh cool, learn something everyday. I know there's the Serpentis one that needs Gold Tags as well that I never get so I haven't blitzed it.

This is a bullshit event, never supported it, never liked it and quite frankly, i dont get what its all about.

Look up red frog freight.

Also split up huge collateral contracts like that into smaller pieces if possible. Most people aren't gonna take a 3billion collateral because it opens them to suicide ganks.

Best ask in ingame Haulers Channel.

But currently with Jita Burning not many people will move stuff from there.

I wish you could enter PvP Arena without the PvE beforehand.

Nobody is gonna do a public contract that requires a freighter to go through 8 null/lowsec systems.
---
Oh shit...OPSEC... muh bad

Thanks. Yep I scanned down a Ded site and made 20mill from it the other day that was kind of what sparked me to love low as I had some extra isk. Now that is gone and my operation has moved back to .5 for now

I'm not sure you're aware of what you're saying here

I like this idea. Send help

Well the good news is today I learned about warp drive reinforcement lol. Skills for tech 2 blasters are in training but now I got to grind back some isk

lmao, imagine being in this much denial

Ohh thanks I will look into what that means 
---
what's babylon 5-bil
---
I meant vs the vast majority of ships in the vast majority of situations, a faction scram has the same effect of a heavy scram. You've named one specific situation. Giving the heavy scram 3-5km more range doesn't change that scenario either 
---
I very easily plex my account in the first 10 days of the month. Maybe you can ask some questions and I can point you in the right directions.
---
scram strength is useful in cap brawls. Supers get tons of warp stab points as part of the ship (up to 60 on faction titans), so when you need to stop something that deals capital style damage, tackle supers with heavy scrams are used.
---
lol use webbers
---
Fuck, someone call the fire department, this dudes burning... 
---
Of course there are exceptions; there are players who literally use ventures to PVP all day long lol. 
---
If you’re choosing WH exploration to fund your account, T1 is a bad idea. It will take you forever by the time you factor in losses and general hacking time as your ship has no real bonuses.

They shoulda just made new ships. Raven War Issue or something idk put that fancy skin on it and give it +1 mid and -1 low and active tank bonus instead of missile range. Keep the stats tech I and make it an alternative to the normal raven instead of a flat upgrade.

I was excited as a new player that you could quickly inject into a freighter, but I found out it would be $100s.  This subreddit is so misleading.

Carl Sagan wrote a book about aliens that received contact from Earth in the form of a Hitler speech at the opening of the Berlin Olympic games.

that's literally always been the case though but before it was train 2-4 chars at once (and still is like this really).

Completely wrong, characters gained a ridiculous amount of value with skill extractors. Your character is worth much much much more now than before.

SP system has always been kind of shit imo so i'm glad for injectors even though i think they are simply a band aid over a shit system

1: Red Frog exists. They're basically the trucker's union.

2: Jita, if you're not aware, is filled with goon kamikaze pilots right now. Hilarious to watch, tons of jump freighters to salvage, the works. Heck, you might be able to make more than your stuff is worth and buy it from scratch with enough of these.

The CSM is worthless because they're not trying to improve the game anymore. It's all politics and getting an edge for their bloc. CCP has continued to kill off play styles and even when CSM members for those groups existed CCP straight up ignored them. At this point kill off the CSM, because CCP is going to continue to do whatever CCP wants to do.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-rX2TicL5eg hitler was a human just like us, very loving of his family and loyal to his friends. He didnt do evil for the sake of evil, he truly thought he was doing the right thing for his people. If we forget hitler was just a person and assume everything he does is evil, we risk history repeating and more genocides happening, like the recent genocide/ethnic cleansing of the rohingya in myanmar under the rule of a certain nobel peace prize winner
---
Doesn't mean much coming from lowsechnaya, no offense.
---
The reward's not terrible. It probably just wasn't seen by anybody with a jump freighter. Octanneve is a highsec island. Try a courier service.
---
I think the larger contributor is the decentralization of industry and trade as a result of ECs. Most groups are now able to produce much of their product within their own space and so they don't need to travel to Jita to both buy/sell as much anymore. I would venture to guess that JF traffic in and out of the Forge was on a steady decline.

Also genetically enhanced livestock.... for when the standard livestock doesn't moo enough for you.

sounds like thatjodie foster movie tbh. who is this sagan hack?
---
Wouldn't say smart, the number of ships dying hasn't changed much.
---
Judging from the amount of salt on local, not well.
---
It's not really a subcap module. I guess you could fit it on a battleship but there's not much reason to as you've noted. 
---
This module is for capital ships that need to hold tackle on supercapital ships which have high inherent warp core resistance. 
---
This technique was used to great effect during the battle of X47L-Q for the NCdot Keepstar in August of 2018, when Imperium Supercarriers fit with dual heavy warp scrams held hard tackle on enemy Titans to prevent them from re-tethering to their Keepstar, allowing them to be volleyed off the field by doomsdays.

INB4 all the amateur historians make claims that his numbers of massacred persons is lower, or the invasion of Gaul was not a genocide (which it wasn't) but it was still brutal and an unnecessary slaughter of human lives.

I use my JF every week. Just don’t fucking gate jump it to trade hubs, ever. 
---
No they don't, tbh.
---
Here's the best recap I could find. 
---
It's dangerous out there. There's fighting going on everyday, for very relevant and clear reasons. You need safety in a large megacoalition. We're looking at a vast amount of unwashed individuals, like the shower industry is at an all time low. These massive nullbloc alliances have enough collective smegma to bury someone alive. But it's ok, as we're all safe. They've got asset safety. The path of least resistance has never been easier to take, you don't need a varying opinion when you can be an irrelevant face in the crowd. 
---
At the end of the day, we're all looking around to see who's got the most girth of all, and which direction are you supposed to bend over to appeal to who. That's what matters. We're looking at renters here, the thing people don't realize is that NS only consists of renters, ie. goons, test, pl/nc, etc. Renters are the lower caste of society as they are easily directed by promising them a larger wallet, they'll get on all fours and do all the degrading things you ask. It's just their type of character.
---
All in all, I think the meta is quite healthy at the moment.
---
"Damn you got me good. Jk I was just flair bating" /r/eve 2019

Yeah, I don't always love Shingly's music choices, but the videos are always on point.  At least it's not the dabbing skeleton show, eh?
---
&gt; becoming smart, everyone joining goons or player numbers declining. Anything carrying anything worth something is being ganked in Uedama/Jita. Everyone I know basically stopped using their JFs.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;It's come to the point CCP that will probably take action soon. We're not far off the tipping point that we recently reached with wardecs.

If you can land a web, you can land a scram.

I had a lot of fun helping out with the antiganking this year. Its not the easiest of jobs, but feels really good when you save someone being bumped. 
---
Its fun to do the rest of the year too, but the bumps dont normally last long enough to dock up, switch ships and head to whichever system has someone getting ganked. During burn jita, it seemed like someone in a freighter or orca was being bumped every minute of the weekend.

NavPoc? I'm currently fitting one, as it's a fairly expensive ship I've been looking around for advice! I have problems on the CPU front so I was going to fit navy heat sinks, it makes the ship cost ~900m. I think a fully fit NavPoc coming in at 900m is okay, especially since some people fly around in NavPocs worth 2bn...
---
My planned fit is like this atm:
---
High: 8 MPL II's
---
Mid: AB II, Heavy Cap Booster II, Warp Scram II, Grap II
---
Low: Imperial Navy Heat Sink ×3, Energised adaptive nano membrane II ×2, Damage Control II, Ancilliary armor rep, Armor rep II
---
Rig: Burst Aerator II, Explosive Armor I, Kinetic Armor I

Had a talk with some guy I knew from HS who is still living there. Told him "No Jita this WE, bud!" and he srsly asked "Why that? I needa sell some stuff". He had ZERO clue whats going on.
---
This is rough man...
---
In general, fits for travel, exploration and combat are very different. If you anticipate the need to switch between them, then yes, bring the appropriate modules / rigs / subsystems and a mobile depot.
---
For travel, a common approach is nullified and cloaked, while minimizing align time and maximizing warp speed -- often with a few warp core stabs thrown in for good measure.
---
So when a botter loses all his shippos… how long to replace all that?
---
Prices are down across the board.  You can thank the Goons for that actually.  Over mining the Delve has made market profitability go down significantly.  On the other hand if you are a buyer it is a great market so ratters who still make the same ISK regardless of market conditions are winning big right now.
---
Keep in mind that in order to anchor a structure, you either need to have your own corp, or appropriate roles in another corp (you can't be in one of the NPC corps).
---
You will need a ship large enough to carry the structure to the place where you're going to deploy it (the Raitaru is 8000 m3).
---
The structure will be extra vulnerable while it's anchoring -- and that period can be pretty long, depending on exactly which system you use.
---
There are a few details you may want to think about during the deployment process, such as which side of the structure faces the sun (the other side is often in shadow), and whether you want it oriented so that the undock pre-aligns you with a frequent destination (station, citadel, gate). Once the deployment has been fully started, those things can't be changed.
---
If you've never deployed a structure before, you may want to do a practice run on Singularity.

You can access the contents of an MTU the same way you access the contents of a wreck or a can. You can either right-click on the MTU in space or in the overview, or select it and click on the little box icon to open. If you're not close enough to access it, your ship will be set to approach.
---
After that, again it's like a wreck: either select the items you want and drag them into your cargo hold, or click the Loot All button. Anything left in the MTU when you scoop it into your hold will be dropped in a jetcan.

No, but the thought wasn't lost on us to try and ransom then kill anyways.  We were more or less just out for blood after 5 days of on and off camping his safe.

Those are some big numbers

Tbh wecu . Whoever they are . Are more use then fweddit ever where ?!!!!
---
Derive meaning?  You literally said it is worse to quote Hitler strictly because people he hurt are still alive.
---
Someone has mentioned that specific situation, and again, giving it a bit more range doesn't change that scenario. Giving it more range means it has a use on battleships, and is worth saving the powergrid space for. Otherwise why even have it as an option for a battleship pilot? It's just a noob trap atm
---
I find it funny that the type of people who are offended by the mention of Hitler's name are the same people who think everyone's opinion matters and everyone gets a trophy because we are all winners.  Hitler is a perfect example of why not everyone's opinion matters.  That includes yours OP.
---
This is the attitude that starts genocide.  If someone has a difference of opinion they don't matter and should only be made fun of.  It is how Hitler viewed Jewish, gay, and disabled people.  Then he killed them.
---
Hitler's life has a very important lesson for all of humanity, and if you don't take him seriously then we are doomed to repeat his atrocities.

In order for high-sec pubbies to join Delve, they'd have to get involved with pvp. You can't join the Imperium without at least fighting for it. Most would suffer from the issue of no longer being able to do pubbie waves too. Either they're joining and becoming better players for it, or they're staying in highsec and getting ganked anyway.
---
That's only partially why. If you join the shipping channels in game, you'll see all the contracts are simply broken into smaller contracts and as a result, the Deep Space Industrial is now the main tool used. If one dies, the other 9 get through is the theory. This has become exactly how most of the larger trade contracts are moved around highsec these days. Many of these contracts are going to Goon alts anyway haha. :P
---
Please
---
Stop
---
Posting
---
Kthx 
---
When I've spied in their shipping channels, I asked them that question quite a few times. The answer comes back to a numbers game. Many shipping businesses run multiple alts. If one out of ten don't get through, they can wear the loss no problem was the answer. I'm sure there's plenty of newbie pubbies who don't know it's Burn Jita week too, but the established space truckers see it as simply a numbers game.
---
Lmao literally just join one of the C tier imperium alliances that are allowed in delve and do 1 fleet a year
---
Yeah that looks pretty solid. Granted when I fit ships I try to go as cheap as possible while also meeting the role that I intend it for and using up as much cpu and pg as possible. 
---
I started on a T1 Apoc, I think all told it was like 300-350m with drugs? Given what insurance pays on T1 battleship hulls this makes learning with them pretty darn cheap. I never actually got to test it because I kinda realized that I sucked too much to solo in a BS, but I digress. 
---
Besides the small fact that we won recently major battles against PanFam, we often deliberately target PanFam's shipments anyhow. Just because some poor pubbie happens to be carrying their war merchandise, does not make them an illegitimate target. Hitting enemy shipping to stop them rearming or hurting their supply lines is a legitimate wartime activity. We're still at war if you haven't noticed.

A rev is what, $1500?

You dont need exceptionally anything for that.

Any developer or similar and above qualified job gives you that buffer..

Its all about priorities.

You are equally as offended lol. Otherwise why write this bullshit of yours?

Some asshole reported my alpha named "Bluntsmoking AnusDestroya" and I had to rename it.  The potrait was perfect, he looked baked as fuck, and indeed it looked like he intended to destroy your anus.

No clue why you are being downvoted here. That guy spewed 4 paragraphs of pure bullshit in defense of a Hitler quote. What a fucking waste.

They would do "Burn PH" but then what would they do for the rest of the day?

Happy cake day you beautiful furry.

oof, should definitely write another couple of paragraphs and elaborate my dude.

Actual bait lmao 
---
Yep. Ask Dura for more info
---
Yeah those kill mails really reflect on your statement. Majority of the freighter that died didn’t have anything remotely fitting to your story. Its for the luls or as others would call it, Griefing. If anything should be changed, It should be the ability to gank someone in highsec. My mind is blown on how war mechanics, awoxing, along with everything else changed yet this is still acceptable. Eve is definitely a game tailored to a certain group of people. Logically, the act you’re trying to justify should be the first removed from game.
---
https://i.imgur.com/XRmc50v.png
---
Point to me where on the graph the bad afk vni touched you.
---
The main thing you may be lacking is a strong intel network. Down in nullsec, I have intel several regions out open. So I know exactly when gankers are coming to Delve long before they get here (besides wormholes). By the time they're 5 jumps away, I know exactly where they are and I'm aligned ready to dock. By the time they finally reach my system, I've either docked up or pulled out a bait ship. I can see them enter my system on local too because I have systems in place pinging me red alerts. Unless a wormhole opens up in my actual system, I'm covered. I've already scanned down all the holes up to the point of deciding to rat or mine.  
---
Several of us, also place cloaky alts on gates. We have eyes before they arrive.  
---
I have several other things I do to give me perfect intelligence on gankers but I won't reveal that here (trade secrets). If they are on grid with you, you have failed long before they land. Join an entity and use their intelligence channels. That'll be a good start to safety.
---
Seems tiny is playing again

Do you type like elo after his 12th line on purpose or is it just a side effect of your shit schooling
---
Thanks for the tip my next omen will be less brickish
---
How do you get it to the trade hub without a cyno up it’s ass then?
---
This is the kind of story that always draws me into this game. This is the one game when you start describing it to people they are like wow that sounds so sweet... 
---
As a German who did not fail to pay in school, you generally learn exactly this and to not just jump blindly on the nearest propaganda bandwagon just because it gives you an emotional feel good trip, regardless of political direction, or to dehumanize those who have an opinion differing from your own, including Nazis.
---
Also, while OP is seemingly a German himself, I somewhat have my doubts that he would have recognized who said quote originated from, or had any strong emotional reaction to it without the name directly tacked on.
---
In any case, while quoting that vile little man may be poor taste, this quote is relevant enough when it comes to EVE, and it is not some form of direct hate speech, nor does stuffing it in his bio mean the player in question endorses those ideologies. More likely he is just trying to either be "edgy" or use it to "make fun" of both the game and Hitler.
---
Yeah, goons are scary
---
if you want shitty balance, boring gameplay and pissed off players, then this is the right attitude.
---
1. just because something is underused, it doesn't necessarily needs a buff to be viable (non-invented-bias)
---
2. "fast" nerf reactions tend to break things completely
---
3. planning/investment, if something is strong, many players are investing in it. if you overnerf stuff at this point, you alianate alot of players
---
ccp does a good job to make active mechanics when they overhaul or make new ships. (booshers, active aoe neut of citadels, ADCs, etc)
---
active mechanics give players more opportunity to fight with and against something, instead of just "take it or leave it"

Unsure if this is bait but you realise balance changes have to be well thought out, discussed and tested over time. You can't really just walk in and start changing shit.

Also, who said the balance changes you want are actually valid?

As a side note, does anyone know why that beautiful ping sound you hear when you get killmails, is not working for me? I can hear other sounds in game fine.
---
Next time you have to wait a week for a petition response let me know. I'm defending the right to use a non offensive Hitler quote. People have the right to be trashy. 
---
Goonswarm is populated with braindead retards, more at 1900
---
Damn, there is some salt going on here!  And of course Goons jump in all sensative about RMT since that was their battle cry in the northern war!  lol
---
Yeah, was a rough estimate, utterly VVVVVV with hostiles in system, in wormholes pulse it rather than spam it so your fingers don't get tired.

You’re a day late and a dollar short to the thread

They are amassing a retaliatory strike.

Posts like this actually explain why so many freighters dies every year 
---
209 kills in one hilarious minute.
---
I mean, technically we could end wealth inequality and a whole host of social problems in Western Civilization with a few tweaks in a database somewhere IRL. But the fallout from such a thing could be apocalyptic. 
---
Eve maybe not so much... but still.
---
Whatever space you choose find some people to play with that have experience and you get along with. They will be able to help you with fits to get the most out of your ships and suggest ways to do the activity that could be easier. But I do remember the struggle especially while waiting for all the support skills to train.
---
What kind of changes did you have in mind?
---
Who'd have guessed my little comment would spawn such lengthy replies!
---
I'm prouda y'all! 
---
Now to actually source the quote and find out whom it got stolen from!
---
Y'know, because mustachio assuredly didn't come up with it himself.
---
Meh, anyway - good reads. Let's continue this in ... ~80 years with Trump, or let's meet a few years earlier - I heard about a guy named Mao tse-tung!
---
You wit' me?
---
Him saying Hitler isn't the problem here
---
Adapting historical quotes to eve should definitely be bannable though
---
why is it GREEN and CYAN? 
---
i like how you get a battle report for a drone, sadly we dont get those for warrioer I's :( 
---
in a 15 year old game that has a meta as deep as the Mariana Trench, simply changing some numbers around will break things more than you think 
---
There is a deployment? 
---
Nah man just increase warp scrambler distance on orthrus up by 100% per cruiser level instead of 10%, it's just numbers bro.
---
You don't get ejected, but once you undock, you wont get back in.
---
Are you able to use the item hangar and place contracts from the citadel?
---
(If I have stuff in a citadel that changed hands and I no longer have docking rights, but a character logged in)
---
You die IRL.
---
I have no idea why people are afraid to form against us with how frequently we feed.
---
I agree, it would be nice to get killmails for more drone categories. For example, the 40m isk 'augmented' drones could also get one, especially since 1m ships and 10m fighters already do. Either way, I am grateful that we at least get them for excavs.
---
so did you jump it out? 
---
some gave bjorn an eberus, no clue if its dead yet 
---
You can access your items. For example in nullsec you get older players login to find themselves in a faction fortizar that once was a station. He is in an NPC corp and his former alliance used to own that space years ago. These people usually firesale their items and possesions to the current locals - so yeah, you can make contracts etc.
---
You are most likely limited to other services - e.g. cloning bay probably won't work for you and stuff like that.
---
Let me ask a hypothetical. In your example you want to move a Munnin high to a mid. However in the game are thousands of fitted ships that have an item in that slot. The game doesn't have the code to auto unequip that item to ship cargo, and even if it could some of the ships have full cargo holds. So either these mods get lost or a high slot item is now in a ship's mid slot and can be exploited. Still as easy as changing a number in a database?
---
Those renters didn't need that hell anyways. Because, in 2k19, if you need a hel, you:
---
1. Either park it in the keepstar
---
2. Or logoff a char in it
---
However, if you don't need one, but you can't make yourself get rid of it, you put it under a POS field. It works as an announcement to spies to get into your corp and steal it, to free you from the chains of ratting.
---
I would not say it's obvious, you are referring to a ship added into the game later than others and specifically coded for that purpose. Other ships might not have that contingency coded in.
---
That fit uses 27500/27500 pg btw, you need the 3% cpu implant, energy weapons rigging V and powergrid V but seeing 100.00% on one of the stats... "all muh support skills"
---
The T1 Apoc is really hard to fit well, I'm pretty sure that's because it's numbers are awful, I'd only use it for missions 
---
Because you've seen the video, haven't you? Would they manage to spend their time boarding, unboarding, re-boarding, figuring out how the scooping ships works, figuring out where is the scoop ship button, and how it is different from board ship, aligning, re-aligning, and exclaiming without a distraction fleet? Those well prepared professionals would not, IMHO. So, thus, a distraction fleet.
---
Obviously, the author wanted to apply "ALL FIXING CHANGES". It's that simple! /s
---
If you're just not on the docking list, like the module's still running etc., then yes, the job will keep going and be deliverable at the end. However, you can't start a new job or access the delivered items if you've left the station, and if the module went offline (fuel went low, turned off by owner) that will have paused the job and you cannot restart it.
---
Had a local freeport close it's doors while I had jobs running, and was able to let one compete and deliver it, but just couldn't get in to get the stuff or start a new one. Luckily in my case, after that I mailed the station owner, who was a sweetheart and gave me access back until all my current jobs were delivered and removed. 
---
It'd lag down the server so hardcore in fleet fights. Imagine a 150 man ishtars fleet having their drones smar
---
tbombed off 
---
I just want to mention that buying that fit in Arnon is probably doubling the cost, perhaps more.
---
maybe I'm not seeing the same picture as everyone else but changing numbers is clearly less difficult than adding new gimmicks, while being just as impactful
---
i don't get why everyone else is going jUsT ChANge tHE nUMbeRs lmao
---
4) Some beliefs popularly held by the community are just flat out wrong.
---
Don't ask ccp to mess with chat further pls
---
Standings
---
They can just push killmail data into a queue to be processed asynchronously without affecting the production servers. It would be a fun project to work on.
---
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message\_queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_queue)
---
You do realise that they actually implemented this Muninn balance change? Ships that are fitted with 6 instead of 5 highslots simply cant be undocked until you unfit that extra high slot module. So it still is that easy.
---
Did you literally google "Names that start with W" for Welwala?
---
People are dying as often if not more often - simply much poorer 
---
the famous retardobot
---
What if it's already undocked at the time of the change? Either way the point of the hypothetical question is to point out that there are often unforseen factors to something that seems simple on the surface. Even if they coded these changes in the point is some coding was required at some point. Saying flip a switch and all is fixed is a little bit of an oversimplification.
---
Anyone who has Amazon Prime and enjoys sci-fi, has heard of Expanse =)
---
no u!
---
I googled it and saw that. I don't remember it from the books, but I love the expanse.
---
And this is why nobody takes Capri serious. 
---
Considering there's a lot of staff that need that income to pay their bills in life, and there's a lot more people who enjoy the game itself, yeah - it's a risky move.
---
Sure, not on the level of making nuclear weapons, but even a fucking moron should have been able to figure that difference out. 
---
Oh...
---
Instead of changes some numbers, you should do what? Add more layers of complexity in form of extra mechanics? Do nothing at all??
---
We get it, Eve is a complex sandbox, tweaking some numbers still is the simplest approach to actually keeping this game interesting. (Read cheapest from a business perspective, which should be of interest to the CCP execs focused on milking their cash cow)
---
I would like ANY form of balance!!! Adjusting some numbers clearly is the most economical way of achieving this, which is all CCP seems to care about nowadays. 
---
It's a solid show I would definitely recommend to any fans of the genre. I was on the fence until s1e4, after which it had my full attention. 
---
What do the different numbers mean next to CSM on your flair?
---
CCP should hire this guy so they can make another meme become reality: Eve is dying
---
Also for ppl who don't hide passive modules. 
---
Maybe we should have some apocalyptic fallout in EVE, shake things up and stop making the game so stale.
---
Sorry, I annoyed you with fact based arguments.
---
12,13bil for a fit hel I don't think that's possible. 
---
Hull only well I could believe that since it's delve
---
Who fucking cares, break some things fix some things. At least shit is shaken up instead of being stale.
---
Which is why you don't aim for completely balanced game and instead aim for constantly changing the numbers.
---
They take waaaaay to fucking long and dedicate waaaaay to little resources into balancing the game for that to work. 
---
Who the fuck cares about the Assault class ship rebalance and the addition of triangle ships, if 80% of the current PvP Meta is making people quit the game en masse. 
---
It turns out that the majority of gamers don't want true balance. They want to be able to use their deeper gamer knowledge to get an advantage over other players.
---
Incomparable powers has constantly propelled games like League of Legends forward and is taking root in others such as Over Watch. 
---
You might want to actually learn about game design first.
---
If that means VNI become hunters and my battle proc can instawarp than I am with you.
---
This is one of the most retarded activity in EVE - player can do nothing to defend against such bombrun. Hope CCP will introduce decloaking structure ASAP to prevent such reterds to camp in systems for months.
---
Goonswarm (a player group) has been doing this years iteration of an event called *Burn Jita*, where they and their affiliates try to suicide gank *everything* in Jita and the surrounding systems - which spawns a lot of Concord NPCs where those ganks take place (usually gates).
---
yes, but changing one number is like turning a gear, and each ship is connected to the next, turn the gear too much on one ship and all the other ones suddenly become reelevant, just look at what the triglavians did, they are by far the most popular anticap BS ot there now   
---
instead of just "turning the gears" (changing numbers), it would be much better in the long term to see how the ships relate to another and shifting them around a bit, allowing em to do these on the fly "gear turns" w/ breaking the game as a whole 
---
i just wanna know what lady scarlet's reaction was, after threatening a 1bil fine to renters who get their supers destroyed.
---
Recall your drones
---
how about never use a jf to go to jita use a regular freighter and then take it to the jf. which would be located at a system right next to lowsec then jump out.
---
Their inaction has a large effect as well. Something they do not seem to comprehend
---
Bulgarian anti botting bots killing goon mining bots. Nothing to see here. 
---
Exploration has a huge RNG factor to it. One day you don't find anything and the other it's half a billion in half an hour.
---
For getting in and out of null I usually use wormholes. Much safer.
---
I disagree. I think you’re pretty new player.
---
For example that you mentioned, Heavy warp scramblers and distruptors are used a lot to tackle supers and titans.
---
Dual heavy pulse lasers eats way less pg and cpu than Mega pulse lasers and that’s the point. The most reason that makes to downsize weapon is fitting issue.
---
Of course Dual heavy pulse is shit module and be used in very specific situation like 650mm arty, hull repairer. 
---
But why not?
---
CCP can’t make every modules competent, and there is no reason to make every modules to be competent.
---
If some specific module is OP as fuck, It must get nerfed asap, cuz it will restrict lots of modules to be unused. But If some module is shit, It’s relatively ok because only one module is unused.
---
tbh I don’t have faith for CCP to balance well; considering CCP took fuckton of time to fix HIC’s OP scram and 500mn 8000m/s HIC, which was cancerous OP.
---
You have no clue how much work they do. They might do fuck all or they might have taken the great reception of the ADC as a hint to work on stuff like that to balance ships instead of tuning numbers.
---
Of course they could do more but judging their path without knowing it is just stupid.
---
Dear lord I should not have taken that self at my work yesterday. My work is ruined.
---
I take it you don't overheat your modules? 
---
NO JUST CHANGE SOME NUMBERS IN DB IS SO EZZZZZ
---
Very nice dude, glad to see you guys have gotten your footing again.
---
Well the testing could occur in the testing server, so maybe they can finalize rapid balance changes to be carried over to Tranquility instead of having literally nothing going on in Singularity for most of the time.
---
(or maybe be vocal about potential balance changes maybe bi-monthly instead of radio silence for months)
---
Grammar is important bko bko
---
Hi u/gorski_car
---
Because I think as exCSM you're kind of representative for the EVE community here are my answers to you (and others).  
---
1)  
---
I do not report the name: I report the idea and I report any attempt to make these ideas "great again".  
---
It's not a simple quote. It's about the entire context.   
---
Whenever you come to visit germany, just ping me on twitter, ingame or here on reddit and I show you some traces where these ideas lead to.  
---
2)  
---
I do not tolerate the intolerance:    
---
The freedom of speech is not the freedom of saying anything you want. It is the freedom of being heard and it is the freedom of having a decision.  
---
3)  
---
You can be 110% sure: I'm not writing tickets without google-ing a possible solution first. I don't write tickets without asking others first. I even tried to contact the player BEFORE writing the ticket. I know that there are potentially more important tickets than mine. But I'm glad, that there is a CCP-Gamemaster team which takes a few minutes to read my ticket.  
---
4)  
---
Who is pathetic? The one who says: "In my opinion something is wrong here" or the one who uses words like "fucking retard", "waste of time" or "little bitch" in his answer?
---
That size would put people off, it'll need either a freighter or a jump freighter, the collateral is another put off being 3 bil going through low sec
---
Fucking hell they should just have a random balance day on Singularity just to be able to fuck around with ships with god know's what kind of stats they have.
---
Oops, the RNG made the Ark into a super-agile egg basket, the Chimera has only 3 mids and full lows, and now the standard Vexor has the Guardian-Vexor's attributes OH WELLLL
---
I want to see some real crazy shit going on cause Singularity is forever ripe with potential.
---
making cheap and easy changes is how you fuck the whole game, the balance right now isn't great but its functional, encouraging CCP to just "change stuff" usually winds up with them completely fucking the pooch.
---
yeah, no one is posting here anymore except.....  Hmmm.
---
Push X is by far the best courier service out there, i cant say enough good things about them.
---
You are immediately ejected with all your belongings inside of it also scattered around the place so people can quickly scoop them up.
---
Lost one drone cause it took a millisecond to long to Recall. Still made over 1b profit.
---
Lottery winners prove this wrong.
---
This is the only type of player that goes to Delve anymore. Sad when players can't actually play the game and resort to *killing drones*. Just get more people and kill the Rorquals. Goons needs to die.
---
yeah fuck people who like to play their own way... 
---
Hear hear! I've yet to see any player-proposed suggestions that are not thinly veiled "devs should make my favorite build/class/hero OP this way plz".
---
Asynchrone was thé Key for that to work 
---
What is it about this 80% of the PvP meta? What aspect is it that is making people quit?
---
True. I think they do comprehend though, it's just that they have to chose one over the other. Which I guess they have.
---
the killmails are sure bigger,
---
but its shocking how many people fit 'ore' strip miners and deadspace hardeners and faction mining upgrades in the lows. ive ganked hulks worth as much as a billion isk. its mad.
---
Ah you are from Germany. That explains a lot. The germans do everything to forget the second world war ever happend. I know you are ashamed of your history and you should be, but censoring every 1 mentioning it will not make it that it never happend.
---
People should remeber all the awfull thing that Hitler and friends did in WW2 and learn from the mistakes the germans made.
---
I wish I had more than one upvote to give you
---
that has been said alot before.
---
limiting one rep per ship. once one fax rep is on somone no more from that ship or any other can be applied? dunno, its a bit complicated and a bit wierd but also might be a refreshing change to the current.   it was more the dread, outclassed fleet matchup and the fact they even bothered to cyno that made us leave. 
---
Tidi is great. I get so much ironing done.
---
The current balance actually isn't functional in the slightest, capitals push out every single subcap out of the small scale meta, and jaguars make 80% of subs unviable if you can somehow find fights without caps.
---
As far as fleet stuff go, you have 3 or 4 viable doctrines that completely stomp on everything else, one of which being 30m feroxes.

[https://www.twitch.tv/bjornbee/clip/BelovedTubularMosquitoKappa](https://www.twitch.tv/bjornbee/clip/BelovedTubularMosquitoKappa)  :D But I mean... A rev or something? Be a whole new level. Faction titan would be memes too.   
---
It did die, and got SRPed by ELO when he was flying with BL (died in the Snuff backstab)  so he still \*has\* a titan but not the same physical hull :D 
---
Honestly, except the Cap vs Subcap meta, it looks extremely nice currently. When I see how many ppl show up for brawls, and how many take brawls without dropping the hammer. I am pretty sure I am not alone in this. PVP is fucking great currently (unless you get hammered by supers ofc)
---
just like the amount of money in my bank account is a value in a database that can be changed
---
This is pretty cool, even if it becomes even more clear that abyssal pvp is something being done by only a handful of people on regular basis.
---
The site doesn't seem to update though?
---
tfw you don't have a cap refit to tank till the DT. 
---
This is awesome thank you!! 
---
Context ? 
---
Woah mind blown 
---
&gt; incomparable powers
---
What’s this? A type of GD/balance?
---
If you're in one of the 3-4 huge alliances going on official alliance deployments then yeah, F1 fleets are still as great as always.
---
If you're anywhere else then PVP is fucking abysmal right now.
---
Thank you for detailed response

With the stuff that is happening with Period Basis - there will be even less stuff moving.

why? it was all goons

---
Fuck yeah.
---
Please explain how exactly Mittani makes a living off goons playing Eve, I'm dying to know.
---
There is one thing you thing your forgetting about!
---
Under 1% of the eve population decides what ship's should be used in the fleets!!!
---
Nerf the fleet commanders!
---
this is retarded and every game that does this fails
---
If you just change some numbers you just change the meta to another ship
---
Lmao, **k**eep **y**ourself **s**afe.
---
I've fought Goons for 11 years and only someone who's this much of a pussiboi could actually make me want to take their side.
---
Goons are moving to Syndicate?

Missioning isn't good income for a new player. (If you have very good skills and do burner missions or things like that it can be though.) For new players best income is probably exploration. A T1 exploration ship costs only a few million and a single nullsec/wh relic site gives you back a multiple of that. So it's very easy to make any losses back. 
---
That said it's common and nice to run the SoE epic arc in the beginning. But it's not for the isk. Concerning the fit you gave a screenshot of: change the modules from T1 to meta, for example enduring afterburner. The web won't help you a lot but as a new player you'll be low on cap. So better fit a battery or so. Check the "PvE - Beginner Fit" on [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Coercer](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Coercer). I'm not sure if you can run the last mission of the SoE arc in it though.
---
&gt; Second, exploration ISK/hour is dogshit.
---
You should stop doing exploration in hisec.
---
&gt;I highly doubt you are able to plex just from exploration alone.
---
I could plex my account with 2 days of doing exploration in null but instead i paid for my account with USD and bought skill injectors with my exploration isk.

Still spreading salt all over Reddit I see. What you see there is the POS still standing and a mino wreck that drifted inside it. The BR shows it all my friend.
---
&gt;I do not report the name: I report the idea and I report any attempt to make these ideas "great again".It's not a simple quote. It's about the entire context.Whenever you come to visit germany, just ping me on twitter, ingame or here on reddit and I show you some traces where these ideas lead to.
---
Yeah, being an oversensitive bitch about it isn't going to do you any favors. You'll find that a *lot* of us Europeans have been to one or more of the concentration camps and I can assure you that piece of history is to this day living memory for most of our families. Haughtily declaring you have some sort of right to censor people because you're too much of a pussy to face a reminder of your own damn history makes you quite a bit of an asshole.
---
&gt; I do not tolerate the intolerance:The freedom of speech is not the freedom of saying anything you want. It is the freedom of being heard and it is the freedom of having a decision.
---
You have chosen to try and censor someone's *harmless, topical and relevant* free speech because of the name attached to them. That is *criminally* disgusting and you should be ashamed of yourself. 
---
One of the many things people fought and died for in that war was liberties like the one you are trying to tread on. Try to roll that one around in your head for a fucking moment. There are people who would stand on the fucking barricades to defend the right to say something you're trying to censor.
---
How fucking wrong do you have to be for that to happen?
---
&gt;Who is pathetic? The one who says: "In my opinion something is wrong here" or the one who uses words like "fucking retard", "waste of time" or "little bitch" in his answer?
---
It's the one trying to bring down the GMs on someone over a perfectly harmless and relevant quote, because you're too much of a pathetic bitch to handle a reminder of *your own damn history*. 
---
Censorship is so serious, it's so *heinous* on the most fundamental level, that when you start trying to bring it about you need to be *damn* sure you have one hell of a good reason. 
---
You don't. You don't even get anywhere near close. That is why you're getting hostile responses, because you're the one in the *severe* wrong here. 
---
The nice little cherry on top is that you didn't even go "In my opinion something is wrong here.". You used the harmless quote in an individual's bio to *shit on an entire group of people*.

"capitals push out every single subcap out of the small scale meta"
---
bombers own caps like its their job when fielded in numbers, and small groups shouldn't be able to kill a cap easily.
---
  
---
"jaguars make 80% of subs unviable if you can somehow find fights without caps."
---
frigates need work, but plenty of things can kill jags  
---
Feroxes, munnins, bombers, ares, canes, ishtars, jackdaws, cerbs, megas, apocs, there are plenty of options out, but certain people go back to the same ship every time because they know it and they like it.
---
Literally everyone is better than horde lmao. Even highsec pubbies are better than horde.
---
It wasn't intended for use on battleships given the way it works. Using  a heavy scram on a BS is like using a large rep on a cruiser you sacrifice to make it fit because the mod size wasn't designed for that class.
---
He never said he makes money off goons. He makes money off his website, themanatee.com, which wouldn't get any more traffic if Eve was dead

---
I'm sorry, were those your excavators?
---
They've done this many times before, the slot goes red and the module is invalid, its literally that simple, why do people make shit up for no reason. 
---
Yes, my point is: Why have a redundant option available to the player if it's just a noob trap?
---
Online search for 'eve online seat' gave me this:

Hey just curious, whos your main character? 
---
Are you interested in the null sec life? I would recommend Dreddit. It's the main corp of TEST Alliance Please ignore.
---
We offer a good mentorship program to get people up to speed. It's a larger corp the chances are good that there is somebody online at any given time.
---
If you are interested then have a look: [https://dredditisrecruiting.com/](https://dredditisrecruiting.com/)
---
Thanks, I did try googling a few different terms but didn’t think to google eve online with it. My googlefu is not strong.
---
Hypothetical... Please, the point is still valid. Someone had to code a system around contingencies with database changes... Saying you can just go in and change whatever you want without a coder being involved is still wrong even if my hypothetical example isn't accurate.
---
Wow super cool!!
---
&gt;small scale meta
---
&gt;when fielded in numbers
---
:thinking:
---
Unlike most people who play this game. I've been and still am a freighter pilot and also have done ganking. So I've been on both sides of the fence. Making the game more safe for people, is not really what Eve is about. High security space, is simply there are repercussions if you gank. In low and null security space, it gets progressively less severe by the authorities. None of the security systems prevent crimes being done in the first place. It does make for a unique kind of game and not everyone is geared up emotionally for Eve. The stakes are a little bit higher than most games which have very little consequences if you die. In Eve, you lose your stuff.   
---
I remember one game I played, years back and on that server: If you died, it was permanent death for your character (and by extension, gear). Eve thankfully isn't anywhere near as harsh. If you'd like a safer system than Eve, there's plenty of other systems out there (Halo, etc) that may suit. Eve has always been a tough environment game with few rules. As a shipper, you're facing all the consequences and risk and get paid to deliver (not very much I feel). Unlike the real world, you can't insure the collateral on your cargo. If the real world was like Eve, no cargo would ever get shipped.  
---
I feel that's a shame. There should be room for gear insurance in Eve for shipping contracts and the trader/client should be the one whom pays it. In the meantime, Goonswarm will continue to punch downwards on highsec rich end monopolies who seem to have deals done with PanFam.
---
[https://github.com/eveseat/seat](https://github.com/eveseat/seat)
---
But...ive seen it happen, its perfectly readable, you can just remove the module, its not lost to the abyss. 
---
At "worse" they've already done the work, and now it just works, so whats the problem? 
---
Do you really think they need a coder to modify ship parameters? I'm really curious. 
---
I don't think augmented drones see that much use in fleet fights. 
---
Then again, i don't see what use the killmails would have.
---
Fuck you, I'm no Goon.
---
But the drones are worth more...
---
meh i've unsubed 3 of my 4 accounts i dont think i will re sub them
---
Check out Sniggerdly, they are the biggest and main corp in Pandemic Legion, an alliance holding sov up north. Easy logistics to Jita, tons of spod to mine, and a pretty decent super umbrella to help protect you. They do require you to be active in PvP though, but its usually some F1 mashing in muninns for like an hour, and then you can get back to chewing rocks. 
---
&gt;Unsure if this is bait but you realise balance changes have to be well thought out, discussed and tested over time.
---
Is this where we pretend CCP actually does this?   That they *haven't* left game-breaking mechanics in the game for years due to not having a proper balance team?  Or that a large percentage of the changes they've made in recent times haven't been harmful to the game due to lack of testing?  That, say, rorqs haven't been broken in every way (both economically and in combat) since release, or that fighters haven't rendered most of the ships in the game obsolete?  What a nice fairy tale world that must be.
---
How long do you think CCP tested one of the recent walk-backs, the Retribution speed nerf?  I'm sure they had a whole team - all well versed in not only EVE mechanics but also the pvp meta - working for weeks until they finally settled on making the ship have nearly the exact same effectiveness when flown with snakes + drugs, yet significantly less without (RIP poors).
---
Or maybe they simply changed a value in the database in hopes of appeasing a large section of the playerbase.
---
This discussion isn't just about ship parameters. It's about making database changes in general without input from all parties effected. From the coders to the guys in support who are going to have to deal with the salt. I'm not saying that CCP is doing what they should but condensing an issue that has broad reaching gameplay and community effects to just a simple database change is a very blinkered view.
---
Hold up. Plex is 2 BILLLION isk now!?

Holy fuck when I quit it was just hitting 700m. Christ ccp

Lol a random Avatar just warped onto grid and started shooting. Redline - "Big shiny" 
---
I must agree that plex prices are insane at the moment. But I guess it only reflects the demand for it. A plex sale would be a short term solution but without having them on a regular basis I don’t see it having much of an effect going forward.
---
So the guys that just killed 50 excavs are bots... yeah, right.
---
You sound like a salty goon to me
---
Do you think changing the rate of fire on a ship has a drastic effect with fallout that needs multiple coders to deal with?
---
eyy guess what if you skillfarm your chars it's 0 isk per month per account
---
Do you think changing the rate if fire on a ship will fix all the balance issues?
---
Capitals do what they should in the meta sense for small scale: it brings the engagement to a close.
---
Small gangs often (read: almost always) cannot break a capital dropped on them. I think the balancing point here would be to ensure that the capital isn't able to quickly kill off the small gang either.
---
Small gangs break the engagement by fleeing or out-tracking - these should remain viable options (so light fighters need a nerf, and haw tracking to a certain extent, but I'm hesitant to nerf them too much since while it will effect titans, the primary victim will be dreads, which is already a punished class looking for a new identity in this era of damage caps.

And this is just the stuff that is in the news (and I found within 3 mins). So, if you are somehow missing out of content, I kinda think it's your fault.
---
killing caps isn't small scale given the direction caps have taken over the years in eve this is pretty obvious.
---
until there is somebody who is able to pay that much for plex the prices will stay up 
---
what is an overview? 
---
Its not, its intended for people who know what they are doing to use it as a tackle option when engaging supers and titans. What are they supposed to do put a disclaimer in the market screen to tell new players to not waste their time??
---
I think a number of those types of changes will go a long way to improving balance in Eve yes. 
---
I think I got it- the cube is effectively the intersection of the probes' current location in the system. You move the cube (i.e. the probes) around to explore the system. To be honest I think I was sort of mixing up d-scan with the probe scanner, which *is* limited to 14au around the ship.
---
I dont think so fir the jf. 
---
JF are being killed to the way to the hub, not to the way to LS because they jumped. Jf can jumped instantly just when they go outside jita 44 in the invul timer
---
If you check plex prices, the price regularly is corrected with the sale.
---
The issue this time around is the Valentine's sale happened at a time when there was incredible apathy and dissatisfaction in the player base, and so that probably reflected in the amount of people purchasing their PLEX packages.
---
Hopefully if CCP iterates content that is received more positively by the playerbase, you should see a better correction during the next sale.
---
caps killing any solo/small-gang content instantly cause swiss army knife grid-control
---
No just unlike you i acctually know what im talking about
---
Adding these to my list for when I visit Australia. A Salty Golden Gaytime sounds good!
---
sorry that not everyone else is interested in getting their content spoon fed in 50v50/100v100 F1 contests... did you even read what the guy before you posted?
---
What a good jokes , thanks ;)
---
o\ ...
---
To many people from Chinese server moved in with bots ... to many US/EU players left that bought PLEX from CCP. 
---
&gt; and have done a bit of PVE but don't really understand what doing missions means in the bigger picture of standings and stuff.
---
There is no bigger picture, missions are just there to grind isk.
---
&gt;  I tried PVP and failed quite hilariously
---
That's the point of PvP. You failed, learn all you can from your failing, and try again. At some point you will fail less than the other dudes.
---
Not just that but you arent gonna budge people with a 10% discount. 
---
A number of them... I can tell you how it probably go. They make all the balance changes requested on the test server. The people will test it and the vocal minority who get negatively affected by the change will spew salt all over everything and the changes never make it to TQ. The negatively impacted are always the loudest. So how would you suggest they deal with that? Ignore the people making the noise or bring in changes sparingly and over a period of time? Depends on who you listen to CCP are already doing one or the other.
---
i have been playing that game for over 10+ years and only lost interest recently because of the stale and absolutely punishing meta for subcaps.
---
rock paper scissors can be fun forever if you keep changing the numbers
---
Basically caps should be able to "fight" sub caps but not dominant sub caps. There advance should be there higher survival chances not there damage they can bring down on them.
---
Huh TIL that Wall's is actually the regional name of Heartbrand icecream, which is called Streets in Australia.
---
And here I was about to make a Wall's Streets joke :(
---
Is anyone really surprised?
---
Decreased faith in the future of the game = more players refusing to pay for the game and just using the wealth they have in game to get a bit more playtime.
---
If CCP announced a deep PLEX sale tomorrow, would you buy any for real cash? I'm done spending on the game in its current state, but I do have almost a trillion in assets.
---
I'm sure if you're a krab with very little knowledge of game mechanics, it *would* seem super scary to change anything.
---
But in reality, these things aren't actually that catastrophic.  You can go into pyfa right now and mess with override values and get a good glimpse into what is possible.  If you have it, you can use your years of pvp experience to gauge how those numbers would affect things in the game world.
---
If you've theorycrafted and run numbers as extensively as is done for AT, it becomes even easier.  At this point simply reading off the raw stat-line for a fitted ship has significant meaning, and changing a single value could be all it needs to become a viable option.  *(Is it wrong to hope that someone left at CCP has even a hint of this kind of game knowledge?)*
---
As much as you may want to give CCP some bullshit cop-out excuse for not updating the game, the real reason they don't simply change more numbers around is because they're far more concerned about earning that $ than they are about EVE having a vibrant pvp meta.  Why spend developer time on balance changes when shiny new features and skins are what really keeps the whales subbed for another few months?
---
you must be new here
---
Fairly, yes. Love the game though wormholer for life. Pity people on Reddit can be so dismissive.
---
o7 fly safe
---
eve is not for everyone
---
Plex was changed it used to be a single item used solely for sub cost now it got split into 500 units of plex per month sub because its a also used for skins and extractors in a new “aurum shop” plex replaced aurum 
---
Heres the thing. Bots have always been here. Its just easier now. They were able to stop the supers for a bit with fighter changes. 
---
But now we have rorqs. 
---
Your first skills go to a rorq if you want to even compete with anyone. 
---
Shit you probably dont even need to know how to code to make a rorq and vni bot.
---
Remove the option on battleships or make it generally more viable for battleships like I've suggested... CCP clearly thought "lets give it more range to make the upgrade generally more worthwhile" who are you to put the yardstick of that at +1km tops? The bonus to range is underwhelming. Also, CCP could have introduced it at +10km and you'd still defend CCP even when, compared to how it is now, that would be busted. 
---
You're opposing this arbitrary change that would make a module more viable, creating more fit options for players. Choice is good..
---
The multi pilot training certificate has seen a meteoric rise recently as well... I don't know why and it makes me sad because I've been trying to save for one but it's inflated faster than my income has.
---
I get that you guys are grring gons etc but themittani.com closed down 2+ years ago?
---
So again, please tell me how Mittani make a living off eve or goons?
---
I don't care one way or the other but if you're gonna publicly grr gons there's plenty of things to criticize about us that are actually true, there's no need to make things up.
---
The problem with the test server is it's not got the same environment as live so one thing could look good on the test server then fail or be op on the live. Kinda how the chat server went. I seen no problems with it on test. but put it on live and you hit unseen problems.
---
You're a developer. You should know better than to do cowboy deployments, which is exactly the type of balance you're asking CCP to do.
---
Yes. but mostly because they established a trend of 15% sales, so that is what customers are used to, and what people will usually wait for.
---
I'm not saying the blog isn't dumb, I think it is, but there's precedent for this (e.g. dictors losing their second bubble)
---
Oh okay. That makes more sense then. Thanks
---
Suscribe stop being poor.
---
I think he meant the deployment in Hakonen.
---
https://imperium.news
---
You say tomato I say tomato
---
If all it takes are caps to bring any small scale engagement to a close, the game will become stale very quickly (and it has).
---
Given that the mindset of most sov null alliances toward roaming gangs and fleets is 'fuck off out of our space so we can continue mining/ratting in peace', allowing capital superiority to completely shut engagements down outright kills a good portion of the spontaneous pvp left in this game.
---
True, but that's where all the incentives of organized testing days should come to play.  They don't have to throw over several million SP every time they want to try a balance change and get a percent of the player base over, but they could incentivize frequent testers with merits on Singularity (whatever rewards they want to decide on).  That way they can have more frequent mid-to-large-scale test groups to work balance numbers over with.  It would help CCP immensely if they and the playerbase collaborated together for theory-crafting so that those unseen problems have a large chance to be predicted before putting an update live.
---
Spot-on brother
---
From what i last checked 3-4 big skill farmers translate to over 1500 accounts that use plex monthly - there is plenty of people with 10-20 omega accounts only as they don't cost much if you extract them.        
---
Without thinking what they do with them ... after like 5th omega account you already have the KNOW HOW what to do to keep account in omega state for no additional cost and quite probably some profit. 
---
It has more disruption points than a regular scram. Only really useful to tackle supers and Titans, which habe double digits warp core strength. 
---
&gt;Stop making skill farm alts, or stop fiften boxing rorqs
---
You first. And by you i mean everybody who does it. 
---
wasn't the last good sale 25%

I’d lose the frieghter too. I kinda like how my flavor of frieghter has the least losses this weekend, but damn you’re not going to see me doing it. 
---
lol.
---
I mean he does run B4R
---
I don't remember the name of the trader doing it, but a time ago a big PLEX trader made a reddit thread explaining if plex were rising it was only because some trader were controlling the market and make the price rise, if anyone less lazy than I have it saved somewhere or something really think it could be interesting to break the narrative reddit try to push

Sister BlissToday at 9:48 PM @everyone While we are on campaign, can everyone stop doing dumb shit. I don't care if you can afford it, my Yamaha Sports Heart cannot.

8D chess?

yes, i'm sure Volta cares about NC. sov
---
Agreed but also, Test will never Failscade, We have to many members who care about who we are and what we stand for to let anyone Hit the Delete key on us!
---
I see people bringing up "Ohh x corp left the alliance" and "oh u fucked over that dude" literally not knowing wtf they are saying only spewing out roomers they here without the full story..... Test will not failscade even now as we are fighting outmatched numbers we are still doing what we need to do.
---
I like to look at things from a surprising perspective, A Sl1DE/Skillu perspective.... If 99% of a corp can be afk in an alliance the size of Skillu literally making them outnumberd worse then we are now and they are still in game. Seriously Test has fuck all to worry about.
---
Now get back to your mining you cheeky shit's
---
Reading through the answers, there has been good advice given. What sticks out is:
---
* Ask the guys that killed you what you could have done better
---
* Pulse D-Scan 
---
* Use Local Chat in lowsec/nullsec
---
Overall it is about experience and situational awareness. If you are uncertain how to behave in a certain situation, use maximum caution, e.g.: An neutral enters your local chat - bail to a save/dock up. The more experience you get the more you will be able to behave according to your situation (e.g.: combat probes are out but I am in a gated complex and the hunter is a known cyno hunter that does not bare any guns). Eve is a game of constant PvP afterall, so be aware that if you are out there ratting, people will come and try to kill you.   
---
Additional advise (rather to ratting itself): It has already been said but ratting gatted complexes is usually saver. Therefore you might want to go for gated sites that give you a certain reaction time.  Also there are websites that provide info about the possible outcome of the sites you scanned down. For the most part the possible escalations of the sites net you the wealth you are striving for. Train into a T3 (Tengu/Loki) with the according weapon systems.

If you like the thrill, then this will be for you else you can still go the easy route and simply join a nullsec alliance and cycle your VNI (worst case 10m every 20mins). With intel channels in place you only have to know your surrounding systems and go dock up when a baddy comes too close. But since you already started out on your own you might wanna stick to it - it is more fun.   
---
Good luck on your future endeavours, capsuleer!

fly save  
---
No shit Sherlock.

You really think 2b is bad? Considering the amount of ISK that has being generated, the amount of (Rorqual) alts created that needed to be plexed over the past year alone, it's a surprise it didn't hit that mark sooner.
---
When it gets to 4 or 5, that'll be the time to start worrying.
---

No individual has that wealth in EVE.

if u think bots, and not ccp decisions are rising up the price of plex ur braindead

Did you just literally upload a video you multi-broadcasting at the same time on all 4? ...am i...am i seeing something different?

Imagine using a fishing boat against an aircraft carrier and wondering why your fishing boat got wrecked...
---
Yeah I wouldn’t mind going to null sec but wouldn’t do it alone lol. I’ll have a look at joining, thank you :) 
---
nope
---
That of course depends on the skill injector current value, the multiple char training mkt value and the plex value. Last time I checked plex prices were lower and still skill farming per sè netted a loss, that is not counting PI, industry slots, etc you gain by having a 3 toons account.
---
No glue of anything

Create  steam accout, Set steam region to Africa or S.America and everyday is a steam sale. Peru is like $4 per month, how much cheaper do you want?
---
Bots have fucked it up.
---
And a reducing loyal player base.
---
&gt;  some trader were controlling the market 
---
they are a little group who control the market to an high end. If you want a proof, check the market and check if there is multiple order with 2k+ plex order, if you buy one of each, oh it's weird 2/3 guy control thousand and thousand of plex at the same time huuuum

New players should just stop being poor, 2b is not so much at all.

He kills citadels that are unfit in that system. We just happened to notice.

oh ok

don't but at mission hubs - go fly to your nearest trade hub.
---
You know multi boxing like that is against the EULA right?
---
This post is literally asking to be banned
---
There arent that many bots. Bots just need to rat 8hr/day and earn 3-400mil/day or mine 16 hours. Multiply it by month and it is 12-24b. If there were that many bots as you think there are...    Bots just do these things for longer time than average player and so you might see more of them.
---
Really?
---
&gt; ccp does a good job to make active mechanics when they overhaul or make new ships. (booshers, active aoe neut of citadels, ADCs, etc) active mechanics give players more opportunity to fight with and against something, instead of just "take it or leave it"
---
Are you drunk mate ?
---
There are plenty of people with a stockpile of a few years' worth of PLEX. That is very different to controlling the PLEX market.
---
There's only about two trillion ISK worth of PLEX listed on the market right now but there are hundreds of trillions worth in existence. 
---
Plenty of people have 2 trillion ISK. Noone has even 100 trillion.
---
They're used for injector farms, because mtcs are cheaper than plexes its cheaper to plex an account and mtc the other two characters and extract all three than it is to plex three accounts. 
---
As injectors go up in price then an sp farm can support higher prices for mtcs which will cause them to go up in price.
---
What the hell was that even about? 
---
Imagine playing a game for fun
---
lol, one of the reasons for current plex price complaining about plex price. Literally exactly what i predicted. I should sell my predictions, i tend to be right ...
---
Also the valentines plex sale was close to a jita scam, as the advertised 10% discount were fake
---
Wts 8 rorqs and toons, pp only 
---
you always purchase from the cheapest order listed, if you select a more expensive order, you pay more to the guy with the cheapest order
---
&gt;bombers own caps like its their job when fielded in numbers, and small groups shouldn't be able to kill a cap easily.

Just bring 100 dudes every time you want to undock isn't valid counterplay.

---
Just fly orthrus/jackdaw with rapier support exclusively isn't reasonable.
---
Galaxy packs were usually 30-60% off.
---
You were getting 3 months sub, 5 or 10 extractors, 1 MCT and 1100 Plex. All for the cost of the 3 month sub.
---
People were literally creating throwaway accounts and throwing that 3 month sub away because everything was such a good deal, or people were keeping the 3month sub and spinning up so farms
---
when the kwg botmaker quit developing his bot, the price of plex dropped by almost 10% in one month :sun:
---
no, the octaboxers aren't to blame. ccp is to blame because they did this shit knowingly. this is the consequence of the past 3 years of changes that promote safety and krabbing. get more alts, get more rorquals, buy more subs and more extractors. give us more money now, fuck the future we're selling to pa anyway lol. no m8, the players aren't to blame here, they'll keep doing it as long as they're allowed to and any other players in any other mmo would do the same. it's too late now anyway, the prices are only going to go up and we're nowhere near close to the boiling point. it's gonna get to over 3b easily. they might try to patch it up with sales but really it's just band aid. all those alts need to stay subbed and they're not gonna have sales forever.
---
There is a visible delay between the activation of modules and the single windows pop up separately. This can easily be set up with EVE-O and good shortcut selection ingame.

Nah dude he was just hotkeying and clicking realy fast

I'll bite your shitty bait

&gt;stop playing the game optimally and they way ccp intended for you to sink money into the game
---
yeah i was watching it thinking...wait..wait..no..what..wait... :) lol but fleet warp.. so yeah stand corrected.
---
roomers
---
Capitals shouldn't be the standard response to small scale subcaps either. People don't go out hunting caps with their small scale gang, but caps go out hunting their small scale gang. The end result is anyone who enjoys subcap PVP just leaving the game.
---
how do you do this? never worked for me, always got a "fuck off you don't live in russia" when I tried to get good deals with russian robux once upon a time
---
RL "mechanics" is basically an antithesis of what you expect to see in a fun game, and balance is the antithesis of what you should be trying to achieve in RL conflict involving yourself.
---
So, I have no idea why this is being brought up every time someone starts a discussion on EVE ship meta.
---
Well, here you have your answer:    
---
https://i.imgur.com/TUEbTnz.jpg (credit to adam4eve.eu)    
---
The number of plex sellorders is in rapid decline since June 2018 - that means, less people are buying plex to put in into the market.     
---
Maybe that is related to the fact that you don't need to convert plex to isk anymore when everybody just can earn tons of it with supers and rorquals?    
---
(That is called inflation. Welcome to Serenity light)
---
Let the triggering commence.  
---
The problem with you lot is you want everything for nothing.  Did you really expect Plex prices to remain the same? Natural inflation within the game will only increase prices further.  The threat of unsubbing accounts because the price is now circa 2bill is petty frankly, what happens when prices hit 2.4 or 3bill?
---
Here's an idea, stop bitching and put in the effort to make some isk if you want to play the game for "free".  Otherwise work a bit harder in real life and put that hard earned cash towards something most of us actually enjoy.
---
TLDR: stfu, undock and make some isk!
---
If that is indeed the case then hats off. There was some timing difference but when I looked closely im sure top left and top right went red on cloaks at exactly the same time.
---
Is there a shortcut to fleet warp?
---
Not really. It will always go up because there are some people that will not pay money for their accouts whatever happens, these will either buy or their accounts will expire. There is a lot of room for the price to increase. Plex could be 5 or even 10 bil at the moment and people would still buy it because "I'm playing for free! Yaaay!" or "I'm not paying a dime for this shit game!". Sure, there would be less buyers but as long as there is way to earn money ingame to buy game time, this will always be the case. Never mind putting in tens of hours of work into just getting the account subbed. Now, you might say this would be outrageous, that this would be like getting a second job etc. but this is nothing new and CCP has been heading in this direction since forever, it's just that the players who already left 1-2-5 years ago, had even less tolerance to grinding than the today's players.
---
Want an advice on how to make Eve more enjoyable? Pay for it. Sub it on steam or even use a normal, CCP sub. Eve isn't worth the amount of time you need to grind ISK for gametime.
---
Same, had 6 accounts subbed, unsubbed 4 of them. Not dealing with that bullshit anymore.
---
&gt;I'm defending the right to use a non offensive Hitler quote.
---
"Choose your battles wisely. After all, life isn't measured by how many times you stood up to fight. It's not winning battles that makes you happy, but it's how many times you turned away and chose to look into a better direction. Life is too short to spend it on warring." - Adolf Hitler
---
Man dude, if ever there was a smoothest brain, you sure would win it for literally not thinking about what can defend against bombs.
---
demand is high, so cost is kept high, the more it lowers, the more people with lots of liquid will buy it up and store it.
---
it is like bitcoin, uncontrollable costing, either pay for your account with IRL money, or multibox to the stage you can afford the plex, others can as theyre buying and pushing the price up.
---
But the point you need to take away, is 1 month of game time has more than doubled in ISK cost since you quit.
---
Not just that but doing it repeadtly over the course of a weekend really ranks your security status so get to -2.0 and faction police spawn as well as your a criminal in 1.0 systems like around jita.  Obviously we go lower then that with constant ganking. 
---
Currently you earn 88 million per month per account (all 3 chars are farming) under perfect conditions.    
---
So, no way to plex your Main with that.
---
Yeah. Or it might just as well be CCP's fault for doing such a retarded thing as Rorquals. Why always blame people ? If devs make crappy mechanics or gameplays that allow people to go full retard, they are going to take it, because it's human nature... 
---
A firesale is not the only solution. Asset safety can recover the stuff to the nearest low-sec NPC station and freight services like Red Frog or PushX have access to surprisingly many places.
---
I assume both, also CCP decision is to allow such extended usage of of PLEX.        
---
To give you some perspective. 1000 accounts in skill farms ( and there is waaaaaaaaay waaaaaaaaaaaaay mor of them) is not 500 plex per each account - but in order for them to be profitable all 3 characters on each account need to be training.        
---
Multicharacter training is cheaper than sub - but it is still insane amounts of Plex used.             
---
I alwasy stated this.        
---
As a player i prefer 40 players PLEXing and running around than a single player running 40 accounts - simply as there is more stuff moving around.            
---
For CCP it does not matter and tbh this 1 guy with 40 accounts is better for CCP as costs are lower. (but i hope that they don't look it at this way).      
---
&gt;just because something is underused, it doesn't necessarily needs a buff to be viable (non-invented-bias)
---
And just because what you say is reasonable, it doesn't necessarily mean ship diversity is in a good place.
---
Blanket statements might get you a lot of upvotes, but they don't actually tell us anything about EVE's game balance.
---
&gt;"fast" nerf reactions tend to break things completely
---
"Fast" nerf reactions aren't something CCP does very often, but they have happened (most recently with the Retribution changes), and I can't think of any examples of them doing it and completely breaking the game.
---
In fact, they're far more likely to break the game with new additions to the game, and then simply leave them around until enough people complain for long enough to get them fixed.  Things like war dec mechanics, off-grid links, void bombs, fozzieclaws, etc.
---
Better yet, the fixes they eventually implement are generally easy changes that they could have made years before had they actually been motivated to do so.
---
&gt;planning/investment, if something is strong, many players are investing in it. if you overnerf stuff at this point, you alianate alot of players
---
This is a cop-out that basically means CCP never has to change any 'big investment' ships, no matter how broken they might be.
---
With this kind of design logic, it's no surprise that game mechanics continue to benefit players with big ships in safe space.  Instead of alienating the whales, alienate single-account non-injected players roaming around looking for organic pvp.
---
&gt;ccp does a good job to make active mechanics when they overhaul or make new ships. (booshers, active aoe neut of citadels, ADCs, etc) active mechanics give players more opportunity to fight with and against something, instead of just "take it or leave it"
---
These examples are very poor, especially in regards to counterplay.
---
Single booshers can be scrammed, but chain booshing does not allow for the same opportunity.  This had led not just to spearfishing tactics, but to long-range fleets that can never actually be caught.  So much for more opportunity to "fight... against something".
---
Meanwhile, aoe citadel neuts were a response to how badly they fucked up with void bombs, which limited the meta in extreme (and predictable) ways for a long time.  After having had to deal with citadels with void bombs, giving CCP the benefit of the doubt on this one is a joke.  There's no reason this change couldn't have happened a year earlier than it did.
---
As for ADCs, they're very one-sided.  Theoretically you can neut the AF to ensure they can't use it, but all this does is restrict you to always having long-range neuts available.  And in those cases, you'll often shut off their mwd early enough that the ADC doesn't matter anyway.
---
The real threat from ADCs comes from the Jaguar, which has capless tank and usually a nos to keep tackle.  Once it's on you, utility neuts don't do all that much.  In practice, rather than allowing for counterplay, the ADC has actually eliminated a lot of it by allowing pilots to simply q-click, overheat, and activate ADC to get on something and tackle it.
---
It's when you have Micro Jump Field Generator versus 425mm Railgun.
---
underrated comment
---
so you comparing riot, who "balances" (yeah we can discuss that) their chars on every patch they're releasing and CCP who does half balance every year and a half ? 
---
Balance is what makes a game alive, fixed traits/stats are all but a good solution. Do you want to play the same ship over and over again with absolutely no changes whatsoever ? I certainly don't.
---
That is the whole problem - **you need to do it** if you want to compete with others on this high level.         
---
What we need is upper level or how many accounts each player can be running /owning  - but we will never have this as from financial perspective it will be bad for CCP. 
---
Wait, what?
---
Literally no one said init will failscade.
---
Now go back to mining spod.
---
Jesus christ you people are so fucking execrable, it's unbelievable. 
---
i guess eve will soon become bots fighting bots, to overtake other bots area so they have mroe room to farm and place more bots to farm to be able to kill more bots. eve will become a 0player 100% bot world. the robots are comming and theyre winning!!!
---
When you quit there wasn't easily multi boxable Rorquals that earn 150m per/hour each, or Carriers that earn high-end incursion payouts solo, or 300m+ hour Super ratting. VNIs are also to easy multibox at 50m+ per hour while doing other tasks. 1 months gametime has always sat around 20-30 hours of the average line members income. That income has jumped vastly since the citadel expansion, where capital ratting and mining are now the dominant sources of isk generation, and they are incredibly safe if you have a brain under an alliances capital umbrella.   
---
4 years ago the average line member earned about 60-80m/hour running anoms.   
---
Skill Farming also puts a huge amount of pressure on PLEX price. 
---
R u trol?
---
I believe the real issue is inflation, the isk taps are open so far that users who  buy plex with USD don't feel its worth the as fewer ISK as you do. 
---
Trust me - you need like 20-30T to control plex price around jita.     
---
You can easily gather &lt;10 player group to do it.        
---
Like you cannot lose ISK at it at any point.
---
Highsec
---
Top notch bait. 
---
Seen just before DT, but nothing on zkillboard yet... maybe they here just for a birthday of one of them ?
---
If the PLEX price keep going up it's less and less valuable to multibox 10 characters ...
---
You have it! Even 2 of them.          
---
First is **Login button** you click to connect to New Eden.         
---
2nd one is **undock** button that you have in NPC station.         
---
Ofc, its not, but firesales are usually the best option. Since asset safety costs quite a bit and getting stuff out of that lowsec station to somewhere else will also be costly.
---
Have you tried using a vpn?
---
You can roam lowsec in an unfit frigate looting random wrecks and make 10-20x that in an hour and with how dead most of lowsec is the odds are against you getting caught. I understand if L1's are done for enjoyment but in the end it is absolutely dogshit money. 
---
Like ccp give a shit about it , yes he used some way to use 4 accs same time 
---
Bad bait.
---
as i said  until there is somebody who is able to pay that much for plex the prices will stay up 
---
vote with your isk, if everybody stops buying plex at all the prices will fall, but thats impossible 
---
same thing happens IRL with tabletop miniatures from games workshop, as long as somebody can pay for that the prices continue to rise up 
---
&gt; How many new people are we gonna recruit with the "hey if you can pay per month with in game cash"
---
No one, it's retarded to do that anyway, no new player should have to grind even 1bil to get to then be able to play the game. That's what alpha is for.
---
Zkillboard don't show all ship kills - only those that players upload there.     
---
Many players don't put any thing on zkillboard just for the reason no one can see what they kill and where ... and on the other side ... so no one can see what they lose. 
---
Imagine loading the said fishing boat with high tech weapons. It may not be able to sink the carrier outright, but it may cripple the thing without escorts.
---
In that sense, the gunships from tv series "The Expanse" provide a pretty good example.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/75383404/
---
Only works for subs through Steam. PLEX is roughly the same price in every region.
---
Yes, but if you break the game, sometimes it doesn't fix itself afterwards.
---
yea but it will still be worth it over paying $150/month for them. someone with a few rorqs can pay 30b a month instead of 20b no problem. eventually it will be too much even for them but that point is still pretty far away.
---
You mean every random retard at leddit screeching dosent know better than CCP?
---
You lose about 90 million ISK right now if you extract and sell to keep your main character subbed. 90m/month is fairly easy to do though. 
---
It's all fun and games until a unlimitedly powerful NPC organization whelps your Titan/super fleet.
---
what kind of stupid fucking logic is that, "hey  instead of this ship that can jump out if trouble shows itself in highsec ima use this fucking ship that cant do shit if it starts getting bumped.
---
Yeah honestly there needs to be a cap at 3. I'd say 2 but I give +1 for so many people who enjoy the multibox play style.
---
Loll but its a CAPITAL SHIP /s
---
It still amazes me how people hang on CCP's nuts when they consistently show they don't care and/or are incompetent.  The glacial pace they make balance changes, and the pathetic amount of changes they do make when this happens, would not be acceptable in ANY other mmo.  It's amazing so many people actually defend it, I guess it's no wonder EVE is in such a sad state.
---
flat wrong, but ok. Untill i quit i was running perfectly fine over the entire past year going to jita with many JF daily. Next.
---
the chat server was horribly broken on the test server too fwiw, they pushed it anyways.
---
or just use scouts, not hard.
---
scouting is hard.
---
9-13?
---
I was on CSM 9, CSM 10, CSM 11, CSM 12, and currently on CSM 13.
---
I'm currently leaning towards running for CSM 14, as people are suggesting it's a good idea.
---
Which in and of itself would be a good thing, but it seems things have gone way too far. 
---
Everything in moderation.
---
when burn jita first happened frieghters were like 300 mill. So please tell me how its cheaper now. Then go look at then and now jf prices.
---
If you're in to that kind of thing, guy.  Good thing is you're in the right place for that.
---
Go to Omist, Cobalt Edge and Outer Passage and see the same number of VNI's and salvaging Cormorants with repeating name schemes in every single system that are all sitting in the same POS the second you jump in and then tell me if there's not a bot problem. I understand that with third party intel tools there's a lot of false positives because people know there's a gang 10 jumps before it gets to them, but then there's blatant bot activity which is not hard to spot once you know the signs.
---
Honestly not sure. I was actualy just kidding around but i do know that my mouse has a setting that lets me quick switch windows and i use that for my multiboxing. For example i spam it 4 times while spamming d to get all my accounts to warp or f2/3 to turn on cloaks
---
You must be new to MMOs.. there's always somebody who multiboxes harder and there's always somebody who plays 26 hours a day and leaves you in the dust.   
---
You really don't need to compete with nolifers and dudes who can only get it up if they're multiboxing 38 rorqs at the same time
---
So the solution is to not touch anything and then add new "OH SHINY" mechanics that break it even further?  I want some of whatever you fanboys are smoking...
---
I am new to the game, so \o/ 
---
Going up 1bil in price is still 8/9h of mining to get for a rorqual. It is still costing them something.
---
Oh, so it's kinda like years you've been a CSM?
---
thats what actually paying to play a game is for
---
I really want to read them but I doubt we won't see them before a week bare minimum just for redacting, and probably not before a month.
---
 Everyone want plex, that s why it goes so up and on the long term it will go up and up and up. In 2 years if EVe it still on plex will be more than 3b for sure
---
How would you find random wrecks in a “dead lowsec”? Legit question, I never tried doing that.
---
Exploration also yields a lot more ISK. 
---
But missions yield Loyalty Points and Standings as well. And it’s a fun way to get to know more about the game mechanics, for example being dampened/scrambled in a safe environment and with time to read the effects without exploding in 10 seconds from a random encounter in lowsec.
---
I am very new to the game so missioning has been a fun way to understand it more. Now I am seeing the damage types I am receiving and trying to fit for that. Lots of fun. 😁

You know that the whole benefit of skill farms is that you exactly don't have to do things you say?         
---
So lets assume that you do 50 account skill farm.          
---
You drop in same skill queue in them -&gt; 3 month long ... just by this you are getting at least 500mil/month per account of profit (more it you plan it better).         
---
This requires you to login to those accounts once per 3 months and this give you 25bil monthly income.           
---
Now if you do something more on those accounts your income is increasing  ... like :         
---
* PI, you know the lazy one a week long extraction that you sell            
---
* BPC ... copying is worthless today due to this ... as you know you can just setup a 30day job            
---
* same of above but in terms of invention ...                   
---
* production -&gt; if those chars are sitting then put them in same corp and drop all industry jobs on the corp that you need ... when you need                   
---
Whole benefit of skill farms is that you don't need to multi box any thing. 
---
   
---
Yes, some regions are a problem, I have met a 20 ishtar most likely botting fleet spreaded across anonalies. Human wouldnt be able to do that.

Remember not only vnis are bots.

Minutes from the last CSM summit were published about a month after the meetings (https://www.eveonline.com/article/pfznqe/the-csm-13-winter-summit-minutes). Soooo, expect similar(-ish)?

Then go in Delve and try yourself getting in there with enough people to kill rorquals ? There is a reason why people don't do it.

WTF do not steal my ideas. https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/au9vh0/filter_local/eh6mn21/

Gee, man, how about a more equitable solution? 
---
no.
---
"vote with your isk, if everybody stops buying plex from the market at all the prices will fall, but thats impossible because allways somebody will buy"
---
There is no "voting with your isk". The price will continue to increase because there is no alternative for the people who want free omega (it's not really free but that's a different matter). The only thing here is what happens to a particular player when he/she is past that plex price acceptability threshold. The person will either "break" and start paying or will quit the game. 
---
Incursion running in highsec is still relatively fast and hasn't changed that much. Actually - highsec incursions are more accessible now, since alphas can fly battleships and meta guns. But I agree on the capitals/rorquals stuff.
---
3 accounts owned or 3 logged in simultanously? Because if it's 3 at a time, it could maybe work (hurts a lot keeping eyes, cynos or other low attention high value alts online) but would be huge hit to smaller, hit-above-the-weight kind of groups that can do hardcore multiboxing on every member level. If it's 3 accounts owned, then that makes anything above casual-level play in nullsec impossible - you *do* need subcap main, you do need dictor/links/boosh alt, you do need capital alt, you do need additional utility accounts (cynos etc.), and that's without even touching supercap pilots or having alts to leave logged off for timed/bait ops. Heck, even something as simple and basic as logistics is account heavy - cynoroute between Jita and Esoteria/Stain (one of the longest JF routes in use) is about 8-9 mids, meaning 8-9 dedicated cyno alts since all those mids are in middle of nowhere and you won't get any other use out of keeping those characters there.

I see, makes sense now.

Dead lowsec in that roaming gangs are a rare sight, the same is true of gate camps. There used to be many known choke points and 5 frigates in any given system looking for a fight. Now most systems are empty and quiet outside of random quick ganks and if you go 10-20 jumps you're almost guaranteed to find one or more wrecks with something juicy. I regularly see battleship wrecks with 12-40mil of stuff inside. 
---
I can appreciate people trying to learn the ropes of the game but the topic is replacing ships and this technique for generating isk requires 0 extra sp and basically just the knowledge of how to jump gates, switch your safety to yellow and maybe how to make and warp to bookmarks.
---
I blame CCP for making octaboxing an excellent way to play. The players are just doing what's best for them given the circumstances.
---
Very cool. Well if others are saying you're doing a good job then keep at it brother! Fly safe!
---
"here's a sample size of one single ship, which was significantly buffed around 2014" 
---
Seriously, talk about incompetent. Can't you throw out a single argument aside from an adhominime or "wahhh bots not bad \\(-.-)/"
---
You realize this would wreck your security status in no time at all, right? They'll have neutral alts in fleet, and "bystanders" might be there as well.
---
I like the idea in general, though. I actually don't know why people are so upset about it. I mean, except for the part where people would use freighters as gigantic one-time smart bombs to vaporize everyone around.
---
Hm... yeah, i really don't know why they don't like your idea. \^_\^
---
Ah yes the amazing “mmo news site” money fountain; I wonder if the google ads banner income covers hosting and domain costs...
---
isn't this basically fraud? not moralizing. just wondering.
---
Multiboxing in other MMOs caps out way earlier than EVE though. Try triple-boxing group content in WoW on any difficulty above tourist mode.
---
nah....Too cold in Iceland.
---
You can set an option in OBS that hides the mouse cursor. If you look at the video closely, you can still see tool tips appear as my mouse travels from window to window. I did this the old school way by just selecting window by window and pressing the relevant button or function key.
---
It's why I won. I have no motivation to progress when the carrot on the stick is the opportunity to multibox my FAX.
---
If PLEX price keeps going up, it'll be still as viable to multibox pve characters (PLEX will stop before the level where hardcore krabing can't keep up with price rise), but makes keeping multiple pvp-dedicated accounts subbed huge pain.

Just wanted to ask when Burn Jita starts? Was hauling several Billions of stuff in and out on weekend, would be a shame if I miss the event and get blapped.
---
Best advice - don't, just turn back and run away from this black hole for souls and sanity called EvE, it will make you suffer as even devs don't give a fuck about it anymore... just run away... and ^send help
---
Agreed, with the hundreds of rorquals in the belts of Delve running 23,5/7 the plex price will contiue to rise and probably quicker and quicker. Even 10 or 20 bil wouldn't be much because hey, someone can grind enough to pay for it so why not, it's playing for free after all, right?
---
The truth though is that many people didn't find grinding for plex just to grind for plex next month enjoyable in the slightest and with the prices increasing further, that amount will increase too. At some point you may find that while you can still obtain enough ISK to extend your game time, it may not be as enticing as the majority of the players had left and all that's left are the farmers. I would love to see that happen actually, and what will happen to CCP once that happens too.
---
Not gonna answer to all of your stuff, it's too much. Although, I appreciate you taking the time.
---
First off, just to clarify. I do not want to say that the balance is prefect or so, but only playing around with numbers makes the game not advancing but turning it in a circle. It might help to solve problems asap, but it will not solve everything on the long run.
---
1. Booshers, Chain booshing is a block warfare tactic. And there are quite some ways to break chain booshers. I was in quite some battles where we did exactly that. Counterplay: Longrange caps, Hit, Scram and run fleets: After 5 warpins, you got rid of most of the booshers and can pick the glass cannons easily.
---
2. ADCs: AF get a defensive boost for a few seconds, with a cooldown. Of course that makes them strong, but you have to know when to activate the ADC, and you gotta be done once it's running out. It takes alot of decisions to take the value out of it. Also, if you look at the used fleets now. AF and HAC exist now in many different variation, fits and still are not the only Go-To Option when it comes the fleets. (BCs, BS, Bombers etc all have their places, which is perfect for a meta)
---
3. Long investment ships: I feel you want to misunderstand me. If a ship is overpowered, nerf it, for sure. But you gotta make sure, it's still viable. At least if it's a larger investment. If you take away mining from Rorqs, you would simply take away something so many ppl trusted in. However, if you would reduce the mining to the level of a Hulk. It would still be worth it, but with a larger risk compared to the hulk.
---
That was because he flooded the market with plex bought from his profits. As he stated in his farewell manifesto thread.
---
You have no clue what you're talking about, then. Multiboxing in wow is INCREDIBLY powerful because input broadcasting is allowed. While not as common as in eve, there are players with 50+ accounts, able to farm gold (money) with them all at once, leading to incredible numbers.
---
&gt;or less dumb ...

Council of swollen men

that made me laugh, thank you :D
---
I had a go at exploring last few days.
---
I built a solid Astero for 85M. Dived into a chain of WHs.
---
I started in a C5. All data / relic sites had around 20 big rats. Same again for C4s. I went through a chain of WHs until I ended up in a C1. Finally found a relic site in with no rats that gave me about 40-50M so that paid for 1/2 the ship.
---
I prefer WHs because I think it's safer getting back to a hi-sec trade hub to sell your goods than null where you can run into scouted gate camps.
---
You could also come out of a hi-sec WH chain into null and do null sites (assuming the system is empty), then jump into the WH to get back to hi-sec avoiding a long and dangerous route.
---
Oooo 'member old plex for 350M isk?
---
No Eve. We're in safe!
---
Tl; dr, you got baited into posting a wall of text by the Nigerian space prince.
---
The problem I have there is it seemed spotty I almost never got any problems with it. So I assume it wasn't that easy to diagnose.
---
As they might not off been getting the problems them self's 
---
But Yeahs it was broken I've seen many games push out broken stuff like that.
---
i don't think so? https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/8yipyt/confession_of_a_botmaker/e2nqjno/
---
My money's on a Karmafleet/Brand Newbros line member.
---
I always have had trouble affording to replace lost ships, but that's mostly because I don't really let my wallet get above 200m isk. I buy a lot of other ships to play with. So loosing a ship may mean I can't afford a new one, but I likely have another one (of five) of the same class I can use until I can replace the lost ship.

My friend and I are currently able to run level 4 missions in battleships. While I can solo these I'm looking for something a bit more exciting for use to do and still make some decent isk. Any good suggestions? It doesn't have to be done in battleships. 
---
Someone did suggest running burner missions, but that would require a lot of long lvl4s, or mission declining to do.
---
nice, looks like a good job imo
---
Usually there is a mass flooding of Plex on the market may/June time for AT. As AT isn't happening this year then it their isn't a drive of Plex competition any more than any other time of the year, except maybe over Christmas. 
---
I wish the name checked out.
---
You should invite a fat Australian ginger to your alliance.. Sounds like he would love it there.
---
Gone are the days when people put even a little bit of effort into bait posts.
---
Mainly because I'm curious how it works, where are those numbers from?
---
Then why the fuck do you hang around?
---
In eve you take two weapon systems, autocannons and pulse lasers. 
---
Autocannons are like pulse lasers in terms of damage but have better tracking and shorter optimal range.
---
They are easily comparable to one another and gain in one common area while lacking in another. 
---
Tracer in Overwatch can teleport, Reinhardt can deploy a shield. They aren't really comparable. You wouldn't say that Tracer is like Reinhardt but with x,y,z instead of a,b,c; they're both very unique approaches to play. 
---
Tweaking numbers for balance is thinking like the former example, adding things like assault damage control and new fighter mechanics are like the later. 
---
Eve isn’t worth 15 eur a month tho, especially in its current state
---
you can also fit a cruiser prop mod on a battleship, is this also a noob trap?
---
and you clearly do not understand how much of a deal a mere few km's mean in terms of a scram. each km is huge. 
---
i think it is the player who needs to find and create what is viable, and not always adjust modules to 'make them more viable'
---
i agree slightly on the large guns side of this, would be nice for lower underclass tracking battleship guns to actually, track, like the name they have. ie: cruiser gun in the name? why not cruiser tracking?
---
CCP wants plex to partially balance the economy (because pay for convenience) the more expensive a plex gets, the more isk you buy by buying plex from CCP, making their offer better and better). CCP generates plex only once the money is in their bank account so from their perspective, as you said, it's very likely that 40 alts is more preferrable than 40 separate players, even if the second option is infinitely healthier to the game. I could type something about preferring short-term gains over long-term ones but as this game has survived for what's it been now, 15 years? This alone would make this argument weak but then again, do you honestly expect this game to be fun in 5 years? Or even alive? It's mostly garbage now so I'm kind of pessimistic...
---
In which direction?
---
Do they give you reddit talking points when you register as a ~~retard~~ goon. 
---
Look at MERs and Plex prices. "Inflation" in game doesn't keep pace with Plex prices. Suitonia claiming Plex has always cost 20-40 hrs of linemember grind is wrong (level 4s paid 30+m/hr waaaayyyy back, belt ratting 12-15m/hr, etc., back when a 30 day gtc was 350m). There are fewer plex sellers these days. Etc.
---
Ubsubbing accounts is no idle threat from plenty of folks. It's not good news for CCP when players stop paying directly and/or subbing as many accounts, regardless kf how you try to spin it.
---
90 day gtc for under a billion!
---
&gt;changes have to be well thought out
---
I sure am glad CCP always take their time to fix stuff properly and in a well thought-out manner, premium examples of this laudable strategy are ghost training, citadel void bombs, fozzie claws or lurch HICtors to just name a few.
---
/s
---
&gt; many people didn't find grinding for plex just to grind for plex next month enjoyable
---
use RL money?
---
at the same time though, if you bux a plex and sell it for isk, you get 2b, not like 300-500m. for one month of gametime you can buy almost a cheap carrier, or for example 19 ships worth 100m each, or 190 ships worth 10m each. this is not bad for new players.
---
Nah.
---
In Wow people who uses that number of accounts uses bots.
---
In WoW if you get banned it doesn't matter, you don't need items or skills to farm. You just get another account, lvl it up to max lvl and keep botting. You may lose like 1 day of botting at max.
---
I'm a former bot user in some wow accounts.
---
This. CCP is in maintenance mode, and so am I. After years of paying for 6+ accounts with rl money, I've extracted all but 1 and am going to play off ingame wealth until I'm bored or it dries up.
---
You're underestimating how much clicking goes into 50 accounts, even if it's just setting up skills queues and ejecting skillpoints. I can imagine it's also extremely boring. 
---
ask for advice in 'haulers channel' in game. they can set prices, for hauls and places and collateral's.
---
generally there are limits to collaterals to courier jobs above 60k m3.
---
and getting people to move your stuff outside of hisec is alot harder, and alot more expensive in my experiences.
---

This is super cool. The thing that the community can invenet never seizes to amaze me.

It is also super scary as it opens for a whole new level of consensual elite-PVP. And I don't deal well with things that threatens "real" elite-PVP.
---
point in case, I have isk, and I reeaaally suck at the game
---
Yeah charging people more based on their race is basically fraud. I've posted how you can correct this.
---
NO!
---
&gt; Most mechanics in EVE are very simple.
---
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
the best calm you tits ever to grace my eye balls thank you for this 
---
That too is a matter of perspective. I consider it fun enough to pay that (a bit less actually, 13eur x 3) but I can understand people who either think it's not worth it or simply can't pay that. I'm lucky enough to have a job that pays well enough for this not to be an issue. Also, when I look at this from the grind perspective - to play for "free" (or maybe to be more accurate - work for play), I find it preferrable to pay instead of wasting many, many hours in getting plex to continue "playing". The amount of time it takes me to get the money to pay the sub is significantly shorter than the time it would take me to earn ISK for plex. Time is a finite resource too and I much prefer to have free time than to be forced to do "slave labour" just so I can do it again next week.
---
If on there was a module introduced that kills bombs....mmmmm
---
You truly are just talking out of your ass. Due to the way nodes (herbs, mining etc.) work, when somebody harvests it, there is a buffer (iirc its like 5 seconds) where others can also harvest it and get materials. This means if you multibox 50 accounts and mine a node, all 50 accounts get to harvest it. 
---
You can also have all 50 accounts run the same raids (each in their own instance) at once, leading to incredible gold/hr.
---
One of my good friends owns 30 accounts. I know how it works, mate. Sustaining lots of accounts via multiboxing+farming is boring, but not impossible, and botting is not at all needed.
---
I don't know did they give you talking points when you registered as a retard?
---
I am proud to be a Braindead Retard. You are jealous of me
---
When i started playing in at the end of 2014 one month gametime (1 old plex) was about 650m isk.
---
This is a very rough guide. 
---
1. Purchase 500 Plex for 1.9b approx, Omega your character, start training a skill you want to extract.
---
2. Purchase 4 Skill Extractors from the market at 1.7b Approx (Note a character will earn just under 4 Extractors worth with max remap and +5s, you want to make sure you're sitting in +5s when you're not using the character, insta-swap citadels in stagings are good for this. You get slightly better value from purchasing the 10 extractor pack with plex from the NES store) 
---
3. Sell your 4 Skill Injectors for 3.5b Approx
---
4. This means you made 1.8b profit Approx from the Skill Extractors
---
5. Cover the remaining 100m\~ yourself from Krabbing.   
---
With the introduction of skill injectors/extractors, CCP has forgotten that players are always willing to spend only a sum X of real money on a game. EVE players have spent this amount in injectors (real money =&gt; PLEX =&gt; ISK =&gt; injectors / instead of in game time) and made one or more chars that generate more income than before, hoping to buy later game time with this higher income and not need real money for it anymore. The only problem is, everyone did it and hardly anyone buys PLEX anymore, which of course drives up the price.  Complaining about it is as stupid as introducing injectors themselves.
---
When plex as 700m there was still plenty of ways to earn 300-400m isk/hr with capitals and nullsec. Rorquals barely make 100-120m/hr on average because ore prices are so cheap.
---
People are blaming this on shit that isn’t even related to it.
---
no mention of flooding the market with plex ?

Not everybody can (or will) pay RL money. While you may argue that these people aren't too "valuable" to a company, they help keeping the game and the user base healthy. They are playing the game and the more people play it (especially with a game like Eve) the better. The problem is, the more expensive a plex gets, the amount of those players decreases, also, remember that it's not only plex that's getting expensive. Most of the items in game are. Therefore the value you're getting from selling plex is actually on a similar level even if you get more ISK for it.
---
Ok, at this point I’m going to have to assume you’re illiterate, trolling me, or have no basic understanding of how markets work, I have a degree in economics, and all of your responses aren’t even proper sentences, as your clearly simply added question marks to the end of your statements.  
---
How many carriers/supers or VNIs can you multibox and how many rorquals? Rorquals scale well, carriers/supers are terrible at that... Also carrier/super ratting is very active, it requires attention and a lot of clicking - sure some more hardcore players may do it 5 hours straight, but a lot of people get tired after an hour or two. Rorquals on the other hand - mine 8 hours straight on a lazy Saturday while chatting or watching movies...
---
It's not based on race but where you live, just saying.
---
But did your income not increase?
---
Race? It has to do with purchase power across different regions. When you're selling digital products, i.e there's no tangible physical manifacturing or extraction process behind it that sets a minimum price limit, companies will sell at whatever price threshold they think people will buy, which happens to be lower in e.g Russia.
---
Why use common sense when you can do poor political baiting?
---
Straight to the important point 
---
Now highlight the dates where there was some kind of PLEX sale happening.
---
Back in my day (like 2009) you couod get a 30 day GTC for 400m...
---
Battle heron is very stronk. I nearly lost a pvp fit dual rep astero a few weeks ago to one. 
---
Almost everything about this game is stuff in the database. Want to reverse ore availability between hs and null? change some parameters. Want some sites not to spawn? Again parameters. Want ihub upgrades not to be mandatory for supercaps? again, just parameters. You will discover that a lot of things are just parameters in database.
---
Unfortunately that doesn't tell you which parameters to change or that those parameters really need changing. 
---
Propmod off?
---
Exactly. 1B is an impossible grind for a new player. It's only the crusty old hands with their alts and multibox and all kinds of SP flowing around that can do this. Someone is detached from their roots.
---
And what a terrible recruitment line. 
---
$9 for PLEX vs. 20 hours of noob grind, let me think about that....
---
TLDR for nerds: Game is easy, nerds are stupid.
---
Shame on you for destroying ships. Build ships instead.
---
Is that CCP Dolan soon?
---
I literally just started this week, and even I heard about it about 30 times so far.
---
People who buy plex with $ will generally sell to buy orders, not toy around Jita for a month to maybe get 5% more.
---
You’re still tying this to shit that’s unrelated.
---
If you want to know why PLEX is going up you need to look at what’s changed recently in the player meta game. This sudden price spike isn’t because in the last month suddenly the numbers of rorqual alts is doubling across EVE.
---
But hey, ignore the facts that are presented directly to your face about why this is happening and instead choose to continue a really dumb rhetoric. Rorquals make everything in the game cheaper by reducing mineral component costs. As rorquals continue to proliferate that trend only continues. Eventually all those rorqual alts go from barely profitable to unprofitable and you either have to sustain them with PLEX purchased outside the game or unsub them.
---
None of that has any impact on PLEX that would suggest why we have this market runup. On the other hand, if we look at Perimeter...it’s much more likely that High value traders have been sitting on stockpiles because of instability in the marketplace.
---
Who’d want to deal with asset safety fees on 500b worth of plex?
---
&gt;How many new people are we gonna recruit with the "hey if you can pay per month with in game cash"
---
  I never say this- I tell them to sub up, use the ISK made on ships to blow shit up. Much more fun than PVE'ing your way just to play for free to PVE some more.
---
This is patently false. The octoboxers aren’t why plex spiked over the course of a month but good try on blaming unrelated issues that you happen to not like.
---
I honestly don't care, just get a job or don't be a fucking ten boxing sperg
---
Knowing nothing about coding or game development, I am 100% confident that it's super simple and easy
---
Yeah, just got my answer though, armor plate put me over limit by 660 tons.
---
Now  it is

My pleasure! I love those moments myself.

The latter. Obsessively pursuing a pointless goal in Eve just for the meme is half of the fun in the game.

If ccp can afford to provide an African with eve for $4 per sub they can afford to do so with N.Americans. So let's just set the price at that instead of making peeps jump through hoops via vpn and steam accounts to get cheap subs.
---
You can bet if it would generate more server lag we'd see more of them in massive fights. If only to try and crash the node
---
But what really happened is, that the "free" MCT from galaxy packs sales has dried up, and MCT's price went back to the cost of the plex it's bought with in NES.
---
Lol nibber

5/7 bait
---
Yeah but that's not why you're doing the event, right? I always thought it was just for shits and giggles.
---
Skill farms lost any profit margin now, do they still run the farms?
---
Yes, and I will never Failscade, I have one member who care about who I am and what I stand for to let anyone Hit the Delete key on me!
---
I see me bringing up "Ohh x left me" and "oh I fucked over that" literally not knowing wtf I am saying only spewing out roomers I here without the full story..... I will not failscade even now as I am fighting outmatched numbers I am still doing what I need to do.
---
I like to look at things from a surprising perspective, A Lady Scarlet perspective.... If 90% of eve can pound a person the size of Lady Scarlet literally making her outnumberd worse then I am now and she is still in game. Seriously I have fuck all to worry about.
---
As a PLEX trader, I disagree. 
---
If you have a free slot for a prop and have no resources for a battleship prop then it's okay? But a ship has to have terrible numbers, or the fitter has to have a rock brain for that to be the case (-&gt;noob trapped)? Maybe take off that 4th rep and put in an energised nano plating ygm? zkill is full of goofball fits ~~like my dps shield tank paladin~~
---
In terms of subcaps, yeah a few km is big, but if a cap pilot is good enough to get in range of a super with 10km, they'd be good enough to get in range with 14km, so you see, for those situations nothing changes. Maybe a cap pilot gets a scram they otherwise wouldn't get but even then, they fitted the tool for that one job, they should be able to pull it off with some margin for error
---
Using the heavy scram vs subcaps, the idea is to let a frig-&gt;cruiser get up close to scram you and then you have a "Oh I'm not trapped here with you, you're trapped here with *me*" moment before you heavy grap, heavy scram, release drones and lay on the blappination. They'd be on comms like "Fuck, this guy has a fly-swatter fit, can we get a battleship to x system to deal with this?" "*Fumbles potato chips everywhere* W-which system? I love killing those idiots" -&gt; fun content
---
I think you should be able to fit fly-swatting turret battleships, like you can fit fly-swatting missile boats. They're bad vs other battleships, the niche is already there to be filled
---
All this qq about Serenity. Maybe the Model of renting space to so called meatshields was 2010 the hawt shit, dear north. But please nerf Rorquals, why not. Do you think the elite north will ever close the gap? And which Side could replace Stuff After a nerf faster? NC would simply stay docked 99% of time without the Income of Killahs 20 Rorquals

this a copypasta?

It's not worth grinding rats/whatever for hours.
---
But that's just my opinion.
---
I appreciate you looking deeper than rorquals are bad they make plex expensive. But Perimeter fighting isn't the reason either, you can keep plex in the plex vault and take down buy/sell orders easily. Plex should never go to asset safety. I think it's more a because skill farms are profitable again.
---
I’ll spell it out for you anyways, since you were kind enough to at least send a response to my response. The line ‘Let the drop in PLEX prices will be my last gift the EVE Community’  is enough to draw the conclusion he’s flooded the market to bring the prices down. I’m not going to go any deeper than that into economic theory, I had thought it would be an easier inference for people to make. Apparently I was wrong.
---
a sebo is more useful than a cruiser prop on a battleship. or ecm module. or. a data scanner. literally. please dont fit undersized prop mods to any battleship or below.
---
you statement stands with battleships tracking better, join the queue of players who have cried for battleships to actually be able to track stuff in certain fits. amungst other things.

the heavy scram range buff would be unfair to the 'small chance' of escaping if your the one tackled in a heavy scram scenerio.

Yea, the tens of thousands of skill farm toons have little to do with it.  Get the pitch forks and lets hunt those rorq multiboxers. 
---
lol solitude
---
We are seeing that now with capitals and rorqs. 
---
When you say inflation, can you give an example of what you mean? Ideally an item which has massively increased in price. And no, not plex, something which isn't bought with real currency.
---
Should run it by the CSM. Make null even safer from those pesky small gang guys that just want to kite around and not be real men and get capitals dropped on their face.
---
If you can't afford 11 bucks a month then you/they need to sell their computer.

2nd one is undock button that you have in NPC station.

Don't you start in space? Theoretically you could play the game without docking with the help of a friend(alt)

I'm good at rocket league! I'm not good at Eve.
---
Can you try on a clean install? (Other partition or something?)
---
What sound card are you using?
---
My entire point is that isk has become devalued against the dollar, so no I can't. 
---
There was a time, where i paid 330mil for 90 days
---
Oh man you really got me there.
---
That doesn't mean he flooded the market with plex. It could just as easily mean that by quiting development there would be a lot less demand for plex since those accounts are no longer botting thereby lowering prices through less demand. 
---
People believe they are more important than they actually are. He probably believed that he was driving such a high demand for plex that when he stopped the market would crash. 
---
Yep, getting noobs to grind for plex is a wonderful way to get them to quit playing. Eve is a job which pays terribly.
---
go back to r/wow
---
Why pay for PLEX if you can just run your bot for a few hours? I suspect CCP doesn't really care too much about this, which might be a mistake. It undermines one of their revenue streams if players choose botting and/or rorquals as a way to ISK than via PLEX. Can you really blame a rationally minded player? They see rampent, ongoing, unpunished botting every day in this subreddit; then, when they want a new dread ask themselves, "self, do I give up $40 or something for this, or just get it for free the way that the Chinese, the Russians in the drone lands, the Goons, GotG, and I'm sure everyone else is doing.
---
The price of PLEX will inevitably correlate with the level of botting in the game.
---
And what’s making skill farms “profitable” again then? Also I disagree. Injector prices are higher but MPTCs and plex are still way higher costs than injector prices need to be for it to actually be profitable.
---
Who are you quoting? No one ever said that. 
---
Luckily I don't have that rock brain anymore lol
---
Rock vs Paper is unfair on the rock 
---
Regardless of the means, the end result is the same. Prices dropped down due to his actions.  Supply side economics are also easier for lay people to understand, in my experience, as well.
---
I mean I pay for my 15 some accounts with credit card because 1 hr overtime irl vs 13 hrs in game grinding to make enough isk to plex them all sooo... yeah, imma keep 15 boxing rorqs and other fun activities k thx.
---
That being said, i also buy plex from ccp and sell it, so yes everyone else, keep plexing shit. Makes my plex sell higher.
---
Also its only about $130 monthly for 15 accounts if you do annual subscriptions and wait for sales.
---
i dont see th eissue here, everyone is making more isk than ever
---
Highsec incursions has significantly died down because nullsec &gt;&gt;&gt; highsec incursions.
---
clicking in a mmo? no way
---
what content? the tidi in jita? or whoring on suspect coercers? i hardly would call burn jita , content.

its simply cancerous, tidi, superlaggy chatspam by weird sociopathic entities....

this is content for the moronic pilots of eve maybe ;)
---
or for those who know how to steal the loot.
---
I want to say the lowest prices in my time were about 150 for 30, 450 for 90. I started in late 2006 iirc, so I'm sure they were lower before then.
---
try isboxer, its has really good macros
---
If they sell a sub for 8 dollars in Africa, they cant afford it there, so they get 0 dollars. 
---
If they sell a sub for 4 dollars in the US and in Africa, they make 8 dollars because the africans and the US can afford it.
---
If they sell a sub for 8 dollars in the US and for 4 dollars in Africa, they make 12 dollars.
---
You should have listened in high school my main man
---
nah chieftan 
---
T2 is up nearly 100% in some cases from pre moon mining meanwhile carriers are the new battleship.
---
Lol you were wrong and you’re now posting r/iamverysmart (but not really) gold. Thanks for the laugh. 
---
Incursion payouts hasn't really changed over the last few years (10,2T in January 2017, 10,9T in January 2019), yeah it might have shifted a bit between from high -&gt; null. The problem with null incursions is that often the focus spawn in a bad place - either people living there are interested in getting rid of it ASAP or its a bad place where its hard to farm it really.
---
I haven't run highsec incursions for some months, but last i remember highsec was quite active, often had 2-3 groups running the same focus. I doubt it has decreased that much... Also, I think people are underestimating how much highsecers gain in their focus. If the top person grinds like 700-1000k LP, thats A LOT of isk...
---
I know there's nothing you can do about it because it's basically CCP's business model to get krabs to krab for krabbing sake, but I hope the (non-Goon portion of the) CSM has been making it very clear that this kind of environment is not conducive for a long-term healthy universe?
---
When the best way to play the game is to not interact with anyone else and just create ISK for the sake of it, it's just a stalemate. There are no conflict drivers in this game any more, and it seems like CCP want that to be the case because it positively affects sub numbers when people are less likely to lose their shit.
---
It’s the illuminati that did it not basic supply and demand!!!
---
15 hrs of extra work per month to play a video game is a bit sad. 
---
Why blame people for taking advantage of the drugs CCP pushed on them? The problem (since injectors came out) has always been injectors. 
---
If they had to set up microtransactions relating to SP, there should be a limit to the benefit of the SP. Selling a drug that reduces the multiplier by 1X per level of purchased product (a -10X injector would be prohibitively expensive but you can have carrier to level V in under a month) would have allowed the benefit of fast training without the instant injection bloat of SP.
---
Another way of handling it would have been having a limit on the number injected SP you can benefit from in a day, similar to the ones for Alphas.
---
CCP can't do either, now. They're raking in more money than they ever have with fewer total players.
---
3/10 is easily doable in vexors, t3ds or similar t1 cruisers. 4/10 can be difficult. always google that stuff ( if u can read german [https://sistersprobe.fandom.com/de/wiki/EVE\_Sister\_Core\_Scanner\_Probe\_Wiki](https://sistersprobe.fandom.com/de/wiki/EVE_Sister_Core_Scanner_Probe_Wiki) ) or use [https://eve-survival.org/wikka.php?wakka=HomePage](https://eve-survival.org/wikka.php?wakka=HomePage) 
---
it contains all the info u looking for. 1-2/10 are only accesile with frigs / destroyers. never done those.
---
[https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/NPC\_damage\_types](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/NPC_damage_types) also good info. ( usually u just need to check some carebears bio, they often contain all dmg types to use....)
---
All forms of ISK making are boring though, especially on the lower end 
---
I suppose the clue was in the name. Thanks. 
---
The least boring PvP you can probably do is abyssal sites, run in non T3 cruisers.
---
you forget its a free to play game, you dont need to pay the 2b a month
---
FXR is so bad! 
---
PR shills gonna shill.
---
An extra 8/9 hours is nothing to a bot though 
---
To be fair to him, it looks like he switched off the heat on the neut before his guns would have burned out but for some reason it didn't take? Around the 2:15 mark you see him clicking on the guns and the neut but only the guns switching off the overheat.
---
Well...I don’t think anything was proved to be absolutely right or wrong, and we would t be able to be 100% certain without the bot-maker himself leaving a statement.  All the competent rebuttals were more of ‘what ifs’ or ‘this could also be the case’
---
Even with LP you will rarely make that much more than a single for a. It's like 200m or less an hour IIRC
---
so what you're saying is, people don't buy plex to sell for isk, because they don't think it's worth getting so much isk?
---
(Now, if you were arguing that they're buying *less* plex, because they're getting more isk, then you'd be making some sense. But that's not your argument.)
---
the people who fifteenbox rorqs don't really care about the price of PLEX, which just defines the price floor for their services. Blame the regular player who buys injectors f.e. and thus allows farmers to exist and flourish.
---
buff rorqs please, im bary making any isks while risking 10b
---
Its still pretty good, compared to the low skill requirements to jump in a T1 battleship with meta guns, compared to lets say carrier ratting.
---
What do you want to do in the game ?
---
Your inference is so fucking stupid compared to the person you are arguing against lolololol
---
You are either a troll, or genuinely stupid.
---
that would be the purple line on the graph
---
Every single Battleship is up 25% over the last year.
---
Also every T2 weapon fit.
---
&gt; Who’d want to deal with asset safety fees on 500b worth of plex?
---
Wtf are you talking about. You stick your 1T of plex in the plex vault, warp your shuttle to another station and relist some of it on market. This is a non-issue.
---
If it helps that was my reading too, I mean it's not a gift if I choose to stop egging your house
---
So fucking stupid. Just keep taking the juicy parts and shit that’s been regurgitated over the years, mix it up and hit post
---
There is a module called "Defender Launcher I"

Right. It implies he took some sort of action. (What i termed as ‘flooding the market’)

It's literally point number one in the blog.

Maybe actually look at the source material that's being discussed?

Send help this man needs medical attention.

I was capable of doing high end plexes solo when I left. Also I was doing a lot of exploration and some PI. I loved escaping folks with an Astero loaded to the brim with bling after a night out and I lost some but more often I got away.
---
What do you want to do is a hard question in eve...
---
So maybe try the other side now? Currently I am not sure. Maybe try to through burn some of my assets to errr… create content?
---
8 rorquals is not 100 barges. And people were doing that before.
---
Also 20 carriers multiboxing was not uncommon too, where's that now...
---
Make ISK harder to gain in-game, especially though multi-boxing. Making ISK is just too damn easy. For semi-afk activities, like mining, there should be a low limit on the possible income. Ships like the Rorq should be APM intensive and difficult to multi-box, or so easy to kill you need a host of other pilots to aid in the deployment. 
---
Make ISK harder to earn at the high-end so there is less to be spent on PLEX. 
---
Decrease the profitability of AFK and Multi-box operations by increasing complexity or increasing the vulnerability. 
---
Never Ignorant Getting Goals Accomplished!
---
No shit, the guy is just implying skillfarms are somehow free of this. It's the same grind whether you rat/mine or skillfarm. 
---
BUT BOTTING RORQUALS!!
---
Try taking what ever ship you have and try to wreck other people's ships. Generally works great on fun creating.
---
oof. getting dunked by CCP themselves has gotta burn
---
I thought you guys didn't want balance changes or QOL improvements anymore, you wanted the AT and new features. 
---
do you serisously believe farming sp is as much clicking as ratting/mining/whatever
---
good explanation... maybe you should join the community team.. help improve those community relations.
---
This is putting a cap on how many alts a person can fund.  I hope it goes higher.  Buying yearly subs is the way to go. 
---
So are rorquals. 
---
Or are you *really* gonna suggest that rorquals have caused a supply side dip on plex? =\
---
This reminds me of the time we got four or five incursions in a row in Delve. Our guys actually got sick of running them for cash! We krabbed out.
---
tfw you cannot refit in combat, hello 2015 or something ...
---
Jesus that was over 3 years ago. Show us on the doll where Capri touched you...
---
&gt; But best, you ask Suitonia or someone with regular small/solo roam experience. I doubt that ppl who do those regularly, complain as much...

thats why suit wrote all of this down right? because he thinks capital/fighter application is perfectly fine, right? RIGHT?  https://suitonia.wordpress.com/2018/10/25/how-broken-and-oppressive-is-light-fighter-and-heavy-fighter-application-maths-edition/

1. Its Ataryx, he is mostly solo (with his accounts)

2. Snuff is deployed in Minma space, as one should know ...

Replies to obvious bait more than serious issue threads and still gets upvoted. Shame.
---
"Decreased faith in the future of the game = more players refusing to pay for the game and just using the wealth they have in game to get a bit more playtime."
---
This. Exactly this. For more than 2 years CCP has steered the game towards higher profit per player. To compensate and incentivize their target group, they've slowly changed the game to make it worth their wallet. And that's all.
---
The side effect of a greater general unhappiness with the game was predictable and seemingly acceptable from a business perspective. Granted that this unhappiness wouldn't come over night, it worked quite well for a while. Players have different reasons to defend against the notion of being scammed by CCP and so it takes time to realize what is going on.
---
I'm bad with predictions, but when I understood this, there seemed to be only two possible outcomes. Either the game will continue to exist with a 20 accounts per player average based on milking the remaining whales. Or the game will just break apart once enough people have been pissed off. 
---
In either scenario, the game isn't mine anymore and so I decided to not pay a single cent to CCP for anything anymore. 
---
CCP must have known the Rorqual change was going to be a fiasco. There is no way they legitimately thought that was all going to be fine and good for the game. i'm pretty much sure they did it knowing that people would go full retard on them and make them new accounts subbed and injected (which means more PLEX and more Extractors sold). Either way CCP did what the did fully knowing the outcome and planed towards it, or they are really incompetent, or either, idk.
---
Only way to fix it now is pretty easy tho, but will make alot of people butthurt. Solution is, drastically nerf the invul. Having that amount of tanking a Rorqual has plus a 7 minute god mod is purely ridiculous.
---
All is linked, Rorquals made people go full retarded on making alot of ISKs and brought the Capital proliferation problem. Rorquals need to be nerfed to bring balance, and deploying Supers must be made more difficult than just light a cyno, drop all you have on the krab that is in trouble, wait for the attackers to leave cause all hail the blob then jump back a few minutes later and ggwp. 
---
&gt;at we need is upper level or how many accounts each player can be running /owning  - but we will never have this as from financial perspective it will be b
---
No, really you don't. There are plenty of ways to make isk, and frankly... if you just actually sub two or three accounts that's billions less you have to mine every fucking month to pay for your bagazillion mining alts... and from my experience, come out with the exact same spendable isk as I do on my 3 accounts that cost me $300 a year. 
---
This guy's so edgy he's gonna cut himself one day.
---
It's the complete package: name, flair and comment nicely round off the picture of high percentage idiocy.
---
Uh... The pack was $45 when on sale and Yes it was worth it even without the 3 months sub.  1100 PLEX alone is the $35-40 package (I'm UK and trying to remember the US price points), 1 MCT is another $10-15, Then the 10 Extractors are another 1120 PLEX, Thus another $40
---
All in all, It was about 10 Billion of ISK in the package, For $45
---
It was more than worth it.
---
Some people will find an anom, scan it down, cloak and wait to kill.   Part of the game. 
---
Yeah, It was pretty much a case of them doing sales to make the books look nice for any buyer to see. And it worked, PA bought them.
---
Don’t know why you’re being downvoted. This is exactly what myself and a couple others have done. - kept mains subbed with PLEX and wealth reserves. I haven’t spent real money on EVE since December 2017  because I didn’t want to keep pouring money into something with an uncertain future. 
---
&gt; Carriers that earn high-end incursion payouts solo
---
You know that incursions require a certain amount of players in the "Winning Fleet" to get payout? I can't speak for Nullsec, but in High. HQ's require 20 pilots in site in order to get paid. You cant do anything solo
---
So... next week or ™? :&gt;
---
Pay me what my 36 rorq bots make and I'll stop
---
I'm not really sure if I want or not the read them tbh.
---
Either way CCP fixes it's stance towards Rorqual and Cap bullshit, or they'll just send the game to die.
---
idk tbh. 
---
Yes I've made a fault in logic there, what I'm tying to say is that people don't buy plex to sell for isk as they can earn the  amount of isk they require with elsewhere without shelling out of pocket.  Leading to fewer plex being bought. 
---
Isk to isk prices may have stayed the same or even dropped due to the massive amounts of ore being extracted but plex (or the dollar) has become more valuable in comparison. Due to an increase of isk in the system people are less incentivised to acquire an isk injection via plex. 
---
Opinions are based on knowledge and experience.  Gamers and creators share some of both. But creators went to another level.  A level that would take some of the fun out of it for me and other gamers. 
---
This is why 90% of our opinions as players are based on incomplete understanding of the meta we are concerned with. 
---
Getting pissed just gets in the way of learning to use the meta to your advantage. 
---
I could do with depressed prices for a bit. I'd love to load up in a correction.
---
I just downloaded my inventory into jEveAssets since I could not find any shit ;) 
---
Looks like someone filled a bunch of my "market orders" with insane prices (underpriced a bunch of buy order before I left) ;) I more than doubled my assets from the time I left :D 
---
So that start wont be that bad
---
have not, that's probably the solution. know any good ones?
---
It sounds to me like init is failscading.
---
Barges are much easier for someone to gank than a rorq.
---
&gt;You have no clue how much work they do.
---
all we can do is point to the actual results and the frequency of balance increments, which is absolutely glacial. i don't care how much work they're doing if nothing is effectively getting done
---
&gt;if you just tune numbers it's just another ship that becomes meta
---
do you propose any alternatives, other than hoping they just keep adding new power-creep jesus-features like ADCs and triglav ships?
---
&gt; I remember in 2010 Plex cost 220m
---
and Battleships were worth using (and only 50-70M a hull)!
---
Sorry, but I read that part as "I'm shutting down the auth server to my bot, revoking everyone's license, dropping the demand for PLEX, as they will likely unsub their accounts until they can find a suitable replacement." Alternatively, "People were paying me in PLEX, now that I have shut my bot down, the demand (and the price) will drop."
---
Or are you honestly suggesting he spent all the (real) money he made from the bot to flood the market with cheap PLEX, that alone being sufficient to drop the price by 10%? Is there a significant increase in supply in the graph he posted?
---
^(a question mark at the end of a sentence ⦗sometimes put in parenthesis⦘ is an internet colloquialism for a statement you're unsure about, as in "unless you have more information I don't know about.")
---
Adaptovise 
---
Before LP. Most incursions sites  (In Highsec) pay around 90-120m / hour. LP is gained at 7k per site (HQ's) and LP sells for roughly 1200 isk per lp. So, you can do the math. A site takes 10-20 minutes depending on which site you are doing. 
---
So let's take this into account... with 1 rorq you should be able to make... 250-350M an hour easily. 15 rorqs x 350M = 5.2B an hour. 500 PLEX = 1.93B currently. So... in other words it would take you 6 hours of grinding to 8 hours of grinding per month to make 30 - 31.2B, which is enough for all 15 accounts with current prices. VS you paying roughly 1.5k - 2k a year + whatever else you buy for plex. But only numbers \o/
---
Also 13 hours is wrong GG
---
It looks like he has some practice at this and he takes advantage of fleet warp at the end. It also looks like all four windows are up and he has all the ships setup so the same key can fire the bombs. If it was anything but a 1 click press bombing run I don’t think you could do this but since bombs are just align-f#-warp I believe it was manually done. 
---
Honestly the only way to fix rorqs is to remove them really, or completely remove the PANIC. 
---
They need to be killable under super umbrellas with bomber squads, otherwise you are just giving another bonus to having your Rorq in Goon space or somewhere similar. 
---
\&gt; deploying Supers must be made more difficult than just light a cyno, drop all you have on the krab that is in trouble, wait for the attackers to leave cause all hail the blob then jump back a few minutes later and ggwp. 
---
Totally agree. 
---
great advise but how do I get my ship to go a direction when all I can do is orbit and align to objects is there something that allows me to manually align my ship? 
---
Simply put, Eve is a social game. Connection's create subscribers. 
---
This is why local will always be part of eve. 
---
the barrier to entry for PvE is a lot lower while the supply of plex likely remained static there is also the issue of other game mechanics increasing the demand for plex.
---
That law also applies to Legacy. Unfortunately your posting is pretty shit.
---
Are we gonna learn about the roadmap for the forseable future with the minutes or is there gonna be a devblog about it soon"ish"? Or neither?
---
This is part of what makes eve fun.
---
Don't use the highest end ships and accept the losses. I LOVED exploring and the most fun part was getting away. low-sec was quite easy, since you can just cloak once someone shows up in local. 
---
Scan like a madman to see if there are any probes out hunting you. I usually get you in a few scans if I try to locate you, so be on the edge.
---
By botting, he would be earning isk in the form of bounty payments. I had imagined he would just manipulate the market by doing the opposite of Buy low/sell high, like a Robin Hood type move.  He did say it would be a gift, simple inaction would hardly be considered a gift, and would be rather conceited to call it as such.
---
I missed it actually, or rather I read it ages ago and forgot. That article is about a year old and I remembered the gist of it so didn't re-read it.
---
I guess you conveniently left out the second part though: 
---
&gt;" The complexity in this game emerges from the sheer quantity of mechanics and their various interactions."
---
This seems fairly accurate. The way the different mechanics touch each other is what give Eve its depth, not one mega mechanic. Theres a couple of topics that are complex, like tracking and other things like it, but most players never actually interact with those things on that level. 
---
Anyway if you want to engage with what capri actually says rather than memeing on one sentence, circle-jerking about how hard eve is you can, I wont hold my breath. Its pretty clear what you're doing based on how you chose to respond to this post. 
---
"eve so complex cant even try to balance it guys"
---
very nice
---
A lot, but a lot less than in 2h of super ratting ;)
---
Improdapt
---
The TEST forum thread of Capri and Jean Leaner endlessly shitting on our shield supers is one of my favorite historical EVE documents.
---
I’d like to get one but I’m training up for battleships to run l4 missions right now.  Maybe once i get started running those and have more steady income.
---
Excavators are not really the problem tbh. I mean, they are what they are, a slow, vulnerable drone that mines, it can be killed. The problem is rather the fact that the Rorqual can facetank until whatever needs to arrive and save the day. The issue is the unbalanced ship that operated them. By definition, the PANIC negates the notion of risk there is to deploy them.
---
it's a garbage game run by idiots but there's still nothing like it
---
This is a really stupid fuckin video. Why do you think someone wants to watch you shoot rats? Post some pvp footage or grfo
---
Burn Jita is part of eve lore now. It's like a holiday. I have never taken part but like the idea of shutting down highsec for a weekend.  Null sec should all nap for 3 days next year and expand to Burn High Sec!  
---
I’ll try and find some wormholes to move through next time I explore.  Some of the areas I want to get to in NPC nullsec are a lot of jumps from high sec.
---
The same number you get with "that dude who's been playing for eight years is going to go out of his way to destroy everything you own as a new player simply because he can and nobody, least of all you, is going to stop him."
---
I'm not sure this would be a solution, but can you explain why an account limit is necessarily bad from a financial perspective? Not having a limit leaves the door open to milk the whales. Having a limit could incentivize more different people to see sense in paying for the game. 
---
Right now, from a player financial perspective, it looks like CCP wants us to adapt to becoming wallet warriors in addition to whatever else we're doing in the game. You know, like a semi-clever way to make pay2win not look like pay2win. Two things I don't like about that. First, I don't like lazy liars and second, if I wanted to play wallet warrior, I'd do it without some Icelandic middle man. 
---
My financial reaction is to not give CCP any more money for anything. A lot of others seem to have made the same decision. If this trend grows strong enough, CCP will end up being dependent on payments of a small group of whales and so will the game.
---
And then, I might be wrong, there might be a few reasons why those whales refuse to pay as well. Right now they have the feeling of winning with the help of their wallets, but what happens as soon as enough other guys stopped paying or even playing and the whales don't feel like they're getting what they're paying for: the feeling of being a winner? Isn't that bad from a financial perspective?
---
&gt; best time  ....   short time playing eve. 
---
self explaining
---
So what your saying is that those hundreds of specialized, multiboxing Rorqual accounts have no effect on the price of plex? Do you presume they are all being paid for by real money? Yes, it sounds ridiculous and it is. Farming alts, no matter if they use Rorquals or skill extractors are what's driving the price up. The demand is high and the supply is dropping, because why sell now if the price is skyrocketing? I sell plex only when I need money and I sell only so much that my need is satisfied. The rest is increasing in value in my plex vault. Why would I sell them now if I'm sure the price is only going up long-term?
---
Rorquals make earning the money effortless and with their numbers, they are driving the plex prices. Sure, there's more things that have similar results but to call those 2 things unrelated? Sorry bro but that's bullshit.
---
Got a link to that by chance?
---
The drugs that made injectors work on high sp characters from the Christmas event cleaned out most of the skill injector stockpile. Injector prices spiked and plex and extractor prices have followed.
---
tfw you dont check dscan and die with cap guns.
---
&gt; with 1 rorq you should be able to make... 250-350M an hour easily.
---
How? Please, tell me.
---
What are you expecting him to do? Admit CCP is completely incompetent?
---
JUST START PUSHING BUTTONS AND THROWING LEVERS. 
---
AT RANDOM.

Don't give the turboautists time to catch up. Invalidate the meta on a weekly basis. This benefits CCP too because you'll have to spend trillions on skill injectors a month to keep up with "optimum" balance. Bonus, it makes just as much sense as applying a single balance pass a year.

As I see you have never been in such a situation and assuming your flair is not bait you never will be the solo ActiveTank-Dread reinforcing/killing structures. 
---
He would have died with HAW-Guns too, his objective was the citadel, not some subcaps. If he has aggression from shooting the citadel, even watching dscan would not make it possible to refit. Just stop posting, you make yourself look very "limited".
---
This is actually interesting but there is also few questions i need to ask :              
---
* does this include all regions                 
---
* are citadels included in this               
---
Considering that when he wrote this Capri was still convinced that shield supercaps were utterly useless, I believe the correct interpretation is that we should buff shield supers.
---
fuck off with your shitty bait.
---
Small pp ok?
---
It's more thier fault for inventing injectors, at least without injectors they'd have time to react since they're slow at balancing. 
---
Cant macro situational awareness
---
&gt; So what your saying is that those hundreds of specialized, multiboxing Rorqual accounts have no effect on the price of plex?
---
Not actually what I said but whatever.
---
&gt; Do you presume they are all being paid for by real money? 
---
That’s a demand side question. Unless those rorquals are being paid for on paid subs. Which still actually doesn’t address the fact that supply is drying up more than demand is increasing.
---
&gt; The demand is high and the supply is dropping, because why sell now if the price is skyrocketing?
---
Half of this is right and half of this suggests large scale PLEX sellers are somehow either colluding to drive up prices or are magically market morons. Both of those sound less plausible to me than that large scale plex sellers are sitting on stockpiles until other factors settle down.
---
&gt; Why would I sell them now if I'm sure the price is only going up long-term?
---
Ugh. This mentality is draining. If isk inflates at a faster pace than your plex increases in value then you lose money by sitting on that plex rather than investing in other assets. This recent spike of plex pricing historically falls outside the trends that would suggest it is a new normal which means you should sell sooner rather than later...unless there are extenuating outside factors that prevent you from doing so or you’re aware of otherwise unforeseen future events which would force this to be a new normal. This isn’t rocket science. It’s not even elite PvP.
---
&gt; Rorquals make earning the money effortless and with their numbers, they are driving the plex prices. Sure, there's more things that have similar results but to call those 2 things unrelated? Sorry bro but that's bullshit.
---
Rorquals are a 30b isk investment each. On normal ore we’re talking 250-300 hours with no loss to break even. Meanwhile there’s much more lucrative ways of earning that scale of money or more without a massive investment and huge amounts of on-field risk. But sure, rorquals are definitely why there’s less plex being sold today than there was 60d ago. Totally related.
---
As you say, CCP knew it. There are players who believe that CCP is a stupid little kid, not knowing the consequences of their actions. Ha. Hahaha. 
---
Implying that EVE actually gets new players.
---
Of those 26k characters logged in how many are multiboxxed alts and how many are actual people? If the number of actual players is above half of that shown on the concurrent character value, i would be very surprised.
---
double klick in space. its literally the first thing the tutorial teaches you.
---
yes, youre not wrong. but doing this after only nine months of playing is pretty cool.
---
Really autism is to blame. you all know it.
---
No, they won't. Saddly...
---
Unlike random shield super speculation from before many actual fights had played out in practice, the balance changes most people want to see from CCP are based on shit that's been actually happening in game for years.  Shit that's driven a good number of people away from the game.
---
I think plenty of people are in the same boat as you and probably don't see the problems because they're never faced with them.
---
For years and years I was always in a big alliance, or an alliance that was part of a big coalition. My exposure to PVP was always as part of a 100+ fleet with an FC telling us all what to do and when to do it. No personal responsibility, no stress, just pressing a few buttons in big fights with hundreds of other people. And for a long time that was perfectly ok, because I wasn't really playing for the PVP. I was playing to be part of a group, carving out my little production niche in the alliance, drunken mining ops on comms and so on. Our fleets didn't get wiped out by caps because we never went anywhere without our own caps standing by, and everyone knew that. So I never saw these problems. 
---
But at some point most people get bored of being another cog in the wheel, so they look for new challenges. Those who like leadership roles move up in the alliance, maybe they become FCs or directors. Maybe they even start their own corp. Others focus on running alliance level production or logistics, typical empire building stuff. Others follow big isk making, getting hard into trading or running tons of alts to make tons of isk.
---
Some are drawn to PVP. Not listening to an FC tell you what to do, but PVP where *you* are responsible for what you're doing. Every fight you have to think about what to do, when to do it, how to do it. Make a mistake and maybe you lose a ship, maybe your friends lose ships. Make a clutch boosh or land damps at the right moment to save someone and you're a hero for 5 minutes. Endless room for self improvement and the freedom to do what you want, fly what you want. It's great. 
---
Well that whole ecosystem is fucked by the cap/subcap problem, for reasons that have been explained hundreds of times by people more eloquent than me. So what do PVP pilots have to look forward to? Shit even the AT is gone. If you can't aspire to "elite PVP" as a PVP player then what's the point? The result is dozens of PVP corps are now dead, most of the best PVP pilots have quit. HK turned into a fucking nullsec rental empire. Even the last bastions of nullsec small gang like Goryn Clade are dead now. A few wormhole corps are left fighting exclusively in wormholes, Inner Hell is still around but they're weirdo Russians, that's about it. It's genuinely sad.
---
tl;dr: I'm an elite PVPer and I'm salty as fuck.
---
Holy shit that's never occured to me, only came back a few months ago
---
When does TEST deployment start please ?
---
That spike only wiped out the stockpiles because skillfarming had become unprofitable in the runup to it. Your facts are correct but that still suggests either there’s less skillfarms today and this less demand pressure on plex, or that skill injectors are going to return to their earlier prices outside of the limited effects of market memory.
---
Neither of those account for reduced plex supply that can be seen currently in the data but fuck it I’m done. You guys can go do your own regressions and draw your own data. Or just keep blaming rorquals like that makes more sense than a disruptive environment in the primary offshore market for pilot services trading.
---
Interesting. I might try to do that.
---
It's not really a problem of being easy or not imo. You have to bring consequent forces to bring down a Rorqual or a Super, and that's normal. The problem as I see it is more that a fleet of 50 Bombers can be tanked by a Rorqual easy and driven away by nerds sending in a full fleet of Titans and Supers.
---
I don’t think so, at least not when I started because the tutorial forced you to dock before you could get to the stage where you could skip it.
---
no the trigs where a example of what just simply adding a new thing adding can do to the meta as a whole, they appear to be balanced fairly well, but still disrupted the meta a good bit    
---
what im saying is that you cant just tweak numbers on one ship based on its metrics, but balance it in defferend, more indipended ways so changing one ship does not make an entire race useless / op 
---
Not all. See my reply to someone else below. 
---
Unfortunately we have an ever increasing crowd of newer generation people here however who have an attitude like they have to cover up or block out anything that remotely effects their weird little bubble of happy feelings that leads to this fucked form of denialism and crying for censorship of anything that makes them uncomfortable, whether it is mentions of history or simply those who disagree with their overvalued personal "opinions" on matters (With no comprehension of how quickly that leads to the same sort of extreme attitudes and views they find uncomfortable).
---
Remembering the awful things he did and what lead to his rise to power is indeed incredibly important if anyone hopes to avert it happening again, and that will not be achieved by silencing anyone, even if it is this silly edgy player he got offended by.
---
I'd also quickly point out again that I doubt OP would have been able to attribute the quote to Hitler without his name nailed on right there next to it, nor would I have in all fairness or another I mentioned this silly thread to.
---
More likely is that OP got his space possessions trashed by this guy and saw the name in the bio and thinks he can somehow get revenge or get them banned through his whining here while pretending to do "good".
---
Whoever downvoted this is just projecting.
---
Would be hard to implement anyways, after years of no limit.  
---
How would you compensate, or try to calm down, the people that had 5 accs for years, let alone 30 or more?  
---
Personally i think allowing alts /multiboxing at all in the past was the biggest mistake CCP ever made, but if they were to impose a limit on it now, it would be a huge middle finger to what? A third of the playerbase? More?
---
Thanks captain obvious. In his post the guy explain all the higher order of 2k+ plex are made so you still control the market eve if there is a high demand or you sleep, I'm so amaze a neophyte like me know more than the average spodbrain about marketing in eve... 
---
by not buying with isk or buying with real money you decrease the demand of plex on the market, when supply is higher than demand prices usualy drop
---
I'm gonna be riiiiiiiiich!
---
The fact that CCP hasn't really revisited rorqual balance since the multiple capital ancil shield repper changes makes me believe that at this point it's a design feature. The people in the game generating the most revenue for CCP are the people using or relying on rorquals as the anchor of their local economy. Nerfing it directly hurts bottom line, and is it likely to bring many other players back? Not really. It's a no win choice for CCP. 
---
My guess, more recipes than information
---
We never get any info out of the summit minutes, its all just NDA
---
Lol goons pets complaining about a upercap umbrella. 
---
Also, Init decide to come, we didn't invite your or anything. If you don't enjoy your deployment you can go somewhere else with an alliance of your side. 
---
Still the easiest isk in the game. How much clicking over how many hours do you have to do to make 25b with a couple rorquals? 
---
&gt; They need to be killable under super umbrellas with bomber squads,  **otherwise you are just giving another bonus** to having your Rorq in Goon  space or somewhere similar. 
---
So using your ship as a member of an organized alliance is working as intended. People that protect their space actually see their members benefit from it. 
---
I mean, what kind of insanity is this? /s
---
everyone laughing their asses off over you guys chestbeating for evicting a few dozen semi inactives from a wh is hardly what i would consider salt mate. 
---
One way is to double click in space, to make the ship fly in the direction of the clicked location.
---
But I personally prefer hitting Q and going into movement mode. You click once to set your destination in the horizontal plane and then you can adjust your vertical direction. This makes it easy to execute precise maneuvers.
---
This guy EVEs
---
&gt; yeah, imma keep 15 boxing rorqs and other fun activities k thx.
---
I'm out of touch with players these days
---
lmao, obviously you dont spend enough time in Wh&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; relic and ghost sites when you find some and you plex your account easy man
---
Having unkillable pve ships without a full super deployment is not a healthy state for the game.
---
Sure, it's great if you're in said null bloc, but do we really want all rorqs in the game to join one null bloc? Is that where we want nullsec to head?
---
So you are that retarded ? Do you know there is people in the world who control some market ? Quick example for oil : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Oil but the difference is, compare to real world, EVE do not have commercial law like real life does, if you got the money, you can buy everything on the market and sell it at YOUR price, that's what this small group do. On a final note, basics of marketing in video game is "control the market" find an item that sell well or something and try to control it market, that's how I get rich in video games usually(beside eve grrr I'm so bad at eve), so no, you are a moron if when someone tell you we live in a capitalist world you react "duuuh illuminati/reptilian", and because sadly our world have so much sad dead brain : /u/IPeedOnTrumpAMA work for you too buddy 
---
This. PANIC really does need a nerf. It was supposed to be this safety net for a mining fleet, not an immediate halt to aggression.
---
PANIC should not effect the rorq itself, only the mining subcaps around it. Also, if you're using a PANIC, remove the ability to activate a cyno. Similar to how a carrier cannot use an NSA and ewar simultaneously. Rescue should have some effort associated with it.
---
On a similar related note, inhibs need to have a resist profile and reduced activation. There is only so much DPS it can handle, and a single capital or a small number of subs can alpha through any buffer/reps and eventually take it down despite best efforts.
---
Get a t1 scanning ship for the large cargo bay, fit warp stabs in the lows, mwd and shield buffer in the mids so you don't get killed by smart bombers and maybe t1 salvagers for if you find t2 wrecks. Hyperspatial rigs so speed up the journey. Drop stuff in a high sec station once in a while just in case and pick it all up later with an industrial. You can upscale later to an instawarp ceptor and do the same thing in null where there are more wrecks. 
---
&gt; 250-350M an hour easily
---
those are old mineral prices bubba
---
Ummmmmmmm, 1 Rorq requires the same number of clicks as 50 Rorqs if you are doing it right. Argument invalid.
---
Well, botting is not needed. But multiboxing in wow is not practical, since there are hundreds of bots that will outdo everything you do.
---
And I'm not just talking out of my ass, I had a lot of contacts in different webpages of buying/selling gold. That's how most people gets gold in WoW
---
Tldr
---
and not everyone want to invest in plex market or at least play with it 24/7 some prefer ammo, module or resources, some other like do it with plex, they are not a lot and not working together too, I try to find the reddit post, I trough it was made by Ichooseyou but looks like it's not him (or he delete it) 
---
fuck i'm a moron
---
how do you get 1k dps? 
---
what year is it?
---
correct
---
skillfarm your main
---
Calm your tits??? Wow.....
---
Yeah, there's a community etc but in all my carreer, if I told a customer to 'calm there tits' I would have been fired straight away.
---
Awesome professionalism CCP Falcon, well done.
---
You do realize most of those include groups dropping caps, kinda the problem everyone is complaining about. 
---
I agree with you there but see it as a slightly tangent point; I personally think both Caps AND cynos need a second look, along with cyno inhibs (why the fuck don't they have resists?)
---
I think rorqs should be safe OR be great isk printers; ideally I really think they should just take them back to buffing barge fleets, idk why they added excavator drones at all.
---
&gt; That being said, i also buy plex from ccp and sell it, so yes everyone else, keep plexing shit. Makes my plex sell higher.
---
&gt; 
---
I mean, if you are paying $130 monthly for 15 accounts to just mine and do "other fun things," why don't you just work another hour or two so you don't have to mine and just do "other fun things?"
---
Pay $ 2 mine 2 pay ISK 4 fun things
---
Why not just Pay $ ~~2 mine 2 pay ISK~~ 4 fun things
---
Our scout was cloaked. We bridged I’m so can’t really fault him for that. 
---
thats pretty nutty ngl
---
4 faction/abyssal damage mod + one t2 rig, fury missile, all V skill and the +9% damage drug 
---
The dishonesty in saying someone couldn't possible want AT AND balance changes is a statement on its own. Plus it was CCPs own words that they were going to give up AT to focus on balance, so where is that now? or is the new party line that Eve is totally impossible to balance? 
---
Lastly noone seriously said it was ok to sacrifice balance for AT, or vice-versa for that matter.
---
You're an actual dishonest shitstain. 
---
Not the chain's OP, but that statement you rephrased his into seems to line up pretty well.
---
Admittedly my evidence is anecdotal, but there is a steep increase in my circles of people trying to avoid paying for accounts with the increased skepticism in the game. (Seriously, I really hope we see some good changes soon because Im reduced to bleeding SP on my main to make plex month to month). That is both an increase in demand, a decrease in plex supply (as they're not buying plex for "roaming around money") and sure, the faucets are wide open. Ratting supers didn't exist before, multiboxing "new rorqs" didn't exist before, So sure, we're seeing downward price pressure by flooding the market with supply, but plex is going through the roof because people are really concerned with the direction the game has gone. 
---
I understand you can't talk about anything you heard from the CSM summit. I'm not asking for that. I'm hoping you and your fellow councilors carried that message loudly to CCP.
---
Hobbies are hobbies.  Some cost more than others.  By your logic, working harder to make money to pay for sports gear to play in something you might not win and might injure yourself permanently is a bit sad.  You could apply that logic to anything, but why bother?
---
Brain isn't capitalized REEEEEEEEEE
---
Having bigger payroll based on someones location is basically a fraud. Please send all your money to poor african princess. /s/s
---
I originally quit when it passed 350m, the inflation is pretty astonishing. Probably due to incursions and the isk train there, thats about the time it started to take off.
---
So now "doing it right" is input broadcasting?
---
Lmfao the state of this shithole.
---
Ez, dont get hit
---
Well 20 accounts limit could limit some extreme players only and affected the huge skill farms.     
---
Sure many players could be affected, but reasonably 99% of affected people could point those 20 accounts they want leave, and in terms of compensation - ability to recover all skillpoints from those accounts (even with the use of extractors ... but to 0 sp ) could make many people happy enough. 
---
I guess we'll find out once we have the full report of the CSM session that just took place. If we were a year back and I knew that CCP was still independent, I'd say there is hope, but now that CCP belongs to Pearl Abyss, nothing is sure at all. I am a former Black Desert Online player and I know what PA is capable off, and they are totally capable of showing a middle finger to the EVE community as long as it brings them money.
---
Windscribe its free
---
You typed this with your lizard brain.
---
Same argument a decade ago.
---
But if you change that mechanic, you get super battleship blob drops.  Change that mechanic you get super brutix blob drops.  Change that mechanic you get super ishtar blob drops, and so on and so on.
---
The entire cyno mechanic needs to be changed.  Cynosaural fields need a little random instability introduced.  If you're going to light a cyno, there needs to be a chance that not everything makes it through.  It could be 100 ships make it through, and then it collapses.  It could be 10 ships make it through, and then it collapses.  And one cyno per fleet per 5 minute timer per system.
---
You want to drop 20 supers on a field?  Well, there's a chance only 2 will make it through.  And then survive for 5 minutes, or bite the dust.
---
Now, will everyone have their own personal cyno in a system to ensure they make it through?  Yes.  But at least you'll know it's coming.  And not everyone will be that coordinated all the time, or be able to move their alts quick enough all the time.  It will introduce enough chaos to make everyone think twice about whether they want to actually field a super beforehand if there's a chance they'll be the only one to make it through.
---
Fix rorqual is relative easy, just replace or reclassify rorqual as battleship, and remove all the panic industry core thing altogether.
---
Capital ratting is different through. i think the only way is to make NPC fleeing or stop spawning the anomaly when capital jump into it.
---
But you pointed reasons why 'it will be bad' yourself, soo......      
---
I remember selling some.sort of 2 month cert for 500m
---
The Code was cute when it was in its infancy fighting the good fight against miners, but when efforts shifted to just ganking everything passing through uedama it got stale in a hurry.
---
"Oh boy, another freighter gank.  Yawn."
---
Hats off to the people who stick to the tennets of the original Code.  Had lots of laughs following their exploits in defence of the space rocks.
---
&gt;&gt;Half of this is right and half of this suggests large scale PLEX sellers are somehow either colluding to drive up prices or are magically market morons. Both of those sound less plausible to me than that large scale plex sellers are sitting on stockpiles until other factors settle down.
---
Why wouldn't they want to collude? If they have enough liquid ISK to buy enough plex to influence prices long-term, why wouldn't they do just that? Because they need money?
---
&gt;&gt;Ugh. This mentality is draining. If isk inflates at a faster pace than your plex increases in value then you lose money by sitting on that plex rather than investing in other assets. This recent spike of plex pricing historically falls outside the trends that would suggest it is a new normal which means you should sell sooner rather than later...unless there are extenuating outside factors that prevent you from doing so or you’re aware of otherwise unforeseen future events which would force this to be a new normal. This isn’t rocket science. It’s not even elite PvP.
---
Effortless, lazy, safe, these are the words that could be helpful here. Asset prices fluctuate all the time, plex price goes up long-term. It's like comparing savings bonds to the stock exchange. One gives you pretty certain increase in value with little effort, the other has potential to give you much, much more, but requires a lot of effort and is risky. I opt for the safer option. Sure, I'm no market-PvPer but I imagine so is the majority of Eve players. If you can handle investing in assets and make profit - good for you. I don't give two shits about it tbh. 
---
&gt;&gt; Rorquals are a 30b isk investment each. On normal ore we’re talking 250-300 hours with no loss to break even. Meanwhile there’s much more lucrative ways of earning that scale of money or more without a massive investment and huge amounts of on-field risk. But sure, rorquals are definitely why there’s less plex being sold today than there was 60d ago. Totally related.
---
You are probably correct, what this means is that it's a tough start but as you are no doubt aware, they scale very well. So while starting your first or second account is large investment, the more you have, the less impact you feel. Add to this the fact that with the amount of money they're making you probably don't pay subscriptions with $$$  but with plex and there you go, immense demand for plex. As for the supply, we've tackled that one before.
---
&gt; Want an advice on how to make Eve more enjoyable? Pay for it. Sub it on steam or even use a normal, CCP sub. Eve isn't worth the amount of time you need to grind ISK for gametime.
---
Back in 2010 or so, I tried the Plex grind. I think it was ~300mil at the time. I was in college with limited income, so it sounded like a good idea.
---
It was such a slog. I was dualbox mining with a Hulk and Orca in highsec (which was prob my biggest mistake). It was like having a second job. I gave up after a week, because I wasn't enjoying the game anymore. It was no longer relaxing and chill, since I *had to* dedicate 2-3hrs per evening to Plex *one* account. Since it would take me most of the month to get there, what time was left to make money for the things I wanted and to actually play the game? I would have to grind the month away, just so I could afford the next month, which I'd have to grind that month for the following month, so on and so forth. Joy.
---
Some online buddies, who are largely in the same boat today as I was back then, are thinking about doing the Plex grind. I told them to be careful. While we're all in null, and the opportunities for making money are better (VNI ratting for example), it can still suck the enjoyment out of the game quickly. It's one thing to grind so you can buy that next ship you want; it's another to grind just so you can afford to grind again next month.
---
&gt;soon  
---
Coming from CCP this could mean anything from tomorrow to shortly after the Earth is vaporized by the death of our sun.
---
This is true. I usually buy a $250 or $500 package, or $100 at the least, when they have plex sales. This time around, they canceled the AT then were like, here, have the shittiest plex sale in history because fuck our customers. 
---
I could have used the ISK this time around, but refrained from buying this time out of principal because, like you guys said, fuck a 10% off sale, fuck not having fan fest, and fuck not having the AT. 
---
Can confirm, spent over an hour being bumped in an empty Orca before AG swooped in.
---
I'm not even mad, I've never seen a bump fleet so it was pretty funny watching a group of people bump a ship not making any money in the first place. Surprised a gank wasnt the punchline. 
---
How come it is not decreasing though, shouldn't the people supplying PLEX end up reducing their prices in order to be competitive? 
---
Minerals yes, ice no. If you want quick isk then its essentially hopping around mining ice then either selling in null, if prices are down, then reprocess and send it up to Jita. Stating that a JF costs hurt margin isnt really the case if you subtract 100M but gain a few bill. Ice mine with 15 rorqs you'll kill the ice belt in less than 30 minutes move onto the next, start a 4 hour timer, run out of ice fields go PvP, repeat. Not that complicated if you know how to make isk...
---
It's still almost 2 billion to sub an account for a month if you buy PLEX.
---
You're just jelly that you couldn't join init mercenaries when you had to leave those PL scrubs because they were bad at the game. (Your flair gives it away)
---
I also heard you all couldn't meet test minimum standards for standing desks and had your app rejected by progod himself with a wing bone.
---
I can see you’ve played knifey spoony before! 
---
Unfortunately, that is not always an option :(
---
You do that then. I do it. People who do that don't complain about plex prices. But then again, those who complain may be unable to affort a subscription for instance.
---
Hey you're that self-important noob that cried in the other thread about monthly ELO because you were only number 25 on the list? LOL
---
Feels bad to be shit but it feels even worse to be bad and think you're good. I know for sure you think yourself of the pinnacle of solo PVP when in reality, you "don't even play the game anymore". (but still release videos :thinkingface:) 
---
My personal gut feeling on this is that skill farming is having a larger effect than some people think, due to the 'ease' of scaling it. And that's a difficult one to fix, without removal of injectors. 
---
The CSM have concerns (I don't *think* any of them will object) about the price of PLEX, and how it's rising. We don't believe it's a crisis yet, but that's not a reason to not act. (acting before something becomes a crisis, to avert the crisis, is generally a good idea ;) )
---
I can't speak for what CCP believes on this, or anything which may have been discussed at the summit. (The NDA is somewhat pesky in this regard.) 
---
So i tried it this morning. The plex prices stay the same no matter what location you use. I tried brazil russia and south africa. I used nord vpn and the currencies changed on the store but when i converted to dollars it was all about the same. 
---
The only difference is in the subscription prices. They were like 4 dollars cheaper but the downside is the subscription that is bought on the Steam store can only be used on an account that was created using Steam. 
---
So youd have to create a new steam account for the country you picked then use a the vpn to create the account. Then you’d probably have to keep using the vpn when you played with that account. Its really just not worth it at that point. 
---
that's one of the reasons why you don't hide your passive modules ,-)
---
If it's just number change it won't driven people away. What driven people away mostly are complex game design issue.
---
&gt;They should be safe
---
This is a result of player actions. Not CCP.
---
&gt; OR they should be great isk makers 
---
This is also a result of player actions, see 1st, and add in the infrastructure and logistics that make this possible.
---
&gt; but they shouldn't be both; nothing should, that's why EVE used to be based on risk-reward. 
---
Risking the individual ships in a supercapital umbrella to protect alliance mates, and thus benefiting from it is EXACTLY the definition of risk-reward. 
---
&gt; Having unkillable pve ships without a full super deployment ...
---
So, you speak about risk-reward, but do not want to commit any sizeable risk, yet want to reap the reward...understood.
---
True. The Excavators are just way too squishy and slow for their price.
---
Holy fuck the irony of a Frat member saying there aren't that many bots. I love this subredddit.
---
Exactly same boat. I have a bunch of accounts primed at alpha stage that I wanted to get started to be extra fax and dread alts, but I really could not be bothered with the price of PLEX at the moment. 
---
Will probably wait and see if the Galaxy packs ever go on sale again. Who knows with CCPs current strategy if that will be the case.

did you tried pyfa for other missiles? DPS sure is nice, but with rapid lights there is always the risk of not killing your opponent with one reload...

I'd say he hit it reasonably (positive karma, after all). Not a bare 'calm your tits', but reworded to show that it's playful.

Or would you prefer that CCP was entirely corporate with us?

This is Reddit where no one looks at the source material and everyone is wrong.
---
If you got yourself sucked into this game, and put all this time and effort into it just to quit because price has inflated, and the game has changed. It might just be those loyal players whom feel like they deserve whatever it is they feel like they do from CCP because of said loyalty, and are just having a salty fit about it. It's a game that was made to drive profit, and not to cater to players emotions. Eve has been "dying" for 11 years since I started the game, and for it sure seems like it's still alive, and kicking even with all these people crying a salty river. Gonna be here till the server closes, so I can say the server is dead when it's actually dead.
---
You must have hit some kind of sale market low then. When Plex launched they were about 300m/ea.
---
So why keep capital in belt when it's clearly problematic. Also people shouldn't force to have 50 man fleet to have fun. This has zero chance of fix if the best ming ship is capital.

While I don't like answering for others, I'm pretty confident, in this case, the answer would be something along the lines of No.

Lol all these spodbrains claiming that its good CCP takes time with changes... but taking years to carry out simple changes is just fucking dumb.
---
No whole concept of mining need to be looked at and reworked (but this will never happen - you know $$$$$$$) do you know that current build price for supercarrier is similar to full implant set for one before burner missions where introduced?        
---
hey we aren't lizards okay
---
But with heavies or hams there's always the isk of not applying.
---
I like the idea of not letting Rorquals control their own excavators. Make them have to assign the drones, one-to-one, to mining barges for them to work. Then for every Rorqual in the anomaly you need five mining barges. 
---
The Rorqual returns to being a boosting ship for fleets of other mining ships instead of the only mining ship used. Targets are more varied. New players are encouraged to join their allied mining fleets.
---
Usually if you firesale it for jita buy -asset safety cost it will sell within the hour. If you get it to lowsec you still have to pay pushx to move it. Or spend time moving it yourself.

I'm pretty sure that's part of the problem, they didn't teach this in highschool.

I too came for the comments! 
---
Yeah I'm surprised it wasn't in Excel with formuli
---
... so do you think that milking the whales is the better financial strategy than having a larger paying customer base?
---
&gt; you cannot lose ISK at it at any point.
---
this is the main issue. PLEX is a safe long term store of assets. CCP aims for slow but continuous inflation. If CCP instead allowed periods of deflation, there would be slight risk in holding PLEX as long term store of wealth.
---
what's with the amount of shit-talk?
---
did i miss something?
---
I mean, you can down vote me all you want. I have 3 accounts that I pay for and I made 30 billion with them over the last month. 
---
You can make similar amounts of isk with 6 or 7 plexed Rorqual alts and grinding them for half the month; however, *fair enough* if you are person who literally cannot afford to, or just doesn't want to, spend real money on character subs. 
---
There really is not a wrong way to play eve. I am just pointing out that you do not *need* to have a whole bunch of alts to make isk with high skill point characters. Frankly speaking, I could just sub one account, transfer my trader alt to it, and easily make 10 billion a month updating my orders twice a day. 
---
So do you get to loot the wreck afterwords, or does it just kick you back out
---
 There is a fine line with customer service.  At no point EVER should a customer be allowed to walk all over a company/employee with the "customer is always right" bullshit, because, that is a poor business model to follow.  His response was measured and involved humor.  There was nothing wrong with what he said. 
---
Come back when you have customer service experience.
---
Why would we want them to go down? I want more isk per hour for real life grind.

With just 50mn quad lif mwd on both, nothing else, Deimos is 200m/s faster than a Cerberus before heat.

In an enclosed area with a competent Deimos pilot, he should easily (but it may take some time) catch a Cerberus.

I saw someone in delve using a titan to bridge his 9 alts in freighters [the names were obvious alts]. Carebearing to the max

Yeah people dropping $100 on plex is a common as bhaalgorn bpc’s.

Changing the numbers in a database is easy. What the article forgets is that changing the numbers in the database is only the last step in a process - before you change the numbers, you have to decide what changes to make. And given that incredible breadth and complexity of interactions that the article points out, that's not a trivial task. Everything touches everything else, and for most of the problems in the game it isn't trivially obvious exactly how the numbers should be changed. That's what requires developer time and effort - not typing the number in the database, but figuring out which particular numbers need to be changed and how to change them to nudge the ecosystem in the desired direction.
---
Woooooosshhhhhhhh
---
Some rorqs die, therefore my argument is "completely refuted"...
---
No, you're right though, mineral deflation is not a thing, or the soon-approaching 4m isk a plex prices.
---
Really? Did players add PANIC modules into the game? Or design the almost entirely useless cyno inhibs?
---
I'm saying the group i used to FC, Chief, etc. for (TVP) is dead these days except for vanguards which shows that the isk/time maximizers all went to nullsec because with the same skills they can for less effort fly rorquals and carriers instead.
---
It's hard to distinguish nullsec from nullsec incursions word wise how i did it above but nullsec incursions make easily 3-4 sites an hour for HQs with...bigger toys. (which is 135-180m/h before lp; lp = 30-40k.
---
Even though for supers it's still better just to go super ratting nullsec incursions are mostly a social occasion for many.
---
There is so much here that it is wrong, that I'm just going to tell you to get good, or learn about the game before posting.  Either that, or just quit bitching that you are getting dunked with a fleet that costs 1/10th of your target.
---
Barges cost significantly less than a Rorqual.  A (properly) fitted Rorqual with drones will run you around 10 bil.  Not these 8 bil shitfits, but actual fitting it right.  That, of course, means it should be harder to kill. 
---
It's not impossible. You just need a good Corp that helps new players. With the right salvage ship and a hand full of ratters who are not interested in salvaging, you can easily get this money together in 2 weeks.
---
You will get your copy of the minutes once you submit your golden ticket, overpriced roid minerals , and 13M isk....
---
and they'll still be probably garbage.
---
I got the impression he paid for all 15 with an hour of OT. It's probably an exaggeration but I could fund 15 accounts with 2.5 in OT per month, so it's not that difficult to do.
---
So the only way to have fun is to drop a Rorqual?  You can't have fun killing other things if you have a smaller fleet?
---
CCP no longer needs the bi-weekly 40-50% off Galaxy packs etc. That is the real reason supply has dried up. Are there many people willing to pay full price after being spoiled for a year? We'll see if CCP is still interested in artificially deflating those markets or if they've achieved their objective in selling out. Ichooseyou dumped his supply of 1300 MPTC and it barely forced the market down for a few days. The PLEX supply dried up due that Extraction Augmentor event item. 
---
We have all been there and done that

This is either the dumbest post of the week, or some of the best live bait I've seen.

75 Rorqs were killed in the last 7 days. How many unique rorqs do you think were actively mining in the last 7 days?
---
Alliance tournament. Ive been playing for 10 years now, and it just feels wrong with out the at.
---
Dude, allay your areolas
---
That's exactly the same as in eve, though. Even multiboxing rorqs are nothing compared to what bots get. Such is the nature of bots, y'know? They literally have more time, hence why they earn more. Comparing multiboxing to bots is irrelevant. That's like comparing a professional CSGO cheater with a blatant wallhacker+aimbot. Of course the legit player is not gonna have a chance.
---
Comparing multiboxing with botting is useless. You should instead compare multiboxing to *real, legit* venues of play. And as it happens to be in both WoW and EvE, multiboxing is superior to singleboxing in the majority of situations.
---
As with regards to income, the most "practical", or time efficient, if you will, is always to do passive income methods. In WoW, that means playing the auction house, either flipping short term or long term.

Flairs aren't verified by anyone, relax, you too can wear any flair you like

This is such bullshit. Do you **need** to have 16 rorquals because the other guy has 15? For what? Why are you competing in a race that you don't enjoy?
---
The definition of "compete" isn't winning 100% of everything. If you **need* to be the Supreme Winner in eve you're just setting yourself up for failure.
---
why can a human not rat with 20 ishtars?
---
If your system is so broken that you can't change a few damage/application numbers then why the fuck should I pay money for your product?
---
&gt; I’ve had 2-3 sites yield 500m+. 
---
When was that? I did score a ~700m faction tower BPC once, and this one time 3.7b worth of 'Augmented' bpc's from a drone data site escalation, and a couple of times ~400m from talocan wrecks in wormholes. All of those things are worth way less now, it seems there are no more of such jackpots to be had.
---
I do enjoy mining, industry, and PI actually. 
---
Fills the time between fleets. I don't enjoy gate camps, so i mess around with indy stuff instead of solo roams and gate camping.
---
&gt; without removal of injectors. 
---
The mechanics to mitigate the issue already exist in Alpha injectors. If there was a max of 500K SP injected per week, you'd cause demand to drop significantly (This is more a guess than a statement of fact but it would make zero to rorq in an hour impossible).
---
I like mining.

Your lack of industry knowledge is disturbing. You're lucky to get 90 mil an hour. Also, i don't bot and am usually watching tv or bull shitting on comms or playing another game while mining. So shit is FAR from optimal or efficient. I'm lucky if i make 1.2 bil per hour, if that.

I don't ice mine with rorqs. I ice mine with a rorq and retreivers. Ice mining with 15 rorqs? That's asking for dead excavators, so I dont make close to that ice mining.

Wait Wait Wait... Hold up. People are mad that Player service items are HIGH in price? They want these things to go DOWN in price? What the actual fucking fuck what?

Wait seriously... What? 
---
You realize if the value of these items goes down, you won't make as much isk when you sell them. I... I got nothing. 
---
don't let your memes be dreams
---
I sit on like 50 B ISK worth of plex. 
---
Don't know where you got the idea that expensive has to = hard to kill. Expensive can mean more versatility, utility or increased yields, it does not have to mean hard to kill. If rorqs were changed back to more of a utility role and their PANIC removed I'd have no issue reducing their build cost.
---
FACTS! These items are too easy to afford. If we drive the price up it will be less viable for people to have thousands of alts unless those people are talented or they wallet warrior. 
---
It’s worth neither the grind nor the money, but to each their own I guess

So let me get this straight.. people that want to Plex their accounts Want the people that Can Plex their accounts to stop plexing their accounts so that they can then Plex their accounts with less effort. Ok.
---
RIP  minnow.    Next ones named "HMS mistakes were made" 
---
This is why I stopped grinding fir idk and just went pay to win. It's far cheaper and far more enjoyable to spent a few hours wages on Plex than it is to solo grind my one character for three months. 
---
Then I just quit playing entirely because there's not really anything left to do. Even wormhole space and no asset safety loses its appeal when you realise the loot you get is worthless in the grand scheme.

And the Hacking game is cool

Usually, there's only 1 bumper from the gankers. If you had two bumpers, one was probably an antibumper that tried to bump you into warp or back to a station or gate, or to slow you down.
---
Orca bumps are pretty fun because the orca can really get some speed.  
---
If you had valuables, you probably would have been ganked, they probably had better targets. Gank fleet needs to dock up for 15 minutes after every gank to wait out timers. 
---
They probably also kept you bumped because it tied up the antigank fleet.
---
Actually mining dont change the price only isk sources like ratting or missions will change the raw amount of necessary isk.
---
But a nerv of them will just change the amount of in future farm able money. So all can get lesser money which means that everything get slowly cheaper. Which is a problem. Cause already rich player will be rich still to old measurements so some items will be for long time only be available for the already super rich player.
---
Ok on someway mining change the price cause supers get more cheap relative to available isk. With supers more cheap the rating income is higher so the available isk. Got solution to interrupt this circle is to shoot more super.
---
A better way is maybe just have a larger isk sink somewhere.
---
Or just to accept that if you want to play the game for free, you have to farm more than the average player want to spent for plex. 
---
Plex price is always demand vs offers. Plus speculations sometimes.
---
So for example if some super rich entity decide that plex demand will rise and offer will shrink than he can buy a lot of plex as speculation.
---
Wow.

 I wouldn't have guessed that!  ☺

&gt; The threat of unsubbing accounts because the price is now circa 2bill is petty frankly, what happens when prices hit 2.4 or 3bill?
---
More people will unsub. This is a video game, not a job. I'm not going to spend increasingly more hours every week grinding isk so I can play a video game, and the reason people are even talking about using PLEX to sub is that more and more people think it's not worth $15 USD to play. 
---
When PLEX was 1-1.5b, lots of people were willing to grind a few hours a week to make the isk each month. Those people are not willing to rorqual mine or spin up SP farms to get 2b+ per month. They were never willing to pay $15 USD. Stop telling people to grind more to play the game. Most people in eve that find PvE boring (which, in my experience, is a huge number of people) are leaving. Telling them to git gud and just grind harder &amp; better is very fucking stupid advice. 
---

SP farming does not add isk into the game (neither does mining for that matter), if you want to look at inflation sources look to isk faucets.

The entire point is those "just numbers" are part of very complex calculations when you consider bonuses, multipliers, and probably half a dozen other things I'm not thinking of. Saying they are just numbers in a database is the dumbest thing I will read this week.

&gt; Problem:  People are using cerebrals, which don't bring in any IRL cash to CCP.  
---
Problem: I wont bother taking part of events if I don't get cerebrals that are a tiny way of maintaining a semblance of parity with the pay to win crowd. If not having a second rate skill acquisition rate means buying extra things over subscription, then I'm increasingly likely to stop giving CCP any money at all. 
---
Just let us know if its a titan, we'll have to escalate to a Big Shit Recovery Specialist.
---
Actually, yes, if they make themselves indistinguishable from bots.
---
Honestly, if you remove panic from capital ships, you will have a complete reversal of rorque tech. Making them almost useless, is not good for CCP. The isk proliferation also is bad for players, but again good for CCP, and the more expensive things are in game the more plex people have to buy to afford it, and the cycle continues. This is a very high level problem that deals with company politics and real world economics CCP will never change their policy,(fuck players, get money) Eventually this will lead to less new players and the game will die out... if they changed rorques just a bit like by making panic and cyno not operable at the same time... this could be a fix, it wouldn’t prevent gating supers but thats what makes the game fun.

It's common sense, I've had 0 economics related classes
---
How is that is inflation and not just less moon goo being brought into the game?
---
how about a dynamic balance engine. if any ship is constantly under represented in numbers of hours flown per month it gets a random attribute buffed. over represented ships gets a random attribute nerfed.
---
the over time the meta is constantly changing and the people who notice the buff first get to fly it before other pilots jump on the bandwagon.
---
... OK dark dystopia world you live in there mate. I personally enjoy running a small high sec freighter business but I guess one of my chosen playstyles isn't valid in your eyes.... 
---
How many Supers were killed in that time? They don't cost much more that a fit Rorq in the grand scheme of things. Should there be 30 supers a week?
---
You know, I thought about that before posting, but honestly I'd see it being serious in this thread and the way things have been going as of late. 
---
except literally any other fucking video game will also have "bonuses, multipliers, whatever"
---
changing values should never break your system unless your system is poorly implemented
---
If you have a good income source it isn’t hard. I’m in college and supporting 6 accounts with ISK alone, haven’t paid for sub since 2016 or 2017.
---
As if mining is more entertaining, I mean you can also watch Netflix and sperg on Comms with SP-Farm Accounts, you do not need that near2+umbrella protected tabbed out Rorq-Multibox for that.
---
And as written already, 2h Supercarrier ratting make far more clicks and leve you with PTSD. 
---
That doesnt make sense, over supply is what drives prices down. Not under supply. If you want skill injectors to go down in price you need more people making them than those buying them. Supply and demand. 
---
Yes, and calling these "just numbers" in any other video game would be just as stupid. I'd argue that very few games have the sort of complexity that Eve does. Whether that means Eve is "broken" or not is up for debate.
---
Every rorq is a 30b investment from scratch. Only 8-10 of that is the rorqual.
---
It’s not anywhere near as brainless for a human to do as people seem to think.
---
Currently a rorqual before fuel and heavy water costs requires 2b a month assuming it’s not also farming injectors to cover subscription cost. If it is, or is otherwise diversified, that number obviously goes away.
---
If we don’t muddle the numbers, that means a rorq with current ore prices requires 20 hours of mining per week to be self sufficient. Again that cost can be partially or in full subsumed by a diversified account portfolio, which is also true of any active isk making activity. At three rorquals you’re finally making the same money as a single moderately skilled super ratter with the same to twice as much risk on the field, after a 90b isk investment.
---
Once you get past three rorquals or becomes increasingly more difficult to do optimally. Moon mining in rorquals is exceptional profit but also has the downside of scaling much more poorly due to the mechanics of moon mining. As rorquals continue to proliferate they face an issue of scale driving their profitability down further, especially as hisec moons now can produce totally AFKable zero risk nullsec ores.
---
Assuming rorqual pilots are buying plex though, still doesn’t even remotely explain the current surge in plex prices, so why this is even an argument is beyond me except that there’s a ton of people fearmongering about rorquals here.
---
The point is that capri is never as smart as he thinks he is, especially when he is talking about issues with tons of unknowns (like this one).
---
Weren't carriers basically better vnis in terms of is making, though?
---
No, I think you never did SuperCarrier-Ratting
---
Who cares what PLEX prices are. If you want to truly fix Rorquals and Capitals, remove PLEX, go to a standard subscription model. Then you don't have everyone wanting to krab so they play for free, instead, they krab to feed their PvP.
---
In terms of making the game better?  No, milking the whales is absolutely *never* going to be a great way to do it.
---
In terms of understanding your playerbase is made up of a decent amount of people with a decent amount of money that they're willing to throw at your game?  Yeah, that's honestly a better financial strategy than trying to lure people in to f2p game in the hopes that they'll spend money.
---
I mean those don't get posted on reddit/NER.  I've had plenty of good 10v10ish fights recently.
---
yeah, they are "just numbers", a game like league can have 20+ changes to 15 different things once every month but eve can't even get more than 2 patches a year?
---
just because eve is "complex" doesn't mean they're excused for a poor system implementation
---
can you show me how to do this? asking 4 a friend ....
---
I certainly can't justify grinding for hours just for a month of play or an injector or a MPTC. I can work an hour of overtime at my IRL job and pay for just about 3 months of sub, or over a thousand plex. Much easier and then I get to enjoy the game more.
---
The majority component cost for s the extractor, but the price of both the extractor and the farmed SP is 100% based on the Plex consumed to create them.

Wait, are you saying that Rorqs are balanced because of their price? Is this also why most alliances have 1 or 2 titans? Is this why Keepstars are incredibly rare?
---
"insurance was a mistake" 
---
Then he is obviously a garbage one, likely one of the people nonstop saying everything needs to be rewritten because we will get it right this time.
---
I've got a pretty large stash of Plex. Just not using it to sub. My inbox this morning that my sub was about to run out filled it up with all the accounts.
---
What makes you say that? There's nothing inherently inherent to flying a freighter in highsec that would make the pilot a bot-aspirant. 
---
Not at all. Bots in mmos are often in symbiosis with the companys interests. I would be curious to see what percent of bot farms drives plex up and uses the isk privately vs those selling isk on rmt sites.
---
&gt;Stop making skill farm alts, or stop fifteen boxing rorqs.
---
what a dumbfuck thread, me not boxing my 20 accounts has no effect on others doing the same
---
You dont even know.    I'm still finding bookmarks at 0 on gates.  
---
Only grey beards remember those days I'm sure. 
---
you joke but I was once in a keepstar when it was unanchored and found myself floating in space a couple of minutes later coming back from being AFK.
---
We also need the *soft pvp* option. Using it will cause your ship to respawn in jita with all your fittings, rigs and cargo untack in case you die.
---
When it hits 2.4 or 3 billion I'll read about it on reddit. Won't be in game.
---
&gt;(The NDA is somewhat pesky in this regard.)

reduce plex price permanently

In the 20-some years I've worked in software development environments there's a few things I've learned, amongst other things:
---
- More often than not are things are not quite as simple as they look
---
- The trend is developers have the tendency to underestimate the effort and complexities of proper quality assurance 
---
Capri his statement seems a massive oversimplification of the reality of quality assurance in a complex environment such as EVE online. Even if you disregard the behavioral aspects (the rule sets) of ships and modules that impact changing these numbers, there's still the human element to contend with; it's the ingenuity of players in utilizing the modules and ships that plays a large role in balancing. 
---
If you consider the impact of the stats of any ship or module in the EVE universe can echo through and have rather unexpected outcomes, you realize that you need to spend time investigating changes thoroughly. And since changing module stats constantly would potentially be more harmful for maintaining a player base it's not strange that balancing takes time.
---
Skill injection was a mistake.
---
No need to answer, this guy obviously has no clue and just want to look smart (and managed the opposite)
---
Involuntary PVP is about as Eve as it gets.
---
Heres a hint: simple solution to complex problems are usually horrifyingly wrong.
---
Just because eve sucks, and ccp is incompetent dosent mean easy solutions are going to magically fix anything.
---
Yeah, basically looks like just punching each other in the face till one person gets crits.  Abyssmal Arenas are so underwhelming =/
---
GRR NORTH, HAT NORTH

Only aesthetics. If you anchor close to the sun you can get some pretty reflections. But it's also bright as fuck and hurts the eyes.
---
Thats about how far I thought this would go. 
---
the damage control is the rest of the cfc replies
---
dude is in red alliance not the cfc
---
If you watch the movie watch the extended version. I found the original movie with missing scenes quite confusing.
---
we may all shoot each other, some of us may hate each other
---
but this is something we can all agree on, seeing things blow up is truly a beautiful site 
---
Once you enter, there is 30 minutes on the clock to finish the fight.
---
Assuming the fight ends with plenty of time to spare, you can loot the wreck of the player and there is a special loot cache in the middle for the winner as well (about 50m of value on average, from what I have seen).
---
You're not wrong, but I'm not sure League is the best example when you're comparing a 5v5 arena game with 10's of millions of players and a developer with 2500+ employees, vs. a game with potentially thousands vs thousands, a few hundred thousands actual players at best, and a development team of a few hundred if we're lucky? Completely different situations in all aspects. That said, I'm not convinced that the lack of balance changes is really due to complexity so much as it is either just not a priority for CCP, or CCP just doesn't see as much of a problem with balance as some (many?) players do.
---
I agree that 'calm your tits' as a response in other lines of work would be unacceptable but when it comes to online gaming customer service I have found that there isn't really a rule book. Have played games for 20 years and have seen some unbelievable attitude from some game companies and thier mods so nothing really surprised me anymore they are all bad as each other due to most being old or current players of the game.
---
Yeah but you wouldn't need to make so much isk if everyone weren't forced to grind for cap alts just to be relevant today. 
---
I think I'll give that a go. Thanks!
---
oh yeah forgot about those, I only used 3% to keep it cheap 
---
you lose some dps (iirc you go up to 800 In fury), Its sometime worth as you'll shoot into their resist hole, like against the deimos.
---
Force rorqs to spread out, let regions re-generate exponentially low minerals after certain n amount is mined in y amount of time instead of just blindly nerfing rorqs.
---
Panic does deserve a nerf tho. higher the ADM, lower the time rorq can hold panic. 
---
If you mean the dollar value, somehow, I don't think that's going to happen.
---
When is the next 100$ year sub sale?
---
thanks for taking care of me :)
---
Epiq video. I don't play EVE Online but after watching this video, I downloaded the game and signed up! Thanks, OP.
---
Yep sounds like you've got it. When you're combat probing, dscan is invaluable determining if it's worth putting probes out, and even for narrowing down where to place the probes. If you're core probing for signatures then you can go by the list of cosmic sigs in the probe window.
---
But that 10% falloff bonus could have unforseen consequences, just imagine if a cynabal could actually hit something
---
600~ with drug and implants, I had some bad loose due to trying the setups and doing an absurd amount of mistakes (you can see a bunch In the vid), now I'm more confident while flying It and I think I could kill more differents setups.
---
Its not the best ship for the meta right now so I'll still lose a bunch of them but its incredibly fun when It work perfectly.
---
So the real pro move is to setup region-wide PLEX buy orders in obscure bits of space? 
---
You are true hero of the apocalypse. 
---
So like I said, if you get caught, you are doing it wrong. It is not like you have to burn AWAY from the damn Deimos from the start, you start at kiting distance to begin with. If you fail to keep at least 30km between you and a ship that is only 200m/s faster, yeah, don't fly a cerb. Manual piloting is hard. 
---
Thanks!
---
Kills are added and standings recompiled hourly (don’t want to abuse zkill’s api too much).
---
yeah, and since then the price is already 35-40% higher...

i am glad for you. but the last 12 months i was still playing the content was drying out more and more. don't have the time anymore to spend 2-3 hours roaming with only options being blueball or helldunk.

That was basically the setup; 2 Machs bumping me from the top away from the gate for over an hour with help from frigs. I had a ton of logi reps from AG until a Barg swooped in and counter-bumped me into warp.

Nah. You can just start roaming new eden and peeing with your civilian (or whatever they call then these days) laser immediately.

this game is dead for true pvpers

No one is stopping you from opening up 50 skillfarm characters. The market is free and has settled by now, it's been how many years with skill injectors now? The truth is no one wants to do this shit because it's boring and tedious. If it weren't we'd have the market flooded with injectors and the price would go down. 
---
your arguments aren't very convincing. i guess you started playing &lt;2 years ago?

For all you spodbrains who play this game for material acquisition, tell me why CCP can't increase medium AC falloff by 10% (which we were promised over a year ago btw) in the time it takes Falcon to smugpost on this thread claiming this accusation is disingenuous.
---
p2w

Small goonie thinking he knows it all, making himself ridiculous on Reddit by not understanding what that edge of the "arena" does when your trying to kite
---
That's the whole point. Bursting your target down. If you can't kill your target in a rapid light salvo, then they can most likely tank heavies. 
---
Excellent!
---
Personally, I wish they'd set up the extra SP microtransactions along the line of a set of training booster injections which would last for a pilot for a month. Pay a dollar, get a boost that removes 1X from whatever skill you're training (minimum 1X). So that 2X train is now a 1X train. Pay 10-20 bucks, get 10X removed from your train times for a month, so racial carrier is now a 4X rather than a 14X (again no skill goes below 1X). Bind the effect to the account, so any characters training get the benefit (which might help sell more Multi Pilot training certs).
---
There's be no need for SP farms as these boosters would be provided directly, there's be no Rorq in an hour pilots but you'd still get a huge benefit in training time to catch up with older pilots.
---
Link some of your solo kills with a cerb plz
---
...how do you expect to keep distance to a ship that is faster than you - assuming the other pilot is not braindead and clicks approach and does nothing else?
---
I see they don't teach physics or geometry in 5th grade yet nowadays. 
---
I love seeing these guys eat shit, but not like this.  This is bullshit.
---
If I could think of a macro doable in autoIT seconds after I finished reading your post you can be sure every macro software and their dog can do it.
---
Or how about just buy into the market and let your ISK grow, as if the market will ever collapse here.
---
Brig got introduced and nerfed like 9 times between the last balance patch for capitals and now. CCP just doesn't iterate at all. It's not a design choice, it's a lack of ability or priority on CCPs part to approach a more balanced state. 
---
Please never change.
---
I think he means that you can earn as much isk ratting in a carrier as you could in an incursion per hour.
---
Imagine a game where people upvote some spodbrain content instead of legitimate balance 
---
1. I had high hopes that Cerb would be the answer to the Vaga/Muninn we see in abyssal PVP so often, but it doesn't seem able to break that tank even with your glass cannon fit. Any luck against them so far?
---
2. What drugs are you using? Pyro4, crash, and blue pill?
---
3. Thoughts on anti-Curse? I suspect with damage cloud you could punch through or at least strain the tank, but being locked to Kinetic for full bonus seems restrictive as you really want EM/Thermal for that. Defang with ancillary should be doable if they let you get a volley off.
---
&gt; Pretty sure HK are like 20 real people and 5 of them are disabled

Assuming this is right, what does this tell about the attacker needing &gt; 1k people and 1 year to accomplish his goal ?

I can forsee, a Lowsec Gate to and from Stain would change EVERYTHING !
---
&gt; Hey capri, remeber how shield supers are completely useless and armor supers are vastly better in every single practical way, especially avatars?
---
I'm happy to admit when I'm wrong but I still stand by what I said then. Shield supers are better when everything goes right, armor just has more room for mistakes when it doesn't. That was from experience of a lot of dread bombs and ganks. What I underestimated was the degree to which FAX alts would proliferate and thus how small that margin of error would become. Also to a lesser degree inertia.
---
That said, TEST is doing armor super fleet too now, why would that be if shield supers were better with no downsides. :eyes:
---
It looked fine on EFT. Did I step in a time machine?
---
The rorq is unique. It is a capital ship that is based around being defensive. People get upset around this because they want easy kills. The smart and prepared rorq pilots will do their best to make that happen.
---
The thing is, the less players are playing, the less PLEX are sold which bring the price up, and the higher the PLEX, the less players play. At a given moment there has to be a physical manipulation to avoid the price ramping up like it is actually, because it is toxic. I unsubbed 4 of my 6 accounts cause I'm not dealing with a PLEX that high. 
---
Oh right, I totally forgot that was a thing! I just remember getting Plex to buy an exhumer pilot.
---
Hmm, where do these Injectors come from, maybe somewhere from heaven? Or lets say some people have to buy them for RL cash and put them in the market. Maybe these people are the same people that bought PLEX with RL cash? What if these people leave (you know that casual CC-subbed 3-Account veteran pleb that has not adapted to 20+ Krab-Alts subbing with ISK ?
---
Eve is so hard.

Ah, i remember that time. People lost their minds when it went up to 800m.

"PLEX IS SO EXPENSIVE"

Get a job and pay for a sub. Everyone plays to PLEX. Nobody plays the actual game. Blame those in Delve. RMT, Input-broadcasting, stated goal to ruin the game for all others....
---
They have succeeded on all fronts with CCP facilitation. Stop playing altogether and watch how fast GSF membership activity drops due to IP bans.
---
I only have two main accounts and I pay for them both with money. When I buy PLEX is so that I can get more ~~ships to explode~~ SKINs. Usually when it's on sale though...
---
I'm doing my part!
---
CCP really needs to take the idea of the galaxy pack and rotate it into different sets. Like every 12-18 months they should rebrand the existing "galaxy pack" into a new deal (new skins, variations of plex/mct/sub time) which lets people buy them fresh again. The first few times galaxy packs went on sale plex/mct prices came down. Now that everybody has pretty much bought the pack - it going on sale doesn't seem to really do much.
---
you know its bad when the incursion squad bitches out
---
They are though, there's just a lot of them. You can explain pretty much any of them in like 2 sentences.
---
warp to me isn't from what I've heard...  
---
Shit how did they figure it out, everyone hide your stash.
---
might be a few morons who bought plex when it was cheaper who still run their farms thinking they are in profit but no most will turn them off until margins come back 
---
but people who use the accounts for something else will still sp farm to lessen the cost of the sub

He should link lossmail.
---
Sorry, but when I bought PLEX with cash, I always sold them via sellorder with my trading toon. Why should I go down just to have the ISK  a few hours earlier. Thats only in case of emergency.
---
Funny you say that, I just came out of a meeting arguing the exact opposite.
---
It’s better for us who don’t have time to run 20 alts 24/7... As I can’t efficiently make isk or I just get ganked all the time, selling plex is way more convenient for me, so the higher the prices the better..

How long does it take to close a 30km gap burning towards it while the other pilot is manual kiting the edge? Never seen an entire AT team chasing a solo survivor hmm?

There has been many changes to the game since skill injectors got released. I think you will have a good time learning and experiencing the new changes.
---
&gt; is there any chance of other sites existing that I need to scan the entire system for in search of them?
---
Nope, they've made exploration so easy that it's not really exploring anymore. Put your probes on the areas they circle for you and dial down the distance and the isk throws itself at you, except it's so easy that you'll be competing for sites much more often.

It's the same free market, you are free to buy extractors as you please with ISK, plex the farm accounts with ISK, and sell injectors for ISK.

-I encounter Prox XQ's curse yesterday, I couldn't break him as I needed to overload a full 20 volley to get through armor and I needed to remove his drone constantly.

This said I was tanking him between slow boating on the edge of the arena to kill drones and cycling ancillary, I only died to using all my cap booster and didn't had a full load, maybe I should have tried to fully repair my launcher each time to get a chunk of armor from time to time. I think It could work pretty well against a less pimped one/ by surprise.

MCTs should not cost less than omega,  this is a mistake because it encourages SP farming.

SP farming should not and will not be profitable in the longer run as extractors ensure that anyone can have "free" omega as long as they are willing to forego SP gain. In fact, extracting to maintain omega will trend towards being a slightly losing proposition soon.

I doubt CCP cares about the long-term future of the game anymore. Players predicted current EVE and warned CCP when they announced skill trading in 2015. CCP ignored them all. Same story with the Rorqual changes 1 year later.

For more than  6 months, they dont even have a proper roadmap anymore. Its just ... more balance changes, more events, more skins. The game is in maintenance mode.

if you are already mining with 1char you may as well add 10more, same hours spent for 10times the profit

Yeah, wormholes are good for getting back. Sometimes you have to go a couple holes deep into the chain before you find a hole you like. Also, I find that if you just low-key check holes while exploring eventually you find something perfect for your needs. Let the holes come to you, rather than you go to the holes. 
---
The other thing you can do is watch the thera connections website for holes, then you don't even have to look (might have to wait for one to line up though)
---
You also might find some neat things, like a C4-C4 connection that wraps back on itself. (I'm pretty sure I've seen one of those before, it was like 7 years ago though, so maybe I'm mis-remembering)

Whales follow the 80/20 principle, 80% of the revenue comes from 20% of the customers, although I'd say it's 90/10 to 95/5 for eve. Pure F2P games tend to be at 99/1.
---
Kill the whales, kill an insane proportion of revenue. The rise of AFK/Offline farm methods happened because a few years ago, before injectors, you could play with your credit card all you want, the return on investment (in isk/sub or isk/plex) plateaued around 10-15 accounts subbed at a given time (assuming no botting or broadcasting). With skill injectors, there is no such cap and the return on investment is linear, adding 10 characters to your skill farm adds maybe 20 minutes of micro per month ? 
---
&gt; but they're expensive and don't insure well (for mostly-AFK wormhole huffing).
---
Inaction also takes time, and so far there isn't much difference in result.

I think peple would easily forgive transient imbalances if there is constant iteration.

While I really don't care about the quote itself or that it exist in this guy's bio (it's a bit humorous), the fact of the matter is that free speech only exist on a public platform.

In other words, if it turns out to be against the EULA (I hope it isn't), then it is at the discretion of those who moderate the game to decide whether or not to enforce action, not the constitution of the United States.

I was referring to group content as you can see clearly in my unedited comment. Later on someone else disproved your claim that you could farm overworld nodes with 50 accounts because it caps at 10. You also have no responses to the comment thread that actually talks about group content instead of your overworld strawman. You're just a sore loser. Don't bother responding.
---
NO! There should be no manual manipulation of the market.
---
Jesus man, new players didn't plex before plex, new players don't need plex now.
---
can i request you make the shit post more modern. as in at least 2005
---
&gt;All fights occur as 8-bit sprites to mitigate TiDi.
---
I would play the hell out of 8-bit sprite Eve.
---
I did not watch the link, but I enjoyed reading your comment. I do think it is important to humanize people like this in order to better understand why something happens and what we can do in order to discourage it in the future.
---
Then go lose your 11b isk jump freighter taking gates in high sec not my problem. I offered a solution, there are many others none guarantee safety only make attempts to minimize the crosshairs on you. 
---
Out-of-game macroing or having software remap your input so it's different in each client is bannable in WoW though.
---
So, you wanting to sell a few trillion in skill injectors, or did you not quite realize what would happen with constantly changing meta?
---
Esoteria
---
Goons had hundreds of titans beforehand, and the faxes to back them up, pre-rorqual buff
---
People buy plex so they can skip hours of work ingame, like your station trading.
---
The best part is if you actually read it start to finish I'm clearly not saying it's easy, I'm just pointing out that "it takes dev time" is a huge cop out.
---
TVP didn't die from people moving to null. TVP shot itself in the foot with poor leadership and a "selective" player base. WTM won over in the end. 
---
O-VWPB
---
Oh most definitely. I'm not speaking of the legal right (I'm not American and the US Constitution is so much toilet paper to me) but the ethical and moral principle of modern civilization and society. 
---
Thank you, I’ll give it a try :)
---
Very specific haha but thanks
---
The last thing CCP should be doing is some how manually deflating prices.
---
The state of New Eden is bad enough, let's not make it worse by removing even more sandbox content such as a mostly natural commodities market.
---
If 2bil is too much, then you got priced out and such is life. New Eden was always a brutal capitalist dystopia.
---
You can get a good idea for one ship using pyfa.
---
You can then extrapolate somewhat easily to highly restricted small-sized fleets, like the AT.
---
Now try to predict what a massive alliance will do with 300 of them....and then add in what other massive alliances will do in response.
---
It's not quite so simple as you scale up.
---
Leave Kim out of this!
---
&gt; Where would be a good place to explore?
---
Outside
---
&gt; some areas that I could possibly find decent amount of anomalies
---
financial markets
---
political ideologies
---
family holidays
---
Holy shit you actually sound mad.. Why do you even bother responding if that's the case lol, go outside, get some air...
---
I'll attempt to be as concise as I can, as to save space and time;
---
Multiboxing in WoW is very powerful, significantly more powerful than what is possible in eve (within the rules!). Group content in WoW can also be multiboxed, however that is usually not the appeal of multiboxing.
---
Multiboxing means you can grind/farm gold quicker in 2 ways;
---
1. You can run older raids, with each character in their own 
---
instance. This means you can spend the same amount of time clearing 1 raid, or you can clear 10, 20, 50, 100, whatever, in the same timeframe - WITH MULTIBOXING.
---
2. You can do overworld farming. I'll admit, I wasn't aware that nodes despawned after 10 chraracters has harvested them. Regardless, there are tons of overworld farming methods that can be multiboxed with 50+ characters, such as simple mob farming.
---
At no point did I compare multiboxing to botting. Hell, I you read [this] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/aujnic/if_you_want_plex_prices_and_multipilot/eh8yx1h/) comment, you'll notice I even say that comparing multiboxing is useless and not relevant.
---
So how is my argument a strawman argument? And when, specifically, did I compare multiboxing to botting?
---
Hell, what even constitutes as "group content"? Going around killing faction leaders in the major cities is supposed to be group content. But that can be multiboxed. So that alone makes your argument invalid...
---
Is there any way to use multiple monitors without stretching the in-game grid across all of them? If not how do people play like this? I'm only using 3 and it seems terrible.
---
I’ve had my fair share of those, I was actually asking a genuine question..
---
Can two people run the same site at once?
---
Would never work.
---
Far to many killboard warriors would never undock without backup, because they aren't in it for the fight, they just want the win. 
---
How do I go about that?
---
All those people who pay zero attention to what’s going on in eve....
---
Ok, just look here and find out where each race of rats lives: http://evemaps.dotlan.net/region  
---
Sanshas seem to have the bestest relic site loot, then open ingame map and find a region where those rats live with low number of pilots in space. Esoteria is close, but too many people, at the moments Stain is your best bet, because it's a shithole with no lowsec gate. So go there.
---
Better than tvp being shitlords running everyone off with drama over the years...
---
Goons had more like 10,000 total people in there, and hundreds of caps
---
I knew about Dotlan I just wasn’t sure what I should be looking for, thanks for the info tho I really appreciate it. I’ll check out stain and I’ll try to look for places with low number of pilots as you suggested.
---
Any abyssal site can be run by either one person in a cruiser, or 3 people in frigates. (the lower tier ones can be completed with less than 3 frigs)
---
https://updates.eveonline.com/ have most big stuff on it, scroll back to were you last played 
---
Not sure if I'm getting trolled at this point but ... yeah you need hacking skills and a Data Analyser mod, and scanner probes to scan down the sites.
---
PushX will do it for 210m ISK:
---

---
When someone decloaks within 2km of you, you are also decloaked.
---
Remove / change panic and make excavs work like heavy fighters instead of drones.
---
They wouldn't be able to reclaim drones and warp 20 ships out simultaneously, the very second you enter local.
---
you mean downtime on monday? cos they were definitely going after downtime on sunday as i was in for a few kills sunday afternoon when i got home from the gym.
---
On mobile?
---
&gt; I understand that with third party intel tools there's a lot of false positives because people know there's a gang 10 jumps before it gets to them
---
Intel channels with cautious ratters - people are docked up before you get there.
---
Intel channels with less cautious ratters - people pull drones within some seconds of you getting into system
---
Bots - multiple 'people' pull drones and warp at the same time, always immediately
---
The biggest thing going for the game is not gameplay and such now. It's that a large chunk of the player base now has too much time and money invested in the game to walk away. That's the bonus CCP brings to the table.
---
You posted this last week and got called a retard. Why post it again?
---
That sounds fun, but it should be it's own game.
---
Try out some abyssals!
---
Its too big of a risk, lets instead add another event that will source Absolute Injector Augmentors and see how far PLEX prices will go! To the moon baby!
---
err yeah, late sunday night US time / monday eve time
---
yea, 1-2hrs irl vs 20 hrs ingame.
---
You can run them in 1 cruiser or up to 3 Frigates. 
---
Assault frigates are the popular choices, Hawks mainly from what i've seen. 
---
You could also try your hand at DED sites, with two people scanning you can cover a lot of ground and make some good money.
---
Can be done in T1 Cruisers in Highsec, Caracal or Gila are the most popular iirc. 
---
Yea it sure refutes ....  /s
---
Especially the ones where total Rorq value is 1.7 Bil and that is without factoring in insurance. Then you factor in insurance on top of that, and the Rorqs don't need any safety at all. It becomes part of standard cost of operation, like VNIs.
---
because the general consenus of r/eve changes changes weekly.
---
They just ate two Bar-Ones is all.
---
No, but you can run 3 with frigates.
---

Just released a few days ago
---
Ccp can't fix this with a plex sale, it a symptom from a dieing game. They need to make it so people actually Wan too play again, and they have zero interest in that 
---
4 Yrs ago. But if you start pulling this argument, then I already know where it is going... Well, every game in the start has much more diversity. WOT was nice when not everyone had the "best" tanks, so was Hearthstone etc etc... the diversity is gone as soon as the game reached maturity, which is now for eve... Now the game has to be rebalanced (and was rebalanced quite some times now) to make up for the poor balance that was always there but not that obvious before
---
Ah, thought you were talking about using ig tool exclusively. Yeah I think pyfa looks a bit cleaner due to better use of spacing and organization (except for show info on items, firehose of stats in some weird order without icons)
---
it's including snuff that drops caps every time, and oohhhh watch, they get killed
---
&gt;1 months gametime has always sat around 20-30 hours of the average line members income.
---
Lol not it hasn't. The first 5+ years game time was dirt cheap. You could get a month for less than 100 mil, and make that in a couple hours ratting or mining in null. 
---
He could be a masochist, how dare you judge people’s sexual desires in 2019...
---
because its a decent idea
---
It is interesting how unique experiments can be done with our economy that can actually extrapalate into IRL
---
True, but the post is still a shit post, and not a good one either.
---
Heh, I'm actually going through DS9 during workouts, I've grown to appreciate those cheating, weazly bastards a lot more with age.
---
Pearl Abyss's marketing department would love that
---
I just did that. Down 30 chars because every account now makes merely 86 million per months. Thats not worth the investment of ten billion.
---
Back to the roots I guess
---
No I use Pyrfa, the in game tool pretty much only used for fitting/substituting if you are short an item to see if the replacement will fit.
---
If they’re gonna ban you it’s gonna be for more than just a YouTube video
---
stop posting the same garbage post thanks.
---
Sounds like you were botting. Petition to ccp and wait that's your only option don't whine to people on reddit 
---
Maybe you should be thankful for the ban instead of complaining.
---
Beep bup
---
YEah they use asics these days
---
so you got caught botting and now you're salty about it?
---
neat
---
Tbh I think it just goes to everyone's head with lazy people complaining on Reddit about how their content wasn't fed to em. Whenever I feel like playing I always find shit to shoot.
---
flair checks out
---
I never said shield is always better than armor, you however, did say the reverse.
---
But why? They banned me after that video was released and they dont hand me proof
---
maybe stop botting
---
Spawning them in box space would make them super easy to find.
---
i bet if people dislike it and report it i can get my accounts back that video says nothing i dont bot
---
WTB shark week 
---
Ratting carriers fully fitted are now down to 1.3 Bil, meanwhile fully fitted sub caps to take them out keep on rising in price and far exceed that value. This is before factoring in insurance. Then you factor insurance on top of it, its a fucking no brainer. 
---
Forget lighting cyno and defending / escalating and all that, unnecessary, not worth it and loses you ratting time.
---
On supers you don't even need to fit any tank whatsoever to rat, brings down the cost so much that you just have spares ready to log into instead, like VNIs. Literally.
---
And Rorqs and their issues are pretty well covered everywhere. In r/Eve included, no need to post yet another gazilionth essay about it since you literally can't read the front page without running into a whole huge fucking list of what is wrong with this whole picture.
---
so its a shitshitpost like a stainguy po......... ohhh wait a second
---
5) Proceeds to counter the counter to the op by providing tangible succinct changes to the game that can be implements at simple value tweaks?
---
Yeah in invest 230 billion monthly to keep one char up. Noice.
---
And by doing so allowing the owner of one of the market citadels to plex his main due to tax. 
---
I wasn't even aware there was pilots from the old Tri-NC war days who are still with them, props to that.
---
 If you're the situation im thinking of, you were  aligned up to an engineering complex 1550 km away.  If so, one of those machs was me. I dont recall the barghest trying to counter bump you into warp, but orbiting to help block bumps. It requires a lot of speed and mass 
---
Its no easy feat because the ganker mach was pushing the orca down and to hit it into warp requires a good hit and it's hard on a moving target. I know I went over and under the orca a lot and has a lot of bad bumps. I think i tried to change your sideways velocity at the start to make it harder on the ganking mach, but once i saw the orca aligned i tried to vump it more from below. Still learning. 
---
Its almost like the eve players can see the power of something ahead of time (ADC) and not others (MJD).
---
depends what they doing, mining will be just as viable 
---
1x100m hour or 10x100m an hour. takes the exact same time to plex them 
---
but yeah most other forms of pve accounts will take more effort to get plexed, pvp accounts will cost more. 
---
Chain booshers is a common mid-level multibox activity now.  6 Dudes or something is all you need, not even that much SP.
---
that's literally nothing in terms of daily traded in jita market 
---
If all the places have been looted, then you need to find places where other people aren't actively exploring. Your best bet (in my opinion) is to find some place in sov null (not the drone regions!) where the local sov holders are not active during your time zone. For USTZ, Fraternity-held space could be good, for example. This dramatically cuts down on the number of people hunting at the same time as you (or hunting *you*) while also letting you benefit from sov null system upgrades to site spawns. In general, you're looking for a sweet spot of convenience, low traffic, valuable site types, and high site quantity.
---
Thats not how that works:
---
https://www.adam4eve.eu/commodity.php?search=PLEX&amp;typeID=44992
---
Shows that the volume just moved from Sell orders to Buy Orders.
---
So much power...
---
Hey, hey, give progod the proper credit he deserves.
---
That is not how that works:  
---
https://imgur.com/a/zvOhfBb
---
Adam is just failing at tracking the instant orders I believe.
---
So, post CSM summit, do you think this situation will change soon? 
---
That would be relevant if we were talking about development but good thing we are talking about changing some stat numbers in a database.
---
because I'm in Stain!
---
when the average person was making 20mil ISK an hour chaining belts in providence in a SPR Drake? 
---
just curious, which one of the guys in the vid is you?
---
Pray tell, what disastrous consequences would giving 10% falloff to autocannons, or 10% reduced range on RLMLs, or 10% more optimal to blasters, etc. etc., have on the game? And, assuming the solutions were horrifyingly wrong, how hard would it be to fix?
---
A new crop of players learn about it the hard way each year.
---
Says the guy ghost training a literal army of skill alts.
---
You know, they could limit the maximum number of extractions on a character to 1 a month or maximum number of injections to 5 a month. The problem is, that the desire to pump injections is what drives CCP wallet growth. Telling people they can't have instant gratification means less revenue.
---
Venal is decent too.
---
Hey look, another butthurt WHer nobody has ever heard of. How original. 
---
Because goal is to change something to the better and this way people will see how badly those things spawn.  
---
Goal was to get PvEvP ... it is hard to get this vP part if you get almost constantly so fucked up spawn places. 
---
F this thread
---
Pro-tip. Invade Delve.
---
Its a simple supply vs demand issue. Most Plex is originally purchased by new players and active players that play 1,2 or in some cases at most 3 accounts.
---
These players are getting turned off from the game and leaving due to all the issues the game has, mass multiboxing, botting etc. all included, but not the only factors. Cap vs sub-caps imbalance from every perspective, less and less small / medium alliances / corps available, etc. etc. Also a lot of them are not interested in playing a game where the End Game  (thus perceived ultimate goal) is multiboxing Rorquals or inactive AFK playstyles.
---
So you have less and less of the above mentioned players in the game, hence no more new plex entering the market. At the same time, you have more and more mass multiboxers, bots etc. that are buying out the remaining plex.
---
To go forward there are 3 options.
---
1. Make changes to the game that will stop the exodus of the players who originally purchase plex from CCP and put it on the market.
---
2. Make changes that severely limit the multiboxing to slow down or eliminate the buyout of plex at rates higher then it coming into the game.
---
3. CCP artificially manipulates the prices, maybe even throws some free plex on the market.
---
The third is unlikely to happen, actually, all 3 are unlikely to happen. But lets say for the sake of conversation that #1 or #2 would be feasible, what specifics would you be willing to put up with in order for plex prices to go down ?
---
You obviously weren't paying attention to literally last week, when folks were screaming about wanting the AT and not balance changes. 
---
"Plus it was CCPs own words that they were going to give up AT to focus on balance, so where is that now?" - it's been a week, dipshit. 
---
Thanks for proving my point, though, Sandy. 
---
Jokes on you the orthrus can’t even kill a ramjag in one clip.
---
props for doing all this work man. interesting to see for sure.
---
The entire system is fucked. Those who run them know you can just gimmick the entire thing. CCP should just remove them. 
---
I wonder why people think the CSM is a joke.
---
Probably as many people wonder why you keep posting. 
---
Warp to me is losing contests to 40 rattlesnake you can't speak for them :P
---
Am I the only one that is left wondering... how little content is there in that wormhole that one battle cruiser disrupts all life for 5 days?
---
You are absolutely right when it comes to server workload, but that is just a consequence of improved realism.  The destruction of all things from Keepstar to shuttle should be proportional.  In a perfect world we would get there eventually anyway.  I think the chain reaction of ships being destroyed when a Titan is taking out or a freighter are being destroyed trying to dock Jita, would be awesome to see.  
---
When I used to do it, I wouldn't toy with it for a month and it was significantly more then 5%. Always like 2-3 days and netted me a lot more then that. For 5% you put it at regular price and it sells in minutes, not months.
---
and the dutch navy got seized once by french cavalry...There's always exceptions.
---
Tbh goons doing it in 300 frigates was 100% better than when compared to 2 supers afking them with fighters. 
---
Show me the posts.
---
MPT and PLEX are price linked because you get MPT from the NES store for PLEX.
---
There was a guy that tried this! He posted some reddit updates awhile ago. Can’t find the link, but it was kinda cool

I'm real glad they had to kill AT to be able to allocate resources to game balancing. I'm sure the couple hours a YEAR fozzie spends making the ruleset will absolutely go to game balancing. Cancelling a one time yearly tournament that they almost completely outsourced to the community last year so they can BALANCE THE GAME. What sort of negative IQ smooth brain logic is that." - You, 12 days ago. 
---
The vid was about hitler playing and being affectionate with his dog
---
You do realize that snuff has less caps on field the hostiles caps shooting them? 
---
Yeah. 
---
I subbed about 3 months into playing as an alpha, I wanted to fly a manticore and a procurer to mine to make my isk. Raptors too for fleets 
---
I was living in 2014 in the Querious pipe in my relic/data cloaky Tengu for about two months, good times were had.
---
I think roaming in nullsec and using null-null wormholes to travel is not a bad idea. Ship-wise I would check how interceptors do with good skills vs high difficulty hacks.
---
Just a little space snow. Be sure to clear that off at undock so anyone warping behind you doesn't get a face full of it.
---
This is 2.5 :P
---
Thanks for the idea, also I’m sorry but what does sov stand for?
---
Ever since 2012 you could make 250m+ per hour in a frigate hull and the rest of your arguments are more or less moot.
---
There was 150m+ FW LP farming, 1b+ WH farming, 10/10's remain unchanged.  Only low SP pilots were stuck farming at 60m/h.
---
I would wager there was a major shift of players from high/low to null that was a greater shift than the psuedo whine you posted.  Carriers were already skynetting from pos's and ratting assisted fighters...
---
Did you really want that back?  
---
I like how you're so good at looking so dumb. 
---
Show me where people advocated for removing balance changes in favor of AT. 
---
I think if they’re able to afford yeeting kamikaze freighters for lulz they’re able to afford security status repair
---
I’ll pass by there to have a look, hopefully I’ll have a good time too haha, thanks for the reply :)
---
yes everyone who ever obtained any substantial amount of money only ever did it because they were born to rich people
---
mom when will my che guevara arrive from ebay
---
Fuck you're dumb. 
---
CCP has manually manipulated the market before. I'd have to dig for the video where the econ guys talked about it
---
Sure, you absolutely could make that money. I know people who were making 80b/month trading in jita a decade ago, it doesn't mean that is accessible to the average player who doesn't have the knowledge to perform that.   
---
Also 10/10s used to give you more ISK, when pirate BS BPCs were 600-800m+ prior to the changes to anomalys/escalations. X-type hardeners used to be 100-250m each not 60m like we have now. So you actually earned more back then.   
---
It's not a whine, just an obvious point that the value of ISK has decreased since there has been rampant inflation. Just look at the level of ISK velocity in the MER. 
---
Look here guy 
---
OK thanks for the random goon insert. See above:
---
&gt;Anything will work with 100~ titans and hundreds upon hundreds of FAX
---
You have a multitude of choice depending on your play style and sp.  You can day trip from hs, e.g. Vale - using a relic interceptor.  You could go on a long trek for a couple of days/weeks using Thera to jump to one side of the map and flying a nullified tc3.  You could go to null sec npc space and base out of there and use wh to get to a trade hub on a weekly basis.  For the latter, you can access both Gurista and Sansha sites (the two most profitable).  The sometimes overlooked, but occasionally profitable is drone space,  but read up on their sites and put a weapon on your ship to deal with failed hacks.
---
How about y'all actually pay real world money to play the game you supposedly love, and maybe stick to one or two characters, or if you really need umpteen damn characters accept that you can't skill them all at the same time.
---
Wow the Purity of the Throne skins are whiter than I remember 
---
Sovereignty, that is, player controlled vs. NPC controlled 
---
So only 2 groups can get hands on them ? The rest has to pay overpriced prices?? And people in curse/stain/gw/etc get nothing sounds fair 
---
You need to get into different wormhole chains. Think of each chain as a little cul de sac off of known space ... even if you get really deep into them, If the place you started from was downtown, you’ll still be looking where everyone else looks. Fly to the middle of nowhere, then go deep in a hole. 
---
It was a pretty slow week, y'all especially know a thing or two about posturing only to put your toys away when nothing happens from what I've seen.
---
We had 1:1 easily in WWB too, what we didn't have was subcap supremacy, so we never tried to fight with them because it would have been guaranteed suicide.
---
well that is exactly what I said. balance is nice EXCEPT Cap vs Subcap...
---
you should just read mate...
---
Man, exactly how smooth is your brain that you think thats advocating for no balance changes ever so we can have an AT lmfao.  
---
1. Ip bans are like 1980s tech that doesn't work anymore. 
---
2. As a goon that lives in Delve that has never broken the EULA, all I can say is stop drinking the koolaid.
---
funny thing, exactly not what I hear on TiS when small gang groups are there... 
---
I'm sure it's fine. Itll get bigger once those Rorqs are yours.
---
We're ready when you are. Bring it.
---
there were many who payed a ransom and got away.
---
well done!
---
&gt; We had 1:1 easily in WWB too
---
yeah, no, your forms to help stainwagon were absolutely trash in terms of ratio. 
---
No.
---
If you want plex prices and all that to go down in price you need to convince CCP that their Financial Ouroboros of plex and extractors doesn't fix the shitty skill system they have, it's merely just putting a bandaid on the problem. 
---
i like it!
---
Correct, they did not teach you that capitalism is in antagonism against morality.
---
200ms *5 * 30 -15km web is ruffly 45 secs .. not calculating any abyssal webs 
---
If you guys are up for a challenge you could find a c5 and Nestor/rattlesnake rat together. Would recommend an astra to stage out of and kill drifters with, bit of an initial investment (especially finding an unoccupied c5) but you make loads of isk. 
---
Ah! I didn't know all that was happening, I'm pretty layman when it comes to the mechanics of messing with people in space. 
---
o7 Thanks for the fun and entertainment, you guys are awesome.
---
poor balance? can't recall the balance being this awful for such an extended amount of time. there is no balance because you can't balance a broken economy or a company that focuses on milking the playerbase.
---
this game is no longer the game i fell in love with. it's an absurd shell of it's former self and all the blame lies with CCP.
---
No one cares about burn jita
---
Gaarek !
---
Fucking woke ass point. 
---
I’m sure PamFam didn’t ask The Initiative to deploy to thier Space. If they did they asked the Pet Alliance.
---
well damn...
---
As someone with a big boy job and extra cash, thanks everyone. 
---
Every i dude that runs 10 or more drone ratting ships sits in a pipe with a scout at the entrance. That gives you plenty of time to recall drones and warp to a safe if thats your defense mechanism.
---
I surmise what you have seen is reddit trolling and very little to no in game contact with us then.
---
aren't you that guy
---
What guy?
---
Hey, you said it. Not me. Answer your own question. 
---
I just did. 
---
I would suggest a region/race of regions (gurista, serpentis, etc) to stick with, as that way you can bring one set of DED refits. The upside and downside of t3s is you can refit EVERYTHING if need be. Downside is cargo space to carry all these if you wanna do all of it. I’d suggest gurista space as the natural resist profile of tengu works nicely with the damage gurista deal. Look up Maze fits, those will get you through DED 10/10 for guristas and you should be able to Breeze through any lower difficulty ones you find. You could also go for NPC space of that race, bring some Refits and stage out of a NPC station

Outside because this game is trash
---
Although octaboxing does have an impact, I think skill injectors and extractors are the big problem here. Skill farming is an almost insatiable source of demand for PLEX, because its product (injectors) is price linked to PLEX so PLEX prices rising don't affect farm accounts - in fact, because you spend the PLEX now to farm up SP which you can sell at a higher price later, farming is actually even more of an issue with higher PLEX prices.
---
Multibox or AFK anomaly ratting needs a big nerf as well. Who's going to buy an account with real money if you can just leave your computer running and flick over to it every half hour to collect ISK? That's not what Eve is supposed to be about.
---
Rorquals are a huge problem for the in game economy and need looking at as well of course. But possibly not for ISK inflation.
---
in FW you can grind out 1b a day in a sub 1mil SP char

NAME THAT POKEMON
---
Hi, i'm Logan Jakal, AMA. 
---
I didn't need you to know the CSM was a joke but im going to be pointing at you for years.
---
Literal bad faith actor in the community. 
---
I am verifying that this is Logan Jakal.
---
Retrichu!
---
I mean I could fly battleships within the first few months - the issue was having a comfortable wallet balance in the event you lose it. OP is talking ISK here, and the ability to generate it. Not do they have the right skills to do it.
---
I respect your opinion, but I’m enjoying it so far..
---
Why bother? Bots make way more without the hassle of grinding. 
---
Eve does have some severe inflation issues, but yeah, half the idiots who post here also think that buying ships is an ISK sink and that mining is an ISK faucet... Where do I sign your petition?
---
Have you tried *not* being an F1 monkey given handouts by the same bots causing this problem?
---
Feroxes online
---
&gt; do you propose any alternatives, other than hoping they just keep adding new power-creep jesus-features like ADCs and triglav ships?
---
No I don't. That is exactly what I would like to see as powercreep is realy not a problem when it comes to subcaps at the moment anyway and more aktive solutions is a better way to go about it than tuning numbers imho. All I would like to see is a bit more communication from CCPs side on the matter. 
---
You warp to their citadel/pos as you enter the system and can see them all land simultaneously on it?
---
There are no bots in Esoteria, alliance leadership said so, alliance leadership would never lie. 
---
CCP is incompetent 
---
Not anymore, actually. The profit has gone out of it due to thinning margins, but it's still break-even.
---
That makes sense, I guess I’ve been making a mistake by not checking the following chains, thanks for that :)
---
Interesting trivia: this total is almost exactly comparable to Burn Jita 2 and Burn Jita 3 in 2013 and 2014, respectively.
---
* Burn Jita 2: 147 freighters, 12 jump freighters = 159
---
* Burn Jita 3: 139 freighters, 16 jump freighters = 155
---
Let me break it down nice and easy for you. Canceling the AT to “balance the game” isn’t bad because of the “balance the game” part, but instead the asinine implication that ccp NEEDED to cancel the AT to focus on balance. As in they **couldn’t spare the brainpower to do it properly** if the AT was running. Understand now?
---
Sooo. Why do you think it calls Forward Operation Base?
---
I wonder how much money you could have made investing in Plex with this kind of inflation
---
That was literally the blizzard model.
---
"We cannot and will not balance solo pvp".
---
Hello, how you be Logal Jamal if I am Logan Jamal?
---
Thanks
---
I went through and read that thread.  You are right now in saying that there are so many things that were unknown at the time.  So many things have been learned since, namely that the ineffectiveness of dreadnoughts in the current meta was a complete surprise to many and that the Rorqual changes greatly expanded the sizes of Fax caches far beyond what you (or anyone else) had anticipated, making cap problems moot.  Furthermore, single target DD's are still the norm, so the AoE drain didn't have the anticipated drawbacks.  Your arguments at the time were totally valid given the information that existed at the time.    
---
However, you are totally skewing why Test has an armor fleet to save face here.  The armor fleet exists because shutting Rorquals down in an alliance this large causes equivalent or greater economic damage than a capital whelp each day.  In the current meta an alliance must be able to project power without damaging its position in the Titan arms race CCP has graced us with.  Because armor supers generally track better and are more forgiving, they are perfect for a Rorqual defense that is more likely to be handled by a b-list FC.  As a bonus, would-be recruits that are considering making their home in Test can bring their sentimental legacy-rigged Erebus with them, which is good for both parties.    
---
I don't think removing the panic is a good option as typically there are 2 situations when fighting a Rorq - you either don't have enough DPS and it tanks you forever and never has to panic or you have so much DPS you basically volley it into having to panic straight away. I agree that if a 10bil ship is going to be locked in place for 5mins at a time, it should have some powerful defence, but trying to balance that between the various scenarios it might face is no easy feat.
---
noob
---
Also don't forget Goons, TEST and to some extent NCdot are doing reactions, manufacturing, trade, shipping and lending at a huge scale. I haven't ratted or mined since the war and I've made 20bn into 70bn in delve. 
---
If you think cyno inhibs are useless, you need to stop being bad with your inhibs.
---
&gt; The post is long and quite hard to follow, so I’ll give a VERY simple summary of the arguments that follow:
---
Also known as TLDR
---
I'm coming in through a wormhole, their scout at the pocket entrance isn't relevant.
---
You can see drone pulls from dscan. To be fair you don't get a 100% view of when they press 'warp' or 'align' but they certainly all warp out very close to each other. You can often see the ships landing on the home station.
---
No, it's not 100% conclusive. That's why CCP need to get involved - they get all sorts of logging and abilities to log into a system without showing up in local in order to get better evidence.
---

---
Spodbrains undock to fight when people visit their space

dumb post, dumb argument, either made in bad faith or from a dumb enough poster to not engage further
---
I have edited the post in response to this valuable feedback
---
To someone with a job and so forth, it's an absurd length of time.

They don't need to. This isn't a discussion. It's a tough luck situation.

They should keep them in high sec. That was EVERYONE can do them!
---
Got a name? I'm itching to go hunting.
---
Your game is imbalanced and the test server is full of spodbrains dunking each other's capitals for the satisfaction of kill mail notifications because the content on your live server is so stale.
---
Feedback done.
---
well balance was waaaay off going right back to the start, you can never balance anything perfectly in this game,
---
I was gal pilot from the start and when I started hybrids and rails where the worst thing in the game. it was all missile boats and ac's
---
This game is and always will have fotm weapons and ships because people like to follow what other people do, and even the most minor of changes will affect max min activity.
---
What people supplying the Plex ? The people supplying the Plex are turned off from the game, largely due to the multibox /AFK / botting issues. The time has come for you to become "the people supplying the plex".
---
I haven't thought much about this issue but I'm curious, why doesn't mining qualify as ISK faucet? Do you mean that in the strict sense that mining does not produce more ISK but rather resources the ISK value of which is determined by the market?
---
More exposure pieces like this please. 
---
Fuck CCP.
---
well...damn.  you did more investigating and research into this than any news agency does for mainstream news nowadays.
---
well written!
---
Break things, then deal with players screeching "Reeee!!! SHITS BROKE!! CCP SUX!"
---
Unironically sounds funny and fun as fuck
---
Thanks man =)
---
CCP: Pikachumeme.jpg
---
It would be welcomed.
---
So many simple changes that could make botting harder, yet CCP make more skins. 
---
Fuck cheaper flex prices. I can grind  one hour in-game for 300mil, or grind one hour in RL for 3800mil. Unfortunately RL grinding is also way more fun than any PVE. 
---
I will go further then that. We know that CCP bans bots in banwaves at the rate of roughly 4k accounts a month. We also know that there is crapload of bots they don't ban. 
---
It stands to reason, that outside of the actual banwave time, there are at least around 4k bots logged into the game at any given time.
---
So substract that from the total, then split whatever is left between actual multiboxers / AFK accounts, and people actually playing. And the people actually playing and AFK accounts you can further split into alpha only and omega.
---
We of course do not have the data on any of this stuff so its difficult or impossible to draw accurate conclusions.
---
But its a rather grim picture even without the data.
---
how do i set a reminder to check up on a thread o.0  i wanna see what happens in a week xD
---
If they gave 10% falloff then the cynabal might be actually usable and we cant have that
---
the real pro move still is to buy plex in highsec, vault it to null, redeem it for extractors and fill up the injectors for local sale.  Nobody moves injectors because of the collateralized value and fact that they're remotely usable, but people absolutely do buy them locally because they're too lazy to put a new toon in perimeter to broker the transaction.
---
I think I forgot to mention: I've sent the last chat log in this post to CCP security's email address. That's all they should need.
---
/u/ccp_falcon

---
Heaven forbid.

Cool story bro, have you checked out these SKINs though?
---
 \- CCP
---
It would also be interesting to see the cost of all ganking ships destroyed as an efficiency comparison (even though I know that isn't a factor, just interesting to see)
---
The game's just too fucking easy to bot in: solved scriped PvE with neverending anomaly spawns; homogenized space meaning no major botting client updates needed if moving from say Vale to Delve; an easy way to convert in-game currency to real life currency with an actual price ceiling; and the ability to create multiple accounts and inject/extract SP in seconds rather than growing bots over time are just a few examples.
---

We have always been at war with ~~Eurasia~~ TEST
---
they live beneath the "blue lagoon"
---
And how many sellers do you think an obscure region has ? Even if it does have a couple, how long until they dry up ?
---
Im sort of wondering if they have been managing to cull market bots that trade plex.
---
Pretty sure since there were no caps involved they didnt care.
---
Uhh I'll take one for the team 🤣

AAR: PIRAT forms rattles with 10 basilisks and warps to 10 off spectrum fortizar in armor timer. Spectrum fleet warps to 0 on rattles and within minutes their fleet vaporizes. Logi wasn't capable of holding for very long before sentry drone DPS broke their back.
---
Fun little event despite the whole wardec and neutral logi thing, shows hisec is very well alive with politics.
---
You are forgetting how many new players get to this point, and then quit because of it. They find this whole Carrier, VNI ratting, Rorqual thing kinda abhorrent and leave the game instead.
---
Zkill must have had more kills, my mistake on the total
---
I don't get why CCP doesn't just cut PVE (ratting, mining, exploring, FW) income across the board and increase the costs to manufacture capitals. 
---
because you mine ore, not isk.  no isk is created when you mine, except for the bounties on belt rats.  You trade the ore for isk that was already injected into the game. ratting creates isk. getting an insurance payout or mission reward creates isk.  Buying shit from NPCs or paying NPC taxes/fees takes isk out of the game.
---
Basically look at any activity and ask where the money goes.  If it moves between players, there's no change.  If it's created or taken by the game itself, then it's a faucet/sink.
---
You literally cant read. 
---
If the number of plex they sell, remains constant, why should they decrease the price? 
---
/devils advocate
---
It's kind of astonishing isn't it? These are pilots that are so completely out of touch with their community that they missed the announcements, missed all the zkill popups, missed all that spam in Local, and went on as they would on any normal day.
---
I'm thinking that's what drones are for.
---
&gt; My financial reaction is to not give CCP any more money for anything. A lot of others seem to have made the same decision. If this trend grows strong enough, CCP will end up being dependent on payments of a small group of whales and so will the game. 
---
Then ... logically the way to avert this scenario is to subscribe to the game to vote with your wallet for the better financial business model (subscriptions).
---
As you said yourself, unsubbing forces the game to become more dependent on PLEXwhaling as its revenue stream and thus CCP has an even greater incentive to shove more and more microtransactions in. 
---
If we want to turn this trend around, we need as many people to subscribe as possible.
---
It only takes one? 
---
I didn't consider broker fees though.  They won't be much, but also not insignificant.  
---
Fantastic piece of investigative journalism. Glad I took the time to read it all. I hope the information leads to more bans and pushes CCP to take botting more seriously.
---
Woa! 
---
I just checked in the game. Literally logged out about 15 min ago. As of time of this writing, the MPTC is roughly same price as 500 plex, very slightly below, like 10-15 mil difference.
---
Go in to wormholes through lowsec. Lower traffic means a better chance that other daytrippers haven't been to the system before you. And if at first you don't succeed, try and try and try and try and try and try some more. I'm in about 20 wormholes in a night, and the majority of them are complete nothings when it comes to pirate sites. Maybe I'll get one or two in a system, but nothing major. You have to have patience with this and be willing to go deep into the chain in order to find every scrap of ISK that you can.
---
TL;DR
---
You could read the OP, but as thats not your strong suit
---
https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98583572/
---
Personally, I get the impression that 800m was more expensive at the time than 2b is now.
---
Dukat was an amazing character. Charming and full of guile, whose reformation and misguided principles almost made him a bizarre anti-hero type for several episodes. Then he went full Space Hitler.
---
I'm not saying you are wrong but what would you expect "real" players to do diffrent then what you described the "bots" are doing? 
---
They can be corpmates which are in voice together or just not being afk while ratting.
---
&gt;the test server is full of spodbrains dunking each other's capitals for the satisfaction of kill mail notifications because the content on your live server is so stale.
---
Implying this hasn't been the case for as long as anyone can remember.
---
&gt;Stop making skill farm alts, or stop fifteen boxing rorqs. There is a clear progression of supply and demand. More people multiboxing astronomical amounts, surprise surprise more people mining to pay for those accounts because fuck paying 200$ for 10+ accounts monthly.  
---
&gt;So no, the prices will not go down, and you cancer Octaboxers are the people to blame.
---
.
---
I disagree. Make more of them and do it quickly before the prices increase even more. This way things will top out faster, whoever is going to quit over this will quit faster, things will level themselves out and return to "the regularly scheduled programming" faster. Lets get it over with instead of dragging it out.
---
A whole three billion interstellar kredits? Oh man!
---
good to see you're still following me around and taking screenshots of my comments :) good boye
---
ishtars are basically just expensive VNIs
---
The only item in the entire game that has the ISK cost going up is PLEX.  This is not inflation.
---
Average kill looks to be around 2 billion. A T1 coercer is 1.4 million. They use about 150 of them per gank. So a typical takedown generously costs 250 million. Half the kill value is in the hull, and half of the remainder is destroyed, and plenty of what drops is stolen or left behind. But it does appear that the operation at least breaks even when you consider that some ganks used far more expensive Taloses. Of course the true cost is in the burnout of FCs, bumpers and loot squad, which is why it only happens once a year.
---
Ended up higher and it isn't on the scale of nullsec but it's still a really cool fight, not very often I see this sort of thing between wardec corps
---
No local in sov null, no local until gate cloak expires in NPC null and LS.  You can have all the bot accounts you want.  CCP gets user numbers for their financials, bot killers get content.  
---
Everyone who matters, wins.
---
Garak is actually my favorite DS9 character.    
---
Dukat got some great lines to be sure, but was basically designed to be Space Hitler from Episode 1 if you re-watch it; Episode 1 shows the first Orb and Dukat is already sniffing around for it, and arguably, in such a way that directly defies his governments current position towards Bajor, giving tell-tale signs of the strength of his religious fanaticism.
---
well choose a class of wh c5 being the best c1 worst. choose the an appropriate ship for the class you want to go into. drakes and myrms are good in a pair up to c3. gilas are also good options up to c3s. they are over all better than bcs but more expensive. past c3s your looking at a pair of t3cs tengu likely, nestors, or rattles. note theres not to much a pair of nestors can do in a c5 w/o a really blingy fit and even still not recommended. the other option being rattles but those are gana be pretty expensive to but should have a easier time tacking c5 as a pair.
---
It must be noted that there is a high amount of risk involved in this as opposed to what your used to doing which is pretty much no risk. if this sounds interesting to you i would recommend you guys just join an established wh corp. lot of isk to be made in wh space but as with anything in eve its better with more friends.
---
You mean that those poor vnis arent newbros that you scared to death in your disgusting hunting nano ship???? Thats why they died. What the fuck is wrong with you monster. Tapi doesnt allow bots. They got teleported to hs remember?
---
Welp, looks like updates are broken, I did a manual update, trying to get auto updates to work again.  Thanks for letting me know.
---
It's a multi-dollar media empire!
---
This is the reason I quit Eve. I used to be able to farm enough in a vni to pay for a Plex years ago. Those days are gone. 
---
There's literally 2-3% margin between sell and buy orders on plex.
---
Wow who would have thought trying to brawl rattles with t1 bs would end badly :suprisedpikachu:
---
All hs ‘pvp’ groups are dogshit, even if they do try to clear out cancer like pirat lmao
---
Yes you moron let's throw shit at them for trying to fix something that is broke, because reddit wasn't complaining about crashes in the past week so it's not valuable
---
Yep I bought up a hundred when the galaxy pack was out and sold them over time. Sold them too early it seems.
---
I wish I could give you multiple upvotes, because it looks like you out more work and effort into this than Lebron Jame’s efforts to achieve a degree of higher learning.
---
I mean. You can expect neutral logo to be there. So it's not like it comes as a surprise. You just have to account for that beforehand. You could you know have neutral dps ships take care of them. 
---
After reading this, I immediately contacted diplos to see if we can begin a nice hunting expedition.
---
Imma go kill some bots.
---
I’m sure you will have quit way before that. 
---
Its not just about the margin, but also about market swings on long term sell orders.
---
What do you do once you're in the wormhole though?
---
It's fairly simple really, simply drop all of the fitting that's not a smartbomb. As you can see from the results, there is always at least one person that didn't get a chance to shoot, or the AG flying around trying to do something, so you're going to get concorded after a few seconds. As long as you have the cap to run the rack for 2 cycles, that's all you need.    
---
Also EMP bombs would probably be more effective. and with the cost of the hull already, you may as well fit T2's.
---
Yeah recent changes motivated me to unsubscribe the main account. CCP no longer deserve my money, this game has almost reached EA levels of pay-to-cheat bullshit.
---
The sad thing is that the managers whose liveliehoods deserve to be destroyed will throw the programmers, artists and (already) community people under the bus and will come out well.
---
Nobody said they needed to cancel the AT to balance the game. They cancelled the AT because they did t have the resources to do it, and they’re committing the time that would have been spent on the AT to balance and QOL changes.
---
That led to a bunch of whining from guys like whoever that guy is who keeps responding to me complaining that we need the AT, not more resources going to balance. Which is literally the opposite of what OP posted here. 
---
So, again, some folks on r/eve are so schizophrenic is can’t stay on message for more than two weeks without completely flipping what they’re complaining about. 
---
&gt;When Y0YOY00oo mentions where his bots are now, he lists 3 things: Goons, [...]
---
Yeah, this corp: [The.Ring](https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98517701/)
---
Just check the killboard, the VNI botting started at the end of [november](https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98517701/page/5/), short time after [Skywarker XeXeXe Xe](https://zkillboard.com/character/2114629860/) and his botter friends got banned.
---
The corp also removes older (probably banned) VNI bots, here is the leave history:

and many more.
---
If you check the ingame character information of those VNI ratters, you will see they all have the same ingame title "@", all previous (now kicked) VNI ratters had the title "Untitled3". 
---
Man, you put more work into this than I put into just about anything related to this game. Well done.
---
I can tell you as someone who is working as a developer while not as senior as some I've been around the block. CCP has all the data, and if they aren't capturing it that's another issue. The developers are either hamstrung by management/process or incompetent. Many solutions, some more succinct than others.
---
Not related to the quality of the post, but I would recommend reading better news sources.
---
Reuters, The Economist, etc.
---
Generally low sec combat anoms can be done in gank fits, they don't require much tank normally. If you fit a drone boat you can make all your high slots neuts and have web scram afterburner on mids. Sit at the entrance (where the gate takes you) and while you're killing rats remotely with drones await people to come gank you. When they warp in turn on your clown rape modules on them and consider them a bonus rat. Myrmidon comes to mind. Make sure you have a micro jump drive fitted just in case they manage to burn out of your scram range then you can just jump 100km away and warp.
---
So much this!  It doesnt 'look' like inflation across the t1 and capital market because mineral price index on the MER has tanked even harder than the isk pool has increased.
---
Wow you're right. Nice work man. Fits are basically the same too.

It's pretty often empty (especially around the end of primetimes), so there's that. You see some VNI and Caracals sneaking into PVP for this reason; hoping to get an empty gate for free loot. If you get an empty PVP room, you'll probably pay off your ship and there's a chance for ransoming a blingy ship if you're MWD fit (although most ships are fitting MWD these days due to that risk). 
---
Thank you for the well thought out post. I plan on letting my Omega lapse on half my alts until CCP takes action to combat this ever increasing issue. 
---
Ive played this game long before you and will play long after you. You're irrelevant. 
---
Crash helps apply against drones, I think? So in the anti-Curse situation where defang is important, it can help at lot (especially if they are around you and not MWDing). I like it for faster clearing of the PVE too as I'm in an Orthrus (IGN: Kibbler), although the side effects can be really nasty if you roll bad.  
---
Agreed on launcher repair as you reload; that seems to help quite a bit in at least allowing you to burn the next salvo. Prox is also great at drone control and it's hard to land a single salvo against him as he launches/attacks/recalls around the time it takes to lock. I've fought plenty of Curses that aren't as good and defang should be easy, though. Too bad you ran out of charges!
---
Who are you again? 
---
Oh, right.  
---
This is a legitimately good compromise between mines and no mines. 
---
why is the nereus tackling me, why is it approaching me
---
oh god its a reaver
---
Nice straw man, 
---
Nobody (sane) took that position most people accepted that the balance story was a bullshit excuse, fuck even Elise his moral everything is fun guy's post didn't use balance changes as a defense. 
---
Yes most of the community suspects this was a lie to hopefully make the shitty news go over better with small gang pvpers. 
---
Now the fact that it didn't made everyone including Falcon drop it quickly from the narrative. 
---
You can choose to log into EVE... or you can choose to play another game. Option available. Next request?
---
Amazing informative post as always. Thank you for all the hard work you put in to all your posts to bring forward evidence for CCP and the community to see. o7
---
No, you are literally the one who claimed he said something then posted "where he said it" only for it to not be what he said.  So once again, exactly how smooth is your brain.
---
That's a lot of stuff to read but I will just assume that botting = bad and good job
---
What about the KB page shows that I'm wrong?
---
If I give you a dollar, can you come up with another insult? You really need one.

/thread
---
There's a lot that could be improved on with regards to mining and industry to make it more involved, but as you said, something's can be changed and others not so much.
---
Best we can do is pose ideas that are plausible in the current gamestate with the present mechanics. Small steps in the right direction make larger impacts.
---
frankly, if SP farms are an acceptable method of isk generation, i dont see why something like this couldnt be. 
---
Legit question, did you ever message warmeister with this info?  He tends to ignore reddit sperg, but responds really well to in game or discord pokes.
---
For anyone in high sec it was iirc.
---
Why play pubg or apex legends... when you can just get AIM bots.
---
Honestly this logic is full retard... you are bad and should feel bad.
---
tl;dr: bots.
---
The what ?
---
That's literally how serenity happened, and I think we all know how that turned out.
---
Did I say I'd rather have no cyno inhib?
---
I'd rather have a cyno inhib that doesn't have 0 resists for some fucking stupid reason.
---
Carry around 1 armour hardner of each resist type (you can fit it to your ship in place of one of those heat sinks)
---
There are mission walkthroughs on allot of websites that will tell you the damage profile of specific mission rats, you wanna beef up your resistance to the main and sometimes second incoming damage profile.
---
it will help allot! 
---
You turn into an ancient BOB player
---
They're so bad that even CCP ended up trying to fix them, albeit failing miserably as they usually do at balance.
---
It should be noted that all PvE in all games is easily botted.
---
The NPCs are just state machines.  Not that difficult to write your own state machine to counter them.
---
The hunt for bots and evidence. I guess I should have specified :C
---
If anyone is wondering, scoots used to be a good man, this is what happens when you get dragooned into becoming a test forum moderator.
---
The NPCs in all video games are state machines.  Even if you add a few more conditions like "when to scram a target" to the state machine.
---
It's all easily countered by the state machine in the bot.  For example, let's say CCP adds NPC logi.  Human players will kill the logi first.....and so will bots.
---
It's not like "launch drones and wait" works for a Nyx bot.  These programs are "actively" controlling the game.  There is not a way to permanently make NPCs hard for bots.
---
HE ASKED “DO YOU ENJOY ‘THE HUNT’?”
---
It's no wonder, when some of the best ISK-making activities are boring, mindless, repetitive, predictable grindfests.
---
Open up a notepad, try writing a decision tree/state machine for a rorqual/VNI bot. I bet you can do it in less than 20 lines of pseudocode, if translated into real code perfectly, it might even be indistinguishable from a human player, while being more efficient.
---
Heck, in games like WoW, you can tell a bot apart from a human very easily, as they tend to run around in circles and grind mobs, instead of doing quests and dungeons like a human would do (Yeah, I know dungeon and quest bots existed at one point, but you could still easily tell them apart). In EVE, the grind *is* the end-game PvE content for us humans, so the only way to identify bots is to spot flaws in their programming, or analyse their wallet through ESI. It's so hard that alliances tell people not to report each other, in fear of misidentification.
---
EVE is a game that is designed to be botted. In any other game, a bot would strive to be more human-like, but in EVE, in pursuit of the 'dankest ticks', it's us humans who aspire to become more bot-like. At this point, CCP might as well provide an official scripting API in the client to even the odds. I would actually find that more fun, as I like programming and can't stand PvE. Imagine AI bot battles, debugging and exploiting flaws in other people's code or selling scripts with a hidden backdoor on the market that lets you frag people at will. 
---
Or they could take some of the suggestions from [one of my previous comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/apltg9/10_rorquals_here_are_28_rorquals/egcb0pb/), and actually fix their damn game, while also making it more enjoyable and less boring for us flesh puppets.
---
Killing bots sadly doesn't do anything to solve the problem, as the loot and cost of replacing their ship contribute to the pollution of the economy with dirty ISK. Best thing we can do is report them and move on. :(
---
tbh all of this happened because Mineclub kicked me after falsely accusing me of being an AWOXer. Gangrene reached to me and I gave him what he wanted. Since, a WERMT diplo standed up for me and mailed the alliance that the accusations were false. 
---
Do you want to talk about our lord and saviour sir?
---
Importantly, it was only ever manipulated using plex/isk that already existed from confiscated accounts.
---
what an awful way to play the game
---
if carrier prices are down, and BS prices are up (as people are saying), this isn't a case of simple inflation. (as some are saying)
---
I unsubbed my last account. It was mostly PvE with some misc small PvP thrown here and there depending on whos logged on. This whole Guardian Gala thing just left a very bad taste in me so keeping pure alpha for now. I might resub 1 or 2 if I see some changes happen in the game but am not holding my breath for it. 
---
Mining is a combination of an ISK Transfer and a multipart conversion mechanism that can be used to counter its inherit isk deflation mechanism.
---
Situation 1: too many minerals  
---
Hull prices drop under Insurance levels, Minerals become a 'conversion' of Minerals into ISK (technically a faucet for ISK and a Sink for minerals).  
---
Situation 2: Not enough minerals  
---
Mineral value is high, ship prices are high (margins still low), insurance prices lag upwards, hull death 'has more meaning'.  People move to mining as income source if the balance shifts too hard.  
---
Situation 3:  too much isk and too much minerals  
---
Mineral Value is at insurance floor, hulls are cheap (margins low), other asset values (in isk) rise (ie, PLEX, Salvage, LP, T2 Goo).  Salvage and LP have their own conversion systems as well, so they are often kept in check.  This leaves PLEX.  
---
PLEX is complicated now because of Skins and Extractors acting as PLEX sinks along with Omega now.  There is no self-regulating plex-saturating mechanism.  This is why plex are rising.  This is natural no matter the level of Mineral or ISK incentives, simply due to the nature of the various systems (compounding wealth, early adopter advantage, income scaling with experience and sp, IRL inflation, etc).
---
It could be argued that CCP should 'faucet' some PLEX in some form, 'ie a sale'.  What is interesting is that now the price of USD$-&gt;ISK via PLEX is approaching the value of USD$-&gt;ISK via RMT.  This will kill bots.
---
More than likely its just not as important to combat when resources can be allocated elsewhere in the game. 
---
This corp is for any one that don't like to pay tax or have someone telling them how to play Eve. Im farly new to the game i help where i can. If you like to play and dont want to answer to a npc corp for nothing go ahead an apply you will probly never see or interact with me. The one thing i ask is too try not to start any war'S what is it good for?????? Just Msg Me For Any Thing Ill Do My Best To be Of Help....... DONATIONS AND TIPS ARE GREATLY WELCOME &amp; WILL BE USED TO PUMP SHIPS ISK AN OTHER GOODIES BAK IN TO THE NEW PLAYER LIFE BLOOD.......
---
Looks like you still don’t understand. AND your misrepresentation of what Bap said is looking more and more intentional which is honestly disappointing Brisc.
---
Balance resource allocation and running the AT **are not mutually exclusive.** Bap never said that it was. I won’t say that **no one** ever said that because you’ll likely plainly misrepresent someone else’s comment, but still I’ve yet to see it. But you seem to love to fight this fake argument you’ve invented for yourself because it’s convenient.
---
Now I’ll stop speaking for Bap and speak for myself. Saying they’ll commit resources to balance and QOL by killing AT ‘for now’ is laughable as they’ve done laughably low levels of balance in the recent past. Claiming that with no AT, more resources will go to balance blah blah is honestly more of an excuse than anything. 
---
One last time so I know you’ll read it. Suggesting that being angry ccp is axing AT, with the claim that they’ll definitely, promise, cross-my-heart, focus more on balance and QoL (haven’t they promised a team of some sort before?)= **OMG U HATE BALANCE?!?!** is disappointing to hear from a csm member.
---
I think it's around 100-150m loss per account per month right now depending on if you use +4/+5. MCT are basically negative or barely break even; not worth using unless you actually want the SP for another character on your account. 100m per month for cyno/dictor/hictor/rorq/super accounts really isn't much. Not quite the isk fountain that it was a year ago but very low cost to maintain omega alt accounts once they're established. 
---
There's a difference between AIM botting and automatically sending in a sequence of inputs to manage a fleet of ships. Aiming and hitting targets is the entire point of shooters. Automatic mining could be made an in game content pool with items that expand the operations and entirely new ships and strategies. Also, it's extremely easy to tell when someone is AIM botting. It's damn near impossible to tell when someone is automatically flying a ship using a bot.
---
I have 6 really bad words for you:
---
GHOST TRAINING is still not fixed 😉
---
So,  don't complain, just play something else... 
---
how to actually make money without playing a game
---
For what ? To Rorqual mine or VNI or super rat ? Fuck that
---
I play this song on OSU (weeb game)
---
Sure, for the first 2-4 weeks... After this you can enjoy all the fun in the game.
---
ya ccp loves their money more than their game... makes sense
---
Really. That's the take you're going with? Seriously?
---
Or evicting wormhoers
---
The world doesn't need another one of you. 
---
Titans cost 100+ for the hull and another 20 for the fit too. They're worth like a tenth of that in 2019 evebux. 
---
We've killed / observed a lot of the ring ratters. Some very odd/patterned behaviour. 
---
&gt;wants to pvp
---
&gt;contacts diplos 
---
:sadpepe:
---
I'm not misrepresenting anything, LittleKurt. I'm simply pointing out, using what whoever that dude is said, the point I was trying to make before: one week, everybody is bitching about the AT and saying with either don't need more balance and QOL changes, or that CCP is lying about everything.
---
Now, we see another thread going up bringing up a year old demand for "easy" balance changes, and folks are bitching about balance again. r/eve has the consistency of fried water when it comes to player desires. 
---
And, of course, there's the inevitable "they're all just lying about everything" that is something everybody says about everything. 
---
I'm tired of the constant whining. No matter what they do, somebody is going to whine about it. 
---
CCP. please hire this man. 
---
Someone up the thread was advocating that new players should pay for their monthly subs by salvaging the remnants of higher SP character's anoms/missions. They estimated that it would be "easy" to do in about two weeks. 
---
No better way to make someone quit the game than coming home from work to roleplay a minimum wage space janitor for two weeks straight so they can finally play the game versus just paying the $14.
---
Great video :)
---
Btw I feel you at the end, it's happened to me haha
---
I would like to note that the high plex costs of skins is an ultimately unnecessary plex sink, when what this game really needs is an isk sink.  But since selling skins for isk doesn't keep the lights on in Reykjavik I don't seriously propose they go that route, but if they didn't keep the price of skins revoltingly high that would at least put a dent in the rising costs.  
---
Now I know what braindead retards dream about
---
With regard to logi.... Have logi be essentially spider tanked. Any given ship in the spawn has a chance to be logi. They're not named differently or obvious in any way however visibly the logi effect is obvious. Think like a massive green laser visible on all settings. A human should have little difficulty identifying the source of the green love laser but a bot would have to recognise a shape in 3d.soace and identify the brackets at source and destination then primary one in the hopes of hesdshotting the logi ship.
---
Its probably not the best solution but seems to solve the issue of being easy for legit players and very difficult for bots. 
---
indirect hurting, the best kind.
---
Which ship is that?
---
90% of a dungeon bot is AI pathfinding, which could be solved with bulk data gathering like a heatmap. Fucking Diablo 2 bots were more sophisticated than EvE bots.
---
3/10 right
---
You can go search any ship you want if get your head out of your own ass.
---
NordVPN, they have good resources for setting it up on whatever device you're using. 
---
I had to ask for a refund 3 different times after explaining how my CPU literally couldn't effectively use their services(0.5 Mbps speeds). This was on my router with a 300 MHz single core processor. 
---
If managing a fleet of ships isn't the point of eve, I'd love to know what is.
---
How about... no?
---
I agree. Ultimately however, once those new people become not so new, they're still new enough, and they realize whats in store for them if they stick around, all the shit, such as multiboxing Rorqs, VNI / Super ratting etc. they leave or simply decide the game is not worth paying for.
---
So even the ones that make it through that initial "filter" end up leaving, and this not just lowers incoming plex supply into the game, but makes the game worse causing even more people to leave.
---
Nothing of value was lost. 
---
So you were fine with your corp botting, up until the kick? Wew.
---
This is some damn fine investigative journalism. Well done! 
---
*laughs in 10/10*
---
Nice loot mate :)
---
They cleaned their hull too much.
---
Doesnt even remotely work. Its just badly balanced and unplayable.
---

Its been heading in this direction for how long now ? And its been brought up in just about every place, r/Eve included and you're a CSM, how is it that this is news to you ? Been living under a rock ? Hiding your head in the land of bots and multiboxed Rorquals like an ostrich in sand ?

Mature, but honestly I didn’t expect any better from you. And yeah you are, maybe you’re intentionally being too thick to “own the triggered kid lmao” or actually believe what you’re saying, I’m not sure.
---
Whether or not ccp is lying, maybe they’ve made too-bold of promises, idk. I don’t think ccp is malicious, just making the wrong call. But ccp has, unarguably, made balance promises that they cancel, continuously postpone, or let fizzle out. That’s fine, but if they want to use balance as as consolation for something like the AT, they’d better expect backlash. You can **le sigh** all you want, but Bap and those like him are in their right to be angry, and not believe the promise.
---
Also I’m not sure if you’re paying attention, but those who are angry about axing AT are usually those asking for more balance. Maybe that’s your ‘AHA’ but those people aren’t the ones saying, as you claim ‘we don’t need more balance’. You know you’re making that up. 
---
Not really. I reported the bots to my CEOs long ago, they told me that they didn't care because it brings taxes. That's where I started shifting. The thing is, a farming setup taxes time to move. I started looking for alternatives 2 weeks before being kicked.

I strongly disagree. its time to really turn up the heat instead and give the the game back to actually playing players instead of AFK multiboxers and bots. Let the shit filter itself out and quit.

You wont fight one frig. You will fight a group. They will td you, kill your drones, and grind you down because you cant hit anything. So basically you got killed by a 5m frig.
---
80mil profit ain't bad for a delve 10/10!
---
I know we like to piss on CCP for not banning bots but no matter how many ban waves pass and how many main accounts are banned people will always continue to make more bots. Bots exist in almost every game and every time the devs put out a notice saying bots were banned you can log into the game and see brand spanking new accounts already busily botting away. I just want to bring the issue into perspective from a technical point of view and while CCP does fuck all about other things botting is an issue that no company has found a permanent solution for.   
---
It's like killing ants every time they crop up in or around your house. You buy some bait, put the bait out and kill off the ants until the next nest pops up and you repeat the cycle indefinitely.

I guess they are ransoming by going "pay me 100m and i will let you kill me, if you dont pay me, we both die" and if the other guy is in like 2 bil ship, they might pay.

Did you by any chance read the post or not ?...

Like I said, go read the forum threads, and the dozen or so threads bitching about the AT. You will see more than one person claiming "balance is okay right now, we need community events like the AT" and more folks like that random dude who apparently only plays the game for the AT.

Serious question. Did you start off small and plex your accounts or did you just spin them all up at once? Also, is that 60 characters on 20 accounts, or just 20 characters?  Always wanted to know how folks got into SP farming. To me it just seems like quite a bit of work to setup...

Fully fitted ratting cariers are down to 1.3 Bil. Some less but then they can't rat as good.

I asked Logan to ask this. If you look at the post you'll notice: 
---
"I was talking on discord with Logan (our valiant leaker) while this was happening. I was asking him to get as much information as possible".
---
Unfortunately Plex fuels much more than just subs. It's a basis for CCPs microtransactions. 
---
You run the sites and make big money 
---
And that actually inhibits the moment it comes on.
---
Fair enough. 
---
... What?
---
That's exactly what they do, and do well. If your FCs are failing to use them properly, that's on them, bud.
---
&gt;A human should have little difficulty identifying the source of the green love laser but a bot would have to recognise a shape in 3d
---
First, recognizing graphics is easy.  The bot would look for the green laser too.  It would be no more "3d" than you looking at the screen is.  After all, aimbots worked so well in Overwatch that they added pictures of the characters to the maps, and that's entirely "recognizing a shape in 3d".
---
Second, the bot doesn't have to look at anything on the screen.  It can look at the memory of the Eve client, or watch the packets going between the client and server.
---
*Anything* you put in as a cue for the human player can be seen by the bot, and probably more easily than a human player can.
---
If the individual player makes a profit while helping kill the game, thats good, right?
---
&gt;and you cancer Octaboxers are the people to blame.
---
Basically botters.
---
Let's say you're in a T2-fit Orthrus (~300m cost), which can go really fast and hit from range. Let's say your opponent is a really blingy Ishtar with a 3BN fit with no propulsion module so they can't catch you. You can't break tank with missiles, but they can't kill you with drones if you stay away.
---
At 30 minutes, you both blow up and lose your ship and pod, so it's in the best interests of the Ishtar pilot to convo you and try and come to an agreement where you let them kill you in exchange for ISK to save their ship and pod.
---
I've done this with AB-fit Vagabonds, where typically they'll pay for ship/fit replacement +20% but you can try and charge a lot more for expensive ships. Unfortunately, a lot of people would rather die than pay (or risk you scamming them) so you'll die anyway, but it's possible to work out a financially viable deal.
---
Fixed. It was localized issue with the Fighters skill. It was incorrectly listed to be a intelligence/perception map. I changed it to a mem/per map and it should be correct now. If you do not want to create a whole new copy of the sheet, you can fix this by clicking view&gt; hidden sheets&gt;SkillsList. On the SkillsList sheet, scroll down to fighters, and change the primary attribute to memory.

Entertaining a conspiracy would be more comforting than facing the prospect that so many of our fellow players are this bad.

I'm more impressed that they can carrier and super rat at the same time consistently. Not a bot btw.
---
There's more to game balancing than just "changing values"
---
Not really. We rarely see fast nerfs, so the baseline we have is limited, if even existent.
---
The fast nerf is never really fast. The "fast" nerf is the appropriate nerf as it has been established by that time that the "something" is OP.
---
Why can't you manage an in game interface that manages a fleet of ships? I can manage an in game interface to sell a fleet of ships.
---
Just filter out the conflict of interest.
---
You're basically saying "you can buy cheaper PLEX if you don't buy PLEX"
---
And even if that wasn't a paradox, as soon as you resume buying PLEX you'll push the price right back up again.

It's difficult to fathom how dumb you have to be to claim someone said something in a quote, subsequently post that quote which contains no hint of what claimed, then quadruple and quintuple down by trying to shit on the people that point out your error.

You'd die eventually, and then you'd end up back in a station. 
---
Hit up TIKLE regarding that information and they’ll deal wth it. TEST does not run the rental alliance in southern Esoteria. If you do have any intel on bots in TEST, I’d be happy to deal with them.
---
That entire concept is "low level" balancing and absolute shit.
---
Super cool that you're showing the video for this and all, but at what point does CCP start to say "Maybe nullsec/rorqs are too safe when people have given up trying to kill the actual rorqs?"
---
I am not talking about development but about quality assurance (aka testing). My point is that if you change things (even if they are just values in a database) you need to really be certain that you don’t muck things up. 
---
I take great joy in authorizing blueshooting of bots.
---
‘Omg r/eve is as consistent as fried water, le exasperated sigh’
---
‘What I meant was go read the forum threads, this conversation definitely didn’t start about my apparent and intentional misrepresentation/lack of reading comprehension!’
---
Reading comprehension really isn’t your strong suit Brisc, if you still somehow believe your own claims on Bap ‘mr. only ever plays AT yet somehow argues for more balance on TQ without having to kill AT’s quote.
---
Good talk though, always fun to talk to a self-important ‘politician’!
---
Is rain water?
---
I'd expect, even if not afk, one or all of them to not be paying 100% attention and therefore for there to be 5-10s divergence in how long it takes to pull drones and warp.
---
And sure you can keep making excuses about how anything I say 'could be' legit players. Any individual instance, yes, it could be coincidental. But when it's a pattern across space then there's obviously something else going on.

Who needs sleepers fleets?  Why not just have the low power stations lose their orbit and crash into the nearest celestial body after they run out of fuel?

They just want to abuse their overpowered shit. Its always the same.
---
Yes, he joined on black legion to fly with a fleet. It did die. Big boom.
---
Lots of folks said that canceling AT _would not result_ in balance changes, not that they wanted it INSTEAD of balance changes. Hence the posts (and one really shitty video) outlining what CCP _says_ they will do about balance vs what they _actually_ do about balance.
---
you should actually read the article instead of comments, lol
---
They ban bots at the same rate.
---
Not sure if you are a wormholer or high sec carebear explorer...
---
Not too much would change. You could do those changes, but we need more fundamental fixes. The game doesnt need more kite bullshit. Its already too strong as it is.
---
Well, maybe you could have both. More variety never hurts.

Just someone who thinks this inflation is getting out of hand and hurting the game a lot, in a long run.
---
Yep, Serpentis Narcotic Warehouse. Was messing around with regular combat probes and a regular expanded launcher. Took me a minute or two to zero down but got it, went and grabbed my Confessor and had fun. :)
---
Look I know it's crazy but we aren't going to beat the botters.
---
Legalize it.
---
Another goon bot
---
been doing it for years my dude xD
---
Yep those are my bread and butter, I run 3-5 a day when I'm playing. My computer is off getting repaired currently lol so no Eve for me.
---
Is water?
---
As I recall, this problem existed in World of Tanks for a while as well. I remember seeing a game were it was a 15v15 matchup with one real player on each side and 14 bots who just followed him around because that is all they are programmed to do.
---
Sssssshhht, dont let them know.
---
&gt;The trend is developers have the tendency to underestimate the effort and complexities of proper quality assurance 
---
They have a ton of statistics to show exactly what ships are OP.
---
&gt;have rather unexpected outcomes
---
Not really, but depends on what you cater to. If they only care about useless f1-drones in shitsec because they make up some massive chunk of the playerbase, then possibly.
---
If something truly unexpected happens that breaks the game, just revert the change. Its almost as if the reluctance to make quick changes are the problem here.
---
If you kill their VNI without podding them, the bot won't break.
---
It will continue to dock up when hostiles enter the system, warp to forsaken hubs to idle there and warp to the next one when someone else finishes the bot's current anomaly.
---
This was the case 1 month ago but I don't know if they improved their logic since then.
---
I wasn't playing for some time, can somebody explain what is it? last time it was farming SP on unsubed characters. it's the same now?
---
I wouldn’t assume to know what CCP is doing in the background on matters of rebalancing modules and ships. That being said, I know that not seeing results isn’t the same as inaction. 
---
You need relevant data in order to see if things are broken. It takes time to get relevant data on the effects of rebalances, since player need to play around with it a bit to see its full effect. 
---
Also constantly tweaking numbers would not result in much insight, only a frustrated player base that can throw away their first every full moon. 
---
You must have not actually read our Constitution then
---
Oh shit, like an effect captcha. That's cool
---
Ah man good luck with the PC. Yeah, the smaller DEDs are entertaining. I remember running 4/10s in lowsec in my Enyo and getting close a couple times purposefully shooting triggers. I think T3D one-shotting stuff in highsec is a fun, different kind of relaxation :D
---
Anything larger typically took a BS or a hac (back before t3c) and sitting in an Ishtar or a Dominix with drones out shooting the overseer structure was zzzzz. This was quick!
---
Yes.
---
Yeah I run around farming escalations by running anoms and sigs in a 400m isk VNI 😂
---
&gt;Open up a notepad, try writing a decision tree/state machine for a rorqual/VNI bot. I bet you can do it in less than 20 lines of pseudocode, if translated into real code perfectly, it might even be indistinguishable from a human player, while being more efficient.
---
here is my take, went a bit beyond 20 lines to make it easier to read. sorry about the goto's, they're only there for conciseness
---
    DOCK: if (!ship.docked or (ship.is_ready and chat["Local"].is_clear and !(chat["delve.imperium"].hostile_reported_jumps() &lt;= 2)):
---
        ship.undock();
---
        DSCAN: for result in get_anomalies():
---
                if (chat["Local"].is_clear and result.type is "forsaken_hub" and (!result.is_in_dscan_range or dscan(result).is_empty): // check if anom is clear if in dscan range
---
                    result.warp_to(); goto RAT;
---
                else if (!chat["Local"].is_clear and "Tethered" not in ship.effects):
---
                    citadel.dock_at(); goto DOCK;
---
            goto DSCAN; // keep iterating over anomalies until a suitable forsaken hub spawns
---
            RAT: if (!overview.players.is_empty) goto DSCAN; // find another anomaly if another player beat us to it
---
            while (overview.has_hostile_npcs or waiting_for_spawn()):
---
                if (chat["delve.imperium"].hostile_reported_jumps() &lt;= 2):
---
                     ship.align_to(citadel);
---
                else:
---
                    ship.orbit(ship.drones[0], 30000);
---
                if (!chat["local"].clear or chat["delve.imperium"].hostile_reported_jumps() &lt;= 1):
---
                    align_to(citadel);
---
                    ship.modules["afterburner"].deactivate();
---
                    ship.drones.recall();
---
                    ship.modules["afterburner"].activate();
---
    		    ship.drone_bay.launch("wasp");
---
                if (overview.has_hostile_player and "Warp*" in ship.effects): // tackled by hostile player
---
                    mumble.play_recording("help_im_tackled.mp3");
---
                    ship.modules["cyno"].activate();
---
    
---
                overview.get_hostiles().target_all();
---
                ship.drones.attack(overview.next_target());
---
            goto DSCAN; // finished, find next anomaly
---
Is yes?
---
yes?
---
Nice deflection. "Yes, bot is pet of our pet".

I don’t believe this is indicative to game health. I’m guessing a majority of the constant players of EVE do not spend their time googling “EVE Online”. I know I sure don’t. Yet we stay at our constant 22-35k player count for years now. Stop trying to make EVE seem any worse than it has ever been. 
---
I mean, half a trillion, that's like a few hours mining in delve.
---
When I first started playing eve, 1 plex (month sub cost) was like 500m.... it's been inflating consistantly ever since, and probably was long before then too. it's normal, although extreme this time round - but could be attributed to the last plex sale being low and the general grr state of eves players not buying.
---
rorquals used to sit in a pos, boosting system wide, they now have a far more active role and more people can use them. although, I agree they do need to be adjusted, not removed, that's just silly.
---
there's always people that want their game niche buffed and others nerfed, that's long been a thing in eve, you'll get over it... eventually.
---
removing is generally the worst thing to do where as buffing the counter can be way more fun.
---
take Heavy assault frigs/cruisers and the ADC, basically brought 2 whole ship classes back to life.
---
those are the kind of changes we need.
---
Command destroyers - whole new game styles emerged (Drone booshing, stuka etc.)
---
I'm always for add content don't remove.
---
Hush, don't tell them about the magic of serp six/tens
---
Because eve isn't an rts
---
Quick pro tip, it is impossible to kick someone from an alliance you don’t have roles in. 
---
Quality.
---
I still remember ‘back in the day’ when I was doing a lot of hauling with Red Frog. There were more than a few people with balls of steel who would compete to see how many contracts they could get in and out of Jita, during Burn Jita.  
---
They understood to risks, and thought it would be fun.  I still think that was a very entertaining thing.  
---
This is absolutely different than the 99% of the other people that flew their freighter into the meat grinder that is Burn Jita.  They were either indifferent to the risk, totally clueless as to current events, and/or absolutely clueless to evaluating any risk before undocking.  
---
Never bet against Miniluv when they want to blow stuff up.  
---
Who the fuck googles a game, what do you want to find out?
---
You have steam and reddit for that shit
---
Thx mate
---
[oof](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=eve%20online%20plex)
---
Yeah. I'm sure that nearly no one who doesn't already play searching the web for Eve is a good thing.
---
Skimmed the headlines? It's not that I disapprove of it, it's that it's just utterly irrelevant outside of your borders. 
---
My loins are moistened
---
I could say killing the unbalanced is fairly balancing
---
Posting about it
---
&gt; Who the fuck googles a game, what do you want to find out?
---
yeah really insane
---
This is why it's so funny when people smug about super kills in Delve.
---
Like, you can't throw a rock without hitting some pseudo renter nyx. No one cares.
---
I'll ask our IT guy and get back to ya.
---
C1 Wolf Rayet?
---
due to the amount of time it takes you to tab or switch client windows and actually move your hands / fingers across the keyboard or use mouse.
---
It is. 
---
Its not something you do every day. Its not even something most players have done
---
If you clean it more than three times you're playing with it? 
---
Just let micrometeorite impacts and rat scavengers turn them into floating debris fields that explorers can go use data/relic analyzers on, players can go salvage at, and PVPers can hunt around. Would take "bait raitaru" to a new level with PVPers letting a bunch of anchored raitarus deteriorate so they can sit in it with their cloaky ships waiting for easy prey... lol.
---
Bot account, soon to relocate to Period Basis "independent rental botting zone" for increased goon deniability!
---
Is there a Caracal fit that actually handles T3s? I've tried a few times in t3 electrical, and it's never gone well. T2 is a fun little jaunt, though.
---
&gt;Yeah charging people more based on their race is basically fraud. I've posted how you can correct this.
---
Its not based on race though, its based on geolocation. And if its fraud, would you please inform Netflix and Amazon video just for starters among many, many others ?
---
&gt; Its not even something most players have done
---
Yeah you're right, most players just magically appear on eveonline.com to download the client. Insane stuff dude.
---
&gt;Is anyone really surprised?  
---
&gt;Decreased faith in the future of the game = more players refusing to pay for the game and just using the wealth they have in game to get a bit more playtime.  
---
&gt;If CCP announced a deep PLEX sale tomorrow, would you buy any for real cash? I'm done spending on the game in its current state, but I do have almost a trillion in assets.
---
you forgot about all those newbs that keep skilling up, become no longer so new, only to find out that their future holds multiboxed Rorqual mining or VNI ratting, or retarded super ratting for them, and instead of going into that future, they decide to quit or at best stay exclusively as alphas.
---
Ok its possible to be workable except for the " warps away if there are any enemies "
---
You can created a new structure that sends out NPC miners (like the ones we already have) , but you should be the ones to stock the ships and NPC defense fleets don't show up , pay for the ISK to send out miners per run . Have the structure be kill able in a few hours ( say 10m dps cap to reinforce , 2 hour till next timer , another 10m cap and results in a kill. Of course the whole thing revolves around the pricing of the structure and the fee per each miner sent out ( with some sorta cap on # of miners  ) .
---
unsure how the NPC rats should deal with them , i guess just kill them . Of course this excludes anom and moons sites. It would at least give roaming gangs something to do , blow up some NPC piloted but sponsored exhumers and maybe hit up a structure to get a fight out of it.
---
You must be the smartest marketing analyst of all time.   
---
How much do you make?
---
&gt;Multicharacter training is cheaper than sub - but it is still insane amounts of Plex used.
---
Was
---
Currently multitraining certificates are well above 1.8 Bil, very little gap between 500 plex and a cert. We'll see how it plays out.
---
You know there's this thing in psychology called "cognitive dissonance", you should really try reading about it sometimes. 
---
When one player does more than the whole security team. I can't wait for CCP to do nothing about this 
---
Yup, gilas are for gamma, electric, exotic, sacrelige for darks, firestorms i dont know
---
Month ? Ratting carriers are 1.3 bil a piece fully fitted, have you seen the tickst hey do ?
---
I encountered this guy in PVP once, who was the inspiration for me saying it. He pops in for a chance at the loot (which'll easily pay for the fit), and apparently got a nice ransom once. He mentioned he runs T3 electricals, which I think is from this guide:

This sheet has nothing to do with "ghost training" which I believe is what you are referring to. 
---
Ooh, let's go through it point by point.
---
* Rorquals don't cause inflation. They generate minerals. In fact, rorquals are a (nearly imperceptible) isk sink -- they increase fees collected by the server due to increased industry.
---
* Congratulations, regions already have a limit to the number of rats and ore sites they can spawn.
---
* They'll counter scripted bots until the bot writers adapt.
---
* ACLs allow you to put a structure under any flag you want and alphas let you make a functionally unlimited number of dummy corporations. Congratulations, you've done nothing but moderately increase the tedium for less than a hundred people who play the game.
---
* brb, skipping them because they spawn rats and my dumb frigate can't fight them
---
* or you can shoot them lol
---
* I actually agree with this one.
---
* Damage is already done, m8. 
---
Just a simple tailor :).

I'm familiar and that's not relevant.

A google term search is not indicative of game health.   
---
There are many different ways to find EvE; not just through Google.    
---
Also, I play daily since 2006 and I never google EvE anything. I know where to go.   
---
I've recently brought in 3 players into EvE who completely bypassed google and went straight to [EveOnline.com](https://EveOnline.com) because I linked it in Discord.   
---
What metrics are you trying to prove?  
---
Because 1 or 2 search terms trending over time from 1 search engine is not exactly what you call a "data set" indicating interest on a subject. You're just being stupid. 
---
I hope you will at least ask them, nicely, initially, to do the right thing. That you can certainly do.
---
1/10 troll or just fucking retarded. 
---
Conveniently, that was done two hours ago. It’s amazing how that works. 
---
Like skins and these awesome gala events 
---
That's what happens when you rely on the video game to tell you about itself.   
---
Meta or DIAF. 
---
Did you report a bug or just paste it on Reddit? 
---
You missed banning 1% of the bots and tell the community they are looking into it.
---
With what it has something to do then? What's it doing?
---
Qu'est ce que t'a encore fait vieille drama queen va? xD
---
&gt; I'm familiar and that's not relevant.
---
It is.
---
&gt;A google term search is not indicative of game health.
---
&gt;Also, I play daily since 2006 and I never google EvE anything. I know where to go.
---
It's not about old folks, it's about new folks.
---
&gt;I've recently brought in 3 players into EvE who completely bypassed google
---
Anecdotal evidence.
---
&gt;Because 1 or 2 search terms trending over time from 1 search engine is not exactly what you call a "data set" indicating interest on a subject.
---
I would actually consider google search trends as pretty solid indicators of people's interest in a given subject. But I guess if you really want to hang on to your love for a dying game, then any indication that the game might actually not be doing as well as you want it to is easily brushed off.
---
Blizzard actually started doing a really good job obfuscating and encrypting their client since the HonorBuddy lawsuit. Even if you manage to reverse it and make a bot for the current version, the obfuscation changes with every patch, so you have to reverse it again, and they also made the whole process very tedious.
---
It's been very effective, the only bots that are out there use either OCR or sound detection, not memory reading. 
---
I believe Riot is using [similar tech](https://engineering.riotgames.com/news/riots-approach-anti-cheat) for League of Legends.
---
As for EVE, they basically give botters a Python scripting API built right into the client, lol. OCR is also very effective (for obvious reasons), although they took some steps to make it harder with the transparent windows on potato settings.
---
I was talking about super caps though which are a lot more expensive.
---
Just because you think this makes sense with marijuana doesn't mean it will work for a 1 server video game.   
---
Show me a healthy multiplayer game that allows botting. 1 example. Just 1. 
---
Please look at the linked page for a full feature description. The gist of it is that it assists people with skill queue tracking and brain farming. 
---
I 100% check for a subreddit more frequently than I google games I'm interested in.
---
I might do straight up YT searches for gameplay though.
---
You honestly believe people don't at least google an mmorpg when they're considering to pick it up?
---
It's actually insane to me that you want to pretend people don't use google to get information about eve.
---
Exactly.
