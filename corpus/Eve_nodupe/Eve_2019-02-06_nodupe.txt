Don't try to apply real life to Eve. Such as: real life battleships would use a mix of gun sizes to contend with various types of enemies. That's not how Eve works.
---
Read the bonuses for the ship. Plan your fit to make use of those. 
---
You don't always have to use the biggest guns in the class: sometimes you can get more damage out of smaller guns because you can fit more damage modifiers.
---
Until you really know what you're doing, only use one type of tank (shield/armor/hull). Either fit buffer (high health) or active (self repairing), not both. 
---
Resistances are important and can double your ship's staying power. 
---
Hells Yeeeeaaaa ---- Kinda upset  I had to scroll down this far to have anyone finally  recognized it !

Web lokis with ur fleet

Yeah definitely, I spend a good amount of time dwelling on my deaths and thinking about how I fucked up, what they did to out think me, etc. No point getting mad/sad about them, just use them as a lesson and get as much as you can out of the experience. No loss is a waste if you use it to improve yourself.
---
It's an old meme, but it checks out
---
The activation of a command destroyer's special module that micro-jumps everybody near it 100km away, the MJFG.
---
it didn't lol
---
At least they were all rails.
---
What’s a good dps/ehp to start at least trying to pvp?
---
So since we're calling out Bastion lets remember that only a very small fraction of Bastion have been participating in Syndicate/ORE for the past 3-4 months. (can find that all out by doing 30 seconds of browsing on zkill)   
---
This really isn't surprising they didn't pull numbers because its the same group of people in the area doing everything else as well. Sorry that you didn't get a full on imperium invasion for your t1 rigged raitaru making fuel blocks lol. 
---
&gt;The ships I lose to capitals can be replaced. The parts of my soul that I lose from reading stainguy can never be replaced.

1 read = 1 sould shard added to the gate
---
Or reading the subreddit they are posting in.
---
Nice BR strange though how you made real sure to only select the system where no stations died so that the 5 stations that fleet popped before going after another one of yours don't show up on the KB. What's it like to be so shit you have to BS BR's to feel better than Bastion?
---
Bastion was busy popping 4 other towers owned by these leet lords of PVP the real BR is linked below and shows all the tower losses before they bothered to show up for the last one where they feed all their guardians saving the tower.
---
The point of eve is to play how you want. So if someone wants to play that way who the hell aee you to say otherwise
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

---
That’s not how PvP works. People will suggest you start cheap with frigates so you learn your engagement range. It takes losing ships to start to know what your limits are. Different ships and different fits are designed to do different things. 
---
So damage and defense don’t matter in pvp?
---
Slightly more than your opponent, I guess. I wouldn't think of it in those terms. Try to find a buddy and fight him. Start in frigates and try to kite each other. 
---
Pedophiles, rapists, murderers. These people dont get "fixed", you execute them. They're broken. People like you are why people like this get out and do more harm. Sorry you're an enabler.

This is really irrelevant to CCP and Eve.

Also hes guilty, they dont accidentally charge you with what he is charged with

Hello there.

You had the right idea, if the enemy comes too close for your first railgun, you can use the second which has a lower range!

Luckily its very hard to bomb yourself if you only got an ab :P

Click between the two, there are a ton.

I looked at their in game description and they had the same bonuses and stuff, that’s what I meant.
---
They don't have the same bonuses. The VNI has a drone tracking and velocity bonus while the Vexor has a hybrid turret bonus.
---
oh no
---
this either a low effort bait post or a no effort real post, I can't tell which. just searching "botting" in this sub would have answer your question in a few seconds.

there's a search function on this sub you could have used.
---
Wouldn’t RLM cerbs have been a more appropriate response to stukas than arty munins...
---
Im in awe of how fast the munins died, does anyone know if they actually turned on the assault dcus 
---
As I said I prefer fleets and just because it does not meet your shit gang setup doesnt discount it. And yeah I already said I was wrong about the old drones. Shit happens. Just like hoe you're wrong for breathing air and wasting oxygen on your two brain cells. And done messaging you piece of human waste.
---
I wish you could see this in game for sure.  
---
Discovering pyfa, and the ability to see stats like that, was a revelation.
---
your main is in a super and your on reddit asking how to fit a frig. wtf dude.
---
Free to play limits the ships and modules you can use, in december of 2017 there was an update giving free players access to more things, but paying more money isn't an automatic 'win button' a player who doesnt know what he is doing in a blingy ship he spent real money on would lose a fight to someone who knows what he is doing. the current free to play system offers people to be able to get into the game to a point where they can enjoy it long enough to see the benefit of premium. the only real way of knowing if you will find it worth your time is by trying it. 
---
lol guess you didn't like that reality huh. You talked so much shit from the start when in truth you're a low IQ pleb krab who only has experience F1 mashing and anchoring an FC. You intellectual dwarf. You're not worth the pixels that let you know how stupid you are.

Use 2 chars; 1 for the suicide gank, the other to hold him to have him watch how his own wreck gets scooped by his own MTU.

Yeah. Think of the F2P version as a trial version while you get your bearings and See what you’d wanna do. What I’d recommend is [a modified braves newbies plan](http://goddamnpatriot.blogspot.com/2014/08/greetings-loved-ones-it-is-i-damn_3.html?m=1) depending on what ships you want to fly.
---
You make being prejudiced sound like a good thing!
---
You are the type of person that if people disagree with you they are wrong. You cant deal with that level of stupidity. Pvp is pvp fuck if its solo small gang or fleet. Killing is killing. Just because your trash gang pvp is your content does not mean it's the I ly content. So... with that I'm done dealing with you, your life means literally nothing and likely never will. Good day.
---
I never said if it was good or bad... just stating facts. It sounds like you brought your prejudice into this.
---
who? Your next door neighbor and his cat?

How does grid size or drag bubbles change anything with pipebombing? Stop bubbles still exist, you wait for the scout to go through, then decloak sabre, bubble, then once they warp you light cyno. Am I missing something?

idk what stats are now but when I went to uni they were saying that sex criminals have the highest rates of recidivism even with mental/social treatment. basically your best case is that a pedo would manage to not touch kids but still have the feelings, with low rates of people getting the best-case outcome.
---
OP's day so far, shit post about server issues and blame CCP, get downvoted, blame brigading for the downvotes, get downvoted some more, completely ignore that everyone else seems to play and respond by saying "people" you asked have the same issue, get downvoted even more.

A fool and his rev are easily parted.

I never coped with loss well enough to play eve, that's why I only build ships for others to lose and don't play the game other than that.
---
There's no way this is remotely true
---
Vote for me for the next Imperium leader vote in 2069, I will make The Imperium great again, kicking dead weight out of The Imperium, building a well of keepstar from fountain to cache and I will make the north/legacy/LSH pay for it 
---
Given the recent 800-man fights right outside the largest market hub in the game, in which both sides are fielding many F2P "alpha" accounts in the same ships of the line as the veterans, you can certainly access a lot of what others can in the game.
---
Subverted are not as good, unless they buffed them
---
yes fuker
---
Reverse boosh back to where they jumped you from
---
It's fun enough to get into some small gang pvp, or group pve, but your ability to make isk is pretty low. It's a great way to explore the game and do the tutorials, and do some missions as well. It's more fun if you are getting the daily alpha injectors. 
---
and then getting fragged by a lowsec group when the boosher tries to take them to highsec instead of just selling them back to goons.
---
You think I'm wrong because I disagree with you. Why are you making a special pleading case for yourself? F1 krab gonna be trash.
---
I have not a damn clue what I’m looking at, op. But upvote for effort. 
---
free to play limits you, but not to an extent where its not fun to play. Being a subscriber has obvious advantages, but you won't be in a position to use them for the first several months as you learn to play and start building your character through skills anyway.
---
its certainly a good way to get your feet wet in New Eden.
---
Yes. Yes it is
---
I'm a f2p player and you can have a lot of fun without paying anything. There's a lot of things to do. I've been playing for around 8 months and I'm not bored yet, and I haven't even trained into battleships yet, so there's a lot more content waiting for me before I would have to subscribe.
---
If you spent around $700 buying plex and selling it in game, you might be able to buy and fit a single titan class ship. Assuming you had enough skill points to fly it, you could take it out into space, where 40 nerds in dreadnoughts would show up and kill it in less than an hour.
---
Then you'd have to spend another $700, and the same thing would happen again. Paying to win, while technically possible, just isn't worth it. 
---
For ASBs you want the smallest charge that will fit since they all rep the same. For cap boosters, it varies. You have to balance your cap sticks to how much cap you'll need to use immediately. If you're neuted out, you want to be able to inject and cycle all your mods (tank usually) to drain your own cap for a productive use instead of letting it get neuted out.
---
In other words, if you inject 400 cap and use 400 cap to rep yourself, that's ideal. If you inject 800 cap, use 400 to rep yourself, and the other 400 gets neuted away, you lost out on cap.
---
VNI ratting isn't terrible as an alpha... It's not great, but a little VNI ratting could easily fund a smallgang pvp career.
---
there was this crazy video about grid-fu where with the old grids you could have bombers sit just beyond the grid - firing bombs with impunity into the grid where the bubble is, so people would land on a bubble, get bombed, bombs don't hit the bombs which are still on the other side of the grid (meaning you can rapid-fire) and bam - dead fleet.
---
that's like the only thing that can even come close maybe
---
I mean honestly alpha is better for null gameplay since a majority of their doctrines are based around t1 ships like t1 bs or bc
---
Small gamg typically uses many more t2 shipa, which alphas cant use
---
I see you went to the DRF FC school.

Of all the species of cats, the domestic cat is the only species able to hold its tail vertically while walking. All species of wild cats hold their tail horizontally or tucked between their legs while walking.

Nothing announced. They did add aggression timer to booshes though
---
yikes/ten
---
First of all web lokis probably aren't in range for these fleets. Also in most fleets these days the booshers are anchored to the FC so they don't change trajectories on their own.

T1 BS are very much out of the meta due to HACs.  HACs are the more common doctrine even for alliances like Brave.
---
he didnt say u were mad he said u were a salty cunt 
---
Thats more about actually flying the ship than fitting it
---
This is true, and this man is wise, HAW dread are in fact very weak.
---
1st rule of eve. Bigger they are, harder they fall. Your not missing out as a free to play member.
---
no because its f2p means it is a bad game
---
no its a spy wtf
---
Big ships are behind a pay wall but the small ships are some of the most important ships in the game. If you can can fly the bigger ships you have played the game for at least a month or two and will likly be ok paying the 8.99 access fee.
---
Once you are used to this game you can buy the Primium account with ingame currancy.
---
Ravens and feroxs still get used. I flew by a maller vs caracal brawl earlier today, and brave constantly pings for canes or corms. Maybe the like once a wek or month fleets use hacs, but the standard day to day content is a lot of t1
---
How much would it suck to be one of those rorq pilots sitting there and watching your entire rescue fleet get disassembled right in front of you knowing the whole time you're next and it's all your fault for not being ready to light a cyno while you still could?
---
You don't even need 50 really, their were 18 people on the killmail in my Tama fight, but the Leshak did close to 50% of the damage, if you can tank via some combination of range, traversal, resists, logi (which takes 4-5 logi, and the right ships to tank it), then it's a question of how fast you want the kill, the HAW dread gets help or it uses up it's cap boosters and dies.
---
My rule of thumb when going into wormholes is once I get enough loot to cover my ships costs I come out and store it. Then I hop back in and if I lose it oh well it already paid for itself! 
---
is there anything not on that list at this point? Feroxes, supers, titans, caps in general, booshers, rorqs, mining and ratting anoms, moon mining, local channels, some guy yesterday in regards to this fleet was crying about how bombers are OP for their cost...

so you saved a t1 fit raitaru that was probably only reinforced to generate content while maintaining a 24% efficiency in the fight... you probably lost more isk in logi to save the thing than it was worth... but congrats! sounds like op success for everybody.

I prefer maxmatar

That's not how it works. The creator of the .gif format says it with a hard j-like sound, whereas anyone civilised and not brain dead will know that a soft g is the only sensible way to pronounce it and so of course the way it's done by most people.

Please search "is eve worth" and limit that search to this subreddit. After you have read all those posts. if you have any questions, please ask them.

do many WH corps accept Alphas though?
---
I PLEXed off trial a few times before Alpha accounts and the quickest way I found was faction war defensive complexing. 2.4B in 14 days.
---
I'd probably try salvaging behind newbie friendly corp ratters if I wanted to try it again and beat my record.
---
Then there is the shield/amour tanked Erebus! Fit like that to eat DDs and live in TiDi fest fights
---
As I mentioned earlier...Erebus with shield + armor tank. Whilst it sounds beyond stupid, in a TiDi fest, it's ft for purpose of eating DDs and being able to DD themselves. After all no need to boost damage of normal guns when the only thing that matters is surviving the DD alpha and providing DDs to your sides alpha
---
Sounds like your corp is not cutting it. Maybe joining a bigger corp with more chances for you to learn the hardcore stuff. 
---
PH and I am sure others have Padawan programs. Where a more experienced player will be your personal tutor. If you want to be an FC your tutor will just be in the fleet with you as back up. PH also has an anyone can ping policy if you want to just take a fleet out you can.
---
If a bigger corp is not your style, try other money making things like abyssal or incursions.
---
That's a lot of words for someone who didn't read the definition of the word they linked to sound intellectually superior:  
---
**"Aposematism** (from Ancient Greek ἀπό *apo* away, σῆμα *sema* sign) refers to the appearance of an animal that **warns** [**predators**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation) **it is toxic, distasteful or dangerous**. This warning signal is associated with the **unprofitability of a prey item to potential predators.**[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aposematism#cite_note-1) **The unprofitability may consist of any defences which make the prey difficult to eat, such as toxicity, foul taste or smell, sharp spines, or aggressive nature."**  
---
Note, that whilst yes you are correct that the bright colours are a warning, as I pointed out, it is not a warning of bad intentions, it is to warn off P R E D A T O R S.   
---
It says 'Fuck off, I don't taste nice, you die, I die, it's not worth it, go eat something else', not 'Fuck off or I'll make you my dinner'. Toxicity in animals is a self defense mechanism that prey animals predominantly use to protect themselves from predators, not to attack weaker prey. 
---
Pedophilia, or any other time of sexually exploitative behaviour is not a prey behaviour, hence the term sexual **PREDATOR**.  
---
All of this is irrelevant because we are not freaking lizards, or birds, by the way.  
---
Hair colour is a personal fashion choice not an evolutionary warning signal to indicate someone is a pedophile, you absolute twatwaffle.  
---
Go hunting solo (for a small gang) or roaming in a small gang. 
---
I like your ascii guy

I've seen day 1 accounts flying cyno fit sabres scouting for hot drop dread fleets, in this day and age of instant skills by way of injectors the age of the character on the info page means absolutely nothing.

It's funny watching you squirm and suddenly try to be the "better person" but most people that have read this realise you're the retard that needs a good punch to the side of the head.
---
It's a good way to hide their failure to build anything up After WWB. It is way easier to blame CCP and Goons. 
---
I say yes. Try it, for free, if it's fun, you win. Nothing ventured nothing gained.
---
why would they buy them in highsec and spend the money to ship them when they can just buy them at a comparable price in delve? Its not like we are short on excavs hell the price has been falling of late they are down several hundred million per unit from a only a few months ago.
---
Ashes to Ashes, Rust to Rust
---
Station trading really? Hmm, would take a bit to really get that started with such little ISK.
---
Can you do that in high sec? (Honest question; I avoid that place except for shipping trips) 
---
Hell yea, PLEXing before Alpha accounts existed during those 14 day trials. I wasted so many email accounts trying to do that lol.
---
Good thought.
---
I... think so? I know I had a friend who would use a hecate to shoot wrecks to piss off mission runners, then kill _them_ for loot.
---
It's been ages since I've been in high sec, and every time I go I get a little weirded out by how many ~~threats~~ targets there are.
---
I just.....wtf am I looking at? Is the background duct taped creampie? Is it drywall and blankets? I'm so confused...

Question about doing abyssal sites with 1 main dps and 1 logi. What ships and fits are the suitable for a 2-man fleet?
---
I think I know what you're talking about, I believe I saw that video, but yeah, I still don't see how current mechanics prevent pipebombing in any way.

That’s cause you’re just a krab.

Chicken or the egg.......fly it according to the fitting or fit it according to the flying?
---
Reddit has always had bots though. This sub endorses some of them. Saying things like, "good bot"
---
This is the quality content I'm here for.
---
That’s a really cool idea it would help us at least when we are trying to intercept crit holes and need to know what/ how much stuff we should bring in 
---
To explain how this *could* work, knowing absolutely fuck all about this case:
---
-Dude arranges for hooker and it's a sting
---
-Hooker makes some kind of statement intimating being under age, dude either doesn't receive it or doesn't get it
---
-Dude shows up to bang said hooker and gets busted for "soliciting underage prostitute" or some jazz. 
---
Again, no idea if that's what happened here but it has happened before. IMO crimes of a sexual nature should be sealed until trial because of things like the above. 
---
Thanks man
---
No snitching or mittens will get ccp to ban you, true story, an exgoon made a reddit post about it

Because its the only thing you seem to do, make sure everything is about a corp that revolves around tiny, who's stepped down

Sure, let me know when mcav logoff traps a single dread with three phoenix's. Waste of time.

Although, that's a weeks worry of content for your corp.

&gt;Most of the arrestees, ranging in age from 20 to 55, traveled from areas around metropolitan Atlanta with the intent to meet a child for sex. Multiple people were arrested who were in possession of suspected illegal drugs. Twenty-four digital devices were seized as evidence and processed during the operation. 
---
and 
---
&gt;During “Operation Interception,” the Georgia ICAC Task Force conducted proactive online undercover investigations utilizing sites that are known to be used to advertise for the sex industry. 
---
Lead be to believe the cops ran their sting on back page or some shit. So it's *possible* he wanted an adult hooker and got stung.
---
&gt;Investigators also conducted proactive undercover investigations using applications frequented by adults to find casual sexual partners. The investigators made 20 arrests as a result of utilizing standard dating and social media applications.
---
Oh fuck they're on tinder too lol get wrecked
---
&gt;Over the course of the operation, over 63 cases were established that met the threshold for arrest. Twenty-one of those cases were concluded with arrests. During the multi-day operation, investigators had close to 200 exchanges with subjects on various social media or internet platforms. Many of those were exchanges in which the subject initiated contact and even after discovering they were conversing with a minor, directed the conversation towards sex. In some of those cases, the subject introduced obscene or lude content, often exposing the minor (law enforcement officer) to pornography or requesting the child take nude or pornographic images for them.
---
Two types of people i guess.
---
Those that never go back, and those that see other myrm fits on ZKill and think "what the fuck was I doing?" 😉
---
they don't outside of that one situation
---
Eve PvP is all about the combat. Go into FW space and roam solo. Use the FW gate mechanics. Solo fighting blingy faction frigs and winning the fight on 1% structure is what i play this game for. You’ll find the rush is the best thing this game can offer.
---
I find flying in fleets boring as hell. All you do is act like a voice controlled bot for your FC.
---
Lol. You must lead a boring life. 
---
Correct.  I never did exploration (running relic/data sites that is), so I'm asking about it before I go do it.  Just like before I ratted in a super I did research on how to do it, and when I was running incursions before that, I asked questions before I did it.  I'm not one to bling fit a ship and just go out and try something without looking into it first.  But hey, I fit took out a t2 fit astero and made 30mil my first site.  Took about 15 minutes to run it.  Not a bad alternative to ratting and much much less at risk.  Granted it's not a 90-100mil tick, but it's fun and new (to me). 
---
Cormorants look cool as fuck tho wtf???
---
I think it boils down to your corp tbh.  If you have a good group of guys who want to do the same thing (in your case pvp it seems) you can have a ton of fun in 1-3 hours a night.  
---
Lol, keep telling yourself that.
---
I'm not a wormholer but have used them a lot. I feel like this would take a lot of the fun, rng and danger out of it. Atm it's intentionally vague which leads to content if people get rolled out especially mid fight. If this was a thing it'd completely ruin this aspect which would be a net loss. And it would just make crabholes even safer. 
---
Ships can be insured.
---
Oh in that case, I might have looked at the info of the same vexor, my bad. I keep forgetting that a lot of this info of this game is in the wiki
---
1) The database entries are purely lore items designed to give you hints to the Triglavian goals, and culture. 
---
2) Sounds like you have it right. I bring a tractor beam in my utility high
---
3) T4s ramp up in a few ways. I did fine for 20 T4s then one Firestorm spawned 4 Starving Leshaks.
---
4) I think your guess is as good as anyone elses at this point.

I joined last year as a free to play account, and stayed that way for ~6 min without feeling too limited. I don’t think much has changed since then, 
---
This game includes a hugely established base of players. Being a new player is nearly impossible as every time you do something to get ahead someone else will come along and blow you up. A huge sense of paranoia is necessary &amp; even that isn't good enough, you are going to die; alot.... And no one cares. 
---
I recommend no one starts this game new at this point, you are just bait: creating content for an already established (lonely &amp; bored) player base. 
---
Easier said than done for a new player. If you aren’t careful even a ratting fit Vexor can solo a t1 frig

Do we really need to make the game more casual?

Invest about 150 billion in your excavator stealing scheme and earn about 6-7 b/hr stealing mining drones. Make your investment back in a month or so, then just keep doing it until you don't want anything else to buy.
---
Actually it's pronounced gif
---
I'm assuming this means I'd need to be running multiple alts at once. My current pc would probably light on fire if I did more than three or four
---
I like the way you think
---
That what you think is a good idea in traditional scifi is not a good idea here, I once fit small medium and large guns on a apocalypse. It's ok noobs its happened to all of us.
---
No, not my slow internet and GB limit. 
---
I can confirm that dreddit is in fact recruiting. 
---
That’s OG who you replied to. He’s the Micheal Jordan of multi boxing. What he does is only for people with OCD
---
Given that EVE generally demands more of you than a wife and a couple of kids do... casual is perhaps the wrong word.
---
But it's the same in WoW. You pick a build to do something well and then go "all-in". "Allrounder" builds don't perform well in WoW either.

I am a dumbo :(

He sells his drones locally though, so that doesnt make sense

thanks a lot mate, but I search now I would like to know if I can get an Id from words.

I have two pages one for the calculation, the other for the ids.

DO you understand?
---
It's "don't fly what you can't afford to lose."
---
What you can afford to lose is what you are willing to lose/ok to lose.
---
He wasn't willing to lose that once it was full of loot so he shoulda headed home instead of continuing and getting killed.

Im not trying to be the better person, I'm just trying to help you with your sexual tension.

Also lest we forget, YOU are responding to ME, as I didn't post to you, you responded to one of MY posts.  I know perspective must be hard to maintain when you're so incredibly sexually frustrated so I'll keep you on point.

I honestly cant remember how long ago it was when it took me a month to make a billion. I'm sitting at about 4 billion income per day. I know it take a while to get to that point...but even afk VNI forsaken hubs can get you 500 million a day and you dont even have to try.

I was just farming Serpentis Refuge for the 3/10 escalation and scanned down a couple 4/10. Upgraded my Vexor to a VNI tonight and tomorrow I'll pick up with the same thing.

Stop using Facebook for Eve my dude.
---
if you do, one quick tip that no one really explained that well to me:
---
tech 1 ships (ones that anyone, free to play or subscribed can fly) have their purposes. t2 variants arent straight upgrades. they serve different purposes and have different bonuses. same goes for faction variants. theyre more like specialized side grades usually. some are better, but even in those cases, the cost different still makes the t1 versions viable. 
---
so when youre looking at your ship tree, and seeing the t2 things you cant fly without a subscription, dont get too discouraged. you can still be very useful in the t2 ships. (:
---
Yeah it requires a certain level of autism even unique for eve players
---
Or you could get a gila, though may not be worth the price point 
---
Yeah not really, plus I don't have the skills for one lol
---
Warp to Me Incursions 
---
Bombers bar, spectre fleet
---
No not really as a long time Eve player I think they need to remove a lot of restrictions for free accounts. Like access to all ships with a 10mil SP limit .
---
Not really. 
---
You got your tetanus shot, right?
---

---
Says the guy who just did that which he accused the other of... 
---
Backwards.  Your Eve ability will siffer if you don't put down your foot and tell your significant other "This is Eve time!"
---
"wahh the dirty blobbers didn't all have the same alliance ticker, waaah"
---
yeah - because it's not worth a subscription to participate in.
---
"A ship with range bonuses is meant to fight at a distance"
---
Not necessarily.  Range bonus on a brawl fit can he just enough to keep you out of range on the other guy with no range bonus.  Like extra range on rockets that keep you at the edge of scram range while the enemy blasters miss you entirely.
---
yeah but "supercapital TiDi tanking strategy" is pretty far off course from "how should you generally fit a ship"
---

beyond that, i don't really need isk so I don't bother going out of my way to make it. maybe i'll let a VNI orbit a rock while I watch netflix or play something else, though.
---
&gt;Make your investment back in a month or so

probably less if you don't have to replace jump freighters.

None of you want justice. None of you give a shit about "making people feel safe" or "getting them off the streets" or any other bullshit. Life in prison would accomplish exactly that. What you all want is vengeance, petty vengeance, to make yourselves feel better.

You don't see the difference between a procedural execution and a drawn out, dramatic, public dismemberment and rape? What the fuck is wrong with you? One of them is a punishment and the other is self satisfying torture.

if you watch the actual stream you will see that zarvox flies without guns on his UI just tackle mods, he couldn't shoot a pod if he wanted too.

---
Yeah, I have 1000 hours in this game in like the 1.5 years I’ve been playing, I’ve actually been alpha most of that time.
---
Even if you pay it to play you wont understand what you are paying for at least for 2 months. I am not a good player any sort of in this game i got 8 accounts and only two of them are paid. I have enough ingame money to buy a subscription but i dont need it. Give this game a shot dont pay anything. Dont pay anything to ANYONE. 
---
At first you wont k ow what you are doing, what you should expect and eve's totarial wont add much other than basics. In the other hand eve's communty is awsome. There are tons of ppl who are more willing to help you to figure out stuff.  
---
As i mentioned above you can buy subscription with in game money. Just dont expect it to happen soon. You need to have some understanding on game. You need to play, watch, read. Be social. Ask everyone but dont trust them. Just ask. Learn mechanics. 
---
Dont feel overhelm ammount of the mechanics you need to know. Even 5 years old players dont know every aspect of the game.
---
I played lots of mmorpgs before eve they just didnt make it for me. Now i am playing Eve tried to make my friends play it only one of them hooked rst is not playing. So not push yourself hard. Its not something everyone enjoys.
---
Eve is an universe which you are free to do whatever you want. There is something avaible that everyone enjoys.. You just need to find what is it for you.

Haha. This man hasn't had sex in 12 months.

If you haven't seen it already. here is a kinda old review for the game by Mnadalore Gaming, which I feel is probably the most accurate review I've seen so far, and well worth the 30 minute video. I think it gives the best overview of the games aspects, with a slightly comedic slant.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui7ZTlfNngc
---
To answer your question from someone who has been playing on and off since 2012, yes it is worth getting into even as f2p, it does limit what you can do, but in terms of Pay 2 win, blatantly looking at it, you can 100% dump a bunch of money into the game and buy skills and items, however, I have never felt that I was at a disadvantage because someone could buy it. Someone who knows the game better will almost always win against someone who buys more expensive stuff. 
---
All that said, you can pay for monthly subscriptions with in-game money. In my experience, it's not as unrealistic as some other MMOs that offer the same kind of thing. I have a friend that has runs 6 active, subscribed accounts and has never paid a cent for EVE, and i'm not talking no-lifing it either, he works full time, and plays other games with us most days.
---
Not necessarily.
---
Sometimes connection issues happen because - for one reason or another - the traffic is being funneled through less then optimal routes. It's entirely possible that routing your traffic through a VPN could clear up those kind of issues, simply because the route taken to the VPN server ends up being different from the route that would otherwise be chosen.
---
Small channels that are good will turn to shit with large influxes of people who don't care about the channels culture. This happens in every single online discussion forum ever.

All these ideas are fucking shit and you're dumb

The TEST logi channels are not set correctly and allow anyone to join.

Fair enough, my bad.

I heard it was, didn't care enough to actually verify.
---
a. You shouldn't encourage people to show up in hulks or other gank magnets in the first place.
---
b. You're running active mining ops in highsec, nobody is getting rich here. Do you actually want to have a corp, and not just some guys that join for mining boosts then move on as soon as they learn to make better money elsewhere? Or are you just there for the easy cut from having an orca alt? Nobody is going to stay with you long term if the only thing you offer is a "free" boost. Highsec is full of corps like that.

I read this twice....and fully understood that this is exactly what I do between fleets. 
---
I'm not. We have a legal system where you're innocent until convicted, and it should be like that, period.

In cases like this you can always put the accused in jail before trial and can put the appropriate bail restrictions in place to protect the public.

&gt;I really want to find my niche in this game and join the history of EVE!
---
Fortunately enough, nobody can help you with that realy. You have to find out yourself. Find a profession you'll like, be it combat or whatever else. Eve doesnt realy have much content bundled in it, nor should it. All whats worth something is generated by actions of others. So yeah, find a good group and start the search for your "thing"
---
Choose a specific role. Eve let's you do that nicely, but you will get discouraged a lot when higher skilled pilots can just do everything better and quicker. I'd warn against joining a big corp or alliance. They tend to do larger scale battles and you'll feel pointless. Solo for the first few months. Then join faction war. Die a lot in cheap ships. Then find your niche and join a corp.

Not only this, but they're arguably *more* useful, and with more people willing to chip in to replace it if it goes boom if you're doing what you probably *should* be and looking for some people to cause trouble with.
---
Eve ***CAN*** be played solo, but it doesn't shine until you have at least a couple of other malcontents to work alongside and show you the ropes. A lot of people understand that while Eve is ruthless, trying to dick over somebody who has nothing because they've just started playing is wasted effort as you have nothing to steal.
---
This also means you have nothing to lose by trying some things.
---
And don't be afraid to lose a bunch of ships. If they're exploding, it means you're getting learning opportunities.

Yes. Some already mentioned things like people use Feroxes on alpha accounts for certain things. The key is to create more than one account and focus the different characters. One might be supposed to fly a Ferox, one to fly caracal/vexor/gila, another one might skill into a vindi, machariel, or nightmare for incursions so that you can make isk. (only one of the many many ways to make isk)

why are corpmates agressing you in the last panel, is this part of the story?

&gt;  Life in prison would accomplish exactly that

You honestly dont realize how wrong this statement is do you?  It doesn't cost them a dime to spend life in prison. You pay for that, I pay for that.  The criminal doesn't pay shit.   He gets free meal services, a home, 100% free health care, 100% free dental care, 100% free optical care, his mail delivered, his laundry done for him, and a uniformed guard comes and tells him once a week that his family is here to visit him.
---
He'll be living that life still thinking about fucking little kids.
---
Also there is no difference in how you kill somebody, if you kill them, you're still a killer.  Execute them through painful lethal injection where the drugs are an unsteady cocktail, pour electricity into their body until their eyes and mouth belch smoke (the hood doesn't really stop that from leaking out) or run them through an industrial sized wood chipper. 
---
Killing is killing, and life imprisonment absolutely isn't a punishment, seeing your arm torn off by an adult male lion while you're trapped in his zoo enclosure, now thats a learning moment.

True, but for rattles and gilas the main dps comes from drones, which isn't the case for drakes. If you'd only use rlml or rhml to clear sites you'd suffer a lot of time effiency from the reloads. Also the rlml in gilas are used to take down small stuff and the containers, so you can keep your heavy dps drones dealing with the tankier targets. And if you happen to encounter remote repping opponents, you're going to lose a lot of dps if you don't manage to kill the target before your reload.

No way bro. Learn to solo first. Getting whatever you want doesn't make you any better and it for sure doesn't give you the experience you'll need. Jumping in some places without knowing where or who you'll be with us naive. Go solo and then make a choice. Duh

Can’t really see your point after Kids With Guns just folded in LBFB
---
Is it a good look when you're called the Holy Rental Empire?
---
No. No it is not.
---
We used the corp mining ledger, and a website that one of our guys built. I don't know how all of the nitty gritty stuff worked, but basically anyone in our alliance that mined was tracked on the website (from the mining ledger) and everything would be auto-calculated to determine the value of the reprocessed minerals, and we'd get paid a portion. I can't recall the exact numbers, but for R32 members would get paid like 50% of the reprocessed mineral value, and for R64 we'd get paid roughly 10% (R32 ores would be roughly 500 ISK/m3 and R64 would be between 900-1000 ISK/m3). 
---
aka Fuck you button

Didn't KWG pay TEST for a region or something to fund their RMT empire? And if they're folding with LBFB nothing is going to change. No one should speak on the matter ;)

&gt;seeing your arm torn off by an adult male lion while you're trapped in his zoo enclosure, now thats a learning moment
---
Haha you've gotta be like 16. That's not a "learning moment" that's "I need to see suffering to feel satisfied with this scenario". Nobody advocating for this gives a shit about justice, or progress, or anyone's safety. If a person is getting executed, why do they need to be "taught a lesson"? You said it yourself, killing is killing, either way they're dead, what does their suffering accomplish besides making you feel better? As if the victim's pain has been soothed because their attacker had the same thing done to them. Your inability to see the point has made me come to the conclusion that this conversation is pointless, so have a great night.
---
I don't think you know how corps that help new people like horde/brave/karma fleet actually teach new players. These corps don't just give them free shit they have people dedicated to helping new players learn any aspect of the game. People running Q+A classes, new people chats, fleets based of teaching a specific part of the game, forums full of information better/more detailed than other sources, etc. There is not a single advantage to learning anything but the basic game mechanics as a solo new player.
---
&gt;research shows pedophiles are more likely to be left-handed

Why should someone boycott twitch over kotaku? (FYI you'll find a lot more people on this sub that boycott kotaku)

what was not 100% clear to me as a new player in 2014 is the fact that each ship has a fixed role and not everything can be max dps brawler w/ infinite tank (god my hurricane was such a shitfit) 
---
yea but you got dunked by an atron 
---
I rolled a new character and day 1 went out to Stain and made 250mill. But then again i know what to look for, i bounced to avoid drag bubbles on gates, spammed dscan, checked killboard of a cloaky camper.

They learn nullsec 201 when they should learn eve 101 first. I will always recommend at least a month of finding themselves in E-Uni's multiple campuses. Its better than shoveling truly new players into 0.0 to become just another cog in a machine.

---
While belonging to a small corporation might make you feel like you are needed could make you more engaged into the game, the big corp experience is equally good at least on the learning part. Brave has a very nice standing fleet where people are more than helpful and willing to explain any aspect of the game, dreddit has mentors that are designated to newbros, and I'm pretty sure PH, Karmafleet and the others have the same thing. Also, even in a big corporation, there's maybe 20-30 dudes that are talkative and you can just hop into conversations, ask stuff. The common practice in Brave was every time someone asked a question was either answered in slack / mumble or taken to a private channel where discussion were had for hours. The "I feel like a number" is a choice, day one newbros are encouraged to lead fleets and do stuff, and teaching sessions are done even at stratops.
---
Oh! Than you :)
---
CHRIST thats alot of money
---
My current Deimos fit uses 2 electron and 3 ion blasters. Can’t fit a full rack of ions but I need every spare point of dps I can get so I won’t downgrade to all electrons.
---
Doesn’t really make a difference as the range I fight in is close enough that I can lean out of the ship and punch the enemy so it works for me.
---
You make more money overall running L4 Combat missions in a 0.5 system than you do in a single VNI ratting in 0.0, especially with alpha skills. Plus its more engaging and less likely to cause someone to leave
---
My question is this, is it worth getting it as a f2p?
---
Yes.
---
 Does being f2p limit what you can do in the game?
---
 Like does it have massively pay to win aspects where people who spend hundreds of dollars have a distinct and undeniable advantage?
---
Sort of...People who pay for their subscriptions through irl money or plex do get access to all ships in the game, which f2p do not. The bottleneck to everything in EVE is your skill points, which slowly accrue over time. There is a hard cap of 5mil SP to f2p players, which is how CCP prevents f2p players from accessing all the ships. If you have an "omega" account (paid subscription, not f2p) You can pay irl money to buy in game currency (PLEX, which are also an alternative way of paying for a subscription) to buy more skill points (Called skill injectors) to get to be able to fly ships that would otherwise take you a long time to fly. All that said, most people who inject their SP to get into ships are shit pilots who have no fucking clue what they're doing and will get utterly annihilated by a competent pilot. 
---
So yeah, you can pay a few grand to fly a titan after playing the game for 1 hour. You'll also probably only get to fly a titan for a few hours before it dies in a fire too.
---
You're right. If you're a line member pushing the shoot button when FC tells you its probably the most braindead type of pvp that you'll find in any MMO. Try solo pvp in FW space or in NS with a kitey ship. It's extremely rewarding and outsmarting your enemies actually matters a lot. Personally I made an alt to try out FW and lost 20 ships for every kill I got but I didnt get discouraged. My kill/death ratio now is about 45%. The more you  pvp the more you will realise that it's extremely unique and rewarding.

No because his only choices will be to either become an FC, which is very hard for a new player, or to be a braindead line member
---
oh okay, when i googled it all i got was the gun 
---
\&gt;Does being f2p limit what you can do in the game?
---
It's effectively an unlimited trial mode. It allows you to do quite a bit more than the old 30-day free trial, to be fair, but Alpha mode is really about two things:
---
1) Allowing old players to log in and try and reconnect with their old buddies (this is super important to CCP, as EVE is *all* about player interaction and relationships, and enticing old players back in is a major source of 'new' revenue for them)
---
2) Allowing new players to log in and get a taste of the sheer breadth of the game. It was widely recognised that the old 21/30 day limits weren't really enough to let people explore.
---
\&gt;Like does it have massively pay to win aspects where people who spend  hundreds of dollars have a distinct and undeniable advantage?
---
There's no *traditional* "pay-to-win" in the sense that spending more money won't get you anything than a player who just subscribes and plays can't get. All you can buy is game time (PLEX) and skins. Those can be traded freely with other players for in-game currency (so once you're rich in game you can play for free if you want), so although they can't get anything special, they can sure get *more*. However, it's worth remembering that you can only fly one ship at once, and EVE is 99% about group activity. Jimmy Fatwallet can blow $500 on fitting out an all-purple Tech3 Cruiser if that makes him happy, but if he runs into you and a dozen of your corp mates out on patrol in ordinary-fitted ships, he's gonna have a bad time (and if the Loot Fairy is good to you, you'll have a very good day indeed).
---
In short, yes you can pay for advantage, and you can pay to avoid making money in-game, but there's a pretty strong limit to the level of advantage you can buy. Longstanding EVE players rarely object to wallet-warriors, viewing them more as delightful loot-pinatas who also kep PLEX prices down.

At 2 MB/s that png takes over a second to load (kind of low speed but possible, especially if downloading something else simultaneously). Why the fuck should I wait a second when it could load almost instantly as a jpg.

Why not do both? One alpha solo lowsec and one big null cog. Best of both free world's?

Nope, I bought 2 @ £19.99 from Amazon a year ago
---
I did use it, when I last played eve it was called ISK farming, things have moved on, thus I didn't find what I wanted when I did a search ;)  But thanks for the reminder.
---
you are saying that in a reddit where people want catears for ingame characters 
---
I know I wasn't, after shooting five athanors last week with no response.
---
Some alliances dont like you splitting like that, although if you dont tell em then they wont know. I'd still say do some EUni first, check out all of their campuses, "graduate", and then decode what you wana do. It exposes people to more of EVE than just megabloc gameplay, which is better off for the game as a whole.
---
Not to mention all the high sec structures that have been destroyed, disrupting business. 
---
This happened to me a few years ago - I had to file a stuck petition. Something had bugged out with my inventory server side.

Eve is not p2w, people who spend hundreds of dollars buying the most expensive modules and ships still get beaten in combat because the other guy had better piloting skills or tactics combined with knowledge of game mechanics. Or sometimes, it's simply because he brought more friends to the fight.

Tonight I was roaming in GOTG space. I was camped in, but met some pretty cool dudes shooting the shit with them in Local. I wouldn't have gotten to know them if there wasn't some sort of 'location-aware' chat.

mad goon krabs be mad. no surprise.
---
I would love no local, fool.
---
They already have paid
---
Now that's a meme I've not seen in a long time.
---
- For communicating with residents.
---
- For spontaneous social interaction.
---
- For finding new friends.
---
- For not feeling like the game's dead.
---
lol go to wormhole space
---
I'd rather that local showed two figures. How many people are docked and how many are undocked
---
If they want to talk to you they still can.  
---
The game would be more active if local wasn't around for perfect intel.
---
You ask a controversial question, provide one sided answer, and then want others to service your need to attention.
---
We have no obligation to change your mind.
---
You have no authority to demand it.
---
Then why do you participate in some low IQ sheep response? Support this move. Push for it. You got like 8 goon/imperium CSM members. Go bitch at them about it.
---
no, I don't play the game anymore, so I have to rely on Google Images to make these. although I did have to make a new account to get the lowsec warning and I also used it to get backgrounds
---
why are you such a bellend?
---
If killing command dessies is proving to be too tough then you can use a bunch of hyenas to warp in on ravens just as they are about to boosh. Catch a few and they will fall off the boosh range. You can bag a few ravens every boosh, significantly hurting the dps.
---
xd
---
I presented an opinion. You can share yours too or you can just not post. It's not hard.

I think bill is winning eve 
---
You need to mine  more spod..

To randomly see someone old from the past in local. Because without the watchlist this wouldnt happen again. Unless you see him on a gate/station.
---
Seeing wartargets in highsec, but then this could also be added maybe via a icon. 
---
Yeah, delete local, i am fine with that :D
---
I believe this conversation started with you being a prick to me no? Did I come up to you and tell you to shut up?
---
wow now your being a real cunt
---
It's a sandbox so if it's boring then it's just you not playing something fun. Find something that you enjoy.
---
It's not just for grabbing but defense in general. Let's say all you had was a number, and that number spikes, you have to stop whatever you're doing (mining, ratting, ACTUAL small fleet PVP) and go investigate whether it's your guys moving their mining fleet to another moon or if it's a neut  super fleet coming through. So now you're disrupted to figure out who it is, and possibly get caught in the process.
---
Well unless you're Goons, Test, or someone else with a HUGE response fleet, you're fucked. So yeah, local helps little guys, which we need a lot more of. 
---
You tell me to shut up, call me names, wonder why I'm not nice back. Genius.
---
mad goonie? 
---
triggered
---
You seem really angry about this.
---
A ratting fit VNI can kill just about any T1 frigate that comes it's way if it's paying the least bit attention, and with the right drones can force off most if not all assault frigates / faction frigates as well. 
---
Who is this "little guy" you are talking about? Tell me who this brave soul is out there mining by himself and keeping himself alive by the feature of local.

"lol u maaaad"

okay
---
Not really since its incorrect, forign policy is also twisted with dv/tikle/watchmen having legacy allies set neutral
---
No Local will:
---
Make Hunters Op, unlike wh they can always get support instantly to there Location
---
Make subcap ratters either invalid or force people to habe even more alts
---
Buff to Megacoalitions, nerf to everyone else
---
Lol, you publicly declared where to find to find a ratting Rev to kill. I bet they have a camp setup inside your wormhole already.
---
Reason why we should keep local
---
because seraph sed we shouldnt
---
Defenders have their own gates, citadels in every system, jump bridge network, home number's advantage. But this ONE thing will make hunters Op?
---
Me and my group are one. 10 guys in null fighting to own a single system. And if you really cared, I'd name a couple more I've come across doing the same.
---
Lel no, being shoe horned into being a spod brain or f1 fleet monkey is nowhere near the best eve has to offer.
---
F1 monkeys are as sentient as your average npc corp member and both equally perplexed when not being spoon fed content.

got me

xD

---
You need time to from, gates mean shit if you can easily delay them with a sabre or two. No subcap will live long against a hunting gang. Attackers have the advantage of being formed already and on grid. This only translated to fly something with a cracy tank or dont bother as your dead anyway
---
HICs have 2 scripts they can run, basically the same principle you have with scrambler/disruptor - bigger radius of the hic bubble but only works as a point, smaller radius but also shuts down MJDs and MWDs.
---
Hi
---
Indiscret question
---
As we have to use are Eve credentiels to use it, is our account or rather our ISK safe ?
---
Thanks
---
This one cracked me up
---
Easy peazy, heres the learning moment when the pedo gets eaten by the lion for both him and other criminals:
---
If you're a common street thug and you shot another common street thug, we put you in a quick execution scenario, you know, the kind you soft asses think is humane (its not, none of them are, but you go on thinking they're kinder in some way), however if you're a pedo, we put you literally in a lions pen covered in Heinz and leave you over night.
---
Now, if you're a pedo, you're like, man, if i had just murdered somebody, i wouldn't have a lion eating my spleen right now, however, since i fucked a kid, this is going to take a while.
---
At the same time, any common criminal that see's it (we should put these on TV, like the super bowl or a baseball game) and he's like man, I never wana get eaten by a lion.
---
I'm willing to bet if the punishment is slow death by large cat, or some other really long painful death, you'll find a lot more kid rapists who can control their urges.
---
Because every secstatus is balanced around having intel, and some modules/ships (cloak, SB's) too.   
---
Think about them, come up with solutions to them as well, then you can change local. Without changing them =&gt; annihilate your playerbase. 
---
***Ammatar Wants to know your location***
---
Imagine being this asshurt about me.
---
And who is your group?
---
And what subcaps are dying so badly?
---
Image if you could be a decent human being and actually engage with other people in the the real world.
---
Absolute nonsense. For one it would totally negate AFK Cloaking.
---
Rattles, marauders, T3Cs, vnis whatever is used to make money at this time that aint a capital. All would be invalidated as risk/reward would be absolutely skewed towards risk
---
How will they know you are there to talk if you are not showing up in local?
---
This coming from the guy who opened up the discussion with "shut up." Kind of ironic for you to lecture others on being decent.
---
1) cynos
---
I'd even be happy with the compromise of not showing up in local until you break gate cloak. That would go a along way.
---
You are upset over that? Interesting.
---
Not upset about it. Just pointing out you can't lecture others on wiping their ass when you constantly shit on yourself.
---
Well at least il get a good fight out of it
---
You are upset over this? Interesting. If i am so wrong, why are half of the replys pointing out the same thing dude, about how you've come here to service your need for attention. 
---
Hows about then we do the decent thing and deescalate this little reddit popcorn party? :P
---
it's a comic, you read it from left to right (sorry, weebs).
---
honestly tho, I probably put in too many inside jokes.
---
the story is:
---
- a pubbie lives in highsec, happily mining away veldspar, doing some blobbing with NPSI groups, hoping to one day to join the elite Goon corporation Ascendance
---
- one day she starts watching solo PvP videos and hopes to become the next Chessur. she looks into joining a wormhole corp and starts planning a terror campaign on Delve.
---
- she makes her first jump into lowsec only for her first solo PvP experience to be getting dropped by snuffed out supers. she's very upset about this, as she thought she could avoid taking any damage by double clicking in space a lot (just like Chessur). she comes to Reddit to make yet another capital balance post and applies to TEST to join progodlegend's personal Reddit crusade to fix the things broken in the game (but only the things that affect him and his alliance).
---
Never been a better time to start!
---
Most people in Eve are krabs at this point. Deleting or modifying local threatens their "play style."  
---
Hard to take you seriously about de-escalating things while at the same time you attempt to do this lame concern trolling "haha u r upset? interesting" nonsense. Just talk like a human being.
---
What a fuckin nerd 
---
T1 ammo has decent margins, but the market cap is incredibly low (if you sell 100% of all the T1 ammo moving through Jita, you will still be making like 100M ISK a day, or thereabouts). Making rigs is definitely one of the better choices, especially if you manage to grab amazing component deals in mission hubs. The volume is small, so you can move the components in fast ships too, which are less likely to get ganked.

ahh serph you are really not worth the reply. gl dude.
---
&gt;Why the fuck should I wait a second

---
They'll post in local "hi" and then you can msg them. If they want to have a spontaneous social interaction they can post in local.
---
How do subcaps make money in wormhole space without local?
---
2) rorqs
---
Cheeeeezaarrr cheeeeeesssaaaarr.
---
So tell me to shut up. call me names. "lol r u upset" and concern troll. Leave when called out for it.  
---
:ok_hand:
---
Leave it  for highsec sure. Dunno if finding randos in local is really offsetting the downsides.

3) cloaking
---
You should send less time doing that, it will send you bald.
---
I would recommend having your own counter-gank ready. If these people see a rev in that wormhole in the next few days, they will definitely take the bait.
---
You can make a lotnof money but don't think it's easier or less time consiming than ratting.
---
You have to make calculations, predictions, researches and if you choose to do it the less risky and faster way, you need to play the 0.01isk game with lots of other traders, lots of which are using bots.
---
Can be very frustrating and time consuming.

Rolling Holes. Not being actively hunted as whs cant say im gonna visit dude X. If you know people live in an area and you can always access it it is way easier to find and kill said rattle. And unlike in a wh dscan is less effective in kspace for the simple fact that there are more dudes in null as was the intention from the start. Taking wh live as justification that it would work in kspace is desillusional as the ruleset people play at is way diffrent. Meaning you need a diffrent solution. 
---
4) to share popcorn posts like this one
---
You're living proof that spending enough time around dumb people like DBRB can give one the false impression of having intelligent things to say.
---
I don't hang around with DBRB.
---
Is your mean that when you use this app, your character Info and ISK is safe?
---
Of course.
---
Implying joining a nullsec corp means you have to join fleets? You can easily just use the resources at hand to do whatever the fuck you want to do.
---
People can roll holes to find you. And it's not like WH people are constantly rolling their entrances non stop. It's not hard to sneak people in. Point is local not existing doesn't stop people from making money in subcaps.
---
My mistake. I guess you're delusional about the intelligence of what you have to say all on your own.
---
and i guess your still a bellend.
---
Timer immunity.
---
You can't be hostile from the start and then whine when you get btfo'd
---
You actually started the hostility's dude, not me. All i asked what for you to be quite :P
---
"shut up" isn't asking people to be quite anymore than "go fuck yourself" is wishing someone luck in romance.
---
People can roll yes, but 1 that is random luck and 2 you get a warning by a new sig appearing. Sneaking people in ofc is possible but they cant summon reinforcments via cyno willy nilly.
---
You missed my point as I sad wh play by a completely diffrent ruleset than 0.0. In 0.0 it is a given that system x is always reachable
---
So, someone says hi, you don't know who. I am not sure, how long does a conversation last with someone you know absolutely nothing about and you are not even sure that it's the same person.
---
That's not really an argument. "different rule set." Point is sub caps don't suddenly cease being useful without local.
---
Hey man, i'm sorry is the second response on your reddit thread was shut up seraph.
---
VNI uses heavy drones. These are great against battleships, not so much against the small shit in 3/10 and 4/10s.
---
Gila is much better there, definitively worth the extra money. Use autotargeting missiles if you are too lazy to lock each rat before oneshotting it. You just plow through the rooms - when you reach the next gate, almost all rats are dead already. You don't need a lot of extra skills - Caldari cruiser 3 is enough for HS sites, training medium drones is actually cheaper than heavy drones for the VNI. Good missile skills are nice, but not necessary.
---
Btw, if you farm Refuges in Angels space, you'll get 5/10 escalations.
---
List good reasons why Seraph shouldn't biomass himself (Spoiler: You can't)
---
np man I forgive you. I wish you luck in romance.
---
obvious troll is obvious
---
No their name would pop up. Like in WH space.
---
Here's the thing though, it takes time to prep. This is a game, not really real life where its our day job to be prep'd for an attack.
---
Citadels don't service beyond a 1000 km radius, the system on the other hand is infinite.
---
Jump bridge network also has a range within which you must be in order to jump.
---
The biggest advantage that hunters have is the very fact that the area of space in which someone is mining or ratting is not covered by citadel grid, and the fact that the enemies cannot instantly relocate within seconds as it takes time to prep, warp and jump.
---
Local throws away the only self-reliant cautionary tool (apart from intel channels but those become void too without local) that a player has to save him or herself.
---
I'd be fine with it if they buffed null income to wormhole levels and made it so we could turn off gates.
---
Now are you actually gonna have a discussion with people replying or just continue to throw standard serph replys like "Absolute nonsense." after asking for people for discussion.
---
Go write another shitty BR nobody reads nerd. Or some more elf fanfics lmao
---
Nope. It's serious. Fight local with me.
---
I mean....rorq mining tho
---
Listen, if I can't apply to something properly in my dread it's broken and needs nerfed.  None of this "try another ship" malarky, please.
---
Anyone remember squad chat? That was my jam on my RKK spy.
---
Depends if they're as big of a dickhead as you.
---
I'd rather be a dickhead then a well known bellend that no one likes. :thumbsup:
---
who?
---
Yeah, il bring in some pvp refit just in case
---
It kinda is tho. You are willfully ignoring my point. If youd argue that a delay of some sort would be helpful i could understand that. As it increases risk but still gives targets a chance. 
---
Accessability to space does warrant a diffrent approach to local. Carbon copy is not a solution. Due to the diffrences I have listed above.  
---
Wormholes are less safe is exactly why it's considered easier to bag kills in wormholes. The reason why, in raw numbers, the deaths of ratting ships are less in wormholes than in null because the number of players living or hunting in wormholes is just as low due to:
---
1. lack of local
---
2. lack of direction or route, you have to scan wormholes in chain to get to a part of the galaxy, its not as direct and reliant as you like
---
3. scanning havoc that ensues for chaining
---
4. it feels empty, lack of market and other such functions without a full player group
---
5. even rolling can be hectic sometimes, you can get tired of it unless, again, you have many friends and you know what you're doing
---
Due to this nature of wormhole, it is why they are so rewarding, and it is also why people are okay with using dreads as they know people moving through are less, and that the ISK they will make in that much time will be good.
---
Wormholes, in their own respect, are a completely different form of playstyle.
---
lmao in case ur not trolling here's why. Removing local instantly kill nullsec altogether. Everything in nullsec is enabled by bears. sov, citidels, empire building, production, every fucking thing. without bears, there's no nullsec at all. If u remove local you remove the bears cause who the fuck will undock their rorq/ratting ship without local and intel channels? If ur actually dumb enough to believe deleting local will give you tons of free bear kills idk what to tell you except that the only place ull be getting bear kills anymore will be hisec mission hubs. the only reason anyone lives in null to begin with is cause it's safe. you take that away, it dies.
---
You are literally 1 click away from immunity in every system you krab in, especially Delve. You see someone in local, you align, and the moment they pop on grid you are gone. Almost the only way to lose anything is not looking at the screen.
---
No you are simply just an attention seeking retard, change my mind
---
Why its certainly not the most elite form of pvp there is still alot a player can do in fleet pvp to make a huge difference to a fight.
---
What attention? There's literally zero benefit for me doing this (unless local actually changed.)
---
Do you like have everything spoon fed to you?
---
it's not about AFK cloaking, Cloaky camping is broken AF and the only thing that keeps that in Check is the Intel local, which is Broken to the same degree.   
---
Cloaks and Intel are balanced around each other. Remove one part of that and the other becomes ridiculous. 
---
It's not about getting easy kills...it's about always having your every move watched with hundreds of people ready to spring up on you if you provide any kind of actual danger. Do you imagine NCdot and PL and Goons suddenly going to highsec if local were delayed?
---
indeed. I would say that 1 v 1 the t1 would win. Though bring a mate in another t1 ship and make it 2 v 1. You will win and between you still spend less than half of what your opponent did 
---
Nope. You speak as if aligning is instantaneous, here's a hint: it's not.
---
Who considers it easier to bag kills in wormhole space? I think that's an untrue assumption.
---
wound*
---
You seem mighty insecure kiddo
---
It's not a carbon copy. Local would show total number of people in system. Just not who.
---
GJ you are some liked neckbeard on the internet by other loser neckbeards.
---
I've thought sbout this and they do provide a great service to the community, that is quick selling and buying.
---
Withouth them people would need to interrupt their activities in order to spend a lot of time trading, even more so because trading is not their speciality.
---
And your here just for that same reason.

---
There are a few channels where a lot of the large coalitions fleet commanders lerk together irrespective of standings , but I don’t know them 
---
lol you're clueless.
---
Which is a useless number as other people commented. A +1/-1 is as useless as no local atall and that is a bad idear for null for the reasons I did say earlier. You know what? What would be the advantage be in removing local in your eyes? Not only for hunters but also for the general null community. How would it balance out in your eyes? Why are you so for a complete removal and not maybe a delayed version?
---
Sorry it takes 5 seconds. That's my window to kill your krab ship.
---
That's not what he said
---
Cloaks are balanced by the fact cloaky ships are generally squisher than non cloaky counterparts.
---
No?
---
can't upvote enough
---
Because I think this game is too safe for krabs. It's turned this game from the cut throat hunting ground that it once was to some docile farmsvile simulator where krabs are almost completely safe and are given the illusion of military competence because they can anchor on an FC and press F1
---
Okay let's test your theory. Who am I trying to be liked by?
---
alright, but regardless of the motivation, the consequences are the same. in your honest opinion, how do you think the average nullsec line member who rats or mines will respond to his local and intel channels being taken away? do you think they'll try to keep making isk the hard way or go to hek and run soe missions?
---
The harder/riskier something becomes the less of it exists. Take faction modules for example. The less that there are the more valuable they become. It'll balance itself out. The entirety of nullsec is not suddenly going to go run missions in Hek.  
---
Truth of the matter is 0.0 has become soft. The attitude of Eve has changed so much over the past few years. The developers continue to cater to the farmsville krab herbivor population rather than the carnivore hunters.
---
Why not just provide boosts and let players earn their money themselves? Offer a buyback at lets say jita buy if they don't want to deal with transporting and selling the ore themselves.
---
Ex player : 10 years I played for. Had to stop because my involvement was requiring stupid amounts of commitment. 
---
Too safe for CAPITAL Crabs maybe. But subcaps made for ratting are still vulnerable as they were years ago. You catch em and they mostly die. There only counterplay is to have local, otherwise its a no chance situation for them. As cutthroat of a game eve is it has to be balanced for every participant, not only hunters. Then what is there to hunt if pve is not worth it anymore. 
---
And bringing blobs into a local discussion makes no sense. As this will just result in more people joining the Blobs as it will be the only way to have any safety. As some else said there 10 man group would be complete screwed. They cant use subcaps as they wpuld just get murdered, they cant use caps as they have no way to save them if they cant see local and have a chance to escape.
---
And if you say they dont deserve space you just increase the power of blobs even more. 
---
Removing local will mske hunters and targets sad alike. Noone to hunt besides rorqs and capitals? Gl with your 10 man cruiser gang. Delaying local on the other hand so you can say Instant Local in High/Low, Delayed Local in Null and no Local in wh that would be a balance id support
---
Remove cap capable krab sites then. Increase the importance of subcap krabbing. Or nerf capitals enough that they are more viable as targets.
---
Which intales alot more balance then just hurr durr remove local. 
---
You cant just do one and ignore everything else what you and most other guys seem to think. A whole rebalance of about every null aspect would be in order
---
Question:  
---
Why do we still have perfect intel from local?  
---
Thank you.
---
inb4 commissar'd for not referring to it as the "Casino War"
---
Tbh what would happen is that no longer would subcaps krab solo. They'd do it as groups to protect themselves. Well well well what do we have here? a Small gang of VNIs fighting another small gang of roamers. Looks like content with me. I'm good with this. Aren't you?
---
no, they won't all go to hek. some will go to wormholes, some will quit the game, some will run fw missions, whatever. 0.0 has become soft cause it's profitable for ccp. empire building, rorqual alts, titan alts, fax alts, any sort of extra account to 1 up the other big null blob means more subs and plenty more extractors sold cause waiting to train skills in 2019 lul. your 3 dork nano gang means jack shit compared to the goon with 30 hulks whether you like it or not. safety means profit for pearl abyss and because of that things are never going to go the other way. quit the game about it, idk what to tell you.

this is what happens when you join a credit card alliance mate

F2P is viable for PVP, limited for most everything else. The pay2win in this game is just subbing, you *can* in theory spend (literally) thousands on a tournament prize ships with absurd bonuses but they'll last until you die and end up feeling utterly stupid. It's just not a thing cause nothing short of a lottery win could cover it.
---
EVE lotteries. So like in a casino?
---
Lmao you don't even understand our own NIP. Your the reason our alliance will never grow Sgeine, time is numbered 
---
Personally like my Justice HFI
---
Good one. I wonder when the last time they were used, as used but not by accident.
---
Glass cannons are balanced by having extreme DPS (which bombers very much do). Not by having extreme DPS + a device that makes them immune to everything for as long as you need it. 
---
In short Yes eve is great for f2p, you can spend years getting used to gameplay however and its a big one when you want more and bigger fights you will out grow an Alpha account, and you will start new ones to grow your armada most eve players have multiple omega accounts and multiple alphas to be specific to different areas
---
also remove sub 2 second align and nullification
---
Remote DD for the win? ;-)
---
Throwing shade over RMT when you and your exec are literally some of the biggest culprits? Interesting hypocrisy there. 
---
Super ratting, maybe some rorq mining, rig construction, alliance logistics. 
---
I play a lot but half of my time is usually pvp. I tend to dual box pvp and then have 7 other accounts doing various other activities. 
---
A bunch of pve ships vs pvp ships will end in only 1 was unless the pvp ships are idiots. 
---
Noone in there right mind will use a pve ship to fight players so what you dream up wont likely happen. 
---
Also group pve outside of incursions and abyss is absolutely worthless. So again before or with local removal alot of balance changes have to be implemented.
---
Just removing local is still a bad idear
---
If you asked this question like a year or two ago, the answer would be inconclusive. But they did expand alpha clone (f2p) options quite a bit. You can easily start the game and get the feel for it and try lots of stuff. The only real downside is omega clones (payed accounts) train skills twice the speed compared to alpha clones.
---
&gt;	One great method of “making” ISK is needing less. Most ships in Null are fitted much cheaper than the typical blingy wormholer fittings.
---
Gotta lovr that wallet tank.
---
I don't know wormholer btw
---
I try to put money to work, cycling research and basic T1 manufacturing; not a gold mine at all, but its honest cash.  Can’t stand PI.
---
I used to rat, but I live in some very hot systems, so I do it less.  Supplement it all with some moon/anom mining and a pinch of cheapskate.
---
How dare he.
---
If you find 500 mil while exploring and lose that, you haven't actually lost 500mil from your net worth, you've only lost the potential for 500 mil. If you buy a 500mil ship and lose it, then you have lost 500mil from your net worth and may not be able to replace it. Rule 1 boils down to not pouring all of your liquid isk into a ship where losing it would mean you start from scratch. For example if a highsec missioner buys a new ship with all of his isk, and loses that ship, he would not be able to afford any other ship and is back at square one for isk making. There's also the case where you are transporting in your cargo your most valuable possessions, rule 1 applies to that because that is your stuff and you may not be able to afford to lose that. But when you find stuff whilst exploring, it isn't yours until you've docked, so rule 1 doesn't really  apply since you can afford to lose it because it would be no different that not having found it in the first place.

So that i know somebody else other than my corpies are actually playing this game

**Some solid prof now please** if they botting i want them banned from game.         
---
So please prove it.          
---
No, it is not. The game is still pay to win. In essence the modules that would make you competitive are locked and only Plex can get you to a stage where you can actually hold your own. 
---
On behalf of Test Alliance Please Ignore I confirm that all this is 100% true.
---
As much as I would think it is true some documented proof is needed. And not just the old case
---
\&gt;tfw no gf
---
No not quite. You simply prove that you're not a bot at their site by signibg in trough EVE sso and after verifying (No info is sent over) you're registered for that 2 week part lottery.
---
No ISK is sent their way, so they are perfectly legit. Just a "Hey if anyone wants to win some isk, just say so"
---
They have actually done some co-operation with CCP. They got some T2 BPO's to give away in a lottety during the last decade.
---
So join them to basically give them your taxs then get kicked for not getting them paps
---
Any proof especially for the „points of interest“?Your case and maybe interest of CCP would be stronger if you provide it. To CCP directly and not via reddit..
---
'Locates Are Us' is a little known but useful one.
---
&gt;\- Bots are to be hidden in Fraternity Treasury [http://evewho.com/alli/Fraternity.%20Treasury/](http://evewho.com/alli/Fraternity.%20Treasury/) (Any bots caught under main alliance will be commisared, and is bad for press).
---
So you are trying to say that to hide them they made an alliance with the same name? you retarded?
---
Next time you shitpost, at least put some proof to your shitposting

Hey why is the Low Sec pic showing Lawn and Bastion Home systems?!? We are not low sec there at all!    \*Launches Excavators\*

Best reason to not remove local - so we can continue to see the endless stream of posts calling for the removal of local. The salt must flow.
---
we're actually being paid by progodlegend to train legacy into being a capable pvp force
---
&gt;Do you guys think it's possible to reach 1 billion ISK in 30 days starting from scratch as an alpha account 
---
Yes just send me 250m isk and I QUADRUPLE it for you!
---
I like that idea, CCPls

I'd rather just have a job and pay for the subs then lol

Random idiot tries to form a narrative on r/eve to support ingame politics without interest from the community.
---
ftfy.
---
highsec makes sense, because concord owns the gates, tracks everyone using them and gives the information to everyone... maybe people with -5 and below lose the ability to see local... also maybe link local even more to gates, so if you enter through a wormhole, you dont get tracked, till you use a stargate or dock in a station...
---
but i guess it wouldnt work at all, if we look at the mess that local always created, including lag and shit or bugging out completly... would be a real headache to even get that to work
---
Agreeing with a StainGuy post, what a day to be alive. 
---
He probably saw which spawn you were at, so he knew there was no chance for an esclatation anymore for that particular site.
---
Usually those are kind of highsec anom speed runners. They are hunting DED escalations in either Cerbs, Gilas or Ishtars, sometimes also Cynabals.
---
What do you mean by RMT here?  Buying ISK/plex with real money or selling ISK for real money?  Are you saying that he buys plex with real money or that he sells ISK to get cash?  Please try to be more specific and provide proof.
---
Haha. Love this br.
---
i am a wormholer too with 2 characters in different wormholes without corps :D living the real wormhole life yeeea... wormholes are best to afk
---
Abyssal Trading
---
\&gt;  (Multiple entities rejected this offer due to dirty isk but Capqu (Skill urself) took most recent contract).
---
And to add to this, skill urself already RMT'd the contract payment and since skill urself is a communist alliance, it all got shared among the membership. Some got new cars IRL, some just got paid in cold hard cash and one even got a new house. Remember that PL took merc contracts for years in the past. Who knows how many yachts they have by now.
---
&gt;What on earth makes you dumb enough to believe I went to prison for assaulting a cop with a bat? You just sitting back making up random shit now?

Are you okay Grath? do you need us to call someone?
---
How much money did you get and what did you use it on?
---
Some things are better left unknown.
---
Agreed, although curiousity..... 
---
That's an incredible stretch of the definition of pay to win, which is usually restricted to microtransactions rather than regular subscription model (which was the only way to play EVE for ever a decade by the way).
---
By that definition you can only play the game if you pay your electric bill. Guess that's pay to win in practice too.
---
would that be because the map is flattening the z-plane? or just not have the correct gates and routes?
---
It shows the next timer, yes. But maybe you don't want to kill the shield, just to find out that the armour timer is not in your TZ? Then use a hacking module to learn the current settings first.
---
sometimes reading comments like that makes me want to leave nc :(

I didn't even knew people were running frigate abyssal sites with logi.  I doubt you will have enough DPS doing so.

how else am i gonna make payments on my Adidas track suit dude
---
Rorq mining in iteslf is shit for profits with a single rorq. Like 100 to maybe 200m an hour. Thats shit compared to most anything. A damn carrier can get more. Its the multyboxability of them. And that wont be hindered by no local :)
---
Bullshit, you are probably being paid by not only frat but also goons to weaken test allies so they will have to depend on goons more and more nefor goons get them to become just one of there pets
---
I didn't get anything. A friend in skill urself got a few thousand dollars.

wow spicy.

yeh wild accusations with no proof is why CCP have not taken any action.

I joined Wingspan because I love roaming around in Cloaky Ships in Wormholes &amp; normal space.
---
There is no real HQ so you don't have to be stationed near anywhere. You can base yourself where you want.
---
There are no mandatory operations so you don't have to be on at a certain time for any specific tasks.
---
As for your first point I have 2 accounts which is invaluable to me. My main is mostly lost in some wormhole chain and my alt is in an NPC Corp doing things like trading &amp; PI to make Isk. I don't make huge amounts, but enough to cover my Main account's ship losses.
---
It's a huge deal that I don't have to take my main account away from it's activities to go and make Isk. My alt is an Omega account too so I have full usage, but I only log on to my alt briefly to check on the Isk. Maybe 15-25 mins per day MAX. I guess you could have an Alpha alt to perform passive Isk making such as trading just so your main doesn't have to do this. I am always looking for the laziest ways to make Isk with my alt.
---
There may be many other Corps out there like Wingpsan which allow you to be a casual player. Wingspan focuses on Cloaky ships &amp; wormhole shenanigans.
---
Ganking Gilas in anoms is fun!
---
If this no longer exists... Someone needs to make it exist.
---
Is there a sub for finding a Corp?
---
Just now getting back into the game and would love to learn how to pvp. 
---
How do they do that if there is no local? Your argument is falling apart at the seams.
---
They rejigged the NPE about September, and it became available to all, even if you'd completed the old one. The career missions not so much, but you can still do the wee walkthrough of targeting, finding optimal range, etc. on your old character (plus if you've already trained the skills each step rewards, it'll give you unallocated SP to the same value, which is no bad thing).
---
You can easily play as f2p. Very large percentage of this community plays this way.
---
But, i must answer your question honestly:
---
&gt;does it have massively pay to win aspects where people who spend hundreds of dollars have a distinct and undeniable advantage?
---
It has. Don't listen when anyone tells you that EVE is not pay to win.
---
HOWEVER, due to how complicated the game is, if a noob just pours $1000 into the game to get the best equipment possible without understanding how the game works - those $1000 will go down the drain.
---
So, EVE is kinda pay to win if you know what you are doing. The main "problem" for people who try to go pay to win is that they are very likely to be just suicide-ganked for loot.
---
To be honest, in WH space, the ships have to be bling because the fights are smaller.
---
In normal space, you can just throw more people at a problem until it's no longer a problem.
---
This seems to provide statistics broken down by year. You would have to do the math.

problem is that too many fucking snowflakes have an opinion on the internet now and it is why they have to or be compelled to say how horrified they are..

It is just a shame we live in a world where this kinda crap has to take place. Next his schools and college he went to will also say how horrified they are and then his family will be forced to spout out. Perhaps his Doctor from when he was 4 - 8 years old will also be required to make a statement..

Just look at [He Ku](https://zkillboard.com/kill/74152679/). Know'n rmt botter that is still not banned and even got awoxed by fraternity in an embarrassing attempt to show they are "anti-boting". [Nine nine machine](https://pastebin.com/AzcZAXcg) talking about he ku leaving Sky's chinese rmt botting farm and him being burned or banned since last year? I still don't get all these lazy people who ask for proof but if they actually took 5 min to look at their own blue renters they would have a lot more proof than any person who's trying to bring all this rmt botting bullshit to light for the community to see. Bringing legit proof publicly hurts any CCP investigation in to the matter. So I suggest not feeding the karma whoring reddit warriors by killing an advantage CCP can get from in-game logs. 
---
Another bad thing about CCP policy is that players don't get any proof that measures were taken. The ultimate result the community gets is the character/s in question being inactive. Sharing one of nine nine machine's chat logs now seems to be irrelevant since the character seems to be inactive/burned and maybe banned. 
---
‘Learn to solo?’ Lol. Do you realize how much there is to learn? The support structure new player corps offer is huge in getting new people into the game quickly. Hell just the other day I was showing a newbro (as in like a week old player) the ropes and ended up in a 2 hour lecture on ship fitting, menu usage, isk making and a few other topics. We barely scratched what I wanted to teach him. 
---
While it is possible to learn EVE solo I’d highly discourage it due to how much there is to learn and how opaque some of it can be. 
---
Atleast they wont take my.hands.
---
He was banned months ago after letting slip he buys ISK with RL $$'s. So i'm guessing that's what OP refers to.
---
Nice one Haha
---
Spod bless
---
I think you massively overestimate how 'hardcore' you have to be to be an FC. I don't know what alliance you're in but a lot of groups have training comps which are designed to be taken out by newbie FCs, so that you can learn how to run fleets without the fear of getting an expensive fleet welped.
---
Pretty much any competent group in Eve will do anything they can to bring through more FCs, even casual FCs who just take out Thrasher roams provide content to the members that they wouldn't otherwise have.
---
Well go for the jackdaws. a-type small shield rep fit, usually up to 500M per piece in total. Fitted for TH/KIN.
---

---
They are also nice!
---
Get over it WH Pleb. The Keepstar is gone 
---
Thats true ... couldn't agree more :)
---
Dude, I'm literally in Init, that's not flair bait.
---
Hahaha I knew someone would say it 
---
But isn't he also accused of botting to sell ISK? Or is that on linemember level?
---
I insta left that channel when they told me to keep it pg.
---
Whilst this might be true in Delve/Esoteria, this is more because blops pilots don't want to have supers dropped on them than because blops themselves aren't good. If you head out to NPC null or nullsec without umbrella, dropping the blops themselves is quite common and effective.
---
Forums are probably the best way besides word of mouth. Eve jobs usually is just the same handful of corps spamming their ads over and over. 
---
If this community wasn't playing EVE 24/7, I'm fairly confident we'd have a Mars base by now.
---
So you're saying it's really easy to learn the basics as a new player in a large alliance.
---
just ignore goon posters tbh
---
Boo the naysayer!
---
For real though, as a fresh account you can do quite a bit if you find a good group. Without that then it’s still fun to fart around in New Eden for free (but the upgrade is worth it if you enjoy it).
---
shut the fuck up
---
Dude you have to be able to laugh at yourself sometimes. It's just a game. 
---
&gt; No ISK is sent their way, so they are perfectly legit.
---
Pretty sure that doesn't matter.  It's obviously more benign than the old casinos, but it doesn't sound like it passes EULA muster.
---
&gt;You may not use, transfer or assign any game assets for games of chance operated by third parties.
---
What could possibly go wrong...?!
---
Oh, and that tengu was nullified as well... mistakes were made.
---
We talked about the fit, and then you went "bbbut they went to nullsec and gatecamped in delve after a while"
---
Remember though that you only have so many sites and it's a lot of work. You can't chain farm anoms, they respawn very slowly. You might only get 10-15 sites per week. It's good isk but unreliable.
---
The carrier needs more attention.  Give me a Rorq any day.
---
i too can pull up an entire days losses for an alliance to ratting. It’s almost as if eve has a PVE aspect too and people die, whodathunkit

Hi. Don't talk on behalf of someone you don't represent. Kkthxbye
---
Profs, like truly i want them banned, but simply something we can use and go with it to CCP.              
---
How long we know that KWG or XXD or 90% of the drone area was used for RMT? (and also botting).            
---
We don't have profs as people do this safely at this level and nothing is done ingame thus no evidence CCP have.              
---
There are many ways you can do this safely.       
---
If you look at the ebay - you will find people that 'sell EVE items' for 20-40k $ per year, for multiple years. 
---
If you manage to read this amongst all these experienced player replies.
---
I’m an older player checking the game out to get a feeling of how things are now. The F2P accessibility is very fair to me, you can do a lot and that’s kind of an understatement.
---
Side note since this thread has a lot of traction;
---
I’m a massive noob still in eve with about 30mil sp. I’m a new parent now though are they’re any corps here that cater to “play when i can” pilots?
---
No, it wouldn't. Even as an alpha, you can easily turn within a single week 1 million into 100/200 million ISK without too much effort. And from there, it only get's easier to get to 1 billion. 
---
The best way to make 1 billion ISK as an alpha is not Industry and Hauling, it's combining Exploration (active activity) with Station Trading (passive activity) and use different alpha characters for each.

List of good reasons why we should keep wormholes (Spoiler: You can't)
---
Sometimes the only way to pay it forward is with overheated VOID ammo launched close to the speed of light into their feeble defenses.
---
Don't get discouraged, sometimes you find the odd jerk or come in at a bad time. Thought that guy is defiantly a jerk for starting the convo like that.
---
He doesn’t have solid proof needed. Why don’t we let ccp do their jobs and stop dumbass witch hunts. 
---
I love how people's argument for getting rid of local boils down to "I want to kill crabs because killing a newbie in a pve ship is great content for me"
---
It does. 
---
its free, you can try plenty of the game on alpha (the name of free account). i have omega friends (name of paid account in game or IRL money) and when theyre short on isk or cash they alpha for a month, they still have fun.
---
eve takes a long time to invest skilling into ships to fly. so being free account for a while to skill up and try the game is great,
---
yes, you can buy skill points to get into ships faster, but theres a level 5 skill level on all skills. so paying to skill up only ever saves time, never does it give you an advantage on fighting or gathering income.
---
having more than one account helps, which costs, but i dont see these two things as pay to win, only pay to get further faster.
---
people have played this game for years, so buying yourself into cool ships doesnt give you an advantage, only helps you catch up on certain skills people spent a few months training up via ingame mechanics.
---
its a good game, but to enjoy you need to be ok with joining others to learn the game with, friends, meet new guys (super easy in eve)
---
reddits always here to help as well as in game chats.
---
everyone knows a group to join or can advise the options pros and cons to joining certain clans/corps as apposed to others.
---
many many players start the game, get confused, come back a year later and then give it a go.. eve is hard to learn at the start (start being the first year)
---
true. 100% true.
---
Must be tiring getting dropped on.
---
Coincidentally a new account begins posting the same shit as the old on the same day with the same naming format and dinolord mcburgerbrain’s first post on his actual account in days is to specifically try and say this isn’t him 
---
Really ez stuff 
---
Again, "I just want to kill Krabs"
---
Never been dropped.
---
not reaching chipotle level
---
Unlike other F2P titles, Eve's F2P mode unfortunately gives you a limited experience. Not so much in the beginning but after a while you will definitely feel handicapted (although not necessarily weaker). 
---
So it's a great game to try out F2P but be aware that a lot of the end game stuff is locked behind subscription walls.
---
i remember thinking that all shield hardeners strengthened m shield, but were best vs a certain type. i did not notice 'EM Ward Field I' only helped vs one damage type. i didnt even realise there were 4 damage types at that stage however.
---
me for one dislike tutorials. and proberly why i liked eve, when i started there was much of one. and i loved it. 
---
why does it even let you fit a 5mn on a cruiser for example? or why is there no warning for newer accounts doing this?
---
does civillian stuff need to exist still?
---
Damn, this is pretty cool :D
---
I am not arguing with a literal pathetic kid like you, like you seem insistant on doing with every player on here who doesn't match your view looking at your post history.

That totally makes sense and isn't any sort of mental gymnastics whatsoever, and I was way off to quote the "don't fly what you can't afford to lose" rule to someone who lost a a large portion of assets while he continued to explore space with said assets in his cargo hold instead of immediately returning to a station.
---
&gt; If you find 500 mil while exploring and lose that, you haven't actually lost 500mil from your net worth, you've only lost the potential for 500 mil.
---
You're one of those "if I mine it myself, it's free" guys too, aren't you?
---
The owning corp gets to set the ACL, so yes. You'll probably get in hot water with your alliance if you do though.

&gt; The entire thing is in game.

After checking into it further, it looks like CCP considers them fine, so, my bad!
---
sick video guyyy
---
Go after the real people in charge. The people who created the renting rmt botting system in the first place. And the ones who continue to profit off of it. 
---
In the end it all comes down to what CCP does. There is no way of telling if anything is being done against alliances who do this. Yes,  a portion of the in-game rmt is part of what the security team at CCP does but the people who are part of the rmt circle are still the ones getting the money in rl. And they will keep doing this until CCP has enough proof to catch most of the rmt circle involved. Just wait and watch how another big headline about EVE Online and RMT is gonna emerge in the near future.

It's ok tho. People like him are the reason this game went to shit. 
---
oh yeah, hey those monkey awox botter but fuck them they still bot sympathizer because they are fucking Chinese and you are simply evil born Chinese!
---
It is not in EULA that you should awox botter in your renters when you find it, we did it in volunteer, and to discourage any botting corp joining our renter program. It's CCP's job to get rid of botting, and we are already doing CCP a big favor without any profit.

Now why don't you be the big man and show you can do something better than us.

Yup.

done. but yeah thats kinda douchey unless u have a super good reason gonna annoy people
---
Hello bby, why you no call me anymore?
---
Just look at the way this guy types. Very disturbed person who thinks he deserves a reward for being a decent human being. A petty awox kill doesn't prove you aren't an alliance funded by bots and rmt and are still doing it. 
---
empty earlier. or learn you win some loose some.
---
eventually youll be the one killing for the 70mil of which some dropped. its each to thier own.
---
you learnt some things here. everyone wants to kill you. live by that. if you can get there they can, and faster
---
You could say the same about solo pilots killing shit way above the usual engagement profile of their ship. 
---
If you are able to bomb-&gt;boosh on top of someone elses fleet your fleet did great while the other fleet fucked up. Should we nerf cloaked bomber squads too because "OMG they uncloaked next to us and bombed or whole fleet." ??

Actually the question was turned the opposite way, I am about to join a renter alliance and I know there is another corp who literally hates me, and well, I don't want to stash stuff in their citadel if it's to get my docking right revoked.

Thanks

As far as the rest of this shit, my tin foil hat foo it too strong for this BS.

I think I had the opposite problem.  I've never tried to use a Kiki at that range, I'd used them mostly in the 10-20 range so I was only packing the T2 ammo's.  Guess it would be good to pack some Meson  if only for the whoring.

But why should a newbie not making all these mistakes and learn from them? In my world this is called "problem solving" and being able to solve a problem is a pretty needed ability. You have the ressources and if you have the ressources you can get creative. Problem is, when you are in a corp they will tell you what works for them and a lot of this is "meta stuff" that by no means works bad but it pretty much gives you tunnel vision. For example there are some less than ideal destroyers, I am looking at you my beloved u-boat hull Corax. This thing is piss poor outside of pretty niche situations but because this is such a common "knowledge" just a few will try to find out a way to exploit this hull in some way. Or take Suitonia ans his Kestrel. Before he went on his Kestrel crusade the Kestrel wasn´t considered a strong ship. Now we have seen you can kill a lot of shit if you´re flying good and pick your fights well.

You were the one who attempted to compare styles of play by stating that kiting Condors are gay, I drew the comparison with gate camping as their kills were made on gates.

It's not all about eft stats!  Always bring twice as much control as you think you need.  Dual prop, dual web, target painter, downgrade those guns and fit a neut, whatever it is.  And especially don't get sucked into the crazy tank ASBs can give you without knowing that they run out in less than a minute.  I wish I had known 8 years ago not to just fit max tank speed and dps.  I'd have a lot more kills by now :)

Have you tried exploration at all? Its probably my favorite thing to do in the game and I'm fairly new myself. Its enjoyable to just travel to as many systems as I can (mainly wormholes and Null Sec) in search of loot from data and relic sites. You get to see a lot of cool things along the way including watching others battle it out while being cloaked up in a pre-made safe spot. If thats something that interest you, check out Signal Cartel! They are a great group of people who mainly do exploration and the only PvP they do is their Hug fleets which they just shoot fireworks off at people.

Antiquated Station Authentication Module.
---
On (Insert in game date here) a long awaited transition to a more secure module used in the authentication of docking of capsuleer spacecraft to stations hit its final switchover, preventing the use of earlier designed tokens.
---
Fortunately Upwell and the Empire manufacturers took part in a massive distribution campaign in the months leading up to this date, automatically distributing the token to stored and docked ships as needed. Along with a rumor of cloaked courier shuttles from the Sisters of Eve it was believed that this transition would "go off without a hitch." Unfortunately a small amount of capsuleers found themselves without this update and had to self destruct and replace the ship they were in at the time of transition.

I said that I don't know if he does that, I've never heard any comment on it, Therefore I am accusing him of nothing. 
---
What I do know is that it goes on with the line-members (But TBH in what entity does it not)

And I know his ban back along was cited to be due to him RMT Buying ISK, Which he admitted was the case in a SOTA that was very publicly shared on reddit, Hell, I remember you being one of the top replies.

If you go the Fw route , your allready on the pathe to pvp , even if you exclusively farm. Learning to dscan/ align ect.

&gt; slippery petes warping to the ravens individually and keeping pressure on the destroyers
---
Petes don't work at all since T3C rework, you can't get enough range without being vulnerable to defensive HIC bubble, lack agility to gtfo is something is trying to catch you, and your effective range is putting you in risk of getting fleet booshed on top of you and you getting tackled and teared apart by whatever support ships are present. With all the current issues petes have now, there's no point of using them over corms which are cheaper, more mobile, have smaller sig and apply better.
---
that was a good transition

The best advice I can give you is the same advice I give to every new player: go join a group. It can be a small corporation or one of the meg-coalitions, but if there is one thing that I have learned from playing this game for a decade and a half (shit, I may have wasted my life) its that this game is infinitely better when played with other like minded people.
---
I'm all for shit posting after the interesting time I spent with you guys but if the guy wants to run an alliance and not run his members reputation into the ground like his own then he needs to start acting like an Exec to do that

---
Me &amp; friends are running frigates with a self-tank and a single remote repper (retris, hawks) for emergencies, works well. Would only recommend a dedicated logi when you take retri dps, the other frigates can't match the dps/range.
---
I should clarify. The idea is to have 10-20 covert, nullified tengus who individually warp to the ravens periodically. You take something like this: https://imgur.com/a/WXibMBF
---
You whenever the fleet is out of range, the Tengu probes it down (takes 0 skills to probe a raven at 0.5 AU), warps at a hundred and starts shooting a destroyer. It will apply 100% of its damage, which means the destroyer is eating over 300 damage per Tengu - not a trivial amount for a Raven fleet to deal with. 
---
As soon as it lands, the Tengu aligns out. Even if it gets shot at by Ravens, the missiles take over 5 seconds to get to it, during which time it can warp out and start over. 
---
The concept definitely has a lot of moving parts, and relies on players to think for themselves instead of anchoring up and shooting primaries, but I strongly believe it would put massive pressure on the Raven fleet, if not outright neutralize it if enough Tengus are used. 
---
Support fleets are definitely an issue if you're not careful, but if you land in range of some of them you can just cloak up and try again. You don't need to worry about the bubble as you're nullified (which is the whole point), you won't really have the Ravens on top of you unless you warp in from directly in front of them, and corms are a completely different concept so the comparison isn't really valid. 
---

Oh cool. So I won't crash out of 10% tidi fights. woo
---
who doesnt though
---
Probably not. I don't know much about the overall state of the economy, but my sense is that isk faucets (bounties are the biggest by far, NPC orders for blue loot and trig survey databases, mission and incursion ISK payouts, insurance, etc) are wildly out of proportion to the sinks, and more of the same kinds of sinks would likely not do the job. 
---
stop
---
cool idea but the name is a bit off, how about **cumstainium**
---
Lets us hope.           
---
It will raise a lot of issues initially but they will be worth it. 
---
Or, put an NPC version of one of those upwell gates in stain, but have the rats destroy it over and over.

No I thoroughly disagree with the "if I mine it myself it's free" because it doesn't take into account opportunity cost. I just think you're misunderstanding rule 1, there's a difference between undocking with something that is too valuable for you to lose and finding stuff during your outing that is a significant chunk to you. In the former you risk putting yourself at risk financially by losing it, in the latter you only lose something that wasn't 'yours' before undocking 
---

You will be taxed regardless if you say in NPC corp.

Also in some alliances, you don't need to attend fleets. I dunno what the rules in TEST are, but for Pandemic Horde, you can be in the alliance without joining a single fleet if you wish.
---
For goons, you need to join like 1 fleet a month I've heard - but take that with a grain of salt.

Are you saying you have to have purple modules and fly the most bling Battleship to ‘hold your own’? There are so many loss mails in zkill that proves this wrong.

Jesus Christ. It's not that hard to understand. [Here. Let me help you visualize it.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Supranational_European_Bodies-en.svg/800px-Supranational_European_Bodies-en.svg.png)

This is a diagram of the organizations inside of the EU. Note that some countries are part of some groups and not parts of others but ALL of them are STILL in the EU. 
---
Now... If say... Nordic Council goes on a fleet without the rest of the EU then they would call it "Nordic Council" Fleet to denote that its just Norway, Sweden, Denmark, etc... Yes... They are all still in the EU, but for purposes of THIS fleet its just these smaller parts banding to make a larger fleet. LIKE VOLTRON or a MEGAZORD.

Funnily enough dude I'm trying help you yo!!You were very rude during my time for Winter Co. so yes I enjoy a little troll/ banter here and there. Whilst it is cute you think me associated with such a post I would at least bother to link the bots I found whilst my time with you. Other than being linked in here by some racist russian who thinks it's appropriate to tell people to kill themselves I'm struggling to understand the obsession?

BEAUTIFUL MONOCHROME UI IN 2019
---
When people say "what happens before and after" they don't necessarily mean the industry.  When I hear that, I think of positioning around a solar system--placing drag bubbles, pre-setting probes where you think they have a safespot--and getting intel using dscan, warping to pings, watching dotlan and zkillboard, and even just basic local chat.  Even solo lowsec pvp is all about situational awareness and intel, setting your dscan to 1au when you engage so you have advanced warning if his friends are coming, knowing what ships you can engage once theyre already in the plex and which ones you have to be in before and get position on.  It can even be about deducing from local chat who is flying that comet, checking their kb and seeing if they prefer one fit and figuring out if you could beat it.  And all that is even just a quick example of the "before and after" a fight.
---
What I'm saying, essentially, is that EVE is so special because it gets more rewarding the longer you play.  It sounds like you just need to learn more about pvp to really enjoy it--asking here, or finding a helpful corp, or looking up someone like suitonia or johnny pew on youtube is a great way to start!
---
eh, i'm sure they'll start trickling in T2 trig stuff overtime, when people start getting bored/player counts are dropping to try to encourage people to stay sub'd.
---
Thats just what trig stuff feels like to me atm. Just wish they'd actually let Rise have a couple months to do balance stuff so we could inject some fresh things into the meta. 
---
My gawd. The quality of this. 
---
FRT - For the Rmt
---
Can someone tell me why olivia is invincible thanks
---
This was genious... LOL
---
CCP considers casual botting fine, not your bad. If you are looking for the eve rule book you won't find a trace of it in the EULA.
---
The eve rules are rocking horse shit, hardly applied, drops randomly and some dispute over their entire existence.
---
And we all know that will never happen. 
---
"Greed has poisoned men’s souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost…."
---
&gt;WTB a patch that is actually exciting and starts rebalancing things
---
but you see, CCP hates interfering in the sandbox, and balancing ships or the pvpve environment introduces ccp manipulation :(
---
I carry Lights, Heavies, and Salvage drones, and it works fine. VNI bonus isn't drone type specific so it's better in my case.
---
Join a corp. Get any missing skills for primary fleet doctrine ships. Go on some fleets. Do some industry/PI/research/ratting if you want isk, or just the experience of it. 
---
Noob friendly corps include Horde, Brave, and Karmafleet.  
---
Listen, I tried every job in the game, the only one I actually liked was exploring in wormholes, and then I find out that I cant fit a fucking cloaking module, so that if someone wants to hunt me down, they will. Which makes the game silly to me, since I can just give up the moment I see a guy hunting me. 
---
Its a shit way to implement FTP, either do only cosmetics or dont pretend its FTP, its not. 
---
Havens and hubs are combat anomalies that spawn in system, that do not have to be probed out.  And when systems are upgraded another one pops right back up after you finish one.  So you can run them endlessly.  
---
Honestly. If the whelp are going to happen, it's better to happen now, than during wartime.
---
I for one am glad SkillU and Scourge are spanking us around. Darwinism needs to happen at some point. 
---
Dinos already crying and the war hasn't even started yet
---
150bil investment?  Did you buy all the accounts too?  I have contemplated doing something similar since i have 3 accounts and a buddy has 4.  So we could pull it off.  
---
If you're used to the current neocom it will be a pain in the ass adapting to this..... also fuck you ccp for pushing the agency in everyones face.
---
i'm pretty sure that there wasn't any other systems that would be crossing, i know that when i was trying to go from where i had zoomed in to where i live there was a couple systems that just... didn't connect like that
---
one i remember is i walked past provi, and the ring there i lived in when i was in a provi alliance (0B- and friends) wasn't connected to 3KB at all... 
---
Roll back the icons already so we can stop confusing them please.
---
gib colored neocom back
---
Here I was about to get excited that they were going to realize that not everyone is colorblind and bring back the colored icons. 
---
I made my first few PI factory only planets last night as a test. I had to get the skill that maxes out your power to level V first.
---
I set up a P2 to P4 planet as a test (I did trying setting up P1 to P4 in a single planet, but not enough power!). I'm not looking to spend a lot of time with multiple planets in a chain to maximise profits, I just want to grab some easy Isk.
---
Ignoring the factory setup costs I have spent approx 10 million on P2 products which I have dumped into the factories. Once that is all used up I can see how much the final P4 products sell for to get a good idea of the profit margins.
---
The current Custom Office has a tax rate of 10%. Is that high?
---
I made the mistake of setting up one planet next to a sneaky Custom Office with a 98% tax rate! My bad.
---
I also set up a P1 to P3 planet to see how that one goes. I can compare that to the P2 to P4 planet to see which is most profitable.
---
I am doing all of this on a single account. It's all about how to maximise my profit and minimise effort.
---
Perhaps in the future I could set up a chain of planets more efficiently, but I just want to test things out for now and see how the numbers come out.
---
I am trying to avoid extraction because I am lazy :)
---
That is not even 1 plex (20€) in currency. If i was you i would just spend like 20-40€ and have fun. 
---
If u are short on money take your time and gather your ingame currency but it will be a pain in the ass and it will be time in which u wont have much fun
---
Also dont do missions if u want fun. Get into pvp :D
---
I volunteer as tribute
---
If anything shows the priorities of CCP these days, it's "PLEX Vault" being a stand-alone icon while "Wallet" and "Map" are buried in an barely connected menus.
---
How often have you clicked on Wallet versus PLEX Vault?
---
Elon Musk doesn't do anything. He pays people to do things. He's just a Steve Jobs, a dick with too much money, running employee lives into the ground until they are broken.
---
good shit dude
---
You can just leave those assets where they are. You can play the game and have fun without any of it while it sits safely out of sight. Maybe in the future you will find a way to "rescue" them, maybe not. At least for now, you don't need them.
---
Back in the day when there were "roams" in EVE (ask your grandpa what those were), Local was vital so that roaming fleets could find each other and actually have fights.
---
What do u mean when a system is upgraded?
---
Also, for a complete fit, I’d have to know your exact skills, and how much you are willing to spend (some meta modules are a bit pricey). The best I can do is really just to give you a template and you fit in meta/t1/t2 modules as your skills and isk allow, at least without convo’ing you in game and spending some time passing fits back and forth seeing what works
---
Biggest rivalry in EVE nowadays is between Rorquals and Asteroids.
---
A proper love hate relationship that one.
---
Elon musk on the next fanfest . :ccpls:

Rage-escalating 5/10's is fun and profitable.

BUT...I don't usually leave me drones behind.

Glad you enjoyed my gif.

---
I did the same thing, came back to EVE after a 5 year hiatus.  I joined a C3 wormhole small alliance.  Lets me get some new content, citadels to mess with industry once, and harder combat sites.  Was always doing combat and pvp before.  And a C3 can have a static wormhole to high sec.  So if you need to put the game on pause again, it will be easy to move your stuff out.

Yeah man totally. Henry Ford was just some prick too. Those cars and these spaceships would've just built themselves by committee if those rich pricks would get out of the way.
---
You fuckwit.
---
Nice vid! I would add that against a decent lowsec armor frig, even with dual webs, navy rockets will still apply better in most cases. There's also no reason to ever keep at range against a comet; you are right that you need to abuse the heated scram range so orbiting at a pre-set 8.2km will keep you within 9 and give you the edge you need.
---
No, it's not, re read it, you're confusing an event from when I was 10 to what got me jammed up as an adult and you've now fabricated something out of the two events that didn't happen. I fired a weapon in a room full of people (in my own home to clear them out). This is not only public record, its public knowledge.
---
How do you come up with this shit?
---
Fun fact Horde can not access this channel as they are banned from it. Only a select few others have been banned.
---
They will not know the joy of a bait killmail link until they leave horde!
---
There aren't any rivalries any more.
---
People only fight because they are bored, these days. Even that is becoming predictable and slightly monotonous.

\*dips finger in\* Yep, it's piss.
---
Probably you overestimate fcing commitment. Took me around 7 to 8hrs a week for roams all included.
---
Yet if you want to really shake up eve you gotta invest time on it. And it will also mean a damn lot of small talk. 
---
If that doesnt sound like you why not find a pvp niche and become good at it? Killing explorers was what made me stay when i was too busy to stay director.
---
Just my 2 cents
---
the dinos know
---
shut it down
---
* Osmium is dead
---
* EveMon is maintained again and should be on the list ([https://github.com/peterhaneve/evemon/releases](https://github.com/peterhaneve/evemon/releases))
---
It is the best of what you can do pete-like now, but it's missing several things that matter a lot and, due to being changed, made old pre-changes Petes to basically disappear completely.
---
Sensor recalibration time - you can't shoot immediately, and 5s before you can even start locking command destroyers means whatever logi there are, will lock all CDs and put their reps on them preemtively; with how much of an issue losing T3Ds is, it's definitely worth sacrificing 1-2 battleships if need be. Old petes, when going against key support ships in logi range, used to refit to 1-2 recalibration reduction rigs.
---
Align time - if you try to work around recalibration time while getting out of warp, 7s is more than enough to get yourself probed down and have bunch of ceptors land on you at 0 if they're already on grid; and when you get caught like that, you're losing a lot. Not to mention, in 7s while warping @100 you can be caught and pointed by any interceptor pilot that's not asleep and is ready to get to you the moment you show up.
---
Scan resolution - you have single range-scripted sebo, compared to flexibility of having 2-3 sebos of old Petes. With 262mm scanres you won't be able to lock command destroyers in time - if you have to wait out sensor recalibration, you'll have to crack through logi; if you're warping in uncloaked, then it's more than likely fleet will boosh either away from you or on top of you before you can get a lock.
---
Signature and sensor strength - also known as "why old Petes worked in first place". Typical use of Petes before T3Cs were changed was to run 2-3 sebos and juggling scripts; you started locking with scanres script being active, then as soon as you've got your target(s) locked, redcycled and swapped the script for ECCM to make probing you down as hard as possible - making you almost unprobable by anything unbonused and without virtues (like FC ceptor for swordfleet or similar) and giving you enough time to get out before getting tackled. Any mistake on that part (not changing script, being late on cycling with ECCM) could as well mean death for entire pete squad, and in practice was the way to deal with them by having one spy in - just get the spy to not run his ECCM and get him probed.
---
Last thing is "10-20 covert, nullified tengus" - it is a role that requires full attention and focus, so you are taking 10-20 people from other ships to perform that duty (old petes often worked well enough as 5-8 man groups). With this amount of people, just using cheaper, less demanding and almost as effective cormorants is more preferable, people can just fly them on alts without having to care for having maxed out skills (flying pete without racial sensor compensation and electronic subsystem trained to 5 was basically equal to sabotage), ship loss and sp loss. Original comment is right in that regard - petes look like they'd work on paper, but with their practical issues, drawbacks and shortcomings there is no place for them over smartbombs or even cormorants.
---
All the old grudges got buried in booze over the years and the new guys are all too fucking beta to ever 'hate' anybody over the internet though.
---
I'm a dinosaur though so i keep one burning: Fuck DBRB.
---
Post less?
---
No no, Stainium should be used to make pigments to color ship hulls, you space fool.
---
When I need to take good screenshots I take a snap with my 35mm camera, have the film developed and blown up, then scan it in with my flatbed scanner. Yeah I could hit PRTSC instead but I find the image is warmer and richer when I put in the extra effort.
---
You have some good thought and ideas but, you come off as a jerk ...
---
I like the idea, but can we pin the stuff we use often to the sidebar?
---
For the future, if you're going to record, please disable the goddamn scanning sound.
---
 Can it melt steel beams?
---
You need to join a good low sec or null corp. Get into some gate camps, roam fleets. Once you have fun pvping, then everything else is there to support the addiction.
---
Join a FW corp with 100-200 members.
---
Almost all FW corps of this size have at least 10 very active players. Most of them are used to small gang pvp. In small gang pvp you are much more than an F1 junky.
---
The instant you log on, always be in corp/alliance comms. This is the fastest way to the action. Most small gang pvp starts with: "Hey guys, I found ____ ship, you want to come gank it with me?" If that isn't happening, be the person that does that.
---
Stop flying expensive ships. I never buy mods more expensive than t2.  They work just fine.  The ship size restrictions in FW opens up the meta to make cheap ships useful. Also, flying cheap ships is a great way to have fights.
---
Why?
---
Honestly go roam wicked creek. You will never catch a vni under the frat treasury tag. A small group of us have been roaming out there for the last 6 weeks and it's the same thing everytime. Enter system, have 6 vnis on scan. Shotgun anoms, vnis off dscan before you even land. It's incredible how mu h attention these vnis are paying 16 hours a day. They must all be on stimulants. 
---
Let's not, it's kinda like when your health provider asks if you drink beer and eat butter.
---
[http://seoi.net/penint/](http://seoi.net/penint/)
---
This tool should be on the list.
---
Lmao you’re a dumbass. We’re not talking about botting and the EULA does expressly talk about third party gambling. 
---
Good failed equivalency though. A+
---
Same happened to me, asset safety it all and just focus on finding a good corp to join. A decent corp will hook you up with some stuff to get you started.
---
Now this is a gopod meme. But I can't understand why people get so excited about Elon Musk and his space business.
---
Would be nice if the Eve calendar could sync up to the eve app on the phone so I could see those events on the phone calendar. 
---
&gt;I'm a dinosaur though
---
grath confirmed dinoposting 2019
---
He is folding into Test now.         
---
Damn....
---
Cheers for the advice guys, the common and sensible suggestion looks to be to find a good corp who can put up with my high-jinx until i get the hang of things.
---
Put the stuff in null up on contract, regroup in HS, find a new corp.
---
Do you know who actually owns that channel? Been trying to find out.
---
yeah nowdays its more a rivaly of ideas / values than  indeviduals .
---
Newbro joins to the super fleet in a solo kessie, gets primaried cause spai, sounds about right.
---
I love these posts! 
---
I mean, I was joking at first, but can you imagine? ECM immunity and a sick local tank. Could definitely spark some expensive fights throughout constellations.
---
I can't stop laughing 
---
Yes I do know. I am an admin of it 😁. 
---
Ratting and mining ISK are even better if it's someone else doing all the mining/ratting, and you can come and collect shiny mods from their wreck.
---
Half Life 128 confirmed.
---
One of these days the great pineapple pizza war will break out all over New Eden.
---
Be cool if there was some rng to mining, like special rocks coming out of one that's being mined that sworth a ton, or a swarm of rogue drones coming out of a rock, that would be sick.
---
lol, what the actual fuck.
---
Wait, You can be bad at shitposting?
---
When a player owned alliance takes control of a system they can install upgrades that provide better stuff like more/larger mining anomalies or more pirate sites.
---
Those citadel "content" shooting fleets are sad sad end to Eve.
---
FUCK OFF CCP ALL THESE UI CHANGES ARE SHIT HOW DO YOU NOT REALIZE THIS AFTER ALL THESE YEARS
---
&gt;and i'm in null in a keep star i'm not part of.   
---
You could certainly try to join the group that currently owns that KS. Depends on what their entrance requirements are, but that might make for an easier transition. 
---
I keep reading this as Furry High Sec moment
---
already have t2 logi, and it is GOOD
---
I feel like we need another "Shoot the Monument" event / unsub.
---
These patch notes are becoming more and more of a joke every time they get released. and never actually relate to anything the community wants. I guess that's what happens when you get brought by PA...
---
2 webs vs an overheated AB firetail (fastest navy frig), navy rockets only applies 1 dps more than rage and this is assuming that the RFF is going full speed which is unrealistic in scram range fights.
---
With a 2 web set up you should only be using navy against the likes of the dramiel or succubus.
---
The fuxk is this post seriously, go back to chewing your table 
---
Big allaince already have full srp of fitted ships. 
---
We stan a regional gate
---
rivalry....oh god
---
i HIGHLY suggest reading Empires of EVE, or listening to the podcast to see how insane "rivalry" can get in EVE.  you'll be enthralled.  in fact it sounds like the book you once read.
---
if your looking for other player conflicts.  i'd suggest Clarion Call 3,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrYe_4vHzgE

---
theres alot of rivalry, many that escalate (though none to the personal emotional level of the Northern War or the  ferocity of the war vs BOB)
---
Woah.
---
&gt;  the new guys are all too fucking beta to ever 'hate' anybody over the internet.
---
That's not true in the non-English speaking side of EVE. Hate and old grudges are still very much alive in the eastern European side of things (Russian, Lithuanian, Bulgarian, Romanian, etc. communities)
---
As already mentioned, in basically every big alliance, ships are fully paid for you blow up, and not just t1 either.
---
Of most fleet doctrines, yes, but I'm talking about dishing out ships not just for fleet ops, but for everyday pvp use as well.
---
This is essentially independent from SRP needs.
---
Yes, there should be low sec gate to stain. 
---
Edited post.  Was literally referring to use outside fleet op SRP.  My bad, poor choice of title.
---
I agree.  Even though my buddy has been released from those charges for a couple years now, he struggled to find a job for a very long time because of what the media did to his reputation.
---
Well there are different kinds of rivalries in Eve. Most common is rivalries between nullsec alliances. It's pretty much rivalry between sports fans of different teams. Everyone's team is shit except their own.
---
And then there is Goons. Many of them are extremely indoctrinated by their internal culture. For people immersed in it, being in that alliance is like being in a cult. They live in their alternate reality. INN (their twitch channel) is like Fox News of Eve. Everyone is out to get them. You can witness this the most during game balance discussions. For many of them, if you happen to offer balance changes against their direct interests and playstyle, you actually hate Goons and want to see the alliance die and that's why you are offering those changes. You can also witness it when one of them did/said something wrong, but all others unite defend him anyways. Anything and everything Goon must be defended at the cost of all rationality.
---
I have been one of the parties that did the most (yet still insignificant) damage to Goons past few years, by killing their ships, mining drones, stealing the drones, and keeping my methods public. If you are such a person, and you are independent (so you don't have another crowded alliance to talk you up as much as they can talk you down), you can be 'memefied' really fast. If enough people talks shit about you, others will start to believe it. Things can get personal and ugly really quickly. To express their rivalry, many of them project me into this autistic socipath with no friends kind of personality. For example, I use an army of alts to achieve what I want, and many of them say things like I have to use alts because I have no friends. I struggled a lot to cope with the toxicity I've been exposed to in mediums like reddit. Particularly to not answer people in their toxic way. Because if you do that vs. hundreds of people, you end up the one looking like a toxic shitlord, regardless of how right you are in things you are defending. So I muted many of them. And now some of them flame me because I mute people lol. I am still struggling with the same thing, but I think I am much better at it after 3 years. You can see residual damage in many balance posts of mine, when people say things like "I can't believe I upvote an Olmeca post". I literally defend the same ideas I defend 2 years ago, but omitting responding to toxic people in their own way, and suddenly people respond much better.
---
Many crowded null alliances also have even worse things in their history, like doxxing etc. But the community seems to have evolved for the better to at least avoid these worst kind of things. DDOSing enemy communications is still a thing. I personally detest any kind of action that takes Eve rivalry out of character and carries it to real life.
---
How a vpn should help for connectivity?
---
I know for a fact that I've spent over $100 in less than a year. 
---
Lol this reads like an /r/AskReddit post
---
Only if the scanner was tube based.
---
but can he F E A T H E R
---
&gt; Or even the fact that they're spending time spinning their wheels on launcher changes and the Neocom menu but the balance of ships in the game is a fucking joke. 
---
I spend more time to pvp in my alpha toon than my omega so yes the f2p is very nice.
---
I have 10 toon in 10 place diferent so if there is no content pvp with one, i just log one and come back with another one ;)
---
If he is going to, make sure he uses your recruit a friend code. Also taking him out to null may not be that bad of an idea, depending on who your alliance is. It also depends on what he wants to do. I'd he hasn't got the smallest idea, well you two could go off and try and find content in burner ships. 
---
CCP in 2016: We feel that AHAC T3Cs are too prevalent, and too good at everything. Although they cause SP loss and cost billions of ISK, we have decided to nerf them heavily to encourage players to use other ships.  
---
CCP in 2018: caps should be able to do anything lol!!!!!!
---
We shot the monument the first time when they added an overpriced cosmetic selection and hinted at pay to win mechanics.
---
Then they continued selling overpriced cosmetics, and added pay to win mechanics, and nobody cared enough to do anything, so now we live here.
---
&gt; After looking at usage metrics, it became apparent that there was a need to establish a clearer set of folders relevant to activities in EVE, as well as reducing the number of unanchored icons (icons that are outside any folder).
---
Great, maybe you should spend some time looking at ship usage metrics and module usage metrics and doing something about the state of the game.
---
Lmfao
---
fucking why?
---
\*Rantmode on\*
---
Devblog about Neocom folder structure changes? Really? This has to be some of the least important stuff CCP could "work" on. 
---
What about the chat issues? Balancing? Rorquals and skill injector problems? Capitals proliferation? How about we get a producers letter? A general roadmap for 2019? Anything a little bit more important than "neocom reshuffling"?
---
BAH! Disgusting!
---
\*Rantmode off\*
---
&gt; After looking at usage metrics, it became apparent that there was a need to establish a clearer set of folders relevant to activities in EVE, as well as reducing the number of unanchored icons (icons that are outside any folder).  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;To do this, we took a few factors into consideration, including the most commonly used windows in the client and the most popular activities in New Eden.
---
This is such a dishonest statement.  No way are players using the PLEX Vault or NES Store more than the market or their inventory.  
---
Not that it matters, but we didn't get batphoned. We noticed the timer, and just wanted in on the fight. But we didn't wanna just blob you, so we were waiting for Bastion to stand down. But they didn't, so we came in anyway.
---
Join a NPSI fleet with them, or go out to lowsec in faction warfare space, and shoot something.
---
This made me giggle in the supermarket, gf.
---
shame on you for encouraging this guy by citing soul-crushing tidi-fests that even experienced players hate.  You know nobody likes sitting in a laggy slideshow trying for several minutes to activate guns and hardeners.  That's not a game, it's not fun, and it's not rewarding. It's the price of admission for those of us who want to be part of a major alliance, and none of us like it.
---
Could have been a faulty bot; I've seen an explosion of them in my neck of the EVE woods. They tend to flee and not contest a site; usually as soon as they warp in and see It's occupied. Don't communicate, just churn the exploration sites in their Gilas 23/7.
---
Good, Russians killing each other saves the rest of us, they're not killing us!
---
So awesome, thank you for that pick me up 
---
Oh god no one of our alliance leaders works for him and you do *not* want to see the man's excited face. 
---
Yeah, you’re probably going to need more than “tHeY’rE cHinESe!1!” if it’s bans you’re after.
---
A manly chin. With a glorious beard.
---
What's life like with a bug up your ass 24/7?
---
[Show me your honor!](https://www.oglaf.com/honor/)
---
corp can insure now
---
put ship in corp hangar, right click insure (assuming you have wallet rights) 
---
corp auto gets insurance payout, no sweat
---
only problem is people buying their own insurance to replace the corp insurance and insurance fraud the ship you gave them for free but meh
---
I'm still not going to use The Agency CCP, fucking stop it. 
---
All true points.. But they do hold the keys to their own kingdom. The only way you topple the kingdom is by not subscribing to their game. At this point you could still play as Alpha and not give them a cent. 
---
It would hopefully force them to go "oh shit we are haemorrhaging money" we need to fix something though more than like it will be "oh shit we are haemorrhaging money, let's put the shut down notification in for eve" 
---
Oi !! Watch out mate ?!!! Ima posting here !
---
&gt;was
---
Indeed.
---
My first go at Eve lasted 1 week because I mistakenly thought it was just a mining game.
---
Then I saw salty videos which brought me back.
---
Forgive my none understanding of this , but what exsactky would be the difference between the 32bit and 64bit??
---
Just like their last 50 UI redesigns, this is utter shit.  CCP Abyss obviously cares more about money (Ad-filled "new launcher" and now "streamlining" the shitty neocom to reduce functionality but put the RMT icons on top).  Great fucking job.
---
They're even removing functionality by removing direct menu options to Ship/Item hangars because it is "confusing to new players"?  Whatever crack they're smoking, I think I need some.
---
that was nearly half a year ago when the PLEX market was artificially inflated by literally 2100 free PLEX in each Galaxy Pack f.e.
---
they got bought lol they don't hold the keys to shit 
---
Doxx then report them to IRS/inland revenue/other country tax authorities 
---
Ok now this is 10/10 posting. 
---
most of the imperium already have SRP for non doctrine ships. they just don’t pay as much out 
---
Not like it's anything new, CCP/Falcon have been well known to lie through their teeth whenever it suits them.  People have been bending over and taking it for so long they don't even try anymore.
---
Your method has the following flaws:
---
* It places the burden of recovering insurance payouts on the alliance. Someone needs to be combing the killboard for losses to collect on.
---
* Some line members will not be glad to pay the insurance back to the alliance when they're already salty about losing a ship. 
---
* Some line members may claim that the insurance expired or make various excuses for not having the ISK.
---
* Some line members will take the free hulls and sell them.
---
* Coverage is limited to T1 ships that insure well.
---
In short, in your system the alliance has a heavy burden of proactive oversight to limit abuse, which means more space paperwork and poor scalability.
---
The way alliance SRP works in practice is by shifting most of the burden to the line member. The line member pays for the ship up front, is responsible for ensuring it is fitted correctly, has the option of insuring it and keeping the payout, and is responsible for filing the SRP request with an API-linked lossmail and corresponding fleet ping. The alliance simply reviews the particulars of each case and makes a decision to grant or deny the request. This can even be expanded to Imperium-style 'shitstack' SRP which offers a fixed payout for each class of ship with little regard to the circumstances of the loss.
---
most of the alliances in the imperium (not sure about other major coalitions) have SRP for both doctrine and non doctrine every day pvp ships... the non doctrine losses just don’t pay as much.
---
&gt;I fired a weapon in a room full of people
---
Ah, so you are just a seething raging twat with anger issues.
---
32bit is limited to 4GB of ram
---
Any particular reason for using a Tengu vs another t3c? Or would any t3c work? 
---
All that needs to be known is the date the original hull is issued.
---
Further hulls will not be distributed without the payback.
---
Invalidates pretty much any other responsibility on the alliance and focuses it (insurance upkeep, payback) onto the player.
---
I recently just kinda got back into the game after not fully quitting, but only logging in like once a week for a couple years. Went from null to WH, sold off some stuff in null just to have enough money for basic stuff. Depending on where you go though they might have some ships available to new members.
---
not anymore with skill injectors and mineral availability from rorqs
---
That "Bounty Office" in the "Activities" folder is completely misleading... I mean, new player might actually think that it is possible to be a Bounty Hunter. Realizing that it is just part of a prehistoric and totally broken mechanic will be hard.
---
Progodlegend and Sort Dragon, iirc
---
[This will be Elon if he gets his way.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWmMCxRyUbs)
---
Instead of accessing what you want with one single click, CCP has made it easier by now requiring a click and drop-down..
---
CCP, breaking shit that isn't broken since 2003.
---
&gt; I don't think taking him straight to nullsec is the best idea.
---
I disagree, you're not doing him any favors by having him start out in hisec. It's not a starter system, it's just as dangerous as (or more than) nullsec but teaches you horrible habits for surviving anywhere else in the game.
---
Get him in a newbie alliance that will teach/support him and get him to nullsec or lowsec asap.
---
So does that mean that i can get the plex vault removed from my inventory window so i can stop fucking clicking on it when i want to go to my item hangar?
---
T1 Frig and Cruiser PVP make up a fit and head into low sec brawl die. Reship. Repeat.
---
Extraction certainly complicates the entire supply chain. Just the other day I ran into an issue where i had set a planet to extract the wrong material! 
---
I keep thinking about buying some P2 materials to boost production, but I'm not sure I'll actually be making much profit on those after costs, taxes, and everything else.
---
I set up my sheet specifically so I could plug in numbers and then see what I need to extract today based on what will be looking tomorrow. I also threw in changing the allocation of factories to see what it might take to catch up on some production lines. 
---
"I was lazy" is never a good excuse to post a blurry phone pic of a screen.
---
That's a pretty big "but meh" if you're trying to argue the point.
---
In my scenario, the corp isn't paying for the insurance.
---
The corp member isn't paying for the ship.
---
Corp member spending less money.
---
Alliance receiving platinum insurance payout, after producing said ship at under cost of insurance payout = profit.
---
It's not hard to understand.  This could be anything to thrashers to caracals to brutix for any type of use.  Camping a gate.  Non-FC roams.  Random defense.  Lose your ship, pay back the alliance, get another ship.  Minimal cost.  Minimal effort on everyone's part (who cares about a killmail in this case).  Members pay less for non-fleet ships.  Alliances come out isk positive.
---
5 minutes in one of our fleets is sufficient to cure any misapprehension about our eliteness.
---
Hahahaha do one with a doomsday!
---
* The alliance needs to keep an accurate database of ships handed out indexed by date and pilot, also keeping track of alts of the same pilot.
---
* The alliance eats the cost of every ship handed out up front and recovers only some of them. Member turnover and pilots going inactive cost the alliance.
---
Workable on a small scale, within a corp of trusted members. It's a simple fact that people take better care of their own property though.
---
What do you think are the advantages of your method?
---
For future reference: warnings are saved in client settings, you can reset warning status to get it back on any account.
---
ELON MUSK IS A BLOBBER - HE JUST SEES A SMALL PROBLEM AND BLOBS IT WITH MONEY, FUCKING DOUCHE.
---
I haven't checked if it has every ship, it's titled 'PvP Ships', but https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/List_of_PvP_Ships_by_Bonus is a handy list for connecting a purpose to a ship or just brainstorming fits in general.
---
Same problem I've wrestled with for years.
---
Now my alt does trading for Isk (average 15 mins per day) and my main flies cloaky ships in wormholes.
---
No stress.
---
no, it isn't hard to understand. what is hard to understand is why you're so defensive about your idea of this hilarious amount of paperwork to duplicate a mechanic that's already in the game 
---
Wasnt Xtracringy booted?
---
I'm fairly certain it's not the same resources within  the company that work on both the neocom and ship balance, but I might be wrong.
---
If anything they should colorized those icons whichever metric told them those pseudo monochromatic abominations are acceptable was totally off
---
fuck off space idiot
---
I think just fuck ccp is enough for the amount of bs they've put you through the past few years. 
---
Soontm /s
---
join a Wormhole corp
---
wormhole space best space 
---
look in r/evejobs for one in your tz
---
if they're autistic tards or otherwise not what you're looking for just find a different one, no problem 
---
So you remove my ability to use separate window for ship hangar, cause it might confuse a new player if he accidentally finds it buried in the menus???
---
It sounds way more complicated than it needs to be tbh. When dealing with small ships, it's easy enough to provide handouts. I know Pandemic Horde hands out destroyers and frigates for free, and usually gives out new ones no questions asked. Sometimes they'll ask how you lost it (and ask to see a killmail) but that's mostly for teaching purposes.
---
But the point is that if you were planning to defraud the alliance, you'd have to steal a huge number of cheaply fitted cormorants before you made even a small dent in the alliance's stockpile. If you're giving out bigger t1 ships, fraud could get fairly lucrative fairly quickly.
---
Even assuming you limit it to t1 subcaps, what stops some random alt from waltzing in, getting 10 battleships, and wandering off with over a billion isk worth of ships?
---
Dab on comets, oppress gallente, slay firetails. Caldari masterrace.
---
Easily the best cheap ship/skin combo in the game
---
Oh perhaps their focus groups include plenty of people like me who think the colored icons look horrid and outdated, and are a massive glaring distraction on the side of the screen. If I have permanent items and menus up I want them as bland and able to fade into the background as possible.
---
If you need stuff color coded to see it, that's fine, whatever. But the majority of us can see the icons and tell them apart instantly, and I've been using them for four years without a single complaint. Sorry man, they might add it back one day as an option but the majority of us like the new look.  
---
I like to think Falcon's intentions are pure but CCP have got some sort of leverage over him so he has to post CCP Propaganda.
---
/u/CCP_Falcon give us a sign if you are making these dev blog posts full of lies under duress.  
---
Just reordered all my neocoms, NES store isn't one of the priorities I must say. Plus it was very misleading. Just to be clear there are no retro games to be found.
---
Most large corps will give out cheap frigs, destroyers, and cruisers.
---
This sounds like a lot of man hours for very little gain.
---
At this point they should just allow us to rearrange the menus by dragging the icons around. Lock and unlock. Change the size.     
---
It works for the sidebar.     
---
Oh and how about being able to pick a color theme.     
---
And saving/sharing the layout so you can setup your alts clients to be exactly the same.    
---
ok now this is so epic
---
Stupid question, but is there a difference between the terms krab and carebear?
---
You can already, just drag it from one of the menus
---
Init and most of high class WH space aren’t exactly in love with each other right now. 
---
On a completely unrelated note, would you like to come on Talking in Stations and talk about the ongoing war? We had Scourge on a few weeks ago and he did great.
---
This is rather complicated process to get people slight reimbursement for their ships for little to no gain over regular SRP. What you're describing is some weird hybrid between ship handouts (FC or someone else is giving away ships, sometimes players are expected to trade them back if they survived after fleet, so ships can be used in another roams), alliance-seeded market/contracts (with how large T1 cruisers and above are, why not just seed them on market instead? People would literally lose ISK trying to pay for moving them to sell somewhere else) and regular SRP for losses. It also skips completely the fact that for building ships you have to use your industry slots, which requires a lot of characters to do any proper mass scale production, and you have a lot of value stuck in relatively hard to move or liquidate assets (compressed ore is much easier to move than already built ships).
---
Main goal behind SRP or similar programs is to get people to fly certain ships (either specific function ships or just to pvp) by requiring them to invest nothing outside their time and attention. If you make process too complicated or too demanding for a player, you give up on that goal, and whatever little ISK alliance would save on this approach is at that point meaningless. And if you want to do it in a way similar to what you're suggesting - why not just sell those ships for subsidized, lower price in first place? You get same effective ship price for member, and whatever level of potential fraud there might be, it will be either insignificant or very easy to find out using ESI or just noticing someone buying huge amount of ships that disappear, not to mention no reasonable player will risk getting kicked from alliance they want to be in for literal 200mil ISK.
---
IMO, I don't think that's what Burn Jita was really about.  Those issues, while indeed pissing people off (althought I'm not sure where the P2W concept was, refresh my memory if I'm forgetting something), and with the "Greed is good" article taken out of context sparking the powder keg, both issues were actually considered secondary issues by most of the player base.
---
The true precipitating issue that pushed the community over the edge and induced the 'riot' was hyping up "Walking in Stations" for 18 months and then massively underachieving. Over the previous year or so,  CCP had used the excuse that so many resources were being allocated to Walking in Stations that they could only provide small expansions and minimal bug fixes.  There were supposed to be in station casinos, bars, lounges, apartments, etc; it was supposed to be a whole new phase of the game.  It was going to be the biggest, best thing EVER (tm)!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Instead we got a captain's quarters with a display screen people would stream porn to and a door that went nowhere.  The new engine was also very taxing for PC hardware at the time; so while the character creation screen was a generation ahead of its time, a lot of people started experience computer performance issues just for the sake of being able to walk up to your ship in a docking bay and dress your character up like a Barbie doll.   
---
So, after experiencing the biggest let down in Eve history and being charged $80 for a cosmetic monocle (against the wishes of CCP Zinfandel and the other devs; who were over ruled by Hilmar who told them they "didn't have any balls" because they weren't charging enough for Eve Store items); and reading the "Greed is Good" article after it leaked  (which was written for an internal CCP newsletter as part of a debate.  Someone had been assigned that stance to defend, it wasn't actually an expression of a dev's (or CCP's) actual beliefs); the dam broke. People had had enough, and the rest is Eve history.  
---
Yeah I'm just trying out buying P2 products to see how much I can make. If it's OK then I just have to dump P2s onto the planet and pick up P4s which should be about once a week. Using Amarr to buy &amp; sell. I'll see how it goes.
---
INIT doesn't care about Wormhole space at all
---
While I agree, it's also nice to be near jita to grab stuff whenever you want like skill books, implants, boosters. Maybe have him do the tutorials and an epic arc first before going to null. 
---
I would look at the BoB era, SirMolle specifically with regards to their rivalry with GoonSwarm.
---
Also look up ‘Jade Constantine’, a very polarizing figure in early eve.
---
Basically, just read empires of eve lmao
---
Stain IS "SH#$$%T"
---
No i was defending my home from intruders in a state with a law that says retreat until retreat is not an option.  
---
Thanks for admitting you're stupid and wrong and literally dont know what the fuck you were talking about though.
---
If your corp is newbro friendly that it should be fine cause heater got you to help him out. Teach him the basics of how to navigate null and around other people in general. Teach him how to make isk then let him loose. Most people will either sink or swim here. And you obviously don't want to hold his hand the whole way.
---
This is really the best analogy. Alpha allows people who can't afford or don't want to keep an active subscription to still contribute to the game, and for new players to learn all about what's available to them. Maybe you'll eventually discover a playstyle you're interested in that requires a subscription to go further, and you can decide then if you like the game enough to want to do that. If not, there's still plenty you can do as an alpha.
---
I wish I had some sort of comprehensive list of modules when I started, there were so many small things I missed out on because I only really knew about popular and cookie cutter fits/modules. It’s easy enough to go through the modules via the simulator, but I could see that being overwhelming if you are new. It also took me a long time to use the compare window to see the difference in stats, especially fitting, I think this could be streamlined into some sort of simple graphic to help new people learn. Nothing in huge detail, more just “if you go this way on the list it costs less power grid and gives better resists” or something. 
---
Fitting is another huge one. I always used to stick to t2/meta modules because they were cheap. There are tons of storyline/faction modules that are equal to or better than t2 with much better fitting and low prices. This kind of ties into the above point. One example of this is story line cap boosters, they really aren’t that expensive, the cycle time difference is non existent for most purposes, and they give you a ton of extra fitting room. Small things like that can open up a ton of fits that you may have only had access to with implants or simply not been able to fit period. 
---
You generally do not want to be cap stable. It screws your fitting and is largely worthless. I put huge value in cap stability when I was new, largely because it was hard for me to comprehend why cap boosters were worth having if there was a free alternative, or the huge value of boosters under neut pressure (think inject repping, etc).
---
The other thing that was overwhelming as a new player was all the additional little things modules do, for example MWD with signature radius, cap power relays lowering shield boost, or cap batteries with neut resistance, a lot of the “secondary” effects of modules were completely lost on me. That was mostly because of mentality  of “look up a fit in zkill and go for it” or just being handed a fit with no understanding of it instead of actually thinking through fits. 
---
It also took me forever to realize the importance of implants and how much they change your ships stats, or how a 1% pg implant that costs a few million can be worth. Same with drugs, side effects always scared me and I figured it wasn’t worth paying for “only a half hour” or whatever. Even though there are videos out about drugs for noobs, I never saw them. 
---
I think if you are clever with it you can simplify tons of stuff and just plant the general idea to check on the bonuses, secondary effects, compare items, and so on. It would be cool to walk through sample fittings, and maybe use each previous fit as an example of how to fit the current ship to counter the last one. If I saw something like that when I was new it would probably inspire me to think about fittings more, or at least practice it more often.
---
Speaking of practice: I had no idea about external tools such as Pyfa, but the more time you spend on it theory crafting the better you will get at fitting, even if your fits suck it is still a good exercise, so I would heavily encourage that.
---
There’s tons more small stuff about picking the right ship for the job, thinking of engagements you want to take while fitting, etc., but I’m tired of typing and I’m sure other people will bring it up.
---
First, I'm hypothetically assuming these numbers.  I don't know the exact rates.  I can definitely get them, but not at this time.
---
Alliance **produces** ship at 10% under platinum insurance payout.
---
80% of pilots who receive a ship through this process pay it back after a ship loss.
---
Let's call that a 20% loss.  It's a 20% loss of potential revenue (not necessarily profit).
---
What have you gained?  You're offering pilots a cheap all-purpose ship.  Not everyone SRPs random ship losses.
---
Of the 80% that have paid back, it brings that loss down to 12% (10% increase in payback - which isn't a mystery, we know what this number has to be).
---
Of the 20% that haven't paid back, they aren't going to be receiving another ship anyway.
---
You can assume that out of the remaining 80%, you probably won't have a 20% non-payment out of that group.  New people could be added to the pool, but if we're assuming a standard rate of decay, there will be an equilibrium where either a) the 10% bonus return will account for non-reimbursement or b) there will be no non-reimbursement unless there is no ship loss.  Once again, these are hypothetical numbers, but if your turnover rate is more than that 20% margin, you may have other things to worry about.  I could be wrong.
---
For that 100% initial investment, you will essentially be providing a service that few alliances do (extremely cheap all-purpose T1 ships).  Not everyone provides free ships.  Not everyone can afford to.
---
And if someone is responding "well, the largest coalition in the game does this better already" then I guess everyone should just join them so there's no one left to shoot.  This isn't for them, and if that's your argument, it's probably not for you.  But it is viable for a small-scale alliance trying to entice players.  And if the equilibrium I mentioned above is reached, every ship loss becomes a profit for the alliance.  At that point, it doesn't matter if someone is taking care of the property or not.  It would be more viable that they don't.  And there is no "fraud" in this case.  You don't even need to provide a killmail.  Date of provision / date of payback is all that's necessary.
---
no
---
So I’m guessing 64b would be 8gb ram , but how does it improve the game ? 
---
https://evefrigates.blogspot.com
---
I am not sure that is your typical FC. Doing nothing but FCing in game is not how most people would play the game.
---
Clearly that's not a mining laser but actually a Titan Doomsday but he needs to market it to miners so he used it on a moon.
---
Absolutely beautifully done! To r/all! 
---
Depends on who you want to attract.
---
If the alliance can afford 1 billion a month for ships, then it would go a long way to have a program like this.  The problem with this sub is that too many people only have the perspective of large coalitions and think that's all there is to Eve.
---
Nice Guide
---
When I started playing we didn't have no fancy warp to zero. We had to make bookmarks for everything. And fit 4 MWDs. And we had to deal with drag bubbles in the middle of your warp. And we liked it, damn it!
---
my rivalry with PL has probably been game defining tbh.
---
Set the nature of CFCs original stance vs PL, adjusted modified and now to the end threading thread of their near irrelevance 
---
When is this going to happen?  CCP's site says "Winter 2018-2019" and we're like 5 weeks from official spring.  Will the client make it?
---
Because you're required to pay back before receiving another ship?
---
The only valid response.
---
Disabled gates ought to be a thing in lowsec and null, just as a random nusiance to force people to use alternate routes.
---
It's already in the game if you want to join one of three coalitions or major alliances, sure.
---
Once again, I forgot about the curse of the sub: there's only one perspective.
---
I think you are underestimating the headache and paper work you're trying to create.
---
Not to mention apathy.  People care about their ships because their effort went into buying the ship, their money.  They care more, so they try harder to keep the ship alive.  
---
Full SRP for peacetime like you're suggesting breeds laziness and the amount of ships you'll lose will go through the roof as the pilots in them stop caring what happens to them.
---
Have you ever considered anger management classes?
---
Along with many others here I strongly encourage you to try some solo and small gang PvP. Go stock a hanger somewhere in Faction Warfare space with a few dozen T1 frigates and lose them fighting solo or with a friend or two in novice and small plexes.
---
A couple of tools I found useful as I was starting out I keep open in a browser while flying around looking for fights.
---
* Map of the warzone: [Caldari v Gallente](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Caldari_VS_Gallente#kills) or [Amarr vs Minmatar](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Amarr_VS_Minmatar#kills). Look at kills to see where the fun is happening you might get in on.
---
* The [Frigates yearbook 2019](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12w6WhG1qaWJHwQoxJ5p812mtdctUJhrD/view). Descriptions and an overview of the common fittings and tactics for all the T1 and faction frigs.
---
*  [Eve Overmind's PVP intel](https://www.eveovermind.com/combatrecon.php). Paste in local chat and see who else is in the system, who's in the same corps and alliances. Quick overview of how dangerous/aggressive all of them are, what they tend to fly etc.
---
* [Eve Overmind's 1v1 win %](https://collab.eveovermind.com/solokills.php). 1v1 win percentages of different ships against each other. Nothing so useful as the yearbook above but good for a very quick heads up about how tough the fight you're about to get into is likely to be.
---
I think I will do the epic Arc with him. Get him a little used to pvp. Then out to me space for sometime. Then take him to provi so he can earn his red status. Then just out to null lol. I thought about just sending him around with a cyno and then dropping my Phoenix on whatever catches him too. The thought gave me a chuckle. I actually might do it. Lol.
---
As much as has changed with EVE over the years, the core game play is still pretty much the same. You may have to learn about a few new hull types like command destroyers and T3 destroyers, but for the most part you should be able to jump back in with little trouble. And for whatever you've forgotten or need to learn, all of the newbie friendly corps (Brave, Karmafleet, PH) run training classes. Karmafleet specifically has weekly training fleets for everything from basic PVP to logi to boosting and bubbling. We also have a Gooniversity with dedicated players to help you with everything from flying ships to earning ISK.
---
Have you ever considered figuring out the facts of what you're talking about before opening your gigantic fat ass mouth?
---
Will they keep that functionality?
---
Is there any particular trick to farming t4 and t5 filaments in the abyss? They're not seeded on sisi and I'm trying to stockpile them to test fits by running t3s but not getting many drops.
---
Does anyone know if they are more likely to drop in t1, 2 or 3? Or if the type of filament used influences what drops?
---
The epic arc is a good idea, that's how I started out too. So I'd modify my comment to add that before nullsec. 
---
F2P is ok for learning the game, getting a feel for it, but you'll want a full account eventually (there are limits) if you like it.  You can get a few months of fun out of F2P, a lot more if you like small ships.  You'll eventually find a need for having a lot more skills though, and F2P accounts have a rigid skill limit.  You can't skill past 5m points, and if you sub, you can get that to 20m and still use the skills as F2P, but... it does limit how many things you can be good at.
---
Money does not, imho, provide a vast advantage.  It really allows you to get blown up in more expensive ships.  In fleet battles, the usual practice is to target the most expensive stuff on the other side first.
---
Also, diminishing returns are severe.  10% better costs 5x, 15% better costs 10X, etc.  It gets steep fast.

Mmm I don't know what attributes you are using but I get a 25% dps increase using navy rockets against firetail (roughly 120 applied w/ rage vs 150 w/ navy).
---
There's more work in producing the ships and shipping them, sure, but if you're not referring to that, I don't think you understand the work involved.
---
Yet, I've seen people having nervous breakdowns trying to process SRPs.
---
This is **Date of Issue / Date of Reimbursement** for the alliance. 
---
For the player, it's Receive Ship &gt; Insure Ship &gt; Lose Ship &gt; Reimburse &gt; Receive Ship.  If your pilots can't be expected to pull that off, how are they even playing this game?  They're already doing it.  It's almost exactly the same amount of steps as buying off the market.
---
And who cares if they care?  Unless you're having a problem reimbursing and can't scale up your industry, there is no bottleneck.  Reimbursements minus entropy of non-paybacks will eventually reach an equilibrium of overhead cost or potentially profit.  At that point, the more ships lost = more isk for the alliance = who gives a fuck?
---
The torrent of attention seeking posts from init members following literally nobody giving a singular shit about their "great achievement" suggests otherwise.
---
It would actually be something like 16 Exabytes of RAM. Each bit allows twice as much addressing space.
---
That is a good question, one I hadn't considered. I hope they don't change that feature, it's been there forever. Ordering the neocoms is useful for the different roles in Eve. A fixed UI system would be restrictive, I can't see them doing it, the current one may change slightly but I doubt there will be anything drastic. But being honest, I'd just adapt anyway unless it was something daft. As is everything in life...
---
Hah that's awesome, sounds like a good plan. I enjoy trying to kill low sec fw frigates. Good times. 
---
 Does hating on CCP count?
---
Unless you're flying a T3 destroyer or T3 cruiser, you won't really be able to pack combat probes to scan ships down. You *can* cheese some people with regular core probes if your goal is to hunt people doing relic/data sites because core probes are piss easy to fit if you have a utility high (granted that doesn't include most T1 frigates so YMMV) and you'll just use dscan to figure out "oh there's someone in the site".
---
My own rule of thumb flying solo is warp around to some different celestials so that you can get some dscan time across all the likely places someone could be in space at, and always check gates. Also never warp gate-to-gate because that's a good way to get caught in a drag/catch bubble and die in a fire.
---
If you see Vexors/VNIs on scan, unless they're on gate, I wouldn't even bother with them. You probably won't catch them unless your in a Dramiel or hyperspatial shield gank Hecate.

I think you pretty much answered it yourself.  Doing this for 12 guys, or even 20, probably not a problem, 2000 guys, suddenly it gets nightmarish, more than that and you've created an entire paper pushing heap and a team of people that need to address it.

Another shitty attempt to make something racial out of a serious issue of cheaters and rmtters. Trust me, most legit chinese people who played the game for fun have longed stopped playing the game after how their server turned out to be. And it's not just "hurr durr chinese people are botting". There are people from all parts of the world who benefit from all these rmt botters. Probably some inferiority complex or a small penis one that made most of them cheat. Whether that's account sharing, fake support tickets, allowing and profiting off of botters and rmtters and lying about it, mocking people with disabilities, threatening people, etc. BabyRage "ma, this bad man killed my ship"

---
To further clarify: only things you can really buy for RL cash in eve besides subscription is a way around grinding (ISK) and - from that - waiting (SP in form of skill injectors). If you add the fact that amount of skillpoints applicable at single time is limited (after getting all core skills more SP means you have more options of ships/modules to use, year old character specialized in single ship will likely have same applicable skills as someone who injected all possible skills), and that better stuff isn't free win over knowing what to do (often better stuff is just slightly better for much higher cost), f2p drawbacks aren't really huge, and I've seen multiple cases of alpha pilots knowing what to do, utterly destroying omega players who threw lots of money at the game without really learning anything.

They burned out and faded into obscurity like 12 years ago. I think they were loosely associated with PL for a while. But that article in PC gamer was the reason I started playing.

This depends on what you do for fun and how you play, sometimes cheaper ships aren't really an option. But even then, great way to not need as many isk is just to stop losing ships. ;)

Welp, we had a good run boiz, pack it up and leave the blind people alone. They are the ones who are gonna be surprised pikachus when a big headline emerges about rmting. "I never knew the guy next door was botting." Ok Sherlock. I wish we had at least an in-game corp for banned people. Would go to show all these people who cry about proof how blind they are.
---
BTW, if all you lazy melons get your asses up and spend a couple of minutes even trying to look at some people who have been accused of botting you would see they are either burned/banned or are still botting and it's pretty easy to spot. Just make sure to be blue to them so they don't insta warp to a pos and sit there for hours until they blue you and eventually and go back to botting.

You can find some NPSI fleets or join some easy-in nullblobs like PH. You don't need to worry about fitting, just buy from doctrine contract or buy-all whatever fit they put in motd.

One of the really interesting things about EVE is the dichotomy between our relationships in game and out of game. If you've spent 5 minutes browsing this subreddit, you can see just how seriously we take this game and how far we go with our tribalism. Wars are fought over grudges from more than a decade ago. BUT, if you ever go to a live meet up you will see players from factions that are bitter rivals in game buying each other drinks and cavorting like old friends. Personally, I will hold a forever grudge against PL and everything they stand for in game, but then I go to EVE Vegas and spend an hour and a half playing craps with their leader, Elise Randolph. I also ended up meeting one of my closest real life friends to this day at that craps table.

At the end of the day we're *pretty* good about remembering that its just a game.

---
Whatever helps you sleep at night.
---
No doubt, I've stated elsewhere this wouldn't be a means to replace an SRP method on a large scale.  It could be, but it would create an inordinate amount of undesirable work for more people.
---
Aside from that, however, I know this method has been used in the past for smaller alliances trying to attract more pvp pilots, I'm just curious of the viability now with production prices etc.
---
The problem with proposing an idea like this on this sub is that you typically only get feedback from people in large-scale alliances or coalitions.  Of course they're going to view it negatively.
---
SpaceX flamethrower fundraising gone out of control!

You could go either way really. That's kinda up to you. They might try to suicide gank you or wardec your corp if you mine with out asking. A lot of people in Eve are nice though so just asking might go a long way.

My alliance is 100 alts, about 30 actual people.  I'm speaking from a place of having a lot to do with guiding a larger alliance (2k alts, 700ish people) to a small one.

What you'd really want is a coder, you'd like the process as automated as possible, through a web site or forum where its just automatically processed so a single director can just look at a list and pay the people on it without chasing shit down or directly talking to the people who want the money.

Pretty much anything else is going to become a pain in your ass over time.

The rivalry between small gangers and the dirty supercap bloobers.

In all seriousness, I think the only CURRENTLY developing rivalry is in the east between SkillU/Scourge. and the TESTicle blob.

Yes. Partly it's for fitting (Cal Navy long points take up a lot less CPU than meta variants, including the compact, for example), partly it's for performance.

yea my bad i didnt address that. i would say that most .5 systems have active athanors in them at this point. what you can do is get into a desired system warp around to the athanors and you can visibly see if its either pulling a chunk that will be exploded or there is a belt there already. and then just take notes maybe start reaching out to corps about getting in on it. me personally i would just ninja mine any belt i found until i get pushed off.

Serious question Stainguy, why do you A)stay in that godforsaken place and B) underprice your faction mods so deliciously
---
Technically, it'd be the other way around.
---
You'd need a sheet someone would look at to process the ship request, and verify repayment had been received for the previously provisioned ship (if there was one).  Takes the same or less time than processing an SRP request.
---
Repayment tracking could be automated.
---
Ship requests could be form input / slightly automated.
---
Realistically, a person would have to check one sheet, check another sheet, deliver ship to person requesting.
---
Goons have the best srp program. Its tier based. You get more if you lose a ship on a a strat op fleet, little bit less on a peace time fleet and you also get money for solo pvp or small gank non alliance fleets. I think you can check the payout of different hulls even if you are not registered on their website.
---
Is "hole control" something you are familiar with?
---
Whoa, harsh.
---
Is not about the timing is also about controlling the exit. Recommend criting your static to lower the probability of getting killed 
---
People are litterally going to lose their shit when it takes more than one click to get the inventory window to open.
---
They also have the scale to deliver on that program with minimal work (automation) and tons of revenue to back it up.
---
What if you're a small alliance on a small budget?
---
With some hulls you actually make money by losing them .

I do want to see the truth, that's why I'm interested in seeing specific accusations supported by specific evidence. Demagoguery and opaque ramblings != interesting/compelling proof. We all know there are bots and RMTing to spare, but the specifics are where actual progress is made.

Monochrome is the way to go. The colour stuff look like amateur garbage.

That's a good point. I was told to roll the wholes, but that seemed like too much work. But, I completely forgot about just getting it to the point to make it not worth coming through. 
---
It'll be blown up in exactly zero amount of time. Go live in one of the Eve mogul ones or something.
---
Did CCP ever announce what the solution was for all the POS and mods left over after the switch to structures? Are they going to be replaced with something or is the only option to recycle them?
---
I've been playing long enough to know this is bullshit. I've taken down my fair share of structures, I just haven't ever put one up. 
---
That's part of my point here.
---
If the alliance is producing the ship at minimum cost, and the pilot is paying insurance cost for the hull, the alliance will get a substantial profit on some ship losses.  Player only having to cover modules and insurance would be quite a bonus, as well.
---
Of course this wouldn't compete with some large-scale alliance SRP programs, but the majority of alliances aren't on that scale to begin with and have no SRP programs.  This would be a method easily offered by alliances wanting to attract more pvp pilots to try and bolster their numbers.  Not everyone wants to join a massive coalition.  Not everyone wants to slant the game to one big side so there is no one to fight anymore.

They make the job way quicker and much more enjoyable than using a VNI... That shit is incredible boring! --"

For a good pvp experience look into small gang level pvp, the smaller scale lets you try other roles.

I'd like to see you manage this system in your spare time a 10,000 man alliance. Then we'll see how long you last playing "space bureaucracy" before you burn out and agree with the model all major alliances use.

If only there could be a way to let people create folders and arrange icons. Then maybe even a way to share your layout with others.

Anyone now if ccp plans on doing a sub sale soon?
---
why
---
ratting in a single VNI is garbage. You're better off training into a pirate battleship (Read: Rattlesnake) and running DED sites, it's a lot less monotonous than spinning a haven.
---
You can also make a lot more money by following around carriers and supercarriers and salvaging their wrecks. Salvage is good money and you'll make more than a single VNI.
---
I'm not even I'm bastion but what has darwinism done lately besides suck in khanid...
---
Ratting in a VNI is chill/boring regardless of how many SP you have.   You can certainly rat in different ships but there’s a reason why virtually everyone uses VNI these days.  If you lose one you’re not out a ton of ISK, and ratting in VNIs scales well (multi boxing).  
---
I’ve found the best way to deal with ratting is to treat it as a daily chore.  Have a set number of sites in mind to do, so them, and go onto other fun things.
---
its taking ccp years to work out capitals and structures now it will take them years again  to work out 64 bit..  i cant wait..

In case anyone was wondering, these are the icons you start with on the Neocom when you create a fresh character [https://imgur.com/uAqEO4b](https://imgur.com/uAqEO4b).

I started playing Eve in 2006, anyone saying that Eve as it is now is not pay to win is lying to you and to themselves. Skill injectors and Plex are literally pay to win.
---
On the test server at the moment you can still re-arrange and drag icons from the expanded menu onto the Neocom sidebar. You can also still create button groups (which is probably only relevant to the 5 people in game who know it's a feature).
---
Those are still 2 x T2

ya i posted that before I read your edit.

you're right about meta webs

You can have a titan from day 1 and still not know how to use it. There is no pay to win

I prefer monochrome icons too.

No, I think the only people who give a shit about wormholes are people who live in wormholes. They did a cool thing and had a good time. Let it go.

Can any of the amarr battleships do this? and do you have a fitting by chance? Fittings are something im still working to understand fully

In my years, EVE is  one of the few games where you get to know a lot of people by name.  Friends, guildies, ans big time baddies, sure, but also random roamers, cloaky campers, your average dude.

Man i typed out this huge thing for you going over the data points you'd want and how you'd like to keep the work load on your processor guy low and keep most of the work on the pilots end as far as data goes, but I got big fuckin meaty hands and i somehow leaned into the control key with a hand and deleted it all.

Fuck it.
---
500m for a max 2 day temp base is quite a luxury though, especially if you only live in a C2, C2 with C2 static will always have another LS static.

He and the people who fly with him like the monochrome. My and my crew like the monochrome. Comparing the two, the coloured neocom is busy, distracting, and dated while the monochrome isn't. Opinions differ for different people.

Undefended structures in C2 just sounds like a huge loot box. It's only a time matter of its destruction no matter how you timezone tank it. Think about this, you only need one or two afk tristan to kill it.

If you don't have anything big to store, consider a weitu or yurt. If you do... well, then you either defend it or consider not put them inside the wormhole.

That would be the lay person's response.  A corporate executive would say "well, this product has run it's course, let's sell out our surplus and move on."

There’s plenty of places where EVE is about combat rather than politics or mining. With such an in-depth system of fitting ships, there’s dozens or even hundreds of unique ways to fit and fly the same ship in different situations. If you want to focus on the more mechanical aspects of combat rather than the strategy and logistics you just do small-gang PvP, where there’s less room for error on an individual level. Join RvB. ;)

Most T1 Battleships will get the job done, Amarr or not!

The Abaddon is quite famous for cleaning null anomalies with good times, I believe they get around 15M+ isk ticks, depending of your skills.

If you can, the suggestion the dude gave you with a missele geddon with sentries is also quite a good pick to get the isk flowing lol

Regarding the fitting to do it, just ask in the alliance chat for a good build to clean the anomalies, someone will sure send one your way o/

---
I'd like to see that, as well, as I've already stated it's not better than current SRP uses in large-scale alliances or coalitions.
---
Aside from that, with a little automation, it is technically easier to process than a standard SRP.  We were doing this with wallet apis back in 2010 and just outputting everything to spreadsheets, and a google docs form for ship requests.  Check one sheet, check the other sheet, deliver ship.  Took about a minute per.
---
Ratting in general is so boring. Don't do it

Oh shit eve really is dying /s

Do it. Is the name Grumpy Old Bastards taken?
---
Don't know how it's handled now, but back around 2010 we used to process these as wallet apis to track the reimbursement to the corp with a specific comment.  That would just go to a sheet with the amount.
---
Then a google docs form for ship request.
---
Then a google docs sheet to track ships provisioned.
---
When a request came in, check the provision, then check to see if it was reimbursed, then deliver ship.  Realistically, it took about 1 minute per request if the ship was at station.

May I know why you need a clone bay?
---
You can't jumpclone into your wh citadel if you are outside the wormhole system. Only thing a clone bay in jspace do is allowing you to switch pod inside the citadel.
---
If you want to experience wh life, especially if you really decided to play solo, I suggest to start with NPC stations in Thera. There you can store your stuff. It's easy to access, and you can roam around all kinds of wh systems without too high of risks.
---
Having a Titan day one is pay to win. People with your mentality have be diluting gaming for the last decade. This type of gaming is the cancer that is rotting the gaming industry from the inside.
---
to switch pods inside a citadel
---
And i'll be in npc null most likely, so not too bad
---
I was half considering escalations as daytrips, but hardly seems worth the risk
---
Yea, the more requests you get the more you'll want the system automated.  I deal with ours by hand right now and I've still got a sorter who checks all the mails first.  Thats for 30 people.
---
800 people must at least, just sayin
---
Definitely gonna miss the jspace loot pinatas, but I probably won't be back till ccp revamps jspace
---
Honestly the class of hole isn't the problem you need to hole control during the anchor timer regardless of hole class, that means you have to do the boring job of holding down the hole or have a batphone that can content hostiles. 
---
Keep in mind even if you have like 30 accounts, if somebody wants to pop it your structure is gone ( it really not that hard to pop a structure ) now most wormhole groups won't bother with a random structure in a random ass hole. 
---
&gt; now most wormhole groups won't bother with a random structure in a random ass hole.
---
Yeah, that's what I'm counting on. 
---
Just move back into hisec, check the bound assets as business expenses on which you can't return that quickly (asset safety them out if you really want them back). Or firesell them on contracts.
---
Maybe a local corp would let you join, in that case it'd be a win-win situation.
---
0/10 spin try harder
---
I'm sorry if you feel that way, I am just providing suggestions, and of course you can always play the way you like.
---
It's just that since this is a MULTIPLAYER sandbox game thus meta (sadly) is a thing. There are certain ways of playing can provide quite painful experience, and tbh, I hope there's more people play this game than less.
---
Either way, happy hunting, good luck on your discovery.
---
Do you work at CCP? You're fired.
---
it shows people who have it open
---
544 ppl for an astra? any story beside the killmail to make that make sense?
---
grr this gon speaks the truth
---
CCP 2015: We're nerfing Z142s and N432s life time and spawn rate due to fury road and the force projection from scanning wormhole chains.
---
CCP 2018: We're introducing Jump Bridges 2.0 with zero fatigue WOOOOooOoOoooOoOOooOooo.
---
in general VNI is the best bang for your isk value
---
upgrading it would go rattlesnake, or carriers.
---
or, if you want better isk income(rivaling to a bit lower than carriers),  i'd suggest highsec incursions with groups like Warp to Me.
---
skillu/scourge had a max form CTA, formed 200 nightmares, and stood down 
---
Welp, guess we can go a few more months without balance if we get some good skins. Sorry guys.
---
Yeah sure ok chief.

I guess these are all dead now but could be good stories:

GIGX and the Judge, 
---
GIGX and sort dragon
---
GIGX and CCP
---
true
---
rent a utility van and a warehouse
---
 shanghai them blindfolded to the warehouse
---
remove blindfold and tape their eyes open to watch your rorq alts
---
 u watch netflix in the other room and make sandwiches 
---
use an ostrich feather to tickle torture them into obedience
---
So just mr_eti?
---
While I don't disagree with your message, most players probably use the market icon in the sidebar rather than the Neocom to access the market, which is why CCP's engagement metrics are low. 
---
and theres a massive war going on or something too.
---
I got kicked from discord

Alright moving onto the next small gang complaint. Titans vs 10 man gang of subcaps.

What if Elon makes anime catgirls and EVE real at the same time.
---
Hmmm some of my homies in MCAV like to evict people as a form of PVE under the right circumstances .  Might I ask what were your C2 statics? HONESTLY C5 space is so dead I’d recommend setting up there. You can roll in a single pass of a carrier so like. You can roll easy peasy. In a C1 your best source of income is PI FYI. You can make several bil a month. If you can fly a carrier just live in a quiet C5. Its the most pleantiful space and there are a lot of open vanillas. 
---
If you don’t want that to be you:(in order of importance)
---
- Keep yo shit full of fucking fuel.
---
- Fit your shit well
---
- moon lock all the moons with a tower so invaders cant just anchor one.
---
- Become a scanning machine. 
---
- Anchor on the far side of the system
---
- Know when people are in your chain and know what to do when they are.
---
- Learn to fly an Orthrus really well. Fight with smaller groups. Talk to them after and be nice. Same with bigger ones. People are people. But kill them joyfully if you can
---
- Highly recommend an alt for sabreing and killing scanners.
---
- Roll constantly, and randomly  (this will give you the hail merry roll out anyone scope you out.
---
- always have a K-Space 
---
A second account would help you so much. Ideally you’d be in a C5 with a max scanner alt, you in your carrier, you both do PI. Scan the chain down ASAP, roll when you can’t keep eyes on your static And don’t warp to it so it doesn’t spawn. But scan down the nearest K-space incase you get poded. The carrier can roll in one pass so its a QOL thing found in C5’s. Which are plentiful and mostly empty. C1-C4s take forever to roll and you risk more time which can lear to you dying and getting poded when you do so. So idk. If I were to go solo it’d be in high class space.
---
Good luck. You’re probably gonna die a lot. But having kills means your active and people will be less likely to recycle your hole. 
---
Tl;DR. Pretend like you’re extra active and don’t put up bling. 
---
Who cares, its obvious they want to make it easy to be found, and thats fair enough. Also they dont really fit the other categories, and in principle I do agree that categories make it easier to identify what you are looking for. Having them not stored in some categorie they barely fit in anyway adds to not clicking on them by accident. 
---
What is this skin, I need it.
---
who is BSC?
---
It's easily the best of te t1 destroyers for sniping. Super easy to have a 100km effective range.
---
Renters. They just left TRI and are moving to PanFam. First Venal, then Cobalt Edge. In case you feel like giving them a warm welcome.
---
Whoa, that 5% override isnt ok :/
---
🤷‍♂️ if i were you id just find a dead system with a C5 or C6 hole near your 0.0 home. cyno in, roll all the holes but your Entrence krab to your hearts content. If anyone rolls in just jump back out the 0.0 and roll it away.
---
Lol not over 2 bill on cargo wtf is this??? 
---
I've never seen price gouging at this level before.
---
FYI on full spool you punch about 450+ dps with Meson at 50km, not something to scoff at for sure!
---
o7 hey man, ignore the haters, welcome to wh space!
---
You haven't really said what you want to accomplish here, so won't go into that aspect of what hole to choose. That being said, id recommend looking at rolling mechanics as a fsctor when choosing your hole. If you want to defend the timer you're going to want to.practice hole control basically for 24 hours if possible, but absolutely during the hour of the actual timers.
---
You can't roll a C1 wh with battleships, the largest ship you can fit there I'd a bc, and you can't highs rig it, you just gotta rely on the oversize prop trick or do it with a rolling hic. If youre  doing it with a hic you cant activate your "make me tiny" modulea in lowsec or hs, so if you have one of those as a static or dynamic you have to do the bc.
---
Again, don't know your goals, but from a purely hole control perspective a c3 might be a bit better, with a static low or null. Static high (d845) has 5 bil mass, they're huge, but a k346 or u210 has 3 bil. Usually that's 4 passes out hot with higgs battleships, 3 battleships back in hot, crit it with an oversized prop higgs maller or hic, then close with 4th battleship.
---
Dunno how many accounts you play, but that might be better than the c1, dunno.
---
Feel free to message me here or ingame, Hoss Fever is me, if you have more questions :)
---
The engagement profile is what matters, not the actual module of the weapon. 
---
Those profiles are close enough you should not care.

Especially that puff of smoke on the laser, it's just perfect.

Exploration is a cheapish and great way to make isk while developing an understanding of how regions work. Salvaging is also a good way to go. I would recommend looking into that.

How would you distribute someone that has zero skill though?

i really couldnt care less, i was just curious who these dudes were.

---
Yeah u/stainguy, what that guy said
---
Sigh. Nice propaganda I guess.
---
1. Ventures are not 3.1M. Not sure what gave you that idea at all, considering how many free ventures we hand out. But cool story.
---
2. Not sure what "going rate" you're inventing here, but the rate is on-par or better than contending services to/from Jita in the area we're in
---
3. The 5% is of the collateral
---
4. The 2B limit is to encourage smaller contracts. They can make 100 2B collateral contracts if they want.
---
5. There's no minimum size in m3 or ISK.
---
6. Tired of belaboring this point, but BSC aren't renters.
---

Literally every phrase in this contains significant inaccuracies.
---
You're pretty bad at spying, but thanks for playing EVE!
---
I've played this game for 10 years and I'm legally blind.  I learn things like the neocom by their placement--color helps but, you know...--and this kind of change really fucks me.  It will take me weeks and several very literal headaches to get this shit sorted again.  I may lose a ship or two, or miss out on a kill or on a fleet.  I have a very heavily customized overview for this very reason, but through all of these changes to the neocom they haven't offered anything near the flexibility they give you in overview tabs.
---
I feel the need to post this not to complain about me and do a whole boo hoo thing but just to illustrate that for some of us these "fuck you buy plex" cosmetic changes really do affect our playability on a much more important level than being annoyingly greedy.  I'll make it work and this is probably the only time I'll complain about it too, but I'm going to lose even more patience with this fucking company.
---
I think YOU'RE misunderstanding the rule. The rule is pretty plainly there to (try to) keep players, especially newer players, from setting themselves back so far that they end up hopelessly depressed and quit the game because they lost a ship too expensive for them to be ok losing.
---
OP is on the brink of quitting because of how much he lost. He had it in his hold, he continued to explore, he lost it. If wanting to quit because you kept flying something that is that significant to you isn't a good lesson in "don't fly what you can't afford to lose," then I don't know what is.
---
If the OP had gotten a windfall and then immediately headed to the nearest safe spot to deposit his loot and STILL gotten killed, then I'd agree that the #1 rule doesn't apply and just tell him to shake it off, Eve can be harsh. But since his choice to continue onwards instead of immediately turning back seems to have contributed to the loss, I think the #1 rule is appropriate to bring up.
---
Oh shit!
---
For real tho, I'm more in the "EVE will never die" camp.  It will just survive in spite of CCP rather than because of them.
---
"Dated?"  That's the problem; yes, monochrome may look more "futuristic" but it is worse from a usability point of view, which is the entire point of a UI.  The human brain generally recognizes colors before it does minor icon shape differences; even after you get used to them, monochrome still reduces recognition speed.  Most companies tried the monochrome icon trend a few years ago, but most have gone back to color.  There's a good reason for that. 
---
Sad but true - if you are not multiboxing then VNI ratting is your best option, period.
---
Hate to break it to you, but you already had it
---
I get that the way the inventory system works is apart of the trade system in eve, but there has to be a way to provide customers with a convenient way to go "bankrupt" or mass liquidate their stuff after long breaks or what you end up with is a bunch of would be return customers coming back to clean up a mess they never wanted to clean up in the first place.... and actually this inventory system leading to a giant chore to manage might have been one of the larger contributing factors to why they left.  no one has ever been able to come up with a compromise for this problem... the only thing resembling one would be asset management, but the convenience of having your items teleported to a safe location some how has been made into an even bigger chore than it needs to be thanks to the brilliant minds at ccp and this highly flawed new system. 
---
did these guys never hear of pushX or something
---
You got proof of the 80% buyback?
---
That's shitty if true, but I want proof
---
WTB proof
---
You didn't make enough in that time and those amount of hours to PLEX?
---
He'll get other people to PvP for him and then declare himself a genius PvPer
---
...What proof are you expecting from me? The burden of proof is on the person making the accusation. A screenshot of a bulletin section isn't an explanation.
---
That would be racist towards colorblind people. Racism in current year wtf.
---
(Situationally)
---
Too many transactions.  Too much space paperwork.  Reimburse from a simple table for cheap stuff, using cost minus platinum net payout as a reference.  
---
So your plan is to do universal SRP, but each member of your corp/alliance is only allowed to have 1 ship at a time through this program? I don't think people would appreciate that tbh
---
It's not 80%, it's a sliding payout on post-process materials based on their value. Our miners make more than most corps will offer.
---
This conveniently leaves out all the details about what corp members get, all the things they don't have to do or worry about, etc.
---
It's all good. Propagandists gonna propaganda.
---
Means they're moving the freight overland with freighters. The 2b restriction is to reduce the chance they'll be ganked. Basically, they're idiots.
---
I'm a week late, but I just heard about this so the advert point guise made is right. Also, Cyclo's post here should tell you that it's a good enough event that people loved it!
---
I have screenshots. Your alliance leader is dumb enough to talk about this stuff in corp-wide mails.  
---
And I'm not spying, I came across this stuff casually, that's how bad your opsec is.
---
Nice damage control module
---
Ventures are 2.1m, I mistyped.
---
For going rate, I'm comparing it to Pandemic Horde, The Initiative, and Goonswarm Federation. To my knowledge, though, 300-500/m3 + 1-2% is the normal range, 1300 + 5% is absurdly high.
---
Our event happened to be in a wormhole, doesn't mean we care about them.
---
Or maybe we are planning our next invasion in 3,2,1......
---
PushX doesn't ship from our home system to Jita, or vice versa.
---
Our members know about many options, including PushX, Black Frog, and some others.
---
If you've got some trusted, high reputation service that significantly differs from this price, I'm more than happy to take a look.
---
Considering how thin the margins are in the current setup, I'll be genuinely surprised if you find one.
---
Incidentally, Black Frog = ~2100 ISK/m3 for this same run.
---
But no, this is a terrible rip off and we're fleecing members left and right.
---
Especially all the ones we take a literal direct loss on from giving them discounts/free shipping if they're newbros hard up on ISK... the same ones we also give other kinds of assistance to.
---
Don't believe EVE propagandists.
---
Yep, you got us. We ride T1 freighters all the way though null to low to hisec. We tried using convoys of Iterons first, but this new system is so much better!
---
Nice, can we have scans of their fleet? Really wanna see if some of my old buddies managed to get the SP to get in those sweet Nightmares.
---
Lmao propaganda? You're on the other side of the map from where I live, and nobody cares about Theran because you're not relevant.  
---
However, I think a CEO scamming his members with absurdly high service prices and low payout schemes is pretty scummy and I think individuals should know about it when choosing whom to join.
---
what is the geddon? I cant find it by searching that in game :X
---
Except you got several details wrong. But cool story, etc.
---
If I got them wrong, then your Roxxen is lying in his corp mails, because that's my source.
---
300-500m3 + 1-2% for 40+ LY?
---
Ventures are not 2.1M either. Keep trying!
---
Do they pull these out ideas of a hat or do people actually bitch about this stuff?
---
It means doing the highsec leg via gates in a freighter, you numpty.
---
You put in the effort of finding a hole and hauling in a structure, but not to do basic housekeeping so you can anchor it? Your priorities need reassessment.
---
isthar , then  carrier, then  super lol 
---
Pushx does offer a sov service if you talk to them. 
---
Maybe you can't read. Who knows why you can't get simple details right, but gl fly safe etc.
---
\&gt; Ventures are not 2.1m either  
---
Lying when I quite obviously have a source is really dumb.

Hi, please post some proof that I'm wrong about a program I helped institute. Thanks!
---
It's not that monochrome looks futuristic, it's that the coloured neocom looks jarring and distracting compared the the rest of the interface. If the colours were subtler it would fit right in, modern and usable for people who want the colour.
---
 I'm fine with the monochrome, I just removed the buttons I didn't use and moved the rest so that similar buttons weren't next to each other. The rest of the guys I fly with did the same and don't click the wrong button, or at least don't mention in comms that they have. 
---
Maybe I'm just weird, but the coloured neocom is ugly and distracting, while monochrome looks better and works just as well.
---
Ooooh, those ventures. I don't feel a need to go into too much detail about why those contracts are there but:
---
1. Those are fitted (not the important part, but yeah)
---
2. We hand out ventures to newbros for free (yes, fitted) frequently/most of the time
---
3. If you're genuinely concerned about the ethics or principles of BSC, you could always have your alt just ask some questions. We're happy to talk to you anytime!
---
Tenal instead of Venal.  
---
But fine, I wasn't going to post this stuff but now I want to be quite clear.

I’ll second ProtonVPN 
---
Don't lie you bought an abibas one
---
Not to our system, except for one-offs that are obscenely priced compared to what we offer.
---
Well you're either idiots or you're con artists so I mean do you really want to correct this guy?
---
You didn't answer my more important question, so let's try again:
---
300-500m3 + 1-2% for 40+ light years traveled? This isn't a local freight price.
---
It's really not that bad.
---
I'll give you that it's farther away from Jita than some of the examples I listed, but Goonswarm's a comparable distance I believe, and they don't charge nearly as much.
---
3- It literally says Add the 5% (of shippment value) to the reward, it's simply a tax to add to the 1300ISK/M3
---
6-  "BSC aren't renters. " yet\*
---
If you are going to spy on another corporation, at least post something interesting. This is a lame post of a bulletin board, that doesn't back up any of this slander..  
---
I am fairly sure that most people in the Jump Freighter Service, can figure out for themselves whether this is a good deal or not..
---
You absolute idiot. Your ignorance is astounding 
---
wow now
---
lol the damage control from BSC in here
---
How hard can it be to admit that they are better than you?
---
As usual ,no one asked for this....
---
Microgangs
---
Where do BSC live? 1300isk/m3 isn't unheard of if they live in bumfuck nowhere.
---
I've seen 2000isk/m3 before because tenerifis was bumfuck nowhere. It was like 6 mids or something stupid like that.
---
winterco mercenaries??
---
Another thing to keep in mind here. A very large chunk of this corp are players less than 2 months old 
---
Guess what the collateral is set to by default? The in-game estimation of the value of what you're shipping. Guess what we encourage people to set collateral to? Whatever ISK makes up for losing the shipment should it be lost.
---
They can pick 0 if they want, but I wouldn't.
---
Sure, we might end up renters or wiped off the face of New Eden one day. But that day isn't today.
---
You know your eve mails have a watermark that can be traced to auth, right?
---
thanks 4 the isk :wave:
---
Hugely overpriced. Most in-house shipping that I've ever seen charges under 2% of collateral
---
Almost every alliance worth its salt has a significantly cheaper freight service.
---
uh.  1350 isn't punitive.  1350 is the "going rate", effectively.  It's just that the JFs are so frequently having to make the 750isk/m3 leg of the trip empty, they're incentivizing people to give them anything so that the return trip isn't a waste.

This shit is Hilarious. I wonder what Hedliner would say about these nerds xD
---
Reasonable ideas, I find the concept of time zone tanking particularly hilarious, though I am pretty new.
---
I do want to put forth though that it seems that these opinions come from a veteran’s perspective; don’t forget about the newbros!
---
Those without a high tolerance for risk need to be trained to accept risk; such is a major point of nullsec newbro corps i.e Pandemic Horde, BRAVE, and Karmafleet.
---
For example, asset safety was an early personal concern.  Its removal would have tied me to a highsec NPC station, never to enter nullsec.
---
Having the game the way you like is good, but it’s daunting as is for new guys.  In the light of future changes, let’s keep (early) accessibility a priority .

If I were you and was going to write this kind of documentary I'd be looking going to Eve Vegas. It's in October every year.
---
Last year was the first year I went to it and meet up with over a dozen people from my Alliance. Some of them I've played with for years.
---
Goon is a shorter distance, but it's close enough.
---
Do you have any idea how big/wealthy Goons are? They can do literally everything cheaper than BSC. It wouldn't surprise me if it's 1350 with no collateral charge. If we get to the point that such a price can work without the JF pilot literally paying to JF, that'll happen.
---
Until then, for how bleeping far we are from Jita, the 0% tax, and all the other great stuff we do for members, you're just making an ass of yourself.
---
I want to see more Minmatar tatoos and complaints about super proliferation now. Are we done here?
---
No announcement yet.

So far, the only change was to up the reprocessing yield of the moon mining &amp; reactions parts so that you can get back all the minerals that were put in.

How else are you supposed to move large amounts of stuff in highsec? I guess you can break it down and use DSTs if you don't need all the cargo space.
---
They cannot afford to buy multiple contracts at 2bil. They are new so they don't have hundreds of billions of isk lying around. 
---
Oh that makes sense. So you incentivize for a run that's usually empty, so at least it's something.
---
We thought about something like that. I've been debating whether that's too complicated for being worth it, but this has me rethinking it.
---
How many LY are your runs, btw? Just trying to get a feel. Also, does your alliance comp or share the cyno alts? NP if that's a little too OpSec to talk about; I'm just always interested in how others do things.
---
&gt; CCP have got some sort of leverage over him
---
no shit he works for them
---
what kind of brainlet nonsense is this
---
Nice!
---
Not me evemails
---
Good try.
---
You realize evading bans like this is very much prohibited on le reddit? 
---
To be fair to /u/Hehaw5, Falcon is pretty hard-core when it comes to defending CCP. We've seen him happily defend some pretty indefensible things (the Fanfest giveaways of the CONCORD ships comes to mind, for instance).
---
1300isk/m3 is pretty in-line with Imperium services Delve -&gt; Jita.  80% ore buyback seems low, but not _insane_.  I think most of our services are 89%.
---
&gt; You know your eve mails have a watermark that can be traced to auth, right?
---
no they don't
---
That was my first thought too
---
 This shit is Hilarious. I wonder what Hedliner would say about these nerds xD 
---
Get outta here with your reason and logic.
---
So let's pretend you're a newbro corp who is way, way, way smaller than Goons, etc.
---
Let's pretend you have some vets, but you're not bling city, and some people who are really eager to help and have the setup to do it, but high collateral is a problem for them, because they're still getting established.
---
Wouldn't it be rad if they could learn some stuff and help out without having to float big collateral?
---
If someone wants 100B collateral, they know they can just ask. Exceptions can be/are provided.
---
depends on where they live. prices of jf services usually vary by amount of mids required, and therefore the amount of fuel consumed
---
the shallow north (cloud ring, tribute, pure blind, vale) is the cheapest, usually one mid if that. the southeast and drone regions could have you running 6-7+ mids to and from jita, which is significantly more expensive. the fuel cost *one way* from jita to detorid is over 100mil, for instance
---
Thats what i said, Adidas. Is good tracksuit.
---
I've provided proof of the 80% Jita Buy Buyback, the 2.1m ISK venture (3.1 was typo) and the JF service. Those are all the claims I made
---
I don't ever use ore buyback, but 80% doesn't sound completely unreasonable to me.
---
WHERE'S MY PITCHFORK
---
roxxen is a fuckface.
---
last night in the meeting i was hinting so badly that i had been awoxing like crazy and he couldnt catch on.
---
"so what happens if a new player joins and mans the fort to shoot blues like the last few times"
---
roxxen: well those were recruited by junior directors but they where toons that coulda been caught by any one with eyes 
---
(baring in mind he recruited 3 of my characters, 2 of which were blatent cyno alts...)
---
"yeah but what if i said they were all recruited by roxxen"
---
*crickets*
---
roxxen changes topic
---
   
---
BSC dudes would do well to just leave that idiot and find somewhere else good to go. Join brave or horde or something.
---
80% buyback, pretty standard across most entiretys . 2.1m fitted ventures depending on fit looks about right. 1300isk per m3 to tenal, yep looks about fair. 5% of collateral maybe little high but that is the only really "gouging" if there not putting up collateral. was hoping for spicy dank leaks of shit leadership but this post is not that unfortunately. 
---
What are they going to do, *ban me*?
---
Tenal instead of Venal.
---
But fine, I wasn't going to post this stuff but now I want to be quite clear.

Yeah I'm not really a fan either. Might get a Swiss Army knife tengu for quick scanning and ratting
---
 Another thing to keep in mind here. A very large chunk of this corp are players less than 2 months old
---
Please stop sending me these terminally stupid replies, thanks. :-)
---
Plugging the route from 1DQ1-A into dotlan is going to be as good as I could give you, as I never took my JF out of null aside from when we were kicked out of the north and have no desire to do alliance logistics.  I couldn't (and wouldn't) even say what lowsec they end up in, but it shouldn't be hard to pick one to get an idea.
---
That said, our services are privately run, not alliance run, so the alliance isn't comping anything.  How the individual services handle that sort of thing, I don't know for sure, but I think it's generally assumed that you work that out yourself and fund them with the cash you're making.
---
Oooooorrrrr...
---
&gt;Sure, we might end up renters or wiped off the face of New Eden one day. But that day isn't today.
---
Your own material, I believe it was your alliance description, you refer to yourselves as renters.
---
Only earlyish content alphas don't have access to is mining barges lol
---
Yeah, especially if they're in bumfuck nowhere where shipping is gonna be a factor.
---
Hope my edit clears up what I was saying.
---
Why is every new update always so underwhelming? It's such a contrast with a studio like Grinding Gear Games who always manages to over deliver.
---
And who asked for this anyway? Who is it meant to appease? Not the poor new players' cognitive overload bullshit mentioned in the article. If the intention is new player retention there are about a billion other priorities over the fucking neocom.
---
This feels like an update for the sake of an update.
---
I don't know whether you're asking because you're serious about fixing your pricing scheme, or because you want to appear to be fixing your pricing scheme. I posted this because I think you should fix your buyback and JF pricing to be a bit more fair especially considering how young the members of your corp are in their EVE careers so you're essentially stealing candy from children. Something to consider as you move forward and attempt to reinvent yourselves.
---
Can I have your brains? 
---
For PvE there is some stuff you can do, for PvP, not really. There is no new stuff, and in fact, a lot of stuff that was widely and normally available back then has died out, or is pretty close to it which is really unfortunate.
---
1st off the amount of multiboxers and bots in the game skyrocketed while regular playing people have declined. This has a ton of consequences on every aspect of the game.
---
I was kinda looking at FW and reactivated one of my alts for it so I don't have to fuck up my standings, but after spending a couple days through it got really turned off. There are literally no good fights left, if they do happen its so rare that its not funny and they never seem to happen when I play. Add to that the FW bots ... Just a really bad feeling and disappointment. So I let it run out and not reactivating.
---
The small and medium size fights in NS, LS and WHs are no where near as numerous as they were before because of cap proliferation and the shit that came with it. So if you were in a mid size or small group before you're just fucked now. There are very, very few corps left that still do it and I am not interested in joining any of them for reasons of my own. Suffice to say this aspect of the game has completely died for me.
---
Mining is idiotic now with Rorqs and multiboxing, like really, its just so fuckingly stupid its incredible. CCP broke all records for game design stupidity with this one. It is unprecedented. I have lost all faith in them on this front. Likewise with VNI ratting, the multiboxers and the bots really all the same shit damaging the game in same exact ways, only difference is that bots often RMT on top of the damage they cause, so CCP does go after the RMT ones to an extent as that affects their immediate financials more. But they leave the rest pretty much alone.
---
On PvE there is some new stuff, and depending how long ago you left, you may have more stuff to do that was not there before. Latest is Abyss and Triglavian ships. The ships are a ton of fun to actually fly. They aren't exactly best at anything, except the Leshak being highest DPS battleship, they are not ISK optimal for any purpose, but their mechanics are actually fun to play with. So you can try the Abyss and Triglavian ships. Beats the hell outta doing L4s.
---
Other then that hop into a T3C and go WH diving for a few days at a time, its pretty nifty and you never know what you'll run into. Go far, for the 1st day do nothing but literally just go from WH to WH see how far you can end up, then maybe find something to do, up to you.
---
You can also scan down some DED sites and run escalations into LS, especially if you got spare cash / ISK, bring an alt in something like an Arazu with you and you'll end up either running the escalations or baiting at the same time. Either way that is kinda fun.
---
If you can find a good corp, you'll be doing all right, for me, there are no good corps now. They're either to small and scarred to start PvP ing, and rightfully so due to caps, or you end up with the blocks that are the ones causing this issue, and sooner or later in order to "keep up with the Joneses...." you will have to multi Rorq or bot yourself. Its not a question of if, but of when.

How do they intend to conquer CE ? with ventures and shuttles?

Wonder what Hedliner will say when seeing this.
---
Burn Jita
---
The Vexor Navy Issue has much more tank, extra fitting slot, better layout, maybe more PG/CPU I don't remember, and is a full drone ship. Its bonusses are focused on drones instead of being split into drones / guns. So it does a lot better.
---
.
---
Anytime you want to see a difference, jsut bring up your ship tree, right click, select "show info" and check traits. Then you can also check attributes Tab, then bring it up in the fitting simulator. The differences will show up there as well.

Why did you offline your shield extender in the Slicer fight? I'm watching without sound at work, so sorry if you explained it in the video.
---
The Goon Delve--&gt;Jita is 1350, but they don't charge \*a flat 5% of the entire worth of the shipment\* on top of that. I don't think you realize how absurd that is.
---
ugh, your shit gave me 80s flashbacks ...
---
It's 80% Jita Buy, which means it's basically 60% of Jita Sell.
---
Oh, the 2B isn't for ore. It's for shipping stuff to/from Jita. Just max 2B collateral per package. However many packages they want. Dig?
---
What's wrong with the 80s? :( :( :(
---
Where do i sign up?

---
How is it pay to win when you are gonna loose it the second you use it the first time?
---
There is no op ship that lets you kill Everything. You can plex yourself a nice blingy 1b isk orthrus and feed it to the first gate camp you come across.
---
Player skill matters. Very significantly.
---
In hindsight I suppose you are right, the rule is fair enough to bring up here given the context. I've just always had it as a rule to never undock with something you cannot afford to lose, but it does make sense that if the cargo you have acquired is very valuable to you, you should minimise your exposure and get it safe. I still somewhat disagree with the notion that you cannot afford to lose the cargo, but overall I think you're right to bring up the rule for a player who just lost something that couldve been a great boost to their gameplay.
---
Yeah, this is at the top level of alliance FCing; for an average line FC, you put a fleet on your alliance's timer board and run it when you want to run it.

What if it's just a Chinese sweat shop operation?, Le human bots.

You can go for running ded sites. Some sites don't require more than a gila and the rest can be dun in a t3c like a tengu. If you are in guristas lands let me know and i'll send a few fits your way. As for the other races google or a more experienced person from your alliance is your best bet.
---
sounds like you could start a nice little service instead of crying
---
I've never seen someone so consistently downvoted for their shit posting.   Special, I guess.  
---
Like I said, it's not completely out of line with our services, and we obviously have a much much more competitive market in place.  The only thing you've listed that really sounds iffy is the 5%.
---
You're* also this guy just waiting for his moment to shine  ^^^
---
fuck off u moron no one actually gives a shit
---
1300/m3 isn't crazy going to Cobalt's Edge. If it was Pandemic Horde, which is a much larger alliance and with Geminate bordering The Forge, that would be insane. For a smaller alliance going to the eastern edge of the map, this isn't terrible. 
---
And yeah, 5% is a decent bit. But again, not insane. If it was 1300/m3 with a 3% rate to Cobalt's Edge being an alliance with 1100 members, I wouldn't even bat an eye, let alone make an r/Eve post about it. Sounds like you're just a little salty for some reason. (I am in no way affiliated with BSC or Theran)
---
Or nothin'. 2b is a magic value. It has a specific meaning. Hell, for all I know you're subcontracting to red frog for the highsec overland. Still idiotic.
---
ttps://evewho.com/corp/Theran+Conglomerate
---
This corroborates the renter arguement. 
---
Your (former) alliance made the initial claim of being an independant sov holding alliance which has since been changed to state you rent. 
---
When this was tested your alliance ran to FRAT to get the meanies to leave you alone, which argueably made things worse. 
---
Dont Hard knocks associates rent out cobalt edge?
---
I mean if it's blingy then it can go past a rev...i've seen a 6bil kronos once...

I've always considered the T2 frigs pretty early content it only takes a slight skills focus to get you there.
---
Ok bro let me ask you a question, I’m a newbie and I’m not familiar with Eve politics, but if an alliance/Corp is shit or irrelevant, why do you bother yourself with bashing, hating and spying on them? Obviously it makes it seem like you have something against them..

---
money on it? How long can you sustain yourself as a f2p before the need to spend money outweighs your freedom/enjoyment as a f2p?
---
great to hear you guys are still rocking it!!!
---
Ah yes, because hating people over the internet is the true mark of an "Alpha" as if that were a desirable thing to be anyway.
---
Did you ever find you got bored or felt limited in terms of what others could do when you were playing as an Alpha? What made you finally decide to spend money?
---
&gt; Has plex really gone up that much? 
---
Yes. Also you need 500 plex now to get 1 month membership and they're priced about 3.4m each at jita. 
---
Would you say the game is more “pay to look like you win” rather than traditional “pay to win”?
---
"what has darwinism done lately"  
---
" drop NC hard late last year"  
---
So nothing is the answer then?
---
Zero evidence given.  Just a shit post.
---
So realistically I couldn’t start playing eve and never feel the need to spend money on it? Like I can play the trial for as long as I want but at some point I’d want to unlock the content that comes with a p2p account 
---
Yeah, I was figuring that T1-non faction ammo was shite but that was clearly a bad assumption.
---
"I just skill injected in to this thing! Watch me boson those bombers!"
---
You're comparing shipping to Tenal with shipping to Geminate and wondering why it's more expensive? Going rate is 300-400/m3/jump. The further you go from Jita, the more it costs.
---
The 5% of collateral is about the only real 'extortion' I see on here. 100m to ship 2b is a bit insane.

Would you be shitposting with 85%? 84%?

Please enlighten us all on the EXACT % of what a fair buy back program is (IN YOUR OPINION, maybe you don't get that part)
---
In that case your goal is recruiting and building a community. You need to promote working together, not individual profit. Though in moderation, full communism is probably not the way to go. In short you want people to feel like they're doing well for themselves *and* the group.

I wouldn't even go that far, very likely just a matter of plain inexperience, overly enthusiastic, not caring if you boson your own fax alt, not caring about reimbursing someone's loss or a combination of all the above.

---
The best way to make money with 0 effort is to stock stuff in nullsec. 
---
For example, I evaced all my stuff to curse after coming back to the game a month ago. I put 30b+ worth of my assets on the market in one of the systems at a ~15% markup and never looked at it again. Sold around half of it in the last month.
---
Well the guy said I didn't back up my 'slander', I wanted it to be clear that I did provide evidence that these statements I made about their pricing schemes are true.
---
you forgot say "Mom, watch me"
---
Ugh no
---
Because this particular corp attracts new players with big promises, and then does this sort of stuff.

Tbh I'd just make public contracts. They get accepted no matter what you put in there
---
I have a highsec alt that I sometimes used for fw. I am goinna help out him out with the epic arc and shit in a malgus. So he can have boosts.
---
Days to complete to 30? wtf
---
I hear ya. He is not a dumb person, but all he has done in the game is create a character. He does not know the mechanics of how to fly his ship and how to navigate the game/ui. Small steps, but yea that is my ultimate goal with him. I just don't want him to become overwhelmed and not stay.
---
Your best off getting a couple hours of ot st work and plexing.   Even 2 hours of min wage gets you 1.6(?) Bil....  hard to top that isk/h
---
Plus when you can play,   you can do fun shit and not sit watching little red dots die... 
---
Uve seen anywhere from 3 days to a week. Just 30 days seems really high. But not my alliance. 
---
1300/m3 to Cobalt Edge? Sounds like a pretty good deal to me...
---
Pls tell roxxen he isnt nearly as smart as he thinks he is, tfw he claims im an aussie lul
---
Someone else in this thread guessed much better than you.
---
Drone control rage is something legacy from back in the day where carriers would often use swarms of heavy drones or sentry drones. The fighter support unit used to be called different and allow you to deploy more drones. 
---
It was fun having 20+ sentries out. 
---
I miss that one. I figured out a system that worked great for me, got a good routine on it... Then they made my freshly aquired skills obsolete... Feels bad man.
---
Well the service I use isn't fleecing me. They vary the per jump price by fuel cost (number of mids), but charge 1% collateral.
---
So bait out their shiny toys and bring your shiny toys to destroy them with
---
Fatality.
---
I think your confused. You used to be abe to make passive isk from moon mining. all that moon goo is what goes into t2 production. That is not the case anymore you have to actually put ships on a belt to get the goo.
---
Is thet Armor Levi?
---
That would depend on what you are trying to do. If you want to just solo pvp or fly with a small gang in nullsec/lowsec you can probably do that indefinitely as an alpha, granted you'll never be more than a T1 cruiser DPS or tackle frig but you'll be useful and if you like the play style its a blast. I spent almost 6 months at one point running around lowsec in a T1 frig solo welping in faction warfare systems and made several hundred million in the LP store as a result.  
---
If you plan on trying to fly the more expensive but stronger T2 ships or the any of the capital or industrial ships you would need to subscribe to use them, but as a new character you are several months away from having the skills to be able to use T2 ships and even longer away from using capitals.   
---
Now you can short cut that waiting period by using skill injectors, but that involves buying PLEX, the currency sold by CCP to sell in game so you can afford to buy skill injectors which allow you to add skill points you can assign to whatever skill you would like without waiting, but this is something that even if you are willing to do I would recommend against doing as you will have no idea how to use what you are flying. Eve is the kind of game you have to learn every time you step up a level. Cruisers don't fly like frigs, battleships don't fly like cruisers, capitals don't fly like anything else in the game etc.  
---
Basically you have nothing to lose from making an alpha account, finding a new guy corp corp and giving the game a try. I would recommend avoiding the soul sucking experience that is high sec though, so many people join the game, start to play in highsec, get bored fast because its not what they saw in the news stories about the game or the cinematic videos released and quit.  There are many lowsec/nullsec groups that will take you in as a newer character. Personally I am biased towards my current corp Ascendance(goons), but there is also karma fleet(goons), and pretty much all the groups in Brave, Test or Horde will take new guys. And then there's Eve university, a corporation setup up just to show people how the game works, who built their own wiki to explain the majority of how eve works. [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main\_Page](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page). In short if you were interested enough to come here and ask you should at least give it a try.
---
no, it's a retarded levi
---
The slander is saying they are fleecing their members. The truth is that they offer 80% buyback on ores, which from my perspective seems reasonable. Selling Ventures for 7x their value would be true, if they were selling them unfitted, which they are not..

Align time; if I fly a frigate with a 2.01s align time, does that mean that 99% of the time it will take 2s to be safely in warp? Conversely, does it mean that 1% of the time it will take 3s to be safely in warp?

Y'know I don't even care that this statement is unequivocally false, I am happy for you.
---
It's important that human beings strive in life, to devise some kind of method by which they can feel validated and self assured, and I am glad r/eve and it's grrr goon narrative gives that to you.
---
Exactly, you can throw a shit ton of money at any problem in EVE, you always could, officer mods arent new. But the gains a pretty small, but significant IF you are skilled enough to make use of them. If not, you'll end up on zkil in no time and people will be laughing at you.
---
Where does BSC live?
---
450M for a full JF load is not out of the question for some null alliances I have personally seen.  This is also why Eve can't retain or get new members.  The logistics system in this game is amazing, like no other game, but casual players can't keep up.

i have heard from a private source that it also functions as there main diplo chat. 
---
TIL what ghostriding is.
---
If you had honest sincere intents, you could have come to us, or at least been more diplomatic about this post. This is a shitpost.
---
Dig, thanks for the feedback!
---
The mino jumped into the boson
---
I hope Horde lost more than they killed. Just going to assume they're out whaling, so losing less bombers than Rorquals killed would've been a big yikes.
---
This is the kind of Autism that New Eden deserves.

I do that because I'm anti social and just want to do sites quickly before bed

Once you reached that 5 mil cap and you want to train something else or fly something else. But there is no obvious progression in this game. The smallest usable ship class in the game are frigates. They are fast to get into, but they arent inferior to other ships, they just fill a certain role. Mostly hunting and pinning stuff down. There are people who play this game for years and fly little else, because in bigger and smaller fights flying tackle is one of the more interesting jobs and frigate vs frigate pvp is one of the most demanding types of engagements you can get into. So little space for errors. Most people want to progress further, into other roles at some point tho. Thats when you'll want to upgrade.

PL missed a great opportunity to bubble a bunch and have a great battle, goons fielded 3 fucking vanquishers towards those bombers, damn.
---
Which wh Corp?
---
Step 1: Claim booshing bombers are op because init is running around killing everything with them
---
Step 2: copy init
---
Step 3: kill 1 rorq while welping entire fleet
---
Step 4: post on reddit that you killed a rorq
---
Nobody misses you Grath.
---
Incorrect. You speak of *Nullbears*, which are an extremely close relative of the Highsec Carebear. Krab is an umbrella term which catches both Nullbears and Carebears.
---
lol The battle report says Goons lost 8 bill of stuff but Horde only lost 5 b.
---
There are plenty, for that reason I guess. We dont learn, apparently...
---
1. 2b is the mino goons killed themselves
---
2. If your fc actually knew how to fc boosh bombers and made a half decent comp, you guys wouldn’t have lost anything.
---
The Mino was caused in the confusion we caused. We earned it, and we had one bad boosh which screwed us up.
---
:D
---
Don't worry OP i'm pretty sure you'll get a new skin pack in the NES store for just $32.64
---
Test alliance here. 
---
From D-P to jita has a going rate of ~1500isk/m3 with 1% collateral. These things are privately run so people can choose their own prices. 
---
Looking at these prices the JF pilot makes a pretty penny when being near full with ~20B collateral total. ~700m 1 way. For ~130m fuel. 
---
Your price per m3 looks fine. But 5%of collateral seems very high. 
---
There will be 128 bugs to fix in the following patch.
---
I find that the best response is a a scram and a web followed up with Caldari Navy antimatter. 
---
All the issues this game has and you decide to fuck with stuff that was fine the way it was...
---
However you want.  Because freedom.
---
can confirm I have never once clicked the market button in the sidebar and have exclusively used the neocom button since I started playing.
---
How about don't be a thief, ask if you can salvage and maybe you won't get this much hate? Funny how you portray yourself as a victim here lol
---
What is ghost riding?
---
Yeet.
---
I'm in pretty much the same spot. Returned after 4 year break but coming up to 15 year old character.
---
Got back... Saw my T2 Drone salvage hoard was now worth megabucks and PLEXed up til probably the end of time. 
---
However I find myself logging in to dick about on the market a bit, plug in a bunch of new skills and log out again. The interface is horrible! The graphics are much worse, they killed my solo moon mining empire and just seem to have inflated the prices of assets to ludicrous ISK to try (badly) deflating the economy.
---
I am a vet but I'm not bitter - just disappointed. Doubt I will log in much until something drastically changes - feels like there is no reason to fight anymore and everyone is only playing to make ISK with minimal risk. Sad times.
