Yes..Always. 
---
---
---
Guess y'all still haven't learned how to Stan *out*
---
Because a) WHSOC are not a 'small' group these days, and they're semi-competent,
---

---
b) C5 space gets roaming holes where C4 space does not. In other words, in C4 space, you're reliant on your statics or other incoming holes (static, in the case of C2/4/5/6, \_incoming\_ roaming in the case of C1/3). This means you can never get a direct null, high, or low.
---
c) QoL. You can roll a C5 static with one hit in a carrier, and a rolling fit carrier can warp and MWD faster than your average higgs battleship. 
---
d) Capital capability. You can fight heavy armour/heavy shield with FAX/Dreads making for some pretty intense fights. Unless you're TDSIN, in which case that's too scary.
---
So, yeah, there are legit reasons.
---
Brb building 150 caps in their azbel
---
No, there is a very common species known as the Carebear whose sole impulse is to accumulate ISK for the sake of having it. The Carebear is identifiable by its prickly personality and frequent use of the term *ISK/hr*. They gather in herds of individuals each with its head in the sand.
---
What time sink? There's *always* content 
---
TIL, it's a good idea to tell neutrals about my titan/super move op and expect nothing bad to happen.
---
On one hand, DK, I get that and there's sense behind it...
---
On the other hand, HEAVY ARMOUR FIGHTS
---
Nah. I personally dislike their choice of home, but they at least pvp. 
---
i think it's neat :)
---
This was a fun fight. https://zkillboard.com/related/31002437/201903150200/ 
---
Thanks Deathstar for the fight. I was gonna do and Aar, but work, yeah.
---
This may be bait but this is a bad tip.
---
  
---
If you don't live in the space you should not spend extra time cleaning up trash for the locals.
---
When dedicated anti-tackle fits can't be tackled because they can out-range and out-run every kind of tackle, it's gone too far. 
---
savage
---
Is there a way to see when an auction will be over? I know it displays "less than one day" but is there a more precise info?
---
Also all auctions seem to start at 00:00 but if I calculate the x hour countdown, it doesn't add up, they usually are done earlier (no buyout).
---
Kelmac who was the FC on their thought he might be able to work with INIT but didn't have the full picture. I had had no less than 5 conversations telling people the opposite but everyone ignores those now. 
---
Gangs of 5-10 are still more than enough to have small fun fights . 
---
Let's be real. Nobody learned anything today.
---
Why even bother blueing TAPI for it, does INIT not have enough blues to do it for them already?
---
How can goons have fun in fleet when just warping your fleet causes 10% tidi?
---
&gt;DarkWhinesInit
---
Which is why I went on to say, they could just implement the Locking mechanism they have for Station Containers and such.
---
You drop a bunch of random stuff in the container. Right click on certain ones and Lock them. Then if you Ctrl A to drag and drop, it will leave those marked items in place.
---
Being able to mark ammo, bombs, drugs, etc. And being able to drag and drop everything else.
---
Can't warp off when you are already scrammed cough cough
---
yes yes init strong, flex big for your masters, please hurry it up so i can convince the corp  to move to a c2/ns.
---
@everyone ls fit rev for sale out the c140 gonna need someone to go pick it up 
---
You should add this to GitHub or other similar webpage so if you ever go away of the game well someone's could pick it up. 
---
I wish I still had the excitement I had when I started this game
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/75568450/
---
Ummmmmm
---
*losing.  "Loose" means something else.
---
Check further up in the thread where Vily states he planned to kill INIT.  Defending the Keepstar is one thing, planning to attack is another.  The Imperium has an "understanding" with Legacy when it comes to fighting our combined enemies Panfam.  TEST chose to ignore this, and make another enemy.
---
Wait, you think TAPI cares at all about Provi? You guys are nothing but meatshields in your horrible truesec space. You are merely there to keep other groups occupied.
---
Which explains why most wormhole groups only get a few fights a week.
---
“It happened again!”
---
- You installed EVE’s client and you were found flying your maxed out stealth bomber?
---
“YES!!”
---
- And this was not a dream?
---
“NO!”
---
- This was not a ruse by a roommate perchance?
---
“I live alone, there’s nobody else here! Nobody knows I played EVE.”
---
- Maybe you should stop being a pussy and resub?
---
obligatory "you seem salty"
---
Also forgot DECLARE WAR ON EVERYTHING.
---
They were only blue in Vily's mind. They were literally neutral and had no agreement. Vily assumed they were blue because Hy hadn't told them otherwise, which is insane for any group, but especially insane for snuff who literally shoot blues and post "blue is just a color" in local while doing it. 
---
Cracks forming?
---
Fly dangerously. o7
---
Lets be honest, wrecking krew are hackers and that's how they killed Seddows Titan. Local wasn't clear but they hacked it to make it clear. 
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/396986381?t=35m07s
---
Seems like Vily announced his intentions quite some time ago.
---
Perhaps not everyone got the memo.
---
Panfam were around 700
---
Goons only was 1400. I don't how much about init  and snuffed out subcap but they had also the supercap superiority
---
I unsubbed because my Corp dissolved. I had too much money for mining to be fun, and had no more skills to pursue 
---
If my corp told me they wanted to war dec hundreds of corps and pick off stragglers in hi-sec, I'd call them shameless dopes without a spine and leave. 
---
You gotta love all this salt and smarm about TAPI working with panfam against snuff in the context of "TAPI WERE NEUTRAL" when snuff memed their supers.
---
This logic cuts both ways.  ARE TAPI AND SNUFF BLUE RIGHT NOW? If the answer is no pls stop crying about TAPI not working with Snuff.
---
Seems like all they did was confuse their own people and make more enemies in the process.
---
Just you wait kiddo. Next time we bring 8 mil EHP buffer fits
---
GAS GAS GAS!
---
Init plus Snuff had 100+ titans ready so I don’t know what you mean by saying there were not prepared.
---
They were probably afraid finish what they stared it.
---
If the only thing Snuff can do alone without goon umbrella is dropping on poor people in low sec maybe they should  stop rf keepstars and start shoot raitarus in heimatar.
---
Alrighty, sounds legit. Bu did you really wanted to punch cfc in a face? (because if true, it'd be pretty hilarious). 
---
was to be expected...
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
There’s so much stuff to do now, and it’s easier to find than ever.
---
Also, there’s now new ways of mining too.
---
But, you will always find a way to have fun in EVE :-)
---
RIP the jukebox. o7
---
You literally sat on the sendaya gate with your muninns and the entire frat eagle fleet for a solid minute or two before you jumped through together.
---
Not shooting them there and waiting until they started fighting with goons was the FIRST CLUE you had?   yikes
---
So is the Keepstar corp being accepted back into Phew now ?
---
confirming
---
You're welcome and thank you!
---
I appreciate it and I shall. Thanks for the support.
---
Too movie like? Was unsure how to "tell the story". I'm open to suggestions.
---
Short BR from the Novac FC.  
---
Sound and us went in planning to 3rd party on ODIN and TNA. ODIN was dying and extracted as we landed.
---
We engaged, struggled hard with jams and shot things. ODIN blued up and we got a few kills here and there. The hole was rolled.
---
More caps landed and as kill pressure increased we started feeding more and extracted what was left.
---
A few bad calls on my side:
---
Many of the buffer caps could have been killed earlier on.
---
The biggest mistake was engaging into a regen-apostle without the required neut pressure. Regen apostles are pretty simple in when you bring x bhaals you just win, but before that they have no problem with facetanking. The few we had died and the hole was gone.
---
Could have dealt with the scorpions better than we did.
---
Extraction was a bit late, but its hard to leave when there is so much isk on grid that might be killed.
---
It's been a week of feed for us, but also a week of fights. W-space lives another day.
---
Glad to see more people fielding competitive numbers. We hope to engage them again soon!
---
What I mean is, there is nothing keeping you from hanging out with members from other corps.  I have friends in many corps in GSF, that is the great thing about sigs and squads, you are not tied down to just a small group of people in a corp.
---
brown bears are the highsec version of grizzly bears. clearly they aren’t important.
---
That I am :) I plan on it too. Thanks for the support!
---
Panfam &lt;3 Glad I converted you to the light.
---
I can fly pretty much all the WH doctrines. Maybe you could sum up what each of the big groups does and how they live?
---
I wish I could enjoy wormholes but I despised living in them, and I gave it a fair shake. Good on you guys for having fun in there but it is definitely not for everyone.
---
I definitely plan on it. I appreciate it.
---
In his own words. This is from right when r10t had joined PL after we'd bee fighting them a week in lowsec prior to evicting them....
---
\[17:36\] Sgeine(Jesse): "relentless terrorism" lol
---
\[17:37\] Sgeine(Jesse): they've been trying to evict dark taboo for a month
---
\[17:37\] Sgeine(Jesse): and have managed to get endlessly shit on by snuffed out to the point where they're too afraid to even shoot a structure
---
\[17:37\] Sgeine(Jesse): they destroy 1 low power structure in 4+ weeks lol
---
\[17:37\] Sgeine(Jesse): sad, meanwhile, they can't even defend their own structure which is now in hull immediately after achoring it
---
\[17:37\] Sgeine(Jesse):
---
\[17:37\] Sgeine(Jesse): lolol
---
\[23:17\] Hedliner: Not really interested in your views on my alliance or its recruitment choices
---
\[23:18\] Sgeine(Jesse): :rolling\_eyes:
---
\[23:18\] Hedliner: No disrespect to you
---
\[23:18\] Sgeine(Jesse): nor am i in yours of mine :wink:
---
\[23:18\] Hedliner: But I make my decisions for a reason
---
Horde definitely deserved a special shout out. They've been doing great.
---
not for now.
---
&gt;More than willing to share my knowledge and experience of EVE.
---
Then go for EVE University. They have moon mining operations in Gallente space, campuses in other places (in case you want to jump again in null/wh without making a commitment) and a decent industrial base. Most of the time boosts are on, the people are interested in learning/teaching and it's an unaligned corp with pretty chill people. Hell, you might even jump into a noob fleet and reignite your love for pew! The corp expects people to move on after a while, so leaving will not be a problem if you find a new interest/corp.
---
At peak there were over 2400
---
You sure love fallacious statements, don't you?
---
And they are going home, apparently they had nothing to do so far...
---
I've learned that INIT are actually worse posters than the dinoposters.
---
I have been considering this. If I release the source code, I'll post an update here and ping you personally.
---
I for one thought 'Puffed Out' was a great holder corp name in preparation for the fight
---
"wE rOllEd 4 1 yEaR!"
---
"...oh no it's retarded."
---
Maybe you should have planned it for over a year 
---
We had it planned for over a year. Get me a PC Gamer article. 
---
I will consider releasing source code. If I do, I'll post an update and ping you personally.
---
They didn't have to last time, only after PL deployed south did Goons come.
---
Frat was left high and dry by panfam last year, I doubt they want to batphone them so soon after. If Test doesnt have to fight PL, I don't think they'll batphone goons.
---
I'll be very disappointed if I'm wrong, but I don't like how there are so many cynics here so I'll stay optimistic for now.
---
Decreased the speed
---
Ill never forget that 2-3km/s cyclone that Usain bolted out of your RASB orgy to scramfuck my retri.
---
Ill have Victoria's hide one day, mark my words.
---
Let's see how effective INIT are in Esoteria. Don't think you'll be showing up to fight a real alliance though 
---
Hah would have been truly tough one. I wonder if we brought max max boosh ravens if we would even be able to pause the timer? Between the amount of fighter swarms and cepter warp ins and command dessys getting sniped I doubt we could do it.
---
Reminds me of my wedding....
---
Also, accurate.  
---
We do heavy armor semi regularly! lol. Just not with caps :p
---
Lemme find that Novac fight where we got spanked... was last month, but was a ton of fun... oh yeah! Here it is.
---
https://zkillboard.com/related/31001705/201902140100/
---
And that one that got linked above is heavy armor, where we got that nag and thanny
---
Confessors count as heavy armor, right? lol
---
Goons were on the most "big timers" when test was deployed north. Goons were batphoned for test hs shenanigans. Why should they suddenly stop with that?
---
They gave consent when they signed up for the corp. Revoking that consent is up to them.
---
wat
---
what is  a good corp for an alpha???
---
I might make another post if there's interest. Kind of a long explanation though to go through that much stuff, but tldr leshaks and command ships
---
oh look another salt named corp
---
and of course the tagline has "tears" in it
---
cringey asf
---
Word on the street was there were hundreds of dreads waiting for us. And we still wanted to go. But we weren’t going to welp a supercap fleet for the sake of a last second change of mind by Vily. Who told us he was going after frt literally moments before we jump in goons tell us he’s siding with panfam and are going to dread bomb snuff/init and leave when goons show up
---
Awww! Thanks! Definitely won't claim we're competent yet, but we try lol. Super nice of you &lt;3
---
they used pl_sphere.exe tbh
---
[removed]
---
What is it you find unusual about that fit?
---
Glad you’ve found your groove btw :)

Dear ninazu pilot:
---
you are a hero https://zkillboard.com/kill/75748183/
---
I do my best diplomacy when wasted.
---
We literally just had a fight as people were commenting on this thread, was a ton of fun.
---
https://zkillboard.com/related/31000738/201903180000/
---
can have smaller fights too, and get some great times out of it. WH's are where it's at.
---
Also, logi bros are fucking gods, bow down before you my man
---
just needs to be more dynamic, felt kind weird, was almost like a break from the original video if you get me
---
No
---
That is a pretty shitty BR to be honest.  You do know that you can move folks to the proper side before posting, right?
---
TBH generally the WH groups that allow and encourage alphas tend to be more pve focused (in my experience) and those groups don't seem to do as well in wh space as they would, like, out in highsec. Omega gives you at the very least covert ops cloak, which is relatively important in wormholes.
---
A juicier dunk = a riskier dunk, so no :\\\^)
---
Lol goon posters salty they had to burn from delve in 10% tidi the whole way
---
Still trying to roll in. One day soon I am sure!
---
Wouldn't be the first time somebody told porkies on stream to set up a result they wanted.  Vily does seem dumb and vindictive enough to do it.
---
HA without caps is like vegan food. Good, but it feels like there's something missing. 
---
Photoshiped
---
And yet, the fact that you think its funny is reason enough for Init to not give a shit about future ops test may want help with. Spin some more... please
---
\&gt; Says he will do something.
---
\&gt; Does the thing he says he will do.
---
&gt; Wouldn't be the first time somebody told porkies on stream to set up a result they wanted.
---
Please explain.
---
The problem with DSTs is that they're hundreds of millions of isk. There's a awkwardly big gap in both cost and capability here between the existing t1 haulers and anything better - it'd be like if the only thing above T1 cruisers were HACs, recons, and then capitals. There ought to exist a T1 BC or T1 BS of haulers - something bigger and more capable (but slower and more expensive) than the existing indys, but not to the extremes of the current upgrades in either cost or capability. (Also not with the specializations of the DST or blockade runner - no cloak, ehp/cargo ratios more in line with the t1 haulers than the dst due to not having bonused tank and t2 resists, etc.)
---
And imo, the reason to fly the existing t1 haulers would be the same reason why someone might want to fly t1 cruisers instead of BCs - cheaper, more accessible, and faster. If t1 BCs don't make t1 cruisers obsolete, I don't see why this would make the existing t1 haulers obsolete.
---
Probably the hilarious lack of tank on that hulk is what he's referring to
---
I'm just too used to having FAX/Dreads on grid these days I guess
---
can you please elaborate how the defenders of defensive timer suddenly become attackers of attackers
---
It’s what I deserve for such enthusiasm lol
---
So not down with siding with Panfam.   Wtf?
---
Snuff eould have stay down south in range of Test, Frat and PL all would gun for them
---
The only supers there would be init and snuff lol
---
just try to warp back or buy a aires.
---
You say that as if Tidi didn't cause gate jumps to take 10 minutes. We took that gate before they even landed but then sat there waiting for the game to work. We were totally told frat was blue before we were all through the gate but there were people on the far side for quite a while before that happened.
---
You do understand that your defense proficiency rising is a good enough reason for CCP to shift the meta?  
---
Meta shifting exists in all online games to deal with players who "figured it out" and thus are very hard to beat, also it makes gameplay variable.  
---
If one big coalition has the way to farm tremendous amount of resources (tremendous enough to make the whole classes of ships useless \*cough-exhumers-cough\*) with a 99% safety, no matter what they do to achieve it it is not a desirable state of affairs. Even more so if you can drop the blob in seconds, lol. Doesn't seem to me it's any hard to do for you organizationally anymore, if you can do it THIS fast.  
---
Yeah I mean, that shit's expensive. Like, actually expensive. To be able to run fleets like that regularly, especially expecting that you'll lose (if you're us) you're talking 15-20 billion isk fleets sometimes. Add in what you guys do with the slave pods, max skills, all the alts etc, and it just takes so much isk to be able to support losing fleets like that regularly, it's just not really viable for a newbro group like us.
---
Some of our guys have farmholes, but the vast majority of the alliance doesn't, so the income just isn't there. Moving to a C5 would take even more of that away (guys couldn't rat the C3)... Yikes. 
---
We're happy to fight against other people's caps though :) As long as we have at least a chance of doing some damage (not outnumbered 3 to 1 or something silly)
---
😂 
---
To think provi thinks SNUFF was going to save CVA, these lads are mad.
---
he's putting his tri experience to good use.
---
They can take blops bridges, which isn't quite the same thing.
---
I get your meaning, but it's just pixels... And potentially a couple hours of work gone
---
Your sister is a keeper. Roll tide 
---
Maxim 29: The enemy of my enemy is my enemy's enemy.  No more.  No less.
---
&gt; Vily does seem dumb 
---
Runs not only an alliance but a large coalition.
---
Fc'd sub-caps and super fleets for years.
---
What do you do in this game?
---
We have &lt;5 people that reguarly fly heavy armor caps. Takes an evening farming to replace them if they die, but its not quite as bad as you make it sound.
---
woah, S810 I remember you from SOTF back in the day, how goes?
---
Don't get me wrong, if you are really a newbro I'm happy that you enjoy the game. But you should know that trust in this game is a dangerous thing.
---
No, you cannot board someone else's ship with them, and have them drive you home.
---
You could risk asking someone nearby if they have a Titan or a Jump Gate that leads you somewhere closer to safety.
---
Or you can just build yourself another ship out there, and start flying home. All you really need is a CovOps frig and a T2 Cloak. Or an Interceptor so you can dash through bubbles.
---
Blue is just a color lmao
---
Lol “pl and friends” as if it took any more than PL
---
Find a new corp. Worked out well for me. Twice. 
---
yeah, my assumption is that the boosh doctrines are much less viable without hictors preventing warpins to 0.  Though people more experienced with the doctrine would have to say.
---
you know that test was shooting goons.
---
No, that was already after rework. There were several.  
---
What you are talking about is the best state of affairs IMO.  
---
Each barge/exhumer had a specific boost making it highly specialized, i.e. one for ice, others for other types of ore.  
---
BEFORE that barges and exhumers differentiated in different skill levels needed to pilot them (hulk being the most skill-expensive) and in different amount of highslots/mounting points.  
---
So, Hulk was the best mining ship. It costed much and it mined much, being worth to have it.  
---
Now all of the exhumers are junk considering cost.  
---
I had a gut feeling you would repay the favor. Good on you.
---
So an alliance will determine their future ops based on what some dude says on reddit? 
---
yeah it's not though. everyone owns subs and supers, i don't want my supertits to be useless. but they're op, end of story
---
INIT  
---
MOVED THEIR SUPERS  
---
FROM FOUNTAIN FOR THIS TIMER  
---
PC GAMER ARTICLE WHEN
---
Not skilled enough for either of those ships, unfortunately.
---
At the end of the day, leaders being able to trust each other is a big deal. One thing Panfam has maintained since creation is its ability to keep its word. Adversely, Snuff have been more shortsighted. As mercenaries, you must always be agnostic :)
---
Thanks the reason is that great app are develop for the comunity and for some reason the developer louser interes on the game and everybody stay hanggin. Thanks for the consideration, i know doing this app take time and we are atache to our creations. 
---
Can someone please explain this in plain English to lesser experienced players what this balance issue is all about. It's posts like these that make this game very inaccessible, which makes it all the more important to have a newbro-friendly write-up of this.
---
Hell, I don't even have a clue about what OP is talking about and I have been following this game for a long time.
---
I don't the issue is what he is doing but what he is saying 
---
Clone jump out. Wait for another op and jump back in. 
---
There is not and it’s to try and prevent everybody waiting until the last second to enter a bid when it’s just going to get extended anyway. 
---
karma is a bitch
---
More like... war dec... see noob... attack noob... pad killboard... gloat how elite you are... repeat carebear pvp.
---
While I am a fan of getting revenge on Snuff, I would prefer we do it when GOONS aren't on grid.  Those guys have been solid when we worked together.
---
I don't think CCP has released any blogs on the color of the sky how do you know it's not green?
---
I don't recall ever seeing CCP's opinion on the color of the sky.
---
And bask in the salt ^
---
Call me stupid but I don't get it, tanky but no gun damage. So this is only competitive as a tackler?
---
I actually have alts in null alliances, but I'm not there to spy. I just like to be everywhere.
---
The autism is strong with this one 
---
yeah I wasn't saying it's an invasion threat now, just that it is of strategic consequence to their coalition
---
if tikle were the ones saying "no we like having that keepstar around for reasons" then I'd shrug and move on. it's their backyard, if they like living dangerously that's cool. vily making strategy decisions over a personal grudge is dumb.
---
literally hundreds
---
Stay solo as long as possible. Do missions. Join FW. Explore sigs. Check out wormholes. Do abyssal sites. Go mining. Then after you exhausted all that. Find a small active corp. Don't even think about joining a big alliance or corp, because you'll be a pawn and a nobody. 
---
I was just thinking that I miss attending the smoke filled back room meetings~ and knowing wtf is going on politically, but this was reassuring that even if I did attend those meetings, I would probably still be confused.  
---
Very insightful and helpful, thanks
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

2nd or 3rd biggest. I'd give biggest to the group that jumped in out of range of the fight on a keepstar... or maybe the ones that said dock up all your faction titans
---
Eve is the only game where a player spending 15h a week would be considered casual.  
---
That's a game where skills learn themselves.  
---
OP, get some help.  
---
i did
---
Praise Bob!
---
INIT does't get to decide what ops they help with, Goonswarm does. I guess you could :vote with your fleet participation: , but since you're in the Imperium, you have to do that too or risk losing that sweet rorqual botting space.
---
&gt; So what was seconds away from a supercap TIDI fight transformed into a massive waste of literally everybody's time.
---
&gt; supercap TIDI fight
---
&gt; transformed into a massive waste of literally everybody's time.
---
&gt; transformed
---
you don't need to transform a supercap tidi fight into a waste of everybody's time, it already is by default.
---
&gt; ~the great betrayal of their titan fleet~
---
He said that on stream yes, but what we've been told is that he said he would help kill it an hour before the fight. I mean if our leadership was aware of this in advance, why would we have undocked and lit a cyno to drop titans, only to turn around and head back home at the last second? 
---
You're talking quite abstractly due to what I suspect is a lack of familiarity with the details in question.
---
Give me a set of example stats for what you imagine the following values on such a hauler might be:
---
* Price
---
* Slot layout
---
* Align time in seconds
---
* EHP when fully tanked
---
* Carry capacity when max tank
---
* Carry capacity when max cargo
---
It gets advertised as a stepping stone corp because it allows you to join gsf without getting scammed by someone
---
tracking
---
which is funny cuz with snuff we just shrugged, cynoed twice, and were home.
---
Download Neocom on your phone then your life outside the game can be over 
---
that was not the case all the time, you know
---
You're objectively wrong. The jag I use will permatank a carrier with ease and it's about 120mil. Even dragonflies, which punch into it's weakest resist. I've used it to get fights several times by tackling a carrier that drops on me and killing the ree rees who warp in 1 at a time to try and save it.
---
100% correct
---
Our FCs must've forgotten to keep an eye on the twitch streams ahead of the fight this time, won't happen again
---
What good is the jita alt just to play the market?
---
&gt; Dead end null is worthless to established entities because they have the ability to fight for better space. Deep null has a natural protection by being harder to get fleets too
---
Can you give an example of a constellation in "deep null" you think could be easily taken by a group that doesn't have a single jump freighter?
---
Where is a bucket for tear collection. Clearly fake.
---
Lol
---
Yeah, not saying it's bad. just saying I don't think we'd be able to sustain those losses for long, given how our numbers are. Maybe one day :D
---
16
---
But logic ruins the narrative...
---
You guys dont have rattlesnakes to farm your c5 static? :0
---
Something a bit more interesting would be comparing how many defenders fought back in the same period before and after the wardec.
---
A bunch of stuff isn't showing up, 3 more dead faxes. idk. not gonna bother
---
Nnoone actually cares, it was a "debt" to be fullfilled. Provi cant handle tikle in provis primetime let alone legacy. Your value of self-importance is greatly exaggerated. In the food chain provi is only above renters
---
amen
---
i would be very surprised if fawlty were perturbed by the camal keepstar tbh
---
My dude, you weren’t around in the Iteron V or bust days, eh?
---
Used to be all the t1 haulers were identical except for number of lows and base size. The gallente has 5 t1 haulers that we’re each slightly bigger.
---
The current lineup is much better.
---
Not to say that a jump capable small hauler wouldn’t be awesome.
---
TAPI screw over provi, this has to be a first. Along with that TAPI needs to show their individual strength and not be the whipping boy of CFC or panfam depending on the year.
---
How strong of a ship do you need to will sleeper drones? I have a Tristan with basic fitting and some hobgoblins II
---
 How strong of a ship do you need to fight sleeper drones? I have a Tristan with basic fitting and some hobgoblins II 
---
Whats wrong with C4? 
---
you regularly get so drunk that you blackout and remember literally nothing?
---
get help man
---
Yes I'm sure they will. Great assessment... clearly the biggest cracks are forming currently.
---
We rolled into you as you were mobilising. We were forming a fleet to come down the chain as the Rev jumped and collapsed the hole. So we settled for a quick in and out on a Sabre on your Fort. And then killed one of their Ceptor pilots on the way back in. Looked like a fun fight, wish we could've third partied (I was the Legion that decloaked to drop probes on a perch...)
---
&lt;3
---
I think they just left because their reason for joining was to get all their guys titans and they'd done that. 
---
Wow that's very cool!
---
Let me get this straight, cause I can't see clearly with all this smoke screen about test.  
---
Are you telling me that with subcap advantage + the super fleet of 2 alliances consisting of 7000+ characters, the deciding factor about using them or not was a fucking test subcap fleet?
---
I'm sorry but I'm not buying it, for me this is the exposed of 2019, init and snuff shit the bed plain and simple.
---
I was the first to mock vily when snuff killed test supers and I'm gonna say the same thing I said that time, if you don't like what's been done upon you, either do something about it or go to a corner crying looking like a pathetic bitch.
---
The reality here is that some groups grind trillions monthly only to avoid using their shit even on lowsec space with no bubbles and the numeric advantage.  
---
Not a Gila pilot, but how does the nerf feel flying them now? Noticable difference?
---
Maybe your leadership is lying and spinning to try and build morale, exactly like how they are spinning that you guys had a successful deployment and are going to switch to jump clones to continue the harass but its time to hang out at home :^)
---
Thanks, but it’s not so much a guess~ CCP went out mails to Amsterdam attendees saying these would come with attendance lol
---
Seraph Padecain, is that you? How ya doin' brudda.
---
I remember the order to murder your Scimi. I was still in the jump tunnel.
---
The 20.5 million sp cap is for all of the alpha skills available. So if you only have every alpha skill, you'll have 20.5 million sp. There is no way to "lose sp" outside of subsystem skills when losing a t3c, which requires Omega anyways. The "extra" sp above the 5 million cap are just locked up, and the trained skills are unusable until you become Omega again.
---
what trap lmao?
---
Lows have all shield power really IIs
---
Mids have all large shield extender IIs 
---
Highs have either arbalest rapid heavies or meta 4 cruise launchers (rhmls apply better, cruise lets you more range, people use either)
---
Rigs have 3 large core defense field purger Is 
---
I like to have depot, mtu, salvagers X 7, ballistic control IIs (3-4) and maybe a target painter for applying better. Drones I go faction ogres, if you go backpacking bring core probes.
---
I'm sorry but TEST really batphoned Goons during their deployment in the north, and during the "Trader war" 
---
He's probably manually piloted more than your entire corp combined. Settle down, buster.
---
But that isn't what a stepping stone corp is. A stepping stone corp is a corp you join with the intention of joining another.  We get many applicants like that.  They do not get in.
---
The 3 missing mid slots. If he would have had tank mods, even though we were 100km off most of the Rorquals, they may have been able to rep him long enough for the 6 carriers and FAX to land (which landed right after we killed it). The rig is a bit questionable too, but I suppose most people use the same hull when switching between ice/ore, so I can give that more of a pass.
---
We're not selling quantity, we're selling quality. 
---
If they wait until the inhib has anchored, I guess they cant use a cyno. But thats kind of the problem, isnt it? Why would they wait?
---
TIDI is the best!
---
Honestly test + horde vs pl/nc/goons would be a dope war.
---
Yes, clone jump out. Failing that, a strat op means you have have friends, get one of your friends to fly a ship out to you. Pay him money, it'll be cheaper regardless
---
This post is fantastic.
---
Going to disagree. Up until the beginning of this year I was in null for a decade, running a corporation that entire time and FCing. Getting non-blob fights has been fairly easy in wormholes, and knowing I'm not gonna get supers dropped on my small gang stuff every 5 seconds is fantastic.
---
Seriously if you have a drinking problem get help. 
---
Jesus, even Horde has better intel than init.
---
Yes... hard to do with the hoops players have to jump through nowadays just to join. They can literally back check everything. 
---
I'm a lone wolf alpha that spends a fair amount of time in wh-space. Haven't been taken out in pvp in a wh yet. My pve losses were, uh, just ignorance, and an accidental warp to a "forgotten" something something when I intended to warp to the sun to set a safe spot. That was a one hit kill on a maiden voyage. After a run in with a player in a system 2 deep in wh-space trying to hunt me out with combat scanners I like to set 3 safe spot in a big triangle so that if exits are guarded I run in a giant circle to keep the combat scanners schizophrenic. 
---
You're better off joining FW and doing the old bait and kill. 
---
this is acceptable posting
---
Can't you just setup a macro key to hit the scan key every 15 seconds or so? What is it the "V" key? Or just set it on a mouse key. 
---
Snuff slights Legacy leadership and meme's on them.
---
Legacy: "It is what it is"
---
Snuff wants to kill a Keepstar in Legacy's and Panfams spheres of influence.
---
Snuff is not sure they can outnumber Titans 50:1
---
Snuff has a working relationship with INIT.
---
mandatory note: INIT ARE NOT GOON PETS!!!1!111!, BUT INIT ARE IMPERIUM ASWELL!
---
INIT says wow, Keepstar kill and no year long rolling required.
---
INIT asks Daddy Goon if its okey.
---
It is okey.
---
INIT and Snuff hold hands. 
---
TEST is already bitter, but now also jealous and also not included even though its their playground.
---
Snuff and INIT show up.
---
TEST shows up.
---
INIT is clenching, Snuff is sweating.
---
TEST unzips.
---
Snuff is afraid but INIT is already butthurt even though its not even in yet.
---
Snuff goes away, INIT goes on reddit.
---
What we learned from this interaction: Panfam and TEST have a working relationship as adversaries. TEST and Snuff are enemies. TEST is friends with Goons, but doesn't allow Goons adopted kid to run amok in its playground.
---
hey I stopped playing about 3 years ago and super drunk me re installs the game all the time.

Yeah, well, that’s just like uhhh, your opinion, man
---
There's a lot of different wormhole sites, and different wormhole effects that play into fighting sleeper drones. If you're actually trying to fight wormhole rats in proper wormholes, and not in say some tutorial mission, I'd recommend something larger than a Tristan. 
---
Use Karr's modified Rykki's guide for up to date information on sleeper rats. Even the easiest sites will do somewhere above 150 dps, which might be a bit hard to get on a Frigate, even with speed tanking involved. 
---

---
damn id hate you to be my fc 100% feeder mentality.
---
Anywhere not under a capital umbrella where fleets would have to make 30-50 jumps to defend it. And it wouldn't be a constellation, it would be a single system with the capital bonus.
---
Cache comes to mind as one example of a place to attempt it, not saying it would be successful, but it would be a place to try.
---
Why? because no one wants to defend space that they don't use and don't give a shit about. They will show up for the first few timers and then ignore it until they are bored. Having a small punching bag brings your members content anyways.
---
“Reee why won’t my hotdrop capital apply to the one ship type specifically designed to not be applied to”
---
Are you meaning the upcoming nerf to the drone HP bonus? 
---
That nerf won't be here until April and really shouldn't hurt its PVE abilities too much.
---
I lack the IQ to understand this post.
---
I mean I had 9, and never had any issues except being bombed once cause I was off doing the dishes. (Being a massive pleb)
---
Rorquals are insanely safe under an umbrella, and considering all you really need to do is drop a few fax and you can tank fleets till downtime, being able to drop a few hundred caps means you’re essentially untouchable.
---
Yeah the return on investment is a bit longer but man I was making 900m-1b  an hour while watching Netflix, I dno how much easier  you want high level income to be or how much safer anyone could want it.
---
Remove panic btw.
---
I used to explore all the time. The explorers I ran into that were more dedicated than I or just better at evasion were oddly very mysterious players. Rarely talking to anyone and being spooked very easily.
---
However I spent half my time exploring by hunting the *other* explorers. I'd scan and bm sites in 4-5 systems at a time and go back and sometimes camp them, but mostly just run them if I hadn't seen anyone. Always used an astero for this.
---
ECM drones are a lifesaver. Some people I fought were doing the same as me, battle asteros, and getting away when I fucked up was important when I had 1/2 a billion in relic loot and stuck out in random nullsec 3 jumps away from home chain.
---
For your situation though I'd say have a mwd and cloak. If you ever get caught in a bubble, pulse your mwd once, then immediately cloak and change direction afterwards before your mwd cycle is up.  
---
Treat it the same as a bubble gatecamp. Their bubblers (and anyone else present) is going to burn at where you cloaked as quickly as they can for a decloak and you DON'T want to be there when they get in range.  After that, you can slowburn cloaked out of the bubble and warp away. You may still have to try some evasion if there are a lot or the decloakers guess by chance where you are.
---
paging /u/mjrleestoned 
---
I don't disagree on Snuff but saying Panfam keeps their word? Have we forgotten about Malia? 
---
This is...enlightening.
---
Goons went to kill Camal Keepstar, got more resistance than they bargained for...many hours later...
---
Init and snuff aren't a threat to TEST, and tbh, if given a choice, Panfam would probably shoot Snuff over TEST any time and every time. 
---
Some say they are still waiting on traffic control to this day.
---
My money is on attending a Fanfest event this year.
---
But you have enough IQ to be aware of your condition.
---
Stuff quickly compounded and people were throwing a fit and didn't want to do anything. Being told to shoot previous friends during a serious stratop was just icing on the cake.
---
FRT's eagles were good compensation:P good fights were had.
---
If you no longer have the implants, just set your home station to a structure in the system you need to go. You can remotely set your home station once a year if you havent already, then self destruct.
---
Snuff isn't CFC. TAPI has no agreements anywhere that stops them from shooting Snuff whenever they feel like. 
---
What skills are the most important skills to Max first for pvp? I'm currently working on "the magic 14". I'm guessing navigation, targeting speed, and agility first? My skill Q is mostly broad passives and I'm at 80 something days.
---
Panfam gave up on evicting TEST last year.
---
95% efficiency is what i would qualify as a gank. Good fights are closer to 50-60%. 
---
90%+ fights are tools of war not tools of fun.
---
Lucky Snuff didn't jump on INIT.
---
"because you are already aligned"  
---
This is a common misconception and so I won't blame you for making this suggestion.  
---
Your ship orientation while stopped does not effect your time to warp. This is fairly easy to test by measuring your time to warp:  
---
\- Test 1: Point your ship away from your target. Stop your ship and initiate warp.
---
\- Test 2: Point your ship toward from your target. Stop your ship and initiate warp.  
---
Aligning is moving in the direction of your target at 75% of your max velocity.  
---
hack in W-space. You'll never see it coming
---
If it was next door then i think you miss placed the cyno
---
"Make sure you bookmark the other side or you'll be humping it back to Catch"
---
No, TAPI has no agreements with Snuff, so they can shoot them anytime they want and they certainly don't give a fuck about some pet whose claim to fame is that they feel they're the most loyal pet in Imperium.
---
If you take money from a criminal, and then give it back after he gets arrested/banned you still commited a crime/bannable offense, just puting it out there. Could of not been a loan but rmt and you tried giving it back to cover your ass. Also i think ccp's policy is to temp ban first time buyers and nuke there wallet, sounds like your perm banned. By you posting here on reddit like the hundreds of other "innocent" pepole that got banned, this is your last ditch effort to get unbanned, when all other attemps fail. By ccp closeing your tickets there not ignoreing you there saying quit bitching we have aready looked at your case and your fucked. 
---
They should ad an option where it adds a green happy face if you had fun, or a red sad face if you didn't enjoy. Then you can see which engagements were the most fun positive.
---
Sometimes you just win the fight. In some of those cases, it was just doctrine choices and positioning that caused clean losses and wins. That's especially true where faxes are involved, theres a ton of momentum when you start winning.
---
Buy a shuttle, don't warp gate to gate. Always warp to a celestial close enough to dscan the gate before going there. Also check dotlan for ships killed in the last 24h for regions you are going to be going through and avoid super hot systems.
---
you can't say you haven't been warned
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/a7xi5n/provi_invasion_plans_leaked/
---
That's the idea, yes.  Extremely hard to kill tackle before the guns arrive.
---
Uhhhhhj
---
What part of it's an interdiction destroyer is confusing to you?
---
It was nuts. I was one of the 3 logi that survived o.O 
---
And those aren't fun fights. You just smash the opposition to little pieces with hard counters. Just because you aren't using supers to do it doesn't make it actually fun.
---
serious: maybe add a repair bonus to make it a more resilient option for solo/small gang tackle  
---
Thanks for a good tldr of this situation

---
For that one in particular, which we won, we undocked first and and had the fleet committed before knowing anything about what others were bringing (and they had picked the time and asked for a fight). The other groups chose to engage (or not, in TDSIN's case) with full awareness of what we were in. Novac was trying a different counter to our doctrine, and it just wasn't very effective. We fed to their barghest fleet not too long ago, its just the way the cookie crumbles sometimes. 
---
Rip it down and start over
---
and?  
---
It is now, and IMO it would be weird for 1 class of ship to have different requirements for all the rest.
---
PRAISE JAMES!!!!
---
That's a lot of claims to fabricate per game!
---
haha awesome mate!! Yeah dude pvp is my motivation to keep playing too :) Glad to hear you came back, EVE needs another infusion of players, hoping some of my vids get people wanting to pvp
---
Thanks man, solid fights from legacy, love going to your space :)
---
Literally rolled out of bed for this fight towards the end was alot of fun thanks for coming!
---
he said of the post not r/eve
---
Yeah, for sure. If you want to afk and not really play eve, just watch your ticks/ore hold increase, it's not for you.
---
I'll second that - we just had a Titan boson one of our kikimoras out roaming in goon space. Nullsec is aids.
---
its problem of goons having to burn from delve in 10% tidi the whole way
---
didnt show anyone jumping in tonight or dock up they were only jumping out run and hide so definitely #1
---
&gt;One thing Panfam has maintained since creation is its ability to keep its word.
---
lmao
---
Yeah, this isn't true at all. here's a vid of the fight we had with NOVAC last month:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GahaVa_L5Gw
---
We got our asses handed to us, but the fight was (somewhat) even. We chose to take the fight, yeah, they had a couple more guys and slightly bigger ships, plus slave pods, so definitely an advantage. That being said, if i would have focused their guardians from the getgo instead of calling the targets that I did, and shifted our ecm around a little more effectively I think we would have had a chance there.
---
BR: https://zkillboard.com/related/31001705/201902140100/
---
Here's one that's really similar, where we won against njed: 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWzz2pw65-4&amp;feature=youtu.be
---
This one was a really even fight, with bosth sides almost dead even with numbers and classic fights. But BR says otherwise:
---
https://zkillboard.com/related/31000635/201901050300/
---
I'd say these are 2 very accurate examples of how you're objectively wrong.
---
It just needs a big fitting buff. Its quite fast and super agile, you can get good damage out of it both with rails and blasters compared to other dictors. Its not a fleet dictor, but fitting to help actually get 150's or neutrons (plus bubble) to fit reasonably would help it a lot.  
---
Wouldn't hurt the heretic to get a small fitting buff too. Currently only the flycatcher and eris can bubble+damage with long range weapons (eris has to use 125 railguns with no scram/tackle).
---
I don't mention the sabre because its in a good spot, and even though it'd be cool to have a sabre with artillery and bubbles, the fitting buff necessary to make it happen would be stupid and break the sabre by  being able to fit anything it wanted.
---
Yeah but he started it. Memory is a bit fuzzy here, either he gave it to spectre80 or there was some time in between with someone else in charge, but in any case its spec's now. There are some dudes in HTP that are in this new rekkingcrew, but I would hardly call it an alliance of PL alts :D
---
tbh with the state of eve these days you will likely get home just fine in your pod without seeing a single gate camp
---
I forgot how much I loved this show. I wish it didn't attract such high IQ people.
---
I will readily admit I'm not particularly familiar with hauling. My experience is basically just carting cheap stuff around on my alt occasionally, and I don't think I'd be particularly competent to pick the exact stats for such a hypothetical hauler. I don't think that invalidates my observation that there's a really large cost/capability gap between t1 haulers and everything else, however - I don't have to be able to smithy the replacement part to observe that there's something missing. I can still look at carting stuff with my alt and observe that it'd be nice if there was something I could upgrade her to that was cheaper than a DST, even if I wouldn't be able to pick out the right balance for its stats.
---
Frankly, I just want 'whatever stats a 50 mil hull cost hauler ought to have', presuming that it will be roughly similar in ehp/cargo ratio to a t1 hauler and wherever between that and a DST in terms of overall tank and capacity would be appropriate for that price. I'll leave the balance up to those who know enough to do it right, I just want something that fills that hole in terms of cost.
---
Eve is best mmo hands down. Don't give up, ever.
---
I love my chat box stop picking on it
---
700dps is nothing to be sneezed at, the eris just needs some fitting room buff
---
Truth
---
Dangerous, yet precious.
---
Vily litteraly said hours before on talking in stations stream that we were going to defend it...
---
we had an afk rorq survive because someone else came in and popped a cyno for the afk dude
---
Yes, thank you for all the ISK.
---
Word also has it he told us just 10 mins before we were to jump in he wasn’t. So there is the start of the conflicting statements
---
I send out all the diplos dude, keep those networks up
---
to be fair the convos were after that stream and people can change their minds so who knows
---
&gt; Maybe they made some deal with PanFam?
---
Fuck snuff is the deal.
---
Both of these battle reports show curbstomps not fun fights. I was talking about where the battle report shows closer to 50% isk efficiency not "the sides were well matched by our subjective opinions."
---
[Something more like this is what i think of.](https://zkillboard.com/related/30001198/201903061600/)
---
pretty sure our fc's thought that we had killed all of you, so i'm not sure how you survived.  did you warp off when the faxes dropped?
---
We don't use ablative t1 doctrines though. If that's not you thing thats fine, but most comps in wh space are a lot more subject to reaching critical mass. I personally enjoy it because its high risk and high reward, but thats not how NS fights go. 
---
Didn't train Politicking V, so I can only use the Intern Mark III.
---
&gt;You can easily mine for a while and then sell the rorq
---
Good thing the spring update will change it to "you can easily mine and get btfo completely" easily with local tank nerf, PANIC nerf, bloated volume excavators and reduced insurance payouts.
---
Roggle, that's a name I haven't heard in a long time, since back in the Maythorn. Glad you're back again.
---
we are true bros
---
the fight against njed was literally dead even in number and class of ships, and the fight against novac was close. It just turns out that novac did better than us in our fight, and we did better than njed in the fight. That doesn't make them a curbstomp, they were both really fun fights. If you're defining "fun" by a percentage on a 3rd party killmail tool, welll... you probably got more issues than just having fun in a game XD
---
shhhhhhhhh
---
Can confirm spai alt is happy in horde
---
Didn't spend a year seeding the system with reships and the like...
---
Actually funny story there. The only scimitar that survived was at 1% structure. People probably thought it died so they changed targets. The other basilisk disconnected so I was the only one left. When I got targeted, the Ninazu caught reps on me and your FC probably told you to switch targets. After that, no one focused me and so I did my pitiful best (as a basilisk with no chain) to heal.
---
We formed 1500 and we didn't get dick. 
---
&gt;  Maybe you could sum up what each of the big groups does and how they live?
---
They roll
---
They troll
---
But most of all they loll :&gt;
---
There's even a place for you in W-Space, Brisc :)

https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99008763/
---
I’m consistently amazed that there are Goons who come to reddit asking how to Eve. As your damn corpmates. 
---
ah yeah that would make sense. once the faxes got on grid they got the full focus, not too many subs got called primary after that.
---
Depends what you want to do for PvP. If you want to do frigate battles in faction warefare you can start on day one with a bunch of skills at II-III (I'd recommend getting most of the skills that directly affect your ships to at least IV, and V for the specific guns you are using though). If you want to hunt solo in a T3C, the there are a lot more skills you should have before you start. As a baseline though, pick the ship you want to PvP with, get the ship skill to IV, and the guns used by that ship to V for T2 guns (the specialization skill is fine at II-III unless you have absolutely nothing else to train though). You should also have the skills such that you can fit at least a T2 tank, and drones V, because a majority of ships can field 5 drones. If you have all that plus most of the magic 14 trained to IV, then you are doing good. You should also look at rigging skills, as they can often get forgotten and can have a significant impact. I doubt it needs to be said, but I'll say it anyways. This dose not apply to capital ships, as they have a large number of support skills you need trained before you should even consider them. Also, just because you can sit in a ship doesn't mean you should be flying it. 
---
:words:
---
Fire sale it via contract.
---
That amount of isk is worth about $10 in plex.  You could always just buy some plex to recoup your losses.
---
I guess that depends on if you have $10 of disposable income or want to try to spend however many hours playing the game to grind up that much isk.
---
honestly id like to see an overall frigate rebalance. not sure if i'm alone in that regard, but theres a lot of tiny changes that could increase a lot more variation in frigate combat that could shake up the meta a bit. i love frigates and i love reading that one users balance reports. ive been thinking of typing up my own thoughts into a similar format but i figure no one would want to hear more 'bitching' on this subreddit. 
---
i love frigates and want more to be viable i suppose. obviously assault frigates are gonna outclass t1 frigs every day, but now that ccp took away the first chance i had to participate in the AT, this is all that keeps me in the game.
---
&gt; how do I distinguish between just seeing a ship in range of 14.3au, and one that is on its way to me?
---
Always assume that it is about to drop on you. Always. If I see anyone on D-scan that isn't a known friendly (And I have very *very* few known friendlies.) , I immediately warp to my safe and then nope straight toward the exit hole. 
---
Hy not telling you he wouldn't shoot you isn't breaking their word lmao.
---
To which Hy said "yes im going to the amamake fight" and didn't answer the "will u shoot me" question and vily was a retard and moved anyways.  TAPI pretending it was some epic betrayal is hilarious.
---
I'll get downvoted for this, but the logs are public sooooo.
---
...either zkill is broken for me or you have 16 kills total. 
---
so are you now seeing why test said 'fuck snuff'?
---
Is awesomeness of fight measured in ISK killed or it was unintentional point?
---
Lol no get out.
---
Yeah bud, no one who has ever lost titans to PL on a move op has EVER formed up to help PL.  Totally unheard of.
---
Last time I felt the rush we were fighting 120 Russians with 60 in fleet (and winning). This was maybe two weeks ago...before that it was killing an AT ship with a couple friends. That was a month ago. You just have to go out and find that shit. 
---
Just trying to highlight the high-risk, high-reward environment. You can actually fly expensive doctrines and have it be noticeably more effective than just feeding less t1 stuff than the other side, since reshipping doesn't really happen very much. 
---
Test titan and hostile structure are mutually exclusive.

I'd also suggest cleaning up your overview, or at least use the active Combat tab for when you're fighting. That way you don't have a bunch of wrecks cluttering up the list and can concentrate on the ships you still need to shoot at. If you need to see what wrecks are there, you can always switch over to Misc to check and make sure your MTU grabbed everything before scooping it.

Welcome to Eve.  Trust everyone. Trust no-one. Fly only what you can afford to lose. Remember that you'll find the best prospective friends on your own kill reports.  
---
Above all-else.  Don't fly it til you can fit it.  Core skills rule this game.  A shiny ship is merely an accessory for perfect navigation, gunnery, and defensive skills.

Sweet, cynos aren't an issue in WH space either.

Hey guys Jean called someone retarded... i’m not sure he ever post anything else but he did it! Met his quota. 
---
Its good to know that despite being a diminished figure, my legacy lives on rent free in your head.
---
Currently the controltowers the best protection for small group titans. 
---
If you happen to be living near a group with a lot of titans you can expect them to try to bump you off tether. (Since really as a small group unsuppprted, you probably don't have a keepstar.
---
Yay for the little guy! 
---
So I wonder if they would completely remove it or not.
---
Yep, that’s good ole jean alright, hey you should really follow this up with a u mad bro, and something about grandmother basements. 
---
The park at a Minmatar starbase.
---
Keep going, the fact that you've madposted at me twice is just stroking my ego more.

like. we didnt even do two pings for the subcap op.

i was very clear to anyone that would talk to me what our intent was
---
Yep, here a third? How many more you need? Here to please!

To target and enemy you can just Ctrl+click. Its alot easier than right clicking and selecting target.

You can also customise tour overview or just ask in the rookie chat for a link to a pre made overview pack.

join the ingame channel "Z-S Overview". the default overview is pretty cancer, but the tabs Z-S gives you are pretty good. declutters pretty well
---
Snuff tells one thing than does something else, their treacherous behavior surprises no-one by now.
---
The real question isn't who can't provi handle, it's who they can.
---
Ctrl + click the icon in space, or the entry in the overview. If you hold control you can also box select in space. :)
---
They did take all those faction forts from provi, so it's not really a first, they just called it a win cause TAPI stole them instead of PL.
---
What every true bro said to his bro before the backstab.
---
the important part was the way hy handled it
---
vily asked him if he was coming to shoot those supers, and he didn't say yes or no, he said "look at this timer over here." while that technically doesn't make him a liar in that he didn't knowingly tell any falsehoods, that doesn't make the way he handled that conversation honest
---
then vily came back and said "hey dude what the heck," and hy hid behind the fact that he technically didn't say he wasn't coming to do that, and that he technically didn't lie
---
when a friend or a professional associate asks you a question and you weasel out of giving them a straight answer to your benefit and their dismay, you can expect that to be interpreted as a dick move

was test on the defender side because snuff shat on a small test move op?
---
So some specifics for the historians;  Initially HTP was formed literally as a joke so that Spectre Fleet could drop SBU's in y-mp.
---
Jayne long ago announced that he had thought HTP had fulfilled whatever objectives he wanted to accomplish with it, and told all the members to drop their corporations and join Sanctuary of Shadows so that they could in turn join Overload Everything (dooms alliance of the era).
---
Most of us didn't think that was very fun or dovetailed with what we wanted so we collectively took executor from Jayne (at which point he dropped alliance immediately).  From there we went on to do fairly well on with black ops focus with successful campaigns against space monkey's and of course Providence.
---
Eventually we achieved critical mass and enough of a credible threat to take a small chunk of providence for ourselves (specifically y-mp and it's constellation) bringing our existence full circle. Other stuff happened too but it's mostly me talking about jeeps and snoots.
---
Careful now that's how pos's go offline with supers in them.
---
CTs were going for the same prices as citadels and other medium structures back before structures rolled out. (I know this means they did not cost that much to build, but it lines up.)
---
Much better than fountain eh? 
---
I’m thinking of buying plex will real money since it’s so expensive right now.
---
What should I do with isk? Buy injectors(I’m low sp) or get into reactions?
---
Or something else?
---
because no1 is interested in scrolling for 2hours
---
This is actually a problem due to our fleet sizes. Although not normally 10%.
---
We already have a ship tree
---
Wrapping up financial news, commodity prices fell on profit taking for trading runs but the manufacturing sector rallied on economic data showing a sharp increase in orders for starship components, meanwhile ...
---
Well, it's not the Rorqual that's the problem here, it's our significant Fortress Delve defence shield. Calls to nerf mining ships, is pointing the finger in the wrong direction. Blame the largest titan fleet in the galaxy and the bored vets who will drop on anything just for a bit of fun and amusement. :)
---
I'm not a good source for that information. I am terribad with my ingame money.
---
lol, close call
---
we have like 12 or 13? shiptrees.
---
now imagine all of them connected to each other just bigger, a fuckton of connections and in a giant fucking mess.
---
thats what a skilltree would look like. or in other words useless
---
They could sort it by starting skill
---
Because you couldn't do it and have it be readable.  
---
Dibs on your crap
---
The amount of ships is considerably less than the amount if skills.
---
or they could not waste their time on something we dont need and do stuff that would be useful...
---
Right next to gouging my eyes out with a spoon!

There probably was some 5man dessie militia fleet  worth dropping on

That is a overview problem. Z-S has a good overview you can import, and EVE-Uni has a decent guide to setting one up as well as a basic explanation of your overview in general. Anything to get away of the default overview is an improvement.  
---
[Z-S](https://imperium.news/z-s-overview-pack/)
---
[EVE-Uni](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Installing_the_EVE_University_Overview)
---
Hotkeys will also help, you can hold Ctrl to lock your overviews so nothing chances position and anything new gets added to the bottom until you release Ctrl. Ctrl+Click to targets something, wither in your overview or in space. I'd also recommend getting in the habit of using hotkeys to activate modules, particularly in the top row using you F# keys to activate guns, prop mods, tackle, ect. 
---
Nothing bad about not living in a blue donut and never doing anything impactful. 
---
The problem with eve right there.  Formed 100 titans... FML
---
If you show info on an item or ship, it pretty much shows you a tree of what you need to train. That's all we need. It's fine I think. 
---
there are 430+skills and just from the 4 main factions alone ~360 ships. so we prob have more ships than skills.
---
but anyways, with all the connections from skills to each other it would end in an unreadable mess
---
I was on the cerb fleet, we focused support and eagles as well initially. Then we focused the faxes on field, the mino was pretty impressive imo lol. We only shot one logi in that fleet and it died. We killed 4 faxes before the fleet got warped off. 
---
Fun fact: I d/c'd right before the fleet warped off so when I reconnected I warped back on grid and I thought I was done for but was able to warp off before the mach fleet could apply damage to me or point me.
---
It was a pretty fun fight imo. I honestly thought we would murder your fleet before reinforcements arrived but such is life in Eve lol.
---
Yeah about twice a week.
---
Yay I’m not alone!
---
Customize your overview. It's pretty complex, but you can do a lot with it. 
---
The legendary Ragnarok armour plate, adds 50 million ehp buffer to bus bois in fleet.
---
[Using torpedoes](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75712425/) to hack relic sites is a time honored tradition of WiNGSPAN. That being said, you can also do pirate relic and data sits in a PvP stratios if you want to both hunt and make ISK. 
---
Make stain only accessible via wormholes.
---
Look for Eve game packs. Galaxy pack. Star pack. Meteor pack. They give some bonuses like extractors and PLEX. 
---
Better question is what do you like doing? What skills would you need to do that better?

If you want to seperate your ammo from the loot after selecting "select all", simply hold left-CTRL on your keyboard and left click on your ammo. This way you can drag all your loot to the hangar without dragging your ammo along with it.
---
You set up additional overview tabs. You can customize them through the in game menus, or you can download a custom overview from in game channels.
---
Which is not as bad as it sounds.
---
Then you can have separate tabs for combat vs exploration or whatever you're doing.
---
Actually TEST &amp; FRT didn’t engage each other.

Or simply add a comment section ?
---
This will be wild and bloody, but that's what is eve. 
---
i love you lol, that videogives me chills every time
---
things have changed since the Stainfraggin coalition though.
---
the most recent invasion attempts have been from the FRT space. it's a much better invasion point as you get to hit all the krabs in Immensea, Impass, Feyth etc
---
invading catch doesn't give you anything nowadays apart from a bunch of AUTZ timers. also allows goons to get to the fight faster.
---
You can buy these once, then never again for the rest of your EVE career. 
---
Different gameplay entirely, partly why it's enjoyable. The big thing is that nullsec has stagnated itself (intentionally for many regions). That's part of the problem. But yeah, definitely more enjoyable.
---
&gt;  If that's not your thing thats fine,
---
It's not that i can't or don't want to fly T2 doctrines its that i cant afford it.
---
&gt;I personally enjoy it because its high risk and high reward,
---
Afaik there can be no reward. Only if the fight was fun in and of itself, there can only be losses.
---
WHY THE FUCK PLEX GOTTA COST MONEY
---
Ok so do you think your opponents enjoyed losing as much as you enjoyed winning?
---
Dent, your ironic flair is backfiring xD
---
To be fair you have to have a pretty high IQ to understand these memes. My classmate was trying to explain them to me and I only got some of it. That student? Albert Einstein.
---
If they were to waste time on something like this I would rather then make the certificate system non shit by having people who actually play the game make it. A skill tree in this game would be a horrible, unreadable and messy thing.
---
What's the global (IRL) economy like? Any countries with players who can no longer afford subs because the exchange rates tanked?
---
Your alliance is rich and filled with turbokrabs, ask them to reimburse your shit and they probably will so you can just self destruct out
---
Barring that just get a ceptor with probes and find a wormhole or wait till there's a good thera connection. Or do the long march, might wind up easier.
---
Correct, for anyone reading this - these galaxy packs regularly go on sale for under $50 at some point I even bought one for $40 on GMG, wait for a sale to get most of the value
---
They seemed to have fun. And I can say that we had a blast against novac, even though we lost. You're not gonna win this one man. What you seem to be after literally isn't possible in eve. There's always a winner and a loser, either isk war or objective or morale. i guess you could consign yourself to 2v2 caracal fights and have one side each lose a caracal and call it fun, but that's about the closest you're gonna get to what you seem to be after.
---
I know this is hard to believe, but win or lose, fights (at least the ones I've been in in wh space) tend to be pretty fun.

Give the Eris more CPU and PG, remove one high slot (the launcher hardpoint) and give it a medium slot.  
---
Leave the rest of it as it is.
---
Fuckin aye. 
---
no, they don't
---
not since September 
---
Freelancer?
---
That was a really fun fight, on of our upcoming fcs took that. Its great to see you guys fielding good sized comps. Gf
---
As opposed to.... what?
---
Can confirm. Trying to force 1000 people thru those gates caused no less than 53 casualties at Derelik traffic control (10-12 Minutes for some of the tunnels is accurate, Im not sure the node was reinforced)
---
Can I have your ship?
---
Every ship i lose represents hours of my time spent to field it. A Hecate takes about an hour and a half. An Eagle about 12 hours. A Ferox about 2. I can't imagine seeing fun watching all the hours i spent working hard to field one ship going up in flames in a curbstomp battle.
---
Ooooo sexy
---
The correct way to fly the Eris is to drop your launcher and roleplay as a Hecate to spook people when they think you're flying a meme dictor
---
C4 gives people a false sense of benefit, double the static does not mean double the content. When no one lives in c3 and you cant field the larger spicier fleets like c5, they pretty worthless tbh. Corps go to c4 for a false sense of security and many eventually die.

You haven't even finished the pvp tutorial with numbers like that

Oh, so now you want the titans crushing actually good fights?

I think regularly is an overstatement vOv tbh. But worth waiting for :)
---
I'm getting that old man "When I was a kid PLEX was a quarter!" feeling lately.
---
Time to start a hauling corp.
---
then go play wow. if you're afraid of loss, and you're measuring your fun in isk/hour, this might not be the best place. 
---
To me, though, it just sounds like you just don't want to lose. Some folks just can't handle someone else being better than them, and that's amplified in eve where one person being better than another not only hurst the losers' ego, but also costs them resources, be it time, money or assets. But you're trying to justify not wanting to lose behind "bu bu bu muh time spent farming!!!"
---
if it takes you 12 hours to farm an eagle (which is absurd, if you can fly an eagle you can fly something that can run abyssals and make at least 50-100 mil an hour, a well fitted eagle is what, 300 mil?) then don't fly an eagle. fly something you can farm up in 20 minutes. Or, you know, don't farm at all, give ccp 5$ and get enough isk to pvp for the month if you're flying cheap ships.

*The Fools!* They ignored all the signs!

I don't get it?!

Me either. Are data sites really that worthless?
---
&gt;  if you're afraid of loss,
---
I'm not afraid of loss. I'm just having trouble teasing out what is supposed to be fun about loss.
---
&gt; you're measuring your fun in isk/hour, this might not be the best place.
---
I've turned to data i can measure when my feelings have failed me.
---
&gt;To me, though, it just sounds like you just don't want to lose.
---
I'm not seeing the fun in losing, and i don't see any fun to be had in winning overwhelmingly.
---
&gt;if it takes you 12 hours to farm an eagle 
---
All i've got is my VNI, and the best systems are camped so i can't rat there so instead of making around 60mil/hr i'm making around 45mil/hr. 
---
&gt;(which is absurd, if you can fly an eagle you can fly something that can run abyssals and make at least 50-100 mil an hour, a well fitted eagle is what, 300 mil?)
---
Fitted doctrine eagle is 550mil.
---
&gt;fly something you can farm up in 20 minutes.
---
That means T1 meta fit cruisers that just die.
---
&gt;Or, you know, don't farm at all, give ccp 5$ and get enough isk to pvp for the month if you're flying cheap ships.
---
I live on a fixed income, i'm permanently disabled. I cannot leave my home without assistance from my personal support worker. I can't just drop more money on my entertainment. That's why i sub to EVE and wow.
---
My corp had a lovable retired irish guy.  One day he got drunk and welped every single one of his ships into an enemy force of 30. One at a time, solo, for an hour.

Sure,its their way, but they just have to remember that at some point somebody might backstab them and delete their super fleet just because of their history.

Right, I thought that might be the case - it just seems a bit odd that the client allows me to play while not connected to the chat servers.

I'm not unhappy tho. I'm having what i would say is a reasonable amount of fun. But there is no shortage of people lining up to remind me that i am the cancer killing EVE and that wormhole space is so much better and i am trying to understand.

Determine what you’re interested in and find a Corp that best suits that. I know you’re just starting out so things can seem real far off and probably confusing, but a solid group for you to learn from will carry your enthusiasm for years to come.

Welp, I've come to a point where plex is twice as expensive as when I started. I know some people have had 300M plexes, but still.

Local is based on ingame system, not chat, or at least that's what they claimed.

Idk how that works when chat outages break local.

it's the same trap that goons avoided in 93PI.. the make belive kind

Data sites are generally considered ''worthless'' (With the exception of the ghost sites (if those are data sites at all)).

Relic sites is where the real money is at in exploration.

He's not talking about those wars. He's talking about the FRT-TEST conflict prior to Panfam joining.  
---
Also, During the northern deployment and the "trader war" TEST didn't bat phone goons until after horde called in NC. and PL.
---
Do we realise the game will die if people don't pay real money to subscribe? I hope plex quadruples in cost.
---
Military experts are calling this a cynosural field.

It is.

I started my gameplay in WH - before Nullsec.         
---
The problem with WH for 'my kind of player'  is lack of local and when you have family and RL ... you have to go away every 10-20min or have longer unexpected breaks.         
---
Without ability to see what is on local and what is happening around ...or by having so short reinforce timers ... like you cannot sanely play the game.           
---
EVE have aged ... but we also.

1,000.00 ISK won't get you far in the realm of exotic male dancers, so if you expect someone with abs all you'll get is me with a beer gut full of hair

couldnt you move one fleet at a time with 1 system between fleets? or isnt that faster
---
Imicus or helios from the side.
---
buy PLEX with cash if you can afford it since it's probably the most ISK/hr u can make right now depending on where you live.
---
Then enjoy the game, do whatever you want, flirt with russian hisec miners who don't understand english in local chat, see how much you can test the patience of newbie corps pretending to be bad at the game, solo battleships in FW lowsec (ok maybe not)... enjoy eve :\^)
---
Or talk to the explorers in your alliance and wait for a suitable wormhole connection. 
---
That's a fair point. Even an exotic timeshare might not get me very far. As for this 'gut full of hair,' what would I have to pay to see you regurgitate a hair ball while say wearing some neko ears?

Too high colesterol.

So why comment?

Wouldn't many smaller fleets from multiple areas converging be better? Or is that already done?

A game too slow, too expensive (by irl money/month or in game time to buy plex), well it seems I will still win eve for some time...
---
It's honestly much less of a headache to kill kritsan in a short-range ship because you can just orbit 500 and they can't hit you, even with no capacitor. It takes less time and is a good introduction to spiraling in and the mechanics involved (transversal, tracking).

Or to just upgrade to a cruiser and roll face.

Sounds like a personal problem

But they did get Goons to come just in case any heavy lifting was needed.
---
Rawr
---
Psa, use caldari navy. Its superior to "guristas" ammo, but equal to "dread guristas" ammo.
---
Hey knowing your mistake is the first step for improvement :P
---
try it one time, its actually kind of hilarious to watch someone trying to remain patient with you when youre doing everything wrong and being a cute newbee
---
Just don't go then. Do something else you enjoy instead. I promise you, them missing one ferox in a sea of feroxes isn't going to change the tide of the staring contest.
---
I do do everything wrong...and I am a newbie...
---
Ahhh the satisfaction of seeing the salt flow due to neutrals playing the game
---
true, but l live in null and there is more then enough solo content out there to be had as well as large scale content
---
for my self l do like dipping into lowsec  to kill silly miners that mine there but l like the idea of  this is npc space (hisec) and the is player space (null)  and not to have a half/half space it would push more small scale pvp content into null which would be better less focus on the null blocks or BB giving out the only content there 
---
doesnt really help since tidi is constelation wide i believe
---
Begun the bot war has
---
Same old same old really heh. What you up to nowadays?
---
I was kind of hoping to see Tugen's rorqual death on here. I'm disappointed. 
---
Can i have your corpse?
---
I completely lost my shit reading this. Bravo. 
---
"I'm addicted to this game" - fixed it for you :)
---
wtf how dare big entities use their assets game is literally dead
---
I want to be you
---
Yeah man, 8 second window in any chance of all but the field risked more thinking it kinda is literally not having to claim that if it was anything other alliances that was anything other than anything other assets being retards, I'll stop pretending like assets shows a mutual defense pact with no one who can't afford to form works.
---
Tidi is node wide but you have no real way of knowing which systems are on the same node. You can take a 'guess' but there's no 100% way of knowing 
---
Small decided transport ships should be made by Interbus
---
What if they added blockade runners dst yachts or rorquals?
---
Because we want to! Because we want to! 
---
That’s an awesome 10hour video! Keep’em coming!
---
The saying thrown around a lot in our corp is "we learn with our wallets." When we lose a fight, or do something stupid/wrong a lose a ship (be it a pve rattlesnake or a Rorq or a 20 bil freighter) that we have now learned what we did wrong and thus what we can do differently next time.
---
 It just means we have to go farm a bit more to be ready. Our ships are there to be used. Losing this round makes us better for the next one
---
oh
---
I hope we dont lose a faction titan for 2 titans
---
Alright lets do this the scientific way. 
---
What is your sp amount?
---
On a scale from 1 to 10(10 is most) how much do you enjoy pvp?
---
same question just pve?
---
and same question just this time scanning?
---
That's true if you only have one account, but there are no issues using a pack on a new account, selling the stuff that comes with it, then using the character for something useful
---
What makes that Titan a ”ratting titan”?
---
Serious question.
---
I wish I was this fun blackout drunk
---
In other assets being a titan and ham fisting a mutual defense pact with providence since then all work. 
---
lmao, ok bud, you avoid 80% of catch me something other than that hard.  The point of vily cowardice.
---
HAW guns, bosonic and serious npc damage on killmail.
---
He was ratting
---
Do you have your overview to show all abyss NPC's?  I once died to time not realizing there was a stray NPC that decided to go to the far end of the screen.  Wasn't on my overview, and when I finally caught it, time went out. 
---
Not saying yours couldn't actually be a glitch though. 
---
Yeah let's ignore the test superfleet sitting just 2 mids away
---
Didn't take Nine Continent to show up on where KB's and justify why they kicked from Imperium. Was this a move Op or baited?
---
Props to Origin for dropping titans in hostile space! Can't say no to that kind of action!
---
Thanks
---
Bots need something to keep them going 
---
I am usually more on PanFam's side of things but you just created a new meme  
---
"One thing Panfam has maintained since creation is its ability to keep its word"
---
So like PL was since Dominion patch leak exploiting ?
---
I think init expected Test supers to be nearby
---
Most of Test's bluelist is nominally neutral on the overview so it can get confusing.  Only pre-arranged honourable fights are allowed.
---
probably upset about how much he has to use that safe ratting space to make enough money to plex these days
---
Lol, T2 Damage Control.
---
Too bad plays bud. Vily appears to fire them where they were. They crushed the fight went in the fact goons evol comes back, if it really have never made a fight is your fanfiction is spinning for the FAX FIT TYPE
---
nah maybe they will go elite and do jackdaw fleets, works especially well on agreed Frigate brawls ....
---
Yeah, that's the part I don't get.  Why not GigX after we'd committed and then guarantee both us and INIT would feed a shitload of caps?
---
kil2 (aka rise) really pioneered the "strategy box" technique that i've been thinking about switching to, having done some youtube annotations on a couple videos in the past
---
basically he just covered up his chats with a box and put text notes in it while the video played, where in your (and my) videos there's just a phage
---
People fit astero like idiots, its a great little pvp frigate, but ppl fit stabs, inertia's,.... Use a fuckin covops if you only intend to run!
---
No you're not, you're gonna hit F1 like you were always going to do. 
---
Smh test alliance
---
They were kicked because goons blacklisted their recruiters and FCs, twice, despite them being a pretty big contributor to goons.
---
DOn't see it anywh....oooh. 
---
90 day game time cards for 300 mill was the cheapest we ever had afaik. Of course back then we made like 20 mill an hour chaining battleships in asteroid belts.
---
shhhhh It only says we used dreads.
---
Well, you were doing good in your first sentence....then you ruined it.
---
Dropped a few bill... so what have I missed...
---
A lot of people who die quietly when they could be saved are just too shy to speak up on comms, so I believe what you say is true.  
---
Even HED-GP is never camped these days.
---
About step 2, if you keep at range at 2250 of the can, you can hack as your data/relic module has 2500m range *and* cloak as you're further than 2 km. You'll still fail the hack as you unlock everything when you cloak, but you cloak one or two ticks earlier.
---
That's probably true.
---
Because I was specifically asked.  If someone asks you a question, do you not answer them?  He asked me what to do with ISK, I said I was not a good person to ask.
---
Spearfishing with Taloses. Please dear god someone try it.
---
it's XIX, what do you want from them?
---
and this action push NINE CONTINNENT to the WC side.
---
They seem rather unwilling to discuss why they wanted to ratfuck us.
---
Not that it matters.
---
I thought they were blacklisted for being in/fighting with Frat, krabbing in Delve.
---
That's pretty disingenious. You act like there aren't krabs in wspace. 
---
Maybe they don't like scanning, or dealing with chains, and would rather casually roam with mates and f1 monkey. Maybe they like using their super/titan in their alliance. 
---
Don't pretend being wh btw somehow makes you a better eve player, or you're more elite, or that others are just krabs. Christ. 
---
I see what ou did there.
---
Shines didn't say who he spoke to, if it was Vily, PGL or somome else. 
---
That's not how tidi works sadly, without the tidi the fleet would have been murdered before reinforcements showed up
---
There are 248 ships from just the 4 main factions.  Counting the faction ships it brings us to exactly 300 ships in the ship tree.  This does not take into consideration AT ships and a few other one off ships, as they are not listed in the ship tree.
---
People saying something all the time doesn't necessarily make that something correct.
---
\*rubs hands in ferengi\*
---
Idk if you're a troll or a tard.
---
Wh fights tend to be, though not always, winner takes all. Either you win or you don't. 
---
It's not like in null, where you'll alpha each other until someone runs out of alpha and they lose. 
---
Look at hk/hawks for example. Both are good corps, they were #1 and #2 corp, but most of their fights would either be 90-10 or similar, regardless of who won. It's not being outclassed, outshipped, out-implanted, blobbed, etc. Just the way those fights tend to go. 
---
wh brawls come down hard on the fax breakpoint, you can have an hour long fight that's constantly back and forth but as soon as you topple the reps the entire fleet is fucked.
---
don't presume they're trading like feroxes, there's a reason the faxes are expensive.
---
They where kicked becaus most of their members had alts in FRT.
---
Good. The less blue balls, the better 
---
Why is INIT sheilding Snuff in the first place who screwed TEST? 
---
I do cosplay while playing, I sit nekid in a tub of jelly with a pipe hanging out my ass.
---
Move in with us. we'll drop another fort and name it bird house or smthing so you can be independent but still with us &lt;3
---
When we were living with Red Alliance in Period Basis I always wondered why they kept that corporation around. It was one of the most guilty botting corps in that coalition for sure, I saw (and reported) a dozen or so characters in the corp for botting. As you can see, [they don't really contribute](https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98535449/) much value to the alliance being basically just awox, ratting/mining losses, and of course, likely VNI bots dying. But hey, in the botter wars (RED vs FRT), I don't care which group loses, so long as they both lose some shit.
---
Good job
---
Good job Frat.
---
Y'know, if all you're saying is true, leave brave, join actual TEST.
---
I don't like TEST, but you'll get better SRP, and so you'll be able to take losses with it hurting less.
---
If you're staying in brave, join #brave-hole-divers on slack. While the fleets aren't super common, they're much better isk than what you're making. 
---
thanks joe
---
This. 
---
Goons alone outnumbered Panfam. 
---
okay enjoy your armor t3cs with leshaks
---
The hacking module has a range of 5 km, so you can sit even further from the can. It's looting that has a range of 2.5 km, so if you want to be able to instantly loot after completing a hack, sitting between 2 km and 2.5 km is a good idea. If you don't mind boating over to the can after hacking, you can park at a greater distance.
---
In any case, staying more than 2 km away so you can cloak is the most important thing to remember.
---
I have no idea about their relations. 
---
CCP got paid for it, and already spent it. Good chunk of it anyways if not everything long long ago. There are people in game hoarding incredible amounts of plex from so many years back its not funny, I hoard just a little bit, enough to sub 4 toons for about 4 years or liquidate some and maybe buy something nice.
---
On a side note, its gonna be glorious when all those multi Rorqs, multi everything are finally gonna have to start paying their own subs, or dig deep into their pockets and seed the market themselves if they want plex. 
---
Its gonna be so glorious, time to bust out some popcorn.
---
Pets never do. 
---
Sometimes, just sometimes, doing the right thing can overcome differences in politics and ambitions.
---
And that thing is fuck Snuff. Well done TEST.
---
Tackle+hammer setup is the best I think.
---
For a scout/tackle/scanner, a 3/3 layout bomber (preferably Purifier) armor buffer tank with trimark rigs is 10k tank, maybe a damp (longer time to lock = longer time tackle is alive esp on larger targets).
---
If you can reship after scanning the chain, definitely an interceptor.
---
Plus some kind of "hammer" combat ship. Probably a battlecruiser (including T1 insurance) or cruiser. This is what determines what you can actually kill. It doesn't need to cloak.
---
You can leave the hammer on the other side of a WH.
---
So you're saying that if you declare that your nationality will band together to extinguish another nationality then maybe, just maybe, the target side will also feel some national pride? Huh.
---
Perfect example of eft warriors trying to pretend they pvp
---
wormhole groups tend to comp heavy on logi since they fly blingier ships (generally to squeeze the most bang for the kg out of the mass of the holes they travel through), and the number of dps ships is way lower in wh fights than in null as well, also due to mass limits, and the general limitation of how many people can survive living together in one wormhole contributes as well, for all but the largest groups who can support separate bearholes
---
the heavy logi comp, the blingier fits, the lower dps numbers, and the emphasis on tanky comps with cap warfare means that often the two sides will sit and shoot each other with no real result for several minutes until one side starts breaking, then the fight rapidly ends with one side losing a lot of ships then cheesing it for the exit hole while trying to roll it behind them and keep the enemies from following. as a result, really well-matched wormhole brawls tend to look pretty one-sided on killboards after the fact
---
with the numbers nullsec warfare sees, even if you're flying carrier fleets it's possible to get volleyed by enough maelstroms before reps land (this is real, i have video proof of it happening in a real tranquility fight). most groups are running around on stratops with fuckoff huge ferox or battleship fleets, so large that trading is inevitable no matter how many logi you comp. trading as an inevitability in null fights means that 40-60% efficiency is more indicative of a closer fight in null
---
Goons won't care. From their point of view, thinking about it further just takes time away from spod.
---
Snuffed won't care because goons will tell them not to care. They'll sob to themselves for a minute, then wipe their tiny squinty eyes and fall in behind goons like the brave little soldiers they are.
---
Init will care. They'll rant and cry and throw the toys out of the pram. Nobody will notice.
---
good income from botting corp i guess
---
welcome to r/eve , a place where you can be downvoted for asking a question AND a place where you can be downvoted for answering a question. a magical place
---
i feel like there's a case to be made that, even without analyzing comps and tactics, having an advantage of several hundred subcaps over the other side, *and* being in system first, means you are gonna decisively win that subcap fight (eventually, holy shit the tidi) at which point the supers are kinda just there and whether or not they die depends on whether or not you have hics left
---
it being camal, rekkingcrew's keepstar of all groups it could have possibly been, i imagine they have piles and piles and *piles* of hictors ready to go in a corp hangar either there somewhere very nearby
---
Well, this makes sense. I do think you would get the results you anticipate. 
---
...eh? :D
---
Translation: third-world country plex rmt farms offline
---
it has been shown several times that citadels can relatively easily be killed even against determined defenders by an attacker who's willing to pay the price to do so
---
init killed the q-e keepstar against panfam's entire supercap fleet by using boosh ravens. what stopped them from doing that in camal?
---
That's also true. What does that have to do with jaguars?
---
hey you playing again?
---
just imagine if snuff spent half the time and effort actually doing shit in eve as opposed to gatecamping tama, dropping supers on 30 man alliances in pure blind and derelik and shitposting on reddit
---
Okay, I was just joking about this. Not sure what to think about Trig Capitals... Could you give me links to those pictures?
---
It's RA's loss for kicking all their chinese corps, besides I wouldn't allow these corps in anyway.
---
Do you actually listen to and apply advice? Because some people don't .__.
---
the jump geography from derelik and curse into catch is horrific
---
detorid into tenerifis and immensea is waaay better
---
kick progod first imo, no gods no masters no streamers
---
"Why won't snuff and Init feed us their titans?" 
---
Is there an eve race going on? If so Im excited.
---
Ah, another GotG member I see.
---
Test loosing Reddit supremacy. I loved that one 
---
Looks like a good brawl. Nice one guys. 
---
we 1000% would have been willing to work with tapi behind closed doors and red wedding some snuff supercaps
---
remember in the catch invasion when we teamed up with goons to dunk that brave fortizar anchoring timer and dread bomb the fuck out of co2?
---
pl doesn't hold grudges against organizations, just a few individual dumbos who we like to see fail occasionally
---
Weird. I go on fleets while dual boxing a miner and forget about him regularly, only to realize it an hour or 2 later when I see him sitting in space with a full ore hold and my lasers off.
---
as if 2017 wasn't proof enough of the fact that tapi doesn't give a fuck about provibloc, let me recap:
---
* pl and rc successfully invaded and took every station in providence, winning timer fight after timer fight against provibloc  
---
* a provibloc group decided during that campaign would be a fun time to drop a keepstar without telling anyone and it got slam-fucking-dunked  
---
* tapi sent fleets in occasionally, and even brought their supers up once or twice, but made no serious moves to significantly aid provi's defense of their space  
---
* once provi were completely displaced to lowsec and had virtually no will to fight left, and once the patch changes turning stations into faction fortizars were formally announced, tapi went into provi and captured all the stations for themselves
---
tapi *never* gave a fuck about provi and never will
---
any port in a storm
---
and it's kind of always storming for provibloc
---
Hello Armor rag

/r/dataisbeautiful ?
---
If those imps are worth so much then get a luxury yacht from somewhere and get home with it 
---
&gt; Panfam and TEST have a working relationship as adversaries
---
we know who's who. it's very clear where we stand, to each other
---
"what makes you think that the fact you can kite well". mate, if i can kite well, you should be required to "tackle well" to catch me not just press ur approach and adcu buttons at me. what's the fucking point in me flying my ship (kite) if you rambois can approach and scram with 0 ability requirement???
---
Nö reimbursement for private imps. How do you think we keep being rich?

---
Fights are wayyyyy more frequent in WH space than I ever experienced in a null block.
---
Unless you consider structure bashing a "fight", of course.
---
If I ever find someone that gives me advice I’ll be sure to follow it! 
---
Id pay top keks to see this
---
As we can see from list of corps joining FRT...
---
If you have some real life money to spend on it now, but you want to sustain yourself from ingame in the long run, I would suggest deciding what you would like to be your main ISK maker, and invest in that. For example, I spent some real money to get my first carrier, that I could then use to farm for everything else. But you can spend to jumpstart your industry or hauling operation, etc.
---
The great savior downtime is near!
---
Why does Matterall looks so sad all the time?
---
I think test has a much more sizable titam fleet these days. (+ dreads)
---
I have seen many tears about its tank on the Eve forums, so full of salt.
---
Judging over last year id say they laid the hammer down, and all the way to b-r PL has always dropped their shit for the gfs.
---
I'd argue it's the other way around. What allows the Test/Goon relationship to work is that the leadership of both alliances trust the other to keep their word. By reinforcing the idea that their diplomatic clout is more important then free keepstar kills, Test also reinforces all current agreements between Test and Goonswarm.
---
the node was reinforced and even with 1200 dudes in the system there was no tidi. For sure there would have been when the fight kicks off but lets say just 1k subcaps + 100 Titans with fax Support.... and we would have started eating shit very quick. when Test would have then wanted to escalate further for example and bring more Supers and Titans... the Snuff titans had already loaded grid and where fully ready to react... 
---
they even could simply just moonwalk away... i mean its lowsec no bubbeles around and even some 50+ hics burning in those titans would just have died by 1k subcaps raping them...
---
they get more money from plex sales than game time sales retard
---
You do know that each new kill that is pulled fucks the BR up again, right?
---
To feed?
---
Poached a lot of members, to boot. 
---
Did the same with FCON and (kinda)CO2 and XIX, too.
---
"Oh no we are sorry that hard times have befallen you, our allies who we offered so little material assistance to but supported endlessly on the reddits -- remember that TEST is still your friend and you are more than welcome to join us!"
---
seriously
---
/u/hyperspatialvelocity no gods :dagger: no masters
---
To make it clear - the complaint here is that highly specialized fit built for one specific purpose while sacrificing literally everything else is somehow considered overtuned?
---
It at least looks nice and simplistic. 
---
i've been saying this for ages
---
tapi are so painfully two-faced when dealing with allies, they use their "friends" when it suits them, help them when it's easy and doesn't cost them anything, then when it starts getting difficult they hang them out to dry then cannibalize the useful people and supercaps
---
it was Kelmac, who was the muninn fleet FC. Who didn't have the full picture in a shifting situation unfortunatly. 
---
That's funny as test didn't just stab snuffed out over 1 titan and 1 super but The Initiative/Imperium over from 100 titans/Super+. I hope the war startes soon 🤞😁
---
Triggered
---
This is pretty slick :D 
---
In heavy tidi test can move cap and super fleets into range even from their staging and arrive in time to drop.
---
Freud is a bitch. ;)
---
Have a good monday anyway!
---
oh, can I have the NC super fleet? Pretty please? I'd love to gamble with that!
---
Stay afk
---
Tapi were working against imperium. The situation is blurry, but i don't think the relation to snuff the point imperium is upset about.
---
We aren't there yet, INIT is too strong for SNUFF to backstab atm, but it will happen. It's inevitable.
---
Life is full of irony.
---
Unless you know exactly how to use it to dock from an insta-dock bookmark
---
&gt; always dropped their shit for the gfs.
---
Because the win was assured with total Supercap dominance and without fatigue. PLs way down started initially with Phoebe jumprange changes.
---
I only ever play in the last 2 mins before blackout drunk. I had a rattlesnake last a week!!! ...
---
Completely afk rorqual dies.
---
was he afk/sleeping?
---
anyway, good catch
---
big if tru
---
See rorqual don't need a nerf they die so easily !
---
God dam TRYRM

REEE WHY WONT TAPI LET US HAVE OUR FREE KILLMAIL.
---
Autopilot is a cyno alt's best friend.
---
Who can ask for a better strategic team than Vily and PGL - the possiblities are endless lmao
---
WOW
---
i always use auto pilot when moving new alphas from the start system to jita and they never die.
---
Zeroniss trying to be relevant with a twitch tv link... lmao
---
Vily never change, you are the gift that keeps on giving
---
He just logged out after the excavators died.
---
Logged out after the excavators died.
---
It is never about a PVE rorqual, carrier or a super ... but about what will come to save it.          
---
Currently people are "ccp is going for nerfs, and we gonna wreck all those raters all around eve" ... well no. Where people formed they will form again and save stuff.         
---
Nothing will change for big players only few small groups will die out as they are unable to do stuff after the nerf.       
---
Those people will again fold into bigger organizations making them stronger. 
---
The world's flat, vaccinations cause autism and Trump is doing a great job.... right? Idiot.
---
Autopilot is forbidden by **player imposed law**.       
---
This is sand box where players are major players - who cares about some dumb NPC laws?     
---
Because they may do some other awox for you somewhere?
---
No fewer than FIVE CONVOES
---
I just use the Boeing 737 Max 8 Autopilot. Haven’t had a problem.
---
this is what happens when all you do is farm CVA for years, your brain literally turns to mush
---
I think that's against the tos, but I'm not sure
---
"Small groups" cannot already save their rorquals, mostly because they anyway are either pets or renters. Those in Delve could have no panic and no tan and they could still be saved, but it's fine. The rest in between is what matters, and nerfing rorquals will make those rorquals die more easily.
---
And anyway they also nerfed rorqual mining yield, so it will impact larger groups anyway.
---
Im not saying they werent opressive, im saying on mamy ocassions pl has dropped the hammer and even lost, still decided to do it without overwhelming odds
---
You should be prosecuted for crimes against the English language dear lord
---
Glad to see you're as edgy as always lol. Hope you've been well.
---
No amount of hallucinogenics can make camping Provi for three years  seem skill'ed m8
---
You sure it wasnt a dc?
---
Yeah just let Brisc's meme-Gestapo at it, they'll sort it out.
---
buff rorquals and excavators! 4 frigs and 1 dessy shouldnt be able to do dis. when will ccppls finally realize.
---
idk but vni kept feeding so they couldve known, couldve saved it.
---
but they didnt.
---
Fuckin weird... good kill then
---
Vily has no fewer than "FIVE CONVOES" that confirm this
---
That's how you get awox'd.
---
Bart - it took 15 min to extract back to deployment system and then we logged off for the night to play tarkov. I know your brain is a bit mushy from killing provi only for three years but even you would have known if we moved back to Raka lmao
---
I sometimes use it to move alts without implants in cheap ships.
---
Got caught a few times in null but that's it.
---
I fly the Jag regularly and there are a lot of things it does not do well.  They are:
---
Brawl at zero with anything better than a blaster cruiser.
---
Kill dessys (even most T1).
---
Survive for more than 30 seconds.
---
Kill garmurs and drams that have a clue.
---
Have DPS (you can get about 160 without gimping your fit.  That's very poor)
---
The Jag is a purely anti-kyte platform.  It's designed to tackle a kite cruiser or slow frig that only has a point.  If something actually has a web then the Jag melts.
---
Look at my KB. I almost exclusively fly the Jag: https://zkillboard.com/character/413063017/
---
The only reason I have the kills that I do is that I hold down kite frigs, dessys, and cruisers long enough for my buddies to jump on them as well.
---
Also, I'm assuming the reason why you are so butthurt is because you have lost your oh-so-shiny kite cruiser to a 45 mil Jag + gang.
---
TL;DR: the Jag is balanced as an anti-kyte platform.  It doesn't do anything else well.
---
NO FEWER THAN FIVE CONVOES
---
Those are the tears which fuel spaceships...
---
They tried to, we just found out 1 second before we were about to jump Titans.
---
Doesn't that imply you paid with real money? How does one unsub from using PLEX?
---
If so, what are PLEX prices to you?
---
NC posters aren't usually the most informed - don't waste your breath
---
Does economics work the other way? Less isk farming means lower Plex prices?
---
Kiki OP?
---
thx fam
---
wat?
---
And probably because CCP hasn't had a big sale on PLEX or Galaxy packs since Pearl Abyss bought them out. 
---
That's always what kept plex prices in line. Didn't even take 8 months for plex value to go up 33%.
---
That is because some people are unable to see anything outside grid they're on, and can't fathom that - before roaming - you have more than enough tools and information to check where you are going, what you can expect and think about how you can prepare for what you'll fight against. Whining about no skill, Q-click and scram, easymode kiting hardcounter boils down to nanogangs being outprepared by a person with ongrid piloting skill reduced to Q-click scram spamming and pressing ADC at proper moment; I don't think that's something I would talk openly about.
---
And CCP use to have 40% off sales on these items, which kept plex prices in line. 
---
&gt; losing Afk vni's
---
Lol right
---
Yeah, that was the last sale, but depending on what currency you use, GMG is very expensive in their exchange rates (5-15% higher than standard exchange rates). Thankfully they are using more currencies, but trying to convert CAD into anything on there was a massive ripoff.
---
They use to be very regular. Like a few weeks a month.
---
Well, I died on my way back from Jita, so...
---
It's not like everyone pointed out that this will happen as soon as they announced skill injectors.
---
Going straight to zkill
---
there is speculation that ccp also sells seized plex/buys plex with seized isk to manipulate the market, but i don't think they've ever confirmed or denied it
---
Perseus Kallistratos wading in with the morning after damage control posting.
---
There is always a Corp that's very lacks with their background checks. 
---
No. I’m talking about rmt. They sell plex for way cheaper and more people buy that so plex prices drop ingame. Then when these farms get busted the supply of plex is limited so the price rises. I’m not saying it’s all due to rmt but it plays a role for sure.
---
But the yield nerfs also affect the smaller groups as well so nothing has really changed. 
---
What, ships dying?
---
Taking AFK mining a bit to seriously
---
I would argue that suicide atrons are definitely a half-measure.  I would also agree that damps are a half-measure because it doesn't actually kill the kite gang, it just makes disengaging a more attractive option.
---
Ceptors with scrams can only briefly hold down a platform that uses rapid lights - one of the most popular kite platforms - making it very similar to the atron.
---
The "option of flying a similarly built gang" is just an N+1 argument.
---
TL;DR: kyte gangs need a hard counter. The Jag is it.
---

---
Yeah that's not a bad name actually 
---
So, this keepstar kill was basically just a fight for fun/snuff ding snuff stuff right? Init's objective here was only to help snuff and secure another keepstar kill (Init doing Init stuff). Init are doing this as a independant entity for content. Goons involvement looks to be to whore on a keepstar kill and shoot stuff as a third party.
---
Test have a cordial relationship with Goon, a neutral/negative with INIT, a negative relationship Panfam/FRT and 'hate' snuff?
---
Since this keepstar doesn't have strategic value to the Imperium, theres no fault with test deploying just to ruin Snuffs fun? Snuff themselves seem to understand this and don't really care. Init seem to think this is some grave betrayal. Personally thought it was simple, you are on the side of their enemy, fighting over a non strategic objective... Your going to get shot.
---
I admit to being suprised myself, but understand it. Also kinda happy that TAPI choose their own way instead of being forced on a side they didn't want.
---
More like war dec &gt; see NPC miner/mission runner/freighter &gt; try to shake him awake &gt; repeat until successful.
---
Yes but this never was about making smaller groups have more chance against bigger economically.
---
I had to come back to this and give you credit. Apparently, I was the retarded one.  They totally fucked us lol.
---
Note to self: when CCP makes an ambiguous statement, err on the side of them not being generous. 
---
Keep in mind that you can't dscan cloaked bombers :)
---
Warp to star if you think you are in trouble.
---
That's exactly what CCP was hoping you would say
---
Horde line member here about to commit treason.  I have secret docs signed by Gobbins stating we moved our staging from O-V to BWF because this one guy who shits up local was just more than Horde can handle.  Next week, the old BEANSTAR will be renamed Xenuria's house as a tribute so we don't have to face the overwhelming force that is Xenuria.
---
what even is the camal keep? and why do people reee about it 
---
Jita-Rens/Hek autopiloters who set prefer shorter are the players I'm most thankful to in the whole game.
---
The Jag has really good speed, great tank (for 30 seconds) and poor to very poor DPS. It is really good at surviving long enough to close range to a cruiser or frigate that is very fast (3k m/s+), has good mid-range DPS (~40k range), and a light tank.  The Jag then lands a scram, allowing the slower ships in the fleet to catch up to the now immobilized cruiser/frigate.
---
Right now, the meta (what everybody is doing because the strategy works) is to fly these cruisers previously described.
---
Now that the Jag has come along people are upset because there is actually a direct counter to the kyte cruiser.
---
CCP actually designed the Jag to do exactly what I have described.  People are just mad about it. 
---
&gt; but what does ram stand for?
---
After the Assault Frigate changes, the Jaguar and Wolf became particularly good for shield and armor tackle, respectively, owing to a large amount of either mids (Jag) or lows (Wolf) and their high base speed.  Hence, the Ram Jag and Dive Wolf were born.
---
Ron Swanson is my spirit animal so this must be followed to the fullest extent.
---
If you like stealth bombers and cloakies then you should consider wormhole groups or hunting groups! I’m partial to WiNGSPAN Delivery Services myself!
---
You can travel to 1-SMEB through all lowsec and maybe highsec. At least you will learn how to keep your pod alive from smartbombers on your way home.
---
Unless this is a bait thread, but I take blue baits anyways.
---
Goons were thrown under the bust tbf..
---
Snuff called the whole of TAPImperium for help.
---
Init moved their super fleet from Fountain across the whole galaxy, Test declared hostility towards Snuff over a betrayal, so they sided with the defenders, Goons came in in a couple of subcap fleets to eat shit at tye doorstep of Camala in 2 hours long TiDi massacre.
---
I almost feel sorry for them.
---
Indeed you do
---
That's a lovely story you're telling yourself.

The amusing thing is that many will believe this. I know you don't.
---
Too soon?

This is like the start of Fight Club. Eventually your alter ego will bring down every coalition in one night.

Friendly reminder: AFK VNI/Rorq doesn't really mean you *literally* afk. At least leave the local out next to your pornhub window.

 Dyvinex ( Dyvinex Ssasen ): what fucking retard decided we should help pafam secure a Keepstar next to northern catch

 Natalie ( Pixie Thief ): I think that was Vily's call 
---
Was wondering why test was shooting at me. Didn’t blow me up but still....gf all around 
---
Started 2011, it was about 300m a PLEX back then. 
---
The problem is, jag requires zero skill (as most things nowdays) to scram or force off a micro gang compared to the plays a ceptor must pull to acomplish the same results.
---
CCP 2019 though dont care about micro gangs and only cutters to Masses with braindead mechanics, balances. These masses much validate their existance in the game and the reason they credit card warrior every week. Dying while trying to scram in ill experienced ceptor hulls wont help the cash flow. This applies to injecting direct to cap/supers also.
---
If you small gang (6 ppl n less) i suggest you to avoid Horde, TEST, FRT space and try to pvp with cruiser class and below in the pipe between 1DQ and PR-C.
---
Goons are the best and fastest content providers you can get nowdays as small gang group. Thing that only indicates how trash game eve has become.
---
Well, that does shine some light on how we got there. 
---
But it doesn't really change the outcome, right?
---
lol u shud ask papa vince why we dislike panfam so much sir if you think panfam is so honrable , i mean we dont give a fuck about anyone but Eu goon fcs , INIT and wangs so sure but yea NCdot hasnt kept its word in many many situations.

Yeah I've lived in wormholes for years

It may be speculation now but this was something that CCP used to do to help control inflation https://oldforums.eveonline.com/?a=topic&amp;threadID=1487325

Pay sub with real life cash - avoid PLEX. Or take advantage and buy PLEX to sell in game. 
---
it's snuff, what did you expect? the second they are outnumbered or the remotest chance of them getting out-escalated they run like a scalded dog.
---
not that there's anything wrong with that. it's how they play, risk averse.
---
Seems like the reason to kick them was more than valid?
---
or make the option we have now the default and the m3 an extra click
---
Yeah, but then I'd have to live in a wormhole 24/7.
---
This is incredible thanks for the report
---
Because you need it for station cyno fields in lowsec. There have been a lot of proposals on how to handle jump drives without beacons and alts, but with the current implementation you need a throwaway cyno.
---
Doesn't help that Aura tells new player in the NPE to navigate via autopilot (paraphrased).
---
To be fair, that might have changed and she goes on to describe how to set a route. She doesn't tell you to actually enable the autopilot function (but also doesn't say not to). 
---
But referring to the navigation tool as autopilot (which it is called in-game, should be changed imo) can easily mislead someone who doesn't know better.
---
Drop a cyno, set destination the citadel where you are, turn on autopilot, go afk.
---
Even Sutonia can not kill your pod
---
And damn those things are worth a lot of isk now...
---
Because the only reason people grind is to afford shops to lose.
---
Dully noted. Lore is important.
---
As a fellow Goon I’m a little peeved at Test for this. During these engagements I honestly thought we could always count on Legacy to have our backs.
---
Yes.
---
I'd rather see it come back primarily as booster, though. Leave it with T2 drones and enough yield to not leave the booshing char significantly behind barges.
---
If rorquals don't make gamebreaking yield anymore, CCP can tweak their survivability around their new(old) role.
---
If I was Provi, I would be asking Snuff for a refund
---
So who’s side is who’s ? The br is pretty weird.. starchaser red alliance vs frt xlx and nine continent?
---
That would make a whole lot of sense, if it was their structure or at least an allies.
---
And what does ram stand for? For bumping miners or freighters etc?
---
Would have been better with a Blackbird
---
1000 ISK would buy you literally 10 lifetimes of super elite luxury if you lived on a planet
---
the only concerning graph here is the one at the bottom (trade volume). it's going down, slowly but steadily
---
we are recruiting btw
---
Except the pilgrim still has the range bonus. 
---
It requires more skill than the curse but you can stya outside of some things range. 
---
so just one more? 
---
Well, stop skill point farming and you'll see plex price to drop 
---
The problem isn’t rorqs or how much they mine.   The problem is lack of isk sinks.   CCP is really missing the the point in root cause of issues.   This latest round of nerds (while I do agree with them) still miss at tackling root issues in Eve.  That is isk just moves from one player to another.  Isk isn’t leaving the game.   CCP is trying to nerf the isk faucet (ratting/carrier ratting) and yet they still don’t have any meaningful means that removes isk from the game.  The minor adjustments to ship insurance do so very little to balance isk faucets vs isk sinks.   
---
WHAT'S THAT YOU'LL HAVE TO SPEAK UP
---
I'm all for goku fleets as much as Seddow himself, but isn't he the only one who runs them? Unless this was a TEST only fleet in which case nvm then I am dumb.
---
These others have said it better than me. CCP does not permaban people for *buying* stuff via RMT; at least not on the first offense. For example, if you buy isk from an RMTer and get caught, what CCP does is delete that isk from your character--this is how you get characters with a negative wallet balance. The second, and sometimes third, offense will be temporary bans. It's only after the 2nd time you are in danger of  being permabanned--not that you should buy isk from an RMTer ever, particularly given the current value of plex... you have no excuse. 
---
What CCP has zero tolerance for is people who *sell* isk, injectors, implants, ships, etc., for money. *If* Nolak is innocent here, the most likely scenario is that it was caused by Nolak loaning Azathi isk, which Azathi then turned around and sold to an RMTer (who would, in turn, sell the isk for a higher price.) 
---
The problem here is becomes almost impossible for CCP to distinguish between a guy who loaned the guilty party the money that guilty party sold and someone who is using the guilty party as an intermediary. In other words, either Nolak is making a legit loan; OR Nolak is giving the money to Azathio to sell for money to Azathio's RMT contacts and then getting paid out by Azathio. 
---
Frankly, as much as I sympathize with someone who might get innocently banned from a game I think everyone here loves, I cannot fault CCP for assuming the worst when it comes to RMT. Leaving aside the philosophical issues, RMT hurts CCPs bottom line, and *we collectively* care about CCPs bottom line because CCP is a capitalist entity--if CCP is not profitable, first development on the game stops, followed ultimately by the shuttering of the game entirely. 
---
I will say though, that if just part of what Nolak is saying is true--that CCP just closes his tickets with no comments, and refuses to respond to his emails--I think that is unfair. If they are going to permaban someone from the game, they owe that person the courtesy of communicating and *very clearly* stating the evidence that was used in making the decision to ban. 
---
I’m not sure what you’re trying to say. Of course some people combat fit asteros, especially given its bonuses. 
---
My point is that while camping sites in a nemesis I run into non combat fit asteros a lot more frequently 
---
looks fast.
---
INIT has waaaaaaaaaaay more koolaid than actual intel
---
&gt; Didn’t you read where he was part of goons? 
---
This is extremely unfair, and inappropriate. I can tell you right now, you can generalize about goons all day and be right about a lot of things; however, this is not one of them.  
---
We had tidi from delve to the destination. The only resistance that slowed us down.
---
Does lack of safe spaces in goonspace disturb you hun?
---
I wonder how much this might drive commodity price inflation?
---
&gt;send it to a GM account to be black-holed, or w
---
Pretty much this was the right call. In fact, even if you hadn't just received a large some of isk from someone you were in in-game business with who is caught for RMT, it behooves you to immediately contact a GM, explain you had no idea that the person was engaged in RMT, and asking if there is anything you can do to facilitate the investigation, up to and including returning any tainted assets that might be in your possession, which may be tainted by RMT. 
---
The botting wars have begun. 
---
Olmeca/Free Folk crack me up.   He’s the #1 contributor to kill marks in my ships and he gets so salty in local for loosing his cheap little ships.   I think he’s “popular” among Goons because he gets so salty and shows such on obvious jealousy for what’s been built in delve.  He endlessly obsesses over it in local.  So we enjoy laughing at him.   
---
True that PK
---
Hahahahahahahaha betas in revolt
---
Academic question, if you are Nolak and paid yearly on 12 accounts, and get banned 6 months into that subscription period, can you demand a refund? :D 
---
i mean being shit yourself, "not learning", repeatedly making the same mistake.... just trying their patience
---
omg its that handsome pilot felix allistar again.

Do not listen to them. Filthy do-gooders. Cheers!

You should probably have contacted CCP right away, not returned it.  
---
If you get a lot of cash irl from a suspicious source, you also don't send it back, you contact your bank (and probably the police as well)
---
Is this like a paraphrase on that relationship which ended like 12 years ago, but i still find myself dialing her number when drunk af?

---

What you really needed to do was contacting CCP right away

I dont want to offend anyone but if you cant afford the 15 bucks for a sub, getting time off the Pc doesn't seem to be the worst of all ideas.
---
Just drop a Titan on it man! Like they do I'm goon space. /S
---
The biggest issue here for me Nolak, is that I used to be a developer on an unnamed MMO. I know from experience the tools given to the GMs and security specialists, and I also know, at least at the company I worked for, permabans were not handed out for things like RMT *unless the evidence was pretty fucking damning.* 
---
I will give you this though, if what you say about CCP closing tickets and refusing to return your emails is true, that is a pretty damn shaddy way of doing business, even for a video game company. Given how much of our lives and our money we actually invest in MMOs (and they are all designed around this), they owe it to people who are permabanned, and who ask, to communicate the reasons to that person and *clearly lay out* the evidence they used in making their decision. 
---
Then can i has (some of) your stuff so you can enjoy being poor?
---
\&gt;  test the patience of newbie corps by pretending to be bad at the game 
---
Can recommend this.  I did it once way back.  It's hilariously easy to trigger anyone in high-sec compared to null.
---
It feel like X47 again 
---
It is much smaller engagement compared to it. And there Imperium did commit seriously.
---
Not sure how is that the same.
---
please stop
---
This is exactly the reason I didn't go. 
---
Wow. What happened in the game to cause this level of inflation? Plex is like 4-5 times more than it was then I last logged in. Lucky I liquidated everything and bought plex in case I ever return. I could go back fairly wealthy now, by the sound of it.
---
then you are a moron for not valuing their potentials. 
---
What I'm trying to say is:
---
 + Flying a non combat Astero is not the good way (but that's what you advised in your first comment)
---
 + Advising to fly a non combat Astero in the same comment where you say to camp them in Nemesis is confusing. You are basically advising people to use a fit that you are used to pop in Nemesis (and again, a Nemesis should always lose vs an Astero).
---
 + I know pple use stabs and interials, 'cause it's how I kill them. You even have an example in my guide of a guy w/ 4 stabs.
---
 + One point of my guide was "use a PVP fit". Because I know people are using Astero the wrong way.
---
So, yea, I _believe_ you.
---
Any PI, reactions or loot I don't sell to my corp I ship to Jita and sell there.  Could do a buyback if your corp has that as well makes things simpler
---
if you look at the isk/hour compare to the investment/risk, no, a rorq right now, even T2 don't pull that much above a hulk fully train+perfect boost without the 7bil investment (I know drone price lower since the patch) or the 5 min stick in space. But the thing is, even if you give rorq paper tank and insane income, no one will ever form up to kill them, I live in delve and I can tell you, there is not that much people hunting the ship, way more aim for the drones (which is fair, if you can loot 5bil from it why not). So yes, in an era of eve where 1 side abuse a mechanic lunch 3 years ago while almost no one else in eve try to abuse it too (I guess it take a long time to adapt right ?) or try to contest this kind of gameplay, this nerf is necessary. 
---
And, since I know I will get downvote let me have some fun : CCP should also bring back casino into the game, maybe we will see anti-goons entity being active and do pvp again 
---
&gt; Maybe they like using their super/titan in their alliance.
---
Sitting on a gate deep in Fountain with a Boson counts as using your Titan?
---
All I see, is a good reason to do extra hours at work
---
*good succ*
---
My first comment was sarcastic, which is why I prefaced it by saying "as someone who hunts asteros in a solo nemesis."
---
UNBALANCE GAME
---
People already didn't give a fuck when it was a new thing.  
---
Because to be honest it's like watching a commentated paintball match in Syria or something.  
---
It may be a nice show and the winner gets a neat rifle, but people are aware that outside there is a lot of war going on already.
---
That POV makes no sense unless Falcon has like a 4 foot long dick that reaches up to his own eye-line.
---
Like a DC-10; guaranteed to go down.
---
5/7 no space duct tape
---
I think FRAT made a wise move to spread their revenue streams out across different entities. This allows them to avoid raising eye brows w/ regards to military build up and are now starting to pull them back in.

---
were sarcastic too? well, i didn't got it.
---
Anyway, I believe you when you say how much pple fly astero the wrong way. That's why I maid this guide.
---
I don't really got your point neither.
---
I remember when there were no damn plex and extractors, how life was allot better.
---
It’s either rorquals or mass covetor alpha accounts, the only nerfs that need to be applied to rorquals is tank. Nerfing the yield only reduces overall supply this increasing ore prices which circles full 360 back around into rorquals making the same isk they did before.
---
Goons could in theory deploy 1,000 but I think in practice a lot of krabs own and never deploy them.  Not my bag but I honestly don't see the point in buying into apex content and then never making use of it that one time per year there's a big timer.  Outside of war mine is kind-of a jump freighter.  Very undignified.
---
Or separate jump freighters and rorquals to use a "civilian"-grade cyno and making combat capitals only able to jump through "military"-grade cyno with a minimum hull requirement of cruisers or t2/3 destroyers
---
Yes?
---
If more people see higher plex prices and decide to pay for a sub instead of buying plex, that would also explain a decrease in trade volume.
---
Didn't you ask NC about blue status last year?
---
&gt; or mass covetor alpha accounts
---
Alpha can't fly mining barges ...
---
It was 10% "the whole way", no.  It started a couple of jumps out.  We didn't have far to burn anyway, we had a hole into low.
---
No, it's a fraction of one galaxy. The different sky boxes are supposed tp be the result of different nebulars.
---
But.. but.. but..
---
The loss of skill points is only attached to Tech 3 cruisers and you lose 1 level in a random subsystem when you lose your ship. Alphas can't lose skills because they can't fly anything that puts them at risk.
---
as mentioned before it is uncontrolled by players. this space is controlled by npcs and is known as empire space.
---
any of you guys busy during USTZ?
---
Nice time to be a seller it seems.
---
Isn't this just the effect of Isk being easier to make? That has 2 effects:
---
a) People can grind isk with ease, therefore no longer need to buy PLEX for their PVP habit.
---
b) With multi accounting (skill train farms) and Rorquals, the demand has increased.
---
These combined are bad news for an average player, plex prices will continue to inflate unless Isk is made more difficult to obtain..
---
I just think we've lost that awe in eve.  I mean when a titan first came out it was like epic.  Now its just another big pvp ship.  These should of become more expensive and took longer to build.  Now people are chucking the out for fun.  Every man and his dog had one and they are just a bit meaningless apart from they have big weapons.
---
I dont mean we should restrict people having them I just think they are far far too cheap and easy to build and now they dont have that awe about them
---
Entirely. Too easy to multibox, too strong of a defensive ability for a mining ship (I mean, 5 min immune time is still too retarded).
---
What 
---
absolutely
---
Money.
---
It will take 100s of hours before you really have an idea of what you are doing but you are not locked into a path. You could potentially even reach a point where you have every skill trained. Exploration can actually turn into pvp and was my way into pvp. I got an astero and saw and explorer hunting fit and went to town with that.
---
Yes

---
I would say there's an argument to be made for not revealing what evidence they have. My work focuses on 'real world' fraud, and we frequently have both the bad guys and the victims demanding to know how we discovered/confirmed it. The issue is, if we say "oh transactions over X are auto flagged" or "your passport was clearly doctored because the code shown on page A didn't match that on page B", then the criminals learn from their mistakes and are harder to catch next time, and even the innocent victims might mention it to a friend or on a forum somewhere where it will get back to other ne'er-do-wells. 
---
If they said that a particular transaction or set of transactions were the evidence, someone with nefarious intentions could work out that if they keep the Isk value below a certain arbitrary amount it won't flag; if it was a certain conversation, they could work out the key words that got them caught, etc. Any information given - even to confirmed innocent parties - could make catching the next guy 20 times harder, and given things like botting, RMT, fraud, hacking, etc. are all an arms race between the perpetrators and those seeking to prevent/catch them where information is the only weapon, there will always be a limit to what can be revealed that will be less than the customer would like.

LET the cloaky camping games beeeeeegggggin!!!!!!!!
---
Multiboxers can still multibox, but only would get barge-yield and had to be more active, yes.
---
I will not factor in exploiters (like mass alpha, altough they can max fly ventures) or botters, those obviously have to go away however you look at it. And they are rampant as-is anyway. It would cut back at them the same way it does for everyone. 
---
Mineral prices will probably up over time, but that only makes mining more viable outside of nullsec again.
---
It might be inconvenient for you, but I believe it is long term better for the game.
---
I think I was more successful in 2 weeks than you were for a whole year.
---
typical drop from the summer to winter.  Volume should bounce back, particularly if there is a major war (which we havn't had in a while). 
---
Then rorq mine in your hole like a man. If you get dropped, its content delivered to your front door.

Supercaps are eve on casual mode.

Change my mind.

No, it's not.

I'd move an alliance to get away from xenuria's posting.

I'm sorry, do you really think I use init flair because I'm in init? Jeez. 
---
;) barely upload anything these days :/ got some nice clips on my HDD from december and january of like a few super frags with a nano gang and random nano gang stuff, but i dont have the time to actually get all that proccessed haha
---
Decreased their yeld but increased boost, so multiple rorquals can boost eachother obtaining almost the same shit.
---
Only thing acheived is increasing the viability of subcap mining ships but doubtfully enough for them to be remotely viable.
---
Please show me on the killmail where the gankers touched you
---
I hear that they will use the low sec gate on their route.
---
IsBoxer incursions used to pay alot, ive done it myself and it was just huge isk making
---
Most established WH corps have contracts up for most doctrine ships, also you can ask ppl to haul your stuff, or they even just ask if anyone needs something if they have space in their DSTs. 
---
I do agree it's not as easy as setting up contracts without talking to anyone such as in a major nullbloc but the potential gudfites are a fair tradeoff for a little effort in return.
---
In regards to scanning it,  depends what kind of corp you join. ODIN lives in a C2 with a C5 and Nullstatic, which means content is basically on your doorstep in regards to the null static. :)
---
I'm sorry that MWD fit Drakes are too hard for you to counter.
---
In rust we trust
---
The fuck. It's just a game. There's no room for any kind of nationalism.
---
Why would you care if the nerd that you blow up is Japanese, Portuguese, Chinese or American?
---
I understand language barriers, but saying all players from "xxx" country will band together and fight "yyy" country players due to some national pride is just silly. Hell, I would prefer to shoot players from my country first.
---
reddit people are retarded, more news at 11
---
&gt; I live in delve and I can tell you, there is not that much people hunting the ship, way more aim for the drones
---
Hmm, I wonder why that might be.
---
I agree minus the cloak. I haven't use a cov ops cloak in months.
---
Short answer: Yes
---
Long Answer: Yeeeeeeeeeeeeessssssssssssssss
---
In all seriousness though, bak when they made the mining pass, they took what was a capital level mining support ship and made it the premier mining ship.  This is a balance pass that should have been made two years ago
---
It's been a while since the last big plex promotion (real ones, not the CCP fake maths bullshit).
---
That will fix it, when they run a campaign. ;)
---
I am sitting next to you in the same boat... feels and smells bad, #ccp?!
---
I was hoping there was something with my account, but your message just proved they made a worst decision once again. I just wonder how many players got those SPs.
---
Can you speak russian
---
Point to where on the doll you were snuffed.
---
It’s not inconvenient for me at all. The only inconvenience is people, who lack any economic foresight, start dumping rorquals and then content dries up for all thing rorqual related. They delivered a target worthy of escalation and now that took of escalation is being hit thus influencing a downsizing of available targets. 
---
it dropped most of the expensive shit. This guys just a crybaby
---
Just doing us a service TBH. God bless.
---
This, watching his vid, he panned by too fast for me to see what, but there did appear to be a hostile still active
---
Which is why China will win everything eventually, win at all costs in all things ;)
---
You misunderstand the basic fundamentals and dynamics of strategic small to medium sized warfare in eve. In your experience, fleet fights are essentially a race to the bottom where called targets get alpha'd until one side looses alpha potential at which point the winner is decided and gets to clean up the remaining ships locked on grid. This means that even if you dominate the field, there's a good chance that you get shot off grid.
---
In wormholes this is rare as mass limitations of a fleet trumps the alpha potential of a n+1 strategy. This means that ship and pilot quality far outweighs your capability to bat-phone your friends or flex your blue count as we can only bring an X amount of things into the fight depending on the hole.
---
This also means that every ship on the field is more valuable to the fleet itself. Because of this, most non-triage fleets will have 1/3-4 of their fleet compromised of Logi to keep people alive. 
---
In a fight where you cannot simply alpha the enemy ships off grid, you need positioning, ECM, target switching, booshing, cap warfare or whatever strategy you choose to employ to catch the enemy fleet off balance and score a kill. This is why WH fights tend to last 30minutes to 3 hours.
---
Something you dubbed as a completely one-sided curb stomp may have bin a 2 hour intense brawl with neither side breaking and loosing a ship until the very end, where a boosher cought 3 Guardians and ended the fight right there.
---
$10-11 if you pay like a man
---
Best bet would probably be bee-lining the cerbs to target and then taking the harpies and jacks through wormholes. Not always an option though obviously
---
Now tell me on the spaceship where daddy goons touched you.
---
That and 1 day old cyno characters (and titan pilots)
---
Well considering I have 4 accounts ( subcap, fax, super and titan characters) it's little bit more expensive, let's say 10 per month due to some discount, that's 40 a month so a new game per month or 480 a year which it can be considered not unsignificant for a game that has quite big problems, and as I said it is slow, I'm talking fleetwise but even solo it's a lot of time spend to travel for very short actions.
---
Also I could offer myself to spend this amount, what I say is the «value»(product) that I get for this amount is overpriced. 
---
I still like this game it is unique, the people you can met it's amazing

What you say is absolutely true. Maybe I didn't explain well. I assumed that the can hacker is orbiting the can, as the 99% of players tend to do. So, if you are orbiting the can, the time that is needed to warp out is greater than the time needed to do so if you are already aligned ALMOST everytime, but there's another point here. When you are orbiting a can, click warp to a celestial, and that celestial is in front of your ship your time to warp is pretty shorter, and if you are prop-off, your time to align to that point and warp is really low. The fact here, and what I assumed, is that he is orbiting the can, and when someone ganks him, just clicks warp to anywhere due to panic, no matter where is he headed to; that is what I see almost everytime in almost every gank. More experienced players (and I think that is the pro way), orbit the can at max relic analyzer, and when they are being ganked, warp where their ship is headed to at that precise moment. But its really hard to do, considering that you are hack a relic and paying attention to that, your ship isn't aligned to any celestial at that moment, and you enter panic mode. Anyway, thanks for your clear explanation. Fly safe. O7

It was shit.

But it was a perfect demonstration of what CCP does - try a half-assed concept and abandon it, after pumping money into it (See also: World of Darkness and probably that new wave-based PvE shooter).

Depending who is attacking what.      
---
How many times you see a dead rorqual in Stain?      
---
Simple example - a very rarely as people manage to fight small gangs trying to kill them, and trust me there are many rorquals mining in Stain.           
---
yes... we definetly stabbed you in the back by doing exactly what i said i would do and killing none of your things...
---
Even  PL held back from shooting test.
---
But that was when a single PLEX paid for 30-day subscription, right? I remember trying to grind for that 300mil, but it turned into a job. 
---
&gt; Decreased their yeld but increased boost, so multiple rorquals can boost eachother obtaining almost the same shit.
---
Mining boost does not work on other rorqs
---
For me it is bad as you can summarize this change by "get additional rorquals" and you earn more. 
---
i can learn
---
We are cloaked and ever watching
---
They don't have the leadership nor the will to really handle anybody. They aren't even trying which is sad. All they have done for the last 3+ years is talk up a good game, complain that nobody is helping them, and roll over when shown a bit of dominance.
---
The truth of the matter is, they are allowed to live there because nobody wants that horrible space. We own the Y-MPWL pocket only because we are still waiting on Provi to come take it back from us but they aren't even making an effort. They haven't been able to figure out how to get rid of PHEW in the YQB pocket and no efforts have been made at all. 
---
We aren't the only ones who camp their systems. Even TEST members camp their systems as well as hot drop them and yet, TEST is supposed to be their "friends". 
---
Provi is a captain-less ship trying to figure out where the rudder is without even knowing where they are going.
---
But will it get transferred back to Hostile. (PHEW) ? Now that their precious KB is safe?
---
Same tbh. I only keep my main subbed right now because I can't be arsed to login to krab the plex to keep my other half dozen alts active.

As often deployed by the Flameburst Coalition.

Considering the amount of POS spam I still see, I sincerely doubt it.  It would completely tank the structure market.

Well since that same logic applied before it’s a uselss argument, isn’t it?
---
Upvote whore
---
Yea, new players probably don't know this, but when PLEX was introduced, it was just a single-use item to be able to play the game: **P**ilot **L**icense **E**xten**S**ion.
---
Somewhere along the way, it was changed to this premium currency bullshit.
---
I blame the monocle.
---
plot twist: everyone is wealthy now
---
How many groups are there looking for escalations around rorquals?
---
Most take it because of lack for other content. If there were more smaller ships to kill, you'd see more small gangs hunting for them. That's a positive effect across the star cluster.
---
That you won't see the need to drop theta squad on V0ltas vedmaks anymore is a bummer, but again, your personal convenience is of minor concern for me.
---
&gt; Hell, I would prefer to shoot players from my country first.
---
Destabilization is nearly complete Comrade Kalishnikov.  Prepare your forces to invade.

---
Being WH btw does not automatically make you a better player but in general attracts less-casual, more dedicated players than those F1 monkeys you refer to. Every kill, or rather literally everything needs much more effort in WH space, uf only because of the scanning involved. If it's hard for you to imagine these kinds of more dedicated players being "better" at game mechanics, especially PVP, the you must surely believe there exist no skill gaps at all in this game, and everyone is equally good
---
Came to complain we shouldn't make EVE easier...  
---
Then I remembered how shit the current Skill Sheet is compared to what it used to be...
---
Subscription to Eve: $13  
---
Training into a Rorqual: 4 months of your time.  
---
Lighting the cyno and watching a cloaky gang eat shit on your bait Rorqual: Priceless.  
---
I don't see what is your point, and every time we tackled anything in Stain we got dropped on by carriers and supers so laughing at your "small gang" here.
---
Better to save then for droppingnon 20 man atron gangs imo
---
Not much weirder then Reprocessing skills, which require different prerequesites depending on ore.  
---
It's called balancing.  
---
So anyone know what's this about? It's unlisted on facebook and isn't on youtube at all.
---
Would you be so kind as to provide location of those dreads? Or we are supposed to believe they are in test staging and they would've moved them from there. I gotta tell you if this was a master plan by test I have a hard time picturing why would they say they were gonna defend the keep beforehand instead of saying nothing, playing dumb, or shooting irrelevant subcaps to make you believe they were on your side.
---
So hurt it’s huge!!
---
This guy highsecs
---
They should never have made it a horizontal scaling ship. Vertical, like super ratting, mayyybe. 
---
Better would have been to balance it's boosting mechanics around on grid use. I'm thinking more like the new NSA.  1 minute cycle time, mobile on grid but no warp. And next to no yield (not exceeding that of a barge/exhumer).
---
It does not work on themselves either.
---
Yes
---
not on regular ore.  120m is perfect.  80m is more realistic.  
---
That is part of the problem too, but this thread is about mining.  
---
Huge returns on rorquals would make sense only with huge risk, as it is with every other activity in this game, with exclusion of station trading which does not require you undocking from Jita even once.  
---
I pvp too mych to know exactly how rorquals work
---
&gt; use the code shown on pa
---
I get that, but in this case, for example if Nolak had really subbed 12 accounts for a year with money, he is a paying customer that is being denied services, and unless CCP is offering a blanket refund (which I am doubting they are), he needs to be told *exactly* why CCP is now denying him the services he paid $1,200 for. 
---
I couldn't disagree with you more that nobody hunts the things. I get daily pings for rorq saves. Weekends are kind of ridiculous.
---
Apparently not enough
---
The only amusing facet of this nonsense is how we are supposed to praise INIT/snuff for forming 100 titans when basically everyone else forms that for a single rorqual save.
---
Take a look at blops gangs, none uses it as a neuting boat because it's so trash at it compared to a legion or even a neuting sin, they're pretty much only used with weapon disrupters against carriers and supers
---
Some nuances that should be noted to help demystify this a bit. I have been in numerous WH corps at this point in all classes of WH space (OFOC included). Everyone has to try to do their fair share of scanning don't get me wrong, but in all the WH corps i've been in there's 3-4 dudes who are just autistic about it and will have the chain mapped constantly. In regards to logistics it's really not as bad as you would think. If there is nothing in chain you can roll it off and scan 2-3 connections out until you find a highsec. If you don't find one within a couple jumps roll and try again. You can collapse a chain in 2-3 minutes if you're efficient (even faster in highclass with caps). 
---
Being in the average wormhole corp tends to be a bit more relaxed compared to the tight controls of a Kspace corp. People will be more than happy to haul your stuff. I've had half of my net worth be hauled by corpmates with no collateral. 
---
Wormhole space is truly a unique experience and one that I would highly recommend if Eve is the primary game you play.

The Discourse actually did a short vid on it.  
---
No clue what CCP has planned tho.
---
Fit a hyper super and go drop on some whales deep in unfriendly space. Then come talk about how casual that is. 
---
He's a goofball but he does know what he's doing.
---
Completely agree about the need for more sinks. Wouldn't conflict be the best sink though? Conflict needs to be less time consuming to accommodate the RL's of potential content creators. But at the same time, isk = RL cash. So to expect people to throw time and money at conflicts they may not win is directly apposed to modern day safe space mentalities that dominate first world thinking. I think CCP is living the perfect catch 22 of MMO developments. They honestly have more incentive to please the carebears and drip feed the PVP'ers. PVP'ers actually endanger parts of CCP's money making ecosystem. 
---
Small gang of supers.
---
\&gt;  Tapi were working against imperium.   
---
How exactly? Init are Goon pets so they don't really care about what happens to them and Snuffed left the Imperium and are therefore equally meaningless.

Plz, being in a wh corp doesn't make you good. You can be a useless ping monkey in one as well.

Must cost that JTAC douchnozzle a fortune to camp all those systems at once...
---
Dank leaks incoming?
---
Did drop nearly 50% Oo what’s wrong ?
---
I agree, I would be fine with a super tanky capital ship if it was focused as a boosting ship rather than a miner (like it used to be).  Give some incentive to the rorq pilot based on the mining activity around it rather than it actually mining the rocks.  Perhaps it passively collects "mining scraps" based on the mining activity in the area when it is in IC?
---
Burn them all. This system is ours
---
Its nice but kinda looks to crisp to be minmatarian, looks more like mad max style, this is how I'd imagine a minmatar computer would look like [https://img.purch.com/rc/600x450/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9HL1IvMjc1MzU1L29yaWdpbmFsLzAxMy5qcGc=](https://img.purch.com/rc/600x450/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS9HL1IvMjc1MzU1L29yaWdpbmFsLzAxMy5qcGc=)

Amarr victor!

If he can fly all WH doctrines his place certainly isn't in POSPY lmfao
---
Hmmm...  
---
One was a back stab during a move op. The other was a through the normal course of doing business. Perhaps you missed the point where PanFam and friends allowed TAPI to move back south, freeported some citadels for them, and didn't kill any of their titans on the way back home. Snuff wasn't as honorable and are now paying the consequences.
---
But hey, you obviously are upset so don't let the facts get in your way. I'm sure you'll have a fun time plotting your revenge or some such.
---
FRT badly needs more numbers in EU timezone and additional income from ratting/mining to fuel their military machine. Compared to last year the amount of pew-pew and fleets FRT is involved now has just shot through the roof. Its not only ships they need to field/SRP, but the most PVP loving pilots can burn out with the amount they've been engaged in past 2-3 months
---
ASCEE next?
---
A few things (and yes you did say that you made assumptions). 
---
1) rorq fits have gone way down in price. 
---
2) your yield is way way too high.  100m per hour is about right now depending on if you have to clear ochre (then it will be lower). 
---
3) you say "to return investment" but that doesn't really make sense since you still have the rorq that you can sell.  The only thing that you are looking to make up is the cost to train and skill books.  Also you should calculate it as a difference between say VNI ratting and rorq mining.  
---
VNI ratting = 40m per hour. 
---
Rorq mining = 100m per hour. 
---
you need about 20 injectors (about) to get to a decent point for rorq mining.  I'm assuming you don't need any to VNI since the skills are pretty basic. 
---
So 20*900 + skill books = about 20B for a custom built rorq character (or you can buy one off the character bazaar). 
---
BUT then you will own a rorq character worth about 15B.  So you can always sell it to the bazaar or extract.  Same with your rorq assuming you don't lose it. 
---
So the real cost to you is in the neighborhood of about 5B to get a rorq character.  or about 50 hours of mining.  
---
My math is probably pretty bad, but TLDR - the only sunk costs to you are the difference between injecting and extracting because you can always extract and you can always sell back your ship. 
---

i don't know, i soemhow expected some kind of eve related song text
---
There are other versions already posted on Youtube, including with captions so you can actually understand what they're muttering.
---
There's a new event coming up, that will involve Abyss runs against Sleepers. The end results will likely include; new SKINs for the Trig ships, a new Booster, and random loot you can hand in to Concord.
---
This is happening because the best way to invest ISK is to buy PLEX. In fact the very act of buying PLEX is making you money since it increases demand. A lot of people is currently stockpilling PLEX because its the safest investment. So the price will continue to rise and its exactly what CCP wants. In effect this makes PLEX the actual currency of EVE.
---
Texas law is only law.
---
But all these can be solved by a low-sec gate to Stain right?
---
Here. You might want to apply this liberally on the affected areas:  
---
[https://imgur.com/a/1npX8cJ](https://imgur.com/a/1npX8cJ)
---
sounds like something I'd do sober
---
So what did i say? That Stain 'small groups' can manage small gangs trying to tackle rorquals?     
---
The group that dropped those capitals and supers is around 10-20 real people playing in same TZ together. Some are even smaller.       
---
we would only drop another condor gang, atrons too scary 
---
Goons also sent multiple fleets to get the KS kill. They sat in TiDi and flew home empty handed.
---
Even then I find it slower than just spamming the dock button.
---
This game has taught me that trust is a valuable resource.
---
Do you think I stoop so low as to expose my flesh for money? Sir, I shall have you know I have high moral standards!  
---
Lets make it 2,000.00 ISK, ok?
---
They should call it navigation system and reserve the word "autopilot" for the actual no-no button.
---
Hows the math looking on using 2 multi character training certs on 3 characters and 500 PLEX to extract for injectors and sell? (assuming all toons are all over 5.5SP already.)
---
I've seen people say its both good and bad recently.
---
LOL! OMG!

Data might not be as blingy as Relic, but you get to hack like a dude.

thats my point dude they didnt 
---
Cool. I've no idea why CCP wants to eliminate titan ratting by cutting HAW damage. Stuff needs to be in space in order to kill it. 
---
Thanks God Anthar, finally a properly shit post, I was becoming worried of the amount of actually good posts you had over the last few months. 
---
Yes its silly but there is a reason why it is done in real war even in modern day wars. What do you think corp/alliance names are? In game nationalities basically. 
---
Well, for big groups, the reward is just less than before, risk is still low.
---
But for the small/medium  groups, the risk is now much higher for less reward.  So the global usage of rorquals should shift towards large groups.
---
 _Who are *they* to tell us how to play our game, its not our fault they're not having fun._
---
_They should have adapted and overcome._
---
I really appreciated this post.
---
&gt; Basically what we will get is again motivation for players to create and use more rorqual accounts!
---
Yes let's make more alt into that one ship that got nerf and is making less isk now ! This is perfectly logical !
---
Is the size/yield of excavators all they are changing about rorqs? 
---
What stopped anyone from adding 1 more rorq before? 
---
But I agree. Nerf rorquals in a way it 
---
a) scales vertical instead of horizontal, like super ratting 
---
or
---
b) transforms back into a boosting platform with yield that doesn't exceed a single exhumer. 
---
Than rebalance survivability around it's new role.
---
Heretic, Sabre, Flycatcher, Eris. All of them are the t2 destroyers known as interdictors and can drop a bubble. I have never seen an Eris in space personally. The best thing to do is just cloak when they are on dscan. I don't think they get used for anything besides tackling stuff so if you see one, someone is hunting. Combat probes is another thing to watch for.
---
As far as figuring out if someone is headed to you 14.3 au and if you are worried start the distance down until you can't see them on scan. keep scanning to see if they show up. if they do they are probably headed your direction.
---
My cyno alt says otherwise
---
If you pick loot data from a few data sites (pun inteded) then its shit. But do them consistently for 1-2 weeks each day and the payout will almost reach that of relics.  Past week i pulled 7 capital ancil repairers. They are shit now in price, but way before they were super OP and pricy. Also sleeper components and other stuff like Optimized Decryptors - they are worth a lot.
---
Also data has way more consistency in its value. I have stumbled upon many relics - temple and quarries too - but mostly monument, that gave me like 1-3 mil in loot and were a pain to scan.
---
Also take into account manufacturers that have plenty of spare time and need data loot for invent/manufacture.
---
No, they also effectively cut their active tank in half and reduce the duration of panic.
---
Honestly probably the beginning of an arc, and there'll be more than just a skin-and-booster event, though that might be part of the kick-off.
---
Thought there was something like that, ty
---
this is what i was thinking. 
---
10-20 people able to form supers and carriers to save rorquals is not "a small group". I mean per fucking definition of the case they can already defend their rorquals so I don't see what the fuck you're complaining about here.
---
These rorqual nerfs seem to be generating countless ore holds full of compressed salt tho...
---
Tbh i am waiting for the moment when Goons (not Init) start to consider Snuff as enemy group.      
---
Recently Snuff is doing a lot of drops and operations against Goons with PH, PL or NC.        
---
Sure those are ex dudes from this groups ... but they are now in Snuff, they are Snuff and Snuff will be held accountable at some point for it.        
---
This will be probably not a war declaration, but some FC will decide to third party here and there against Snuff... or because some fight didn't happen and all stuff is presetup and all ships in range ... drop on the Snuff supers in Titans because he can.            
---
Like Snuff and Goons are not blue ;)              
---
**hint for Snuff:**             
---
Don't let members fly with 'people from north' as this could end up badly on bathphone availability or alliance super and titan numbers.          
---
Love these goon tears.
---
But that’s what they’ll do... meta is N+1 which applies to this too...
---
"Transforms"? It's already the best mining gang link platform. Wanting to nerf the yield of a rorqual is a perfectly valid thing to argue, but at least couch it in the right terms.
---
It is EVE 2019.         
---
10 guys with 20 supers is not something unusual ... i have 3, finishing 2 more(pilots) hulls are not an issue. 
---
Size/yield is about excavators.

Rorquals get less active tank and better mining boosts. 
---
Great for you, you can defend your rorquals and stop complaining like a retard about how it will hurt small group ?
---
oh your right there were absolutely no capitals. spod for brains.
---
Such makros are indeed banned.
---
Acceptable use would be to bind ctrl-f1 to a major key to activate *one* lowslot (?) module.
---
But one of you key strokes can only ever do one thing in-game. If it activates to modules for example, you already crossed the line.
---
Same for one keystroke repeating in-game actions.
---
Your logic is incredibly flawed - there are literally 1000s and of small ships in space in all regions yet not that many people take out small gangs. Why? Because they all want to drop dreads or blackops gangs on juicy targets such as rorquals.
---
The fact you think this is somehow an inconvenience to me is laughable - I stand to lose absolutely nothing. 
---
You and others’ inability to see beyond an hour time period is what has inevitably landed us in the position EVE is currently in. Everyone just wants “I Win!” Hutton’s to push vs actually working towards things, loudly requesting dumb changes that ultimately only further empower big entities, and accomplish the exact opposite of what it is you are looking accomplish. Instead of arguing some dumb “*lol rorqs got nerfed game is good!*” look further down the road and realize that whoa - nerfing rorquals is irrelevant with exception to being assets worth generating decent content.
---
Actually it is.          
---
**If you already have 5 mining rorquals you can easily add 2 more**     
---
It is not about starting up the operation but expanding it to make more isk.              
---
**It is not that 7 rorquals will require much more attention from you than those 5 you are already running**         
---
You should go back and read the rest of the changes in the devblog, there are other changes to mining ships happening (hint: bonuses).
---
by your logic of "if rorqs mine less people will just make more of them", if they got more yield people would use less
---
so obviously that's not correct 
---
And ? What's wrong with that ? Still cost them 500 PLEX, which is already 2bil currently, or subscription. If they can do this, why wait for the nerf tell me ?
---
Your tank is panic, and people that will come to save you. 
---
Tank bonus while in siege has been slashed, PANIC duration has had a 20% base duration cut.
---
And are no longer able to save all five excavators by stashing them in your mobile depot, I think you can only save three now. That's a few extra b lost when you get caught.
---
Cant wait for a movie from fight. 
---
I still don't get it, moon-goo notwithstanding, it takes a couple of hundred hours of mining to recover the cost of a Rorqual + Drones + Injectors, doesn't it.  That's a couple of hundred hours you're out and you didn't lose a drone or worse, all your drones - and you're multiboxing, etc.
---
I honestly don't believe people are doing this and if they are, they aren't very good at maths.
---
OR... am I wrong?
---
fight to remove rorqual mining === goon tears           
---
How is that related to the nerf ? It's already the current trend, have more rorqual to get more isk to get more rorqual to get more isk. All the nerf is doing is making it harder to gather the isk to get more rorqual.
---
Calm down goonie
---
It needs to be combined with 1 colossal :: 1 rorq.
---
The fact you can see 10-20 rorqs in one site is a complete joke.
---
Moongoo actually reduce this time in a significant way.     
---
Main point is that if you are **already multiboxing rorquals** ... just add more of them and "you are good"
---
This affects everybody else worse than Goons, so I couldn't gloat.
---
Whoa now Stainguy you are making too much sense, r/eve won’t like that.
---
Nerfing rorqual yield amounts are dumb at this point and accomplish nothing except a.) creating more rorquals for most and b.) driving up ore prices thus making rorquals just as profitable as they were before.If you want to fix rorquals you go for its defenses.
---
The simple solution is to just make the panic module only affect *other* ships and not the rorqual itself. BOOM, problem meet solution.
---
Become a space tyrant, build up an alliance to take all nullsec regions
---
You realize that RC just isnt impactful to Test in any way in the up coming war right? And neither is provi-bloc.
---
Like sure we could throw 30 dreads into a grinder once or twice, but that doesnt change their strategic situation.
---
My logic is -&gt; all previous nerfs to yield lead to people getting more alts ... so for sure a next yield nerf will lead to the same.       
---
Solution to rorquals is to make multiboxing of them much harder. 
---
Very close to break even, maybe even negative if you don’t have perfect market skills etc. sp farming is best to make alts cheaper, like cyno alts, vni alts, pi alts or whatever.
---
What was stopping people to having the maximum number of rorqs their rigs/skillz allowed them untill this nerf?
---
Lmao Jesus you guys are sad brains 
---
don't give them hints, let this happen
---

'battering ram'. It's not an acronym, it's a description of the strategy: you hit Approach and MWD and you go crashing into your target at ludicrous speed and there's nothing they can do to get you off. (i.e. they can't Web or Scram you because you're just going too fast and with ADC you're too durable, and you get tackle on them before you even slow down from their web.) It's not designed for use against miners/freighters, it's designed as an interceptor to grab fast tackle on enemy ships.
---
However the fact that the entire strategy is 'hit Approach MWD' is part of the issue here because of how efficient the ship is with that little work. (This is as opposed to the additional piloting required for like an Orthrus or other high-speed ships.)
---
This literally empowers our mining procurement fleets well beyond any other entity of current, meaning we are going to take an even bigger chunk of the mineral market. 
---
Eve is a free choice game. No one stops you from flying hulk. But even after nerf you will still fly rorquals, coz it is low apm, easy scalable activity.
---
ps. besides you can fly trash fit rorqual with t1 rigs, and cheap modules. suddenly the cost will fall below 1bill.
---
Now imagine a mechanic change that will make mining in more than 2 rorquals annoying from the multi management perspective.     
---
If all earlier yield nefs lead to multiboxers putting up more rorqual alts - what do you expect to happen now?       
---
Lol thought the same..  Its just bad because of fitting and only 2 mids. But it would need to lose a low for the mid or it gets op. 
---
Assuming rorqual die.       
---
Rorquals die if you do something utterly wrong or mine outside huge umbrella.     
---
If you get dropped, panic call for help, light a cyno.      
---
Something changed?       
---
You actually made me laugh here :D
---
Watch it.

Same here.

In Slavic mythology, **Zorya** are the two guardian goddesses, known as the Auroras. They guard and watch over the winged doomsday hound, Simargl, who is chained to the star Polaris in the constellation Ursa Minor, the "little bear". If the chain ever breaks, the hound will devour the constellation and the universe will end. The Zoryas represent the Morning Star and the Evening Star.

 **Vyraj** is a mythical place in [Slavic mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavic_mythology) where "birds fly for the winter and [souls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Souls) go after death" that is sometimes identified with [paradise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise). It was said that spring arrived on Earth from Vyraj.

 The word ***aždaja*** or [*aždaha*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/a%C5%BEdaha) is borrowed from [Persian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_language) *azdahā* and has its origins in the [Indo-Iranian mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_mythology) surrounding the dragon [*azidahā*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azhdaha). As an example, in some local Croatian icons, [St. George](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._George) is represented as slaying the aždaja and not a *zmaj*.   In [Persian literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_literature), Azhdahas are depicted as a giant snake or lizard with wings.

Zorya Triglav is/are the chief of guardians (Triglavians) of the Vyraj (Paradise, Abyssal Depths) which is corrupted by the Azdaja (the Others, Drifters, demons).

My bet is they ask for our help to battle the Drifters ... and our response should be: "It all comes at a price. And if the price is right  ... I\`ll set the universe on fire!" (source: EvE Inferno Trailer).

Cool, more excavators to input broadcast straight into my wallet

Eh? We had GTC and Character Bazar whit specked characters on sale what is in its principle the same.

This shit again

Yes, less response time over all for rescue fleet, and you cannot save all of your drones (max 3/5 saved).

Oh no not my 0 rorquals !

I'm fairly certain I lost a comet to a ridiculously tanky breacher - In game name?

&gt;ing to dread bomb snuff/init and leave when goons show up

Lmao we didn't bring any dread. You just Blueballs.
---
Of course it would be good but the whole point of your argumentation is that the incoming nerf is bad, it's not.

1 isk is a huge amount of money for non-capsuleers. 1000 isk? That will make you drown in abs.

Relatable memes.

Killed a hostile marshal and I was crying inside about how easily it broke. Havent undocked mine since - still in therapy.

I think the more rorqual, super and titan alts that stay logged out the better.

---
I’m not complaining about it. The shit poster OP is.  I’m saying why fight it.  
---
Suggested panic for only stuff around ... but CCP decided to go for the local active tank.           
---
100% better way could be removal of 'panic for rorqual itself' and increasing local tank.     
---
While you could still mine with many of rorquals - you need to limit yourself to number you can micromanage when attacked.        
---
Bunch of bombers or few dreads and you can lose them when you cycle badly your tank. 
---
Right tell that to the shit poster OP

---
More like WINMATTAR amirite?

PLES?

Rorqual need to die first.    
---
Also you know - instead of mining 1 per rock you can do 2-3 per rock and utilize other fleet hangars ;)
---
If you're in a pod, or something like a velator and simply making a long trip, I will absolutely use autopilot. On the off-chance I get ganked, so what? I hop back out and simply resume. 
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
That's just for that specific case, though. For pretty much any other situation, definitely don't use auto-pilot.
---
Damn that’s an obscure observation!  Gonna try it later 
---
also back then GTCs were traded on the forum, using a weird function on the account page, applied instantly to your account and couldn't be stockpiled, and were completely unknown to a large segment of people playing the game due to their obscurity
---
that probably has a lot to do with it
---
Huh?
---
You can easily fill two slots with your main and a jita alt with just contracting and trading skills, so that you can buy/sell stuff without moving your main around. The third is situational I think. I use it for a mission puller (with the runner on a separate account) with only social skills, as I'd like to keep my main as neutral as possible standing-wise. 
---
You could also make a PI alt, and you should make a SP farm using MCT if you have the cash to start it (although plex prices are through the roof and I don't know how profitable so farming is these days).
---
Thanks for approving my idea Stainguy, always a pleasure interacting with you on Reddit.
---
i agree. this applies to everything. Ever subscribed to something and forgot to unsub before the trial period runs out? you still have to pay the sub fee even if you didn't intend on doing that. you gave consent. you have to revoke it
---
buff blops pls it's basically a battle cruiser
---
Though atleast the marshal can get a 30k scram
---
New mining meta - Rorq/Orca &amp; 10 Algos alts
---
Nothing people constantly increased number of alts - just now they have additional motivation to do it.        
---
&gt; But even after nerf you will still fly rorquals, coz it is low apm, easy scalable activity.
---
&amp;nsbp;
---
Have they actually released the changes yet? Because many of us are hoping they wreck the mining ability of the rorq in order to turn it in to a boosting ship, in which case exhumers should finally be valuable again.
---
Turns out big slow ships with enormous sig rad don't take kindly to bombs, who woulda thunk it
---
GOON STRAT OPS ARE NEVER A 20 MINUTE ADVENTURE
---
kinda, except in this case the old man is only remembering 2 years back, not 60. 
---
You shot a neutral structure, therefore you were in the right :p
---
reminds me of a face a wrestler would make while posing for the camera - like Hulk Hogan.
---
Well damn. Why wouldn’t you? Would have been an opportunity. Actually I guess good thing you didn’t haha
---
&gt; That's always what kept plex prices in line.
---
plex have continually increased forever
---
that's the normal, the minor 10-15% decreases during big sales are the deviation
---
*inserts "I open my meme chat" copypasta here*
---
I wonder if there's actually anyone committed enough to buy a year at a time, but only uses one account.
---
Snuff isn't blue to them. Exactly. So why does snuff care so much that TEST decided to shoot them? Getting Snuff to understand what neutral means is way more important than killing the keepstar of a group that seems to spend most of their time killing provi anyway...
---
Does anyone seriously think that Panfam is going to stage a southern invasion out of that keepstar any time soon? I think it's unlikely, to say the least.
---
I was thinking about selling off tons of PLEX in August but ended up being in a situation where I had nowhere to hook up my computer and couldn't be reliably online for weeks. Looks like that inconvenience paid off.
---
The thing is, a good interceptor pilot counters the ramming-small-craft meta so hard.
---
The direct counter to these types of ships is a warp scrambler.
---
They slow down just as fast as they speed up. With some control, they don't project and are useless balls of HP on grid.
---
I encourage more ramming jag pilots. The fast they ram, the faster they overextend, get scrammed, and die in a fire to well projected and applied dps.
---
Use autopilot as you are warping to your Dock at Zero bookmark to guarantee you dock instantly with no room for ganks.
---
How long is the community going to continue to tolerate his shenanigans?
---
that really shouldn't be as concerning as the related decline in active players.  CCP claims to have banned thousands of bots, and surprise surprise, theres several thousand fewer actives.
---
Makes you wonder how many actual humans even play the game.
---
...What else are the dancers for?
---
bad bot
---
Well they are powerful tools but the current servers can't sustain them in large fights which is quite sad so during those «fights» yes they are logged out :p
---
I would take me 37 weeks to pay back the cost before I was in profit assuming a solid 100m an hour, 8 hours per week (one weekend day just mining and doing nothing much else).  So, yea.  Not for the casual player.
---
Probably not.. all the solo account players haven't seen the light yet. #5YearlySubs
---
Fuck off will you.  Idiot.
---
Personally, I would have went for a 1 panic active per grid or 100km or something.
---
It do.
---
The thing is though, even ships with the longest scram range and heated MWD, will still get tackled by a jag.
---
The speed is so fucking ridiculous, the radial velocity is so great with negative magnitude, that even with a linked and bonused scram, the jag will still be able to activate the scram at ~20km with only a t2 scram.
---
The server anticipates the position of the jag and extrapolates it's position on the next tick. When the radial of a Jaguar is about -6000m/s, that means at the absolute minimum, the jag gets its scram on at 11200m+6000m=17200m.
---
I'm not complaining tho, none of my fleet mates are in danger when I ceptor for them.
---
Looking at the corps kb and 95% of losses are VNI with names that look like they pounded on the keyboard. I'll say the same thing I did with PUBG............REGION LOCK CHINA!
---
They were elected to feed not to lead

---
Don't count on it. Mass barges/exhumers are bomb bait. If anything, you'll see procurer/skiffswarms, because those are the only ones that can resist bombing.
---
If PLEX prices are going up I'm assuming that means demand is high and not enough people are buying PLEX for real world money to feed the markets. I wonder how much this has to do with people multi boxing bots. I'm curious if CCP could do something against bot activity the buy and sell prices for PLEX might come down. Its unclear at that point if injectors would come down with that price or stay high. 
---
I mean, snuffed emphasized they were neutrals when they killed the test titan, right? This is what neutrality looks like.
---
Don’t worry I read it in exactly same way. 
---
Funny, cause that was the time when my roommate first introduced me to EVE, and he was farming static complexes, and some of the dedspace mods were going for 100-ish mil back then. It was Gistii A-type stuff if I recall.
---
Have you heard about Skill Injectors?
---
Yes, they should need at least 6 frgis for this.
---
The problem is there is a fundamental lack of understanding showing in your OP.
---
Rorq mining yields are shit, they take 60+ hours to break the investment cost alone. By making them easier to gank CCP is already forcing players to make a conscious decision to take them off the field. Coupled with the fact that barges will be competitive mining boats at fractional prices and cost of investment, it's more likely to be the case that you will see the more, easily ganked barges deployed, which represent a loss but not a massive inconvenience to the PVE player, while also not yielding a grossly disproportionate result on mineral quantity (which is not necessarily a bad thing as long as production is keeping up; otherwise it's just builder ISK stuck in mineral stockpiles).
---
Delete this.
---
&gt; Idk if you're a troll or a tard.
---
Probably closer to a tard. And i'm sorry.
---
underrated comment lol 
---
I wonder how many minutes it took to kill
---
The emphasis was one the second half of my comment to cut back the yield. I didn't mean to suggest a further increase of it's boosting abilities. Though I'd probably change the 5 minute siege of indu core to a 1 minute warp disruption like the future NSA. 
---
When FKF was leading the bomber fleets i was allowed to come. Now i cannot come on the bomber fleets anymore because i cannot fly T2 torpedos. This is my impression of TEST. 
---
And i've been hanging out in the hole divers slack for a few weeks now and it's been pretty cool. I've learned a lot and flown on several wormhole fleets. But unfortunately there just haven't been any good holes to fly fleets in and i've been scrubbing the holes all around catch looking.
---
Totally over powered.
---
Yet next to no-one does drop dreads or blops. It's not the same target group anyway. 
---
I think blops pilots would lick their fingers for a belt full of hulks.
---
Don't be. I read your posts after and decided you weren't trolling, so I was being overly harsh.
---
As I said, look into a corp in legacy with srp, or join #brave-hole-divers on slack. Srp will help lower your expenses, and that slack channel is pretty good for isk making, if not super frequent. You're looking at 2-3x the isk you make in a vni when they're. Able t run fleets 
---
Thank you for explaining this. This makes things much more clear for me.
---
Our blops has literally killed 8 rorquals in a 56 hour period.
---
Why are you so angry mr goonie?
---
I have a Tengu fit that can run an XLSB AB Invuln and point constantly while being neuted by a bhaal. No you do not get capped out in a proper supertanking T3. You run around with ~70% cap warfare resistance and have a quick recharge time medium neuts dont do enough and heavy neuts take too long to cicle.
---
Damn, slavic mythology seems fun.
---
I would doubt that frat would batphone PL, but Eli's in frat now, and he seems to have a good working relationship with most of the dudes in Panfam, so I would be shocked if we didn't at least see PH subcap fleets flying in to help out frat.
---
Yeah so going with 100m/hour as probably a realistic number, mostly mining high-ends with occasional ochre rock, a Rorqual alt probably takes about 70 hours worth of mining to pay for itself to compensate for the injector cost (sell character at 7b sunk cost, you've broken even). Or about 30 hours to pay for itself ignoring injector costs in case of death with saved excavator's and insurance for a mid range fit (9b) in realistic scenarios.   
---
The reason why the numbers are so low are because Rorquals are so safe. I get that this is probably a rant about how CCP is nerfing the 'excavator' yield by 20%, so I emphasise with you. Not everyone on the CSM agrees with the nerf to direct yield from the Rorqual. I'm probably one of the few that do.   
---

---
Check out the Mineral Price Index, it's been in mostly freefall since the Rorqual release in November of 2016, with occasional spikes around wars/expansions. It's only going to get worse. Even if CCP doesn't touch the Yield you're going to VNI ISK/hour numbers in a years time if the trend continues. Nerfing the Yield will probably hurt your prices, but demand/supply will catch up again at some point and the price of minerals will rise, which will improve the viability of other mining ships like exhumers/mining barges especially with the stronger foreman links on the Rorqual.   
---
I'd also like to point out that even a maxed Hulk, with t2 strip miners, t2 crystals sitting on top of a perfect mindlink Rorqual. (72m3/s). Also takes atrocious numbers to break even. A decent Hulk fit right now costs around 340m. or 259km3 per hour. With a 3% mining implant, it mines just over 1600m3 per strip miner, i.e. a Compressed Spod x2 every 44.3s. On paper, a Rorqual mines 3.125x more than a Hulk. But realistically once we take into account sensible adjustments that you mentioned it's about 2.4x more than a hulk. Therefore Hulks make approx 38mil per hour if they have perfect Rorqual boosts, which means they take about 9-10 hours of mining to pay for themselves, but if we multiply the number of hulks we need on grid (extra characters, extra accounts etc.) the cost to run 1x Rorq + 3x perfect Hulks is actually probably close to 2x Rorquals, since we must mine an extra 50 hours per Hulk character to pay for it's cost to plex. And 3 Rorquals would be better than 2 Rorqs + 3 Hulks. Let's also not forget that running mining links on your Rorqual increases risk (60s weapons timer where you can't immediately store drones in depot), and that Hulks are far more killable by the average roaming group than a Rorqual is.   
---
TL;DR is that Rorquals are more cost efficient to run over Hulks (Once you take into account plex prices)
---
Yield Nerfs may take some time but eventually as demand catches back to supply the nerf will end up reverting itself.  
---
Everything you just said is why eve gets stale. No half decent alliance is going to tell their members not to shoot neutrals incase they need to batphone one day. You such a dam nullbear wtf.
---
Good for him. 
---
I spent most of the isk i made flying with brave hole divers to upgrade my RR Domi to a doctrine hospital nestor and then we haven't really flown since. I've been looking hard but the holes that turned up were just all bad either cus they lacked sites or they were next door to something really nasty.
---
triggers me that you didn't math the hours required to break even
---
you need 27b for char, 8 for rorq for a total of 35 per rorq and it would take you around 389hours to farm 35b at 90m an hour 
---
awful, the only nice thing about rorqs is you can have 10 of them going np

---
honestly.
---
try autopilot from keba to shenda.  in shuttle or t1 frigate...
---
see results
---
try to autopilot from shenda to jasson
---
see results. 
---
you know where you can safely autopilot
---
Test is a large alliance with many corps in it. Don't let one tard discourage you
---
And yeah, the sites are down to luck unfortunately. I still think a bounty for viable c5s would. Help encourage scanners, but oh well 
---
Thanks bud!
---
You don't need the Nestor. That change was made to make it more accessible. Two Nestor pilots (we had tons) and then everyone else judt needs vnis. Was supposed to. Make it cheaper, and those with the spare isk can get the nestors instead of nestors. 
---
Who said anything about complain? Acia said we had overwhelming force. I corrected him, we did not.
---
Not sure why I'm being downvoted, but whatever.
---
if you are in a corp with any pvp players you should ask someone to help you learn to dodge with cloak-mwd. it's much better practice to have someone trying to tackle you.
---
in your particular situation you were probably dead even if you had practice, because the guy was on you too fast. but for normal gatecamps you get 30 seconds to look at the situation and execute it calmly.
---
On the fleets i've been on with the nestor if i weren't flying one we wouldn't have gone out because we were below the 3 person critical mass they wanted to have.
---
Anyway i already have the nestor so not a lot to be done about it now.
---
What were you flying? No one is going to bother ganking you if your ship isn't worth crap. Well, 99% they won't. There's always a chance.
---
I'd disagree with your claim that fleet inties are broken.
---
2 of the four are the only two decent and useable fleet interceptors. Their bonuses are strong, but these ships are so fragile that there exist a variety of counters to kill them in grid.
---
Their EHP is often half or at least a quarter of that of competitive tackle AF fits. Interceptors lack both raw hp and resists compared to that of assault frigs.
---
They do not fit ADC's
---
They have much less capacitor that largely prevents them from local tanking while taking damage. (Something can perhaps be said about the malediction, however glhf ceptoring and trying to get all 8 charges of an ancil off on grid. Reps on the male are largely used to rep in and out of warp on/off grid while the mwd is repairing/not running).
---
Interceptors are countered by a variety of things still. Heavy neuts in falloff still destabilize a ceptor and force it to warp off with the presence of light drones or any other applicable damage when a ceptor travels at base speed.
---
Light drones will also catch ceptors and apply to them reasonably well.
---
I would suggest not changing light tackle ships, but changing attributes of the modules they utilize.
---
As an experienced inty pilot I can speak unbiased and offer balance changes because I know the strengths and weaknesses of these ships.
---
Firstly, reducing the cycle times of propulsion modules and tackle modules would provide a greater disparity of the strengths and weaknesses of inties (and all ships in the game).
---
We are in the age of speed creep. When a player flies their ship, and has a prop mods active, they are committed for 10s at a maximum velocity. Players are simply at the mercy of RNG as to when their opponents mwd cycle activated, and cannot counter-overheat to increase (or decrease if you're wanting to chase) radial velocity.
---
Reduce mwd cycle time (and heat/capacitor stats proportionally) by one half. Give better pilots who have better reaction time something they can use to have something over the ramjag that just decloaked or warped in and goes 8k in the blink of an eye.
---
Reducing mwd cycle time also means that heavy neuts as an element of control are buffed. The issue with heavy neuts if that they don't shut off a med instantly. Capping out a jag at t=1 for the jags mwd cycle means that the Jag will still travel at retarded speed for another 9 seconds and land that scram on our poor battleship pilot.
---
It also means that ceptors have a decreased chance to burn out of range once capped out when neuted.
---
There also comes the added benefit of increasing the amount of heat and controlling rack heat/module damage. Good players will make use of this and foolish mouthbreathers will burn their mods out.
---
Increase the skill ceiling, don't just try and balance outright with ship attributes, the meta is so stale we need this creative idea to be implemented.
---
Reduce tackle cycle time, this is the same as the mwd neuts, there would exist less time for a ceptor to achieve another cycle of their tackle mod of they cycle faster, meaning greater change to escape once a heavy neut caps them.
---
It also means I can finally screen more than one fucking thing every 5 seconds.
---
Nothing is more frustrating telling my gang I can't screen both/all 3/4 targets because I have to wait for my scram to red cycle before I can reactivate.
---
if GSF lost a couple supers during a move op from snuff dropping on them, we'd laugh and call the fc a dummy. 
---
Sure, but it should only be two nestors needed now. Mayhe that was one of the trial days of the new fit.
---
Either way as you said, you have it now. Hopefully some holes appear then 
---
Killing a couple of dumb ratters helps the local market for supers.  We're actually performing a stimulus in a static, deflationary, economy.
---
Sad!
---
Simple attributes like these would be game revolutionizing.
---
And they take 5 seconds to change in a database. However Reddit didn't seem to like capris article I linked a few weeks ago that argued for small changes like these.
---
We need more creative ideas like this to approach balance instead of people screaming for nerfs to everything that oppresses their play style.
---
I remember the zkill disqus comments section. You know how when people are fighting, the argument gets louder and louder until one person screams something heinous they'll regret later? Every comment was like that, without the buildup.
---
The reinforcements were stuck in the same tidi, it didn't change anything on this one.
---
Bhal neuts/nos cycle at 24 seconds per unit. 600 per on neuts. A Talisman Curse with 400 gj neuts per 7.4 second cycle will cap out hat out bro. I've tested all this on Sisi like 20 times. A Bhal would be a crap ship to use. It's cycle is waaaaaaay to long. 
---
CCP Falcon obviosly has allot of love for the Eve Community. He's giving us a kiss. 
---
I'm also worried about losing my autonomy. Brave doesn't offer me a lot of services but they also don't mandate much of me. Even among the other brave corps many of them have activity requirements and i don't know if i can deal with that. Because i play EVE as a 2nd game i will never respond to a ping while i'm raiding in wow, or while i'm sleeping. And i don't want to be kicked out because i didn't respond to enough of them.
---
Xander said something about a bounty. I don't really care about any bounty i've just been scanning to be scanning (i enjoy scanning) and looking for good connections.
---
Feeling overwhelmed? Me too, but I'm still having fun!
---
its a Brave New Horde.
---
Been wanting to play since middle school. Interested in exploring, missions, and PvE at the moment.
---
They have less motivation because it makes less money.
---
Probably, given that i had to refit slightly again when they released the finalized doctrine i'm pretty sure that the one they gave me was a prototype fit.
---
Unless you have got boosting rorqual with PANIC ongrid...
---
Needs duct tape and solar panels.
---
*in rust we trust*
---
I both love and hate this idea at the same time. 
---
I'm not sure what this question means. 
---
WTB Addidas tracksuit in the NES for my Trig character 
---
More like a DST.
---
Drones don't get bonuses from boosts, and DSTs are basically warping jet cans at less cost than an Indy command ship.
---
I think the mistake here is to see this round of changes as the solution rather than the first step in a solution. Rorqs are obviously better than every other mining ship in the game. That was probably not the intention. So that's getting nerfed. Step one.
---
If CCP is serious about fixing the balance and economy problems there will be more updates to come to address other issues. Anyone who wastes money injecting more rorq alts before those changes are clear is taking a pretty big gamble IMO.
---
Mining with multiple covetors/hulks is the most cancerous and painful activity.  Rorquals are getting nerfed but people will still use them because the alternative is terrible.
---
Or a corp that literally has no background checks
---
You don't understand it... Only one person remembers the password and he quit working 9 years ago.
---
It still won't wreck the mining ability of rorqs. They still mine more than exhumers and require extremely low effort. Plus CCP has been known to not revert back to old ways :P
---
I'm sure some folks may rationalize their 290m each hulk swarm that way, but rational minds will likely understand that they can't guarantee a 12 second reaction time over literal hours. Mining is not exactly a high-engagement activity; it's better to hedge against one's human limitations.
---
so test is NRDS?
---
Sure, but it's nut specifically for you. If a bounty for whs gets others scanning, there's more likely to be sites available. 
---
I actually like this. would make ming drone have a real use with hulks.
---
Yeah, I'm not sure I'm. A big fan of the finalised fit. Both work, but whatever. 
---
I will thanks
---
I'd agree that any type of mission running is a bit weird in this sandbox but if you wanna play a basic space mmo you could do that. but running soe and missions got by buddy asking me all kinds of questions about the overview and fitting a ship. it lets them be able to try somethings and figure out how things work. not everyone is a perfect min maxxer that never wants to be told where to go and some people do enjoy little side missions and such.
---
There is a reason BL was on its third dot.
---
Fuckin boters! 
---
I thought Snuff left goons a few months back?
---
Tank nerfs are ok, yield nerfs are annoying.  Barges suck ass.
---
It helps you, though. Sites respawn after they've been finished in the same constellation/region, meaning you are spawning another relic somewhere, for you to get again.
---
It was because running Plex and a premium currency (Aurum) was too much of a ball ache so they just converted Plex to AUR and changed the name
---
The autistshave found their calling!
---
More Trig ships should do just fine. Point me at the drifter 
---
Oh no! Another sub. CCP will be pissed.
---
Oh yeah that makes sense.
---
snuff "left" the imperium which means i guess they don't get to krab in the south anymore, but they're still basically on the same tier as init in terms of being goon vassals
---
if you mean wangs, they were 100% always snuff pets first
---
fedup i guess were goon friendly and yeah kinda fuck those guys
---
CCPlease bring back walking in stations. 
---
Bestower/itteron MK 5
---
Is it more people creating alts for farm or fewer people buying Plex?
---
By your own logic, the very act of selling PLEX is losing you money since it increases supply.
---
Yes they do not have much DPS thats not the point of a supertanker and for said curse I'd need to cycle the repper IDK once every 20 sec or so and I regen the cap to do that in 2 or 3 seconds. My tengu flys with Flux Coils instead of Power Diagnostics and Capacitor Control Circuts so the recharge rate on my Cap is insanely high. You can have 5 neuts at most on the curse which is 400gj*5=2000gj in 7.4 seconds the double cap battery (without abyssal) + subsystems give me 56% Neut resistance after stacking penalty if I did the math right so now we are talking 1120gj per 7.4sec I have a cap recharge of 157gj/s which results in 1161,8 GJ a sec. So no such a curse will NOT neut me out because even if I run shit from time to time you will be empty long before I am.
---
i think the point is this nerf is not going to work as intended. The problems everyone keeps coming back to is the ability to afk/semi-afk/bot this game and the ability to just throw capitals at something you want dead till it dies. 
---
Addendum: Supers in blobs that are only dropped with an entire fleet of supers is casual mode.
---
more motivation because their current setup is losing profit.
---
If players get another rorqual, that is what CCP wants. Another rorqual, another subscription. Rorquals still scale the best even after the nerf.  
---
I'm a rookie, so I may not be too knowledgeable; that being said, I did not believe a Caracal carrying only its own ammunition and modules with it was extremely valuable. Its cost might've been something around 8 million total.
---
really? I'd noticed that if i get filaments its usually not worthless but i don't think i've pulled more than 10-20mil in data sites in null
---
Red alliance and XIX are both russian, Frt and starchaser are both Chinese, and idk who’s side nine continent is on
---
About 6 months ago (or so) I used to daytrip into wormholes from hisec. Of course, at the time, I was poor enough that losing my 3m explo frigate seemed significant, but I remember it was almost always more valuable to just do the data sites, drop the loot off in hisec, and run back into the hole to continue exploring than it was to only seek out relic sites. Perhaps this is different in null, and maybe it's different for richer players, but don't ignore the data sites. They can be worth a decent amount of isk, and since everyone ignores them, they're incredibly easy to find.
---
News at 11.
---
I think it was 3 FAXes and 1 dread?
---
Dude we had TIDI for like 10 jumps out of Camal
---
I think the trick is vertical integration. So yeah your ore and goo is pretty low value, but react and produce everything to make T2 stuff. With the infrastructure in delve and all the T2 prod mods, it's probably a lot quicker of a payoff period. I have no idea about actual numbers though 
---
At least we got 5 minute bio breaks between the warps/waiting for the game to allow us to fucking jump
---
Triglavians. Look at the billboards.
---
IMO, other than the massive size and scale, the best part about this game is the high-risk/high-loss aspect. 
---
Nothing clecnches my ass and pounds my heart more than barely getting away from a gank or pulling a site-heist out from under a group in low. Shit, I almost lost my Machariel blitzing a lvl4 because I my kids momentarily distracted me right when Zor warped in. Never a dull day.
---
Pretty sure no. Hy hates NC with passion. I don't even know why, but one alliance he always maintained to be the enemy #1 ever, like from WWB even - was NC.
---
Only about 800,000 damage?  Did he even cycle the shield booster?    
---
Also, cap booster 3200 vs. navy cap booster 3200 is night and day.  Regulars don't do shit for cap regen.
---
Those are other issues and are bigger and harder to fix. This fix is easy and reduce many issue. It's a good short term solution. Reworking cyno or making mining more active (no matter the ship honestly) are much harder to fix no matter what retarded solution r/eve can think about.
---
lol
---
OK, I've searched through posts to see if I could find something on this, but I haven't been able to.  But, I'm having an odd experience that only just started happening today...
---
I'm noticing that at every jump gate, I'm hearing what sounds like "static-y comm traffic", of two people speaking.  It's a man's voice and a woman's voice, and she seems to be repeating what the man is saying.  One of the phrases is, I think, "Our prayers have been answered", or something to that effect.
---
Is this part of some event?  I'm not seen any notice about this, or heard the sounds before today.  It's getting kind of annoying, if I'm 100% honest, as that it happens at every jump gate.  And as soon as I warp away from it, it stops.
---
Weird...
---
No tape its fake.
---
The most i have pulled was 70m from 1 site due to one drop that was semi good. Otherwise avg site value for me tends to be somewhere in the 7-14m range
---
It omeca fuckwit.
---
I'm pretty sure it wouldn't be that hard to rework excavators into fighters. But yes this game is heavy on the issue side of things and needs lots more dev time to balance it
---
That was an interesting first TIDI fuckfest for me 
---
I wonder what would happen if Donny T watched Rick and Morty
---
Because Russians.

I didn’t either to be honest, when everyone was saying that it was going to die I was just like ok first keepstar kill I guess

It's not balanced, but expect AF/dessie wolfpacks to be the new thing because they're the most isk efficient things in the game and they are able to escape hotdrops.

Umm ackshually you can set autopilot to a destination station, warp to an insta-dock bookmark on the station, engage autopilot in warp, and dock on the same tick as you land, faster than you could manually and even if you leave the keyboard.
---
&lt;/poindexter&gt;
---
Because ram jag is one of the most brainless tackle ships ever devised. You don't get punished for MWDing straight into big guns, you don't die under focused fire, and you're fast enough to catch anything larger than a frigate.
---
It's not about finding a mechanic. If it was about finding a mechanic, CCP would have done it. It's about the mining gameplay being basically afk gameplay. It has always been and people do it because it's relaxing and if it requires constant input it would be the most boring thing to do.
---
I'm totally for active mining as long as it's meaningful, and CCP is never going to rework mining to make it more boring. This would enrage all miners and a lot more than this rorqual nerf.

Are there any differences between losec and null that might affect boosh fleets, do you think?
---
Iv decided I’m going to run an armor rag and there’s nothing DJ can do to stop me. 
---
Ive been saying this forever since the rework. Rorquals should be ONE ship in a belt and the rest should be a combo of exhumers and barges. Boosts should be fucking nuts though. It should double as a mining only FACS.
---
Similar to real life, the leaders of alliances/coalitions just use nationalism to convince line members to support their goals. Do you think the leaders of XIX, RED, DV, etc. really care about any kind of nationalistic sentiment? 
---
If I had to guess, I would assume that when Red Alliance and Midas 22 got kicked out of Period Basis, they came to live with XIX in Tenerifis. XIX realized that Tenerifis is a bit crowded, but they don't want to fight Legacy, and nobody wants to live in Omist (or KWG is paying them to stay out). So the only reasonable place for expansion is into Frat space. So they put together a coalition, and to keep the coalition and their alliances from falling apart, they frame it as a nationalistic coalition, so any Russian who betrays or leaves the coalition can be framed as a traitor to their country.
---
This provides a strong reason to stick together, and any line members with slightly nationalistic views will be way more motivated to keep fighting in the coming war. But at the end of the day, I highly doubt the leaders of these alliances genuinely buy into the national pride narrative. Its just spin.

Yeah, piloting in a super cap blob isn't necessarily Eve on hard mode. But it certainly isn't casual. Piloting a titan, a carrier on your main, and an Apostle on your fax alt requires a decent bit of attention. And if you're not a space trillionaire, committing a \~70 bil ship to a fight in which you might actually lose it, is enough to heighten your awareness.
---
This. Also PLEX is used for all store transactions. They really need to increase the base amount for skill extraction to like 20 mil

[Blog:  Building a balanced universe](https://www.eveonline.com/article/building-a-balanced-universe)
---
I think long after this blog was written, a dev wrote somewhere that locality was an issue, i.e. it wasn't fair in sov battles when some systems were max tidi and the others were not, so constellations have been added into the formula.
---
[this](https://br.inyour.space/?s=4830&amp;b=8525280&amp;e=90&amp;t=euqb&amp;o=1) should be an accurate final BR. It might be 100 mil or so off because of Red Alliance awoxers, but that's the best I can do
---
^ real goon
---
I think long after this blog was written, a dev wrote somewhere that locality was an issue, i.e. it wasn't fair in sov battles when some systems were max tidi and the others were not, so constellations have been added into the formula (not split).
---
Honestly, this just reminds me, as someone who occasionally invests in eve--and I say this realizing that I am a small minority of players--I would love to have the corp/alliance mechanics looked at in the future so that people would have more options when running corps. 
---
For example, I would love it if there were a system for there to be a not necessarily invested board of directors, who can do things like see the corp wallet, approve or disallow corp isk withdrawls and major purchases, force dividend payments, etc. It would also be nice, if such things were implemented, if there was a system to allow for the real public trading of shares in large entities that chose to go public.  
---
It really is, your F1 button is no longer guns it's just a doomsday weapon you occasionally hit when told to.  Even if you are managing an alt the number of super fights where you actually have to manage it are in pretty heavy tidi.
---
Didn't Test just have a nice little super fight with Frat under pretty even conditions considering the flip flop of who could control grid and kill titans?
---
Yeah, how dare they shoot at the megablob that accounts for like 60% of nullsec. That's just crazy talk!

Ok, what amazes me, is that, yes, I understand that TAPI had a grudge to settle with Snuff. But throwing Init. under the bus in the process is what I really don't understand.
---
We've been having a great working relationship where people stuck to their deals. This would have been a major blow to Init. if we had jumped in and for what? TAPI would have done PanFam an extremely large favor. But are those really the kind of "friends" you want?
---
Everyone in Eve knows about the shenanigans Snuff pulls, Init. however, mostly a party that's somewhat more to be trusted.
---
This made the honest to god news and Mar5meca says he wishes he had "$10 for everyone who falsely accuses me of input broadcasting." Like literally, there might not be enough 'evidence' to suggest Mar5meca is using input broadcasting for the types of gameplay that would make it illegal, but this is sure as shit undeniable proof Mar5meca input broadcasts for some things. 
---
Ergo, Mar5meca, nobody is ever falsely accusing you of input broadcasting. 
---
&gt;ou actually
---
Well, you are obviously a steely-eyed missile man. But for me, committing all of those resources to one fight, tidi or not, isn't casual.  
---
I see what you are saying in having the investment of the character but I would disagree with how many injectors it would take. Also, lose that Rorq once and it will take you a long time recoup. The point is the risk, the chances of you being in the negative for a long time is pretty good.

Yeah they did it a few months back and magically there were no more problems with aim botting and cancerous exploits. It's a shame though because they waited way to long for me to just drop the game altogether and never play it or another battle royale rinse &amp; repeat for that matter

Drone Walkers are merging into REQ.
---
I agree with the idea of making excavator mining more intensive, thereby limiting the multiboxability of Rorqs. But I think it might cut into CCP's income too much to be a realistic change. Also, you claim the change would incentivize players to just add more rorq alts, but is there anything about the current system that discourages people from doing that? I don't see how  this update would make people inject rorq alts any more than they're already doing.
---
I'll whore on ship like a dog to the shrine of your lies

I meant this as "Elo's so good he keeps people coming back over and over again" but now that I think about it, my statement is true as both a compliment and an insult to Elo.

I'll fly my sin so you can harden your fife

CCP does.  The cargohold is tiny, so you must use it in a fleet.
---
I know how works, and currently the prices in the whole region were around 190 which was fine by me because i didn't want to travel. What i don't understand is the warning that i am buying something a few trillion % above average.
---
FUCK FACE BOOK
---
feed more muninns lmao. absolute d-tier.
---
Some people didn't want to deal with managing more then they could easily manage.  I have a hard time keeping track of three characters, so the truth is I wouldn't want to run more then two.
---
Also, in my case, one Rorq more or less made all the Isk I needed.  I might have to super rat every once in awhile, but generally one Rorq could Plex itself and pay for my PVP ships if I didn't do dumb shit too often.
---
So yeah, to get to the point, post nerf I'll either have to add a second Rorq (especially since I don't know how super ratting is going to work), or I might just extract the character and see how long I can live off the Isk I would get from that.
---
It has been around for quite some time, you can toggle it off though

Great, more feeders for the feeder alliance.

imagine your alliance being so shit it failscades into req

You weren't ganked. You autopiloted through lowsec. https://zkillboard.com/kill/75753534/

I don't think that means what you think it means.

Perhaps a typo for **scalability**?

---
I don't disagree, I'm just repeating (roughly) what the russians were spouting when they declared this war.
---
War started early because Blood Raiders broke the rules by Praying, proving they're a pack of Fanatics who deserve to have this Omen rammed up their Liver.
---
Hmmmmm....
---
did you go into lowsec, or are you at war?  Ganking a low value caracal just doesn't sound right. 
---
or do it in reverse. so a mining drone from a Rorqual assisted to a hulk will transfer ore from hulk to the rorquals cargo.
---
goes along with my idea of making a rorqual have to assign their excavators in order for them to mine anything. make rorquals need five hulks in the belt with them to be effective.
---
You can play however you want in the sandbox—and so can your hunters.
---
Wasnt that bad back then. Plex being multi-use has driven the price up via extractors/skins.

I would've stoked to have that many sites in one system, beats hopping system to system hoping for a site to hack.

Yeah but toons took time to train, now a days plex is just kind of disappearing down a rabbit hole of sp farm alts. 
---
Yup. I've done over 100 of them recently and not one has been ganked.
---
This just in: nobody attacks people in velators. 
---
Thank you for that piece of info. I could've sworn it was 0.5, but nevertheless, I assumed it was safe to autopilot because most other waypoints were 0.6 and up. This one was the result of choosing prefer fastest (another mistake).
---
Casual players generally don't own Rorquals, or even multi-box them.
---
Casual players are not the intended target.
---
Yep, it's definitely a gamble. But if XIX believes that the Chinese playerbase is largely united under Frat, then a nationalistic war will unify the Russians far more than it will unify the Chinese, so they could judge it as a gamble worth taking. As far as I know, there really aren't many chinese groups within Legacy (the main Russian ally), but Frat looked like it had the support of skill urself and Scourge, and I think Scourge was entirely Russian, and I believe elements of skill urself have worked with Russians before, or are Russian themselves. So by making it nationalistic, they crippled a key enemy and united their own side. 
---
Of course, it would be a mistake to continue using the nationalist narrative after the war is over, as I highly doubt all the non-russian coalitions would enjoy dealing with a very nationalist rival, but for now I think it's an effective tactic.
---
To be honest, the boost are pretty nuts already. It's just that rorquals are ridiculous, which is "justified" with their pricetag. Great plan...
---
Simple answer:
---
C1: Cruiser
---
C2: Battlecruiser
---
C3: Battleship
---
C4: Possible in solo battleship, recommend at least 2
---
C5: Medium sized fleets with lots of love
---
C6: large fleets, don't try
---
Wait is a mino just a logi?
---
Just be sure to align to the side for maximum citadel damage first
---
Wait, shit
---
&gt; fight to remove rorqual mining === goon tears 
---
Wish I could open a time-rift and send that back in time.  Goons mining would get a lot of laughs.
---
It came from some frog that made the reeee sound when it was annoyed so they associated that frog with pepe iirc
---
No idea, I think my corp is at peace. I went into lowsec for just a moment during the trip, a 0.4 system.
---
I saw it hit a tiny amount of TIDI when we were forming, i logged out in a Freeport though so I never saw us on the way back
---
Ah, thank you!  It was starting to drive me nuts, heh...  Hopefully it will stop soon...
---
Calculating Rorq ROI without including moongoo is like estimating super ratting ticks by assuming that you only shoot the NPC battlecruisers.
---
Yes. The problem is, that easy ISK is concentrated in bots &amp; goons. So everyone else gets boned.
---
The volume of PLEX has not changed, availability is the same over time. However CCP has been pushing SKINs as well - so a larger share of the PLEX that was available is now being consumed for NES store items.
---
The problem was with rockets and being so cap dry that they wouldn't fire. Then he would pull range because I had no after burner.
---
Status quo reinforced.
---
I believe this can happen if you have an item for which there are very few (or even no) sell orders, even at a "normal" price, but a ton of buy orders at 1 isk or something, that can massively skew the average and results in bonkers percentage in terms of price difference.
---
Try a brawler Algos. Drones to take care of small targets, blasters to break tanks
---
If it wasn’t for the ability to buy plex and sell it for in-game currency I wouldn’t play this game. Without it I would spend time doing other things besides PvP and would have quit a long time ago.
---
It is easier to multi-box fewer rorquals.
---
Though people already do multi-box huge procurer fleets, they are in the minority.

I wish they'd do a top down redesign of the ore ships so that each truly has a role. A basic idea might be make the porpoise the login ore role. Give it the best bonuses of the three ore ships to shield boosts and logi style bonuses as well. Give the orca the best mining boosts and and largest ore hold. Give the rorqual the ore compression abilities and both strong shield and mining boosts but not as good as the porpoise or orca. Also give the rorqual decent offensive strength making it sort of the protector of the fleet. Allow only one active industrial core on grid. Adding more orcas for more storage is viable and adding more porpoises for more reps is viable 
---
Basically I want to see the most effective composition be at least one orca, porpoise, and rorqual on field with a fleet of mining barges and exhumers. At the moment if you can fly a rorqual and the safety is there it makes no sense to fly anything else.
---
This is broken. Rarely you get a real warning so you should leave it on in case you mistype, but most of the time it’s off by many magnitudes. My guess is that it’s counting outliers when it shouldn’t or that the weighting for outliers is fucked up. I’ve submitted several bug requests and I doubt it’ll change. 
---
point on the doll where penif touched you
---
Impossible, TEST and Frat are clearly allies after Camal :)

Oh right... I need to get started on the Trivia...

*pokes the lore team "*More trig stuff please"

Great, wormholers are like vegans now.

This is only what I have been interested in doing this year. Then there is [what I have done previously ...](https://zkillboard.com/character/90698063/)
---
D E L E T E R O R Q U A L S
---
I'm honestly surprised that it took this long to show up on Reddit...
---
The injectors is just math.  Take the SP required and divide by 400,000 or so (depending if you have an alpha character trained up).  And sure, you could lose the rorq, but if you save the drones you are out about 2.5B to 3B in the hull / fit - insurance.  Which is about 25 hours of mining (yes that is a long time, but not that long).  
---
Liked the vid, thought i'd look up the fit on zkill and found this:

Unlucky DC on a gate? 
---
Only my fleets :P
---
I was standing still in hisec near a Stargate in my reaper while afk and got killed. I'm happy hisec gankers exist
---
I had 3 more ready to go. Skill books bought. Rorquals and drones bought. They are now skilling into exhumers + crystals.
---
Oh I’m definitely considering those options.. some people love pvp, I love to build. I always hate having to “interview” for weeks on end before being able to join though, it’s just annoying.. it a a freaking video game 
---
They are just not relevant enough. 
---
No.  Moon goo is a terrible indicator.   Including it in the numbers would be like including incursion isk with ratting ticks to come up with a ROI on a carrier.
---
 
---
As the incumbent failscade poster of r/eve and dotlan bug reporter #1 I apologize for the invonvenience. Some RL (sandbox gane from Cod Games Inc.) has kept me busy last week.
---
What no bailing wire?
---
I'm going to take a stab at reading the future and state that there will be less rorquals dying after the change (3-5 month sample size) compared to the 3-5 months prior (the period of the highest rorqual deaths ever) and it won't be by a small margin. There will need to be some new big content for whale fleets.
---
There is an infamous ganker in the Niarga corridor that specializes in pods.
---
He's made it an art of ganking low-EHP ships, and them the pos, before CONCORD can do anything.
---
I now AFK in a high-EHP ship, like a Monitor or a heavily plated (and slow) but inexpensive Maller.
---
Yeah skip them, today I found a can with 80 Milli.
---
No, we'll bring more bubbles, that's kind of where we fucked up, a lot of pods warped off, and had a chance to reship.
---
Please show more respect for Texas Law by capitalizing both words.
---
One word:  implants.
---
Having 1b of attribute implants in you head is not uncommon.
---
sounds like when the aux is halfway into the mp3 player.
---
Glad your back, your videos got me back into the game after a break
---
Clever girl!
---
pod james
---
by the way why  james 315 was orginally banned from eve? rmt? cheating?
---
and who is the guy in alliance logo
---
❤️
---
how to spot someone who never flew in a small gang nor knows how modules work 101
---
In the meantime I got awoxed by FRT because Elo.
---
typo
---
Rockets don't use cap.
---
Once you establish an initial orbit, Kritsan moves at like 150 m/s because they are constantly turning to try to move directly away from you.
---
So, a couple of things about this. First, bubbles shouldn't work:
---
&gt; Ships undergoing emergency warp upon appearing in space have no means to activate modules, cancel warp, or otherwise defend themselves during this period; **they cannot be stopped by any warp disruption mechanic.** Bumping them during this period renders the ship in question utterly helpless, against the intention of the game mechanics. 
---
This looks to be a change from the stance of the dev response you found. The dev response pre-dates the exploit article.
---
Next, you still do spawn in space and then enter warp. It's mostly noticeably when logging in a freighter or something else with an align time in the area of 40-60 sec. If you want an example of this try logging in an unfit freighter in space.
---
While I share your view, humans are still tribal creatures that cling together in similar groups.
---
Yes. It won´t change anything beyond people adding more rorq alts while CCP milks as much money as they can out of this dying game. So from a business standpoint i think it´s justified. 
---
&gt; The reason why the numbers are so low are because Rorquals are so safe. 
---
This is the issue. And they are not safe everywhere. They are only safe in the umbrella space.
---
Yield nerfs are not the answer. It is stupid to invest 6b in a ship just to get 100m in return.
---
If Rorquals sufficiently contributed to the overall ecosystem of the game by dying often, then suddenly those 15-boxers of Rorquals would be an asset to this game than a liability.
---
If CCP/CSM wants to address the Rorqual problem, they should talk to people who hunt capitals under supercap umbrellas. Give us the tools/environment we need today, and we will start culling those Rorquals and providing content for many people today. We need mobile cyno inhibition rework, further anom balance, and increased hostile mobility in umbrella space.
---
We don't want a game where there are no Rorquals anymore. We want a game where it is sufficiently risky to use one, but equally profitable so people still use it.
---
How dare you sully the good name of our Supreme Protector! He is not banned from EVE. 
---
Pretty funny actually, so fought the fight from the video, warped off, wanted to reship to fight again but the gang was blocking the way out so I ejected in a safe spot and self destructed my pod. I forgot about the poor scorpion for like 4 hours or something, went back and it was still there. Warped to a station at 0 and landed 2k off, there was diamond rats there and I didnt have a prop mod so they got me. Quiet a sad end for that scorpion after tanking so well. 
---
Than you're not following the cardinal rule of eve. Don't fly what you can't afford to lose, especially nowadays when isk is at its easiest to get
---
Fat chanse!
---
Now that kb is more reasonable
---
considering what XIXs super fleet has been through id hardly say this is "eating shit". this is more like "oh we only lost 2 this time, not bad" kinda thing
---
You play eve with sound?
---
You can always turn it off if it bothers you.
---
It was made very clear TEST does not give two shits about INIT.  Our bad for not realizing this sooner.  Good news, now we know, and no Supers had to die.  
---
Is it? I accept donation. 
---
Every major bloc has been working on trying to grab a share of the chinese population. It is nowhere near united.
---
don't read reddit as a new player, 90% of posters are so shit it's mind boggling, you'll just get bad advice or overblown dangers(see threads about solo moving supers and the comments sperging out that its too hard, like clockwork).
---
Sweet, I played that game before. Got boring around year 2.
---
You can have and show pride even as a member of a strong coalition.  Would you tell BRAVE or another Legacy alliance the same thing to break away from TAPI?
---
I totally agree with you, have an upvote
---
The problem recently is that PLEX prices have bee skyrocketing and injector prices haven't kept up. If you are buying your supplies during sales when you can get them at a significant discount, or if you are using ghost training, you can still make a profit. Otherwise you are probably loosing some ISK if you are only skill farming and buying PLEX at it's current price on the market. It is still a good option for things like rorq pilots that you no longer need to train, but need to stay omega. This is also contributing to keeping injector prices from rising, as rorq pilots and other alts don't need to make ISK off their extracted SP, they just need to pay for their sub.
---
Boi
---
ITT:  Rorq pilot bitches, convincing non-Rorq pilots that CCP must be onto something.
---
More semi-afk rorqs are a bigger target and greater incentive to go hunting them, while not giving the rorq pilots more for their money.
---
Hey thats valuable screen space I'll be missing if I do that
---
Give it month.... You will see there is so much more.
---
Weren't DW the toast of the Delve eviction so many years ago because they refused to give up and dropped supers etc etc?  I guess it just shows how long ago it was that they're viewed so poorly now.
---
Its us, TRYRM. TRYRM is recruiting......

What are the most active C2- Nss corps atm. I see tuskers went to Thera.  Hotline K162 have gone quiet.  Not sure who is left.

Will be there again - great weekend of fun with nerds.
---
Minokawa is Caldari FACS
---
I learned my lesson last year. don't worry
---
Has anyone done the new math of a perfect exhumer (hulk + t2 crystals) vs a rorq with 5 excavs post nerf?
---
hi racist
---
CCP used to have economists on staff helping to stabilize the economy. Maybe they should re hire.
---
It will only pull them max 400k from where they warped too. So no
---
Probably the best bet is to put something in the bio of the structure asking for donations for fuel. That will make the out of corp miners more likely to pay something than otherwise. If they see you are not being a dick about it, maybe they won't be either. 
---
No way to force it though but bumping them might be an option.
---
Shame, I used to enjoy their fleets during the TCU days.
---
No but it is possible - not easy though - to smart bomb people mid-warp.
---
What ship were you in, and did you have any expensive cargo? They will ship and cargo scan you, so they’ll know how much loot they can expect to get and exactly how much dps to bring 
---
So a bubble at 400km off a gate will work but anything farther out won't? How big are grids? 
---
Wtf how haha 
---
Similarly, I've always wondered if ships with the same warp speeds will always drop midwarp bookmarks in the same locations. Never bothered testing it though.
---
Have you ever heard about fuel trucks/pure bridging BO? 
---
Jk I looked it up
---
Tldr we wanted to blue the other half of the game but they didnt reeeee
---
Nothing of value was lost
---
12k on average but some are weirdly stretched by things around them 
---
Dw were never in delve. They formed as a splitoff of alternate allegiance or alliance or so after dcu people had a fallout between themselves. They lived in tenal for a while together with some former phoenix company alliance people iirc before they joined legacy after test and co2 lost tribute and the vale. They were originally drone land people.
---
thats a bridge-bitch. not meant for transporting stuff, just for briding...
---
No, DWs were formed during WWB up in Tenal.
---
You don't jump through the gate when you land on it , there is a few ticks where a smartbomb or amazingly timed bomb can hit you
---
I was driving a Caracal with a few missiles loaded, that's all.
---
Sooooo fuel trucks=\=transporting? Hmmk 
---
Can I look at your zkill? Please post it
---
The nerf to tank will make for much more interesting hunting fleets in delve. It is much easier for groups to field the 50 bombers it will take to break the tank than the 100 previously. 
---
No matter what you say here, I guarantee you far more delve/fountain/querious rorquals will die after this patch per month than previously. 
---
Chances are you came out isk positive lol
---
I think certificates are CCP’s answer to skill trees. You can see the certificates available in each skill category. Each ship also has mastery levels that tell you which certificates to train to best use that ship.
---
Nobody else is entirely dependent on rorquals to justify their playstyle. 
---
Moongoo is a renewable resource that you control in your territory, just like mining anoms and belts. The presence of moongoo is central to the return on investment in a Rorqual for many groups - a decent moon yields billions in a couple of hours. Plenty of groups regularly mine R32s and R64s because the isk is so good, but wouldn't be caught dead mining standard ores or ice. Incursions are entirely different - they are not a renewable resource that you control, because they only sporadically appear in your territory.
---
I had a good chuckle over this
---
How do you turn it off?
---
Then go for it! Why even complain about the proposal then... infact get the 14 now while you can still take advantage of the higher ticks. 
---
My time in code, we never once attacked a war decced target...
---
Oh yeah, I had over 200 mil. I replaced my Caracal no prob.
---
Was expecting jamming fleet, left disappointed.
---
RIP in-game browser
---
literally the first time im hearing about this
---
Not always same location but sometimes the same grid. 
---
Your assumption is that every rorqual is caught in a belt, there are dozens of rorquals every hour taking gates and jump bridges in delve. I would not think to go for one before this patch because I could not call up 100 bombers. 
---
I can hope to get 50ish bombers so this patch will make a VERY big difference to delve rorqual safety. 
---
I guess in the sense that my muninn is transporting medium projectile ammo sure
---
BigPops is kinda mean.
---
if you bookmarked between celestials and you stick there I can warp to you without probing you. I have done this plenty of time, just requires quick fingers on bookmarking the spot when you appear on the overview midwarp.
---
Moon goo ends up being a small small portion of the overall ore mined by rorqs.  In addition it sucks to mine as it goes quickly, the rocks are small, and you can't compress.  If you are using a rorq for only moon goo you are doing it wrong. 
---
In addition, most R64s or R32s are either 1) owned and mined by corps, e.g. you won't see the isk yourself or 2) a mad free for all that lets you get maybe 1 rock at best of R64.  Neither of these cases should apply to calculating a ROI.  
---
I bought two rorquals and 3 hulks for 25bil for my 5 accounts. I mined ice netting around 1bil an hour. So within 25 hours of playing I made 1 bil an hour from my gametime. I then got board and sold the mining fleet for 23bil stripped all rorqual skills and I netted 120bil by the time I was done after my 3 months of spod brain.
---
This is my story and the story of most people who turned to rorquals to accomplish their eve isk objective. 
---
This mining was done with near 100% safety, only being tackled twice by insignificant fleets that could not hurt a proper tanked rorqual to begin with. 
---
Code does suicide ganks, not wardeccs
---
Got my early early bird ticket ready to go, now I just have to decide if I wanna drive halfway across the country or break down and fly instead... decisions decisions...
---
With your changes there would be no Rorquals - noone would be stupid enough to invest 35B+ in skills+ship+drones so *you* can have *your* content 
---
Lmao bro a tank nerf doesn’t affect our dudes in any way shape or form - have you seen some of the rorqual fits that come out of Delve?? Unless somehow drone navigation computers and inertia stabilizers are givin -% shield / armor in this upcoming patch I believe everything will remain as it has.
---
No small feat with you swinging from their nuts. 
---
Where are the wingy bits?
---
This entire thread is a wally thread bro. the fort was anchored by lumpy months ago, was sold to rote, and when it became clear that we (iron/nsh/bums) were about to shoot it, rote transferred it over to the TNT corp to ticker tank it (due to a third the attacking force having a strategic pact with TNT).  
---
It's a well played form of hiding, we expect nothing less than that from rote.
---
Different environments, I suppose - you've traded profit potential for security if you're mining in an environment where the "good stuff" is scooped up by the corp. Good luck with the changes, though, and I do appreciate the post - it's always interesting to see the math driving some portion of Eve's behavior.
---
It's a simple taxation problem. 
---
Currently, umbrella miners lose 3% of their mining income to hostiles. Think of it as a content tax. 100% or 50% tax would make it irrational to mine. But 3% is too low and we all agree Rorquals are too safe. 
---
it's not hard to take that number to 20%s by gradually buffing the hunting side. A 20% content tax does not imply complete inoperability for miners. If 20%s are reached, CCP can even think about buffing the yield again.
---
Really wish CCP would appear to balance with real math in mind more often. Good math, like the suggestion, +1 from me as usual stitch
---
Can confirm, literally farming providence for years has made for some mushy brained 'codes' being put into practice. Paging Boop-master  [**u/Meiqur**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Meiqur/)**,** whom put into the practice of reinforcing a structure/killing an evictus structure for every anchorable bubble killed!  
---
Provi are really fun like that, which means we can be super adaptive and fun with our super duper honourable actions 
---
I like the idea of the excavators working like fighters.  I don't mine so i don;t know anything about its effect but why wouldn't this work?
---
How was it made clear?
---
We need to compare CNI with StabberFI, ONI and Exequror navy.   Not with those you posted. 
---
 You can smash some interdictor snowflakes with that explosion radius bonus.
---
Either way it’s dead now
---
You're thinking of Walltreipers.
---
You pay for a month's game time as get the game time, so there's nothing to refund. I get the argument of investing time/money against future use (ie I pay for Omega for a year with the intention of having a character skilled and equipped to a certain level), but in reality he has already gotten what he paid for. Only reasonable question would be whether he's entitled to a refund of at remaining unused gametime, such as if he got a six month sub last month, in which case I can see arguments for and against, and would require an explanation if that's being denied (although he could reverse the charge via PayPal/card/whatever if that's the case).
---
The issue is, if they say "these 6 transactions flagged", he can go "oh, so that 7th one didn't? let's work out what's different and do that in future". Obviously that's assuming he's guilty, which they clearly are, hence why it wouldn't be worth the risk revealing anything.
---
That actually happened to me. A corpmate and I warped to the same celestial with the same ship. We both dropped a BM midwarp, and ended up at the same location when we came back to it. It was completely unintended, so we didn't investigate further, but it definitely blew our minds. It must be tick related, so I guess there are a finite number of BM you can do for the same warp.
---
 a cheap ship should not be strong, you want a really good buy cerberus 
---
nice i love it
---
Except China is a geographic area not a race of people so thanks for showing you’re not only a bigot but a retard as well 
---
None of those fit missiles... missiles require different CPU/PG requirements than turret ships do. They are also balanced differently due to the ranges at which they operate. If i'm going to fly a missile ship, i'm going to compare what other missile ships can achieve. 
---
The ones i chose are correct for the comparison. If you disagree, then explain to me why the Stabber FI, ONI and Exeq NI should be compared to a missile ship.
---
It might completely stop my Industrial Operations if I don't add another account for mining to my current 2 account setup.
---
If I'm not calculating wrong the changes might just end my Industrial Career.
---
I wish they would just change excavators to fighters.
---
Who am I thinking of then? It's probably a completely different name.
---
Name checks out. 
---
I think it would be great if all the echumer holds where 2x the size
---
Vedhac all the way!
---
Yeaah this is annoying tbh 
---
Your comparisons are bad, I don't see why you are comparing the CNI to the Orthrus - which is a pirate faction ship. However this is the only change in the upcoming patch notes that is bad. 
---
The proposed drone changes don't give the caracal a good role. It's still going to be underused because it's a bad ship.
---
The problem I think is that it doesn't have a unique role. It's supposed to be a better caracal, but the Nosprey already fulfills that role. So yeah, they can just make the cara navy better but then it just replaces the nosprey. 
---
TBH I'd be happy if they gave it an armor layout, just b/c there's not a good navy armor missile platform yet (even though lore-wise that doesn't fit with Caldari). 
---
Yes, if they warped from and to the same spot, they'll be in the same position (or at least within the usual 2.5km radius warp sphere)
---
I reflexively started typing why not both, but that doesnt really work here..... If you end up driving and want one I can try and find you a carpool buddy.
---
You're right, that's not even close. I'm dumb.
---
Cerberus fills a completely different role (its specialized, hence T2). Its a long range missile ship. The CNI is better at brawling or application fits.
---
Also, the CNI with the stats listed don't even out dps the cerb if using kinetic, and the cerb is way better at RLML than the CNI (since its gets range bonuses). The Cerb is a RLML/HML sniper, while the CNI would be better at shooting down a ship size with HML/HAM.  
---
Also, a VNI  can out dps' a Gila, and its cheaper. So your theory kind of goes out the window.
---
Also, don’t discount the fact that most people play this game in High Sec and most of those don’t necessarily PVP.  
---
Would be great if CCP played their own game so they might get some understanding of how to actually do ship balance 🙄
---
Wait a second, everything drops...I had thought that even hangar drops were subject to the loot fairy.
---
I'm not your friend, pal.
---
**The GOOD NEWS is:** you can take either side of this trade.
---
If it is ridiculously expensive, become a seller and not a buyer.
---
This would also support CCP.
---
I skip rookie ships with new players because I'm looking to get a salty response to my pod killing service invoice from an eight-year high sec veteran who never chatted with another human in game.
---
Please god let this be true lol
---
Our corp pays out scanning awards, so there are always people out scanning and finding content. We also have a requisition order service. You put up a req order, pay a small fee, and a corp member hauls your stuff in. Otherwise, we get a decent highsec every few days and just make a few runs.
---
Living in a wormhole isn't as bad as you think.
---
I’m In goon swarm and we have a great moon mining set up. I was getting 1000 per m3 earlier today mining shimmering chromium
---
I just want to comment that while 5 drones won't address the CNI's biggest flaws, they would be VERY WELCOME on the Enforcer, the worst force recon ship and the worst covops ship in EVE. Please CCP give this ship, which has a physical drone bay on its model, a drone bay.
---
Sounds like we need to get them to submit formally in writing all timers they plan on attending at least 24hours in advance so we can let them know they have to stand down anyway 
---
If this change was as insignificant as StainGuy claims, we wouldn't have so much goon weeping going on in the background.
---
So how do wormholes work? I've just had my first experience with one. I scanned it down, got into wormhole space, scanned a data site, went there, and finally, I got shot by NPCs. Is a cloaking device the only way to survive this or did I just need a better ship (died in a Magnate).
---
It's pretty common in EvE. Russians have often stuck with other russians to fight people while there was fighting that had to be done. When not they'd fight each other :P Speaking the same language and being in the same TZ is of course also a big factor.

Yes. Rorqual max yield goes down from 225 to 180 m³/s and Hulk increases from 56.8 to 59.1 m³/s (+ 5.67 from frones, unchanged).

You can override stats in Pyfa to match the buffed/nerfed values.

I don't think you realize how much you just changed my life.
---
It's not the affordability of the potential loss that is the crux. If I lost my titan, I would replace it. But I argue that to me (and most of Eve players, regardless of the ease of making isk) a titan loss is not an insignificant thing.
---
CCP has had several Plex sales this year already.

I use autopilot sometimes when I'm just podding to a far away destination in a clone with no valuable implants. It's just easier to hit autopilot and do something else and I'm not really risking anything other than the time i lose if i have to start over.

Amended Addendum: outnumbering your enemy is casual mode.
---
&gt; I had too much money for mining to be fun.

If you want, I could take that isk off your hands for you. Then you could have fun mining again!

There are data/relic sites in wormhole space that are protected by sleepers. As a T1 explorer, you'll wanna stick to ones that aren't guarded (the pirate ones). Avoid ones that say "unsecured" or "forgotten". If you're not sure, you can always warp to 100km away to check it out from relative safety first.
---
no hictor bubbles to prevent people from warping on you, no bombs so stukas are kinda pointless
---
just comp more booshers and boosh at regular intervals whether or not anyone is warping on you. in that much tidi, there's no way anyone, competent or not, can land a fleet on you in the 15-30 seconds between booshes while you steer your fleet for the next one
---
i'm honestly a little taken aback that you're taking the easy way out on this one - "we couldn't do it because reasons"
---
If you're talking an emotional loss I think you need to unsubscribe for a month or so
---
If recouping a titan loss has no impact on you, your isk wallet, or for that matter any factor of your game-play, then refer to my steely-eyed missile man comment above. You have reached the Eve endgame. Congrats.

You can decloak cloaky ships in the warp tunnel too. Makes it funny to decloak covert ops seconds before they land on gate.
---
So I like the idea of doing exploration/ combat sites as my active playstyle while doing mining for semi-afk isk while I read or do chores or whatever, and then doing manufacturing in the background for some passive isk. My main issue is that I hate dealing with the logistics of obtaining the materials and BPs/ selling the products when manufacturing. Are there any organizations that cater to people like me by providing the mats, then taking and selling the product and just giving me like, say, 50% of the profits? That would be completely worth it to me.

I mean, ultimately CCP owns the game and can refuse services, at least in the United States, for nearly any reason. Given that, it doesn't matter which transactions CCP thinks is clean or not. They have a list of flagged transactions, it could be one, or it could be a hundred. 
---
My response, were I CCP, would be something like: 
---
*There were four transactions which involved the transfer of isk to an account, which transferred the isk to another account that we have verified are RMT transactions. These transactions were: 
---
April 3, 2018: Transfer of a trillion isk to the character Genario Standard;
---
May 31, 2018: Transfer of 500 billion isk to the character Goldfarmer; 
---
February 10th, 2019: Transfer of 50 billion isk to the character Eye Buyisk; AND 
---
March 15th, 2019: Transfer of 200 billion isk to the character Azathio. 
---
Furthermore, your account has been penalized three times since 2006 for purchasing isk in a verified RMT transaction and you received a week ban in August of 2011 for circumventing concord. 
---
The combination of your accounts transfers to other accounts in RMT transactions, combined with your account's disciplinary history has led or customer services and game security team at CCP to suspend your account indefinitely. 
---
We understand that you have played this game since 2006, and this was not an easy decision for us; however, your history and your RMT flagged transactions are a serious violation of the EULA, which you agreed to on these dates:
---
.......
---
Specifically, this portion of the EULA [insert EULA citation here] spells out that RMT transactions are not allowed under any circumstances not approved by CCP, and furthermore specifies the in-game and out of game legal action that may result from the violation of this agreement.
---
This decision cannot be appealed *
---
Something as simple as that. 
---
You just have to be in the AOE of a smartbomb in the exact server tick it fires. So you need a lot of luck to hit something or a long line of smartbomb BS in the right positions to shred frigates mid warp.

I really wish we could have any actual MMO who tinkers with these numbers come out and respond. Actual MMO devs who actually talk even awkwardly better than a PR rep trying to make a joke.

And how do I get back to normal space? Inside the wormhole I warped toward a data site, but I couldn't find the wormhole anymore? Can I just bookmark it upon entry or is it something else?
---
So both. Is there a way to see specifically how many buy or sell orders have gone through?
---
“How about you feed us kills?”
---
“No, how about you feed us kills?”

“How come CCP is not fixing their game so we can have fun?”

10% sales were regular at third party resellers. 40% sales would be half the month. Galaxy packs were on sale for months at a time on humble bundle at 40%, plex packs 30% off.
---
&gt;Can I just bookmark it upon entry
---
Bingo
---
Yup! Bookmarks are essential in wormhole space. Always bookmark at least your way back. You can also make a bookmark mid-warp to create a safe spot that no one will find unless they combat probe you.

I've been roaming in the FW zones spamming a Tormentor build that seems to be very coming. The fit is 7 mil and I've lost about 7 ships so far with no kills. I'm enjoying myself and I'm not worried about the isk. I'm probably going to try the Tristan and Algos next. The Tormentor fit is using small energy turrets. It seems like it would be a waste of time at this point to skill up small energy turret skills instead of other broad turret skills like accuracy, fall off, tracking, rapid fire, etc.
---
Makes sense I guess. 
---
I'm jealous if you have the ability to mine R32s and R64s on a regular basis.  Maybe it is more common than i think.

Marshal also has a drone bay on it's model *wink* *wink* CCP
---
Shouldnt you be cutting some wood ?
---
Enforcer and Pacifier. Both are cool looking ships but are with their current stats expensive garbage. Giving the Pacifier at least a 25m³ drone bay and the Enforcer at least a 50m³ would help them being usable at least a tiny bit.
---
I asked her and she said that it doesnt help at all. 
---
even then it doesn't matter because you literally have about 5 seconds of warp invulnerability that you can use to dock
---
You can still be bumped while invuln
---
&gt; But are those really the kind of "friends" you want? 
---
How many alliances on your side you need for fight Panfam, or even kill a low-sec keepstar? 
---
It's because ppl like you that eve is not interesting anymore. 
---
I think you’re going about this the wrong way. Buffing the caracal navy to be able to use missiles better will likely end up in a “shitty osprey navy” situation since the roles overlap so heavily. They’re both shield missile boats with the application bonus being the differentiating factor.
---
Personally I would overhaul the whole thing and turn one of them into a hybrid platform. It could be focused on range (to contrast the moa that has the brawl bonuses). You could transplant the current osprey navy stats onto the caracal navy and change the osprey navy for consistency reasons.

ye l got the email, but ccp couldn't even give us a bonus for doing it so l will just wait till someone uploads it to you tube to see what it was like

While you missed this fight, the pattern is likely unchanged and you probably made the right call.
---
it was worked this way long time ago, not any more. 
---
Nerf the excavator drones, but make them much cheaper. My fully buffed and implanted Orca only mines at about 20-30% of my fully buffed and implanted Hulk (can't remember the exact math). I don't understand why the Rorquel doesn't follow the same principles. A fully buffed and implanted Rorquel should mine at about the speed of one fully buffed Hulk, it currently is the opposite with the mining speed of about 3-5 Hulks depending on your skills. 
---
I just think its balance is all out of wack and its lost sight of its roll within the game. The Rorquel should be a bigger more expensive Orca following the same role the Orca plays in a fleet. But it currently does everything itself at a very expensive price tag requiring no collaboration. When mining these days I see more Rorquels on grid than I do Exhumers.
---
With that said it needs to go both ways, if you nerf the Rorquels mining speed you can't be asking them to pay 3-5 billion for excavator drones. The price of excavator drones matches their power. But I just don't understand why you would ever have drones worth 2x more than the ship they are held in.

times where you can plex your accounts are over now...
---
If you are just announcing that plex has reached the 2b milestone - ok that was a long time coming.
---
If you are one of the people trying to pay for game time with isk only - i hope plex reaches 10b soon, hobbies like games cost rl money and it's time people acknowledge that.
---
If you are paying with isk for your alts - if your alt is not paying for itself, maybe you should not have it if you can not afford it.

I'd take it on the Pacifier but honestly the Pacifier is at least fun to fly. Fast, fast, blazing fast with great scan bonuses. Really a joy to scan chains down in. Zip across Thera in seconds. Fun!
---
The Enforcers is a HOT MESS. Terrible damage, terrible tank, useless bonuses, little utility. Look on zkill... there are no losses because NOBODY flies them. At least if it had drones it could get more damage, more survivability, etc.
---
Or got the Pacifier route and make it warp at like 10 au/s. Still not a great ship, but at least more fun to cruise around in.
---
Ack sad ending :(
---
I think the 'bonus' is contributing to research that could make Eve better.  
---
&gt; i hope plex reaches 10b soon
---
&gt; If you are paying with isk for your alts - if your alt is not paying for itself, maybe you should not have it if you can not afford it.
---
I don't have alts, cannot afford them with RL money, can just about afford my one char and some months i'm having to eat into my wallet to fund it... and my wallet is running dry quick. But yeah nice to know you think it should be 10B real thoughtful 
---
i did it for all 6 of my accounts from 2010-2014
---
no?   
---
In a super it literally only takes around 8 hours to sub
---
that's the spirit &lt;3
---
Go to it, I say. We were reddit's darlings for just *ages*, and it's really kind of relaxing to be the bad guys for a spell.
---
that doesn't mean the price in isk should be low enough to let everyone buy it 
---
This isn't looking good at all - effectively the price of PLEX going up would correlate mostly to a downturn in people paying real world currency to the gaming developers.  
---
It's a supply/demand curve issue,   this is making the game we're all playing financially non viable (in my view)
---
keep it mind, like myself.. not everyone has a super, or 3+ rorqual chars
---
Oh ok
---
I personally think alpha accounts were a mistake and we should bring up the paywall. Alpha VNI chars are a fine example of why.

Enforcer is basically hanger candy.

jump into incursions for another 15 hours and you have 2b to buy your plex.

There, its not hard for new bros either

Sorry I wasn't clear. I love the content you're sharing here and wish I could join in the fun. However I have a friend in OC and I've spoken to others saying USTZ always seems dead in J-space. I was wondering if you knew of any WH corps that were primarily USTZ

i thought they were already dead, weird

Literally just ask them?

Back when I lived in wormhole space it was common practice to let leaving members evac their stuff, even if they left on not so good terms. Actual awoxers/spies/corp thieves excluded of course.

Video games are entertainment and not crucial to your well being. If it's not something you can afford, look into goong from Omega to Alpha. There's still plenty of gameplay options for you as an alpha.
---
I still think it was a *SOFT* nerf.
---
They should have gutted its mining yield by 80%. Took away the ability to cyno while invuln. Dropped invuln period to a max of 2 minutes.
---
The only buff it should have received was mining boosts.
---
Its a Mining Boost ship, like the Orca. It shouldnt be 3-4 Exhumers with the tank of a FAX
---
It's been my experience that early USTZ is when most of the action happens. Hawks, Novac, MCAV, Reload this, and Sound all have significant, if not majority, USTZ numbers. 
---
Couldnt people just "get additional griffins" and make every fight impossible?
---
Sure people can get more rorquals, but a lot of people dont have the mental capacity to run more then 4
---
And all the casuals that pays for plex instead of boring Ingame grinding for isk will love it. 
---
This is making the game we're all playing much more financially viable (in my view) 
---
They should give the Marshall 60 mb/s and +1 maximum drone control so I can pretend it really is a DEagle shooting 6 rounds of justice at targets
---
If we're gonna pull bonuses out of asses, how about make them all d-scan immune hnnnnnngggg
---
grrr euros
---
The Pacifiers high warp speed only really matters in huge systems like Thera, but most systems are much much smaller. I actually tested it, my instawarp Astero is actually faster traveling through multiple systems, because any advantage the higher warp speed of the Pacifier is eaten up by its shit agility.
---
So give Guardian-Vexor bonus to the Marshal?
---
why should everyone be able to plex and not pay for Subscriptions? 
---
I don’t think they’ve done that since Dr. Eyjo left. And certainly they don’t have anyone qualified to do it since Quant left more recently. 
---
If they’re doing anything with seized plex they’re occasionally dropping it in events now instead of seeding it on the markets to drive supply up. 
---
For how much it costs I want it to update and optimize my video drivers
---
its never been low enough for everyone to buy it
---
It's actually not that bad now for a status symbol ship.
---
In theory, but that should have been the Nosprey. So CCP already kind of boogered that up. Its kind of weird to have a caracal hull as a hybrid platform (not saying it shouldn't be done, just that it kind of breaks the whole caracal hull is missiles).
---
I think there is a big distinction between the Nosprey and Naracal. The Nosprey is a great RLML platform since the velocity bonus applies to light missiles. Its like a cheap pocket orthrus. However, its not as great as a HAM brawler or HML kiter. Whereas the Naracal would be better at brawling with HAMs and application fit HML for kiting/fleets.  
---
Also, since the nosprey dps is split between drones/missiles and the Naracal is all missile damage, it would perform better at range since all of its dps is accounted for without relying on drones to fly to the target and actually hit it.
---
So, does anyone else not see the fucking issue here?
---
Big corps are complicit and actively involved in botting,  their retaliation here shows they knew the extent at which their own alliance mate was doing this shit - because they were doing it themselves. 
---

They have not been on sale since September.

When 20 hours of pressing f1 in a 100% safe incursion lets you do it, it is low enough for everyone to buy it.

I know, I'm mainly joking. As far as I'm concerned Pacifier and Marshal are fine for their bling level but Enforcer is disgusting in terms of value/cool factor/fun factor.
---
What does this even mean?

I know I am. Work too much to want to PvE after playing this game for 10 years, but a day of work for months of ships? I'm down.

---
Thanks for the info, cheers!

Problem is supply and demand. More and more people are able to fund more and more accounts due to the fact that it is easier to make isk and skill inject into things they need to do it. And skill injectors are a competitive market to plex because they allow people to print isk once a month from several accounts without having to pay for it. This drives the price of plex up. They don't need to print isk from plex to buy things and instead purchase up more of the plex from the market to fund game time. This makes for less supply to be able to buy in game. Drives the price up. What needs to happen is skill injectors need to go away.
---
&gt;Voila. Democratic socialism in Eve. Tax the rich for the health of overall ecosystem. And what you're saying is no different than what RL billionaires are saying when we want to tax them more.

Why shouldn't people that aren't super ratting be forced to pay in cash and not in PLEX ? Your stupid argument works both sides. Why shouldn't I be able to enjoy the game ? Just because I'm not a braindead zombie ratting in a Super ? Nice selfishness here dude. 
---
Combat interceptors are no longer nullified, so Taranis isn't really an option now.  
---
It's doable but takes way more time than with a bonused ship, even with t2 probe launcher and t2 analyzers.  
---
Cloaky nullified t3c is where it's at, so good.

Combat Interceptors lost the ability to be nullified, i.e. Taranis, Raptor, Claw and Crusader.

---
Plex doesn't appear out of nowhere.

Shouldn't those that have committed years towards skilling into a super or enough cash to buy character that has have an easier time making PLEX money?

It's something they really should think about doing again 
---
how is right now different than any time in the past when plex has gone up in value (ie every year of its existence)?
---
Just a little one sided on BR. 
---
Financially non-viable? Just sub for a year...it’s like 14 USD a month or something if you do that...
---
i love that ohotnik lost another rag
---
I just hold on to plex. It’s the best idea. Isk will always inflate. 
---
It's not about being faster, it's not giving a chance for manual error 
---
It's happening...and no-one in Eve gives 2 fucks, there is literally no reason to test it for us and we literally have no clue regarding how it will impact our gameplay and Eve in general. All it is is something for a tech demo they can point to and say 'we did this with this new tech!' but with no bones on the tech nor explaining to the testers what it's meant to do, there is literally no interest. I've asked around in GSF and people just say 'nah I'm not bothering' and 'they want 10,000 people to test it? How? There is no incentive nor reason for me to go and test it when I can be in fleet in game shooting dudes'.
---
   
---
    
---
The lack of communication in the lead up to this has killed the test IMO. I hope it works, but I have zero interest in testing with it being this close, with so little info. All it seems like to me is a large fight on Sisi with no consiquence, no initiating factor and zero reason for me to be engaged nor interested. I'm not alone (though I don't speak for anyone but myself) but it feels like CCP is simply trying to prove to PA 'Hey we can do new stuff! Look!' then proceeds to shoot themselves in the foot yet again.
---
We need something to interest us as players to test this vs what we would normally do in the actual game. The track record of implimenting tests and demos to Eve is bad and if it works (honestly an't remember an instance where it has outside of brain in a box) it's takes a very long time to get intot he actual game from the testing and people are getting bored of stagnent state Eve is currently in right now with dwindling numbers and the only reason for mass conflict dissaprearing from a mechanics point of view (the ONLY thing this is being done for for in game mechanics due to it being for massive fleet fights) the tach is most likely going to be used a few times a year at most and when it is it will fail for the first few times used, crash the serer and the 'loosing' side would simply not log back in and there we go, yet another dissapointment and true to form for the track record of CCP.
---
Look I hope it works out, I'm doubtful and the communication surrounding it has been shit and the willingness of the people I've talked to to test it is practically zero. I do not expect more than 1,000 people test it and would honestly be shocked if the number is over 500 unless one of the big groups has been approched by CCP to get people to join to the test.
---
do incursions then. 20 hours 2b, not counting lp.

If you want to enjoy the game, pay for a sub, chasing plex is one of the reasons people stop playing this game. 3

it's ridiculously easy to detect regardless of whether you do pvp/pve in and of itself
---
Sure, outliers who decide "I'm going to buy a big pack of PLEX and profit"
---
If you can't see that this is effectively "Less people are buying PLEX meaning you have to pay more to get it" - I don't know what the fuck I can tell you?  Downvote me.
---
&gt;why should everyone be able to plex and not pay for Subscriptions?
---
precedent
---
You understand that CCP makes *more* money off of people plexing than they do selling subscriptions?
---
you can skill farm and it's only like 200m a month or smthing it's better than it's always been, outside of the massive loss in playerbase
---
&gt;On one account you can make around 500m with max 10 minutes of work every week from pi
---
this is false
---
How does that even make sense
---
It should be as high as it should be. Higher the better for the people, like me, who are buying and selling plex. I'm not worried about anyone's personal financial issues, those are your problem :)
---
fewer people willing to purchase plex = bad
---
That can extend to 'don't fly anything' imo.
---
Good..... goood.......
---
And they can, for a to be honest very small fee of $15 US per month. The game is a lot less stressful tbh when you don't have to worry about paying your sub.
---
I’m excited for it! Especially if the community is less toxic than this fucking subreddit. Some of us can’t devote 40 hours a week to playing a game at a desk and are excited about a more casual take on EVE for mobile. 
---
Agreed. Time and effort used to be meaningful. Now it's irrelevant. Skill injectors need to go. If anything we should be able to take/add skills only on our account. 
---
I dare you to fly munins in USTZ /u/CSMprogodlegend
---
damn, you are right i had that backwards.   I wonder if the slope went  back past a year?
---
A 12-month subscription is $131.40 USD. 6000 PLEX is $239.88.
---
CCP makes more money off of people plexing than buying subs.
---
Because plex price irl is higher than sub. 
---
Errrbody flying Munnins and we here pew pewing in Moas LOL
---
yes? That has nothing to do with my point.

Robotics... 3 pi setups... it can be done. Rocket fuel too would be close.

Right, but the way I understand it, a majority of the Chinese population is divided between GOTG, PLA (in goons) and Frat. I don't know the full story behind it, but apparently PLA and Frat hate each other, and the Chinese players in GOTG are so far away that there's virtually no chance that either one helps frat. Also, GOTG is not led by Chinese players, so if the Chinese players within GOTG joined frat because of nationalist rhetoric, they would have to break up GOTG to do that, which is unlikely at best. It's not that the Chinese players are completely united, it's that all of the Chinese players who are willing and able to unite with frat have already done so. So the easiest way to counter nationalistic recruitment by your enemies (nationalistic recruitment of your own) will not help frat very much at all.
---
when plex get more expensive, more people will buy it because you get more isk from it.
---
More people willing to purchase plex = good 
---
It was a balance patch to counter goon claw fleets.
---
its not, we just have a bunch of retards that started in 2019 and doesn't know how economics work
---
yes, paying for sub instead of chasing plex is good. 
---
You're implying that people plexing are playing for free; they aren't.
---
lol, it has never been easier to plex. 
---
It's all about winning a war, not a single battle. Misteakes were made and we will not repeat them
---
Pilot License EXtension. 
---
Perfect score.
---
&gt; If you can't see that this is effectively "Less people are buying PLEX meaning you have to pay more to get it" - I don't know what the fuck I can tell you?
---
the supply-demand curve has two inputs, learn 2 economics
---
volume this saturday was 1.86 million, volume on a saturday 1 year ago was 2 million. doesn't seem to be less supply.
---
But missles application bonus actually fills the role of the ship. A rlml cruiser is entirely different than a ham or hml cruiser. Your targets are different, your damage application is for different roles, everything is different. 
---
+ a ratting nyx on the haven while we were headed back
---
no I'm not. 
---
irrelevant 
---
i love this economic fallacy 
---
Its not going far enough, but a good thing nonetheless. My IMHO has always been that Rorquals should be pure support ships for exhumers. The nerf to excavator drones should have been more drastic to make Hulks etc more viable.
---
Very few people are talking about the more likely other side of this problem: Plex sales are probably down.
---
Considering the price keeps increasing as daily logins go downward combined with a lack of sales since summer I'd say that's the real issue.
---
fucking ridiculous where is the sale I cant afford to keep doing this and I cant use real life money like holy fuck
---
it's not 10 minutes of setup and management
---
Yes you will
---
Ha, meteored a Brave fleet that way some while ago, was fun.
---
Panda Meat is on the Menu bois. LETS GO!!!
---
AAR????
---
what do you do?
---
Still, if his max scan strength is 30%, he's doing something wrong.
---
 The price of a Plex increases due to the larger volume of bots that are banned. Today, 100 bots were banned, it does not matter, they entered the market and bought the whole Plex. Well, then you think about economic problems. 
---
:D :D :D
---
no, the whole point is that high plex prices are bad because the little guy can't plex. so its very relevant
---
Unlikely. The existing market plex value is far from $20 / 500 due to previous sales, different currency values and different prices in those said currencies. Given that the brunt of the player base is western I'd argue they get more realized value from subscription.
---
But injector farming has been isk negative for a while now.
---
Idiotic statement. 
---
I guess I didn't get selected to join... I never received this email.
---
Something something go krab something
---
Exactly right, if you factor in the sale taxes as well you lose quite a bit of value.
---
Fraternity fights without Elo handholding.  It goes as expected
---
thats another subject though, no one is arguing that a smaller supply is a sign of fewer people playing, OPs point is that people should be able to plex without any work 
---
you asked a question and i answered.
---
what should and shouldn't be is removed from what is.
---
i answered your question and you answered with something that doesn't counteract my response.
---
Dude. Get a life. You’re getting all worked up about some fictitious Internet game money. 
---
Plexing my ratting toons cost me 200mill now after extracting.
---
*Spends every ISK hoping ONE DAY walking in stations might come back to the drawing board...*
---
I'm addressing your point, not OP's point. stop conflating us as we're not the same person.
---
&gt;This is making the game we're all playing much more financially viable (in my view)
---
your view is incorrect, as the increase in PLEX prices is due directly to either the large number of people no longer purchasing plex with $$$, or a large number of people no longer purchasing subs with $$$ and instead relying on ISK.
---
Either way, people are investing fewer resources into eve online, which is bad.
---
Hey Panda, how about you post another kill from that fight today?
---
But eve is dying, supply is gone reeee
---
For 3 years I argued that more PLEX'ed accounts are not necessarily good for the game, and that CCP shouldn't mindlessly cater to multiboxed PvE lifestyle and the SP pump in the game.
---
The reason was that a PLEX'ed account was not necessarily a direct profit for CCP's bottom line, but merely an upward pressure in PLEX prices. More PLEX'ed accounts and SP farmer accounts are only as good as players willing to buy the PLEX or extractor for $ from CCP. But if you mess with the health of this game, you diminish the amount of those organic players. The upward pressure on PLEX price has complex consequences. While it might push some players to buy plex for $ from CCP, it might also push some players to leave the game or play less as they can't afford PLEX'ing their accounts anymore. There should be an ideal price for PLEX price for maximum CCP's profits, but it's not the "highest price possible". 
---
Thus, yet another multiboxed Rorqual was not necessarily good for this game. I argued that ultra safe farming in umbrella regions do immense harms to this game, by inflating PLEX and decreasing mineral prices (thus causing capital proliferation). I argued that umbrella space shouldn't be this safe, farm shouldn't be this unchecked, umbrellas should have counters.
---
I got memefied, bashed, made fun of, trolled for all these opinions by Goons and other mega empire people. If Goons care to trace the history of why they hate me, they'll find that the earliest examples hostility and toxicity between us was due to me expressing these opinions. PL and North weren't dead back then, and Goons took all these opinions as a "personal attack to collapse Goons".
---
Now you got a stale game, lots of demand on PLEX, yet not a lot of people willing to pay $ to CCP for it. You got 2b PLEX and it'll only soar from here onward.
---
Enjoy the fucking consequences.
---
Missions in hisec lowsec or npc null, explo in wormholes, ninja gas huffing in high class holes, sleeper ratting, escalations in high or low with either gila or t3d, pi, market crap, fw (missions or pvp)
---
The amount of plex being traded is not really that much lower than a few years ago, especially when you account for a smaller playerbase. 
---
And remember plex that are sold has been bought by someone else for real money.
---
Don't need to worry about consistency, when fleet stabber is actually the upgraded version of rupture and fleet scythe is the upgraded version of stabber.
---
Going to be a straight shot up with a few blips during sales. This is what uncontrolled inflation looks like - plex is the closest thing to a hard asset in this game and the price keeps ripping. 
---
Nobody did, the mails go out tomorrow.
---
Holy christ for someone who doesn't give 2 fucks you sure as shit wrote a diatribe about it.
---
Taking a loss to keep omega is worth it as those skillpoints will easily make you enough isk to cover the shortfall.. ok, reactions, industry slots etc. 
---
Bot glitched
---
Is it less people buying Plex, or more and more people that are willing to pay higher and higher amounts?
---
How many more rorqual and super ALTs are there in the game than this time last year that use Plex for their subscriptions?
---
It's not 17:30 UTC on the 19th yet is it?
---
Bruh same... the funny part is my pilot doesn't even wear them she's still rocking the full body armor suit from the original project discovery... smh
---
No more Misteakes.
---
Yes. But it has not raised in price this hard in the past. But I am not complaining. I'll work an hour a week more and just pay for my subs. 
---
At least you don't have to save them anymore. And update your flair bby.
---
&gt; Plex sales are probably down.
---
https://evemarketer.com/types/44992/history
---
Volume does not seem significantly down from "normal" times last year. Definitely down compared to the giant spikes from sales -- an event that seems unlikely to repeat now that CCP isn't trying to sell itself.
---
In 2018 people were making more isk than ever, but plex were held down by the sales. Now the lid has been taken off.
---
Alternatively, more people with rorqual and super alts willing to buy Plex = good?
---
You mean less people selling?
---
I am actually honestly shocked CCP has still never implemented some kind of Clone State between Alpha and Omega. Some kind of gamma clone that costs half as much as Omega, conferring you are benefits then Omega status, but still much better than Alpha status. They would make a lot of money, and it would actually probably see the price of Plex rise even more.
---
Ok a few days ago snuff even with a nyx an titan on the field still lost 5 revelations against a rev moros and a more or less capped out gallenete fax plus a vindi. And it seems the vindi and the fax got away from them. Look up galison and click on my bhaalgorn loss then related kills. We were fighting the plex me guys and had just lost our last bhaal sane snuff dropped shortly after.
---
Or 8 hours working a REAL Job can pay for like 6-12 months, depending on your wage.
---
A 10,000 player battle is such an interesting concept that I'd love to join just to see how it works, but I'm going to be about halfway through my shift at my dayjob when the test begins and ends. Won't have the chance. Why schedule it for a Wednesday? :(
---
Yeah I agree, I probably won't be able to do it either.  Right in the middle of the workday for North America.
---
I don't care about Aether wars simply because there is not enough info out there to GET me interested in it. Deep down I want it to work, but I simply have no interest because there is no hype, there is no info, CCP has given me simply no reason to be excited about it. Right now all it looks like is a slightly more fancy Sisi play test
---
Nyx was awoxed
---
Yeah, I'm switching over 3 or 4 of my accounts to extract every month instead of PLEXing them all. At some point there will be a positive feedback loop where more people keep trying to PLEX than there is PLEX available. 
---
I mean Frat recruited Origin and they have a great history of keeping Alliances together
---
It should have a low roi considering everyone is doing it with multiple accounts to the point that demand can’t keep mineral prices from constantly falling. 
---
It's just a way to screw the player base I to buying plex. Period.
---
Dunking the Nyx after the brawl, perfect end to the fight. 
---
oh trust me.  they will be repeated if there is many battles at all.  This is EvE afterall.  Mistakes the norm.
---
&gt;especially when you account for a smaller playerbase.
---
the whole point is that the plex price is following the trend of the massively lower playerbase in a compounding problem
---
good for CCP
---
So what, because I PLEX I don't have a life ? Because I PLEX I deserve to play 20B per month to play ? Keep your assumptions to yourself you moron. 
---
nyx was ratting 3 jumps from a 175 man muninn fleet
---
64 bit is happen so who knows, walking in stations might come back
---
In due time don't worry.
---
Always more fun to dance with the other girls before going for the 10/10
---
I mean if they want 10k to show up they really should offer something. Maybe 100 plex to help with the skyrocketing price of omega, for example.
---
Yes that is true but he cloaked up, got decloaked by awoxer and TEST then set up cyno inhib...is the story of the nyx pilot
---
Thank you. Finally someone who realises the massive amount of rorqual and super alts might have something to do with increasing prices.
---
Blockade Runners and DST's have problems running gate camps along established trade routes. You can move them occasionally with knowledge and scouts but it would be a challenge to feed a 15-20 man group with them.
---
Yachts can't even hold a frigate hull.
---
Rorquals are high sp/high initial cost.
---
The more I think about it though its probably just be the perceived difficulty of carving out an independent home in null than limitations in game mechanics.
---
Thanks for that.
---
Sleeper ratting seems like something that might make some ISKies.
---
For the record I would 100% do this but is a pretty terrible time of day for east coast us. 
---
Regardless of the downvotes, he's not wrong.  Any serious rorq-er will just add 1 rorq per 5 and have the same yield as today.  It changes nothing for the problem people, while hurting the people who only run 1 or 2.
---
the screenshot is from their discord server
---
Closer to 10 I think
---
Or maybe you can provide valuable input on something that potentially could be the future of big ass battles in games.  The idea behind the test is enough for me
---
&gt; This is making the game we're all playing much more financially viable (in my view)
---
No, you're wrong. Higher PLEX prices are bad for both ends of the scale.
---
For free players, it is obviously bad - it means more ISK generation needed per month in order to exchange for a sub. For every increment in PLEX prices, some free players will decide it's not worth it and quit or go alpha.
---
And although it's good for the players buying PLEX for ISK, it's still bad for CCP. Most people who buy ISK with real money are going to be buying a particular amount of ISK. If the PLEX price is higher, that means that they need to buy less PLEX to get the ISK they want, so they make CCP less money.
---
The only positive effect is if some free players - or PLEXed alt accounts - are pressured into buying a sub. But few will do that; if you're PLEXing an account it's probably because you don't want to spend £10/mo on it, and you won't start paying for it if it becomes harder to PLEX, you'll just drop the account.
---
I've seen other games where the in game currency exchange prices start to rise and put pressure on free players, and it isn't a healthy thing.
---
&gt; major blow to Init. if we had jumped in
---
IF you had jumped in, knowing that TEST would be defending the keepstar, then that would been your risk. A risk you take when working with Snuff that back stabbed your friends.
---
If you jumped in because you didn't know, then that's on you for jumping onto that grid while purposely ignoring Vily's very public statements on IMPERIAL media that TEST would be defending the keepstar. As well as ignoring legacy diplos. 
---
I think if you start putting things together such as Plex rampantly inflating at the same time that CCP are losing staff members,  you'll maybe ask questions about company/financial health.  
---
The point someone else makes that "Plex is sold by people who buy it for real money" is fine - but less people are buying it,  that's what's causing the escalation in prices.   
---
It's so basic economic theory that it astounds me people who play this game (which is effectively Spreadsheet MMO) don't get that point. 
---
Truthfully though if you look at historical trends Summertime is a down time for the number of players logging in because - Summer. People go outside and with the weather improving across North America I'm not suprised by your statement. The PLEX Sales though are being caused because there has been an abundant increase in liquid ISK becoming readily available to players through skill injecting and huge rorqual buffs from a couple of years ago. Everybody and their brother were creating multiple accounts and mining in Null. Including (dare I say it) Pandemic Legion - at the time the Leet PVP guys running around Null. They were known for not accepting people who wanted to mine.   
---
That being said do the math: 1 rorq = \~ With shit skills 100-150mil/hr after product is sold. Multiply that times 7 accounts running simultaneous = 1bil 50mil /hr. Suddenly you play the game for a few weekends and you've got billions. Couple that with skill injecting now you can suddenly create however many chars you want and plex all of them then use the skill farm to inject other characters for ratting, mining, PVP whatever. This was predicted when skill injectors were introduced and it is happening per the prediction.
---
Yep, I generally run 5 because its currently my sweet spot for effort at the profit ratio that I want.  With the change, I'm not at my wanted income level so I'll add another, and since I'm going over my sweet spot, I may as well just go full ree and add 5 more.  
---
CCPlease get rid of skill injectors. One can just farm them and never have to pay for their 10+ accounts.  Not a lot of new PLEX is being introduced into the game. 
---
&gt; Volume does not seem significantly down from "normal" times last year.
---
How does market volume correlate with actual fountains (people buying PLEX) and sinks (people using PLEX in the NES), though? The market volume also counts trading for trading's sake, and with PLEX being a high value item that can be offshore traded, there's quite a lot of that.
---
A bit of advice, train all four factions frigates skills up, small guns and drone skills as well. Frigates are loads of fun and they are cheap. 
---
Because it's frustrating watching CCP make retarded change after retarded change that doesn't actually solve the problem, when the fixes are so easy.
---
It's just a simple play test to see if they can handle 10,000 players at once.   That's it. 
---
thank you :)
---
25mbit on the phantasm ccplease 
---
Be nice 
---
Thanks for the replies!

After some more testing on Sisi I came to the following conclusions wrt e-warp (not sure if these mechanics are already well-known / documented and definitely not sure that these conclusions are correct either):
---
1) if you safe logoff in space, your ship will disappear and upon login you'll already be in warp, thus I think it's impossible to prevent this warp somehow (i.e. the 'exploits' won't work, even if you could scan down the spawn point, although since you are already in warp this seems impossble too),
---
2) if you logoff in space without any logoff timers, your ship will initiate warp, and if you successfully enter warp, I believe your ship disappears from space after it leaves grid or 1-2secs later, but it certainly doesn't warp to 1.000.000km off. Upon login your 1.000.000km spawn point is randomly selected, and again you are already in-warp as soon as you load grid. So, if I understand correctly, if you logoff without any timers, you're only vulnerable during entering your log-off warp (i.e. people cannot scan + camp your logoff point),
---
3) if you logoff in space with logoff timers, your ship will warp to a random point 1.000.000km off. When the timer expires, it will disappear from sapce (simlarly to safe-logging). If you login before the timer expires, you'll be at that random point, and you'll be vulnerable to warp disruption (speed will be at 0 when entering warp etc). If you login after the timer has expired, it works similar to the previous cases, i.e. you'll spawn in a another random point, already in-warp.
---
I think these mechanics were different at the time of the SC titan kill, which allowed them to pull it off.  
---
What? The nation wars in eve are one of the major things that make it so interesting.
---
Not necessarily.  With CCP's glacial pace, anyone who mines much at all could easily pay them off before more changes come.
---
Yeah but if you warped to an insta-dock bookmark no-one's going to be able to bump you out of the docking ring in 5 seconds.
---
I would hire you if I worked in HR.
---
Yeah really, I'd usually pick a regular caracal over a navy one if I felt like I really wanted to fly a caracal.  The performance just isn't good enough to justify the extra cost, and there are a half dozen other ships I'd rather fly for the price of a navy caracal at the moment, and probably even with the drone bay increase. 
---

That name is like... a c-list 90s rpg quality name. Jesus.
---
It's fine if you're in high sec, you are genuinely afk and you don't care whether you end up at your destination with a ship or not. Shuttling a character around when you don't have a jump clone there, for example.
---
But yeah there's always a chance you'll be ganked, particularly if you're going through a hub or pipe system.
---
Fyi the pacifier has 2nd best base agility in class beaten by a huge margin by the astero, and followed closely by the cheetah
---
Buff covops frigates plz
---
Yes. You drop your BMs at ticks and every ship doing the same warp (not only warp speed, but warp acceleration etc as well) will be in the same place at the same tick.
---
This is how in-warp smartbombing works.
---
and what do you think Reddit it for ;P
---
You must be a bitter ex- trio or co2 member lol..
---
Hm, sometimes I've ended up decloaked for no discernible reason, maybe someone is doing this to me. Although I've never seen anything flash on overview on those occasions.
---
l got mine 3hrs ago
---
Even if that were the case, (which i question), why didn't he pop his cyno before the inhib went active? There is a 1 minute activation delay, and he was in a super. Pop cyno and then kill it. 
---
I thought BR without decent AAR are removed?
---
Basically, don't associate with anyone.  In a MMO.  Cuz one of them may be a cheater!   ::CCP Logic::
---
No I think he’s saying you can be bumped to lengthen align time when invulnerable
---
Yeah CCP should really just stop banning bots :D :D :D
---
I mean put one instalock recon in belt and you'll need 3 bombers to kill a retreiver.
---
Change the recon to a t3d with a defender missile and you need 4 bombers.
---
At that point, you can just spread out your barges and do jetcan mtu/tractor beam mining and be safe from bombs.
---
Rip Aussies.
---
Thiiis! And more of everything else ;)

Depends on the station model and you underestimate my bumping mach

Yeah sounds like there might be a serious problem here.

If you injector farm on rorqual/super/vni alts, it takes almost no time to plex an account.

So do you have evidence less people are buying it? Looks from the market data like it's been fairly steady volumes sold over the last year at least?

5-10 mins a day. Small price for the rewards.

Yeah sure. But the other covops cost a fraction of the Pacifier and all covops are crap anyways in context of Asteros.
---
why do goons keep making accounts like these to larp as their enemies
---
I think you mean "banning first and preventing the asking of questions after\*"
---
Some valuable items are hard to move quickly, and some people are lazy.
---
we did not invite Snuff, gf and o7
---
Alternatively you could get rid of skill extractors and have npcs sell injectors. Then you would have a new isk sink AND players wouldn’t be able use skill farming to pay for accounts.
---
Real Irony is the guy isn't goons its just some guy in my corp trying to be funny and failing.
---
Because what's else there is to do between 2 MER reports
---
What exactly is the bigger picture here? Let's be honest, these accounts are farming for real life profits. You have to be blind to think all the isk flow in these major alliances is not going to some form of third party retail site asking for your real cash for in-game items. Maybe not anyone on the high council, but I bet hundreds of players are doing this.  Why play to Plex your account when you can basically play to pay your apartment rent. 
---
Holy Fuck you're retarded

Ookay, why? Just because 'grrr goons' or do you want Delve?

Bold of you to imply that I need pornhub when there are perfectly good spod rocks to fantasize about.

They just need to make the skill extractor cost ISK and not plex

Shit, imagine if Grath met diamond rats

It's pretty good if you want to clear a killright on you using nothing but a Tayra and some spare time.
---
It worked for the Zealot so will certainly work for the CNI right? Oh wait... 
---
I just can’t even understand what is the thought process of ccp sometimes. I guess balance is decided late in the night at the local pub and there is that weird and annoying dev that keeps coming back to how awesome drone bays are on ships in eve every time he drinks a bit to much and once in a while people just can’t bear it anymore and give him some random ship to add a drone bay to to get his mouth shut.
---
WWB happen because everyone in eve hated them, since then it looks like it change since no one ever attempt to take them out of Delve, I guess Goons are now like and no one want to mass together to "kill" them again.. or maybe WWB was not about hate ? [huuuuuuum](https://www.eveonline.com/article/end-user-license-agreement-changes-coming-with-eve-online-ascension)
---
I would say being primarily composed of Frat alts did more to push them.
---
Plex buyer here. Won't complain about the increased price, but to be honest I don't really feel like this is any huge amount of money or great advantage for people who buy plex.
---
One decently fit HAC is still worth \~150 plex. When you play the game this way, you start looking at ships in a different way.
---
"This ship costs me 5 dollars"
---
Even though plex is inflated, the entire economy feels inflated to go with it. 2 bill buys fuck all, and costs as much as a nice lunch + tip.
---
I haven't bought more plex in a year because of a general feeling of dread about where this game is headed. The recent balance announcement is a step in the right direction.
---
A couple more of those in a row and I'll break the wallet out.
---
Plex price is just the price of continuing training on an omega account. It costs like 100m a month to keep it omega if you skillfarm it. 
---
So, skillfarm your alts, and $sub your main. Or skillfarm your main. Or stop vni ratting and git gud at iskmaking.

You'll be in a Tidi battle, just entered warp and nothing is going to happen for the next 10 minutes so you hit your walk in spaceship button and enjoy the scenery while playing interactive monopoly in your spaceship.
---
Req is taking a lot of corps atm... Hey FRAT easy way to get some FC level spais into legacy? 
---
WTB Retiree status where clones no longer train but you can use all the skills
---
It's a start. In my opinion the real problem is not the rorqual itself (yea, it's too tanky and PANIC shouldn't be a thing) but rather the amount of shit you can mined in such a small space. With the current anomalie spawn rate every nerf to the rorqual itself will just be countered by bringing more of them or by bringing rorquals+ a shitload of barges. Rorquals or miners in general should have to spread out a lot more to the point where they can't all sit unter a single super umbrella.
---
Nobody's explained to me *why* I want to walk in a station.
---
I would pay so much money for minmatar ducttape, plaster and staples skins!
---
the reason people have given up trying  to kill the rorqual is because the panic module means they will almost every single time live long enough for a sueprcap fleet to land on top of them to save them.
---
Not big surprise. Capitals Online is stale. Everyone can now fly everything instantly (skill injectors), multiple times (multiboxing). No more real fights for resources and territories. The alliance leaders all know eachother and rather make deals than have long, tedious wars. Official tournaments are cancelled. Content development by CCP is super slow, as usual. No more long term roadmap for the game. So what should players get excited and hyped, so that they invest (lots of) real money into the game again?
---
Yes - running a trend line indicates that daily volume of Plex has come down from 2.75M per day to around 2.1M per day from 1/01/2018 to 1/01/2019.
---
PGL went seal clubbing - won a battle - now smugposting. TAPI as usual.
---
Not to worry, next month mittens is going to break the imperium up into a couple pieces and have them fight with/against each other in a failing attempt to keep goons interested in eve.
---
THIS
---
Like that changes anything at all about API access :D 
---
Then give it another 3, and then 6... there will always be something to learn
---
I think it's because the presentation at GDC is on the same day and they want it to happen somewhat realtime? From their site: 
---
&gt; We're at GDC 19 Stand S366. Visit us to try our Aether Engine tech and chat to the engineering team behind it, to learn how we can work together to realise your creative vision.

---
It still does not solve the problem though as people will just buy more skill injectors with the alts that make tons of isk to buy more injectors still creating a plethora of liquid isk. which still in turn drives up plex prices because nobody has to pay for game time!!! \\o/
---
A billion an hour sounds like complete BS to me.  
---
if ur not busy while mining you don't have enough mining alts
---
So, basically siphon drones to make mining even less engaging, rather than more? 
---
They are attack cruisers, evolved from their non-navy versions, they go fast and dictate range, I understand why would you compare it with the Scythe but it is also a ship that needs powergrid for guns, which creates a wild variety of fittings, CNI lacks that privilege.  No where in your post said this was a discussion about ships except your handpicked choice of ships, I assume you spoke of roles as in 'Attack ship' role the caracal is clearly labelled as.   Also be more respectful when choosing to downvote somebody, people enter your thread and give their insights and possibly a combination of friends or alt accounts helping you in downvoting any opposing points.
---
He tried eagles last night 
---
64bit and a completely different game and rendering engine stitched in are not even close to the same discussion. 
---
People would most certainly lose more ships this way.   
---
I see no downside here. 
---
Chiming in about how much fun ENE is every year! I'm working on some awesome stuff for poker, so be ready for that!
---
Because youre not carrying anything of value
---
Please tell him to stop trying.
---
After getting evicted from drones by XIX. It’s been a long road to ruin.
---
Get those yeezys
---
someone make this man a ccp ship balance dev, as he displayed more knowledge about any sort of balance, than ccp has showed us the past 5yeaqs
---
yea, but if none reports you, you will get away with it for years because the devs don't care
---
Goons are just going to expand QFC to whole new eden
---
tanked AB buzzard and an osprey navy 
---
&gt; TEST didn't bat phone goons until after horde called in NC. and PL.
---
its almost like they're the same coalition ehhhh
---
I'm imaging the screams coming from GSOL having to move the many thousand structures around Delve.
---
WWB happened because everyone in Eve hated goons. 
---
Since then pretty much everyone in Eve has joined goons.
---
Now what?
---
\&gt;  but you really aren't risking much 
---
Apart from the 5 billion of drones out in space that dawdle back to their bay like overweight sausage dogs running for another biscuit.
---
Man/Woman you love this fucking thread.  Are you Brisc's non vaccinated son?
---
Thanks cheakin it out rn!
---
Added to that your ships if you are a PvPer, which usually are not cheap.
---
+1
---
Would be great to use the CNI because it's good instead of just for the memes.
---

and not everyone should be able to play for free.
---
​
---
On one account you can make around 500m with max 10 minutes of work every week from pi
---
Edit: And those are low numbers btw 1b per month from PI isn't hard if you actually want to do it, and incursions can be closer to 150m than 100m per hour, not counting LP
---
**nO i aM NoT**
---
It's very hard for CCP to measure mining losses because most of the ore is lost because the miner in question does not undock.  And he will not undock if there's a good chance he's going to get his stuff blown up.
---
Of course less ore mined equals higher mineral prices, which means more expensive items, which bites everybody in the arse by... oh I don't know, say 20%.
---
Eve is the game about freedom, and you have the freedom to wear tiny high heels that only cover the toes. 
---
Our recruitment site is down at the moment, went down earlier today.  Our all volunteer IT team is working on it.
---
Sounds good. Focusing on core skills is a great place to go once you've found something to do with your current skills. The recommendation for T2 guns is mostly because of T2 ammo, and it isn't necessary, ore even relevant for many FW frig fits. Honestly, the experience you get from getting fights will help you much more then actual SP will. Have you considered recording your fights? Often times looking back at a fight you can often find mistakes you would never notice in the moment. It can be a great way of learning the basics and will let you get more out of every fight.
---
Spot on.  It's why I mine ice in an Endurance.  I can GTFO in under 3 seconds.
---
When you have 6 Rorquals and a Super umbrella maybe, yeah. 
---
The fuck is world war bee? Do you mean the casino wars? 
---
I'm actually his lover
---
And i will always love these crybabies
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; You'll be in a Tidi battle, just entered warp and nothing is going to happen for the next 10 minutes so you hit your walk in spaceship button and enjoy the scenery while playing interactive monopoly in your spaceship.
---
Ah yes, the star citizen approach. Very fun and engaging.
---
i should buy some plex...
---
3 chars, one account. skill extract them, loose about 200m 
---
Incursion for a few hours
---
Plex
---
Repeat
---
lol posted with mobile somehow the / between== wasnt included... bruh got so much hate 
---
Now we hate ourselves...
---
We shall self destruct all our ships and win WWB2
---
correct
---
it's an issue not because of any game mechanic or inability to enforce, but because the devs are retarded
---
It is! But its true
---
That’s a completely acceptable price. I work too hard to work in a video game. 
---
I liked you better when your posts were about that gate to... which region was it? Feythabolis?
---
as if everyone have a panic mode fitted
---

---
The numbers are pretty stable, and most of the change can likely be contributed to a lower overall playerbase over the period. 
---
That’s correct. 
---
Nope, he definitely pulled range from me, I was trying to hold at 2000m and he keep pulling away to 10 000m
---
&gt;"... the irresponsible group behind this so-called 'news service' \[ARC Studio\]"
---
OMG DED
---
The NC. capitals being smashed by nado's and Nightmares was fun. They had to drop supers to deal with battleships. :D
---
Reeeeee!!!!!
---
shut the fuck up retard
---
Correlation immah not a cuzzation!!!!
---
Only a dribbling retard wouldn't.
---
See you're getting the hang of it already.
---
I thought they got rid of Casinos so no need for another Casino War?
---
Would actually really enjoy that tbh.
---
?
---
Oh hey, it's 1994
---
Uhhh calm down there bud
---
The best moment while FC'ing, like you had a quick thinking or a bold move that either won or lost the battle of said roam.
---
Heart-breaker &lt;3 
---
I will look into that. The main thing I've noticed with the Tormentor is I can't maintain the orbit I want. I'm having problems starting in range of my dps and warp disruptor. I guess speed is the limitor there? The faster ship gets the better orbit?
