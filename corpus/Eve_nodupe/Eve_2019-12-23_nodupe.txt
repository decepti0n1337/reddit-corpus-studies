Unless you screwed a bunch of people over with the character, there's absolutely no reason to start a new one. You are infinitely better off keeping the one you have, with a bunch of skills already trained.

I hope so too, and less deaths, im starting to eat up fits ;3;
---
Grab some frigates and go shoot people!
---
Remove the exhumer skills from the queue.
---
Seriously, ew.
---
1: Cut those exhumer skills out. Seriously, exhumers are worse than useless and you will never pay off the cost before they are blown up, unless you're risk averse to the max which just means you will lose out on ore you could have otherwise mined. Take it from a guy who used to mine literally exclusively: Exhumers are useless and the Orca is only good in highsec or as a hauler.
---
2: Train the [Magic 14](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/The_Magic_14). These skills will help literally every single ship you ever fly. Prioritise the fitting skills first, CPU and Powergrid Management etc. Then capacitor skills, then everything else. Also get Gunnery V, Missile Launcher Operation V, and Drones V.
---
3: Train Frigates V, Destroyers V, and Cruisers V for each of the races. I'd prioritise Minmatar Destroyer V because of the Sabre and Caldari Cruiser V because of the Tengu, but it's dealer's choice. Then get the skills to fly each of the T2 ships (eg. Heavy Assault Cruisers, Interceptors, etc.) to at least IV. These ships will make up the bulk of what you fly in EVE, they're easily the most versatile and easiest to lose classes of ship in the game, and they're definitely the most fun to fly. Battlecruisers make up the backbone of a lot of null fleets, but they can be flown pretty well with BC IV. Battleships sadly aren't used much, and their T2 variants are either highly specialised (Blops) or next to useless outside of highsec because of the cost (Marauders). Capital ships seem really fun but they should be trained on an alt.
---
4: Train each of the weapon skills for Small and Medium weapons to V, and their relevant specialisation skills to at least IV. Small and Medium Hybrid, Small and Medium Projectile, Small and Medium Energy, Light Missiles, Heavy Missiles, all get T2. T2 guns are a must-have, they're basically standard. 
---
This should be about your first year of training, and at the end you will get all the basics you need out of the way for future endeavours. After all this I recommend training for T2 drones and getting your weapon support skills (Surgical Strike, Missile Bombardment, etc.) and targeting skills out of the way.
---
Also, if at all possible get some alts. At the very least invest in Multiple Pilot Training Certificates, they're about 1Bn ISK each and let you train a second character on the same account at the same time for a month. It's cheaper than PLEXing a second account, though I still recommend you do that. Even if you can't afford to Omega additional accounts, still keep some as Alpha and train what you can. You want a mining/industrial alt and a capital alt. **These are not mandatory**, and you can train these skills on your main if you want but they are definitely recommended. The sooner you make alts the better. Make sure to take advantage of your Recruit-A-Friend rewards as well. Capital skills take so long to train and have so little cross-train with subcaps that it's best to dedicate an alt to it, and a mining alt is good for sticking in a belt while your main PvPs, if nothing else.
---
Don't get caught up in the trap of mining, it's not going to make you anywhere near as much ISK as anything else unless you run half a dozen accounts at the same time. The main advantage of mining is that it's easily scalable, not that it makes tonnes of ISK. Look into [WarpToMe Incursions](https://wl.warptome.net/fits/) and get yourself a minimum-spec Rokh. It's \~150Mn, which is a lot for a new guy, but you'll never lose that ship unless you make a mistake (and if you do get ganked they'll SRP it ^(so long as you pay like 10Mn into their insurance programme, which is a bargain)) and you'll make up the cost in a little over an hour. Incursions are the best safe ISK for a new guy, you'll literally never make better ISK until you start doing high-end null or wormhole krabbing.
---
Thanks for joining this game, and fly safe!
---
Did you run out of omega time?
---
Nope. Still, I’ve tried leaving in just my capsule multiple times.
---
r/unexpectedancestor
---
In high sec you're right (I think) but in nullsec it's one of the best. I'm not really sure how you guys make money there? I went right to nullsec day 1. 
---
I do a lot of PI and Rorq minning. Before I got a rorq I would rat, salvage, and mine moons and ice.
---
This is the best way to slowly and steadily build your empire. 
---
Not taking advantage of the full passive revenue potential of an omega account is, in my opinion, one of the biggest oversights people can make.
---
I got one plex drop and have gotten the marshal blueprint...
---
I misunderstand.
---
agreed
---
so your entire argument is gone then?
---
Imagine being wrong on this assumption and looking pathetic for stating what isn’t true. We had a back up FC. Regardless, it is still low form to headshot an FC. If PanFam continue this practice then I’m sure the other side will just start reciprocating.
---
I think overall this would be bad for the game.

Was done in retaliation for you guys doing this first.
---
Not really, all it means is hull prices and module price increases for consumers. Since we supply a big chunk of the trade in Jita, I'm sure a price hike is exactly what you need to show you this isn't good for the game.
---
Some regions really are just awful
---
Alphas can barely do PI, and they cant use cloaks or advanced haulers, so the alt wouldn't be too useful in this case/
---
your original comment
---
&gt; No, we left because TEST decided to headshot our FC and we were being enclosed by four other fleets at that point in time.
---
but now you claim you left not because of any of that but because the the others left and the fight was over, and that all happened in the span on two warps since while on grid you were still being "enclosed by four fleets"
---
honestly this is just embarassing, ill stop indulging your damage control, cya

If you read other statements in this post it confirms what I said. Why would we need damage control? We had already kicked in Pandemic Hordes fleet and did our bit during the battle.
---
I dunno about blobbing. It was the way it was. They went in with smartbombs and had problems cycling them in the tidi. Tactic didn't work, they got outgunned after that and volleyed off the field. Can't blame them for at least giving something new a go.
---
Is there any way I can put game windows on my other screen? Like the D-Scan/Probe window?

Last I looked, Initiative were obviously part of the Imperium. Also, no, initiative decided it would be fun and in taking the lead, we decided it would be fun to follow, to even the odds after PGL said they're attacking Sort Dragon over something out of game shit show reason that not even I understand why you can't understand that real life and game life are different.

35 BILLION Isk??? Jesus fuck. You can basically buy damn near anything in the game now

Otto is correct, and also with noting the only things you can do from an app are send eve-mail and change your skill queue. The skill queue only adjustable in the official Portal app.

Nah, it's white and gold! Considering it's Amarri, it's technically true...

---
They've been talking about removing POS towers for years, and replacing POS BP's to standup for ages
---
&gt;Across what timeframe? If you say 6bn/hr I'm calling bullshit; I'd believe 6m/hr personally.
---
Across the same timeframe as mining. And it's closer to 125Mn/hr.
---
&gt;Which, to be honest, would probably be an hour at best. At least with mining I can be doing other things and listening to music/youtube and paying half-attention to the screen while doing active combat (Even if it's just PVE) requires 100% full attention at all times.
---
Sure. Same is true of basically any ISK-making method. I'm talking about what I consider the best way for new pilots to make as much ISK as possible in the least time possible, to make it easier to lose ships and learn PvP.
---
they still get the kill even if you eject
---
Do you enjoy the relaxation of mining, or the relaxation of watching netflix?
---
Abandon mining as a serious profession. This is the best advice I can give you.
---
Go to Jita 4-4 or Amarr Emperor Family Academy, look for "trade hub" in the "Type" column. These are the best places to find all sorts of goods.
---
If you want invest in plex. Wait to end or near end of current sale. So buy price will be at bottom.
---
But I do not recommend doing this. To make profit on plex you probable will be waiting months or years for market to switch. Just to make more isk than you will lose on taxes and you probable don't have enough market knowledge yet to plan everything. First advice about simply storing that isk somewhere else, so you don't spend it on dumb things is much better for new player. When you will have more knowledge, then you can simply grab that isk and invest on market.
---
And most important. By that time you will understand value of it.
---
Mining; Sometimes I'll just watch the rocks.
---
Considering that most nights I just stare at a blank wall in complete darkness, it's something to do.
---
Yeah, guy that just finished first tutorial mission definitely need to super...
---
Hasn’t played in 2 years and cynos. I can just guess about what is going to happen cough *recons* cough
---

---
another troll at it again. Clearly you have no interest in actual meaningful engagement beyond trolling so GTFO.
---
I suppose, teaching the new players to be good little line members instead of being mining drones.  And 125mn/hr is still kind of outlandish for subcaps in my opinion; I used to do Drone Hordes for 30-35m/tick.
---
You too
---
Smart move. 1 Bil is still too much for a newbie but at least you'll have fun spending it. Always remember that price scales exponentially with performance/attributes and buying the most expensive ship/equipment will not make you invincible. It will only make you a bigger target.
---
Also, stay away from skill injectors, they can get very addictive.
---
EVE doesn't have any real players anymore. It's all AI with dumb bots to draw away the potential attention.
---
Graphics are a little wonky at times, so at first I was kinda discouraged to watch it. Finally did so a couple years ago, and I was absolutely amazed about how good a job the makers did: the story is very good, the characters convincing and the voice acting on point, plus it really has the Eve kick going. I loved the whole series and routinely recommend it to my peeps who haven't seen this yet.
---
Oh and among many others, the "IT'S HOT DROP O CLOCK" line has me fucking crying every time.
---
What roots can you only learn specifically from anchor f1?
---
I take offence to this. :O
---
&gt;Very few players got 35B ISK (less then 0.1% of the playerbase)
---
This seems unlikely
---
Daamn congrats!
---
&gt;  have no idea if this is even a lot
---
lol, 35bil ISK is roughly equivalent to $350
---
Yes, it's a shame that this one stucks with little more than 3000 views after more than a year on youtube. It's very good and surely a lot of work went into this.
---
Sad it is and a true Story 😶
---
Seems like you have already followed the good advice to put the money aside.
---
But totally, use that to play the game for free and save yourself some IRL cash.
---
Another good use of some would be buying a **small** number of skill injectors (it's easy to get carried away...).  
---
These become less useful the more total SP your character has. You could buy 4 or so of these and inject them (you dont necessarily need to immediately use the SP on skills, they can sit there in 'unallocated SP').  
---
There are quite a few skills in the game that don't feel very rewarding for the amount of time spent training them (capacitor, power grid and CPU fitting skills for instance - google "Eve online magic 14" which are 14 skills that apply to almost all ships).Then you don't have to wait when you'd much rather be getting closer to flying another type of cruiser or using another weapon type for instance. If I were you I'd inject these skills up to level 4 or 5 so you're always training something more gratifying that actually lets you do something new when its finished.
---
It's just because you stated it like it was fact. Lots of people have fun solo, just in the minority.
---
Having said that - even solo players should be in a corp.
---
I've reported all that I know of. How many has RR kicked for botting?
---
&gt;Events that player had to undock, warp somewhere do some sites - and while it was far from perfect, people moved around the space to complete the sites.
---
The possibility was raised here before. People complained because they would have to put in effort and because they wouldn't be able to complete them on all their alts. Now we don't.

Why is it that players who have never been deep into null sec are commenting on this thread. Go to your map click on "Players in the region in the last 30 mins" go to the systems with no fucking players in them. Rat, sell, repeat. 
---
I'm not going to be doing this is in null sec systems with any other players than me in them. The simple fact that you think I'm going to is slightly bemusing and insulting. I have made over 10 bil isk in the last week from exploring (so all you guys saying I plex can fuck off) and I simply want a way to get a fuck load of dps deep into null sec to my t2 exploration frigate. Hence using a BLOPS ship to bridge
---
Thanks man a decent reply for once. You got a cool fit in mind?
---
Talk to me when you actually know how to avoid players in null sec
---
I'd say it's way too soon to say how it will affect as massive stockpiles of "old" ore still exist.

Mobile depo and refit once you found a good system. Tengu fairly good for doing this.

I would recommend that as well. For the simple reason that it will skip you some time training.

Evepraisal shows the CCP price iirc. It's between 55-70b for titans.
---
Ok,....
---
That is A LOT of isk, even for seasoned players.
---
You can get a supercarrier, or in some cases even a titan for that much.
---
Make a second character on your account and give that one 33bil.
---
Then learn the game mechanics, and in 2-3 months, when the game still exited you, and you have a somewhat steady source of income, you might use some of those funds to plex your account. (Buying 500plex in Jita, using that to buy omega status in the new Eden store, at the moment that's around 1.8bil per month per account)
---
clubbing requires an action more than pressing a single button
---
If you want to mine in High Sec, get away from the starter systems and away from the market hubs.  There's plenty of systems in HS that are off the beaten path with plenty of ore.  When you have a bunch of people all mining in the same system, the ore disappears.
---
Yea the 0.1% counts everyones 20 alts with no isk on each. Only a couple of my characters have any real isk on them.

wow you just hit the jackpot. That would normally take years of consistent play for a new player to farm that much ISK.

I never understood why people disliked the Grand Prix so much. It was very accessible for new players and they actually learnt how to avoid gate camps. If veterans didn't deemed it worth their time they didn't had to do it or could camp the pipes. vOv

It was probably that there were too many rewards which devalued the rewards. They mentioned that they gave a lot of rewards in that event to make people extra happy (was on some CCP stream). Completely ignoring that the reward value goes to the dumpster if there are too many on the market.

I don't actually mind a giveaway event for Christmas. We've always had those, I think. But the 'chilling spree' is a meaningless daily quest reward, and the giveaway is much less enjoyable because they've been doing them so often.
---
I totally agree with you. Events should be rare, and they should get people out in space actually running sites. Login events don't even require you to enter the game, and the 'shoot 1 NPC' events don't make you do anything meaningful or generate content. They also advantage people with many accounts which shouldn't be the case (skill farmers don't need giveaways).
---
Event sites should (i) be primarily in lowsec and (ii) be run in deadspace sites. The original Agency booster dropping event sites were great, although they were in all space which was a mistake I think.
---
Sitting on the undock of Jita 4-4 isn't really entering the game in any meaningful sense.

Yeah, that was a good change-up for an event too.

Nope. Actually, when I get the "shoot an NPC" I just warp to a gate and toss snow balls at the faction police.

Obviously there is a reason, otherwise we would have wiped their entire fleet.  As for trading most of us got out (the Goon Eagle fleet).  We disengaged because allies got wrecked.

At this time of year there is a high number of credit card fraud alerts and MMOs like EVE and WOW are a way for credit card thieves to launder the money. They start a new account, use a stolen credit card to buy a bunch of in-game currency then sell the in-game currency for cash and leave the MMO holding the bag. A new account with a large dollar purchase like what you described could have set off some bells for them. Keep in mind its Christmas so support is probably going to be slow getting back to you as they are probably short-staffed this week and next.

You can have the wormhole and blue loot, or you can crab in the nullblock.

Why? They can't come kick in your door in the middle of the night and black bag you or your family. They can ban you from their service. That's it. You'd likely be better off, like a drunk getting cut off.

Be prepared to wait months. My account was banned and it took them 3 months to respond back to me and unlock it.

IDK how it's different from the other RMT scenarios but then again, not very experienced in all this.
