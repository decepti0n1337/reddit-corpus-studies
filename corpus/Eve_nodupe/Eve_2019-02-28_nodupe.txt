That's fine, though is it really bad that it's more important than just being a QoL/flavor item?
---
Olmeca, I love ya man and I think what you did with booshing was seriously awesome, but this time man, it's kinda sad. Wow, people have spoken your name in a couple of the many jabber channels that thousands of goons have access to. Who cares? Wow, people play meta games with opinions and communities. Have you watched any news wherever you live? Have you looked at any politics of any country? I mean...come on.
---

---
Lets get serious...mentally harass people? They say this in private rooms. The fact that you got your little hands on the logs of the jabber room...wow who cares.
---
R/eve mods have a rather hands off protocol unless they are forced to intervene, such as when you say things like this to them.
---
R/eve is mainly anti goon....and goons love it. It's hilarious and a great way to use a community to jab at the different sides of itself. It's all in fun, and it makes the community fun. When things happen like a death in the community though, or fighting for this game, for instance...we as a community come together and are there for each other. Yes we may all be in different alliances on different sides, but when shit goes down, we are here for each other. That's how it should be, and how it is.  
---
    Anything else is your insane obsessiveness towards delve and goons, like how you think anyone cares what you are doing. You aren't causing a tax. Marshy does way more than you every did, and he doesnt even do much. As far as most everyone in delve is concerned,  you and Marshy just get the bottom of the barrel fish that are probably afk and dont help themselves. Anyone with half a brain with a good fit and on comms can resist and call for help. We have all been there.  Marshy tried to drop on me a few days ago.  He was chased off and didnt get any kills of the several he dropped on.  Sometimes he gets the kill. Ya...whatever. this is eve.
---
   What in the world do you want?  Not allow people to speak your name?  You think and speak conspiracies a little too much.  Go ahead, have someone get logs for you on all the jabber rooms. Its just sad and a waste of time. Imagine wasting that time pouring through all the  jabber rooms and conspiring and taking things the way that a conspiracy nut would.
---
  I love you olmeca, I really do, but damn. Calm down on the conspiracies bud. 
---
Understood. You have a wonderful day.
---
Well, for me one hour irl is roughly 300 mil ISK, so....
---
Good bot.
---
No ability to restart if both fleets can't kill eachother?
---
It's sitting at 175+ upvotes, even though it was unlisted. I don't think you know how to judge the value of things.
---
That fact that it usually isn't, when compared many other online translators. 
---
Thank goodness you are here to wake these sheeple up!
---
And I now nominate you for the most vague answer award!. I mean like how do you find them and such, what type of ship would you recomend and the like
---
Which is why FCs call for you to lock up 4 or so targets (probably more in alliances where people have higher skills on average). If everyone who is yellowboxed runs they won’t have anyone left

What about F1 jockey autism level? Can we get a slider for that? Say from 1 to REEEEEEEEEEEEEE...

Let me provide a tl;dr:
---
https://imgflip.com/i/2utgvh
---
The changes are fantastic, but years too late. War dec mechanic have killed new player retention. This is something that should have fixed at the latest before Ascension. How many genuine new players do you think are trying EvE these days? How many people do you think are coming back to the game? 
---
Personally I don't want them to change bounties on NPC's (as that is my main source of income), but maybe heavy matinence costs on large ships would work? Like you have to pay a premium to keep your titan running ETC
---
This, get rid of that default overview asap. Join in-game channels to get overview packs.
---
"Z-S Overview" is solid and I've heard good things about "SaraShawa-Overview" but never personally tried it.
---
you see you keep saying thing without looking for evidence, did you heard about the "culture revolution" Goons went trough some years ago ? And the first one happen not so long after the "Wizard hat" thing btw 
---
I guess it all comes down to personal preference. Is the practice of preordering good? As a theory it is however the way it is used nowadays it's complete garbage but people still do it, I'm against it because it lets developers get away with releasing unfinished garbage but fanboys have a different opinion. 
---
I don't like where the industry s going and the side CCP is taking but I can't do anything myself and since there are enough people happy with the way things are all I can do is voice my opinion here...
---
What did Ccp do?

You guys are honestly so shit at this with intermittent removals, might as well just scrap the fucking rule.

So why I feel like it sucks as a mechanic, is that it becomes a checklist item, so you have to set it to mode X in space Y, so it effectively becomes a noob trap because why did it I die well you didn't set it right or why didn't my guns work in lowsec because you didn't have you setting right.

You can also enjoy every minute of being on drugs and have nothing wrong with your life, so I don't really see how that applies.

shit i'd love to just join goons and get into all those dirty channels to leak all that info for everyone to see, but that's so much effort, and for what? just to say "i told you so"?
---
I have 2 citadels just for clones.
---
technically, the beginning of the end was the day the game launched.
---
I also hate "NO AT"... but Eve has not been primarily or even secondarily known for its tournaments. When I ask people "why do you play eve or why have you heard of it?" I never got the answer "because of tournaments". It's always about one of those: a) space/sci-fi b) complexity c) challenge d) single shard play e) maths and spreadsheets f) the news about large fleet battles - probably approximately in this order even. Tournaments never played a role for non-players going into the game. Only for the ones already playing the game.
---
This is some peak perfomance Grr Goons right here.

Yes.

&gt; A former colleague of mine likes to fish, he’s got a gazillion and a half lures.

Old fishermen say that lures aren't created by companies to catch fish as much as they're created by companies to catch fishermen.

You can make ratting tedious as fuck you just have to make the rewards worth it(3-5x the isk).
---
Unreliable news source
---
Over 5 years, I can honestly say I’ve dropped around ten grand on Eve. I wish it was only a hundred. 
---
Too bad dota never really took off in korea, that would be cool to see.
---
tbh though league is a better game for that style of max micro play(in terms of faster paced fights).
---
Grinding for isk and the feeling of reward from making a profit has lost all meaning to me. Given that I could just join Goons or some rental group in the drone lands and have money printed out for me by loaning my account to a bot farmer really killed off any sense of accomplishment. 
---
I pay for Plex because to me, working a few hours and spending that on a game so that I don't have to grind my one character out for a month makes what's left of the game much more tolerable. It means I can just get into PVP instead of having to grind knowing that I could be getting everything for free if I go and commit to ruining the game even more. 
---
At least by buying Plex to throw on the market, there's hopefully *someone* buying it who *isn't* botting that wouldn't be able to do what I do, and can actually enjoy their game without worrying about their IRL finances as a result. 
---
I sure hope there is. 
---
I do plan to add a button to pause then resume or reset.  
---
I'll bump it up the priority list since you're asking.  
---
For now I will note there's a two hour timeout.  
---
So if the fleets can't kill each other just set it to 1000x speed and wait a few seconds.  
---
It might take a bit longer if you have thousands of ships per side as it has to simulate two hours of them failing to do anything useful.
---
Mostly Because when you go on a roam nothing happens until you get dropped by supers

I dont have alot of time, just a few things.

Pvp fits dont have to be cap stable. Especially small stuff like frigs. Fights are usually over within 30secs...

i think it was possible to buy characters over the bazaar before skill trading was a thing.
---
OP I appreciate the amount of time you put into this but its a bad idea. 
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
In the post, you are addressing simply a symptom. Namely, there are lots of bots running combat sites, lots of people AFKing and its too easy for people to run it. While this is an important part, it is not a valid solution. 
---
By making it harder, you simply make people spend more time writing bots, and make it a more frustrating experience for actual players. The real, core problem, is the nature of combat anomalies themselves. You can stay in one system, run combat sites in one system, and simply never leave that system. Regardless of how difficult the sites are, you have an ISK faucet that is at your disposal 24/7. THAT is the real problem with combat sites.
---
Another idea is what if bounty payout per rat, site respawn and site spawn density decreased relative to the number of NPCs killed in the last week/month. It makes sense form a lore perspective; why would the Blood Raiders stay somewhere where they are constantly farmed? Why would CONCORD pay out bounties if all the blood raiders keep dying. It could also reward regions that see, right now, little activity. If bounties INCREASED in regions that have zero activity, you might see player density spread out and more interesting player interactions.
---
Regardless, making combat sites harder does nothing but force developers to write more complex bots, and give real players a less enjoyable experience.
---
fit 2 small shields 1) because I couldn't fit a medium (I'll play with the rigs a little to see if I can get a medium in there), and 2) sig tank? Or is that not really an issue for Merlins in blaster ranges?
---
God I'm so happy to see legit subcap fights with damn near even numbers...

Actually predatory baiting is more of his thing. That's how he got rid of his opposition by baiting the 2016 coup attempt.

Relic and data sites that don't have "forgotten", "perimeter", or "unsecured" in the name. These sites have strong NPC's that aren't worth the effort for you at this point.
---
When you find a wormhole, right-click and select "info." Look for ones that say they lead into "unknown parts of space." "Dangerous/deadly unknown" are higher-class wormholes that won't have data/relic sites that you can do.
---
Also, avoid data sites that are "covert." Those are \[Ghost Sites\]([https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Ghost\_Sites](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Ghost_Sites)).
---
It might take some time to find wormholes that haven't been farmed already. Lots of people live in them.
---
That is absolutely brilliant :-). I had not heard that before, but I can totally see it.
---
The guy’s obsession with lures was, to a complete outsider like myself, baffling. The colours, the shapes, the sizes, the materials, the properties. It wasn’t just ‘a thing’ you hooked a line to, it had a purpose a reason for everything. It was at once fascinating and bizarre to listen to someone speaking about lures with such passion and total dedication.
---
But companies creating lures to catch fisherman, that’s a completely new one :-). I can totally see why that would apply.
---
Holy Mother Poop is you dumb

Predatory baiting was what I was accusing you of.

Where did I predatory bait you? I have no power to ban you.

You know we already have Koreans who play the game, right? A fair few of them too

i mean he definitely has an alt/spy in goonswarm
---
You can buy core skills directly from your skill queue or the requirements tab after you show info on a ship/item.
---
So other than rigs there are low slot mods that can increase cpu or pwg. Im not to sure about scram kiting but i think you can do it. The Merlin is a great brawler along with the Moa as both have a +4 shield resists per lvl.

Speed tanking is generally used for sniping fits or fighting way over your class

I would like to put down any rumors of illicit activity here and now. WiNGSPAN Delivery Services seeks to serve the New Eden population with the utmost care, love, and ethical business practices. The receipt was immediately filed in our corporation logs, the error occurred was simply due to a staffing change in our filing department. 
---
We have preemptively submitted ourselves to audits from the Caldari Business Tribunal and the Gallente Commerce Association to demonstrate our transparency and dedication to proper commercial behavior. I sincerely hope that these actions express how much we care about concerns of illicit activities and that we deplore them as much as you do. If you feel our corporation could do more, then please contact an agent for an official complaint form, contact management in our public channel, and, of course, request an audit through the Concord Assembly for Trade and Commerce. 
---
Thank you for your concerns and I hope that I’ve sufficiently addressed them!
---
Thanks, and I certainly hope so. I'd also wouldn't be surprised to see forks adding alliance fits to the defaults, given it's very easy to do.  
---
Heat and boosts are static when exported from pyfa.  
---
So if you add boosts to a fit then export it the fit will always have those boosts in EFS.  
---
It's not perfect since modules won't burn out but it should let you get pretty close to what you want to test.

Realistically for it to be good without taking a decade you'd need a decently sized full time team.

The current licence for EFS doesn't really allow for monetization.

In practice either CCP would licence it and make money, or the devs would change the art assets and jitter some strings/numbers to avoid the issue.

Presumably you clicked a link of some kind. Unless you just woke up this morning in this r/Eve drama thread?

---
I actually started building a bunch of Merlins specifically for practice purposes, so I'll definitely be trying out your suggestions over the next few days. I noticed your fits incorporated hole-plugging (the anti-thermal and anti-EM rigs; I guess dcu could be considered a form of hole-plugging too) - is that a major concern in all forms of PvP?
---
currently I can afford the capital, but not the capital AND the books
---
When low effort reposts are allowed they become the overwhelming majority of the content on a sub completely drowning out any and all other content.

That would totally be possible but this conversation took place before EVE was a thing. I think if it existed already it was in its very VERY early stages of conception.

Can we please remove ganking in highsec? It will be a better quality of life improvement over wardec mechanics. At least wardecs told you when you could die. Ganking just happens for no reason but luls and is extremely frustrating. CCPlease

The other side of why injectors are bad for the game. They said they didn't want to allow alphas to be upgraded for a day to avoid infinite free cyno alts etc, but actually with extractors they are pretty much allowing free omega accounts.

yea, unless your fitting for a hard counter, your going to want to fit some em/therm resists. Cuz if a laser boat or projectile comes along; your going to be in alot of trouble
---
I thought PL didn't care so much that they left the game? No alliance tournament = dearth
---
I wish they had started with the logi change rather than eligibility. I'm not a fan of neutral logi being taken away from suspects, though. It won't change much for me, but it's one less interest thing going on in highsec.
---
I dont care for the war hq mechanic. I think we'll find that larger entities that can defend large structures will be effectively invulnerable to their targets just by manning their citadel. 
---
I don't know what modmail is or how it works, but no I did not get a ban for that. You asked for an example, that is an example of the lack of moderation I was referring to. 
---
Do allies that join a war need to have a War HQ to help the defenders?
---
Absolutely it does :-).
---
Blessed be the nerds and the geeks for they are the hope of mankind!
---
Sins of  Solar Empire does have an Eve mod.
---
That's not how it is now. Currently if you own any structure anywhere you can be wardecced. The requirement should be that you must have a structure in highsec.

Sound was good. Fun fights.

How long have you been doing these frigate 1v1s that you can (often) recognize midfight whether someone is using a certain fit, or when you should swap ammos, etc?

Eve is not cheap for some third world country guys and thanks for ccp’s capital changes now every has to have at least two account to play this game properly. So if you can’t fully pay two account with real money, you have to pay your second or third with plex. And ppl has solid reason to complain about it.

Are you going to share the incident that led to you being banned?

Automod DOES in fact have a goon flair last I looked.
---
there was a mordus themed event, here's some of the flavour text:
---
"In the universe of DUST 514, Mordu’s Legion is one of the oldest, most respected, and powerful mercenary outfits in existence. When the first cloned soldier, code-named Templar One, went rogue and broke away from his Amarr overlords, the Legion gave him sanctuary. Mordu’s Legion was the first to embrace the cloned soldier not merely as a weapon, but as a human being.
---
Yet since those early days, millions of these cloned soldiers have emerged and set up mercenary companies of their own. Faced with scores of independents who are willing and able to die and die again, the Legion’s place in the cluster is at risk. Now their eccentric founder, Muriya Mordu, has decided to issue a challenge to every cloned mercenary to prove their worth. And he’s backing up his words with weapons, dropsuits, and equipment for anyone who can show off the power of the new order."

Olmeca the amount of hate you have for goons "a video game alliance" is unhealthy. You really need to find another hobby my friend.
---
Wait really:(. Ffs.

Thanks and yep.  
---
Obviously usability improvements are always positive so I'll keep tweaking that.  
---
The AI isn't awful but certainly there are improvements to make for stuff like positioning and perhaps controls.  
---
For mechanics I do plan to work through the list of limitations, although implementing this stuff can be time consuming.  
---
In terms of other stuff I'm open to suggestions.  
---
The project inadvertently obtains damage based efficiency for alliances^1 so I might do something with that.  
---
^1 damage * isk value of target / damage taken by target (summed for the alliance and divided by losses)
---
The actual game did not contain that. I can't speak for the lore. There wasn't really units in the game. You picked a style of suit and a loadout. Skills worked much like eve skills.
---
hi Chance, i miss your torpedoes delivery video
---
I believe the standard tactic to solve this is either to make your small alliances 1 or more corps, the other alliance does the same and you form a single new alliance or 1 alliance consolidates down and rolls into the other alliance.
---
Personally, I think nullsec mission agents would be awesome. Putr an ihub upgrade or citadel service mod in place. Level 1 or 2 can be in the same system. Level 3 one jump out 4 two jumps and level fives can be 5+ jumps away.
---
&gt;stay somewhere where they are constantly farmed?

That describes half of null based corps.

the toolbar with every shortcut you can click that is on the left by default
---
&gt; we will be unable to support each other in any meaningful way.
---
You can still DPS same targets can't you ? That is pretty damn meaningful.
---
Generally double clicking the toggle works fairly well, have you tried that?  
---
The toggle goes from white to blue when clicked, so if you click it twice it goes blue then grey and the group will unselected.  
---
On slow systems it can be laggy with big top level groups (like Frigate), so that could be an issue?
---
1 question I am unclear on. If you're in a small corp that only has 1 single structure, and that structure is located in NS or WH, will this default to being HQ then ? Or is the eligibility wardec mechanic changed so that you can declare war only vs corps / alliances with structures in HS ?
---
If I get decced on my 1 person alt corp am sure as hell aint gonna build any structures in HS for the high seccers, so how will this work ? 
---
You always needed at least two accounts to your own cap alt. CCP did nothing to affect this minimum. 
---
This is your argument? Really? Are you just pretending to be retarded? Every fucking timezone has "Englishman".

im sure he also mine in like 10 rorqs alts.

Holy fuck how dumb must you be to still insist.
---
Erdogan got rid of the opposition by baiting the 2016 coup attempt.
---
You try get rid of me by baiting me into bannable stuff.
---
You are authoritarian. You are the Erdogan. I am the resistance.
---
PS: If you are trying to bait me to talk bad about Erdogan that's not gonna work as I don't live in Turkey. But that would downgrade you a few levels in the scale of human trash so I don't want to think that way.
---
So cute how desparated some people are. Now the glorified North is pushing Moral off T2 fitted Carriers. I hope a Wall of Text and YouTube Guide Olmeca/Marshy will following soon!
---
It's true, I've seen him on our discord.
---
they already are even with mod bans 
---
Now we need the equivalent for caps, supers, rorqs
---
Still waiting!!
---
Stiill waiting!
---
Word. Well sounds fun and I will give it a try.

Your BR is out. BL were on Snuff's side.

*"How about you tell us more about the nice fights with almost equal outcome in the beginning of the deployment where our titans were left home but instead you kept batphoning half of eve?"* 
---
Please show me on these BRs where we batphoned "half of eve?"

All of those fights were roughly equal numbers. Then Snuff moved titans down which means the batphones will have to get bigger.

Dude get over yourself.
---
We've been talking with Pearl Abyss about this recently.
---
We didn’t have it anywhere in our plans to localise into Korean, but one of the biggest things that their staff asked when they found out about the acquisition of CCP was if EVE was available in Korean.
---
Pearl Abyss have been talking with us about having one of their local vendors translate EVE into Korean, then handing us the localised content to put into the client.
---
Not sure where we currently are with it as I've been focused on other things and a little out of the loop about what's going on with it, but we could possibly see Korean client localisation in 2019.
---
If we make headway on it, we'll be sure to blog or release news about it :)
---
*insert fry take my money meme*
---
Yeah, now that you got me thinking about it, the previous comment didn't even deserve the "sorta", miner qualifier or not. The state of the null blob today is not what it's always been. We can debate what the dankest of krabs might have been motivated to do, but the game was absolutely not always the massive funnel into one of two blue donuts.
---
Oh my sweet summer child
---
&gt; whenever a corporation or alliance declares a non-mutual war they will be required to select a specific Upwell Structure they own somewhere in **highsec** space. 
---
Collateral Damage?
---
And links.  I quit in like 2010 last time and it was a problem then
---
I'm not saying this game is in it's perfect place, there's a lot that needs to be done and fixed still, but I think, as usual, the eve is dying cries are just what they've always been, people not liking certain changes. CCP HAS been making a lot of good changes, wether people want to admit it or not, and among the unfortunate things like no AT this year, the small things fly under the radar.
---
  
---
I just continue to see speculation and complaining about how this game is dying, which is always so damn negative, and when there's a part of me that doesn't agree with that, I feel the need to try to counteract that shit because I love this game beyond belief, I don't want it to go away, and I don't see how the negativity helps anyone. Blame me for that if you want, I don't care.
---
Everyone is a little bit goon.
---
azns bad!  
---
whites good!
---
Is an increase of 25%. Sounds good to me.
---
One can get a couple big hits of repairs off via ancil reps on T1 logi. And T1 logi is dirt cheap. So more likely to see an uptick in suicide logi in frigate form and the occasional T1 logi cruiser. Because \~20m for a few logi cycles versus losing a bling T3C or faction battleship is an easy trade.
---
Beyond that the good logi is probably just going to be in the dec corp anyways for that content crowd.
---
This could be cool if you could scan other systems in your constellation. Anything beyond that would absurd. It would be really funny to see daytripper fleets orbiting the nestor while he scans down a hole, though.
---
Wat da fuq. 
---
Not everyone can convert their X hours of game grinding to payable labor. Get used to the fact that what worked for you that one time in that one place doesn't work for everyone everywhere all the time.
---
If plex gets too expensive, those who grind for it simply won't any more. They'll lapse to alpha and when their alpha status becomes a hindrance or frustration, they'll find a different game to play. Demand for plex drops, plex market value drops a bit, the market finds a new norm with a few less plex being consumed. That's the reality CCP faces now and why they are going to make an effort to appease plex consumers. 
---
/r/conspiracy called, they wanted to give your tinfoil hat back
---
i like it. the thought process, the fit... do you ever look at your target? manual piloting to slingshot can be VERY useful, specially against kiters. always look for the oppurtunity!
---
It seems fishy but it’s actually not and the other responses here have hit the nail on the head. It’s to be able to see if there’s anything in your mails, wallet, or whatnot that would indicate that you are a spy.
---
If you’re not a spy, then you’re fine.
---
Great news!
---
$100 worth of plex converted to ISK is enough to buy a Condor, right?
---
What makes you think that?
---
so, neither insurance nor being able to afford to lose it/replace it if needed? i would not recommend that...
---
&gt;2) [Over a week ago I was banned from r/eve for 3 days by /u/ZeldenGM because I said there was mod bias on r/eve, in a private message to moderator team (in his defense my language was agitated and unappreciative).  
---
Calm the fuck down. I've been [banned twice](https://i.imgur.com/GnPrKU6.png), both times for memeing on mods. Once for some Gigx/Judge *Hand* shitpost and the second for a shitpost about Mods being asleep and posting some sort of content they were trying to kill with fire that particular week.   
---
It was funny as hell to me. I didn't throw a hissyfit claiming censorship and some grand karmaconspiracy.  
---
You are too far inside your own head, or enjoy trolling /r/eve just a biiiiiit too much for a healthy person...
---
The only game mechanic you need for that is evemail. Just tell the corp you'll pay them for a kill. The ingame system isn't just broken, it's pointless as well.
---
Desparated?
---
What I've learned from being a HR director in a goon member Corp? DO NOT FUCK WITH GOON HR!
---
Keep your members authorized and get issues resolved quickly.
---
Came here expecting a gif of the F1 key being pressed repeatedly. I am dissapoint.
---
you're grasping at straws;
---
ship cost: 2 bil fitted. insurance.. 300m? let's round and say:
---
total cost of a cap: 2.5 bil
---
   
---
available liquid: 5bil (2x cap, i.e "can replace").  
---
cost of cap after skillboox: 3.5b (i.e "cant replace") 
---
Time to sort by controversial
---
Not entirely true. I came back from an 8 year break and having a blast with the pve and pvp. I'm currently 8-3 in the arena but overall isk positive.
---
My most expensive ship so far has only been about 800m for ship and pod and have killed a few ships worth 2bn+. The pvp largely is a rock paper scissors arena but you can do things to hedge your bets.
---
As for the PVE aspect of abyss, there is lots of money to be made and is not that difficult for lower tiers once you understand how the spawns work. Once you make some isk from the sites you can start to bling up a ship to do more t4 or t5 sites
---
Bounties are by far the largest ISK faucet in the game right now. One way or another, you'd want to limit the intake since so insanely much ISK is gained, be it trough anoms, mission rats etc.
---
A thing one has to have in mind when balancing is fairness. What if a super pilot wanted to quit EVE for a year or two, would he still have to pay monthly titan bills?
---
A direct nerf, while being rather a brute change, would be effective still, at least upfront. Would that lead to people instead just ratting more is a good question. Rather, the optimal solution would be that players simply ratted less. Less ISK comes to the game and instead players focusing on other aspects. Trading, services, PI, manufacturing, just something that keeps the ISK changing hands but not pouring into the game in massive quantities as it is right now coming in.
---
Get fucked PIRAT
---
not speaking for him
---
but personally for me, I would say after several months of a specific hull size do you start to get a feel for it
---
a year+ to be good at it and to know right away what's possible with their fitting space etc
---
hmmm, I'm probably remembering much earlier.
---
Back before he started the anti-goon crusade and just posted a lot of garbage about economics and how to get rich by poopsocking the auction house or implant market. At that point he seemed to approve most comments. I kinda stopped reading his drivel after a while, the secondhand reports were :psyduck: enough.
---
They can be probed down.
---
If you are in highsec, the risk is wardecs or suicide gankers.
---
In all other securities, the risk is getting jumped. :)
---
"ran a locator on the character."
---
Explain this?
---
We didn't have a chat besides what was in the modmail. That's what he means. You just misunderstood it then.
---
This is it guys, an AI training program for making those PvP bots we've been joking about!
---
That was in the context of the modmail convo you retarded fuck.
---
gf, and we almost had the titans too!
---
Damn goon botters. Literally everywhere.
---
The mission agents sometimes offer a located service. You type on the name of the character you eant to locate and depending on where they are, they respond instantly, one minute, 5 minutes and up for in system, in constellation ,in region. Else. Useful for hunting certain people. Back in the day where titan hunting was a legit tactic of destroying a major objective, cyno alts, the titan pilot, the sitter pilot, all were constantly ran through locator agents. Several supers and titans died to this plus good scouting. 
---
Literally everyone who sperg hate on me on this subreddit is your alliance's redditors (who live in their own bubble) and some people buying into the narrative you created.
---
It's exactly the isolationism you are trying to pull off. Culturally motivate 100 alliancemates to shit on some person, trigger him further with shit slinging and mod bias, get a few neutrals on your side, then claim nobody likes him.
---
&gt;You are authoritarian. You are the Erdogan. I am the resistance.
---
L M A O
---
When low effort reposts are allowed they become the overwhelming majority of the content on a sub completely drowning out any and all other content.
---
&gt; You don't know anything about it and this post is proof.
---
I know there are about 5 people leading it. I know only these people can initiate war campaigns. For some reason they are incredibly anti-war and anti-content. I know things like even your JB network is optimized for taxation, rather than optimizing PvE or optimizing fleets. For some reason your leaders don't want content, but want to maintain the largest Eve entity. That's way to kill the game for personal interest.
---
I know your people shit on me for every elaborately constructed balance argument. I know you promote extreme pleb carebearism by maintaining an unopposable supercap umbrella. I know plebs moving into your region kill content in the rest of nullsec.
---
I know your organizational scheme breeds toxicity, egoism and RMT. I know a great deal of your MER income comes from botting.
---
You wanna talk about many ways Goon leadership decisions are killing Eve? I am all for it.
---
See this is what i mean, i laughed. And it requires a conscious effort to not upvote this because of that.
---
Please do this, it seems like an amazing opportunity. 
---
Not sure how this is very surprising to anyone.
---
Sometimes I wonder if the Goons' origins have faded from public knowledge.
---
That's not about my hurt feelings. That's about how a mod must actually should be impartial. So that's about how shit you are governing this subreddit. You have this delusion that you can detach your mod identity from your personal hatred of people. You can't.
---
Then again reddit is not the best place for people to self govern a modding system. The site lets you do whatever you want. A complete lack of enforce rules for mods (don't tell me moddiquette, as they won't care about you breaching it) is one of this site's weak suites.
---
This post is not about that 3 days ban.
---
This post is about how mods are actively trying to create reasons to perma ban me.
---
r/evejobs is that way 👉
---
Idgi 
---
Certainly, that irishmafia guy made some joke about mods response to a low effort BR someone posted so I responded with:
---
"Yea because the mods of this sub have ever actually done their jobs here?
---
Is today the day you start moderating this sub the way it should be?"
---
One day ban. Must have hurt his feelings. Nice flex I guess? Probably soothed his ego and reaffirmed his dominance over us reddit peons. 
---
So much for not slinging trigger happy bans right? 
---
&gt;  It's almost like their top priority is to keep the money (RL or ingame) flowing.
---
Just gonna quote that, for truth.
---
&gt; You wanna talk about many ways Goon leadership decisions are killing Eve? I am all for it.
---
Not really, I don't particularly care. Mostly because it's not my problem. If Eve dies because goons won, well, I had my fun. I'll just carry on with life and interact with the friends I've mad. If one group can kill eve that means it was critically flawed from the get go. Something you fail to understand about a lot of people in GSF is that they aren't laughing at dumb shit - like botters dying or idiot krabs dying - as a form of propaganda. They are laughing because those people are idiots and it's funny. There are those who bite down on whatever the propaganda line is hard, sure. But there are plenty that simply... don't. It's a video game dude, not real life. Being in a space guild isn't the same as being in your countries military. You get laughed at because you take the game so seriously that you can't even tell the difference anymore.
---
Uhh... you completely missed the perspective there mate.
---
You can't even tell the difference between jabber and discord and now you think you're qualified to lecture me on how reddits modding system works? You didn't even realize that a screenshot provided to you proved that no mod - automod included - took mod actions on it. Now you're an expert on mod - admin relations?
---
Take a break dude. Your god complex is showing.
---
Jade Constantine? Is that you?
---
Completely wrong country mate
---
Amen!
---
We have had 3 reasons to permaban you and chose not to. Ask yourself why.
---
He's saying you aren't people.
---
/u/CCP_Falcon tell us a story of when you will be taking over publishing and localization of Black Desert Online for NA and EU when Pearl Abyss buys out its contract with Kakao games or their contract expires and Pearl Abyss wants to give CCP more work.
---
I kind of wish we'd join in on frat/skillurselfs side, watching test try to handle something with out goons would be amusing as fuck, plus it would take us back to curse.
---
we dont have fun here )
---
Guise it has been 3 years since game released the 16 yo tamer is now 19yo it's all completely legal now plz stop with this lewd comments j thx
---
You and the other mod admitted that you are on the lookout for reasons to permaban me in your alliance jabber.
---
There is no value in you claiming otherwise here. If you chose not to ban me, that's surely against what you actually want and you will do so when you can.
---
You've never been to wormhole space, have you?
---
&gt; Literally everyone who sperg hate on me on this subreddit is your alliance's redditors (who live in their own bubble) and some people buying into the narrative you created.
---
I see alliance leaders (not goon) in this thread actively shitting on you. 
---
&gt; It's exactly the isolationism you are trying to pull off.
---
Stop trying to sound like you're a political and social genius. The term is dumb and demonstrably false. Just read your own thread and look at the people shitting on you. Hint: It's not all goons. You somehow got bitter enemies in game united for the sole purpose of calling you a moron. Good job.
---
&gt; You did it to Vic Jefferson, Doom, Chessur and many others who had a problem with Goons or how they play the game.
---
Dooms a good buddy of mine. Knowledge is power!
---
&gt; You live inside a bubble. You are not in a position to judge who is liked in this community and who is not. And I don't go around trying to trigger people in order to ban them. That's what real assholes do.
---
I didn't judge who the community should like or not. They disliked you all on their own. All I did was show why *I* didn't like you - and it's because you're a lying space nerd whose only claim to relevancy is sperging on reddit. You offer yourself up on a silver platter because you lack anything else to warrant attention. I don't like people like you because you have nothing of value to offer. You contribute nothing. All you do is shit on those who do contribute. You're an armchair philosopher in the worst sort of way. 
---
You get cloaky camped because you're vulnerable, and folks will keep camping you until you start to fight back. 
---
&gt; I actually started building a bunch of Merlins
---
I hope you don't mean you started production of Merlins just to have a bunch for yourself, didn't you? Because while sounding kinda good, it's a really inefficient way to do things.
---
as long as grandma is ok :(
---
I don't need to be a tech expert to know reddit pretty much let's small subreddit mods to do whatever they want.
---
If you hate reddit that much, why don't you delete your account and go post on voat or something?
---
Agree Completely.
---
What wrong with pleasing everyone
---
I will spend money on EVE again once CCP stops using the EVE revenue to produce complete utter garbage (mobile games).
---
You apparently don't need to be a reddit expert to spew your garbage either because you have no idea what you're talking about. Reddit admins actively enforce what moderators do. You've never modded a subreddit - nor do you have any real reddit experience at all based on some of the brigading attempts you've tried - so your opinion is based on quite literally nothing.
---
Do you remember the mod strike we did because you were an idiot? Do you remember the screenshot from the admins I stickied on the subreddit? It's also worth nothing that the mod team here doesn't just only mod r/eve which warrants extra attention on what we do. r/eve isn't even the biggest subreddit mod team I'm on. 
---
For shits and giggles: Remember when you said only upvotes were the proper way to enforce reddit then you came screaming back to us calling for moderation? I remember :)
---
&gt;  I don't like people like you because you have nothing of value to offer. You contribute nothing. All you do is shit on those who do contribute. You're an armchair philosopher in the worst sort of way.
---
Lol. I actually am playing this game at a higher innovative edge. I share my know-how and balance opinions. I create content for myself or for people I FC. I create content for people following my footsteps in the game.
---
Like this post is incredibly ironic coming from you. Nobody knows what you even do in Eve. While I am getting shit exactly because my methods in game matter. Just because you put in some work to this subreddit just to boost your ego, you somehow tricked yourself into thinking you actually have offered any contribution to this game's community. 
---
https://zkillboard.com/system/30003467/
---
i wish your posting was made up
---
1. Small shield extenders are generally useless, they give you very small bonus while using precious fitting slot.
---
2. Small cap baterries generally useless too. If you really need more cap for PvP, use cap boosters instead.
---
3. Do not leave rig slots empty. Fit with any empty slots is really bad with rare exceptions. It's like a car with only half of wheels attached.
---
&gt; You are authoritarian. You are the Erdogan. I am the resistance.

Sweet summer child
---
The thoughts of both deadtear being an r/eve mod and telling you to fuck yourself have my chortling delightedly to myself. Thanks, both of you, you've made my evening! :yayclod:
---
No, you're actually just insane.
---
Serious question, Olmeca: Are you a believer in the "gangstalking" phenomenon? If you don't know what I mean, search for it on YT. These people are mentally ill and believe that everyone they see is stalking them or recording their actions in some way. It's really surreal to listen to them talk about how the guy they saw on the bus who scratched his leg was secretly signaling something to another conspiracy member.
---
Not trying to insult you, but this sounds a lot like what you do in these threads. Everyone who disagrees with you is obviously a goon alt or some mod trying to do 4d chess to silence you or something, everything is a goon conspiracy, etc. Your life revolves around this group of people in a video game and while at first I must admit I found it funny, it's getting to the point where I'm genuinely concerned about your mental well being mate. Healthy people do not act like this.
---
You know what doesn't change? No gate from lowsec to stain
---
&gt; Like this post is incredibly ironic coming from you. Nobody knows what you even do in Eve. While I am getting shit exactly because my methods in game matter. 
---
That's because I don't get my sense of self worth from a video game. I have no need for validation from people about things I do for fun. You do. 
---
&gt; I went through your entire post history to find anything interesting about Eve, and all I found was cheeto Trump love, which didn't surprise me tbh lol.
---
Try again!
---
I would like to formally retract this statement in light of you being a dipshit. https://imgur.com/a/EbOZ2ed
---
Also, isn't the Abyss a new form of Pve with a new AI, etc?
---
Congrats I hate goons now, ironically it has less to do with the points you seem perpetually determined to make here and more because they haven't mod'ed you into oblivion yet. 
---
Please. Stop. Posting.  
---
sincerely,  
---
Yeah everything's racist blah blah virtue signal harder. I bet you get so much pussy bro; you never say anything politically incorrect or potentially offensive to anyone.
---
It's been awhile since I was in goons proper, but normally theta squad would have jumped in a sacrificial fax or two to keep the carrier alive while they formed a larger force. Not sure what happened there.
---
4 reasons - you are posting IRL politics in r/eve, literally as we speak.
---
Um. This br is wrong.

And the fight was over the sggrn tatara not the azbel. The azbel died uncontested after the fight
---
Welcome, friend. I recommend you do the career agents as well as the Sisters of EVE epic arc. Both of which you can find in your Agency menu. Once you've got a bit of a feel for it, look into joining a newbie friendly corporation like Karmafleet or Brave. Avoid Pandemic Horde though, it's a clown show.
---
Vily?
---
I'm p. sure deadtear would end up being the butch in that relationship.

Perimeter brawls have been the most fun I have had in fleet fights for years

&gt; While I appreciate your concern for my well being, 
---
I wasn't worried about your well being. I was worried about others. You can dig around if you're curious, but let's not talk about it anymore in this thread, please.
---
You called me Erdoğan before. Guess that's not politics but it is when I call you a Cheeto. 
---
Yeah I did, so is that why you called me that here? Can you even follow your logic?
---
No, you did.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/916fbh/mods_you_are_stupid_and_childish_for_doing_this/

You're also wrong btw. Go through my post history again. You don't read what anyone tells you anyways so I guess it doesn't matter - but you ought to considering you're basically in love with me.
---
This isn't a good post

He makes so much off of excavators whats the need

So is he good or bad?

I this thread, you called me Erdoğan first.

Ssshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

You get your self worth from satisfying your power complex via modding a game subreddit. I get mine in contributing to the enjoyment people get from playing the game. It's amazing you don't see yours is the lowlife here, or how you attempt comparing contributions in full knowledge of you having nothing interesting Eve related to offer.
---
Ssshhhhhhhhhhhhhh
---
&gt; You get your self worth from satisfying your power complex via modding a game subreddit
---
I get it from my wife, my home and my career actually!
---
&gt;  I get mine in contributing to the enjoyment people get from playing the game.
---
You are actually admitting to getting your sense of self worth from a video game? Dear god dude. Please, seek help. Seriously. I'm not even memeing with you or anything. This is legitimately concerning.
---
And miss out all this delicious drama? 
---
&gt; still a stupid as fuck rule
---
You're either a fucking retard or you weren't here when the mods all stopped deleting anything that didn't break sitewide rules for a week because of retards bitching about that rule.
---
Ah, the great Yulai Incident. Forgotten times. 
---
Heh. Depending on how reliable this simulator is at matching up with the results of actual fights, it will certainly be used in that regard.
---
A simulator project was one of the things on the table back when I was doing shit for Goonswarm about 3 years ago. The best I did was making Evebreaker, which was just an excel sheet that brute-forced all possible weapon fittings on all ships and measured their damage output on a single target. Never managed to actually finish Evebreaker either but it was used to develop a few of our doctrines (Feroxes in particular).
---
Yeah, this is certainly going to be used for fight outcome analysis.
---
Masters of Orion!
---
We hired one of those guys recently, he was super-stoked that someone remembered MoO.
---
You are much more engaged with this game if you are willing to predatorily force someone into make mistakes so you can ban them. Like this kind of thing shouldn't be important to anyone ever. That is the kind of behavior that you need to get checked at a mental health facility 
---
Whereas people can derive happiness and self worth from being good in a hobby, and contributing to other peoples enjoyment of a hobby, and that's totally normal actually.
---
And now you are dickswinging your career and family with me like you are the only one with those lol. That's small af. 
---
You spelled Solitude wrong

[http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Solitude#sec](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Solitude#sec)

Erm... Mo0 was Masters of Ownage afaik...

MoO as in the game has nothing to do with this and is an entirely separate thing afaik.

Well... i mean, snuff is 1300 man vs an alliance that is 700 man and an alliance that is 800 man (these two operate in different TZs). So it's natural for these entities to Batphone each other. As a DHSJ pleb I havent seen you guys batphone at all, but we're not really the target of this conflict. That being said, you dont need to batphone when you drop supers to fight gilas.
---
You are retarded. They didnt ban you because you are so stupid we are laughing at you best content for eve sonce 2003.
---
You are unhinged.
---
Are you doing a he said she said arguement and not providing proof?! HAHAHAHAHA 
---
I love fighting you guys. it's just a cuck when the caps drop. Gimme more of dat subcap shit.
---
This coming from a horde guy.
---
We lost the fort because the cucks dropped supers. It's a safety net for them because they usually feed to us without it. I'm kinda salty about it but if i had it, you bet your ass i'd use it.
---
Shhh.  I'm nesting.
---
But did you get the shoes?
---
Ah.  I was not aware (or had forgotten) that the tank was higher.  Good to know.
---
nolak ran a loan service, if you think he was of any relevance to any financial part of the alliance, you're sadly mistaken
---
Diamond rats are a high level CCP-Goon conspiracy designed specifically to target lolmeca and marshy
---
My thought this entire month reading his posting, tbh
---
I assume in the same we we’ve always been 1337 :)
---
It's literally what goons are known for: trolling pubbies
---
Are you TEST's Olmecca? If you're not shitting on TEST, someone from TEST, or trying to pretend you were there in some "golden age", you're probably not posting.
---
Nice video! I enjoy them, good content with commentary is rare.
---
The Ritter is kinda terrible though, this config is cool but the speed is so bad that any scram kiter can just pull range and leave it things go badly. Thankfully most are bad and don’t. 
---
not if it means having to cooperate with the chinese government
---
Like it or hate it - just imagine the tidi on the DayOne reset.  
---
Anyways, how far away is April 1st?  Imagine logging into an empty ALT-T.   CCP would probably get a class action suit for cleaning bills from everyone shitting themselves.
---
Anything that exposes more people to EVE Online has got to be a good thing.  Localisation is even better. 
---
Nah, he can stay there and not come back to Australia.  We don't need bottom feeding backstabbers like him here.  We have enough of them in the current government as it is and he lightened the load when he left..
---
Uh, guys... I think we broke him. *Guys?*
---
U realize they make more on Plex than subs, right? $20 vs $10
---
Probably some t3c with utility, or a bhaalgorn mixed in. I usually 5box and bring 2 logi along
---
Not quite Naz level but good for a laugh, take your up vote.
---
We at Pirat are actually perfectly fine with removing neutral logi. It’s a tool we’ve used, but isn’t necessary. The ones you see giving you salt are just bads!
---
This is fun! Thanks!  
---
WH weather effects would be a cool thing to add.  
---
Not likely. For the most part everyone is excited about these changes. 
---
I banned him
---
neut logi in highsec was always a BS mechanic
---
design a doctrine around targets you are likely to encounter
---
scout, tackle, hammer, utility are roles to combine for a solo comp
---
With only 3 toons, I would suggest covert T3 with combats as your scout+intial tackle - you really cant afford to go 3x BS, strong as it is. If you go sabre, you need to run a T3 in one of the other slots for probes and gimp it with a covert sub (running a sabre sacrifices a slot worth of kill pressure if you dont have friends coming). Loki is probably the most versatile - prot is slow, legion has too few mids, tengu is shit.
---
You hammer is the cavalry coming in to dunk whatever you decided your engagement profile is. If you want to kill capstable T3/strats, neut legion is a decent choice as mentioned. But so is a solo bhaal, leshak, followed by dreka, mach, nightmare, hyperion (2 neuts), neut domi.
---
Utility can be a falcon, nestor, zarm, XLASB AT-style solo basi, curse, rapier, links bc, 3-link boosher, screening web loki. All of these are dank with 1x BS comps. Double BS comps wont bring a utility slot in favor of another hammer.
---
&gt;I hope we get a good Korean localization that brings more ~~players~~ bots to the server.

FTFY

No, you see.  He gets *free excavators* to mine with

FUUUUUUUUCK SNUFFF!
---
Check the olmeca thread. That spy better be a director with the amount of retard in the post
---
Share your lossmail? 
---
So THAT was the neutral keep that everyone was wondering about
---
Dude...what part of I see it every single day do you not understand. I can't even with this community. 
---
Well my idea was there would be a basement point, where the ship wouldn't fly until you fixed it if you left it too long and the repairs will be about 1/3rd the value of the ship but that is a very good point, it does seem a bit ubsurd that I can make 15mil ticks from afk ratting and such
---
Eve is shit now. The Meta needs a broom taken to it. But the devs have been handcuffed so I don't play tbh. I talk to a few.friends I made . Listen to these whackos on comms fap to mining in rorquals and doing their complimentary citadel shooting calling it pvp. 😆
---
Logarithmic scale range slider would be super helpful. And/or shortcuts to common ranges. 
---
5-20km is a big range to be fighting at that can be making big differences. 
---
There's very little difference to be made between 40-60k for most fleets though. 
---
South. North dont play games....
---
Meanwhile in South Korea video games are a national interest. Their gamers are more professional than other so called professional gamers. 
---
Video games are serious business over there.
---
It's so the attacker has something to loose and the defender, after he defends, can take the offensive.
---
Isnt this how people start playing eve? 
---
&gt; BTW some botter was tryin to downvote you.
---
nah, people just dislike me.
---
and the truth.
---
&gt;Definetly, it should cost at least 5-6 hours / day while super ratting
---
i mean, it's supply and demand. if people can rat that much without issue then subbing at that price won't be an issue.
---
&gt; Whereas people can derive happiness and self worth from being good in a hobby, and contributing to other peoples enjoyment of a hobby, and that's totally normal actually.
---
No, it's definitely not normal to get your sense of self worth from a 16  year old spaceship MMO. Not in any way, shape or form. Even if you change the term 'video game' to 'hobby'.
---
&gt; And now you are dickswinging your career and family to me like you are the only one with those lol. That's small af.
---
It's a literal answer to you assertation that I get my sense of self worth from reddit. I don't. I regularly fuck off from reddit for months at a time. Not sure why someone having a career and goals intimidates you but you might want to unfuck that part of your life. You way *way* to into something that is temporary and done, at best, for fun in your spare time. It's cool to enjoy and talk about Eve. It's not cool to replace huge portions of your life (EG: Your sense of self worth) with it. That's a *serious* problem and it's not a joke. I wish the best for you man. It doesn't feel right debating you about this anymore. You have far bigger problems and even acknowledging you is encouraging something buried very deeply in you. I honestly wish you well. Take care, friend.
---
Probably shouldn't have t2 rigs on a t2 mids/lows nid. Not enough bang for the buck.
---
Thanks for sharing details of the war!
---
I was gonna say, dudes an amateur.
---
It took only 8 years guys! Only 8 years!
---
Maybe we can turn Eve into that Startrek episode where they simulated battles so that we don’t have to step away form our rorquals for that pesky PvP trash
---
well are you going to lock boosters to biology skill, is bio 5 the new number 1 newbro skill to train
---
I honestly don't know how you managed to drop several dreads and a carrier and our infamous "OP Super Umbrella" didn't destroy everything you had.   
---
But thats besides the point. Good kill! Keep the content alive. 
---
They can't all be winners.
---
In this case, I can only assume said Nidhoggur did not think about lighting a cyno before it was destroyed. 5 dreads will down a carrier very quickly. More than likely the nidhoggur was dead before it could alert theta to the drop.. If by some way this pilot did inform theta and had a cyno lit. Every Fax/Dread/Super/Titan pilot in 1dq/d-w listening would have jumped in hopes of getting another killmark. 
---
Goons have to do damage control. Nobody else will stand up for us. Just be glad you haven't read a "Already Replaced" yet. 
---
Join a proper corp that you can constantly ask questions in.  In Hisec ideally to get your footing, then go off elsewhere if you so choose.
---
You're welcome to join MALRO, we are based in Gallente space, and are extremely welcoming to new players.  Very low tax rate, and lots of guys that are very helpful.  I got my start with them.
---
https://discord.gg/U2DhgY5
---
It honestly wouldn't be shocking. I truly believe alot of people join goons to get stuff their alliances won't offer that we do.
---
Rip.
---
It's called Diablo3/WoW
---
I believe this was during a time where a large portion of the super fleet was cleaning up Period Basis, so response was likely limited at the time. 
---
It has been since I started in 2010. Which donuts there was to choose has changed over time, but there has always been pacts between groups that basically split into two major groups.
---
Sounds cool you're enjoying just flying around. Keep doing that, you'll learn a lot that'll help you later even just by literally random flying around like.. auto pilot/not auto, bookmarks, bubbles, scanning, intel, etc..
---
Null newbie corps are fine but, the rest of the game has a lot, A LOT, of random crazy stuff you can do. I think someone posted a pic of some career paths, check that out. Not hating on anyone recommending those newbie corps, they're great for what they are. You'll see a lot of combat, be part of big wars, politics, learn heaps, make a bunch of money, lots of personal interaction etc. 
---
Consider specialized groups like CODE. for example who roleplay and suicide gank targets in high sec. They're the surviving cultists of the Heavens Gate mass suicide turned into an Eve corp(jk?). There are a slew of pretty particular groups/communities/corps out there that specialize in an aspect of the game. Run around for a while and figure out you like scanning? There's a group that does that for wormholes. Like suicide ganking, pirating, market trading, missions, incursions, exploring, faction war, mining, industry, ratting, whatever.. there's a group out there doing it.
---
\--
---
Long, random thought, late night rant PS: 
---
Probably already said or will be said, but, don't be afraid to lose ships. That is how you will learn. Go buy a dozen of the cheapest ship in your area and go out and fight and die. See what happens. How fast can you get yourself killed and where was it? How did it happen? Avoid that the next run and see how far you get ship#2. Read some other ship descriptions, could another ship last longer? Can you send a conversation to the person and convince him to not kill you? Can you sweet talk your way into his heart, and then wallet? Might be able to make a few hundred mill on his feel bads for killing a newb. Kinda sorta kidding.. but, people do scam people, others are diplomats for thousand person coalitions, both just conversations in the end. Maybe become space bros and fight the next poor soul with him and learn from him. Then back stab him anyway and kill him as revenge from before? Eve is satanic, do what thou wilt is the whole of the law. 
---
So, think about another game, do you know Starcraft? Would you hold off playing a full game until you get to play in the finals of a tournament? No, you play 20 practice games a day, none of which the goal is to win. You don't want to sit in ships you're afraid of losing/dying. If you're too scared to use your ship, you're not getting practice and you won't know how to use it. You need to see every scenario, 10 times, to know how to fight this or that, your weaknesses and strengths. Flash isn't good because he preserved his practice game win rates, he has thousands of games played and come tourney time he has seen everything. 
---
The guy posting his 7 points laid it out well and his last point made me think of this whole post. He mentioned lots of people quit because they don't find their place. You very well may like being in a newb null corp. But, maybe not. You may be bitter at how much time and effort you put into it and end up hating the new part time job you picked up. Its why I mentioned the specialized corps out there. If you enjoy the game, the last thing you want to do is not enjoy the game...
---
You're new, play around, poke around, kill and die, meet people, make money, lose money, get scammed like a scrub, get a couple bros to enact revenge on a completely innocent target, and then find what it is you like and then build your sandbox around it. 
---
lol nice meltdown
---
Simple solution is to use NPC stations or citadels that you control
---
Its been updated, alot. Every patch, i wait like 3 days or so and Z-S gives a update, they(Z-S's in game chat) also have a mailing List that sends a eve-mail and lets you know a update is out.
---
You have no idea of what highsec corps are about do you? If they wanted to fight, they would. People are in highsec because they don't want to fight. Keep on forcing PvP  on newbs and see where that gets you.
---
The whole point behind these changes is to eliminate the small alliances and compel everyone to join larger corps. The GOONSM has spoken and CCP obeys.
---
can somone trl all this shit
---
Dude,  we will sh*t on Frt/skill in a couple weeks,  don't worry. 
---
If you're not scared to die and you want to learn very quickly, join Brave, Karmafleet or Horde, train frigates, all three of them will give you free tackle frigates, and stay undocked in those frigs. Shoot at anything that's not blue, and ask the vets for advice at any opportunity, they'll be happy to help :)
---
Full reinforcement cycle in hisec is too much "guaranteed time" for wardec. I would suggest that war HQs would have shortened reinforcement cycle for example same as structures have in wh space --&gt; something like 3 days
---
This^
---
Hmmm, I have mixed feelings on this.  
---
A log scale doesn't seem overly intuitive and I'm hesitant to have three input methods.  
---
I tend to just type in more specific numbers, do you find that inconvenient?
---
lol here we fucking go, it's the 'yell at Team A for blobbing because you're in Team B who also blobs' game again [https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/mobile/000/023/397/C-658VsXoAo3ovC.jpg](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/mobile/000/023/397/C-658VsXoAo3ovC.jpg)
---
Looking forward to this devblog... more diamond rats for the players. The only current way to interact with them is getting wrecked by them in numbers at FOB's etc, which is a huge shame for a great concept!
---
You can add environmental effects in pyfa then export the fits.  
---
Does that fit your needs?
---
Cursed vid.
---
Khanid ships
---
Where are the booshes? :o Just joking. This is a very nice gimmick.
---
It would be nice if there was an option "anchor on FC". Different ship types currently run around wild.
---
When I tried to import a fit from zkill I've got  "**Unable to parse fit information"** Same for importing from pyfa. Maybe I'll open an issue on github.
---
Choosing ammunition would be nice for the fits. Are command bursts properly integrated? atm, you'd have to add each different command burst on its own.
---
The default fits have a lot of double naming. Please at least add a number to make those names unique.
---
What kind of horrible and barbaric person use the YYYY-MM-DD format
---
Now that's what I'm talking about! 
---
And you think people take you yerious if you start off with an insult?!?!
---
It's true, if the aggressor gets 11 days of guaranteed wartime, there is no reason for them to show up defending the structure. They just put up one for every new war and you are just basicly only increasing the war costs. Make the timer shorter and they have to come fight for it!
---
I like how you've chosen to selectively show only the pieces that help complement your case.
---
As when i follow the timestamps i'm missing a few hours in between at multiple points.
---
But go ahead with these posts, reading on how you go down a viscous spiral into mental instability on how goons are the overlords controlling everything from the shadows is quite a fun read x)
---
Awesome, I would like to offer help. Would it be okay to PM you. Cheers
---

i think goons win that isk war....
---
Not trying to be "that guy" but I did just wrap up shutting down 4/6 of my accounts. No more dealing with SP farming/PI across 17 toons (18th is main PvP and is free from all that nonsense). It feels damn good to be down to paying subs for 2 accounts and focusing on enjoying it rather than making ISK. 
---
Was about to ask for an AT systems only toggle and now I’m sad...
---
I like MM-DD-YYYY format myself
---
Only if you have 300% chance to kill without loss. If they come with pvp ships, dock up.
---
 Ah, the brave hisec wardeccers.
---
Absolutely barbaric
---
&gt; Eve is not cheap for some third world country guys
---
I’m not disputing that, but I can’t really see that as an argument. By that standard most modern games are beyond the reach of most third world people, because they then need at least a computer, steady electricity and reliable internet.
---
If you look at all the places where player events take place, these are by and large in the industrialised world and there the price of EVE is, come on, man, extremely affordable.
---
I’ve said it before: there’s nothing to be ashamed of when you have to say that you can’t afford a subscription, but if that is truly the case, you’ve got much bigger problems than whether you should play an online game or not.
---
On the other hand, I do agree that a need for a second account would, to me, indicate an issue with the design of the place. But then, again, EVE is an outlier. The things people do there, because they are possible, are outside of the norm.
---
Thank you so much for that!
---
That was exactly, precisely, what I needed :-).
---
hey you guys let's use cost as a balancing factor
---
that's literally the scheme they used for wardec isk costs since forever and it never stopped any of these groups
---
Both Abyssal deadspace (mentioned a few times already) and FW/Lowsec are good places to start. That's my only experience, but I do know there are some successful hunters in null sec. In my last alliance we had a few people that spent their time solo roaming in null and catching some sweet kills. 
---
Damn, he really into your heads, eh.
---
wishful thinking on your part
---
I only fap to my 10 VNIs. Mining is boring.
---
i'm pretty sure it's currently discouraged by giving fw pilots standings loss with their faction when engaging other members of ally factions
---
for large enough corps it can be managed but enough standings hits and you get booted from fw
---
Not a bad one, but maybe a bit too much? What about an increase in the cost of asset retrieval?
---
Dies two seconds after this picture was taken

Fuckin mods slippin again
---
For your merlin use 1 med shield extender, an AB and two webs, then swap one of your mag stabs for a damage control. Rigs should be shield extender whatever. 
---
at least xenuria can make a good post every blue moon or so
---
unfortunately you got the economics wrong. as it is not a standard supply/demand relationship.
---
there are 3 possible types of plex buyers (with real money)
---
1. fixed investment aka "i gift myself a gift of 50 dollars": the isk/plex has no effect on these buyers. if the price is low, they might hold the plex for a while but do not spend more dollars
---
2. specific ingame investment aka "i gift myself a titan": the cheaper the titan is, in terms of dollars, the smaller the investment will be. for these types, the high isk/plex price actually hurts the plex influx
---
3. efficiency warrior aka "i can get more if i work instead of farming and spend the dollars into plex". well, this is not really affected by the isk/plex too. simply because you would already get about 4 times the value in isk if you'd be earning in reallife instead. making it 6 times would unlikely change behavior over many players.
---
Currently each ship type selects an FC to anchor on.  
---
The FC will then try and position so they apply as much damage as possible while taking as little as possible.  
---
Tackle can however cause ships to fall behind the FC.  
---
Is that what you're seeing?  
---
What are you simulating when you see bad positioning?  
---
I found in most situations shared anchors were rather bad as often half the ships get awful application.  
---
Having said that it might be worth adding as an option.  
---
You can't export fits from zkill.  
---
You must export from pyfa and they have to be using the EFS format (Edit -&gt; To Clipboard -&gt; EFS -&gt; OK).  
---
Hopefully that should work?  
---
I do have tentative plans to get the AI to change ammo as needed. 
---
I could probably add manual ammo selection then with an option to prevent the AI changing it?  
---
Do you think you'd still find it useful it the AI could pick the best ammo anyway?  
---
If you apply command bursts to a ship in pyfa then export it, the ship will have the bursts applied in EFS.  
---
Outside of that ships with command bursts won't apply them to the rest of the fleet within EFS.  
---
Good point on the naming, you're talking about cases where the ship type and name both match correct? 
---
Olemxa, mate, why you bother? Just do your thing, kidnap more excavs and laugh about it every so often.
---
Stick with that, it works and then just enojoy the goon tears. But this is a bit too much.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Eve) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
Most of my vni losses are pretty suspect.
---
Vnis practically bot themselves anyway just based on how standard game mechanics work.
---
Supers, on the other hand....
---
Maybe where all things are equal.  I think that the FC has a large impact on the battle.
---
Lol it's a random game I found in the Google play store, relax guy.
---
Jesus dude, get a grip
---
Probably due to botting, and goons may have decided enough was enough after that loss to BL. Or maybe that made them pay more attention to the corp? Dunno. Hell, have to say it, well done goons.
---
Sure go ahead, sounds good to me.
---
Nah, just saw a mod pos some shit about rules earlier, but so much falls through. No offense to you, but the "I'll do shit when I feel like it" mentality pisses me off
---
Serious question: What has been done to them? (Was away a few years)
---
It would be best to blend in with them. NPC miners should stick together.
---
cavemen might become powerful and influential mercenaries
---
2 nyx losses in a day, both full crab fit, no cynos, lots of VNI losses... I would love a storytime
---
I’ve spent that a few times. I dont pve or mine, my gaming time is too short and precious. 
---
&gt;They are constantly depleting asteroids I'm mining *making my miners time out* empty
---
Stop botting.
---
News at 11 mods are people and usually dicks. 
---
Downvote brigading and toxic shitting from TAPI and Goons has been a thing for a minute now.
---
Turned out it was a botting ring
---
They do stick together. But it almost sounds like your under the impression NPC miners are actual players. They're bots that do nothing but harass players productivity costing at least 20% of your income. Rats are nowhere near as costly, as rats actually pay for themselves without even slowing down your mining.
---
eh its marginally more annoying for the multi-deccers as hauling in freighters full of fuel gives people something to shoot at instead of Isk vanishing from a wallet. 
---
Now throw in the fuel only comes from high sec mining and you get proper shenanigans going on.
---
Your alt acc? 
---
I guess due to fact that they are defending. 
---
Post a BR or it didn't happen.
---
Nothing but nyx and VNI losses on the killboard.
---
Lol
---
3 if you include the awox. 
---
I am disgusted by this pun. 
---
I was just thinking this, and then I thought no he isn't a goon. He is a goon pet. Literally his entire operation is now financed by goons.
---
You doing God’s work. Bless you.
---
Why don't you just play the game and continue what you're doing, without the Reddit stuff? 
---
What the hell do you mean "stop botting?" I have 1 account. Have you ever even mined? I'm looking directly at my mining lasers, 6 of them outfitted on a Praxis mining rig. If I deplete an asteroid it say asteroid depleted and you can see which mining laser is no longer operating. If you are mining an asteroid and NPC miners deplete it then your mining laser acts like nothing happened and continues mining a none existent asteroid. And even when you know one of your mining laser is mining a none existent asteroid you have to randomly kill your you mining lasers one by one to figure out which mining laser is mining the none existent asteroid. 
---
What makes a VNI loss seem suspect?  Just flying a VNI the way you are supposed to is basically being a slightly slower bot. Neut hits local, tether or dock ASAP. Just like a bot would.   Kill a VNI because it didn't react at all like a broken bot? Well, that's just someone who went afk.
---
I would think it's very easy to mistake both good and retarded VNI pilots for bots.
---
I first requested this 12 years ago. About time.
---
BR was in another topic, i can link it. [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/aviz35/conflict\_between\_fraternity\_and\_russians\_heating/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/aviz35/conflict_between_fraternity_and_russians_heating/)

Olmecagon
---
You wouldn't have to show users it's a log scale, they'll just naturally see that 0-50k goes way slower than 50-100k.  
---
But yeah, mashing in a firm number would work too. 
---
You are a champion.
---
But how you can be ... a goon ....
---
So uncivilised.
---
Man I miss that crazy diamond. 
---
all make sense now....
---
Just to clarify.  
---
That number is already text box.  
---
You can already click/press it and type in a number. 
---
&gt;if you can find some way to stop them just neutral hauling
---
you can't
---
&gt; Now throw in the fuel only comes from high sec mining and you get proper shenanigans going on.
---
what's stopping them from using a high sec athanor as their war hq and mining it with neutral toons
---
Dunno why you're getting downvoted. This is the first time weve seen the UI for it.
---
Yeah but the problem here is that the corp basically ONLY has losses, and many of the times one character will have multiple losses in one day. This, coupled with the fact that they had 3 full crab fit Nyx's with no cyno, ALL the VNI characters look nearly identicalwith 5.0 security status, its pretty easily inferable that it was a ring of botters.
---
Just look at those VNI fits - they are made to be very low SP, all the loses are to real players and no rats, meaning that fit works fine for the rats. Those are probably alpha accounts, don't care much about awesome ticks, just get them started ASAP and run long hours.
---
Why don't you fit a survey scanner or whatever?
---
Eh, I'm happy for them all to be occupied doing their thing while we do ours.
---
Yeah that makes sense
---
I gank for profit, so it is not happening for luls
---
What good is a survey scanner going to do if the asteroid survey shows it has plenty of ore but during the time your mining it NPC miners deplete it? Meanwhile your laser is mining away at a none existent asteroid.
---
What about small construction projects?         
---
I noticed that New Eden is missing 2 installations. 
---
that hurt to read and is factually incorrect on multiple fronts

Snuff were the rivals of SC and EE,

Init and snuff then worked together for everything and  bringing goons to "3rd party"   
---
EE and SC worked together, and NC/PL came down for some fun fights, however that was during Eviction of Tapi/c02 from the north, so they were buzy  
---
EE collapsed due to so many hostiles and drain on all FC's leaders, and corps spread across the map, not in one specific group  
---
Ontop of everything, just like this fight and like all fights in eve  
---
each TZ has its own benifits, and each alliance runs differently in each TZ

Considering how much he brags about his 1.2 billion or w/e ticks, he's more of a krab than the krabs he steals from and kills imo.

/r/fittings might be a better place to ask this.

For melting frigs 2 webs work even better.

Actually i think not - having structure in some more accessible space will make defending it easier as you can easily replenish your ships.      
---
If someone want to kill your structure he will just do it. 
---
It is easy to say that when you live in a good country. I used to live in Romania, where a factory worker of a restaurant worker would get about 350 dollars per month. For those people ratting would be more cost-effective than a job. Bulgaria, the former Yugoslav countries, Russia, Ukraine all have even lower low-paying jobs. Even as a senior software developer in a medium sized town, the subscription cost was relatively high. 
---
Currently living in Western Europe and the subscription cost for an account is usually less than my lunch.
---
Aww, so cute thinking at Brave
---
Nice
---
Salvage drones are suprisingly skill intensive, also need omega status to be able to use em 
---
obviously didn't watch the clip.
---
Have an alt shoot them, and warp off. As long as you don't kill the whole fleets, the standing hits aren't too bad. 
---
So is that the logo for the russian coalition?
---
I'm an Alpha, I don't have an alt. I'm not even allowed an alt. My character only has about 1.3 mil skill points and I can't add any skill points to 1 of the other 2 characters I am allowed without killing training on this character.
---
So a few pointers for you:
---
If you hover over the module on the targeted asteroid you'll see a thin line go to your corresponding module and the module will light up slightly.
---
You can survey scan after each cycle to check how many units/m3 are left and then calculate this on how long it would take your miner to get that amount.
---
Example: if you mine 100m3 per cycle and the next scan shows that there is 75m3 left on the asteroid you can cancel the cycle at a bit over 75% of the cycle-time to deplete the asteroid.
---
I am under the impression that some players are actual NPC miners.
---
I booted them for a few reasons: a couple of retarded (or botting? who knows, their fits were certainly shit) Nyx losses in a single day, repeated broken promises a la "we're totally going to join fleets, promise!" and some seriously suspect cycling of seemingly randomly named characters in and out of corp that were typically not on auth, generating pretty suspicious-looking lossmails in the process.
---
Oh wow this is awesome, I wonder if this will get an update later down the road for formations and tactics (leapfrog and gokus and Boosh ravens come to mind, as they won't just broadside another like the mallers in that gif) also a dscan intigration like PLA has (copy paste results from dscan or a dscan website) to autopoplate the fleets 
---
You're a terrible person.
---
But I am harley 
---
Nonono. This is a YY-MM-DD, it's even fucking worst.
---
Dude these changes look awesome
---
Finally, someone less funny than me that I can laugh at! I at least gave up making memes tho when I realized they weren't funny.
---
Weren't able to run rings 'round Wibla though.
---
I killed a bunch of their vnis Wich showed clear Botting behavior and had to repay the "damages", can I have my money back now? 
---
I am aware of that, but try to use that to find a none existent asteroid, and which of 6 active mining lasers are mining that existent asteroid. 
---
But let's assume none of that is an issue. That still doesn't address the fact that I can go to a perfectly good asteroid belt and by the time I can mine a couple of dozen asteroids the entire freaking asteroid belt is empty!
---
The same type that puts M instead of B with a . Or misses out a 0 when using a ,
---
Thank you for the quick reply. Importing works now for me. I used the EFT setting in pyfa. Are imported fits on the website saved for everyone or only for me?
---
&gt;Currently each ship type selects an FC to anchor on.  
---
Is that what you're seeing? 
---
I was mixing command destroyers with other ships. In most fights command ships would anchor on the main anchor. Logi anchors on logi anchor. Certain support ships would do their own thing. Would be cool if it's possible to define anchors.
---
&gt;I do have tentative plans to get the AI to change ammo as needed. I could probably add manual ammo selection then with an option to prevent the AI changing it?  
---
Do you think you'd still find it useful it the AI could pick the best ammo anyway? 
---
Automatic ammo choice would be very very nice. (Restrict it to ammo in cargo I'd guess.) Manual selection would be less important imho. If the selection is implemented in a not confusing way it can only improve the app though.
---
&gt;If you apply command bursts to a ship in pyfa then export it, the ship will have the bursts applied in EFS.  
---
Outside of that ships with command bursts won't apply them to the rest of the fleet within EFS. 
---
Uff, that's a bit cumbersome. A proper implementation of bursts would be really cool but probably a lot of work.
---
&gt;Good point on the naming, you're talking about cases where the ship type and name both match correct?
---
For the Ferox for example two default fits exist which are both named "Shield 250mm Rail". Just at least call them "Shield 250mm Rail (1)" or so. Makes it easier to check which fit is which if adding those.
---
Now some questions which features are implemented or not. Maybe you could add the answers also to the about. Some of those features would be a lot of work. Mostly it's only interesting to know if it's considered or not.  
---
Do you consider cap properly? Or could I create a fit that only has cap for 10s but fights all the time as if it has cap. Advanced feature would be to properly include cap warfare.  
---
Do you consider targeting ranges? It's not too unusual that ships can hit out further than they can target.  
---
I had some more but forgot.  
---
Some feature requests: Add an abort button. Currently you can put the speed to max and at some time it then aborts.  
---
Give the possibility to save compositions and fight simulations. Making them easy to share would be nice too.
---
And thanks again. This is a very fun tool.
---
Them shoot them yourself (even with a drone on your mining ship), and warp to the next belt before the response fleet arrives. The miners will warp to a safe and start there for quite a while (not sure if they return at all), and the response fleet will warp off after a minute out so and not return. If there is a fleet in the next belt too, repeat. 
---
You should talk to your diplo.
---
That was an execution, not an awox.
---
I guess we're just pretending korea isnt neighbors with the largest communist dictatorship known to man, ok then 
---
Start another character on your account, don't train it, or give it a days worth instead of your main if you need to. Log out and in to switch characters between the peashooter and miner. 
---
Tbh, if you're alpha,  just take your venture into low sec and warp off when you see anybody. Higher isk. Ice is better too if alphas can use the fittings 
---
I will be trying those strategies, but I hoped to get some answers about how the NPC fleet would respond first. I'll be using ships I can afford to lose to experiment. But instead I just got accused of being a bot and a lot of other irrelevant stuff that had nothing to do with any of the questions.
---
exactly. pirat is shit with or withour neutral reppers. nothing really changes, amirite?
---
Mate I was there, fighting against SC/EE, lmao. They batphoned Nancy but she was blue to us. Lots of blueballs in EUTZ (EEs weak tZ but SCs strong TZ), then EE died.

Hah, detorid welcome youヽ(ﾟ︺ﾟ)Hi
---
Sure man, cause China is the spawn of devil in a world consisting of innocent angel domains /s
---
this is the logo of red alliance
---
If that's what it takes I'll be experimenting with that as well. But if I can't actually kill the NPCs, or even if I can, all the same questions still applies. Because I'm more interested in the mining response from the NPCs than I am in the dead NPC.
---
I've also done a fair amount of low-sec mining, exploring, etc. The money in terms of the value of goods look good but by the time you figure in all the prep/diversion time it's not so great. Then you throw in some losses to actual players, with ship, equipment, and implant replacements and the huge chunks of time it takes to travel around collecting at good prices it's mostly a total waste. I'm presently looking at about a 3 mil loss for every hour I spend scanning stuff and/or running from dangers.
---
Not sure what your fit is but if i add 6 miner II to a praxis in pyfa with 3 mining upgrade II (this gets cpu up to 99%) you'd mine 43k an hour.
---
That is not a lot.
---
I'm not sure what the npc mining fleets are using as ships but if they have barges or a boost of some kind then they will greatly outperform you.
---
When i was mining in HS, i used to run an orca max booster and a max miner hulk.
---
Most others would just move out of the belt if they see me coming, i could mine a belt in two/three hauls with the orca which meant i was mining for about 1,5 hours before i had to dock.
---
The others without hauler/booster wouldn't be able to compete. (m3/hour was around 166k m3)
---
Due to the boosts i could mine the entire belt from one spot (had 37km range on lasers)
---
A procurer with two strip miner I and no upgrades would already get more yield per hour and has a larger hold so you could mine longer. (you can carry 10x more than the praxis)
---
So might want to consider it.
---
Risk wise i think a procurer is easier to replace than a praxis should you lose it for some reason. 
---
As a quick check shows that it is about a tenth of the cost of praxis.
---
With that argument noone should speak to people from the country directly responsible of dozens violent dictatorships around the world, whose presidents have commited war crimes one after anorher since they dropped two fucking nukes against civilian targets and that have invaded countless countries for their natural resources. Oh, and noone should speak to Canadians or Mexicans eithet because they border with them.
---
Which of course would be fucking retarded, because blaming people for their goverment's crimes is completely stupid. Just like you.

Just imagine former SC/DOTA korean players micromanaging a squad of bombers each...

The worst in this case it s probably that this nyx wasnt botting. Imagine you get awox because some ppl are botting in your corp and you didnt know about. fuck it lol
---
What do you mean just 1
---
thanks for the heads up. although concerned about the news that PA bought eve in the beginning, i start being more and more convinced that this might give the eve playerbase a revival. i hope to be able to kill koreans in space now soon. i wonder what their tears taste like...
---
wheniaminspace would be proud
---
eve is still an awesome game. the problem will be to explain the pure amount of things you can do in eve and how they work together, creating this social spqce adventure that makes all of us a little more authistic. ;)
---
Idk what it is you are writing, but please share it when you are done!
---
So you're aware of it now but weren't 20 minutes earlier.
---
Clearly this is a troll thread but you just ignore NPC miners. They mine ridiculously slowly and don't cost you anything like 20% of your income.
---
If they're on the roid you're on you just use a survey scanner and short cycle so that you finish the roid off and the NPC doesn't.
---
Anyone who spends 100 mill+ for a mining Praxis is insane, the theoretical gain over a Venture is tiny and cancelled out by the difference in warp speed.
---
Lets pretend this isn't a troll thread even though we know it is, don't mine on an alpha clone then NPC miners aren't a problem.
---
tbh cant imagine that this presentation will be in korean only, most devs dont even speak that language ;)
---
i assume we will know at the same time, usually stuff like this is being used as PR boost from ccp. hype vids and colorful PowerPoints incoming
---
I'm Alpha. I can't use a procurer or any of the barges. I'm maximizing with what I have and setting up to maximize the temporary omega time I can get. And paying for omega is Omega option. The Praxis loses a lot of mining buffs compared to the Venture but the 6 mining laser slots marginally outperforms the 2 on the Venture. And after outfitting the Praxis with cargo expansions I get 7840.4 m^3 cargo capacity to the Ventures 5k.
---
Take that shit to /r/worldnews

Some UK metrics. currently a bil ISK stands at around 9.11 GBP when bought according to rules.

4 x medium coffee's at your chain of choice
---
3 x pints of beer in a southern uk pub

1 x  hours work at the national median wage (worse case on hours -  47 weeks of 40 hours @  28,677 gross thus 22,881 net )

1/8 of a tank of petrol

I’ve done trading alot myself and have thus far been relatively succesful.
---
I started out with 1B and am at over 100B as of now.
---
Station trading takes some time yes, i specialized in a few categories like skillbooks,deadspace modules and reactions(when they were extremely profitable). Try to set your buy range to 1-3 systems (you will find your orders filling much faster).
---
Also, buy from perimeter. The keepstar does have some tax, it is far less than the tax in jita. In the long run this saves you alot of ISK.
---
Also, try to find high margin - low volume mods. The high volume mods are often botted/camped by alot of other players. This might mean you will buy and sell slower, but your high margins make up for this.(obviously dont trade in completely dead modules).
---
Not sure if troll or serious ...
---
Whatever you wanted this post to do, congrats bro. ignore them, and you did it. \\o/
---
That's a disgrace to trash.
---
Stealing =/= Krabbing
---
Well, considering his love for 'excavators'....
---
You won't kill npc miners before the defence fleet arrives, and the defence fleet will kill most solo players. Just fire a couple of spots and warp off. 
---
It’s really a signal to the market in two ways .. the acquisition and merger has or is completing without fiscal disruption. Secondly it’s about how their product lines are going to shape PA in a new future.. with unity of two comes one strong..
---
What will attract my attention is what is said and positioning of eve .. if he panders to expansion packs work mixed with stability is the roadmap then it’s a “business as usual fuck off” play.  Not great for eve but not bad .. just means “we are still working out how the IP salvage process works and futures are up in the air” (eve lives for another 2 years as-is with no end of life discussions)
---
If he goes bold and introduces additional product skus (mobility) then it’s not good for eve, as the new round of hires in ccp in last several months are actually tasked with different problems / culture change. Example they hired a new agile methodology operative which is a sign they are shifting more aggressively towards an iterative / backlog maturity model but is that for eve? Or some other sku?
---
Anyway naval gazing aside we wait I guess 
---
You can check that no single player behaviour or any AI involved, as equal fleetcomps anihilate each other to zero on both sides. Only uses shipstats for calc, and when their are equal everything on each side dies at the ame time.
---
Looking closer at the tax data for that corp, I'm pretty sure that guy was a *very* enthusiastic ratter.
---
&gt; So you're aware of it now but weren't 20 minutes earlier.
---
I never said anything to indicate I wasn't aware of them. Aside from the fact that it;s completely irrelevant when you have empty asteroid belts after mining only a few of the asteroids, those lines go to existing asteroids being mined. But what about actively mining a none existent asteroid? I have 6 mining lasers going spread over a much wider area than my view screen. If I zoom out enough to see it all the asteroids aren't even visible. So even if I do try to use those lines to track down which actually existing asteroid a particular mining laser is mining I have to scroll back and forth in my view screen while zooming in and out to find it. Making it much faster just to kill and restart lasers to figure out which ones are actually mining an existing asteroid.
---
&gt;They mine ridiculously slowly and don't cost you anything like 20% of your income.
---
I'm an Alpha. No mining barges, no strip miners, no mining crystals, a number of mining buff skills unavailable. So when a group of at least 5+ NPC miners gang up, where even one is faster than I am, yes it it extremely costly to me.
---
I just have to wonder who is doing the trolling here? Or are you simply not reading my responses and not aware I'm an Alpha, or what limitations being an Alpha actually imposes?
---
You can be wardecced without a structure in highsec.
---
You cannot wardec someone else without a structure in highsec.

Space Reptile did not include that 100% of an aeon is 55.78% of a Hel

---
Can you repair a war target?
---
If yes, won't hisec wardec groups just keep their out of corp logi permanently wardecced?
---
It changes this one has a good tank fit. But? Cap ratting with neut in local? Dont be pre aligned or warp when neut enter? -&gt; the best way to die like this.
---
Sure you can, add some feature where an active War HQ can only be utilised by characters in the war. The permissions system already exists, enforcing a temporary template for the duration of the war that locks access to only Corps on their side isn't a groundbreaking major re-write of functionality.
---
As for setting an Athanor as a HQ, go for it.. they pop nice and quickly. 
---
Plus I doubt the likes of PIRAT want to run a giant high sec mining operation just to keep large numbers of war decs functioning.
---
I do not care! I only care about how long those buggers stay in hiding and how far the defense fleet will go to chase you down if you go back to mining!
---
Your telling me I should do what I suggested doing without answering any questions I asked about consequences. Seriously!
---
What are you doing exactly? All I ever hear about is INIT getting camped in stations. 
---
ccp has been 'at the expense of the small guy' forever dude.
---
theyre either to thick to realsie what theyre doing before its done, run by goons so hard they control it with ccp realising they do towards thier own benefit. or. maybe ccp doesnt want small groups
---
Is it bad, that I can relate with his observation of the gaming industry?
---
&gt; and had to repay the "damages" 
---
pppfffff HAHAHAHA
---
Wow falcon even made real life threats?
---
^(/s just in case it isn't blatantly obvious.)
---
Ah yes, didn't take into account alpha clones.
---
If you maximized the performance you can get as an alpha there isn't much you can do.
---
And it looks to me that you already put a lot of thought into it and considered multiple options.
---
When i look at the Eve uni article i see the following:
---
 *The mining fleet will sit on an asteroid field. The fleet will be a group of mining ships ranging from ventures, mining barges to exhumers. Periodically a hauler will warp in for a moment and then warp off to a station and dock.* 
---
I'm sorry to say this but you will never outperform an NPC fleet that has barges or exhumers.
---
And since they have a hauling service they will never leave the field thus eliminating downtime on mining.
---
so let me get this straight:
---
if a suspect baiter gets neutral logi reps and is not at war with the victim hes engaged with, his neutral logi will not get concorded?
---
Excavators are free if you steal them yourself.
---
i've played solo for a while (1 acc).
---
i would recommend do Abyss\\Scanning\\small production PVE wise and just quit for another games PVP wise.
---
gl
---
What does REEEEEEEEEEE mean?
---
the other option is just buying the goo from jita, which is much harder to disrupt, especially if they're still financed by bot groups
---
Thanks mate and thankfully for me :)
---
grr gons
---
What other way is there to do it? First heard it in the 90's and it's still ingrained in my mind
---
goon man bad
---
I do from time to time in most of those fights i dont really need to id the guns granted i could have looked at the tristan and seen he was no guns from the start and make the guess he was neats but generally the only ship i will check the guns on is a comet.
---
Gobloons are named after gobbins, not gevlon goblin. 
---
Just for clarification.
---
bye
---
Devilrodent is pretty spot on been doing these for a year plus and there are only so many viable fits for each hull you tend to learn these fits and know how to deal with them after a bit of time.
---
Good :)
---
Tbh with the amount of sites that get ran in delve a salvage bot would not surprise me at all.
---
I feel if you're at the EVE stage that you're 3-boxing you know what you're fitting your toons.
---
Mouse over your mining lasers one at a time, while over one look at the icons under your targeting box. One should change colour slightly, that is the one you are moused over. You can use this to work out which one isn't really mining.
---
The mousing over also works the other way around too. You can mouse over the icon under the targeting box and the icon in the F-keys location will highlight which is which, then manually stop the one which didn't highlight.
---
Does your alliance suffer from high sec war Decs... But your alliance lives in 0.0?  How unfair is this... Make a post today to get empire immunity!! Your csm is with you.
---
Soon, instead of risking ships in combat we'll be able to just simulate fleet actions so no one loses anything! Grudges and territory can be solved with a series of friendly simulations with the 2 sides agreeing to abide by the results. 
---
ITT goons kick their own bot alts then advertise it as a publicity stunt to make people think they're anti bot, then use minor bot funds to replace the small bot wing with another mysterious rental (bot) group.
---
Ten dollar bond joke?
---
Whoops -  I'm at work, multitasking isn't  a strong suit. Not many people go near npc miners, might struggle to get a complete answer. Seen some guy on YouTube with a t3 destroyer do some tests on killing them , think he gives nominal times for spawns etc. 
---
They want nullsec alliances to be war eligible. 
---
Was thinking the same thing.  lol
---
Seems like you should pin shit posts as well since that's what you did for yourself.
---
Canada? 
---
New sansha skins confirmed?
---
Pg nerf and sentry dmg bonus nerfed if I recall correctly.
---
Then they are not out of corp logi and can be killed ;) aka they cannot be left on grid and be used when needed.       
---
For example did you see those 3-4 nestors on the 4-4 stations. They are used when something is going bad and they can rep them-self and have enough EHP to survive weapons timer to dock on time.       
---
They sit in station structure so cannot be bumped ... and each is worth 8-10bil in fitting.

---
If you can see that player ratting 20 hours a day, it's botting or rmting and both are good reasons 
---
Gf
---
I think you misunderstood the tip. 
---
You have six roids locked, with one laser on each, so each has a little laser icon under the locked image. One roof dies, you now have five of these locked roid icons with laser icon underneath.
---
If you hover your mouse over the laser icon underneath one of the locked roid images, the laser it represents in your F-row will light up brighter than the others. You can also do the opposite, and hover your mouse over one of the lasers in your F-row to make the associated icon on the locked icon light up. 
---
So, mouse over the first mining laser like you were going to click-cancel rather than F1-cancel, see if one of the five icons of lasers on the lock-images gets a highlight: if no, click to cancel the laser and start that laser on a new rock; if yes, move to the F2 laser and repeat.
---
It's still irritating, granted, but does save much more time than cancelling all cycles and restarting (or just letting the 'empty' laser finish its cycle).
---
apologies if it came over as condescending... was actually concerned that you were overreaching, but it seems like you did think this through
---
Well before I started winning eve I was in goons. Regardless of affiliation having that much hate for a in game entity isn't healthy. It is still a game at the end of the day.

Kind reminder : **CCPLEASE MAKE THOSE GO TO BELTS NULLSEC MINERS UTILIZE**

How do remote reps apply? And how does the AI determine at what range it wants to fight?

yeah theyre almost no SP and can rake in ~10m/haven, 1 super does 12-15 havens an hour so theres 100m+ to be made from an almost free toon
---
Right, I got that, but when I get wardecced I am required to select a HS structure as my HQ since HQs are not allowed to exist outside of HS. So in this case, how am I going to select an HS HQ when I do not own any HS structures ?

TDR Carmaggeddon had that car
---
As a former wardeccer, I think that lowering the 24h warmup period to 20h would be unfair to the defenders.
---
If your {small highsec group} prime time is idk, 1900-2300, and you get a wardec at 2300, you can't really prepare for it (talk with new players, make memes, fit ships) before it hits 1900 the next day. If the goal is to make being in war more fun for both parties, this somewhat undermines it.
---
Can't we just tweak the citadel mechanics I don't know anything about instead to make it easier to destroy anchoring structures?
---
Once you engage any of the miners, they will start to allign out, and try to warp off. The response fleet is triggered as soon as you engage, and lands on grid around 20 sec later. (Roughly; didn't time it, but it's long enough to kill+loot their hauler before they arrive,  with enough dps) The composition of the fleet varies, but they always have tackle frigates, which will land first. As long as you start to allign to your next location before you start shooting, any ship can escape in time.
---
You should try and be less isolation-metagaming and predatory, pls. 
---
Could probably do with a few more spikes. It's not quite there yet.
---
Buying from Jita is fine, they still have to get it to their HQ to fuel it. Anyone they are war decced with gets a free go at bashing a freighter.
---
Might even encourage the ganking groups to fight each other instead of blue donuting the hell out of it.
---
Back in the old days when subcap still the main power in battles, you dont even need to fly capitals. 
---
I think the green crayons are best, followed by the blue ones. I absolutely don't like the brown ones. What about you op?

Eve central market ? , look at the eve Facebook all the crying because they can’t get their pretty shipments out for 1 whole weekend
---
Simply divine 😊
---
Hey thanks for your answer. I find skillbooks and deadspace modules very good too.
---
About the buy range I am not sure to get it. Is it about buying with lower taxes, like perimeter ? Or to attract more clients that can be in other stations ? So then you need to haul the stuff to jita ? 
---
www.dotlan.net
---
There's a wealth of information on there related to what agents are in a system (if you have mission runners), number of belts (if you have miners), volume of jumps (if you have paranoids that'll prefer somewhere quiet or local-traders that want pass-through traffic), frequency of kills (to see if it's a hotspot for ganking), and services offered in the local NPC stations (you need a clone bay, but indy guys will want manufacturing, miners reprocessing, etc. as a back up if your citadel(s) fail or if you don't want to set them up). It also gives a map so you can check what systems are linked to it and see similar for neighbouring systems.
---
www.eveplanets.com
---
Currently down, but if you have PI guys, they'll want to know what kind of planets they have access to. Couple with Dotlan to check for nearby lowsec systems as they'll probably want to branch out there if they're extracting.
---
http://www.ellatha.com/eve/moonproductslist.asp
---
If you intend to set up moon mining, check if your system is mapped. It's not fully complete, as that would be a mammoth task, but if your systems moons gave been scanned and logged, saves you survey probing to see if any are worth it. Note as well though that most good moons will already be claimed, so you may have to wardec a current resident to take their spot (or look for a fairly empty region based on Dotlan that doesn't show signs of active residents.
---
Most will need double checked in game, but that should get you a list of possibles to scout.
---
&gt; That second part certainly has occurred to me.
---
Can't you introduce a random parameter, such that the simulation is correct 90% of the time but it is incorrect 10% of the time (and 2 rifters kill the dread bomb)?
---
The defender doesn't have an HQ
---
Are you retarded?
---
This has nothing to do with China
---
It's become plenty apparent to me that I'm going to have to do my own experimenting. Setting up for such experiments after reset now. I have absolutely no intentions of fighting them. Just want to slap one in the face to piss them off and run away. Then hope they'll stay hide in their safe spot instead of returning to mining afterwards for the rest of the day. Or at least a few hours.
---
Yeah and USA shares a border with Mexico, what's your point?
---
or they could fly it to the citadel on a neutral freighter pilot then eject from the freighter within tether range of the structure and have a pilot in the wardec'd corp board, dock, and drop the fuel
---
mechanics don't beat clever players, at least in eve
---
Maybe we are just a bunch of edgelords who like the autistic screeching reddit posts tend to produce so eagerly. &gt;D
---
Good Fight
---
Why were you neuting the rat before the Hecate landed? Is this some new elite tactic that I don't understand?
---
I do not want to kill or loot any NPC miner. I want to make them hide out in their safe spot and leave the asteroid belt alone for as long as possible.
---
I was in very early and did not click on a link, I figured out how I ended up here. A long time ago I wanted try out EVE so I subbed to this subreddit but than never did play it. As I am subbed to a LOT of subs it usually does not come up, but this was rising fast so it showed up in my feed.
---
Why do we still debate if Snuff are shit or part of the Imperium? We all know they are.
---
If you’re buying from perimeter and limit your buy range to that station only, people will need to fly to perimeter to receive the “best”
---
Offer. Whilst you also might be offering only 0.01ISK more. Thus people wont bother doing that. To counter this you set your buy range to 1-3 (3 because yes, often you’ll receive some more items). Meaning that you can also buy said item from jita whilst you paid taxes in the perimeter keepstar instead of Jita tax.
---
i wanted to kill the rat. But my light drones didn't do enough damage and i didn't want to waste my ammo on the rat. I have light missiles fitted and they are to weak for a battleship rat i think. The fit is designed to catch and kill interceptors.
---
Looks more like a Scrotus Car from Mad Max
---
is this a fun fact?
---
to bad you have to show up for the second timer for this to actually matter
---
You should quit eve, hit the gym and cancel your phone internet connection for a while. This is not healthy dude.
---
It doesn't matter. Makes no difference whatsoever to what I'm trying to accomplish or ANY question I actually asked. Even if my mining laser shut down immediately when the NPC consumed it the NPCs are still emptying the entire asteroid belt before I can mine but a fraction of it. I don't even want to kill any NPC miner or loot them. I simply want them to run away to their safe spot and leave the asteroid belt alone for as long as possible.
---
Been there, done that. It sucks.

&gt; however, consistent worldwide timezone coverage means au tz tanking aids will be less safe, which might finally, finally mean the vulnerability timer system works the way it should
---
So what your saying is that...fresh blood is good?
---
So if I understand, if I sit in Jita, put a buy order in perimeter with range 3, I will pay Perimeter taxes and people from perimeter and jita will be able to fill my order ? 
---
Depends, do you vni rat 20hrs a day, every day?
---
Do you warp directly into anchored bubbles and then sit at 0ms without reacting at all?
---
If so please report to your nearest ganker, you may be a bot.
---
Bs + logi Vs destro 
---
At least you didn't drop super on him. Fair fight I suppose
---
To counter, as someone who has paid for years of Subs but now is going back to college and is no poor, its really painful to keep playing.
---
I can afford that sub some months but not others. 
---
I think the biggest issue here, is the 7 days timer. Not the anchor time as such.

This actually gives them work. 
---
CorpA wardecs CorpB and nominates a HQ eleventy-billion jumps away from CorpB's base.
---
CorpB cannot swing the manpower or hours of jumping to get to CorpA's HQ to take it out.
---
CorpB hires mercs to go kill the HQ, thus either ending the war, or ensuring CorpA are distracted defending the HQ. Thus the mercs get paid for a structure bash and/or blapping of CorpA trying to defend the HQ. Means they can sit in one system and know where their target will be.
---
a bunch of bugs and issues - you got a test server for that... oh wait even devs don't use that thing...

Yep, those are. Can't tell what region it is cuz the regional number got ice over it, but those are certainly our plates.

I will as soon as I can get my skill points up and get some Omega time training. I still experiment in low-sec a lot with different stuff though.
---
I'm not defending botting here, but that's still not "evidence". Yes it does sound very plausible but that's the equivalent of executing a person because you found him on a crime scene with bloody hands and fingerprints on a blood knife near a victim, turns out he took the knife out and was merely applying pressure to save the victim...
---
I don't like the idea of making the warning period any shorter. 
---
If anything I'd probably just double the initial deployment timer in highsec, that would give up to 24 hours for the citadel to be noticed and its owner wardec'd while still having the war go active before it enters its first repair.

Usualy my fighters don't get more than 10% damage while farming but one time, while my fighters were orbiting, they started dying at one fighter per second rate.
---
Why did this happen as they were moving, not webbed, cruisers and battleships only on field?
---
I don't mean this to be rude, but thems the breaks homie. If you can't afford Omega currently, at least there is Alpha so you can make some ISK and still have some fun until you can afford to unlock Omega.
---
CCP doesn't owe you for more time than you paid for.
---
I aim to have the AI play well with the fleet it's given.  
---
So hopefully given time I'll have it effectively using things like boosh ravens.  
---
Dscan integration would be fairly tricky to do well.  
---
It would have to guess the fits based off zkill and then process them via pyfa.  
---
A BR import would be cool but if the goal is to recreate the battle I think the WebGL game engine would make more sense.  
---
You'd probably also want to remove 90% of the simulation aspect for that type of thing.

Either way thanks for the input, some interesting ideas.

Kind of , the only difference is that you’ll have to dock in the perimeter keepstar in order to put up a buy order there and pay the keepstar taxes. And then you’ll be able to set the buy range to 1 system. Then people will be able to sell you items in jita whilst you put up the order from perimeter.

Simple: Bots sometimes transition between states without checking if said transition was successful. A common example is a bubbletrap. Often times bots will warp into bubbles and sit there completely idle even if they are being attacked. This is because they expected to find themselves inside a POS shield or about to dock to a citadel when exiting warp and the botmaker hasn't implemented the required behaviour to handle them landing in a bubble instead.
---
If you both wardec, you both have eligibility to attack the target, none of this changes that. All it does is mean one of you can't help the other whilst avoiding the risk factor of being a party to the war, which would be an unfair advantage. 
---
You say the suspect timer gives you risk, but being vulnerable at a time of your choosing, and only after you get at least one good cycle in, and only up to 10mins afterwards, is not the same as being a flashy-red-star war target for a week or more. It is an unfair advantage, unless you are actively joining the war, in which case this has no change for you.
---
So either you both have to separately wardec the same target, or join into one alliance, or 'suicide logi'. Accept equal risk if you want equal opportunity.
---
3 bombers with anchorable bubbles in cargo.

You really don't want vigilantes going around killing blues freely and claiming they are botters. That's a drama shitfest waiting to happen.

Btw, do you use evernus ? If yes do you know why I struggle importing recent order history ? I click every import button there is... file, log, api, web...

its eve. baiting is nice. congrats for succeeding. playing unfair with logi etc is also totally ok and common practice.
---
on the other Hand your fit is terrible. even against small frigs. get atleast a heavy neut. get a domi
---
however posting a video about this and boasting on reddit about it...with this terrible module management... is pretty cringe
---
I don't have the numbers of actual subscriptions vs PLEX subcriptions.
---
The aggravating part of all this is the laser ID is completely irrelevant to what I want to accomplish, i.e., making the NPC miners hide in their safe spot and leave the asteroid belt alone for as long as possible. The idea occurred to me yesterday when a random player attacked them and effectively gave me the entire asteroid belt the rest of the day. Even if there was no issue whatsoever with the laser ID I can't mine an empty asteroid belt that the NPCs stripped clean.
---
&gt;You have six roids locked, with one laser on each, so each has a little laser icon under the locked image.
---
When the asteroid has been mined out of existence by an NPC there is no roid locked. Yet the mining laser keeps running as if the roid still existed. So there simply isn't a little laser icon under the locked image because the roid is already gone. Only the mining laser keeps running on the roid that doesn't exist, or show a locked icon for, as if it was still there. So I can't mouse over what doesn't exist to get the laser that's still running as if it did still exist to light up.
---
&gt;You can also do the opposite, and hover your mouse over one of the lasers in your F-row to make the associated icon on the locked icon light up.
---
This still works perfectly for roids that still exist. At least that icon is still there when it's mining a none existent roid. But there is no associated locked roid for it to light up because that roid doesn't even exist anymore. So it can't light up what doesn't exist. 
---
This ONLY happens when you are mining a roid and an NPC, or another player, finishes off that same roid. It doesn't happen when you finish mining the roid yourself. So yes, I understand the advice perfectly. And it is perfectly usable advice when the roids you are mining are finished off by yourself. But when someone else, including an NPC, finishes it off the locked icon, and the laser icon under it, is gone. But the laser is still running as if it still exists.
---
I killed some of those VNIs the past two days. They undock after 2 minutes of a neut leaving system. A bubble trap catches them. What’s more is that this particularl bot decides that pods can rat and undocks those along with the VNI. There is video of it that will be released.

My Raven was equipped with the following:
---
So, with reddit and now this tool... will anyone even bother to login to Tranquility?
---
It may be, that Battleships apply better at longer ranges. Even though the Fighters are moving, the Battleships have a better chance of actually tracking if they are further away. When they'd be orbiting the enemie they are closer to the target and therefore have a higher angular velocity towards he target.  
---
On the other hand, you just might've been unlucky :)   
---
Nah, that's probably actual players that got sick of CCPA's shit.  The bots instantly replace themselves.
---
stealing from bots == krabbing

Who is wormbro?  And who left them?

Loki or neut legion as scout, combat prober, and initial tackle.

2x RR nestors to handle the rest. Ideally it’s 3x nestors though. Some guy wrote an extensive blog that used that setup to great results. He started with legion + 3 domis, then upgraded to navy domis, then eventually nestors. It was Cloaky Bastard iirc - definitely worth the read for both tactics ideas and amusement.

but how will i get off
---
This is a big yikes
---
You're missing the point: if you link 5 of your lasers to the 5 roids remaining by seeing the highlights, the sixth laser is the one you need to stop. It's process of elimination, way better than stopping all lasers and restarting. We've all seen rocks die because someone else mined it out from under us, we know how it works, and that's how you work out which laser is running but with no roid attached. But, if you prefer doing it the inefficient way, that's your call.
---
The NPC miner issue is not one you can fight: they don't cause enough of an inconvenience to anyone for people to have found the info you're looking for: we all just ignore them. What we're trying to point out is that you're not seeing such a drastic drop in profit because the NPCs mine so much, but because you're mining inefficiently, and if you fix that, you will no longer care about the NPCs, too.
---
If a belt is completely mined out by NPCs (never seen it happen), then go to another belt. What's more likely is other players have cleared the belt, or only left a handful of roids, and the NPCs finished it off. Unless you're only looking for or specific roid in a single starter system, you'll find another belt. And yes, jumping to a couple of belts to find one with a decent stock left late in the day is a detriment to your isk/hr, but way less than trying to bait away the NPC fleets. 
---
Sorry if I'm being blunt, but you are costing yourself isk worrying about the wrong thing. The advice you've already had will be of much more benefit than any wacky plan you come up with to try to get around the NPCs.
---
While there are some good things here that should have been fixed years ago this just actually feels very disappointing.

yeah I use that site, it is great !
---
On Hilmar, during the presentation.
---
w/ the dscan you can give the option for it to suggest fits based on what alliance you say they are and then it just pulls the most common one from the Zkill of that alliance for that ship  
---
and common stuff like goku fleets can be a prebaked preset w/ sliders for bomber and command ship count
---
im sorry but uajshdjihasd lastname in his vni incisted on warping back to combat anoms in his pod after i killed his ship,even going so far as to orbit a rock in that anom in his pod till downtime... im pretty sure that hes a bot   
---
I love the optimism on the target priority.  
---
Although sadly I seem to recall you being targeted second not last.  
---
Actually given the fits are completely wrong I'm amazed how close it gets if you use the target priority from the match.  
---
You can't split the groups so Vydra winds up with two gilas instead of a gila and a navy drake but still.
---
Don't remote repair people in Highsec, unless you're in the same corp/alliance, if they're in a fight. Or Concord may get involved.
---
must have violated the don't ask don't tell rule...
---
The one after. 
---
Are we sure Sansha are not just a Australian Mad Max planet gone to space ? 
---
Im just wondering how that happens and how it remains tall
---
So, I just skilled into a Hel.  
---
What is the bare minimum in other skills/fitting/etc that I need to start lowsec ratting in it?
---
The campers in the system i liked to rat in have been smacked several times and haven't killed a single vni. They have in fact lost a T3D and an interceptor doing the camping. They still are doing it.
---
My eyes, it burns!!!
---
I don't know which is worse, the video, the kill, the fit or the author?
---
i never said i have any clue what i am doing. I have almost no clue about pvp and i had so much adrenalin. It took me 20 min to calm down afterwards. I made a lot of mistakes because i couldn't think straigt. Like trying to unlock the rat with untag item and deactivating my missiles which i wanted to overheat.
---
same tbh
---
where am i boasting. I was hoping for advice how to do it better next time. I did a lot of mistakes because i was full of adrenalin and couldn't think straigt. It's a miracle that i managed to warp my logi to me and get me repping on time. I suck at multiboxing during pvp. Well i suck at pvp in generell.
---
&gt;And even when you know one of your mining laser is mining a none existent asteroid you have to randomly kill your mining lasers one by one to figure out which mining laser is mining the none existent asteroid.
---
If you know your enemy will drop supers then only engage with the appropriate force. Otherwise the engagement makes no sense imo.
---
I actually go into wormholes as a fairly regular activity i just don't live there. Exploring wormhole chains is quite interesting.
---
But so far i have been actively discouraged to try moving into wormhole space by wormholers they are pretty unpleasant to be around so far.
---
The problem is capitalism.
---
doesn't this apply to all of eve? I mean everyone is extremely risk averse and most people only engage in a fight if they think they can win or am i wrong?
---
r/eve in a nutshell
---
Yes, a process of elimination works. Or just hitting F1 through 6 and resetting them. But that's only a small fraction of the cost. It's still asteroids belts getting stripped clean before I can mine very many of them that is costing most of the money.
---
&gt;What we're trying to point out is that you're not seeing such a drastic drop in profit because the NPCs mine so much, but because you're mining inefficiently, and if you fix that, you will no longer care about the NPCs, too.
---
The fix for that is Omega, which is not an option for me in the near future. Is 3 million an hour really inefficient for an Alpha? Let's look at what that entails. No mining barges, no strip miners, no mining crystals, limited mining skills available. My Mining laser II each puts out 224 m^2 of ore every 60 secs with maxed out alpha skills. I could get that up over 500 with a Venture but then I would only have 2 mining lasers instead of 6 and less cargo space.
---
So either you haven't paid enough attention to know I'm stuck with Alpha, don't understand the limits that entails, or just plain wrong.
---
224
---
Are you planning a mobile version for this, so I can do my PvP why sitting on a train for example ?
---
People like to pretend like they aren't risk averse even if they actually are.
---
Yeah 7 days to kill the HQ and end the war is a bit steep, especially when there is nothing you can do to expedite it. Wish they'd gone with the flex structure approach.
---
Can be also this
---
Make the initial anchoring timer longer, 1h instead of 15 minutes. Or longer if you dont have SOV, would also help fixing the raitaru spam "for fun" in enemy space.
---
Aawh, show me on this puppet where the bad gewns touched you
---
Tbh multiple timers.     
---
More than once we looked who can wardec something asap as someone just dropped citadel on 1 man corp }:&gt;
---
Someone proposed increasing anchor timer for citadels  in higsec - it can be also this. 
---
much wow!
---
It's not only wars, but also limited engagement timer according to the article - meaning you might not be able to suspect bait people (mission runners mostly) by using neutral logi anymore.
---
At least they can now rat instead of using bot Nyxes. 
---
You can have a fleet of unlimited accounts flying at the same time, provided they are all omega clones
---
Only if both accounts are Omega, then having multiple instances open at once is possible. Though not two characters on one account. 
---
No Join Jove Empire and become a drifter...
---
Objectively incorrect on the development use point, and not having a test or pre-production or whatever environment would be incredibly rare, that doesn't really even register on the list of things influencing this.
---
Lol ;D 
---
What a weeb...INIT:WE EVICTED HK FROM THEIR WH WOOOO
---
yet 50% of that fight had goons in it...
---
Yes. CCP guys heard that we like AFK ratting, so now we can rat while we rat, isn't it perfect? :)
---
A minor issue:
---
This is admittedly very niche and the overall changes are great, but as someone in FW who has also done high sec warring at the same time there's a mild problem with the HQ system.
---
If an opponent puts their HQ in the opposing Faction's high sec they will get the benefit of FW polixe aiding them, which in high security systems can be potent.
---
This basically means that FW corps cannot really participate in high sec warring.

ah so you can multi box as many accounts as you want to pay for.  Flying two ships at the same time would be loads of fun, but £20 fun......? hummmmm........I might be too cheap.
---
Thanks for the replies. 
---
What's the next pokemon to be found?
---
Uh Jay...they do give a citadel service module fuel reduction. Go gun a citadel and do a show info on one of the fitted service modules. Look at the fuel usage stats. Compare to that of what’s on the market. 
---
Are you Gandhi?
---
It depends how far you want to skill train a given character/account.  A lot of characters are very specialized so you don't need to train them past a certain point.  When you reach that milestone, you simply starting extracting the SP and selling it for PLEX.  In effect, what you have is an omega account that doesn't train any SP and functionally doesn't cost any money (though this fluctuates with the price of skill extractors, skill injectors and PLEX),
---
Should check out cloakybastard.blogspot.com, this dude has crazy stories about roaming wspace alone with a few accounts, it's old so a lot of shit has changed but its a fun read and the shenanigans might give you some ideas to generate content.
---
There is another old blog that has some good solo wh stories but I can't recall the name, I'll post if I remember.
---
I’m not -really- interested in ‘the best’, because that’s a conversation you’ll be having until the sun turns cold. I wanted a unit that was considered elite and Mordu will do for the purpose.
---
It is an EVE-themed space opera *shhhhh* keep it quiet.
---
Just because you don’t enjoy a good pod orbit doesn’t mean he’s a bot its a totally legitimate way to play the game...........if you’re a bot 
---
And just how much efficiency do you think that cost me? It's not even that often that that particular issue happens, it's just one of the issues in a list and the least among them. Even completely ignoring the fact it addresses none of my questions and pales in comparison to the cost of an empty asteroid field.
---
224 m^2 ore per 60 secs times 6. Do the math. Even if there were no NPC, zero hauling time, and infinite ore in every asteroid I'm still not going to do much better than I'm doing when the ore is still available. I get maybe an extra 3 minutes out of every 20 minutes. Except when the asteroid belts are empty.
---
Okay i just finished with your text and now going for the comments.
---
i gladly tell you that you have my support. Even when i aswell be part of a powerblock alliance. When i would be in gsf i also would not just take what you type too serious but at least would open another eye and look a bit more on the events that are within my weight and start from there to prove or unprove your point. 
---
So that not everybody does the same i can only tell you, that you shouldnt give much about those behavior dudes which just smear you without having a propper evidence over the thing itself. We cant even prove that they are telling the truth when they write "iam in this possition and you are clearly wrong".
---
What i can tell you from my point of view is that i take you serious and have my own  experiance with the toxic behavior from some guys in gsf. Ofc some of those who have a gsf flair arn't realy goons and i even might push some people on the wrong site cause of this. 
---
But what i have seen and learned in eve is, that mostly people from gsf get massivly toxic towards you when they dont like you. See as example Lady Scarlet... whenever she appears in a conversation the chat or thread is full of jokes about her weigh and shit. Also the beep beep iam a jeep jokes which occur when the things about red lines come up along as the good old wizzard hat incedent. the Streamer which got harrased by them in her stream about her dead grandfather and the list goes on. I mean iam sure every powerblock including NC. ofc have their special snowflakes who are not the shiniest stars in heaven and simply dont understand the full strengh about their attitude. 
---
I for one have no Problem in fucking someone over in this game like stabbing his titan or rip him of. Anything else above like aiming to destroy someone in RL for whatever reason is just toxic and dont belongs to a computer game...
---
I mean contacting someonce employer and your mentioned doxxing and so on are realy evil and should result with a temp ban for lets say 30 days at first and when another thing comes up a permanent ban.
---
Posted the same somewhere in 'here'
---
So this is how "elite hisec pevepee" will end up with hisec mining, lol? I want to see it!
---
This! I've had previous experiences with new players who bought MCT's in the belief that they would be able to use multiple characters on one account simultaneously. Be wary!
---
Make sure you train the other "active" character on a different account, you can let it run on alpha until it hits the SP cap.
---
You're thinking of meowtiger.
---
Stain bless**
---
Botting is not forbidden in China. 
---
Exactly this. 
---
ah nice - you can get to a point where your Omega character pays for itself, then you can start your other one. Thanks, I shall keep this in mind.
---
This isn't an isk sink. No isk was removed from the game; in fact isk was ADDED to the game via insurance (albeit a very small amount).
---
He does live in Delve, and makes his living using Excavators...
---
::thonking::
---
he got a point there. You asked him for an example and he gave you one. And again you do not respond to his example and asking a question back. 
---
This is not how this work. You for normal dont awnser a question by asking another question btw....
---
Congratulations in turning Eve into a top down RTS... incoming check from BDO
---
ISK is removed from the game whenever someone buys a BPO. They canonly be purchased from NPC vendors which are 100% ISK sinks.
---
Whenever a BPO is destroyed, its one less BPO in the game, so in a way increasing the demand since the owner now possibly has to go out and buy another one. Might not be a brand new one, but from someone.
---
More BPO's are destroyed, the larger the demand potentially becomes.
---
OP must be a troll. People are giving great information and every reply OP comes back yelling and whining about the info he gets. Stop mining in high sec in a Praxis for the love of god. Maybe just quit EVE. The advice people are giving you is solid and if you don’t wanna hear it then you’re just playing the wrong game. The game isn’t going to change for you. 
---
Oh my god, yes!
---
Also where are you mining? It helps us to know that so we can give you better advice...
---
Don’t join the dust discord it’s toxic and they like to post soft core child porn there. I’m not joking. 
---
You want to give to all Pirat/Marmite/Gankers/Goons the ability to control hight sec, wardeck and destroy everything before its anchored. That mean, cancelling for all pilot the dream to create a safe Home.
---
I dont stand for it.
---
High-Sec must be safe for new players. Even if you dont like it, because it's healthy for the game and the economy.
---
Mods can you please crack down on these “cute newbie” whoring posts? There’s one every day. Can’t new players search? There’s literally hundreds of posts and articles that noobs can reference. This is pure low-effort shitposting. 
---
hahaha
---
O_o, you have got to be kidding me!
---
I would file a report right away. Child porn is simply unacceptable. Children cannot be victimised for any rationale.
---
I’m not going to go there because I can feel my blood already starting to boil and I’m not sure what I’d be saying there but it would not be friendly.
---
/deeply disappointed that people involved in Dust514/EVE would do something so vile :-(.
---
Thank you for the head’s up. 
---
yes
---
We moved to G-0 for the first time after we lost Ibiza to the Russians after Atlas fell. This was way back in 2010, so almost a decade of rust that I would have to clean out if I resubbed.
---
Every single fit shared here is completely-untested dog shit that Carebears dreamed up in pyfa. PM me if you want some real combat mining techniques and fits. Also you can absolutely mine in lowsec. Ignore these Carebears froobs with their milquetoast attitudes. 
---
i am going to

  As an Alliance we aren't afraid to try things and have them fail, usually things work out pretty well like Stukas or Boosh Ravens
---
And that's what made INIT so much fun, always something new. Hi Dark, I'm not dead btw.
---
I think its not updated anymore, and they changed they way the api worked a while ago so evernus is pretty much dead.
---
Gotcha! I assumed titan blueprints were a drop from something, I've never looked into them. 
---
Apologies then, and I definitely agree!
---
I agree. Make it 15 minutes times active indexes in hostile sov space.
---
I know what you might be thinking, "this is just going to ha K my account" but it's ok, it's safe, I joined brave for a while when I was newer (still fairly new) and they are very helpful, whernt my cup of tea as I prefer a smaller more personal corp but they will get you up to speed with what you need to learn o7 safe flying bud
---
You could try to stop being a rude dick to the people trying to help you on this subreddit. Good luck working it out on your own, or do us and yourself a favour and just quit the game.
---
I don't know how/why you managed to put in there gankers and goons ... but it is mostly about fact that if someone is unable to defend citadel on the first timer - he will not be able to do it on final.    
---
um, no.
---
9 years and you still can’t fly your spaceship in a straight line? Stop being a solo pilot and get into a player organization ASAP. 
---
You Slav, you lose?
---
Very cool tool!
---
It does get some interesting results when pitching 10 rail Enyos vs 10 blaster Enyos - invulnerability level - achieved! :)
---
&gt;I hope Goons internally talk and make these kind of practices a thing of the past, similar to what happened to doxxing.
---
You only started getting those Elysium logs this week, didn't you?
---
Not sure if bait, or cocky ass newbro. 
---
All these guys giving you advice and you keep shrugging it off. Why fucking ask in the first God damned place if you already k ow it all? Figure it the fuck out for yourself.
---
it's almost like you were the ones that literally chose to attack the large structure in the first place hmmmmmm, truly a 400iq play

I ALSO ENJOY A GOOD STELLAR ROCK ORBIT IN MY OVOID SLEEPING CHAMBER

ok, so lets say i decide to recreate the exact same behavior - get some VNIs on a bunch of alts, undock, wait until i get blapped, then rat again, or warp to sites in pods? am i a bot? can you prove i am or am not a bot?
---
an attempt was made
---
That's why it's a prototype duh
---
Start gambling on sports. With money you can’t loose, that’s a rush that’s hard to replace.

Why would you take the time to post a vid of a bs+logi killing a destroyer?
---
Or you know. Within at most x jumps of an opponents structure 
---
cry more
---
ok
---
Actually he has a point.
---
Whether it pays for itself depends on the prices of PLEX, injectors and extractors. Currently I think if hovers around barely paying but off course having to pay ~100 mil/month for an extra account is a lot better than paying the full price of PLEX.
---
Man I wish I got dank ticks like VNI bots, I only get 140m or so after 3 hours of ratting, barely enough to plex 
---
many more experienced alliances have most members flying 2 to 3 accounts at a time on the regular. Once you get a hang of the controls, it is easy to swap between clients and give simple orders (outside of tense combat situations). Huge bonus if you happen to have two screens.
---
That's just olmecca, and he just credit cards another boosher
---
Slippery, versatile, covers your bases.

Or one of the buzzards

&gt;.
---
What the actual fuck.
---
I mean what is eve without shitty elitism
---
gf ruskies! now let's just hope everyone else leave us alone...
---
Or a full week, like in nullsec where you don't own the sov. Cause in highsec, you're not the sov owner either.
---
Nah its Mittens
---
And it wasn't rude to call me a bot? It wasn't rude to ignore the fact that I already made it clear I understood the mechanics of what was being advised? It wasn't rude to answer a question about the consequences of X by either saying I should do X or I should understand about the man on the moon having nothing to do with X, much less the consequences of X? 
---
I asked about how NPC miners would react to being harassed, if or how long they would stay in their safe spot. Yet not a single comment has had anything to do with what I asked. And me attempting to steer the conversation back to what I asked makes me the asshole.
---
Looked like a great brawl.
---
2GTHR? Is still around? Even bringing a couple of titans
---
I do not need nor did I ask for advice about mining. I asked how the NPC miners would respond to being harassed. So why is everybody insisting I asked for something I didn't ask for, and completely ignoring my question?
---
Drone lands.
---
I haven't been on the DUST 514 discord but I'm gunna put it out there that 90% I see someone throw out the 'softcore child porn' accusation, what they're usually referring to are ecchi images of anime girls that aren't explicitly 25+ years old ('ecchi' meaning suggestive but not explicitly pornographic, like girls in bikinis n' stuff). I *highly* doubt people on the Discord are posting images of actual children.
---
Get subbed.
---
Lol no
---
Yeah, you can do two, or more if you like

The fact that he's not in here writing 6000 word essays means one of two things: either he's banned, or he's in jail. 
---
It's a video game, my dude.  Not a court of law.  Grrr goons really does cloud peoples' ability for rational thought on this sub.
---
I nominate this one for the worst Eve pvp video of 2019.
---
It has everything. Battleship vs a destroyer. Logi support vs a solo duder. Clicking modules like a monkey. Neuting the npc. Neuting the npc while fighting the Hecate. Randomly turning off your dps modules. Trying to click the mjd (while scrammed and winning the one sided fight) for some weird reason.
---
I dont think eve was ever renowned as being a tournament based game. The vast majority of players dont care about AT.
---
You make a great point.
---
It's not necessarily that Olmeca needs to stay away from Reddit.
---
Just stop trying to be opinionated.  Leave opinion out of it, unless you're talking about a game mechanic.
---
Otherwise, you're just using your bias to call out someone else's bias - that's never going to work.
---
To me, it sounds like he's too worried about being the plucky hero against the big bad tyrants.  All while forgetting it's a fucking game.  That's just pure narcissism.  
---
(not a goon, by the way.  Red to goons, actually)
---
could get rid of the 3 free days of fuel.
---
and make it so they need to fuel it or it starts in low power.
---
or make it so dmg cap is lower outside of sov you don't own
---
Bring the tear harvesters
---
You want some cheese to go with all your whining? If it is so important to you, get Omega and use a real mining ship out of high sec.
---
Hell you could just get an alpha to gank the npc hauler. Then you can use another alpha to loot the wreck for all the ore in it.
---
plottwist: he's stealing them from his own miners.
---
Yes, a lot of it was good advice. So why can't I say sure, I know that, but that wasn't my question. But trying to steer the conversation back to the question makes me a troll? I asked about the response of NPC miners to being harassed. Nobody has even mentioned the NPC miners once. That's like asking for a ride somewhere and being told bus prices and then accused of being a troll when you try to explain that's not really relevant.
---
Only on a comment of mine can two guys start name calling each other about fucking Turkish politics. 
---
Here, show me on this Orca where they touched you. 
---
Why has not a single response had anything whatsoever to do with the question I asked. I asked what the response of NPC miners would be to being harassed, and how long they would stay hidden in their safe spot. Instead everybody gives advice that presumes I'm an idiot, and that makes me cocky? Well then so be it.
---
All over!!! It was horrible. He said he had free crok too.
---
Yes
---
wait you needed logi? my shitfit event grind rattlesnake chews up t3's and assfrigs... this is just sad
---
And how is someone with zero income going to buy Omega? Again, perfectly good advice, just irrelevant. 
---
[removed]
---
Most of the game is played on discord anyways
---
At the end of the day it doesn't in this case. Not joining fleets and shit fit supers dying all over are not acceptable. That they *may be* botting is just icing on the cake.
---
With what? I haven't had an income since 2005.
---
I think he has me blocked or muted.
---
Most of the game is played on ~~discord~~ reddit anyways
---
And we are talking about higsec ....
---
Blood for the Blood God
---
No they dont., but its in their best interest to do so.
---
If i have to takes months off then theres less chance im gonna resub in the future when i can afford it. 
---
&gt;You cannot have it both ways: you can’t expect a **fantastic universe** like that to do in as you please 
---
You cant possibly be serious.
---
What has happened is that the "plex market" is no longer balanced. It appears there is a higher demand than supply (mostly because of bots and injectors). If this continues, at some point plex will basically run out and that is going to hurt the game.
---
PI/Industry easily doable with a few hours a week, depends on the industry type but the most time consuming part will either be hauling ore/minerals from/to reprocessing facility or setting up massive number of jobs, still easily fits withing an hour or 2 a week, sometimes even less, especially when you have longer queues running...
---
No. They bitch about bots and injectors messing up the balance of plex and at the same time breaking the game.
---
&gt;	CCP doesn’t owe you more time than you paid for
---
&gt;	No they dont., but its in their best interest to do so.
---
They literally offer the game ti play for free. 
---
1. I was having issues fitting a medium on that ship; for some reason, despite having the same shield boost as 2 smalls, the medium just wouldn't go in even after I took out both smalls (the medium uses more than double the PG and probably also more than twice the CPU of two smalls, even though it gives a shield boost identical to two smalls). I may have to play with rigs/prop to get this to work.
---
2. Noted. I only had the cap battery on the corm because I thought maybe neuting was a thing.
---
3. Also noted. I hadn't seriously considered plugging gaps in resistances, but the anti-whatever rigs are easy to fit, so I expect to be doing a lot of that.
---
4. That's the second time I've been told in this thread that cap stability in PvP is not a concern, so that's definitely something I'm going to consider (as posted the Merlin fit is naturally cap stable, but I guess I shouldn't be concerned when I take out one of the shield extenders for an invuln or a web).
---
Thanks for the tips, btw
---
ahahahahaha ok sure right whatever
---
I dont know about that particular frig, but I would say the inflation is almost negligible. There is an oversupply of a lot of items keeping the prices down.
---
&gt;even bought omega because I believe in investing in my games
---
run before it's too late. forget that wasted X number of $$$ and R U N!
---
no one will engage If they are sure to die without kill anyone.
---
Cowards will engage only if they are sure they risk nothing (unmbrela, HS war etc)
---
betweene this two situation, it's just regular PwePwe
---
hahahaha
---
This makes me uncomfortable for some readon.
---
Hes a regurgitator. Just ignore.
---
I've given up trying to get sites like that to be useful. I just use Google sheets and keep good records 
---
That would be a good nuance.
---
I’m not against porn or certain suggestive images, especially not when they’re drawn. Then it’s at worst poor taste of a sick mind. If it’s just drawing anime [as opposed to life-like pictures of actual children, which people could do], that’s just -an- art expression, I would not be particularly bothered by that. Anything that does not end up victimising actual children *shrug*. I’m not the thought police.
---
If youre actually serious about this. Use rapid heavy missile launchers and fit for application. You will still easily kill nearly every frig/inty/dessie and can even go after some cruisers.
---
Youll kill them so fast you wont even need logi.
---
yeah, had tried world of warships for a while some years ago, learned how to play the "ambush" destroyer, then got into a game where i was the only destroyer ship. so, i set myself up for ambushing as i usually did, and ppl started shooting at me and yelling at me to go scout (which i didn't have a clue about how to do sensibly), and then asked everyone to report me. lost interest in the game rapidly at that point.
---
"Pvpish" rat AI is possible without going too deep into very complex computations - but main way to approach it would be to have one "AI engine state" for entire group of rats, more similar to how RTS AI works than having rats work independently. You can even manually code certain actions like focusing fire, ewar screening etc. - which for pve would do a lot to make it much more challenging (while allowing to drop in huge swarms of NPCs with much less impact than having per-ship AI) and decently simulate the fact players are able to communicate and coordinate.
---
Eve is like an abusive boyfriend. You keep getting the crap kicked out of you, but you stay because the good parts are so much better than anything you've ever experienced. Then after a while, you say man, being disappointed 99% of the time is too high of a price to pay, so you win Eve for a couple years. Then Eve calls you and all you can remember are all the good times, so you start all over again.
---
I did, but I didn't start a production run of Merlins just for the sake of PvP practice - I was going to sell off about half of them at a newb station (they're relatively inexpensive to produce once the BPO is mostly researched) and split the remainder among the toons with whom I'll be doing the PvP.
---
Yes. I do and I pay for my sub.  
---
Being in a nullsec alliance with good organisation of content and communication really helps. I can log in either to make ISK if needed, or I log in to a fleet that is planned via the forums/discord, or perhaps just roam around on my own looking for fights.  
---
Worth it if you enjoy the game, which is totally subjective if you find it fun to play. :)
---
I see, thanks. Why has this change been made? Was it solving a problem of some sort? 
---
Fuck me, imagine being at this level of nuts!
---
I just red somewhere that we are so used to calling intelligent people stupid that we easily forget they really exist.
---
nice i got a award
---
for more views
---
thanks for the advice. I will try that.
---
Eve has a lot of outlets for filthy casuals as long as you ignore all the bittervets telling you you're playing wrong.
---
sorry
---
We dont "presume" you're an idiot, you just keep having idiotic connotations.
---
Neutral logi in highsec fights have been complained about for \_years\_. 
---
You have some ~~cowards~~ leet pvpers who run around dueling or wardeccing, but only with out of corp logi and boosters. 'solo pvp'. 
---
for your information my heart was pumping like i was chased by a hungry lion. So it was a little bit hard to do the right things in the right order or even realise stuff.
---
buy plex and sell after a month for insane profits
---
!remindme when this guy is done and publishing
---
None, because ratting in a hel in lowsec is gonna be a super quick death for you. Try a nid doing level 5 missions if you want to rat in lowsec.
---
If you skill injected into a hel as a new player you've made a mistake. Not a large one since you'll eventually use those skills, but you're gonna have a bad time if you just straight up bought your way into the largest ship without learning the ins and outs of the game.
---
&gt;Only if both accounts are Omega,
---
Lol, so naive. This is one of the reasons I quit the game. 
---
Stalin plates
---
Now tell me, how do you expect to get a low-sec gate out of this one?
---
But thanks for your work \^.\^
---
We came in and out 6 or 7 times to catch them all. Each time, they undocked at exactly 2 minutes, pods and all. Whats more, the system we left to also had this same bot, on the 2 minute timer, same corp.
---
Why would you undock your pods and VNIs at exactly 2 minutes after neuts leaving and warp to sites multiple times? If you seriously think thats rational human behavior, I don't know what to tell you.
---
it doesn't matter what the actual numbers are. 20 is a bigger number than 15, ergo they make more money for every plex they sell than if they sold the same person a sub.
---
Yes absolutely as others have said. A lot of higher skill PVP groups rely on most or all members doing this.
---
He probably does actually use a goon alt to sell back excavators that he's stolen.
---
While I agree that SeaOf... is next level ignorant Mexico is a bad example. They got their own problems, but they are infact a democracy. I had to inform myself on the topic of Mexico a few years back because I was representing them in Model United Nations and they really dont deserve the shit they are getting. Crime is as inernationalised as trade is these days and american banks play a huge role in it out of reach of the mexican government biting on bricks when they ask for US support. They give a shit ton of money away to poorer countries despite receiving some themselves (they are net negative) and their positioning in international affairs is leaning conservative but openminded - all in all quite decent. It was really fun representing them. Thats about 5 years back, dont know how it may or may not have changed. Anyway, thanks for reading and have a nice day.
---
I should have known better than to even ask. I've never seen anybody ask any question about eve anywhere on the internet without getting the same abuse and troll accusations.
---
BUT
---
DO
---
YOU
---
HAVE 
---
PROOF
---
&gt; I'd point that one firmly at the lack of player content this winter rather than anything CCP is doing.
---
I wonder what the major contributing factor to the lack of player content is
---
Go to the "no question is stupid" thread and ask. Maybe someone there will have pity on you and go do it for you.
---
Just started playing. Fully kitted out a venture and have a few million isk.. what now? Just keep mining and making fat stacks? It doesnt look like I can get a larger miner without paying for omega time. Have I exhausted this gameplay loop as a F2P pleb?
---
The real value of trading is not in buying low selling high in one station, it's providing added value.
---
Best thing to do is buy low and sell much higher somewhere else. Then you provide a lot more added value and can have much better margins. It does require more effort though. 
---
I’m in a null sec clan and am about to be deployed, what should I expect?
---
Is there a Skill List that is sort of deemed mandatory for new pilots to Skill in to? I thought I recall seeing something like the "magic 12" or "mandatory set". Looking for something covers all the bases and gives me a solid foundation to move forward with. Thanks in advance.
---
The chinese government pretty much is but I dont get what Korea has to do with it. 
---
The Magic 14. List is right here [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/The\_Magic\_14](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/The_Magic_14). Great support skills and puts you in a good spot to move on into higher end skills
---
I am a salt psychic and I will attempt to call out and channel Ol'yecca
---
Grrrrrrr goons
---
It has to happen. There are so many ideas in there that I believe will appeal to the capsuleer community, and I’m so far in already, I want to complete it this year.
---
This is awesome!
---
"My coalition is detrimental to good fights and the game in general but I congratulate you on your fun and express my happiness that the goon overlords did not order us to interfere" 
---
- I think goons have the most interest to control high sec for keeping the trading monopoly at the best. Gankers...i don't know, its also goons.
---
- What you mean is you can anchor a structure only if you can defend it.... mmmh something is wrong here. Anyone can defend any structure, and Eve stories are here to remind us. HighSec souldnt be Null or Whspace.
---
If players that are paying the subscription leave, it doesn't affect the plex prices at all, but CCP is losing money.
---
It's not a shitpost. CCP dropped the ball not at least tweaking war dec mechanics 5+ years ago.
---
The point isn't that Eve is known for AT. The point is that CCP took an important community event for the most active players in the game and ignored it last year, then outright cancelled it this year.  
---
Think back to when PA acquired CCP, one of the first things that happened on this sub was the sharing of horror stories about PA. Some current players of their games came over, other /r/Eve people went digging and found all the negative things they could find to shit post about here.  
---
So how do you think introducing Hilmar to Korean players after axing a competitive event like the AT is going to play with their gaming community?
---
1) Please, they are corporations/corps, not clans
---
2) Deployments involve moving your base of operations temporarily to a new location with the intent of targeting another group for PvP. Depending on what your leadership is planning this can involve shooting structures and attempting to totally remove the hostiles from their space or could simply be a harassment campaign to get some fun fights. I would suggest asking older members of your corporation as they would know more about the specifics of your deployment.
---
I'm probably months or even years from being able to do it but nice to know its there. A good goal to have :) 
---
You see, when you fight frigs, you also have to fit frigate tank modules.
---
hahaha you'll mine the universe dry
---
Agreed.  Resource scarcity drives conflict.  We need more conflict.  Any changes, such as longer respawn timers or depletion mechanisms would be a boon to null sov wars.  
---
z
---
I best order that 2nd brain now then. 
---
Are you suggesting that asking how NPC miners will respond after being harassed is a stupid question? Are you suggesting that a single response, bar one, had anything to do with NPC miners? And that one was merely an admission of no answer. Are you suggesting that the first response wasn't simply to accuse me of being a bot, and the second to accuse me of being a troll? Yes, I'm indignant. Because somehow I'm supposed to be appreciative of the abuse.
---
Trash at least was once something useful. 
---
In which i can't fly any of my ships, or do the majority of the things i do in the game.
---
Alphas great for new players or maybe alts but not exactlyg a good stand in for people with 100 mill SP
---
beautiful work! thanks for open-sourcing it!
---
Ok, now try to invite them back when the changes land in April.
---
Or fucking proactive and figure it out yourself. If you cant think for yourself in eve, might as well uninstall 
---
And hope the target doesn't notice he isn't tackled?
---
That *does* actually work sometimes...
---
Yea I find it works 75% of the time, at least. 
---
Prolly got stuck on a gate
---
Fair enough then. I'll still argue that outside of a war it doesn't really matter one way or another.
---
Thanks!
---
Also. It was, infact, a stupid question.
---
Eve is not life changing money for most.  If you get a few hrs a week of enjoyment from it just do it.  Depending on the Corp you are in there are lots of activities that you can just pop on for and mess around with for an hr or two.  
---
Can we also make it so low-powered citadels don't have a reinforcement timer in low &amp; highsec?
---
Tell me how much neutral Logistics you needed for your "PvP" ?
---
Well yes, the plans have already been set and I'm waiting on the NPCs to set it in motion. I just thought maybe some feedback might save me some trouble. 
---
they were those brothers that played terrible music for tween girls and had a whale of a time.
---
In what way? If I can make the NPC miners disappear for any significant period of time it'll pay for itself handsomely. 
---
One of the reasons I voted for you (1 voice) although you made me salty more than one time since that. Good to see good stuff being done.
---
*upvotes &amp; tips fedora
---
&gt;So changing little things will screw them up
---
***Briefly.***  Then the bot will be adapted.
---
That's the point you keep skipping over.  Your changes only hurt today's bots.  And each of your changes is trivial to overcome in the next version of the bot.
---
Versions of bots come out waaaaaaaaaaaay faster than versions of EVE.
---
You shut them down for a day.  A week at best.  And then they're back.  Meanwhile, you lost a month or two of dev time on design, implementation and testing of your change.
---
Mod me and I’ll ban him, then say I abused my power and unmod me but don’t unban him.
---
Glad you admit you are a fucking retard when it comes to FC'ing
---
&gt; e.g. make rats randomly warp to a "perch" out of range when they are taking damage then ratters will have to add a point to their ratting fit if they want to be efficient.
---
And bots couldn't fit a point because.........?
---
Shit, dude... is the world going to go through a massive shortage in Tinfoil? By the way, we know you are on goon coms on a nightly basis, so you should know that you are correct--we do talk about you!
---
Mostly we make fun of you, the terrible fitted people you kill, and how salty you are. 
---
Finally, I can only speak for myself, but I am 99.9999% positive that you and Mar5y are the exact same person, and that you input broadcast your alt army. So yes, I too am waiting for you to fuck up and do something stupid and get banned. 
---
PS. You already got caught input broadcasting and CCP did nothing, so maybe ease off on the tinfoil. 
---
How does your proposal prevent bots from destroying the rats?
---
You will still have a decision tree, even if the rats are "working together".  The bot can follow that decision tree.
---
can you put all your poco / structures all in a one player corp,  
---
make an corp with no structures for the rest of your alts,  
---
use access lists to give your alts all access rights?
---
Like, proper opera with music, or the Star Wars concept of a space opera?
---
You seem like the kind of person who would trash talk a wardeccer and then hide behind the newbie card.
---
Last I checked we we're talking about making PvE more PvPish, not an anti bot thing.
---
I'd prefer if people actually took fights with MCAV so I wouldn't have to link a bait channel to remind them that we know they're just hiding docked up in their citadels. 
---
This isn't bad enough to be a shit post.
---
thats probably true, but is it reasonable? seasoned members just use out of corp alts anyhow. it only affects the newbie members.
---
better idea; reduce the war HQ structure timers to same level as wormhole structures --&gt; so that it can be taken out in about 3 days
---
What's the current state of Venal ? Any valuable group living or acting from there ? It seems pretty annoying to get into.
---
Speaking of low effort posts.
---
https://youtu.be/dOzsYXyjlH8
---
Tim can finally settle down. 
---
No because i don't have a scanner in that hole, so i can't transfer the poco. ( like i don't use it anymore but it still exists ) 
---
Just dont have structures and you wont have war
---
&gt; fight each other instead of blue donuting the hell out of it
---
if we are talking about highsec merc / ganking groups wouldnt it technically be blue donut-holeing it? or blue muffining it?
---
&gt;If you'd like to discuss this devblog, feel free to head on over to the feedback thread on the official forums!

&gt;At EVE Vegas 2018, we announced that work had begun on the transition to a 64-bit client. We’re now happy to announce that this project is seeing rock solid progress and we’re aiming for a Q2 2019 release.
---
&gt;The aim of this project is twofold – continued investment in the future of EVE Online with regular technical upgrades, as well as efforts to ensure that New Eden remains as visually stunning as ever, on the cutting edge of what’s graphically possible for an MMO (when you’re not playing in potato mode).
---
&gt;Right now, the audio and graphics team are deep in the testing phase in preparation for a public test on March 5th, which is when you’ll be able to get your hands on the 64-bit client for the first time by connecting to the Duality test server.
---
&gt;We’re super excited about the move to a 64-bit client as it represents a key modernization moment in the development of EVE Online and is substantial milestone in our drive to move with industry standards and continue to streamline our development maintenance costs.
---
&gt;With the switch to a 64-bit client we have decided to drop support for the 32-bit client, given that only around 0.5% of our pilots are currently playing on 32bit operating systems and the cost to support both architectures isn’t where we want to invest our development time.
---
&gt;To facilitate the switch to 64-bit client architecture, we’ll also be looking to change the minimum requirements for EVE Online. The nature of 64-bit applications means that they utilize more memory. As such, we’ll be increasing then minimum memory requirements for EVE Online from 2GB to 4GB when we release the 64-bit client.
---
DX12
---
DIRECTX 12
---
&gt;As we continue to invest in the future of one of the most iconic and beautiful sci-fi MMOs, we need to lay the groundwork for future technologies.
---
&gt;We’re excited to announce that our engine team have started work on the substantial task of providing DirectX 12 capabilities for EVE Online.
---
&gt;Switching to DirectX 12 will give us a huge increase in bandwidth to utilize more modern advances in graphics technology to continue to make New Eden more stunning than ever before. With DirectX 12 we’ll be able to use technologies such as DirectX Raytracing, and will be able to invest more time into overhauling effects, environments and visual feedback in EVE Online to provide an even richer and more immersive experience for all our pilots.
---
&gt;Since 2016, we’ve hinted at the eventual sunsetting of DirectX 9, and more recently we reset EVE Online’s default DX API to DirectX 11 to gauge how many of our pilots would switch back.
---
&gt;The results of this experiment coupled with the decision to invest in continued future proofing by moving to DirectX 12 means that we’ve made the decision to sunset our support for DirectX 9.
---
&gt;The date for the sunset of DirectX 9 will of course be tied to the release of the DirectX 12 client, which will be announced at a date to be decided in the future.
---
&gt;The transition to a 64-bit client will of course come first, but you can expect us to keep you updated on progress of the transition to DirectX 12 after that via dev blogs and more information at EVE World Tour events during 2019.
---
&gt;The release of a DirectX 12 client will mean that all pilots will need a DirectX 11 capable graphics card as a minimum requirement to play EVE. We understand that this is a leap from a DirectX 9 capable card for some of our pilots, and we’ll be sure to give at least six months of notice before the transition to DirectX 12 so that there’s ample preparation time, should hardware upgrades be needed.
---
MAC USERS
---
&gt;One question does of course remain – what about those pilots who’re playing on the Mac client? Fear not! We’re currently working with our partners to ensure that all the above also applies to the mac client too. We’ll have more information for our mac users as soon as we’ve made more progress with the Mac client and are ready to talk more about transition plans for those playing on macOS.
---
COME HELP US TEST!
---
&gt;As we mentioned earlier in the blog, we’ll begin public testing of the 64-bit client on Duality, on March 5th.
---
&gt;We’d love to have as many pilots as possible helping to make sure that everything is running smoothly and providing feedback on performance and any issues that might be encountered.
---
&gt;We’ll have more information on how to connect to Duality and how to get involved once testing commences.
---
&gt;For now, if you have any feedback or comments, then we’d love to hear from you all in the comments thread for this blog.
---
&gt;That’s it for now – we’re looking forward to seeing many of you on Duality next week.
---
Fly safe!

1 Account has 3 character slots, but only one of them can be logged in at the same time. The number of Accounts you create is basically only limited by your wealth. To log in more than 1 Account you need to have all the Accounts subbed (Omega state). Alpha (F2P) Accounts are limited to one per IP.
---
There are Tools that allow you to skip faster through all the account windows and the EVE Client itself offers possibilities of defining Hotkeys and Keybinds that only work inside the client.
---
Spreading inputs over multiple clients is a bannable offense according to CCPs EULA (Input broadcasting).
---
Fuckit... missed the B...
---
He booshes his own exca!
---
yeah but do you have any proof?
---
If you always wait for proof you will find that you can never kick anyone. Ultimately it's Wibla's alliance and there were good reasons to kick this corp, that's all that matters.
---
Aha, i missed that.
---
So /u/Bailshar you can rep a freighter getting ganked as long as they didn't foolishly accept a duel of some sort
---
Safeties yellow in highsec i guess
---
This is Jean Luc Picard Stardate 2019 Start Devlog....
---
Imagine trying to karma whore in 2019. 
---
Lol yeah they’ve been afk for awhile, but everyone has kids and families with little time for eve.
---
At least tell the bastard good bot every once in a while. 
---
Yet still you post.... See you back soon ;)
---
Slaveeeeeeeeeee. 
---
I think you misunderstand: Both of us were already wardeccing the same target. The target could always shoot both of us to begin with.
---
However, we regularly pooled fleet assets into one fleet (including logistics and boosts) because frankly neither of us have the numbers to sustain against some of our targets individually. *Despite that we both had wardecs active on the same target*, this still gave our Logis suspect. Now, unless CCP changes something, it will get or logis CONCORDed... even though, again, we've already chosen to wardec the target together.
---
You can do quite a bit, *for being offered for **free** while they still have a lot of shit to pay for to keep that very same game running*.
---
So what if you’ve been playing a long time. The cost of keeping the game running don’t stop because you crossed 100m SP. They are nice enough to allow free limited play. Either earn it in game, which is another cool method they offer, or pay. You obviously feel like it’s fun and worthy of it. 
---
Pod orbiting is the new meta in 2019
---
Again, you are overestimating the bot programmers.  You've already said that they can't be bothered to put in a simple check for bubbles, but you expect them to make weekly updates?
---
You don't have to make huge changes on the dev side that needs design, implementation, and testing (also lol that you think CCP goes through extensive testing of their changes - just look at how broken some of the events are at launch and those are probably copy pasted from previous events).  A simple change to the structure names, npc mechanics, spawn triggers, etc. would wreck most bots.  If for example, botters are still using the sanderling software, they are just screen scrapping which get destroyed by small changes.  And yea, they would adapt, but the key is that you keep making small changes that make updating the bots more work than the reward is worth.  
---
TLDR:
---
64 bit client soon. Players on 32 bit systems lolgetfucked. 
---
DX12 incoming. Update your graphics cards. No poors.
---
Mac users LOL. 
---
TEST is recruiting. 
---
nullsec miners use belts? Since when?
---
- yes
---
- lot of things, scanning, shitposting, trading, manufacturing, shooting on red things and shitposting more
---
still, it would give him more right to call himself a goon than 95% of your alliance mates
---
Low cost option: Alpha account funded by the odd plex and have a hauler toon and fw toon. 
---
My dumbass playstyle :
---
Dual omega accounts, cba/not much time to make isk, living the pirate life 
---
you are 100 percent correct. I am a noob. I started playing in 2012, and I still suck at this game.
---
hahaha what the fuck oh my goooood
---
The reason to make it PVPish was to stop bots.
---
You would still be able to go to Jita. But as of now there's no incentive for anyone to sell or buy on a large scale elsewhere. That would be a good thing. 
---
So much effort for a bad shitpost.
---
So how is buying and selling from unkown sources a good idea? That would be an improvement to our current system. 
---
I still hang out because I have faith that they'll fix the game eventually. 
---
Oh I want PvPish for helping new players understand the mechanics of PvP.  It would also get rid of true afk ratting (or make it really inefficient) which is a plus.
---
another bullshit witch hunt. if people don't want to pvp and decide to focus on industry, that's fine. otherwise who's going to build your kitey bullshit 
---
As a highsec carebear I dont think it's that unfair. If a corp isnt already prepared to defend a structure when they anchor chances are they won't ever be ready. This would give groups that are already present in a system the ability to hold the system without having to deal with timers. Seriously most highsec groups just cave the second they realize they have to fight or lose on the first timer
---
Good insight. As for the lack of player content I believe there is very little incentive for war now other than having a war just for the sake of it. There is no economical and territorial pressure to get people moving.   
---
From territorial standpoint - Most of EVE nullsec is heavily underutilized. Powerful alliances simply rent out whatever space they don't have a direct use for.  
---
I don't have the numbers to back this statement, but it feels like even the renting is not what it used to be as the big blocks will happily take in any crab for tax income that can also attend a fleet or two a month. I'd imagine most entities interested in renting are the ones that would bot. Can't see any other appeal to it, so renting as a "passive" income is probably not that great anymore (you're welcome to prove me wrong).  
---
From economical standpoint - With the disappearance of passive moon mining, there's no need to take more moons than an entity is able to mine itself. I wouldn't go as far to say that passive moon mining was better, I like that people have to go out into space and do stuff. Problem is that there's too much space and not enough people to fill it with to create friction and enable more conflict.  
---
Without the need to expand territory and no passive incomes to be acquired, the only reason for war is a war of grudges or to just fight someone out of sheer boredom. Which I think is what happened in the last war. Supers died and Keepstars were destroyed but in the end the map remained pretty much unchanged.  
---
Even if an entity decided to move to another region, it can't because it has already invested too much into citadel rigs at home. And nobody is going to shoot himself in the foot just to change the scenery for their membership. So every established entity is effectively anchored in place unless relieved of it's space by force (which isn't gonna happen because nobody truly needs space more than they need to preserve the value of infrastructure they have already built).  
---
I can't see EVE getting X-times more players overnight, nor am I expecting EVE universe to shrink. But allowing alliances to move along with their infrastructure could help in allowing for territorial wars.
---
^(And btw, some regions are still utter shiet, which further decreases chances of somebody wanting to take over them. Even with all the changes made so far to Drone regions, they're still too bad. Who'd want to move there? Just to build Excavators and other drones? No faction mods? No faction ships? No implants that are actually useful? Very unfun :()

---
If you want views you maybe should bring somewhat bolder fights because that's just ... not interesting.
---
Fix that they want to you pay for game time to use multiple accounts?  
---
So much good advice in this thread!
---
The only thing I have to add is that starting in Eve is very personally dependent.  
---
If you enjoy going it alone and sorting out how the game works...do it.  Lots of Eve players did just that.  
---
If you enjoy hanging with people when you play...do it.  Most people, but not all, find this the best way.  New Eden can be a pretty lonely dangerous place without friends.  
---
As others have said, the core new player groups are Eve uni, KarmaFleet, Horde, Brave.  Each are great in their own way, but with very different cultures.  If you don’t like one, leave and go on to another.  No one care much anymore if you were a Goon or Horde.  So many new people move around these days.  Pick the one that seems like it fits you.  
---
If you want very structured learning, no one beats EveUni.  They have lots and lots of formal classes.  If that rings your bell, take a look. 
---
If you want to dive into the game for real, and are ok with not knowing everything before you undock, join KarmaFleet, brave or Horde.  I, of course think KarmaFleet is the best, but that’s totally my bias so your mileage may vary. Lots of other great people enjoy the others just as well.  
---
If I can be of help, feel free to give me a shout and I will try my best to answer questions.  
---
Cheers for the info - it makes sense now. Once well into the game I think a lot of people use their wealth to buy Omega time for a 2nd account, to help with supercarrier flying. I've got a goal to work towards now! Should only take............years.
---
To space!
---
Wait until this ends up in rocket league
---
Stores is not a structure. Imagine a page like the PLEX page but for corps to sell their items. Buying from and selling too known sources is a good thing. Sorry mate. You're simply wrong. 
---
For actual macOS users out there who read this comment and misinterpreted it as CCP dropping macOS support, please note that his “LOL” is that of an ignorant PC user and CCP does plan to continue to support macOS going forward. 
---
We are not
---
Neither one of those countries is the largest communist dictatorship known to man, so what's yours?
---
I consider the short timer problem in general, not just in context with an anchoring structure. Let's suppose that I have a structure for 2 months (that makes my corp war eligible), and I get a wardec at the end of my prime time (which may or may not be because of the structure). That is not so fun to prepare to imo.
---
keep telling yourself that, maybe it will be true one day (it wont be but ok)
---
&gt;You've already said that they can't be bothered to put in a simple check for bubbles, but you expect them to make weekly updates?
---
You have a lot of trouble following a conversation.
---
Bot authors adapt to the things they need to adapt to.  Bubbles are rare, so they do not bother to adapt.  The lost isk from the dead ship is not worth the effort.  Just like Microsoft doesn't port Windows 10 to a toaster.
---
Changes that actually break the bot are adapted to very quickly.  See: Carrier changes.  Bots were back in a week, despite the massive difference between fighters and drones.
---
This was already covered above.  For some reason, you are unable to absorb this information.  So I'm just gonna copy-n-paste it again.  Hopefully the repetition helps.
---
&gt;You don't have to make huge changes on the dev side that needs design, implementation, and testing
---
EVERY change on the dev side needs design implementation and testing.  When you don't do that, you break things.  Like, oh, say event rats that do way more damage than intended.
---
&gt; just look at how broken some of the events are at launch and those are probably copy pasted from previous events
---
And you propose that they not only keep doing that, but that they do it more frequently.
---
&gt;A simple change to the structure names, npc mechanics, spawn triggers, etc. would wreck most bots
---
First, you're assuming they're only operating by name.  Which is frequently not true.
---
Second, renaming something would break the bot for an hour.  Woo-hoo!  You've accomplished so much against bots!!!  They'll never get back those 3 ticks!!
---
&gt;And yea, they would adapt, but the key is that you keep making small changes that make updating the bots more work than the reward is worth.
---
You seriously think someone who is making a good RL income RMTing is going to look at a name change and say "Oh well.  Guess I'll have to go get a real job"?
---
You think someone who's making a very nice living in their country selling bot software is going to look at frequent renaming and think "Oh no!  I'm doomed" instead of "Ka-ching!  Now I can sell subscriptions!"?
---
“Space opera” is a recognised form of science fiction.
---
It’s science fiction, and it plays [most of it] in space, because *doh!* EVE Online.
---
You would also be amused by who made this exact quip: “Like, proper opera with music, “.
---
I have very large sections of it ready, now they need to be connected, and the parts that run through each other have to be aligned and make sense. I’m extremely nervous about screwing that up because that would look bad and I do not want this one to fail. I’ve got so many ideas in it, I’m having so much fun writing it, it’s got to work and work well.
---
Made me laugh, thank you. Very true.
---
Korea has literally nothing to do with China you utter mongloid, it's directly allied with the US and has several thousand US troops stationed there, the countries are diametrically opposed.
---
Do you want to keep being a dribbling retard or do you want to read a book?
---
Adding sources to know who you're buying from or selling to wouldn't break the game. It's already done after your sale. Also, my other changes are incentives to move your market outside Jita. That's all. Nothing would change. You could still use Jita. 
---
Somehow couldn't figure all out before we killed 2 supers of them
---
ok sorry. Next one will be better.
---
You're welcome.
---
1. Yep, fitting cost scales more than module effectivenes. For example medium armor repairers roughly two times more efficient than small ones, but need 20x more power grid. Larger modules just won't fit on ships of inappropriate size in most cases. Although there are exceptions, and most noticeable is shield extenders. Apparently they designed to be installed on ships one class smaller than implied by their names, i.e. medium shield extenders are for frigates and destroyers, large shield extenders are for cruisers. There is no specific logic behind this fact really, just a thing to be remembered.
---
2. Neuting is indeed a thing, but one small battery won't save you if you encounter a neuting ship. At the same time, it occupy a precious slot that could be used better. Small cap booster would be a lot more useful in this case.
---
CCP trying to ignore the real question: Is the POS code still there?
---
Praise James!
---
yeah CCP please don't ban me for using Path of Exile
---
Eve Online
---
Denied.
---
you want to remove a structure? You already have a stupidly idiot-friendly mechanic of REMOVE HISEC aka wardec aka grief dec, grind it, fella, you're not entitled to effortless kills every time you want them.
---
or.. OR... people who play a certain game, should be wary of a business decision made by people from a country neighboring the largest communist dictatorship, especially after the recent scandals on Serenity, involving the censoring free speech and criticism of China and the consequential crack down that ensued.  you know, that whole bit of drama you havent heard a single word about because China is actually prretty good at censorship and destroying any piece of technology that gives free speech a platform 
---
Thumbs up, that man. Have an upvote. For people who buy plex to convert to isk it's an awesome thing that the price is so high so while there are whining poors shouting about not being able to play for free there are also a load of very quiet people spending real money on isk so they don't have to grind. I don't see a problem.
---
dont be sorry play your game, you thought of a trap and it worked, that trap could be better, butgj getting out there and trying.
---
Except the age. Plenty of people in their late 30s and early 40s
---
Hey look, \[marmite/bee/dinosaur/panda\] its funny because it is like \[alliance\]!!11
---
The imagery and chat surrounding them heavily indicate the pedophile intention of the images. 
---
I find it quite hilarious that people can't see these added benefits to this game as a good thing. For one, you will still be able to operate the same. But with more incentives to move your market. Go ahead and stay in Jita, but I love the idea of anything that gives players options to sell/buy elsewhere. 
---
This is where all you people show your stupidity. 
---
&gt; to buy Omega time for a 2nd account
---
The biggest number of Omega Accounts of 1 single player i have seen was something around 180 Accounts ;-)
---
These schemes usually run on PLEX Sub with ISK ingame.
---
No, fix that it's possible to use multiple accounts for free. 
---
The imagery and chat surrounding them heavily indicate the pedophile intention of the images.

---
It's not ignored. It's still there.
---
nah
---
Wouldn't anything Mad Max fall under the Minmatar umbrella anyhow?
---
(Besides, we know that the Minmatar have Maōri roots, which is at least sort of geographically close.)
---
It's a trap !
---
In the lore of Dust 514 the most badass units were the player corporations. Elite planetary conquest corps which controlled the temperate planets of Molden Heath. There’s interesting lore about concord being afraid of them (no shit) and how they re referred to as “Warlords of Molden Heath”. 
---
your words not mine. but just so you know, when you finally arrive in hell, the demon with the biggest horns I would probably avoid
---
Neutral logi was fixed when they started going suspect. There's no real reason to use neutral logi except to trigger people.
---
This was in the early stages, when they were still trying to determine the proper ratio of pointy things to vehicle mass.
---
Thank you. This is my first post. 
---
Well, cap is life, neut legion kills both
---
They mentioned the _shit_ out of them. You’re learning the mechanic isn’t what you want it to be so you’re shooting all the messengers, so to speak. You need to deepen yourself in the code, update your permit, and praise James 315 in local every time you see a +1. 
---
TBH, thats what at least 80% of the playerbase does.
---
EVEs playerbase is quite old (or aged with EVE), If you have a fulltime job and/or family, thats the onlx way to play EVE.

I am subbed on 3 Accs since 2007, my average per week is 6-10 hrs. The creditcard sub is essential to me as I am not forced to krab for my sub and so am free to do what I like most.
---
Because you’re an abrasive turd and nobody here likes that. Stop whining. 
---
I wonder how long before this gets nuked...
---
Hy it's black canary lol
---
I hear u like burst jammers
---
oh god man that's even worse. do you at least get some tax from it occasionally?
---
I don't really care about EVE dying because it's been doing that since 2003, but it's sad that the art of shitposting has been replaced with shit posting.
---
I love this!
---
Crumbs! 
---
That's a little more committed than I plan to be. That person needs to stop playing eve. 
---
It's encouraged

You keep missing the point that WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT CHINA YOU FUCKING MORON!!!
---
You can have a sci-fi Opera in space. I'm an operatic singer, so it was a genuine curiosity (and hope) of there being an EVE Opera. I am aware of Space Opera being a genre.
---
I've played drunk enough to probably do this, haha.
---
Oh OK then what was I worried about? You see I just thought that maybe the timing of Serenity getting its free speech kicked in the nuts, you know where people were getting banned for criticizing china and communism left and right, and the giant shitstorm that created, then what do you know... a few months later ccp officially announces the sale of their IP to a korean company, that apparently has very littel understanding of the game it bought... I thought maybe there was something to that. but you seem convinced that korean business men are all trustworthy and would never do anything of questionable ethical integrity 
---
not canada ;)
---
So are ESSs still a thing? The one where you can anchor one in a null system and it increases bounties but someone can loot them? How would I go about looting them?
---
Thank you
---
Depends on how much disposable income you have when it comes to understand your examples, but I think most people can relate to what you're saying.
---
Always

the 0.5% on 32 bit systems.
---
Come back!
---
&gt; In your opinion, is it worth playing Eve for a few preset hours a week?
---
Yes. A lot of players play exactly that way. If you end up in a larger alliance, you *will* miss out on some stuff, but it's just a balancing act to see what fits with your schedule.
---
&gt; Would you pay the sub fee if you only logged in from time to time?
---
Yes, if I was having fun. If you like undocking for those few hours per week, then it's worth your money!
---
&gt; What would you do during those few hours? FW? Check your PI? Camp a gate?
---
Whatever I had the most fun doing, tbh. If I'm in an alliance, I'd check for fleets and see if I could make my few hours per week fit with those scheduled activities. If I'm doing solo stuff, then I might balance my time between roaming/gate-camping pvp things with a small dose of pve money-making on the side.
---
Some good advice is to set *goals* if you have very limited time. It's too easy in EVE to get lost in the forest and miss the trees - don't just log in to spin your ship for three hours every Friday night. Have a goal, maybe even spend some of that weekly time *planning* what you'll do when you undock, then get into the action when you sit down and have a nice stretch of time in front of you.
---
the analogy presented was comparing the relationship with china and korea to the us and mexico.  he IS talking about china in this example, maybe you need to learn to read?
---
Nope nobody lives there otherwise they would have removed the poco at this point. 
---
Like there are way's i could clear it by moving all the other toons to another corp, or wait until a friendly group rolls into it but it has a degree of can't be asked to put in that much effort.
---
I'm wondering if their will be a limiter on the amount of ram a single client can take up. Seeing as you don't have an upper limit of 3.5GB per client this means a single client could infact take up 16GB and leave you nothing else for your other 15 rorq accounts /s
---
I’ve said it before: if paying for something like EVE Online is precarious economically, you have bigger problems and higher priorities than playing games. Which is not to scoff at people in that situation, it is a sad reality for far too many people.
---
Now there you’ve got me. You’re an operatic singer :-).
---
I love opera with a passion, I have no talent for making music [it saddens me, that’s what my life is].
---
Battleships are not good at mining. You can tell by the name. Your Praxis can mine about 25k m3/hr not counting docking up to drop off ore, which works out to about 3.5m ISK/hr.
---
The price of 500 PLEX is 1.925 billion ISK. That's 550 hours of Praxis mining. There are only 720 hours in a month. If you tried to do this to pay for Omega valued at $15, your wage would be 2.7¢/hr.
---
If you find a way to overcome the oppressive NPC miners and scrape together enough ISK for one month of Omega, you will then be able to upgrade to a Retriever with a bigger cargohold, and your wage will more than triple to 8¢/hr. At that point you'd only have to grind 5 days a week in 8 hour shifts to maintain your Omega status.
---
Is this the sort of future that you look forward to? Do you see why new players are often told that it's unwise to start off with the goal of grinding out your sub in-game?
---
I would suggest that you forget mining, embrace being an Alpha, and follow the standard career path joining a player corp and roaming the galaxy looking for fights.
---
I was not aware of that, but it’s interesting!
---
Then I’d need actual names for that to work.
---
The golden age of /r/eve shitposting is truly over.
---
:-( I never need to see that.
---
How do you de-incentivize botting in pvp? Without ruining or degrading group content.
---
IF your basis for this discussion is that bot programmers are always on top of their game and can make immediate changes to ever changing in game mechanics, test them, push out updates and get the botters to install new software, and then rinse repeat every week for small changes then this discussion is just dumb.  You are treating them like they are god programmers when it is a bunch of amateurs.  
---
You claim that somehow these changes would take weeks for CCP to implement, but the bot programmers would have fixes within hours pushed out to all their bots.  I  mean, fuck, why not just hire these guys to do dev work for CCP?  They'd have everything up and running in a week.  
---
TLDR: water is wet.

Totally not blue with goons though.

That's on Serenity, which isn't run by CCP or Pearl Abyss at all, you utter feckless retard. Western companies are required to hand over the game servers to a Chinese company to run, CCP has no say in what happens on Serenity other than handing the Chinese company patch data.
---
Good fucking lord you're a complete idiot. On top of which, Serenity's restrictions on what kind of speech is acceptable have existed for as long as the server has existed, it's fucking older than Pearl Abyss has been existing for.

Same as me.

Sure.

If you train the PI skills and do blueprint researching, as long as you keep up with it, the characters very easily profit, between pi sales, extracting sp/selling injectors, and selling max ME/RE bpos, or just selling copies you'll make a decent amount mire than it costs.to keep the account omega.
---
It's just the initial setup that can take some capital or time, you need the skills to do that stuff plus your primary focus (scanner alt, cap alt etc)
---
Stain plates?
---
I'm having more fun trying to figure out how this works.  
---
If you do 1 DPS ship + 40 Augorors, vs it's mirror. The Thorax will somehow kill each other and then it gridlocks. If you do 400 Augoror vs 400 Augoror, they kill each other equally until they hit 146 Augorors on each side and then gridlock. So even assuming it does only account for raw numbers + tunnel-vision it makes no sense that it would result like that.
---

---
Vegemite is Australia's way to keep everyone from emigrating and ruining the good thing they've got going on.
---
True
---
right right.... so unprecedented actions taking place on serenity involving censoring of anyone dissenting of the chinese communist dictatorship... the mass migration of those players to tranquility where they continue their dissenting ways and the subsequent sale of CCP to a korean company... ALL HVE NOTHING TO DO WITH EACH OTHER... I PROMISE!!!
---
A lot of that is in Eveish, a language i'm yet to learn. I shall return here in a few months time and it'll probably make sense. 
---
This is exactly the kind of content I love to see.  You talk about the fit and why it works, then the decisions going on before and during the fight, and you clearly have very good knowledge of game mechanics.

Voice and music volume both sounded grand to me, nice work.

Read my post about 8 more times, understand what I'm saying and then get back to me.
---
CCP and Pearl Abyss haven't been censoring Tranquility, the rest of your post applies to Serenity, which they have no operational control over.
---
What part of this are you finding difficult to understand? I can use smaller words if you want. 
---
Either that or sober up and have a nap, potentially see a doctor if you think you're having a stroke.
---
Maybe you need to learn about global politics, the comparison was because the stupid comment about countries bordering eachother and made in a clearly sarcastic tone. 
---
That being said, relationships between USA and Mexico, and China and South Korea are worlds apart, thus not able to be compared in the slightest.
---
Maybe you need to learn to actually understand what your read?
---
Not everyone is like this, and some people do have trouble paying even a single EVE sub. I'm not saying that EVE is expensive (I find it pretty low priced actually), just that you may be over-generalizing a 'lil bit.

Empyrean Age is a great between-the-lines story for the actual game lore during that expansion, and Templar One is literally the story of how the Dust mercs came to be.

How do you know they havent, or that they dont have plans to? the fact is that YOU DONT KNOW and you REFUSE to acknowledge the awkward timing of all of these events. eyes closed, ears clapped but mouth wide open... per the usual pedestrian stooge

Well, I'll be damned, I guess they [did address the neutral logi problem](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/a8z2l1/dude_who_dual_boxes_cloaked_logi_wants_a_1v1/ecgiwxb/). Still no dice with another moderately successful game or the war against bots, though.
---
hmkay, did not try anything above 20 dps + 5 Logi. I found it funny that when the setups are mirrored they always anihilated each other down to zero. Most funny thing I tried was 10 Leshaks + 3 Guards vs. 10 AC Machs + 3 guards. The Machs kited away from Leshaks and killed them one by one through reps, when all Leshaks were dead the Machs then turned around chasing the 3 guards until dead. The result was a decisive 13:0 for the Machs
---
Yeah but the dude is still right -- as a policy, the coalition diplos can't condone vigilante bot killing. Maybe there's an 80% or 90% chance you're right in your specific instance, but what about the other 10 guys who follow your example? Once you set a precedence that it's okay the door is open, and it's a lot more drama to close it again when people inevitably start abusing it. It's easy to get spies to start trouble using a policy like that, and once the diplos try to end it they will be accused of protecting bots.

Pandemic Horde and TEST are the two groups that have had perimeter trade citadels. Not goons.

Because they haven't in the 16 years that Tranquility has been operating, and Pearl Abyss have never done so for any of their other MMORPGs.

There's no connection between Pearl Abyss and China. South Korea and China are completely different countries. What reason would they have to implement Chinese speech restrictions?
---
There's zero evidence for anything that you claim.
---
&gt;awkward timing of all of these events
---
What awkward timing? NetEase has been enforcing Chinese speech restrictions on **Serenity** since it was created, I have no idea how you're tying Pearl Abyss's acquisition of CCP to this at all. 
---
Explain to me the connection, because there isn't one.
---
If you extract it currently costs ~100m per account per month to sub. Obviously you're not going to progress in terms of net worth and SP, but if you're a vet chances are you have more than enough of those already. $40 a month isn't a ton of money with a full time job but it's not insignificant either. 
---
Pulling from log files typically updates your *own* orders, not the market data. You want ESI to pull market data, unless you're going through every single item's Market entry and click "Export to file".
---
If you export your market orders to logs (My orders/Corp orders -&gt; "Export"), you can use "File import" in Evernus to get that data. Then you can use ESI: Import Prices -&gt; from web, which may take a while, and depends on having imported citadels already, but will grind through all the relevant market orders via ESI and display the differences.

do you have any proof that people are roleplaying slave owners? How do you know they aren't actual slave owners? *Do you have any proof?*

Yes, if you can support your fun activity during your on times. Doesnt matter what it is. Run a DED, explore a hole, even check your PI, whatever you enjoy.

What are you even talking about? Our discussion was about PLEX users leaving the game if they stop letting people pay with PLEX and how PLEX generates more income per purchase than one month worth of sub does so driving out those customers hurts them more than falling sub numbers. The effects on the price of PLEX is a whole different thing.

What the fuck

Not sure, but far too soon.

The way I see it, China arranged to have CCP bought by someone who would be more willing to cooperate with them in banning or censoring anyone critical of their government on TQ, after the mass migration from Serenity and all the drama surrounding that. Since of course they knew CCP would be unwilling to sell their IP directly to the chinese because of the PR nightmare it would have created 
---
You don't, it's not about making it impossible to bot, but about increasing difference between scripted/routine pve approach and actually focusing on what you're doing. If the best way to cheese pve is to think and constantly adjust/react, you don't kill botting but increase human player effectiveness over bot.
---
With mobile depots and combat refits (don't C5-C6 solo dreads do stuff like that?) it could make things interesting (side effect includes making it viable choice to farm less time, but paying more attention instead).
---
Apex is really good

It's almost like this:  He complains about Goon's "PVE culture" but wouldn't make near as much money without Goons using Rorquals/excavators.  He literally bites the hand that feeds him.
---
Saltmeca: Here's why this is further evidence of goon modbias, as well as goons intentionally harboring bots! 
---
Should probably talk to CCP too.
---
It's purely because if Corporation A also wardecs Corporation D, but Corporation B does not, then if some of Corp D starts in on Corp A when A and B are teamed against C, then how do Corp B's reps and boosts not provide an unfair advantage against D?
---
In your very specific case, assuming you both always only wardec or are wardecced by the same people, yeah, it's not exploitative, but that's highly unlikely to be the case 100% of the time, and is easily fixed by entering into an alliance together. Or continue to team up as you do, but fleet separately and fly together, so that logi/boosts remain separate, if ye want to stay regarded as separate entities.
---
Neuts don't affect the old rats. You'll only waste cap on them and there's nothing unclear about that. The new diamond rats though (not in this video). I can't remember for sure if neuts affect them, but back when they started appearing in New Eden, CCP said that they'd run out of cap if you neut them.

I wonder if the 64bit client could possibly open more opportunities for the game or more content/features perhaps?

Bots and RMT are a big business in low cost-of-living countries.  If you don't keep the bot working, you stop making money.
---
Also, none of this is hard to write.  It doesn't take a "god programmer" when it's all solved problems.  Complete with existing libraries you can stitch together into your bot.
---
&gt;push out updates and get the botters to install new software, and then rinse repeat every week for small changes
---
Plenty of games have pushed out small anti-bot changes.  The bots were down for less than a week in all instances.  Again, the massive change of carriers/supers going to fighters took about a week for the bots to adapt.
---
You've yet to supply any evidence that bot author's can't actually adapt when they need to, and history shows they can adapt when they need to.
---
&gt;I mean, fuck, why not just hire these guys to do dev work for CCP?

Because a bot is far less complex than EVE.

CCP tried yanking billboards.  Small change, right?  Just don't spawn them when you create the sol.  Caused enormous problems.
---
That kind of interaction is what CCP has to worry about, but bot authors do not because their bot is far less complex than EVE.
---
This is a perfectly well stated characterization of the uphill math involved in trying to PLEX an account from Alpha. I don't even think my first go around with PLEXin my account will do the trick, it might. It's probably going to take a second grind to PLEX before enough skills are in place to make it reasonably doable on a more permanent basis.
---
&gt;Is this the sort of future that you look forward to?
---
Not really. If I had any other choice I would just buy it and be done with it. But, given that that is not an option, I'm working with what I have. And that involves every maximization I can invent. Including getting manufacturing going, and enough research done to know what to manufacture. Something I was late getting started on. I hope after PLEXing I can get it done in five 8 hour shifts. Because I can about grind that out in 3 days easy enough. That would mean I could comfortably bank 3 months of Omega in 1 month.
---
&gt;Do you see why new players are often told that it's unwise to start off with the goal of grinding out your sub in-game?
---
 Absolutely. Anybody with any choice in the matter would be crazy to put themselves through that. But if it's not an option then it's a bit like telling someone who can't afford a car that there's a Lamborghini dealership right down the road. The mining grind is pretty much what I do as I'm making spreadsheets to strategize. That planning time is important to me this early in the game.
---
&gt;I would suggest that you forget mining, embrace being an Alpha, and follow the standard career path joining a player corp and roaming the galaxy looking for fights.
---
That's actually a quiet reasonable alternative. But it doesn't really fit me that well. Battle mechanics is definitely something I need to learn regardless and still know very little about. And there's at least one player I'd like to get my chance in battle with. I'll get there. But I could never be happy restricting myself to such a small part of the game. What interest me in any game is learning detailed mechanics of every aspect of the game. No game that limits me to merely winning/losing battles is going to get, much less hold, my interest. Besides, the PLEX grind is in fact doable and does get much better with time. And I don't have to keep Omega consistently to continue enjoying the game. The Omega implants at least will continue to work even if you drop back to Alpha. 
---
I'm not at all rejecting the reasonableness of your advice. But I also need to play it in a manner that holds my interest as well as suck it up and deal with the fact that certain options are limited for me. It's not unlike real life in some respects. I can perfectly well live with that.

They are bots. I have 100% evidence of it from recording my ops with Olmeca and Mar5hy.  Going to release a video of it soon.

Mar5hy was literally declokaed next to the nyx ship scanning him. He also anchored a bubble 10km in his align path and he just kept on ratting.

The VNI's undocked every 60 seconds when we left system so he just bubble trapped them.

what part of the fact that the people they were going after on Serenity all moved to TQ and started doing the same shit that got them banned on Serenity, do you not understand? and if you think what happened on serenity was just a flash in the pan... i got news for you.. turns out the tight knit groups that people form together in games like eve, actually do things outside of the games they play that lead to them getting investigated by the chinese govt... i mean the idea that its a verified fact that A) chinese officials did have a hand in having several hundred people banned from serenity for government dissent and b) chinese officials have reached out to CCP in an effort to censor these same people on TQ should be enough proof to leve these accusations... and honestly i have no idea the mental gymnastics you must be doing to ignore it

I wouldn’t go that far. I have both and use a KVM to switch between them. I’m happy with calling Windows a toy OS in which it’s only useful purpose is running games. Real work gets done on macOS.

That was the exact video I watched, right after reading the Wiki article, before making this post. I already know that if you kill the NPC transport it ends their mining for the day once their mining rigs are full. But I was looking for a strategy that didn't actually involve killing the NPC. Merely making them hide out in their safe spot for as long as possible.

Just trained into leshaks. Going to give this a try thanks.
---
Wonderful! It sounds like you are an intelligent person. It overjoys me to hear that you are interested in learning mechanics in detail and want to find a playstyle that will hold your interest. In that case, please avoid highsec mining at all costs. You will come to hate EVE and burn out if you pursue your Praxis mining plan.
---
One of the reason highsec mining is so poorly compensated is that it requires no talent at all. I would suggest that you try your hand at exploration, making forays into null and wormhole space. You will earn more from a single relic site than you would from 10 hours of Praxis mining, and you can do it in a disposable ship that costs only a few million ISK, even as an Alpha. Good luck!

That would be up to your operating system to deal with.  And it'll deal with this using swap space.

I'm honestly surprised there are still 0.5% players on 32 bit systems. I wouldn't even know where to get one of those anymore.

The main thing it would open up is dealing with more "things" at once.  Which means fewer people should crash out in the 5k pilots titanfests.....probably resulting in 10k pilots titanfests.

I agree. If you can't figure out a way to save your structure within a few days, you aren't going to in a week. Structures should be 3-4 days total to remove.

That's not proof. That's just images of someone orbiting an anom in a pod. Lots of reasons you might do that. Maybe they are just roleplaying as a bot. Maybe they are providing intel. Maybe they think that if they stay with you long enough you'll think they are part of your pack and take you in, like Mowgli. Maybe he thinks you're his Baloo.

&gt;	The identity of the War HQ structure for a war will be public information available in the war report window as well as sent directly to the defenders when the war is declared as a reminder.
---
This seems too easy. Here’s an idea: keep the location a partial secret. The defender gets to know the Constellation, and they have to send recon to scout out and tag the HQ so everyone can see the location in the war report window.
---
At the current state of Upwell timers it’s probably fine as proposed, but if the timers get shortened, then the location should be hidden a bit.
---
Well shit that's interesting, well done sir
---
because you died 
---
Should be a kill for me lmao
---
I know you've been around since the POS mechanic was the thing of the day. You could anchor or remove a POS in like an hour or something.
---
I'd rather have them anchor and unanchor in a much reduced time but also to die within less than a week of RF.
---
Cat ears gate to Stain when???

just make it a 25 hour anchor instead of 24.25

It’s gonna be great bit having to go to potato mode in a big fight so you don’t get a memory disconnect. 
---
It was actually POS's running on the original rat code, not the other way around.
---
Although I'm fairly sure that changed a few years back when they made rats switch targets.
---
Thanks. High-sec mining is a drag. But it also makes it easier to concentrate on making spreadsheets of various game related mechanics to plan my game progression. Grinding through a 14 or 15 hour day is not that big a deal for me. So in that sense it's very useful early in the game. But is does get boring some days, so I have a Venture I renamed Gasbags just for gas cloud mining, another just for salvaging, and a Merlin just for exploration. Stuff I can afford to lose and already have replacements for in storage. The first time I went worm hole exploring I made the mistake of thinking I was safe from those stationary defenses and didn't understand how to recognize what kind of wormhole I was in. Got 1 hit killed. LOL. But so far the unplanned events like that tend to eat enough time that overall it falls short of being as profitable as high-sec mining. But that is almost certain to change with experience and growth in skill points. My character is only 38 days old with just shy of 1.3 million skill points.
---
&gt; ray tracing
---
Anyone with a 2060 and up.  Resolution doesn't matter really.  It just depends upon what CCP do with it.  i.e. you can use the RT cores for intersection testing server-side (very nice) or on the client you can use it for light probes or reflections, or both.  You don't have to do it on every pixel either. 
---
Basically you've got options... you apply it selectively dependent upon the material group, etc.
---
Most of the time, when you dualbox, one of your character will need less micro management.
---
That's for future iterations.  
---
By the time CCP adds such a thing everyone is gonna have a ray tracing card.
---
So I’m confused by what you mean. How is a structure not a store? It’s a structure, that is player owned and operated, that sells shit. 
---
I want to see sunlight refracting through nebulae... in real time.  
---
Yes, I play maybe an hour every other day, at best. I’m an alpha, because I can’t justify spending the money on so little game time, but it’s fun. I usually either go around and do explo, or use my logi/ewar alt for fun standing fleet shenanigans. I still have fun, scanning wormholes out and flying logi/ewar is really fun for me, and relic/ghost sites in catch are lucrative enough I’ll be able to plex for the summer.
---
That's clever.  Also I'm surprised they're going for DX12 instead of Vulkan.  Vulkan is cross platform after all.  I don't see that you'd need to change your asset pipeline at all.  Maybe... I don't know I haven't seen the code.
---
I am on board with this Comment.

I dont think anyone is offended? We get this all the time from reddit bitchbabies and dont care. Slow your roll there buddy.
---
When you shoot at NPC miners they will warp off to a safe spot and then their defense fleet will come to shoot you. If you are gone the defense fleet will go join the miners in their safe spot. They stay there for about 15 minutes. Then the miners will warp to an asteroid belt (not necessarily the same one) and resume mining. If you shoot them too many times the NPC miners will become red to you and call in reinforcements whenever they see you on grid. You probably want to avoid that because it's hard to repair those standings. 
---
They will stop supporting DX9 at some point not in the near future.

DX11 will probably be around for another decade.

---
from inside a bubble? hard to see from that POV
---
Now the real question will become "can the memory management code in the new client handle managing 8GB+ of utilized RAM?"
---
This is why I'm glad CCP - ineffective as they are - are the ones responsible for identifying bots. So many players have no clue about basic game mechanics.
---
It'll improve potato mode.  On not unrealistic scenarios, DX12 can take around 30% work away from the CPU.  However the price you (the developer) pays for that is more frequently crashing your graphics drivers and blue-screening the PC.  That is until he's ironed out all the bugs.
---
So that was the part you didnt understand. Not sure what the problem is, and since you are unable to put it in words, what do you want?
---
It won't, the economy will be relatively quickly back in the old state as most folks already have there path, keep in mind SP is now for sale so you will see people buying skill injectors or dumping a army of alts. 
---
The only way this has and chance in hell of working is if you delete skill injectors.
---
Not actually correct.  As the in-game price for PLEX rises, the benefits for players who purchase PLEX with real money only increase.  As such, increased ISK prices for PLEX will eventually push the supply of PLEX up from where it is over time.
---
Now, you could make a perfectly legitimate argument that significant portions of the playerbase make their plans and have their fun calculated assuming certain thresholds for ISK/PLEX, and that as this ratio increases it will have dramatic knockon effects in New Eden which will eventually reduce the benefit of selling PLEX for ISK to the point where the supply dwindles despite the increased ISK price of PLEX.  I do not know if it is true, but it could definitely be argued.  That would require discussions on the Utility of PLEX and ISK for players, and the actual exchange rates between them for large groups of people with different tastes, which would be both difficult and interesting from an Econometrics perspective.
---
Even still, there's a lot to potentially learn from the lore people there and they're the friendliest ones of the bunch.
---
Pure speculation. Most devs have been working on DX all their career, retraining or rehiring will be costly. They will not want to slow whole teams down by changing API, especially true if they already have the technology and experience to export DX code to OpenGL for Mac and Linux.
---
I don't think anybody's using Optix in games.  That would be mad.  On the other side of the coin I'm very interested to see if AMD will respond to RT and Tensor cores in new NVIDIA cards.  I mean if they don't they can get fucked for sales can't they.
---
Hey. I'm not trying to be negative. I get that this is the Internet and it's assumed that everyone is an anti-social monster and everyone else is lured by the most negative voice. I guess I meant something more along the lines that multi-boxing 3 toons, presumably also that you play enough to support these 3 toons, seems to me to be end game EVE and that you're probably skilled enough to be confident in yourself.
---
DXR will be optional I'm sure.  For now :p.
---
TFW you're involved in a proxy war and don't even realize.
---
Yeah I only say that because they where inside a bubble but it is difficult to tell. Also if they fleet warped why didn't they leave grid? There was only 2 points.
---
to me it looks like they clicked align and only warped when most where out of the bubble. 
---
They avoided promising performance improvements of any kind with the switch to 64-bit. It will look better, have higher system requirements streamline dev and maintenance costs.
---
I feel like a lot of people expect and assume big battles will be automatically fixed with this, but CCP sure is trying hard not to promise anything on that end.
---
\&gt;  Pure speculation 
---
Not really.  The APIs are almost the same. The concepts are definitely the same.   They're just different ways of shunting the same structures into the driver command queue.  I speak as a Dev who's being interleaving OpenGL and DirectX development on various different projects for quite a long time.
---
Mac would be Metal (equivalent API) of course.  
---
What about people who play during the day. 
---
I've played with plenty of Aus people, didn't talk to them as much as my European or American Corpmates but they were there a decent amount. 
---
And the losers send ISK to the winner?
---
prespawn an anom if it's a rock haven?
---
check for bubbles?
---
check if it's "occupied"
---
And this would both help with the problem you presented (it gives 2 extra hours to wardec) and with another problem too.
---
NVidia's DX12 list:
---
https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/technologies/dx12/
---
They didn't leave grid when they "fleet warped", there was only 2 points on grid. Looks to me like the first 3 hulks aligned out at the same time when they landed first.
---
I hate everything
---
Gotta give it to the Chinese for not over escalating
---
I need that suit/apparel... like, yesterday.
---
No, they aligned out off the bubble on the same tick, look at the speed on the overview off the bottom three hulks.  Asic miners and stuff you know.

idgi, someone popped your MTU and you are salty about it?
---
Side note: Getting every single one of those to 5 is a massive time sink and you are liable to quit eve before you get there, due to not training into anything fun. I would prioritize the engineering skills and get the rest to 3/4 (pref 4), and then get into some ships you can have fun with.
---
Low effort bait 0/3.5
---
Tough crowd lol. Anyways, since when do pirates have killable structures?
---
If you’re flying with a small group of bombers then you really should only be hitting one or two targets and be able to take them out within 30 seconds. Any longer and you will probably die. So you shouldn’t really have to be choosing primaries too often.
---
However, the general primary order for any engagement should be
---
1) things that keep you from killing (logi/ewar)
---
2) things that pose a unique threat (for frigates this would be rapid lights)
---
3) high dps, low tank (destroyers, attack battle cruisers) 
---
4) higher tank targets 
---
Now this is going to vary a lot but they are some good general guidelines 
---
lol true
---
Laffo
---
Yes these are all reasons to warp your pod back to an anom that you just died at 
---
I wonder if the anom I just lost a VNI in has hostiles in it, I should go check and then stay orbiting the anom until killed
---
Quit it dude you're either a terrible troll or nearly brain dead
---
Maybe because they don't actually fire continuously?
---
I'm almost positive that Uriel is actually an employee of CCP working on EVE lore. That or a huge roleplay nerd. Either way, kudos and thanks for these writeups, they are fantastic!

When I have limited playtime, I focus on having a setup that allows me to do FW roams. If I'm just jumping in, I like to do exploration as well.

MTU is not most interesting thing... look how many T3C he lost in last few days :D

Watching the clip is super helpful.
---
They had a cyno lit, was talking with Theta as soon as they came through, and generally remained calm. They had no trouble talking to Theta as they were in Comms, like you should be.
---
Technically those aren't mutually exclusive. 
---
rofl, repay damages?! I'd windmill slam leave any alliance that did that shit. 
---
Watch the video dickhead. They were in Comms and talking with (I assume) Theta, giving very accurate and calm intel and getting the cyno lit asap.
---
why did you show yourself getting tackled but cut it just before something happened? seemed like a weird clip to just add 
---
In fairness to Logan here, while he is not the direct customer, you could call him an asset to CCP, in that he creates a service that other players desire.  Namely, he consumes PLEX that other people buy with real money, and he helps thicken out the population of New Eden so that the rest of us have a more interesting galaxy to play in.  While he, himself, is of only marginal value to that entire structure, he, as a category of player, has serious value.  Not infinite, but meaningful value, nonetheless.

I find it hilariously ironic how triggered you are. I was killed by someone in TNT who called me out for "bot like behavior" and preceded to harass me via chat (they said something about CODE?). I said maybe you should check your own allies out for the rampant botting and he said that it wasn't a problem. Welp I guess it is lol!
---
Bring back the spethial Chevis :(
---
I do die to titans, dont worry, wasnt escaping that one.
---
since like 2 years ago.
---
Not me. I’m already convinced. 
---
Bring back Derty Dan.

Neither was buying and injecting SP...

&gt;seeing rock solid progress

just like the new chat was "ROCKSOLID"?
---
Id prefer a rainbow over the gate
---
That is the benefit to other readers.  He starts with an insult, and the rest of us know that we can skip his nonsense entirely and lose nothing of value.
---
It's about £10 per account if you buy the time from CCP rather than PLEXing. So he's talking about 2 account multiboxing = £20.
---
True, but I have largely ignored that because the price is a little out of my ballpark. But like I mentioned, a lot has changed in the past 6 years. Still getting caught up on a lot of it. I was a little surprised with how many player controlled services went offline or appreciably changed in that time.
---
I blew air out of my nose

I'm sure this guy with a keyboard spam first name and autogenerated last name is also totally legit
---
One gate was camped, once, and I think it was zombie not m0o and they all got banned but my memory is fuzzy these days. They even tested it on sisi first.
---
Have you looked at Proton? I believe it already has limited support for games that require DirectX 12. I run EVE and other games via Proton and have been getting some pretty impressive results
---
The problem here is really citadel mechanics. If you're tying the war to a structure, but a war takes a week and killing a structure takes often longer than a week, you're not actually achieving the objective of giving the defenders something to shoot for. If you're wardecced for one week it is 100% impossible for you to remove the aggressors' "War HQ" in that war period. And conversely, if you wardec someone to kick over their structure, you can't remove it in a single war cycle.
---
If you could remove a structure in a reasonable time it wouldn't matter that you missed the anchor timer.
---
Previously the only structures in high sec were POCOs and POSs, both of which can be destroyed in 2-3 days.
---
Whats the % markup on buying them on the character sheet?
---
&gt;Not actually correct. As the in-game price for PLEX rises, the benefits for players who purchase PLEX with real money only increase. As such, increased ISK prices for PLEX will eventually push the supply of PLEX up from where it is over time.
---
No. Two reasons for this. We have seen it simply doesnt happen to such a degree that it compensates for the increase in demand over time. The other reason is that more isk per plex means they need to purchase less.
---
&gt;which will eventually reduce the benefit of selling PLEX for ISK to the point where the supply dwindles despite the increased ISK price of PLEX.
---
We are probably already there.
---
Another issue is that from the standpoint of making enough isk to buy plex, anything other than botting or injecting multiple caps has become obsolete (and as price goes up, demand follows as they need more bots/caps).
---
Hello Astriania, I hope you have a wonderful day!
---
I hope they're able to keep the Mac release simultaneous with PC, but I expect there will be a lot of bugs with the new client and Wine that they don't have the manpower to solve as fast as the PC bugs.
---
I'm fully capable of running the Windows client on my Mac, and yes it runs far better. I just don't want to have my primary OS shut down all day while I play spaceships. If I wanted to run Windows 24/7 I'd have a PC!
---
Try ferrying Encounter surveillance systems between the tradehubs, they can have a nice markup!
---
Big frags, dude took it quite well all things considered 
---
mind blown
---
For sure man. The reaction made the kill so much better, it’s nice not being told to go fuck yourself when you kill someone on stream.
---
Hello Dante_Rotsuda, I hope you have a wonderful day!
---
do you really think South Korea is China? 
---
Do warp core stabilizers work against deployable warp bubbles?
---
suddenly my investment in a RTX 2070 isn't making me as sad...
---
Holy hell, thats a lot of excavs!
---
Talk about isk efficiency!
---
You do realize there are 32 bit versions of all Windows releases (including Windows 10), right?
---
No, players in HS don't need to be fleeting up, helping or making friendships with each other for any HS related pvp, that is what low and null is for.
---
We were debating seiging the third dread because we didn’t know how long it was going to take to kill. Once we hear her talking to theta we seiged and hoped for the best, the guy in the third dread may or may not have been in a High grade crystal pod either lol 
---
I would advise new players to wait until they can fly a carrier before investing in that second account. Once you have a carrier you can make enough ISK doing anoms or lvl 5s to plex the second account. Also you'll need a cyno alt to move your carrier around, so it just makes sense.
---
I can pay for my second account in 2ish hours of lvl 5 missions.
---
TBH If CCP base it off the DXR fallback layer, Any card from the last few years would be capable of it.
---
Just RTX cards to a much better extent than others.
---
Dx12 is entirely different than any previous Dx line. Many companies have said that going from Dx11 to Dx12 would be the same amount of work as going from Dx11 to Vulkan.
---
A true goon would be selling the stolen excavators in delve, building all he needs in 1DQ1, and then selling Titans to GSF for the umbrella.
---
You are digging yourself a hole here based on the idea that plex is volume controlled commodity. it is not. As many people buy plex, will be as many plex are available. There is no real "running out" since its bought for real money. 
---
Most people are blind to their alliance of choices shitiness.
---
If you only have 2GB of RAM, it is probably time to upgrade anyway.
---
 **Release 1.0.5**
---
* Moved the project to Beta status
---
* The Trade Tool now also calculates the Price per Jump and will take a average of 7.5% of broker fees
---
* Some other small fixes to make the system faster (better overal performance)
---
I imagine a new setting, Ultra Quality (or something).
---
Ah, thanks.
---
I have been really disappointed with AMD for the past several years.
---
Nvidia NEEDS a competitor to keep their prices in line with where they should be.  Without a strong competitor, they just keep jacking up the prices.
---
My bet is we are at least 1 - 2 years from AMD having a comparable card to the RTX20 series, and by then Nvidia will probably be looking at releasing a new generation of cards with their (now) more mature technology.  Everyone adding RTX to games will be building the games to support the RTX cards...  
---
Come on AMD.
---
This will lead to fewer crashes from running out of memory at least.
---
What I can't wait to see (and hopefully this is a move in that direction) is the ability for them to take advantage of multi threading.
---
Imagine a giant fight going on where the server can actually take advantage of the 46 cores it has!
---
Try strip dancing?
---
oooooh sorry wrong subreddit.
---
;/
---
Need  sub sale :oooo
---
I don't know, but the 8GB of ram (to add to the 8GB I currently have) I just ordered are willing to find out!
---
Because you canceled or failed the hack. This counts as a direct action you took.
---
Also try a 1600mm plate and an explosive hardener instead of dual reps.
---
Nope. If you show info on scramblers or disruptors and go to attributes you will find a warp scramble score. This number will be an interger -1 for disruptors or "points" and -2 for scramblers or "scrams" (faction has more but thats the basics) if you look at the attributes for the warp core stabilizer or "stab" you will notice a +1 to warp core strength (some ships have inherent warp core strength as well). When people refer to points, scrams, and stabs these are the numbers theyre referring to, and you need that number to be 0 or positive to be able to warp away. Bubbles do not have "points" or scram strength, they are simply an aoe effect on all ships. You can counter this with t2 frigates listed as "interdiction nullified" this class is called interceptors, as well as T3 cruisers with the proper subsystem fitted. As of right now there is no fitable module to nullify interdiction, so those are the only two classes of ships with a counter to bubbles, and neither are available to an alpha player, and omega players require decent skills or very focused training to fly the intetceptor, and very high skills (1+ year with focused training) to fly the T3C. 
---
Hmmm some tasty shit flinging.
---
Can you poste logs? I like a good meltdown.
---
I take exception to the implication that there is anything risky or dangerous about joining any of those corps.
---
Well there's 0 risk if you're flying T1 frigs they give you. I got downvoted I guess because shooting at everything is bad advice, but it's good learning experience.
---
Aside from the porn then?
---
Cat ears for the avatar!
---
Started 3 months ago with the same mindset as you, and I still haven't got my head wrapped around all the mechanics. The learning curve is steep, and it goes on for a long time. It has definitely got less frustrating though.
---
This game offers an amazing sandbox that I haven't found anywhere else, so I think it's worth it!
---
Rorq is tanky, and it can hold a huge amount of drones, so probably?
---
Don't forget to check out "EVE-O preview" if you need to manage multiple screens from a single monitor or even multiple ones. I triple box sometimes and it's fantastic to use.
---
Some of my fav moments is ganking t1 scanners without any defensive capabilities in my anathema with 1 single rocket launcher. Gotta love those killmarks haha
---
Don't use a citadel with assets you care about if you don't trust the owner.
---
Where else can you get a few hours of entertainment for the price of a month subscription of eve? It's totally worth it even if you play a few hours a week. 
---
Just 1 week to late 
---
OwO
---
That other person was straight up lying to you about the content of the discord.
---
Oh [seadc]..biggest whelpers in hisec.
---
back in UALX some of us jumped in with PI open
---
I havent said that. Why would I think that?
---
It "runs out" when the demand is a lot stronger than the supply. You will always have the severely overpriced plex for sale, but anything else will be bought quickly as the botters, players using a fleet of injected caps, or SP farmers dont care about price. These will push the price ever higher.
---
A lot of isk making activities are now obsolete for the purposes of plexing an account. Plex will eventually only feed bots and injectors.
---
And I can't put dickbutte on the side of every ship I own. Wtf. 
---
Maybe keep reading? It makes so much sense a paragraph later.
---
did you miss the part where that's the unnecessary complexity they're removing 
---
Well I mean that’s 1750 dudes, nothing to scoff at.
---
So you keep a pastebin page open so you can throw trash chat into local chat? Alright, I'm mildly entertained.  May I presume that the locals respond favorably to your messages?
---
I do that, I solo pvp in lowsec and do some PI. 
---
i know....its just how crazy this game is or was.  Weekly Cost 100 million  is a lot better
---
Yes, Abyssal sites are great for this. 
---
Good money and they take no more than 20 minutes. 
---
So if you come on with the plan to do 3, you will not take more than an hour. 
---
You played yourself 
---
I love those moments. The ones where you jump and immediately regret all your life choices because your in the wrong set.
---
Even if some of them are simply AFK ratters, I certainly have no objections to people hunting them down.  You want to play like an NPC?  Then you shall suffer as all NPCs have suffered before you!
---
Also, it means that I can make fun of people who are so proud that they PvP, when their targets are effectively just unresponsive NPCs with player names.
---
Cheers to help against botters, appreciated. 
---
I was really hoping the next graphics API update would be Vulkan :(. DX12 has been a shit show.
---
This is pretty much my availability for games, can you describe to me what Abyssal sites are?
---
The man said he was selling me a Vexor Navy Issue and that's exactly what I got.  I don't see the problem here; it works great.
---
^^^^For ^^^^900 ^^^^million ^^^^ISK.
---
One the largest factors here was due to the backend change from API to ESI.
---
Many sites I found when first learning the game were accessible, but you could always tell they were poorly managed, if no at all. So when the API &gt; ESI came, many old sites still utilizing API were dumpstered
---
I'm all for the occasional 10k pilot brawls in full TiDi if my client is stable.   
---
But yeah, there's a Malthusian starvation thing going on - CCP adds more hardware, we add more pilots. In any case, it's cool that it's possible. 
---
Yep.  Just found out Eve Online is going to incorperate RT technology into their next iteration.  This was all entirely predictable (devs love new toys) yet somehow I've been somewhat castigated for pointing it out...
---
Anyway I agree with you that AMD need to up their game in graphics.  NVIDIA will be on a 7nm Samsung process in 2020.  I don't know what, if any, plans AMD has in the RT arena.  They would be mad not to compete given in 18 months all games will support it (it's being put into Unity and Unreal, so even indy devs will be able to use it).
---
I occasionally camp relic sites there, and there’s lots of small fleets that pass through, but the majority of them are either NC. or Imperium. 
---
Yeah, but I was on a 1050TI, so I am gonna bet the new card is significantly better for that :)
---
THINK OF THE SCREENSHOTS! 
---
I googled it to verify.  The first result was:  
---
&gt;Microsoft's Windows 10 will also feature 32-bit version, but why?
---
how does losing an empty pod matter? u get it for free... the only possible inconvenience that it may cause is having to jump a few gates to get back if your home station is in a different system.
---
That are meant for speciality systems and unique situations. Such as the .5% who still use it. Do you or anyone (or anything) you know still use 32 in a laptop desktop?
---
&gt;at some point plex will basically run out 
---
&gt; It "runs out" when the demand is a lot stronger than the supply. You will always have the severely overpriced plex for sale,
---
It runs out, but it doesnt run out /
---
Really, just stop posting. 
---
same, but out of annoyance, primarily.
---
Wrong! Fly spaceships that you can trust to fly dangerously. regardless the price. 
---
C4 wormhole corp are a certain type of cancer....
---
I regularly do fleets in crystals and never realise until I’m in half armour and my arse is going like a strobe light. 
---
To be fair to the dread pilot he knew what he was getting himself in to and was willing to risk it so props to him.
---
But there is such a thing as a fight worth posting about and one not worth posting one. This is just sad mate. 
---
And as with any significant refactor or change, it'll lead to more bugs in the short term.
---
Which should be fine.  It's the price of progress.  But it's also a good reason to not promise fewer crashes, because that's *likely* to blow up in their face.
---
Hopefully it won't be as bad as chat, but now that those chat bugs have been ironed out the chat system should be in a better place than it was a couple years ago.  I'd rather deal with a few months of bugs than be stuck in place.
---
The statement above is one I can get behind!
---
Well, the way I see it skill injectors were introduced as a duct tape fix to some of Eve's other problems. I wouldn't have a problem with removing them entirely.
---
Up until the end of last year, I actually used 32 bit version of 8.1, yeah. Not saying people should in 2019, essentially I used it because I made a mistake years ago and when I realized it, it was problematic to move everything I had somewhere to reinstall.
---
When they were talking about expanding their borders I didn't think they would go this far..
---
Another quality ARC post. 
---
Caroline's star. Now *that* was an event. Wonderful write-up! 
---
&gt; With the switch to a 64-bit client we have decided to drop support for  the 32-bit client, given that only around 0.5% of our pilots are  currently playing on 32bit operating systems and the cost to support  both architectures isn’t where we want to invest our development time. 
---
Hahahahahahahah.  Even companies that know how to program aren't dumb enough to do this from the getgo.   Time to buy a lot of popcorn.
---
Where is the contradiction? Its as if you cant interpret what is being said.
---
You thought if the only plex left costs 100b, that would disprove that plex "runs out"? You are quite pointless.
---
They are mid to high level PvE sites. There are five tiers. The first 3 can be done in Caracals and the like although for T3s i'd reccomend HACs.
---
Basically you buy a filament from the market and activate it in space it will open a tear in space to the abyssal sites
---
They are completely variable PVE encounters, there are 3 rooms with NPCs in each and a 20 minute time limit to clear them all. 
---
If you dont clear them in time you die, ship and Pod. 
---
There is a limit each room, if you go too far outside you will start taking damage. Not too much but enough to worry about.
---
There are like 5 different environmental effects. Electrical is probably the easier to do at the start, as you get a huge bonus to cap recharge but a penalty to EM resist. 
---
They can only be done in 1 T1/T2 Cruiser (not Tech 3s though)  or can be done in 3 Assault frigates.
---
The rooms are variable and will change every time you run a site. 
---
Its generally the most fun PvE in the game, T-1/2 can be fairly easily done in a caracal but to do T5s you are looking at 3 billion in Deadspace mods and at least a 1 bill pod. 
---
Not sure on the Isk per hour in T-1/2 but im doing T3s in a 400 mill Sac and pulling about 50-90 mill an hour.
---
you purged the last one once you finished the paragraph
---
fucking lol
---
50% of Eve gameplay is managing time, some of ways of life in Eve are more demanding than others, but the huge ways can be played with a few hours a week if you know to manage properly your time. Obviously, some corps/alliances don't accept that their members are busy in RL by default, so just avoid them and you will haven't problems with that.
---
If I have only few hours a week to play I do some of cheap PvP and PvE to fund, maybe FW to do simultaneously. And idk, i can improvise meanwhile xD
---
&gt; Time to buy a lot of popcorn.
---
Naw.   Save your popcorn for the 64-bit launcher!
---
It’s the EVE ethos: believe 1/10th of half of what a quarter of the people say the 1% posters are alleged to have said about what someone heard someone speculate about during a night of binge drinking.
---
I would like to see you prove this then.
---
... were they blue?
---
Looks like 100% TIDI
---
IF...so far all your shit points to none of what you think.
---
I did! my point was on how complex this game is sometimes.... I did not know that the current wardec formula used logs and exponentials.   
---
is fighting them in hisec legally not a competition
---
I'm so confused. you could always fight back, nothing has changed, and even when they fix neutral logi you still have to fight on a grid with hostile logi 
---
The dude looks pretty blue in that screenshot.
---
I get what ypu are saying. But ccp chamged are making these changes for $$$ not for the "community". 
---
It just happens to line up is all. 
---
Everyone seems to be overlooking this.  There are almost always huge problems when a game transfers to 64 bit for quite a while, and most of those companies show...better programming skills...than CCP.  It is very possible the game will completely break and they'll have no fallback.  Would be business as usual, except this time it's not something they can ignore for a year like chat.
---
Honestly the entire IT industry would love to give the finger to superlegacy hardware users like all you 32bit DX9 Only plebs out there. Come on.

As long as they don't feed supers it is fine, I guess...
---
the self hatred seeping in
---
When you fought them they mostly just docked up and you cant do shit, now they need to risk atleast a bit and if they dont undock it goes boom
---
Neutral logi was hidden, now you know how many they have in system and command bursts are not untouchable now besides ganking.

You realize this is CCP, right?  The same geniuses that merged all of the sound settings into one because having options is too difficult,  while at the same time adding tons of useless annoying beeps and clicks, fucking the wormholers?
---
&gt;Rigs are unnecessary
---
They truly know how to play their game

lol at these clowns downvoting you for speaking out against VM/VPN alphas for days. the playerbase gets dumber by the minute.

Much appreciated! This is a great goal to work up to (:

I mean you might get suicide ganked, but gankers usually go after mining barges / freighters more often.

Unless you are driving around in some blinged out battleship I wouldn't worry too much about it.

do PI

Then it is a good sign that the most profitable course of action is in the direction most of us want.  There may be a connection between these tow things.

Where should I buy/sell them if not on the market?
---
This is CCP we're talking about, known for hits such as "Boot.ini" and "POS code".
---
Goons origins have faded from goons so theyre not that relevant tbh
---
The fur flies, and the claws come out.
---
This is part of why I play Eve.  People who truly do see the bright side of strange and new situations.
---
Nothing.
---
Yeh, fun as well. Join the channel Abyssal Lurkers in game and its got a few fits you can use. 
---
Jita...
---
Its really not, though.  Chat is better, but it still isn't fixed by any stretch of the imagination.  If you pay attention on multiple characters, there are still often inconsistencies with people in chat channels/local.  Also, this still randomly happens on one or more clients practically every day  [https://puu.sh/CTaH6/4c503eeb11.png](https://puu.sh/CTaH6/4c503eeb11.png)

when they docked up you got to go about your business....

I will add those to present to you what I deem as... the WarDec community!

As I said I spent a lot of time in that community and this is where I noticed a lot of the awful characters that are in it. Those are the same people who trolled that vet, the same people who defended wars, and the same people who were against Structures:

Hi Talkedbackagain. I'm one of the moderators of the Dust veteran's discord server. We have a strict policy of reporting any NSFW images or even conversation involving minors. This has been the mod team's stance since day 1 and is grounds for immediate ban, no warning. I encourage anyone who has seen evidence of this alleged activity to immediately contact me via PM with names and images: @Ripley Riley#0001
---
That is exactly the information I was looking for. For some reason they haven't shown up today, but this is the same belt where a random player killed one yesterday. So basically all I'm guaranteed is the same 15 minutes that sets on my aggression timer. But I do have a good chance of moving the NPCs out of a particular asteroid belt. The rep loss is minimal and I can easily keep it in good standing running a few missions.
---
a tornado dunking a prowler would be dope
---
200m SP and you still run missions? wth
---
try something else, with 200m SP you should be able to do a lot of things
---
No idea, not my "ship."
---
Fixed.
---
Thanks for the advice. I might do that.  But as far as my question goes, what will I notice that's different?
---
That would be fun to find and destroy on occasion, I won't lie.  It is a bad idea, and I hope CCP never adds such a skin, but it would be amusing.
---
There's also an audio podcast covering these if your friend would rather listen:
---
http://evereader.org
---
&gt; But ccp are making these changes for $$$ not for the "community".
---
You can do something for two reasons at the same time without it "happening to line up". 
---
ME 2!  We should chill in HY- sometime.
---
I still like my CCP employee theory better. Source? At Fanfest, I saw Uriel sneak off with the CCP lore guy (I forget his name) right after the Lore panel to get food and beers!
---
I agree with you the industry in general has moved away from that but EVE never followed the general trend of the industry anyway and it has always been a niche product. I hope CCP recognizes that and continues to excel in their niche.
---
2^64 bytes is the limit, good luck on buying 17179869184 gibibytes of ram however
---
i rembed that i kneow there like 3 others but i cant rember there names
---
Well I do most of my mission running in my Machariel.   I wouldn't say it's blinged out, espectially compared to what others have done to theirs, but it's a pretty solid build .
---
I honestly have no idea what this thread is about.
---
The problem is if the niche becomes too niche, EVE becomes unprofitable (or comparatively sub-optimally profitable).
---
But these changes have nothing to do with the server.
---
Oh, so it's to prevent the advantage it's bringing! Sorry, I thought it was more along the lines of you getting aggro for using something on another player, and then it sounded weird. But if it's only wven they're in combat, so you're helping them, then that makes sense of course. Thanks for clarifying. 
---
A couple of years ago, one night, I was about to propose to my girlfriend when my roommate Joseph barged into the room out of nowhere, tripped and fell over, breaking a glass table with his face. Totally ruined the mood. Now, I didn't know Joseph THAT well, don't even remember where he was from, but let' just say I put my plans on hold to help him through his injuries.
---
Joseph had gotten big glass shard in his eye, making him completely blind in that eye. He was walking around with one of those cotton pads on his eye for a couple of months. Then suddenly, he disappeared, along with my girlfriend
---
Apparently they'd bonded during the time after his injuries, and eloped together , left me behind without as much as a note. I tried to track them down, but never could.
---
In conclusion, if it hadn't been for cotton eye Joe, I'd have been married a long time ago. Where did you come from, where did you go? Where did you come from, cotton eye Joe?
---
1. Would add a ton of complexity to what is already arguably the least user-friendly system in EVE. I'm all for customizability but honestly that feels like just too much.
---
2. I'm curious what the use case is for this - for more convenient situational awareness when you brackets are showing a lot of stuff &amp; it's hard to see the bookmark icons in space? 
---
OSS used to live there. Not sure if they are anymore. 
---
Goons have an alt corp up there for blitzing burner missions which is why you’ll see them active up there. There are a couple other small groups doing the same thing. 
---
Not really, the war was still there, the same way cloaky campers can make an entire system no longer go about its business.
---
This guy is a phony. He now stands here, trying to put himself into the spotlight. We've kicked him from the wardec discord, because he entered and immediately threatened us by declaring that he will drag us all through the mud if we kick him out again.
---
What an asshole.
---
If CCP can't build an overview that's useful for new players, how do they expect new players to do so? I do get that there are barriers on the dev side towards improving this for new players, but that barrier is so much higher for new players who don't yet know what overview information they need but don't have.
---
It could also happen by expanding outside of the niche and losing the original audience. 
---
Bots.
---
I see what you mean. I did take your comment wrong. 
---
I can do PI (PP) with the best of them. But I know little of pvp.
---
But no one cares about PI. Not something that ppl brag about. lol
---
Looking to get better.
---
To fix what ? 
---
Like pre-injectors there where balance issue's sure but nothing that needed to generate a isk &gt; SP relationship, if anything the isk &gt; SP thing hurts like new players it also hurts people that don't want to play isk grinding online. 
---
Like sure high SP small groups could often engage way beyond there number and yes triage carriers and titans needed a Nerf, the where to close to a i win button in massive balls but post skill injectors most of this shit got worse. 
---
Still got half a fps. 
---
Firstly I don't know who on earth is planning to buy the injectors from you for 970mil as that is way above current value (although the way they are going they might make it there soon, but then they are normally tied to PLEX price/ extractor price so costs go up too).
---
You need to work with exacts - IE make a spreadsheet, calculate exact skillpoints over a 30 day period, current market costs of extractors, how much you can sell injectors, factor in your market fees and you will find that you are probably isk negative. Right now it is pretty tight when it comes to skill point farming.
---
Also the preferred method for skill point farming is 3 characters on 1 account all skill point farming and you use MPTCs to keep the others going as they are cheaper than the cost of PLEX for another account.
---
If you don't care so much for profit, this is a great way to keep accounts subbed 'for free' and use them as cyno alts, scouts, industry etc
---
The only thing we're really celebrating is you being a salty pleb who thinks he's credible 😂
---
Except 32-&gt;64 is exponential so more like 2^5k pilot titanfests
---
Salt
---
and hate towards the wardec discord I guess hahah
---
I just hope the drifters are getting lots of use, out of that Amarr whore queen.
---
in highsec? probably nothing. the PVE has not changed at all.
---
I like Devlog tbh
---
Or they could actually pursue the "EVE Forever" vision they originally laid out, and expand the EVE Universe into multiple cross-genre gameplay avenues that increase the total complexity and depth of EVE while providing smaller, bite-sized ways to experienced the EVE universe.
---
Whoa.
---
Quality of life changes, another isk making option in Abyssal sites, Triglavian ships. Unless any of those were there 2 years ago - I find it hard keeping track of changes relative to time
---
Wibla dont Crack
---
Maybe we should post all of the discussions since you obviously cherry-picked your little screenshots
---
There's a reason you're the only person who ever got banned from the discord 😅
---
More like all the people who spent a decade defending that cancerous mechanic.
---
Yeah, Very much so.
---
Triglavian ships, you say? Now you have my interest.  The main reason I play EVE is to relax and collect ships.  So any new ones are an interest to me.  What are these ships like? 
---
No kidding eh
---
Honestly, dont make yourself to big of a target IE worth a lot with no tank and you'll be fine.
---
If it was about the eve community it would have been fixed  ages ago. It just fits the narrative.
---
This is about $'s. Which i understand. Thats buisness.
---
Any advice on things to do or cool new ships?
---
I agree in spirit, but there’s no way for CCP to make it impossible. No matter what measures CCP tries to implement to prevent it, people will find a work around. 
---

AMD cards are already capable of the DXR fallback layer of raytracing, Just not as good as the RTX cards are.

AMD's plans are looking to be One of the next 2 gens, 2019 or 2020 will Incorporate Ray-Tracing hardware to give it a nice boost.

Sorry, "target IE"?

If any one is curious, the FRT structure was in XIX space and had been for like at least 6 months.

and what will you do without skillu?
---
What do tactical destroyers bring to the table? What situation(s) require them/be a good idea to bring one? I'm specifically looking at the Confessor but curious about the whole line up as well.
---
OSS killed 2 Horde astra recently or was like 4 BS
---
For ages they had to deal with people telling them that everything was fine, "HTFU!" to paraphrase some.
---
It's during the CSM Summit last year that they realized through numbers what everyone else knew, that wardecs were costing them players, and thus money.
---
Never not take fights on a jump bridge.

Sure, but why would you ever install that on 64bit hardware?

There used to be uses for 32 bit software on Virtual Machines, but even that's outdated these days.

Clever catches

I can ship spin solo still

fear prevents the system from going about its business, not the camper

But... Content!

We're staged a few jumps out of Jita now. Fancy joining Horde?

I think they knew long before that
---
I don't like or support CODE. But this is a good image.
---
A VNI that warps to your site, can't respond to you in local, doesn't react when you yellow box them (red boxing is bad, yellow boxing is love), continually sends drones after rats you are killing, and then does nothing to defend itself when you pull fighters and the rats turn on him because he is running an auto targeter. And then, the pod stays in the exact same spot, and is still there over an hour later when you swing through to pick up your MTU and salvage the wrecks.

Lol thanks

---
Thought you had spy alts?  You have claimed you had spy alts.  Seriously, you should know this.
---
You actually have 30 minutes to declare the war, not 15, because there is an additional repair timer. And if you miss it by just a bit, you can shoot it once with a suicide noob ship, before the owner can online any modules. Then you can shoot it directly into structure.
---
0
---
Take a step back. You are seriously arguing that it is not in any way abnormal to lose a ship in an anom, warp back to the anom after hostiles leave local for 2.5 minutes on the dot, and orbit the anom until downtime. You do that often? Just chill orbiting a rock for hours and hours, not talking to anyone or doing anything? Even after everyone leaves local and your corporate mates log off, you stay orbiting just in case? And you're arguing that this is not a normal at all?

Does this model ramp up time on trig modules?

I smell Russian Collusion (low effort tbh, but you don’t succeed if you don’t try)
---
I love seeing Drek fleets. 
---
It's damn near required
---
[deleted]
---
They use new weapon systems. All the skills and bps drop in abyssals - single pocket over sites. They are timed though, 20 min to complete or you lose your ship and pod.
---
Sounds like abyssals would be something you’d be interested in. Google it and you can get all the info from the eve pages.
---
SkillPoint Farming is an ISK sink even with +5s.  For a plexed alt it, SP Farming, it can offset the monthly cost of that sub significantly.  But It's not paying for itself. 
---
MCT Skill farms used to be marginally profitable.  But with the recent "Correction" in MCT costs, ISK cost is now more inline with the 485Plex cost, it makes so little profit, if any, that it's hardly worth the hassle.  IMO it's not worth the hassle.

If ever there was a change that bitter vets should be happy about, this is it. This helps everybody across the board. All playstyles.

Why not just switch to Vulkan?

It will simplify Mac and Linux support.
---
Stop doing this when I'm at work :/
---
I’ll be frank and say that I was appalled at hearing that something so unsavoury might be happening on your Discord server. And then specifically about a community I too have been a part of.
---
It’s the internet, you want to be careful with these things.
---
Thank you, I didn't know how to word it to look it up outside of Google and it came back with just regular information on skill extraction.
---
On second look though this is for sp farming. I was looking more at reorganizing and specializing not selling off the SP. All good though. I appreciate the link.
---
Somebody, somewhere, will complain about the nostalgia of fights in potato mode.
---
suicide ganking is hilariously overblown
---
youll be fine 
---
but if you're really worried, use a Marshal for mission running and have an exit cyno ready in a nearby lowsec so if you get spooked or see gankers you can just teleport away
---
No worries. It was in my saved items as i want to use it for when im away from my pc. 
---
care to share what he left out? I'm interested

I knew I should have left sport early :(

I’ve not played for a while now, but unless they’ve radically changed it, the simple answer is yes.
---
I used to dual-fly, running my primary through level IVs and my secondary following to salvage as an example, or to mine and load into the orca.
---
I totally agree and understand. I find it reprehensible and take a zero-tolerance stance on this issue in particular. Our mod team is in full agreement -- our stance on child porn and loli images is made explicitly clear in our rules channel.
---
Nice video! Loved the soundtrack. Bit of an abrupt end. Keep it up.
---
In that conditions, when corporation D gets involved, corporation C's reps would either cycle offline or cause concordokken, depending on the safety settings of pilots involved. Again, I'm not expecting to provide support against uninvolved persons. What I'm mostly asking is, can there be some sort of a logical check in the system to see if this situation exists ("If: All involved parties are involved in a wardec, do not activate RR crimewatch mechanics. Other: Activate mechanics as normal.").
---
Boosts are a bit more finnicky since they run for so long; I'm still thinking about that, but admit I can see no alternative aside from splitting them up at this time.
---
*Hey just noticed..* It's your **4th Cakeday** XHavicc! ^(hug)
---
&gt; saying you aren't prepared or that something happened in game while no one was around is silly. Eve doesn't stop just because you aren't logged in
---
true, though we still can set, for example, structure vulnerability to match our playtime.
---
&gt; I was killed by someone in TNT who called me out for "bot like behavior" and preceded to harass me via chat (they said something about CODE?).
---
bwahahahaha
---
I don't get what you mean?
---
*glares at work clock* ......almost.......out.....
---
Diamond rats... Not in mission pockets though. I guess on that Burner missions though.
---
Yeah I’m kinda glad they’re looking to make some things simpler. Games can have lots of depth and complexity, while smallernindividual portions should be simpler and easy enough for players to understand. 
---
That's really good actually!
---
A lot of industrial applications use 32 bit, especially ones integrated with older PLCs, robots and various older automation systems.
---
The main argument for the 7 days is to give weekend-heavy corps a chance.  There's a reason PCU spikes so much on weekends.
---
That being said,  an exception for war HQs makes a lot of sense. 
---
Tactical destroyers are like assault frigates on steroids. They can put out great damage, have a massive tank, or be stupid fast. However, they can only do one of these things super well at a time based on the mode you are in, the rest fall down to being decent. Compared to an assault frigate which does everything well, but not amazing, all the time.
---
Tactical destroyers bring unparalleled versatility into an engagement at the requirement of high levels of pilot skill. They perform above their class when in their specialized modes. I personally think that they are one of the best classes of ships for solo pilots who want a wide engagement profile.
---
Thank you!
---
Highsec will become safer down the road due to a change in how mechanics work out so you won't have to worry about random wardecs. Suicide gankers are still a think and will always be a thing. 
---
Honestly with that much SP why haven't you tried out nul? You can still keep your ships but experience so much more.  Why don't you pvp? If you are worried about making mistakes alot of that is removed in fleet fights so you can just take them in. 
---
If you want to try nul/ fleet pvp join us in discord. Im not sure if you heard but dredditisrecruiting.com
---
Luckily no one ever was required to understand the formula to be able to use it ... and it's not actually complex. How many people do you think ever cared about understanding the formula? No one needs to understand it, to be able to use it.
---
There is useless complexity and there is inevitable complexity. There is no use case, even less in a game where the idea is to have fun, where useless complexity has a case.  EVE is hard not because you need a math degree to understand it....but because of the effort needed to me good. 
---
I'm glad CCP can understand that to get rid of useless complexity will be better, now if they only made and effort to make a better UI....one can dream. 
---
I expected a 3d combat simulation...
---
Doubling it is quite a bit change. But you probably want it to online close to the time it anchors, so the corp that put it up can have it during their active time.
---
ok retard
---
System RAM limit will hit first. So instead of crashing at ~4 GB the game will hit 8/16/32/whatever your RAM ammount is.
---
Why would a company want its game to appeal to the largest amount of people?
---
I've played a fair amount of games that over time have upgraded from 32 to 64 bit clients. usually the way they do it is impliment a 64 bit client and call it "beta" and give players the option to play either / or, then subsequent update patches the beta, then the 3rd one disposes of the 32 bit client and the 64 bit becomes default. Some even take it a step further where they simply switch default client, and then phase out the 32 bit on their last update.
---
Maybe CCP is up against the clock though, so they can't take all these steps. Maybe a huge chunk of development is being held up by the 64 bit client and can not progress any further.
---
If they anchor it at the time they're active, 48 hours instead of 24 hours is still when they're active. 
---
Being a vet does not make you immune to shit talking.  And only plebs vets go out of their way to use *being a vet* in an effort to deflect criticism. Lots of people are vets.  Im a vet of the invasion of afghanistan and the second iraqi war and that means precisely fuck all in video game land.
---
I understand. I would love that personally. That would make it much easier for us. But increasing the time to catch it from 30m to 24.5 hours is very drastic.
---
May your sabre alt catch many krabbers and your prober always be fleet exempt.
---
that is a LOT of rorquals in that belt
---
Only if you’ve turned off swap.
---
I figure we’ll hit a limit on number of people who want to be there before we hit the mathematical limit.
---
You're really only likely to encounter suicide gankers along the trade hub routes. Unless you are bling fit no one is likely to bother you. Changes to wardecs make it safe to run missions in your own corp as long as you have no structures. Watch out for forward operating bases and diamond rats they will pod you
---
Yeah well it will "run" with swap file. But if you though a PC is slow just wait until you are operating with swap file.
---
Those same machines are also still running Windows 2000 and XP.
---
I enjoyed reading this!
---
Yup. And I spend a good chunk of my time working on them, repairs, upgrades etc. sometimes going for an OS upgrade and using the 32 bit OS due to hardware limitations.
---
Well I did not get banned I left because Sol and Dom made it a total waste of time.   Toxic Yaken however is a really good guy.
---
This is a nerf to SP farmers. Appalling. ^^^^^^^^^^/s
---
This is bullshit you specifically have a sub room just for nsfw images which is full of porn. Did you remove it recently? No revisionist history please. 
---
Oh no it's not that he is a vet that is the problem.
---
The problem is they have that behavior with *everyone*.
---
Here they used the fact that he was a vet to attack him, if he had revealed anything else about himself they would have used him, he was a carebear, he was advocating for changes in Wardecs, he deserved to be treated like this. That's the problem.
---
Anyway, the same way you are supposed to give some respect to elders, you are supposed to give a modicum of respect to people who put their life on the line for their country.
---
What's a diamond rat?
---
Lol not the intent, they both have their uses. Like I said at the bottom I usually end up flying the sabre a little more, just depends on what I think I might find :)
---
yes  
---
I'll edit this comment when I have a pretty-looking imgur album (there's quite a lot)
---
I just keep on making the points, truth does tend to get out, I had faith.    CCP is heading in the right direction on wars.
---
"Honestly with that much SP why haven't you tried out nul?"
---
To put it simply, I get attached to my ships and don't like losing them. And I'm not neck deep in ISK. 
---
We do have a channel dedicated to NSFW discussion and images. This does not include posting illicit images of minors. Child pornography or "loli" images have never been permitted.
---
gotta pay for that palatine somehow...
---
I'm not familiar with the Marshal.  Is that a new ship?
---
the downvote brigade is real
---
But what about linux users.... Dxvk has a long way to come yet and I can only see this messing with the systems current players are using to play on linux
---
..."or you lose your ship and pod."  
---
Yikes
---
Diamond rats spawn in systems with forward operating bases. They have more tank and dps then normal rats and behave more like players. Theres only blood raiders and guristas ones but theyll appear outside those factions normal areas
---
Please do! I can't wait to see what you people dig. I know what I have said so I am not worried.
---
Just know that people just need to go to your discord if you fake things.
---
&gt;SkillPoint Farming is an ISK sink 
---
The term ISK sink refers to activities that take ISK out of the economy like the LP store, market taxes, or alliance creation.
---
My fans are everywhere.
---
It wasn't useless. All that formula did was decide how much your wardec was going to cost. That is not complex. It actually should have been expanded more, instead of going with the dumb way out.
---
Can confirm, nobody is posting anything like that in the NSFW channel.
---
It is. Costs like 5b for the hull and has a jump drive. Gets more tank as your sec status goes up. You will obviously need an omega alt for the emergency exit cyno.
---
no
---
this will only stop client crashes due to memory, and even that theoretically. this will not stop the disconnects or server node melting 
---
Agreed that players who sub with plex have value. Also that real player &gt; bot &gt; skill farms in value they bring to the game when consuming those plex.
---
But a lot of plex-subbed players don't get that they're a resource, not a customer. And a pretty replaceable one at that -- there will always be more people who would *like* to play for free than there are plex to go around. A belief that CCP has some sort of responsibility to keep the guy who's complaining around, but not the guy that he priced out last month is pretty self-centered.
---
how often do these happen compared to connection or server related disconnects 
---
Yes, but you'd have to make a REAL goddamn effort to even buy a 32-bit processor right now.
---
TLDR was something about goonspricy and a lost gerbil
---
I'm a simple man, I see a brisc post and downventure
---
We'd definitely still be limited by the servers being unable to keep up with everything though
---
tidi slugfests have a lot more issues than client crashes
---
1. Low power stations deteriorate over a period of time until they lose all structural integrity and decompress. Since the station was low power IB couldn't dock their safety trucks, and everyone who has their stuff in there is losing their assets in a loot cloud. Of course the wreck is free to grab for any insolent Noctis. A week before the station enters low power owners and clients will be reminded to move their stuff out.
---
2. All existing Capital BPOs and Upwell BPOs will be changed into copies and only copies will be given out in the future. BPC's, as long as they're 0/0 can be traded on the regular market.
---
3. Readjustment of the capital ship and freighter skills, it's just my personal OCD, I don't see a reason why the freighters as items only require Capital Ship I, while the respective Freighter skills require Capital Ships IV.
---
4. Extension of the graphics templates for corp logos.
---
5. Extension of the shares functionality, introduction of a stock market.
---
6. Introduction of a more intuitive role management screen for corporations.
---
7. Resource count on Marauders will be drastically reduced, pressing their market price somewhere below 1 bil. Their stats will be reviewed and revamped so Marauders could also be deployed as capkillers (not as a solo, ofc).
---
Thought he uses a proteus, but idea’s the same. Freaky durable cloaky hunter with lots of tackle, then rr battleships to provide reps and more dps.
---
There's still people that will fight you to the death if you were to take their Windows XP machine away.
---
That Sabre feed tho.
---
Not really. High sec belt mining is minimal isk/hr
---
Best part, the Nag pointed the sabre, not the Bhaal sitting next to it. LMAO
---
&gt; This will lead to fewer crashes from **running out of memory** at least
---
  [laughs in 32gig RAM]
---
CODE, guys who after ganked me when i was bussy watching memes on internet guided me towards exploration, thank you, you helped me gain more fun from this game 
---
64-bit architecture has been around for more than a decade, so it's not an  exotic beast. DX12 is getting  begrudging acceptance from developers. But it's not like the 90's, where each DX version was just a minor thing.
---
And here it refers to your wallet. Ie you will lose money. 
---
The same argument was made when Trinity came out- "why are you upgrading the graphics when we don't have the hardware CCP?!"
---
&gt;slow whole teams down
---
You mean, the unpaid intern who they gave the password to the repository?
---
Who the hell still uses 32bit anyway
---
&gt;we add more pilots
---
Bots, maybe.
---
"I miss TIDI, it reminded you that a big fight was happening"
---
It's still an incorrect usage of the term.
---
https://www.engadget.com/2010/10/24/eve-evolved-isk-sinks-and-faucets/
---
&gt;Only a few game mechanics can be called ISK faucets, as the game mechanics actually create ISK from thin air. Similarly, the ISK sink mechanics destroy ISK or remove it from the game in some manner.
---
Saltvlad living up to his name hahah
---
how's Spatial Mayhem btw?
---
Do they show up on the overview like the TCU or ihub? Or do you need to Dscan or combat probe them?
---
I think the changes are great.  Especially if it makes some of the “elite” war dec corps come set up structures in solitude.  Can’t wait to hot drop them mercilessly on their way to and from the island.
---
Spread the word, no one recruit this corp, or anyone with that corp name in their history
---
exactly, I guess people are downvoting you because they're of the fearful kind
---
Nani the fuck?
---
&gt; It's damn near required
---
Obviously some opportunities to go "Ahem... but what about..." in this video, but that wasn't bad.
---
I think it might have been helpful to dedicate more than 5 seconds to the various slots, an extra 30 seconds talking about the pros and cons of shield vs armour, and what e-war is would have added a lot of value.
---
Maybe I missed it, but seemed to be a fairly big omission that ship hulls often give specific bonuses to different kinds of modules, which is hella important.
---
My first krab alt was fit the same way the moment I had skills to run sites...
---
who plays the game like that? Oh yeah, bots do. No one would actually fly as if they were botting after losing their VNI
---

  God dam that KB
---
This is a beautiful story. 
---
Raytracing in Eve holy crap.
---
Anomalies and derelicts are about to become insane eye candy.
---
honestly I do not know anyone who does this. It takes some time to progress a main through all the skills. generally paying for chars/isk/plex with cash from your job is far more efficient that trying to farm plex, or in this case, knee capping your main after some point.
---
They could make so much out of Eve by making spinoffs. Instead they decide to opt for mobile games and VR. I know I'd play any Eve related spinoff that isn't mobile or VR. Just give us anything honest; an RPG, an RTS, TBS, a MOBA, a shooter. It doesn't need to reinvent the wheel or be extraordinarily innovative. Just give us a good story set in New Eden.
---
If you think none of the stuff in there and your “weeb” room is depicting minors then you need Jesus in your life or something. 
---
The new site is here: https://fiction.eveonline.com/stories/chronicles
---
That old site doesn't have the two latest chronicles. The fiction site also has the old canon stuff from evelopedia.
---
I don't see the point to have such a complex formula for something that is in a sense very straight forward proportional....
---
tbh I've been kind of busy this week so I'm out of the loop. Although I did find time to get smartbombed.
---
No idea from data point of view, but from a personal point of view, I've never had a socket closed in a major fight - it's always been memory shit that kicks me offline. 
---
And every game-related forum needs a porn room in it. What a great group you all are. 
---
If you want multithreading-induced performance increase, you'd probably be looking more at shifting repeated, short calculations off their CPU racks onto a GPU rack. EVE is mainly performance limited on server side, not client side (memory issues excepted).
---
Shhh let him enjoy himself. I mean why not?
---
Ahh good to see that local chat is not changed at all
---
You're being very brave by not actually responding to the people you're criticizing.
---
Yo Here goes my bro...man i still remember the first vni you killed me in...the salt in my wound , loved to fight against you :D
---
Bigger games than eve have them; even if they put them behind 'only accessed with special roles'.
---
Can confirm, as person who plays with many accounts differences in local still occur, albeit much much less than early on.
---
No, green and short

&gt; For years Wars have been a plague on the userbase, they have made new players flee, have chased people out of the game, and overall have been an insufferable part of the game (everyone who knows about "elite pvp" should know what I am talking about). But behind the mechanic, there are groups and people that abused it and made it was it was. 
---
Is it really something that has made new players flee though? CCP mentions in the 2018 CSM Summit notes that new players weren't directly targeted, yet somehow the exodus of new players is STARK. Are you sure it's wardecs chasing new players away or CEO's that are telling their newly enlisted players how to act when faced with a wardec? Sure at the helm of their terrible advice is a wardec, but is there no other viable options than to stay logged off? 
---
Wars exist to bring risk, destruction, and content to players that would otherwise not see much of this unless they move into other areas of space. We're playing a sandbox game, and I personally believe that no area of space should be devoid of those experiences.
---
&gt; We all know those people, on the forums, in the game, even here, when people had valid complaints and made observations on what was going wrong, those are the people that would yell 'carebear', 'casual', tell you were obviously lying, that everything is fine, and you should probably shut the fuck up! 
---
Those words are typically reserved for the type of player that wishes to see the sandbox restricted or shrunk. They typically have only their safety in mind when it comes to operating in Highsec. If you look at most MMO's you'll notice reoccurring themes - when the developers start catering to a casual crown and start removing depth, complexity, uniqueness, and in this case a true sandbox experience you see that player count starts falling. Why is that I wonder? Sure I think it feels and looks good to get that surge of casual players that are now interested to play your game because the barrier to entry is much easier... but are they the lifeblood that will keep the game running? I personally don't think so. Yes Eve Online has been "dying" since 2003, but I think if you look at the timeline of such that you'll notice that it correlates with CCP making changes to make the game more appealing to casuals.
---
So yes about the name calling... passions run high, and they do so with you to. I mean isn't this why you came into the Wardec Project discord and said:
---
&gt;First thing first, I come in peace.  I'm gonna put it bluntly, this is Dantelion, I come in peace, all I want to do is discuss and actually see how everything that keeps happening can help make the game better.  If you are okay with that I will just stay around discuss from time to time and that's it.  If you refuse and ban me, I will drag each one of you in the mud, and that I'm pretty clear about that.  I'd rather just be around and discuss, I know I can be difficult but I *am* willing to make a discussion happen.  
---
&gt;Your choice.
---
That doesn't sound like someone who actually wants a discussion. That sounds like someone who is wanting to communicate in a way that best suits them and their set of values / beliefs. You've been banned multiple times there because of the way you talk to people and yet, we're the ones that use mean words.
---
&gt; \*\* The introduction of a WarHQ is a vindication against those people \*\*, it is one of their worst nightmare made manifest, having to put up or shut up now. It shows that features from the community being taken seriously is the solution to break the hold those people have on the game. 
---
Yes, I'm personally excited about the change but that's because I'm in Pirat as I think we'll be mostly unaffected and will be able to hold our own. There's a lot of panic among the smaller groups in that they feel the larger merc groups will now be able to bully them more effectively, but unless toes are stepped on I just don't see that happening. I can honestly say though that I highly doubt that you or others like you will suddenly fight back now that there's a win condition. I've love to see it happen, but when and if you lose I'm sure you'll be back parading around about how CCP didn't do enough!
---
&gt; I had to deal with them for months and all I got from it was the realization that those were an awful bunch *who used the game as an avenue to step on others instead of competing or growing with them*. 
---
Who made you stay, exactly? Were you not free to disengage from the Discord and go on with your life? Here's the thing Dantelion... you come in a Discord where discussion from both sides does happen, but it can get very heated because of how passionate people are on both sides of the issue. Instead of taking it with stride and cooling down at the end you choose to take it personally or take it to the next level. I'll just be honest with you though, when you start throwing around ideas that will drastically change (for the worse) gameplay that I'm personally involved in, I'm going to call you a retard and then explain to you why. You're going to argue back, and then it starts. Lots of players are passionate about the sandbox and players like you seek to destroy it.
---
If you can't handle discussion like that then again, you are free to leave...  no one is chaining you down and forcing you to read text that offends you. I dunno if you noticed but there's a LOT of differing of opinions between various players in the mercenary community and yet they are able to discuss these things without making a crybaby post on Reddit.
---
&gt; To repeat myself again, CCP listening to what the community has been saying and asking for years is a VINDICATION 
---
I disagree... We still have wardecs don't we? Really the only thing that changes is that mercs can better fight each other in a "put up or shutup" scenario, as well as those so inclined to try and destroy the HQ to end their war can do so. Sounds like great content to me. I would have waited to post this moral victory of yours until you see how it's really going to unfold.
---
&gt; All the people whose first instinct is to tell people to go away from the game, to tell people that their playstyle is not allowed, or that they are not "elite" enough for EVE, those people who use EVE as a way to drive people away instead of playing with them, this is a first step in making sure they don't drown out EVE's potential. 
---
Here's the thing... I think for the most part everyone wants new players in the game. We know that it creates a healthy environment and with that we acknowledge that there are all different varieties of players. The issue is when CCP stops caring for the long-time customer and starts pandering to a casual player. A player that will collectively destroy uniqueness, depth, and the sandbox-ness of a game should CCP listen to some of their ridiculous ideas and suggestions. A lot of these players make posts that scream self-entitled brat, and yes I know it goes both ways with how we can post at times, but the game is again... a sandbox and we're just trying to preserve that.
---
I'm not against good QOL changes, I'm not against balancing, but I am against CCP doing anything that places barriers between players in an attempt to "save the children". This is a sandbox game and has been since 2003. I think it's time you started learning how to play with the rest of us.
---
\----
---
So Dantelion, I hope you're able to see that you in fact are part of the problem. Enjoy yourself in the Sandbox! I hope to see you be the first one lined up to come knock on a Pirat structure!
---
Fuck me your the “attention seeking whore” Olmeca !!!! Or “Mr risk adverse!”
---
Old automation systems. Factories expect their machines to run for a good 30+ years before replacement. I've been in some factories with a windows 95 PC doing diagnostics on their "newest" assembly machines, as recently as last year.
---
do you know those people or what they do in their life, how they think or what they want?
---
as an example there's a thing in India for shitting on streets, to you and me it seems completely absurd yet it happens and is quite widespread.
---
Orbitting a rock does not require any manual input, the guy could literally just warp to the anom, press orbit then go to work or sleep or whatever.
---
Ah nvm, I'm tired of arguing, this game isn't for me I think...
---
I think it was more a case of the hecate pilot being bored because 
---
&gt;solo roams in 2019 
---
and taking a bad fight for fun than him being baited.
---
Yeah, but ANY improvement would be nice.
---
I think shifting the chat server off site was a good idea in theory, but something in their implementation is busted imo.
---
It would be interesting to see if they could do some custom coding to deal with the damage and velocity calculations in GPU racks...
---
it's a fancy limited black ops battleship 
---
You made me giggle, after the day I have had, I appreciate it.
---
64 bit client does nothing to help with TiDi, it will however help with having to relog a dozen time during the engagement.
---
You apologists are actually disgusting. I’m officially embarrassed to be on the same subreddit as some of you troglodytes. 
---
All of my replies are quite public. 
---
They only made this public as Mar5hy and co were going to farm the supers and release the evidence. Lets hope CCP removes the ill gotten ISK from the Alliance wallets
---
I think he was lauding the idea that we can finally run fleet fights with effects turned on and graphics on high without the client crashing from RAM use. EVE hasn't really gotten significantly heavier graphics-wise since v3 shaders on ships in like 2012 and modern gpus are way more powerful than what was common back then.  I know my 2060 and 1700x both sit at 30% use at the maximum multiboxing in tidi fights (still get 15 FPS though). 
---
"We do not condone or support child exploitation and/or pedophilia, and the moderation teams unilateral stance is that it is met with an instant and permanent ban"
---
Pretty big jump from there to "apologists"
---
I'm beginning to think you have some rather severe issues with reading comprehension.
---
Blue pancake?
---
Max on-paper dps.
---
*Hey just noticed..* It's your **6th Cakeday** JustSimpleQuestions! ^(hug)
---
A valid question. X4 Foundations only has Vulkan support and it is doing well for the most part.
---
Pretty easy to claim that they keep it clean. It’s not clean. The conversation and images posted within are beyond questionable. Get that through your thick skull. I have nothing to prove to you and I’m done trying to educate you. 
---
I think the problem was that what they were using wasn't designed for all the channel hopping done as a matter of course in EVE due to people jumping between different local chats. They seem to have mostly ironed them out now though.
---
Yeah, position/velocity vector and damage calculations were where my mind went too. If you got that working, you could use it as a basis for line of sight fire mechanics (semi-physically modelled) too. EVE ships zipping around a grid and atoms in a box are similar computational problems.
---
Those aren't respectable wormholers. It's fun small gang tightly knit communities, yes you have larger scale groups, but there's decent folks.
---
because it's very profitable.
---
For anyone wondering 32 bit can store 2^32 values, 64 bit can store 2^64 values or 4,294,967,296 times more.
---
Dude (OP) dont get bent out of shape with these weirdos.
---
Met lots of them in game and they make me laugh - they have to be the bully IG and on forums they have always had to run from sobbing from in RL.
---
Just smile and move on.
---
Benchmarks I've seen on the fallback layer make it seem like the performance gulf is so massive that there's no point to running it on non RTX gpus. One I saw was 325 FPS on a 2080ti with 10 FPS on a Radeon VII. 
---
Maybe useful for some sort of photo mode but certainly not the kind of thing you'd want to actually play on. 
---

Scrolling through your little gallery makes no sense at all.  Was there an audio component to the conversations as well, or do you and those other guys really have such tremendously disjointed conversations about vague, unidentified subjects?
---
tachyon more than mega pulse? 
---
From what I understand the global illumination ray tracing is particularly suited to EVE too. EVE basically has a single light source (the star) in most scenes which RTX is basically built for.  Just seeing the results from Metro makes me pretty excited and that is a game with a lot more complex lighting scenarios. 
---
Pretty sure yeah but I'm not near the game to check. You're not going to hit anything unless it's sitting perfectly still in front of the nose of your ship but I'm 99% sure tachs are the highest on-paper dps for a turret slot.
---
now the only thing of interest in K3J is pavel complaining about horder taking a dumb on the guristas lp market lol
---
Honestly what the fuck are you even talking about anymore? Of course there are tons of reasons why someone could do this. But every single time they exhibit the same behavior. You're twisting yourself into a goddamn pretzel talking about people shitting on the street instead of the obvious answer. They're fucking bots man.
---
&gt;The conversation and images posted within are beyond questionable.
---
Got any proof?
---
&gt;I have nothing to prove to you
---
I'm actually pretty sure that you just don't have any proof.
---
&gt;  I want this to be a story about New Eden.
---
If that's the case, some of the lore heads could provide you with some of the updates about how things are transitioning from the warlords of molden heath era, to the bosena accords, to the new elysians era.
---
&gt; The main argument for the 7 days is to give weekend-heavy corps a chance
---
That's kinda my point, though. If you can't drum up enough people to put up a fight in two days, it's unlikely you will in a week. hat's worse is it's not just a week. Timers in highsec can take up to a full two weeks to complete.
---
They don't even officially support Linux. One developer maintains a Linux launcher as a side project.
---
Majority of devs have more experience with DirectX, Mac users are a % of the playerbase at best, and Linux isn't even officially support by the game and never has been.
---
I still remember my first trial being right in the middle of the Trinity deployment and being blown away by the graphics upgrade. Spent a couple hours alone just sitting on the Jita(?) undock looking at the beautiful ships. 
---
My 7300 GS equipped Dell prebuilt could hardly run Premium graphics version of the game at 1280x1024 but was still an awesome experience. 
---
CCP doesn't officially support EVE on linux. But the DX11 client will still work fine through wine, so no need to worry.
---
Basically anything released in the last decade then. Much bigger list than I thought it'd be.
---
Random hi-sec semi-casual corp x may have 20 people on the weekends but 2 or 3 on weeknights.  Shit my null/wspace corp has comparable margins for weeknight:weekend.  Older gamers often have children.  That substantially limits your time on weeknights.
---
Point is, 3 or 4 days sets up the "Attack after prime TZ sunday &gt; finish before weekend" debacle that fucks groups like that over.  Unless you're talking about just reducing the minimum timer, but keeping the weekly timer, in which case that's fine.
---
\&gt; I dont think anyone is offended?  
---
\&gt;  reddit bitchbabies  
---
&gt;/s just in case it isn't blatantly obvious.
---
Come to one of my London goonmeets and meet the pitiless wrath of my hospitality,

Yup!
