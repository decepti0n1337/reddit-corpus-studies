Something similar happened to me. I have 145 billion isk in ship skins sitting in a container in Jita. One of them is a serpentis victory skin which has an apparnt value of around 10-12 billion. I've been trying to sell them for months now. I thought i was making good investments knowing that skins typically appreciate. Never dawned on me that they would be difficult to sell.
---
---
---
That's the point though. One season, mages are strong so they tend to dominate, the next one it's assassins and the following one is tanks. They periodically switch up the meta so that by the point it's figured out, they're already changing it. If something's broken or overpowered, they'll change it quickly enough so it doesn't become stale. Making it imbalanced is what makes the game fun and feel like it's constantly evolving.
---

---
Although, it might be harder to do in Eve online. You can't as easily say "missiles are op this season" since you're not doing relatively balanced 5v5 matches, but tweaking a weapon system that is used in ratting (and then, imagine all the different kinds of ratting from incursions, to missions, in hisec through nullsec and wormholes), solo pvp, small gang and large fleets. Combine all that with permanent ship loss and it becomes hard to figure out how much to tweak the balance.
---
It might be fun to see them try though, the general meta needs changing up.
---
I know right. Opened my skill que to see that mug starring back at me lol
---
Unfortunately I think CCP's biggest failing is their tacit policy of (almost) never removing anything from the game, usually just nerfing them into uselessness. The game could definitely benefit from a few tumours being excised but they don't have the balls to just reprocess and refund.
---
Roaming in BS? lol
---
As a battleship fan I can only approve this.
---
fyi, what dropped barely covered the costs of his being concorded.
---
The second one sounds awfuly like "we can play the game with them untill we win".
---
Why are you listing it as a bad thing?
---
" Right now, most large groups have little reason to attack other large  groups other than lulz and bragging rights.  I’m no game designer, **but  having something something else to fight over might stir things up**.  "  
---
Automated moon mining goddammit, weak as an ansiblex, no modules,  you can steal the fuel/moon goo (roamer objective) you don't need an brainless renter to suck your moon and bring you the money
---
I feel like refitting the capitals on a fly is a bit ridiculous too. It's a gigantic ship, it makes no sense you can instantly swap out modules.
---
The power structure of nullsec is not under CCP's control. They have NO power over the way players organize themselves, who they ally with, and who they fight.
---
Mechanic works fine. The problem here was the user's application to the mechanic. A loss like that suck's but should be a clear lesson to use a travel fit (or Bowhead/Ocra will work too I think??).
---
hey this is really sick man you ever do custom for others ?  
---
its pretty clean and well made props.
---
Seriously, go fuck yourself. You are personally one of the worst things that ever came out of the "too much intel" reality of EVE. The other one is the other dev that works with you.
---
Fuck you.
---
How are titans unbalanced? They are already weaker than 2 of the remaining 3 capitals. Sure they have their DD but thats not a game changer anymore. (Look up their original DD and tell me the current is OP) 
---
They can be killed fairly quickly if you bring more than feroxs to combat them. 
---
They have a bridge, but that is hardly anything to cry over. 
---
I agree there are alot of them in eve right now. I myself am nearing owning a 2nd titan. But this number could fall easily if alliances actually got into slugfests. We got close a few times like in x47 and ualx. But more is needed.
---
I started playing a month ago, and I've probably dropped ~75-100 bucks so far. I also didn't use the refer-a-friend feature, but I should have if I had known about it.
---
That got me a large skill injector, the smallest 2 DLC packs that just came out (35 day skill booster, some SP, and some omega time) as well as the 3 month omega time/3 month MCT.
---
That helped me get the very useful skills started, and set me high enough that I could actually do stuff. It also left me with a few hundred mil ISK.
---
I'm glad I did - because now I have 4 months left of omega time, an alt that is training up for PI, and I can do exploration and small-gang PvP at an entry level. Now a lot of skills are starting to take a few days, but it doesn't feel as bad.
---
That’s completely fair. Honestly I think the biggest issue currently is the insane mobility of caps. Has anyone on CSM considered a spool-up time for cynos? I think making caps slower to commit and slower to withdraw would do a lot of good. They would still be very much viable for stratops and bashes, but it would help reduce the current meta of using caps as blopsing ships (I.e. sneak up on a target with a cloaky cyno, light it, instantly dreadbomb it). This should absolutely be possible with dedicated blopsing ships like stealth bombers or T3Cs, but the fact that you can do this with super carriers is insane to me. Adding a spool up time of a few minutes would massively help to balance their mobility while still keeping them viable in their initially designed purpose.

Join "Abyssal Lurkers" channel ingame, people there will guide you. One of the builds I saw there was for Caracal for 35m isk that apparently allows you to do Dark Abyssal sites at T1-3.

Wow she really has a firm grasp of advanced minmatar architecture
---
&gt;How are titans unbalanced? 
---
Written by yours sincerely, a goon, whose alliance just did a whole deployment uncontested because currently the only answer to N titans is N+1 titans :p
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
But for a more balanced response; there is several issues with them. The main ones that I see are - extremely high range, can cyno instantly to any cyno in range, high tank, bosons + lances are extremely effective when stacked. These would be the areas I'd look to nerf personally, although opinions are of course open to discussion.
---
As someone who has been in your shoes, and is now in the shoes of the noob, it makes a big difference. Once I found people who wanted to learn, I loved to teach. And now that I want to learn, I really appreciate people who are willing to teach.
---
&gt;The reason capitals are disproportional balanced in terms of ship progression is because their EHP is more closely proportional to the amount of materials required to build a cap. So in in order to make your point valid, they would have to drastically cut down on the material cost.  
---
This is just a roundabout way of justifying in-game balance with lore, which is idiotic.
---
Balance decisions should be 100% divested from anything that sounds like "well it should be like this because it makes sense in-universe!!"
---
Please God no.
---
Excuse me, my opinions are my own, not my alliances. If you want GSFs opinion. Ask Mittens.
---
Holy mother of EULA violations
---
I agree with you and have made this point myself. CCP could create more things to fight over, or give groups reasons to stay and fight instead of running. But they can not directly break the human dynamics that lead to the agreements that create the 'donut'.
---
He's flying more? When did we learn that?
---
This really nerfs a couple of multiboxing strategies, especially in wormholes. Also hurts incursions a bit.
---
damn keep the spin up...not...not my friend..idk why you guys need so much attention geez....point is he didnt soloed the vedmak, the station did most of the work with the neuts...stop bragging about shit...you guys are Brave...
---
I like the eve where people can do what they want as long as they have the muacle to back them up. Like I said, I like the blackout. It's given the chicken shit weekend warriors some liquid courage so that they roam in to get blown up. 
---
I'll go even further. Cynos need to be allowed in wormholes and local needs to be delayed for all of Eve.

You realize we aren’t one homogenous hive mind that all thinks the exact same thoughts, right?

Literally the best idea I've ever seen
---
Slave equivalents for shield are on Sisi, so that comment won't work for long.
---
There are only a few weapons for which the meta 4 variant is significantly more expensive. For many guns the metas are actually cheaper than T1 (for a lot of other mods too) since they drop from rats at high rates. Never not use meta 1-4 over meta 0.
---
Not mentioned in the comments sofar: There's this mechanic the game doesn't teach new players about, which is overheating your modules, in this case guns. Best to [look it up](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Overheating).
---
Other options:
---
1. Team up with other players = best option
---
2. Improve DPS on your fitting: Change to blasters guns, use meta 4 ("Arbalest" guns)/T2/faction modules and ammo, use more damage modules or change ship.
---
They have indeed been nerfed and/or changed in the past, along with every other capital ;that doesn't necessarily mean they are balanced currently, or that CCP did a great job of it previously.
---
He realizes that removing the carrier role of fending off sub caps literally kills the carrier right? That is the only point of a carrier is to be support for a capital fleet. If anything, buff carriers so they get used for more than just ratting anoms.
---
The frigate sites are not really meant to be done solo, and in T2 sites you can get spawns that you cannot out-damage unless you have said blingy retribution. I have done the frig sites but while multiboxing 3 ships. I can tell you that 3 hookbils can reliably run T3 darks (I did it in a single T4 as proof of concept but it was really tight). If you cannot multibox, then bust out the friendship. 2 hawks can run up to T3 darks reliably.
---
Or gathered 100 upvotes but whatever man
---
&gt;10 sentries based on drone interfacing skills, then another five based on the level of the carrier skill.
---
Wow server will dead. I think drone should adopt now fighter launch system.
---
&gt;How would getting rid of injectors be a long term solution to super and cap proliferation? I honestly am asking, is there something I'm missing?
---
Because a new toon could not instantly be able to fly caps.
---
&gt;Like aside from the sp give aways and that one starter pack, the sp influx rate into the total serverwide sp pool stays the same regardless of whether injectors exist or not.
---
But SP is fungible, and it shouldnt be. SP used to be "locked". Now toons can train anything and it can translate into titan 5.
---
Only if he can extract it, I believe it fuels his cynos

Surely you have to agree that at the very least EvE can't go back to what it was.

As for cynos in WHs. Now I know you're an idiot.

If you have ever thought for yourself and weren't shit scared to play eve you may actually find a few things out about the game.

---
Sorry. No salt. My killboard is up billions since blackout. I can be successful without feeling like it’s good for the game.
---
If you are solo, when you run into your hard counter, you can die or run. Not fun and simply badly balanced.
---
&gt;while C is trying to fuck A, B is trying to fuck C and their A is trying to fuck your C etcetc. that is the beauty of it, it becomes about strategy and tactics - just like a real battle.
---
It creates dependencies and makes it even more difficult for players to do their own thing. One thing that was killing the game was wardecs, which made it difficult for small groups to form corps.
---
It also allows any ship to exist no matter how broken if there is a hard counter. It doesnt solve any problem.
---
&gt;im talking about nerfing them, its just a question of how. just taking some EHP off them wont actually do anything to the core of the problem imo.
---
Restrict injectors. 5 min delay on cynos. Very low damage to subcaps. Then we can see what happens.
---

---
True and frankly being absolutely perfectly honest I do enjoy the inner Hell and odins and Volta gangs coming in.  Tons of fun.  Everyone gets some kills.  The problem is they all come in all judgemental throwing insults about how null are nothing but carebear trash blah blah. We don’t judge them/you for loving your wh.  We love that you love your worm holes.  Where it really breaks down is how horrible trash you guys are when you roll in.

Fun Fact: Vince Draken is SRP'ing the Snuff Dread losses with fitted hulls in Hakonen, leftover from the last Goon Deployment to the north.
---
Rumor is that Snuff is disbanding.  This loss has revealed to the line members that mandatory mining ops to fund the SRP wallet have been directly feeding Tau's midget Siberian eskimo porn addiction.  Members are in revolt and demanding their titans replaced.

The irony of your post is delicious. You want to be listened to because you think "I'm a little guy, I matter." Big yikes there chief.
---
Believe it or not, people who can maintain a large corp and build infrastructure will always shit on the smaller corps. That's just how the game, and life, works champ. It's not ccp's responsibility to balance the game around small groups of people who've been kicked out of the big corpse because they're too stupid to shut up in coms and think they know better than the fc. 
---
And the fact that you think little safe spaces should be maintained for multiboxing wormholers that krab all week so they can blow a few ships up on the weekend kinda shows what side of the carebear line you are.
---
There are jackdaw first that can point and tank a Kiki also a sentinel can not only tackle a Kiki but can shut that shit down hard. I have made it out by the skin of my teeth fighting sentinels. Those things are amazing.

I ran over from Jita to see the fireworks and would have caught the end of it...then my screen greyed out entering system and had to log...Thanks CCP

Vertiso tackled a bunch of snuff titans with awoxing hics :'(  Never thought we'd be betrayed by him.
---
Change capital remote reps into capital remote hardeners.
---
Two fleets shooting at each other where neither can break targets isn't fun. Sustained firepower on a single target should eventually break it. Make more than alpha important in fleet fights.
---
Subcaps can still take down capitals if they don't have overwhelming reps, it will just take a while.
---
Oh, I am sweetheart, happy as can be. Sorry you're not but that's the way it goes.

None of this is invalid - skill injectors distinctly need tweaking. Shouldn't be able to have a 1 day old character in a titan.
---
In this specific case though, I'm looking at their current state in terms of large scale warfare. They've become too easily replaced, and as a result of more being made now than destroyed they're more prolific in that sense.

What about salvage drone IIs?

I understand all that, I own a super and am not far off a titan if I wanted to go that route.  But right now, this game is essentially over.  GOONS won, and they earned it.  So what's next?  They just keep going around the map in a circle with 1k titans burning every structure someone puts up?

This game will always be best when there is an active jockeying for position and the politics that come with it.  That is all dead right now.

Logically a nerf to one thing is a buff to something else.

The first scam I ever fell for was buying up a large quantity of mines from someone near the RENs trade hub. My noob as figured I would be able to plant them near the Amamake gate to deal with those “damned pirates” who killed me every time I tried to go through there. 
---
Yeah, I feel even more dumb now reading that.
---
Frigate sites are built for 3 players; 3 guys in a T1 frigate can do T2-3s, but a single frigate doesn't do enough DPS to do them in the timer without some serious bling.
---
If you want to solo the higher ones you need to use cruisers.  Well fit non-bling T1 cruisers can do T2s, maybe even T3s.  Single boxing anything higher will generally require a relatively blingy HAC/pirate cruiser

---
Take a look at dotlan, choose 'Events', hit the change you are intrested and maybe you get the ad back

Thanks folks. This pretty much clears it up for me.
---
The game itself is fine. There's plenty of stuff to do. The people just take it way too seriously. Like to an unhealthy level. Anyone that talks about losing their ship as more than just "Well, shit. Guess I'll just have to get another one." Is way beyond anywhere I ever want to be.
---
I completely get that people invest time and real money into this game. But they should do that with the expectation that they will lose that at some point. Whether it be through losing it to another player or through the game being shut down one day. Because nothing is permanent.
---
Call me a casual or whatever. You're right. When it comes to playing a game, I want to treat it as such. A game.
---
Good luck
---
I think you're saying "T3C" when what you really mean is "Loki".  And yes it's hard to want to talk about T3C balance when there are much, much larger issues.
---
&gt;They'll always have bigger/better/blingier ships and higher numbers to ensure they win engagements.
---
&gt;The guys who are now dropping caps on you have more force to multiply, and will continue to do so.
---
You have no idea what you're talking about.
---
It's not numbers that allow large groups to shut down any sort of roaming or guerrilla warfare in their space.  It's not blingier ships or better versions of subcap hulls (both of which are trumped by piloting skill more often than not).
---
It's capital ships.
---
A single person with a super and a fax alt can shut down most roaming gangs alone - especially if they have an umbrella to fall back on if they happen to fuck with the wrong gang.  They don't need to be good at the game; they don't need to outplay anyone or even know anything other than the very basic mechanics of how their ships work.
---
On the subcap side, numbers may win timers, but they don't always win engagements.  One of the best things about EVE is that it has not just a steep learning curve but also a high skill ceiling which allows for smaller groups of strong pilots to win fights against larger groups of worse ones.  
---
This is the cornerstone of small gang, and even though it doesn't always work out, it's an incredibly important concept.  If small groups can't fuck with larger groups in any meaningful way, the name of the game becomes blob up or quit.  
---
And that's exactly what most people have done over the last few years.
---
They should play them all, yet it seems we constantly get clumps of nothing but pvpers and not even all aspects of pvp at that. And then thats the major thing that gets changed while the rest of the professions, aspects, and parts of eve age and become more and more unballanced and left in the dust. Eve is a pvp game but pvp alone will not make it run, so constant shitting on the non pvp aspect of it or ifnoring said sections will not keep this game enjoyable or ballanced or alive.
---
I agree with almost every point and really hope CCP listens
---
It's a classic, the energy of this guy gives me goosebumps. It reminds me of the feeling of the first successful bomb run we did deleting over a 100 tempests.
---
What if, and I'm just brainstorming here.
---
Capitals in highsec. Naturally no offensive modules, prop mods etc (say hello to bumping nano nidhoggur - code)
---
Yep.  In fact, nerfing cap application to subcaps is the largest (reasonable) buff you could even give subcaps.

Something new for the sandbox, at least it’s not the same old ideas. Would mix up the meta a bit but would need some balance. Would be interesting to see them take charges with long cool downs and overheat for some extra distance lots of room here for fun.

" A single person with a super and a fax alt can shut down most roaming  gangs alone - especially if they have an umbrella to fall back on if  they happen to fuck with the wrong gang." isn't a single person though. It's an organized coalition using the mechanics and techniques as intended.

in dark abyss optimal penalty and speed bonus. you always must shoot webs first and never stop your ship. all triglavian havent [f](https://falloff.you)alloff, only optimal. you can overheat your Afteburner and fly away from vedmak to drop dps. and you can overheat thermal resist. against drone BS you have transversal. you need to fly up to him diagonally. about 30 degrees. when you're in 10km press orbit 500. this work and with drifter BS.   i only 1 time use exile booster against spawn with drone frigates withs EM damage.

I mean he's not wrong. Even fraternity at one point was one of those, I remember having fights with them in wicked Creek when they were only taking one or two systems in WC/SP, going around with 20 or less dudes in a fleet, basing out of H-AFOC in Curse. Now look at them. Do those alliances go away from this? Dunno, but if there's a chance they could, it seems like something that should be scrutinized very carefully.

And I'm mainly talking to the high sec plebs or small gang pvper's who want to be able to fight organized null blocs and expect to get "dank frags" without expecting a response (or being able to respond) from said null blocs.
---
Eh killed a krab, is this /r/eve worthy nowadays ?
---
Haha, now you know better with this community. Instead of accepting what you said at face value they will run this through the rumor mill and next thing you know there will be Jita riots because CCP didn’t delete caps and replace them with pink dick butts with the micro transactions to customize it even down to 80’s rock band hair.
---
Yeah, tell that to Comcast, lol
---
Damn, thx for the answer tho
---
Just with extra cream cheese?
---
But that new toon will still eventually fly caps, and assuming the rate of people wanting to fly caps exceeds the number of cap pilots leaving the game, you still have more caps than you started with.  All removing skill injectors does is initially slow the ramp up. And again, nothing stopping a dude from running a cap pilot farm and selling the toons to those who don't want to wait.
---
Yeah, I'm good. Part of the motivation is earning money, otherwise I'm just waiting on skills. Plus if I really need money, can always just find another WH to fly into with a venture.
---
Now multiply that by goons
---
im guessing you've never roamed in a battleship
---
Imo of you want to and have the funds, go for it. Not all of us have time to grind out a good chunk of isk. In the end it's your money and your choice so if it's 'frowned upon' or not shouldn't matter. If you grind IRL and want to have a bit of fun, $20 or whatever it is for a bil and a half or so it's the same as a couple beers at a bar...and it'll last longer too.
---
400m/hour how?  Asking for a friend.  I keep trying to do PvP out in low to learn how to fly frigates, but the gate camps are REAL

---
You should delete this cancer and be the hero the game needs.
---
For the purposes of actual conflict it *is* a single person, and often only a single ship in space.  
---
The point is that this kind of gameplay helps no one.  It only results in less fighting, less ships destroyed, and overall a far less enjoyable game for groups of all sizes.
---
Well 2500 unique players... with most of them running multiple accounts thats still a lot, i would say probably over 10k, maybe even more.
---
Really, don't let anyone tell you how you should play eve. If you feel you want to be in a ship you're not in, and that ship would allow you to have more fun, do it. I am pretty sure being able to inject into a Proteus kept me playing this game, as it allowed me to fly a much cooler ship and actually contribute to a fleet in a meaningful way (at least I thought at the time). In the end, if it makes you want to log in and do stuff, and you have the money, then it is worth it.
---
We need a blog of Falcon ideas. Or like, just make a mega post about your ideal Eve.
---
How is this still being misrepresented? I guess some memes never die
---
Seriously - this alone would fix half of what's wrong with null.

what is this roaming you speak of? does that mean jumping when theta wrangler calls for it?

Sorry, all I am hearing is CCP_Falcon for CSM.

I posted on the EVE facebook group something similar the other day. My dude looked like he had snorted lemon juice.

What if we just hate your posting instead?
---
Wow what a bunch of fucking cry babies. If you honestly think this single program is what is killing the game you are a moron. Stuff like this is nothing more than a symptom of the larger problem. This isnt even new. TEST had something like this back when they lived in fountain. Maybe not as automated but it worked well enough to save people but that was back when ratting was active
---
GSOL puts TEST to shame, but on an IT level I'd say we are probably even. But as far as I know no other groups have the infrastructure goons and test do.

Hmm. Odd. I’ve always thought they weren’t worth the effort IMO. But to each’s own I suppose.

So, OP just stay in High sec until your proc and T2 adaptives.. but even then you will occasionally die for not having a mining permit.

Well that's pretty much what I expected, a complete lack of understanding how EVE economics works

they're worth a couple of billion at most to some collectors. Now if you had an Asp mine or Cobra mine bpos they would be worth way more since they are rarer.

But just in case you're serious, [here](https://cdn1.eveonline.com/community/csm/CSM-WHITEPAPER.pdf) is the CSM White Paper. The related section of the rules of eligibility:

&gt;CCP employees, ISD volunteers, CCP interns, CCP affiliates, CCP strategic partners or employee sof other gaming companies/gaming media and family members of CCP are all ineligible to run for the CSM. In cases were an active CSM delegate becomes involved in any of the above activities they must resign from the Council.

Oh yes. I believe you. Lol. No really. Lol smh

FUCK SNUFF

Most of the ships in game are only shit because of the massive power creep over the years. People in this thread arguing for more buffs maybe don't get that. Not to say that power creep is strictly bad; it isn't good or bad per se. However, advocating massive buffs to subs because you spent time training carriers makes little sense to me. If Leshaks were buffed to the point of easily soloing carriers, your SP in carriers would be essentially wasted just the same as if carriers were nerfed into the ground. Personally I'd rather see nerfs to a lower level generally just to slow down the game, but that isn't a proscription just a preference.
---
\[removed\]
---
How does that works with 2 titans? Seems to have a decent average for one pilot, but for too?
---
And how does the big cooldown works after the first annomaly?
---
this is exactly what our corp has done.  created a wing of scanners with one of us on at all times.  I'll hop around within a radius of the fleet, do scans and try to find some operation going on somewhere, report it back to determine if it's worth the flight time.    Makes it feel like reconnaissance activities actually have a real purpose again, and not just alts sitting in stations all over logging in and out to count the number in local.
---
Add it to your systems to avoid so you dont accidentally get routed through there.
---
Who?
---
I don't like it because frigates are already too popular
---
I don't think they're mental. Their points seem well thought out. So please highlight the problem?
---
Fun was had, would do again.
---
Last played in 2010. Fired it up tonight for the first time since then. Where is the wallet button on the Neocom?
---
no more capital ships.  There are enough as there is, I like the idea of going back to where we came from a bit and getting rid of force auxiliaries.  I like all the ideas presented here as well.  I like the no local, it would be better if CCP would implement the esi endpoints that make dotlan and the ingame map also free intel.
---
It's happening!
---
Because at this stage the bottleneck is not materials to build the ships, it's pilots to put in them.
---
If you have a single pilot and infinite resources, it doesn't matter if titans cost 100x or 1000x or 1,000,000x a battleship, it's still stronger.
---
To be fair I saw very little actual ree and mostly posts about said tears n ree, i think most of it was under the assumption of mountains of ree, then when you ask for proof you're usually met with 'go onto eve forum's or linked to a clear bait thread

At the point in time when bullets can pass through the interdimensional walls. When firepower takes up the entirety and eternity of space and time, all beings stuck in a neverending life and death cycle as bullets recover and destroy their bodies in quick succession. No one is able to think about anything but the sheer force of the bullets rapidly flying literally everywhere in the materium turning the warp itself into nothing but a sea of automatic weaponry... Then there will be enough dakka. Or, at least almost.
---

---
More I believe,
---
Yeah! There are so many, and they are so fast and so cheap and versatile with many having specific roles that no other ships can fill! Who wouldn't hate frigates?!?
---
/s
---
\^ As my flair suggests let it be known that removing drone bunnies has the following side-effects, presumably on other wormhole groups that use a subcap ratting doctrine with Nestors.
---
1. Our doctrine Nestors tend to be a little steep in terms of SP, so we tend to give the drone bunny role to a pilot who can't fly one, so they can participate and make isk with us.
---
2. Nestor pilots have the sole responsibility of maintaining focus on their logistics responsibilities. Having to monitor drones on top of that makes their job rather difficult.
---
Thanks Vince and Brotherhottub for the dreads!

You're getting downvoted because your grasp on what actually happened with the drifters is short sighted and dumb, pvp' can't 3rd wheel the drifters they'd be instantly killed just as fast as the defenders

Because the base premise is just stated and never proved so the entire process is starting from a flawed perspective

Ohh for a spy alt, nice one. ~~Sometimes~~  Usually thinking about eve is more fun than playing.
---
Cool thing about game design is it is fluid there is no right or wrong.  You try shit and see what kind of crazy shit the players do with the mechanics.. then turn knobs.. or hit them with a hammer and put duct tape over the hole.
---
Good idea -- that way our intel aggregator continues to work, since it's not NEAR2, and everyone else gets screwed. I endorse this plan of action.

I mean, he probably didn't look anywhere, so his claim that he didn't see anything prohibiting it, might still be factually correct.
---
Boson ratting in 2019 with no local.
---
You just *KNOW* he never pressed dscan once.
---
I was in a kiting Condor and started a fighter with a Hookbill just off the Customs Office the other night. About 30 seconds into it thinking I was about to bag a nice kill the damn drifters warped in and shot us both until we each warped out.
---
Shit, if CCP did this I’d probably resub all my accounts and return to the game. Why the hell aren’t you a developer again?
---
Is there a link to this character bazaar? It sounds interesting.
---
Wow i se i hav lot of hat from peopl. mayb they look in mirror and see they are hard but i fuk u up wit my titan and suprcarer.
---
This isnt the real world. 
---
In the real world outlaws get punished, not encouraged. Should we adapt that to Eve aswell?
---
And I dont think I am missing the point, I think people are begging for regression, for a time long gone when small gangs could actually hurt NS. That balance cant be reached without significantly altering NS and most importantly, driving off a huge part of its population.
---
The idea of what Eve should be is no longer realistic, yet people are clinging to it. And thats the red thread in all of these posts, yet none of them actually point out the fact that the balance is dead. No matter what you do, its not coming back without massively hurting the game.
---
So how about we stop looking to the past and actually start changing for the future? Small gang want content, there are plenty of ways to do that.

The Podcast is pretty good so far. Both of the guys doing it are very competent. I'm a little bias as Blood Ruin's youtube channel got me into LS pvp.

The point of the mission is to force the new player to think outside the box, this can be by fleeting up, or by going up in hull and weapon size.  Dagan dies like a bitch from a cruiser on up.
---
I don't know man, it doesn't look like those changes would scale any better than what we have now.  It wouldn't create a more persistent universe, significantly alter force projection, or how groups create a sense of territorial boundaries or fundamentally change how people pick their friends and enemies.
---
The real problems with caps is based in logistics and enemy avoidance mechanics.  Whatever it takes to fight them on the field is just whatever it takes.  Escalations, elaborate means of keeping certain ships from abandoning fight.. it's all bullshit.  **To be honest, just make non-covert cynosural fields a 100k PG module and have done with it.**  It's not a panacea, but it sure would go a long way to making things better.

I didn’t. He was offering ways in which I couldn’t control the intel / security of some area of space, and I responded with counters to those points in the form of methods to control said space
---
Realtalk props to g00n for attempting a big play knowing full well their dreads would die no matter what. It's not easy being the guy who has to make that decision to sacrifice all those capitals.
---
With that said, this fight underscores the terrible nature of large fleet warfare in tyool 2k19.  The goon Abaddon fleet had to deal with the AIDS of attacking a fortizar under neut bursts, damage bombs, and point defense thingy.  On top of that, they dropped 100ish dreads and still weren't able to kill a titan. This is not an indictment on them but rather on FAX still being overpowered and dreads still being shit in comparison to said fax. 
---
From my perspective as the vanquisher pilot guy, I got neuted pretty soon on jump-in and before I could fire my doomsday :smith:
---
A lot of good ideas in here. Big fan of the rework of highsec and Lowsec. Like anything else I’m not a fan of some of it (can’t please everyone) but most seems solid. Take the updoot
---
minus all the salt this is a nice wallpaper o7
---
Snuff drops Titans on a fight as a big fuck you in low sec? I'm shocked! Shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!
---
Its under finance I believe.
---
I dislike this the most.  I remember the days of escort fleets, before all the cyno highways.  
---
I'd much rather see freighters get nifty defensive command bursts, and the ability to teleport defensive forces to their position.  Slots all around, slots for everyone.
---
Kill Jita while we're slaying unicorns, and bulk up most production logistics to localized production.  Add some simple meta 0 invention to the mix to make life a little less hard on the younglings and their logistical supply train.
---
Can you just self destruct for using FAUX so many times?
---
&gt; A lot of people have been raging on and on about the existence of the application and it making kills impossible. The thing is, the shitposters actually have a point when they say you are just bad: Not many people actually use it and we believe the impact is minimal, at least the NEAR2 part of it.
---
Mate, the impact of your app is dogshit. And your user count is actually quite high given all the unique people interested in null krabbing.
---
But you don't need to be apologetic about your app. You are providing a community service for people of a certain playstyle who might be interested. Game mechanics are responsible for giving you the capability to create apps with dogshit effects. It's not on you.
---
Alternately, just force capital repairers, remote and local, to use charges.   Couple that with bleed through damage and permatanking is as extinct anything going through the current great dying.  
---
One species is going extinct IRL every single hour, so don't feel too bad about anything virtual.
---
Ah, the old but venerable Minmatar State Flying Space Nailgun
---
if someone is flying a super and doesnt have his own fax alt they should biomass.
---
The problem are big blobs. If you ever find a Supercarrier alone and you have a gang of 10 retributions you're gonna kill him after defanging him. Caps are extremely vulnerable when they are alone yet everyone cries they aren't (obvious exceptions to HAW dreads). I'd go to argue that but I prefer save time and downvotes
---
This here is why I made a thread about nerfing ewar resistance.
---
Part of the problem with capital application is that it's very difficult to cripple a capital ship with ewar. 
---
On paper, a max-skill, T2 rigged Crucifier cuts ~63% tracking or falloff (via script) per T2 TD. Apply two of these max-level TDs to a Sieged Revelation, and it only loses ~40% tracking/falloff.
---
That in itself is great, but the inability to scale ewar onto a target is a problem.
---
Just curious what mines better a expidition frigate or a t1 mining barge? Both with t2 modules.
---
I was mainly just curious if the expidition frigates are meant for going into lowsec or nullsec and day tripping as a miner to get what you need for industry?
---
I mean, its HAC online atm. Subs are still very much used very much more than caps in any real fight. I dont get why people are arguing that theyre not?
---
Even if you deploy bigger things its not without controlling the grid with subs.
---
TL:DR
---
&gt; But back to the point: those complaining that their PVEing miner target got away, because of "near2", You are probably just bested by the simple combination of teamspeak/ mumble + large blue donut alliance with some people actually watching the entrances of pipes. 
---
Got'em
---
This is one of the reasons I have 13 years in the newb corp.  I like to answer questions people have about the game and ease their transition into other things.
---
So... I cant find a skill calculator. Like Put in that your attributes are and see how long it would take to get amarr battleship 5? Or trying to find the best attributes to pump and what skill to train to SP farm to cover my sub.
---
Thanks!
---
Where do i sign?
---
Moving caps and supers will be an even bigger pain so no one will move or deploy.
---
Deploying subs will be pointless against the defenders still with their full cap fleet.
---
Will just end with everyone still just krabbing up in their blue donuts.
---
Do it! I would be 100% behind these changes... I think between all of us, we could raise enough money to buy 51% of Black Pearl (roughly $1 billion at current valuation), we just need each subscriber to r/eve to raise $10,000 and we'd be set and then we can appoint Falcon as Space Dictator for life
---
well... looks nice but these changes will make ratting in supers/carriers history, am I supposed to rat in a rattle for 1/4 isk/h? you underestimate the amount of people that will unsub over this lol
---
TLDR: ships exploded and fun was had.
---
t2 mining barges. most use skiffs now to prevent highsec ganking because thats cancer now. All ore and materials can be found in highsec moon mining now id look into that.
---
Such can be addressed economically though.  Anytime players discover a strategy that reduces their risk, you just keep making it more expensive.
---
Sometimes you just have to make the play for the enjoyment of the game. When you promise your guys a bloodbath, and have nothing but love in your heart for old school BS+Dread brawls, it becomes an easier choice to pull the trigger, even if its only for 30 seconds of that nostalgic bliss. 
---
That said, the fight really does continue to illustrate how ludicrously powerful FAXes are, but more importantly just how weak dreads currently are compared to FAXes+Supers. It'll be a glorious day when dreads finally get the massive buffs they need.
---
So let me get this straight. Ill use the example above, the guy says 50+ Maels to alpha carriers at around 500k HP. So supers/titans will get 2 shotted by regular fleets? 
---
You dont see an issue here?
---
I mean, the ideas are not bad, they just dont leave room for reality. Big ships are balanced for big groups, you want to balance big ships around small groups. But there is no way you can do it without absolutely destroying the ships.
---
It's a nail gun
---
Lol no dude. Thats not how things work. Cost is always the determining factor.
---
Yeah as the 0.0 embargo starts all the T/ ships with spiderwebs on em in the back of your hanger start to go up in value.
---
Was fun. Time to build some more dreads to lose.
---
Or just have some percentage of bleed through damage.  Eventually, with enough fire on something, it will eventually succumb.  
---
It's not as satisfying to go up against a more formidable foe and not even leave the paint scratched.
---
To be honest, structure damage should not be repairable by a module.  It should have to be done at some sort of repair facility, and cost a stack of some item, not just some fee that can be waived.
---
If they did this tomorrow, it would be awesome.
---
Realistically, injectors only remove a temporal dislocation between the present and an underlying problem.
---
Very much. Its literally regression and not progression on this sub. All the ideas are somehow anchored in the past even though too much has changed since then.
---
glad you guys came. gf man.
---
I'm pretty sure that was the entire point of the citadel rollout.  However, some design branches didn't bear fruit.  The achingly slow starbase phaseout is simply a gardener playing for time.
---
Fraternity has been around TQ for over a decade now, and last were part of N3. They were not ever a small alliance, they remained connected to NancyDot, and had the full backing of its Chinese corp when they pushed to actually take sov, and their numbers have exploded to such a degree that they have become a major power, but they are still panfam friendly and aligned. They are not the "independent little guy".
---
Blobs have been an issue forever, N+1. i think a solid buff to dreads would be a good start and remove HAWs
---
OP, I'm no doctor, but I think you've got Progeria.
---
I'm down. Change all fax into carriers, refund isk/sp
---
The problem with battleships isn't hacs, it's battle ships. First, they warp a lot slower than even the next size down sub cap. Combine this with their huge ass lock time and you simply can't catch anything for gate camps or roams, and for brawls, you're better off growing straight to dread if it comes to that. Their tank and dps doesnt separate them from battle cruisers by that much, despite being massively more expensive and pretty badly hampered by comparison. Simply put, battle ships need some work.
---
&gt;Historically, the CSM **was** governed by a White Paper. **While no longer in use**, you can find it here.
---
I read that bolded part as a "this thing no longer applies".
---
Always keep local separate and visible
---
Ye, even though your words are harsh they do ring true. It would stop any logistical effort of any sort for pretty much everyone except the biggest groups. One could however designate areas where cynos dont work, like in FW space, but there would have to be ways for travel around them (without bottlenecks).
---
&gt; Maels to alpha carriers at around 500k HP. 
---
&gt; and Supers/Titans anywhere from 4-5 million
---
the cynos in lowsec and and no titans / supers i do not agree with. 
---
the anom one is easily sorted just add restricted warp gates and make all anoms dead space
---
everything would be fine
---
Im not in snuff and I can tell you its a really bad idea. All capital movement would have to stop and the ones already in possesion of them would rule all of low sec. If you think the game is stale now you should see what that future would look like, nobody ever wanting to move their caps offensively.
---
Everything else in your essay aside, I feel like the Titans' original sin is that they do dread DPS but don't have to siege.  If HAWs are oppressive on titans but not on dreads, that seems like an extremely relevant difference.  (If you think HAWs are a unfun everywhere, that's different.)
---
I wonder how much of this would be solved if you significantly reduced the enormous damage bonus that titans get, and maybe reduce them all to 4-5 guns to lean into the "capital-size command ships" concept.  I just looked them up, and they all have these 180%/level damage bonuses.  (except for the Leviathan, which is weird and has a much higher rate of fire bonus)  At level V, that 900% bonus is more than a Siege Module II (840%), along with twice the guns!  If you turn that into something like ... and here I had to remind myself just how big a 10x damage increase is ... something like 40%/level, HAW titans would be doing essentially battleship damage.  You'd still have all the other advantages: doomsdays, jump drive, a massive pile of hit points, etc.  Some of those might still need to be rebalanced, but they wouldn't *also* be excellent dps/pilot on top of the doomsdays and stuff.
---
Besides, the "My Erebus can match a Megathron for dps" whines would be amazing.

I see no complaints about titans. Go be lame somewhere else.

i don't think he's complaining at all.
---
Faction Warfare had potential... but it's been wasted so far. In fact, the idea of separate races is kinda wasted in general.
---
I liked when Alphas were limited to their chosen race of ships. It made the decision meaningful. And it made the choice to upgrade to Omega meaningful, b/c you earned the right to diversify.
---
But as it stands, you can play a Gallente pilot, flying a Minmatar ship, with Caldari Navy fittings, fighting for the Amarr militia... and that's totally fine. The races don't matter, b/c they're just flavor text most people gloss over when they're reading about ship stats. Nobody really cares about the backstories for the ships, or the races, or the reason why the Damsel keeps going back to her abusive Pirate boyfriend. It's just a wall of text between you and the next thing you get to shoot.
---
If you want these types of things to matter... then they need to have some kind of game mechanic relevance. That's the only way most players will pay attention. If a Gallente pilot flies a Gallente ship with Gallente Navy fittings for the Gallente militia, they need some extra little perk to justify the devotion to the cause. Otherwise people will fly whatever they want, and it won't matter.
---
Which means nothing honestly. He isnt allowed to play any relevant role in any corp/alliance/coalition due to CCP regulations. Which means that his perspective today is only as a solo pilot, most likely roaming low sec. Thats as much relevant as the solo miner in HS honestly and the opinions are extremely microlevel and not macro. Changes (perhaps not all) like these would be horrendous for the game.

If you let carriers use sentries those will start to be used for anti subcap stuff again. Other than that its all good.

I read "ruin the party" as a bit of a complaint... It's not a positive phrase...
---
Here are some Youtube links to some good content -
---
* Low Sec Frigates: **[Blights Wretch](https://www.youtube.com/user/KnightSmiley96/videos)** - Great and informative videos, starts his videos with a little explanation of the Ship/Fit then has a montage of fights. He walks you through each fight to explain his reasons for what he is doing or could have done better.  He's been uploading 1-2 videos a week for about 6 months now. Really great stuff for a newer player!
---
* Kitey Garmurs in Low Sec: **[Yumenoshima](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOvlZxLAfFhUbRCTXnjVL8A)** - Uses blingy fits and expensive implants, videos don't offer much for explanation but his use of the **Tactical Overlay** for manual piloting is nice. I had always struggled with manual piloting but for some reason just watching him do it this way caused it to finally click in my head. For learning purposes I suggest you start with a different kitey ship like a **Condor** which is about 10-20mil fitted or a **Slicer**

---
I find some good pilots like those suggested in this thread and follow their killboard, it'll help you get an idea behind some of the fits and allow you to save them into the game.
---
A trick to using zkill is you can search by different criteria, so if we wanted to look at all of Tomalak's kills and deaths in frigates we'd search by using: https://zkillboard.com/character/95574399/group/25/ (the **character/95574399** means Tomalak) and the (**group/25**) meaning all frigates. You can search by individual ships as well if you wanted to see all Merlin losses etc. Using that will allow you to quickly start building an idea about which ships you can fight and kill and which ones can kill you.
---
I feel like I just made a very similar post in the other thread suggesting that titans' original sin is that they do the dps of two dreads strapped together but don't need to siege.  You took it a step further and asked, essentially, why capitals need to do 3-10x the damage of a battleship (depending on weapon choice, and ignoring tracking) in the first place, when it's not like battleships can do 3x the dps of cruisers while matching their tracking nor 10x the dps of cruisers if you ignore tracking.  (comparing short-range to short-range or long-range to long-range in the latter case)
---
Tbh, i took all my pve pilots out of space. I just buy shit from high sec moon miners now and build stuff in stations with occasional cynos and jump freighters. I used to be a dozen rorqs, a few smart bombing bs fleets, and the occasional ded runner for people to come shoot at with a couple blops/test fleet pvp pilots. Law of unintended consequences, now I'm a few jita and perimiter station alts, a shit load of indy and cyno alts, and a couple jump freighters. Long live the blackout?

&gt; titans came in to ruin the party.
---
this is really nice honestly it is, its like a painting or a movie poster 10/10  
---
you get the pewpew approval :)
---
Ye, but Im talking about full fleets. 256 man fleets would 2 shot them by your own math. You are seeing this from a small gang perspective, not a full NS on NS fight. 
---
So lets nerf all the frigates in the game. Because by your logic the more of something there is the harder it should get nerfed. Thats meh.
---
But what you can take away from this is however the fact that the game cant be balanced in the old ways anymore. You cant create a situation in which LS and NS have the same power ratio as before. These ideas are all regressive and an effort to recreate something that is already dead. Perhaps start thinking about a future in which small gang warfare and big gang warfare is no longer connected and start balancing with new assumptions.
---
Prospect too.
---
Everything he said is basically the same thing before the capital changed back in 2015 and before.... and in that age, ppl use slowcat to sit on battlefield ignoring all the giving reasons. I don’t think that’s even fun for subcaps to shooting plastic bullet to a metal wall
---
GF Goons - everyone likes a dread brawl
---
&gt; EDIT: lol TIL how badly you can potentially fuck up a buy order.
---
I once put an extra 0 in my order for 1000 compressed ice blocks.  I'm pretty sure that's small potatoes to some people.

Same, 1.5 billion typo
---
Wow; I remember when T5 darks were &lt;5M.  I wish I'd bought more and just sat on them...
---
Another stellar victory for the biggest and best independent group in the game
---
Ive made typos costing a lot. But when I was the benefactor of a typo (someone adjusted their buy order on a Praxis in Rens from 85 mil to 850 mill), when he asked for consideration I gave 75% of the profit from that back to him.  
---
I asked him to pay it forward and commented that I wasn't sure he wasn't a newer player and that even 500 mill wasn't that much for me, so didn't want him to get discouraged.

I like this version of “spool up” better than the other ones I’ve heard. Fixes the fastest/best response is capitals through a cyno
---
Oooooo what’s his YouTube channel? I want to check it out
---
Explain to me how they would 'rule all of lowsec' if they cant jump those caps around?
---
I agree, there should be no penalty to security status if you fight inside a Faction Warfare complex as a Faction Warfare member.
---
What usually happens is a neutral (pirate) character enters your FW complex and does not agress unless with scram activation. So, if you're kiting/scram kiting/all in dps fit you're basically forced to agress first and that results in massive security standing loss per day and eventually isks  you pay for tags.
---
Please, hear us CCP.
---
I trained into slowcats just in time for the removal of triage.
---
Seems to be a theme in my eve career, anything I train gets nerfed into the ground. 
---
Might be time to train into a loki
---
Something similar could be made about PI materials, T3, or drug production.
---
thanks o7
---
As someone who's sorta new to Eve, and doesn't partake in anything large-scale, this is exactly what it looks like.
---
Like, if it weren't for that spoof "This is Eve" video, I would've continued thinking it was solely in good humor.
---
Oh man, if that's your bar for complaining NEVER get a girlfriend.
---
I agree fully with the capital aspect, people have created a narrative and are going full retard over it even though they are by far not as oppressive as stated. Its very situational and the very idea that caps can be deployed without sub cap support, as people are arguing is being done constantly, is a massive joke. Subs can easily shred caps that are unescorted. But the thoughts and ideas are seen from a small gang perspective which well...
---
Tethering was introduced to disallow station games which are pretty horrific. I dont know a good change to the issue but please, dont bring back station games. It was just awful (still is). But I dont see a problem with citadels, I see a problem with materials. Its not the sotiyos that cut down the cost, its the ore thats dropped a lot in price. 2 years ago a titan was worth around 60b whilst today its around 50b. Its a Rorq problem.
---
But citadels being able to be used in such various roles for that low cost is also a joke. Imo CCP should introduce a new citadel with only 1 purpose, to be dropped offensively. Now that one can have limited tether and a higher cost and so on. But since the moonmining changes its pretty much impossible to limit the amount of citas in home regions since moons needs one.
---
what about a boyfriend
---
There’s enough politics in Eve without role-playing. Just watch The Meta Show on Saturdays as an example.
---
Are they 3d or 2d? Anything 3d is bad m'kay
---
https://i.imgur.com/9UBy0sh.jpg

Easy fix here would be to make marauders bastion cycle do relatively massive bonused anticap damage.  Baby dreads basically.  Maybe also give them a baby jump drive, so they could go like 2-3ly,  Blackops already has a jump drive, so the other t2 battleship having one would make sense, no bridging though.
---
If they had a role that was useful they would actually get produced and would probably come down to a relatively reasonable price point.  So long as they came in at like half the cost of a fit dread or so.
---
The idea would be easier to move in hostile space than dreads and a shorter jump distance, so they could be gated or jumped into a system quickly, and deploy for a short jump onto capitals.  They could also be staged into astras or raitarus and establish an anticapital force into hostile space.
---
Not as hard as managing t5 pi
---
3d lol
---
Good joke
---
Forcing groups to stay to one section of space or another limits content
---
there is always the one doucher who attempts to farm the "*goon tears*" karma isn't there
---
I see np with 500 man fleets (by the above calculation) alphaing a super. Just like I see np with 500 man frigate fleets currently alphaing a BS or even a carrier.
---
My logic by no means nerfing frigates or popular ships. You are doing a straw man here. My goes like this. 
---
1) Rarity, inaccessibility and price of ships justify OPness of ships to some degree (e.g. AT ships)
---
2) These are less strong balance factors in the post proliferation Eve.
---
3) Therefore, the OPness of capitals is no longer justified and should be fixed.
---
This argument doesn't apply to frigates or anything else.
---
I don't engage in faction warfare specifically because the the standings ramifications.
---
True... Poor goons... I dunno what I was thinking
---
I've been looking for this video for a long time, thank you for sharing. o7
---
&gt;Make marauders have a point by making them baby dreads specialized for quick in and out attacks, and specialized to apply to cap ships.
---
so a dreadnaught
---
You keep posting this. I don't get it.
---
What if we're all alts :O
---
But does it make for a better game?
---
I mean, the ideology behind Eve being a harsh environment and all is great but I mean, is it viable? And why is only viable for one side? Why is only NS being hit with it? And why hasnt the other tools been updated for this new reality. You cant just delete one thing and not change the tools that have been created to work in conjunction with that one thing. 
---
And when, at which point will we start saying the blackout is actually bad? If we are ignoring its side effects? Right now it feels like no such point exists and people will salute it no matter what.
---
And lastly, you say "weak do not survive". Yet no local and every other nerf being talked about is literally to aid the "weak". At what point does this harsh environment actually become relevant for all parties and not just one? I have no issues with harsh, I know it will hit smaller groups harder which imo is bad for the game, but I do have an issue with hypocrisy. 
---
If we want the wild west, fine by me. But in the wild west small outlaw groups would never ever be stupid enough to cross bigger organised groups because they would get crushed. Right now all Im seeing is blindfold and tie the hands of the bigger groups to allow the smaller groups more "content". Thats onesided harshness, nothing more.
---
If these changes happened, I would consider living in nullsec, right now as it is, I'll stick to subcap fleets in wormhole space tyvm
---
&gt;If they had a role that was useful they would actually get produced and would probably come down to a relatively reasonable price point.
---
That's not how input requirements work
---
Crazy, soon as you described what happened I had a feeling it was Team Kusion. Check zkill more often, check pilots killed in space, don't fly around in stuff that screams "gank me!!!".
---
I can jerk off to this.😈
---
Hm, it’s almost as if words have multiple (and sometimes racist) connotations.
---
&gt;relatively massive bonused anticap damage
---
so leshak
---
I knew t2 exhumer were better just was wondering what's the point of the ore bonus yeild to expidition frigates. 
---
What all is highsec moon mining missing I've heard lowsec and nullsec moons are better.
---
Have you any real data behind "the killboards show otherwise"? I still havent seen any analysis of the killboard which makes any discussion about kills anecdotal.
---
Basically a baby dread, yes.  Easier to move and hide, easier to stage into enemy space, cheaper and not requiring a 5 minute siege. Weaker in dps than a dread,  maybe role bonused resistance against cap ship weapons systems is that could be a thing.
---
Ideally I want something that couldn't stand up in a large slug fest, and something that subcaps would kill, but something that could threaten ratting capitals, or sloppily dropped groups, or yoloed supers, or whatever.
---
I think there could be a niche here that could be filled, but it would have to be done in such a way that it didn't supplant dreads, just allowed for a subcap anti cap option.
---
Do you mean CCP Seagull? Think she quit or got fired a while ago.
---
r/nocontext
---
Sure, so don't paint it as if the only people who thought this would be permanent were people excited about it.
---
\- 3 dreads 10/10 reshipped ready to roll
---
why would i spend like 3b on a maurader when i can just spend 1.5b on a dread that can ownzone caps better
---
Like, a dread does 9kdps, a leshak does 2.5k or so,  I would like the marauder to come in able to do say 4k or so specifically against caps.
---
How come titans don't seem to be able to do much other than sit around and take damage?
---
I roam the area. Had been wondering what was going on. Was a bit of an "Oh shit! WTF?" moment a couple of nights ago when I saw 134 people in Frarie, mostly Goons. And you scared me when spiking a nearby system earlier today.  
---
Even if you lost the ISK war, you probably won as a percentage of your total available resources.
---
Ok, I know jack shit about t2 production, you got me there.
---
This is what peak performance looks like.
---
Jealous.
---
It's not about resources in an literally dead game.  It's more about giving 0 shits, knowing what's coming and going in anyways because at the end of the day 200 nerds want to have fun, and Cainun provided it.
---
DM me and I'll buy all of them for a fair price above buy.
---
Gee it’s almost as if some of you guys just want to totally delete anything bigger then a battleship.
---
Control what players do by introducing instances (abyss) goes against the sandbox idea , which is the very thing that set eve sooooo apart just make it WoW 2 blizzard willing lol.
---
I still think skill injectors was the biggest mistake ever, it allows for overgrowth  of caps and botting because it’s no longer based on time.
---
Make eve Elder scroll online or terra plz ! Let’s be like all other pay to win mmo, s sad day 😞 
---
All these cap problems is because of to manny people can get them to quick because they can use skill injectors which if  it stayed time based like back in 2014 half the fools wouldn’t be in caps. Instead arise the vni botting , China isk shops buy more skill injectors produce more alts and it spiral out of control, but rest assured now CCP made there money .... greed the very nature of the game .. eventually will be it’s own doom.
---
and I am clarifying that I am referring to a horde of rabid raccoons
---
I see a couple of issues in Eve related to what you are presenting. The first one being that people wish to balance small gangs with big gangs, like it used to be. But completely disregarding the fact that 5 years ago you didnt have 3 megablocs and thousands of titans. 
---
Even if you nerf supers/titans/NS you still have to contend with a vastly superiour force in terms of manpower and isk. Its just not possible to balance anymore and the only result we will get by trying is making people quit. Instead focus should lie on generating small gang vs small gang content.
---
Secondly, the biggest reason for stagnation is just that, no reason for NS blocs to fight. No real reason atleast. We need a why and a how because the third reason is to actually make warfare viable. Atm its an absolute snoozefest to even try to fight. And ontop of that there is no reason to do it which just freezes everything up.
---
No local will have zero effect on the real issues, it only affects small gang vs big gang (and small big gangs, smaller groups in NS). And in that department people are already clamoring for more. It will take nerfs for years before people finally realise that it wont work, but by then a lot of NS will have simply quit the game because their playstyle is dead.
---
In short, Eve is dead, long live Eve. The game will never return to the good ole days and people need to start realising that.
---
Price would really be the sticking point.  I think there is a niche for an anticap subcap, and I like the thought of making a marauder able to fill the role better than a lot of the other dumb ideas I've seen, like the numerous times I've seen guys trying to press for an anticap heavy stealth bomber or some shit.
---
Lol, so much this.
---
give blops non-haw dread guns like stealth bombers have bs guns
---
you weren't that's the problem.
---
The only thing I really disagree with is the complete removal of HAW dreads - I think HAW dreads are a nice escalation path, however, perhaps tie their tracking ability with fleet support and make their effectiveness more dependent on titan bonuses or something?
---
Bosons are really funny and hilarious, but I totally understand how OP they can be. Perhaps an alternative is to make bosons like a polarized weapon that removes all resists? This might be an interesting trade.
---
I think you guys should re-visit deployables on the next big release. We got plenty of ships with specialized tasks - now would be a fun time to start assessing various strategic implications of dropping deployable structures for \~special effects\~ i.e. add thermal damage to a kinetic damage doctrine, increase group speeds, buff a specific resistance, **call in NPC reinforcements of a specific faction**. Each deployable should have a respectable risk vs. reward of course (cost) - also perhaps a way to sink the excess pyerite / isogen / liquid ozone in build cost.  **Also mines would be an interesting reintroduction.**
---
Dude, retention numbers. The only reason the game we have so many newer players is simply because NS groups recruited new players. Without the big blocs the game would be in so much worse shape than it currently is. Sure they had there reasons for recruiting, it wasnt all selfish, but the point stands. Yet people are constantly bitching about big blocs. Even though they havent done anything but tried to gank the little guys.
---
I mean... Sig Radius increases/decreases chance to hit already, having it affect repo amount doesn't seem unreasonable off the top of my head.
---
Osprey Navy is actually the street fighting cousin of the caracal. It's better in almost every aspect!
---
technically you don't have to pay for tags. just stay in low-sec :) it might be annoying to reship, but that's where other people (corp) or alts can help
---
I'll show mine if you show me yours
---
There are already mechanics that do that. I cannot go to high sec in any real way as a low sex pirate. Despite me wanting to high sec gank, that's a totally different life style
---
Go try to take something in lowsec of value and see if you ever make back the investment. I'll wait.
---
I've often got more fun running around in a frig/dessie/cruiser
---
You are extremely naive if you think Falcon is doing this without indirect or direct permission from the top. They  know they have to do something to save the core game or they are gonna eat it.
---
He's in V0LTA and still does Bombers Bar stuff
---
You are blinding yourself. The bigger groups are hardly blindfolded and tied up by Blackout. They potentially have far better ability to see abs react to what is going on in their space than anyone else. Learn to scout, learn to communicate, learn to cooperate, and you will see that Blackout is not hard. 
---
Additionally, as far as your other points were concerned... In the Wild West, small outlaw groups did not try to build cities and factories. There is room in Eve for small outlaw groups, but they should not expect that room to be in sovereign Nullsec. Or if they do, they should not expect it to be permanent. 
---
The Nullsec people I have respected the most over the years are the NPC 0.0 groups. They generally do a good job of playing the outlaw role. If they have the opportunity to expand, they do, but they never expect it to last. They know they can live in Fountain or Syndicate or Curse year after year killing sovereign Nullsec dwellers, without ever being eradicated. They usually displayed reasonable small gang skills. They usually have a PVP-first attitude.
---
Shit looks like a page from a Reactions V skillbook
---
Rapidlight loki is still a thing. The 100mn dumbo isn't.
---
Because highsec doesnt seem to be designed for large scale fleet engagements, whereas both low and null are.
---
A Leshak is also faster and has a smaller sig radius. I don't disagree that the 'shak could do with a buff to maximum spool damage, say from 150% to 200% (if I'm remembering my numbers correctly), to make it even more of a threat to capitals while not making it too punishing against subcaps (because, let's face it, if a 'shak's firing at you for that long then whether it's doing 150% or 200% damage doesn't matter, you're dead anyways if you're a subcap), but Leshaks are already a fairly large threat to caps.
---
"Little Guys" have always been at a serious disadvantage in EVE as far as I can remember. I also remember going from an alliance that lived in an outpost that only one guy was repping when it got damaged, to controlling a region, to becoming a member of the new 'Band of Brothers'. Lots of shit and disaster in between but the same thing that built that is the same thing required today: Years of time and dedication from people who want to make it happen and work hard against the odds to do so.
---
It also seems odd to me that so many nullbears are crying now and preaching "this doesn't help the 'little guy' at all, it just hurts them and helps us!" Same shit I recall hearing about Rorq nerfs, "they'll never be able to catch up!"   
---
The blackout is not the end all and be all of changes but it makes damn good sense. Cyno changes next plz.
---
Could make it do more damage based on sig radius.
---
Fraternity is probably more powerfull than NC/PL and equal Horde they are the only big bloc (in Panfam side a least) using the "new" Rorqual umbrella meta, Panfam just begin, and they hold Legacy (2x their size) without any constant help of Panfam (just big timer where the Imperium come too)  
---
seem like an independant group to me

There's no such thing as 'end game' in eve. This isn't fucking WoW with purple loot
---
Nice write up. I used to really enjoy your fleets. It’s good to see you back in game.
---
What about sp loss from t3 to caps  instead but no nerfs mate?
---
imagine that you were getting stalked and they monitored your pornhub activity - the second you blow the load they bust into your house and try to kill you and steal all your stuff.
---
this is basically boson ratting
---
Yeah, the triage changes can't be rolled back.  It was a seriously good change.  Making carriers a super drone platform and making supers the only fighter/bomber platform isn't a bad idea either.  
---
I kinda disagree on one titan change though.  Give the titan a few dd's to pick from.  Different sizes and shapes so alliances have some flexability in deploying them, and defenders a selection of tactics to dodge them.
---
Ehats wrong with some brojobs between frienemys?
---
or make it complex enough that optimal play is not easy to achieve..
---
I mean come on, chess?
---
This is great. The arguments are very theoretical and mostly based in old knowledge. People are calling for new nerfs even tho the old ones have actually made a difference. Which kinda says alot about the people who are crying for more changes.
---
And everyone needs to stop talking about Delve, its so fking boring and moronic to use them as an example for everything.
---
Don't forget to cast Magic Missile at the darkness.  Space is big.
---
His suggestion neuters titans, so people will extract their titan pilots and fly something else since you only need so many titans before they become redundant in a fleet, while stacking dreads/carriers/supers keeps the n+1 dynamic.
---
In real life people arent flying around and killing eachother in spaceships either.
---
They should never bring back the bonus drones thing.  Its laggy enough in big fights.
---
Yeah, even from a small gang aspect capitals are actually in an okay place if you can replace them. The highlight being in the latter camp.
---
Dromi's need some work, and I don't think Supers should have 2 wings of support fighters since they basically have their own subcapital support fleet at that point. That, I think, is one of the main points they try to hammer on with all the capital complaints right now.
---
While I agree station games are gross, and tethering is a way to fix that, you could also limit the tether radius on engineering complexes to the point you can't sit a 50 man ferox fleet inside the tether and just wait it out if you can't engage the enemy fleet. Same goes for carriers and dreads - they can just sit on the tether and idle, jump out if things aren't looking good. That's my main complaint with tethers right now.
---
I've been thinking about the idea of implementing forward operating bases, instead of engineering complexes. Mini-citadels you can dock battlecruiser or smaller ships in(no jump freight) and produce just enough fuel to run itself inside. A small tether ring, doesn't tether capitals, or show up in the overview. You'd have to go looking for it like you would a POS, just with a quality of life upgrade compared to a pos. And less able to defend itself, of course.
---
I'm not certain it's a great idea - but it might work.
---
Also the Rorqual problem isn't going away any time soon - even with all the recent changes. I think just limiting the amount of supercapital industrial slots that are open per system/region is probably the best option. That way you don't have 3 sotiyos in one system producing 20 supers each every 3 months. Instead it's 20-30 Sotiyos across an entire region to keep up with that level of production.
---
Now, as a little guy that would hurt a little bit for building a supercapital fleet, but I think it would make the value of having a titan go up and make them less prolific due to the restrained ability to make them, and partnered with some changes to make engineering complexes less defenseable you'd be able to launch incursions into enemy space to hit their production like you were once able to before citadels were a thing.
---
Training my cyno alts to cov cynos would be annoying...   But the reduction in cycle time and the cost savings of lighting offgrid would be nice.
---
You guys, shut up before fozzie hears you.
---
Train your thermodynamics to V before using any pyromancy, it's important
---
Since they are the superpower in low, they could gate them? Have cap caches spread out? Like anything that the other side cant do/have?
---
I got sniped by a HAW rev just the other day at like 100km or something crazy.
---
Well to understand why they work so well in those ranges you have to understand tracking. Tracking isn't calculated from the turret nodes themselves, rather it's calculated from the centre of the ship shooting. Because titans are so large, something moving around in front of them functions like it's about 20km away. Because of that they can apply their massive guns better than dreads can. This is why people are thinking that hey, maybe HAW's on titans is just a bad idea overall.
---
TL;DR:  
---
Mega can rail that, Erebus can blaster that because of the way the game works.
---
Oh amamake... She used to be so much fun before citadels.
---
Well, thats the issue. You dont see.
---
You are saying the are to casual to remain OP, which could be said about anything. You are completely disregarding the SP or the hull cost and you are straight up saying fkit, just kill all supers/titans.
---
Atleast just say it straight, you dont like them and you dont want them.
---
Are there any girls there?
---
What does legacy donut mean?
---
Oh, there are G.I.R.Ls, sure, but they have balls and furries...maybe Krabs too
---
It won't solve the issue. It will only frustrate those that put the time and money into getting one. Goons have the numbers. They could just as easily drop overwhelming dreads, or subs. They have the finances to drop them over and over until the other side is defeated.
---
It's a difficult issue to handle and I don't believe that this is the way to go about it. Dumping on thousands of players after they spent so much effort getting in those ships is not a good idea. Subs still have their place. They are the leading killers no matter what statistic you look at. Goons have a ton of supers but they have only been deployed a couple times this year and have nowhere near the kills that subs do. The focus shouldn't be on them.
---
There is no easy solution. You can take what goons have done and learn from it. Becoming an industrial power to rival them could lead to some amazing content. They figured it out. If a nerf does happen, or some huge change. Goons will out produce and still roll other alliances. Probably even more frequently after the change because it would be easier to build up.
---
Of course, these changes are just my thoughts personally, I'm not a game designer and most of them are terrible, but I'd also couple them with a few fundamental changes to how caps deploy too.
---
So basically a reddit blerf from anyone at all?
---
Its not just about the Blackout. Its all about more and more changes to balance LS to NS. Nerf caps, nerf cynos and so on. Its all part of the same thought.
---
No and they didnt attack the cities and factories either. But in Eve that can happen without any real danger. 
---
But you havent really answered my question, when does it become a harsh game for the small gang? Why is every change an effort to weaken NS so that the weaker groups can stand a chance when being offensive? Isnt this quite contrary to your statement about Eve being harsh?
---
Im saying, everything should affect everyone. Not this BS about how NS needs to be harsher whilst everybody else gets it easier. If you are weak, dont attack the strong. And if you do, dont cry about getting slapped.
---
Huh?
---
This literally breaks wormhole caps. No local reps and not cap boosters ends the solo triage carrier/fax

a goon guy saying "before the titans came in to ruin the party" lmao
---
Good ol' fashion cainun AAR, not enough shit talking though.
---
Welcome to eve guys
---
This is a first: logi reps on the cyno inhibitor. LMAO 
---
Dafuq would you rat in a titan as the ticks are comparable with super ratting which is 4-5 times cheaper.
---
I want to see the day when some stupid eve player will fly a shitload blingy titan to PvP people and boson the shit out of them in their home systems. That would be a honorable way to lose it.
---
thats what i do but at 6s that one scan pass takes an excruciatingly long time
---
Carriers without fighters.... um ok
---
No shit, Sherlock. Thanks for the FYI.  /s    
---
Some mechanics do need to be changed, but no amount of mechanic changes will ever counter the negative narratives too often poured into the ears of eager new players.    
---
As above, even simple things like using a free alpha account to buy and haul gear can just as easily be made to sound valued and appreciated, as it can be to sound boring, stupid, and punishing. If you don't get that, you're going to be blaming ccp for a long time to come.
---
Can't read that font.
---
Looks like those memes where the skull cowboy says things like "Goddammit Mom you were supposed to buy Grape Snapple you STUPID BITCH."
---
drop a suicide dread, kill them all, be isk positive.
---
I agree with most of what youre saying. But I still dont think it would work with work slots. Thats how it used to be (in a sense) and it was pretty bad honestly. The change was really great from a qol perspective. Whatever change gets introduced I hate for it to be tedious because nothing kills the will to play more than tedium.
---
But I honestly dont have an alternate suggestion so this isnt me trying to knock on your ideas in that sense. Im just presenting it from my viewpoint. I like your ideas because they are focused on real issues and not made-belive and out of resentment which seems to be the main ideology in this sub nowadays. But some things are regressive and will bring back much of the things that were really horrible before. If those things can be avoided then fk ye, bring on the changes.
---
Meh, you should've seen those massively autistic borg bubble cubes before CCP added bubble decay.
---
Damn, that's pretty nice use of the dark's bonuses. I'll definitely be trying this fit once I get around to training missiles and Amarr cruiser.
---
This paints such a shity fucking picture of how the PVP actual feels when you are the one doing it. You can tell the poster isn't one of these people.

Above is a killboard of one of these \*rorqs saved\* referenced by the above blog. I can produce \****countless***\* BRs like these from blackout or even before when tackled whales were "saved". The ability to provoke a group to defend and respond has produced in many cases, more fun than just killing the target to be saved. 
---
This is propaganda Dunk. Be more honest.
---
As I understood the post carriers would loose local reps completely but maintain remotes. If you bring a lot I fear it dominating the meta aswell although with sentries they would be dead in the water against sniping dreads (or anything else that snipes for more than 120kms - Ravens eg) unless you bring support so there is that.
---
Praise the sun
---
The current supercarriers (Nyx, Wyvern, Hel, Aeon) were officially part of the 'mothership' class until the Dominion expansion in 2009, where the class name was changed to 'super carrier'.  At the time, it was strongly hinted that they were being moved to make room for a new and improved mothership class that was a better fit for the name; but nothing ever happened with it.
---
video please!
---
Welcome!!
---
I think a large part of your proposal hinges off Marauders being cheaper per warm-body than Dreads. 
---
The last time I did industry, Marauders were constrained by the cost of Moon-Goo. 
---
Without the cost coming down, you just have a Dread that sieges for 60 seconds, not 300 seconds. If that's the case, then you might as well just reduce Dread siege times.
---
I remember those times fondly...
---
Laughs in ceptor
---
He is already at Dagan, so the at the end of the Epic Arc , by now he should have some cash.
---
except when you have multiple characters that all fly multiple jump drive capable ships of different races... has happened to me many times, come back to staging after op, drag &amp; drop from the wrong choice of your stacks of fuel on one of the toons, oops your Thanatos now has Hydrogen.
---
Tbh if goons dropped supers half of you would cry couse supers too stronk und too many of them... I might be wrong tho
---
FK it just kill all supers and titans.
---
35 titans... Yikes.
---
I keep forgetting that sentinels are giant jerks and that I should make a solo nullsec sentinel fit. Thank you for reminding me.
---
Is anecdotal someones fridge word of the day or are people just repeating words they hear? 
---
I just mostly like to make shit up so I can bait pretentious douchebags that post on sock puppet accounts in to arguing with me.
---
feeling cute, might stick alt in idk. 
---
On a side note, how the fuck can you not love how far beans have come haha. 
---
\*waves fist in we are at war\* :D
---
Also a logi main!
---
im sorry friend, weve killed a literal shittonfuck of people in amma, lately ive been getting killed a shittonfuck haha, maybe i should put the weed down when i solo &lt;(&gt;.&gt;)&gt; &lt;(\^.\^)&gt;
---
m8, come through. you will ALWAYS get a response in ama. &lt;3
---
Mulchy you know I at least make something of an effort to avoid shit talking &lt;3.
---
Wow I just looked at what those bubble cubes were and I’m not sure if I’m supposed to be impressed or terrified.
---
Wow.  Is it just me or was EVE WAY better looking in the effects department back then?  So much fire rippling off things.
---
Can confirm. I have zero expectations when it comes to CCP.
---
Thanks for the info it’s much appreciated.
---
Don’t mind the silly haters.
---
Then ask for proof instead of sledging them. Seems pretty self explanatory to me.
---
Buying PLEX for ISK accomplishes many good things like
---
\-  keeping the game alive
---
\- Providing those who lack money or motivation to pay a way to ISK -&gt;  PLEX  their accounts to Omega
---
I would say overall it's a huge positive thing for the game.
---
You're totally lost. If this is what you truly believe I hope you win eve soon.
---
I remember something of learning skills to Upgrade my clone Status (something clone insurance thingy) or stuff like Training an off grid booster Alt that finished skilling a few Weeks before CCP announced the Change of boosting.
---
Those things happen and will always happen.
---
No refund needed. Play/skill at own risk.
---
You define success by ISK, you ISK tanked his loss of loot against people who he defines as fail.   Loot denial is a very effective strategy by AG, and it is you who is moving the goal posts.
---
Did I call you a hisec ganker?   Certainly not, you are a shrill for them, but whatever rocks your boat.
---
Never go anywhere near Uedama, not sure what I have lost in terms of that and I have only ever lost a thrasher to gankers, Russians at that.
---
Seems to me your argument is about capital capacitor injectors. Not FAUX's.
---
There are some ships that have a low skill requirement you might look into as well. Personally I like using a Gnosis on Dagan. They used to be pretty expensive but I think everyone just got a free one with the 16th anniversary. 
---
I still have some Frankenstein dual tank drone boat gnosis laying around somewhere from doing this mission with my wife.
---
The issue with them was that if you went into HS and someone activated them, CONCORD would have a word with you. They'd have to fix that.
---
Yeah if you're making a spy alt you have to come up with clever ways to hide anything that could tie it to your main. I'd not even risk going through market like that. Safest way I know is to buy something like plex on your main, then meet your alt in space in a DST and open your fleet hangar, and then pick it up with your alt. That way there's not ESI trace.
---
Or you could just buy some plex on your alt's account, but not everybody has IRL cash to spare.
---
&gt; You are saying the are to casual to remain OP, which could be said about anything. 
---
No. You can't say that about anything. You just insist on completely ignoring my argument.
---
AT ships are overpowered. If everyone used them, it would have been a huge ship balance issue. Thankfully they are expensive.
---
Officer modules are overpowered. If everyone used them, it would have been a huge ship balance issue. Thankfully they are expensive.
---
Modules with really good abysal rolls are overpowered. If everyone used them, it would have been a huge ship balance issue. Thankfully they are expensive.
---
Keepstars are overpowered. If every citadel was a Keepstar, it would have been a huge ecosystem issue. Thankfully they are expensive.
---
You you "can't say the same" for the above items".
---
Now, titans and supers are overpowered. If every pilot used them, then it would have been a huge ship balance/ecosystem issue. But they are no longer as expensive/inaccessible. So lots of people are using them. And it does become an issue.
---
Meanwhile, frigates, or other subcaps or t2 modules, are not overpowered at all. They were designed around their cheap price and availability. If everyone used them, it wouldn't be a problem at all. Everyone does actually use them. So you "can't say the same" here too.
---
Basically, you can make my argument on only stuff that has exceptional capabilities that would break the game if more commonly used, and that has become significantly cheaper recently (which means directly mined t1 stuff due to us talking about Rorquals, injectors and ISK inflation).
---
&gt; You are completely disregarding the SP or the hull cost and you are straight up saying fkit, just kill all supers/titans.
---
No I am not. But it took 50.000 + 60.000 PLEX (new PLEX) to purchase char + to buy a titan when the battle of B-R happened. And the char supply was limited. Now it takes 37.500 + 12.500 PLEX. A titan costs less than half what it cost during B-R. Replacing it costs less than a quarter of what it did. So give us a break with how much it cost for you OK?
---
Ahh yeah, I'm largely in the same boat. I've been playing the game since 2011 and honestly the difficulty is what enthralls me, I've studied the game quite a bit but I honestly can't say what these changes would do in practice it's just coming from my personal experience, which hardly accounts for everyone's.
---
Also everyone's a bittervet with an opinion to sling here, myself included, so I do see it devolve into people throwing verbal mud around often too, yeah. Jin'Taan has a very strong point, but I think the issues are at the roots and not in that capitals can do what they do right now.
---
i wish i knew who are the speakers but nicely done.
---
The only real enemy is us. Not Caps. It is the players who haven't had to go through learning curve are not your content anymore. You guys all streamed, and gave all the tools to the new players that they needed to learn eve more quickly than you, or I did. Instead of actually being that help in keeping a retention of players, you created your own worst enemy, and changing caps will remove players from the game, not add them.
---
Or you can look at our pings and go fly that ship, get some dank titan kills.
---
Divorce is always an option.
---
No its the word people use who understand that "I think" doesnt mean much.
---
Oh feisty little fellow aint ya? Well, I would need some form of evidence behind "sock puppeting" as well. You know, more than anecdotal:)
---
But, you still havent responded to if there actually is any analysis or if youre just pulling "facts" from your ass.
---
Not my cuppa tea BUT it looks like a great fleet fight with lots of fun and ultimately some low stakes, non-narrative driven PvP! Good AAR too.
---
If you make a video tho pls dont make it just purple squares shooting red or orange squares with shitty techno. Tell the same story as the AAR did.
---
I'm down with all minnie ships just getting 3-5 times the number of visible turrets to add to the apparent torrent of gunfire.
---
joining PL in the dumpster?
---
Well bubbles also don't get you concorded, so I think the code is there
---
lol
---
odd question: is there a limit to how many characters can be biomassed on an account? been getting bored of Eve so I wanna do a challenge i came up with that may require me to biomass *alot*
---
Usually is in Troll Legion... always better than TSC.
---
The tricky thing about mines is, that they don't make an exception between friend and enemy.
---
I also think they should auto-detonate after a week, to prevent excessive spam
---
there are purple mods in eve tho
---
evemon
---
Stay in LS and get an alt is not an answer to this problem. It is idiotic to get a security rating loss if you are enlisted in FW and can´t even shoot a neutral who enters the battlefield/complex.
---
Ya and they fucking suck because they half assed it and fucked it all up just like null sec.
---
&gt;Alliances should not defend strategic assets
---
What?
---
I was part of this multiple times, it never worked.
---
To add on to this, its normally on your toolbar, but the free XP weekend is adding an extra icon to your toolbar which may be throwing it off onto the collapsed section.
---
Have you guys looked at "leagues"? I.e. mechanics that allow players to select different rulesets/mechanics, either by moving to areas where desirable rulesets are in play, or by giving them control of the rulesets in areas they control?
---
I mean, obviously you already have the "moving to areas" variant with hi/low/null/worm. but those are very broad brushes.
---
"Let's go bash them."
---
"Not in this fleet, we don't: their constellation is subcap."
---
Yes, but this thrasher would have one utility *louder*
---
If you cant manage to get shadow play to work right, I've used bandicam and it has worked nicely.
---
Make Eve more dangerous. For everyone. Not just the players in popular corps. I know, it's crazy. Making it more dangerous for everyone. How could all those wormhole krabbers and wallet warriors adapt to such an idea?
---
Why not both?
---
They are still expensive. I mean you keep glossing over that simple fact. And you are saying things were different 5 years ago. Well newsflash, this isnt five years ago. And havent titans been nerfed in those 5 years?
---
And you are saying just kill all supers/titans. You just dont wanna follow through with your argument. You want them to killed in the same way as titans kill other titans atm, by alpha strikes. But you want this to be done by subs. That is the fking definition of killing the ship. Why the fuck would anyone want to fly them in such a situation?
---
You know what youre saying but you just wont say it outright. Dont pretend like this is anything else. 
---
And honestly, I just dont get what the big deal is. If someone wants to fly titans, let them. Get off the "my playstyle is the only valid one" shit and come down to reality. If you have a real objection against them present it but not this BS "they kill everything" shit. Because its simply not true and just because they are used a lot in Delve that doesnt mean that they are being used as much everywhere else.
---
Its just... Sometimes I just dont get why people argue in a manner. You completely disregard what is happening in the game and focus on a single thing making it into the biggest issue ever, and based on a lie. Caps are, since the nerf, not as oppressive as they used to be. Realise that, fly the ships, fly against them and then start making up new nerfs. If even needed. And stop basing everything on Delve.
---
Legacy coalition is a huge group of alliances in nullsec that are allied with each other. Positive standings ingame are blue, and null sec space looks like a donut. Its called ablue donut since most of null is allied with each other
---
click bait, thought this was about dreads xP
---
Even if you're not enlisted and just want to PVP' in FW it's idiotic to loose standing for shooting things inside a plex. Outside sure there's cloaky t3cs stuff camping gates whatever.
---
I wouldnt mind it. But just to make a small group happy? I mean they atleast need real reasons and not this BS theory shit that will shatter the game if actually introduced.
---
Wait I agree with making eve more dangerous everywhere.
---
But cynos in WHs just shows that you know literally NOTHING about WH space. So don't even suggest changes for WH space. Let people who actually have at least a basic understanding of WH space do that.
---
Also I loathe crabs in ANY space. I thought you would have figured that out through these posts.
---
But did you just shit on "wallet warriors" ? You mean the people that actually pay real money to play eve and literally keep the lights on?
---
Wait a minute. You cannot sit here writing that Triglavian ships are "ok" because they allow the small gangs to whip the big blobs, but then whine about FAUX's (which allow the small gang to whip the big blobs).
---
Stop it. You're being a hypocrite.
---
So basically fucking nothing
---
I am a very very new player and just got my first carrier . As per your opinion carriers shud not be allowed on anomalies . But if thats the case ratting shud be very low isk / hr compared to other jobs like mining in a rorq. 
---
Just my opinion but if you wanna make titan just a lance ,it will be really not that appealing to train into it being a new person and would just only and only train into a dread or super for dps and defence .
---
I always though every job had a progression in eve like 1. venture to procurer to hulk to orca to rorq
---
2. Normal frig/ destroyer to vni/ domi to carriers to super carrier  in ratting 
---
Arent we restricting a lot of thing this being a sandbox .
---
Backstab them before they backstab you. Its the only way
---
*have to deal with. There's two of them, so it's have rather than has. Sorry this kind of thing really gets to me.
---
One of the big aspects that changed that's really obvious in this video is that back in that era, ships exploded *immediately* upon reaching 0hp, while now they hit 0hp and go through a several second long explosion sequence. So when a bombing run goes right, or a torpedo barrage hits its mark, the target just immediately bursts into a blaze of light, rather than the more modern system of the real explosions coming a few seconds later.
---
While the new explosions are nice animations, the no-delay form offers a lot more punch for moments like this.
---
The problem with attacking capitals inside an umbrella is the FAX jumping in.
---
Also a jump drive on a marauder doesn't make sense at all, their focus is on tank. You basically would eliminate the need for those PvE boats to take gates.
---
We should make it into a poster “Pilots did not think it would affect them too much - excessive use of skill extractors made this pilot’s life a living hell. You’ll be shocked to learn what she looked like before!"
---
Thanks for highlighting what kind of player you are. The wallet warrior that's in a small gang flying out of npc space and "pvps" with nothing really on the line. Hey, next time your fighting for sov, or bashing structures for hours on end because you have to defend your space, or do anything of import other than "hunting" coveters, come on back to the convo super chief. 
---
Implying krabbers, who buy plex for days, don't keep the lights on but the dudebros flying the latest flavor of the month ship do. Fucking reddit.
---
I’d petition for sure.
---
The first time I did it, I called out for help in local and a dude rocked up and helped me. I paid it back not long after when someone else did the same. Seems to be a common occurrence.
---

---
the'res a problem with this
---
I wish ships would blow up instantly occasionally..  If they do, I wish they would do it more often.
---
It's not frowned upon. I do this because I get too bored doing other shit to fund my PvP habit. If a tenner will get me in a ship I make enough back on through PvP to cover the next one once I lose it, I'm happy.
---
Smaller blocs would never undock titan, big blocs and B-R's would become even more rare (which is not what we need right now) and we (Goons) would exploit the living shit out of this. Not trying to be an asshole, just giving constructive feedback from a player with a good bit of null sec and null sec war experience.
---
Well there are skills for capital reps if I remember correctly
---
&gt; you've made 100M ISK+. Get caught by a cloaky camper - all that ISK is gone. That's about as high stakes as you can get as a NewBro
---
and then shipping 600M worth of exploration loot in an astero through null to a trade hub, and at one point, in a corvette.  That was exciting.
---
Yes, but they stayed the same and would still be needed if they remove FAX
---
&gt; They were only overpowered due to their combined use with capital reps and combat refitting.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; With nerfs to capital reps outside of triage, and the removal of combat refitting, the "slowcat" doctrine is not possible.
---
what really steams me up is the fact that nerfing slowcats could have been done simply by moving the remote rep power into the triage module with zero other changes, and yet they went ahead and fucked everything up, adding shit like the ninazu with free 50% cap booster economy, navy cap booster 3200s and capital cap boosters, fuckoff giant fax hulls, NSAs, HAWs, the list goes on
---
the problem was slowcats, not any of the other things. slowcats would have been dead and buried *just with the change to the triage module*. none of the rest had to be done but ccp either does insignificant changes that accomplish fucking nothing, or unnecessary giant kneejerk reactions that annihilate the meta
---
perception check the shit out of wormholes
---
But this game isn't just about solo pvp. It's a sanbox, and blocs work together as a team to make sure their income generation is as safe as possible. If me ratting becomes a roll of the dice live/die, then the risk is too high for me to undock. If I'm paying attention and flying the right fit I should have a very high probability of not losing my super or rorq. That is the whole point of an umbrella, it's a get out of my sand castle statement.
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/a0lg6b/solo\_chaotic\_tier\_5\_frigate\_abyssal\_sites/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/a0lg6b/solo_chaotic_tier_5_frigate_abyssal_sites/) 
---
\^\^
---
&gt; If a Fax has 3 reps and they have 15 or 30s cycle times then they can’t keep frigs/cruisers alive indefinitely between cycles.
---
if a fax's remote reps take 30 seconds to cycle they will literally keep nothing alive that isn't a capital ship, and even then they mostly won't keep those alive
---
&gt;As it is now, you have 3 reps cycling every 2 seconds.
---
no
---
you either don't ever use or interact with fax, or you're dumb
---
I mean, we need personal experience to present ideas but then discussed with other experiences in order to reach conclusions. Im sorry that I cant be off more help in that department, my knowledge of the game is very limited in comparison to others.
---
Hes got a point but imo its from a very narrow perspective. Its completely disregarding the why as you say and the outcome. In fact it even disregards being completely true in the moment. Most engagements are done in subs, not caps.
---
And honestly, its basic premise is imo wrong. There cant be any balance between small gang and big gang anymore, that boat has sailed. Focus should lie on where we go from here instead of talking about how it used to be and ways for us to return to it. The old Eve died when the new one got implemented, we need a way to make this one work.
---
I think you need to better define what girefing in cloaky t3cs means. Because once you are in space you are a valid target at all times and you can only grief invalid targets.
---
NCPL just played the game to its meta back then 
---
Didn't stop other empires flourishing but made it impossible to own supers  back then
---
What the hell? Another story you told yourself. The hell is wrong with you. 100% wrong wrong wrong.
---
I like less people buying plex with isk and lower Plex prices.
---
Krabbers DO NOT keep the lights on buying plex for days because it's a supply and demand.
---
High Plex prices. More people buying plex with isk then people buying plex with real money.
---
That system is at best 50/50. Worse if the rumors are true and A LOT of Plex being put on the markets by CCP to keep inflation down. Maybe CCP finally said. Fuck it. We ain't making any money off these crabs. Time to fuck em.
---
bruh wait how did you get elected to csm
---
Lol
---
wouldn't help, because you couldn't put your titans or supers in lowsec in the first place
---
holy shit a kcolor goodpost
---
I saw Delete Kilmails, I said reeeeeeeeeeeeee yesssssss!
---
The counter is situational, but this happens to a certain extent in solo..
---
I dunno why you're shifting to wardecs now when talking about fleet composition...
---
After arguing against rps style balancing, your main on grid suggestion for supercaps is an rps style change?
---
The simple fact that it has to load like 2-4 seconds makes it unusable.
---
Don't forget about Singularity, test server is your friend. Spend a lot of time experimenting here, and yes, T2 fit retribution can do Tier 2 sites. 
---
But there could be an unlucky spawn with 2 x sleeper/drone BS, which have quite high amount of HP, so I usually hit time limit. 
---
If you are interested, will post a fit later (this computer does not have eve installed).
---
what kind of fuck head would jump into a mine field?
---
I think the GUI is fine. The load time is what needs improvement.
---
note:
---
battleship slugfests died because of the warp changes. nobody really uses battleships other than machs anymore because it feels absolutely fucking awful to warp around at battleship speed when you've got somewhere to be
---
fix battleship warp speeds and people will start using them again
---
The only thing I don't like about your idea is the dropping of fighters from Carriers.     The old meta of carriers which this would constitute a return to was "Slowcats"  or "Wrecking Balls"  prevalent during the Halloween War in 2013-2014.    Balls of 100 spider tanking sentry carriers  unable to be killed by pretty much anything other than another ball of 100 spider tanking sentry carriers.
---
But you are already effectively invincible in lowsec, and you did clear out a lot of small/medium alliances, back in 2018.
---
Some of them are only now starting to trickle back in.
---
And the biggest reason for that happening was, that pretty much most other big lowsec groups failscaded. 
---
With those changes, more people would come and play in lowsec, and sooner or later there would be a group that could stand up to you.
---
Yes
---
he's not wrong but it does ring hollow
---
wouldn't have mattered, dscan doesn't show cloaked ships
---
I use signature radius implants (halo?) with my retri
---
&gt; Although as others have said, we'd eventually have reached this stage with or without injectors 
---
Maybe, but we reached this stage so fast, CCP didn't have time to come up with a solution and if they make big changes now, everyone will be crying about all their capitals ships being nerfed instead of changing their 2 year skill plans.
---
&gt; Characters were always able to be bought and sold, if not SP. 
---
That arguement is bullshit. If you buy a super pilot, the *total* amount of super pilots in the game doesn't change. Which is why groups like PL were so strong.
---
&gt; This is a first: logi reps on the cyno inhibitor. LMAO 
---
inhib didn't die. stupid ideas that work aren't stupid
---
&gt;Dafuq would you rat in a titan as the ticks are comparable with super ratting which is 4-5 times cheaper.
---
the ticks are actually worse than super ratting, it's the clicks that are better. when you boson rat, you lock one wave of rats and haw gun them, then you boson, then you warp off to a safe pos for 4 minutes before doing it again. no fighters to micromanage, no bombs to aim, no missile volleys to time
---
You have a purpose frigs are really valuable in all kinds of fights. Ewar frigs scouting frigs. Harpies and stuff. Caps are kind of just stuck if they don't have subcap support.
---
Don't think that will help with a proper umbrella. Right now if you drop a single dread (which would do about 2x the amount of dps than this marauder) it will still die well before even a carrier dies. Not if the pilot wasn't paying attention then ya it would die, but that is still the case currently. Even though I still think it would be a cool ship and could be used for other applications, it just won't do what you think.
---
Some of these ideas are not bad. However, I think that Jump Freighters could actually be part of the problem my Reasoning in this is its a Docking ring to docking ring style of gameplay which is not conducive to people being out in space doing things. I Feel eve without jump freighters would start to develop Regional markets again and the gate campers might come back with the chance of more haulers or even Freighters.

Turns out lots of people are as sick of the Empire builder capital blob playstyle as I was. I ran with my entire Eve vision, not the video.
---
The trick is not to put a mobile depot up with the description "mine field here"

I don't blame you. One can make an equally complex chart about balancing Eve ecosystem

I was in Delve recently. I encountered people dumb enough to do that.

Don't say you weren't warned!
---
Why not just make the fax fitted repair modules only usable on capital ships and structures? That seems the easiest fix to me.
---
i'm not mad, i voted for you because you have ideas that i like
---
the problem is that your specific thoughts on actual ship balance are wild, and a lot of them would be damaging and unhealthy for a broad spectrum of play styles
---
for instance, haw dreads aren't really a problem. nobody has a problem with haw dreads because the risk/reward factor is pretty well balanced. they do a good bit of dps, but nothing insane, and the tradeoff is that they're generally more expensive than subcaps while not being particularly difficult to kill. the balance problem isn't haw dreads. it's haw titans. nerfing haws instead of titans nerfs haw dreads, which is a problem
---
&gt;Fighter speeds are obnoxious. [...] if these things deal more damage than heavy drones, then they should be slower than heavy drones.
---
that would be true, if they were drones, not fighters. again, the problem here is not the problem you perceive. post citadel carriers were supposed to be used from thousands of kilometers away, not point blank brawling. for a carrier to function from that far away from hostiles it needs for its fighters to be able to move very quickly, perhaps more quickly than they do currently - maybe if they could warp on grid, slower mwd speed would be tolerable?
---
the problem isn't that the fighters are too fast, it's that carriers can be made to function in a way where fighters are too fast as opposed to using them in the intended way where they aren't fast enough. the solution isn't to gimp fighter mwd speeds (unless you let them warp on grid), it's to gimp carrier tank and exchange it for agility so they become weaker at brawling and stronger at artillery

Uh, I think he nailed the narrative on it's head and sounds like op knows a lot more than you know about EVE.
---
This guy creates a perfectly legit tool in his spare time and we've got people in here telling him to go fuck himself. Classy.
---
These tools shitting up the game is for CCP to deal with, not this guy. Asking people to handicap themselves for the sake of the game's health is stupid, anything that's possible and within the EULA is fair. That's always been the spirit of EVE. If something needs to be handicapped then it's CCP's responsibility to impose that on everyone.
---
The thing is all you idiots reeeeeing about the blackout were only wanting one thing , to go and hunt krabs. That's the reality of it. You are all so risk adverse that you won't fight other pvpers, you just want to gank krabs. Trouble is the krabs docked up so you had nothing but each other to fight as a result of the above. 
---
If I'm in a krabbing ship, I'm not going to fight a ship equipped for pvp because that's not what my ship is equipped for. If I'm in a pvp ship I'll fight you, but I'm not going to give you an easy fight by leaving my whaling ship in space cause that's not actually a fight.
---
You say you want to fight well go bloody fight fair and square none of this strong vs weak crap, man up, grow some fucking balls and just fight regardless of win or loose.
---
Dude, if RMT vanishes and everybody would start buying the ingame advantage from CCP instead, supply would skyrocket and people would buy less PLEX because its value dropped into the cellar thanks to oversupply.
---
It's pretty clear by now that you slept through economics in school so I'd suggest you stop drawing conclusions out of your ass or start backing it up with scientific evidence why eve online should be the great exception to the law of supply and demand.
---
Also, going by your apples analogy. I'm asking 'how fast is the falling apple' and you pull out about 10 m/s. Relatively speaking this might be correct. From an absolute point of view however are you utterly wrong. If one apple falls in Brazil and the other in Germany, one of them is increasing it's speed while the other is actually slowing down. Now guess what else depends on many other factors that you just chose to ignore? PLEX.

Any tips on doing market PvP?  0.01 isk war is real.  
---
And how prevalent is the market bot?  I am beginning to think some of these sellers are actually bots.  
---
I have no proof but one day I got frustrated with my sell orders sitting there at the bottom no matter how often I babysit them so I actually kept on babysit past DT.   No fun all my isk is tied to the sell order.
---
As much as i diasagree with falcons idea to ban supers/titans from low, it would be great fun to see snuff get their faces smashed in when they couldnt just use the “i win” button every time they started bleeding ships.
---
More like cast rapid light missile at the darkness... =P
---
When I try to introduce friends to the game, there are three main frustrations which seem to be reoccurring obstacles to getting them to stick around. 
---
1) The skill system. Waiting for % damage skills to train so that you aren't incredibly gimped in a 1v1 situation is an exercise in frustration for most of them. The people I bring in tend to be at least moderately number-savvy, so it doesn't take them long to realize that there are a bunch of basic gunnery, tank, and fitting skills which make a \*very\* big difference, and that they're basically not going to be remotely competitive for at least a month and a half at minimum. Most people quit here. 
---
2) After that, is what I've come to think of as the problem of 'damage permanence'. They try to fight someone, they die, they learn something in the process hopefully. However, I've noticed that once they realize that the damage they're dealing to someone's ship is extremely transitory, most of the new players I engage with start feeling a bit worse about their losses. There's a big difference between 'that guy and I mauled each other, now he's going to need to find a dock or something to get repairs' and 'that guy killed me, now he'll run his reppers for a few cycles and be back in 100% condition'. A lot of these people I introduce are coming in with preconceived notions about how things ought to work based on Battletecch/Mechwarrior/StarCitizen/etc - games where damage is a lot more meaningful; a perception which isn't helped by EVE's reputation for having \*logistics\*. You need to move hulls, ammo, modules, and people around the universe, but repairs don't play into this at all.
---
3) At this point, they've either embraced or come to terms with the first two hurdles, and now they're starting to encounter capital ships. The frank reality is that interacting with capitals when you aren't in a large group, or a very experienced player with access to your own capitals, is a miserable experience. There's no real way to engage with them as a somewhat new player, at least in a manner that feels meaningful. They're floating blobs of hitpoints that could withstand anything you throw at them for ages, and carriers/HAW dreads will contemptuously swat you down. Few people I've introduced over the years make it this far, and perhaps half of the ones that did quit shortly after realizing that you can't do anything interesting to hinder capitals, like targeting specific components. 
---
I guess it's kind of rambling, but I've wanted to get that off my chest for a while. It's frustrating trying to get people into the game knowing how hostile it is to new players. It's even more frustrating that so many people in this community just \*don't understand\* how incredibly off-putting something like the skill-system is in 2019. There is no more patience or tolerance for such blatant vertical progression in the gaming community, and when you explain how it works to potential new players, they openly balk that it still exists in its current incarnation. It would be bad enough if this were some strange lobby based game, but it's a sandbox, and a day 1 new player with no skills is in the same pond as someone with 200 million SP. If you put them in the same ship, the veteran isn't just going to be more skilled, but he's going to be numerically advantaged to the point of absurdity.

&gt; for instance, haw dreads aren't really a problem. nobody has a problem with haw dreads because the risk/reward factor is pretty well balanced. they do a good bit of dps, but nothing insane, and the tradeoff is that they're generally more expensive than subcaps while not being particularly difficult to kill. the balance problem isn't haw dreads. it's haw titans. nerfing haws instead of titans nerfs haw dreads, which is a problem
---
I agree that HAW dreads are less of a problem (or no problem), and HAW titans are. I should have began that sentence with titans. If HAW dreads are as effective as high angle subcap weapons, then that doesn't contradict with what I say. I just argued that all weapons systems that are supposed to work on smaller ships should behave like how they do on the classic progression from frigates to battleships. If you think they do on dreads, that's fine. They don't on fighters and titans.
---
&gt; that would be true, if they were drones, not fighters. again, the problem here is not the problem you perceive. 
---
Fighters are a mechanic which smaller entities with their own damage/tracking/speed are controlled from the main ship, like drones. Drone progression from frigate to battleship has been really well balanced. Fighters trashed all that balance.
---
&gt; post citadel carriers were supposed to be 
---
Citadel patch is where CCP created insanely OP capitals that break very inherent and healthy game balance rules, basically to hype people and push injectors. And their only justification was "server performance". Almost nobody was complaining about how underpowered capitals were.
---
&gt; used from thousands of kilometers away, not point blank brawling.
---
If this was the aim, it was a stupid aim. I doubt this was even the aim. CCP just tends to make every fresh release to be OP. "Unlimited range" was one of those completely out of balance mechanics that CCP thought would be nice in combination with the larger grids, without so much actual consideration.
---
&gt; the solution isn't to gimp fighter mwd speeds
---
Carriers/supers cannot be the ideal gatecamping ships in a balanced Eve. Period. I sometimes fuck up and boosh excavs to 480 km. If a carrier/super is a better option to protect your drones in that situation than getting a scanner or a fast ship to burn for drones, then that's not balanced either.
---
&gt; i like how you say "fix cyno mechanics" and then propose no real, actual solutions because you know that there are no actual sane balance changes to cyno/jump mechanics
---
Yeah almost like I don't have 2 years of discussion on [the topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/amgj7y/capital_projectioncynojump_drive_balance_three/), and didn't make the issue a key cornerstone of my campaign, so I have to re-present my arguments here to convince an ignorant snowflake.

If you're under a super umbrella, you are still quite safe considering titan EHP and FAX spam.

Teh real question is why are YOU not a game designer?? You seem to have pretty good ideas all around, and the community loves you.

FW is the only place to go for real consensual 1v1 fights that is to say players who are both competent at what they do who want to test their ships. Not sniping and hazing noobs and PVE ships not cloaky t3cs in wh or anything else that simply involves two ships.
---
The reward of FW is just not good enough to join for the average player compared to not joining and shooting at twice as many people.
---
This BR makes me salivate. This is the Eve we should see more often. Battleship brawl, full escalation chain, lots of explosions.

The most fun I had in my first 3 years was flying 20min frigs and killing all the small stuff in 20-1000+ man fights, you have no idea how annoying u can be with a little frig, until all of the enemy fleet are redboxing you ;)
---
And it's still fun flying the small nano stuff and just annoying the living €&amp;+# out of the enemy FC 
---
PS: null sec is mostly screw'd when u bring frigs and nano because the supercap umbrella can't do much against you
---
I haven't played for a while but there should still b some wikis up with all the different sites.  I think when you scan it down it will tell you the name.  Then you can Google it or look it up on the wiki page and it will tell you what to expect there.
---
Wait people actually DO THIS? Try to find you like this? Isn't this just a waste of time?  
---
I mean if you're out hunting players in an adequate ship .. you're able to scan them down. Why bother with mindless warping between random celestial bodies hoping to see another ship in a split second while all along spamming bookmarks each second? I mean seriously...
---
haha
---
Create a font line.

Make systems contestable ONLY if they are adjacent to something your faction already owns...

From what I see, there are plenty "politics" here where the main division is not right vs left but pve farmer vs pvp hunter. Most of the posts here are related to that (like the black out or the capital balance).

Or you could have a separate game interface with Eve where actual human beings get to fly your fighters \*cough\* Valkyrie \*cough\*

---
Instant application is important when pve sites are all about switching targets because there are so many enemies that they die frequently, especially in hisec where they're all weak.
---
I used to do hisec sites in a Cynabal and split guns. Short cycle time plus multiple groups means I can spray down ships.
---
so you went afk at gate and got killed? because facpo is so slow and actually webs you into warp first that its honestly your own fault 
---
besides that yeah its annoying to buy tags once a week but you get used to it somewhat
---
Stage out of Uemon and  go into PH space, youll land some good fights. Just be sure to take the long way round since they permacamp their nullsec entrance.
---
Sell outside Jita, deliver and seed regional markets.
---
But usually doing smallscale stationtrading is not worth it at all, better go crabbing then!
---
Stuart is that you?
---
Why not if you are cloaked and your target is not? Probes would give out your presence and intentions.
---
I don't know if it's just me but I just simply enjoyed what Falcon had to say.
---
I have no expectations if any of these ideas will be implemented, but it is nice to craft a "what if?" theory now and then, and hearing an old hardass pirate's opinion is quite refreshing.
---
Please don't take this too seriously, I don't want ccp restricting this kind of thing.

No. Just no.

A lot of this reads like it written by a "Vanilla WoW was great" and not just an endless grind sort of person.

---
I mean, I also have 120-140 networth, and I am pretty space poor. 
---
120-140 million though.
---
You can anchor structures to decloak stuff?
---
&gt;That arguement is bullshit. If you buy a super pilot, the total amount of super pilots in the game doesn't change. Which is why groups like PL were so strong.
---
Someone is always going to be skilling up pilots simply to sell them? 
---
Granted far fewer back then, especially due to the train time, but it's always gonna be a thing.
---
but its olmeca, im pretty sure he is incapable of thinking of anything but delve. them bees up in there rent free.
---
don't do that, they'll escalate to titans in no time.
---
You took a (semi-) bling ship through Uedama, which along with Niarja is one of the hottest highsec gang spots.
---
You could have avoided Uedama, or done it at a quieter time, or checked zKill to see if people were ganking in Uedama, and you didn't. You could have moved with other people (i.e. logi) through Uedama, and you didn't.
---
You make about 200 mil/hr in highsec incursions including LP, so you're basically quitting because you lost about 8 hours of effort to your own lack of effort.
---
Armor incursions now have higher DPS because they replace T2 Logi with Nestors and run less of them. If you dont believe me, join a WTM fleet and contest a TDF fleet.
---
The Legion has the best "hug to death" fit of any T3C because it can have big stronk neuting power combined with stronk armor tank.
---
I'm only familiar with artillery shield lokis, which are much safer due to range and can kite groups but obviously with less firepower.
---
Stratios is fast and agile which is their main selling point, as well as being cheaper. They can also fit neuts and pretend to be a Legion.
---
IDK.. seems to me like your chances are better with scanning than like this? 
---
However I really have no clue.. I'm still the target in this scenario :))))
---
Still a beginner.. so I reckon I need "combat" probes to scan down player ships? The regular probes I use to find stuff like WH/Gas/Data/Relic sites just won't do?
---
One thing that always turned me off was how FW makes half of HS faction police attack you. Let's be real, Jita is this only hub worth using now. Joining Minmi or Gallente screws players without a hauling/JF alt from logistics.
---
Not exactly. But then buffing battleship warp speed is something I've supported for a while, to make them more fun to fly. The leshak also has a 10s align time, less with a mwd, so it's not too bad compared.
---
If we're going to follow the theme of destroyers and make these things glass cannons as some have suggested, being fast enough not to hold the fleet back is a possibility.
---
Hey that’s me
---
Lets see:
---
1.  Bought a Nyx pilot from Char bazaar (you usually do so to move a new super, so that probably got attention)
---
2.  falcon buddy... he fall asleep in the mean time: We will never know if he would have saved you
---
3.  Hic/probe scanner pilots in both systems.. first one left the system. Fuck it.. its time: No it isn't
---
4.  Instead of start self-destruct sequence, i lighted a cyno. WTF you idiot!!! Ok, shit happens... nvm.. spamming dscan.. nothing: This is the point where you let the cyno burn out and make a new safe
---
I am pretty sure I missed some things
---
Sorry what big changes are CCP making?
---
I tackled and tanked enough Carrier with my Malediction to know that you can do at least something with a small gang.
---
In fleetfights just fit doctrin and n+1.
---
They can't handle bunch of [noobs](https://i.imgur.com/JCiZjGG.jpg)!
---
This^^^  You're playing a game that's got a learning curve steeper than a vertical wall.  Get your climbing gear and be prepared to screw up a bit.
---
As target you could use d-scan and notice combat probes before anyone land on you.
---
next level big brain plays
---
Yeah the fact that you claimed I have no actual proposals for cynoes and having been proven false is plainly wrong.
---
You are not well-intentioned dude. I don't need your well thought response, because most discussions with people like you has been all the same parroting for 3 years. And for 3 years I have rained down unpleasant truths to empire builder/asset acquirers on this sub. Capitals op. Umbrellas op. Locals op over the offending side. Etc. And finally Eve has evolved to a stagnating point which people actually began to recognise and appreciate those truths and even elect me despite the reputational hellhole mega empires put me into. So yeah I am confident you can't offer any new and interesting perspective to me.
---
true
---
If you want to get into exploration, check out Signal Cartel, they're a Corp that's all about explo.
---
Moving through space is a bitch tho with Boson traps on every Gate.
---
My Corp killed some blue Carriers and several smaller ships camping hostiles. Reimbusing blues suck especially if they're blinged - at least we can upload the killmails.
---
Yes I'm spamming D-Scan all the time.. and just yesterday I've managed to escape someone who tried to kill me. I've noticed activity on D-Scan, so I increased my attention to it.. more scanning, tactical camera and so on.. so in a few min, someone warped to my location, and I managed to warp out before they could hit me.
---
Still don't know how they managed to follow me to a wormhole I used to get back home? Just lucky? There were 4 wormholes in that space...  or some elaborate trick on my warp direction and using the map or something like that.. an educated guess :)
---
Can I ask you about the FW system and LS. Now why isn't the FW system reworked and built up in the same way you have done with incursions and make use of the new AI.  
---
It would be much more fun and interesting if the NPC factions would take part in the FW by fighting each other and making it so the wars are more dynamic and fun. Could even have a chance for an Escilation by each faction drop capitals or big fleets.   
---
You could even expend on this with your "No cynos in low sec" by having the Factions that own LS deploy and defend their own cyno jammer network, making it so players would have to engage and reinforce these to be able to use the system to light a cyno.  
---
Having "No cynos" in LS is a great idea but I would make it a more dynamic one, I would love to see more NPC related ideas come out of CCP regarding older systems like FW.
---
^^^^^^^^^
---
increased costs for things pushes plex prices up. i mean all in all i dont care about the prices for plex.
---
but it does affect who can or who cannot play this game. reducing numbers in game
---
B-Rs are over unless the balance of power fundamentally shifts anyway. Theres just nothing worth suiciding a titan fleet into.
---
He is blessed by Spod'!
---
You could use d-scan to narrow down someone's location and match it to other known objects in the system - celestials, anomalies, scanned down signatures.
---
You ran into [a ghost site](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Ghost_Sites).
---
My first experience with them was similar: Found a weirdly named site and warped to it. To make sure I wouldn't accidentally mess something up, I googled the site name and found that wiki article. I was just reading about the part where it explains that the site will explode when I heard the lossmail notification from my client...
---
The best part about that is that most titan pilotes are ... Well shi+ and it's so much fun Bering droped by your titans and haras the living f. out of them, and they can do not rly anything to you,
---
And if a good titan pilote drops on you well, new ship and round 2 
---
+ If your titans kill the field for us (awox), well I still have muscle pain from laughing last time
---
&gt; You are not well-intentioned dude.
---
cute assumption bb
---
&gt;You have no idea what you're talking about.
---
&gt;It's not numbers that allow large groups to shut down any sort of roaming or guerrilla warfare in their space. It's not blingier ships or better versions of subcap hulls (both of which are trumped by piloting skill more often than not).
---
You're assuming big bloc pilots have inferior skill, and the only thing going for them is numbers. This isnt always the case. My point is that they will fly whatever is the most effective hull, at whatever numbers are needed to guarantee a win. Right now it's caps. Tomorrow it may be something else. There will always be something for hunters who get dropped on to complain about. If skill is equal, large groups will work due to numbers anyway. If skills and ships are equal, large groups are generally better funded, so can afford that blinged/abyssal module that'll keep them alive when you're both deep in hull. There's always something. Local went and people are crying about warp stabs and ratters not having weapon timers ffs, so much for "skill".
---
&gt;A single person with a super and a fax alt can shut down most roaming gangs alone - especially if they have an umbrella to fall back on 
---
For all intents and purposes that's two people. Isn't there some guy who multiboxes his whole fleet? For anyone fighting him, it's effectively multiple people. Additionally as someone else mentioned, that's the point of an umbrella?? If it doesn't have a good chance of protecting you from a roaming gang, it's not working correctly. 
---
Is your problem supers, caps in general, or umbrellas? Because they are different. 
---
&gt;On the subcap side, numbers may win timers, but they don't always win engagements.
---
Don't always. But n+1 does increase your odds. A cap doesn't always win a fight. But it does increase your odds.
---
&gt;If small groups can't fuck with larger groups in any meaningful way, the name of the game becomes blob up or quit. 
---
Smaller groups can and do fuck with large ones though? Wormholers aren't liked by most groups for this reason, due to the hit and run shit they're so fond of. This is acting like umbrellas guarantee 100% safety, when all the big groups still take losses on a regular basis. Living in a group should increase safety, that's the purpose of it. 
---
Either way this is all fairly off topic.
---
The fit, its horrendous
---
Tell them they’ll need to frequently roll insight when conversing in Jita local
---
tell that to the super blobs and boson titans
---
Any NPC counts
---
Sir do you know dotlan ?
---
"I will refit everything  when I land in my system" muh..
---
I like megaplexes too to shift the hotspots around. A plex that pays out regular LP but pushes contestion more than 0.7ish per cent
---
That's a wonderfully short-sighted view point. 
---
I like blackout, it got me to re-sub. I don't think blackout is doing anything positive for the game right now other than luring in us easy marks like me.
---
I'm very interested to see what CCP follows blackout up with, because we know it won't last forever, and we know they've been doing nothing but burning login numbers (despite all the re-subs) so how do they turn this all into something that's the most beneficial for most of the game?

Though I love your mindset of "I got to drop on some people who didn't see me coming so this is a positive change to the game." The reason standings and alliances were even added to the game is because a group was abusing the ability to recognize the portraits in local chat (using an oog tool) to establish who it was okay to shoot and who it wasn't. If eve-players are willing to force CCP to create game mechanics due to their use of information what makes you think the people who desire complete safety won't achieve it in this blackout world?
---
Is it even possible to hold a conversation in Jita local?
---
The Permits! They do  nothing!
---
Some points to touch on (in chronological order);
---
&gt;In almost any of the current nullsec coalition staging areas today, it’s impossible for anyone to win an engagement within jump drive distance of their space without having to move in their own capital force.
---
I believe legacy (or was it init? I forget. Pretty sure it was test though) bashed a keepstar with boosh ravens. Despite supers sitting on said keepstar.
---
&gt;Even Dread-bombs and picking off the occasional capital ships are now largely ineffective, because the few super capitals that do die are easily out-produced by a gross factor making them largely inconsequential to the corporation let alone the alliance.
---
This was always the case.
---
&gt;Another powerful tool capital ships have at their disposal is the ability to ignore travel time with their jump drives.
---
This is also largely the case with battleships. I can get from r1o to BWF in 3 jumps rather than the ordinary 15 jumps by using ansiblexes.
---
&gt;While in the freedom provided by eve’s fitting system you could easily fit battleships with the ability to deal with mass swarms of frigates by fitting energy warfare, flights of small drones, smart-bombs, heavy tackle and smaller weapons, they are still limited by their ability to move and their targeting time and frigates/cruisers can easily outmanoeuvre them if they don’t wish to engage, and they can be still be overcome through use of crowd control. 
---
You can scare off frigates with battleships or caps. Doesn't matter which one you use, because you're not engageable anyways. Let's not pretend that a frigate gang (even if blingy and competent) can realistically fight a battleship gang of the same size with logi. It's not going to happen and you full well know that.
---
&gt;Unfortunately, with AoE weapons on titans not requiring lock time, NSA to carriers and super-carriers boosting them to destroyer levels and other mechanics such as Triage. Capital ships simply cannot be outmanoeuvred in their concentrated area of space. And as Jin’Taan outlines, due to the utility of support fighters and access to high application weapons, they do not need to bring anything other than jump-drive capable capital ships.
---
Are you seriously suggesting that bosoning/lancing frigates is a realistic endevour? Holy shit. You know there's a delay, right? Of course you do. You just chose to ignore it. Come on, man. You're better than this.
---
I agree that NSA is stupid. As for fighter mobility, maybe longer MWD cooldown?
---
FAX is stupid as you mention. I'd just straight up remove their ability to local active tank. Have them be buffer fit - always. This means that a gang kiting on-grid can kill a fax if they have DPS enough to do it before the triage cycle ends.
---
&gt;Unfortunately, with the addition of HAWs to the game, they have now become the anti-sub capital ship of choice for alliances defending their capital umbrella. The siege resistances that make sense from an anti-capital/anti-structure perspective, do not make sense here in my opinion, essentially they have 3x the damage output of a battleship, with a huge tank, better tracking due to the model size, and effective immunity to crowd control, meaning the only way to really overwhelm them is your own capital ships or having excessive numbers.
---
Nope that's still supers. And HAW dreads are immobile, hence why it's OK for them to be tanky and deal good damage. Don't want to fight the dread? Move around on the grid. They're not gonna chase you. 
---
&gt;While these incredibly powerful bonuses would, again, be perfectly acceptable if a Titan was something that was an incredibly important asset and only few would ever be fielded, in the most important strategic objectives. In the current Era of eve where Black Ops battleships are rarer and incredibly more niche than a Titan, they do not make sense. Why shouldn’t a newbro in a Crucifier be able to neutralise a Titan, and force the Titan to need support to kill that Crucifier in order to be able to function effectively?  The same newbro can hold down a Panther in his Slasher, neutralise a Redeemer in his Crucifier.
---
Okay let's stop with the rose tinted glasses now... A newbro holding down a panther in his slasher? A single heavy neut fucks the slasher and breaks the point. Also light drones are a thing. A slasher is not gonna hold down a panther for long. Again, you know this, but chose to ignore it.
---
Also, to end this, you are well aware that burst jamming titan blops actually works, right? You remember when horde did burst jamming t1 frigates, flew into the condi titan blob and burst jammed? The odds of jamming a titan are slim, but you are rolling your dice SO many times each cycle that it actually works. IIRC you can expect 0.5-1 jammed titans per cycle, which is pretty significant. And I've seen several pictures if people jamming multiple titans with a single cycle. Although I suspect this was less effective because 10% TIDI and all that.
---
All in all, I'm all for nerfing caps in general - despite being a owner of a super and very soon a titan. But let's also keep it fair. Don't suggest that single cap kills mattered previously, that bosoning frigates is a thing, or that a slasher is capable of holding down a panther for very long. You're better than this.
---
Oh please, newbies do do 150 dps, the do like 80.
---
Tried to get my brother into EVE and he loved the idea of faction warfare, gave it a go and enjoyed it. Then realised he couldn't go to some high sec places anymore, which took away the excitement of his first solo kill lol (he died a lot before getting it). Stopped playing shortly after
---
Thanks
---
I like this idea. Marauders seem to be mainly used in PvE right now, this would breathe more life into them. 
---
&gt;Baby dreads basically. Maybe also give them a baby jump drive, so they could go like 2-3ly, Blackops already has a jump drive, so the other t2 battleship having one would make sense, no bridging though.
---
Good ideas, especially the small jump drive one. I considered jump drives before and was thinking a ship like this shouldn't get jump fatigue bonuses, so while it could get away from the initial site, it'd be vulnerable for a while afterwards. I think a short range jump is be a better solution.
---
Cheers for a comment that isn't "Ur wrong ccpls nerf caps" and offers actual points.
---
I love how first the skin goes away and then the ship explodes :D
---
just do security missions. tomorrow we will know more
---
If that were true, don't you think we would have seen more then 7 titian losses in Delve in the past two years, many of which only happened when Goons had their umbrella deployed elsewhere?
---
This is critical information.
---
O\_o o\_o o\_O Lesson learnt never pay code anything rather just shoot them in the pod.

10/10 its top tier
---
My dude, if you were standing before me rn...
---
I couldn't help but hug you :'(
---
I want my 2015 eve back.
---
I mean, you're just asking for cap-escalations with more steps. 5 or so years ago they introduced jump fatigue and neutered cap jump range (14 AU to 8 AU? I think) because third party capital escalations were too prevalent. 
---
Jump fatirgue worked in the sense that caps will no longer jump half-way across New Eden to dunk someone. Jump fatigue didn't work in the sense that people who have the ability to drop caps on something absolutely will about 90% of the time because they're not going to get hell-dunked from a region they don't have eyes on.
---
It's not their mobility, the issue is (as Jin-taan said) caps just out-play literally every subcap in literally every role. There's a person in my corp that literally tried to drop his HAW dread on a harpy fleet earlier, and sounded disapointed when he was told that that was the one application his dread wasn't a win button.
---
Just putting cap EHP on par with where it should be from BS EHP would immediately change a lot of things.
---
It really is. I would probably think myself rich if I had 100B in wallet + whatever assets. Or at least on the lower end of rich.
---
Yes, but you don't respawn with them
---
This is how I always imagined I would go down after buying my own nyx: surprisingly enough, I moved it solo for a good quarter of new eden doing all kind of dumb shit and I survived. 
---
Also curious: was the nyx cap stable?
---
I remember when I started flying in fleets I'd sometimes take out the blackbird. That was back when EWAR was still pretty strong and jamming someone meant they couldn't lock anyone.
---
I manage to jamm one of the enemy subs and proceeded to get redboxed by 120 dudes. Fun times.
---
&gt;I think you need to better define what girefing in cloaky t3cs means.
---
Overkill isn't definition. Dropping 30 T3C's on a ship that wouldn't stand a chance against a single one of them, and fleeing/ cloaky camping before any response shows up. That's not a gf, or PvP. It's being risk averse. The same thing they complain about other people being.
---
&gt;Because once you are in space you are a valid target at all times and you can only grief invalid targets.
---
Well a roaming gang is a valid target for a cap drop, but they'll complain. So newbro in the mining barge he saved a week for/his vexor that's his pride and joy should have an equal platform to complain.
---
Why? They basically allow you to be safer with the downside of being useless in combat with your lack of lock range and insanely long lock time. Unless you're a drone boat.
---
It's the drone no-lock mechanics that are the problem here really.
---
If you’re proactive with your blocking of the spammers, then yes.

All you have to worry about then are the scammers with any actual modicum of intelligence
---
Secret Minmatar project to add 12 to the dial confirmed!
---
How do you get 150 dps? I get like 40 dps
---
Interesting stuff :O I have 2 python mine BPOs sitting around, also have some "samples" of 4 different types of mine. :D
---
CCP could do with some kind of notification system, for when fights like this go down (titan under attack warning), so a Dev can jump on record the fight all cinematic or it could be auto recorded by a script from multiple angles, be stitched together later and then  stick it on YouTube. Fights like this only last a few minutes.
---
rock flag and eagle
---
1.blackout is a great step
---
2. this is the first post from someone who maybe knows what hes talking about actually shit on dreads/HAW's
---
most of these categorizations for each hull you give is what they do. or is what they are. the problem is cross effectiveness to other classes outside thier target class to kill / counter.
---
things like removing the need to take any more than 1 point to point a super would help the lowsec areas a bit.
---
but why do capitals need to be able to jump to a cyno anymore? JF's yeh. rorquals. yeh. but titans?
---
supercarriers. do they actually need to jump? removing the drive would make the game so fresh. new metas would entale. also. owning a super or even a capital would be a much bigger deal
---
Yeah he should go fuck himself. The guy doesn’t even play Eve anymore yet he’s gonna update a shitty program that helped create many of the problems in Null sec that ‘no local’ is trying to fix. I knew a big krabbing alliance was using this again effectively I’d be tempted to create a spy alt and just keep reporting false intel about non existent threats so Krabbers spend all their time docked up.
---
It's 2019, every one man corp should be able to afford a jf if living in low sec. For the true new players they can just join a corp with acces to a jf.
---
The guy doesnt play the same game as the rest of us. Also he has insider info and spouts his bullshit to the developers.
---
I totally agree on all of these. Especially to delete Fax which is fk shit to make non-capitals useless. And now Caps are too strong fighting small ships. Please empower small ships that is the way to empower new players.
---
By the way, a starting for a new player is still too complex. 3 times chances to reallocate skills points may help them a lot. EVE needs fresh blood all the time. Keep trying to simplify the starting stage please. Add some stories and give each new player a purpose, a direction at the beginning.
---
Outlines why I won't resub. The blackout is good but doesn't fix any of the core issues with eve.
---
What happened to "bigger isn't necessarily better" and "lateral progression"
---
indeed. in my game also the "dont show me this message again" box doesnt seem to work. keep getting the damn messages -.-
---
Wouldn´t that make pretty much all FW LS systems useless (empty) unless it is a frontline system?
---
Some time ago I rolled a new spy character and in order to give him some newbro background I run all the SOE epic arc. Actually there's a bit more to the story than that: char stayed alpha for a while because I kinda lost interest in the spying thing, but I logged in from time to time to set its training queue, so I when I faced Dagan I already had t2 small lasers and a reasonable t2 fit for my punisher. Long story short, to my own disbelief I managed to solo him in a punisher, even tho it took some time.
---
I run t2s solo in under 10minutes  in a 60m isk frigate.. isk/h is shit though. You're better off multiboxing t4s due to the way drops scale.
---
I totally agree on all of these. Especially to delete Fax which is fk shit to make non-capital useless. And now Caps are too strong fighting small ships. Please empower small ships that is the way to empower new players.

The saddest thing is that this was actually true for some time.
---
It's that time of the year people: let's push this to the front page.
---
My PC should easily handle EvE on max settings and yet when I do abyssal sites my fps drops to 20-25fps. Even if I lower all of my settings to minimum it makes no difference. Anyone has any idea on how to improve performance?
---
The faction standing mechanic in FW needs to go. As it now stands your standing will get wrecked rather quickly and it's a pain in the ass to grind it back up. You'd pretty much have to build an alt for it or lose access to half of HS. This faction standing system is a pointless relic of the past.
---
Where is the proof for any of this? It's ironic that you complain about downvotes for 'correct' threads without showing in any way why they are correct.
---
&gt;When CCP management realized how big the “lore event” had completely broke the entire meta of nullsec, they backed off very quickly (and probably decided go pay more close attention to WTF the lore team was coding into the game going forward).
---
How do you know this?
---
&gt;Because it was always intended to be a dumb lore event and never anything more.
---
I could go on saying this.
---
What is this Meta Show?

I personally hate the way that and overview seem to reset each time my sub lapses.

Awesome!

Yeah we need a London underground setting.

Prestidigitation is still bugged. You can unsoil your ship but not resoil it.
---
Counjuring killmarks takes time and effort. And they last more than an hour.
---
And changing the colour of things is stuck behind currency. So its not as good a Cantrip to take in EvE!
---
Send them to me and I double them!
---
It's weak as fuck to any real roaming ships.. anything kitty will eat it alive.
---
You know, a good orthodontist can still save a lot there
---
The mining bonus is from before the days of all the mining ships we have now.
---
They don't use subcap support nowadays? Weird.
---
Just give people a suspect timer if they enter a complex, honestly not even difficult
---
Open Ticket System and report this...
---
Fit please, this looks fun!
---
FAXES - sure
---
TITANS - sure, though I like the DDs, I would keep them for the fun they provide :)
---
CARRIERS/SUPERS - I disagree, like I did in other threads as well. I need to be able to compensate with power what I don't have in numbers. If the only counter to a subcap fleet is a bigger subcap fleet than what happened to the cries of n+1 (or for this narative it is finally fine?). The fact that carriers can be de-fanged so easily should be enough. If a carrier drops sirens it already lost 1/3rd dps, and if the sirens die, it already lost all tackle.
---
Surely you mean for me to 'adapt to ewar that's ineffectual against capitals' or die? No?
---
Apparently I did study economics while you didn't;)
---
PLEX IS NOT A GOOD, PLEX IS A CURRENCY! The good that is bought, is the advantage. If PLEX gets you more isk, you can buy the "advantage" for less $. The demand for "advantage" increases, but not to the extent of the lowered price in $. (natural demand curve: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_curve)
---
So yes, more "advantage" is sold in total. But with LESS $, and only the $ matters for CCP.
---
Also, the part with the movie analogy you nicely ignored. Looks like it made sense but didn't support your thesis right?
---
And about the apple: all you did is prove my point. Yes, the apple faces different strengths of forces and therefore accelerates differently. Nevertheless, even if there are small differences: IT ALWAYS MOVES (and accelerates) towards the earths mass center. The same goes here, the extent it's hurting CCPs income is up for discussion, not the fact that it is!
---
There are a lot of d&amp;d player on Eve so you are in good company. One of my friend makes one shot for his group while they mine. It very funny
---
This may be a dumb question but are there ships that excel at killing carrier fighters ?

Living the eve dream, have fun:)

Let me guess, you live in a c4?

marauders buff to shooting capitals? maybe.

marauders with mini jump drives? fuck no!

What am i looking at? And why would you wear sunglasses when it's kinda dark already?
---
Expedition Frigates are used for sneaky ore, gas or ice harvesting. They have great bonuses (like Endurance’s 50% reduction to ice harvester cycle speed), and are made to move without being seen, Prospect having a CovOps cloak and Endurance loving at normal speed with any cloaking device. 
---
I don’t think they are much used, as mining barges get better yield (I think). However, for a wormholer like me, Prospect is great to harvest gas in wormhole space, since a CovOps cloak is just the best tool you can have on a ship there, and Endurance is great to snatch ice from nullsec space, or sometimes when I get those special Shattered Wormholes (the only wormholes with ice in them).
---
Concerning highsec moons : yeah, technically they are outclassed by lowsec and nullsec moons, since they don’t have access to the rarer moon goo, which is used in T2 production. However, they can still get the +15% yield variant of nullsec ores, which mean even highsec miners have access to great material sources without leaving the "safety" of highsec.
---
LOLOL
---
Some people will sell, some just quit.

Over the years while the total number of high skilled pilot grew, the overall number of active pilots was growing much more slowly.           
---
The problem with the injectors is that rich people (aka those who abused injectors in current meta) will just inject into next best thing that will show up ... and we will be in the same spot again.          
---
Capitals are not the problem, they are dying easily and fast to small groups of people.            
---
The problem is that every average Bob now can inject to one on day 1 .... and many people do it.
---
But you still have to manually select your custom profile on every login in from the launcher settings because it defaults to the default profile every time which is very annoying.
---
Is that necessarily a bad thing?
---
Also, I take contention with this idea in general. There's going to be plenty of behind-enemy-lines action. The best place to hit your enemy is when they're moving to the front, when they're least prepared for a fight.
---
He is talking about the whole idea of gating a battleship that after the CCP warp nefs ... is slow.       
---
This battleship is totally unfit to fight new, buffed small ships.           
---
Assalut frigates will kill it in most cases, same for new T2/T3 destroyer line, not even mentioning the triglavian stuff.           
---
Sure, use a grapler ... and similar stuff, but if the small ship pilot knows that he will fight a battleship he can also fit 1-2 mods that will make this battleship an easy pray even with the grapler and scram
---
I'd say they're basically comparable to great wyrm dragons in d&amp;d, colour depending on race. Sooo, basically 24d10 aoe ?

---
Exactly
---
&gt;The problem with the injectors is that rich people (aka those who abused injectors in current meta) will just inject into next best thing that will show up
---
Yup. I've seen people suggest accelerators instead, but then those will be abused too, it'll just take longer. 
---
&gt;Capitals are not the problem, they are dying easily and fast to small groups of people. 
---
While I agree for the most part, half this sub seems convinced that capitals are the devil and anything above cruiser is bad, that's why there are so many threads about nerfing application and how they should only be able to hit other caps.
---
&gt;The problem is that every average Bob now can inject to one on day 1 .... and many people do it.
---
I'd like to know the number of people who inject into capitals. Not sure CCP would release that info, but from what I'm seeing in game, there are fewer caps including Rorqs than people make out. Granted I'm in brave space not Delve, and I've yet to personally encounter a titan gatecamp, but I'm genuinely curious as to the percentage of the playerbase that own one and trained Vs injected.
---
You are welcome
---
Bring 4 of them.
---
Cynos in low sec are fine  - people need to move their shit around. Just supers and titans need to be removed from low sec.
---
Ability to roll some hole because you don't like it ... it is utterly bad.  Not from perspective "someone krabbing" region is empty need to move to another one, but because if you want to krab in your wormhole you can shut down all doors, or if you show up in unfriendly neighbourhood you can just close the doors.             
---
Let say that you can roll as much as you want static, but all 'travelling' wormholes don't have total mass, but are limited by a life time.            
---
Maybe K space to K space WH could be the same - because most of the times it the "WH" is good it will be collapsed fast as so many people want to use it.         
---
If the WH is bad ... no one cares any way.                 
---
---------------------            
---
Totally different approach.            
---
We have the sov upgrade related to WH ... that people don't want to use - lets be honest it is worthless atm.             
---
What if this Ihub upgrade was having like :                   
---
* 80% chance to spawn WH to other K space           
---
* 20% chance to spawn to C5-C6 space           
---
But the wormholes you get this way **don't have total mass** but only the lifetime limitation.
---
A lvl 5 mission runner can make more than that if only does "Blitz" missions. I was Even more in The past, before so many people farm loyalty points. +/-90.000 lp is nothing that weird.
---
Then you can do DEDs too. Yesterday i ran only 2. 280m on one. +/-500m in the second. That one was a 6/10. If you are lucky you can get +1b in one DED site. I still Remember my first one, it was 1.4b, i almost started to cry XD
---
And yes, we do heavy gate camp in bottlenecks gates, when we do our minning op. You roll every WH, the n gate camp to death, before undock the rorquals. :P
---
10/10 was a lot of fun
---
Why? I am mining in null and loving the local change.
---
I am sure there are decent moons there, find them and take them, and you can moon mine again with local tank.
---
You can kind of check this yourself.                
---
Look for data before the injectors and how many capital skill books (including rorquals) are sold within a year ... and then take the same values year by year after introducing the injectors.            
---
The increase is more or less those people who injected.
---
&gt; Carrier - Carriers would resume triage and would be devoted primarily to supporting fleets of dreads, titans and super carriers. Their function would be to support capital fleets, but they'd be vulnerable to sub caps. Carriers would no longer field fighters, and would no longer be able to use local reps. You'd need to deploy them in groups for them to be effective and support each other as well as an allied cap fleet.
---
Sentries seem a bit too good at hitting subcaps. Spider repping sentry carriers would be pretty scary for anyone to fight.
---
Though being static is an interesting drawback, I agree.
---
&gt; 1 - No more cynos in lowsec. Only coverts. Any cap that moves through lowsec has to use stargates to do so. 2 - Give jump freighters the ability to use covert cynos to move around - this allows them to still jump through lowsec. 3 - Give jump freighters a covops cloak too. 4 - No super caps in lowsec. Titans and supercarriers just wouldn't be able to go there, period. 5 - Restrict titans and supers from using stargates, period. They have to jump, they're too large. 6 - Oh, and restrict titans and supers from using the ansiblex too - they can still use cyno beacons but not the gate. 7 - I'd also prevent combat capital ships of any type from warping to anomolies too. No more cap/super ratting.
---
I like the general lowsec plan, and the narrowing of role for capitals, but I'm not sold on the covops cloak for JFs. I feel like logistics should be something people can mess with.
---
Tell him to bring back the NPC nullsec glory.      
---
Allow the "hunter groups" to trim the sov null sec heard in areas around again.
---
Nah I thank this guy and others like him, because abusing shitty mechanics like this is the only way to convince CCP to do something about it. They don't do shit about problems until they become game breaking.
---
This isn't a brawl, this is a dunk lmao
---
There were quite a few of them around. Collectors that wanted them will already have them.
---
your right, replace the 2013s with 2014s, my bad. rest i stay by what I said.
---
Well the whole positioning is not so important any more.        
---
The structures we have are "HUGE" aka if someone land capital force on one side people can just reposition subaps on another side of structure, to ignore the fighters.             
---
When fighters slowly get to the enemy position, they can reposition again.                           
---
I don't know in how many capital battles you were after the changes, but in all that i was it was either:                   
---
* we land at 0 on enemy ships that are already tackled (or immobile - aka sieged) and we deal the damage or take over the tackle with sirens thus actually dealing a lot of damage                 
---
* we are worthless addition to battlefield as our fighters are just moving between enemy new spots.                 
---
Like there was no middle.                       
---
Additionally with the way how citadels handle capitals, you **cannot** drop capitals on structure forcing enemy to come to you as the structure will just remove your fleet.
---
But congrats for making it out in half structure :)
---
You know he doesnt Even know about the blackout.
---
Bad bot
---
Wrong - The mistake was listening to the 'pro'/'expert' null csm members.
---
The amateurs have never had a say or been listened to.
---
If the amateurs were listend to and not the nullbears:
---
FW/Low Sec would still be thriving.
---
Supers couldn't drop on solo frigates in Black Rise.
---
Ecm would still work (I told everyone the babies would cry about ecm after boosts - i told you so blah blah - that is another story) .
---
Boosts would still help small gangs compete.
---
FW wouldn't have a tier system.
---
Stabbed ships wouldn't be able to activate accelaration gates.
---
Acceleration gates would give engagement timers.
---
People in FW would be able to redeploy without the cancer of jump fatigue makiing logging off the best option for the night.
---
I could honestly go on for pages on the retarded shit changes the so called 'pros' have asked for and had introduced to the game.
---
They never seem to go for the common sense changes because they have afk stabbed farming alts in fw. As the blackout tears taught us - null bears hate having to play the game and they will only push for changes that lead to or improve afk isk faucets.
---
The journey is important too, not just the destination :P Joke aside I think a lot of people that don't have time to grind plex their pvp endevours.
---
You know - maybe the first timer can be partially TZ tanked and the final dictated more by the aggressor.    
---
I played in the stront based timers, and 4AM times in the middle of the week were shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit mechanic back then and now many players have kids.
---
For me EVE should allow many game styles and not be limited to one.           
---
Stuff like this ;        https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cge82a/armchair_game_design_a_game_that_have_over_16yo/
---
For the record none of the faxes get those traditional bonuses anymore. The ninazu/lif lost the cap booster bonus and the apostle/mino lost the capacitor pool bonus.
---
NIPs and NAPs (are those even a thing outside of coalitions?) are a natural respons to the climate. The NIP between Imperium and legacy for example exists for several reasons.
---
* Culturally we're similar so we have a small bond there.
---
* We both dislike/hate Panfam, so if Panfam attacked Legacy, The imperium would most likely help Legacy because 1) Fun and 2) Fuck Panfam.
---
* If the Imperium were to invade Legacy everyone would turn on us because 1) Fun, 2) Fuck Goons and 3) Opportunity.
---
* From The Imperiums perspective the NIP is in our favour.
---
* There's nothing to gain from invading the other party.  
---
The current stalement won't necessarily last. It's easy to say N+1 wins the day but just because The imperium outnumber you 5 to 1 in Supers (no idea if those numbers are true) this won't stay the same unless we make 5 times as many new Supers in the comming year. You might not like this idea but in the current game it's what you need to do to stay relevant. It is not too late to adapt.  
---
I personally wouldn't mind if Supers were nerfed to hell/changed drastically but doing so might kill the game faster than null turning stale.
---
I don't think Guerilla tactics and economic warfare is as dead as you claim. Sure it requires a lot of effort but I'm quite sure it was like that in the past too. Especially now during the blackout it should be very much possible to cause havoc.  
---
Changes might be needed a problem here I think is as many have said too much information but in my opinion everyone seem to think too small. Imagine what could be done if killmails were removed or adjusted so you wouldn't see who killed the target unless the attacker himself added that information. Imagine if the API were restricted so Alliances wouldn't know everything their members did. Imagine if you wouldn't know everything that happens in every system all the time, as it is now you know when sov changes as soon as it happens, you know where ratters rat, you know where people gather. There's just too much information given out freely.
---
As for the Rorqual I don't see the problem is that they mine too much, already a Rorqual and two Hulks mines more than 3 Rorquals (this is only what I've heard). The problem is that Hulks need constant attention and it's harder to scale up your operations so many miners just opt in going for more rorquals because they don't need to micromanage them every minute. Don't bother nerfing Rorquals output, just make it more engaging so you can't multibox 10 of them at the same time.  
---
A problem with nerfing Rorquals outright is that you harm the person who don't multibox more than the guy who multibox.
---
Honestly thats the way it should be. Most capital pilots have spent years training and billions of isk to get in that capital. Its called top end content. 
---
The amazing part of eve is that they cant just go around swatting hundreds of sub caps by themself with no consern like other games top end content. 
---
Go find some friends , if you need to ask let me know i will direct you, grab about 20 of them and a bomber each. THEN watch how quickly the shoe is on the other foot.
---
Or Glasgow. Much simpler.
---
You do have some good points. The current VNI ratting leads to two major issues widely discussed on Reddit or EVE forum: afk ratting and botting. 
---
After VNI revamp, bots can still use other ships. Myrms and domis are very likely to be the candidates. They should be easier preys, because you should not expect bots to become capable to fight back. Sounds fine.
---
As for afk ratting, some people think it is an issue, but I don't see it matters much. Guess CCP wants to make alpha accounts have a bitter life and then upgrade to omega. I don't mind.
---
Not quite the same thing though ;)
---
Titan guns give an incentive to put as many as possible on field.
---
I'd honestly like to see DD's removed with titan guns, and a much much larger focus put on links and the clone vat bay. Make titans an actual command unit.
---
This solves the issue with titan blobbing. After all why would you want more links on field? If you lose more than a couple titans, you've almost certainly lost the fight anyway, excluding B-R level events.
---
Then they don’t need to be nearly as expensive no? I thought the whole reason they got implemented like this was so that there weren’t many of them. 
---
Power and cost are in a big battle always.
---
I would argue that you need to be in FW to enter a plex to avoid issues all together
---
Join goons
---
Here's an armor brawling doctrine fit for mixed newbro/bittervet wh group:
---
DPS: any armor tanked ship you can fly with 1600mm t2 plate, two EANMs, DC2 and 3 trimark rigs (brutix, prophecy, aug navy, vni even etc etc.
---
Upgrade to HACs as you get more skill or command ships sacrilege, damnation etc
---
Logi -  T2 very much preferred - this is your more skilled guys in guardians, or augs if you're really struggling, but your likely to die
---
Support, curse, falcon, bhaal etc depending how rich you're gonna get.
---
Stay in range of the hole, scram, web, blap, jump and gtfo if things start going south
---
So in theory I believe you could easily actively manage to click away at least 10 titans at once if your attention was limiting factor? 1 min active with 2x titans, warp and safe up and Start with the next two?
---
I can see where the True end game is headed at current meta!
---
Good.  Wormholes are supposed to be Eve on Hard setting.
---
I have no idea why you'd turn something off, then create something that turns it back on again, that would be pretty much compulsory for everyone to have, that needs babysitting, fueling, whatever and that most people in the game except higher up logistics and people with roles, will never interact with.
---
"Content"
---
Have you guys looked at removing the docking of supers from Keepstars? Needing a separate alt for it was a big hurdle to overcome that helped balance blob alliances, in goons you can literally singlebox a titan and not care, that’s part of the reason for the supercap proliferation and the overpowered blob alliances. Really hurting smaller alliances that can’t field a keepstar.
---
Original CCP obviously had a reason to not allow them to dock at stations when making the game, maybe new CCP needs to look into that reason again.
---
Also keepstars will still be much better defensive platforms than forts so it’s not like they’ll be useless, and at 150bn each they’re chump change for most big alliances.
---
it's 2019, eve is on it's way out (still some years ahead, but the course is clear).
---
ccp won't win this anymore. drastic changes are likely to throw off more players, and at some point, pearl abyss will ask what's going on in iceland.
---
the best they can do is trying to keep the game afloat and modernize certain outdated parts.

&gt; The problem is we have a bunch of new bros and it's hard for us to ask everyone to train into Triglavian ships.

Do you have a hard time comprehending what you read?
---
Or virtually any subcaps with logi support - structures are extremely oppressive towards caps when gunned, but can't really touch subcaps without comparable support fleet on grid.
---
Content for whom?  Not for the average player, no.  There are already plenty of structures to shoot.

---
Domis for truly full afk ratting... warp in, get aggro, drop drones, facetank and jump into your pool
---
Lol, ye.
---
Except goons.
---
This is true, but why the living in nullsec was so risky?               
---
Each NPC null was having one or more "pirate" groups that just farmed all stuff around.            
---
They could form usually 30-50 people and contest sov areas around.            
---
People farmed ratters, keeped them constantly in check.         
---
Just to give you an idea, we took a 15 man fleet to period basis ... and we were circling around the area killing ship after ship quite often 1-2 capitals per raid ... until FC got bored and decided that it is time to go home.            
---
While we moved home we usually had to fight other group that was moving in or camping the entry/exit point  - so it was fun times.                   
---
Why this changed?                      
---
Like you cannot live now in NPC space in a 500 man alliance.              
---
You cannot feed those people.           
---
Just to give you the list of stuff that affected this :            
---
* Anomaly / escalation buff - killed the value of scanned combat sites  ^(just to give an example, nightmare BPC was worth over 900mil ... while plex was 350)          
---
* Ship balancing/adjustments killed many faction ship usability. ^(aka people used Nightmares for PVE ... now just go with the 1500k dps rattle)                            
---
* Introduction of new T2/T3 small hulls **killed cynabal** people living in curse farmed those BPC in lp store.          
---
* Belt ratting is gone ^(escalation/anomaly, reprocessing etc) My first dreads i build from belt ratting minerals.                 
---
* Moon mining gone ^(people that seen mining as appealing didn't live in NPC space any way, they were also kicked fast if someone found them mining &lt;3)                   
---
* LP stores are dead, the frigate burner missions were the final nail to the pirate lp stores. Unless you have OP ships like gila or stratios that fit in current meta game ... 10 people with alts farming burner missions can supply the market with implants. **Quite often you are filling the holes in full implant sets obtained from the faction drops**.                  
---
Like there is nothing left in NPC nullsec to support those hunters any more.          
---
Just to give you some other idea. Industry in NPC null is so fucked up now ... that it is better to buy dread hulls from krabs in sov space.          
---
CCP will not make nullsec dangerous again without those hunters back to NPC areas again.
---
My current DnD group is old school friends from way back when. 
---
None of them have done any large scale gaming online or on voice comms ever.  As such, comms gets fucking messy even though there's less than 10 of us.
---
The DM asked for a way to "nod at the DM" to signify you wanted to talk.
---
I was like sure, just X up in chat when you want to say something.
---
So now at random points my roll20 chat window is filled with the party Xing up to chat to NPCs or take their turn in a conversation.
---
I was pretty proud of that one. Two of them have asked where Xing up is from. I haven't told them yet.
---
Minesweeper in stations
---
"doing bad things is ok because only then people can see they're bad" - god i hate this logic.
---
Lmao didn't even think of code. 
---
Although when I was a fresh noob mining in high sec, a code ganker killed me, I looted his wreck and got 7mil of stuff.
---
Made me feel rich at the time
---
&gt; I had a huge haul of ~1.5M ISK
---
Oh boy, you're going to be in for a shock when you get a good haul from a relic site.
---
loved the targeting indicators and then the KM spear.  Solid gold.
---
yeah the waiting is fine
---
and if they moved a similar number of titans to evenly escalate snuff would just roll over.
---
It's only a week training for t2 frigs isn't it. I think of people as newbies up to like an year of training basic skills.
---
try out spectre fleets. and do the stuff that is a bit irregular. F1 monkeying a bomber is boring. However, there are many jobs in a fleet fight that also makes you better in small scale stuff, like tackling, making pings and engaging the enemy support ships etc
---
Coon is short for raccoon
---
They... Did kinda drop a Hel, a Nid, 8 Revelations, and 9? Neut Legions. Anything dies pretty quickly when you shotgun it 57v1.
---
But yes. Good kills are good. Bob smiles.
---
I think I like you:)
---
It's still true not every alliance has dozens of supers and Titans to drop around the clock. Subcap support us still very important no matter what Reddit memes tell you.
---
“Evenly” lol
---
See, the problem here isn't bringing the titan itself but umbrella part - doing dumb things with caps or supers is extremely safe, because currently there are no real ways to punish it, umbrellas have enough numbers to be able to ad-hoc deal with moderately sized dreadbomb or a bomber blob without having to form proper fleet, and any mistake you could make in a supercap in range of the umbrella is irrelevant as long as you have cyno and are able to scream for help on comms. I'm all for people dropping titans randomly left and right, as long as it doesn't take over a hundred dreads to maybe score one or two titan kills before everyone gets DD'd off the field by a titanblob that covers 10k+ players with jump range from staging.
---
I don´t know, I just want more action overall in FW and more incentive for players to join it.
---
I´d rather see his frontline idea combined with no cyno and capitals for all non frontline systems and only non gated plexes and maybe even higher LP generation there, so there is allways group action at the frontline. 
---
And then have the rest of the FW systems have fewer and smaller plexes the further they are away from frontline.

Dreads were buffed sort of when fax diminishing returns hit. Big dread numbers are a serious threat now.
---
This siunds exactly as a paid advertise
---
TL;DR near2 authors cant maths
---
If you serve 2500 players a month, thats 10+% of all players a day, assuming they each have 1-2 alts its like 23% of all daily players.
---
I imagine if you looked into the split between HS/LS/WH and nullcrabs, I guarantee the actual overall percentage of kills denied by near2 matches the percentage of players using it - which is, at a guess, about 10-20% of nullsec **minimum** based on the non-wrong parts of the maths in OPs post. Sounds like the shitposters are wrong and he doesnt want to admit hes helped harm eve
---
I'm picturing a 1930's-1950's melodramatic voiceover guy: *SKILL EXTRACTOR MADNESS!!*
---
oh, yeah, i know. i'm just saying that that's one of the changes ccp threw into the game to deal with combat refitting - ninazus with 5 heavy cap boosters in the mids that were literally not possible to neut out
---
"You all meet in ~~a tavern~~ Jita local."
---
at that point you're bottlenecked by space. even in good true sec systems, with full pirate detection upgrades, more than one titan in a system feels crowded, although two is doable with site-calling and a bit of patience
---
so you're gonna need at least 5 mil-5 fully upgraded systems to support 10 titans
---
however you're probably looking at around 2-2.5b/hr once you're rolling

No it should not. Also the ingame stats should disappear. Ive never really understood why you should have any intel whatsover into others sov but then again I dont really understand why people owning sov dont have intel in their own systems either. But hey, the small gangs which bring enormous amounts of money and content and in general are such wonderful people to have around need to helped.
---
And remember kids, space is dangerous and harsh. But if you ree enough you dont need to have it dangerous and harsh, cause your special. Your mother told me so.

Forreal though, sdeeel kept us updated through the fight, and it by both accounts you had a hell of a time.

Wait, so you are actually crying on behalf of large groups? You think Eve is easy for a small roaming gang? And CCP needs to do more to make it harder for small gangs? You think a small roaming gang is actually a threat to destroy your “cities and factories” without “any real danger?” 🤔😀😂🤣

I like the idea of "frontline" systems. There would still be things to do such as belt ratting in the off systems.

I only joined FW like 3 months ago, but i am very excited to see everyone getting involved in making suggestions to make it a better pvp experience. Can't wait to see where this goes.

That little guy narrative and blatant nullsec powerbloc bias disguised as a "CSM update" holy fuck. IMO that goes against everything the CSM was created for and should warrant your instant removal from the CSM.
---
Mister Dunk, I'm gonna tell you a phrase I've never heard:
---
*"Oh gee, these smallgangers got my ratting carrier/vni, better go back to HS i guess".* 
---
But here's a phrase that I've heard a lot:
---
*"Powerbloc XYZ is entosising our sov with fucking titans, just to show us who's boss, well dudes, it's been fun, time to pack up or become a renter."*
---
Small entities don't make it because they have access to local, they make it because they either are already big enough to enter into agreements with larger entities, or because they occupy space litterally nobody wants. Powerblocs are pissed that they now actually have to provide umbrellas for their renters or risk losing their "little guy" income.
---
Or to give it its other name, how to build a Sabre.  
---
https://np.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/46hzin/do_you_want_to_build_a_sabre/
---
Soon(tm)
---
Limiting factor for blobs used to be ship numbers and reaction time, both making random supercap responses scary due to looming threat of potential dreadbomb being ready for what you bring unprepared (let me remind for like 100th time how CO2 was dreadbombed in Impass). The "blob issue" is more of umbrella issue - with how many people you can comfortably put in range of single staging for their ratting/mining and a lot of them contributing to the umbrella with super/titan/fax it's virtually impossible for even decently sized groups to sneak in enough dreads to pose a threat to a flash form response without losing handful of supers.
---
Even if you won't get nuked on every drop those should be possible and happen every so often, at least as a way to deter cap pilots from randomly dropping on everything that moves.

Red Giant - SB battleships, t1, t2 logi
---
Vanilla - t1 prophecy, damnation, typhoon fleet torps with paint support, logi, webs with aim to go triglav

Nullsec - anything small for ganks, you probs cant deal with big shit yet i imagine.

---
Newbro with rifter won't have place there. It's too easy to camp.
---
Why people put a shit fit like that on a 10B ship? If you solo moove at least out a solo combat fit it can help.
---
Yeah structure are so good to decloak because it s big ;D
---
Would increasing Torpedo application against large sig radius targets help abit here? 
---
Potentially subcap fleets of torpedo frigs could become a hard counter against supercaps.
---
That wouldn't fix the issue that having 200 dudes in hounds or manticores is far inferior to having 200 dudes in supers.
---
For situations like this, you want lots of friends with lots of bait suicide cynos. 
---
Oh, and since not being caught is the only thing that will save you, it is usually best to fly through less populated 0.0 areas than through low sec.
---
Better luck next time!
---
Making bigger ships have less EHP per material isn't really an issue. The entire point being made in these comments is that capitals shouldn't be a better replacement for subcapitals. If all everyone cared about was isk efficiency of the ships they used vs what they give, you'd be seeing nothing but T1 frigate/destroyer pvp. Clearly that is not the case.
---
I learned something new today. That’s what I love about Eve.

And what about citadels allowing docking, repairs and refit in hostile space, while being technically neutral?

Heard this one before and I don't think you have thought it through. You'll get fights alright, but you'll get farmed by pirates in bling kikimoras. Over and over again. (More so than you are at the moment.).

The key problem is economic, not citadels , not the mechanics of system contest.

P.S. I dont wanna lose anything whilst Im killing these big things either. So, nerf application while youre at it.

Fk off don’t nerf my capital.
---
Hell when haw was being talked about, almost nobody said anything.  People just thought “weee my cap gets a buff”. 
---
When they invented space aids, the community for 4 years bitched that they felt limited on how to move their capital.
---
1) use subcaps... no
---
2) use gates... no
---
The community, the people, want instant teleporting sniper ships that are huge, can take on anything, and can survive long enough for massive backup to arrive.

This is what the community wants.

Is it right... no.... but people don’t want their favorite cannon changed.

I'd say "newbie" is something you can fly as an alpha, since if you go omega, you have at least a basic grip on the game.

*2000 m - Cynosural Field*
---
6-10 people is quite hard for C4, I don't think going for an armor brawling doctrine in cruiser/BC size is the answer, you will struggle against all the bigger groups, and it doesn't look like you can allow yourself to loose that much. 
---
You can try smaller stuff, like T3D + Command destroyers. You have enough number for ganking farming ships/fleets or playing with bigger groups. Boosher is a good job to become a good pilot, and can bring lot of realy funny situations when mistakes are done!
---
But for home defense, the best defense in my opinion: be good space buddies, take fights, explode stuff, get exploded and don't be salty. Bigger groups will recognize you as content generators and help you if some overwhelming group try and eviction.
---
For smaller corps trying to evict (less than 2x your number), you can have smaller friends or you will have to prepare some big stuff and get your citadels well fitted.
---
Some ideas of "cores" ships:
---
\-Lots of capitals
---
\-Fax + Rattlesnake
---
\-Fax + Leshak
---
\-Nestor + Leshak
---
\-Sniper Machariels
---
But you need more skills and budget for that. If you want to try cheaper, but less effective:
---
\-Sniper Abaddons (with 1400 artillery for volley)
---
\-Armor BS brawl + Nestor
---
\-RR Dominix with boosts and fitted sensor booster ( or remote )
---
Booshing pilots can always help to cut the numbers or position your fleet
---
The idea is getting advantage of being at home, you don't have to care about mass and ennemi will have to come to get your citadels.
---
Hope it was of some use, and see you in space o7

Noted :) ty!
---
Would just like to remind all of those calling for the rollback on FAX to triage carriers that we are now in a very different world to what we were in then. 
---
 - Combat refitting being available made a huge difference and allowed these platforms to be viable
---
 - We are now able to field more damage now than ever available before - particularly so in the smallgang environment
---
 - The abundance and low cost of neut platforms such as the Bhaalgorn (Neut pressure not even being mentioned in the above balance discussion of FAXes)
---
Being a wormholer, I would say I have experienced the pain of oppressive triage. Where fleets of 30 vs 30 would slug it out and only break a ship when the triage pilot eventually succumbed to carpal tunnel or ran out of cap charges. But that isn't the world we live in anymore.

 - Availability of full Neut/Nos Talisman Bhaalgorns force an inject triage meta, meaning the triage can only provide a single cycle of RR or Local Repair per cap inject. This pushes a huge skill ceiling on the triage pilot and honestly makes it the hardest ship to fly by quite a margin. Don't believe me? [Check out the triage perspective in this recent WH fight](https://youtu.be/2TsKXC8UcK0). Shoutout to Ehefkae. 
---
 - Triglavian meta (where we've now seen fleets of 20+ Leshaks) combined with the above means a triage literally can't provide enough RR onto split targets, even with 3b+ deadspace slaved fit subcaps and 10b+ triage fits.
---
 - Abyssal Modules. We now have 99% Serpentis webs that allow cap-gun dreads to perfectly apply to skirm-mindlinked AB Cruisers orbiting at 500m.
---
That, combined with the older tactics of bumping triage to split the fight, using alpha comps to break subs before reps land or just holding grid until the triage runs out of charges, means there are many many ways to deal with the FAX menace, sometimes it just takes a little more creativity than shooting it with 110 Muninns or 50 Abaddons.

I think there is like a whole package of things here that you should bury very deep inside another trash can than yourself.
---
what
---
Bring a ceptor or a saber and be a hero. If you want to f1. Then you have to ship up.
---
So....
---
A "mini-dread" that costs the same, does less damage, and takes longer to train into?
---
What they really need to do is get rid of HAWs, and if they want to take it farther, make a BS with a smaller sig that can fit anti-cap weapons. 
---
We already have a ship that's specialized for quick in and out attacks and is specialized to apply to cap ships. They're called bombers.
---
Home defense: t1 armor BS with logi (t2 if possible), refits for brawling and projection + utility mids.
---
Mini heavy armor: keep it cheap and low-ish sp until you get large enough to reliably find opponents in your weight class. Augment fleet with as many HA armor certified BS as your chain will take both ways, in addition to your cruisers/BC's, to make up for numbers. Learn to pick which opponents you can realistically fight in this manner without just feeding. Fitting advice on this topic already posted in this thread.
---
Something that fits through frigate holes.
---
Everything else: Nanogang and insurance tanked t1 BC/BS for general chain ganking and small gang fighting to maximize per-pilot-strength. 
---
For nano in j-space, avoid the anti-tackle trap, the % of ceptor and frig pilots in j-space is much lower than null, with tackle mostly replaced by easily blappable dictors and more beefy BC's/t2/t3 cruisers are commonplace, so bias your gang towards dps. Less newbro caracals. More kiting brutix/vexor/hurricanes.

Dear fanboy

His lack of education is incredible.
---
Why don't you speak without insulting?
---
Your parents didn't educate you?
---
Dont be coy.
---
"Ok, I believe you."
---
Small gang and solo pvp, he also had a podcast called BSB iirc.
---
No habla retard
---
They have told me not to make stupid statement in public otherwise people will throw shit at you. I didn't learned at first but life did that for me, I'm sure you can learn the same way.
---
Those are rookie numbers, you gotta pump those up.
---
Now CPPh when it will launch EVE echoes?
---
Will it be worse than second galaxy?
---
One thing is for sure it will be a beautiful competition.
---
When you accept the mission it goes into your hanger inventory, not your ships cargo.
---
I read this entire thing thinking, "This feels like NanDe" just to read your name at the end. 
---
Well put.
---
Who is CPPh?
---
lol, i see a primitive base builder grind and equip game, the usual mobile f2p stuff programmed by 3 chinese schooldropouts with a construction template kit for mobile games in their parents basement ...
---
I have to assume this is sarcastic.
---
+1 I love alliteration.
---
A few questions:
---
1. What is CCPh?
---
2. Parlez-vous Francais?
---
I dig it.
---
Oh ok. I will try it but Would it be possible for you to make a short video of you doing urself? Im still very worried about losing 50mil since i dont have much capital since im quite new.
---
Being able to get a notification and in-game pop-up stream would be super cool (perhaps with a polite delay).  It would add another factor to the ship-spinning meta, i.e. a reason to log-in.  And no, Twitch is shite.
---
Looks like he's doing hisec sites though, isn't this pretty much as good as it gets for hisec?
---
My education is very good.
---
They taught me to discuss contrary ideas.
---
What people do you talk to?
---
Everything you say is stupid.
---
Being a fanboy and not wanting to listen to what you don't want ... better leave reddit or learn education.
---
bull fucking shiiiiiiet
---
No, this is about Horde.
---
oh look, another one of these threads
---
Can I change my vote for CSM?  They really need you
---
It's got to be the second before you blow your load, not the second after, surely.
---
Take anything vaguely menacing to delve and they will kill you. Especially corvettes since they're obviously cyno alts.
---
Why twice?
---
So I'm curious why no more cynos in lowsec? If you remove supers from low that means no more titan bridging, so the only things that can drop are carriers and dreads, with haw removal that means subcap support is desperately needed because fighters are easily killed. The only way they could come in is t3c covert cyno which would still be allowed. 
---
I ask because "suitcasing" fitted ships is an essential part of fw I wouldnt have much use for a gating carrier other than home defense in a system I occupy. Some people would literally have caps trapped in basgerin for all eternity making the system unassailable without producing a cap fleet there as well.
---
In a reasonable solo fit, doesn't an AF even tank more ehp/s than a T1 armor bs these days heh?
---
Or if the video is too annoying, Could u add me in game and i come watch u in a pod to see how u do it?
---
Have you seen the games that ccp has published on android?
---
Those games are real crap.
---
It's hard to argue something when you can't understand the meaning of half the sentences.
---
Thats just crazy talk.
---
Not listening to "pro"/"expert" null csm people doesn't mean that the "amateurs" would get anything correct on their own.
---
hon hon hon
---
Use the logical friend, which seems to cost you to think.
---
The translator changed CCP to that.
---
Wasn't it so difficult?
---
&gt; Dropping 30 T3C's on a ship that wouldn't stand a chance against a single one of them, and fleeing/ cloaky camping before any response shows up. That's not a gf, or PvP. It's being risk averse. The same thing they complain about other people being.
---
This is not a problem specific either to T3Cs nor the blackout. And would be the same problem regardless of what ships the attackers brought be it T3Cs, stratioses, or even retributions. ratters get turbo dunked when people attack them. That's just what happens which is why as a ratter you have to have your head on a swivel at all times to protect yourself.
---
I do agree with you tho that it barely qualifies as pvp and is decidedly not elite pvp as many would proclaim.
---
&gt;Well a roaming gang is a valid target for a cap drop, but they'll complain. So newbro in the mining barge he saved a week for/his vexor that's his pride and joy should have an equal platform to complain.
---
Newbro in his barge/vexor should join standing fleet and get in a pvp ship when roamers show up. I have no sympathy for him if hes not helping ward them off himself.
---
it's a shame you guys didn't get to loot the field, you could have hoarded so much reactive gas!
---
Capitals are not immortal with Remote reps nerfed. They need to be immune to ewar or they would be useless.
---
what the fuck are you trying to finger bang into the keyboard? no one knows, nor cares to undestand, what an offbrand Kmart CCP knock off mobile game is trying to do
---
No, I have no interest in them, mobile games are crap and for kids generally. I only play EVE, mobile grinders with the single purpose to rip of clients (especially kids) are disgusting pieces of shit ...
---
I am using a translator and I understand what you say.
---
Is it that you are not able to understand the translator? or it is only your language, which is inferior and lacks such a diversity of words.
---
That's right, English does not express even half that of Spanish.
---
lower language
---
He's probably not flying as CCP Hilmar though, most eve employees are encouraged to play, but they can't reveal that they are eve employees and can't be part of any major group leadership. Also means they probably never experience what it's like to manage large corps or alliances.
---
Estoy usando un traductor y entiendo lo que dices.

Rofl the BM astra decloak that kills me
---
It seems to cost you to *put in some fucking effort*. If you knew the translator was *supposed* to not put in a 'h', then wasn't it so difficult to take it out?
---
I'm french and english is a very easy and straight forward language. I learned spanish and it's very much not the case. Maybe your education wasn't so great after all.
---
He could also see that from the data though (especially in faction warfare), warp core stabs prevent conflicts unless you fit multiple scrams.
---
Yeah,and then I switched it to my ship's cargo,but when I docked at the thing where I was supposed to deliver it it said that the item isn't in my inventory,and my mission wasn't completed.
---
We still lack the full details for this event, but CCP_FALCON gave us a few pointers on how it's gonna be!
---
What we know so far though is that any NPC will do! So feel free to go grind standing with any NPC Corp/faction doing security missions (LV4s will probably give the best bang for your buck here).
---
yes, the power creep changed a lot of stuff.        
---
Like (don't know how many years ago) my mission running dominix was caught.          
---
It was 3 cruisers (2 T2) and a initial tackling frigate.       
---
Because missions that i was doing didn't require long range, it was fit with neuts and omni armor tank. ^(CONCORD RATS)                
---
For 15min i was able to fight those 4 ships, cycling rep and using neuts.               
---
I died, didn't killed any thing, but mostly due to lack of point as 2 cruisers at the end where deep in structure.      
---
This kind of fight could be no possible in current EVE.     
---
Current power creep is just so immense, this battleship would melt to current T2/T3/Precursor destroyers.               
---
/u/CCP_Falcon maybe it is something CCP should consider looking into.
---
Also based on the patches implemented, it looks like they were never supposed to shoot structures.
---
This is why web/tp drones are shit, and why unbonused e-war hulls are frowned upon.
---
Yeah, you might want to train Reading Comprehension V and go have another attempt at my OP.
---
you can get 100mil not too uncommonly from hisec ghost sites since high and lowsec are the only ones that drop shattered villard wheels.
---
Then we think the same.
---
Ccp should invest in EVE and not in android.
---
But in this reddit everyone kisses ccp's ass.
---
No one is able to see their mistakes.
---
EVE needs translation into more languages now!
---
ccp do not throw more money on android.
---
I meant to fly through there last night. Then saw over 100 ships killed on the map and changed my mind. Was wondering what it was all about.
---
Thanks for the report :)
---
What's the avg payout for these site, based on tier?
---
What is a nat 1 here?
---
ARMOUR HACS!
---
Pretty much all subs other than BS hulls and glass-cannon frigates can defang carriers.  And pretty much all hulls cruiser and down can deal with dreads fine.
---
Are you sure your angst is not super-capital related?
---
Hmm, I guess maybe that could help too. Wouldn't impact capacitor either. thanks!
---
Imagine being so retarded that you think subs are obsolete lmfao
---
&gt; What is the issue again?
---
He lives in a wormhole and plays eve like wow.
---
If it makes you feel any better, I had close to 500M in the cargo hold of an Astero. I KNEW how to do ghost sites. It was late at night. Forgot to turn off my MWD and slingshotted out of range of the can.
---
Was pretty grumpy for a bit after that. 
---
Use a cheap ship on those until you figure it out, if you can. Hacking skills help a lot.
---
Wait Dead Terrorists are alive again?
---
Remove drones too.
---
Look up "Hilariously Dumb EVE players QQING over a Loss" on YT. It is long but it is funnier than shit to listen to two scammers attempt to threaten legal action to get reimbursed for ships they lost.
---
What porpoise is there to this?
---
"No less than 12 Black Legion spies"
---
It really is fucking sad how true this is.
---
My comprehension ends you are so unskilled u need a EWAR to kill capitals.
---
Ow. And I thought I had made pretty questionable decisions lately.
---
Good one!
---
Only a small portion of gankers are doing any calculations as to what is "worth it" from an isk or sec status point of view. That's one of the biggest carebear myths out there. Especially since James 315 reimburses all ganking losses, even if they are also being reimbursed by someone else. Most gankers just ask "do I have enough dps", and since you can gank Ventures in a corvette, the answer is rarely no.
---
&gt; basically allow you to be safer
---
I wonder why...
---
Oh, that's it! It's because they make you safer when flying a combat ship. A combat ship should not be useless in combat. 
---
Maybe a compromise is in order for those who desire safe travel site to site. Adding stabs could disable all mods that cause aggression (including drones) from being used while the stabs are installed. Now you have the useless for combat combat ship you desired. That is what you want, right?
---
like they already are?
---
Or just bored bees
---
i never understood this argument. courier contracts have been there forever. been using public couriers since 09, only singleboxing and never had this logistical problm

Jesus this thread is toxic. Hunters use many free intel tools to find their prey, from ingame tools like the map statistics that show recent player activity, zkillboard streams of kills, dotlan activity maps, bounty offices, etc etc. You have a lot of nerve shitting on one of the few tools the hunted have to defend themselves given how much free intel hunters get. Way to be douchebags ya all.

Is it better to start the game as a free character with all it's limitations, to see whether I like the game? 
---
Or, is it better to upgrade to the paid character because this will give me a better view of what's capable in the game?

For all I know, the paid content might not even really 'kick in' until many hours into the game.

Thanks :)

haha, heavy cap boosters.

Triple capital cap booster double heavy, baby.

Friendly fire is a happy accident in a game like Eve.

One is the date by which you can redeem the item. The other is accelerator's expiry date.

&gt;*A SOLO* Newbro with rifter won't have place there.

Said newbro's fast rifter could easily have a place in the camp itself charging down targets and tackling them.

Use nano fleet. T2 trivalgian crusiers or one of many ships available in game. You want to kill capitals solo? Try leshak or other capitals.
---
No immunity equals few griffins or other 1 mill ship turn 3000x times more expensive ship to be useless.

Lemme get this straight, you self destruct and cyno in the last couple of seconds to reduce the time the cyno is visible on the overview?
---
This Nyx deserved to die, and you don't deserve to have one either, lol.
---
The term "unintentional emergence" also exists
---
Yes, but it is misleading for most of the players.     
---
TBH i did not expect so short 'lifetime of those accelerators.
---
You again? You're just trolling, and you're not even good at it.
---
List those many ships for me, please. Which other capitals?
---
I disagree, before titans could be put on grid in overwhelming numbers, subcap fights did not necessarily go to the higher numbers.  There is enough skill in subcap fights to negate a numbers advantage.  In a big call to arms fight over a keepstar, the side with the most titans wins 100% of the time, nothing changes that.
---
Because of that, nobody will be able to become an industrial powerhouse as GOONS will just stomp all over them before they can reach critical mass.
---
Legacy is the next biggest industrial player and I suspect if our numbers started competing with Delve we'd be deleted.
---
I get the frustration part, spending years grinding and Skilling into a titan just to have it nerfed is the second worst thing that could happen.  The worst thing that can happen is you skill and grind into a titan only to find the game is dead and you have nothing to shoot with it.
---
Exactly.
---
No
---
So cute! Can we keep him please
---
Iirc aoe weapons being massive drains on server resources as well as other jank like if your mine was triggered in hisec were the reasons why mines were removed to start with.

Yes. That was the plan :)
---

Make sure you took it to the correct place. Also make sure you did indeed put it in your ship's cargo (not a specialised hold).
---
Afaik these are the shortest duration accelerators that they have given out yet. It's caught a lot of people even those used to handling event accelerators off guard.
---
Well that was 10 years ago. Maybe with a new way of how they work and with above question list answered, it could work. I dunno, maybe think about it?
---
Reeeee.

Im the one dude that, after every roam, selfdestructs in space to safe the time and not flying back 20 jumps, just to realize i was sitting in my training pod... again
---
"Years training" Ever heard of skill injectors?
---
I wouldn’t mind if Blops BS got a fitting bonus to fit capital guns, and enough of a damage bonus to be around 4-5k DPS, just like bombers to torpedoes.
---
Wat
---
Oh Dear...
---
**Titans:**  
---
Lances are already Racial Typed, and already consume Fuel...  
---
Aura-bot titan sounds good, but the mobility makes it pointless unless the range is so huge it might as well be a pos-booster again.  
---
Titans are already largely just DD-Bridge bots with bonus guns.  One of their current limitations is actually fitting room for the different tools.  
---
**Supers:**  
---
Sounds fine on paper, but in reality unless titan:super tank is adjusted, a few lance titans (with brain dead, guarantee'd to hit 1 dread targeting) would work better than some fighters which have multiple glaring weaknesses currently.  Their weaknesses are in contrast to their strengths, and so they perform in a very binary manner (useless or OP).  Fighters need to be redesigned in some fashion that is not a damage or damage/application change.  Your change is essentially 'buff super ehp and damge relative to other ships', and I feel that is misguided.  
---
**Carrier:**  
---
While I get what you are coming at here, I think the idea of capital repairs may be fundamentally flawed.  The description sounds like you deleted carriers, then renamed faxes to carriers, and added a role bonus for sentries...  Carriers and super carriers overlap too much.  Supers should field DPS Fighters, and carriers should field SS and Support fighters.  
---
This would allow Carriers to support both Sub-capital and Super-Capital fleets in unique ways.
---
**FAX:** 
---
Fax should be deleted unless structures become repairable and lose damage caps.  
---
**Dreads:**  
---
Dreads are generally fine imo, and represent a good baseline to measure against.  Their DPS is being overshadowed by Titans, and encroached upon by Triglavians.  Both of these are signs of power-creep.  Issues with dreads are typically logistical in nature.  
---
HAW guns should be replaced by Mauraders (PVE marauders are almost obsolete in 2019 eve).
---
I think they would need to definitely be single target weapons and properly anchored structures not loose items like Interdiction probes or missiles to be remotely viable from a "doesn't butt fuck the server" standpoint.
---
Yeah please no.
---
But mooooooooohoooooom :(
---
i agree :(
---
Yes, like if you see expiry on the the list you don't expect that this item will be useless in around a week.
---
Oh lol old flair
---
If they come in the shape of an anchorable structure, do you agree that you get a little red button in your item menu to make them go boom?
---
Blobbing is much better in null.
---
As someone who is subbed in r/eve and r/dnd this was confusing at first to see which sub this post was from.
---
Rorquals would not have been so bad if they weren't able to be injected into. Before injectors there was perhaps a couple of hundred Rorqual capable characters that might have been used when the meta swang that way. It would have taken considerable ramp up time for people to train new characters into them which would allow CCP time to rebalance them as they saw necessary.
---
How is this statement any different than the same being said 2, 3, or 5 years ago?
---
Drakes with ospreys are a really good fun / cheap doctrine that can be competitive with other wormhole doctrines. Mix in some command destroyers for disrupting enemy logi / isolating slow / blingy ships and they have good kill potential. You can also upgrade this once you get comfortable with it and your pilots get better skilled by including navy drakes and swapping the ospreys for basilisks. (when you say defending your hole and invading others I'm assuming you mean just for fun and you're not looking for a serious home def / eviction doctrine. Other people will be able to help you with that i'm sure.)
---
r/evejobs
---
I think you mean Guys In Real Life or G.I.R.L for short
---
Yes, it is actually. I use them only as travel mods.
---
* Grid blocking is fine, but you can't scoop them again and they blow up after a week
---
* no smart mines. Better make a bookmark or use the "follow the wrecks" method
---
* ofc they have to be cloaked
---
* AOE
---
* I don't care about them being booshed, because
---
* hell yes, they should react to subcaps, but probably depending on mass (so you have to be in touching distance with a rookie ship, but a titan will detonate mines a lot farther away)
---
* clearing them with AOE is fine
---
Mines are an effective war tool because they are only a big explosive charge with a proximity detector. So they should be cheap, to cover a big area with them (like the outside parameter of a Keepstar)

---
\^\_\^
---
Was thinking the same after reading that thread. More risk to dropping capitals would be a good thing, there is also potential for attackers to counter mine making for more interesting tactical options. 
---
- anchorable in space like bubbles, takes time that requires some sort of defence to online
---
- functions like a massive fixed smartbomb, friend and foe damage
---
- not booshable (although this would be great fun)
---
- expire after a week or so to avoid spam (similar to bubbles)
---
- not anchorable on close to gates
---
- only anchorable in null
---
I can’t decide on whether they should be visible or cloaked. Cloaking increases risk massively to both attacker and defender, but without cloak they may be too easy to avoid.
---

I'm OK with the haters. I've received some serious death treaths over the years for third party apps we made for games, something you have to deal with in our modern society. Eve online is the only community that hasn't seriously done this, so that is at least something to be proud of, as crude as that may be. People who see these Intel tools making their gameplay hard and acting out is understandable, just as much as cloaky camping with dozens of alts is frustrating, or not being able to move more than a spreadsheet value of a ship hp in high sec can be frustrating. Telling me to go fuck myself is hilarious, because who doesn't like doing that... 
---
I know that the major blocs have their own tools, that are far better probably. We might give up support officially once I get back to resubbing. If i test them and the alternatives are decent, we probably will take down the site where its downloaded from. The problem is that the app will work regardless if we support it or not. as all versions of it work 100% client side with only the zkill plugin and character info from ccp being loaded. Nothing we can do about that. We basically stopped development since 2 years ago and the use has barely declined. We expected people to switch and unplug officially once the user count dropped below 1k estimate, but that just didn't happen, which is why we are re Evaluating the status of it.
---
Only at insane speeds (in comparison to tracking speed).
---
Think of flying a perfect Circle around a static object. The turrets don't have to track at all, they can remain static.
---
If the circle is imperfect or the target moves, it's a math thing. The overview has a column for that. (was it angular velocity? erm...)
---
But in general an AB ship shouldn't track to bad while shooting a target that matches it weapons size.
---
Your fit is 90% responsible of your death.

&gt;For all I know, the paid content might not even really 'kick in' until many hours into the game.
---
This is pretty much correct - the differences are subtle in the beginning, such as slower training time for skills. The first real 'paywall' you might hit is if you go into exploration and decide you'd like to use a cloak, but even that won't be obvious until week 2 or 3, so I'd say go ahead and try it out as a free character. I think there's more than enough content to be had for you to decide whether you want to subscribe or not in your own time.
---
Sweet stache!

Guy wants to fly crazy ships, not catalysts
---
This would be a bad idea. People like me would mine the fuck out of every belt and gate in the game. My kill board would look great but it would ruin eve.
---
Like the other guy said, EVEMon for optimizing a skillplan. But if it's just about skill farming, you don't need a calculator - just select any skill with a long enough training time, look at which attributes it takes. Remap to max out the primary, put everything else in the secondary, and get +5 implants for both.

Ok so a fight club then. Nothing at all to see here, just nerds desperate for content so they agree to create some to keep the plebian F1 pushers happy.

Good points! But why not anchorable in low sec too? I mean certain lowsec/null groups are dropping toys without any fear of a real threath to them.
---
I'm not sure the idea is viable at this stage so i wouldn't comment on something like that. Other temporary structures like jump field generators and mobile scan inhibitors are prohibitively expensive and hideously bulky and short lived for what they give you. I have a feeling that anything like this would be equally impractical to use.

Mhm? Care to elaborate?
---
"Most capital pilots." Reading is fundamental. 
---
As with many games you can advance the skills of character to advance quicker into end game content. The amazing part is the newbie in the frig has that exact same option, or use counter play and relationships to make inpact in this game. 
---
Skill injectors may have allowed those that have deep wallets to advance to ships they have no idea how to use quick.. but you cant discount the majority of cap and super cap pilots that have home grown there skills. 
---
Top end content is just that. Top end. It requires time and or money to get there. And with eve it also requires knowledge on how to use it. 
---
If you want the same exact skills and chance as a  veteran player. Go play fornite.

Im saying I dislike hypocrisy. You are saying NS isnt a place for the weak, yet you are in this moment arguing for making it easier for the "weak". That should go both ways. Otherwise skip that argument and straight up say you want help to get more content. 
---
No, not at all. But you think the outlaws were an actual threat to cities? They still got demolished right?
---
Its really not that hard for the small roaming gang no. I really dont think so. Its certainly not on par with keeping sov.
---
But what Im really saying is that balancing things so that small groups can get content in NS wont lead to a better game. It will just drive more people away from null and perhaps even the game. Its actually time to talk about the elephant in the room which is the fact that the gap between big groups and small groups are way too big to ever be bridged. And trying to do it is imo just straight up counterproductive. Instead efforts should be made to allow for content  between smaller groups instead of nerfing NS time after time after time to reach the conclusion that shit, this wont work. And in the process driven out tons of players from the game.
---
The old eve is dead, lets focus on actually making the new one work.
---
Removing them from gate grids seems like a good idea. Regarding belts, you could clear the mines with AOE (bombs, lance, etc)
---
This. I used their 35m Caracal fit in a T2 last night and it was fine. Died in a T3, though.
---
Once the VNI changes are live, you should tinker with a fit. Drones and guns with the proper tank profile can be quite good for T3s.

Frontline might work if reward will depend on how close you are to frontline systems. And it can affect plex respawn time and how many plexrs are in system. Like you can have large plexes only in frontline systems, and far away systems might have 2-3 novice plexes only. Capturing them slightly affect entire frontline. And you can deplex only in frontline systems. That might affect bots and farmers I think.

Down vote all you like, this is \*literally\* what the man said. He then said, "let's return the skill points for FAXes when we delete them \[before we turn carriers right back into them\]." Yet r/eve is ready to fellate the man for "clearly playing the game." 
---
Weird that is the attitude given that the only skills required to fly a FAX is racial carrier--in other words, CCP Falcon's musings, as much as I love the man, sure do not sound like the musings of someone who actually plays the game.
---
Interesting ideas you have here

Maybe they just don't want you to collect them off your 50 SP farms and trade them all to your main.

So I have 31 hours left on my current one, that will expire on Thursday morning. A 6 day will take me to Wednesday morning, that's the 31st and I can gobble another 6 day.

You die when your pod gets blown up. Then your clone reactivates in your medical station.

When exploring, there are sites known as "ghost sites", that are a subclass of data site. I forget the exact naming convention, but look up ghost sites and you'll get what you need. Hack 1 or 2 cans, then get the fuck out because the site will explode. You can cargo scan freely first, the timer starts when you hack the first can.
---
They shouldn’t keep subs alive in the scenario you have in mind, which I’m guessing is any fight larger than 20v20, which was exactly my point. You’re also forgetting that a single cycle will bump the sub to full armor, which means stacking all your reps on a single sub may work (cycle every 10 seconds) but any target swapping and you’re going to lose. This forces you to augment you fax with subcap logi while the fax SUPPORTS subcap reps instead of replacing them.
---
30s is a bit extreme, but they currently cycle way too fast in triage.
---
Well, that's hardly the CSMs fault. The CSM 'advises' CCP, they *do not* make actual game design choices; and, the war dec system was broken and drove newbros from the game, and the CSM actually had to push on CCP to make any changes at all. 
---
In other words, the war dec system may still be fucked, but it was more fucked before when it was causing 90% of people in new high sec corps to quit the game forever. The CSM, peopled with big bloc representatives, pushed CCP to try and fix it. 
---
Which counters your lazy argument, "since when do blocs care about the small guy..." because I have literally given you an example of where they went out of their way to try to make the game better for the small guy.
---
Have you ever been to lowsec? Do you know how many lowsec systems are grouped in a single or two-system pockets at the dead-end of some high-sec region? Is the intent to make such systems unassailable or dead?
---
tbh, you can't fit enough tank on iteron5 to tank 2 tornadoes
---
Rich ass fighter, crazy ships? Dreddit is recruiting. Sounds like you want to join a big nullsec bloc. You can even learn to play the game, because our corp encourages solo and small gang pvp over just becoming a spodbrain.
---
[https://dredditisrecruiting.com/](https://dredditisrecruiting.com/)
---
I said defang any capital, I didn't say carriers. And I'm sorry to get into semantics but I am including super capitals and Titans into this mix. Capital just being abroad word for the ships requiring Capital skills.
---
I'm not going to make a guide.  I figured it out so I'm sure you can as well.  It's pretty easy since the last launcher overhaul.  Tip,  try right clicking on a character.
---
I suggest you pay a visit to the backstage forum...dont have the link right now as i'm on mobile but will add it later
---
The ability to bridge fleets and fight from across the grid and do all the things Capital ships can do still has value beyond their immense stats.
---
Don't forget a dictor, and don't forget the almighty neutageddon, the poor man's bhaal.
---
People can rat afk or active to their hearts content, but obvs botting is another thing altogether.
---
Bots are less of a problem currently (until the time they learn to work around the blackout), the potential issue is if less people can get into ratting ships due to cost or train times = less people in space. In if said ships are much tougher to kill, then hunters in solo or small gang are less likely to roam = less people in space.
---
Might not happen. Might end up being a plethora of goodies to hunt. Just wondering if the food chain will dry up without snacks of all shapes and sizes 😀
---
&gt; layers. Without the big blocs the game would be in so much worse shape than it currently is. Sure they had there reasons for recruiting, it wasnt all selfish, but the point stands. Yet people are constantly bitching about big blocs. Even though they havent done anything but tried to gank the little guys.
---
I am in a big bloc and I have nothing against them; but, to be honest, while I am now eve rich, null sec life is pretty boring. Low sec piracy and small gang pvp is where the game really shined for me. It's a shame that, at 41, with a family, I no longer have the time I did when I started playing eve at 28. This really sort of confines me to null sec existence.
---
So the catalyst was actually manufactured by ford?
---
No,my item is literally not there.I boarded a random ship and now it's completely gone.Also now my ship's name is *other players name* ship.What is going on?
---
Thank you for having the balls to share, made me chuckle and happy you can laugh about it. Don't listen to all the assholes in here, they are in Goons so they won't drop shit unless they are 99% sure not to die with a mega blob.
---
We need more yolo'ing and less risk adverse people in eve. You probably made those dudes week. Just space pixels. What you did wasn't smart but it was at least fun.
---
First off - what's your hole effect? It's important to tailor your doctrine to that. Heavy armor is usually the way to go, but sometimes you're in a wormhole that forces shield.
---
For a small 6-10 man gang I definitely agree with the idea of running RR doctrines, but you can also run partial RR doctrines, using remote ancil or remote deadspace reps in your highs while running a ball of something with a couple utility highs. I've done this in shield holes with cyclones. Prophs work pretty good.
---
This is fantastic.
---
Again, the CSM did not decide on the game mechanics. That was all CCP. The CSM does not design the game, but advises CCP; this includes saying, "hey guys, the war dec system is broken. Look at your data."
---
Not for me.
---
Go. Invest like 50e and your good to go. I was able to build 2 account and in 1 month im already clearing sites with my gila and one another im mining with an orca.
---
I got some good deals on steam and eve page. Check those out. On steam there was 50 off in some packs and i was able to omega both for 15e since it was also on discount.
---
So if you can..invest some cash then you wont need anymore since you will have some isk that will put the fear of losing the ships away.

People have been putting cans out to decloak people on bubbles for forever. popping something out into space to help decloak is not a new idea. Is this the first time I've heard of someone using a fucking citadel to do it? Yes, and it's hilarious. But honestly it's just a next step from what people have done for ages. If CCP have not acknowledged it as a bug, it's fair game and clever use of game mechanics.

Dagan is the "do you know how damage works?" boss. You're flying Caldari, with hybrid turret skills? You can PROBABLY do it with a cormorant fit with blasters shooting antimatter, though void is better. Orbit with an afterburner to reduce incoming damage - microwarpdrives bloom your ship's signature, making it easier to hit (and therefore take more damage from medium guns).
---
Otherwise, ship up to a moa or get a buddy. I've seen him go down to a Catalyst just fine, so a blaster Corm should be able to do it tho.
---
You also learn about the power and the glory that is blasters. Will you ever desire another weapon system?

I assume that was a direct counter to the "they only got away because of near2 and everyone uses near2" comments everywhere.

Along with the threads about nerfing warp stabs and giving ratters a weapons timer because even with the blackout, it's too hard to catch em for some folks.
---
lol HTFU. CCP constantly killed my playstyle leaving me behind with a mountain of unusable SP. jeeez the entitlement in these new players is staggering
---
yes
---
In addition to the other comments here, Kil2 invented the eponymous "Kil2 tank" which involves both a plate and a rep on armor ships.  Before that, everyone generally either buffered or active tanked.  He did the math on the reps and said that if you live for x amount of time, those reps add up to a lot more buffer.  This went a long way toward making armor ships relevant in small gangs again.
---
This was before the days of ancillary reps, but is now the theory behind most smallgang armor fits.  Comet with bulkhead rigs and a rep is a good example of a modern Kil2 tank.  You can't overstate how much his invention has changed the small gang and solo meta.
---
To be honest, I do not know if there is anything that can be done in the current instantiation of EVE. It really is not difficult to design a game from the ground up to balance something like ship roles. For instance, one need only need look to the real world for an analogous reference frame. Something like a USN super carrier is a very powerful ship; however, you would never see one sailing alone. They require escorts, which provide advanced electronic warfare, anti-submarine warfare, air/missile defense, and anti-ship protection. 
---
So you could design a spaceship game around these premises, one in which a space capital ship is a very dangerous vessel, but one that *requires* support to do things like detecting enemies, providing point defense, etc. It is much more difficult to go back in to a 16 year old game to 'adjust' it to follow along these lines for multiple reasons. 
---
I really do not know what can be done to re-balance these ships in the current game, particularly given that people have literal years of skill points invested in capital ships, and as such have some pretty clear expectations about what they think their ships ought to be able to do.
---
Back in 2012, Goonswarm enacted its first (?) "Cultural Revolution".  Basically a banning of shitty posting styles, "ironic" racism/sexism, etc.
---
At the time, Test (and friends, who Richter was one of) had shared access to our forums, so those rules applied to him there, and on our shared fleets.  He basically just got super mad that he was no longer allowed to drop hard-rs or whatever other edgelord stuff he was into.
---
...just didn't have it with them this time - however it will be addressed before the next timer.
---
TDs were better before the gun/missile nerf.  Now its a stupid game of pre-fit luck or run away.  At the fleet level, you will probably have enough pre-intel that it doesn't matter, and if the chance doesn't matter or makes it worse over all, then its bad imo.

Can you still use the blueprints? I know they cannot be deployed, but I am curious if they can still be built. Also, I agree with some other people... the world, and computer hardware, has changed significantly since 2004 (when mines were removed). It might be worthwhile to re-visit the concept.

My point remains, black out doesn't hurt the null sec powers, nor change the status quo.

There is a roadmap?

This is the chicken and egg problem.

If a capital ship is so special that they should have support fleets to do basic stuff, then they should also get special benefits no?

I can't speak for others, but my group is at war currently, with daily fights on two fronts over structures and sov timers.

---
America ....upvote for a fun fight and my first dread loss.
---
your ships are beautiful ccp , thank you
---
Goons get a lot of trash, but they have some extremely good FCs. I had a blast with Asher's Ishtar fleets. Encouraging sub cap preference without limiting capitals would be ideal. Capitals should be intimidating. I would rather see subs get a damage bonus than messing with capitals as the are.
---
Falcon's idea of making dreads the supcap killers would make capitals irrelevant. People would only have to kite them to death at 140k. An entire line of training and ships would be obsolete and would further stagnate the game due to no one ever being able to destroy keepstars let alone give them something to strive for.
---
As stated before. It's not an easy issue to tackle. I would not want to see the playerbase disintegrate due to changes encouraged by people who haven't observed the success of goons and learned from it. Not long ago goons were in the same situation as those complaining. They prevailed not by encouraging a nerf, but by fortifying and using game mechanics.
---
I still have my bpos, and a stack of mines... As I recall, laying a field of mines was a trick but not as hard as it sounds. Have to ask CCP, but I also recall a delay before they went active after you deployed.
---
Honestly you really only needed to mine an area in the high traffic points at warp in on gates or stations and let players do the rest. (Kinda like drag bubble placement today)
---
Was a blast mining the gates through Aridia... And suddenly going blinky cause someone died 4 systems over. The tears were hilarious!

Here's honesty, you attack in our space, we are going to counter and counter hard.

Every other group is going to do exactly the same thing.

Is your point that fun PvP is a Kikimora fleet killing Covetors?  
---
Or is your point that groups should not fight back and let ships die?
---
Or is it that the attacked need to bring only a exact and proportionate response that fits to your desire for the encounter, ideally a response that you can defeat easily?
---
Goons were losing the subcap brawl, decided to prolong it with the dreads party - and that one was "ruinined" pretty much right away. However the brawl before the escalation was... rather onesided too. They aren't complaining about that though. Not even about the titans as such - only about how short was what followed.

My experience in null sec is this--after spending my first 11 years as a low sec pirate. Null sec alliances as institutions, the most complex human institutions inside of a video game ever, do often act in self-interested ways; however, they also realize that if this game that they love is to continue, it needs to be fun for everyone.
---
This would need to extend to the grid outside of the plex as well at a minimum - as many fights start outside not inside.  
---
But honestly just delete the whole mechanic, lowsec pirates barely even care and it's them that the mechanic is intended for.  
---
If gateguns have true \*fuck-your-titan\* DPS, then I could see keeping sec status around I guess.
---
Exactly, I think the worst I've ever did in null sec was 20 million on a data site.
---
Yea all these snowflakes assume everyone is racist, but the rabid coons aren't terribly bright
---
&gt; I don't empathize
---
And no one gives a fuck.
---
If your gonna buy isk, dont waste it on ships and modules that will turn into loot for someone else. Turn it into skill points by buying injectors and get skills that can't be taken by another player. Everything you fly and use will be better this way no matter what grade the modules are.
---
Here’s what it killed before it’s untimely demise.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/77977156/
---
&gt;But that new toon will still eventually fly caps, and assuming the rate of people wanting to fly caps exceeds the number of cap pilots leaving the game, you still have more caps than you started with.
---
A possibility, but that does not mean letting players instantly get there is good.
---
&gt;All removing skill injectors does is initially slow the ramp up. And again, nothing stopping a dude from running a cap pilot farm and selling the toons to those who don't want to wait.
---
But players didnt. Although it is unknown if CCP would have stepped in should it have been abused, it would have given them time.
---
I can tell you something of my own experience (which is not great, but I think it applies to your situation)   
---
1. home defence - make friends, significance tank, don't keep valuables, sanitize your recruitment 
---
2. brawl is shit if you are in a 6 person fleet - if you absolutely must I suggest going with something you don't mind losing, that deals high \*selectable\* dps. Drakes, prophecies, canes are good for that, insure well and will help your greenhorns get blooded 
---
3. for a 6 person fleet I would say ganking is the route you want to go: choose engagements properly, fuck them up on polarization, catch something kill it and run. Avoid bigger fleets running through your chain. Learn to roll fast and quiet
---
TLDR: high dps, low cost ships for brawling, to ease people into losing them and keeping situational awareness.
---
not really, no fit will save him on a solo move after getting decloaked and hic pointed against mildly functioning hunters. His nyx died when the big brain in cyno shenanigans and warping to a celestial not a safe (?) happened, he never even reached the point where his admitedly bad fit would have killed him.
---
Did you convert from killing people for code to joining the miners?
---
get a travelling fit next time....
---
So realistically how much can a vanquished tank? That’s impressive
---
That decision is a little easier when "already replaced" is the reality portrayed in the MER
---
You sure you weren't evicted from somewhere else?
---
I dont get it..
---
I get you man. My comment was more directed at the other guy and the fact that NS has done tons for the game which often is overlooked.
---
But Im with you, I love small gang stuff but at the same time I prefer the stability of NS, the freedom. Its boring sure but Im more than content. Which is why I strongly dislike a big change like no local. It messes with the package deal that is NS.
---
And I strongly dislike loudmouths with bad attitude which this sub seems to be filled with.
---
I dont understand what this dude is talking about...
---
Who's the racist now?
---
I'll change the document regarding noting the gate grid.  I agreed that it should work like that and just glazed over it in writing.
---
As for sec status itself, it's kind of fun.  We do have lots of trouble with mixed gangs where some of us are -10.0 and others aren't.  It's impossible in small ships to repel that kind of firepower, so we end up having to be very careful about how gate fights get started to be sure we're not taking guns.  It definitely affects frigates too much IMO.  If you're in a heavy gang, you just eat the guns for 20min and then broadcast.
---
I think the real key is variety, we shouldnt get the same animation for every ship because ships wouldnt normally all explode the same.
---
Near2 is pure cancer. Even if only 1 person uses it.
---
That said defending your program for 90% of your post just seems like you are desperately trying to justify it. You know it does nothing but harm. YOU KNOW IT. There is no way to defend that.
---
&gt;Make systems contestable ONLY if they are adjacent to something your faction already owns...
---
So basically every system will be like ama, kour, houla and some others? Probably a very bad idea.
---
It's a travel fit??
---
When you get more confident and better skilled try out some wormhole exploration.
---
Makes it easy for the blobs. No thanks.
---
In delve there is plenty. If you look at dotlan pretty much everywhere else is literally dead save for 1-2 systems per region that have a few kills. There is far less ratting going on outside of delve.

I'm sure you're right, I don't hang out in low or high any longer than i have to so I don't really have a solid argument.
---
I just know that it annoys me that I can't fight in lowsec without worrying about sec status. To me it's obnoxious enough that I just fuck off.But I do solo pvp exclusively so lowsec would otherwise be very appealing to me.
---
I just run those with a stratios now, no reason to risk an Astero when I can just facetank the site.
---
&gt;charging down targets and tackling them.
---
What are these targets? Another blob.
---
One thing the game does not need more of is people joining a corp and becoming a drone.
---
From what I gather its kill x amount of NPCs and there are 3 tiers/day. Think a total of 75k SP/day. L3s will do just fine, if you just wanna blitz it you can even drop to level 1s since its just NPCs and not bounties that count.
---
But this info is based on what Ive seen coming out of the test sever and there can be changes when it hits the live server. I also believe there is a PvP possibilty as well, can kill an alt or a friend or something for that I guess, unless you actually PvP.
---
This should be fixed. No point in having it this way.
---
Absolutely not, if for no other reason than the fact that the server shits itself in large fights already. There's no reason to make it that much worse.
---
I remember back around 2015 there was some talk around fast strike carriers that would be BS sized but have like 2 tubes of fighters and be allowed in high sec, and as similar to of ship (name escapes me) that was a BS sized ship that could use 1 capital gun that were supposed to bridge the gap between sub caps and caps.
---
Maybe it's time to readdress the idea of those ships?
---
I just want to chime in with my support, the Astero is a beautiful ship and is very fun to fly! It's not as good at the pure exploration gameplay as a Covert Ops frigate like the Helios, but you trade a small amount of scanner strength and a bit of flexibility in how you fit exploration modules and get a *dramatic* increase in survivability and the ability to actually fight. The Astero is great if you want to try hunting other explorers later on, while still being able to run the exploration sites you find yourself.
---
If you are having a good time running exploration sites, I personally recommend training the skills for a covert ops cloaking device and a covert ops frigate for exploration *before* running straight to the Astero. Astero are a bit more expensive and while they are more combat capable you likely won't have the supporting skills to take advantage of that for a little while. The cost isn't really an issue if you are able to get comfortable running Null-Sec relic sites, as it's possible to pull nearly 100m from a *single* hack in some of the sites out in Stain, but an Astero will cost you just around twice as much as a Helios and you are paying for a lot of things you won't know how to take advantage of quite yet.
---
This said, if the Astero calls to you then go for it, what's the most fun isn't always what's the most "optimal"! Just make sure to get a covert ops cloak as soon as you can if you are going to be doing exploration, it really can't be overstated how important they are for keeping yourself safe!
---
DING
---
Oh fuck.
---
It's how you chose to balance that makes it rps - instead of say an across the board DPs or ehp nerf you are giving it specific tradeoffs.
---
With what kind of Stratios do you do it?
---

quick question regarding nbluprints and manufacturing: say I have a bunch of BP tied to research in a citadel. The researches got halted because someone put said citadel in structure timer. If the bad guys destroy the citadel, what happens to the BP if I don't cancel research ? Do they go in asset safety or are they lost ?
---
CCP just has to disable client side chat logging...
---
No goons
---
Exactly. Incursions are good PVE content, this would just put them in null which is where we need more people in space.
---
No.
---
Fielding 10x the dps of a BS per char isn't enough of a special thing? Or having a full jump drive?
---
Goons fighting snuff in a war or more a content type thing?
---
Censurar al compañero Agostin por decir las verdades!! Están molestos, la verdad de su juego se destapara.

No it's a shit fit. For travel you want at least a 500mn mwd to get into warp faster and an anti subcap combat fit. Odds of killing your tackle are low of course as they'll likely have triage and multiple backup hictors but a full recharge fit is even more useless :p
---
galaxy brained
---
Or it values SP?
---
As a serios question how important is it to get to 5? I have it trained to 3 so far.
---
You have brainwashing issues. Have you ever been cucked?
---
So you say the CSM has no real power but the CSM does have power and that you think null sec blocs nifty.
---
Sounds like you have already drank the Kool aid.
---
add the fact klavas owes me 1m to the EULA
---
Yeah several errors/bad decisions in a row that what makes a dead super or not ^^
---
Buying the super outside of your usual tz with a brand new toon can also help to confuse a little bit the hunter.
---
You cab also combine multiple bait cyno with downtime 10s after jumping i guess
---
Its shit. If you think that this is a travel fit, please explain to me why you think the super should be fit like this. 
---
I am really interested in the reasoning tbh and we can use that as a starting point and work our way up from there.
---
And no one should make that choice because it limits player choice.
---
The correct way to balance is to establish what is overpowered and fix it.
---
Recharge to jump
---
Nerf Captator!
---
I'd buy the shit out of that.

The image would make a great science fiction book cover.

I just want to find 1v1s. Replace FW with arenas or something, I don't care. Just let me blow up ships with minimal risk of getting gangraped.
---
So what you want is for brand new players with barely enough isk to fly frigates to go out and die by themselves and quit the game because they keep getting sent back to square one? 
---
How about you go fuck yourself. We want the new players to stick around regardless of what they end up doing. I think you have forgotten how hard it is for a new player because you now have years of experience to back you up going solo.
---
New players need guidance and they need help. They need people to help them avoid being prey for solo "elite pvpers" who live to ruin the game for them. From fucksticks like yourself who think that becasue it's easy for you now that it should be easy for someone with no game knowledge.
---
I would in fact put isk down that you yourself cut your teeth on such your much maligned "blobbing" before setting out by yourself you fucking hypocrite.
---
Yes he was stupid. But as I am reading this, he did not bounce but decided to stay instead and it took the hunters some time to get the hic on grid
---
This is the "disable crime watch in plexes" segment of the [larger effort](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ygBGZnWFKYFi5xkwu-SJyZkonBBzk1k4yPEGmF6u7cM/edit#)
---
If we gave people suspect timers, interceptor pilots would ping to plexes to pick up a timer and then go gate camp instead of tagging their target first to get limited engagements and pinging to evade gate guns like real interceptor pilots.  Consensus is just that disabling crime watch on the plex landing grid and inside the plex has the least knock-on effects.
---
You get the blueprint, but any idk or materials that were tied up with the BPO are lost along with your progress.
---
Titan Pilot deserved to die. He had no cyno fited. The first reaction if you get dropped and a inhib is anchoring, is to light your own FITTED cyno, before the inhib goes online. He could have had around 10 minutes time to react ( jump FAX´s and a counter dread bomb )
---
Pretty sure. May I know what makes you think I was?
---
You sort out all of that shit and I'll come back.
---
Thanks mate... hope the next km will be from the actual fight :)
---
No, what has killed sig tanking is the optimal range creep of the combat ranges.  
---
https://i.imgur.com/v06sDBv.png
---
With combat regularly taking place at 100km+ it is almost impossible to speed:sig ratio tank anything other than missiles and fighters.
---
Why do you think this is beneficial at all?
---
 Due to jump fatigue he wont be able to jump even with full cap.
---
So what you want to do is to be able to leave the grid as fast as you can and warp to teather/POS/safe instead of staying at your cyno in spot waiting for the hunters to arrive.
---
Wow that's nerdy. :)

You can't say CHISP doesn't go balls deep.

Yes.  Think of WAS as base 40,000m tracking.
---
Not my fault you arent willing to find ways around bad status like every has for all of forever
---
What I was thinking. You really can't fit enough tank to haul around 1b plus in an Iteron.
---
Any tool that curbs content and helps avoid fights is killing EVE. Thats a fact. No targets = no fun = unsub = dead game.
---
No one in nullsec is an independent little guy. Either you’re bluetral with goons or bluetral with Panfam
---
... it gets better? What would you consider a good haul to be?
---
Probably because you're eating shit lmbo
---
That depends on your design philosophy, most use a system of tradeoffs which are essentially rps but not all. In this case, what you are suggesting is essentially rps balancing by selecting specific tradeoffs for different ship classes. 
---
But anyway, I don't think I will gain anything from arguing this further.
---
Man that’s rough.... I guess I’m glad to hear that it’s been a shared experience haha
---
no? it doesnt get close even with adc... The only situation it *could* happen would be if you gimped the fit to stack a single resist like in a wolf(97%ish em), but at that point you just switch damage type and he's done for.
---
Hey I appreciate it! Will be sure to have this up for reference
---
...wow. Just...talk to an fc in your alliance or something. Learn. No, you can't speed tank at 100km+. You also are not forced to engage at 100km+. Yes, in very large fleets you can end up with these medium gun standoffs - this does not make medium guns great, it's largely due to the hulls and the preferred engagement type.
---
I can't wait to get slowcats back mmmmmmmmmmmmmm
---
Tank anyone?
---
No, the feature being 'worse back then' supposedly 'made the game better' by PCU metrics, average player opinion, and also my opinion.
---
Consistency is the strong suit here obviously.
---
Roll it back to Dominion sov, but stick a damage cap on sov structures such that you couldn't blap an SBU in literally 1 minute with supers. Make them at least keep the supers on grid for like, 10 minutes or something? Enough time to rageform and bridge in dictors to force an engagement.
---
Yeah but it's just wrriten in such a way that you are proud of dropping supers a faction titan and a lot of faxes to kill goon dreads while if goons would do the same ppl would complain about how supers are broken and too cheap yaada yaada...
---
&gt; Not my fault
---
No one gives a fuck about what you think.
---
Neutrals need to be able to enter to give pirating a chance to thrive. Giving neutrals a suspect flag when entering a plex alleviates the issue but zzz how long do we have to wait.
---
*it's means it is you heathen*
---
Respect
---
LOL people are still ratting outside of delve? What a moron. He deserved this in every way imaginable.
---
**It's fundamentally a step on the wrong direction to reduce the variety of occupied niches.**  Niches get fishes.  While I agree that we need focused content and more farming resistance, we need a broad spectrum of farming-resistant focused content, not necessarily restricted to sharing plexes with 20 person Atron gangs.
---
We need discoverable goals so that big fleets can find big fights.  We need combat ships in plexes, not ventures and other low-effort farm mobiles.  We need everything in between.
---
Scaling warzone influence appropriately to the intensity of the fighting is another independent matter that shouldn't limit niche variety.
---
Independent you say....
---
&gt;So what you want is for brand new players with barely enough isk to fly frigates to go out and die by themselves and quit the game because they keep getting sent back to square one? 
---
I want them to have the option of fighting other players that are also new. If you push them to join corps, you lose that, and you basically get the blob that we dont really want.
---
&gt;How about you go fuck yourself. We want the new players to stick around regardless of what they end up doing. I think you have forgotten how hard it is for a new player because you now have years of experience to back you up going solo.
---
No, you think you are doing them and the game a favor by regurgitating the old "join a corp" bullshit. The reality is different. A lot of players quit because all the content is tied up in blobs and null.
---
&gt;New players need guidance and they need help. They need people to help them avoid being prey for solo "elite pvpers" who live to ruin the game for them. From fucksticks like yourself who think that becasue it's easy for you now that it should be easy for someone with no game knowledge.
---
If they were "allowed" roam freely and find other players doing the same, they could grow into what they wanted. Now they get mostly killed by a blob cynoing in a carrier or 10 or get caught in some camp while having no chance to fight.
---
&gt;I would in fact put isk down that you yourself cut your teeth on your much maligned "blobbing" before setting out by yourself you fucking hypocrite.
---
While this provides more info than you need, you are totally wrong. Blobbing never appealed to me because there is little risk or skill involved.
---
assuming +3 implants it'll take just under 17 days.
---
There needs to be some replacement for a pos shield on the upwell structures, and tethering at least lets you die if you go afk and get bumped
---
at least 100m
---
You sure are salty about something. Did someone gank your venture?
---
A relic site in a good region could net you 100m. Maybe try Provi as the locals should leave you alone as long as you're not red to them.
---
I half wonder if the vanq flying into you was an accident or tactical brilliance of tossing a squirrel in to distract you.
---
It depends on the "balancer" understanding what is considered overpowered given the effort vs reward and a general sense of what is reasonable. This could be expanded, but it is the correct way in almost all cases.
---
&gt;what you are suggesting is essentially rps balancing by selecting specific tradeoffs for different ship classes. 
---
No. I would never give a ship a serious weakness that has a hard counter since that would make it useless in some situations.
---
&gt; I want them to have the option of fighting other players that are also new.
---
 You can't do this without instancing. I know how much you probably love that.
---
&gt;If you push them to join corps, you lose that, and you basically get the blob that we dont really want.
---
If you don't they get eaten alive by people who have been playing for years and quit. I would rather have the blob than even more new players that quit than we have now.
---
&gt;No, you think you are doing them and the game a favor by regurgitating the old "join a corp" bullshit.

I still call you a liar.

yup, clouds, jump gates, etc all seem to lower my FPS. Is there a setting that will reduce or disable effects from clouds and similar stuff?
---
The big bonus that comes with freighting for a NS alliance is doing market pvp in their staging / home system. You fill extra space on the way out with things to sell at 20-40% markup.
---
Generally speaking it's also really safe as they will have good citadel chains as well.
---
I had a 400 dps perma-tank BS that died to an anti-frigate loki. :(
---
does anyone have pricing going back to the beginning?
---
&gt;Then they don’t need to be nearly as expensive no?
---
After major nerfs or remakes, it wouldn't be out of the question. I find that cost is best used as balance within a narrow role or class as opposed to a blanket excuse for making something too powerful. However, discussing cost before making something that fits in the progression is putting the cart before the horse.
---
&gt;I thought the whole reason they got implemented like this was so that there weren’t many of them.
---
Well, we can see that didn't work out nearly as well as was intended. Even before things like Roquals existed, proliferation was a matter of time. The value of a top-tier supercap fleet is magnitudes more than its actual cost. You could double or triple their pricetag and it would just slow the trend, not address it.
---
I wanna know why my laugh sounds so bloody dark and sinister in the end :(  
---
I think I need a new headset or something
---
I'm all for nerfing hitpoints and logi output, especially on faxes - also increase the diminishing returns on multiple logi and/or make them sig dependant.   
---
All the goddamn measures taken by ccp so far have been made to push the whole sorry lot into losing more ships. Motherships used to be a fucking alliance effort, carriers were strategic assets only to be deployed with maximum care.   
---
Now those things have become trivial, supercaps can be self-funded by some vigorous ratting and people \*still\* fucking complain that they may happen to die. Yes, ships should die during an engagement, that's the whole point - that's what keeps the economy going and the space alive.   
---
I think that, unfortunately, this is a mindset issue, not a design issue.
---
It makes a great bait ship and Hull tanked it is quite strong. The bonuses to drones and putting some neuts in it and you will kill the lone tackler
---
Claim ***AND*** Eat the accelerators. The expiration is the last time you can consume them.
---
Just fit a little armor buffer and you can easily break 60k ehp on a stratios. The explosions do 12k in wormholes, less in nullsec. 
---
So, it really doesn’t matter. Obviously data hacking rigs are nice, but beyond that just have a reasonable fit and you will do fine.
---

So everyone should join goons because its "optimal"? What a dumb fucking idea. Its a game. You are supposed to do what you enjoy, not provide safety to retards and their whales.

I get a huge sense of fear in FW low sec without worrying over things like bubbles.  It teaches me how to stay alert and get out.  Use D-Scan and all that.  It teaches me that people will always stack the deck against you with their assault frigates, destroyers,and faction frigates.  (Why engage my T1 frig fairly when you can annihilate in a superior ship.  Do people feel good when they take me out in my T1 with their superior ships?)

It's still fun, and I am fine with people running around with blingy hunter-killer ships.  They should do that if they want

  It makes the challenge of escape a thrill.  But damn.  Could I just get a fair 1v1 fight?  If I log in every day and just spend my time orbiting a Plex and avoiding superior ships in a novice site, is this the game?
---
But does FW actually help me learn to fight?  Encourage me to continually re-ship with my frigates so I can keep trying to learn?  Encourage me to take chances and rat outside of a novice plex?  
---
No.  My only safe place is in a novice plex.  Warp in, orbit, wait for fight (which does not come), and gtfo.  Oh, and pray there is no gate camp.
---
(I can't speak to FW's ability to make me isk except to say the NPC pirates there are not worth the time, and I've never exchanged LP for anything.)
---
No you wouldn’t.
---
It's pretty average really. Wouldn't call it rich
---
Well I can make several non-contrived, omni-tanking, 250+ ehp/s with the ADC off.
---
When I make a similar on a battleship, most are also around 200-300.
---
Sure
---
The idea that PVP in lowsec costs sec status needs to go alltogether. It's a content tax that deterrs people to dip their toes into lowsec and try some PVP - it kept me in highsec until I embraced the -10. I can see the lore reasons, but from a game design standpoint it's completley counterproductive IMO. To disable it at least in and at FW complexes should be no-brainer.
---
Yep, what’s the point of carriers or supers if just having loads of battleships solves everything. You wouldn’t see titans again and many Titan pilots would just unsub
---
Good to know, but ghost sites are pretty intense things.
---
Nor would I. But not everyone who isn't rich is poor.
---
Gate activation could trigger something like a 'Suspect timer' on entry? But that spesh, flashy red status that opposing FW duders get, ramble ramble. I really don't know
---
Kiss me, Spiderman
---
Wtb old dread guns. Also, blap dreads fucked a lot with the logi blob and made you feel powerful.
---
Do you \~know\~ who the pilot is?
---
I will hire you, to say amusing things to me.
---
Like, Wow, Battleships are **HUGE**. your isk payment will be logarithmically proportional to the size of my nostalgia boner.
---
Noobs are awesome. Right?
---
I saw this stated multiple time but i need to know why ? We were living in a C3 before moving in a C4 and everyone in the corp seems to really enjoy our new home, we have access to a C3-4 static so it's means endless farm for our members and living in a C4 bring us lot more PvP to deal with. We think that we are too small and unexperienced to even think about moving in a higher-class WH.
---
there is something i miss or it's just a meme that C4 people sucks ? :p
---
Yeah, but the fight was still over when the supers were brought out. At least it wasn't us this time.
---
Awww aren't you clever, turning things around on me in your own whiney bitch thread. Adorable.
---
Faction War 2.0  
---
This version of faction warfare would create an incubator and proving ground for new players and veteran players alike.  Faction War 2.0 would be limited  T1 hull, module, and rig ship compositions.  In other words, T2, T3, ships or modules would be restricted from Faction War 2.0.  In order for an incubator to work, ship and module restrictions are needed.  I personally feel an incubator environment is needed for new pilots whom can learn from veteran players participating in a proving ground.  
---
Seasonal Based Play
---
Faction War 2.0 would be season based play.  Each season lasts for a particular period of time 30, 60, or 90 days (maybe 45 as the middle ground).  After the season, all the fragments decay.  The new season commences as the Triglavians leave behind new fragment spawns.  
---
Reward System
---
Instead of an LP system, the reward system is a Skill-point based system awarded to ALL players participating in the season.  Rewards systems could follow a matrix of time in service, participation and PvP achievements.  The pool of Skill-points received by a player would not exceed the total amount of skill-points a typical (implant-less) player earns in a 45 day period.   So basically, it's a two for one special for both Alpha and Omega players.  
---
Restrictions
---
Faction War 2.0 has a Skill-point Cap.  Players must be under 100k SP to participate.  Once 100k SP is reached, the player "graduates" to some other in-game activity.
---
Objective
---
Faction War 2.0's primary objective would be to recover Triglavian Knowledge Cubes (TKC) left behind by Triglavian invasions.  However, the TKC is "locked".  To unlock the TKC, it was discovered that the Triglavians also left behind Triglavian Knowledge Fragments (TKF).   Through trial and error, the various factions figured out how to "unlock" a TKC using the TKF's.  Now a mad rush has ensued to collect TKF's so that this new found Triglavian knowledge can be consumed by individual pilots.  TKF's can found in mass controlled stasis zones within the TKC's system.  In other words, each zone can only be accessed by ships within a certain mass,  an consist of 5 PvP zones (1 for each ship type - frigate, destroyer, cruiser, battle cruisers, and battleship)  To unlock the Triglavian relic a faction must posses at least 3 key fragments.   These TKCs and their correlating TKF's are spread through out a region, and no zone is static.  When a Knowledge Fragment Zone (KFZ) is present in a system the jump gates are jammed to restrict T1 hulls.  This in turn causes all normal space traffic to be temporarily diverted.
---
To the Victors Go the Spoils
---
The "faction" who has claimed the majority of the fragments receive a 2 x Skill-point bonus, where as the "faction who has claimed the least receive the modest rewards contained within their captured fragments.  This way, everyone receives something for participation - ideal for millennial's ;)
---
Just an idea, I'm sure no where perfect, but maybe it will spur other ideas.  Thanks!
---
Jita is the most entertaining place on the internet. If 4chan and voat had a baby it would look like Jita local.
---
My point is that you can't say "black out doesn't fix PVP because home defense." When in fact, I love the fact that brave and others drop the hammer to defend. Bring everything you can, we fight small and outgunned and outnumbered in the comps we come up with.
---
I'm not bitching about home defense, I'm bitching that what we've been having a ton of fun doing is ignored just because the rorq didn't die. Hence, all the screen shots of "rorqs saved."
---
Like, yea, Rorqs saved. But what about all the fun that went into that? Does that have no value? 
---
We don't kill our targets \*most of the time\* and that isn't op failure. Especially when we are low numbers our \*goal\* is to provoke a home defense fleet. However big.
---
Join Goons, join a SIG/Sqaud, profit.
---
Salty McTengu is hilarious (and obnoxiously annoying with the Shia LaBeouf)

---
I would maybe keep that to a dedicated type of structure that can replace POS, but I don't think they'll be gone any time soon.
---
People need to have something to do.      
---
Game mechanics should encourage people logged and in space rather logged out.
---
Drop an Astrahus and a pair of Athanor in a C1 or C3 static HS  
---
it's a easily manageable by a small crew
---
Do u have a fit for the Megatron ? We use this to roll our WH and so a lot of people have those in their hangar, could be a good idea to add this ship to boost our DPS when we fly our RR Domis.
---
When do i get my first payment? We will need to discuss the boner terms. But im happy to act out my role as noob for isk..
---
While I appreciate your  answer, I have no clue what you just suggested I do.
---
What are either of those things? They sure weren't things that were in the game last time I played. What's a C1? A C3? What's a HS?
---
But it’s not the answer to everything, you can’t just throw It around willy-nilly without having a plan on getting help if/when someone escalates. A Titan will die to triglavian cruisers easily if it didn’t get help and cruisers are fast enough to get under the guns. I believe every ship should have a chance to take care of itself because this game isn’t completely about doing everything in groups.
---
Congratz, you just learned about resists and how important they are. And also how stupid strong AFs are.
---
What's your Minimum rate!
---
Biscuits. I didn't know there was a skill that extends the duration. Looks like I have to use for that SP now
---
I used to watch this video like every day when it came out
---
Having the wrong overview tab active.  
---
No idea on hostiles, but you've got a solid grasp on how many Large Sansa Wrecks there are.
---
Listen, im sorry that ccp wont hand you free easy kills, maybe bring more than a single ship and you might actually do something
---
full rack of neutron, double magstab, double plate, DC and some resist. MDW &amp; grappler + some ewar  
---
I don't have numbers in my heads it's
---
1.4kdps with pyro, and drones for 200M isk

PLEX was split from a single item to what’s essentially a different type of currency now. The previous iteration was what 500 of the current PLEX is equivalent too. It is an acronym for the former item as well, which was called a Pilot Licenses Extension if you can see about older data on that item specifically
---
UwU
---
I came out of a fresh WH the other day with an estimated 425mil. Best one I’ve ever had - usually hover around 100mil
---
Strat OPs are CTAs. We don't even really call them that in panfam. Back then in waffles they are called Pink Pins/Red Pins and Mikhail is right.
---
HE never fucking told anyone about it until it happened. He welped a cap with Reds while we were out on a fleet together.
---
He NEVER joined fleets fucking anyways and went around soloing wherever he wanted to.
---
It's Hull tanked lol
---
Thats no really how wormholers like their fights.
---
Numbers aren't that big in wh fights, and doctrines are planned with the intent of not losing any ships.
---
A meta where ships blast themselves off the field is much more reliant on having equal numbers to win a fight.
---
In w-space, even 10 people in the right doctrine and support ships can win against 50 people if they execute a good strategy.
---
Im still to make my first 10000000isk so what needs to be done?
---
I have a Corp full of vets like ourselves who feel a little lost but want to try new things and experience more of eve. If you and your buddies wanna learn about w-space a bit more you’re more than welcome to join us and get some education on the mechanics and such. And if you want to leave and go start your own thing all the power to ya and it’s even encouraged. My group wants to see people have more fun and experience wormhole content in a manner where they have friends to do it with and a good environment to get those grasps.
---
LP will run a value of about 1k ISK per LP.  Enter your faction on fuzzworks and you can sort by LP / ISK.  Use the bid prices to get a realistic idea of what's actually selling vs listed over-priced and low volume.
---
You can use Zkill and the map of kills to figure out where you might find other solo fighters.  My advice is to join one of the hunters you talked about or try to participate in warzone pushes.  You get huge amounts of combat experience in the T1 frigate doctrines while your SP is accumulating.  Also find nice people so you can roam in pairs.  Some of the best hunting is in that 3-4 pilot level where people will try to engage one of you and it's a race to get the positioning and engagement timing right.
---
Another thing to understand is who is just fighting and who is maintaining system control.  System control pilots are always going to +1 you because they're just clearing out the plex as efficiently as possible.  Fighters will downship if you run away, trying not to scare you off.  Ask in local.  You will get lied to also, but people in your area will figure out that you're looking for fair fights, not running from everything.  I'd take a Tristan vs Tormenter fight any day.
---
I think in the thread Eonan had admitted to being the director that kicked him and everyone pretty much ignored it to hate on reza. 
---
And we have a strict policy on doing other shit while on big ops. He never fleeted up and went on shit anyways because he was just one of those solo roaming guys. I can't say I recall the guy ever speaking up on comms ever.
---
I read all your comments and I really have lost all hope for humanity because people like you exist. A shame
---
Biology V
---
Wormholes go from Class 1 through Class 6 traditional with Drifter wormholes, Thera and Shattered wormhole systems all being C13+(mostly Wolf Rayet)
---
Astrahus and Athanor are citadels.
---
HS just refers to the "static" wormhole - the one that will always spawn regardless of conditions. You can check the statics of a wormhole system by googling it. 
---
If you do decide to go for it - I have a  wormhole I could sell you easily enough. C2 with C4 and HS statics, no environmental effects and decent PI.
---
So like a carrier would have 400k ehp with a T2 buffer fit?  And like 1200 dps with 2 damage mods?
---
I have not really looked at the ingame settings in awhile but I would look for anything transparency related. Aside from that I think the only other option is a graphics card :|
---
If they only moved half of one of their dozens of AUtz SIGS I'm sure they could get it down to 36 or so.
---
No local must have caused his bot to malfunction. He should just do the same as the rest of his GOTG counterparts and dock up.
---
was waiting for that one lol
---
❤️
---
Just some dude tired of spinning his 100bil e-peen.
---
&lt;3 DT, still remeber good times in CloudRing with you around 2009 (was in ev0ke). As i see the old farts like larf are still there :)
---
Lol must have been the venture.
---
Why do they remove them?
---
My first suggestion is to read a few books on leadership and self-help, as running a corp and growing it towards a goal are different things. Books I make my leadership read:
---
Drive: the surprising truth of what motivates us
---
How to Win Friends and Influence People
---
The 21 irrefutable laws of leadership
---
Now, after this pick a basic direction. "Run an azbel in the green" is a good example, make a roadmap of how to achieve that such as picking a mission hub to drop it in as a market for ammo &amp; buying salvage. Something along those lines. I wouldn't suggest going to null or lowsec unless you have the intention to recruit significantly more members or join an alliance, however.
---
We’ve always been dead ;)
---
We are recruiting, join EAKFOREVER and holler at us to find out more! #shamelessplug
---
I remember taking one on in wormhole when I was just getting into a Stratios... managed to burn its barge buddy but chewing through that EHP and managing its drone damage was just too close for comfort. Had to disengage from each other at the last slivers of each others' hull.
---
Unexpectedly spooky ships.
---
Need a high back armchair and a fluffy cat more like...

Just came back to eve. Was sad to see the old family in love squad are no longer going.
---
Spaces' youtube channel :  [https://www.youtube.com/user/Darkyre/videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/Darkyre/videos)
---
Order number 69, please go to your collection point.
---
WTB toggle for  jump range list on kapace systems.
---
Megathrons or Abaddons make good hold downs. You can augment these with Augurors and Guardians, I would recommend using the megathrons to brawl and the abaddons for mid-long range fights.
---
Brutix, hurricane and harbinger all make solid platforms for smaller stuff, and with skilled members you can squeeze some command bursts on them for greater effect.
---
Class one or Class 3 Wormhole with a static HS ( you have a hole to an Highsec system everyday, but never twice the same).  
---
C1 and C3 will be more quiet than C2  
---
In wh, if you want regular belts, you have to use athanors and moon drill.  
---
WH space is a little bit scary but realy fun and chalenging for a small corps like yours.
---
I will. You always seemed like a fun group.
---
And if you want to be almost invincible. Use lowsec. But log in and jump just before DT. If you get cought on log in. They have like 30 seconds to  kill you. And if you get cought after jump they have even less. Only a Titan fleet jumping in and DDing you will kill you.
---
Upvoted for title, things like this and "How do you sell a hangar full of corpses" is why the normies think we're weird
---
Back in like 2008 u could buy GTCs they would give u about 200-300
---
pm me your username so i can add you
---
Oo thanks that's a nice sheet!
---
You actually can, but it's not recommended. At that point just use an occator.
---
I might take you up on that offer, but don't expect me to dissolve my current corp and get rolled up in yours , we'd stay our own corp. But, definitely open cooperation.
---
thx. So no point stopping removing the bp if there is a chance the citadel survives :D
---
No justification for this fit other than trying to make a quick buck doing regional hauling. But if that's your gameplan and you can't fit a more appropriate T2 indy ship, then stick with fast ships and tiny cargo.
---
It's from 2010. It's basically ancient, especially in Internet Time.
---
Your suggestion does give the ship a serious weakness though doesn't it? 
---
Also, these trade offs are everywhere in eve - battleships not being able to hit frigates is an obvious example.
---
Anyway, this isn't really going anywhere..
---
No god no. The offer is to teach you mechanics and how to live then you get on little doggy
---
It also solves other ones.  Treating the symptom is what bad people do.  Smart people treat the root problem.
---
How do you mean that? a just with systems in range from a ly list?
---
where are the hate mails filled with piles and piles of salt ??
---
Great idea!  They did have some old data: https://eve-marketdata.com/price_check.php?type_id=29668&amp;region_id=&amp;solarsystem_id=&amp;type=history
---
I think this was a ghost site. So good luck to OP not dying next time.
---
&gt;Your suggestion does give the ship a serious weakness though doesn't it?
---
No. It is not a weakness to not be overpowered.
---
&gt;Also, these trade offs are everywhere in eve - battleships not being able to hit frigates is an obvious example.
---
Which has made them underpowered as assault frigs became overpowered and therefore popular.
---
And why not remove the invul from rorqs and give them an emergency DC?
---
&gt; Bought a Nyx pilot from Char bazaar (you usually do so to move a new super, so that probably got attention)  
---
&gt; falcon buddy... he fall asleep in the mean time: We will never know if he would have saved you  
---
Neither of these really matter.
---
I'm familiar with leadership, it's not the abstract concept of 'leadership' I'm uncertain about.
---
It's the EvE specific parts of running a corp I'm uncertain about.
---
Like I mention in the post - how would you pay members of a mining corp?  What's generally expected of a corp? Like what services can players reasonably expect the corp to provide? Those kinds of things. Like I said, back when I played I was mostly solo for a long time before joining a corp that pretty much exclusively did 0.0 PvP roams and let players just do whatever.
---
I don't think it was representative of a "real" corp.
---
Like, in another MMO (Let's use WoW as a example) it's simple - it's expected that a guild does a couple of things: They raid and schedule raids, maybe provide a website or forum to schedule those raids. It's relatively simple.
---
It's a bit more complex in EvE, I feel. There has to be incentive to join a corp; like I hardly think anyone would join a corp that was basically "Yeah, we mine sometimes. Give me your rocks and get nothing in return."
---
I'm just trying to get an idea what sort of (EvE specific) things are expected of a corp that takes in recruits from all over the place.
---
So instead you left the cyno up for two minutes for people to notice and jumped in at the last 10 seconds?
---
that was.... Amazing.... Shame the guy recording didn’t know more about law to stand his ground
---
Texas is a one party consent state... Not that it really matters that idiot could only understand the law if it came in a book with mostly pictures
---
Oh. Well then we're on the same page.
---
I might very well take you up on the offer.
---
Most of the things you mentioned are valid in any space. Everyone tries to plan doctrines with the intent of not losing ships, if possible.   
---
Props to TDSIN for standing up to the fight and not refitting to rattles or smth.
---
&gt; Well I can make several non-contrived, omni-tanking, 250+ ehp/s with the ADC off. 
---
well let's see them then
---
&gt; When I make a similar on a battleship, most are also around 200-300.
---
then you're not fitting your active battleships correctly, in a domi with 2 eanm, dcu, t1 anti exp rig every single large repper cold will be doing 260 ehp/s, and each ancil doing 440 ehp/s (with charges ofc, should be about 250 if you count reload time). And this is with 2 empty rigs that could be used for nanobots or more resists to get even more ehp/s, and other things ofc.
---
yes the t2 resists are good(afs in particular) but its not nearly as dramatic as you're making it out to be when talking bs. Battleships also have a ton of buffer, comparatively speaking frigs have none.
---
Yes, slowing down the game would be great for strategy depth. I'm all for increasing warp speeds though.
---
I agree but they also need something to do which isnt AFK and mindless. Eve is about risk and reward, but recently risk has been minimized and reward maximized in sov null, pretty much killing off every other viable playstyle, and that's why it's so stale.
---
So just eve things. Learn to play, eve should be hard etc etc rhetoric.
---
Yeah, which sadly goes back to all the super/titan threads recently, they're just too hard to deal with and whereas cost used to somewhat balance that (they were hard to replace when you lost them), that isnt even true now either.
---
was pretty good till the awful fucking dubstep kicked in lmao
---
no logi
---
I dont know any other shield incursion groups that still run tbh.
---
Lost a battleship and a dread, would do it again for that kind of fight.
---
&gt; Lol must have been the venture
---
You'd be much less of a loser if you could actually use your little head instead of regurgitating garbage you've learned on r/eve.
---
You're coming off as incredibly pathetic.
---
been watching some people in our nano gangs fly them now.  So devastating.
---
Wormholes are perfect for a tight knit group of buddies. You can run sites, do PI, mine, huff gas, get in scraps and take day trips out to literally anywhere in EVE. It's a learning curve but it'll be fun, and you'll have a place that's all your own.
---
Are you willing to share the source?
---
Thanks you !
---
Thats because they all died, armor and max dps still don't belong in the same sentence for this though. (Or can you think of literally any instance where TDF outperformed DIN, ISN or RAISA back when incursions were somewhat relevant?)
---
It's a specific approach to balancing but not the only one available. You could just as easily use a linear approach, by changing the EHP or increase the cost/time to make as basic examples. Instead you opt for a system of tradeoffs (which I agree with) - this balancing philosophy is essentially derived from rps mechanics. 
---
Anyway, I'm done here.
---
Loki is easily best for now, at least until the meta changes again.
---
I just had to explain to my co-workers why I was laughing so hard at this.  Take my updoot!
---
adAPT oR dIE
---
Your posting seems to indicate you think this is a full scale invasion. It isnt, you should stop worrying and just enjoy the content. Hopefully all the ustz based snuff affiliates dont immediately gun for the hard timezone tank to kill off all the potentially fun fights we can have.
---
If you have any questions about Wspace you can ask dudes in my pub “THOR pub” or the wormholes channel in the content menu in chat channels. That channel can be kind of dead or trolly so take it with a grain of salt in there
---
No benefit. Though points not yet redeemed from an event aren’t counted (redeemed, meaning still could go to any character), so inject before allocating.
---
Adds a whole new meaning to citadel spam
---
You'll simply have to imagine at all the fucks I give what some random person on Reddit thinks :-)
---
Rebalancing isn't necessary the same as new mechanics to put to you.
---
Rebalancing capitals doesn't really change the idea of what they are.
---
When its all done, i can export the application, but its Oracle Apex so its not something a lot of users can just "run" since you will need an Oracle (XE) Database with APEX installed.
---
But at the moment there is to much change and something in the API Package are hard coded (wich I want to change anyway). So in time I can look into sharing the application.
---
Google Makalu Zaraya soundboard
---
But Game Time Cards could never be sold ingame, you could convert them to old PLEX though.
---
&gt; You can do this without instancing. Eve used to be like that. Now it is not.
---
Older players preying on newer players isn't a new thing.
---
&gt;Players are supposed to be able to do whatever they want within the rules of the "sandbox". You want to force them into blobs. Probably because it benefits you.
---
Joining a corp doesn't mean joining a blob. Btw at this point your projected meaning of what a blob is is "more than 1 person." Join a corp does not mean "join one of the major null blocks" it means "Join a corp." Join up with some people who want to play like you do and play with them.
---
&gt;So everyone should join goons because its "optimal"? What a dumb fucking idea. Its a game. You are supposed to do what you enjoy, not provide safety to retards and their whales.
---
So now you enjoy getting blobbed? I thought you hated that. Gathering up into supergroups is the optimal way to play. And if you try and not do that don't be suprised when somone else turboshits on you by doing just that. That's why we need to push CCP to change it so that's not the optimal way to play.
---
&gt;You want to take away that choice. Your position is immoral.
---
There is no choice to make. You either play optimally or you get shit on by someone who is. 
---
&gt;Its empty because of the blob. Your "solution" is the problem.
---
The blob didn't consume people the way you consume people. People don't like being turbodunked all the time. They aren't masochists like yourself into CBT. So the best way to not get turbodunked all the time is to group up into the biggest possible groups so that they both can't be dunked on anymore and can dunk on others. You won't get around this by going "ok everyone play nice." It will require fundamental change to break up the large groups into smaller groups.
---
Ive hung out with this guy irl. Its definitely a character.
---
Pretty much yea. My group enjoys black ops so it would be nice to be able to have those little features built in to the map instead of using multiple resources
---
EmErGeNt GaMePlAy
---
Definitely. 4000 explosive alpha is a lot for a frigate.
---
Yes but having the redeem date be later then the actual use date of the accelerator is misleading to say the least. What's the point of being able to redeem it in October if you can use it anyways past August 1st?
---
Maybe you should stop capitals being built in-game for a limited time period \[More than year?\] to a\] Make them rarer as was the original premise, b\] Give time to come up with some funky new mechanics relating to capitals  and c\] Encourage sub-capital warfare.
---
I will look into the posibility. If its possible to get that information it is something I will impliment.
---
I’d pay and easy 5-10 bill for those features to be added to a wormhole mapping system. I’m sure others would as well.
---
/me double checks if July has 31 days.
---
hm yep, we're good to go.
---
How feasible is it for a group that might have like two people online at any given to actually hold and defend a WH though?
---
Wont you just get your ass kicked the first time one of the larger groups decide your wormhole looks tasty?
---
Just make it a service upgrade that we can install and pump isk/minerals into to randomly get mines seeded in a range band around the structure. These mines will not be placed until after the first timer is created.
---
I too support this plan, long live taco
---
Didn't want that campaign anyway.
---
I am aware of the requirements for it, however without reviewing the source it is not something major wormhole groups would consider adopting.  This is great for the casual explorer or non-pvp focused groups though.  Keep up the good work!
---
I heart you
---
Goonswarm did a cultural revolution PC troll with mumble and forums commissars and richter didn’t realize it was a troll and got mad.
---
How about instead of allowing a cyno on every ship create a dedicated ship whose sole purpose is to make cynos and with one high slot so you cannot just cloak them. No-more cynos on VNI's ad people can see if you plan to push in some caps.
---
No insurance on caps too.
---
Yes pushx if you don’t want any affiliation or some freighter service from gsf. Or start your own from an alliance.
---
Considering that you have entosis included on it that's not even a joke. CCP guys drew conceptual inspiration from the weirdest places.
---
Bring back Privateer Alliance style war system so I can have loads of fighting fun in high sec again without having to worry about citadels.
---
Can you clarify how wormholes work in terms of exploration? Do they just lead to further away data sites?
---
There used to be a time when seeing a titan drop in combat was a big deal. Now it's just a matter of time. 
---
"And here come the titans. Time to disengage and go home."
---
Do you advise going straight to null? Or waiting a bit.
---
A few Istabs and a 500MN MWD would mean 10 second align and warp out... RIP :(
---
at least you died cap stable..
---
I'd honestly pick a cainun content deployment over dumping on rando renters and spod brains
---
Yep, you have definitely served time in prison, or you are going to. PS. You are a terrible human being, who isn't intelligent enough to have a conversation with about anything of importance because, the moment someone provides you with any information invalidating a tiny piece of your world view, you immediately go to calling people names. I honestly surprised you haven't insinuated that I am gay, or of non-European decent yet.
---
500M???? Ouch, that bites. I’m sorry to hear it... 
---
And just curious but are there different skill builds for exploration? Or rather “specs” (sorry if there’s better terminology)
---
Thank you for all the hard work you guys have put into this.
---
Is anything needed to start my own service within an alliance ? Or I just join a corp and say "voilà, I haul for you" ?
---
What would be the best choice for a solo ship to be able to have a good fite against a small gang of destroyers (think 7-10 thrashers).
---
I want to be able to fight them but not be so unassailable for them to run away.
---
Snuffed Out is ~1200 man alliance and the allies they invited are like maybe 2k combined. Goons are a 32k man alliance. If numbers are against you you need some kind of plan to deal with that.
---
When it comes to drastic I believe CCP should avoid rebalance of capitals and instead add new game mechanics to make taking them on easier. Better tools in other words, capitals had some funky new stuff \[auxillaries, different doomsday, PANIC on rorquals \[though I believe these should be removed, homeworld style system of using fighters on carriers et al\]. 
---
The tools for sub-caps hasn't matched except for possiblly Assault Frigate and HAC assault damage controls.
---
Um. Yes. "Good."
---
&gt;They shouldn’t keep subs alive in the scenario you have in mind, which I’m guessing is any fight larger than 20v20
---
stopped reading right there - you're stupid
---
then i finished reading just to make sure, and yeah, you're completely fucking stupid
---
I was mostly talking about supers. Regular caps are way too cheap for their bulk.
---
Nah
---
&gt; Wont you just get your ass kicked the first time one of the larger groups decide your wormhole looks tasty?
---
This would happen if you had 20 people online at any given time. The best way is to not be a big target. Don't fly blingy ships out of your hole into fights all the time, don't shit talk all the time. Do fight people at least occasionally. 
---
Don't put up more than you need (if you don't need a fortizar/azbel don't put up a fortizar/azbel) and don't keep more than you need in the hole (if you are in a highsec static hole store the bulk of what you don't directly need in highsec.)
---
You may eventually end up evicted, not necessarily because you look tasty. Also either because people are dicks or because they want your hole. Just be ready to move.
---
MASH THAT DSCAN BOII
---
Dreads were dropped on the 3 apostles(at least that I saw, as Logi I focused more on keeping fleet up) vs 1 apostle. The support fleet showed up. The other subs warped out to heal faction fort damage(it hurts btw mostly of fleet was half or under). Then warped onto the other fleet(it warped). Tackled the apostles, snuff repositioned/warped back in. Dreads were shortly dropped on both sides. in Some dreads(Goons)-&gt;Dreads(Snuff)-&gt;Rest of dreads(Goons). Then titans came very shortly after 10mins?
---
Breaking blingy machs with 3 apostle support is a bit difficult, and being on top of a Faction fort at range initially(to force the fight), we going to lose the initial part until re-warps anyway.
---
To put in perspective with a fleet of 15\~ guardians, 2 augs+70ish other subs(had 1 apostle for 5ish mins to help stabilize once)?. Tanking the first reinforcement to get this fight (uncontested besides the gunned fort). The fort itself could basically almost take out a fleet size.
---
It was really annoying that we were so close range for so long in this fight on the fort, as most of the fleet would be 70%(main dps ships at least). But I think that the idea to force a fight, get a bit more subcap support(I didn't count, but seemed like at least 100 others in Hurricane fleet). Repositioned and start a dread+sub fight+some faxes. Since even before undocking we told we were going to fight/force fight either way. 
---
Even though losing the isk war(thankfully our krabs pay for our loss, so line member wise no one could care). People on goons had fun. Comms wise no one really even complained about the titans as we do the same thing in delve. If anything I'm sad I didn't lose my guardian. I never get locked.
---
If they were enjoying said content, they wouldn't be here on Reddit crying about them getting shot.
---
The guy recording was the jersey guy.
---
Honestly a good idea. They'd finally be worth their price tag.
---
There are several pros and cons. If you have alliance logistics, you have mostly the same routes with a good logistics-citadel-network. You can log your cyno chars prestaged on and off.you will fly most of the time the same routes over and over. For black frog/pushx you will have different routes and the need for moving your cyno over and over. Create and find good and safe routes.
---
"can someone teach me how r /all bait?"
---
Agreed
---
Yes it does. How extreme you go with it depends on you tho. 
---
For example I don't care for that so i've just been waiting said years to get into many things.
---
As for the how you either need to pay for the other accounts with cash, play them one at a time as alpha or make enough isk comfortably to pay for your sub that way. I really don't reccomend grinding for that isk it can kill your enjoyment pretty quick.
---
They’re a joke. Don’t try to be an antiganker. Join CODE and realize that they were right all along.
---
That's what neutral hauler alts are for.
---
What I'd advise is going daytripping into wh space. There you get really good loot from scanning while also being closer to high sec.
---
Avoid Whs close to jita as they are more likely to be camped and remember to bookmark the exit so you can always find your way back.
---
Don't be afraid to lose your ship. It happens and when you get a good site in Wh space it can easily get you 100M so you can lose a lot of ships and still break even.
---
Also try to stay in C1 C2 or C3 Whs because in higher class there will always be (pretty powerful) rats in the sites.
---
Wormholes can lead to other regions of normal space (K-space) - nullsec, lowsec or highsec - or they can lead to wormhole space (J-space), which is similar to nullsec except that the systems are only connected via limited-life wormholes and don't have stargates.
---
Wormholes can have relic/data sites of two kinds: either they belong to a pirate faction (Serpentis, Guristas, Sansha, etc) or they're sleeper sites, which are denoted by "Forgotten" or "Unsecured" in the name. Sleeper sites will have hostile NPCs in them, so you should steer clear of them if you're in a typical exploration ship.
---
[Here's a handy chart to show which sites are safe to warp to.](https://forums.eve-scout.com/topic/409/safety-can-i-warp-to-this-site) Note that this doesn't account for hostile players hunting you down, which can happen in any site. Keep an eye out on d-scan for other players' ships or probes, and warp off if you see them.
---
Relic sites are typically worth far more in loot than data sites, so I would prioritise looking for relic sites first. Data sites only very rarely give out good loot in the form of rare blueprints.
---
this is dumb, you’re dumb. 
---
delete this.
---
Persistent low-level threats from small gangs is what keeps Nullsec from being boring. You really think Eve is in better shape when you can eat or mine without any possible interference? Fascinating.
---
You could do a kitey ship like an Osprey navy but they probably wouldn’t fight you at all. 
---
Your other option is brawling, so for that you want blasters, so probably a thorax or moa. Just fit dual web and scram, and you should apply ok even with void, but if you are missing just switch ammo types. Also fit max tank, obviously. You still probably can’t walk away afterwards, but you should kill a few of them before you go down
---
Oh, hey thanks op
---
 go out and pvp

---
"They're all out to fuck us over"
---
Before bubble decay you could find this on literally ANY deadend entrance. And what can be seen in your picture would have been a low effort gate. The maximum Mobile Larges I found (and petitioned without an answer) was around 200 on one gate in the superratting system of some PanFam-Alts in B0T-Space ...
---
I looked for places to buy them but I found this instead: https://www.modenstudios.com/EVE/music/
---
I completely agree with you on the first point/list. In the current state of Eve, with essentially 4 superpowers, it makes absolute sense for none of those superpowers to 'go it alone' because the other 3 are just going to dunk them. If Panfam invaded WinterCo, I doubt Legacy and Goons would sit by and watch, and I'm sure it'd be the same on your side. The question for me at that point goes back to whether having four mega coalitions divided into two 'sides' is good for the health of the game, and if not, what can be done to break those coalitions down or give them a reason to fight each other.
---
One example would be to reduce the amount of people that nullsec can physically support. If each region can only support about 2,000 pilots (a group approximately the size of Provibloc), then you'd instantly see conflict over regions because the space we have just wouldn't be able to support us all. This would also severely limit the effectiveness of super umbrellas because you'd need an umbrella per region, so if one enemy group decided to concentrate its force on one region, it would be hard to counter it with the umbrella in place. Moving umbrellas around to defend other regions would open up opportunities in the space they left empty, etc. Couple this with a fluid sov system -- "use it or lose it" -- and you'd have a much more contested nullsec where just setting up the biggest blob isn't the answer because it leaves massive swathes of your space undefended.
---
This would leave the megacoalitions (including Panfam) with a few options:
---
1. Invade our blue/renter neighbors (breaking up the megacoalitions) in order to support current krabbing capacity, but with a cost of being spread much thinner on the ground in terms of defenses and needing to use local defensive patrols, Ansiblex, and titan bridges instead of a huge blob of supers to defend our space;
---
2. Invade reds for space, though this would end up with the coalitions having space which is noncontiguous (for example Goons holding Delve and Kalevala) and even harder to project force to defensively;
---
3. Accept a much lower per-player mining/ratting yield, giving non-ideological krabs (those who don't really give a fuck about the alliance they're in) an active choice between safe space with a poor yield or dangerous space with a weaker group but with a better yield -- this could act as like an 'auto balance' between the groups.
---
Now, what's the downside of this approach? It actively makes it harder for newer groups to get into sov null. The way I'd want CCP to deal with this is to make it far easier to be competitive without being in sov null, including the ability to build supercaps without sovereignty and just more valid ways to play in j-space, lowsec &amp; NPC nullsec -- fix faction warfare, introduce pirate L5s, introduce pirate faction warfare, rebalance PI so the best planets are outside of sov null space, reintroduce something like old moons which give smaller groups as well as medium-sized groups something to fight over.
---
With regards to adapting, I reluctantly have. I have supers and titans, I have a krabbing operation, it's not the Eve I know and love, but it's what we've had to do to stay relevant. My question to you would be if a bloc like Panfam has a hard time staying relevant, what chance would a new group, or a pet group looking to become a coalition leader, have? How can Provibloc ever catch up with DeadCo, let alone with The Imperium?
---
We all win if the game has vibrance, and change, and a potential for us to lose.
---
Thanks! I ran the buffer fit for a long time for "pvp ready pve" in highsec and lowsec but I  always just got a noobship with an analyzer to hack the ghost sites. It's good to know that it can handle them.
---
Yeah. Sadly being in Dreddit 99% of the time I'm the cat herder on the nano gangs, and I throw myself in the combat probing arty svipul. It's a good fit, but man there are a lot of times I want to fly a nomen or something.
---
Skill training ruins new player experience and is an unnecessary hindrance in a spaceship game. Just putting that out there for all to see.

Now you have to teach them to be silent when someone says check check.

You mean do what this guy did: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xicrqIVd7dA ?
---
Well before Leshaks and Nestor logi I'd agree with you, but being able to run HQs with 4 logi (5 for TCRCs) instead of 8 helps to make armor equal or higher DPS on a fleet level.
---
I don't believe any ship should have a chance to "take care of itself", alone, vs. a 50-man fleet. Titans especially should always require support groups. It was designed to be a huge undertaking by many people to get it operational and make it effective. Now it can be an instant solo response to many threats (even if only the start of an escalating conflict -- an idea which I find humorous, because it's a \*titan\*, and belongs at the apex of escalations).
---
So what if i play on one account and  have 2 more accounts where i daily check in to raise my skills to have later 2 accounts where i can jump in if i get bored with my main account would that work too ?
---
and will not use my isk in the beginning to pay for omega cause that is limiting my playstyle

I definitely “lold” HaHa keep it up 👏😤

Laughs hysterically in aeon

I used to be the guy who would be podded, jump into another ship and go out for REVENGE... and realize after the podding that I hadn't updated my clone. heh.
---
You forget that FW is also undocking as a pirate hunting solo or in micro gangs in the plexes
---
"doing the fun stuff with my corp"  
---
This is probably fine. You'll have experienced people with you, and your learn/explode ratio will probably be favorable.  
---
Be advised that there are ways to fuck up of which you are not presently aware, and you should fly cheaply until such a time as you know da wey.
---
Sounds like a pro and a con at the same time. It's sometime fun to handle your own routes.
---
Do you believe there is any relevant difference money wise ?
---
I wish I could upvote you more
---
Honestly, defenceless mining ships ≠ fights, especially when hunters scram before a response fleet shows up
---
is it like the old days where if you haven't paid money to join a forum, you might aswell give up trying to get into any goonswarm corp worth joining and try and join an alternative like tapi/horde/whoever, only to end up quitting the game because they're all rubbish?
---
Skill training is what makes Eve, Eve. If you do not want it then eve is not the game for you.
---
You can comfortably enjoy the game with 1 account. If you intend to start getting into Capital PvP I'd recommend the second account.
---
The reasons are:
---
* You should always be able to move your capital ships yourself, you can get folks to help you but it can be a ball ache arranging for folks to help you constantly.
---
* Capitals are typically used in PvP as an escalation for subcap battles and rarely at that. For this reason most people train up Dread/Carrier/Force Auxiliary pilots on an alt. Exception is when dropping Caps/Supers for Home Defence.
---
You'll probably find that as you play the game for longer you'll want to try and be able to do different things. You'll therefore invest in more accounts as you get into different things are the training time (assuming you don't skill inject) is a nightmare to get decent skills for most things ... I started with 1 account and now have 3.
---
Join a newfie corp with a free rifter hangar. Most big alliances have something like this but facwar is maybe more activity and wont permanently taint your corp history
---
Boosh (not boost), ecm, or antitackle are your best bets for an alt. The boosh can get you out entirely, and the others break tackle so you can get own on your own. Bubbles fuck up all except the boosh, which is why it’s best. Your best bet, however, is keeping refits and dropping a depot when you drop your mtu. Keep an mjd, scram, web, stabs, and other pvp refits. 
---
If you get scrammed but no bubble, stabs will get you away. Bubble but no scram, mjd will save you. Scram and bubble, you’ll have to fight, so scram/web/paint him, kill him, and then mjd or burn out. All of those have to happen before his backup arrives, which is why people say it’s hard. Drop the depot before he comes and pay attention and you might survive. If you’re too slow, go full pvp fit and take them down with you... I’ve seen snakes kill a whole gang of gankers, so standing and fighting is a better bet than just hoping they fuck up in a full defense fit that will eventually break. 
---
I disagree with rolling holes for security. It takes time away from sites and it’s bitchy. Post scouts if you want, but the best bet is to be alert and have friends nearby... we frequently krab without scouting and hope someone drops on us so we can get a fight :)
---
&lt;3 Yep, larf's still kicking, good few of the guys are that vintage :)
---
Says the guy who is still communicating with the pathetic mindless bot. Lol I'm glad you're helping to keep my work day enjoyable.
---
&gt;I don't think so, it just takes an immense amount of fuel for the gate  
---
Might be wrong though
---
Yeah that does not sound right, left clicking should do nothing, holding left click rotates camera. Right clicking should bring up a menu if clicking in space, holding right click should pan (is that the correct word) the camera.
---
I wasn't referring to isk.  Any group in the game that can dreadbomb in large numbers, whether goon/test/pl/lowseccers, can also afford to replace said dreads.  
---
What the FC is really risking is: 
---
* The confidence his fleet has in him. people vote with their feet.
---
* The opportunity cost that comes with replacing said dreads. Goons presumably have to move new ones from delve. Yeah it's not logistically difficult but it still has to be done and it takes someone's time and effort.
---
* The trust his alliance leadership has in him. Goon leadership is notoriously stingy with regard to SIG SRP contrary to whatever f1 sheep bleat about MER
---
* The trust/confidence has him in himself.
---
None of this or my previous post is meant to be snarky. I've dreadbombed a fuckload yet I've never dropped as many caps (100 dreads) as goons did last night.  Thomas, Cainun, and Jay are smart guys and I know they'll learn from this and I'm unfortunately positive they'll be successful against us in future drops
---
Wow MVP right here. Thanks!
---
I'd like no intel gathering tools at all, no api's, reintroduce my blessed AOE doomsday I win button, make carriers back into triage and get rid of faxs
---
Until then, no. Never let it happen.
---
Ok, a few things here.  
---
- Nestors were around back then.  
---
- the good groups rarely used 8 Logi, DIN record was 4 in a TCRC, 6-7 was relatively standard. TPPH can easily be done with 3.
---
- Shield Leshaks are a thing
---
Good write up, pretty objective despite what some people are saying in this thread.
---
Couple comments I made in another thread about this fight: https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cgmbw6/argos_coalition_defend_freeport_fortizar_in/euij8zj/
---
Short duration? The duration's massive.
---
 7 - I'd also prevent combat capital ships of any type from warping to anomolies too. No more cap/super ratting.   
---
This is gonna go over well in Delve
---
But yep, that's one massive isk faucet down the proverbial drain
---
Ok, now how much cap do you have, do you even have a scram?  Or a prop mod?
---
Hows that PG lookin?  Can you fit some guns, or some neuts?  Better have an MJD too in 2019.
---
You think I pulled 200-300 out of my ass and then your rebuttal is 260 and is too tight on fitting to fit all utility high slots without down-grading.
---
Well, I didn't think of that and it raises a very valid point. Is there some sort of "rule" where you try to not undercut your corp mate on the market, or everything is fair in buy and sell ?
---
&gt;forget   
---
Can confirm.  I forget that sec status exists and shoot everyone without second thought *except* when flying tackle and being on gate.
---
My plan was to redeem it in a month and sell it then when the supply was lower.
---
I'm glad I checked the item itself and noticed it expires soon.
---
Just reduce assignable drones to 25, doesnt hurt small Nestor comps but prevents ridiculous Ishtar/slowcat multiboxing.
---
What are they?
---
I do believe black frog / Pushx rewards are higher, but at the cost of increast Risk and work ( remember --&gt; moving your cynos, find a "safe" way and have no / less citadell Network --&gt; never ever jump to citadell you dont trust the owner 100% ). rewards for alliance are differnt tho. Every Group sort it on their own way and if you have larger coalitions, you will have several members/Corps who wants to do the same Job.
---
Battle heron. It will kill any other covops frigate, including an astero, and it’s cheaper.
---
Typical goons damage control AAR lol.
---
First off fuck volta secondly wtf is that fit??? Please explain?? Why is there no tank or reps or anything on it just capacitor modules
---
There's like 4 actual SA members left in Goonswarm. Best way I can recomend is to apply to Karmafleet. Basically as long as you're not an obvious spy/awox alt, you'll get in. You can also try one of the 2 dozen plus member corps. They all have different recruitment requirements. Some are more hardcore PVP oriented, some are straight up indy corps. Look around, join some public recruiting channels and I can almost guarantee you'll find a Corp that fits your play style. Like I said, no one cares if you've ever logged into SA or not anymore.
---
They’re nerfing it for pve, not pvp.
---
It appears to be as irrelevant to the game as Walking in Stations was. Actually worse as it offers no value or challenge and simply is an artificial barrier that hinders role based gameplay and hinders DPS and fit comparison for newer players that could easily be solved and monetized by a static skill remap system and some basic imagination.
---
I'm just spitballing but it's genuinely how I currently feel about it. :)
---
The only negatives I perceive are if it somehow breaks lore and how it would be unfair to veterans who put in all that time.
---

---
Agree. It has it's place in highsec, and it's an ... interesting mechanic to limit engagements on gates (not sure if that's a good thing, actually), but in general - to make peoples life harder for fighting in a game about ... well, fighting, is probably one of the single mist stupid parts about eve.
---
They're only usable for like a week. Normally it's like a month.
---
We're not worried. Goons don't do well historically in lowsec.
---
I guess so
---
https://soundcloud.com/gsen/grath-and-madcat-vs-incursion-rats

One of my all-time favorites. Grath dies to Incursion rats on a gate while corpmates warp off and leave him to his death.

The part 2 is even better.
---
We need to step up our conga game.
---
No, fuck you spineless human blob.

Put your alts in every alliance and haul for all of them.
---
What they said. Plus, from known space you are looking for a wormhole that "leads into unknown space" (class 1 to 3) rather than "dangerous" etc. Because new WH explorers are screwed in there. The first thing you do when you enter is Bookmark the wormhole with a name like EXIT, then make a safe spot to scan from (ideally cloaked)
---
DScan is your friend because no one shows up on local unless they speak first. When you do sites, look for the pirate named ones and prioritize level 3 to do first. Make hitting V second nature; every few seconds, especially while doing a node.  If you see someone at 14au be prepared to run. If they're within 5 then GTFO.
---
Oh, and if someone from WiNGSPAN says they have your torpedo delivery ready, tell them you ordered a drone party instead and get a receipt. 😉
---
ROFL. "jump field generators and mobile scan inhibitors are prohibitively expensive and hideously bulky"   Do you even play this game?  Even a noob ship properly configured can carry one.  The cost is usually about a tick or so ratting,  Dirt Cheap for what they do.
---
untill ppl start complaining about it and it becomes an exploit, kind of like the dead space ESS trick.
---
I used to have a polarized ECM Tengu before they changed ECM mechanics that was particularly amusing. I hadn’t considered damps but I’m gonna have to look into that now...
---
I like to call it the highlighter skin.
---
It wasn't an alliance-wide stratop though, just a sig deployment.   I very much doubt Goons will drop the hammer for a low sec lols engagement.  Moving main fleet caps and supers around is a pain in the arse.

Fragile egos

There are some really convenient and well priced bundles on the eve dlc store. I started playing two weeks ago and bought the starter pack for 4.99. It can only be used once per account, so use it wisely.  It gives you a redeemable for 1 million skill points, a booster that makes your character a lot better in combat and lasts until your character is 35 days old,  and a week of omega, the premium status. 
---
Also if you decide to play either way, have someone send you a recruitment link. It gives your character 750k skill points. So if you use a recruitment invite and buy the starter pack you'll start with an extra 1.75million skill points, a 35 day combat booster, and week of premium. Well worth 4.99 in my opinion. It'll give you a real opportunity to see if you like the game with a minimal investment.
---
I've glad you are having fun. The game should be fun.
---
Also, I'm not saying that the hunt/home defense isn't fun.  I agree, the killmail isn't the only goal.
---
The only point I'm trying to make is that blackout doesn't solve the larger issues in the game that people have complained about.

Amen, caldari militia with our the glorious GavinGoodrich as FC, awesome times.
---
In that case, my suggestion would be to either fire up an azbel or base out of a station you have good standing with the owners of. Use the market module to run an ore buyback program at like, 90% jita value and just compress &gt; ship there to make corp profit. That way people get instant gratification and you can run a profit, as long as you're making 30m a day average you can run an azbel with market module &amp; refinery and make a profit doing so. Plus you can start constructing there too.
---
As far as 0.0 goes, there's quite a few corps like that which are PVP dedicated. Usually they run on a routine, like every tues-thursday there's roams with a specific theme in mind. There's a lot of malleability there and members are expected to make their own isk.
---
Good times. I joined in 2013 and remember Corp members bitching about paying 500 mill isk for a plex, and how "back in my day, they where 300 mill".
---
This whole "organized group of players" meme is boring. No one expects Imperium to just ignore small gangs; we just reasonably expect that subcaps should be able to get on field faster than supercaps.
---
Yeah, Google the name of the site before you enter. You’ll do fine. Welcome to Eve!
---
I would so pay for an offline wormhole mapping tool for solo players. Using the online ones is simply too risky. Even with published source code.
---
whats anchor time on structure? Maybe could have waited and jumped between your red timer and anchor time.
---
I miss the days when shitty  rose coloured glasses whineposts didnt get upvoted to the top every single day.
---
If I use a skill injector while one of these is active, will the game give me all of the extra SP based on the training times with the added stats from the booster or will it give me the lower train times just for the amount of time the booster is active, and then after that point give me SP as normal?

The incentive of joining a corp is that you join a group that is cooperating together. 
---
As for your specific goals, if you're into trade and industry, make it a short term goal to get the skills and know how to make tech2 items. Then aim to acquire your own infrastructure etc
---
To add to the other guy, the dlc packs can be bought as an alpha and will make you Omega plus give you skins and plex and other goodies you can use or sell to fund some early pvping or use to extend game time making it the most cost efficient way to get Omega early, but they can only be bought once per account and you might feel like it was a waste if you buy at full price and they go on sale again later.
---
Hate to break it to you, but the vast majority of that is nostalga. EVE has always sucked, player numbers have always been going down, the sky has always been falling, the latest fleet doctrine has always been unbalanced cancer, CCP has always been out of touch and completely unaware about how to actually play EVE, and the nullsec blocks have always been killing the game.  
---
For some reason we all keep logging in anyway.

If they fuck off from the one pass it wouldn't matter how fast you do it because their dscan reflex is above their heartbeat in priority.
---
It will just give you the numerical value of the injector
---
jesus christ you really have no idea how to fit ships, its amazing.
---
with the med slots filled with **all t2** heavy cap booster, grappler, scram, web and mjd you still have enought fitting room for a full t2 blaster high/5 high medium neut +t2 large smartbomb(!!), on the lows 2 large reppers, one ancil and dda, and there's still 2 rigs left. You can fit a shit ton of different stuff, that's just a cheapfit i came up with in 2 mins without any downgrading, no implants and no drugs, and they aren't tight . You cap is fine, ofc it isnt stable because charges but cap stability is silly.
---
ps:of course the lows also have the mods previously mentioned
---
&gt; You think I pulled 200-300 out of my ass
---
I thought, yes, but now im pretty sure of it
---
&gt; then your rebuttal is 260 and is too tight on fitting to fit all utility high slots without down-grading.
---
suuuuuure
---
Yeah the massive bass drop completely ruined everything.
---
So you are saying you want to sig tank inside recon range?
---
That's some impressive flying. Reminds me of something I've always wanted to do just for fun. Make a mini solar system of ships. Have an Orca in the center as the "star" with battlecruisers orbiting it at different ranges for the planets, then frigates orbiting the battlecruisers to represent moons. Would accomplish absolutely nothing, but it might look cool.
---
Ikr, checked LS killboard a while ago and half of them weren't even wearing the uniform, like some kind of degenerates. I found one of those vids, and a few more good ones on Vimeo, on my phone now so can't link, but should be easy enough to find.
---
Wrong sub? Or low effort shit post?
---
Turns out I fundamentally misunderstood how skills work, which is reassuring because a few days ago I pulled the 5IQ move of switching off of my training toon and then using a skill injector. I thought I had lost out on like 2 days of extra training from that move, but if it’s simply numerical and your mental stats simply affect the rate at which those numbers are applied then it doesn’t matter in the slightest.
---
Cool, I downvoted your comment. That way a whinepost won't get to the top. You're welcome.
---
It’s fair game
---
Interceptors are also the #1 transport option even over t2 industrials for high value small stuff like implants and salvage, or ferry more ammo to your ratting ship and get your loot out. Malediction is best because 4 low slots allow you to get sub 2s align even with mediocre navigation skills and still have room to fit a cargo expander to get 124.95 m3 cargo (ingame tool will tell you 125m3 but it is actually less than that, can be an issue if for instance you're trying to get more sentry drones to your rattlesnake or w/E)

I mean, they get on field the same amount of time. Subs can titan bridge and caps can bridge themselves. I don't think that is broken.

Great reply, very informative counter point.

&gt;Faction Warfare Either Finds a way to Thrive or Gets Deleted  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;[Quoting Hilmar:](https://twitter.com/HilmarVeigar/status/1150449465628794881) *FW is a major eyesore and a clear example of the "broken window" syndrome we need to wind down in EVE. It´s very much added to the backlog of things we are working down.* ***If you have ideas for solutions, please send them to me.***  
---
&gt;While this tweet arguably may not spell certain doom, it should send a message to anyone discussing Faction Warfare that there is zero room not to be bold. *Just okay* is not okay.
---
I really think you've misread Hilmar's tweet, especially given the context surrounding it. /u/ccp_falcon might be the person you need to get your confirmation, but my reading of it is quite the opposite - that the current state of FW is indeed 'an eyesore' that they're accutely aware of and have listed highly on their list of things to fix.    
---
I don't have time right now to go into all the things I disagree with in your document, but I'll be sure to give you my feedback. There are some things I agree with, of course, but mostly 'no'.

I did agree with almost everything /u/matthew_dust wrote on Discord though, so cue the downvotes ;)

Glad I can help. Sorry about your miserable job. Start being less of a loser and you'll find a better one that you don't have to make it enjoyable by embarrassing yourself on the Internet. Although I do understand certain people like you might enjoy getting humiliated on purpose.
---
Honestly I'd take it over [Lasers are Magic.](https://youtu.be/FQRIjzW-kg0)
---
This is a good point, it would need more thought, however I think relying on cycle time to balance would be far more constructive than balancing around sig radius which fluctuates far too frequently.
---
Ah, you mean the expiry - I thought you meant the actual duration - which is huge with Biology V.
---
The fact that you can even do that sends chills down my spine.
---
Not really wild about the dub step but you have to allow the young’uns something to play with too.
---
I've run the numbers before and honestly, the Leshak is a game changer for armor. Yes, you can run shield Leshaks but you can't run remote shield reps on them anywhere near as effectively as RARs (it's not cap stable) and you cant replace shield logi with Nestors at a near 2:1 ratio.
---
Basically you can put a 5th damage mod on shield comps as opposed to 4 on armor, which amounts to not a huge amount of DPS, in exchange you lose tracking which is a big deal on snipers (armor snipers are free to fit 2-3 tracking computers) and have to run higher logi numbers. Slaves are also a game changer (albeit one Shield will soon catch up with) because you can free up a low slot that otherwise would've been occupied by a plate.
---
The other major factor is that shield comps by necessity need more cap transfers. The Outouni is scary if you're a shield comp because it straight up turns your tank off. Against armor it does nothing.
---
I'm not even looking at TPPH tbh because the ISK/hr in a TPPH wall is cancerous. You want to be running NRFs and TCRCs and in both it's far harder to cut logi (read: add DPS) in a shield comp than armor. I dont think you can run TCRCs with 4 Basilisks, but you can absolutely run them with 4 Nestors.

Changes won't take 2 weeks to take place... And CCP most likely has more changes to come.

Not every change need to have an impact in less than a week to be good.

So, with regard to what you’re wanting to do, there are alliances that would take your corp in (mine included), but with 4 people, you might have a hard time paying alliance fees. The trade off is that you would benefit from alliance assets, protection, and activity - so if that’s worth it to you, that’s always an option.
---
As other people have mentioned, doing small-time wormhole activities can be great for a small, highly-dedicated group of players. You might be evicted every so often, but if you set aside some ISK, you should be able to manage that when it happens.
---
With regard to growing/managing your corp, if you want to do industry, my corp ran regular mining ops and split the profits between everyone there, keeping a portion for the corp (varying based on how much the corp has to pay for what it provides).
---
What the corp kept went toward setting up and maintaining stations, replacing ship losses, etc. If we had become more fully dedicated to industry (we ended up transitioning more to combat) I would have put more of the corp’s ISK toward providing mining crystals, getting blueprints for people to use, and things like that.
---
As far as I've been able to trace, only botters are using it, and even that's non-goon botters.
---
You botted yourself out of the game and came here to what, gloat? I don't know if CCP ever banned your main, but all of those "VPN accesses" and "non uniques" are called bots.
---
The only people using your application are botters.
---
You think he's not getting paid to run these bots?
---
"people"
---
You genuinely, honestly, dont think it's broken that I can put an Avatar on grid as quickly as a Malediction? Wow.
---
He doesn't want CCP to sue his fucking ass for dancing on the edge of the EULA and damaging the reputation of their brand.
---
All the largest alliances will probably have programs in place that you can join. Medium sized ones will at least have people who already haul who you should talk to.
---
Are you knew or something?
---
Every MMO needs progression. Wow has levels then raid tires, every MMO has this grind. If you remove people need to log in then you also remove peoples want to log in. Not because the rest of the game does not hold up but because people just work this way, they want something new frequently.
---
Another aspect is you can not give new players access to every skill or ship. They are very quick to be overwhelmed. Sp is just experience system from every other RPG but renamed to be more fitting in a sci-fi game.
---
Damn, I thought I had a few months for my crap from the last event, but noticed they are no longer in the redeem queue.
---
There are a couple ways to do it:
---
Sharing - People mine, ore is given to corp, corp returns ISK based on amount mined.  Very simply, but not growth oriented.
---
Goal oriented - Let's say the corp wants it's own Raitaru (building things) or Athanor (reprocessing ore).  The group mines and uses ore to build or buy the structures together.  Pilots get more infrastucture to use when mining for themselves, not the corp. 
---
Differentiating by 'corp mining' and 'personal mining' helps with clarity.
---
Taxes should be discusses as the corp gets revenue when corp structures are used for private purposes.  
---
IRL meeting starting, so I have to go..  Hopefully that's a start.
---
Blackout do have some good effect on decrease in botting. 
---
I guess CCP doesn't like alpha account afk ratting because CCP wants to sell more plexes. As a result, CCP wants afk ratting more difficult for alpha accounts. So inevitably, you will see fewer low-skill players in nullsec. But on the other side, myrm ratting and domi ratting don't require a lot more sp than VNI. Maybe 50-80k more sp? You can also regard the current sp giving campaign as a compensation for moving VNI ratting to domi ratting. Lol. Therefore,  "less people in space" may not be true and I am afraid blackout is the actual reason for less ratting, of bots or real players.
---
No offense, but I have an interesting counter-argument for "ships are much tougher to kill, then hunters in solo or small gang are less likely to roam = less people in space". if ratting ships are much tougher, then more players will do ratting, so more people in space. Lol. I am afraid no one knows whether VNI revamp leads to more players or fewer players. Lets see!
---
I want to add one more point. Don't you think solo ass frig hunting is a tiny bit cancerous? In many cases, the defenders don't have a good counter-strike way for solo ass frig, especially during blackout. Maybe an upgrade of hunting ships is good for everybody. Still not sure...
---
Aeon with that lava skin looks dope.

---
Fuck Snuff

Nah astero is way better.
---
Aye. You can actually tank the explosions in cruisers.
---
If you plan to do them in a frigate you have time for a couple cans.
---
Bring a cargo scanner and identify which cans are the most valuable and go for those. Sometimes they have bluepeints that can be worth a few hundred mill
---
How long does it take something to die while waiting. In delve we don’t get fleets that can’t kill something in under 2-3 minutes often.
---
Security status is a terrible mechanic

The nuance around **unwind** is pretty dangerous.  It's not clearly stating that deletion is an option but also definitely doesn't preclude it.

You can pretty much sum up the entirely of my disagreement with how MD ran the discord as, "why would you let a pro-mission troll pretend he's being diplomatic while just tossing poo at everyone wanting economic overhaul?"  It really caused a bad smell and economic overhaul is so obviously important that many pilots bounced as soon as they picked up the scent of pro-mission fraternizing.

I really appreciate it at this point.  I have PTSD from chronic re-litigation syndrome when people haven't given themselves time to digest the document

Wait, if you already have a suspect timer from somewhere else and aggress on a gate, you don't take gate guns? I thought you had to get a limited engagement.

I'm curious, what kind of money do you make hauling for black frog or for an alliance? How much per trip? Considering what I pay to red frog to haul in hisec, it seems like a lot of work for not a lot of gain.

Why would you fit two capital shield boosters and cap rechargers instead of more hardeners and shield boost amps?

Ah, you're right.  Saved me an imaginary Malediction ;-)
---
My posting doesn't indicate anything suchlike. I am well aware what it is. I am also well aware to what lenghts alliances will go when 30 titan kills are at a stake =]
---
\&gt;Basically ancient
---
How low-sec is more time consuming than null-sec? When you have no structures to defend, you can just go out with a ship for 30minutes and dock up anywhere when life calls you back. No CTA, no requirements.
---
&gt; You cannot sit here writing that Triglavian ships are "ok"
---
Please indicate where I said that because I said Triglavian ships are OP, not ok.
---
&gt;dedicated type of structure that can replace POS
---
You mean like a citadel? Have you been under a rock for the past 3 years where CCP has been phasing them out with citadels? 
---
The only thing keeping POS in the game is spaghetti code.
---
It's all in your head. We are happy to get away with it, even if once, against goons. And we aren't horde to complain about titans XD
---
First time seeing that video. So good. 10/10
---
I appreciate the support. I dont know how I'd ever pull myself out of lowsec miner bot hell without the support of fellows like yourself. You make this game worth playing and I truly wish I could one day fly with you.
---
Yeah I guess so
---
&gt; Joining Minmi or Gallente screws players without a hauling/JF alt from logistics.
---
Kinda what I just said. But if this is supposed to help new players get into the game, requiring them to have hauler alts isn't really new player friendly...
---
And now dangle 30 titan kills in front of any alliance out there which can kill 30 titans and see how many people will move on their own just for lols =]
---
Well remember your both competing to sell against your teammates and selling to your teammates.
---
So undercutting a Corp mate is also allowing a Corp mate to get the item cheaper.
---
So it sa net zero
---
That was sort of what I was getting at with “HAW”  Rreps. A cap rep module which cycles at the typical 3s cycle time in triage, but rep amount and cap cost are reduced. Meanwhile, current cap reps lose their triage cycle bonus which is replaced with an appropriately scaled bonus to AMOUNT of reps. Thus, they can keep allied caps up with cap reps, but subcaps will die in the 10-15 second cycle time on the cap reps. If you want to rep subcaps, you have to use appropriately scaled modules or suffer the cycle time.
---
I love my job but just because you love something doesnt mean its without fault. I wouldn't trade it for any other job in the world. As for being humiliated I cant say that I am. You're words could never cut as deep as my masters but I applaud the effort.
---
&gt;  player numbers have always been going down
---
I'm sure everyone who joined in 2016 agrees but the meme for a decade was eve player numbers only go up contrary to every other game which didn't exhibit this phenomena. It was a meme because players trended upwards for an actual decade straight before you got to eve.
---
&gt; nullsec blocks have always been killing the game.
---
Ever notice eve died when you joined? Take some credit mate. You inherited an un-killable forever-game and murdered it.

I honestly wonder how much the meta would change if dreads did significantly more damage.
---
&gt; wish I could one day fly with you
---
No thanks. I'm not particularly fond of flying with pathetic mindless bots. I appreciate your honesty for admitting who you are though.
---
You think that is what this is? 
---
This entire comment chain tells me clearly which side is sore about the entire ordeal, it certainly ain't Volta. Yet, why though?
---
Goons attacked. Hence they either prepared very poorly (knowing very well and in advance what they will be fighting - not an unknown entity but SNUFF = blingy slaved machs + apostles + possible escalations), or just hadn't planned for a proper fight?
---
To force the fight all goons had to do is land ~70 km off the machs and get ready to get pounded. The initial shuffle happened due to abbaddons warping in at 0 and tethering next to the defenders. Fight wasn't gonna happen at that point. It had started after the rewarp though.
---
And yeah, the initial small dread drop on the apostles hadn't gotten any response apart from just a few dreads. It's when Goons undocked and started jumping the rest of their dreads - the rest of the defenders dreads started jumping in as well. And titans went in when it became apparent that defenders had 20 dreads less.
---
And yeah, sorry for not shooting you - we ignored logis. The entire subcaps fight was centered around machs splitting their guns into 2/3 stacks and then alphaing abaddons off the field with every stack, 2/3 ships per salvo. Logis were a bit more of use in the latter part pf the fight, when machs refitted into ACs, but it escalated into dread brawl very quickly after that.
---
HICs and probers are in both systems "fuck it, it's time"
---
I've seen a lot of bad decisions in EVE, but this might be up there with the dumbest. Hopefully you learned from it bro
---
They're really good compared to T1 battleships  
---
The tank of a assault frigate when accounting for sig (because sig IS important) versus a cruiser or battleship is disproportionately high, much like the svipul on release. Not as bad, but still pretty bad.
---
Hey can I join yall? I'm looking for more people to game with. My old group disbanded after years of being together.

---
Once upon a time they were not so slow and clumsy to fly, but their lock times have always been long. "Big things lock small things much slower than small things lock big things" has always been a core Eve mechanic, if I am completely mistaken.
---
Up until a few years back, ships all warped at the same speed but there was a balance (sort of) pass to make small things warp faster, with a special bonus for interceptors. Kitchen sink roams became "Kitchen sink (cruiser and below)" partly because of this.
---
500mn and istabs mightve helped

It's a stale meme used unironically by people who are often yhe equivalent of f1 blob monkies in c5/6 space. Just ignore him
---
Basically.
---
Oh yeah and that resolved nothing for them haha
---
Every MMO needs progression:  I don't believe skill training is Eve's core progression.
---
Every MMO needs grind:  I don't believe watching a timer is a grind or attributable to any reward mechanism.
---
If you remove people's need to log in...:  I don't believe skill training timer is relevant to this need.
---
...they want something new frequently:  I believe ISK and asset ownership covers this.
---
...you cannot give new players access to every skill: A skill map/distribution system would easily address this and in fact improve upon this concern.
---
SP is just an experience system like every other RPG: I believe skillpoints and levels are usually attributed to in-game effort, something that Eve Online skill training does not link with.
---
Hope that helps :)
---
That parts easy, but how do you get roughly circular orbits of moons with the planets orbiting too
---
Why? Why should it be easy for anyone to come to our home and kill our most expensive ships? We work hard to keep each other safe. There is no mandate from anyone to do what we do and we have a very devoted group of people always on for fast response. If we go to other people’s homes, we fully expect to be dodging bosons and dreads and don’t care at all because it’s completely reasonable. I don’t get mad when Test drops their revenant on my talwars and my group always has fun poking the Dino’s. This idea that a “proper” fleet needs to be formed for every baddy that comes to kill people in our home is ridiculous and would just kill nullsec
---
Thanks a ton.  I had an alarm set for months from now to use up all my SP, hoping I might manage to find an empty ship in the meantime to steal.  Will definitely use those accelerator now.

There are a lot of roleplay corps around, some more hardcore than others.

They range from groups like PIE Inc. who are 100% IC, only fly Amarrian ships, etc, through to groups like Phoenix Naval Systems who are basically a normal lowsec PvP corp but with a lot of casual roleplayers in their membership.

You could even ask stacked tabs and colour coded backgounds on the tab part. If a chat channel  is created by CEO he can make it a corp channel and boom its green. Fleet is always purple and local is well as it is.
---
A big problem was that everyone would seed gates with them, causing lots of lag loading the grid. 
---
Also people like me who were pirates, would exit the station and drop mines on the way out then dock up again. Since everyone is forced out the same way, people couldn't do anything and would impact the mines. I was docked up so concord couldn't get me and I just had to wait out the aggression timer. I had a good laugh at it, but I imagine others hated it as there was no way to avoid hitting them.

It was 3k down from one month ago (Tuesday to Tuesday) at 1530 EVE time today. That's more than 10 % of the population. Weee!
---
Caps move at the speed of molasis, by the time they get 4 jumps out from their home systems the fight that they were aiming for would be over with. As for spreading out, there is no way they would be able to put enough caps or supers on field if everything was spread out. So no, try again lol

I think it's not about the old times having been better or given more opportunities.

I think we just all grew up.

yeah i can export the code for the apllication it self with out a problen its just a .sql file with all the reports but alot (and i mean alot) is done within the Oracle Database itself. Its not as simple to export all that without giving away information about the system itself (wich is an security risk). So the application is two parts, one is the APEX application itself with all the reports and pages and one is the logic in the database. 
---
And I understand that its more a risk, but for every external project how sure are you that nobody is using it? So its optional to give the application extra information, its not needed for the application to work. So if you just want to use it to map anomalies nobody can see further than that.

That's why we see a lot of their use. Wait a minute...

Did your D&amp;D group defeat a demigorgon by any chance and encounter a mind flayer quite recently?
---
Oh fuck, Kingwood. This dude lives on the other side of the lake from me.
---
Yeah should work fine.
---
I am looking into a way to share it without giving away vital system information.
---
If anyone is intreseted into the code for the apex application im willing to share it just drop an DM :)
---
But the database is not as easy i need to clean it alot before i can share that.
---
thanks appreciate it took some real effort on this one i know lots of people in the game do not like the Amarr to much but its still very stunning.  
---
they were my first race still have a solid place in my heart all  a few of the ships need is a mid slot and they will be in a solid place.
---
So, if I’m understanding you correctly, J-space is usually less occupied compared to K-Space?
---
Also I figured out how to turn my d-scan into a bubble and have that in the bottom right hand corner of my screen. However I notice that it’s difficult for me to discern, what’s NPC &amp; what’s not. Even then i can’t distinguish between what icons mean what and what ships names to be on the lookout for.  Any big tips for making the most out of d-scan?

What's with the 'Limited Time' tag on my Men's Frostline Exploration Suit? Is it only obtainable for a limited time or is it going to be removed altogether at some point?
---
if you balance by a logical ehp/cost/pilot number ratio a full tank super should probably have less then 5m ehp. A nyx is a horrifyingly isk efficient ship for the power/required pilot ratio.
---
Why is a capital ship alone? Are they supposed to be solo ships? No.
---
the same ships I'd recommend a newer player, except you can fully T2 fit them and not meta-cheapfit them. frigates and destroyers are great to get used to the shakes you'll get at first, and proper module control (**BIND. YOUR. MODULES. INCLUDING OVERHEAT.**)
---
https://zkillboard.com/character/2112874265/losses is a great place to start for lowsec fits (his [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChWF7tXZFt-iaXWO0qB64Tw) is good too)

feel free to jump into some active tanked cruisers etc. too, you can get some good fights vs smaller groups in frigs/destroyers in them
---
They were sold via the official eve forums and GMs would ensure no scamming took place.

Eve is a love hate relationship :) thanks for the support &lt;3
---
You probably want to start with T1 frigates. They can go in Novice plexes, which get you the best chance of a 1v1 with somebody who's not rocking a (much) more powerful ship. Something that can fit 3 light neutron blasters, an AB, and a scram. Merlin, Atron, and Incursus are all good. Load faction antimatter, go to a novice plex, orbit the warp-in beacon at like 500m, and wait for visitors.
---
I have good news :) its is possible, so i will implement it.
---
This. Go look at Tuskers KB losses for fits, they're good and teach you a lot of different things. Also record your fights and rewatch them, youll learn SIGNIFICANTLY faster by doing this.
---
Kind of rude to roll them in, no?
---
Not sure, he didn't invite me over....
---
Is the Men's ORE Claim Surveyor Suit available in-game at all?
---
Fair counter argument! Though all those ships already exist and yet 90% (completely made up) of ratters have been using VNIs.
---
And totally agree that hunting ratters with no counter is not exactly elite PvP. The thrill is in the chase, but when you’ve got them, they can’t really do much other than call in backup or die. 
---
But as I said elsewhere, it’s not about a free meal - just want to make sure the food chain is healthy! You need tasty morsels of all shapes and sizes 😋
---
&gt;instead you opt for a system of tradeoffs (which I agree with) - this balancing philosophy is essentially derived from rps mechanics. 
---
The "correct" way has nothing to do with wanting a weakness and a hard counter.
---
every point on the line is a constant distance from you.
---
there's no real mystery there.

&gt;the moment someone provides you with any information invalidating a tiny piece of your world view

Still waiting for anything tbh.

It's pretty obvious that you are a typical know nothing know it all that pics up all his info from more no nothing know it alls in your corp.
---
As for a narrow world view, maybe pull out a mirror. 
---
Sad.
---
T1 Cruiser's, Battlecruiser's and Battleships is my recommendation. My favorites to take out are: Rupture, Scythe FI, Vexor, Hurricane, Dominix, Armageddon and Tempest.
---
The reason I choose these even with the idea of "unlimited isk" is engage-ability. You will find it difficult to get into good fights with bling ships due to either getting blobbed or simply being avoided. The best way to get better is to get into as many fights as possible and T1 ships tend to be target people are willing to engage.

U could buy the code on CCPs website and they was a button to redeem/convert them into an ingame item aswell and sell them on the market then

I've played this game for 12 years. Every single ship has changed from when I first trained into it. The game meta changes. Sometimes the changes improve your play style and sometimes they don't. Your post makes you seem totally out of touch with reality and entitled to having the game catered to you. If you don't like the current direction quit. I've done it before and will probably do it again.
---
And this is why I think all Capitals should have to go into Siege/Triagr mode in order to do anything well. 
---
Also, buff non-HAW Dreadnought guns.
---
I'm talking about before that. The ingame PLEX was created long after the GTC trading forum.
---
There were two Vanqs, and it was 100% the latter. We also fell for it like rubes, but you can also never not take the shiny bait on the off chance that they miscalculated.
---
So how high are alliance fees?

Thanks.
---
its a beautiful star and color for the new rupture skin the background still working on the image takes time making it more extravagant..

saved me alot of time as i was removing the city and rendering better zoom image and got lucky found that pre-set the same color as the new rupture skin :)
---
Cynic in me: Or you have a part of the community feeling like haven't been heard for a while. You come on and tell them what they wanna hear and follow it up with "but I'm not a game designer and it's not my decision" and "but they're just my dumb ideas lol". Now you've made them feel heard with no actual commitment to follow through.
---
The sad reality is sub caps are basically phased out at this point. Against proper structure they don’t stand a chance. Every group that still plays Eve has pushed pilots into caps and they are a bit overpowered. CCP went down the road of citadel based PvP and unregulated Krabbing. The perfect storm of what the current meta is now

ohh I didn't even consider using interceptors for transport. Thanks for the tip!

&gt; Avoid Whs close to jita as they are more likely to be camped
---
Generally, avoid WHs in all high-populatoin highsec, because the chance that the sites inside will be picked over/prescanned by guys waiting to kill daytrippers is is a lot higher.
---
Go someplace off the beaten path by about 4-5 jumps, *then* start scanning down holes.

As long as you aren't doing something like buying up everything on the market and relisting it for much higher right before a strat op.

Configuring your overview properly is an important part of getting the most out of D-scan. I use the Z-S Overview settings, which I believe can be found on the in-game chat channel "Z-S Overview". Overviews made by other players exist and may be better, but it's the only one I can recall by name.
---
With any overview, your D-scan window will have a list of presets that you can set to filter your overview. "PvP: Exploration" or "PvP: Basic" should show players' ships and probes on D-scan while filtering out unnecessary stuff like planets and moons.
---
Learning the icons for ships is mostly a matter of memorisation; here's a [key](http://i.imgur.com/GPn23oT.png) to aid your memory. Pretty much anything can be a threat to you in an exploration frigate, besides the other T1 exploration frigates (Heron, Magnate, Probe, Imicus) which usually won't be armed. 
---
The most likely ships to be hunting you as an explorer are the Astero, Stratios and strategic cruisers (Loki, Tengu, Proteus, Legion). All can fit covert ops cloaking devices, which means they likely won't show up until they choose to reveal themselves. Any and all will shred you to pieces if they can tackle you with a warp disruptor/scrambler to prevent you from escaping, which is why it's important to refresh d-scan and be on the ball when you're doing relic sites in dangerous space.
---
You're far less likely to be hunted as an explorer in highsec because your pursuer will get blapped by the NPC police force CONCORD after aggressing you (not that that will be much comfort after you're already dead), but with that reduced risk also comes reduced reward. The loot you'll find in highsec is barely worth bothering with compared to wormhole and nullsec loot, which can easily be 80+ million in a single good relic site.
---
Other tips for D-scan: mess about with range if you see a ship on your scan, and you can work out roughly how far it is from you. You can also reduce the angle of the scan and scan towards specific objects to pinpoint the ship's location more accurately, but this is more useful for hunting people than being hunted since you don't want to go *towards* your pursuer. It can, however, be useful to see if they're sitting on the wormhole that you need to use to escape. If there's another ship around in nullsec or J-space, best to assume it's hostile.
---
To evade pursuers, it's useful to have a "safe" spot that you can cloak up in and scan in peace, or warp to when you need to escape. Creating a safe is as simple as creating a bookmark (Ctrl+B) while you're in warp. I like to warp to a random planet or moon after bookmarking the wormhole I've come through and then create a safe while in warp. 
---
The only way for your pursuers to find you when you're at a safe spot is to use combat scanner probes, which also show up on D-scan so you'll be aware of them if you're actively spamming the button. Even combat scanner probes won't find you if you're cloaked; in fact, the only way to find someone who's cloaked is to get within 2km of them to decloak, and that's impossible if you're at a safe that hasn't been scanned down.
---
In Wh, if something new pops up on dscan... RUN
---
The fleet pre-dubstep consists of the following ships:
---
* Maelstrom  
---
* Drake  
---
* Hurricane    
---
* Scimitar  
---
* Tempest  
---
* Brutix  
---
* Moa (or T2?)

* Scorpion

* Vexor

* Harbinger

* Lachesis (or T2)

Citadels represent a very good change imo but there are aspects of them that aren't POS like that some of us veterans want to make use of. Using them as forward operating points is one of the only things a POS is still good for. Citadels don't quite fill the niche that takes up imo, it takes an organised group maybe 3 days and two bash sessions at most to take down a large pos and the same can take weeks for a citadel depending on timers.  POS also go up very quickly, I can have a death star up in 2 hours compared to the day or two it takes to put up a citadel.
---
5 is the only enough.
---
I disagree with the OP but this idea is even worse.
---
One thing I see that I don't feel is adequately addressed and could be quite impactful is changing rewards for the FW missions.  I would propose removing the current tier modifier for mission LP payouts - the rewards during T4/T5 are at insanity levels and contributes to the massive farming fleets we see everytime the warzone control flips.  This floods the market with LP items that only hurts the isk conversion rates for the true FW players.   Want more people fighting for the warzone?  Get them out of backwater systems in instawarp Jackdaws blapping NPCs making 5x the LP/hr that the PVP players are making fighting true enemy militia.
---
Reworking how the missions to keep players more engaged or on grid longer are fine but seem like a lot of developmental changes whereas just bringing their risk/reward more inline with plexing solves the same problem with minor tweaks.
---
Overall I would agree, but if you are only running exploration sites then I wouldn't *necessarily* say so. The Astero is *far* more combat capable (as in it doesn't explode when given a mean look like a covops frigate) and warps off grid faster, but a Helios scans better (with the covops skill trained well), warps faster, has 1/3 the cloak reactivation delay, and has the mid slots and increased rigging for a bit more flexibility. While the scanning bonus of a covops requires skills to get up to the level of the Astero, the Helios can use the extra mid and rigging space for more scanning bonuses, easily making up for the skills and only getting better as they are trained. 
---
While it's not a big deal by any means, a Helios can also fit an extended probe launcher. You won't have use of combat probes by yourself normally, but with local gone deploying combat probes can be a helpful bluff to scare off would-be attackers. I like to deploy them and move them well outside of dcan range of any point in the system. If something fishy shows up in local and starts poking around, the combat probes can be quickly brought within dscan range without breaking your cloak. Nobody likes seeing combat probes pop up when they are trying to hunt someone. It's a gimmick, but it can be effective at least as a way to make a hunter second-guess their plans.
---
Without effective combat skills and practice, the Astero is going to lose to someone hunting you anyways so IMHO it's best to focus on being as slippery as possible and maximizing scan speed so you can spend as little time with your probes out as possible since they are basically broadcasting to the system that you are going to be checking out the sites.
---
Ultimately, it's really up to choice since they are both fully capable of doing exploration sites, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't get in an Astero as soon as I could when I started out because of how cool they look.
---
They were facing a coalition of diverse groups that would never stick together long term.  Not the same as facing a single entity bound by existential trials together that on it's own outnumbers the entire rest of eve's super fleet.
---
You have to admit there is a huge difference.  Also the large coalition that defeated GOONS would have active subterfuge and jockeying for position internally, which GOONS would not.
---
While it's just space pixels that's still time/money to get which sucks to happen to you. It would kind of be like if someone took your phone and smashed it but they had a good time so it's ok.
---
But it's a game and he did something stupid with something expensive so...
---
I mean you want to drop right after it happens because the person will be stuck in place and can't go into round 2 for at least a few minutes. This gives ample time to do the deed. If you drop too early you risk getting a load to the face.
---
Those are some questionable decisions one after the other... hope he learned something at least.
---
*contention
---
Contestion is not a word.
---
I think people just don't understand the "little guy" mentality. Most of us remain in the small groups for the challenge of trying to fight off the ever growing blob of null blocs or their pets.
---
Someone else said it best in this thread. The blackout isn't something that specifically helps/hurts small groups trying to take sov. As the poster said the large groups will just roll in with capitals entosising your stuff that you'll never reach the numbers to counter.
---
Instead what it does is provide mystery and uncertainty to daily 0.0 life. It allows small groups to pick engagements without the defenders staying docked all day because they see you in local chat. It means that any gate could be a gate camp even if someone went through it safely just a few minutes ago. It makes it so that you have to be prepared with an umbrella if you decide to mine with your rorquals. All of this was virtually impossible because you were spotted the second you entered system. 
---
This dynamic player generated gameplay is what allows all the cool stories in EVE. Objective base warfare will remain the same but it allows raiders to actually raid without being crushed the second they enter a system.
---
Now in terms of objective based  warfare (structures, sov, moons) I think those are hobbled by the frustratingly long structure timers and the ubiquitous use of caps both of which you don't even touch upon.
---
&gt;Older players preying on newer players isn't a new thing.
---
That is correct. It seems impossible to not happen in a game that is 16 years old. Those players still give a much better fight compared to getting one shot by a blob of just as old players.
---
&gt;Joining a corp doesn't mean joining a blob. Btw at this point your projected meaning of what a blob is is "more than 1 person." 
---
Is that how brave got started? "We help new players" and six months later it was a blob.
---
&gt;Join a corp does not mean "join one of the major null blocks" it means "Join a corp." Join up with some people who want to play like you do and play with them.
---
They know if almost every new player joins a corp, the established ones benefit. Thats why the narrative is so important to them and fake to the rest of us.
---
&gt;So now you enjoy getting blobbed? I thought you hated that. 
---
Why would you think I like getting blobbed when I am arguing against blobs? I guess I can expect such an incredibly retarded interpretation from a blobber.
---
&gt;Gathering up into supergroups is the optimal way to play. And if you try and not do that don't be suprised when somone else turboshits on you by doing just that. 
---
So now the argument is not about retention or helping new players, but actually about what benefits you.
---
&gt;That's why we need to push CCP to change it so that's not the optimal way to play.
---
Thats big coming from someone arguing for more blobs.
---
&gt;There is no choice to make. You either play optimally or you get shit on by someone who is. 
---
And then you end up with empty space and a few systems with cancer blobs, like FW and null.
---
&gt;The blob didn't consume people the way you consume people.
---
You think all those cancer camps and cyno baits didnt take their toll? Thats funny.
---
&gt;People don't like being turbodunked all the time.
---
If you didnt push people to blob, it wouldnt happen as much.
---
&gt;So the best way to not get turbodunked all the time is to group up into the biggest possible groups so that they both can't be dunked on anymore and can dunk on others. 
---
Yes, blobs and null. So much empty space and dead game.
---
&gt;You won't get around this by going "ok everyone play nice." It will require fundamental change to break up the large groups into smaller groups.
---
You want to replace pvpers who offer real content with farmers and whales in null.
---
Uhhhh... It's not a troll tho.
---
Am high ish so player myself, can say the Atron is the best. If you want to really learn make an alpha and role play a poor bastard for three months
---
This is what happens when Black Rebel Rifter Club pilots try and fly supercaps. Shame!
---
No, I don't want it to be easy. And I don't want everyone to form a fleet every time some random group roams their space (that'd be dumb and would end up with standing fleets just gatecamping entrances 24/7). What I do want is existing ability to prepare and set up in order to heavily punish (see: D-W beacon incident, it should be possible to do to any adhoc response fleet drop even outside staging) routine, laziness and any small mishap in staying fully aware of existing threats done by standing fleet. 99% of the time you should be as safe to randomly dunk on roamers just as now, but we do need that 1% chance of said roam being a bait to get your 10-20 supercaps on grid and kill them before you can get enough people to login and rescue them *unless* you learned about it beforehand and are now (as a group) baiting the bait while being fully prepared.
---
That's why I see current umbrella size as big problem - because as of now virtually every nullbloc is capable of ad-hoc fielding enough supercaps to wipe out 100-man dreadbomb before they manage to kill anything of value. There is just too many supers concentrated in singular areas to have any chance of outpreparing and outsmarting what currently makes the standby fleet - and effectively reducing things like intelligence, active threat searching and similar activities almost irrelevant. It's just this, nothing more - I just want more diminishing returns for risk reduction, so if you spend 10x as much time and effort to stay safe, you'll be safe in 99.5% cases instead of just 99%, but also will never be 100% safe, even in heart of Delve.
---
Generally buying out limited quantities goods and relisting them for a higher prices if frowned upon however (may vary with your alliance's rules). Because that's definitely not net zero.
---
Of course it suits well. However I'm not the one getting upset about an internet troll. And especially low effort troll at that. Speaks volumes of your character
---
If you want to learn and improve then I'd suggest:
---
\- blaster Atron or beam Torm for scram range fights. Atron is way better, imo, cause of its versatility and speed.
---
\- beam Slicer for long point kiting
---
\- mwd + long point arty Thrasher
---
\- stabber (it's a frigate :p)
---
Not one of those is oppressive and you'll get ton of fights.
---
Fly them all, best way to learn to beat a ship is to lose a bunch of them.  You will learn the weaknesses that way
---
Go buy 50 Rifters and 50 Punishers. T2 fit them and go fight in Novice FW plexes. After all 100 are dead you will have a much better feel for PvP.
---
I recommend basing out of either Amamake or Kinakka.

I think he's kind of already on the CSM in a way.

---
the best part of this fight is the Vanquisher piloted by someone named "Nerd Trap" baited the dreadfleet into wasting a bunch of time on it
---
So idea....lets make them slower, but mine way more, but to balance it we should make them bigger and only be launched from the rorqual. Then we should rename them to "Excavators".
---
Especially where stuff interacted, the method of gutting L4's might be a little abstract.
---
If CCP gets the knobs dialed correctly, players who don't PVP will either have few to no missions to run or those missions will be worth very little LP.  Doing the PVP means you've spent time, cutting ISK / hr.  Optimum PVP LP / hr requires kills, so you can't just spin uncontested timers either. Overall, it just won't be possible to endlessly grind L4's the way it is today.  What LP you make will instead be diluted by the shifts in the success of the PVP players, subjecting mission farmers to the receiving end of inflation.  
---
Once the reward gets in check with the effort, you can bet most mission runners will move on to better fields.
---
I'm on board with removing the tier effects on elective PVE payouts.  There should be milestones for players to achieve, and so I'm not saying remove anything even like tier, but don't treat elective PVE as the reward for achieving milestones.  Treat elective PVE as a supplemental income stream available for players who PVP, independently of tier.

Haha ccarebear? There is so much Eve slang it’s insane
---
Apparently so did I, or didn't I? It doesn't really matter if you can't even classify PLEX correctly.
---
PLEX is still a commodity. (Read: GOODS) People using a commodity as currency doesn't remove its status as a commodity and it never will.
---
Might as well quit the economics course if you can't get that one correct after 101.
---
And the reason for ignoring your DVD analogy is because of its stupidity. Man, you could've gone with drugs but no, you're bringing movies into this. Drugs can be sold and resold again and again for whatever form of currency or commodity the people desire but it can only be consumed one. single. time. Guess what else can only be consumed once: PLEX.
---
But I guess that comparison would've fitted too well, thus the DVDs.
---
And to reiterate: Reselling is not causing a loss of money. If you're selling a consumable and people find another way to procure and second-hand sell your consumable then it's none of your business. That's like a car manufacturer whining about losing money from people selling on craigslist. Sure, those people offer the same thing and every time someone buys a car from craigslist the manufacturer doesn't see a penny from that... 
---
Oh wait, they did actually, WHEN THEY SOLD IT THE FIRST TIME.
---
I'll now leave this discussion before you reach the conclusion that *gifting* PLEX hurts PLEX sales because the guy/girl who got free PLEX doesn't have to buy it anymore...
---
Istabs, no cyno, and one cap injector.  at least he had the right rigs

Honestly ccp should disable cynos 30 min before dt

A rocket Kestrel. It's simple in use, no cap management. This allows you to focus more on the fight itself rather than trying to micromanage all kinds of toggles and getting a massive sensory overload.
---
Works both in low sec (with AB) as in null (with MWD). Look up Suitonia's "eve is easy" videos on YouTube to get more info on the why and how.
---
That's how the cyno mechanic works. And why would you change that? What does the size of the ship have to do with how quickly it can bridge to a cyno? I'd like an explanation as to how that is broken other than it's "unfair" which is all I'm hearing. It's not "unfair" as both the attacker and the defender can choose to escalate with Titans if they choose. Cyno's are not broken it's people complaining about cyno's that are broken.

In short, don't be a dick

3) spawned a few catchphrases when he switches to english or uses english cognates, such as "STRUKTURA" and "COME ON BEET-CHES"

although that video is more about him being excited than raging since he was the one killing the titan
---
And the award for most subjective question goes too!!!................ THE OP!!!
---
It doesnt teach him anything anyway, he literally asks to "fly around warzones" so he can learn and this dude says "camp at 0 with no a brain blaster fit or gank people with a curse" like what will you learn from that, how to lock a target and click a button?
---
I really appreciate you taking the time to write this up! It really means a lot! 
---
The evasion part seems like it might be the trickiest part to “master”, but with the way you’ve spelled it out I think I’ll be able pick it up soon enough.
---
Lastly, it sounds like I should be working towards low-sec areas to gain any ISK. However I’m working with about 2.4M ISK. Since dying is expected often in low sec especially for newer players, how much ISK would you recommend I build up before I’m good to start venturing out there?
---
The rorqs are tackle fit
---
How is 2020 correct
---
Echoing what others have said, you might want to come into Null Sec. Providence is one of the only parts of nullsec where you can fly around safelyish without joining a local corp. 
---
If you are LOOKING for a corp, I recommend mine (of course!) Dreddit. It's the Reddit corp, and with our allies we own the whole bottom-right corner of the map. Free ships and skillbooks on demand. Mentors to help you settle into nullsec life. Our own wiki, forums, etc. 
---
Our alliance even has a website for exploration, so you can see where other explorers are and find a quiet corner. I get 10MM from data sites and sometimes 100MM from relic sites in Esoteria. There are people in corp/alliance that buy exploration loot at basically Jita prices. 
---
You don't need to join our corp, or any corp, to have fun in the game. But if you want to move to nullsec, I think we're a great choice. Check www.DredditIsRecruiting.com for the HR and Discord links. 
---
Fly safe!
---
Yes, and if you are just starting PvPing in eve, which thanks to the shakes is different than pvp in every other game, it \*might\* not be too bad of an idea to learn how to orbit and press a button first before jumping into more complicated ships to fly.
---
Are cruisers typically used for exploration? Thank you for the quick tip! Looks like , with the right prep they can be pretty profitable
---
No new games for your nintendo switch?
---
Combat battlecruisers are great - very cheap after insurance, and they have good staying power so you can make multiple mistakes before blowing up instead of just one. Buffer Brutixes and Hurricanes with two webs will apply to anything you can catch, and you'll only have a couple of modules to forget to use properly.

A short clip but one of our guys went mad when people wouldn't let him get in an Orca whose pilot ejected

I kid, mostly. I made my account in 2008 when I was still in high school.
---
Now I have car insurance and student loans.
---
Growing old sucks, but growing up is an option. Now we just get to do what we enjoy and not get yelled at by people older than us.
---
Yeah, if only that was the question
---
I'm going to suggest something no one else will.
---
Don't start with Frigs and dessies.
---
Your have unlimited isk.
---
So.
---
Start with a Phantasm.
---
I'm sure unlimited isk is actually pretty limited, but it doesn't matter.
---
You can put together some exceptionally tanky Phantasm fits that are cheap (130m with nanite, drones, drogas and charges). That still brawl for 400dps.
---
Why a tanky Phantasm? Because it's very hard to pin down. You can run away from just about any gatecamp with a 2k ehp/s panic tank that you can run capped out, or a ~500 dps tank that you can run for about 5 minutes straight. Not to even mention the huge sig tank of the phant.
---
Your fights will also last a looooooot longer than most things because of your insane tank. This is the number one reason to use this ship, you want long fights *that you Record* so that you have a lot of content to go back and review and see where your can improve. 
---
Also, is a faction cruiser so lots of people are gonna want to kill you so you'll get lots of fights.
---
Once you get the hang of combat in general you can move on to either a normal Phantasm fit or branch out.
---
Oh yea forgot about the Brutix! Always love man tanking a few of those :) 
---
Indeed I think staying power is a big key. T1 frigate fights are fun but sometimes end too fast to really go through all the mechanics of a fight
---
Oh, I understand that, but what kind of money are we talking about? Could you give a ISK/hr estimate? I'm currently wondering if it's worth it to haul with my freighter alt. Or even training it to become a JF alt.
---
Why Oracle? Curious

A more math-y explanation is the "line connecting a three dimensional point to its projection onto a 2D-plane."
---
The mathematics which covers this topic is generally found in a third-level Calculus course (e.g., Calculus III) and maybe Linear Algebra, depending on how advanced your class is both of which you would see in a college curriculum for any STEM major.
---
Try Google'ing "Point Projection on a Plane" and you should get lucky, it is a pretty common mathematics problem :D

How do you incentivize players to stick around in the proposed system if they miss a few key timers due to work/family/travel and chunks of their deferred LP become socialized? In addition, how do you deal with burnout if a side is consistently losing? Deferred LP is a carrot but it has issues to work out.

My FC the other day after caps hit the field: "Well, we're not really important here anymore so just go tether up and wait until they call for tackle."

Lowsec exploring from highsec can be a dicey proposition; a lot of the gates at the entrances to lowsec are camped by people looking to catch the unwary and unfortunate. [Eve Gate Check](http://eve-gatecheck.space/eve/) is a useful tool to avoid gatecamps, although sticking in high-sec and scanning down wormholes to daytrip into wormhole space is likely to be more profitable than lowsec exploration even with lowsec being as dead as it is nowadays.
---
If you're truly short on ISK, check out the starter missions in your starting system to get some frigates and money to help get you on your feet. Tech 1 exploration ships are inexpensive, and a good haul of relics will easily pay for fifty replacement ships.
---
If someone kills you, try sending them a message or starting a conversation. Plenty of people are willing to give newbies some pointers so they don't die the same way again, or even ISK donations to help them stay in the game.
---
Thats what happens if you steal from Stain ppl.
---
I have had enough. I don't care that EVE is a PvP game. I don't care about highsec, lowsec, or whatever-the-fuck-sec. I have lost the fifth hauler this week and I HAVE HAD IT. I don't care that 'undocking is consent to PvP' I DO NOT FUCKING CONSENT TO PVP. I AM AN INDUSTRIALIST AND I WANT YOU TO LEAVE MY FUCKING SHIP AND CARGO ALONE.
---
If your response is going to be "herp derp EVE is a PvP game" SHUT UP I DON'T CARE. If this is supposed to be a purely PvP game, then WHY HAVE INDUSTRIAL MECHANICS IN THE FIRST PLACE? To just put non-PvP players under stress and upset them with constant losses? I DON'T WANT TO FIGHT, I JUST WANT TO GET STUFF FROM A TO B AND I AM SICK OF LOSING SHIPS NO MATTER WHAT FITS I USE. And you can shut up with "blah blah risk" too, because I'm sick of assholes taking the ore or commodities I WORKED FOR just so you can put another notch on your stupid fucking killboards and circlejerk about it with your stupid fucking alliance. I AM TIRED OF LOSING SHIPS AND I WANT IT TO STOP. LEAVE MY HAULERS ALONE YOU FUCKHOLES. LEAVE MY SHIT ALONE.
---
"hep derp salty tears" YOU CAN SHUT UP TOO, FUCK KNUCKLE. Log off, bust up your modem with a hammer, eat it, then go burn ants with a magnifying glass or torment your neighbour's cat or whatever the fuck you used to do before you discovered EVE. You're a fucking shit-covered festering pile of cunt rags who desperately need the asshole lobotomized out of them.

How am I supposed to 'git gud' when all I have are scores of floating wrecks? I don't even get a chance.

Were there concord capital armor reppers 5 years ago?

It’s probably what made sense at the time...

What are those TD's for u/captator ?

I don't believe there was.

Never underestimate the autism of eve online players.

So not at all salty then about esoteria?
---
keep in mind, many large entities enforce caps on profit margins for doctrine gear. Also, doing neut contract is more chill as you can just surf contracts. in big entities both managers and customers will be close contact... sometimes too close
---
I didn't think so either. Making that fit not from 2014.
---
Resorting to the troll defense every time could really hinder your recovery from being a pathetic loser. I can only help you so far.
---
Oh I don’t really.  Stuff like this will go thru my head when I ask what all the logged in people are doing.  Literally nothing.
---
Also, the last zkill activity from that character before today was april 2015.
---
So at the very least, OP is a year off.
---
Not saying I don't believe, just curious.
---
Stabbers are fun and cheap (yeah I know unlimited isk). People will engage you but you'll still win sometimes.
---
Wow, that's just absurd. I can't even be salty, if you've manned a trap that long then you earned the payoff.
---
Also, the dude had literally years to figure out how to safely extract.
---
Well if you look at the guys kb, hasn’t used it since 2014, and I watched him log on today straight into Desmans POS in his log off spot :) I don’t know how long he was logged off in this spot, I doubt since 2014 considering the concord mods that didn’t exist back then.
---
&gt; dread
---

---
&gt;You do realize that normal carriers barley out-dps sub-caps these days.
---
&gt;*barley*
---
I disagree, frigates are outstanding ships - but the only reason they get recommended to new players is because they can be effectively fit for very cheap.  
---
Outside of that, frigates are something incredibly effective in the hands of someone who knows what they're doing - not a new guy. It's kind of like how everyone tells the newbro to run light tackle - it's a horrible idea.   
---
Frigate fights are with few exceptions over in less than 60 seconds, the vast majority of them in less than 30 seconds - this is assuming a frigate 1v1 that's relatively fairly matched which is not the norm.
---
That's a lot of time spent reshipping and looking for fights that last for a very short period of time.
---
For this guy without any isk or sp problems - cruisers is absolutely the way to go. Fit them tanky while he learns and his fights will often last for several minutes giving him lots of time to learn, and lots of footage to go back and re-watch. He will have time to make, recognize and correct mistakes within the fight. 
---
Whether or not he gets any kills in the cruiser is totally irrelevant in the beginning, it's all just about learning.
---
Oh so only a 4 year camp not a 5 year... whew I was worried there for a minute that they might be a bit too salty about the theft.
---
Looks like a gila.
---
Patience is a virtue...
---
There was not, this titan was stolen in 2014, I don’t know how long he was logged off in this spot, definitely not since 2914 as some of the concord mods didn’t exist back then.
---
Battlecruisers are too slow, too easy to get pinned down and get blobbed or dropped on relatively often.  
---
Don't get me wrong, they're great - but not a great starting point for a new bro learning solo.  
---
The only BC I think he should even think about using is a nano arty hurricane - and not until he has done a fair amount of learning.
---
oh boy, amigo necesitas un abrazo urgente. te lo mando a la distancia
---
Guessing he doesn't log back in again!
---
He could have just asked for some support tbh.
---
So the spot where he was logged off was bubbled for four years, he logged in, shot the bubbles and the bubble kill mails tipped the hunters off to its presence?
---
IMO he should have just sold the character in the Titan collected all the isk and made someone else’s problem lol
---
Thank you very much ^^ I certainly will ^^
---
Eh I’d wonder if it wasn’t more of a common theme elsewhere
---
There is a set of skills that will help you do that sooner or later, but there aren't really skill "builds" in Eve, just a planning path based on what you want to do first. You can eventually get everything -- your upward movement is fairly limited, so more skills usually translates to more versatility instead.
---
Anything and everything really. HAW dreads, Titans, Muninns. They're a bit of an experiment :)
---
From the top of my head, and that was 2 years ago, around 100 / 150m IPH

Whats the best way to convert PLEX to Isk? Simply sell to Jita buy order?

then buff t1 battleships  
---
afs need to be able to punch above their size, and a cruiser will still outbrawl it if it can properly establish control. ramjags may be a problem but there aren't any others that come close to its capabilities in that role.
---
I would have immediately logged back out lol. How hard would it be to get a gang to come clear space so you can log in and jump out
---
And in 3 years we'll laugh at 2 bil.
---
Lol maybe so but you're still responding to me so I'll enjoy it while I can. It could always be worse.
---
downvoted
---
Yeah. Some dual rep cruisers would be a good start. Teaches proper cap management. Then he can move into kitey things after.

One thing for sure happend in that fight. Someone was Constant repeating "Lagin, Lagin, Lagin"

https://i.imgur.com/3z5N9cD.png  
---
AND you would solo roam in them?
---
Present situation is that we all miss a lot of ihub fights all the time, even on weekends.  Lots of these objectives just fly under the radar.  The average player should be more likely to make it to at least some of the objectives more consistently.
---
For both offense and defense, I advocate socializing part of the PVP buffs and deferring them into the system &amp; constellation rewards etc.  Socialized rewards are partly an abuse prevention and partly a way to keep some carrot around.  If your side loses some heavy fighting over a plex and a lot of LP gets paid out because the PVP made the plex more valuable, you should be able to try to win some of that back by heavy fighting over the eventual system flip fights. 
---
As far as incentive to stay on offense:
---
* Whenever your personal rewards account is pretty full, you just look for the next timer fights for a chance to get paid more for your time / pew pew.
---
* If the event was part of an endgame (really edge-game) arc, the player decides what "wager" to make and has control over exposure to risk.  If they make no wager, they will still have a big rewards account they will want to try to cash out.  Waiting for the next one won't be as much of an option sometimes, so there should definitely be more timers spread out over a longer time.
---
On Defense:
---
* If large groups leave, their rewards LP becomes socialized and anyone who shows up to fill the gap or stays behind will receive higher payouts
---
* The wager mechanics should enable fresh blood to steal a large pile of rewards LP on day one, then pocket that LP more slowly by flipping the warzone, building up the competitive momentum.
---
* As the offense churns the endgame arcs to pay out their rewards accounts, they are slowly running out of carrot.  Eventually there isn't enough oomph, some LP gets stolen in a defeat, and hopefully we're back to level enough incentives that real competition is driving wins &amp; loses.
---
If there's not enough carrot at the edges, we add something similar to tier where you generate the most LP when at low tier but get paid the most out of your rewards at high tier.
---
**The wager mechanic is pretty critical to having excitement and instability at the edge cases.  The tick &amp; tock will have both successful and unsuccessful variants, corresponding to either the offense successfully pocketing their wagered rewards LP or the defense stealing the LP and depositing a lot of it into their own rewards accounts.**

or just scout it with a 2 day alpha and never risk the titan

I mean its not like test is 1 region away and could have helped him extract safely or anything. Well rip i guess. Nice kill
---
You miss all of the shots you don't take. Was a GF, hope to have more in USTZ.
---
Have to log in to transfer the character since you have to drop it from corp. Or have your CEO remove it from corp I guess.
---
&gt; like what will you learn from that, how to lock a target and click a button?
---
Basically, yeah. I realize that you hatched as a fully-formed Elite PVPer and never had to learn anything, but most people have to start someplace. It's generally good practice to recommend easy tasks for beginners.

same, simple and brilliant

I am an Technical Oracle Consultant so in my day to day job i work with Oracle and APEX and I know the power of apex :) so thats why.
---
Look at cruisers with insane sig tanking. Look for hulls with significant AB bonuses and then fit them with either active armor or shield tanks that least affect your sig radius.
---
This will teach you how to fly properly and maintain low transversal.

---
&gt; Citadels &amp; System Ownership
---
&gt; penalties fuel consumption if the enemy faction holds the system, requiring starbase charters as an extra fuel components.  
---
Personally I think requiring starbase charters across the board in anything other than null sec is a good countermeasure to Citadel proliferation, and in FW space requiring charters from the holding faction (and fluctuating as it changes) would be an interesting dynamic twist. However I think having "neutral" places in this space is a bit out of place. We have non-fw space low sec if they want low sec.
---
Also if we're still taking suggestions, what about offering another type of FW mission? Basically instead of going out and blitzing a few PvE targets you get orders to go plex a certain system by a certain amount? Such as "Go to system X and accrue 15 minutes on a large plex and flip at least one large plex for additional LP and isk"? Limit the amount of agents that offer these missions as a way to limit how many a single character can pull at a time. Even if people want to fleet up and blob it, there will be these "magnet" spots they'll be coming back to instead of just writing off a system, which could be a good way to gently nudge some fights to happen.
---
That is brilliant, but also really shouldn't be allowed. That's an instant decloak on everything within 70km or whatever the docking ring of a medium structure is.
---
yes, but they were the meta mods that got renamed in the database and flagged as faction.
---
&gt; Is that how brave got started? "We help new players" and six months later it was a blob.
---
So i suppose then that elite piloting skills would allow a Corvette to kill a battleship? No it doesn't only banding together into a larger group allowed that.
---
&gt;They know if almost every new player joins a corp, the established ones benefit. Thats why the narrative is so important to them and fake to the rest of us.
---
If you form your own corp with your friends you also joined a corp. That still follows the join a corp line but does not benefit the established groups. What now?
---
&gt;Why would you think I like getting blobbed when I am arguing against blobs? I guess I can expect such an incredibly retarded interpretation from a blobber.
---
As we've established 2 people getting together to fight someone else is blobbing so yeah i'm a blobber alright.
---
&gt;So now the argument is not about retention or helping new players, but actually about what benefits you.
---
I will be fine if no new players join me. I don't need them and helping them is actually a drain on my personal resources. But you know why i do it? Because the game as a whole is better when new players stick around and don't give up because the only people interested in interacting with them were interested because they could get more frags.
---
&gt;Thats big coming from someone arguing for more blobs.
---
Again 2 people banding together is blobbing so. Yeah i'm arguing for blobbing.
---
&gt;You think all those cancer camps and cyno baits didnt take their toll? Thats funny.
---
I don't run those. I don't think its a good idea to run those. But at the same time i have no power to stop it from happening.
---
&gt;If you didnt push people to blob, it wouldnt happen as much.
---
If anything people need to blob more and kill off all you fucksticks who think that multiboxing 10 alts is solo pvp.
---
&gt;Yes, blobs and null. So much empty space and dead game.
---
The space cannot be taken and occupied because soloists like yourself will dunk on them. Literally a single person cannot even take space unless they can be up at all times for like a week.
---
&gt;You want to replace pvpers who offer real content with farmers and whales in null.
---
No i don't. Please point out where i said that. Solo pvpers don't typically offer any kind of content anyway. They camp for hours with their dozen alts and turbodunk something and run away. And when you do manage to catch them or some of their chars they don't put up much of a fight because again, one dude operating many chars.
---

Dual prop medium ASB jaguar

And when you get bored of those, upgrade to kitey stuff. Omen navy issue, imperial navy slicer, retribution, brutix navy issue, Succubus and Phantasm are also pretty great kitey ships.
---
I had no idea Ozzy Osbourne played Eve!
---
His titans would have lance DD only, and titans with lances are massively OP in massed groups. If you bring n+1 of them there won't be anything left that can shoot back while you regen capacitor.
---
Yeah but putting out a can decloaks stuff that lands on an exact spot. Putting a structure out decloaks everything within 70km with no skill required.
---
&gt;  If CCP have not acknowledged it as a bug, it's fair game and clever use of game mechanics
---
Yes but I'd like CCP to acknowledge it as an exploit now that we've seen it because it essentially makes it impossible to cloak up and evade with any expensive ship (where the 600 mil for a Raitaru is worth it).
---
&gt;  a lot of anger being channeled his direction.
---
I definitely exaggerated for entertainment purposes, but I also aimed to make it clear that pro-mission farmer agendas were unacceptable.
---
For those left out of the loop, [I forced MD to kick me off the Discord referenced in the document over repeated instances of entertaining a pro-mission troll.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c22lno/the_betrayal_of_matthew_dust_promissions_csm/)  My honest opinion is that MD was trying to be too diplomatic to the point of naivete about how trolls work discussion politics.
---
I attempted to write a thread stating (falsely) that we had reached a peace agreement, but Reddit mods removed the post because they are also pro-mission mafia or something.
---
MAGA is the Jeffrey Epstein of LP &amp; mission farming.
---
  Ferrata did the trap, Ferrata got the Tackle, Ferrata did most of the DPS, rest of Stain came, just in case it was going to escalate.
---
  Good catch Ferrata.
---
Dual rep brutix is pretty fast and has a wide engagement range, it'll happily pick a fight with anything smaller than a battleship.
---
The Deimos does its job 4x better at 4x the price if it can be afforded though.
---
Are we sure that in game item expiration date is static?
---
As in are we sure it's not just "end of the month you transferred this from your redeeming queue"?
---
We'd need a dev to comment on that though.
---
Emergent gameplay baby.
---
Poor gameplay, but emergent nonetheless.
---
yeah, sounds shady AF. claiming to need cleanup to share is soooo strange. worst case its just messy.
---
You're gonna shred a whole lot of your own titans doing that since anybody not in the front of the ball is going to be hitting all the titans in front of them.  Plus you know at least two of them are going to fire the wrong direction.
---
The only real enemy is you.
---
Not Caps.
---
 You dont have that easy content to farm anymore, and you in turn have become risk adverse pvpers. Brawls don't happen, because a lot of pvpers are scared to lose ships(regardless of what they say), and be willing to put themselves in the crossfire for "gudfites". So, those players that you want to fight, and have content with have the same knowledge as you have had.. aka fits,isk... Additionally they didn't have to go through that same learning curve you did.  Now those new players have progressed, and are no longer the content you look for.
---
 You all who are calling for these terrible changes are the ones who streamed, and gave all the tools to the new players. Tools that they needed to learn eve more quickly than you, or I did. Instead of actually being that help in keeping a retention of players for CCP (since they didn't give a shit.) , and your fellow remaining players. You groomed all the noobs, thus what you created is now your own worst enemy, and changing caps will remove players from the game, not add, or retain them.
---
Also that Avatar that got blopsed in low sec by snuff might want to have a chat with you... Blops not used in low sec lol.
---
OH MAH GAAADDD!!! ... It's 2019 and a Titan died!
---
I'm not disagreeing with you that it's a good ship - but it's not a good ship for someone just getting started in pvp.   
---
People just hard blob BC's and you gotta know what you're doing to make the best of that situation (or avoid it in the first place) - a newbro doesn't know what they're doing.   
---
I think this would be a great place to go after having spent a few weeks in more slippery stuff.
---
i mean at least roll an alpha fly out and see if there's a trap setup
---
"go die in a fire ..." here is one of the whining little nerds I was referring to.
---
You'll just have them in groups of DD damage type, so you can custom-engineer the tank for each titan based on the new flavor of damage they'll take (instead of just omni-tanking them flat). 
---
Plus, you'll want to split your titans because your avatars are safer than any other titan when in proximity to the enemy avatars, but you want to try to put your leviathans in range of the enemy ragnaroks (but preferably outside your enemy's leviathan range). 
---
This new game of placing all your titan cynos would be interesting, but it would also be a royal pain in the ass.
---
&gt;And why would you wear sunglasses when it's kinda dark already?
---
Why would you ***not*** wear sunglasses?
---
A titan has not died in Stain in over 2 years :)
---
I'd say you're right as far as nullsec goes, but in lowsec it's pretty easy to play gate games and get away from most. it's definitely an easier thing to do in cruisers and frigates though, and more people are willing to engage those solo.
---
Tbh as bot riddled as FW can be, this one most likely isn't (I'm reasonably sure I have met people with alts in this corp).
---
Most of the serious FW players have deplexing alts they will afk in the background while doing other shit on mains. It's not really about the LP either, Vlillirier is an important Galmil system so to have the contested bar above 1% ever triggers the fuck out of the old guard.
---
It's pretty dumb, but it's pretty much a staple of trying to maintain warzone control because the FW mechanics are fucked #CCPleaseFixFW
---
Open charsheet. Skillque window. Apply unallocated skillpoints.
---
Guess you didnt read the initial post either, lmao
---
There is no way to police player interactions in game. To do so would definitely kill it. Goons have become massive because they offer something others do not. Wealth and security. With those they became the capital power they are. It brings me back to my stance on this penalty for becoming successful. It would have a greater negative effect than positive. I can't see it playing out any other way.
---
How dank would it be to quad-box titans? I was thinking about two titans for each anomaly.
---
A few shots, then boson, then wait like 30 seconds, another boson. Both were aligned and warp out.
---
That for two different havens, then after that period of time, both duo of titans are warp for the 3th and 4rd havens.
---
I'm the wh veteran from the group listed above; we don't have any girls, but we also don't have anyone with a neckbeard thick enough to play a female character, so it balances out.
---
Yeah for sure, but again the guy has to be comfortable with how the gate games and aggression work and all that stuff that you take for granted but that if you think way back to your beginning days of pvp you probably learned the hard way.   
---
I do really think BC's are a great step 2 though. I completely disagree with everyone here throwing out the "lose 50 frigates" mantra - they are just regurgitating a line they've heard a million times for newbros that have 685,000isk in their name.   
---
I think you're absolutely right to recommend tanky ass ships that will have much longer fights and thus longer for OP to spend managing a fight.
---
I don't quite understand this, would seem like an easily refutable concern. The users reddit user history is what leads me to believe their purpose.
---
We are buying Titans in Stain. Contact me in-game. :)
---
Yeah, well, you know, that's just like your opinion man.
---
in the 2016 cap changes meta cap guns were made into CONCORD and a new set of real meta guns were added. the fact he has plates fit is an indication he must have logged in and adjusted his fit at some point though.
---
Still looking to replace that levi from vyj man?
---
Undock. Right click on your ship/pod. Self destruct. Wait for 2 minutes.
---
I want to add since I think I misread your question.  I don't anticipate taking a week off is going to burn up a big deferred rewards account.  Decay should be over several months so that it's not as possible / easy / without cost to just switch your alts depending on warzone state.  At the intersection of bad behavior, alt switching &amp; farming, you have a big LP balance and play only very opportunistically.  If I had to write the math, the combination of being above median players in terms of LP balance and below median players in terms of activity would combine to burn off a lot of LP through socializing decay.  If you have modest LP balances and are somewhat active, you should be affected much less.
---
You also could have researched your route on zkillboard and noticed the glaring presence of the hunter groups killing cap after cap after fucking cap throughout the region.
---
Will people please stop handing these autistic fucks millions of isk on a silver platter, thanks kindly...
---
Alright, here are the setting that will help you.  But you have to make those profiles first and give each account its own.  Then make your UI changes and exit the game.   They will stay now.  I use completely different lay outs on each of my monitors.
---
Logos
---
Defenders: NaturalPhenomenon, Sleeper Dreams
---
Attackers: Wrong Hole., Opsec., Protostarr, Hazzard., Whiteout Initiative, The Mighty Beans, Singularity Syndicate, Singularity Expedition Services, WiNGSPAN Delivery Network, WiNGSPAN Delivery Services, Spatial Instability \[before they changed their alliance logo\], Forced Content, ACTIVATIONS, The Grey Eagles
---
Only use dotlan
---
I actually wound up getting lucky myself, I learned PVP from some pretty experienced people early on in my EVE career. Also studied up quite a bit after I got hooked! Having a good group around you definitely gives a kickstart.
---
And yeah, longer fights are more forgiving and the little changes have a larger impact. And IMO losing a bunch of frigates doesn't feel like you had any chance to fight at all, since the fights happen so fast. We're lucky we have a lot of skilled PVP'ers that are also content creators and just put this stuff up on youtube.
---
This is conditionally shit advice. Sure, you only learn by doing - but just whelping frigates against some faction frigate 1337PvPer with Vs, implants and boosters is... fruitless.
---
Way back, this advice nearly made me quit. Fitting and exploding 20 Kestrels dealing 20% to their shields.
---
@OP find some experienced people (like in a small corp, or FW militia) to fly with you. You'll learn a lot more, and spend a lot less time flying in a pod.
---
What happened to the other half?
---
Only if you do it in increments of 500 at a bit under market value, otherwise the people/bots that markethawk it will undercut you by .01 isk in seconds.
---
It means it's only attainable for a limited time yeah. The frostline events are usually run every winter but the rewards vary.
---
Pretty much. 
---
When hauling for a group you also get your pilots put on blue lists so that particular nullsec group isn't going to gank you in highsec :P 
---
which reminds me, use a scout and don't over-stretch on collateral. You're not supposed to put 100bn in one JF.
---
P dank
---
Omen navy might intimidate them, but the stabber is basically a giant destroyer so that would work.
---
Okay
---
I learned alot from that advice. Helped me imensly at pvp and to learn its just a game. U lose a ship u replace it. No biggy. Its meant to teach people to lose and not quit the game...
---
What wormhole are you guys basing out of? I have a small group of friends (similar to OP) who are trying to find our way/niche.
---
Ask everyone to train trig ships anyway.  You can get a lot of mileage out of Leshaks with that sort of player count.  Otherwise you can just stick to prophecies and cry when you find something bigger than a rattlesnake.
---
closing+reopening also recenters the map on the system you're in - kinda important for somebody like me that moves around a *lot*
---
I believe there are some settings in regards to particles and texture details/shadows, I'd crank those down.
---
Yeah. If you want to get into it, just setting up buy orders in mission hubs for around the average Jita buy for common meta modules is a good way to get started though.
---
My rule of thumb is you're going to make maybe 2-5% profit, so if you put 10m in you get maybe 500,000 out. You don't start seeing the big numbers until you have 4-5 billion tied up in the market and are consistently turning over your items.
---
Wouldn't you ask for assistance, before attempting a titan move?  Let alone an obviously risky one?
---
Also have said assistance clear the bubbles for you, which you scouted on an alt?
---
The procuror and Retriever mine maybe 10-15% better than an Endurance, so if you're mining solo there's no real reason not to use an endurance since it's cheap &amp; slippery with its warp core strength.
---
I don't get it. But thanks for updating me on when the new season is out at least lol
---
t2 fitted t1 battlecruisers and faction cruisers are most likely best isk/effectiviness ratio for higher sp player. You will still lose a lot of them but they are relatively cheap to lose with full insurance.
---
on the cheap end, remote rep praxis or dominix.
---
On the more expensive end, you could double up rattlesnakes with cap transfers to keep local reps stable, or run nestors.
---
&gt;So i suppose then that elite piloting skills would allow a Corvette to kill a battleship? No it doesn't only banding together into a larger group allowed that.
---
Not that far off given how underpowered they are.
---
&gt;If you form your own corp with your friends you also joined a corp. That still follows the join a corp line but does not benefit the established groups. What now?
---
My point is that if you push "join a corp", most players will join established corps.
---
&gt;As we've established 2 people getting together to fight someone else is blobbing so yeah i'm a blobber alright.
---
Maybe you forgot a zero or two?
---
&gt;I will be fine if no new players join me. I don't need them and helping them is actually a drain on my personal resources. But you know why i do it? Because the game as a whole is better when new players stick around and don't give up because the only people interested in interacting with them were interested because they could get more frags.
---
For at least a decade, the game has encouraged new players to join corps. The result is as you see it now - 4% retention, dead game, risk averse blobs, and/or farming online.
---
&gt;I don't run those. I don't think its a good idea to run those. But at the same time i have no power to stop it from happening.
---
You may or you may not, but the price to pay for too much of that is a dead game.
---
&gt;If anything people need to blob more and kill off all you fucksticks who think that multiboxing 10 alts is solo pvp.
---
Those guys will outblob you so it doesnt matter.
---
&gt;No i don't. Please point out where i said that. Solo pvpers don't typically offer any kind of content anyway. 
---
Many soloers have quit or stay away because almost everyone is tackle for a blob.
---
&gt;They camp for hours with their dozen alts and turbodunk something and run away. And when you do manage to catch them or some of their chars they don't put up much of a fight because again, one dude operating many chars.
---
They are not soloers.
---
The Loki and Proteus are the ones I recommend. Proteus can fit a pretty great tank and get significant dps, the Loki has its high base speed and web bonus to maintain range control and application very easily but I would say that requires a lot more skill than the Proteus' decloak and burn them down with 800 dps approach.
---
Could you explain what PI has to do with this? If not, I'd like to get my 6 minutes back.
---
Excellent, concise point, definitely adding to the conversation and enlightening those as to the genius machinations of your infallible mind.
---
Great post friend!

Has he looked across the forums? Usually if you pull something in the past people will make a forum post about it, and us CEO's check for those when recruiting.

low sec or null sec ?
---
The sacrilege, Ishtar and assault frigate gangs are all common solutions.
---
Either really. I was thinking about wormholing our way into null since that's what I'm used to doing, but I don't have anywhere near the numbers or DPS for this one vs that sort of stuff (bb)
---
You can still use it for PVE, I'd recommend a cap battery armor repping fit with tracking railguns instead of the 100mn shield fit instead though. It's going to be much less effective than it used to be but if that's your style, it's yours.
---
Is that expiration date for effect or for last opportunity to use the booster?
---
Sounds good! Thanks for all the info, it's honestly extremely helpful! Maybe i'll run into you one day (space is big though)!
---
Can you recommend another ship that I can still have zoomie shield tank drone fun?
---
watch jebi
---
The thing you do not get, that PLEX IS NOT A COMMODITY. 
---
You go with the expectations that a PLEX buyer (for $) has an intention to (A) use it for himself or (B) sell it, but losing the value of it again. Hence, your "drug" idea. The thing is, as soon as PLEX is sold on the ingame market, the VALUE OF THE PLEX IS USED in the perspective of the original buyer. (Why I took the DVD, the value is consumed after watching it once). Now RMT buys it from the market, and resells it for $, creating the same value (of selling it on the market) is created once more, which violates the monopoly of CCP, and therefore causes LESS PLEX created, as only CCP does create PLEX, but not the RMT guy.
---
Anyways I try another approach you might understand better what I mean.
---
Lets take: the market is fixed, and only a single PLEX which does not make the market move significantly is in play.
---
For the $-Plexbuyer, the intention is: selling the PLEX on the market for isk. Therefore, the overall transaction the $-Plexbuyer want is: $ -&gt; PLEX // PLEX -&gt; isk. Or in short: $ -&gt; isk
---
Now, the $-Plexbuyer has two choices. Either he buys from CCP or from RMT.
---
-Every transaction made with CCP creates an additional PLEX, that is sold on the ingame market.
---
-Every transaction with RMT is done buy PLEX that was just on the market a day before and converted back into isk. 
---
So even though, the transaction is ALWAYS **$ into ISK**, only the trade with CCP creates additional PLEX. Now, IF there was ZERO COMPETITION between the isk sale of CCP and the isk sale of RMT. Then there is no effect on overall PLEX sales from CCP, if RMT exists or not. However, since both are basically selling the same thing (in perspective of the buyer) that is highly unlikely
---
Likely planning to refit after move.
---
Yes, that is true.
---
There's tons of advice and pointers to give, it's just not easy to type it all out. From my own POV: Many folks stick to the head first approach but personally I'd suggest to find someone in that group who is willing and good at being your scout. Eyes and ears are super important because intel wins fights. A good scout is worth his weight in gold, he gets you kills and avoids losses.
---
That pilot needs to have initiative, be able to operate on his own, fast probe/dscan, tackler, backup FC, being able to read a hostile's ship/fleet capabilities, intent and strategies. Then spend time with said person to optimise and streamline the communication.
---
If you KNOW what you're getting yourself in to you have time to form a plan, adjust and explain it all to your fleet, and *then* make it happen.
---
&gt;Will people please stop handing these autistic fucks millions of isk on a silver loot platter, thanks kindly...
---
Trust me mate, no one was handing anyone millions of isk on this adventure. Well, unless you count the Oxygen Isotopes that dropped.
---
Something for that Prowler to do, I guess.
---
Or you know, they could disable combat refitting, or make fitting Triage Mod disable drones. Even if roles were fully split as different ships, they still gave FAX mega reps and tank.
---
If it doesn't hurt the nullsec powers then all the better. In my opinion what the blackout does is to create a bit of relief for hunters. They can better organize themselves before striking and aren't forced into often suicidal split-second decisions because the choice is getting nothing at all or getting titans dropped on you.
---
I don't want to see large blocks disappear over this. If they can stomach the change, then I'm happy. Large bloc-level fights are what got many players into this game in the first place. You seem to think people like me want to nerf your game to the point where I pose a real threat to you as an entity in nullsec, that's not the case. I don't think anyone thinks that capital blobs could possibly be nerfed to the point where they would feel comfortable with 20 titans jumping ontop of you, and even if that was possible then there would still be other options (bringing 20 times the numbers for example).
---
What I'm trying to say is: We're past the point of where there is a healthy relationship of danger between small groups and the largest blocks. This relationship will never come back, no matter what nerfs are introduced, if it ever existed in the first place is also questionable.
---
What the blackout does is opening up strategic options, and it puts coordination and creativity above having the reflexes of a cat.
---
Good advice...my crucifier guy loves doing scanning, I probably should just have him reship
---
Yup p much.
---
use a tanked occator
---
You are aware of the fact that they can just unanchor it again?
---
Oh, can you not unanchor a structure now?
---
i miss when you could leave comments on killmails.
---
Thank you for your feedback and perspective! I think I mainly want to focus on exploration, but don't want to count out covop combat since I have yet to experience each aspect the game has to offer. For now since i'm running on pennies I might stick to bare bones until I get a nice pile of ISK and more comfortable exploration. 
---
However, I think it will be a big achievement once I can - at no big cost - get an astero in my hands.
---
What do you think is something you wish someone would have told you when you first started out with exploration?
---
How much ISK did spend on bubbles over the past 4-5 years keeping that POS bubbled? And fueled?
---
Can it survive the blasts
---
feels bad maybe you should improve gameplay mechanics (read: skill yourself)
---
Join dog fort just ask cainun ))))
---
This is the perfect time to introduce the Covert Ops Drake!
---
T2 variant of Mael/Abba/Hype/Rokh with Covert Ops cloak and focused bomb launchers.
---
The thing is, a new player isn't going to train a specific hull. They're going to train a little of everything and see what they enjoy flying.
---
&gt;vital system information.
---
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security\_through\_obscurity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity)
---
A export from an Oracle database contains schema information so you all ready have a database user then amd further more for the api package to work i need to put my Oracle wallet information into the package something im also not willig to share due to security reasons. There is nothing fishy going on. Is Just that i dont want to share vital database information, like i said if you want the apex source code Just dm me and ill send it to you
---
It's the expiry for the item being in your redeem queue, it's completely separate from the booster expiry.
---
Well, that's true.  I think it's pretty unlikely though.  I'm sure they have spies that get all the pings.
---
Don't worry, I've already reserved a place 5km away from your local B274 wormhole. :)
---
Since 2014?  They fueled and defended that tower for FIVE YEARS to get a Titan kill?  I don't believe it.
---
Defended? You clearly don’t know Stain lmao.
---
Seems kind-of strange he didn't scout the spot first.  I would have.  Maybe he forgot where he logged it off.
---
Fair point.
---
We currently live in a pulsar C3 with a nullsec static. Most wormholes with a static null have a smaller hole so you can’t fit as many ships through the static so we opted for the larger max mass hole for better fleet variants. 
---
If you’re keen you can add me in discord and I can chat with you any time Dmitry Wizard#4827
---
Well no but if the defender of the ship respond than you've got an easy to structure on grid that's not got timers yet.
---
I didn't ask this. I just batted away that softball question because it seemed like one you'd pose to yourself and answer. Eerily weird you've chosen anyhow to answer this question I didn't ask in response to me. I cared about you spending 9 out of every 10 reddit posts shilling/advertising.
---
Something smells a lot like bullshit in here.
---
work a tech support line and wonder how people ever make it out of their house
---
That’s the problem. Shouldn’t have to use out of game map.
---
Make sure to have dotlan open with whatever area you wind up in - makes it easier to kinda step back and look at big picture. 
---
Also, when in doubt, just keep calling primaries. As long as everyone is shooting, they’ll be happier. If you’re gonna welp, find squish things with higher isk value and blap- if you guys smash stuff, then get wiped out, everyone’s still gonna have a good time
---
Remember to do your best to project that you have confidence and a plan.
---
For fucks sake don’t let people talk over you in comms, give yourself priority speaker. 
---
And most of all, don’t worry! Find things, shoot them, and die - you’re gonna do fine long as you find something to explode with.
---
&gt; My point is that if you push "join a corp", most players will join established corps.
---
So we should let them wither and die because they might not do exactly what you want them to?
---
&gt;Maybe you forgot a zero or two?
---
You did not contest my original claim that your projection of blobbing is more than 1 person coming to a fight. Define it then. Because i define a blob as more like 75-100 people not like 10-15 which is what i typically fly with and guess what? Ratters get dunked when that group catches them, does that make 10-15 people a blob? You tell me.
---
&gt;For at least a decade, the game has encouraged new players to join corps. The result is as you see it now - 4% retention, dead game, risk averse blobs, and/or farming online.
---
Correlation is not causation dumbass. 
---
&gt;You may or you may not, but the price to pay for too much of that is a dead game.
---
The game dying did not cause it. The fact that lots of people are grouped up for safety and bored as a result caused it.
---
This whole discussion has been had so many times, with so many good ideas presented (repeatedly), that it is impossible for me to believe that CCP has any interest in 'fixing' Faction Warfare - except maybe in the Veterinarian sense of that word.
---
Miss you guys, but not enough to give CCP my money (or time) again.
---
GL;HF
---
Thanks for the advice and encouragement :) I've got a scout and a region we want to visit now, even a couple of assault frigs! all that's really left is to wrangle cats!
---
Not sure why the /s is there. This is all true. They're boring risk free bullshit ships.
---
My respone was for the chain not directly for your post only. And i dont post alot of stuff on reddit thats True and if do its mosly for projects make. And the application May not be used by anyone but its something i made i am using and im just giving player the option to use it
---
For sure no burners for alphas. Just saying HS can be decently profitable.
---
Gila and Ishtar can both pull that off, Ishtar can do pretty much the same stuff as the old VNI.
---
I agree but a direct dump contains database user information wich makes the application less secure, so when the first stage is completely done i will export it and share the codem
---
Look up Makalu, especially the song Makalu cries song. He was the ragiest FC ever
---
Another idea would be go fuck with people in faction war. You’re probably less likely to get a super fleet dropped on you, and even if your just camping a plex, you’re less likely to get blobbed. Get yourself some confidence at calling targets and giving instructions that way. 
---
Anyways good luck have fun die in a fire.
---
Its Just apex
---
(what does that means?)
---
all this advice is some of the worst ive ever heard. dont listen to any of these people... jesus christ.
---
I am quite the fan of Tristans. Primarily due to the flexibility of the hull and that you can go blaster, kite, scram kite, or nets decently well.
---
Also Enyos are good if you just want to get fights and used to modules, but require a bit more training.
---
But at the end of the day try a bunch of things, and fly what you enjoy. Because you could be great in any ship type, but if you don’t enjoy flying it then what’s the point?
---
It sounds to me like you are trying to harvest user data. The alternative is that you built something reliant on your internal systems and haven't decoupled it yet which would make you a dumbass.
---
I am curious: how much you do, in average for every hour of gameplay, hauling shit?
---
Actaully, a better average. For every 10 hours of gameplay, how is your average income?
---
Heron can take it. 2 explosive shield rigs (so you can still use a scan rig), two armor and three shield explosive hardeners (which leaves room for mwd + data analyzer) can survive a wormhole ghost site of 12k damage.
---
Honestly I wouldn't even bother with ewar or logistics with a fleet that small. Just have everyone go kitchen sink in their favorite frigate and have fun. You will welp, lead your nerds to a glorious death(and double check everyone is in a blank clone) and have fun doing it.
---
If you do not welp and kill something, just keep going until you do welp.
---
Lol so much salt. Some of us did try to make it on our own. Some of us made it without ever joining the blobs. Guidance =/= becoming a drone though....
---
Of you have the source code you can run it to (if your running) the right software, like i said the source code will be released. And when you login you only give access to public information (wich everybody can access via esi) so if you Just use the mapper and do not Grant more access u cannot see anything you can see wich access you give when logging in via the sso
---
You could have responded to the person, seems stupid to try and shoe-horn like that. 
---
Imagine trying to explain-away that.
---
 I never asked for your reasoning to make the app, I don't care what you borrowed from existing apps either. I don't care if it feeds you one day or if any of the games you developed do; that's what you care about.
---
You re-posted this thread. Looks like you repost a lot of threads self-made games in an effort to advertise - never successfully. So if you're going to be an AD-bot essentially and only use reddit, never contribute then I'll happily ask questions.
---
I believe some made it entirely on their own. But i also believe that path is right only for a very few. And none of them are going to be going on forums and going "what do i do?" Probably because instead of doing that they are busy forging their own path.
---
And i never said that guiding new players means turning them into drones why do you people think that?
---
Never freeze while fcing fleet. Even bad calls are better than none.
---
Probably just waited for the alert about the POS being under attack. The POS would scram and start attacking the titan, titan shoots back, they get the attack notification and come running.
---
If you aren't doing anything nefarious then there is no reason to withhold the source code. Literally the one reason to not release it is because you are doing something nasty.
---
I specifically mention active tanked cruisers too, but I still think frigs/destroyers are very valuable to learn proper module management in the start
---
but hey, people can do whatever they want, most of the pvp'ers I see who got really good very quickly started out in certain ways, though
---
And to be completely clear, the booster only lasts 1 day 15 hours once consumed.
---
What a lies   what a dicks
---
Do bubbles expire?
---
Sounds like you are with the wrong group.  DO YOU LIKE WAFFLES?
---
&gt; So you are saying both of these somehow fit, with rigs:
---
no? are you illiterate or something?
---
&gt; AND you would solo roam in them?
---
i wouldn't solo roam in any battleship, that's irrelevant to the point being made here
---
&gt;full heavy neuts higs
---
&gt;roaming with large blasters
---
ok
---
&gt; Or do you plan to do nothing beyond 10km and have no prop mod?
---
its a brawling battleship, unless someone wants to engage you or you have him pinned down previously/mjd on top of him, a prop aint helping much. And even then you can just switch up the mids and put a prop there if you want, just dont be a retard and fit full heavy neuts on the higs. Also domis have these things called drones, that are their main damage source, they can go past 10km))
---
anyway this is pointless, you're being purposefully dumb at this point, ill just unfollow the conv v0v
---
Why would that be a bad idea, ghost capping plexes can't really happen if all the plexes are on the front line in those systems.
---
Can you explain why that wouldn't promote PvP?
---
Frigs and dessies are only ever recommended as a learning tool out of necessity due to idk and sp issues. 
---
When those problems go away there are absolutely no compelling reasons to learn on them.
---
There are however a long list of reasons to use them after the dude gets a little bit of experience in. I'm only saying that he can get that experience in a lot faster and move on to other things if his fights last 3 minutes instead of 18 seconds.
---
Also, all of the Imperium is eligible for Sig's and squads, so bastion, tnt, lawn, init, all of them can apply. Different groups might require a vouch, though, depending.
---
1. You do indeed.
---
2. We'll be around for sure.
---
Wrong event, read harder.
---
*join hole squad*
---
And you really want T2 weapons and T2 tank to properly fly an Assault Frigate, so you can probably add another 10 days for T2 weapons and maybe 5-10 days for the T2 tank. It depends what you fit on it.
---
Really, if 17 days feels long to you, I wish it was only 17 days until I can fly my next ship :P
---
Yes. In hind sight I should just recomend Bastion, only because Carnaros is without a doubt the nicest human being I have ever met.
---
mostly a meme but it exists for a reason, if you're happy in it i wouldn't worry about it but its mostly about the capacity of escalation in brawls and the behaviour of older c4 corps regarding it.
---
Endurance does not have warp core strength, only the Venture does.
---
Dual rep medium neut rupture is fun vs 2-3 frigs/dessies
---
Are you going to play as if you weren't a capsuleer? So every time your ship explodes (or only your capsule), you biomass?
---
For the record:
---
You made stuff up about me completely. I never made any pro mission proposal, I spent a lot of time hunting mission pilots.
---
I said specifically. Counter play needs to exist or there should be a replacement for them. Ie objectives that funnel both sides into an area to generate pvp.
---
As for being diplomatic, I want to hear everyone's opinion. Doesn't mean I agree with everyone's opinion. Doesn't mean I like the person or their opinion. Templar Dane made a great post about how broken missions are, and I've sent that stuff to csm members.
---
Yes - T1 bubbles after 48h, T2 after a week, faction after two weeks.
---
I understand your condens and im looking into a way to share the source code.
---
I can understand that pirates will be there, and they are welcome to attempt to farm.
---
But if you choose to chase a kite... Well... I don't know how to put it any more delicately than this: scissors paper rock.
---
Damps are my first idea for a counter, next would be booshing once you've swung the numbers and have a few snaked out fleet members.
---
(In all honesty, I've found ewar dissuaion to be a more effective tool.)
---
Making a front line will force farmers into the front line, placing them at the mercy of non consensual PvP (I would have thought) that to be the entire point.
---
If anyone could explain to me how forcing the farmers into the plexes on a front line wouldn't help a great deal, I await their logic.
---
Proteus can get the best dps if you can apply it... In practice, its blasters are more like water pistols unless you're ganking someone with pretty low hp (frigates and T1 industrials and such). There's a reason the Loki is used over it for everything pvp.
---
&gt;So we should let them wither and die because they might not do exactly what you want them to?
---
We havent established it would happen. Im also not the one pushing for anything. If they want to join a corp, they can, and the result is as you see it.
---
&gt;You did not contest my original claim that your projection of blobbing is more than 1 person coming to a fight. Define it then. Because i define a blob as more like 75-100 people not like 10-15 which is what i typically fly with and guess what? Ratters get dunked when that group catches them, does that make 10-15 people a blob? You tell me.
---
Why does it matter? if you bring three hg worms to fight a rifter, is that a blob? Technically not, but it makes no difference. 10-15 is a blob if going up against 1-2 players.
---
&gt;Correlation is not causation dumbass.
---
Unfalsifiable, and the result is accurate.
---
&gt;The game dying did not cause it. The fact that lots of people are grouped up for safety and bored as a result caused it.
---
No, they helped the game die. Most players joined corps, so there was no longer much to fight.
---
And this titan logged precisely near the pos anchor point of a moon?
---
10mn ab confessor with beams. Other would be a kiki.
---
The problem with overprop is really the time it takes you to get to speed. Ie, within 1 cycle of a normal prop, you can usually reach 75-90% of your max speed. With overprop, it takes more like 3 full cycles, so it can take a long time before you actually reach the speed that you want.
---
A newbros place (and best chance at retention) is in a fleet surrounded by friendlies.
---
The data on player rentntion indicates that a newbro soloing in Eve is already headed for biomass.
---
Would you agreed that in any circumstance, that newbro is better off not playing solo?
---
Well it's 4 times the price and 50 days worth of training but at least it's something. Thank you.
---
I dunno. Use the math everyday as a structural steel designer and detailer (make shop drawings from engineering drawings) without a high school diploma for the last 30 years.
---
Because blobs + cancer. The game is dying because players are useless individually. There is too much blob-dependency.
---
Shoot mtu's
---
Sorry if I offended. Just wanted to be clear that's what we meant about guidance. You're right I received a lot of guidance from people who saw me trying my best to learn, and friends I made along the way. I much prefer this to any kind of hand-holding and passing out fotm.
---
It just means that the enemy faction had to grind  through the systems in a set order to gain full control, it would merely force farmers into the systems where PvP is present.
---
Wouldn't that be nice?
---
&gt; Think of flying a perfect Circle around a static object. The turrets don't have to track at all, they can remain static.
---
This is [wrong](http://i.imgur.com/3Z3SJke.jpg).
---
&gt; I spent a lot of time hunting mission pilots.
---
Were you finding yourself?  Killmails or it didn't happen.
---
&gt; As for being diplomatic, I want to hear everyone's opinion.
---
So you let a troll who wanted to throw poo at everyone's opinion run amok.  Where is he now?   **What did he ever propose on that Discord beside the most heavily downvoted proposal?**  What did he offer other than giving you 200bn ISK to pull in some lowsec CSM votes, run a dog &amp; pony show, and then bury the results?
---
Accurately accuse me of making up facts about you whenever it's convenient?  Fine.  Defend the way you defended a shameless anti-principle mission predator and then say it was on principle?  Not fine!
---
And the downvotes lmao. Typical
---
Cloaky proteus with a scram/web and shiny AB can maintain range control on most targets, and cloaky wise you get the best DPS from going for drones.
---
The loki has a lot more flexibility in what it can engage from its web bonus for sure though.
---
Aye, unfortunately it's a necessary change. It's unfortunate this kinda kills some peoples playstyle but it should help the game overall.
---
The VNI is a pvp beast now though.
---
serve Sansha Kuvakei
---
You are correct, my bad. I guess that cloak bonus is enough though.
---
an atron. literally.
---
Blobs are the lifeblood of Eve.
---
Can you realistically expect fleets, large corps, alliances and coalitions to disband in response to your position?
---
The point of Eve is that it encourages groups to band together to overcome complex objectives that would not be possible alone.
---
Through this experience, retention of the playerbase is made possible.
---
It would be a pretty damn boring game if everyone beloved they should go it alone... Ironically, THAT would cause the game to die much more quickly.
---
GF &lt;o
---
tiny depends on the system contested level
---
that's what I thought too, then the guy I made kill right public on, lost a 2 bil DST.
---
YES
---
I took 6 months off eve but before I did that I put my 56b liquid isk into plex. Came back and made a bit of money
---
I would advise going to low for a gang like that to be honest. While you aren't big enough of a gang to get groups to form on an alliance level and quick enough to avoid caps dropping on you 0.0 is not rich with targets for you (mainly subcap ratting ships) as the krabs are docked up due to the blackout.
---
Would someone mind explaining the story here, my wormhole politics are super out of date.
---
otoh, it's mindnumbingly boring to do any other way than completely afk.
---
In what way could a battle pass be implementet in the game?
---
It would be a nice replacement to Skill injectors if it provided bonus SP, Cerebral boosts, Skins and other stuff
---
I think pretty much every explorer has died to a lowsec ghost site at some point.
---
Ty!!
---
If that is the system he cares about...
---
I don’t even think TEST lived near that region in 2014...
---
They are in a cheapfit t1 explorer frigate or something with targeted explosive tank that can survive the explosion. There's some really nice drops from ghost sites.
---
I would just remove that mechanic entirely and have plexes passively count down for the defending side at a slow rate, like uncontested sov nodes.
---
Frankly, RR was the worst mechanic every introduced into EvE.  Remove remote repair at all levels of the game, and then we'd have attrition in every battle.  That in itself would help solve the big-toy problems of EvE, because even when fighting a fleet of titans, you can cause some serious economic damage with cheep gankfleets.
---
I dunno the stain alliances seem to forget how to work together pretty often, so much so that no real stain russian alliances hold space in the south anymore.
---
So to hunt on a casual roam, you want us to build a keepstar in Delve and move our titan fleet into it? :D
---
You're right of course but eve players seem to always want the worst possible thing.
---
No... Depends on your biology skill... My standard one lasted 43h20
---
Whoever they are, [when the Titan went into Stain, they weren’t with TEST](https://evewho.com/pilot/Kassera). 
---
So really...it a [Barrel Roll Squad](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/corp/Barrel_Roll_Squad) Erebus that died.
---
I thought I was done with Eve 18 months ago.  Extracted out 7 accounts and put it all into PLEX.  At the time, it was easily 200B.  Scared to log back in and see how much it is now in the fear I'll be pulled back in.
---
Ah, the ever expanding blue donut
---
Judging by the fit, the story is completely fabricated. I live near these dudes and they will do anything for attention at the expense of TEST.
---
Was it stolen from Good Sax?
---
Was a lot of fun though!
---
He joined XAOS. You’d think he’d know he can tell those guys....
---
It was not, it was stolen from one of the Russian Alliances
---
Shhh
---
FERRA is shit at tackling. They dropped on my Domi earlier. Seems like when they forgot to bring a TCU when they managed to kill one in Eso, they also forgot a tackle when they dropped on me.
---
Perfect
---
I live next door. They aren’t scary at all. Just annoying like a mosquito.
---
I think handholding is terrible. And spoon feeding people leads to fat lazy people. I don't think handouts are a bad thing, it can help people get over the fear of loss (drive it like you stole it eh?)
---
That said i didn't get a lot of guidance from brave until i joined spoopy. Just a lot of screaming and yelling. But i would still reccomend people join BNI. Because they don't have harsh requirements for you. They provide you with space to learn and grow. And because there is an expectation that eventually you will outgrow it and move on.
---
Carebear, only one c, the mans just misspelled. Refers to higher nibbas who like things safe, essentially. Nullbear refers to those who live in nullsec under a supercapital umbrella, which was even safer than highsec until recent events made it easier for hunters.
---
Stunt Flores.  I've been away from the game for a bit.
---
lmao. What is this?
---
So in other words, Ferra...who is Russian...shot a Russian Titan.
---
Yeah but it dying in a fun way.  And I could bring my drake.
---
"Local looks clear..."
---
As the other comment said you will probably kill more stuff in low sec. Nullsec always has more spodbrains tho so keep that in mind when your gang gets more experienced. Also a good scout is absolutely essential in null.
---
I want to hear everyone's opinion, as for what else did he propose, check the vote section.
---
I've switched sides and noted by my low rank have not participated in fw missions at all, and noted by my recent kills have been focused on pvp and fighting. 
---
But when I did hunt mission runners:
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/77280215/
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/77280817/
---
And then I got notifications on eve saying: recon pilot -10 and was called "you are number one squatter." because I waited in a mission 45 minutes to kill them.
---
I'd have more if they didn't warp out the second i came in system amd jackdaws and bombers weren't a thing and if I wanted to keep spending 45 minutes inside their mission tanking rats in a recon instead of pushing the warzone.
---
I defended your arguements, unbanned you when you were rightfully banned, and you still sling mud on my name and make up stuff.
---
Stop.
---
You don't need to be the newest order on high volume items.
---
Also, selling further down than .01 below only hurts everyone it doesn't sell your ite
---
Wait. The solution to those sites are to tank ? I thought there was some technique to disable the bombs.
---
Can confirm. Headed out with a bad scout and it went horribly. No content found and fleet died with no kills.
---
Mostly for the first few weeks you won't really butt against the limitations anyway.
---
But did they have a decay timer in 2014? Honestly don’t remember when the decay timer was put out.
---
Given that his comment got its own thread, I think its safe to say we’re revved up all right.
---
Well, you have all prerequisites for Cloaking done from character creation, but yeah
---
Gpu particles I think
---
Does r/shitrevesays exist? Because it should.
---
Erm, it IS Volta who is bitching about the rest of us doing high sec things, or can you not read?
---
Good prices are rising again after the resent sale.  Means my stock pile will be worth more.
---
Can we have hardcore battle Royale server?
---
Then do it again, and again, and again
---
Yes, be really good at hacking, don't fail a hack and be quick enough before the timer runs out.
---
Personally I run them in a stratios. Cargo scan the best cans and go from there. Typically I'll get 2-3 cans before warping out or it blows.
---
fuck tapi
---
I agree completely, but there are only three sub capitals in the game that have any ab bonus at all. You are describing a phantasm.

Quoting Trenz007 from [Big oof on sleeperdreams](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bhigio/big_oof_on_sleeperdreams/)
---
&gt; General BR: Sleeper Dreams put up an Athanor in Protostarr of Wrong Hole. Alliance's home. They also burned down the shields on all the structures in system. Through out the day Wrong Hole pulled in a fleet to defend Protostarr's home.
---
&gt; At the time, the suspicion was eviction as Sleeper had RF'd structures in their home a couple weeks ago, as well.
---
&gt; Wrong Hole managed to get in a fleet of 78 through out the day with a constant back and forth of fighting for control of the hole with just a few people, with Wrong Hole's forces building up.
---
&gt; The anchor timer for the Athanor rolled around and Sleeper logged in with less pilots than they originally started with. Regardless, they took the fight.
---
&gt; The fight lasted about 25 minutes off the Athanor. Both fleets got hit with booshes and both managed to recover from it. In the end, Wrong Hole was overwhelming the field and Sleeper Dreams evacuated through the static C3. Wrong Hole &amp; friends finished killing the Athanor.
---
&gt; All in all it was an awesome fight.
---
https://br.inyour.space/?s=1001744&amp;b=8581200&amp;e=90&amp;t=bvvb
---
It was an epic fight, had to immortalize it with a meme video.
---
Quite literally 😃. I'm caught
---
There is a reason why you have 3 slots for characters on your account.
---
I suppose it's possible, but there was a 3-4 day turn around on getting invited in and then he was in the Corp for two weeks. I'll ask him.
---
25000 plate didn't exist in 2014
---
Just saying
---
Thanks buddy. You should read the comments next time, because that’s clearly been stated multiple times, and no one said it did exist.
---
Having done both, what people here are saying is pretty spot on. BFL routes are more challenging and pay better. Bloc logistics you can pretty much set up your route and zoom back and forth. Market pvp in staging systems / bringing in doctrine fits and contracting them at a reasonable markup can offset the lower payout however. I personally still enjoy BFL more though. :)
---
It's actually not a subjective question at all.  
---
It's also not a question that gets asked often. Most people who ask this question have a big isk and sp problem - OP has neither, making the answer to his question entirely different than it usually would be. 
---
Nevertheless most people are just throwing out the same answer of "t1 frigates and dessies" as if they were actually good learning platforms.
---
Could also treat them like probes in a way. Have them despawn when you dock/jump, preventing too much drain on the server.
---
Try /r/evetech, it's more suited to questions like this.  From memory one of the tables has a 'marketable' field or similar.
---
Clearly you just hate the Russians. The fit is trash. The story is real. Keep getting farmed.
---
Blackout strikes again!
---

Pretty much this.

Haha hauling his rorq shitfit. If you hadn't dunked him we'd have had a much bigger km in a few days.
---
Sometimes i have multiple browsers open with multiple pathfinders that cause glitches for me
---
How about the larger the cyno ship, the bigger the beacon, and the further it can be lovked onto for a jump?
---
The real King of the South?
---
Swear on the name of Julianus Soter that you will dedicate your life to destruction of all L4 mission runners &amp; their perverted stacks of trafficked LP and all may be forgiven
---
You must have missed the age of nano Canes &amp; Drakes... That was some of my favorite PVP in this game.. I miss those days.. I used to run either a solo Cane with a scout or dual boxed 2 Drakes one with a cloak so I could just do the MWD/Cloak/insta warp and scout with it..(in low sec of course)
---
I picked a gate fight in a blackbird the other day, forgetting jams dont keep the other ship from shooting you. Still a less questionable than this kill.
---
Except the fit is newer than 2014.
---
On a shoestring budget you'll be fine sticking to the t1 exploration frigates. I would recommend not taking super long trips since an explorer without a cloak is a MASSIVE target for people hunting explorers. This said, I would also recommend getting out into Null-Sec as soon as you feel comfortable with the basics, have high enough archaeology/hacking to open cans reliably, and you have a bit of a cushion to buy a few replacement ships. 
---
Stain is easily the most profitable area to do exploration sites, but it is right in the middle of two large and active alliances and because of the lucrative exploration sites there are a lot of people prowling in the area. A t1 exploration frigate will most likely get eaten alive. Instead, I recommend finding somewhere in null that is less active to hop around in and get used to not having local-chat letting you know who is in system. Ideally you want somewhere in NPC space, regions where players can't hold sovereignty over space. There are NPC stations where you can dock up and stash your loot in these regions, and this makes it easier to avoid walking around with a loaded cargohold. 
---
The sites out in null are much more lucrative, you can likely expect to make enough to replace your ship almost every can you open up since your frigate is so cheap. You will also likely lose a lot while doing this, but you will learn a lot in the process. :)
---
Something I wish I had been told is that wormholes are worth checking out. My buddy that got me into the game is terrified of them and always tried to steer me away from them, but they can be extremely helpful! If you are way out in Null-Sec and want to bring your loot into market, waltzing through lowsec is likely to get you killed with all your cargo since people frequently camp systems that connect lowsec and Null-Sec. Wormholes can be great for bypassing this however, the simplest way being if you find a nullsec-high/lowsec Wormhole. If you find one of these, you can bookmark it and bring all your loot through after grabbing it from the station you were stashing it in, after making sure the route to the hole from the station is safe.
---
If you want some fun, you could also poke around inside a wormhole that leads out to J-Space, the proper wormhole systems. It's dangerous, but Null-Sec exploration sites can spawn in these systems and with a bit of luck and know-how you can use wormholes to get all over space. I *definitely* recommend doing this after getting all your basics pretty solid though, since wormholes are just one misstep from being lost on the other side of the Galaxy. (Though that's the fun of exploring them)
---
Basically, my best advice is to play dangerously since the payoff from exploration is so nice in Null that you can lose a whole bunch of the cheap ships you are currently flying for every time you make a successful run. There is a lot to learn, so might as well get the hard lessons out of the way early when they don't hurt that badly and get to see some cool stuff along the way. If you wanted risk-free money you'd be mining, so might as well live on the edge. :D
---
So if I am reading this right, NC. Comes in, does very little and lost more that Horde who were 1st into the battle?
---
Thanks buddy for the 10th time that has been said. Never said the fit was 2014. Actually in my response THREE HOURS AGO I said that I am not sure how long he has been logged off in this spot,
---
All you need for this is the invTypes table, there is a column called marketGroupID. If there is a value in marketGroupID then this item is also listed on the market. All you have to do is select all items where marketGroupID is not NULL:
---
SELECT * FROM `invtypes` WHERE `marketGroupID` IS NOT NULL
---
3 years since capital plates were brought in when we got FAXes.. 2016.
---
too much effort to set a specific expiry date for each new accelerator they release, just slap on a 6month / 1yr expiry date on that baby and let it roll...
---
You are hilarious my guy
---
Easy to say when 70% of Stain don't care you exist.
---
invMarketGroups defines just market group nodes, items are stored in invtypes - and each row in there has "published" flag and can be assigned to market group.
---
No market group or not published = not marketable.
---
&gt; Actually in my response THREE HOURS AGO
---
Do you always read every comment by the OP in a reddit post before you comment?
---
Man you are like turbo special, you are to L33t for them i guess.
---
More like 6, 3 of the T3s get AB bonuses through subsystems :)
---
Not very new player friendly, imo. I have an alt  but a new player shouldn't feel obligated to start multiple characters from the get go v0v
---
Sure, I haven't flown these myself - and I wouldn't recommend them for normal play over any of the meta fits except as a trainer for someone who has isk and sp - they are \*entirely\* focused on letting OP explore eve, get long engagements, gtfo when necessary and manage an active tank, transversal and cap  - while keeping it very easy to do so, as the phant is a great sig tanker and the fits don't have to have cap to tank so he's not totally insta-boned if he makes one or 9 mistakes.   
---
If he manages to snag a few kills in them, that's nice - but not at all the point of the fits.

Tapi are big gays lmao
---
To be fair, many Lowsec natives have terrible standings/sec status regardless of FW involvement. Yarrr.
---
On the other side of the table: loss of corp standing for killing faction members, irrespective of who aggressed first, is also a dumb mechanic that is penalizing to legitimate gameplay.
---
If you didn't know, killing an NPC corp member results in a huge standing hit. I remember grinding standing for a corp when one of its members attacked me--I killed it, but was instantly put at -1.1 with that corp.

They set up the POS in December 2018, (when the Erebus logged off in the True Sansha Faction tower there), and destroyed it, put up their own, and bubble-fucked the area.

This was not a five year hunt. It was a group that happened to move into an area a couple months ago who saw a Titan log off there and put up a POS since they were living in that area of space anyways.

I can barely remember the last time I had this much fun in lowsec. See ya next time, Snuffles!

Hands down the best, though I do remember some choice gems from being in PGL fleets during the s2n days
---
1. I would fit MWD instead of AB. AB makes sense in a solo FW setting because every solo ship needs some level of range control and in FW fights often start in scram range. But in a fleet setting, it matters less if one or two ships get scrammed because the remaining ships in the fleet will still have their MWDs available; the fleet as a whole still has the ability to control range. In such a setting having MWDs will help you catch targets, be flexible with scouts (everyone with an MWD and tackle can be a viable scout), and deal with kiters if you're in a brawling lineup like yours.
---
2. Get some webs in your fleet. Actually, get a lot of webs. They'll help you keep things on grid, they'll help you apply damage. I know there is such a thing as a hydra fleet concept where your DPS ships bring a variety of ewar, but that was designed for much larger compositions. In a 5-7 man brawling gang you want basically all of your DPS ships to have a web if possible. Let the ships with bonuses to ewar deal with that part of the job.
---
3. While we're on the subject of ewar: for a fleet of 5-7 I'd say stick to at most 1 ewar ship, if any at all. Having more DPS/tackle ships will let you engage more things.
---
4. Strongly consider bringing a single T1 logi frigate. Logistics is a drastic force multiplier, more so than ewar would be in such a small fleet setting. If it was me running the fleet I'd either go full DPS ships, or drop the ewar and bring 1 logi, provided of course that I had a capable solo logi pilot (I realize you might not have that luxury). Remember, it's not about total DPS - it's about how long you can sustain it over time, and logi is there to prolong the time you can keep your DPS on field. A solo logi can be the difference between whether your 5-7 man fleet can take on cruisers or not. 6 frigates and a T1 logi can certainly bring down an RLML Caracal. In lowsec, T1 logi also gives you the ability to fight near gates and stations without worrying too much about gate guns. Besides, logi is an incredibly useful skill for a pilot to learn - every PvP group wants all the logibros it can get.
---
5. Be bold! When it's your first time in command, it's easy to be overcautious because suddenly it's not just your own ship that you're risking. You're in T1 frigates for a reason - it's not a huge deal if they die, and believe me when I say that your fleetmates will not judge you harshly if you welp. You'll have a better time if you don't second-guess yourself too much and go after some bigger targets.

6. As FC, it's more important for you to focus on target calling and situational awareness than to perform as an individual pilot. Don't worry too much about pressing all the buttons and getting maximum DPS on your primary. If you have time between calling targets then you can try to optimize the damage you're contributing. Your fleet depends significantly more on your command than on your piloting.

Oh good point! I didn't think about t3c's.
---
Aye this is true, but at least there is a mechanic to buy back sec status. Albeit, may be expensive for a noob, it's been awhile since I bought tags.
---
Impressive Tapi feed
---
No, the change was implemented about 1-2 years ago
---
Good luck! Feel free to pipe up in this thread with any questions, it's always here.

We mostly kept forgetting to log back in over last decade or so. 
---
You can  cooperate all you want, but if it still adds up to 50-80 people there are limits to what you can achieve. As our last war over Esoteria showed. Hell, even that was at least twice our numbers from what it was for the previous 2 or 3 years.

or cause the worst thing..

Had it been parked there for more then THREE HOURS?
---
Maybe next time do your homework before posting so you don't have to correct your op in a comment.
---
Whining? Man. Oh man. You posted the thread bubba cry more. Someone cares, I'm sure.
---
It was a very enjoyable war. Dozens of us got to log back in for the last few times before finally winning EVE, so I don't really mind. And I think it was a decent last hurrah given our numbers.
---
Never corrected my op, I never claimed in my post that the fit was from 2014. I clear stated the titan was stolen in 2014, he logged off in 4GQ, and when he logged back on he was killed. I have no idea how long he was logged off in 4GQ, sometime after the change in 2016.

Stuka fleet, WWII helmets on pilots, not goku anime face paint

Sure, as long as you're putting down a relatively small amount of cash and are having fun, go for it. If you're plan is to plunk down $100s on skill injectors and bling ships though, you might be disappointed. PVP is mostly a game of cat and mouse. If you're selling PLEX, you get to throw ships into combat and die some and it's no big deal. If not, you'll probably have to be the mouse and farm while other people try to kill you.

Would love to see mines that only target caps. +1.

You are seriously delusional. Ofc the suggestion to remove pvp from plexes was going to be the most down voted one it was expected. I only submitted that to show the absurdness in all suggestions basically removing missions from fw.
---
You need to accept that different people.play eve differently and there is no right or wrong way to play eve. Pushing a bunch of suggestions without also consulting the farmers who are a major part of fw even if you like it or not is stupid. Everyone should have their voices heard.
---
Also the way you post is cringe and full of lies please stop.

There was an episode of Talking in Stations a few months ago about hauling with some PushX guys iirc. It was pretty interesting and they discuss potential income.
---
Panfam and I have a bit of a rocky history.

So T3 manufacturing in otherwords.
