These are amazing!!!! I think a fun and challenging group of ships for him to try could be the Sisters of Eve ships. The Nestor, Stratios, and Aestor.

---
This isn't even a shitpost. It's just a shit post.
---
Yeah I appreciate you were responding to an incendiary comment but your reply sounded like you were complaining about being blobbed.
---

---
I appreciate sometimes being blobbed is a legitimate defence but it doesn’t really work if you’re the attacking party since you always have the option to disengage.
---
We know it's a troll. It's just a really, really bad one.
---
HyperNet auctions seem like a pretty good way to liquidate high value items.
---
This actually is for real in hisec Perimeter. :)
---
dont forget the turrets!
---
I would prefer it if you just stayed away and won eve that way dude. :P
---
Does it really matter if the market crashes if your selling them?
---
Quafe tshirts, right? 2013 and 2014
---
When I get some money I will lol. Holidays aren't kind to my bank account
---
I have so many I couldn't sell them fast enough before completely crashing the market.
---
they were outnumbered on that side thought. We came in on the other side and gave you a good spanking before too many other fleets came to your aid. Such a shame, I was hoping to finish the job of wiping out Pandemic Horde's Eagle fleet from the field. Oh well, next time...
---
Same old thing. Mortys killing Mortys
---
Duuuude, I left it ambiguous on purpose. Staahp.
---
The thing is, your never going to be able to sell them without doing that.   So decide what your bottom price is and sell them until they hit that.
---
Or.. heat the faction scram.
---
The problem with the hyper relay is people immediately sell the item after they win it. They'll sell it and crash the price.
---
Don't talk BS dude. The numbers for THIS fight were EVEN on the field across the board. Pandalorica was correct in stating that on the side they came in at, they were outnumbered. There's no way you can turn this fact into the fallacy bs you're spouting. You're sounding really dumb right now. Quit whilst you're ahead.
---
Sure they do.
---
What would "crashing the market" look like?  How many of these get moved in a day?  If you put all of them up for a total of 40b, would they sell before the other two players jump in?
---
CCP are wormholersbtw
---
Let me make this clear. We have a hate boner for PanFam and the fight gives us the excuse to kill them. Unfortunately they'll just dock up, so with TEST coming to their aid, it kind of evens the fight and gives NC. docked a reason to undock and not be scared by Goons. TEST are actually really good on the battlefield so when fighting them it's like going up against PL from the olden days. They know how to do big fleet fights and when they turned on us last night we got a little surprised and bugged out. We had orders not to shoot TEST unless they shot at us first and they did. So with that said, I guess we'll be shooting back next time.
---
Right click on it in space and click Add XXX to overview
---
Rofl
---
yeah, but then you probably don't warp in to some anom at exactly 3minutes 30 seconds after every neutral left local.
---
deklein/branch is like 80% bots right now, but at least ccp got faster banning them tho
---
2.01
---
accurate
---
Ok. So this will permanently show the enemy ships? Will I need to do this every time?
---
taxes from bots absolutely should be retroactively removed from corp wallets
---
TIL people spend money on wearables? Wait is that a thing? Of all the things people spend money for on this game, that's one of them?
---
Nope it'll be permanent

I mean ffs the top level comment is a wh "pvper" that wants to make rorquals in kspace easier to kill and make less money.
---
So its kinda hypocritical that people are saying i don't know what's involved in wh sites. (Which isn't even true)
---
just wait till you hear one of Sappo's rants
---
That Nestor looks amazing
---
And if you decide to split away from your 700 friends, and take your 70 man fleet off on its own, and it gets outnumbered and dies, that means you're a moron and need to plan better, not that your enemies are dirty blobbers
---
It's a good change imo. Hope it stays
---
2 camels and my least favourite cousin

Drunk sappo comms good times.

Hold up now, you can't expect people to employ advanced tactics like moving.

Best moment was when we left system with ONE FUCKING DICTOR.

PGL realized that too. Fixed in a while.

You are pretty trash if this change destroyed all blops play tbh. Use a faction/abyssal point...or just get better tackle before cyno'ing

Lol except its not a contradiction and you deleted half of the sentence??? Whut
---
Ehhh, 3 dreads and 6 rorqs are about the same amount of effort. Esp now that you have to bounce rocks twice as often. 2 carriers ratting is more apm than 3 dreads in 1 wh site.
---
Lol if you arent completely fucking retarded dread rating is almost 0 risk and even then you are risking less isk unless you are a dumbfuck and blinged the shit out of your ratting dread.
---
Yeah reduced rolling statics reduces the risk of dying from 1% to .1% but it would also fuck over your ability to farm the statics. 
---
K space is way more dangerous than w space lol.
---
is this Jita 4/4 local, just checking?
---
The main reason is that they need to made deals with someone or another to relocate to a better part of Null (and therefore, provide more of a reason for members to try out Null). While they already have a close quasi-official relationship with a large corp in a major alliance, I'd prefer that they not officially become a feeder corp for TGRAD/INIT.
---
Making the NSC part of ProviBloc would give people the opportunity to live in an actually desirable part of Null, with more opportunities for good mining, good exploration, and things like that. Therefore, more people would move out there. And if they want to experience a compentently-run fleet, ProviBloc still has some FCs who know what they're doing (E-Uni seems lacking in that regard), they just don't have people who will undock for it (which E-Uni does have). It's not like they'd be able to hold onto sov or even be able to hold moons in better NPC space if anyone at all wanted those.
---
Affiliating the NSC with ProviBloc would give them those things. There are certainly some reasons why I'd never want to be part of ProviBloc, but for a corp that wants to be neutral and can't hold onto anyone who is both capable of running good PVP and willing to fight to hold their space, Provi is probably the closest thing to a neutral part of Null that isn't terrible.
---
It would also give people who roam Provi for content more residents to shoot at.
---
I was having these in 2009. Did you logoff? They could be bumping you
---
It just takes a few smartbombs to start that shit and the late guys couldnt activate their smartbombs. The "smart" ones that preheated theirs couldnt turn off their heat and burned the smartbombs out and a good few guys couldnt inject any cap and ran dry. Logis wont be able to do much anyway if 200 fleet members get damage at the same time.
---
I know I did not manage heat well. But I was a bit confused at why my heat icon were no longer green but my mods continued to burn up. I did not know how to turn off heat to my mid slots and panicked.
---
A percentage will. I can’t remember off the top of my head if it’s 10% or 20%
---
It is not the players job to inforce CCPs rules.
---
No, the decrypter you use is what decides the ME/TE levels. Unless you have a t2 bpo  which is why t2 bpo holders have a little higher margins
---
I deleted my long reply on accident and honestly don't care about arguing with a moron on reddit so im done congrats you outlasted me with the pure power of your stupidity
---
Whs good, rorqs bad
---
I mean, they do hide behind a wall of bubbles and most people have access to Horde comms to hear people being dumb (granted, better than Goons)...

&gt;No incentive to compete - no fights - no fun in bigger plane

Lol.  What a low effort post man.  Just let someone else write the story for you.
---
Nice job man!
---
Yes... Prepare to become a nolifer ... start your account
---
Not sure if they sell at the price you are thinking. I got those thru a buy order for a couple mil each.
---
How do ya get there? Just asking for a friend
---
I'll mention a few things I saw, but only watched the vid once so might be more.
---
1. Upon landing, you start moving and take a while to even target.  Some thrasher fits would be able to lock and pop you before you got lock with how slowly that target acquisition was, but it didn't happen here.  There is a delay between landing out of warp and when you can target, but if you have a successfully issued move command, you can target.  So I usually spam issue movement and as soon as possible acquire target and engage prop mod.  The faster this happens, the better, because initiative is important, and tackle so they can't leave is important.
---
2. Can't tell how you are maneuvering but your ship is full burning away from him while you are 41km out, so I'm not sure
---
3. Heat management - you run heat too long and burn out, and you don't have MWD pre-heated so it doesn't get heat bonus until second cycle.  A lot of the time you can just pre-heat for the first few cycles and get in your optimal ranges and turn it off, but this is entirely dependent on fit.
---
4. Cap management - You run out of cap, and don't turn your modules back on.  Its very common to run out of cap, but you basically have to turn everything back it is usually best to stay ahead of it (especially if you are juggling heat at the same time.
---
5. 25k orbit - Although your disruptor probably hits here, having such a wide orbit leaves you susceptible to sling shots.  He's just got to break a few km to swing out of disruptor and he bounces, although I think he got out because you ran out of cap and didn't reactivate MWD in this instance.
---
6. Setting orbit through right click  -  You should probably have a good idea of what your engagement range is before entering battle.  Judging by your fit, you are probably setup to orbit in 25-ish range, but you should set default so you can just w-click them to orbit instead of having to go through the right click context menu.  Not sure if you had a default and changed to 25 mid-fight or not so could be wrong on this one.
---
7. Dscan while fighting - Could be friends he's calling in to tackle you, on that note, you can set a profile for your dscan to filter out some of the non-ship stuff you don't need to see.
---
8. Dscanning w/o map - you can actually just hold your scan hotkey (default v) and click an object in space and it will scan in that direction.  So in this instance, you can just v-click all the sites w/ a 5 degree scan on the overview and check where ships are at (also easier to process with a good pvp filter).  As soon as you find someone, warp, and set your dscan to 360 degree and 1au (or whatever your preferred short scan distance is) for easy scanning while fighting (again, easier to process with a filtered dscan list).
---
9. No manual piloting - although not necessary, a few manual clicks will get you far and help you out.  If you are overloaded on managing cap/heat like in this instance, instead of right clicking and setting a new orbit range, you can probably just guess a "close enough" movement vector, double click, and manage heat/cap, then when that stuff is managed, set your new orbit range.  Sometimes it can take so long to set a new orbit or keep at distance, that it will not be what you want once you select it.  So you can also double click a manual "close" vector quickly then go to set it.  Your ship will then be burning in the right direction by the time you finally pick what you want through the context menus.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
You probably had kinetic missiles loaded which is fine in this case with a Thrasher, but if you know how he is fit via a zKill lookup, you could probably make the switch to EM or Explosive and it will net you more damage than the extra 5% kinetic bonus on the Hookbill.  Just make sure you are taking into account what you think the enemy resists will be.  This can be tough though unless they have a stale zKill board with homogenous fits.    
---
Probably more as well, but this is a good starter list I think, keep flying, all of this stuff will become more natural the more you play, and the more you do it, the more time you get to think about the more nuanced things you need to do.  My best advice would be to focus on your movement first, cap second, and for heat, go ahead and start heated, but turn off your heat early to focus until fight is stable, then start managing it, this will give you more time to make decisions in fight and fewer things to worry about.  Once it becomes second nature, you can push the extremes on heat/cap but you just need to focus on the movement/cap while you are learning.  
---
Cheers
---
Yes it isn't their job to do those either. But they freely choose to.
---
nice strawman.
---
but no, nobody is under any obligation to report anyone for anything. it's down to ccp to deal with bots [and any other rule breaking], not us.
---
trash
---
is what i do with  em
---
Okay, so what would the difference be?
---
They can freely choose to allow bots to roam rampant in their space, and potentially suffer the negative consequences. Just like a group that would suffer the negative consequences if they took out a fleet with no FC and no voice comms. Or they can choose to put some effort into it, and even reap the rewards if they can nail down bots in an opposing alliance.
---
you guys keep whining about it and they still aren't going away, so i'm sure you can understand people's lack of giving a shit.
---
it was probably going to/from Wicked Creek.
---
not sure why he used that particular mid though, there is a route via citadels that are open to DV
---
Go get em!! It’s a lot trickier to catch them these days, and can be a slow process. You need to learn their timers (often 2-5mins, sometimes longer), logoff traps can work nicely though CCP ruined login times a bit a few months ago. 
---
Use a fast ship, oh and an alt blue to your target is always nice for region scouting )
---
Negative would be a good way to force alliance leader to stop not giving a fuck about botter in their space since it would make their space vulnerable. Now, yes it's not leadership job to deal with bot, but I'm sure a majority of renter alliance know their member are botting and let them do because why not heh, easy isk.
---
The CCP mail saying a botter have been ban is my favorite morning juice
---
This sounds like a pretty big mistake by CCP, that sounds very frustrating. Maybe page one of them itt.
---
We as an alliance report their bots on a daily basis and get about a hundred emails weekly that’s action was taken against those plays and we notice they are gone... 24 hours later 100 more take their place... There needs to be a punishment for it if they are being harbored.
---
Something similar happened to me back in May. It took around 17 days to resolve. Good luck!
---
When i saw goons in 1dq doing that i d always jump in their nestor dock up and put it up on market after repackaging it
---
that's why you activate hacks duh
---
Sort even kicks coalition members for questioning the bots lmfao
---
Ahhhhh now that's a real benefit.
---
You said punishments, not undoing bot action.
---
It says punishment right in the title of this thread.
---
Its really hard to differentiate a bot from a real player who doesn't want to talk. Except that its not as well.
---
Bots are a lot harder to catch than a multiboxing player because a multiboxer has to pay attention and act; a bot just has pre-programed behaviors that it executes perfectly. 
---
The real difference is easy to see when you do run into a bot though; they don't vary much; they have a set of behaviors and wont exhibit new ones spontaneously. Real players don't run on fixed timers. If they see you trying to pull log off traps with a sabre, they will change their warp ins.
---
There are stories of people chasing the same bot around in huge circles through the map. I have seen them repeatedly warp back to the same citadel time after time from the same direction. Always a bit too fast to catch but, seemingly on such a short timer, before they reset.
---
I can tell you from experience, a real human ratter gets tired of warping out of his sites and either goes somewhere else or takes a break until hostiles leave. That is how a normal human responds to the same gang patrolling up and down a pipe. Bots, they just keep undocking, keep warping back, over and over.....on a literal timer.

Whatever wallet bot taxes end up in just remove the botted tax isk.
---
well depends yes. think blackout hurt us a bit as alot of people moved on to larger groups, and or other places with less headache. it is slowly growing back though, as always. but it does ofc mean that we aren't as strong as we were 2 years ago, pre-pl invasion i would think. i mean we did get kicked out of provi and have had to regroup post that, and then when we were getting then blackout hit and we lost a bit as well. I would probally say that its a combination of many things. not just one or 2, but you can see slowly numbers increasing in provi (not just in probviblock allied numbers as well). anyways, it does depend upon where you roam, but if you roam in provi your not going to get 20 titans dropped on your head at one time (atleast not that i've seen)

A "new player" is flying a 2 billion isk faction battleship with T2 guns? What the fuck? Eve really is dying. I'm glad he lost his ship.
---
If they were fleet warped and all landed on the same time on the target then they will necessarily lock up and shoot as soon as they can. So technically, they'll always have similar damage provided they have the same fits and have similar skills.
---
I'm not saying that they aren't input broadcasting, I'm saying that you have to come up with a better proof.
---
Dinobeans
---
Well, he recovered from losing his [Sabre](https://zkillboard.com/kill/80447017/) and [Svipul](https://zkillboard.com/kill/80453734/) just fine.
---
Not bad to cross train into all 3 in 4 months.
---
Ok so the damage is not applied evenly, and what “newbro” is flying a 2 billion isk ship? Not only that but they also lost a Sabre and a Svipul just fine...
---
I actually think that would be the wrong way to do it. Lowering the price is not going to increase the movement at all. 
---
Reason being as you stated yourself - It's a vanity item. People buy vanity items, because they have a bunch of isk laying around they don't need.
---
And because the price suddenly goes down by x % does not mean that there will suddenly be a lot of people looking to buy said item. 
---
Because price is not what are holding them off in the first place.
---
One color is very rare.
---
I see that Jayson is still doing great job to keep this game alive.
---
2bil Macherial in Highsec, must be a new player.
---
I would stick with selling on market. Also put up a contract or two with said item, and advertise on the eve forums aswell
---
Don't lower the price. It's not going to do anything for the velocity of sales.
---
People always say to fly some 2 mil ships you like in FW to get better, but... What IS "better?"  Deciding whether to engage or not?

---
What about DSTs and Orcas? Don't their SMAs work on Caps?
---
Hi Bex
---
Alliances don't have the tools or resources to find botters. That's CCPs job.
---
However they can probably do something about corp leaders.
---
801 mil for full fit
---
Goons, TEST, Panfam have basically no issues with bots in their actual sov, because real players get pissed with bots taking up space and generally being in the way.
---
ALL of their rental programs have massive botting problems, however. So is the result that large alliances stop having renters for fear of the renters being bots that cause significant damage to the sov they put them in, making it laughably easy to invade? On top of rental fees getting neg walleted, of course.
---
Less renters and less incentive to take space to install renters sounds like an acceptable outcome to me.
---
Anyone with a 10-cell brain could have seen that Kids with Guns was 90% bots, and stopped taking their money. All of that isk should have been neg walleted from TEST, XIX, FRT, and anyone else they paid off.
---
It’s a bitch to cart around, Spodumain is.
---
I can't imagine the average acc/player has gone down with how many more caps and supers there are so everyone and their dog has a scout acc a subcap acc a fax acc a dread acc and a super acc.... And then the industrial machine to build them all.... rorq accs component builder alts etc.etc.ahhhhh.....
---
Frigates don't handle heat from the mwd very well. I don't recommended preheating it. You will want to drop that heat ASAP. 
---
You also spun yourself out. The chosen orbit is only really good for about 800-1000ms and generally the greater your velocity the more you deviate from that orbit.
---
Ships also travel faster in a straight line. Use approach or manually pilot closer before orbiting. This will get you point quicker. But also keep in mind, you will be easier to track when approaching so keep your opents weapons in mind. 
---
Jettison somthing in space and practice approaching. A few times and you will find that sweet spot
---
Leaders of the largest alliances are pretty public figures. If the Mittani was banned, he couldn't make his way back into alliance leadership without never speaking on voice comms ever again, and if he was caught he risks getting everyone who knew he was ban evading smacked with him.
---
The same goes for other figures like Vily, Dran, Sapporo, Gobbins, noraus, etc. etc.
---
That's bullshit libertarianism. Sorry. I think its pretty common sense to say that exploiting people with mental illness for profit should be curtailed, if not stopped completely; this is one of the very *reason d'etres* of the modern state. Then again, I am a Marxist; however, it would appear that most of the continent of Europe (and surprisingly North America) agrees with me.

This was a major issue for us when we were fighting BOT in the spire and ER. I sent ccp a few emails pointing out this side effect, because most people were just focused on the money the bots brought in. It sucked when wed camp a system for over a week to get the adm down and then wed forget to log in the camper for a day and the adm would be all the way back up. 
---
They also just rotated out bots as they were banned which made the reports seem pointless, youd think ccp would pay attention to whos ratting in a system after banning everyone who ratted in it once a week for a month straight.
