You should be able to pull this into pyfa with the mutation included.

It's all anabyssal except the shield booster which is an a-type medium rolled for great cap efficiency. I run with crystals, 5% damage and application implants, and standard blue pill &amp; crash. I used to use pyrolancea also before it got to expensive for me. I have hacs 4 (5 is in queue eventually) so it could do slightly better.
---
It's probably not the most isk-efficient or massively effective setup ever, but I don't really like using drones so gila is out for me, and what I really do like about the cerb is that I can start shooting at 42km when I get the big leshak spawn, and I can still hit out to 23km with 81.3m radius and 107m/s velocity while under pressure from four ghosting damaviks, which were the downfall of all of my turret-based hac attempts before this. And it's really fun. It does struggle slightly against the Drifter Assault battleship, but I survived what I consider a nearly worst-case scenario (assault battleship in range of short and medium tracking pylons, I spawned in blue cloud 60km off, 4x entangler and 2x illuminator) with a good amount of heating and using the adcu.
---
Oh, and I prefer the Serpentis web over the longer range ones because it actually felt like a pretty big application bonus against rogue drone frigates and lucid frigates.

This. It always annoyed the fuck out of me when I was in test and in super engagemnts where there was like 3-5 trillion isk on field and the BR after hours of tidi ended up at like 100b vs 150b.
---
Who thinks that's fun? Lol. Hours and hours of the biggest ships in the game going head to head in tidi and only a few percent of the fielded isk is lost? And then a lot of it is recovered by whomever held the field besides? Lol.
---
Make eve dangerous again.
---
Those are capital guns. This change doesn't effect them. 
---
This is amazing!
---
sounds good to me
---
Just don’t live in a C4
---
&gt;TAPI is weaker with these changes
---
Did you forget the absolutely disgusting amount of dreads we fielded in ualx?
---
Because Eve isn't safe enough right now?
---
That's_the_joke.png
---
Somewhat new info. But since Sansha's Nation tries to get involved in every frontier New Eden has to offer and the Triglavian collective seems to take great offense in anything that interferes with human will/choice it would be a no brainer that those two factions would collide in a unsolvable conflict.
---
Dread is much more engageable, you can drop a carrier on it at range and it won't get blapped from 200k.
---
Probably, was bored at work tho and already had a draft ready
---
I mean forming against 110 Titans in Legacy Prime time is tough Vily gotta admit
---
It's been proven to not be constellation. Most people thing its region based but some think its entire class. 
---
Solo as in the traditional definition of the word: alone.
---
***"American Express, Don't leave home without it"***
---
r24 actually has all the shattered c5 holes. so there is none is any of the other c5 regions. The respawn rate in the shattered for c5 sites is no higher than any other wh and about half have people running all the sites regularly. 
---
yikes imagine playing the victim this hard
---
Or until progod makes a really tight fitting doctrine and needs abyssal mods to pull it off.
---
its not constellation based. its been tested.
---
Do you want to hear, "No, we're all full."  Who in their right mind that actively plays a game that, for all intents and purposes has been dieing since "pick a year," come here and tell you to not play this game?  We are here, we all still love this old ass game, yes there are ongoing issues, as there always has been, as every other game has and we're dealing with them here as a community.  The game is and always has been awesome, or else reddit would be a lot less active with a lot less people giving any fux.  You want to play this game?  Come on down, the plethora of ships at your disposal await.  Learning curve is hard, but it's fun when you start to realize what you can do, and what can be done to you.  It takes work, you can ask any player here, the amount of effort that goes into this game is not light.  You get what you give.  Choose your path capsuleer, for the stars are yours.
---
Looks good cheers. Looking forward to trying that out on the next SiSi Mirror.
---
And yeh, the 14km 60% webs are my choice as well.
---
its not constellation based. 
---
i also quit in 2013, came back in September of 18.  Welcome home friend.
---
A dread isnt going to care about the dps of a single carrier and if you drop a lot of stuff a dread can just as easily light a cyno as a titan.

Its grey area RMT. They donate money/make him earn ad revenue, they get ISK.
---
I spent like an hour in my POS when I put up my first one as it was the first time I'd ever been inside one, just marveling at the shield effect and thinking "*This* space. This is *mine.*
---
Can't argue with this as similar in that came back at the start of April as well after a couple month break only to get to bad so sad fuck off and deal with it as the problem didn't affect you. On that one day no it didn't but since then well..
---
But you can't hear me scream in space!
---
Also does this mean the new billboards system is coming to fruition? 
---
No one cares about your opinions 
---
Ok let me try this again since you're incredibly dense.  Based on the current formula given in the graph, 100 dreads will just get repped by the FAX.  200 dreads will shoot through reps but too slowly and will die before they achieve anything of value.  300 dreads will shoot through reps very quickly and should trade positively in most situations.  Anything past 300 dreads is better.
---
Clearly you don't actually understand this mechanic.
---
Don't forget to call your ISP too, its definitely on their end!
---
We don't really ever need our super fleet unless we're fighting another one.  Unlike our usual enemies, we aren't forced to field our super fleet just to beat subcaps
---
its horde, we got spies, we got new players, we got afk players, and we got brave players in disguise (you know its them because they salvaging during the battle)
---
Your dread prices are wayyy off for most nullbloc's. In legacy fax's are going for about 850-900 and dreads 1.1. The Standard TEST bomb dread fit sells for 1.95 bil in staging, and the standard Super-Cap Buddy FAX costs 1.9-&gt;2 bil per by just doing a quick scan of contracts.  
---
Never use ZKill for pricing.... it's almost never correct
---
Try being the guy who's played for 13 years but wasn't subbed during the time period when they took down names for the monument.
---
Exactly, get 50 X's for titans, and like.... 2 X's for fax....
---
I live in Santa Clara. I might be able to make it
---
In what world would someone put a Main in a dread?? My dread alt uses like 6 of his clones to just sit in each of the dread cache systems. No way am I burning 6 of my clones on my main for that shit.
---
Yes... but they often prefer a booster over a battery

itt: vily is sad because he has spent the last 3 months putting down keepstars across the south, so his supers could stage with near-invulnerability. now they will actually be at risk if fielded, oh noes

I'm not sure whether you are serious or trolling considering how many exclamation marks are there
---
I remember when jita local was broken one time when I was cruising through and the constant joining and disconnection every few seconds, while trying to slowly populate a local chat list of 1000+ really fucked up the eve client in general. 
---
some of us like blinging regular frigates and stuff. SUE ME
---
And hull crystals!

Right....?

fair, hard to tell with so many muppets on here sometimes :/

Guys... I'm scares! :(

 Jita scammers on eve.  Love it.

^&gt;.&lt;
---
Sorry, I replied elsewhere in the thread but not here. I payed 2bil for it.
---
Panic for smaller groups allows time to ping and get people online for a save.  The nerf will have no effect on large groups with a significant standing fleet ready to save the rorq.  
---
probably, but I've also learned that it's good to present most of your points in your opening statement.
---
Also there is something nice about quoting dev blogs to prove a point.
---
Fit 2 sebos, lock shit fast, minimal loss overall

Shut up you absolute dingus vily r more like vile rump

Imagine if you were witty

It's 1,000 million SP per character per account per ship.

Can you not jump to a cyno with NSA active?
---
Not even that, you should have the NSA set to decycle after every first use of it. It will take literally 5 more keystrokes per site, but I guess that's too much for the smoothbrains that have been super ratting lately.
---
Yea it's been fucky for me too, sometimes it starts working, then after a while stops and throws 502, I'm guessing some issues on their end?
---
It says “morning” in the title. 
---
out of my 4 kirks only Nick was missed, sent a ticket, thanks for the points! been along time since any of my accounts have been unsubbed lol i need a life
---
But but but they have to work even harder to Plex their accounts now!!!!!!!!
---
I agreed with this. While u/lipsi is right about the training cross over for mains, the majority of dread pilots are alts. Most of the time dreads are called as a reactionary force or an escalation. So your alt chills in a dread while your main does sub cap crap in the main fleet. 
---
At this point I'm proud that a change was made to billboards and it didn't result in a POS meltdown or athanors deleting moons. Pretty good feature though nice work.

Yes.

Shhh don’t tell him
---
What about Goons/INIT? Bcoz local was 500+ 
---
man, i wish i could get back into eve...  lacking motivation, when ever i log in i seem to just sit in dock and chat.   going to a meetup this next Wednesday so maybe i get some motivation there :/
---
I don't know where "Keepstar" is... is that in The Citadel?
---
i smell a nightmare fleet win button
---
I'm being serious. Just excited. This community has a mix of awesome people and awesome being who roleplay at being assholes, it seems.
---
He could be collecting names to blame in case he tumbles off the learning cliff.
---
They pulled their keepstar out of the alliance to save the killboard.
---
And you think they're gonna defend in, hell, actually log in?
---
L M F A O
---
Wouldn't this come into effect much earlier than 100 dreads?
---
The "breakeven" between 1 FAX repping 1 Dread damage happens at 75 reps according to the diminishing returns chart, which should be around 25 FAX give or take. Counting the undiminished reps, this should equal around ~45-50 dreads before 1 dread starts out-damaging 1 FAX. "just" a 10 dread advantage at that scale still allows you to kill a super in a siege cycle from full health.
---
Sometimes it took 2-3 minutes to load all your chats that you had open and your client would chug along at 1fps until everything loaded improperly.
---
You play Eve with the sound on?
---
No, but EWAR does, forget which module I use but auto-target does not change aggro.
---
Never too late for a shit post, this is the/eve
---
lmao I was thinking Camal like turn left
---
This
---
Yep. Eve is still fun for new players. Twho’vehe guys frustrated with the game are the ones  been playing for ten years and really understand the intricacies at this point, which in turn makes it easy to realize how CCP is destroying their game. But there’s still nothing else that compares with how complex and cool Eve is while you’re trying to figure out those intricacies (as a new player!)
---
Give it a try, it’s free. 
---
Hahahahaha why wont they fight 10 to 1 hahahahaahaha lol we rule lowsex XDDDDDD hahahahaha oh wait, what happened to everyone in lowsec?
---
The current meta is using a fax wall to protect your supers and letting them get holocausted. The fits most blocs use are cheap, high EHP buffer FAX meant to absorb as much damage as possible because *they* will be the primary target. You can't start killing supers until they're cleared off of field.
---
Right now, the balance of power is heavily in favor of the defender, as all they have to do is bring fax alts to soak up damage for half the price of the dread that's shooting them, while at the same time being one of the easiest ships to replace. 
---
why u haff 2 be mad
---
Is it having temporary issues? Or is it always like this
---
I have been seeing API issues with some of my apps, my guess is that tripwire is having similar issues
---
hahaha salty lowseccers BBC RULE We have big cock hahahaha we defo arent white neckbeards hahahaha memememe
---
&gt; idk if links are allowed
---
Why do people always say this in every sub? Reddit is a link sharing site, unless the sub specifically says it's not allow, just assume links are allowed.
---
It's this in case anyone else was wondering: https://mutaplasmid.space/
---
It worked fine last time I used it a while ago, so i'm hoping it's temporary.
---
Yeah, I love looking at the scenery when I explore, one of the coolest places I found so far is cloud ring, with the nebula that surrounds the whole constellation, it’s beautiful. Lots of the wormhole affects look dope too.
---
Let the ban hammer swing again
---
"Yes", and "mostly yes", at least based on the moons that I have.
---
damn, you ok?
---
Love your videos!! Such great quality. Keep up the amazing work!
---
Can someone explain this to a noob?
---
Lol plenty, my group has &lt;10 active pilots and we Rorq mine. In lowsec, no less.
---
wow,vily appeared
---
Tis neat 
---
&gt; Do you think they took the time to make sure they weren't shooting some new player?
---
Considering he was in Brave I'm pretty sure they explicitly did the opposite
---
Goood.
---
Please dont. Just... dont.
---
Over the years since Plex was introduced, the amount of isk generated in general has snowballed based on a few tweaks to ingame mechanics, and and just an overall maturing of the characters ingame, either through training or injecting, leading the price to go from 500 mil/month for game time early on, to the near 2 bil/month we have now.
---
It's really just inflation, plex isn't minable or able to be generated outside of someone buying it with real money, so when all other assets become common and essentially closer to worthless, plex maintains its real value relatively well.
---
Lmao Code propaganda never ceases to cringe. 
---
CCP need to fix this ASAP. The fact that they got so much feedback after the Devblog, and did nothing to change the way SP was to be handed out is honestly shocking. Players shouldn't have to give them common sense advice like 'don't compensate some customers and not others who all experienced the same problem'. 
---
And now they're tryna sell it as 'no no its Compensation for 1 extended downtime'. Despite the entire issue being about ongoing chat outages which persisted over 9 months.
---
So if I shoot someone in Brave now, should I assume they are a new player? 
---
I love everything about these :-).
---
Cus they all post like trash. Asher is one of the only goons I can think of that knows how to post, and he's never on the subreddit anymore.

I love this RP side of eve, even if I am a filthy pirate and don't participate! Keep it up!

Lol fair

There is no such thing as bullying in EVE Online. We are all immortal capsuleers who can leave whenever we like. Nothing wrong with holding a grudge against people who killed you though, as long as you make good on it. And being passive-aggressive doesn't count.
---
You can be damn sure provide has never cared about their killboards a day in their lives, at least. They just wanna play the game.
---
I honestly believed you guys *were* the ccp guys. Even then the quality and haste is astounding. And if you do it as actual capsuleer news agency it’s even more fantastic. Great job guys!

A BR takes an additional 20 seconds to scoop stuff, whereas multiboxed booshers take them in as less as 10 seconds if you do it right. Those 10 seconds are important, in which you can get combat scanned and tackled. Sometimes I lose booshers that way. When 1 boosher dies, the rest warps off, saving 4 drones. You'll just lose too many BR's because you bumped that scoop time from 10 to 30 seconds. If everyone began to use BR's, people will just hunt them and kill them. And they'll be carrying all your drones, not 1.
---
So the more rational way is taking the hit at the warp speed.
---
o7
---
No, but if you pretend like you're wardecking Brave to kill the smaller population of experienced players who are likely already educated in avoiding wardecks, I'm going to call you a retard.
---
I completely agree with you, I also get shunted out of getting the sp, I started playing in July and have had 3 accounts subbed during these chat problems, which massively affected our small gangs, because we didn't even have fleet chat working... 
---
It's not under (PHEW) anymore
---
Triglavians announced war on all inhumans. 
---
My main can use a dread but thats because i ran out of shit to train. All my dread characters are extraneous alts
---
I think you've made alot of assumptions here, the bulk of which I don't really agree with. You assume there won't be a change in tactics: there will be. Fundamental to your understanding of this change is that everyone just lights a cyno on each other and brawls outrageous in a largely unmoving blob. After all, this is generally how most super blobs have worked before. I can see how this "chokes out content" for TEST, given that it will just make you even more risk averse then before. For other groups though, it seems pretty clear that CCP wants to encourage actual tactical positioning in fights outside of the traditional one person lights a hard cyno and the blob enters the grid. Alot of your post comes down to the fact that scrubbier alliances like TEST only have a handful of FC's who are largely unwilling to allow any kind of subordinate FC to make micro-decisions to the benefit of the larger group. It's unfortunate that you are advocating for more of the same stagnant tactical play, while being seemingly oblivious to the obvious tactical ramifications that such a change would mean (Perhaps you do understand that it would put you at a disadvantage, and hence you don't like it). I can understand how that is so terrifying for a leader in TEST (And a former GOON FC at that) who's never had to delegate control and has relied exclusively on bad mechanics for years; for the rest of us, it means we can actually beat the blobs by being better.

My wife just asked what the hell news I was watching. She said she thought it was the BBC, but none of it made sense.

---
Which is to say: you folks fucking rock.
---
Too bad a lot of the old lore is forgotten and hidden
---
Imagine if you had a leg to stand on.
---
You can play however you want in the sandbox. But you must afford your hunters the same courtesy. As a pacifist entity in a PvP game Signal Cartel is the odd one out.
---
Just a random person spitballing, but I'm guessing TEST will field 2 full dread fleets at a minimum in 6-12 months time and goons 3-4+.
---
And be capable of covering a significant part of the insurance reduction while doing so.
---
I will be cross training my rorq/super/mino into dreads if this patch goes through as is.
---
A Rorqual that cannot safely stash all of their drones?
---
Everyone got nerfed, not just Supers, which is how it should be.
---
Yes. There's really no reason not to at least try it then decide later if you want to sub. It's a tough game needing a lot of teamwork and practice.
---
What the hell is a ndokassi
---
Jita scammers on eve?... 
---
Sadly you are right. I had the sane thoughts, they even fucked up the sp hand out and one of my *paid* alts didnt get the sp.   
---
they dun fuck up and won’t acknowledge that. Maybe guard left because of that *too*.
---
1.6 btw. 
---
Ironic considering they just handed out SP for this, but only if you were subbed on march 20 2018, if you subbed anytime after that and up to today and were affected by these problems, well fuck you, you don't matter mate 
---
We've gotten our 3 faction titans. No need to make dumb plays for more :)

It suddenly works when the sum is over 100b.

&gt; There is no such thing as bullying in EVE Online. We are all immortal capsuleers who can leave whenever we like.

This entirely disregards the person sitting on the other end of the keyboard. And the internet as a whole can do with more consideration for it.

&gt;Nothing wrong with holding a grudge against people who killed you though, as long as you make good on it. And being passive-aggressive doesn't count.
---
The people who used to kill me never come to null. And people like pirat never come to null. And most recently i took a lot of pleasure in killing every simple farmer i could in our last wardec. Unfortunately due to the mechanics of cloaky camping it was hard to sink your talons into them.
---
Agreed. You're arguing with the same carebears and e.bushido followers that I butt heads with in discussions about highsec ganking. We know that PvP is the whole point of the game and nobody should be exempt, but they cling to the notion that there should be a way for themeparkers/newbies/casuals/returning players (and naturally themselves) to opt out of PvP.
---
Thanks to both of you. I had no clue and I'm not clever enough that I'd think of doing that.
---
Any specific reason the non-CONCORD billboards don't play anything, though? (I can imagine it might get repetitive in stations, for one)
---
And man, I would have loved for this thing to pop up and take over the tv in the captain's quarters - would have been wicked weird and cool &lt;/3
---
🤔
---
That’s what I do with mine, Loki permatanks some npc response fleets including neuting. 
---
I'm just shocked that null sec ores are on the list for high sec moons. 
---
Also is there truesec limit? I.E. can only anchor/moon mine in .5 systems or is it viable to anchor a structure in any system?
---
Scanned for 3 hours and settled on the first C4 I found lol. Lots of dead sticks and a dead astrahus. Don't know if there's really any point in shooting them seeing as all I really need to remove are the POCO's unless I'm moon mining.
---
Well they created the connections to Anoikis
---
Nice ratting vessel. Not the rag tho. Hate it. 
---
Mine same base mod similar stats was right under 200m
---
We stole the car but couldn't get the paint job because EVE.
---
He's been infected, the only thing we can do now is put him down. 
---
How do you count for the lower insurance pay out? The dreadbomb is very effective maybe against supers, but also will cost more. Its a kamikazi now that actually will work and create content. Paper rock, scissors finally maybe? 
---
In general however the stacking of reps with a penalty shoudl favor the blobber. Sinde the blobber can stack dps now easier till the point where the enemy breaks. The smaller enemy might reach is also easier so he ll punch back a little, but its a losing fight. In the past, small well organised cap entities, nc, pl could surive for blobs cause they knew how to rep and well Organiser spider tank; now you break them easier, organised or not. So the blob wins, again, this time for sure
---
So you put 300 dreads togtehr, you deserve some kills, get counterdropped not with supers but wlso dreads, so dread slugfest, both sides lose 200 dreads, Epic. Finally a way to burn the endless stacking of isk.
---
Should be fun though, paper rock and sciccors and lots of drama, death, yelling poeple and complaints, gotta love eve. 
---
What about those of us who unsubbed because we eere sick and tired of this shit!? 
---
Fuck off
---
Seems like a pretty chill camper, usually the ones I see drop 40 kiting lokis on us when we have like 5 guys online.
---
I stand on the FRT stand, but from the long-term perspective of the universe, GOONS is still a giant. Now the whole universe is against the goons, I don't have enough confidence. 
---
i thought this was made by ccp at first. good job on the creepy voice acting!
---
Buddy exactly what I have mentioned not everybody loves playing every aspect of the game. But yeah exploration is good ISK. And not everybody does exploration,please understand that! :-)
---
So whats the ship type?
---
Hac, Combat recon, Combat BC using a Cruiser hull (Like the Drifters use BS as Titans.)?
---
Absolutely this. We made the complaint about super cap proliferation and how its oppressive. 
---
We now have a change that will allow them to die, dont reverse your stance saying they need to live now.
---
This is why it's hard for CCP to balance the game cause all the powers that be cant make up their damn minds on what they want.
---
Let the supers die.
---
Besides 300 dreads vs a **Fleet** of supers, the supers should still be able to kill a lot of fucking dreads.
---
"**Camal** Keepstar"
---
Because what the game needs is a higher barrier to entry into PvP and a higher perceived cost to losing ships?
---
Not everybody plays every aspect of the game! When sub capital lovers cried over capitals being overpowered they were nerfed. Those sub cap lovers  loved what they did. Same I am doing something I love but I am only asking for the PLEX prices to drop!
---
They also were the first to kill a keepstar 
---
!remind 6 days
---
Are you sure that's why it got removed, is it plausible there are other reasons?
---
We will blow your shit up, but if you are good about it and ask questions to try and better yourself most players will make you whole for your ISK loss.  
---
That courtesy generally extends for the first 6 months I've found, or until however that particular player caught you would expect you to know better.  
---
Nothing beats the salty salty rage tears of a CoD fanboi when you blow 'em up though.
---
yah on saturday I got socket closed, lost my geddon and nag with pods, was like 5 bill for all. Wrote 2 support tickets, one on each account, they refunded the geddon not the nag.
---
Well can you not see him being senseless and assuming that I am looking for sympathy? In what way this post is going to me any sympathy from eve capsuleers? And here you go, you are just like Anark, I am not here for sympathy, I am requesting change and explaining why I would appreciate the change. When I blindly say since capitals are nerfed, bring the plex prices down. People would give a million suggestions, I explained beforehand why I am asking for the price drop with the situation I am in. I definitely do not need anybody's sympathy but this game is meant to be F2P and when plexing account becomes a hassle. Like you say many would stop playing the game! Do not think about what you can do, think about a broader spectrum!
---
Site spawn pool is region locked. This has been well researched in C6 space where 120 ish systems are realistic  to monitor.

If you are a corp with multiple people then you will be primarily running your static. Alternatively, as most people do, you can have your own farmhole where you only run your own hole.

Oh boy lets anchor one of the most valuable killmail structures in the game and hope nobody shoots it...

I don't like snuff either but the owners put the target on their own heads.

 Probably I was the first Chinese to be said by a foreigner, my friend is not bad in Chinese. ahhhh
---
What I want to say is that I think FRT needs to do that. 
---
To be clear the first half of this video is on the billboards in-game. Zoom in and check them out on a stargate. 
---
Not really, it was sold off to new Korean Overlords who are going to monetize everything.
---
Give it a year or 2 and you'll be able to plex yourself into a triglavian that cant get podded. Lmao
---
I'm not entirely sure Trigs even use Pods. Pretty sure the Trig ships we fly have to be modified during construction to use Pods. Trig themselves just walk around manning the ship.
---
As for whether their Survival Suits are able to keep them going in space, I kinda doubt it? They're basically just a leather jacket with a mask. The insides are lined with Bioadaptive appliances, which are probably better at helping them survive in a new environment, rather than the total vacuum of space. It's easier to keep someone a little warmer or cooler, or give them a little more of this and that gas, than to fight off -270 temperature and a complete lack of breathable atmosphere.
---
Nah the geddon needs a cap booster as well, unless you are just using nos. I use 5 rapid heavies and 2 neuts, mainly because thats what fits since rapid heavies use the least amount of power of all the battleship missiles (also the only t2 ones I have on that toon).
---
If it's against my space family in Eve then it's ok. 
---
Hey I'd like to formally invite you to attack our blob at your convenience, as soon as these changes go through.
---
Well, we're boned!
---
(Also, does anyone have a transcript of what the Trigs are actually saying?)
---
"It's 5pm somewhere" - thejoke.lowres.jpg
---
Yup. Based on MER, excessive ISK lies around with capsuleers through super ratting and rorqual mining. Now that they will be nerfed, hoping plex prices go down a bit!
---
No you didn't understand. I liked to shoot those racists. They made better antagonists in a dark space game. Guess it's just me :p
---
The first 2 minutes are made by CCP. The reporting on it isnt.
---
You are not the first one but I am.  事不目见耳闻而臆断其有无，可乎？！
---
FRT需要的是实干者，而不是夸夸其谈者。
---
Most of what they do is make sure that they know what and when we are forming so they can run away. Or when things like travel ceptors are coming so they can setup the smartbombing machs.
---
It was more fun shooting them. It's not as fun shooting nice players.
---
there are the the kspace empires: Caldari, Gallente, Minmatar, Amarr. their precursor civilizations crumbled when the Eve Gate collapsed and their connection to Earth was cut. there were other colonies though, of relatively backwater and isolated groups, who didn't suffer nearly so badly because they were self sufficient.
---
so there's the empires which shoot back to the middle ages if not worse, and they have to relearn everything, and then there's the others, like the Jove, where being a small spacefaring civilization is now a colossal headstart
---
so long story short the drifters and triglavians are groups with fancy technology that hate each other, possibly since ever
---
Yeah you guys are way bigger, I imagine that comes with a whole different set of problems in and of itself.
---
Not feeling like a victim! 
---
And the whole point of plex prices rising was because there was too much isk. Isk started proliferating in capsuleers hands because of rorqual mining / supers ratting. Now that they are being nerfed if PLEX prices drop to a reasonable amount it would be good. This is the TLDR / what I am intending to convey to the community.
---
:thinking:
---
Nice. Now *that* is a steal. Must have been a while back though, the mutaplasmid is 218 alone now.
---
Dude what?
---
Idk how you got that out of me shooting the shit with a dude who has code flair.
---
/r/oldpoeplefacebook
---
100 euro is still enough to buy a PC to run EVE! Check before u think you are asking smart questions!
---
 Yes, I very much agree with you. So now in the time zone, I choose to go online. 
---
 But I don't know why, there is a problem with the game update, I am reinstalling it.  So just open the VPN, choose to take a look at reddit 
---
Better minerals needed in big boy toy construction should cost more. T1 I think should actually cost less.. At least the frig and destroyer line. People tend to forget how dirt poor you are at game start.
---
🤣🤣🤣that was for t he both of ya!
---
idk about you, i couldn't understand 2/3 of the words in the CCP part... maybe too high. 
---
I think its meant to be like that. In the reporting they say its actually made of 3 voice-layers saying different things. That'd explain it.
---
You must have missed the joke...
---
He said wormholes cause theres where I’m from.
---
I said ganking cause thats where he’s from. 
---
I literally started off the thread of comments saying there’s plenty of ways to make isk.
---
Idk what to tell you man... you need some sharpening.
---
wp, no fitting or why not on contracts with fit... supposed to be like 25 +
---
That makes sense thanks. Also, someone up near top was sayin that it’s 3 voices but not necessarily saying the same thing, I am pretty baked and I assumed they were harmonizing lol. 
---
Carry on :)
---
I did notice both of your comments! And wanted to tell there are many ways but I dont do those ways of making isk! 😝 you ought to sharpen up! 
---
yikes
---
Unpopular opinion alert:
---
None of these changes will actually affect the meta like you hope. It just encourages n+1 behavior and the most problematic areas e.g the guy running 20 rorqs, the group who drops carriers on anyone in their space, literally all titan blobs, are the least affected by all of these changes.
---
All of this just means people will want more rorq alts, more carriers dropping, and more titan blobbing to make up for the nerfs.
---
Snuff begging for relevance 
---
Considering your pod is literally getting riddled with holes, I doubt anyone could survive it.
---
&gt; But wjo the fuck afk carrier or super rats? 
---
Came here to say this. I don't rat in it but controlling fighters is a helluva lot more work than dropping aggressive drones.
---
Highsec is the most dangerous space tbh
---
no
---
IIRC (and I've never done highsec moon mining so far, but I've handled dozens of other moons), you can only moon mine in 0.5 systems or below (so 0.5 or low/null/WH). Possibly 0.6.
---
TNT is a strong force within the imperium, i remember a while ago they deployed geminate and would regularly run fleets of thrashers that would sometimes kill things. Good for them for trying to PVP!

Not posting in support of nerf or against it I just wish it were possible for all the so called Krabs to organize and take a 6 month hiatus away from the game just long enough for all the hardcore pvper's ship prices to spike, plex to rise to 10mil per and implants non existant. Oh i dream of the tears it would create, nothing better than elite pvp tears. Maybe then their will be peace as both sides will have seen oblivion.
---
You're actually retarded and I don't know why you think you can speak on my behalf. 
---
They are doing good now man, they deployed this fort, they are so far uninhibited by anyone in syndicate as they make this beach head. They are going to shake things up a bit
---
I look forward to the next olmeca dissertation in a month from now saying rorqs and titans are still too powerful...
---
Oh i want to be as naive as a new player again ...
---
And the first to lose the first ever Keepstar
---
More at 11
---
Eh, it had a good run. We expected it to die a long time ago but none of the big bois came until now.  
---
Theres only two entities that can place Keepstars and properly defend them, and even they lose keepstars on their border regions. Everyone else is just a pet of one side or the other at the end of the day.
---
It’s a 30% nerf not half 
---
&gt; so sad to read the awful amount of people complaining they didn't get free shit because they were not sub

I didn't get free shit even though I was subbed.

What do they drop for the added difficulty? Minerals? Faction mods?
---
   
---
In China, it seems that this is a very troublesome thing. I will send it to you for the next opportunity. 
---
Well, my respect to you guys for giving it a run at all.
---
We fielded 600 dreads in UALX
---
I think we learned that deploying to Syndicate for content would essentially just be a waste of time after this timer. Full steam ahead to Tribute. 
---
&gt; 43 accounts
---
Fucking hell. I dread seeing your launcher!
---
&gt;Save
---
I think back to the UALX fight where you guys dropped a fuck ton of dreads on our FACS and Titans. You dropped like 300 dreads and were quickly chewing through our FACS and eventually titans before the keepstar died and the server crashed. I think at that level it really doesn't matter how many FACS you have, shits going to die.
---
The hair matches up. Seems legit to me
---
\*unzips\*
---
Yeah the rorq is approaching the point of being not worth fielding 10b.
---
You can get a super for just a few more billion and be safer and making way more money.
---
Thank you brother snuffys. Much appreciated, now we will reconquista the rest of Providence!
---
It has lived over a year and been worth it, we will just throw another one up as soon as they move on.  
---
This is how EVE works, live in your sand castle until someone knocks it over and then just replace it.  
---
We could fight, but with the meta being long range titans and massive apostles we would just feed our super fleet to kill some FAX.  
---
That said if Snuff/Init/Goons make a mistake we will be there to punish it like we did to Test when they came for our fort.
---
I don't think noraus is going to say anything until the changes are confirmed.
---
I dread it too sometimes. 
---
Playing the game how you want.
---
Playing for free.
---
You kinda can’t have both. 
---
It sounds like you have access to super capitals, rorquals, and fucking VNI’s. 
---
The only one stopping you from making more isk is yourself. Because you’ too lazy to do anything that isn’t AFK-able. What, do you expect people to tell you how to do the laziests ways of making isk more effectively(there isn’t). If you want to succeed in eve you’re gonna have to either pay for the game or learn to have fun playing it in a more profitable way.
---
Nobody is hoarding PLEX... 🤦🏻‍♂️ it keeps rising because the ultra isk wealthy keep expanding their empire of alts, and how much isk they can make. There’s a finite amount of SP when compared to Isk so as more people want to plex their n’th account it’s going to rise more.
---
I make 4 Bill from PI. Stop being lazy.
---
And now? Why do you point out that specific Eve-Streamer? Visit every Eve-Stream out   
---
there, and you will notice, that a lot of streamers give double loyality points to their subs.   
---
And yes, they also do this kind of give-away he does.   
---
I feel pretty sorry for you, that your stream isn't visited as much as his stream, but   
---
thats no reason, to cry that much. Maybe, one day, you will find a method to have  
---
more viewers than him.
---
&gt;Rumor is Syndicate and Solitude is under their radar.
---
So uh... Why? Why is Syndicate is of any interest to them? Obviously besides Poitot and local agents. Genuinely curious since I haven't heard much of TNT ever since WWB happened
---
تطهير الكفار من النقابة
---
Literally "didn't want that keepstar anyway"
---
I did the math on two sentient sebos with scan res: you get about double the scan res of a rattlesnake but still nowhere near what an NSA gives you. If you live in a null block and have at least two systems of intel in either direction you should be ok with an NSA.
---
I'm more wondering what the explosion velocity nerf to fighters will do to ticks if anything at all (since spawned frigs sit still for a bit anyway)
---
Yeah I remember so many incidents of hugging the edge of the shield and dipping in/out to take pot shots at people and repping the tower. Fun times... 
---
Oof, these are some next level tears
---
Don't get wally'd 
---
I got ganked by some in Highsec so yes.
---
How exactly do you buy these? Contract? How do you shop for them? The whole random stats thing seems like it would really complicate shopping.
---
Fair. How is the alliance doing btw? 
---
Is it in Assah?
---
Omni links will still allow them for ratting. If youre overly unhappy with your lock time fit the info link that increases scan res. Back in my day NSA wasnt even a concept and people still ratted in supers.
---
I'm unfamiliar with super insurance values, I've only used caps.
---
this coming from a "providence guiy" how cute.
---
Wow u got flair-baited hard, friendo.  
---
Tell Tiny and Mr. Flint and Mark and Thor and Rah I said Hi =P
---
Friend of mine gave me a thanny from waaay back with like 6 sebos xD
---
This is the best option for a low sec gate to Stain.
---
Maybe they shouldn't be harassing our ansiblex instead?
---
Baited on a free Wally post
---
I heard TNT helped Alliances in Syndi/Placid/Solitude smuggle Supers, Titans and regular caps from Delve.   
---
I think it was that Proximity Alert corp/Hydex? Can you c/d?
---
There's no way they're going to allow abyssal mods in the AT... right?
---
I cant find them anywhere lol
---
what highsec system does the cfc live in?  
---
i sort of agree. 
---
I agree with you that kills SHOULD be had. I agree that supers were too much. But as i tried to articulate in the post. this swings the pendulum far too deeply in the other direction. Under these mechanics titans and supers stop being usable frontline assets. The big battles people want (but dont happen now mostly due to server issues) will now not happen because throwing dreads at the issue will be the default and most effective option.
---
The autists of eve are the most min/max kind of people you can imagine. We will still find a way dont get me wrong. But i think the changes at THIS degree swing the pendulum far too deep into the dreadnaught camp. one FAX negating one dread to me is fine only because if they have 500 dreads and you have 500 FAX then your not killing anything unless you also have 500 dps ships which gives you a relative 2-1 advantage. Thats not a realistic capital situation. Even under my 30% proposed adjustment supercapitals will die. It just wont make the cut so deep that most of the supercap usage is no longer profitable. 
---
Should they or shouldn't they?  I have no idea, I haven't played much with the new up well structures.
---
I think they were thinking about letting flagships use them
---
this is mostly due to latency issues more than anything about the meta or patches. 
---
Got it! I have always been thinking about PI chain. I guess it is time! And thanks for not being toxic like the rest of the fools in this thread! Much appreciated!
---
They generally do for flagships, which is fine imho
---
-_-
---
not at all. 
---
we had 600 dreads. with another 800 cached. We still had to kill your FAX first because previous the FAXrep level was about 4-1. With the current change it will be .3 - 1. What I am suggesting is a more middle ground of 1-1
---
Lol, keep the money to yourself. Nobody from Asia from EVE is asking for it! 
---
You know you’re legit when you know who rah is. Willdo.
---
Back in your day fighters btfo frigates in 1 volley without omni links too.
---
They also did a lot less overall damage and didnt have abilities or spares.
---
Did you say 4 to 0.3? Jesus.
---
You put some effort into the post so i will try to respond in kind.
---
You complain that we don't make tactical plays with our supers while ignoring the fact we use shield supers. Which are the only superfleet which REQUIRES tactical positioning JUST to be used. We cant go at zero and drop unless we have a massive numerical advantage. It may appear sometimes that there is no tactical thinking going into our moves but there are usually hours of discussion backed into every supercap op.
---
As far as delegation its certainly true that at times i struggle to delegate effectively. Its both a weakness and a strength depending on the day.
---
And as far as beating the blob by being better, isn't that exactly what the year long prep and setup for UALX was?
---
5 mil final offer
---
If they reinforce the ansiblex it goes offline. So instead of going HED-GP &gt; V-3GY7 &gt; GE-8JV they have to go through SV5-8N where simple farmers always sets up their gate camps to mulch new players.
---
&lt;3
---
Great job guys! 
---
The fountain of salt just never stops flowing from you guys lmao
---
Ah yeah I know sv5 can be tricky, been awhile since I really swung through there though.  But I remember the "I made it through HED...wait...nevermind."
---
Superman does good. They are doing well. You need to learn your grammar, son.

As with every EVE-related question, the answer is "it depends". I mean, this is not a question that anyone can give you an answer to. Give it a try; it's literally free now and you can get a good feel for how the game plays as an alpha clone. If you want my opinion though, yes, it's quite worth playing. Many people will talk about recent nerfs, or how CCP doesn't listen, etc etc, and those are valid points, but it's definitely not as bad as people may tell you. Also sounds like there is some cool stuff on the horizon. 
---
Or “TNT continues to have no affect on anything “ 
---
Are you saying fighter drones don't have MWD back in your day?
---
I hear there are skill changes coming, are my skill queues fucked?
---
You can get Cube Bistot and Jaspet, some crokite. Between cube bistot and Jaspet i get enough mats in HIGH sec to do a thanatos. Personal project.
---
They had mwd that is similar to drone mwd, which A was not that fast B was sporadic at best and C caused the drones to miss their volleys due to their mechanics. 
---
Eh, it's more "willing to accept the loss, shit happens"
---
I own a few like that. 👍 Congrats
---
Talisman Curse will make it eat poop
---
Lol every one of my pve chars is -10 to br

With the ability to reship them a few more times if required

Drones tend to miss the first volley during their pursuit MWD cycle, that's normal. 
---
And their sig were tiny until the nerf bat after NSA https://forums-archive.eveonline.com/topic/512146/

I would love to scoop up some Triglavians to accompany my hookers OwO
---
You can fix that with tags
---
So, the thing is: its questionable whether this change in any way allows smaller groups to 'beat the blob.' The dread numbers at which the FAX stacking penalty starts to have a very serious effect on the ability of a super fleet to tank damage are 200-plus. Do you know many small groups that can field 250 dreads? Seems like a strategy that's mainly available to large blocs. 
---
I do think that this will make bloc fights a lot deadlier to both sides, which sounds good to me. But it's not reeeeeaaallly a buff to the little guy.
---
i have no complaint about it thanks for the info
---
cacique
---
Ok, so what's the problem then? All you do is grind isk anyway, why do you care how much PLEX costs?
---
when did it swing the first time?
---
Shit I got exposed.
---
Im ok with capital nerfs in that more shit will die, there will be larger risk vs reward of dropping caps on small fleets. Though i am in agreement with OP in that 10% is massive, maybe start with 25... if its still too much bring it down. As long as it is just tuning capital reps i think we are ok... if we are talking about all reps then maybe there is reason to get rowdy. I havent read the full extent of the notes just going off OP...
---
Anything that can make billions in a few hours and can tank 50 + ships deployed to kill it indefinitely should be removed. 
---
The adherents of the "Paradox of Tolerance," such as our dear Pillar here, are not known for their self awareness nor their ability to game out the long term consequences of actions and positions.  Engaging with them can be quite entertaining, when it not simply mindbogglingly violent or threatening.
---
Haulers drop strongboxes. 1 in maybe 20-30 barges drop eleras, sure there's more on loot table but it's rare in hisec. Lower meta mining mods are more common.
---
T2 haulers and t2 barges for some sweet t2 salvage, but rolling a retty fleet and a t1 hauler will still need an orca alt to haul ore. Get into it much and before long youll be compulsively checking for compression services in every system.
---
Handling the frig response fleets is pretty much like small gang pvp except they are way op, properly fit a 1.8b loki can permatank and handle neuting but youll be stuck scrammed till you get an alt in to help you break their logi's tank. Once you break logis you can make short work of the rest.
---
Leave at least 1 npc frig till you finish killing all the barges, for some reason if you kill the entire response fleet the mining fleet will despawn and disappear right out from under you.
---
Pretty fun actually if your the solo shitlord type. If you where stuck in a serious brawl like that with players in losec, theyd just escalate.
---
Thered be another 20 paragraphs of infos before you could jump in to the racket without overly risking your blingy loki/gila team, but I learned it all by trial and error have fun.

---
Alright, so go fuck yourself. Why didn't you just say this in the OP? You don't want PLEX to be expensive, and you also don't want to pay for your sub with real money. I bet you work for a call center scamming elderly folks in the 1st world.
---
Before citadel people still used carriers and supers to rat, back before carriers did 4k dps, supers did 8-9k ( against subs ) had the NSA for insane lock time and the bonus that came with fitting a single CSE to be able to passive tank sites for days. Fighters could be repped but you couldnt really carry spares, they didnt apply as well and had no abilities at all. 
---
this is a bad post
---
He's braindead and has no idea how an economy functions. He's asking for PLEX to be cheaper, not realizing the EVE economy is a free market and CCP doesn't dictate it. 
---
Lots of groups that just accept rorq losses as a tax on their income.
---
With saving my drones, a rorq pays for itself in like 10 hours easily.
---
You can want things while still expecting them to die.
---
Keepstars are useful, especially for smaller groups that use supers.
---
Bounties are pointless.  They do almost nothing.  It is a non issue and will not affect you at all.  Just wear it as a badge of pride that some idiot wasted that much isk giving you a cool banner on your picture.
---
&gt;Caps should completely shit on each other.
---
The problem is that dreads or carriers being likely to die is fine because they are very cheap.
---
Supers are a ridiculously large hit to an individual's wallet. Even with hull SRP you are talking 10b in fittings and implants easily.
---
I like the idea, but it will hurt the individual line member.
---
Exactly this. All of you complaining about the "entitled people" that didn't get their free SP - this is what it is about. It's bad customer service. Like really, shocking horrible service. If CCP was a mainstream company delivering a mainstream product and they pulled this - it would make international headlines.
---
I've always given ccp the benefit of the doubt, and I've always tried to see things their way, even when I didn't agree with them - but today I lost my respect for them. I'm really really disappointed. I want EVE and ccp to succeed so badly, but this is just not how you treat customers.
---
and in order to enter his giveaways you have to wait 2 hours from when it is started during those 2 hours all people viewing the stream will have earned more than enough points to enter the exact same number of times since it is limited to usually 2-4 tickets that any person can buy with points. extra points mean nothing to the give aways at all, therefore all viewers have the same chance to win the prize if they want to.
---
Yea, don’t worry about it. The “bounty” system is not what you think. People aren’t going to out their way to hunt you, plus it doesn’t give them the right to shoot you in highsec.
---
If you die, you were going to die anyway, they’ll just get some isk for it. :)
---
It's cooling that'll kill you in Space. Space is a Fantastic insulator, because there's nothing to keep you cold. You have to radiate heat to get rid of it _normally_ so now you have the problem of some guy in a swag jacket and swanky helmet trying to radiate heat in space. Probably won't work out well. 
---
 I doubt they are onboard the ships physically. I believe the suits are for us only and triglavians no longer have bodies just live in a construct.
---
Abaddon was always a heavy fleet ship, back before t3's and pirate bs became so prevalent it was the go to ship really. Abaddon was never meant for small gang type combat so it makes sense that it still isnt meant for that. This gives it a nice damage boost bringing it up to over 1k with drones easily while still being able to get 220k+ ehp.
---
Well it would take longer time just to PLEX. I will not be able to buy expensive toys like Jump freighters. I love hauling!
---
But we're talking about drone sizes 
---
Ohhhhhh you're not being facetious but actually believe that "racism" here is against the factions in eve- minmatar, amarr, etc. /S

honestly, id be surprised if the sansha havent been experimenting with going into abyssal space. its not like the filaments are hard to come by, and sansha has a history of fucking around with tech

Well you are just being prejudicial and judgemental! I can't really help it. If this makes you sleep better at night. And he was talking about himself in the comment while I was talking a bigger crowd. Though it is mentioned "it's about me" it came out in anger. But if you read the OP you should know better! 
---
I haven't had anything bad happen to me yet, so I don't know the pain of dying YET. lol.  I guess I'll just see how it goes then.
---
Thank you!
---
Why is everyone so negative? Shouldn't we just be happy that eve gets some attention on a major gaming website?
---
I am educated! Thanks for the info :)
---
Falcon, I'm really disappointed. I realize that you don't necessarily agree with the decision, and that as a ccp employee you have to follow the company narrative, but this is not how you treat customers.
---
Id rather ccp not promise anything and deal with upset customers, than do what they are doing now. The way you as a company are handling this is destroying customer trust and respect.
---
I know the vocal majority are all grrrr ccp at every opportunity, (mostly undeserved) but actions like these causes that group to grow for legit reasons.
---
I'm not mad, I'm just really disappointed in CCP, and it feels like a bond of trust has been broken between myself and ccp. 
---
That happened to me once before. We were in the midst of a POS takedown operation. I had to park my Hurricane in a mate’s carrier bay to haul back and suicide my pod back to the RIT triangle before I logged off.

Tbh they're probably trying to kill the skillfarm epidemic, and giving it out to all those shut down skill farms would be a nightmare. They just got to the point to where they're dying out, since MCTs are at parity with PLEX.
---
 
---
Guy in my corporation made 50-100b off of this move alone, people have skill farms of 200+ omegas.
---
interesting point mentioned is that they said that the "ancient domain beyond the flow" was lost to them. Not too sure what this implies. However, it does seem to me that this isnt so much a declaration of war, in fact they say that those who are "fit" can enter "the flow". 
---
He doesn't get ad revenue, he's not a partner.
---
Sansha are kinda unique for a few different reasons they hold unique drifter/talocoan(?) tech that allows them to manipulate WHs and thus allowing there "incursions" into low and null sec.  Also they are said to violate the one mind one body principle which is a big no no.
---
someone paid 15 bill for a hel? jesus the rest of the universe is getting shafted on super prices
---
Scrolled up three times to confirm that Vily wrote this. +1
---
That can be said for literally any change they would ever make. 
---
70% Neutresist sais no.
---
That's not what "full parity" means...
---
Soon with his viewer count.
---
The report him? 
---
One streamer breaking the rules doesn't justify another doing the same...
---
Don’t waste your ISK putting bounties on someone, unless you want a notification every time they die. 
---
Yep, all of the ABC ores as well as Ochre, Spod, Hemorphite, Hedber, Jaspet, can all be mined in high sec now with the right moon. You can only moon mine in 0.5 systems though. Also, you'll only find r8 moons, nothing higher. I forget if the +15% ores spawn or if it's all the same, and I also forget if the normal ores double just like the moon ore when you get a blue moon. 
---
i actually thought they did hk a few favors there... it even got that numbers narrative you guys love so much
---
When was this xD
---
But that's so haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaard
---
Shield slaves are great... but I want Hull slaves CCPLZ
---
I mean it would make for one hell of a trolly algos. I'd roll it.
---
what a devious plan to hide pvp pilots under the banner of TNT
---
I get you, but if your main goal is to plex your account why not? I completely understand where you’re coming from, I’m just trying to say that THERE IS ways.
---
cause why not have a 300k ehp bni
---
I feel totally related to the "Muh Rorq"-Dino and I m not ashamed.  
---
Muh Rorqs! /o\\
---
Trust me I have batteries like that and a 7.4 second cycle on a 400gj neut x 4 will cap out you out. Tested it with an alt friend. 
---
roleplay is not based in fun.
---
It's TNT they never had one relevant event in their history of existing that is notable on their own. 
---
Understood! Will try out exploration definitely! And thanks for not being toxic like many the fucked up assholes in this thread! 👍
---
&gt; If someone drops several hundred dreads on a super fleet, things should die.
---
Yes, but dreads should come with a price tag.  At the moment they're practically free.
---
It's TNT no need to form EVER for them. Just send 5 dudes and a broomstick over. They will fold like lawnchairs
---
Pve wise for imperium there is really no change. Rest of eve and botting capitals we will see...
---
What keybinds do you guys use? I think I'm going to get carpal tunnel from all the mouse clicking
---
"full parity" between free viewers and subscribers means they have an equal chance. To my understanding subs and frees have a identical chance of winning all viewers get 1 ticket for free and then watching the stream allows for purchasing the rest of the tickets, for the free viewers who join the stream late they can follow for free and get the required points to enter the same number of times as anyone else. 
---
Oh it’s normal on reddit from what I’ve seen, I feel like they’re mostly trolls trying to get a reaction and if they don’t they usually don’t bother. 
---
But to add some more to my previous post and even before any nerfs or anything, I tried mostly every aspect of pve for money making (I enjoy making isk) ratting was slow and if you got ganked or dc and lost a ship you got set back a fair amount. Mining was meh, abyss same story as mining, some others were just tedious but exploration was a different ball game for me. I could make the money for my 130m astero from just one site, occasionally I get a relic site worth 100-200mil, which is really not uncommon so you get the point.
---
^ This, really.  The proposal fucks up the balance too  much if i) dreads remain to insure so well that they're practically free to lose, and ii) supers/titans remain the only asset that can make a dent in an alliances pocket.
---
Nah, I'll just light a cyno and give easy content to our umbrella.
---
Yeah not VNIs after their nerf, it’s all Ishtars now!!
---
Raising the price of ice should make citadels more expensive to fuel, no?
---
Look you guys do what you want I’m just here to keep EOM and Blood Raiders at bay.
---
They're not just in the billboards. I hacked a citadel, and a much more garbled version of the broadcast is played there too during the hacking minigame!
---
I thought I was losing my damn mind. Or at least that my computer was throwing a conniption fit.
---
Obligatory can I have your stuff. 
---
But ya man it's tough ATM with Eve take a small break and you might get the itch again. Lot good games out there to play ATM and more coming like division 2, the Halo master chief collection coming to pc.
---
with it being FAX &gt; CARRIERS &gt; DREADS
---
I believe [mutaplasmid.space](https://mutaplasmid.space/) is the current go to for buying/selling outside of game
---
Yep, seems like I shouldn't worry about this. I thought every time I go out in my ship I'm at risk of it getting destroyed.
---
whats good for eve is good for TEST. to put it simply
---
Yeah they obscurity-tanked it.
---
I was reading his post and thinking
---
yes
---
vily
---
that's the goal
---
Is there a certain ship here that I should save up for? I suppose my favorite areas thus far are fighting and exploring. I initially thought I'd like trading/industry, but decided that wasn't for me. With noob turrets i've found the power in drones and really like ships with drones. I know about the don't buy what you can't afford rule, but isn't that what insurance is for?
---
The question is, why does everyone focus on this specific streamer? Seems like someone is jealuus, and  
---
wants his imaginary friends on reddit to help him. So in all honesty, if people start witch-hunts,  
---
they should get them all at the same time. And not try to get the same one, over and over again, don't u think?
---
How do I figure out what corp to join...I like the idea of Dreddit, but it would be nice what all the options are.
---
Prospect discovery is a science outsourcing program. It doesn’t mesh well with MMO testing
---
if only the changes addressed this too
---
ya we already had several discussion about just taking fax alts after 100 for dread alts
---
What role do supers fill that it makes it so critical that they be viable?
---
The funny part is that this doesn't affect skill farms, any long running ones got the SP.  Its the real players that started after the magic date, got sick of CCP's shit, or couldn't afford to sub and let their account lapse temporarily that gets fucked.
---
All of this is great and I like it, but maybe if krabbing were rewarding in any way other than just an increase in my wallet, and not brain-cancer-inducingly boring and grindy, it would be a lot easier to convince the average player to agree as well. And it would probably do some good for the botting problem as well.
---
C13s are shattered holes, and can be somewhat difficult to find by yourself as there are only 25 of them. Mining in NS is easy if you belong to the corp who owns the space, and very difficult if you don't. You're better off looking for a backwater LS system to mine in if you want to do so solo without competition.
---
just turn on the CC aka subtitles 
---
You are always at risk of being destroyed- that's the magic of Eve. However, the bounty doesn't really impact chance of you being killed.
---
But it's also not the start, since they've been nerfed before. Not arguing they needed more nerfing, but you'd think CCP would have paid very close attention and would have a much closer idea, if not perfect idea, of how to hit that balance now that they've had more than enough time to observe. Who knows maybe it will be perfect, but I've seen plenty of people bringing up valid points about how it might be a little heavy handed, which will undoubtedly hurt the small guys more than the big guys.
---
Its not jealousy. It's grrrgon 
---
Some will say to bring them back and reload. Do not listen to them. Use the missiles until gone, then just use guns for rest of site. Reload between sites.
---
Here's the top headlines...
---
- Somewhere, a big alliance is fighting with another big alliance
---
- Somewhere, CODE is ganking someone
---
- Rorq bots are single handedly responsible for inflation
---
- Public opinion polls show High Sec denizens think Null Sec denizens are all a bunch of bad asses
---
- Studies show Null Sec denizens are actually bigger care bear pansies than High Sec denizens, with highest ranking fear being "a strange face in Local" 
---
That's what I was figuring up to this point I was just using 1 missile per bs and alternating fighters. Was gonna give blowing all 12 early a shot to see if it increases my ticks
---
What a majority of these retards don't understand is that this is something streamers do across all games. 
---
They call it RMT because it's a goon. If this was an NC pilot or one of their pets. No one would give a shit. No threads would be made. 
---
You just gotta understand.  
---
Grrrgon. 
---
Ahh. Someone submitted proper subtitles. Thanks!
---
NC Bar****
---
Seconded. There were some spots where I rolled my eyes a little, but it told a good story about Eve and god knows we need those right now. 
---
r4*
---
I'm sure if CCP considered it breaking the terms and conditions that they would have banned Markee and other streamers years ago. Seems that this particular streamer made a few ppl ingame mad, by giving away expensive assets. 
---
True, but there is a difference between ratting, that you can do by yourself but helps to have corporate support, and running incursions, which are a fleet based activity and basically can't be done by oneself. 
---
fantastic job guys, really immerses me and makes me want to get back in the game
---
I just got the suck from WoW again, I should just give up the bullshit like League/Overwatch/Steam crap and go back to my high school years where I only played EvE and WoW lol
---
PCgamer articles are never well-received on r/eve. I think it has to do with the fact that they tend to dumb down and sensationalize Eve to appeal to a wider audience. This one’s not bad though. 
---
If you can’t PLEX more than X accounts, you don’t deserve to have those X accounts.
---
EVE is a free market economy. The price will come down only when more PLEX enters circulation and demand tapers off, and CCP can do little about it besides organize another plex sale which may cut into their revenue.
---
This is a rat race. The Rorqs and super ratting/ station trading players/whatever set the high bar for income and dictate the rate of inflation, and the rest keep up in whatever way they can. 
---
You can play harder and play smarter to carve out the future you want, or you can drop the accounts and accept that you don’t have the determination or will to maintain what you want to get.
---
As for your ‘proposed’ plan of having the PLEX stockpiles willingly sell their PLEX, you can’t expect other people to willingly take a loss for your own gain, when you have not impressed upon them why it is in their best interest to do so other than “oh won’t somebody think of the small guy, you have so much money on your hands please share some with me.”
---
Why can't we harvest implants from people like this yet ?
---
if I understand it correctly, the Russians were the second ones to reach New Eden, predated by whatever the Jove are
---
There are various resources such as r/evejobs or the recruitment section of the Eve Online forums. Most larger corps also have public channels in-game that you can talk tot hem in and hopefully get a feel for the corporation.  The best thing you can do is figure out what you want to do, then look for the people already doing it. A good explanation of how to do this can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/awzb03/casual_player_here_been_trying_small_corps_but/ehq97k5).
---
I mean, I could find out where you fly and come gank you with a few Catalysts, but yeah. You should be ok with the bounty. 
---
You're point is  true for 1 dude. It's not true for all dudes.
---
If all rorq owners ditched them in favor of super ratting, where would the glut of minerals that enable cheap supers come from?
---
In reality, as demand for super goes up (and demand for hulls in general remains constant) while the number of rorqs goes down, the mineral price will go up and super price will go up which will tilt things back towards the rorq.
---
No, and the changes have already happened. you can find the explanation [here](https://www.eveonline.com/article/po1p6y/patch-notes-for-march-2019-release), but essentally what happened is that most skill books got an increase in price, and you can now buy all NPC seeded skill books from your character sheet at a 30% markup.
---
I wonder what would happen if they increased mass a bit on Amarr ships, made them a bit slower but gave them more armor or little bit better resits, or both. This might give them some fitting freedom and increased armor tank would go well with the whole Amarr theme. 
---
Olmeca, is that you?
---
You are putting up a healthy argument which I wouldn't deny but I am not asking them to cut their flesh to let us live, just cut the down a bit on their margin if possible. And CCP can do nothing about the plex prices. Even after a couple of PLEX sales /discounts, prices are still up. And I agree without a valid reason they are not going to stop the inflation. And to explain why the inflation beyond this point is going to be bad would need more information, to be presented by me otherwise it would seem like a victim play / sympathy - earning post to all the fools out here! I will dig deeper into this mate! Thanks for not being toxic like the rest! Much appreciated for taking the time to share your thoughts in a humane way!
---
I don't know how much this helps, but I use a Logitech G600 mouse, which has 12 buttons under the thumb. I bind most of my non-combat hotkeys to that so I can do things like scan quickly one handed without needing to click everywhere.
---
yea dude!
---
Yeah go hunt more VNIs LoL
---
but aren't you PL pets?
---
Hey now, I have never been in Brave, but I salvaged during battle plenty of times. I used to literally bust out salvage drones and let them do their thing while orbiting with tackle. 
---
I also tried to salvage ships before they blew up, but the game didn't let me :( very disappointed about that.
---
I think the argument has been made many times that the moment you log in you’re rp’ing.
---
None moreso than the casual pvper wreaking havoc while having a laff on comms...capsuleers really are dark enough to laugh and have fun while brutally murdering innocents and miners...especially miners.
---
Rorqs cause deflation not inflation for everything that can be produced by players with the minerals they mine. Inflation is caused by bringing more isk into an economy, not raw materials.
---
&gt; "win by any means possible, even if it means ruining the experience"
---
Isn't that similar to the goons motto?
---
Wont stop the provi purification project
---
He streams, so he is "promoting" the game.  Yeah CCP wont harm him
---
Hey. Why are you calling me out???
---
&gt;For other groups though, it seems pretty clear that CCP wants to encourage actual tactical positioning in fights outside of the traditional one person lights a hard cyno and the blob enters the grid. 
---
You should ask panfam about that UALX positioning, it worked out pretty will for Test.
---
Why would anyone invade Syndi space?
---
By "bots" do you mean the drones you and your pets left behind after getting bent ?
---
I doubt this. They seem to not like augmentation, given by their poor view of drifters (rogue drone humans), Sansha slaves (humans under cybernetic mind control) and even capsuleers ("augmented" humans, not yet completely subjugated, who have to prove if they are worthy or not").
---
You have to know what you enjoy. This game is at its worst when you dont have friends online at the same times as you. Becomes virtually unplayable to me.
---
I'm an alpha player but i saved up enough isk yesterday an I'm going omega tonight without having used a penny on this game.
---
sounds like time for T3 navy BS... Navy Abaddon for small gang/solo ops, Federation Hyperion for fleet ops, Navy Rokh for solo/small gang and a RF Maelstrom for... something?
---
Legacy pilots
---
Good. Put some fear into the heart of the apex doctrine. I'm sure X titans will still be significantly stronger than X dreads, but now at a real risk.
---
Because half of eve owns one these days. 
---
Just LOL!!!
---
Ok sounds good
---
&gt;I like the idea, but it will hurt the individual line member.
---
That is 100% on that member though. What is Eve rule #1 ?
---
How long did it take for you mate? And what do you aspire to do in-game? 
---
If the nerf is significant enough for people to stop using nerfed ships then less shit will die
---
Glitch in the Matrix
---
I started playing in October, but I'd say I could get plex in about 2 weeks through nullsec exploration. I'd probably burn out at that rate of exploration, so I also get some isk through actually afk ratting and other things. 
---
I want to skill into bombers and a Stratios, maybe t3d's or t3c's all of those ships look cool and seem fun :D
---
No worries if we need to make up the number, we have plenty of bots.. 
---
the question is more, why weren't more people given the SP when the problems have persisted for the entire Year. Not 1 date... I have 3 accounts at the moment that have been active for 6-8 months (but only 1 at that date) But it has messed me up on all 3....shouldn't all 3 accounts get the SP then for dealing with this BS?
---

I wasn't saying that I enjoy intentionally killing new players. I'm just saying that just because an alliance has the word, "noobies" in it doesn't make them noobies. 
---
Everyone gets equal treatment imo, kill them all.
---
I would usually alternate the missile volleys 2-1-2-1 etc. also depends a bit on which enemies you are fighting, as the burst damage from the missiles could help against the enemies repair cycle to blap them faster. 
---
Alternating the missiles used to fit perfectly with rock havens so they would all be spent when finishing up the site. I used the Nidhoggur, and would get 50-75m ticks in a well tanked fit.
---
Basically the only time they'll be used now is in those fights with so much TiDi and server crashing that you're playing the login screen game more than the actual game.  PRAISE BOB
---
You still winning eve? I saw a comment a while back where you mentioned that you were :(
---
Yeah what's tiresome is that I'm totally here for a civil and productive discussion. There's just too much bitterness and hatred projected by the average person here to have an actual discussion though. 
---
I used to play with the null response fleets in delve in a carrier. It was risky and chewed through t1 fighters, but the trick was to dps down the battleships through the reps starting with the bhaalgorns. 
---
Then the apocs. Each one took full missile salvos and had to be reset if fighters were targeted.
---
Then, to break the logi required you to hit a ship for a bit, and let the logi get 40+km out. Then split the fighters between the logi. This caused them to seperate. Eventually they go out of rep range and you can kill them. After that I could kill the cruisers, then the frigates. 
---
It just required 30 minutes being warp scrammed, and gave no reward.
---
If you can afford a Titan you can afford a FAX.
---
Those who never tried ratting in a super shouldnt talk shit to other (bots) ratters.
---
You decycle nsa after every first use. You genius. So you activate nsa first time as you land in anom and instantly turn it off. 10 sec later sabre jumps into system and warps to your "nsa decycled super" - you try to warp... but you cannot warp.. how tf?! Well maybe if you werent as dumb as you were you should have figured it means shit to decycle nsa. It doesnt work that way. If only you thought about that for a minute. But i guess thats too much for the smoothbrains that have been shit talking lately.
---
Couple things, first you can board an empty ship without ejecting and getting the double session change timer. 
---
2nd you could have scooped that barge cus he ejected to chase after the orca (like why?)
---
As others have pointed out, bounties are pointless. If someone kills you, they will get a bit of money from the "bounty pool" based on the value of your loss. If you are in high sec space people can't kill you unless you've done an act of aggression to get a criminal timer yourself. This means that if they were to attack you - Concord would be killing them - known as suicide ganking. Usually suicide ganking is not worth it unless you're carrying something very expensive and the bounties wouldn't encourage this anyway.
---
Regarding the free-to-play alpha mode. That should be able to keep you occupied for a long time! You will be able to experience many things even without omega status. Although, they have just removed level 4 and 5 PvE missions from Alpha state clones - so high sec mission running income has been reduced for alphas. You should still be able to get a decent income from scanning and anomaly running though!
---
No, by grinding lvl 1 missions for half a year.
---
Lol I didn’t even realize he ejected from the barge. As for boarding ships in space I think I’ve done that probably twice in all my years of playing eve.
---
Absolutely. We take our wormhole location clients very seriously and have a strict no-interference policy as we make the handover and get you into your wormhole. We are known for being many things in our rather light-hearted approach to New Eden/Anoikis, but our commitment to Customer Service: V means our agents are bound to honor their word when agreements are made with customers. You can find out more about our wormhole location services through our in-game channel "WDS Locators".
---
And in the middle of the site? Its basically like a siege/indy core.
---
LOL good call - I sat there staring at it for a second after I typed it feeling like something was off 
---
#include "IRC.h" 
---
This is pretty , like really pretty 
---
Just straight up give us back the fucking watchlist @CCP no reason at this point to lie and say it wasn't a nerf.
---
There should never have been FAXes&amp;insurance for caps in the first place. Caps/Supers need to die. Titans should be strategic alliance assets used with care and not a personal fun ship you just buy cause you got more money than brains... 
---
99,9% of the time it wasn't worth the effort to come to highsec to "fight" against the scummy tactics used by wardec groups. Now there is always a reason: to kill their War HQ. 
---
If youre ratting in a carrier/super with hostile sabres able to lurk up on you that quickly you deserve to die, sorry. Just because it isnt poasible for every mouthbreathing nerd with a pulse to stay alive for near risk free iskprinting doesnt mean its a bad thing.
---
People act like they have to run the NSA constantly to run sites. They don't, and all the hysterics over "but we will be trapped in 1 minute siege cycles!" Is ridiculous. You'll be at risk certain times, yes, but that doesn't matter for shit really. Its equivalent to not being aligned while ratting in your super and no one banged the drum before
---
Also thanks for noticing my genius I feel sometimes as if I dont get the respect I deserve around here.
---
Eve is crazy sometimes... There's a site for everything 
---
That poor fucking pod chasing it as a leshak gang swoops in and grabs it....
---
One of our fleets bumped a nyx out of tether last week. No POS shield to stop you.
---
wow youre cool
---
I had this mouse! It was amazing. The third mouse click button was great. 
---
The implants I never knew I needed.
---
The tutorial lessons provided by wardeccers were too harsh too soon? Look I'm a total newbro as well. Got ganked flying on autopilot through Hsec. Is that stupid? I don't think so. It's only stupid once you know better but you keep insisting you should be able to do so.
---
So lesson learned for me. I actually love the fact that I'm a small fry with lots to learn bout the game and the outside world feels dangerous. When my current modus operandi stops to yield positive results for me. I try something different. Its a great opportunity to learn. I really can't sympathize with the idea of a safe zone in this game.

I disagree there.  I still get constant disconnects from the chat server every time I log in, as my last thread pointed out.
---
I'm running a nid right now and gonna upgrade to t2 fighter supports and throw in another drone damage. Around 2200 dps I think with t1 templars. Trying to justify null living and haven't seen benefits yet but hopefully these changes will be enough XD
---
TEST super don't commit to a super vs super fight unless goons are coming, all this changes is they won't commit unless goons are there.
---
Yes you seem like a neutral and disinterested observer. Anyway, don't let me distract you from contemplating how your parents regret having you every day of their lives. ttfn.
---
I use the term in its most inclusive sense.
---
The changes to FAX are great. 
---
Blocs will now be tentative in using their supers/titans as theirs a real counter to them now, shifting the focus onto subcapital fights. Which is the whole point, I guess. FAXs in huge numbers are ridiculous and the scaling **should** be punishing. 
---
Re: rorquals the PANIC mod isn’t going to change a whole lot - the rorqual needs to be redesigned to be honest. Would have liked to see the industry core becoming something like the new NSA, albeit with an agility nerf to slow align time, allowing us to nerf PANIC (or get rid of it) further. 
---
I have a feeling these changes might force certain groups to think more carefully who they attack and not just randomly wardec everything. If you annoy people too much with unsavory tactics you might anger wrong groups and get all your war hq's blobbed to hell every time you try to set up one.
---
I'm not talking about the past. The post is about my suggestion that gives incentive to fight to end the war. I assume you didn't read the section containing my suggestion, but read it.

I think win conditions are good for wardecs.

Who?

Maybe he meant inflation of materials, but again this could be a good and a bad thing regardless..

Hey what do you know, goons hiding behind the "*it's actually fine, people only complaining about* blatant RMT *because grrr goon*" excuse again. In other news, water is wet.

Level 1 and 2 are possible without much risk, Level 3 is riskier (i lost one there but i have to admit it was also because of a piloting error from me).

To add on to /u/firedrake915, if you really want to be safe hacking sites check for activity in the Wormhole first. While there is a lot of 3rd parties going into Wormholes to camp Relic/Data Sites or Wormhole entrances, it can also be someone living there. Check DScan first for Citadels, warp to them (at 100km) and check for people inside (right behind the Citadel name tag you'll see a number in brackets \[2\] &lt;- like this, which shows you the playercount inside. On high numbers you might want to be more careful). 
---
Choose holes far away from Tradehubs like Jita/Amarr! Those are often camped (looking at you WiNGSPAN :\^) ), best is LowSec somewhere with only little jumps. This might also have the sideeffect of getting more/better loot btw..
---
Added to that you should spend the least time possibile in a Site, doing so will give Hunters the least time possibile to set up a ping or think of a strategy. Also go for the highest value cans first (Databanks for Data Sites; Ruins for Relic Sites) as those cans are the main attack points for Hunters as you usually spend most time on these, and maybe leave one low value can in the Site as the last can is probably the second most attack point and no one would expect you to just moonwalk out of a site.

There was recently a good post about that on this sub, try searching for shortcuts or something
---
There will be a slight drop, but I bet you anything you like there will still be plenty of ratting carriers and supers and mining rorqs after the patch drops. It just means generally people will be more careful and not venture out if the super umbrella, but there will still be plenty of morons happily NSA ratting in their supers.
---
What will happen though is that people just will not use their titans, why would you risk them when a dread bomb spam can wipe them out for a fraction of the price. Also I agree with you about the ice mining nerf it is dumb, structure filing prices will go up and it double hits rorqs because the heavy water price/time to mine goes up they could at least have dropped that by 20% to compensate.

I know the name is in the title, but it doesn't mean you need to be dicks. 8 responses to this comment so far, all attitude, not one adding anything useful.
---
[Here you go mate.](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Derelik/Camal)
---
yikes, someone is upset
---
Yes but that is just one part of the balance changes happening. 
---
Those rorquals I’m safer areas are being hit with yield nerfs. 
---
At the same time carriers and supers which are often used to try and killed booshers in those areas are getting application nerfs so they will die less often. 
---
There’s a multitude of changes happening at the same time and looking at one in isolation is like thinking jita is the sole solar system in eve. 
---
You should get used to it. Soon. Everyone dies in this game. A lot. Considering they undock (if you stay docked all the time doing market PvP, then you should be relatively safe). 
---
wtb much bigger image
---
For this year
---
hey, there's only so much a single u\_int can do :(
---
Those are all good fits. The only recommendation I have is that if you are on an omega account you should swap one set of drones out for a set of EC-300s. They are often the difference between getting away or getting caught. Also, if you have the ISK to spare and don't like to refit to do a data site, you can always use an integrated analyzer such as a Frostline 'Clavicula' Integrated Analyzer. It is rather expensive though and aside from ghost sites I'd not bother running data sites at all, so you shouldn't need to refit to often with a PvP fit anyways.
---
Nice!
---
Yeah I'm sure there will be some managing of how we do wars, but we'll see.
---
Make them bigger so people notice them more
---
You were the one who paid 100 robux for this. Ill get the logs
---
The narrative here doesn't make sense as presented by TEST. "This is super good for us BTW, we're just thinking of the smaller, newer alliances with panic and RR scaling!" and when actual small/new grouoa respond in the thread with how this actually benefits them, they are then told that the remote rep stacking doesn't effect them because it only matters at the scale of hundreds so they should shut up.
---
So what is it? It can't be about the new alliances because logically it doesn't make sense. It's a known fact that PGL and TEST Leadership along with SkillU and Capqu were the biggest detractors of the FAX nerfs in September, which granted needed work, but they posed strong opposition to the ones announced at Vegas also.
---
It's not a coincidence that capqu and Skill U especially are amongst the most risk averse groups in the game when it comes to risking supers.
---
This is just TAPI and Skill U once again pushing for supers and titans to not die and be able to risk much less. 
---
Never heard of blue relikers and log off sabres huh.. 1 min siege matters more than you can possibly think of. No more aligned insta warps with NSA. Before only way to catch half brain dead supers was to get into system in their mid warp or if they bounce of the rock anom. Now they will die a shitton more. Basically fixed safe super ratting. Very good cap balance imo overall from ccp.
---
Several things:
---
* Insurance generally doesn't apply for any ship that's faction or TII.
---
* Especially if you're new, you're very likely to lose your ship. You should have the mentality that you're spending money on something disposable that you're going to regularly replace. What can you afford to replace every time you play the game?
---
* It often doesn't matter what ship you are in. Being in a bigger/more powerful ship is *more* dangerous, not less. Especially noob players get killed in crappy ships and think the solution is to get in a bigger/more powerful ship in which they would have won had they been in that ship instead. EVE doesn't work like that.
---
&gt; Good for them for trying to PVP!
---
We try. But it is hard to hit all those small buttons on the screen when i am high and drunk af everytime i play. :D
---
Did FC just say jump? I am sure he did, ok i am jumping.......
---
Same here. The only thing i regret is not starting sooner.
---
Yeah, I imagine that.
---
&gt; I'm glad you like to try to bait and kill us. It can be rewarding if done properly.
---
Thanks I colleted the rewards many times :)  
---
&gt; Understand that the network of scouts and intel we use to operate effectively is so that we can see what is coming. This means we can see if another Highsec merc group is trying to setup a trap for us just as well as the hauler casually coming to Jita. Losses happen and we accept that, because we're subjected to the chance of it happening anytime we think that the hauler we're killing is harmless. 
---
I am not denying the use of alts and etc. They are accepted in game rules and there is no reason to deny this fact. I am focusing on the part that wardeccers claim that they are sustaining guerilla warfare, since they are not. Almost all wardeccers (exceptions happen time to time) focus on Jita, Dodixie and Amarr hub undock and gates. They are deccing all corporations they see coming in and out and they just destroy their ships effortlessly while claiming that they are elite pvpers and putting hard work on it. Maybe you are different then these usual habbits and making proper effort to hunt your wartargets but almost all wardeccers just undock from hub and camp the undock without any effort and anything to lose. This is very risk averse way to make profit. While other hisec residents are subject to risk of being ganked, wardecced and losing their assets (structures and ships) while they are trying to make some ISK (which is of course understanbly lower then lowsec and nullsec income), wardeccers make ISK much easily.
---
I personally monitor one corporation unanchoring their structures whlie joining PIRAT (before the first wardec change previous year) so they won't have anything to lose on space. This is the part we have a problem with. While hisec corporations and capsuleers accept the low income due to low risk (and for the love of Bob, if anyone says that "leave hisec" ,"come to sov/null" "hisec pvp sucks" please ECM him/her first and kill him/her last), wardeccers enjoy higher (then usual) income with lower (then usual) risk. So this is about to balance this income/risk ratio.
---
I have a theory that, as the name "mutaplasmid" suggests, and how its hypothesized the triglavians were once a part of the jovian civilization, they have a technological skill at mutating themselves like bacteria. The bioadaptive suits of the actual triglavians could be like the wall of bacteria, and in certain environments allow them to be in complete stasis.
---
They probably dont use capsules themselves, maybe instead communicate with their ships without having to shove cords in their brain and spines like the matrix.
---
It can barely fit 1 heavy neut, so I have no idea what you are on about
---
Ships shouldn't die because they're expensive wah wah wahhhh
---
Just adapt
---
This is the problem with CCP's reeree method of "drop 20-50% nerfs every 2 years".  They obviously don't understand the implications of their own changes, and frankly there are far too many variables when so many large changes are made at once for things to work out as expected.  This is why (good) developers make smaller changes often, to see how they work.  
---
CCP even admits the players always do things they never even thought of, yet somehow are still presumptuous enough to release a ton of huge changes all at once, probably not to be touched for a year, and think its just all gonna sort itself out.
---
Always.
---
Yeah unfortunately the hunting part of wars has severely declined. When I first started in wars that's all I ever did was hunt - add to watchlist, run locates, send scout, setup trap, and profit. It was a ton of fun and allowed me to learn how to do things like multibox, provide cloaky warpins, and such that would benefit me in other areas of space that I went on to get experience in...
---
Today it's not so much like that it was back then, thanks to the removal of the watchlist. I love hunting a stalking... choosing someone or a few people to be the center of my attention and doing what I can to hunt them. I wish some form of functioning watchlist would come back, but I also understand why people had an issue with it. Shame that the few that were abusing the Log Server were the reason why CCP removed it like they did.
---
Wars are only as profitable as people make them. There's no guarantee that people will be a loot pinata and even if so, that the loot will even drop. It is good ISK just because we do it right on the busiest trade hub in Highsec, but I guess I feel differently about the risk part.
---
Is there no risk because of the mechanics or because people aren't interested in trying to kill us? You know very well that it's possible to bait and kill us, so why don't more people do it more? Well I really can't tell you the answer to that, but we're always thinking that something is bait but ends up just being another regular dude in an Orca.
---
I'll say this though, I don't think I would have such hesitation about structure based content if CCP allowed booshing in Highsec with it. That way you have some kind of dynamic strategic value in skilled gameplay that doesn't just immediately reward whomever can bring the larger fleet.
---
I'm excited about the changes and how it'll shake things up!
---
I fully agree to what you said. ECs are very useful (guess I forgot something, wups)
---
Nobody cares.
---
Because they're the only thing in EVE that takes any kind of effort to earn, if you make them useless you're going to have a lot of people losing interest.  Flying a super is "end game" for a lot of people.  When every fight turns into mindless Ferox grinds that mean absolutely nothing, people get bored pretty fast.
---
I suggests we change Diminishing Return Rep Nerf (DRRN) to Diminishing Application Rep Nerf (DARN). 
---
As for the rest, I'm never in fights that are big enough that this change would be relevant.
---
Imagine he had three. Imagine that in 2019.
---
Jovian space maybe?
---
Strictly speaking they don't, but in practice they do.  Since dreads are a reactionary force that rarely actually drop, if you main a dread your gameplay 95% of the time consists of sitting docked, doing nothing.  Players don't like to just sit docked, doing nothing...well, except maybe if you're in NC.
---
Plenty of combat carriers will use NSAs. One minute while aligning is very different from five and immobility like dreadnoughts have.
---
In PvP it's worth the tradeoffs.
---
The only positive thing I guess is, I have no reason to complain unlike the vets and I’m actually enjoying the game the way it is..
---
Year long prep on goons batphone? Next time just use jabber insteas of piggles Post.
---
its a large, wont fit a shuttle, gotta stick it in a bomber or something that you can hide far from Dscan range 
---
And hull-repair logis!
---
Lol “We don’t want pvp in 2019” Right? This is Eve: Ratting &amp; Mining 
---
😂
---
Division 2 will only be slightly better than Anthem. Everyone who played Division 1 will get bored within a Month.
---
And the whole post is about fact that PVP carriers will still use the NSA , but PVE will not. 
---
Aand what we can do to persuade PVE people to still use it and provide content.       
---
Tbh my whole point here, **PVE carriers will use Sebo as they don't want PVP**         
---
NSA will be forcing it on them as it will keep them on spot.          
---
Welcome to CCP "balance".  They've always done it, they have no idea how to make gradual changes, and it ALWAYS explodes in their face.  Look at the original rorqual buffs for proof of that, years later they're still doing 20% nerfs every year to try to get it back in control.  That is absurd.
---
PvE carriers will have to decide whether it's worth it, without having one the lock time on frigates is insane, even with scripted faction sebos.
---
Example:  
---
Skills 5 Nidhoggur  
---
With neither sebo nor NSA: 93.8mm  
---
With NSA: 562mm  
---
With 2x scripted faction sebo: 242mm
---
If you lose the NSA, lock times are cut in half. Losing the NSA also costs slots that normally go to drone navs or tank. So PvE fit carriers already have an incentive to use NSAs after the change - higher ticks and better tank.
---
Guess you will have to just reprogram your bots.
---
It's not a PHEW keepstar now though - they dropped the corp from the Alliance so the killboard remains green.  
---
Weaker than now?  Yes.   Weaker compared to other entities post-change?  No.
---
&gt;numbers narrative
---
Fact.
---
But only for those that can actually count.
---
Whatever your opinion on CODE is, that Orca deserved to get stolen.
---
I get what you mean, it makes sense. 
---
But what I was trying to say is everyone is so focused on ratting, mining and other effortless/mindless activities that they forget what this game is about(just like any other), having fun. 
---
&gt; eleras
---
what is eleras?
---
Have you bug reported them? If so, what's the ebr numbers, so I can wave it at the appropriate people?
---
What are eleras?
---
As the writer of this piece I agree with that. There is a certain style to writing for a non-Eve publication. You definitely have to focus on that sensationalist side to things and tell a story instead. Take the difference between a documentary about WW2 and Saving Private Ryan for example.
---
I also wouldn't say 'dumbed down'. It's more that certain aspects of the game are made obscure or generalised. A Magus is "another ship" to avoid having to describe it and gate-cloak is "temorary cloaking" to avoid a full sentence on one tiny mechanic. There are some explanations and I certainly rolled my eyes at my own writing sometimes, but it's usually necessary here to tell such a story.
---
I should probably mention that my opinions are my own and not those of PC Gamer. :P

---
wouldn't fix botting; botting would adjust to d-scan instead, and thus would be more suited than players to pve (unless you go hunting with the un-dscannable ships, but then that'd hurt actual players as much - or even more, as they actually lost something while for bots it's just a statistic)
---
Oh ok, thanks !

That's really cool! :D
---
Imagine being able to put up billboards in our own space and spam all our members with 1984'ish homemade propaganda. CCPls
---
You are asking for 'the price to drop'. Do you even know how market works? There are a lot more important things in the world that people in developing countries can use if 'the price drop'... Medicine, food etc. Yet prices of these critical stuffs remain determined by market.. That is the way capitalism/markets work. May be you can ask for the Indian Government to subsidize PLEX? 
---
There is a discord for it.

Thanks!

"Outiside the strugle" = outside of abyssal space ? So we can imagine a faction with a LP store of some sort ? Or maybe redloot trading against some implants ?

My Tengu named Jester's Trek flew through all of Null Sec. Then I retired that ship to my hangar, fitted up another Tengu called Wanderer, but swapped out the rocket launchers for festival launchers and for the first 3 months based in Thera I explored around 100 wormhole systems. Unfortunately, in order to get through the small wormhole connections, I had to switch to a frigate. Tengu best goo, love that ship. :)
---
For modules, top row: Q-R, middle row: A-F, bottom row: Z-V. Rebind drones to G, d-scan to space. That way your module positions correspond to key positions a lot better.

\*Stares in Triglavian\*  
---
Delet this
---
Actually this change noting for any bot (if you use sebos)
---
Well by being jumpstable you are only vulnerable for 1min and with intel channel you can most of the time erase that time to the only threat who always were wormholes.
---
When I farmed with my hel, I always had a prober in system and stop farming and aligning until the cosmic signature was identified.
---
Super ratting is juste a little bit less safe but for most people under super umbrella, they will change into a tank jumpstable fit. So more supers farming with tank fit should decrease the time for the response to the time you need to log your fax alts.
---
Of course lazy people will die more but bad pve supers deserve to die.
---
As a super farming pilot, I glad that they make it less safe.
---
Abyssal mods are OP as fuck. I have a scram on my Marshal, with Blacks ops V I get a 3 point scram at 24km.
---
Put the same mod on a Malediction? 40km.
---
Look, all I'm saying is, maybe we should all just really consider orienting ourselves with the flow.
---
Well good luck mate! T3Cs are going to take some skill and experience. By the time you get your hands on a T3C or T3D I guess you would have loads of experience but isk would be a problem. 
---
Sadly, you have either skimmed through and not understood the OP or you have not read it at all! Please read it! :-)
---
I do not have a super. I own a rorqual and just one rorqual pilot with two other toons. 🥴
---
Well within a year it has reached to levels it shouldn't. If it had turned to become 2bn at 2020. I guess it's understandable but the plex prices have been increasing at an alarming rate which I guess even you know! An old eve vet like you would definitely know better than me! Don't you agree that it has been increasing at an abnormal rate?
---
nah
---
Understood, I guess I'll do some explo soon! Hope to meet you during exploration! 
---
One Hel of a pilot checking in 😂
---
Simply brilliant, I love moment like this :)
---
Isn't the carrot better tics then not using one? I'd love to see another reason for carriers to use a module that scrams them in a site for 30 sec, but honestly, even if we came up with the perfect carrot, CCP isn't likely to change their mind on a balance pass that hasn't even happened yet. (Unless it looks to break something important, and sometimes not even then.)
---
Duly waved.
---
As far as I'm aware, they've fixed the vast majority of issues, so hopefully they can get to the bottom of this one too.
---
I should have looked at OPs name before reading this.
---
So much salt for free, this is amazing... where do you krab again?
---
Nope because no one will be dumb enough to use it... super and carrier ratting is now pointless.  With the changes to spawn rates again and the time it takes to lock up rats bot worth it.  There is no way I'll be activating NSA when you cant warp and you cant dock.  Fuck that..  better sell that super
---
So, Triglavian Capitals incoming?
---
Tech 2 Vedmak? Seems like it.
---
Again you are talking about how you bought plex when you had no food. I am not saying you had it easy. It is not about you or anyone showing sympathy. Throw your sympathy bullshit into the trash. You want a healthy discussion let me tell you this! I guess after studies you must have started working. I am not sure how you are doing for yourself. I really hope you do good, even though you are being mean. Point is after work you would not be able to spend much time playing EVE, same happens to me but sadly I cannot afford to plex accounts if it goes at this rate. Listen I am not asking for anybody here to pay for my subscription. So sympathy is out of the picture. I am just requesting the market giants to lower the price a bit. Even 1.6bn per account was  easier to pay is all I am saying. Don't you think the same way? I have no reason to hate you. But for some reason you try to see me as a person trying to gain people's sympathy which is a clear no no. Please understand that plex has been increasing at a rate which is beyond control. Yeah plex prices have risen earlier but this rise in plex price is abnormal! Think clearly, please do not hate me for raising a concern. If I am wrong feel free to correct me I am open for suggestions but just read my OP one more time before you get mad at me. This is a request! 
---
Are u fucking crazy or have you not read my OP and just showering hate on this thread? I did not ask CCP to do shit you dumb fuck. I was talking to the market giants. Fucking spend a couple of mins reading the OP before u take your bitter ass up here and talk about me! You are fucking brain dead for all I know!

Hi, Avenger-iwnl!

-PunyCapsuleerNotLookingForSympathy
---
Have you actually ever ratted in a super whilst not being shit at it? You kill shit so fucking fast that you better run that NSA non stop because you run out of locked targets in less than 20 seconds.
---
Do Ancient Domains refer to anoikis?
---
Now this is free salt. Anyways you can be as much salty as you want. You have no clue who controls the market or you have not read the OP.  I am tired arguing with people who would not listen to the other side making their statement! Anyways have a good day mate!
---
Is there anything to stop a rorqual from simply having 2 depos out 6km apart after excavators receive their size increase?
---
[removed]
---
Which gives them worse tank and inability to instalock let's say a Saber.
---
Sounds pretty fair to me
---
Is that blow or meth ?
---
Basically even under large super umbrellas they will die because of fax reps being nerfed. Bombers bar being able to kill supers with loads of bombers. Eve is finally going in the right direction
---
just remove local
---
Wouldn't the carrot on the stick be the fact they've had cruiser and better lock speed? 
---
Faction sebo’s will increase in price so damn much that people will just stick to an NSA. Some speculators already bought every single on driving them up to 200M each.
---
Okay kid... Take your 500k and be happy
---
Also increases T2 Prices indirectly as reactions now become more expensive.
---
The real solution here
---
Sorry I didn't follow the changes announced, how much are they getting neefed?
---
But tanked fit + fax + response fleet + super pilot with brain and correct reaction time and the super will survive.
---
I saw that there are new implants announced so if there are shield implants every pve super should have them.
---
Dreadbomb drap against not bug enough response fleet will be see more often I hope.
---
But yes, even as a pve super pilot I'm glad of those changes,even if I'm currently winning but null pve was far too safe.
---
What I do is use 1 single missile plus guns on all battle ships till the last wave, on the last wave if done correctly you should have about 6 full sets of 3 missiles, on the last wave use full sets plus lasers, I find this clears a site much faster than just blowing through all your missiles right away.
---
posting it once is enough 
---
Thirdly, there was a Dread Guristas small wreck unlooted in the field next to where the Orca was originally.
---
Could have also just dropped the stuff from the cynabal into the fleet hangar, but I digress.
---
Honestly, no idea yet, but probably Triglavians have or had more space regions under them
---
Triglavian incursions?
---
Sounds like Triglavian incursions time to me. 
---
TNT is just a cocksucking CFC pet, like it always was. 
---
Heal team six percent of the reps it used to have
---
Yes, You can't anchor another mobile depot less than 50km away from another :)
---
Some sebos are available from LP stores - they will drive prices down, also Sentient Sebos ... they drop pretty well.      
---
You can also use T2 versions until price stabilize. 
---
Not in case of PVE and case of keeping you on spot for 1minute. 
---
Sorry for wanting to keep carriers sitting on anoms with NSA active. 
---
Faxs are getting less efficient reps te longer they rep same target, thus even if you have 10 fax on grid repping super, with 200 reps (which is really small for 10 fax to do considering 3 reps per fax and their fast cycle time) they are gonna have like 10% rep efficiency after those 200 combined reps thus making it rep like only 1 fax instead of pre nerf 10.. sorry for explaining badly
---
Sorry but whole point of using SEBOS is to warp off instantly when someone show ups on local.    
---
So i don't know why you include locking the sabre into this equation.  
---
You forgot that in them huge fights supers hardly pose any kind of threat since in 10% tidi, which is normal in those fights you can control fuck all, not to mention fighters. Dread on the other hand jumps, siege, f1 and wait, no effort needed, can be done by trained monkey. Same goes for tits, try to aim lance in tidi. Dread is just a offshoot glass cannon.
---
Question is how much better ticks will be, it is not that you lose 50% of the ticks due to this.  It will be 10-15% at most, unless people will find interesting idea how to overcome this issue. 
---
You don't even try, don't you. 
---
Wow, so hardcore!
---
Fuck off, noone cares.
---
Can someone in the know break down the effect of the VNI nerf for me? Just picked up my first VNI last week and I can really convert that nerf to numbers.
---
I guess slower drones will lower the holy tick rate(?) but any good guesses on how much it will be? And is there an effective counter to this? I guess a 25% speed reduction will be hard to counter.
---
And is the sig increase enough to negate the 100NM speed tank? Will it have a significant effect on damage taken?
---
Will this make other options like Myrm more viable?
---
And the big one, Is this nerf large enough to change the current afk VNI meta?
---
Thank you! &lt;3
---
I mean, you only have your alliances to blame for not wanting to risk their super assets more.
---
Really great. Would love to see the other faxes like this too
---
it nerfs their profit...but everyone elses also

Seed a market toon with 1 billion isk. With some work and knowledge if how to manipulate market dufferences between buy and sell orders, coupled with movement, you should ba able to double that isk in two weeks according to how hard to work at it. 
---
PI is pretty damn profitable too if you can do it in a wormhole or nullsec. Low risk, decent reward without a huge investment in skills for decent passive income. 
---
no fuck, I can not ... for almost a year my stay in Iceland incompetent whore developer commonly known as CCP toyed with my life using different forms of pressure, sometimes as disgusting as your nickname fucking idiot ... in response to this I grabbed the pen and I wrote about everything that happens around ... and that's how an incompetent whore developer decided that based on what he writes and what he presents, and they knew it perfectly because they were embracing and invigilated me from every side ... he decided to make up with himself yet one rase to your game in which fuck I did not even play because it is a fuck like your idiot fucking idiot ... and now they are inventing yet an inheritance with the participation of this invented race which was created from a set of MY texts and behaviors .. but not a whore. .. so fucking worm will come and teach me who the Triglavians are ... I fuck you what a sick fucking world
---
We're down the fucking rabbit hole, folks.
---
Hi, todd10k!
---
I just stopped by to offer you a robot hug and wish you well!
---
Slower drones means lower ticks and more drones left behind when you warp out because a neutral shows up. You may also lose drones if rats primary them due to time to recall. The sig radius nerf is rather small (ship size being increased by roughly 7%). This may hurt people who are barely tanking as is, but for the most part not much will change and the VNI will still be a capable ship for ratting. Though the PvP fits aren't quite as good now :(
---
Brilliant. this is what a massive hack attack for propaganda would look like in eve universe. 
---
As stated above, yea they have plenty of room for a full flight. However, a full flight generally costs 4-5 Billion isk for 5 if them. 
---
haha. Good bot :) Give it to the guy above me though, i think he needs it more.
---
Are you off your meds?
---
no, the minimum distance between 2 depos is [6000m](http://prntscr.com/my78es)
---
it appears that most Eve players do not have to work on the following monday... sadly I do
---
I use the same method and get roughly 55 mil tics in a niddy with t2 fighters in -0.7 space. 
---
that would be hilarious
---
Off the top of my head they are really rare Mining Laser Upgrade modules
---
500k skill points!!!! “I’m rich bitch”!!!!
---
Yeah, bounties don't really mean anything, although they do look really cool.

&gt; You know very well that it's possible to bait and kill us, so why don't more people do it more? Well I really can't tell you the answer to that, but we're always thinking that something is bait but ends up just being another regular dude in an Orca. 
---
I can tell you a reason. As you also accept that wardec evolved into camping at hubs, and even we bait them there, you can easily see 3 OOC Nestors/Guardians undocking to protect the wardeccer ship and if you engage the Nestors with a fleet your in-corp logistics goes suspect too. And interestingly, like there is an unspoken arrangement between baiters/wardeccers, suspect nestors are omitted but people at the jita undock began shooting incorp logistics. That is why baiting in hubs don't work very well since wardeccers either dock up or just undock numerous OOC logistics. 
---
Baiting at gates works better but with similar outcome. Although it is somewhat easier to destroy wardeccers at gate. Although most of them stick at hub undocks. Although I agree that, sometimes we have some rare hunter wardecs that make incursions into defender's home system and/or locations. 
---
The problem was that current wardecs are not diverse and somehow reduced/evolved to camping trade hubs and routes at choke points with very low risk and higher profit potential. I am not sure whether the changes will bring some more action or not, but it is probably add some diversity into war mechanics where defenders can have an objective ; kill the War HQ and secure the peace. Personally I like the idea (and I was one of the capsuleers in WarDec Discord offered a similar structure &amp; war HQ system before this changes) and to be honest I think there is still room for progress; namely objective based war system. 
---
Only been a few months. We folded into other test corps and use a SIG for our furry shit
---
We are still there. We are a SIG now
---
unfortunately nerfing a botters income will not keep him from botting or would it?
---
So I'm gonna put on my shiny tinfoil hat and guess that the lost Triglav colonies beyond the Abyss are in... rogue drone space. They want to have rogue drones conform or be destroyed...they also want to see if capsuleers are useful.
---
So, NPC Triglav constellation in a rogue drone region (Malpais maybe?), with mission hubs and an LP store.
---
A man can dream...
---
Contracts
---
Kind of embarrassing that you weren't able to stop a cocksucking pet from anchoring a fortizar though.
---
can leshak mine asteroids? if no then  kill triglavians
---
Use 3-4 excavators and 1-2 faction drones?      
---
(tbh don't know how much safely go to Wetu)      
---
Much less isk?       
---
Sure .... but just get +1 Rorqual.
---
Operations rarely get more false flag than that!
---
Realtalk: TNT seems to have made a big effort to get a lot more active lately. Change in leadership? Recruitment of some active FCs?
---
Can't cyno with less than 75% cap either, which will be the case  with an NSA running. Drop an extender/booster for cap boosters, and keep your NSA from auto repeating. Stay aligned and if a neut pops in, start eating cap boosters and then cyno somewhere else. Problem solved. If your NSA causes you to get tackled you're probably gonna die, but at least you have the chance to cyno. The only people who won't still rat in a carrier are the risk-averse nullbears. You can literally make enough isk in a weekend to replace it.
---
Tidi in detroid is from all those botting VNI's kid lmao
---
Cool. That's the Triglavian Collective, right? 
---
wrong, atm it is everybody but not goons bar
---
Thank you. I’ve not really worked with the market, other than to buy/sell stuff, not to the extent of doing actual trading.
---
I’m going to expand the things I’m doing there because there is so much I haven’t really tried yet.
---
Then I guess you're shit out of luck! 
---
I'll still use a NSA on my ratting carrier. Wont change my routine at all, nor will it affect my ticks.
---
All those rolling over to put sensor boosters instead of an NSA honestly dont deserve to have a carrier.
---
Thing is you allrdy fitted 2 navigation computers for Dronespeed, so their orbit speed is enough to tank even if they get primary'd.
---
I experimented a bit and figured 2 are still enough and quite literally pve wise nothing changes.
---
1 medium energy neutralizer from pilgrim is equivalent to 1 neut from battleship 23 cap/s vs 25 cap/s (90%).  
---
So it's fair to say that 1 medium neut from pilgrim is ~= 1 heavy neut from battleship.
---
Now if they buff pilgrim's optimal to the curse optimal it will be an equivalent of cloaky ship with 3 "heavy" neuts with 60+ km range. Which is OP in my opinion.
---
Not even going to argue that point, it's probably true at the moment.
---
Yeah, I wish I was off meds or had been on meds to see the foolish replies over here!
---
This is not a critical problem when you have home defence like FAXs and another pvp fited caps or sub cap group. Just can be die more full carebire carriers in renting space where no one dont care about this. And supers.. supers also cant warp and can be easy tackled then now but if you not fly on dumpster hyperspatic and have nestors for refit to full tank you also can be save if you region have home defence. So why no? Why no give this some risk for using NSA because its can generate some more action and content for both sides like defenders and tacklers. More home defence opses,more good kills for hunters and more destroyed stuffs and isk. Also you can aline and gave speed and you still can have remote reps support. So i think its good update for NSA and he can generate more kills and more content. Sry for my english and correct me if i somewhere wrong.
---
Same here. 1 missile per, until the final wave.
---
Shimi!
---
I'm pretty sure I was omega at the cutoff date yet didn't get the SP.  I couldn't figure out a way to check other than looking through jeveassets for when I bought PLEX.
---
Sounds like you have some work to do... in game and out.
---
Go to a forsaken hub.
---
Manually pilot into the middle of it, drop your MTU.
---
Orbit MTU at 20-15km (with 100MN AB, your set orbit usually equates to about +5km).
---
There is a chance to die to the frig NPCs on a certain wave if 2-3 of them web you at the same time (they also point). You can save yourself however (from armor warning sound, i-e around 40-50% armor. Side question; how do I change the threshold for this?) if you quickly clear the webbing/scramming frigs and overheat your repper if active tanked. You want to be close so they redbox you, so your drones auto aggro, so you don't have to tab away netflix to manually target.
---
Never lost a drone to neut entering, simply prop mod off, align, pull drones, then warp in that order. If you pay attention to local you have loads of time do all of these things unless they've already bookmarked your site or they're running some weirdo 12AU warp speed fit.
---
Nah outside EVE. I guess I am doing good. Just the meta salt here drives me nuts 🥴😝🤣. Anyways your opinion over plex price? 
---
It's not a good thing if you are playing a video game that banks its success on meaningful choices and permanent loss.
---
&gt;Those rorquals in safer areas are being hit with yield nerfs.
---
And? So is everyone. Giant null blocs should be hit harder by any mining nerfs than smaller alliances because of how safe their mining is. 
---
You wont be able ... people will switch to sebos  
---
Why ? look like how many are ratting in a marauder currently, it is the same issue here ... they wont risk to be pointed down for 1 minute in the site.  
---
Marauder has more dps and more tank than an usual ratting ship ... so is the carrier.
---
This does not work on guristas, you gotta orbit around 40, serpentis ratting is still safe as you can easily orbit at 15k
---
Check payments list in secure.eveonline.com
---
what if mining or ratting is having fun for them? 
---
Oooh, it's actual *bought with money* PLEX.  That would explain why I haven't got it.
---
&gt; white neckbeards
---
Hy and penif are definitely not.
---
Also did you assume their race?
---
Still any subscription renewal shows up there. 
---
snuffed out flair = downvotes.
---
It's true but if you wanna jack yourself over it be my guest.
---
I will have to check the devblog but they have add some kind of a stacking penalty
---
hum my bad :D
---
A ships still have to at less than 2500m from a Mobile depot to use it, so the rorqual Will have to move from one to another to store all of them, and tbh they are not really mobile :D
---
This change will severely reduce cap+ usage, and the reduce in mining output will increase the prices. Anom nerf will decrease isk amounts and *voila* we have less capitals and they will become more valued. 
---
Occasionally there's a 50% off sale on all packs, that's when they're really worth it. 
---
Hmm, maybe I'm being super dumb but I don't see a 'payments list'.  I have 'transaction history' which shows the one time I bought PLEX (to get developer access), but doesn't show any time I've PLEX'd my account to Omega.
---
I’m sorry I don’t think I expressed myself correctly, I wanted to say some might see it as a good or a bad thing. Like for example the industrialists will see it as an advantage for some time, while us regular players and non botters will see it as a problem...
---
What exactly do you mean by it banks on meaningful choices and permanent loss, if I understood you correctly then I kind of enjoy these things, specially the permanent loss part, as it gives you this sense of danger and appreciation of what you have..
---
20.031
---
Then it can actually serve a purpose, as it is now a Stratios neuts almost the same amount as a pilgrim and has much more tank and dps and utility
---
I think my problem is that I've never subscribed, I've only ever used PLEX to add game time, so I've still looking for a way to figure out when my account went Omega.
---
Who said carriers were for ratting anyway? It's the player base that has decided to use them in this way not CCP.
---
But if you want mad ideas swap the no warp for 60's for a beacon instead. When NSA is on they glow up like a cyno on the overview. This will still give them the option to warp but also give the attack the ability to catch them.
---
Check https://secure.eveonline.com/SubscriptionInfo.aspx here.
---
Should be 'credit card' or plex.
---
Well if you're not using missiles you're just a slightly better Rattlesnake - they can pull ~1500dps too if you go for Sentrys and Cruise.
---
Sitting in a Hel my perception is slightly inflated but simply attacking one battleship with all 3 squads should be fine tho, if you use missiles you oneshot a battleship.
---
Focus on your commands tho, 30mil ticks are very low, you get about 20-22mil in a Vexor Navy.
---
A good Rattle can pull 45mil+, if you bling it you allmost reach carrier performance anyways.
---
Don't cycle your NSA, put auto repead off and prealign to the next site if you're at the last wave.
---
Stay above 71% cap so you can panic jump.
---
Fly a shield carrier like the Nidhoggur so you have superior damage and tank combined.
---
Look up Guides.
---
how can i make remote buy order with range 1jump
---
i already have  lv2 Procurement
---
Selecting rocks and pressing F1 and orbiting a rock and pressing F1... How fun.
---
Let’s all prioritize the 10% of what the game has to offer(mining&amp;ratting), for the mindless grinders and disregard the other 90% of things that there is to do. 
---
But let’s be honest, not many people actually pay attention to the game when ratting in anomalies or mining in their shiny rorqs apart from intel. 
---
I don’t mean to be an ass about this and sorry if I come out as one, but if it was up to me there would be no afk activities. A game should be played for fun and your playtime should feel rewarding.
---
Like I said, it's not there.  There's only 2 entries, once when I bought PLEX with IRL cash and the date I created an Alpha account.
---
None of the times I used PLEX ingame to extend my game time are listed.
---
Yep, my whole point to keep carriers on anoms so people can hunt them.       
---
NSA change will not make ratting more vulnerable ... and this is main reason why CCP want to introduce those changes. 
---
Strange bc they should be there. Mine are there. Maybe wrong account?
---
Eve porn 
---
How long you play this game?
---
Lol at brave having a voice in legacy meetings.
---
It's only free, if your time is worthless. ;)
---
I must say i have completely missed the irony there. Please elaborate.
---
So we should get nerfed harder because others are bad at the game.... makes sense
---
Never was
---
Aha, niiice. This is exactly why I trained into orca, rorq and most other ships. Not that I fond anything nice often, but still it's nice to be prepared. I think I should visit Hisec more often.

did u/concernedeve forget to switch accounts?

wow fuck you dude i wrote all i wanted in the title
---
Well I do use missiles and that's where my issue is. All the guides I've read had all said use all 3 missiles on bs which is fine but I'll run out by wave 3 or so. I'm not sure do I recall and re arm or just use lasers till the end. I also work on aligning right though it's kinda hard as I'm in delve so there's so many people it's hard to find a open site.
---
Tickled my funny bone.
---
&gt; so people can hunt them.
---
You mean so people can watch them warp to safety as soon as they enter the system.
---
You just need to set a target or goal to make you want to play and forces you to undock and mine or rat.  
---
I'm not sure whether to feel insulted to be compared to someone so.... dedicated....
---
You win
---
Good call, but just checked and it's the right account.
---
If I had to guess, maybe you started your account before Alpha accounts were brought in, whereas I started my account afterwards.
---
It generally depends on what you need. If you look for large alliance, it's not really that hard they pretty much all offer the same and all the big names are known. If you're after a smaller or a more quality alliance, you have to dig a bit more into recruitment post/channel, and what IMO is the most important, their killboard. With the killboard you basically know what they are up to on a daily basis, small gang, home defense, big fights, etc.
---
When I had a bad cough for three or four weeks my doctor told me to drink a lot of fluid, gargle with salt water, or even better gargle with a hot beverage. He paused for a while and added that gargling with whisky was also a very good option and that spitting it back out was not strictly necessary. Best doctor ever.
---
**high pitched voice**

Uhh yes, you have founded me
---
Don't show this to Wingspan - they will have a nerdgasm
---
for remote buy orders, there's another skill that increases the maximum range for them
---
i think it's visibility, hover around the trade skill window for a bit
---
Thank you, I really appreciate you and others responding to this. Clearly, I am inexperienced with this issue. I wasn't expecting the hate...which raises some interesting questions. The SJW crowd doesn't really seem to be interested in protecting people as much as virtue-signalling and gaining status in their gang...willing to DO harm to acquire it. Also, I've read that outrage gives humans a dopamine hit. Anyway, I am worried about these political meta-gangs destroying Eve to feed their egos. I've already watched it destroy an entire corp. I'm sure I am not alone.
---
Right, what I mean is if everything is cheap and easily replaceable, then the entire premise of EVE is gone - choices have no consequence (even characters dont have their reputation attached as you can extract and reinject a new toon at will) and losses are no longer meaningful (we're in an age where suicide supercapitals are an acceptable option in large fights). 
---
Even for industrialists, cheap ore means more competition and people can afford to undercut more, lowering profit margins. This leads to obviously less expensive items but circles back to my first point.
---
Gotta love the avatar, but we all know that the imicus is king of all
---
All hail francis king of imicus
---
Can confirm, love me some batteries
---
Sweeeet I can finally unsub five accounts and still enjoy this game! 😁
---
I haven't tried recently. But im pretty sure the window wont crack if you throw a feather at it.
---
As someone from test, I don't even know what the legacy voltron discord is.
---
News item updated after today's downtime. 
---
DBA team have taken a look at their script and edited it to include several conditions that caused a number of pilots who were eligibile not to receive skillpoints.
---
All SP have now been delivered as of downtime today and anyone who's filed a support ticket should recieve a response confirming this soon.
---
Yeah this one was started way before. Though it still shows plex activation on 9th of march 2017.
---
Event sites uses a different ai i think
---
in short, it's the one discord you wont get purged from if you leave legacy
---
I told RC not to kill my astra, look what happens, they loosing a keepstar
---
Im confused by how us shooting this keepstar is a betrayal and its goons next btw. Provi aint ripe for harvest yet and im scared of pando
---
hi judy why is your dad lovely?
---
does legacy voltron have any tactical use or is it just a social forum?
---
People will do it as carriers will use SEBOs after this change. 
---
Ohhh, okay now I understand. Everything you stated makes complete sense and I agree with you, honestly I haven’t been around long enough to understand where everything stands exactly but since you put it this way, I can see what the problem is.
---
But right now, isn’t everything getting to the point of what you just described? At least that’s what it seems like judging by the reddit posts and ingame events/actions.. Also isn’t this type of damage irreversable?
---
I built a thanatos from BPCs from ore mined in highsec. The problem was to transport it to lowsec, because only lowsec stations can build carriers. However lost the Thanatos to PvP during 3rd testflight... Now I am building a freighter in 0.5 from moon belt ores. I really need Tritanium, have more than enough of thr other stuf, so some spod belt would be lovely. Probably will get my own athanor
---
It is the coordination point, ie. pings, for legacy voltron fleets, 
---
Admittedly as a TEST member, you will have the mainline TEST fleets to attend instead of the supporting voltron fleet so it may not be relevant to you.
---
Nice D'n'G CTA. if you just had formed that hard with LS VOLTRON. 
---
Probably relevant to anyone in the FC food chain, but not the average test member then.
---
They both contribute to reduced losses, but if faxes couldn't outrep anything except for critical mass DD volleys (and even then, you can catch people sometimes), then that sort of a battle would be more bloody regardless of tidi issues.
---
&gt; but you'd think CCP would have paid very close attention and would have a much closer idea, if not perfect idea, of how to hit that balance now that they've had more than enough time to observe. 
---
True i expected the yield to be much lower ccp fuck this one up too
---
Let me guess... fleetsize limitations?
---
Its not irreversible, but it is a process. Much like real world economies where governments can intervene to nudge them in the target direction, CCP can do things to nudge the eve economy in the target direction. Right now they are doing just that by reducing the flow of incoming ISK by reducing anomaly respawn rates and reducing insurance payouts. They are also reducing the mineral faucet by reducing the amount excavators can mine. It'll take time but market balance can be achieved.
---
Those crazy goons
---
I haven't seen you deny it. Try and make a case for why less risky activities should be more rewarding. I'll wait 
---
Does every module have to be used in PvE? I don't see an issue with this nerf stopping people from wanting to fit an NSA
---
They have 2 options, slightly reduced ticks due to longer locking time or slightly riskier carrier ratting. Seems a good balance to me
---
&gt; they are roughly an accurate representation.
---
Except not at all. You are comparing raw hp rep to incoming zero resist damage. A combat Hel on the low end will have 73% resist to incoming Revelation DPS making your “its in the math, sweetie” just utter spin and bullshit. That’s without any links / phenoms that WOULD be there in the engagement profiles that these changes look to affect.
---
What subhuman shield tanks an avatar? 
---
Member when goons stayed on their own shitty forum and r/eve was good?
---
yesq
---
Everything has a risk, just because some people have controls in place to reduce the risk doesn’t mean it’s risk free. 
---
And if you look at the yield nerf by volume yes it is going to hit each rorqual the same, however as some groups have more of them they will be hit at a larger scale then others.
---
Nothing will be as nice as finding the shield down and a hanger full of goodies.
---
Drone sebo last time I checked are 30mil and a ton in Jita.
---
Stay within 1DQ1-A Supercapital Umbrella, it even extends into Querious.
---
Go to DotLan and look up an Avatars/Erebus jumprange from 1dq, all highlighted systems are "safe" to rat in.
---
Allways be in fleet and comms, don't join your Corps fleet - join the standing. Don't idle on your Corps Teamspeak - join standing Mumble.
---
Fly the Capswarm PvP fitting while ratting, it should net you at 2.2mil ehp and its a proper bricktank for those fuckwits from bombersbar to chew on, My Hel sits on 7k dps / 50mil ehp and im anticipating those soon to be released shield implants *huehue*.
---
Pliz give us some time to jump to you, if you're one of those warpspeed meme plebs prepare to die.
---
As far as ratting goes you can rat in Systems without Keepstar too! Thats a big pro for ratting in a normal carrier. Look up DotLan on Systems in 1dq range with low npc deaths delta.
---
Fly to several Citadels and prepare a tether safe bookmark.
---
Allways take two squads of Dromis and Siren with you, use Dromis against tackle not Siren!
---
Keybind your Orbit / Approach command and set your default orbit to the same value as your fighters combat orbit.
---
Use shortcuts for return and orbit, return to tubes commando and fighter selection.
---
I know many guides out there are super casual and dont mention these at all. Many shortcuts for drones work for fighters as well so combine that.
---
Look I'm not saying it was smart, that's why the member sold it to Evictus
---
&gt; Also they are said to violate the one mind one body principle which is a big no no.
---
Since everything players do in this game is more or less considered canon, I would like to point out a ton of people violating that principle on a daily basis.
---
The subreddit is still shitting on them for doing something noteworthy and getting publicity about it.
---
Thanks it took me quite awhile to get fighter controls down and had to rehotkey some thinga. I've yet to find how to change the orbit but I'll be honest I haven't looked much. I'll see if I can also find a better place to rat. Should I use a secondary account to salvage? Been trying to find a way to either share a bookmark so I can plot mtus down from the carrier and have a noctis follow around after.
---
&gt;to reduce the risk doesn’t mean it’s risk free
---
&gt;because others are bad at the game
---
You've done nothing but strawman so I guess there's nothing else to talk about 
---
Nope my dude Im in the alliance who use them the most : goodswam 
---
We prefer the term Alts thank you. 
---
Jita local was not available to you because they gave it to a few select special pilots in Wormhole Space just to prove that HE:

---
and the first to loose a keep in a wormole, added to that the first people to loose the first keepstar wich was a first in a wormhole 
---
boy do i have a picture for you 
---
do you have absolutely any sources or anything? i haven't posted about these changes even once
---
as for always being against them: i asked for dread buffs last time they talked about nerfing faxes, directly contradicting what you're saying here. source : https://forums.eveonline.com/t/force-auxiliary-balance-proposal/90504/477
---
when they suggested nerfing fax local tank i said not to until they also nerfed keepstars, as our only method for killing keepstars involved using them [and i think people who attempt to kill keepstars deserve to be rewarded]
---
the main thing i dislike about this patch is that the keepstar dd is not being changed to be scaled by signature, in a patch meant to target subcap viability
---
please keep your fantasies to yourself
---
People drived it up to 200mil in 1 day - but it will drop fast. 
---
Lol I never understood paying people to watch them play a video game 
---
Change: Injectors now seeded for ISK
---
If the idea behind is to be locked in space and not be able to align and instantly warp off using NSA ... then yes, there is something to talk about.        
---
PVP carrier is usually used in direct tackle range so NSA will have its impact - but much, much smaller than in case of PVE ones. 
---
Structures have an invul timer every 10% of the bar.
---
Change: Doomsday device no longer restricted to 1.
---
Forgive my ignorance, but I the Marshal gets a larger bonus to scram range than a Malediction. Is there a role bonus or overheat bonus I'm missing or something?
---
Change: T2 Covops Cloak breaks local.
---
Make sure the shield is down before you salvage ships.
---
Alts aren't canon, IC they're either relatives, people who work for you, or aliases - CONCORD actively enforces the no-transhumanism principle upon capsuleers, we only get to be post-death.
---
Agree. For me was simple. With many care, ome Miasmos fill of the valuable zyrine megacyte and isogen, rest with some lazy miasmos transport.
---
For Tritanium i mine a LOT of concentrated veldspar. Was more quickly. Do too the obelisk freighter, and thinkining in do a NYX with a only one mining barge in null with only one miner.
---
Those under a super umbrella won't care because they're safe no matter what. Those without a super umbrella will never rat with an NSA now no matter how attractive you make it. 
---
The only thing this NSA change will do is slightly lower ticks for people who aren't living under a super umbrella. I'm not sure that's what CCP was aiming for but that's all they're getting. We'll have to see what other changes come in the future. 
---
It’s only that if the supers have no resists. It’s 1-1 if you do the right thing and include resists
---
Only goons have a defense that drops 100 caps and have srp ,, The rest of the players have no chance to make normal isk if you do not have 25 accounts, Do ccp not play the game ?? This change is going to kill the little player and corp. New eve is Imperium if you want to make isk or credit card if you play normal - I have 2 accounts and pay, spending 800 dollars a year on this and have now unsub all accounts so we see if eve can make money with gamers that have 25 accounts and plexing making 10 bill a day - nice going killing the little player you kill the ones that is PAYING to play ,,  Cleaning up and SADLY stop - this is how far i go so not worth the 17 dollars a month we in eu pay !!!!
---
Very toxic. 
---
This wasn't the first Keepstar lost in a wormhole
---
&gt;Even with hull SRP you are talking 10b in fittings and implants easily
---
Who even cares? Dont fly what you cant afford to lose? 
---
It's nice how after several thousand years and flying through space noone changed the medical symbol showing a worm that just got pulled out of your ass and got put on a stick for further examination.

Isn't that just the regular UK flag?

I'm almost afraid to ask but how far would the love reach on a lach/arazu using that?
---
how about they give it to everyone across the board and be done with it
---
Could be I’m misremembering - but it’s obscene either way.
---
I’ll simulate an Arazu/Lach later and report back.
---
^no
---
I'm not sure you can seriously argue skill u is risk averse with their supers considering they were dropping supers all over the Dronelands for a long time. Maybe it's different now, and they had the benefit of knowing and being friendly with a lot of the groups that might hunt them down well, but the certainly weren't only using them under an umbrella. 
---
Otherwise the narrative doesn't make sense, you're right. But it doesn't have to. The narrative isn't for us, it's for TEST members.
---
Oh the good ‘ol days.
---
What's the numbers narrative?
---
It's not ironic 
---
Sure but why pass up an opportunity for some good old fashion outrage?
---
Nice, good to hear. :-) And congrats again! It's quite an achievement!
---
I think the desired change is, if you want better ratting ticks you risk more. If you dont want to risk it then the bonus is less isk is created in the economy
---
reasonable carrot = isk
---
if people want to gimp their carrier to be safe, there isn't much you can do.  It is just kinda how eve works.  There are choices and tradeoffs for everything. 
---
I resent that! We have a voice! It's just small and quiet and people think it's just a mosquito buzzing past, but it's there! 
---
Are you retarded?
---
...well, close enough.
---
Great work as usual guys - someone translating all this obscure stuff with such professionalism is very impressive.
---
I don't know about fun. But I find super ratting very relaxing, almost meditative. 
---
I got 40m isk ticks with Niddy with T1 fighters and fighter support units and the rest T2 modules. I always reloaded missiles when I run out except on the last wave of the site. I also didn't split my fighters up between targets.
---
Got it, so no real role at all except making megabloc members feel accomplished. I've never flown a super and I don't feel like my time in game is not worthwhile because of it.
---
Sounds like that's the real root of the issue then.
---
**DO-DO-DO-DO-DO-DOCKI-DOCKING REQUEST ACCEPTED**
---
That would be 6 characters total. I think it would actually be an improvement
---
well it was the first loss of the first keepstar ever, im suprised there was another WH keep that died 
---
Im pretty sure it is. 
---
All the official logos on it too.
---
Tea, biscuit, queen all check, so it is genuine.
---
Woooo \~ 10 tones Truth here \~
---
You really have no idea what a blops purpose is if you think they a cyno jammer module. 
---
So it takes you one minute more to roll a hole? I only travel through there so I don't see this as a big problem. Is it?
---
You used the correct Rod of Asclepius instead of the the incorrect Staff of Caduceus as a symbol of healing. Well done sir!
---
So a corp left but is still in discord or what?
---
\&gt;stupid uneducated space bushido smallganger opinion

Isnt brave like the second largest alliance in legacy? 
---
I Stole an Avatar!  
---
FTFY
---
not only that, but even with clear, well-defined feedback from knowledgeable and experienced community members telling them "whoa there fellas pump the brakes," they will charge right ahead with this patch, saying "well if it's a problem we'll address it incrementally in a later release"
---
and then they will maybe address it in a later release
---
two years later
---
The blops purpose is to send fleet members onto the grid and if dropped, provide some ewar support and some damage, not the best at either
---
I don't think theres an issue with people risking BLOPS. Its more of  finding something worthwhile to use them on. You know - VNI Online 2k19
---
Meme channel is fun to read
---
So far based on the data i have, i estimate it to be 10% of Voltron "Auths" to be hostiles, blacklisted members or duplicated accounts.
---
If you are pvp oriented player forget it. The game pvp state is clown fieasta dnt waste your time.
---
Thats not a problem, when you just travel through holes. But when you roll them every 2-3 minutes, trying to find something to kill, every additional minute of waiting hurts. 
---
And now we have triglavian capital ships...
---
lol
---
Well, its no like there is opsex information there really. Is it? But 10%, damn, thats a lot, no one must be really paying attention, lol.
---
Chances are, your blops BS will die way before any target that you are attacking will, unless you're one of the big null blocs or bombers bar that have hundreds of bombers to back up it's blops.
---
they are there to salvage whats left of legacy
---
here's the single most important point
---
nerfing ice mining, which directly raises the price of ice, raises the price of isotopes, which makes it more expensive to run a jf, the cost of which is passed on to everyone living in null both in straight monetary cost and the strain on logistics individuals, who are generally already very overworked
---
dear ccp: this is the third nerf in recent memory that negatively impacts jfs. logisticians enable literally everything that happens in the game. stop fucking nerfing jfs.
---
You'd probably need something like 400% rep bonus to get the hull reppers useful.
---
a shield avatar is still better than an armor avatar when all the logi is shield

its the discord where i post lizard pictures

Ha ha ha this is great boys!

boy i was talking to goons in that for well over a year 
---
The feather is in its natural environment.
---
We just straight up don't use coalition communication because of this.
---
I really can't comment on why its not fixed. Only that it has not been, though I have been constantly raising it as an issue.
---
Edited the post. A new niche ship line lile the hics would probably be better. Blops just have jump drives to get into field quickly. 
---
Super umbrella can respond so often as fatigue and 'strain' allows.     
---
Carrier, super or bunch of rorquals - carriers are less important here. 
---
Edited the post. I suggested blops originally to not introduce a new niche ship line but it seems more fitting to do so. 
---
Neat.  
---
I would actually consider flying a panther. 
---
Well the amount of ist a character can create per hour is abnormal aswell , with carrier and super and titan ratting and rorqual mining I’m not surprised plex prices rising that fast , people multiboxing rorquals 24/7 
---
You want to lock the sabre so he cant cloak on grid and rebubble while his gang travels over.

Best Game Ever Made.
---
i only play since early 2017 but i was hooked like after just a week. i'm no bittervet, few things in the game are frustrating to me but if you want your perfect game then make it yourself or accept that eve isn't perfect.
---
Time consuming &gt;&gt;&gt; very much
---
Soul Consuming &gt;&gt;&gt; even more
---
Lot of frustrations at the beggining, but the moments when you realize that you start to know your stuff and you actually achieve some things (like killing people while outnumbered, outpowered, blobbed but still manage to take few people with you, solo kills against all odds,...) thoses moments are priceless.
---
Don't forget to PVP even if you get your ass kicked 10 times in a row.
---
You will learn new things every day, and even teach thoses things to others sometimes.
---
You will meet people of all sorts so beware of toxic ones, and be kind to the good ones.
---
You will realize that you waited for this kind of game experience all your (gamer)life.
---
P.S. : a lot of your previous games will seems dull after EVE online because they are NOT EVE online.
---
I wish you luck, o7
---
I agree, that was part of the magic.  I'd deal with a lot of stupid tedium setting up pos's, even before they made the anchoring times somewhat sane for the modules.  
---
It was all worth it just to see that shield turn on.  There's a base feeling of satisfaction there that a citidel onlining doesn't have.
---
Well shooting a structure without any content is boring so wouldn’t be surprised if u start shouting your allies on grid just to get some more , wouldn’t be the first time 
---
The comma after grammar is bad grammar.

Im wondering how an ice scarcity would impact lowsec. Currently, glare crust (the source of heavy water) is the most valuable compressed ice, and it's found all around 0.4 space and down. That might attract more krabs, and with them, more hunters and more people to defend the krabs. That might bring some life into non-fw lowsec.
---
what i wanted to say exactly
---
Yea I'm reading this post and thinking 'How is this bad?'. If a group drops 150 dreads then they should destroy stuff. 
---
Especially when you consider all the things booters will still make more than normal player after all those limitations. 
---
If you have sabre on you - you fucked up already.
---
Maybe don't be shit lol?
---
As if there are not already director and about level agents from other coalitions directly in TEST...  
---
What difference does the discord matter at that point? :thonking:
---
Man this Triglavian stuff is genuinely cool
---
So far from playing anthem to max level and playing the division 2 to level 7 in 2 betas I can tell you... Anthem is a pile of shit. Ubicrap learned a lot from there mistakes in div 1, it may get meh here and there but they want to keep up a good release cycle of addition content.
---
I like scooping random noob ships left floating in space. They never have anything in them but I keep hoping I'll snag something shiny one day. 
---
&gt; The tutorial lessons provided by wardeccers were too harsh too soon?
---
They weren't offering a tutorial on getting blown up. They just wanted easy frags and didn't care who they were stepping on.
---
&gt;Look I'm a total newbro as well. Got ganked flying on autopilot through Hsec.
---
What i went through was nothing like that. Imagine being ganked every other time you even undock. Imagine being unable to fly more than a couple systems without someone noticing you and a dozen people start chasing you. 
---
&gt;I really can't sympathize with the idea of a safe zone in this game.
---
I never said i wanted this. 
---
Please tell me what the set up is i will buy 15 in that case. 
---
Incorrect. Commas can be used to denote a natural pause, such as if you were reading aloud.

It always makes me chuckle when people say this. Omg people don't throw each other to the wolves anymore and band together to protect each other omg such risk adversity so carebear.

Oh damn traveling sucks. I miss all the market fun.

hey now, they organised a committee to set up a vote and democratically decided not to have a voice 
---
I bet this is how Elo felt 
---
It would be a lot quieter without hussy around, granted.
---
how often do you have to beat a dead brony till its truly dead?
---
"we never had a chance cause it wasn't a fair fight but we fought 1500 ppl with just 30 main chars against all odds"
---
"we also totally didnt have our own blobb to bring in cause we follow the wh bushido"
---
in reality they should have had the advantage in the actual fight for hole control and simply fucked up... resulting in us bringing 1500 ppl in for the final timer. yes at that point they had no chance anymore and the fight was over anyway since they gave up 2days before that anyway.
---
Or just don't bring an Avatar?
---
I feel like that crucial option was skimmed over somewhere in that guy's thought process.
---
Was a reference to the one purchased from us, but good job, you keep doing you! :thumbsup:

Limited social implant doesn't belong here then, it was stolen from the flag of Finland

^^^^^^^^reeeeeeee
---
It really shows that you have only ever used blops for bridging lol
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
If you click anything you should have that "selected item" adjust to your target, rightklick your orbit icon in that window and choose "set default orbit distance". Normal templar 1 should have 6500ish orbit - you better check under your fighter info &gt; attributes, also templar 2 have a different value. You want to have default orbit distanke same as their combat orbit so they dont drop transversal velocity or slingshot themself outwards if you use attack commands.
---
Also an attack command overwrites any orbits you've set so you need to reengage them. Dont orbit your target, but another ship closeby so if your target gets destroyed your fighters dont drop speed (thats important so you dont loose fighters, especially t2s wich go for quite some isk a pop).
---
I don't think salvaging is worth it but if you got a second account you might as well go for it, its another 12mil per site. If you plan on properly salvaging you can go for a salvage destroyer and industrial transporter since thats a way better throughput and more isk/h but if you want to idle on your second account a noctis is fine i guess.
---
where?
---
Thanks! And I really had a great pleasure making it sound as weird in translation, haha 😀

---
Although that keepstar dying is cool for us CVA dudes, I just can't shake the feeling that we should probably be alot more worried than we currently are about snuff shooting keepstar within jump range of our own, regardless of if we're on any sort of friendly terms for the simple fact that snuff doesn't seem to care about 'friends' if it means free content.
---
That is right but not everyone is 100% focused all the time. It's not like carriers aren't ratting aligned already and die. When you get into the situation tho, being able to lock the saber will increase your chance of survival drastically.
---
i state the resists profile assumptions as the fits. Thats assuming perfect vulture/damnation links. If you notice i multiple the figures by a resist multiplier. Thats what that is. 
---
There is a big slavic link with this. (Triglav being a pagan slavic god) 
---
"Narodyna moving through the flow of Vyraj may be fit to enter"  - for example
---
Vyraj was kind of a paradise concept. If I remember correctly its where the birds went in winter and I vaguely remember something about birds that lived there being the souls of the dead. 
---
Narodnya is probably Narodnaya which means people so the above section becomes - People moving thought he flow of ?heaven? may be fit to enter.
---
Somebody with an real interest in old Polish or Russian history could probably make a lot more sense of this than me , (which are based off vaguely remembered stuff from when I dated a archaeologist who was very into ancient slavic stuff )

I see Eve as a monumental achievement. The fact that it is a persistent universe and everyone shares the same space is amazing. The fact that emergent gameplay is allowed to happen is great. Although, this aspect of the game is threatened. CCP seeks to protect new players and give them room to learn the game in relative safety. I totally agree with this goal, as it encourages people to get invested before having their first devastating, potentially game-ending (for them) gut punch. HOWEVER, here be dragons. Every change is potentially alienating to veteran players who have learned to deal with and take advantage of time-honored mechanics. Each change can be perceived by some as making Eve into something different and lesser. I do believe that CCP is changing too much and too frequently...amplifying this feeling for many...and giving credence to those who feel they are wussifying a gritty, grim, unforgiving reality.
---
Elite Dangerous is a great example of what I'm talking about. I tried playing that game for a long time. It never measured up to my Eve experience because they never made it "real". You can avoid all PVP by playing in Solo-mode. Also, when I was playing, you could never reliably affect any system or players because they run multiple instances of the same system, so if you are blockading something, you are unable to do so. The enemy can always get through by either entering solo-mode or simply avoiding you by accidentally being in a different instance. The un-reality of this makes what is a beautiful game into a pointless grind. The only PVP available is opportunistic sadism, but not purposeful strategy...such a shame...thought the business goal is obvious and understandable.
---
Even more inadvisable is CCP's embrace of RL politics. This is a stunningly bad decision and absolutely alienates a large pool of potential subscribers, including me. CCP and their representatives should never engage in RL politics of any kind. Alas, it seems the temptation to influence others is too great for them. Turning their game into a tool of advocacy is very harmful and something that should be immediately reversed, lest their political agenda kill their excellent creation. I offer the same advice to all entities within Eve who all have their own flavors...some also engaging in RL politics. One example of what I am talking about is the fact that in some Muslim countries, homosexuality carries the death-penalty. Meanwhile, CCP and its employees run around waving gay-pride flags. This is inadvisable in a global game like Eve. Get a clue CCP. Is CCP anti-Muslim? More to the point, do you want any Muslim subscribers? It is a big world, with lots of perspectives, let's make them all subscribers. Ironically, bringing people together in a global game like Eve could do vastly more for CCP's apparent political goals than alienating everyone who doesn't agree with them.
---
[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/amgj7y/capital_projectioncynojump_drive_balance_three/) is a thread I posted a month ago for a module that sieges the blops in return of shutting down an active cyno.
---
If mobile inhibs are irrelevant, they should be made relevant without involving a ship with it. The game needs both a range buff on mobile inhibs and an active module that shuts down cynoes.
---
The cap doesn’t run out when you put medium or small guns on it. Then troll frigates that think their transversal will save them. But you are right. the capacitor is the biggest issue with the abaddon. I still love this ship cuz it looks badass and it can shoot the laser rainbow. 
---
Who's TNT?   
---
It's fun to read if you can get past the auth glitch.

So the numbers narrative is that init had more numbers? I'm not sure I understand how this is a narrative. HK + batphones isn't even close to the size of init + batphones
---
Remove local
---
Insurance is still a thing for faction and t2 hulls but the payouts are based off the t1 variant so it’s often not worth the investment. 
---
People will use blops again when there are more targets around that they can handle. Adding a silly gimmick doesn't accomplish anything.
---
Still doesn’t mean we have a voice 
---
Expand local to WH space!

wow they are bigger than requiem eternal, drone walkers and a bunch of other assorted trash, such a pedigree lmao

1 local for all of new eden to share.

Didnt you hear the news. Finns invaded UK and now that UK is Finlands colony, they are required also use the Finnish flag limited social logo.
---
There had been major "Torille" festivals in Finland after the invasion (liberation) of UK. 
---
Wise!
---
Also, as a newer player, the value of what you can /should (in terms of skills/experience) fly is minimal too
---
Lmao the entire point of this change is to make using supers more risky and to make dreads more viable. What are you not understanding?
---

The problem is that Test always viewed them as subservient since HERO coalition, so that dynamic has persisted.

I mean as far as I'm concerned this just adds more value to the thanatos and nyx as ratting ships. I'll be swapping from a niddy and a hel certainly. But then again I still run tank on my ratting ships :)
---
pretty good meme except every speech bubble should just be “we should batphone goons”
---
Just brexit already...
---
Yeah cause their price vs income is generally on par with the other greats of null sec. A carrier is 1.5b and you can make 45-60m ticks, a marauder is 1.5 for the hull and you'll top at like 35-50. Great investment. Also its about the same time in training as a carrier. Or you could just use a VNI and in 1.5 hours have it paid for, super low entry in skill points and still make 60m an hour. You have the absolute worst case
---
The will of the people
---
And what wonderful alliance do you reside in?
---
This was amazing.
---
Feels like people are a bit too optimistic about this, at the very best it's just an event that unlocks BS sized Triglav space, at worst (and most likely ) it's just another guardian gala themed as Triglavian invasion...
---
&gt; assuming there was a thought process
---
&gt; Even more inadvisable is CCP's embrace of RL politics...
---
just checked few of your post (very fast i have to admit) and 
---
dude wtf is wrong with you? you bring up something wich is totally irrelevant with the question from OP !?
---
Honestly you can just play this game and stay out of thoses shitty topics of yours. Seriously that was the least 
---
relevant thing you could have say to new players/possible future players.
---
I'm sorry to say that, trully, but sir you're a moron looking for useless debate.
---
OP &gt;&gt;&gt; remember ?
---
&gt; You will meet people of all sorts so beware of toxic ones...
---
turns out the fight was 10 condors vs 50 titans and you were there not contributing much, dock up, spin ship...
---
basically this first 40 fax outrep 100 dreads. after that your at 3 fax per 1 dread worth of dmg
---
Nah, the eve (goon) econ must move forward. There will always be carrier ratters and always be rorqs in space. Just now easier to kill
---
No, that comma is fine. It's the difference between saying

The first implies some kind of grammar-based offspring.

I haven't played Eve in a few years, what are the Triglavian ships good for? They look sweet and I want to use them for something, but I'm terrible at reading stats - just not experienced enough in the game.

Does CCP take your loot away if the guy you killed gets reimbursed?
---
Snuff is clearly a member of the Imperium, so it would make sense that they'd bring their entire coalition.
---
ITT TEST FC leadership claiming they are looking out for the little guy when the changes proposed by CCP for FAX changes are squarely targeted at the big guys.
---
Also, fucking lmao at pgl claiming he can win without super caps. What a fucking smooth brain.
---
what about this?  in system tarta they  tend to dock to  athanors,raitarus YES  they dock t player structures (!) what about ganking the hauler at citadel and use citadel  weapons agaiast diamond escort rats?

His losses from concord blapping his ships

It means carriers will put extra fighter support in the top, fit sebos, and always be at jump cap, making em even safer than before vOv

More like 2 or 3

Why would they reimburse those if he got to kill the JF and take the loot?
---
Thanks for the idea! 🤣 Anyone who feels offended for no reason over the post should downvote and get me kicked! 👍
---
Exactly
---
yea i guess. im in a corp with a bit of a language barrier (nothing major, just accecents) and im not on when teh bulk of the people are.  i also spent the majority of my time in provi and now im out of there so its kind of a big change going from nrds to nbsi

Don't pull the feathers ... just throw the whole thing.

Wtf is that anime shit doing there

They've only really covered 5 places in the world, 2 of them in north america. I guess they looked at existing events and where a lot of player live.

lets go with the flow

yes because doing the same thing again is bound to have different results
---
Funny, im shit at eve yet ive never lost my super and i play solo......makes sense.

Shut up Mack.

Ffffff. SO true.

Missing in the report is a more garbled transmission plays when you hack a citadel with a data analyzer. Didn't notice the sound running data or relic sites, however.

he already skill extracted all his chars on stream and made a tear-filled ragepost about quitting.

now he’s having second thoughts but since he ruined his ability to play again, he’s doing the next best thing - fishing for attention on /r/eve

Its like a chess match. the winner of the match will have more pieces on the board at the end and in this case the loser claims "look i never had a chance".

they wont they will be more focused on playing eve the way its ment to be played instead of playing wow arena

Pls no, then they would just need the Brutix and BNI to compensate.

The Nation currently have no stance for the so called 'Triglavian Collective' i can only say that adequate force was sent to acquire all needed insight into this collective. 
---
Brave at least forms up and give one hell of a fight without dropping caps on every Atron that enters system.
---
TIL
---
PvP small gang, especially the destroyer and the battlecruiser. the frig is very underwhelming, the cruiser is OK but a bit lacking. That said, there will hopefully be T2 assault versions of the frig and the cruiser, so it doesn't matter if the T1s are a bit underpowered.
---
The Trig Logi are weird, and I have never flown one nor have I seen one used in PvP, so can't comment.
---
The Trig battleships do a crapton of DPS and are often used in small fleets to take out large targets.
---
For PvE you can do L4 and all equivalent difficulty content in Vedmak, Drekavac and Leshak, cruiser battlecruiser and battleship. In the cruiser and battlecruiser its a lot more active gameplay then any other ships in the game thus not as mind numbing, you can actually have some fun with it. Vedmaks can also be used in Abyss fairly well but require very heavy bling for T4s and T5s.
---
They are a ton of fun to play with due to their unique spool up mechanics. Also the Vedmak I think is best speed tanking cruiser in the game due to having relatively high base movement rate and a very low sig for a cruiser.
---
You rang?
---
I haven't used them too much, but the Kikimora (destroyer) is a great kiter, and the Leshak (BS) is good for taking down capitals and structures with it's high DPS and tank.

These RL political issues have destroyed corps and permanently alienated people from the game. They are also what the most immediate concern to me as to whether or not Eve is worth it to play in 2019. Therefore, you see a natural trend in my posting.
---
I spent most of my post complimenting Eve and CCP, but the small dose of reality at the bottom is not allowed...I see. I'm sure you and your buddies will succeed in cleansing Reddit of unwelcome perspectives soon, if you haven't already. I'm new here, and it seems views outside the group-think are not welcome.
---
yeah Haef called a reddit CTA it seems
---
It's not a grey area. It is against ToS for Eve Online to use donations/bits/subscriptions as entries into a giveaway or to return in game services for this as it is considered RMT. I was told this by a member of CCP a year ago and found the rules in the ToS. Submit an official report to CCP with video evidence and move on.
---
Also, depending on your country, it could be illegal to require donations/subscriptions/bits in a giveaway. Here in the United States, restricting giveaways to subscribers only OR requiring donations/bits to enter into a giveaway is federal crime. The way people get around this is it IS legal to allow anyone to enter the giveaway but give more entries to subscribers. This would apply to in game currency giveaways as well.

 „… et tu, Brutix?“

Every Judy post is a cry for ~~help~~ relevance
---
I love it.

Lol
---
Clearly Hy's belief that RC's friends would show up to help was wrong.
---
Or RC's friends don't care.
---
Or RC doesn't really have friends anymore.
---
Honestly the jury is out on this one.
---
I guess no one thought about this.

This.

---
Rorq mining &gt; PVP
---
Simple
---
yup. 
---
also, holy fuck that bump.
---
This is always an awesome time.  Unfortunately I cannot make this one.  
---
Is this a nightmare or a dream come true?
---
..cloaked.
---
with the 50% nerf to titan haw damage in goons we've just decided to double our titan fleet size as an accommodation.
---
It actually makes even less skilled then before. 
---
This is how its going to go down now:
---
Step 1: Get some bubbles on a ratting Hel or Nyx (much easier with the Changes to the NSA)
---
Step 2: Light Cyno and drop dreads 
---
Step 3: ????
---
Step 4: Profit
---
Before you had the extra step of having to kill the faxes too. 
---
&gt;Tired of seeing a hundred+ dreads welped for a single titan and 5 supercarrier kills
---
The thing though is that 100 dreads cost about 150-200 bil. A titan and 5 supers costs about... 150-200 bil. So isk-wise that's about an even trade. With this change it may be the case that the most cost-effective ship for large battles between capital fleets will now be dreads, where previously it was FAXes.
---
I'm not complaining. I can't even fly capital ships yet. But I do think that the OP may have a point that we may see a lot less supers undocking for PvP after this change. The deciding factor in battles may now be: who can bring the most dreads.
---
You can't fit more than one, it burns out and can't be repaired/removed unless in a station :) You can't chain panic basically. TBH the real issue is there is no point in active ratting, its kinda sad carrier/super ratting gets nerfed since that is by FAR the most active gameplay (cept when botted) 
---
i like to mine with my rorquals
---
I can assure you, everyone even goons get dropped and killed like flies. Spectre fleet and bombars bar are highly effective. 
---
Only thing I miss about eve is running fleets.
---
When things went well... lol
---
Jeez that was a smooth ending. 
---
Well first of all, I didn't realize it was the Triglavian Collective broadcasting to the billboards. My corpmates and I had hot dropped a gating Archon, and while holding the field to loot, we heard the broadcasts and were a bit confused. I was thinking at first an ad or video was playing on a web browser out of game maybe, so I closed them... but still heard it. 
---
So when I went to do some data and relic sites oit of boredom, I stopped to ship scan and data analyzye a few low power structures, and was a bit spooked by the sounds I hear. Similar, but maybe a bit different? Never heard it before.
---
If we understand Caesar’s assassination in the light of the EVE Online context, all the pieces of the puzzle neatly fall into place!
---
Yup, on rock havens with a Thanny my method is:
---
1. Undock
---
2. Initiate warp to all havens one by one and cancel the warp immediately with ctrl space. Anything that has the message "My computer indicates.." is a rock haven, so save that one. Any one that doesn't, right click and ignore the sig
---
3. If you're alliance or corp has a call-out channel, then make sure no one claimed it. D-scan if it's in range on 5 degree just to make sure. Warp to closest rock haven
---
4. Align to citadel or POS in system on land
---
5. Cycle NSA just once upon land to stay at jump cap, and now with these new changes you can't warp anyway so just cycle it once per wave
---
6. If you land at 100km, sometimes you have to turn on the fighter mwd for them to get there
---
7. Lock the Pirate Gate at the center of the rock haven. When your fighters are idle, make sure they are are orbiting the center of the rock haven so they don't get shot at
---
8. Frigs - 1 fighter each (guns only)
---
9. Cruisers - 3 fighter each (guns only)
---
10. Battlecruisers - 3 fighter each (guns only)
---
11. BS - 3 fighters, guns and 1 missile volley only
---
12. Last wave BS - 3 fighters, guns and all 3 missile volleys. Should have 6-7 volleys and 6-7 battleships
---
13. On last Battleship on 2nd to last wave, begin aligning towards the next sig. Check callout, check dscan to make sure it's available. Check intel. 
---
14. If everything is green, recall fighters after last BS goes down and then initiate warp to next haven
---
15. Using this, if I can chain together enough havens, I get about 50-55M tics with a thanny with t2 fighters
---
Perfect loop. Well done

Krabictus is in Legacy? TIL
---
Problem is other CVA dudes/leaders don't seem to see an issue here and think it's okay because snuff are 'friendly'. I just hope they see the light before it's too late :/
---
Or maybe I've just got a tin foil hate on and am screaming at a shadow, but considering snuff seem to be bored af and just shooting anything within range atm it seems awfully likely to end this way.
---
The video that plays on the billboatds has sound. Depending on your settings, you may hear it or not
---
Yeah I officer hunt for a living. Each race has 4 officers from c-type to x-type. Most valuable mods are the ones without deadspace equivalents.
---
Yes I'd say I've transcended EVE. I can now enjoy the metagame without ever logging in, except to transfer ISK monthly to James 315. 
---
Signal Cartel bother me because they're white knights. And presumptuous one at that. They'll anchor those silly rescue cans in every wormhole system without even asking permission, which deprives the local residents of good loot and reinforces the misconception that ship loss is bad thing instead of a learning experience. Sure, mapping Thera is a fine public service, but they live there anyway, and to believe that they deserve PvP immunity for that is over the top. 
---
"You can play however you want in the sandbox—as long as long as you're willing to extend your hunters the same courtesy."
---
I really hate flying supers but it is kind of silly to hand wave away the fact that big super fights attract attention. I don't think the solution is scaling back the FAX nerf (instead, they ought to be refocused for specific activities like every other ship in eve) - but super fights are important for the health of the game.
---
It actually is that streamers that do giveaways and increase odds of winning for subs or those that donate that is not okay. If you just give shit away you're good.
---
How did NSH like their fleet being split between wormholes? That sounded fun to deal with.
---
I completely agree with you. :)

...wait.
---
is this op jdc 4 friendly?
---
My only concern is that CCP missed out on overhauling Marauders, maintaining the "Marauder Dilemma". They're rarely flown, hence they rarely get any balance attention, which leads to them being rarely flown...
---
Now if Marauders had a reduced mineral count and a more PvP oriented set of bonuses and abilities, they could actually work as dedicated capkillers.
---
Supers fighting *and dying* is important for the health of the game.
---
Haha, fuckem.

this is the kind of shit posting this sub needs to see more of.
---
I also made this suggestion :)
---
Exactly - if there is isk to be made, risks will be run.
---
4000 / 1100 = 3.63 Excavators so 3.
---
Pun Alert
---
As someone who just experienced having 3 of there expensive ships launched across space by a bubble and then having to chase them down in a pod. I feel this. 
---
Latency and lag ought to be factored into the meta considering they are a fact of life and all that.
---
NSA is not really a nerf under an umbrella so meh...don't bot and be on comms.
---
if it is safer and not much of a trade off, people would be doing it now.  when was the last time you saw a sebo fit carrier? 
---
Phoenix is easily the best haw dead for smaller engagements.
---
Thought so... 
---
This directly puts TEST in a better position relative to both GSF and Panfam. Test can't outform Goons or ncpl's supers on its own, but they can field large enough dread numbers to prevent their use (presuming the meta predictions ITT are true).
---
Its only a big deal if you are not in Delve so as long as you're not flair baiting I feel yeah brother. 
---
Moral of the story...when you try and Nerf Delve you only hurt everyone else.
---
that is perhaps the only redeeming quality of this post...
---
An hour earlier: 
---
&gt; Holy shit guys I just discovered a way to use my Orca as an enormous jetcan! What could go wrong?
---
Many have raised it as a concern, not just you Ariel, lol.
---
I wish this was valid in-game too lol. 
---
*!!!If you’re a vet and unhappy with the game, please read this and rethink why you’re unhappy with the game, or read just the last part!!!*
---
I’ll start off by saying sorry for the capital letters, as I’m posting through my iPhone and it automatically capitalizes certain words, but this will be a completely positive post.
---
anyway, as a new player I’m loving the game,  I love every aspect of Eve, even ratting and mining is fun when it’s not just done solely for profit.
---
Also I love the rng of exploration, you never know what you’ll find and the data sites that explode, taking the risk to open up more than two containers gives you an adrenaline rush. 
---
Just roaming around in space is an adventure as you don’t know what could possibly happen, if somebody could be hunting you, if a gate could be camped, if you’ll end up warping to a few hundred mil worth of wrecks or a fully blown war.
---
The pvp, coordination, the will of people to help allies or Corp mates is amazing, I love how I could be chilling in a station and next thing you know we’re on a mission to rescue a tackled friendly. I love how people are willing to lose their shit just to help someone, someone they might not even know or somebody that they might have never spoken to.
---
I have no hatred towards anyone in this game, it’s a game after all, I have been killed by probably most people in this game(newb). Regardless, enemies should exist, because content. But nothing should be taken personal, we are all here to enjoy ourselves and at the end of the day that’s all that matters.
---
All that being said, this game is one of a kind, the community is one of a kind, you will never find such a tight knit community as Eve in any other game. You will never find this type of content in any other game. You should appreciate what you’ve got.
---
*As a last note*,I know CCP can have its flaws, I understand why some of you might be upset or unsatisfied with them, but please understand it’s a business, they need to make money and they’re trying to please everyone (which is impossible), but at the end of the day they have created this amazing game for you, they have basically created a lot of great memories and great times, appreciate that and try to understand.
---
Sorry for the long post, had to let out the geeky fanboy out of me.
---
If you are so weak that you need redditors to make this decision for you, then you should probably skip Eve and hit up "Hello Kitty Online" or something similar.
---
I would definitely shoot the Astrahus, won't even bother with POSes, but any Upwell structure must go.
---
And they are some on point lizard pictures.

---
Provi literally CTA for a poco...
---
&gt;  Side question; how do I change the threshold for this?
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Audio_Alerts
---
soo... you want sentries and no drone assist limits to come back to carriers? slow cat concept was alot more than just a carrier, it relied on other elements no longer present in the game.
---
Yes, the randomness of deploying. Theoretically, if you could get the mobile depots to be exactly 6km apart from each other, they might both be close enough to the hitbox of the ship model to access both simultaneously. But in practice, the center of the Rorqual needs to be 6km away from the first depot to deploy the next one, which then deploys randomly somewhere around the hitbox of the ship, which makes this impractical.
---
If you don’t mind me asking, what type of ships do you usually use for officer hunting and how profitable it is, idc about isk p/h just in general also how common is it to find some if you put good effort into it
---
Since I started playing eve I wanted to try that, but I felt that’s kind of end game content for the big bad ships...
---
this is a dumb idea, try again
---
How about we let the currently proposed nerfs roll out and see how they go before we start trying to whine our way into a new set of nerfs.
---
I'm not saying they will be fine, I'm saying let's wait and see.
---
As someone who does not rat (or very rarely rats), i don't think removing auto-aggro is the best method to fix anoms/drone boats. Fixing anoms so they're not so easily AFKable/Bottable or making them more aggressive to drones would be better. Or adding towers that disrupt drones in some sites (make them randomly spawn, or make them ships with a special field of influence).
---
I'll give you one example of how drone aggo is useful to things outside of PVE.
---
You're in a battleship and jump a gate. On the other side is an Arazu, or maybe a Sabre that you know are hot-droppers. You won't be able to lock them quick enough to do anything before it takes them 4 seconds to tackle you and light the cyno. Sure, i could have neuts to neut out their tackle. But that doesn't really matter when it takes 15 seconds to lock them and only 4 sec's for them to lock me and have a cyno lit.
---
So, what does drone aggro have to do with this? Well, what you do is, right as you decloak, launch your flight of ECM drones as you're locking your target. If they scram you or aggro you in any way, there is a chance, they will jam him and you can escape before you can even lock him.
---
Same story with interceptors. They might be intercepting for a gang, and the gang is directly behind me about to jump in. If i need to spend 20s locking this inty, i'm dead. I can launch drones, and then the drones will ECM the inty once he aggro's and i can get away.
---
Bots would still be a problem.
---
Oh this is good
---
Please :clap:
---
CVA does, but there are provi entities that don't. he can also live in provi as a neut and get +5 from the local landowners in time.
---
Pings go through there, hell i can ping and have access to caps channel, I am neither an FC or have a capital, though caps channel is almost as much memes as coalition memes so :/
---
TL:DR Voltron discord is a mess
---
And when they just create a bot that just locks up the rats ? 
---
Yes bring back the finger of god
---
If they come to Solitude they will literally be the only other group here besides us. Not exactly a content rich environment for them. I wish they would come here :(
---
We have a winner
---
I do. Well, I care more about his than yours.
---
While dreads chew through supers they get slaughtered as well and lose the critical mass to overcome fax repps at some point.
---
The difference after the patch is the initial kills can be counted on, assuming execution without major fuckups instead of gambling on insufficient FAX numbers or other huge mistakes the super FC made.
---
Wait this isn't a Winnie Blues and VB Crew member, dafuq? 
---
&gt; outside the group-think 
---
please stop, my ribs hurts. you really think youre outside the group? (An another level of abstraction is required here). Did you ever thought about the fact that claiming to have "views outside the group" can be the most "in-the-group thinking" thing you can do? seriously dude once again wtf is wrong with you thinking this belong here
---
Stop bringing up irrelevant things just because you think it will allow you to shine and explain this and that about some very "problematic" thing about this game.
---
Just find a place where you can debate with people about serious social phenomenon, for example about how a company can have some problems with his communication (or the lack of it), i mean, i'm sure there is a lot of them out there and you'll have a good time doing so.
---
NOW PLEASE&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;this is just about Virtual SpaceShips for Bob's Sake!
---
And  OP &gt;&gt;&gt; start an alpha account, bring as many friends as you can, and try this fantastic game.
---
They just added some risk to a quite rewarding PvE ship like it's supposed to be. You can still light cynos or jump out. Everyone take a deep breath and move on with life....
---
&gt;You're saying I need an alt just for Orca boosts? Hold my beer.
---
You make laughable amouts of ISK/h per VNI/Ishtar while AFK ratting and they are lost easily, too. With the upcoming changes to the VNI I don't see any problem with AFK ratting, especially if people are getting forced to spread out more by the anom changes. 
---
The normal players who AFK rat in these ships shouldn't be punished and your solution isn't going to combat the botting menace. 
---
Your idea is bad because it's targeting the wrong people (CCP themselves said that VNI ratting is not a major ISK faucet) and forces these people to do a low ISK/h activity actively. CCP should introduce more PvE possibilities that offer good ISK for active playing that actually involve some kind of player skill. Once that happened, aggro changes to drones regarding AFK ratting can be discussed.
---
Faction have more hp and better tracking while t2 have more damage depeding on what your doing you mentioned a hs anom so faction make sense for the tracking.
---
I'm never zoomed in enough to hear it. I'm a Skirmish Commander and a filthy outlaw. Only time I zoom in is to see if caps are in sieged modes or what type of guns ships are packing.
---
I definitely noticed it today, though, and confirmed it was in game when the loot hauler heard it as well. So I was a bit freaked hearing it hacking an upwell structure.
---
Faction drone track better and have more HP.  Depending on your skills they might do a bit less damage.  
---
They are also don't require medium / heavy / sentry drone V so they are much easier to use. 
---
Also some people can't use tech 2 drones of certain types and use the federation navy types instead.
---
Better dps then the t1 verities and more hp with same fitting skills. Idr if there tracking better or not. T2 still have most dps but slightly less hp then your augmented versions.
---
Imagine how much better off the world might be if Caesar lived.

You can log into accounts as an alpha now. Before deciding if you want to plex or sub them. 
---
&gt;proposed nerfs roll out and see how they go before we start trying to whine our way into a new set of nerfs.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I'm not saying they will be fin
---
Can you show me where they listed a nerf to afk isk-making? I must have missed that point
---
marauder will deal with officer very good. lazy mode - carrier/haw dread or haw titan with boson
---
I mean really what kind of productive conversation are you expecting though? Your style of game-play is considered bottom of the barrel by most players from all areas of the game for different reasons, which seems like a pretty bad way to start a discourse. On top of that it's not like anyone is changing your mind here, whether it's sunk cost or just getting spoiled by a plethora of kills that took about as much input as mining I just don't really see you guys changing your approach until the mechanics of the game no longer allow it.
---
rf maelstrom for dunking people with 13k alpha?
---
Are you from 2010? :)
---
and evictus just docks up...
---
They specifically nerfed the VNI.
---
But who cares. The point remains that maybe we should let one set of changes shake out before we whine about something else.
---
I don't know what any of that means. Can you pretend you are talking to a stupid child, please?
---
Sure lets do your idea and drive players away. It won't stop the bots, just genuine players. active ratting is soul destroying at best and causes people to give up.
---
If their theory plays out as they think then this is a relative buff to TEST's position in the null meta. Goons and NCPL can outfield TEST on supers - this is the reason they blued goons. If TEST can now deny those 2 entities that super advantage via dreads then it is thus beneficial to TEST. They can put them selves in a situation where they lose every battle but win the war, in theory.
---
It wasn't worth it before the patch because the NSA bonus was better and you could warp off to a citadel to tether. Now, with the NSA bonus not being worth it, they can maintain an additional safety feature of simply jumping out.
---
What are the essential skills alpha players need to train up? 
---
This is a really good place to start.

Shut up ariel.

Just learn how to fly ships better dude. Do not justify afk-play style and economy where everything is free.
---
Today I was on my PC for 9 hours working and having  clients on the side. i made close to 970M ISK, just doing something else while my 2 VNIs were working for me. I just moved them every 20 minutes or so with 0 risk since I was keeping an eye on local.  
---
How is that not much and not retarded, killing the game?
---
That's whole another topic.
---
Quality. 
---
I don't like the idea of all botters (including alpha bots?) and skill farmers getting that much SP tbh.
---
That being said, CCP should probably look at login times or something (+only omegas, again because bots).
---
Probably a lot harder to distribute, but fairer.
---
The faction versions usually have lower DPS but have better stats in other places. Caldari Navy Vespas for example have twice as much shield HP as their non faction variant making them as tanky as a cruiser.
---
'Drive players away' lol. What players, those who do not play?
---
'Nerfed' :D
---
You used to have time. But your drones just took a pretty big hit to their max velocity 
---
I think everyone understands what you're saying, it's just retarded.
---
Will he stop after he got partnered?
---
I doubt it.
---
Excellent. Made me smile out loud. 
---
That cap resistance stat is a really nice one for wormholers, either for a Bhaalgorn or a FAX. I'm half tempted to make you an offer for it.
---
Fax 2.0 
---
You win, bro. The only debate I get from my sincerely held and expressed concerns about the topic at hand is personal attacks and demands that they be disallowed and silenced. It's just too tedious. I'm out. This snowball will keep rolling downhill. I can't stop it. But, be advised, I'm not the only one affected by this and if it doesn't stop, Eve will fail and what a shame that would be.
---
You do not need to wave your credit card at CCP anymore to play the game. Just download the client, log in and check your characters. The client is like 100mb or so and will not take long to download.
---
No i get it, but comment said that "it was even safer than before." Hence using Sebos would be the safe option now.  But nobody uses Sebos now because people value isk over safety.  And they will if these changes go into effect as well.  
---
What trailer? 
---
You clearly haven't been to impass recently. We try to keep caps out of catch for the good fights though.
---
Oh shit I am but a simple farmer in brave

Subs get more points=more tickets if I understand correctly. 
---
Full parity means everyone gets the same amount of points/tickets.

If he's likeable people sub just because of that. To everyone else he is selling lottery tickets while also throwing some to the mob.

It was ~450m a year and a half ago. :|
---
&gt;Fixing anoms so they're not so easily AFKable/Bottable or making them more aggressive to drones would be better.
---
While I don’t disagree that auto-aggro has its unique uses, looking at what would have to happen to render auto-ratting ineffective is pretty hefty in development cost. 
---
If ratting is made more player-intensive, that would require a fairly massive overhaul to the ratting/anom system. Quite the development cost to address what I consider a relatively small issue (I’ll explain below). If the new system is arguably fun and engaging then it would be worth it on its own, but I’m not holding my breath on that one. 
---
If anoms are made much more aggressive against drones, then it has the side-effect of nerfing any non-AFK drone usage as well, which is the opposite of the intention.
---
The easiest solution I can think of is to somehow make the drone A.I. recognize the difference between NPC aggro and player aggression and then disallow the former. Unfortunately that still leaves some other legitimate areas of use non-viable as well. 
---
When it comes down to it, I don’t think auto-aggro rafting as a unique problem deserving too much attention. Now we’ll set the argument aside about whether or not someone is truly AFK while ratting or just minimal input ratting (while possibly doing something else in or out of game) for a moment. I don’t think it is entirely a bad idea to allow some level of AFK or semi-AFK ratting as we also have the almost same exact thing with regards to mining. The only major differences really come down to how much income one or the other generates. They’re both fairly mind-numbing activities that I personally wouldn’t want to force arbitrary action requirements upon pilots who rely on ratting/mining for income. I’m happy to include a much more drastic difference in results as a reward for engagement, but I find it more important that the engagement be at least a little bit fun. We need to be fully aware that the most accessible PVE content for most people is also the content most likely to form discontent and drive people away from the game.
---
There’s a desperate need for better PVE in Eve, but auto-ratting is honestly one of the smaller concerns about it. 
---
fuck stop :(
---
low does a low power even have tether.....
---
MGC and MGE were only added in like 2016 iirc, I'm guessing they just didn't wanna mess around adding faction ones to loot tables n stuff until they saw if people were actually gonna use them and then it just kinda fell off the map?
---
I would use the fuck out of a faction MGC personally.
---
But CCP included it in their TOS. Nevermind other games.
---
Why OP specifically points out a goon might be for personal or political reasons, neither makes it less of an offense.
---
Should other EVE streamers who do the same also be punished if this one is? Absolutely!
---

Because you touch yourself at night.

You are now able to access EVE without a subscription as there is now a F2P element. There are some restrictions on it, but for just checking stats it’s perfectly fine.

As for checking online, the only way to do this is through third-party sites and applications. You’ll need to grant them ESI (formerly API) access to do their jobs.
---
I used to shoot one target per fighter and let them fire a missiles volley each on their respective rat, if it's a BS.
---
That was one hell of a click fest...
---
I since then long retired from carrier/super ratting...
---
I don't particularly like AFK gamestyle and don't do it. But it's currently one of the best options to make ISK and circumnavigate boring low-pay PvE activities. Until this problem is solved by offering better active PvE-ingame activities that also cater to newbros I don't see a reason to change drone auto-aggro.
---
Don't forget that changing drone aggro also impacts PvP and this impact must be considered before making a drone change for a couple of spinning VNIs.
---
Currently the normal player activity of AFK ratting is certainly not breaking the game and CCP already balancing this with changing respawn times of anoms. Botters don't care for any change of anom timers or drone aggro, they can rat 23/7 and add some lines of code for auto-F every now and then.

As someone who mainly play video games for immersion, in general, I like this idea.   
---
The first picture that popped up in my head was to happen upon a "derelict" station, forgotten or just not maintained well by the original owners. Could look cool!
---
Yeah,  that's what I was doing primarily,  and the event sites have become more of an issue for a VNI specifically due to AI changes (and more competition for the cans).  I had switched to Gilas to run the sites better, but the health nerf for the drones will be a big hit on that.    Better to run a full missile ship now.

While i'm no Dev, they already have assets in the game that can damage drones and reduce optimal range (Abyssal Towers/effects). The intent would be to implement those features into ratting anoms as part of each spawn or make it random so its harder for bots to adapt/update the software. This could be either a static tower (like the webbing towers) or a new ship part of a spawn that needs to be killed first. So it would slow down the afk isk making unless the person is nearby to manually focus the tower/ship and kill it first.
---
&gt; If anoms are made much more aggressive against drones, then it has the side-effect of nerfing any non-AFK drone usage as well, which is the opposite of the intention. 
---
While i agree with that, its strange to me, remembering when i used to rat all the time that i'd be using things that weren't drone boats (my go to ratting ship was a 1400mm machariel). There was a lot more variety in PVE ships out in space back then. Youd have maelstroms, machariels, nightmares, rattlesnakes etc. No one really complained about using turret ships back then. Now ofc, everyone feels entitled to their afk or semi-afk drone boats. Personally, i don't think it would be terrible if drone boats got punished a little more to create diversity in space. I doubt it'll ever happen though. I also get that people just want income to pew pew. But there is a difference in 23/7 farming VNI's and Farming a few anoms in your VNI. You can clear a site faster in a turret ship than a drone boat to get through your isk making daily ritual than you could a VNI, you just have to be active. Less time in PVE = more time in PVP.
---
&gt; The easiest solution I can think of is to somehow make the drone A.I. recognize the difference between NPC aggro and player aggression and then disallow the former. Unfortunately that still leaves some other legitimate areas of use non-viable as well. 
---
That's fair. But going back to dev time and reworking mechanics. I wonder how deep "POS Code" goes into aggro mechanics that they could easily tweak something like that.

Making ratting more complicated by adding towers or ships that need to be primaried isn’t going to seriously hurt bots. People already bot explorer asteros and supers, both of which are way more complicated to do than dealing with any of the potential changes to anomalies would be. 
---
And if you do make VNI ratting impossible to afk, you’d have to either significantly increase the income from it or people would just stop doing it. Maybe they’d do abyssals, exploration, or mining. Or maybe they’d quit. But the current sites are balanced around a low reward for a low effort, and you’d need to change both to keep subcap ratting viable 
---
We brought in a full set of chess pieces before they had their pieces placed. They managed to get theirs in on day2 and we played a match. We won. After that we brought in a good few more sets to be sure but they already gave up. With total freedom we brought in everyone whos blue and wanted a piece of the cake (wasnt hard to find volunteers). It resulted in that 1500 man killmail some people like to focus on when telling the story.

A lot of what you see comes down to skills.  Faction mods typically have better fitting and fairly universally have lower fitting requirements.  Take the Micro Auxiliary Power Core for example.  They're basically only used on frigates and destroyers since they give a power grid boost in absolute PG, instead of a percentage of the hull's existing PG like the RCU and PDS do. The T2 version uses 18 CPU and grants an additional 12 PG but it requires Capacitor Management V (a rank 3 skill) in order to fit.  For a mod that's supposed to go on to the class of ship most available to newbros, a rank 3 skill at level 5 is quite a barrier, especially when the entire point of the mod is to make it easier to fit the ship.  The Navy version, on the other hand, grants an additional PG for a total of 13 (which goes quite far on a frigate) but only requires Capacitor Management II and Power Grid Management 3... which is another way of saying it needs fuck all in terms of skills in order to use.  This could be one reason why you see faction used over T2 in many places, not just drones.

Well, *if* the reduction in insurance payouts is applied to supers, *and* if the Rorqual changes drive the prices of ore back up, then it will be extra useless to insure your supers. 
---
I do not know how I feel about this because, on the one hand I think CCP is right to:
---
1. Reduce isk faucets; and 
---
2. Protect against insurance fraud, both now and in the future if supers get cheap again;
---
That being said, insurance in and of itself is a *great* isk sink, but if it pays out 6 billion on a 25 billion hull, people will utilize that sink very situationally, which will lessen the positive impact of the sink.

They increased the VNI's sig radius meaning it will get hit harder. And they removed the drone speed bonus. Drone speed, tracking, and damage are the primary factors that affect the size of your ticks in VNIs.

&gt;The subreddit is still shitting on them for doing something pretty trivial and jacking off about it forever.

Will still easily have time if you pay attention, it's 25%. I run a drone navigation link 2 anyway, so the speed will be 5% faster than a shield VNI.

Aw my mistake. That's less bad.
---
That's right if you wanna be a real player you gotta break out that credit card to make your isk. If you rat for isk you aren't a true eve player right?
---
Obvious is obvious and I pointed that out.
---
Ticks won't be that impacted for the most common anoms - hubs and rock heavens. Once the drones reach the cluster or rats, their speed is irrelevant in mist cases.
---
It would be less bad if there was someone piloting the ship.

Our wormhole connected with of sound mind the other day. We decided to roll the connection but the hole wound up crit. They bumped our rolling cruiser off the hole and prevented us from closing it, which was a cool play. Then they brought a helios, vedmak, jackdaw, and hyperion through to fight our mostly t1 BC fleet which collapsed the hole and locked them in with us. We had a good fight with losses on both sides, and during the fight their helios scanned the new connection and the hyperion escaled before running out of cap boosters. I felt like that was a really ballsy and slick gameplan on their part, and I wanted to give them props for their skill and a fun battle!

Belt ratting is extremely newbro friendly. A VNI will do perfectly well as you are normally not tanking any amount of DPS, and if you get an officer you need to run away and get help anyway. ISK is good but i cant really quantify it. I made 70b in 2 months which is far more than I could have ratting in a carrier / super because I can't maintain either of those mind numbing activities like I can belt ratting / chatting with people on comms. Only belt rat in Venal, Delve, Fountain, Stain, Curse, or Cobalt Edge as those are the home regions of the factions and therefore have the top tier officer spawn available to spawn. I use Ishtars but have a 1300 dps tengu I use as well. VNI with a medium armor rep, hardener, and 4 DDAs is more than sufficient. Use a 50mn mwd, heavy drones not sentries, and fill your mids with drone nav comps and maybe a cap battery.
---
Keepstars are kinda expensive, and you can warp into a pos and be safe with a weapons timer, unlike warping to a citadel.

Imo they could even reduce the yield by 50% and get rid of the indus core so that the rorqual could get a chance to warp off if hostiles enter system.

Tell me again how they aren't true eve players because they aren't playing how you like. 
---
If you want them to engage you need to offer them something engaging that replaces the amount they get currently. Otherwise they will just stop or start botting when you remove their ability to do this. And i think that botting is worse than spinning havens in a vni semi afk.
---
It's INIT. and this is /r/eve. Can't ever let something positive be said.
---
Well sitting there and doing nothing while content is available is boring so wouldn't be surprised if you do nothing while jerking each other off on comms about how good of a form you had, wouldn't be the first time.
---
In theory once they reach low power, people will go kill them.  But in null that isn't going to happen so yea, a decay mechanic would be great.  
---
I highly recommend making your titan pilot an alt, so it's available when shit kicks off. You'll also want to be in an alliance that actually has the balls to use them, or it will just be a jump bridge machine. NCdot, Pl, Goonswarm, are basically your options. Maybe TEST, but I'm really not sure on that, one of their members would need to speak on it. The alliances I listed all have super capital SRP, which makes using your super/titan a lot more realistic. 
---
That all being said, I love my titan. It gave me a goal to work towards, and a great sense of accomplishment when I finally got it. My super however, I really hate. Attempting to use fighters in epic TiDi is terrible, and every large engagement just turns into a SSF battle that is boring(and carriers are equally good at). On top of all that fighters just create more lag in large fights, and really should just be removed from the game in favor of drones.  So unless you're buying a super for ratting (which was amazing, but I'm not sure how it is now), I really don't see a point in not just skipping it to invest in a titan instead.
---
thank you for posting this thread /u/windsigh, i hope you'll have a great weekend (✿◠‿◠)
---
Considering that VNIs sig/speed tank, and depending on skills, they sometimes barely get up to speed without dieing, increasing the sig radius could impact VNI ratting anywhere from "not at all" to "it doesn't fucking work anymore".
---
So how about we let these changes shake out a bit before we try to whine our way into another nerf?
---
The advantage (or disadvantage, depending on if you like the fights or not) of fighting snuff over PHEW is that snuff will get bored and move on sooner.

But dude, people were upset that if you drop 2-3 trillion worth of assets on their 70 billion isk eagle fleet, it got killed. It's just UNFAIR!!!! \*eyeroll\*
---
I think you are underestimating the effect of the signature radius increase. It increases the damage you take from the missles. And makes them get more glancing blows instead of misses. This could potentially tip the 100mn shield VNI into eventually breaking.
---

Depends entirely what class you're in and what statics you have.
---
Most lowclass connections are easily rolled with a rolling battleship (Megathron/Apocalypse/Raven/Tempest) fitted with a higgs rig and a BS-sized prop mod (500MN/100MN)
---
Without the prop running you'll have a mass of around 0.2b (often called "cold"), with the prop running youll have a mass of around 0.3b (often called "hot").
---
By taking advantage of the mass status of the hole, you can safely close all lowclass holes using these increments in mass. Eve uni wiki or similar will have a detailed guide, but you can use my rolling chart here: https://i.imgur.com/1cDtujd.png. Different wormholes have different masses, so you will have to look up what your statics are to see how you need to roll them.
---
In addition, you may need a HIC fitted with ZPMEs (Zero point mass entanglers) which reduce your mass. These are used when a wormhole is left critical to enable you to roll the hole safely.
---
In highclass you just use a capital ship to close the hole in one pass.
---
On another note, this is your third or fourth post on r/Eve looking for help that is available on numerous guides online. As recommended previously, join a corp and learn there, doing this alone is more effort than fun.
---
Sorry to break this to you like this, but if you are planning on mining in HS you are the "lowlife" player here... like, right at the bottom of the food chain.
---
But hey, we all start somewhere, go to "People and Places" or whatever that folder is called, search for whatever corp/player you want, add as contact and set standings as you will. Make sure your overview is properly set to show it.
---
&gt; Your style of game-play is considered bottom of the barrel by most players from all areas of the game for different reasons, which seems like a pretty bad way to start a discourse.
---
Yeah I get that, but I think that a lot of time a lot is assumed about what WE specifically do and the extent of everything we do. I understand that there's a lot of bad practices where groups are endlessly dec'd, noob-friendly corps have been farmed by others, and the elusive / risk averse behavior of the average player... Not all Highsec PVP groups are the same. Yes we farm Jita and that's mainly because most of the content is consolidated in that area, but we do other stuff in other areas of Highsec and Lowsec as well. I understand that Pirat account for all the groups using and abusing wardecs, but Pirat and Marmite are by far the most talked about groups, so I feel the need to clarify.
---
As I'm typing this we're literally brawling with a Nullsec pvp corp that we've duked it out with before multiple times. The conception that all we're doing is killing new players is strange to me, because of the current state in which we find Highsec wars... The truth is that the overwhelming majority of kills that we get are on pilots from Nullsec. Sure there's new players thrown into the heaping pile of corpses, but they lay next to veterans and all sorts of experienced players as well. 
---
If the greater Eve Online community actually cared about new players then they'd use the available mechanics to keep them war immune while using ACL's and corp / alliance standings to have them operate with the main alliance. 
---
And we just had round two, brawling with them...
---
&gt; On top of that it's not like anyone is changing your mind here, whether it's sunk cost or just getting spoiled by a plethora of kills that took about as much input as mining I just don't really see you guys changing your approach until the mechanics of the game no longer allow it.
---
I will say that I'm definitely more open-minded than a lot of the people that share an interest in Highsec wars, but it's kinda hard to respond positively when I'm being called names :) I posted a wall of text, and most of the replies here have ignored it and instead focused on talking about how wars have been in the past instead of discussing how to make wars the best they can be for everyone in the future. 
---
....and round #3 brawling...

So I think that the average person here doesn't fully understand the efforts we go through to do what we do. Yeah we kill all sorts of ships from the weakest hauler to people flying formidable pvp ships, but what you don't see is what we're doing to decloak DST's, cloaky T3's, and others using the cloak+mwd trick. You don't see what we do to hunt and catch the whales we get. You don't see how we theorycraft within the mechanics we're allowed to use in order to get an upper hand. The other day some of the Russians caught a Hecate from The Bastion carrying 150b in officer mods. When you see that a simple Hecate dropping 150b, wouldn't you lower your standards in what you kill?
---
I'm not saying this is complicated stuff here, but what I'm saying is that it's profitable, the hunt and anticipation of killing something big is neat, not getting blobbed by capitals is awesome, some of the niche activities we do are cool, and most importantly we're all enjoying each others company and having fun. I can't stand the elitism that is spewed by so many people. Is camping a pipe looking to pop industrials in a Sabre better? Is sitting in a fleet of 50, 100, 300, ...700 people that much better? There's been an incredibly noticeable difference in the amount of pilots that are war eligible, so the notion that we're just killing new players is a shame. I mean isn't war eligibility enough? If you as a new player don't want to die or if you want to shield your new players, put them in a war immune corp / alliance. Simple.

&gt;  I was omega at the cutoff date yet didn't get the SP.

I didn't either, until today. You'd think it would have been one single distribution but my accounts missing the SP (3 of 4) have now all been credited. :CCP:

Banding together to protect each other is one thing.

23/7 krabbing for no purpose other than watching your wallet number go up, then docking and logging off the minute a neutral shows up 15j away in intel channels is risk averse nullbear.
---
Didn't you used to hang out with RC?
---
I will keep that dream alive. Best find I ever had was a tengu wreck on some backwater hisec gate with 400mill worth of mods inside, which was a huge amount of isk to me back then.

*sigh* wheres the joan-of-ark revelation dino?

I too have an irrational hatred for people who play the game differently than me. And 100% agree those people should remain undocked to make nice easy soft targets for "elite pvpers" and their small gang roam. /s

Fuck that thing 
---
&gt; Strange bc they should be there. Mine are there. Maybe wrong account?
---
I think CCP might have had to run a restore of their accounting DB or something because the ones I didn't get paid until this morning had the exact same thing; two entries  from 2017 and nothing else after, even though it had been subscribed nearly all of the intervening time.
---
Eve when they go bad...

Genocide Event, when?

What they did was noteworthy because no other motherfuckers achieved breaking HK or a WH keepstar. The subreddit shit on them for boasting about it the way they did.

Then tell me what you would have these people do when people come roaming into their space? They aren't going to be able to stand and fight in their pve fit VNIs.

I'm part of a low-sec alliance of PVP fellas with a decent general skill level. I took a year away for RL including buying a house &amp; getting married. When I came back, instead of hearing "you're a scrub" and "git gud" as I shed the rust of not playing for a while, I was welcomed back with support, updated fits, and patience while I filled supportive roles in our fleets getting my space-legs back. Nice having a community/EVE family that I know I can always come back to and know they'll be in my corner while I re-learn how to fleet well again!! :) :)
---
Went to what ehhh. Then lowsec. I enjoy lowsec.
---
Find somebody in code, go to their alliance page, and at the bottom there is a button that says “add contact”. Click it and you can set their alliance as red.
---
&gt;they already have assets in the game that can damage drones and reduce optimal range (Abyssal Towers/effects). 
---
My concern wasn’t that they couldn’t put effects/mechanics to hamper drones, my concern is that it hampers all drone boats. Even those who are (granted they may be rare) actively engaged in the task. Those effects won’t differentiate between an active player or an AFK one. It essentially becomes a “no drones for PVE” setup that also hurts even non-drone based ships that rely on drones for utility purposes or small tackle clearing. The goal should be to discourage/prevent a specific way of doing things, not inhibit an entire weapon system.
---
&gt;The intent would be to implement those features into ratting anoms as part of each spawn or make it random so its harder for bots to adapt/update the software.
---
That’s a bit of a separate issue. It does need to be clear; bots and AFK ratting are two separate issues. If you target drones with a nerf when your target is actually bots, you’ll end up just making bots move to whatever the next easiest method is. Bots are already complex enough to run sites with most weaponry and ships, so it’s incorrect to assume that drone auto-aggro is a key part of their function. If it’s not Drone boats then you’ll just see tengus or vindicators or whatever the meta shifts to. 
---
&gt;There was a lot more variety in PVE ships out in space back then. Youd have maelstroms, machariels, nightmares, rattlesnakes etc. No one really complained about using turret ships back then.
---
I would hesitate to use your or even my own personal experience as a proper assessor of that kind of meta. For as long as I remember, there has always been a strong contingent of drone boats as the staple of low-effort ratting. Before VNIs it was ishtars, and before the capital changes carriers were also common. Though I will admit that balance changes to drones and drone boats have made them much more viable/profitable. 
---
It’s entirely possible my experience is skewed and you are 100% correct. But I will point out that “no one complained about turret ships back then” ignores that fact that nearly *everyone* complained about how boring anoms were. Ratting all day is exactly the trap that most new players (including myself at one point) fall for and end up quitting the game. 
---
Don’t mistake my argument here as a desire to encourage or maintain this kind of pseudo-passive income. My argument is more along the lines of not encouraging more time spent doing arguably the least well-designed and most common activities in the game.
---
&gt;You can clear a site faster in a turret ship than a drone boat to get through your isk making daily ritual than you could a VNI, you just have to be active. Less time in PVE = more time in PVP.
---
This does have some truth to it, but remember that VNIs aren’t popular because they’re good at their jobs, they’re popular because they can do the job the easiest. Also, AFK VNIs tens to have lower performance than active VNIs. You can pretty much see that in how the majority of them are fitted. An active VNI would benefit substantially from some turrets and fitting tweaks. But those tweaks require more effort and involvement.
---
When it comes to doing a boring and repetitive task, it’s not about how quickly can it be done, it’s about how little attention you need to do it. Going from something so easy you can watch TV at the same time to having to stare at red icons all day is a massive leap in effort (and equally large loss of brain cells). When the activity itself is boring and disliked, that extra effort really needs to bring enough reward to justify no/low effort options. Especially when you consider it from the point of “why am I even doing this, games are supposed to be fun”.
---
I don’t like passive isk generation more or less than anyone else. I just know that the VNI plague is not as unique or special as it seems, and I also understand that I hate that the most accessible way to make isk is also the least fun (for me at least, I assume many others) and that is the root cause. Because of that fact, I know that targeting a specific ship or weapon system is just going to push problem somewhere else. We delete drones today, tomorrow it’s just nothing but mackinaws/rorquals to replace them. So long as the gameplay around anoms is bad, the lowest effort solution will always become prevalent. Constantly needing the FOTM low-effort income is not something I find to be a good exchange.
---
I guess this only makes sense if HK were the ones claiming Rage was unassailable
---
otherwise it's just a strawman you're building up so you can tear it down
---
Fun/hr is most important to me.  
---
Eve is full of special little wizards that make pvp worth while :)
---
Ok sure but it sounds like you're essentially arguing that HK didn't prepare for Goons + INIT to invade rage...when they didn't know you were coming. Sure, of course that's why you won. Obviously, no one wants you to give your enemy a heads up that you're invading. But it's a bit strange to claim that you had a fight at all when the fight was over by the time HK knew it had begun.
---
So when you say this: 
---
&gt; "we also totally didnt have our own blobb to bring in cause we follow the wh bushido"
---
how does that reconcile with this:
---
&gt; They tried to get panfam in so
---
I'm just not sure the stories here match up. I've got no lost love for HK, but I really didn't hear most of the people in HK I know complaining about the invasion. They kind of all figured someone would do it sooner than later.
---
i like the local pirates taking over it. maybe it could have some incursion like properties (in null sec) forcing sov holders to clear out the junk. Or add some loot drop that can equal up to the market value of the structure making it an option for people to go and clear these out destroying the structure.  
---
4 weeks low power, tether mechanic fails  
---
6 weeks acl lists fail everyone can dock (only  structure owners can take control)
---
8 weeks pirates start camping undock like at gates
---
10 weeks increased pirate presence
---
12 weeks pirates take over citidel
---
then every week the pirate presence in system becomes stronger and more agressive
---
tbh, I never understood why I shoul dwatch ppl play a game at all when I can just play the game myself vOv

Get your permit today!

Federation Navy Comet. When I first started learning solo pvp in FW space, 2016, there were so many of them flying around crashing the t1 party. So my goal was to get good enough to destroy one in a t1 frig. I was so proud of myself when I finally killed a blaster fit comet in my dual tank breacher. It was like my first eve goal that came to fruition. I only wish I was using obs back then. West Chemistry.

I still do it that way and yeah, it IS a frikkin click-fest. But I only do very few sites in a row and then do something else, so its not that big of a deal.

Is this an unironic "didn't want to win that fight anyway"?
---
half of eve also flies a VNI. half of eve can also fly a loki. All ships should be viable. escpecially ones that most of the playerbase can fly.

And viable doesnt mean they need to dominate like supers have done for the past few years.

I don't judge high sec miners. People do what they want, and all that Veldspar has to come from somewhere. I'm only mining for the career arcs, then it's off to an epic arc and a corp for me!

Your brain's stick figure workers don't understand physics. They would have more success by pushing on the edge of the door, closer to the middle (away from the hinges), rather than push near the hinges as in the first picture of the door or push near the middle in the second.

Calm down carebear. Oh yes. I know all about you guys. Docking up. Afraid to fight until you got win win numbers and ships. Carebear PvP.

that sounds like a lot of fun! im glad both your teams committed and you all got to have a good time 🙂

Yeah that tends to be what draws me back as well. I’ve made lots of great friends. I know I’ve thanked you before for your blog, but it’s content creators like you that drew me to play and break into the gameplay that I enjoy so much. :)

tldr plz

Aw, well that sucks. I sorta hoped I had one more season left.

wow The Scope is behind The Discourse on news stories... kinda amusing   
---
but DAMN A NEW SCOPE VIDEO 
---
i didn’t care much either way about the posts, but the people getting mad about them made me laugh :)
---
It applies to this as you remove auto aggro more bots would be prevalent.
---
I think it would be enough to simply disable tethering and reduce the structure to a single layer of hull on low power.
---
"servers can't handle the numbers" no shit sherlock. whats the max population in other games.  maybe 32 people on the same map?  maybe 50 in a MMO.
---
any more and they get connection problems of recieving all the packets from everyone about every command they give, and sending it out to all players.
---
TIDI lets hte server have the time it needs to do this. which for several thousand people is damn impressive.
---
so instead of being hardcapped to maybe 100 people per system,   or crashing whenever 200 people enter system.   the game remaisn steady into the thousands.
---
so no,  if you want to play a game without TIDI go to Star Trek Online. it will fit you well.
---
Pretty damn sure there is a entire season after this about what happens to the impact site ect 
---
Hah, I sure hope so, thanks &lt;3
---
If not I dreamt it all
---
CCP are very resistant to anything which means players could go on a long break and their stuff would be gone, so a decay that ends up with them not being able to dock probably won't fly.
---
But a decay process that removes tethering, lowers resists and allows or encourages NPC harassment would be interesting.
---
We anchor bubbles all the time in wormholes

And you assumed I'm a nullseccer because?

Staged.
---
Yeaah I mean...not sure how I feel about that tbh
---
Like, you're right - that's definitely true. But NCPL/Goons can also outfield TEST on dreads, they don't *have to* commit supers. So I can definitely see what they mean when they say it will disincentivize using supers, because it's just better for everyone to use dreads all around. 
---
I'm totally okay with that though, but I know that's an unpopular opinion. People that own supers want to use them. They *are* an oppressive force though. There have been plenty of groups that could easily field a hundred dreads, but definitely not a hundred supers - and I'm happy to see a buff to those groups (TEST included, though I know they have plenty of supers). Way more dreads and less supers in these brawls is a good thing in my mind because the barrier for entry is low.
---
Regardless though I am not convinced that's how this will play out. I don't think the nerf is substantial enough for that. I'm going through the numbers in more detail when I have time but from what I've seen so far I am not at all convinced that this will be as oppressive as Vily is claiming here. 
---
If I cycle between omega and alpha, when you are back on omega do you lose those skills that you had learned before while on omega the previous time? As a noob I had a strategy of learning all alpha skills quickly and playing as alpha, then move up to omega when needed...something to that effect. thoughts?

You're right, that is season 3. The asteroid crashing into venus was the end of season 2.

Good post.
---
Personally I don't like how sirens/dromis can even web and point you at all, at ranges as far as the fighters can travel. This stands on the toes of people flying tackle or support subcaps and is one of the main complaints when it comes to the carrier meta. Carriers should not be able to do as much damage as they do, while essentially having pocket tackle frigates they can launch at will. It is why you see people dropping pure carrier/fax squads because they don't need anything else.
---
If people want to use carriers I believe they should require a subcap presence on grid as well, so you can secure tackle before you drop the hammer. Maybe it stops people dropping carriers willy nilly because carriers currently are strong independent ships who don't need no support.

1. Are there 'best' regions to go to if I'm pursuing faction DED complexes? I've heard that there are ideal regions for each faction, like a home region of sorts, where things like Officer spawns are more likely and I'm curious if any of that is true, or affects DED spawn rates. My goal is to use a Tengu to go for Gurista's complexes, specifically. 
---
2. What is the best way to find these complexes? Scan every system, or do anomalies and hope for escalations? And do different anomalies have different escalations? Ex: If I want the 6/10, do X, but if I want the 10/10, do Y?
---
3. Any links to blingy Tengu fits I can take on an exploration road trip?
---
Romani ite domum!
---
thx for the tip! 
---
I hate to say it u/StainGuy but I don't think there will be anything that will stop ratting carriers from switching to sebos. Being stuck for up to a minute when hostiles show up is just too great of a cost in a ship that realistically can only handle a small gang on its own. They are only fit to maximize ticks and buckle under neuting pressure and even with a cyno probably won't be saved in time before they go boom.

This might be a common misunderstanding, but the New Halaima Code of Conduct also applies to those who only do the epic arc mining.

On the upside, the 10m permit is valid for a whole year, giving you lots of time to complete the arc, and even conduct more mining if you like it.

Simplistically, big groups can build dreads much more easily than small groups.
---
Afaik there never were any. There never was and still isn't any point in having a large alliance in high-sec. Incursion groups run on "whoever comes" basis, high-sec mining is mostly meaningless, only used as introductory grounds for new players before they move I to renting alliances, high-sec pvp is just ganking. So, my guess would be trying out something like eve-uni's mining classes?..
---
Basically, while you are alpha any skill restricted to omegas only won't apply. You won't lose the SP. but neither will you be able to say sit in a dread, even if you have it trained. You however use SP beyond the 5,000,000 cap of an alpha as long as it is in alpha skills.
---
The reason I pointed out his fit was because I was trying to demonstrate that he didn't seem like he was Alpha or a newbie.
---
I have a thorough understanding of fittings. I am just surprised that people are more interested in tracking and drone durability than damage, because my drones track well enough.
---
I don't have skin in this fight, I just wonder if they plan on just killing it later on instead? Or at the weekend?
---
Hrm, so I wonder how they are going to balance two entropic disintegrators? Faster rampup but lower DPS? Or higher DPS but slower rampup?
---
Awww, I'm sorry your 400-500m/hr isk maker suddenly has some risk to it.
---
Why would we use them?  We can field hundreds of dreads instead, and now they're far more effective.
---
For sure, but competent players will mix sirens/dromis and supers will just go siren/dromi
---
You can easy fit up a magnate or a heron to fight explorers for around 10 mil. you will lose more of them and you need to somewhat know what you are doing, but I've seen battle asteros killed by a solo heron before. Also, don't worry too much about the isk. one good Shansha relic site can easily give you 50-70mil, and Gurista sites aren't much worse. It is suprisingly easy to make your first 100 mil in an exploration ship worth less then 2 mil. Just don't be afraid to die every now and then, and learn how to avoid hunters.

My trigger gets itchy every time I see one on dscan

Yikes, no clue what your talking about.
---
C4 connections to C2, C3, C4 (N766, C247, X877) holes are all 300kt per pass, 2000kt total volume. That means you want a ship as close to 300kt as possible, and you will need to do at least 7 passes. In reality that means 8 because you need an even number to not roll yourself out.
---
Any of the battleships which has a mass of under 100kt (Megathron and Raven are the two I use, but the other two factions have one too), with a large prop mod (+50 when active) and a Higgs rig (doubles mass) will do the job. You want an MWD because burning 10km back to the hole with a Higgs and an AB takes forever. The rest of the fit can be whatever you like, but something brawl combat capable is a good idea so you can give gankers a fight when you get jumped.
---
Holes have slightly random mass limits so sometimes you will be too conservative and leave the hole critical. To fix that you really want a HIC with mass-reducing ZPME mods and a 100mn/500mn prop mod. Go out 'cold' (no prop) with the ZPMEs active, so you have almost no mass; come back in 'hot' (prop active) without the ZPMEs so you have 50kt (or 100kt if you Higgs rig it). This makes it a near guarantee that you won't accidentally roll yourself out.
---
You can also do the HIC role in a cheap T1 industrial (Sigil) or cruiser with a 100mn AB fitted. Your mass outbound isn't as small so the chance of rolling out is higher, but still fairly low (about 1 in 6).
---
C4-C5 holes (H900) are similar, but have a 3000kt mass limit so you need at least 10 passes. You probably want to do 8 hot, 2 cold and then a final 2 passes (CH or HH depending on whether the hole is crit after the first 10) to close it.
---
C4-C1 holes have a 500kt limit but only allow 20kt through, so to roll them legitimately you need at least 25 passes. However, I think you can still meme the hole by initiating a jump in a 20kt ship and then activating a 100mn/500mn prop mod, to take 50kt (or 100kt if Higgs rigged) off the hole, in which case you can close one with 6 passes.
---
Alright. I wasn't certain how large a rorqual model was, so I didn't know if there was enough room to deploy 2 at once or not.

The november SP injection was due to the un-penalized injections. There was a booster that allowed you to inject 500,000 for each injector limited to 3/day.
---
I didn't mean to make presumptions about your skills/experience.  However, you do ask *"Why are people using faction tech 1 drones"*.
---
Everything that isn't a T2 drone is T1, yes, but, all the non-T1 versions of drones have higher meta levels than the T2. 'Integrated', 'Navy' and 'Augmented' are meta levels 6, 6 and 8, respectively.

And there's your problem.  Supers and titans become hangar trophies.

Why use a super to rat with the anom nerfs?  Just use a carrier because a super can't get new anoms faster.

Why escalate with supers or titans?  Always use dreads.

Imagine writing two paragraphs and posting them for potentially thousands of people to see because a couple circles on a virtual spaceship flip too much
---
I see wat u did thar. 
---
more region lock more more MORE!!!
---
good to know, thx!! i was worried about how to go about generating an income. now i need to read up on how to find these. haha. i also realize there are going to be hundreds of ways to generate income, i just need to start.
---
Man that's a wall of text. It makes sense though, fighters are so much faster and harder to kill than the tackle frigates they replaced, it's a little ridiculous. 
---
Making faxes not apply to subcaps at all would completely trash what's left of the WH meta though. 
---
I swear to Bob I’m not being sarcastic. I genuinely adore these videos.
---
Easy. Look up Lowlife. Coproration (in Snuffed Out alliance), add the entire corp to contacts, set negative personal standings. Done, now every Lowlife. player will appear red to you.
---
Dude thats the end of season 1!!!! You’ve got 2 seasons to go and it goes from strength to strength. Season 3 is the the shit!! Total epicness
---
OP here - can't miss a chance to plug the Eve Creative Discord, where we discuss making this kind of shit. [https://discord.gg/KpNQ9gr](https://discord.gg/KpNQ9gr)
---
&gt;  fighters are so much faster and harder to kill than the tackle frigates they replaced, it's a little ridiculous.
---
Bingo.  They should exist because they're a critical element in the fighter meta.  A lot of people treat carriers like F1 fleet subcaps, and once you learn the nuances of fighter management, it's a whole new world.  It's really fun once you get a hang of the fundamentals.  I don't want to see that kind of gameplay disappear.
---
&gt; Making faxes not apply to subcaps at all would completely trash what's left of the WH meta though.
---
Admittedly, I'm very ignorant about the WH meta. I was under the impression that in WHs with certain effects, subcap-supporting faxes were downright oppressive, especially given that, logistically, it's nearly impossible to move caps from one hole to another in order to counter.
---
Me too!
---
CCP has needed for a long time to understand that the world we Empyreans live in is *just* as important as the world we make for ourselves.
---
Art, stories, videos, character plays, *movement*. These things breathe life into EVE. 
---
I don't run sites in a supercarrier because that's for morons. Instead I actually \*risk\* my 3 dreads whilst making 3 bill an hour in C5 space. I'm just saying you're dumb if you believe you can ''pulse'' the NSA because you can't if you're actually trying to get some decent ticks in a super.
---
I never claimed anything, I just shared my own post from a year ago about the subject OP is talking about... what the fuck are you even talking about?
---
Hey, it's not a word for word repost, on Reddit that's practically OC.
---
Except Marauders were intentionally created as PvE ships.
---
Also, why would you use a marauder to kill caps instead of a dread?  The dread gives you more of everything you want in a "capkiller"
---
et tu brut(ix)!
---
Such tears.......  Maybe eve isn't right for you ;)
---
Mad bro is right.
---
I'm not happy with skill farms even being a thing. That's why someone doing that getting the SP like a hundred times doesn't sit well.
---
Neither am I.
---
Doesn't change that it's only a week of sp
---
its all about commands from your computer, to the server, and server sending the result of those commands to everyone in local to tell their clients to animate your actions.  welcome to networking hell.
---
Next possibility is also to **do initial col down on the MWD ability after the launch** - additionally reducing chance of initial tackle after jumping in.  
---
Nerfing base stats is quite bad at currently proposed level.   
---
You are every where on reddit. Whyyy
---
I cannot possibly agree with you more.
---
It is this rich tapestry of story, lore, artwork, video, the sound scape that make it a magical place to be in.
---
The lore roundtable, and that was a source of amazement when I first joined one, is typically jam packed. People *crave* story.
---
New Eden plays in a cluster of 8000 planets, the population is listed as ‘in the trillions’ of humans, the potential for story is infinite [which is why I’m writing an EVE novel at this point].
---
The lore master of EVE, and I’m so sorry I can’t come up with his name, told me that everything we do in EVE Online is lore by default. We, the pilots, *are* the story of New Eden.
---
I'm everywhere? Have you not seen StainGuy? Now he's everywhere.
---
This setup sounds fun!
---
Good post. 
---
*lose ....
---
But if they are competent players why shouldn't they have the upper hand?
---
because it doesn't take much competence to load dromis
---
This is magnificent. Well done.
---
Don't try to prove that you are smarter than CCP.              
---
You have advantage by really playing in this game. 
---
I'll take "Sewer Thoughts" for $800, Alex.

1. Each region is associated with a particular type of rats, the specifics can be found [here](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/region). Officer spawns are specific to the officer, and not every region has one. Most of them cannot be soloed in a tengu however.   
---
2. Scanning is better if you want to only run DED complexes and unrated complexes. 1/10-5/10 spawn in HS, 1/10-6/10 spawn in LS, and 6/10-10/10 spawn in NS. The EVE-Uni Wiki has a breakdown of [this](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Combat_sites).

Something like the above should work, basically a tengu with heavy, a probe launcher, and a cloak. There are several ways to go about fitting it, such as with an XLSB instead of a lLSB, or a 100mn AB. You can even combat fit it   
---
 with a scram and web if you want.
---
&gt; I'd happily welcome an explainer on it if you have the time, though. I'm really curious to know how they're typically used in WHs.
---
Sure, I love to talk about WH fights. A typical apex/bhaals deep WH comp is 2 dreads and a fax, plus whatever dps is in fashion (currently leshaks) + a few bhaalgorns and other support ships. Typically the last half hour after a fight is won is just shooting the enemy fax until it runs out of cap boosters, since it can tank basically any comp that fits through a WH and can't be neuted out anymore.
---
A pulsar WH effect changes the comp from armor to shield. Cataclysmic Variable is the WH effect you are talking about that buffs remote reps, but it also halves local reps, so the fax is actually vulnerable in those holes unlike everywhere else. In general though, leshaks have really eased the problem of oppressive faxes for now, although it would be nice if other comps could be used as effectively. 
---
I said three things there tbh, not even that last post makes sense buddy... don't smoke and post? Not sure what the right advice would be here, tbh you are just confusing me at this point.
---
No, I assumed you're a tool. 
---
FUCK YOU META SHOULD BE WHAT IT WAS 2005
---
So you keep making wrong assumptions one after another and seem proud about it?
---
Man, what a tool.
---
My penis needs this for chimera

thats like, your opinion man
---
TiDi is a solution not the problem
---
Looks amazing! 
---
if orienting my flow gets me a vedhac I'm fuckin down to clown 
---
So if I follow correctly, a FAX in WHs functions kind of like a grid/content anchor?  From what you say, though, it sounds like that in order to handle this, the meta variety takes a huge hit as you need high DPS ships like Leshaks in order to harpoon Moby Fax.
---
Is this sorta fight preferred over two sides slugging it out with each other without a fax present because one side would end up warping off too quickly, reducing overall content?
---
I found him!
---
not every coalition runs similar to panfam/horde.
---
03 and 04 were more fun
---
Keep on it. When you watched season 3, you will understand what exactly i meant. 
---
I dont want to spoil you, so i cant go into detail!

Try reading the rest of the subreddit.

Dude! The people these days don't have hobbies or understand how healthy having a hobby is.

What? Who? Me? I just watch the video a second time at .5 speed and try not to get distracted by the Newsreading Sloth they have.
---
Really. 
---
Totally it.
---
Not inherently. Competency is a low bar for how powerful something should be. It’s basically the difference between doing something correctly and doing something wrong. Even flown competently, all ships should still have gaps and weaknesses that simply can’t be covered.
---
A competent dread pilot knows to refit his ship with HAW guns, tackle, and active tank when fighting a small gang of subcaps. An incompetent pilot uses the same buffer-fit, capital gun, EHE fit that would normally be used for dropping on other capitals. Then proceeds to wonder why he couldn’t kill anything.
---
Took awhile but I found it. This is great! Another 5 minutes of work have passed thanks kind redditor.
---
I'm actually kinda taking suggestions, so. Noted. [https://twitter.com/MorCorrin/status/1106645457399361537](https://twitter.com/MorCorrin/status/1106645457399361537)
---
Just for the record though... if I do it, I do it for you, not your penis.
---
I kinda wish fighters were slow enough to justify allowing them to actually warp places. I know it sounds backwards but I honestly think things could be changed easily enough to add some value here.
---
Good meme^tic 
---
Got him!
---
Outstanding work!
---
Also, nice cross-cultural reference there :-)
---
Love this show, can't wait for season 4!

What really puts it over the top is changing the menu.

Thats not how site respawn work, source my corp is autistic enough to of tested it.

How many exotic dancers do you require for a drekavac version?

Asking for a friend.

This wuld kep carrier tics closer to what they currently are since application will be closr to what it is now. Especially if you need to give up application mids to use sensing boosters in order to lock NPC's Faster to keep tics up. Imagine not using an NSA because yu might get tackled whil rating.  It's importinte that krabs get their fair share of isk SAFELY. The isk glands must be palpated. Keep the isk flowing!!!!!
---
you're so fuckin retarded that you screwed up so much the bot should have it back. Didn't even notice the other free ship in your sma... do you even have eyes? oh sorry you're code...

hot damn i give up

Came for the shit post. Left satisfied.

Do rolling stones get buried in rolling holes covered by rolling stones?

If I had the time I'd have 20 hobbies I swear. Some people think 'watching TV' or 'going out drinking' is a hobby.
---
Completely worth the gutting of R10T. PMC is an absolute douchecanoe who isn't even suited to run a nooby mining corp.
---
True, but that isn't the point :)
---
Im complaining about carriers having roles that should probably belong on a sub.
---
That, and its a chance to use the big toys. Our dreads/faxes are really bling so its fun to get to try new fits and such. But its kind of our bragging rights thing, like, can you take a fleet thought a 3.3b hole and hold grid against an opponent doing the same? Usually WH corps are constrained by number of bodies, so having a fax instead of guards makes a lot of sense. Also its just what we enjoy, and the dps dreads are stuck in siege anyway so immobile logi isn't a huge problem. 
---
You might need some Help to find him ;)
---
i would like Sabre,Harbinger, Hurricane
---
I agree with that I was also thinking that maybe regular carriers should get a role bonus to decrease explosion radius (but keep the nerf in).  That way the nerfs would hit supers harder similar to how haw guns got a nerf but then a bonus was given to seige.  I do agree that support fighters need a nerf in addition.
---
There is not enough anoms, also  no one will be using NSA. 
---
put higgs on black0ops battleship and 500mn prop mod  u get 400m mass!
---
yes and ecm burst and target spectrum breaker aswell
---
thanatos,gnosis,onyx,phobos,redeemer
---
Perhaps CCP is adding the same spawn mechanics that they are to ratting Anoms to WHs.
---
And at several points we were holding hole control with like 20 guys. There were opportunities for things to happen for them. They saw the initial numbers and gave up before things had really developed. 
---
Make it 12-15 minutes. A WHer shouldn't be able to rage roll static WHs so quickly.
---
then citadel turns into  FOB. but if you hack it with data/relic analyzer you arenew owner but if u leave it  unused for  2 weeks  pirates will return

I'm pretty sure he'd agree that the sky tastes purple right now.

Did you forget to change reddit account before posting?
---
If you're going to make a fake reddit account, don't make it so blindingly obvious.
---
Maybe we can move into wormHole space and do the anoms there. Or perhaps extra IHub upgrade to level 1-20. Example: pirate detection array 9. Imagine a nul sec anom Better than a Sanctum! With high spawn rate of Faction titan Supercarrier.
---
Victory!!!
---
Wow that totally went over your head https://youtu.be/tZZv5Z2Iz_s i am talking about this lol
---
wat?
---
if by messy you mean it makes my jiggly bits flap wildly in the wind then yes
---
Well, you just proved that stupid still cant be cured, and knowledge still does not spread by itself.
---
Regardless of what the fuck the other people that have memories like a sieve tell you this was in the middle of season 2. Season 2 Episode 5 afaik.
---
If you finished the season, that means you finished season 2. There is already a 3rd season available and a 4th one is filmed right now.
---
Imagine being this stupid.
---
It was in the middle. The Expanse doesn't really follow standard season climax arcs. That's why you thought it was the end of season2, when it was in fact the middle.
---
anybody can survive podding if you can
---
Well this was a waste of five seconds. 
---
TiDi is a band aid on an issue they cant fix because shit tons of spaghetti code and CCP investing all profit from EVE into very successful spinoffs, VR Pong, and other great stuff instead of re-investing in keeping their moneymaker ticking and working well. 
---
Please tell us then, how does it feel, son?
---
Small gang fleet. 
---
“Oh look another small gang lets get em!”
---
“Oh look a cyno, warp the Frak out!”
---
Wasn’t often but when it happen, womp. 
---
My mistake, next time I'll make sure to make it explicitly clear that it's my most prized *in game* possession.
---
DED responding to the Discourse, Scope calling out CONCORD about keeping various things secret, seems as if CONCORD might be running into some trouble soon in the public opinion polls.
---
Niiice, Yeah I'll probably watch starting from season 2 again since my memory is pretty bad too.
---
I just started a rewatch last week, forgot how good the opening season was.
---
I know few null sec alliances that does not require pap ops or anything other thatn support industry activity. 
---
Yes, but BRAVE are essentially the cuckolded husband of TEST. BRAVE have done literally nothing but gatecamp GE- for the past 2 years, 0 offensive deployments, no ambitions or plans or anything at all really. All they've done is grinded ADMs and Supers, or donated 2 dozen token linemembers to TEST led deployments so anyone with any ambition, wish to use their super for more than krabbing or willingness to PVP within BRAVE just gets soft widoted into TEST.
---
you survive by cloning.  i wonder only if triglavian could survive in his suit because it looks hermetic,if pod/ship is gone and hes alive?
---
Thanks, Dad.   
---
Next you'll tell me that you require to check my math homework.  
---
If I get any wrong, you'll tell me how many and send me back to my dungeon.   
---
Actually, fuck you, Dad. Fuck you. 
---
If you want to masterbate alone on an empty server go to SiSi. Make yourself happy!
---
When I just started playing I joined a random Corp that happened to be at war with Test, I actually ignored them because I thought it was a test alliance but then I got spanked.
---
Officer hunters don't want to share
---
I'm glad I gave eve a second chance! :) 
---
Lol, how fat are your fingers?
---
FYI the stuff that is happening in the show is not in the right order they have cut bits and bobs from the different books to make the show

Now the show is good but the books am WAY better

Old school helios- like with the antenna, followed up with a big red stamp that says something like "Rejected"

Carriers shouldn't need subs.  This whole narrative is false.

look for red and white stripes.

Even Stainguy has standards.

It was actually pretty funny read.

This needs far more upvotes

There are structures for dead corps that have been low power for a year + and not died because of tz tanking. Decay would be great.

I was born a left flow in a right flow body. Now society says I can't be the flow I am because it's "not normal"

Really great game.

Beware the spods of March

Where are they?

Lore is what makes me want to come back into the game. I applied for ISD to be a lore writer but never heard back.

I'd frame it.

That was brutal , but I found him too. 
---
I mean, I'm OK with this.
---
Thanks Stainguy. You really are the Macguyver of this sub.
---
God damn after asking myself "am i blind?" for 10min i found him &lt;3 great work
---
All of the above but give archons and chimera two possible support fighters tubes 
---
They left out "capitals self destruct when target locking smaller targets"......there CCP fixed it
---
Disregard ISK, Acquire more Pylons.
---
I'm not a miner you idiot, I do the same shit you do from 10 REAL years.
---
Have you considered that no one's asking you for help and that you're being rude assuming they want any?
---
iirc yes, but it's been a while. :)
---
Calling this a masterpiece would be an understatement.
---
Well, there is one ally. Wangs. And Init is one and only alliance with a proper agreement regarding limits of hostilities in certain circumstances. Everyone else is a potential target. 
---
Half of a defensively minded fit rorq is 25k dps tank, so more like 12-13 leshaks to break it. What kind of clown car tank are you fitting to only get 10k dps tank?
---
Also, you still have ~5 minutes of PANIC to wait for a response fleet to save you.
---
Nice
---
Weird, I've never heard anyone say that the books are better than the movie/show. :p
---
Yeah, Season 3 is really good. The others are a bit slow to start.
---
No damage bonus then bonuses to other things would put it around the right dps ballpark.
---
Thought it was a mass effect reaper
---
Cut out the middle steps and just get into a corp that suits you, eve is way more fun with others.
---
horizontal flip on the quin on the right please. 
---
Yep, and then it will swing back completely in the opposite direction for 2 years.  Cycle continues until they bleed what's left of the playerbase.
---
I'm interested in learning as much of the game aspect as possible, plus I've heard the SOE arc is fun. But then, I'll find a corp for sure.
---
Uh. The Aether Wars thing they just asked everyone to help with is literally them investing in fixing this.
---
i think jay had it right when he suggested that supers should only have 1 flight of support fighters, and regular carriers none
---
Do you plan to sell prints of this - or a printable, digital version? I would \*love\* this above my desk :)
---
i my it's not a narrative, it's an argument about game design. teleporting supers that can apply perfectly to subcaps is shit gameplay 
---
Remove injectors
---
they could, but they won't
---
ccp exclusively makes short-sighted kneejerk changes and they exclusively make them one to five years too late
---
some people l know who like the show didnt even bother seeing if it was based on a book lol
---
hmmm
---
As a member of NJED, we thank you for your holy contribution.

Calm down miner 
---
Are the SoCT ships good for living in a wormhole and doing PvE? Are there any good fits for the Gnosis and Praxis that can take down most sleeper sites (C4 and under)?
---
A Tiamat ,  but its owner will only play the "sit in tether and dock back up game" 
---
These are pretty fucking retarded suggestions tbh with you mate.
---
Fighters already eat shit to a sub fleet, so reducing their mobility would make them even easier prey.
---
Fighters also already apply very poorly to anything mwd fit which is pretty much any cruiser down fleet comp.
---
The only thing carriers will have going for them is their projection range, and even that is nerfed given that they'll have to stay on grid for the NSA cycle.
---
Carriers will have no place in the meta once these changes go through. The only thing they will be good for will be bashing a structure from 200 off or killing battleships, one of the more rarely used subsets of ships in the current meta.
---
The rorq nerfs make me feel like a baller for staying the course and continuing to mine with them. :D 5 excavators or bust!
---
Highsec used to have a lot of corps and alliances. But as null sec became more lucrative all of the players either migrated or quit.

Noted, thanks. :P
---
Carriers are awesome and should never be nerfed!
---
Is there a place I could read up on complete eve lore? Things are getting hella interesting and I'm waaaaay behind... 
---
I am entertained.
---
Asset safety isn't going away. All the removal of asset safety does is require people who live in nullsec to engage in tedious asset tetris between NPC space and conquerable nullsec. If you think that the removal or even lessening of asset safety won't drive behavioral change, you are too stuck in your own mindset.
---
I mean, they’re risk averse nullbears in capital ships that are some of the most individually and collectively powerful combat ships in the game within the context of this comment chain...
---
I'm not sure this will have the effect you are hoping for. Corps that are guilty of structure spam usually have tons of resources, thus some decay mechanic won't really make much of a difference.
---
However, small corps who are trying hard to build, defend and fuel their structures and can't play 24/7 will be at a disadvantage - for them, a decay mechanic would reduce the incentive to build and maintain a structure.
---
I know plenty players who already think building a structure is too much of a hassle - with decay, yet another type of content is taken away from them.
---
I understand that the EVE community just wants to be elite and hardcore and slowly try to get rid of casual players, but idk if that's such a great idea long-term.
---
So... Because it's not gankable it's OP?
---
I too judge the content of a post before reading purely based on its author.
---
HELP
---
Thanks
---
There is one or two useful channels that are restricted to FC's anyway. The only channel of any worth that isn't restricted is the ping channel, but let's not pretend everyone doesn't already get BRAVE pings.
---
I wouldn’t give up.
---
Try again, see if you can find someone who can help you in that respect.
---
Create a text post here asking for that specific kind of advice. Start it with [Serious] or you’re going to get some industrial-level bullshit in the comments.
---
I didn't mean to imply that I think all you do is kill new players, I personally think you guys can field some really powerful fleets and I think you have some talented pilots. I think most people are more speaking against the mechanics of HS more than the people that use/abuse them (depending on how you view it), since it offers basically pure freedom from ever having to truly commit to anything. Nobody can threaten you because there's no conceivable way to hurt you or any other HS group that isn't spamming structures for no reason, and even with structures as long as you're not storing things in them (which why would you) they could kill your structures all day and while you're getting great content on end timers they're just burning out for nothing. 
---
But also look at the brawl you did have, you're dropping overblinged Vindis on T1 BS and losing. But it will never matter because again, nothing to punish. It's just shit HS mechanics and you guys use them well enough to make them glaring, so people will latch that negativity onto you I think.
---
There seems to be a hard limit on the tickets you can enter this more points means nothing. So subs end up with extra points they cannot use to enter the raffle. However all users have the same ability to enter the raffle

Yeah thats a pretty solid idea.
---
Maybe this is controversial, but if you aren't ready to fuel a structure, *you aren't ready to have a structure*. It's that simple. If you're going to be away, put some more fuel in there. Someone could still attack it, but the only way it's going low power is if you choose not to fuel it.
---
Gotcha 
---
Lololol. Querns_gsf telling someone they're too stuck in their own mindset. Jesus, that's funny!
---
Let's take a look at what wouldn't change. You cant dock titans or supers in Npc stations,  so those will stay in keepstars/pos. The only other option is to safelog, and good luck safelogging a titan fleet all at once and not getting some of them tackled/dreadbombed before they actually log. Lul
---
Industrialists are still going to want to min mac their profits, so they're still going to ve using the rigged citadels instead of npc stations. The biggest change for them would be keeping BPOs out in highsec/npc, which is a minor change. You just make copies and captor them in. Bpo research would take a hit, sure. Hey, higher risk, higher reward, right?
---
If the super fleet is logged in the keepstars you better believe people are gonna feel fine keeping capitals and subcaps there as well. I mean, if it goes down so does whatever portion of your capital assets are there, so the defense would be real. Content drivers, anyone?
---
If you have an alliance market, that might move. Again though, keepstars would need to stay up to store supers, so it's still relatively safe. As safe as your cap fleet at least. And an easy fix to being a giant vagina and huddling in Nov stations for everything would be to increase npc taxes in null systems to the point that it's not really feasible to run a.market out of a non citafel.
---
Yeah. Not much would actually change, other than it would give an actual reason to kill citadels in null, promoting conflict and generating more fights, which is always a good thing
---
Asset Safety was, and still is a mistake.
---
Good read. 
---
wib all teh lover coming fron the comunity i guess this is a good idea,
---
&gt;So... Because it's not gankable it's OP?
---
you do know how risk/reward works right?
---
People have been asking for this for probably 10 years, but then it applied to the old POS system.
---
We dont have it for the same reason CCP think their lastest balance patch will fix anything and the root cause should not be addressed. They are basically dumb.
---
Olmeca, big boi, no one care about what you think
---
Letting it repair seems an odd plan for killing it, but I defer to your expertise.
---
They are very resistant to fixing problems. That is all.
---
Yeah I get what you’re saying and I can agree that it is more desirable to have a physical thing you can attack. As I said earlier I wouldn’t mind it so much in highsec if we had mechanics that allowed for skillful gameplay to balance out the usual N+1 gameplay. Nullsec groups will use it on us to great effect and the stronger highsec groups will use it on the smaller ones. That’s why I like the idea of boosting.
---
That brawl was a ton of fun and we respect those guys a lot. The strategy they used on us was superior, and it rewarded them the ISK war. Their FC did give us credit in that we did force them to dockup 3 times despite us taking more expensive losses. Their specific fit was incredibly effective against what we brought and it was honestly our first time facing a scenario like that. We tend to fly real expensive, especially in our tank for when we do fight outmatched or outnumbered. Either way it was a great learning experience for all of us. We have a lot of new players that are used to wars but don’t have much combat experience like that.
---
That point of expense was brought up by a few members because it looks like we lost but of that had been over a structure timer, we’d have won the objective because of how many times we pushed them off. I know it seems like posturing but in the event of it being our WarHQ or a clients structure, the objective is more important to us. 
---
Uhhhh, he didn't suggest removing or lessening asset safety? 
---
Speed?
---
All I see is a Jump Freighter undocking from earth and then gtfo with all earths loot.
---
Welcome to Eve Online 2k19 - "The Expense"
---
This is why the FC should clearly tell the fleet to First select a new Target before it F1s . That way you don't hear a bunch of Noobs be all surprised the sibo did its job.
---
And that's why I responded to the comment, and not the post?
---
I blocked querns quite a while ago due to toxicity.
---
But notice that I am not asking for a removal of asset safety, or even a nerf. All my proposal would do is redirecting already-existing tax to the attacker instead of NPCs. 
---
If you check MER's its currently not a significant ISK sink either (if one wants to raise a counter-argument from it being an ISK-sink).
---
Yep good post have an upvote
---
&gt;I think the new balance changes that have been announced recently were overwhelmingly positive. 
---
Of course. The abusers didnt want fixes, so naturally they are happy.
---
&gt;I do agree that carriers needed tweaking, but I'd like to offer a counter-proposal to the currently announced changes to fighters.
---
You dont have to worry about that. The patch wont do much, if anything.
---
&gt;Fighters rightfully do not apply very well to ships moving quickly, nor should they.
---
They have currently no problems killing an ABing frig in seconds. If this incompetent nerf results in a +5 sec survival time for something that a cruiser would be unable to hit, are we good with that? Not really.
---
This pic was taken after EvE Amsterdam right?
---
Lol i was just recently rrmoved from legacy voltron discord. Damn that was like 8 or 9 months.
---
Guinea worms come out of your foot/leg, not your ass
---
CSM= USELESS
---
I'll frame it.
---
Yeah, clearly they are weak. Why should one of the biggest ships in the game instantly teleport to grid and potentially lose a fighter? Can you imagine the rage?
---
Are you a pve corp? I haven't seen an anchored bubble in ages, except for pve corps pretending that a crit hole and bubbles protects their dreads 
---
are you not able of going a day without writing a full thesis on why other people having nice things is bad cos they're not all elite like you?
---
Nice lol
---
&gt; brzzzt.....10111110001001111100111111....beep boop
---
You're trying to argue that HK was simultaneously complaining about the blob and trying to blob. It kinda feels like you're having your cake and eating it too, i.e. "yeah we blobbed but only because we had to, and by the way it's a BS narrative that we blobbed"
---
Have you ever used a keepstar before? They're huge. Safelogging a titan in tether range of a keepstar is pretty fuckin' dreadbombproof, absent connection issues or severe grey matter absence. That being said, I'm not sure you can allow tether and deny docking. I'm sure we could probably get that separated at the CSM level if it came to it though. Safelogging in tether range is extremely viable. It's a fuckload more viable than cramming titans into a POS, that's for damn sure.
---
It'd require you to entomb super pilots again, but conveniently there are these things called "skill injectors."
---
You want a reason to kill structures? How about this -- *engineering complexes and reactor-fit refineries drop loot on TQ today.* They have had partial asset safety since inception. To use an extreme example, hundreds of trillions of isk are cycled through just one of our reactor facilities every month. Tens of trillions of that are from one person. Anyone who pops that reactor gets mega loot. Granted, it's one of the hardest targets in the galaxy.
---
Subacps able to damage a behemoth like a titan is also shit game play, yet here we are. Always one of you "but Mah subcaps" guys around.
---
CCP's attempt at shaping the narrative is just ridiculous. The changes are an absolute joke. It doesnt even take effort to do what they did. Its basically a 10 min session. So trivial and so irrelevant.
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.
---
They didn't add faction missile tracking equipment over fears that even the t2 ones would be overpowered. I'm assuming they didn't want things like double rigor cruise phoenix/golems/etc oneshotting everything in sight.
---
I don't think it's necessarily the worst thing for different weapon systems to have uneven options for application mods and faction mods. 
---
You might say it's a vexer!
---
I can imagine ways to kill them (and have, in sub caps, without them being nerfed).
---
All thos sub wants is for sheer numbers to decide any ships fare. If you spent less time crying on reddit and more time flying in eve youd know carriers are nice and vulnerable just as they are.
---
Best Falcon thing so far.
---
There is a decay method. Is is known as ammunition. 
---
I prefer to face the issue head on instead of dancing around it like an idiot with an easily-exploitable workaround, such as the one in the OP. We all know what's desired by those sorts of changes. We also all know that such people have the foresight of my taint.
---
&gt;I would consider it a very powerful exploit and discourage you of using it and instead report it to CCP
---
In all honesty, if you are genuinely concerned this could be seen as an exploit you should have kept your mouth shut and gone straight to CCP so they could investigate it.
---
They are overpowered, broken, and massively oppressive to subcaps. Cyno should have a 5 min delay.
---
Disagreement isn't toxicity, and you aren't objective truth. In fact, you're quite myopic.
---
Blue salvage, go in wormholes, but at least bring a good battle cruiser even for the easiest sites
---
gon drone #138941 talking about foresight. if you had any you wouldnt be an inept nullbaby. 
---
Considering that we were the only group to prosper from contemporary game mechanics, this is a pretty funny thing to read. You do know what "foresight" means, right?
---
All these changes did was make everything I spent years skilling  into worthless since I don’t have a supercap umbrella. 
---
&gt; However, small corps who are trying hard to build, defend and fuel their structures and can't play 24/7 will be at a disadvantage
---
You don't need to 'play 24/7' to keep a structure fuelled. I think you can fit at least a month of fuel in a structure's fuel bay.
---
I am genuinely concerned and this is the reason for me to post here. Exploits that are posted publicly usually spread quickly allowing many people to react instead of keeping it secret while CCP fixes it and a few get to exploit it.
---
pvp wormhole corp.  we bubble to catch explorers and ratters who panic
---
I think the only thing this really breaks is maybe bring able to visually follow someone around the system, you still wouldn't be able to decloak or scan them down. It would only really be a powerful tool to feed love Intel to your alliance if someone was actively warping around system cloaked to check d-scan to attempt catching people. Idiots are still going to get caught and people paying half attention to d-scan or Intel will see the probes or movement and get out.
---
Where is the show at now? I’ve read all the books, is it worth watching it? 
---
02 was even better
---
foresight means to not to foster or support unbalancable n+1 mechanics in any way, shape or form, especially since they spiraled out of control post 2011. oh wait, you were running the sisters arc back then, right before latching onto the next best dependency teet. 
---
TL;DR: Don´t shit where you eat. 
---
huh?
---
You're confusing video game morality with foresight. Foresight is the ability to understand the game changes and take advantage of them for the benefit of yourself and your people. What you're describing is refried bullshit. Neither you or I are the world wildlife fund for video games.
---
I had to cut and paste this to read it
---
Thats how i lost 7 cloaked titans darn!!! 
---
Can i get a th:df please (too hard didn't find)
---
So basically if you've watched a cloaky ship to come into system via a gate, you can see it in space cloaked. Is this correct?
---
It has advantages for both the hunters and the game. Gonna be fun until it's removed lol.
---
Yeah we have to completely *break* the way the current game works for 90% of players especially in Null, but having 200 Booshing alts is totally cool and needs no balance. 
---
Get real for a minute, you just complain about everything that one-ups you or that you don’t personally align with. The problem here is that complete retards see your wall of text and blankly agree with it because “L33T stuff spodbrain you don’t get it.” 
---
TLDR for Olmeca: You and your play style are just as much of an issue as every single thing you listed, and I lost a lot of respect for you just now for not covering that. 
---
Well, I'm not familiar with the actual procedure of reporting exploits, but I said what I said out of concern that people will reproduce your steps to the detriment of others. I hope this swiftly gets the hammer if it is indeed declared an exploit.
---
Yes precisely.
---
So you're Australians and proud? 
---
when in rome
---
As far as the umbrella issue. I'm still a fan of allowing only one keepstar per region. True that doesn't stop a group from taking over a block of space around several region intersections, but does bring back strategic staging more. It also drags super projection away from low security null systems. It also will instigate keepstar fights.
---
Sigh, it is very very unlikely it would happen though. I still wish I could hear the reeee screams over it.
---
i know you aren´t. i certainly try not to shit into the sandboxes i play in too much while expecting that mommy cleans up my doodoo. but hey, this isn´t the first sandbox drowning in shit and it won´t be the last. 
---
&gt; but having 200 Booshing alts is totally cool and needs no balance.
---
My proposal actually fixes the OP'ness of booshing, as my industrial level of booshing directly relies on vertical farming and the fact that there are hundreds of Rorqs farming in a single region, which is precisely what I am arguing against.
---
&gt; Get real for a minute
---
Yeah, if we get real you just want to spew hate on me without properly engaging any of my points.
---
I like the auto aggression with drones, particularly if I have ecm drones out, one less thing for me worry about when I have to concentrate on being an F1 monkey :p
---
Cool. Never seen people anchor bubbles for any of those. Very weird. Get sabre alts like a normal person. 
---
Magnificient.
---
FIRST before you try to set any standings or undock any spaceships: get right with The Savior and make sure you get a valid mining permit and display it in you bio. I hope this helps! ^_^
---
&gt; I'm still a fan of allowing only one keepstar per region.
---
Imagine a mega alliance put a Keepstar per region, and deterred whoever attacking them. These kind of virtual limits almost never provide real solutions.
---
Sorry, but Eve Online's success or failure is at the hands of one group: CCP. We refuse to take responsibility for the game, especially when we aren't being paid to.
---
tengu is more versatile 
---
Tengu main, sabre alt ez. 
---
case in point 
---
Are you done? 
---
I never denied that we blobbed after they gave up. The thing is that it shouldnt matter what happens AFTER the fight is won.
---
Its just funny to me that they take the numbers from that keepstar mail (2days after they gave up) and put it on the deciding fight for hole control. It was always known that its gonna be that fight which will decide the outcome and the winning side will blobb the losing side because of it.
---
does that make sense? if not i give up...
---
well...it wouldnt be the first time CCP gave NPCs something we don't get.
---
like a mach with all 8 guns.
---
or a nightmare with a torpedo launcher 
---
or heck, a missile only ship with a random gun.
---
dont get me wrong, my money is on t2 Vedmak.   but it could also be NPC exclusive weapon set up again
---
I also do so and did not read
---
How does one farm a titan in 40 hours? Aside from cases where people are heavily multiboxing I don't see how somebody can average greater than 1b/h simply farming.. 
---
two accounts is too much to bother with tbh
---
Yeah ok then
---
This is quite interesting. Thanks for reproducing the bug. I've witnessed people experiencing it before.
---
If our clients know where the off-grid ships are in a system, I'm curious why there is no Eve "maphack" that shows them to the user. Perhaps there is but we don't know :)
---
youre late...
---
If you feed the hunters they will come back like stray cats looking for more kills.
---
&gt; Aside from cases where people are heavily multiboxing
---
There are lots of people heavily multiboxing now.
---
i'vw seen plenty of cloaky ships today on the gate, but when they cloaked they dissapeared, so..... nope fo me or my system
---
The hunters are the risk in the risk/reward equation for ratting supers. Or did you really think the anomalies were designed to be appropriate PVE risk for combat assets of that size?
---
Also, you missed my point - the risk averse players under discussion were capital pilots, not VNI pilots.
---
Lol, nice arbitrary mechanic. Nothing lives 5 minutes once tackled so you're essentially saying "no cynos" which makes you a faggot
---
https://youtu.be/khobE3rUods?t=37
---
The scene of the stratios blowing up is the same scene from the into the abyss trailer. Cept the vedmaks now have 2 turrets.
---
So they re-rendered this scene, with vedmaks with two guns or shopped a 2nd set of guns onto the original footage. Either way i don't think its accidental.
---
Thanks for your comment. I hope others will be able to reproduce this because otherwise that would mean that there is probably some way to break your client that makes the server send you coordinates for cloaked and offgrid ships... which in all honesty is even more disconcerting.
---
No, I understand your point. The real fight was over hole control - everything other than that was just killmails. Still, I think there was never any real chance for HK to get hole control. You guys invaded with significantly more numbers than they could fight. It's totally possible that there was a single fight they could have won, when your numbers were low and theirs high, but I think that is besides the point. 
---
Every WH eviction I've been a part of has played out the same way. It is very hard to win a hole control fight if you're seriously outnumbered, especially in high class wh space where you can't count on quick kspace routes. The defender has to get scanners into the new hole and scan a chain to kspace or their allies' chain, and their allies' have to burn from staging through the chain, all before the attackers put 3b mass through the wh. It's just not gonna happen unless you get very lucky - or you win the fight. 
---
I guess my point is that it seems that you are putting the victory on a single hole control fight when it seems pretty clear that victory was kind of assured once you started. But, I wasn't there, so maybe I'm wrong.
---
I fully expected this to be a troll and for there to be no actual Falcon in the whole image. 
---
I am so happy to have been wrong :)
---
Woe be the video game, for its doom hath come!
---
They sure react faster if ppl reeeee here, you did nothing wrong.
---
The intention is to stop unreasonable and undeserved instant teleporting. That delay accomplishes that goal.
---
The mechanic that allows players to be instantly protected by n+1 is not good for the game.
---
Once you're used to it a nid fit correctly with faction dda/t2 fsu/t2 fighters and decent skills should put out over 60m per tick before tax. This is before you factor in faction spawns/escalations/survey which give you a small bump from time to time. It's not hand over fist isk but it's pretty consistent all things considered as the only real limit in most groups is willingness to grind. You also get direct isk opposed to many other activities.
---
That was my point, you should not feed supers to hunters. The cost in hours to replace alone would make me want to dock up. It's also a really bad idea to whelp your meal ticket into hunters. The hunters will come back looking for either you or others later cus they know they can kill you, and you just lost your income source and need to replace it. 
---
A loss is still a loss even if you can afford to replace it.
---
You know the price for failure. On the skin, or the hose again.
---
except anyone with a skillfarm didnt let omega lapse
---
I'm guessing it will coming from the direction of more difficult abyssal sites. I would love  that ccp follow it with an announcement of t2 trigalvians... EveVegas#2019??
---
Only thing I disagree with is the impact of the rorqual nerf to tank and panic. The panic nerf is a direct nerf to the mega null empires (not nearly enough) the smaller guys never relied on panic to seek help, if their tank failed they were dead.
---
Yes the decrease in tank does lower the barrier of entry to killing the low sec rorquals but I feel this impact will be felt just as hard by the null entities. It is a lot easier to form 40 bombers to break the tank of the nerf rorqual than the 80 it required before.  It is harder to find lowsec rorquals and they are typically on somewhat defensible athanors.
---
We already have T2 triglavians, the zarmazd.
---
I tried being a game developer. My friend made a MOO, a text mmo. It was pretty good, very complicated. I came up with a cool idea for procedurally generated NPCs with hilarious collective nouns. At some point I became fascinated by markov chains, trying to make NPCs talk or whatever. And then I thought to myself wouldn't it be great to take the scripts from every single episode of Star Trek TOS, Star Trek TNG and also the lyrics from some 90s gangsta rap and feed it into the markov bot. So I created a room full of Star Trek NPCs who talked complete madness to each other constantly for 5 years and if any players pissed me off I would teleport them to that room and watch them go insane. Text MMOs are popular with blind people who, despite their disability, manage to be just as much of a jerk as you and me so maybe their TTS software made it worse.
---
I also created a bucket of shit that housed two NPCs who just constantly argued and shit talked each other. There were cameras in the rooms so we could watch them lose their minds on TV in game. We'd sometimes get drunk and accidentally leave super important admin things lying around in player space. I left my ship parked on some random planet while I was testing something, I'd created an AI core to defend itself against other jerk admins and a handsome drinks dispensing robot butler. It turned out like that episode of rick and morty where the car tries to keep summer safe, I came back some time later to a planet full of corpses and wreckage.
---
This was the 2nd best game I ever worked on.
---
I honestly dont understand why not everybody who regulary does PVE in null sec and also considers that fun or his/her main goal and activity joined Test or Imperium yet
---
