Sounds like some dude from one of Toddfa's old videos (specific quote was asking for triage carrier to X up, I can't find clip)
---
No, however, there is no way to implement what you are proposing. You seem to be wholly incapable of grasping just how flawed your proposal is.
---
Better yet, us the same 2FA for all of your accounts as was suggested, that solves your problem.
---
*Edit
---
You also failed to address my question in previous reply.
---
I did something similar once. Was hauling compressed Kernite around at a moment that was profitable and got bump locked back when that was a thing. Bumper Convos me asking for 125m to let me go. 
---
Me: Look, this load and ship are barely worth that to me. (A lie, but not a huge one, the Kernite load was worth about 600m in Jita if I remember right.) And if you had help coming I'd be dead by now anyway. So you let me go and I'll pay you 25m after.
---
Bumper kicks around for about 15m, trying to get me to up my price but I stand firm and insist on paying only after being let go. I was right, they had a little backup. So they cut me loose, I get to Jita, and likely to their surprise cut them a transfer for 25m. I want to encourage nice habits after all.

Scythe Fleet Issue can handle T2 sites fine, Stabber Fleet Issue is getting a big buff tomorrow, it's getting +20% DPS or so if you have Cruiser 5. So Minmatar ships are fine.

I like the fact that you've edited your comment days later. Please point out where I said you needed to kill yourself.

Much love UK. Keep being classy. Also, we're still coming for that Fort, fyi.

The majority of ships I fly can be trained into in less than a month.  I have a 90m sp character with nearly perfect frigate and destroyer skills.  That's higher than some capital pilots.  I highly recommend playing for at least a few weeks or a month on a character you created before you even think about spending money on more than a starter pack or omega subscription.  Play with your friends and figure out what they are lacking, then *maybe* consider buying a character or SP.   
---
The problem with buying a character or skill points when you're starting out is that you'll have no idea what you actually need.  Alliances change doctrines in reaction to balance patches, market forces, or their opponents.  You don't want to spend a bunch of money and then be retraining immediately.
---
the all drama around pittsburg and how some goons corp are right now leaving Goons would have been a good thing to bring up. I really really hope we are going to see a WWB2 here goons bleeding to death while their enemy are reinforcing themselves
---
Maybe they want a faction dread that's useful and kspace and won't die the second it sieges then.
---
I miss my TD Rifter so much.
---
The Fortizar in Avair is not Legacy backed. It is a few corps doing things until the new year.
---
I do want to point out that during the initial alpha it didn't seem like the game was suited or configured for lootboxes. Microtransactions in a free mobile game are a given nowadays, however if they don't go overboard the game could still be playable.
---
friendSHIP
---
But under your 5 dollar each plan, I would only be paying 20. That is where the issue arises. You are not thinking it through. There is no way that the math works out for this. Until you can ensure that CCP isn't losing revenue and players aren't being overcharged, you don't have a viable solution.
---
slower cycle time and cant jump out while spooling could be a thing
---
i blinged mine with crazy abyssals and officer mods before i quit. it was just my pet project. all my isk went into it. i love that ship.
---
and how so, both are multipliers
---
100%. As true as ever. The reality is that homes are so small, people either live with their parents (they will stop you from gaming and boss you around even if you are 30 with a good job) or in a mini studio without much room for a desk + PC. It's often an excuse to go outside and avoid family/wife or go out of this mini studio who makes you feel so confined.
---
Even financially speaking, It's much better to go to the PC bang with great set up (32'' monitors, GTX 2080, mechanical keyboard) and pay 1$/hour than invest in a computer either way, as such a setup would be north of 3000$ initial payment (and people don't really use credit card as much, you need to have the money to pay in full).
---

---
Well a chemosh could be good for that.
---
Hopefully but the BPC will be the real bottleneck
---
But this probably wonâ€™t cost 50b
---
That could be interesting. Instead of being imobile while sieged, imobile while spooling. Shorter cycle time but still committed to the grid for at least a period of time.
---
Sort even kicked one of his own alliances from the coalition to make way for the bots hence the name GOTB. I feel sorry for the init line member in all of this Imagine being blue to everyone around you and having to resort to defending Sort and his botting empire to try and get some kind of content.
---
I still love the Tengu for WH. Flexible enough with the new subsystem bay.  It runs sites and combat just fine (based on your sp, naturally). Explores great. Travels great. EvE Workbench has some WH and Exploring fits I'm sure. 
---
I'm not trained into the others, so I dont know how it compares.
---
And yet proceed to drop supers and dreads. I should be smoking what you snork
---
They sure can afford supers and dreads... and there is no longer such a thing as a newby corp in EVE#2019
---
I fly it and its terrible, even the ambit/TC fit

If you have more ehp than his clip dmg you win, simple as that

just drop supers
---
Yeah Drami is/was my fucking space taxi.
---
How the hell can these people think that breaking people's toys is a good idea?
---
A game is a toy, in this case made of a bunch of little toys.
---
I'd say 1.5k euro if you want it immediately (I haven't checked but it's probably easier/cheaper to buy a character with skills already). I'd recommend that you try to have patience and start with trying to find a group you like playing with and skill towards ewar (since it's fun and you'll feel less useless in that role with lower skills) and then slowly move towards what you feel like. If you end up wanting something faster along the way get some skill injectors and skill into it. Personally I had double the amount of SP of what a 1 year old character would have after a year but if you speed it up like I did you'll often find that you have skills you never use and that you could've spent that money better.
---
If you want to spend money to get ahead I'd instead recommend spending it on more omega accounts because you will come to a point where you'll want more characters focused on different things.
---
Still better than hml or ham 9/10
---
i feel intaki are the closest to the dudeist state of mind, "path of least resistance", "going with the flow", "the intaki abides" etc.

HQ Incursions are definitely not the worst. I've had 120-150-200m/h with WarpToMe

... I wouldn't be so sure of that &gt;.&gt;

You got me

They can use it I don't mind
---
Tried to focus on the post but all I do is stare at the  crooked line spacing.
---
Do not do Abyssal sites as a means of stable income. You can break even when doing lvl4/5 sites, but the investment and skill required just makes other content far more profitable and accessible.
---
honestly, i don't see a way how they could make it worse;) ye i hope for it to change. But it seems extremely hard to do to me

I'll inquire about this!
---
Nice blue
---
Which brings us to another issue, core skills and the attribute remaps. Atm you have core skills on int-mem but the ship skills are perc-will. This in itself causes issues for newer players since they have a disadvantage when lacking them. Meaning you are stuck between 2 remaps and you wait out the training of core skills before doing the fun stuff in Eve. I have heard this from many newer players as a big reason why they stopped playing. And it makes sense.
---
I want the removal of them and higher SP with boosters. Boosters will more or less be the best LP option which is why I assume its gonna be higher. 
---
Like, the removal of these things wont hurt anyone. Thats the point, no one is gonna get sad over it. But it will remove the downsides of having it in place. Never worrying about training implants isnt a bad thing, being punished for not undocking shouldnt be a thing.
---
You still appear on grid, but are not targetable.
---
I've heard of this before so I gave it a try and.... this guy just ONE SHOT ME!!  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/79869009/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/79869009/)
---
Mob tagging here I come.
---
Lmao the fit, both guidance and tracking Disrupt
---
ahhh, well, then yes. although, "mining" stays the same, just the income changes in comparison to the time before.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Although, OP would probably say this is already breaking his game XD
---
Did you know that you can move assembled ships without contracting in a DST Fleet Hangar?
---
1bil+ in loot is not enough for ya?
---
I think the industry sounds nice. I saw you could build bases on planets and such to manufacture goods and sell. Seemed like a nice strategy / crafting kind of thing to do that would fit in with a few hours of playtime that I get.
---
The combat I thought looked a bit bland. I've been playing Elite Dangerous quite a bit as I love flight simulators and it lets me be "in" the ship which EVE doesn't, but at the same time Elite has no real crafting or industry aspects to the game (besides blowing up rocks), and I like being able to build something then transport and / or sell it.
---
Guess I need to do some more research before I jump into the game. Exploration also sounds like fun. I'm the kind of person who loves finding something exciting more so than the actual value of whatever the thing is. Just finding something rare or exotic is exciting. Might look up exploration too then. Is exploration something you can actual make some coin from though or is it just a "left handed" minigame of sorts that you'd only do every once in a while ?
---
A lot of the loot is still in salvage. I don't think you will get suspect status from salvaging. Whats interesting though are those lines:
---
&gt; The explosion of the dreadnought's drive core has caused gravimetric intereference in the local field. Warp drives are inoperable within the vicinity of the wreck. 
---
Looks like you need to get some distance until you can escape with your ninja loot.
---
But my cold and harsh? /s
---
People have been yelling at CCP about how broken Astrahus farming is since 2016.
---
50m is extraordinarily too much for a start, think between 15m-20m with cheap t1 modules, you want to lose as many as you can for learning pvp.
---
Re lock
---
I'm sorry?
---
slow day at work, really - you seem to be more involved with your lengthy replies
---
&gt;No work required - just click warp and wait for safety in your freighter, even if people work hard to keep you on site.
---
CCP balance went bad places also here.
---
Are you talking about bumping?
---
All I'm seeing is a growing list of reasons why I cannot support this game anymore.
---
Yea, I have this problem. I can actually type really fast and not have shit grammar. It's a hopeless flaw.
---
Also, slow day at work.
---
If the triglavians are dropping loot, does that mean imperial forces are going to drop loot?
---
Faction mods, perhaps?
---
You can do a lot in game as an alpha/free in my opinion. In the old days the only option other than buying a sub 1 month at a time was a 28 day trial.
---
https://i.imgur.com/Z5TGkDP.png the final setup, some systems will have 2 safe folders but maybe i sort them by system ones i get use to the new system
---
I like my 5.0, so I've never tried it  but does that happen when we pop the Imperial gate guards?
---
Basically unplayable
---
Was a decision taken by our UI/UX people to bring Locations in line with all the other options in that menu, and to keep the top menu level clean.
---
But all of those except for the warp-off timer are easy to work around. You can warp a freighter in like 2 seconds if you fit it right and have a Hyena within 50km of it. It's literally how I used to get my JF to Jita when I did courier services. My warp time was like 2.15s or something in a JF that had an align time of &gt;30s. You're not going to stop them from being able to loot and warp away, which means the only way to stop it is to HIC anything near the wreck.

Cladari &gt;&gt;&gt; Gallente &gt; Minmatar &gt;&gt; Amarr

Functionally identical, and this ship gets remote repair bonuses.

nothing says usability like.. uhh *reads notes* reducing usability

Vs Thad Tengu

And you run the risk of accidentally triangling your rep target

All minmatar ships need a rework. They ugly af.
---
This my favorite thread ever. Love all my Heron bros.
---
Minmatar - I can always find innovative uses for duct tape
---
[removed]
---
they had a 50% bonus because everyone else was slow AF. now that Warp Speeds got properly scaled it makes sense to reduce such an absurd benefit, moreso when there's also a buff to their weapon of choice (and projectile weapons are already powerfull when using Angel ships). seems a valid trade off
---
It could be semi-useful in wormhole brawls to recieve remote cap, where you might get neuted out before hitting full damage - but spooling out of siege will leave you super vulnerable to to getting jammed since you don't get the ewar immunity.
---
We are bad just to see of you give tears. If you show you're cool about it we'll kill still kill you but we'll probably recruit you afterword
---
It'll be worth it for the sore loser post death mails they send you.

Imagine how that Meta would evolve. Triglavian Titans as Logi and Main DPS in Titan Blobs.

No! Loki ugly! Loki get scramed and double tracking disrupted by overlord heron!

Put it back in your pants. No one wants to see that shit.

Didn't think I could get any harder. Was proved wrong

Well, until you have fleets of just Trig titans.. you pretty much know who is getting Alpha'd first.
---
Eve has been dying since 2003 so just ignore that
---
Perhaps this is the way to counter faxes...
---
i cheated a bit and added the standard cerebral accelerator that gives an extra rof for &lt;30 day old toon.
---
So you could technicallt have that silly dps if you inject a toon
---
Meh, a lot of what youre saying is pretty disingenuous. 
---
There are no good viable solutions, viable being the key word, in your list. There are many problems with those solutions, too many to list out for each one.
---
I cant say Ive ninja salvaged or been ninja salvaged, but I imagine it's about as hard as poping on grid with an mtu or something.
---
Is it a broken mechanic in its' current state, yes.
---
Are you dumb for dying to something that is preventable, also yes. 
---
It's a non-issue because not dying to a gank is easier than ganking.
---
800%, at least for regular guns.
---
Does this mean I can reinforce 11 Ass-Houses at once ?
---
Asking for a friend ...
---
AFK highsec mining for 10 years straight.
---
&gt;If i download thisbgame on steam do i have to register/make EVE account
---
It automatically creates an Eve Account named STEAM:&lt;numbers&gt;. Best to create your Account directly on the Eve Website.
---
&gt;2.Is this gane still worth playing i heard that theres a commong joke that EVE is dead!,
---
As with every MMO, it gets called dead. Sure, it's prime time seems to have passed, but CCP is trying to shake things up to give it an upward boost. Maybe it'll work, maybe not. But i think it still has enough steam to make it worth your time.
---
That's roughly 40b isk worth of injectors...
---
updated 2: C5 mag goes up to 147k dps
---
Ummmmmmm... this thing has HAW level dps without ever sieging.
---
&gt; ~~Basically~~ Literally unplayable
---
ftfy
---
Open folder in separate window, problem solved.
---
But the first question and is this game still worth starting in 2019!,
---
You have missed Epsilon implant
---
Is this a joke? You do realize how many of those dreads you would need to spider tank anything? They get no bonuses to remote rep amount or duration, only range bonus and it's half of what FAXes have...
---
Yes!
---
Thank you i guess ill download this and atleast give it a try!,
---
Ya.. I dont know what your saying...
---
&gt; keep the highsec retards happy
---
i don't even
---
Sorry mate, im just REALLY bored. o7
---
I remember someone from CCP on some keynote this year told a story how are they going to decrease the number of clicks
---
What does it do with an actually reasonable fit that people are likely to use?
---
I don't have the probe scan window pinned. It's only been a minor problem when they disabled the agency blink for new sig spawns.
---
Welp, I didn't know pinning a bookmarks window is so unpopular. Guess I learned something today.
---
Plot twist: it fires a doomsday that is constant and spools upwards.
---
Preemptive fire. If based on experience you know what a probable avenue of attack is OR if you know based on recon or intel, you engage the enemy BEFORE the "A" of the attack.
---
I'm bad and I feel bad!
---
Imagine removing stargates from the Overview and putting them as deeply nested as this. That should give you an idea of how important easy access to bookmarks are for some of your players.   
---
An option to revert back to the old right click menu would be good.   
---
The option to customise your right click menu so the player can decide what to nest where and when would be ideal, but I am not holding my breath.   
---
Sadly they don't make keyboards with enough keys for all the hotkeys supported by EVE and they do not make monitors large enough to just keep People and Places open. So please, a fix would be appreciated, and preferably this year(yesterday if you could).
---
50k dps 
---
But ccp fucked up and those are apparently not the final stats, dps &amp; tracking will be lowered
---
What's the isk/hour like doing that?
---
&gt;Functionally identical
---
Not really, check out bonuses between two modules, completely different.
---
Siege does not give any remote rep bonuses. Unbonused capital rep is around 50 hp/sec (large rep is better - 80 hp sec due to cycle time)
---
Go toast their sov and tell me how fast your diplos tell you to stop
---
It's messy and inferior to the normal right click -&gt; wh -&gt; c5a
---
Great: Now I can see bookmarks instantly instead of waiting 2min for them to show up!
---
Bad: Still have to wait 2min to be able to warp to the bookmark -.-
---
Wormholer btw sad :(
---
It's just extra steps to do the same thing.
---
Not using folders would mean that temp bookmarks for the current system would be accessible directly from the right click. This is why you don't understand the problem: you had brought this suffering upon yourself earlier and gotten used to it already.
---
It was announced. Not in the patch notes. Those are completely different thing. Expect details when it goes live tomorrow at dt.
---
That worked, thanks!
---
This pretty much. I've been decloaked while performing the trick only once, several years ago (2014 maybe?). It's hard to do.
---
&gt;The rest of the UI is ridiculously tedious to use, for consistency we've brought bookmarks up to speed and made sure they are equally as tedious to use.
---
That's what I thought. I like it, though. Heightens the irony of your post.
---
&gt;It doesnt make sense since you dont need high sec status to gank, the faction police are not a problem for gankers, they do little damage and dont point.
---
It makes sense because you cannot sit on say jita undock, and you WOULD need decent sec status to get into highsec. You are assuming, despite changes being on the table, that everything would remain the same. That makes no sense.
---
&gt;No. Removing low sec status gankers from HS is not a valid solution, this skews it too far in favor the opposite direction.
---
That is your strongest argument against it? Ridiculous. It solves the problem, so it may not be perfect, but it is viable. Do you want to solve the problem?
---
&gt;I see where youre going with this, I was assuming all these things listed were separate ideas to implement rather than a single idea combined. 
---
They can be what you want really. They can be tweaked or whatever. The intent is what matters. Right now, you have known gankers sitting on jita undock and no one can do anything because the mechanics are broken.
---
&gt;That is not a valid solution and will just kill ganking all together. 
---
So you were just projecting the "not meeting minimum effort".
---
What it would do is to ensure you cannot consistently do it without consequences, but the fact that you assume it would kill it, when it doesn't, means you just want it to remain as is and therefore nothing is "viable".
---
&gt;The goal was to get gankers to put equal risk on field, not commit mass genocide of an entire playstyle.
---
It's not a playstyle. It's basically exploitation of obsolete mechanics that have been "figured out" and circumvented. The goal should be to cut back on it while not removing it completely by imposing real consequences. What is there to show that this would not be the way to go?
---
Classic VOLTA.
---
I think they mean random natural changes in the resources available. He went on to say:
---
"As I tend to say, â€˜if you have stagnant inputs, youâ€™re going to have stagnant outputsâ€™. We are now rolling what we kicked off over the Summer into more of the structured chaos, where we are going to be shifting around some of the major inputs that have to do with mineral distribution and also some other resources that go into the economy which have been too predictable and stagnant for too long that have lead to stagnation in the economy and stagnation in the political system"
---
You are right, the Eve UI is extremely intuitive and very easy to use.
---
/s - incase you are actually as thick as this post implies
---
I feel like they change shit like this because they have nothing else to fuck with. If it isn't broken don't fuck with it.
---
I've considered that too, but opted to keep it in one monitor so that I can dualbox without alt-tabbing.
---
If it isn't broken, don't fuck with it.
---
What if I told you you could create folders on the same level as your character name, move all the bookmarks to those folders, and remove 1 layer of nesting.
---
Whatever helps you feel special amigo. Have a good day.
---
Thanks that cleared it up
---
You haven't given me anything to change my mind. You haven't given me an example of how streaming requires anything beyond playing a videogame and running a chat.
---
I also have the People and Places window, fleet window, Logs&amp;messeges window, cargo, watch list window, probably others that I'm forgetting right now. Although I have a second monitor just for windows.
---
technically it wouldn't have 1-shot it
---
&gt; tEChNicALlY
---
I am a dated player so what your saying is i should try for something with more projection. Could you suggest some ships like this?
---
Unbelievable.
---
Well, I am using it today and it's not that good, you cant use other binds and modifiers and etc.
---
trigs drop the dread bpc. the empire destroys a trig dread and u need to salvage it for the parts to make the dread.
---
Did you do it in game? I didnâ€™t get a chance to.
---
Black out in conjunction with permanently cloaked ships and cynos is a game breaking thing and in that iteration it was garbage.
---
They are exactly that, mixed with a bit of Orks from 40k. (Guns are either full of Dakka or just plain MASSIVE, their ships look like flying scrapyards, their ships tend to go faster than other races)
---
No clue on tengu, but ive run them in a cheap naga fit (T1 weapons and mostly T2 otherwise) somewhere around 80mil. ~15min per site + 5 min looting
---
Prices of filaments have risen and loot has fallen, its about 400 mil/hr now
---
&gt;a good majority
---
Sorry what? More than half eve players only play on one account? Where is this information?
---
Only on days that end in 'y'
---
Maybe let us have bookmarks show in the overview?  Any nested right click menus get tedious when you're just trying to GTFO of a bad situation.
---
I said "Why can't see do that to NC.?"
---
I am not sure that repeating will help if you were unclear on it the first time around. Sorry my man.
---
Lier
---
Caracals typically have an engagement range of 50 - 70km so your canes will just get zapped while applying &lt;100 dps

Missspellar

Sliepnir is hood 80km kiter guy that lives in amamake area flies at ship too flies kiting sliepnirs
---
I have a folder for every region. Is this going to suck?
---
This will result in alot of blown up ships me thinks.
---
"I suspect CCP will take another pass at this interface and make us all as happy as clams."
---
Are you seriously expecting CCP to actually Iterate and improve a new feature Hahahahahahaha
---
Dont hold your breath
---
That's what I thought, I was confused when people were saying you do
---
They should! I did the Eve Forum one, lots people for real nice stuff... I got some guys hanger trash ðŸ˜•
---
wouldnt that be fun tho, a ship that makes capitals obsolete that cannot hit subcaps.
---
Iâ€™m just surprised CCP still has people that talk to us
---
It's really more like 1.5b with implants. [This](https://zkillboard.com/related/32000025/201905281200/) is where I was at the last time I was running them. But I added Navigation 3% &amp; Neurotoxin Recovery 3% to the pod. I always run with standard drop active and a cheap speed drug.
---
That was my absolute cheapest fit after a lot of T5's and cutting numbers because I made up for it with experience. I died there because of a disconnect, but otherwise I have 500+ successful runs with this ship.

You can't allow the user options to pick how they want their user experience to be!!!  That's some kind of madness!

Regarding complexity, I think we disagree about what "punish" means. I would say that EVE is a hard game, and that its complexity (as well as its breadth) are the two main drivers of its "hard"ness. But "hard" and "punishing" are different ideas in my mind. And I value the hard-ness of EVE. It gives me challenges to figure out, and makes the goals I set out to achieve more meaningful.

Regarding your second point, I have to disagree. For comparison, everyone needs to be able to fly a travel-ceptor. But I don't think either of us is arguing that frigate V and the interceptors skill should be in a new pilot's starting skills, nor that these skills should go away. What's different with the magic 14? (I'll further note that, for a newbie, I don't think that they actually need all of the magic 14. For example, it includes both armor and shield tanking skills, and a newbie could quite reasonably choose to specialize in one type of tank for quite some time.)
