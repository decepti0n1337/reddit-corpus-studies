Because to most nullbears, they are not "relevent"
---
---
---
No. 
---

---
No Holes Barred had this plan that only really works with small numbers of dreads. We had what was, at the time, the largest dread fleet ever seen in wormhole space. NoHO had this plan to use a ton of bhaalghorns, this was when geddons were laserboats, to instaneut out a dread or carrier. 
---
So they had probably 11 bhaalgorns with probably 20 bhaalgorns in carriers. 
---
But these were the days before dreads used subcap guns. These were dreads with capital guns dual tracking boosted and sensor boosted. We were locking bhaalgorns up and doing 10k a shot to them. We killed their entire bhaal fleet in 1 minute. 
---
After the bhaalgorns were dead, the FC called dread primaries, then carrier primaries, then stopped calling subcap primaries. We were told to sort by type. "Ok lokis web tengus and dreads blap em."
---
Battle was over very soon. 
---
The question mark probably confused you. Its meant more as wtf are you talking about. Because IM stating that they are bigger than us.
---
And we arnt really bullies. But whatever helps you sleep. Keep venting it is good for you, just maybe learn what the fuck your talking about first so you dont look stupid would be my advice
---
Goodluck
---
Eve Classic when?
---
After a loss he still can't admit that he underestimated Horde.For a second he does but after that "not that, they just guessed what we were planning" 
---
Oh no baby what is you doing?
---
Being sarcastic. I'm sure you've heard of Hard Knocks, but I don't like using that flair. More fun to use Simpler Farmers. 
---
If you missed it. A Goon C2 is being evicted and they're SDing ships.
---
I, for one, am DISGUSTED that they aren't fighting back against the eviction team!!!
---
(I'm being sarcastic)
---
I just shed a tear
---
Sure, if you want to take them out of the equation, there was even less legacy members fighting than PL and pets.
---
Thank you!!!!
---
Now tells us who it was :)
---
Left already iirc
---
the bots are gonna come and inflate eeeeeve

Welcome to the latest Brisk wants attention post. Please updoot so he feels good. No shit posting Goons or he will find you in game.

my god you're so questionable

Yikes.

(Im 9 hours into a 12 hour server upgrade. My senses are dulled.)
---
I think i'm gonna make one for VNI ratting, now that my char has the skills for it

Better than the Hel that died because he has his LO in the fuel bay and couldn't light cyno.

Can you take archie back please?

Don't worry, I did the same thing with my Molok when we dunked the Brave Hels. Was able to wait out a weapon timer and refit to a different DD to still squeeze one off.

JC Denton

The JC stands for "Jesus Christ Denton."
---
The dino screech is real. 
---
I'd ask where horde touched you but we already have video evidence.
---
this is the most intelligent reply here, and shows why covops ships are so weak atm
---
it's so much easier to kill a few drones worth billion than a single rorq
---
I trough the most value in a rorq was the drones you can bomb ?
---
I'm not saying he is a bad dude or FC. What I AM saying is that was terribly confusing with him constantly talking over the dudes he delegated to call targets. 
---
no, the only reason why WOW is emulated at all is because the server  source/code WAS leaked and fairly regularly too, all you need to do nowadays is compile it and run it*    
---
*according to my pal who has ran his own wow servers in the past, for him its a afternoon job to get one running "from scratch" , meanwhile EVE would take you YEARS of reverse Engineering, prodding the horrid Python/C++/C#  w/ a very long stick for weeks at a time to find out what does what and how to feed it what it wants from a server 
---
"muh goons how dare you say your leadership is active and giving you directive to be wealthy must downvote you grrr goons"
---
You can solo a Drifter with a cap gun Dread in a bit under a cycle. You need double heavy points to stop it warping off at 25% armour and a web to make sure you can actually hit it (it's got a big sig but it orbits quite fast). 
---
The thing is, if you warp a dread into site \_at all\_ before the site despawns it spawns a wave of Avengers (3 for a C5, 4 for a C6). This repeats for carriers separately, too, so avoid that.
---
Best bet is to spawn the drifter with your subs while aligned and warp to next site before it tackles you - it'll just float around the system til you kill it after that.
---
You can pull those drones though, which instantly takes them off field even if they are bubbled and pointed. You can't do that in barges.
---
supercarrier make as much money as 3 T2 rorqual if I'm correct, but the point of rorqual is you can spam them, you are not really limited while super, max 2 then you run out of APM (Action Per Minute)
---
I think they're interpreting it as some sort of disavowal of rorquals or something, instead of being sane and realizing that there was a period of about six months where there were no rorquals, and that we were already transitioning towards a mining-based economy without even knowing that rorquals were on the horizon.
---
Eh..a bunch of us have been in horde for years. The unlimited content and the ability to help new players is a potent retention incentive
---
The funny part is, we were actually done. We were legit about to derp our fleet into the enemy fleet in a blaze of glory when all of a sudden. "Check check check sleeper social club just rolled into your hole."
---
FC shut down any comments immediately got scouts on the hole and we got the subcap reinforcements. We had like 19 dreads 8-10 carriers and like 20-30 subs. SSC brought like 20 more subs which allowed us to take hole controls. 
---
As the enemy fleet warped in, our reinforcements were landing on our static. So it was almost like a hollywood moment. 
---
Irony
---
Afraid I can't share that info
---
Lots of people do. Hell, I was *frequently* having ships land on me when I was a week old trying to go mining in my first venture. I never got ganked in one, but boy oh boy did it make me paranoid.
---
(Took me over a year later to realize that mining in a system on a direct route between dodixie&lt;-&gt;jita wasn't my brightest idea.)
---
Just look at zkillboard for ventures sometime, and you'll see the same gankers pop up over and over. I guess it's their kind of fun?
---
ive heard from someone who looked into CCP's gamecode a few years back  that its only hardware intensive bc of its messy code, for example it would make hundreds of unnecessary calls to the server database for actions wich dont need it to function (could be a botched anti tamper system or just "it just works i guess" code, but it adds  alot of server strain), if the code where to be streamlined you could double or even triple current player-counts w/o having to upscale the servers, and you could even remove alot of tidi if done right (1000 player combat grids w/o it shitting itself)   
---
also drone AI is a fucking mess, way worse than what CCP says about the good old P.O.S. code 
---
He kept jumping in more dreads???
---
&gt;Feels like it. Even a total retard is 100% safe in delve if they fit a cyno.
---
this amuses me. survived 2 bomberbar hotdrops in delve so far, couldn't kill the inhib with my rorq (they repped it), still survived though, thankfully the super standing fleet had eyes and a cyno structure in system.
---
a solo rorq cant really kill a inhib. yes, a super can, but they're fucking supers. 
---
there's also tons of booshers moving around, you've got 1-2 cloak campers in most areas that like to throw bombs at excavators, as well as hotdropping in fleets to fuck with rorqs. 
---
yes, delve is safe enough to mine with a rorq, but it's not "safe", especially not 100%. your post smacks of a salty non miner who doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about. fly safe :)
---
The days i regretted so many accounts  :(
---
FIXED!!!??? They have been unfixing the game since 2009.....It has been a decade of bad decisions stacked on bad decisions. There is so much wrong with EVE at this point that it seems CCP is just planning that last big cash out before closing the game down. All the incentives to buy plex and skill extractors just scream last minute cash grab to me, not to mention that skill injecting is completely breaking the game on its own. Add to that the fact that CCP is almost completely ignoring bots.
---
If you ask me or any of my friends that used to play eve, there hasn't been much to be happy about for a long time. 
---
Holy cow. Those coms were so calm and composed. Not any of that PGL rage yelling.  
---
I just used World of Warcraft as an example, but I know that the most popular server cores (TrinityCore and MaNGOS), which probably &gt;90% of private servers either run directly or run forks of, was written from scratch.
---
I haven't been active in that community since 2009 or something, but until then I have never heard about leaked source code being used in those projects. In fact, I'm pretty sure Blizzard could legally take down their Github repositories if they used their code.
---
Maybe you misunderstood what your friend said, because it is easily an "afternoon job" to install one of those servers. You don't even have to compile them nowadays, they have working releases that you can just run.
---
Just try it
---
Very Cool
---
Gene Starwind with a Wing Zero alt?
---
I see you are a man of culture as well...
---
Eh speak for yourself, conman is still a twat and kelmac is still a crybaby bitch in my book.
---
Most of it, theres absolutely no need to use bots to mine. A single player can easily run many rorquals semi afk without input broadcasting, much less botting.
---
Why no droneskis though 
---
Maybe not build one - day 1 me sure wouldn't have been able to *find* the ore I needed - but I've done the math before and with a noob fit venture with tech 1 meta fittings, IIRC mining plain veldspar if that noob can get the ore compressed and move it to Jita, they can replace the venture and fit with two or three uncompressed ore holds.
---
Which means the noob could even compress the 3 loads of ore, stuff it back into the venture's hold, and fly that silly thing to Jita.
---
I wish I'd figured *that* out when I was new, could have made a bunch more isk.
---
its still not that bad if you harvest the top 2 gasses
---
interesting, i was fairly sure it was based on some db leak 
---
either way, very impressive that you dont even need to compile it anymore
---
INIT. is far more relevant than 90% of any other eve formations. 
---
I'd take archie back in a heartbeat, but it wouldn't be the same without having his prepubescent voice screaming about "gotta go fast"
---

Russian wh circle will never be whole. Because russians.

lol
---
Honestly, I don't see the problem with this. Like, yeah, pvp is obviously more exciting and is rightly used for the marketing most of the time, but it's actually extremely cool that all the combat ships/citadels/etc in eve were built by players and sold via a fully realized player economy. It's definitely a selling point.
---
Strange that it doesn't show on yours.  I used a structure to murder a fellow earlier today and the character manning the guns was given final blow, and labeled as an astrahus.
---
Very curious as it had never happened this way before.
---
i want CCP to do this, not only to see what old eve looked like, but also to preserve it for the future, as EVERY MMO is destined to die after they shut the servers down, and every patch makes us forget the old version as we loose features we had in the past 
---
https://zkillboard.com/related/30002435/201901161000/

this is what happens in gem :)
---
If you don't like blob fleets then you probably want to join a LS or wormhole group. Not a lot happens in HS from a PVP perspective. Doing DED sites and the higher end combat sites is a fairly safe and moderately interesting thing to do there, or you can daytrip wormholes easily.
---
So basically PL alts are resetting PL alts?
---
~No Reply~
---
Who the fuck is this guy?
---
To be honest, I think there would be a lot less "content." Think about how many rorquals being tackled have lead to a response fleet getting slaughtered. As much as I hate this current meta, I think rorquals are one of the only true reasons for content generation. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I do not foresee groups risking carriers or dreads to save some mining barges. They would let them die and wait for the roaming group to move on.
---
Unfortunately, in this age of citadels and pre-aligned ratting capitals, rorquals are one of the few forms of content generation left. Without them, I do not foresee those groups having any real reason to counter us or cap blob.
---
Top fucking tier post.
---
See 50 bombers land and inhib dropped? Light cyno instantly. Don't be a bad. 
---
And you're right, I'm not a miner. I prefer to kill them. I know what I'm talking about because I know how they live. 
---
Inhib is dropped, light cyno. Very difficult process. I dunno how miners manage to do it. 
---
Legitimate question; How frequently are FCs this loud and obnoxious? Having only been in Horde, I've (luckily) only experienced calm FCs. ASP can get a little hyped at times, but nowhere near the magnitude of this in any way..
---
I mean I get it. He's been trying to get this fight for 2 months. He gets his chance. Ofc he's hyped, but keeping your cool is so important, does TEST really not have any other skilled FCs?
---
Is it common for FCs to be this screeching? Or is PGL a one off?
---
Im gonna be the one that saves isk

What's the rainbow arc on the Universe map near Providence for?

This post probably looked funnier in your head than in practice.

Not really, it's just a bunch of nullsec paste eaters repeating the blatantly untrue memes they heard from other drooling nullbears and getting corrected by people with more than a single brain-wrinkle.
---
Actually would have believed it if I didn't read the last sentence...
---
Why are you even here then? Move on and find something else to complain about.
---
mhmm mhmm
---
Stop stop I already came 
---
tl;dr
---
Someone needs attention 
---
Ayuuup. Lotsa people have opinions, and one thing I've noticed is they're always convinced everyone else is wrong.
---
Pvp's nuts. Pve's a waste of time. Mining you just sit there on a rock. Marketer's 0.01 isk all day in a dock.
---
And then you have people like me, where I take someone else's stuff and get paid to move it in a flimsy tin can - assuming someone doesn't take advantage of the kick me sign taped on my back, in which case I have to pay for the item I was hauling instead, along with losing my ship.
---
Yet, I love hauling, and rub into people who do all of these other activities constantly and routinely need stuff moved. Don't worry, they frequently let me know I'm crazy. I think they're just as crazy too.
---
our standing fleet wants us to light the cyno when they call it out. i kept telling them on comms "inhib coming up, want cyno?" and they said no. then when they finally told me to light cyno, i was inhib'd. then got called a baddie. it was kinda annoying tbh. yeah definitely lighting the cyno first thing next time. 
---
So you didn't light your cyno until the inhib was already online? And then you had to be rescued by someone else?
---
Are you aware that you are the "total retard" u/Another_eve_account was referring to?
---
Sappo I love you
---
use Code instead, that salt always flood with our flair
---
ask Olmeca how much afk rorq miner are doing AFK mining...

But I am coming back, just after buying some cigs.

whomp whooooomp

Because I love what Eve could be and used to be. It's sad to see something that you truly enjoy and care about get run in to the ground by corporate greed. 
---
Not that common.  
---
Someone needs to stop sd'ing and give a gudfight!
---
That's a pretty big difference with the Horde FC comms in that other video.
---
rofl. rescued from a 50+ group of bombers bar? yes? and was told specifically not to light the cyno? yes? 
---
are you aware your reading comprehension is shit?
---
Brave loves my flair 
---

Is it Brisc?

---
Faneto over both 
---
I mean, people are stupid. Miners, supers, titans, hunters, whatever. rely on your own judgement for things like that.
---
If inhib is about to line, just blaze it unless you have cyno ceptors in system. 
---
Everyone knows ReloadThis is the next HK.
---
I mean, if after 2 years of rorqual meta you see TEST getting into it, PH barely going into it, the problem is not the meta but your own leadership, yes The Imperium leadership decide to tell to their member to do PVE, yes it was a good propaganda for a few month "lol goonswarm are only PVE carebear". But when you realize they are making tril every month, instead of saying "lol everything go to jita or RMT" tell to your member "ok, something is broken in eve and we need to adapt right now". And the same shit can be apply to "Grrr goons, they are the blob", was funny to blob goons during WWB, was funny to blob goons during X47, but when you get rekt because your leadership/titan pilot are coward "muuuuh the blob is not funny". Is it why ~~god~~ Mittani call Panfam hypocrite ?
---
Are you aware that you didn't put "i was told not to light the cyno!!" in your post, big boy?
---
Hey dreads make sure u follow dread primaries called by someone else
---
Don't mind me, I'm just going to scream over everyone for the next 5 minutes with priority speaker. 
---
We ROT13 all passwords three times for extra security
---
Ol' Blue Eyes Avery taught me not to bling fit a carrier. 
---
I see Test's literary program is still suffering from a lack of funding. 
---
i did, it was in another comment chain from the post you're responding to bruh
---
While I have no problem admitting defeat, just because they are goons doesn't mean they have the support of the goons. Like Panfam, Legacy, and the imperium there are smaller groups of players doing their own thing. It maybe 4-5 players of the goons doing their own thing.  I need more info before I call them risk adverse chumps. If they are self destructing extra ships just in case, that's fine. Let us know how it's ends. You might actually get a fight.
---
*Rather*?! That's the best part of the fleet. Honesty, any time being in a Steadyo fleet was one of my highlights of the game.
---
not sure anyones ever given a fuck what you think
---
Pretty much nothing of note has happened in the past 2 years. Welcome to Eve Online post 2016, where the only people still playing play for the sole purpose of seeing their wallet grow.

No, you need 'Imperium" ammo.

I welcome a future where our respective newbie-alliances have large enough capital fleets that we can whelp them and make good natured jokes about it.

So you posted that at roughly the same time I posted my comment, and you're booty blasted because I didn't refresh after typing my comment to see if you posted yet another borderline incoherent post in response to someone else? Literally what?

 You have terminal smooth brain lmfbo.

Who the fuck does that? That era of WH space is pretty much over.

I just didnt think of the fact I would need minnie fuel for a minnie DD. I have plenty of oxy, shoulda kept that DD fit :(
---
What greed? CCP are hardly making masses of cash and setting the world on fire. They are a business and they are making money just like every other. Skill injectors has to happen to keep the game alive and skins only exist if you want them otherwise they can be completely ignored.

Alright, after a long session of trying to remember my stolen accounts name, i did find it. however, im actually really embarrassed by it so I'm gunna stick with "I'm a liar and i made it up" :)
---
Supes have more blinky fighter things though instead of just one blinky gun thing.
---
this guy betrayed the mighty COALICION HISPANA. so they paid me a good bounty to get him killed. this is the result 
---
PGL was far more level headed about it than the comment here give him credit.
---
If anything, it seems he had his hands on too many things, should delegate some more.
---
"I was tethered dammit!"
---
TL;DR
---
Song list for the video? They were dope.
---
If what you say is accurate, I'm sure they will get nerfed. New overpowered items is a valid strategy on to bring back and engage players from a business perspective. Look at World of Tanks, or League of Legends. Release new tank/hero -&gt; is overpowered, everyone wants to try it -&gt; they inject $$ to get it -&gt; tank is nerfed. Repeat cycle.

lots of words to say that triglavian ships still aren’t as food as the ferox 
---
gon homophobic slurs, cool cool
---
That could be it. Its certainly working, if my corp is any indication. But what concerns me about that is how nobody *mentions* it. I bring it up in comms and everybody generally agrees, but compared to the days of Svipul Online everyone has been completely silent about an entire line of ships being as oppressive as T3Ds were to destroyers and AFs.
---
wtf I would never engage in DISHONORABLE SPYING.... 
---
Plus they're more annoying to box unless you dont use hulks in which case their yield is lower. You don't have 11b on field but you do need 3x as many accounts subbed for similar mining yields, and really a pure mining rorq doesn't need many more so than a exhumers alt. You would still nees to haul uncompressed ore or put a sieged rorq in the belt (unsure how many rorq changes op envisions not being in place). Exhumers are produced with t2 stuff not just kre like a rorq so could trigger market issues if dying in latge numbers. Etc.
---
Odds are we'd have less cap proliferation and more small gang activity in null (though maybe still not in delve), imo.
---
PGL screeching is pretty common,  I had a spy in test for a while and their comms is freaking awefull compared to NC or a goons.  Viley is a good FC hes calm and measured.   
---
I think a lot of the ragey FC are old school, over the years FC's have gone to a calmer and more commonally designate out roles out to other players.  When you are multiple coms with other alliances you have to remain calm and measured to get in all info and a get out correct info and decisions
---
If you want to talk about ragey FC,  PGL and hedliner are the first 2 on my list.  Old vince did at times explode but over the years he has mellowed out and think hes better off for it
---
FCing has changed from 1 person doing everything designating out roles which takes some of the stress off the FC.  FCing has become a team rather than an individual 
---
I agree that the new trig ships are pretty good, but I do want to make one note about the kiki.
---
&gt; Now put on decent speed and a solid tank. If you thought ceptors, Garmurs, kitey T3Ds or Retributions were bad...
---
Specifically, the fact that, unlike many of those ships, the kiki can't sigtank at all. Being a destroyer it's got a fat-ass sig compared to its hp, and unlike the various advanced destroyers it's got t1 resists and no sig reduction bonuses. I fully agree that the kiki is a terrifying ship, but it's worth noting that, despite its decent tank, it *does* have a vulnerability to longer range cruiser-scale weapons fire that other small kiters shrug off.
---
ncdock still undocks more than most wormholers tho! :)
---
How do you haul? Dst, freighter? I saw the pushx post the other day and I'm kinda intrigued.
---
If you aren’t in standing fleet when you light the cyno then omae wa mou shindeiru
---
Haha, fair enough.  o7
---
Honestly if the Drekavac had range rigs for its guns it would instantly kick the Ferox out as #1 fleet ship. Regardless not everything is about large fleet fights, and for smaller groups or solo players the Ferox is pretty trash.
---
This is true. With average group being less than 10, and most play together, you are unlikely to even enter a wh with any online
---
and after allllll, its the russians' fauuuuult

"dreads put a cyno in your spare mid" -- PGL 2019
---
that would be Snupi ?
---
Wat?
---
lol 
---
Who is the beta male that is talking from the start? is it PGL or someone else 
---
dam right lmao. 
---
all of null and lowsec (lol) is PL and pets vs Goons and pets. Goons could kick everything over but are too busy adding zeros to isk wallets so let test get fucked, while PL is a dead shell propped up by ncdock (lollol) and phorde (fuckin lol x1000) 
---
its certainly a balancing factor, and along with the lower speed is probably the only reason assault frigates are still a thing, but its signature with a shield extender+MWD is actually better than that of any T3D not in defense mode. Its got the damage and projection of a confessor in Sharpshooter with the speed of a Svipul in propulsion and the tracking of a Hecate. You have so much room to maneuver with no worry of transversal control so you can easily avoid threats and wipe tackle until incoming damage is irrelevant cus nothing is left on grid to actually point you or your gang. Lower survivability is just not enough to warrant that kind of power.
---
/r/Eve today is extremely high quality.
---
I think you hit the nail on the head with the comment about the expense. If for instance the Kiki were comparably prices to its alternatives, you would have Kikis online. I can’t think of any reason not to use it other than the expense. 
---
Just been gifted a set of hg Halos and ascendancy + omega's the ascendancies i have a use for but what do people use hall's for these days? I'm thinking it's only really useful in frigs/cruiser hulls?

Sometimes the music in videos dictates whether you can do that or not (and in those cases, it's not up to the person who uploaded the video).
---
I average around 40-60mil an hour huffing the average priced stuff, when you get into c230 or whatever those higher value ones are you're looking at 100mil maybe more an hour, and for the complete lack of effort you really can't beat it.
---
Another thing is the whole wormhole situation as we cant easily switch around ships and doctrines especially at the very start.
---
i'm framing the post and selling it to the Omaha Museum of Art with the title "Victories in the Cultural Revolution," by Alexander "The Mittani" Gianturco
---
correct, getting things like a dramiel to the sig radius of a hobgoblin is pretty op in some cases.
---
It’s gankin‘ time
---
DST, mostly highsec these days. Could go into detail if you're curious.
---
Damn why are you guys so fucking salty?
---
Fuck... you Avree the acclaimed streamer and EVE personally owe Headliner better than this man.
---
Some still go around doing their thing. Though most hisec ganking usually happens around Jita rather than 0.5
---
Why is a Providence in a C2?  
---
&gt; or they're not very effective
---
In that sentence, by "they're not very effective" I think you mean "they do absolutely jack shit"
---
Get HYPED to sit and do NOTHIIIIIIING!
---
Halos can be used as a sometimes cheaper alternative to training pods. Other uses can be for any ship that will be used in a situation that requires lower signature radius. This is usually just smaller sub capitals, but this would include more than just frigates and cruisers. A number of destroyers can have greatly improved survivability against cruisers with a lower sig, like T3Ds while battlecruisers can also benefit against ships with bad tracking if they have Halos.
---
I’d say that Snakes are far better than Halos for damage mitigation in most situations (though cost is an issue) but Halos are okay for most small gang fits. 
---
Please do! Do you run with a hauling corp or some service? How's the isk, and what about gankers? Is Transport Ships IV enough for anything? I have questions!
---
I’m sorry. I’ll strive to do better. 
---
Hello everyone! I am the one who uploaded/edited the video and the footage was provided by Intaky. I never expected to get so much attention, so thanks OP for posting it here. Thanks to everyone who liked it o disliked it, I enjoy editing them anyway.
---
To answer some of the questions here...
---
-Intaky or me never had the intention of hiding the true nature of this kill. It was in fact a blue intel kill. Is part of how Eve works, just like Groot2c said. I blurred some of the channels so the owner of the spy can reuse it and in fact it still active and going to the CTAs. Haha
---
- It was intentional to show the viewers what is happening. I don't like to hide kill, loses or anything. Even when I am the one providing the pvp/footage, I show the loses.
---
-The song is  Charli by Day Din
---
- Dacler, the victim, was in fact an ex member of  Coalicion Hispana. Intaky collected a significant amount of isk for accomplishing this kill. The bounty was paid by their CEO RKMacartur.
---
Fly safe!
---
They gank anything, but usually not Ventures because Hulks and Exhumers are more expensive and a solitary Venture might be bait.
---
The ships on the left look more like a combo of common ants and pacifier/enforcers
---
ship was a handout no judgement pls
---
3 hours in a tech 2 venture gets you enough to build another t2 venture. If you’re gas harvesting in WH or nullsec, you can get another one in like 15 minutes.
---
THey use asic miners do they count?
---
lmao you're salty! argument destroyed, ben shapiro destroys retarded leftist wormholes with logic, reasoning, and the power of god!
---
&gt;  and for smaller groups or solo players
---
god forbid ships not be as trash as the nomen/ashimmu/phantasm 
---
They said they have around 60 active people so that sounds about right.
---
That implies to me a new context menu item from within the skill training screen, not remote injecting.
---
is this better than the porpoise?
---
It's been awhile but I'm 99% sure you don't. 
---
I think they fuck with us this way because they know the cartel is the least douchebag 0.0 entity in new eden. 
---
More than half from bots. 
---
Remember the day of butterfly effect? Where you could make a difference. This poster speaks to me of. 'Hey you do not matter, but hey look you can not matter for free!'
---
Sounds to me like he did delegate, but then started yelling over the people he delegated to. Not that it's incredibly surprising given the circumstances, but it sure didn't help.
---
What was left out: get bumped and ganked while mining
---
pgl and hubris, name a more iconic duo
---
What you say is true but I’m not sure that this is what’s holding people back from using these ships more regularly. A non-blinged Kiki costs about 200mm compared to say any other t3d at around 60mm. Not to mention the cost of the skillbooks and the training time required. Other t3ds have similar sigs in all modes except defense, which to use you must sacrifice speed and dps. 
---
Frankly even given the cost, I’d give up my t3ds in favor of the kiki if I didn’t have to acquire the skillbooks and spend all the time training it. 
---
Agreed with /u/ratt_man and /u/Emrod2, generally (though not always) the only "ragelords" that make it as FCs are ones that command enough respect and/or are fun enough to be under that line members will deal with the loud and obnoxious mood.
---
That being said, I'm sure having to wrangle a billion sperglords alongside all the other command channels and having your planned op fall to shambles all around you didn't really help matters, but...yeah, yikes.
---
On the plus side leshaks give nanogangs a valid option vs. krab supers which has significantly increased the rate of retarded super losses in renter null
---
Or that you can use a mining barge as an alpha.
---
Yes. Its links are slightly weaker, but a porpoise can't gas harvest. It's better to have +1 gas harvesting ship (a brutix is just as good as a venture) than it is to have the better links, unless your gas huffing fleet is HUGE.
---
2 dirty blobbers and 3 alts. AMA
---
And thats something it *should* excel at, shooting a stationary object over a longer time while holding the grid at close range. But when the same Leshak fit can fight a Vindicator or scare off a Nightmare or out tank a Rattlesnake, you start to realize theres not much reason to use those ships at all.
---
While I see the similarities, keep in mind that the Cormorant we have now is a facelift of the older one.
---
Hah +1 nice try.
---
I’m almost certain those are tier2(?) aeon transports which fly in the opposite direction and are carrying some engineers underneath the hull (the pod looking bits) so nah, but you’ll definitely catch out some people that look.
---
Are non-warp disruption Burst Projectors on Supers used a lot in big fleets? if so, which ones?/ if not, why not?
---
If every ship sucks, no ship sucks. Small gang warfare is honestly very varied, with a lot of viable options that fill certain roles (including every ship you mentioned.) When these ships come in and beat everything at everything you wind up with Triglavian gatecamps ganking Triglavian solo players and getting killed by Triglavian kitey gangs and you wind up with the counter to a Leshak being 2 Leshaks instead of any single ship.
---
... they look nothing alike?
---
with their pants down
---
Intaky is the one who selects most of my Eve videos songs, he is my personal DJ. ;)
---
Doubt it. He uses a carrier now. ;)
---
In Russia, techno plays YOU. 
---
I just got into this last night because I assumed it'd be good (desperately needed) ISK, so I went to a wormhole gas site and started huffing, scared off someone else, huffed all of one cloud, started on another, then had a "socket closed" message, and once I logged back in I was floating in my pod and had been ganked by the sleepers. 
---
10/10 experience
---
Careful there, keep spinning that hard and you're liable to tear yourself apart.
---
Except that catering to this type of play style and making accessible to everyone on the scale that if is will eventually ruin the in game economy by making everything plentiful and scarcity the only thing that is scarce. 
---
Cloaky camp
---
Careful, you might summon... It's like saying bloody mary in the mirror...
---
Target an asteroid in range, and then tell them to go mine it.
---
Mining drones don't go after anything unless you give them a specific target.
---
Yes, sorry I should have specified. I have targeted sever different types of ore and told them to mine, they move to the asteroid and fly around it but never mine it. 
---
Wondering if there are certain types of ores mining drone 1 can’t mine?
---
It even says mining on each of their statuses, but after ten minutes they never return, never shoot a laser at the asteroid and my ore hold stays empty.
---
 
---
[Ansiblex - Jump Gate](https://updates.eveonline.com/card/7hQhj/ansiblex-jump-gate/) made public. You see more of these when you are in a corp or alliance with several of these - this one is just open to everyone, so you see it.
---
Good call!
---
How do you properly make a serious amount of ISK as a noob? I basically just do data/relic sites in my little Imicus because the entry cost is so low and I have the skills trained which is... okay; I tried gas huffing but haven't seen real benefits from that yet (because of my own stupid fault I lost two ventures last night, one due to a client disconnect when the rats warped in. This + the skillbook drained half my liquid capital).
---
I just want to fund getting into solo PvP but I have no idea how everyone has so much money in this game. Do you just grind one activity a lot?
---
If they have caps it was for moving refined minerals from a refinery to the azbel/fort for production. Could also be for an asset logoff loot denial strategy with another alt there as a scanner to regain access and anchor a new structure once the eviction duders leave.
---
I would suggest trying to make a short video of yourself trying to mine, so we can watch it happening and see if there's something going on.
---
Go big or go home, am i right?
---
Triglav fighters
---
They had no chance. The attackers started seeding hundreds of DST's into that C2 back in 2003. 
---
Needs a T2 Turbo Encabulator
---
what is old is new again
---
G2a shield costs like a dollar a month and ensures if ur code doesnt work u get a new one or refund. 
---
Yeah but then Horde is associated with PL, who in turn is associated with Hard Knocks... no thanks :D 
---
Next do one about hotdropping. I've got some sample lyrics for you:
---
Did you log in your spy?  
---
Does everybody want to log in their spies?
---
Drop on the mongs
---
Ok disclaimers:  tired, logged off, have not tried mining with porpoise aka guessing
---
I seem to remember that you can only use certain drones with the orca like augmented or something.  Since the porpoise is a mini orca perhaps is the same thing.  I don’t think it can do mining with t1 mining drones and not sure if it would kick out an error message or not.
---
I am having the same problem 
---
Id like to know how to add my accounts to the SiSi login.  Nothing I've tried lets me get past 2FA… 
---
What you do is stop playing eve and wait until they turn it into a real game and remove local chat. 
---
Excuse me sir, the Phantasm is a great ship
---
No, you can use anything except the Excavators b/c those are like mining Fighters. They can only be used on a Rorq. But everything else is fair game.
---
CCP has sold out to today's micro transaction and accesabltity game design. Eve dungeons and arena.. abysal filaments. All this promotes a dumbed down game experience for the masses. Eve would be far better a game without Plex, injectors and instanced PvE/PvP. Think of how much money CCP made when they buffed rorqs and everybody and their dog injected 6 rorq alts. 
---
I've only been here for like four or five years, don't know if I qualify?
---
But tl;dr with the increase in resources in the economy from rorqs &amp; new krab mechanics, **we should have more fights; instead we have less.** We have enough isk to be welping 1k dreads at each other every week, and we're pissing around in jackdaws and blops because it's pointless to invade space or something I guess. 
---
If I had to pin down the cause I'd say it's because it's pointless to try and engage a super umbrella w/o your own supers, and nobody's willing to risk supers (because you're out of the sov game if you die) so we keep running around in fast kitey shit &amp; prestaged fights instead of being able to commit to serious brawls. 
---
Super umbrellas were always a cancer on the game, suppressing fights because nobody was willing to escalate to supers unless they could guarantee a win (but you get 420hyp3rd4nked if the other side drops and you don't, so you don't show up at all, or you bring svipuls or something). I don't think this is actually much worse than it was in 2013; the same incentives started applying as soon as supers became the decisive strategic force in sovwar. It's just disappointing that the game's core problems were never even identified, much less addressed, in the last 5 years. 
---
And knowing CCP's timetables, even if they can perfectly diagnose all the problems with the game, they won't be willing to roll out fixes until ~2022, which is pretty depressing to think about. 
---
Like I said was a guess and was not sure.  Didn’t see anything on the wiki yet either 
---
No worries =)
---
F2P was the beginning of an end. 
---
So what is his problem then?  Has me frowning and I really don’t want to get out of bed and log in :)
---
&gt; tank is nerfed 
---
except this step takes years.
---
&gt; Do you run with a hauling corp or some service?
---
Nope. Short version is, most if not all hauling corps want you to be in a freighter to do hauls, and a freighter isn't something I'm comfortable with doing, and I'll get into why in a bit.
---
&gt;How's the isk, and what about gankers?
---
Isk isn't *great* but it's decent. Most of the time, I get paid somewhere around 1 million a jump. Sometimes more, sometimes less. The payout is often semi random - some people pay very little, others pay exorbitant amounts. One time I got paid 500 *million* to do a dst haul, just because the guy was in such a horrible pinch and I'd saved his neck.
---
In practice, most of the time when something pays well the pay isn't worth the risk - it's not hard to find contracts that pay the same in both highsec and lowsec for a working example, yet to do anything in lowsec I need to make instadocks+undocks and be very careful with scouting the route, let alone flying it. Often just isn't worth the time investment to do the lowsec haul.
---
As for *suicide* gankers, in a DST/BR *flown correctly* (ex: use instadocks+undocks, cloak+mwd the DST, cloak the BR AND DON'T AUTOPILOT.) you're relatively safe compared with any tech 1 industrial - but of course you still should never fly a route that you know is being actively ganked, or to do other needlessly risky things.
---
&gt;Is Transport Ships IV enough for anything?
---
Yes! In a DST, that'll give you 60k m3 in your fleet hangar. most DST sized contracts will be this size or smaller, as training that skill to V is *crazy* long, and only gives you another 2500 m3. I do in fact have this trained, but my DST is my #1 used ship, so it was an obvious thing to do.
---
Now as promised, I'll explain why I don't use a freighter. Tech 1 freighters are something that I actually originally wanted to get into very badly, as they can carry the most cargo period of anything in game. Thing is though, they're absolutely defenseless. A tech 1 freighter can only fit cargo expanders, bulkheads, or inertial stabilizers - and even fully skilled with bulkheads, gankers can *easily* have a bumper cargo scan you to see if you're carrying anything they want to steal, bump you if you are indefinitely, then gank you when they get around to it.
---
This means that a solo freighter with its near 40 second align is a defenseless loot pinata waiting to be whacked as soon as the gankers feel like it.
---
With alts, this can be remedied - to an extent. Upon dueling the alt, the freighter can be webbed by it, allowing it to enter warp near instantly - making it far more difficult for anyone to gank it. Assuming of course your alt gets to the freighter before the bumper does... If the freighter is being bumped, it's already too late.
---
Alts can also be used to check the route in front of you, a good way to see if the gankers are active before you commit to putting your freighter where they are.
---
Now, for the main reason I don't do this. There is no conceivable way I can imagine that I'll ever be able to have that alt pay for itself using the isk I make from doing courier contracts. I'm not nutty enough to pay real money for a second account *just* so I can use a freighter - I'm fairly sure the isk I make doing DST and lower sized contracts isn't as much, but even so, it's the best bang for the buck in my opinion.
---
With that in mind, and that it's absolute suicide to fly a solo freighter, that's why I don't.
---
To learn more about hauling in general I'd check out "Haulers Channel" - that's the full name without the quotes, not "Haulers" or something else.
---
Just to be crystal clear, I'll say it again on its own line:
---
Haulers Channel
---
When I first started I had grand dreams of being the next MC/BOB/ISS. 
---
The idea of a small pocket of sov and being able to field a fleet of say 4 carriers with really healthy battleship support and a good amount of tackle/logi/cruiser wings was fapworthy. And I worked my ass off. So did all of my friends.
---
This game was THE GAME. 
---
Now I ask nagging questions on Reddit a decade + later after I stopped paying. Sov mechanics and supers were stupid as shit in 2005. Look at now. Fuck no.
---
Thanks!
---
Pretty much. Eve is in the age people will have a pvp toon roaming around and a rorqual alt mining. Due to umbrellas and PANIC they are pretty safe so long as they pay an inkling or attention. Some people won’t grind mining, they’ll have PI networks, market manipulation, rat, or explore such as you. If you “grind” as a means to support pvp you’re doing it right in my book. Grinding for the sake of grinding feels....boring to me personally
---
F2P is fine injectors is what is killing it.
---
Garbage.
---
It all began in 2015; everything on the roadmap since 2015 has consistently shown to be a failure and a massive power imbalance.
---
Skill Injectors? Great on paper, but they removed significant bottlenecks to reactive fleet doctrines/meta swings in Eve.
---
Citadels? Damage caps were a great idea in theory but paired with the spammability of the Astrahus and Raitaru, it is ridiculous that CCP took 1.5 years to iterate upon the basic mechanics involved with them. This is just the surface level issues of course, there's lots more.
---
Rorquals/Cap Changes? They are breaking the economy of the game and causing people to huddle up in big piles in certain regions leaving sparse borderlands inbetween regions where you have to be a fucking idiot or awoxed to die in. Paired with skill injectors, they have advanced the endgame of Eve so drastically that I am unsure how to fix it. 
---
Moon changes? Great for creating decentralized, bottoms-up income, but it has effectively killed off much of lowsec and a big reason to clash with others in a region. Alliances that don't have a strong industrial base now have trouble sourcing funds by doing pvp things. You can say all you want how this is good for the game, but I see it as walling off a certain playstyle for those that cannot easily afford replacements or consistent funding for their stuff when Eve of the post-citadel era **NECESSITATES** those in order to stay competitive.
---
And these are just the most salient points. CCP has reverted to releasing half-baked content to the game in large quantities that are quickly abandoned or not iterated upon. NPC Sotiyos? Cheesed by a half a dozen LR titans and supers, no attempt at fixing them to justify fleets of people taking them on. Abyssal Space? Hope you like the Gila meta that has evolved just like in every other PvE aspect of Eve. There's so much shit that's just broken that its hard to know wtf it is that CCP is doing behind the scenes.
---
**DO NOT GET ME WRONG.** I do not think that Eve of 2014-2015 was a healthy state of the game either. But neither was the economy imploding in several sectors, or multiple titans camping every gate. Not everyone had a HAW dread or a tracking dread, or dropped carriers on roaming gangs, it was still possible to get content and get a fight in many places, but it feels impossible for that these days.
---
IDK.  I like PGL fleets.  He's obivously passionate about the game, and he's pretty clear that he expects us to suck less (Test has a lot of casual players, and some of us suck sometimes.  Actually, most of the time).
---
I'm not alone.  No one forces us to join his fleets, and he forms some if the biggest fleets in game.
---
Generally, he wins most of the fights he doesn't get helocopter dicked by supers and the in.
---
Basically, regardless of whatever opinion you've formed of him based on 10 minutes of audio and a clip about two dictors, he's actually a pretty good FC.
---
CENTI and Tenerifis
---
They're also not what they look like, those are aeon t2 air transports carrying engineers from Supreme Commander so its a combo of two different units.  The main difference apart from that is that they fly big end forward
---
RIP in pieces never forget o7o7o7
---
Technical Issues. Slow reaction times to visible bugs and scaleability issues would indicate that there is a level of immaturity to maturity feature development underway. Unfortunately the QA and community adoption process will suffer.
---
Feature Development. Roadmap has no big bold initiatives, indicates a fractured product management leadership in place or likely a product management in place looking to double down on a "big bang release" instead of incremental growth.
---
Focus is primarily on re-using existing features, meaning its still a early-mid game content adoption play and less about driving new mechanics into the game whilst the 'POS code made me do it' excuses are tapering down, they still linger as a blocker to new feature development.
---
Community is starting to be heavily weighted towards one specific area, which can result in wider economic impacts to in-game experiences ranging from super/titan fights to end-game adoption boredoms. Community require folks are exploiting EULA conditions to be purged but it appears to be a slow / latency driven reaction which would indicate that focus on security and integrity of existing features are likely being relegated to lower priority efforts.
---
Ship balances are still in debate, on average a peak player at maximum skill levels will yield anywhere between 100-500m per hour if the system they are in is heavily fortified with response fleet behaviours and/or coalition/alliance/corp occupying provides enough of a foundation to bootstrap larger ship adoption cycles.
---
Doing structure bashing or sov chess, still is a mechanic that reminds you that eve is not instant feedback loop generated experience and thus causes players to crave high risk / large battles which in turn has a big build up and release behaviour followed by reddit victory lap posts that cringe.
---
:D
---
2014 player so not quite the bitterest of vets.  My main is closing in on 100m sp and have never used an injector.  I've barely logged in in the last year, a few basically just a few spectre fleets here and there and a weekly PI management.  I've gone through periods of inactivity before, but this time feels different.  It feels like everything has been done, losing a titan isn't even devasting anymore.  Injectors has made it so basically anyone can have infinite alts after paying an initial cost to get the sp you need and going into sp farm maintenance mode.  My ~30b in liquid isk  feels like pennies.
---
I still love the game, but I find I have less and less motivation to log in and do anything beyond manage my skill que and PI farms.  I was even one of the people saying that injectors were more or less equal to the character bazaar that already existed, but the way they've changed the game is undeniable.
---
Data/Relic as a noob is very good isk, you just need to increase your efficiency. You need to be doing them in nullsec if your not. The most difficult part here is learning how to navigate nullsec safely, but its a skill worth learning. You should also be exploring in the same region each time you go out, find a place in null you like, and make it your area of operations for exploring, this allows you to do two major things. Setting up bookmarks (safespots, Stargate tactical/pings, insta docks and undocks) and logging SIG IDs so you don't waste time scanning the same SIG multiple times. You can easily make enough isk this way to fund a frig/t1 cruiser PvP habit.
---
Only comparing ships in 1v1 scenarios in isolation is a really bad poor way to show relative power. Spoolup dps especially is at its strongest in any 1v1 due to the longer time to kill and the situation changes drastically as soon as other ships get involved. 
---
Using your own numbers lets compare the Dreka to the BNI in a 2v2, instead of your 1v1 example. The combined Brutix dps kills the first Dreka in just over 52s, with the first Brutix not going down until the 64s mark. At this point the last Dreka is down to 81k ehp with 1 full health Brutix left on field and his spoolup is reset. Final Dreka goes down at the 144s mark with the Brutix sitting on 30k ehp.
---
Now I'm not saying that these ships might not be overpowered in certain aspects. Their speed, projection and tracking makes for a very potent combination and perhaps could do with toning down somewhat however you cannot say they are overpowered based on 1v1 performance that vanishes the moment a single extra ship becomes involved.
---
You also spend most of the game zoomed out in a tactical mode looking at icons instead of actual units 🤔 c̩̟͇̩̜̟ͅò̦̝̠̬͉̟͞ͅi҉̪̲͇̫n̶̳̝̯̳̺̟ç̵̛̣̭̘̜̠̩̮̼í̳͔̹͙̩͡d͏̧̥͎͓̝̱̻͞ͅe̹̙͟n͔̙͕͍͔̺̜c̷̡҉̯̯e̫͙͠͞
---
yeah theyre the t2 ones, the t1s are little saucers. Looks like tech 1 engineers as well although it could be t1 light tanks, the angle makes it very difficult to tell.
---
looks like dread tank for the anchoring fort
---
The shadows are flying spacedicks. 
---
But no bragging or spin about how TEST is the greatest. 
---
bit of a mix
---
on one side, its easier than ever to get ships.
---
on the other, between spammed to hell citadels that arent worth the time to kill allowing everyone to dock ot avoid any fights,  sov being...more or less useless in wars outside cyno jammers, and super umbrellas its a problem
---
plus, FW is absolutely screwed in its current state, most of the new "modes" CCP puts in die fast outside niches (resource wars, abyss),   and the old ratting/minning, hasn't changed at all,  just different ships, same shit.
---
plus, dreads are no longer siege ships, as citadels aren't something you want to siege.  its something u want subcaps for.  so dreads are just throwaway dread bombs.
---
....yeah its easy to think of the stuff i have problems with.  there are alot of new pros.  but i cant think of them atm. cause i sitting here on astra #25 bashing the fking thing knowing full well it will be replaced before its 7 day reinforce timer is even 1/4 of the way through
---
Game is doing ok. At the moment the game is too big for how many players it has, so it feels empty too often.
---
My main opinion is that the changes and features added in the last few years were all good ideas that make sense in isolation, but the way they act together breaks them and makes them cancer.
---
Rorqs, Injectors, Infinite Fozzie Anoms, Fozzie Sov, Cap rebalance, Free2Play were all ok in isolation. but... 
---
**Rorqs sieging** to mine is a good idea on its own, however, when combined with the **infinite high density mining anoms**, they pack so tightly together that you can fit half the game under 1 cap umbrella without running out of rocks. This would be ok but the **cap rebalance** means that caps apply so well to subs that you never need to bring anything else other than caps from the umbrella, and the only counter is just n+1 caps. This umbrella then makes a safe krabbing zone, which wouldnt be too broken if there wasnt something to pour the wealth into. **skill injectors** come into the picture here as all this rorq wealth can be used to buy injectors to insta make more rorqs, all of which scale easily. The rorqs make huge amounts of minerals which then get poured into titans as the **cap rebalance** means that more caps is the optimum strategy always. This consolidates a huge number of players into a few small areas meaning that the rest of space feels even more empty than already dropping player numbers should make it feel. 
---
**Fozzie Sov** mechanics seem fine when you read them, but in reality EVE has so many systems that when you scale fozzie sov mechanics past contesting anything more than 5ish systems at a time it makes it totally cancer to deal with, as the effort/system ratio is off for how many systems real conflicts cover.
---
Lastly, the **free 2 play** means that making and spamming bots is so incredibly easy that there is no easy way for CCP to keep on top of them at all.
---
**TLDR - The changes made recently (rorqs, injectors, caps etc..) make sense in isolation, but become cancer when they actually interact with each other in game**
---
Thats PGL’s normal tone, that wasnt even him mad
---
I love how [the dude](https://evewho.com/pilot/Elron+Hoover) that used to run/help run the group that lived in that C2 is now evicting said C2.
---
a few hours for venture as i remember 
---
Has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like?
---
Say what you will,  PGL is one of the best fc's in the game. 
---
I think that the whole Alpha/Omega thing helps to contribute to some of the issues of the game.
---
It is the meta bro, CCP gotta have something a little bit imbalanced in the game to keep the game fresh
---
Two years after that will be another story
---
Soooo, like eve?
---
Wooshers
---
I really do feel like 2012 was when things started shifting in this game, I'm just not sure in what direction. 
---
Damn. 
---
Didn't know the vulture could do this
---
That's an important thing to consider, and you make the point well. Though only having one "option" for single player PvP is still an issue.
---
Started playing around 10 years ago, shelved it a few years ago when I started not having enough time to play. Kinda never really grabbed me back, and I've just been watching CCP bungle development. I look back at the state of the game when I stopped and where it is now, and I don't think it's really improved.
---
You tell them Mik
---
I find it odd that a test dude is telling me to not judge someone by a 10 minute vertical slice when you folks did the same to killah (not included in the comms was the shit he had to respond to including mic spammers). I agree in general, just funny.
---
I only read in detail about 2/3 but as someone that runs abyss as my primary activity atm, and also is an industrialists that produces abyss shit, the prices will come down. They already did but they will come down more and eventually stabilize after a bottom (especially the skills, BS, cruiser, frig skills are all dirt cheap now)
---
Part of the reason prices are so wonky is good ships are still being found to run the sites and while gila can do several types easily those filaments are getting really expensive. Once dark and firestorm fits are more popular the prices will drop more.
---
I don't think many of us in Test actually think Killah is a shit FC, we all just appreciate that he said some meme worthy shit.
---
Thats true but its also not hard
---
I do not think people thought he is a bad fc, just some people were drawing the conclusion that he is toxic. Could have just been the propaganda at the time since it seems to have become more of a meme as time went on.
---
Australian
---
I have those delusions of grandeur, and then I remember who I am, lol! I still get ideas now and then, the recent Wardec changes put the kibosh on one of them though. On that subject, I feel that CCP catered to the whims of bigger entities when they changed some of the mechanics years ago, and that's what led to what we have today.
---
no it wouldn't
---
I feel billboards and the need to have an epic KB led to a lot of risk averse behavior in regards to caps. Of course, I'm sure there are some entities that couldn't afford to lose them either, and the decision to use them became a risk/reward equation. However, as I have little experience with caps and such, I cannot speak with much authority on them.
---
Congrats for the kill. Kiki is at the borderline of being OP. And to kill it with a Rifter requir serious piloting skills. It is not like you can depend on the FC to tell you what to do.
---
This is very insightful, thank you!
---
&gt;I've (luckily) only experienced calm FCs.
---
Then Securitas has come a long way since I last was on his fleets over a year ago. Figured he died from throat cancer from yelling at literally everyone and we haven't even undocked yet.
---
But agreed, most new FCs i've been on fleet with are, pretty calm mostly since i've re-subbed a month ago.
---
Where is tgl?
---
well I appreciate PGL working for 2 months on this latest track.  
---
shits fire.
---
The group had become elitist and entitled. Rather than simply unanchor the fort we left. We rolled into them a couple of weeks later and we started plinking the fort to say hi. No one responded.. for five days. We burned through shields and armor on all three structures before anyone even noticed. Rather than watch what we had built up whither away we decided to put old yeller down.
---
Eh. They created a future and did not put safeguards in place. It was 2003, they had a vision that was awesome, AND IT BLEW UP IN THEIR FACE. Im back in college at 40. It happens to the very best of us.
---
Tbh Interceptors needed something that could give them a good dicking.
---
How well would CCP be able to pull in new players if there wasn’t the alpha option, though? I’d never have got the game without it, even if I had a trial for a couple weeks. I’m not saying it’s great, but it’s certainly better than letting the game die because new people aren’t joining 
---
Check out the Amarr / Minmatar zone, it's much healthier than the other one atm. If you're looking to join an existing group of players that match your description of what you'd like to do, check out Schneckt.
---
You're an idiot.
---
They're paper thin and when fit for DPS will die to a jackdaw
---
waaah waaah waaah
---
Thanks for the tip, I'll start training into my super now
---
I definitely feel like 5-6 years ago was a better time for the game, but i dont know if thats just rosy glasses or an objectively true opinion.
---
owning a komodo and using the thermal dd, fucking frenchers
---
Single Tracking Disruptor completely hamstrings any trig ship.
---
&gt; The kimimora is thing. Quit being a fuccboi pussy and use ANY arty bonused ship (lmao cynabal) and delete it.
---
&gt; The Drek is indeed tanky, however it is slow, it relies heavily on cap. Do you not have a single geddon or curse? what the fuck year is this
---
No, your'e also an idiot, just like the other guy.
---
You can say that about a lot of ships, but is that a reason for them to do almost 2x the damage of the next best ship?
---
I did the three month for $20 bucks, so i have until march to decide if i want to continue to pay or not. At this point with my character, there's no point to try and play in an Alpha state.
---
The difference being, going back to college at 40 will probably improve your circumstances.
---
Great post.
---
join red alliance with a cyno alt...
---
There's a giant dong pic outside of the Amarr trade hub.
---
Eve is dead.
---
I'm winning.
---
What comes to mind when I think of eve?
---
".. abandon all hope ye who enter here."
---
Best part of the game now is following the sub and feasting on popcorn watching those who are still clinging to what we used to have.
---
I'm a super oldschool (subbed 2004) player who agrees with this sentiment.
---
The gulf between caps and noncaps is so huge that you've basically eradicated meaningful gameplay from all non cap fleets.
---
Frankly the best thing they could do is to rescale caps and subcaps so that Battleships and Dreads are roughly the same size and toughness, with one oriented towards fleet fights and the other towards territorial fights. Bring carriers and titans inline as well, to the point where a carrier targeted by a single battleship is in a VERY sorry stat and a Titan is at best the equivalent of like 3 battleships and equally adept at fleet fighting and territorial stomping. You can scale costs if you like but making a Titan worth 3 battleships and the premium for that is a couple of orders of magnitude would fix things SUPER QUICK.
---
He also uses 63 accounts to move around undetected. Unless the hunters wanted to cloaky camp all of Delve, or at least leave cyno alts safelogged in all systems with a lot of mining 
---
If people started seriously making Triglavian comps in null, it would be hard countered by ecm burst inties.  
---
It's not hard to have a squad or two of inties, setup with inline warps, and just keep breaking the bonuses of the trig ships. 
---
&gt;Rattles and Nightmares would be significantly better than a leshak at fleet pvp if there was any reason to use a BS in fleet pvp over carrier spam. 
---
Which game?
---
Valkorsia isn't in this recording
---
ty :)
---
This is a quality repost.
---
You sir, are quite legitimate.
---
Ecm burst? 
---
Tbh some of the most fun iv ever had in this game has been in bullshit t1 cruiser and destroyer fleets. 
---
But its a GIANT FRIGGIN LASER BEAM ATTACHED TO THEIR HEAD
---
remove supers 2019
---
(real talk tho)
---
WH evictions are by far the most boring thing I have ever done in EVE so kudos to you.  Station trading and PI was more enjoyable.
---
two years excuse me?
---
music is shit..... others are fine
---
Do you remember the corp management skill tree? Thinking NO FUCKING WAY anyone is getting 250 members together. I do. Then alliances got bigger than big. Thats when I said fuck it. Cap alliances at like 10 corps, cap corps at 100 members, and totally rework standings, and maybe just maybe you will see me out there in a worm again, cruising with some new guys, telling stories. Oh wait. Nevermind. You have to knock capitals back to carriers and dreads first.
---
supreme commander lol

this is amazing make more i beg you
---
please stop posting, thanks
---
I could type at length but I am very certain that history will show that skill injectors are both the worst decision CCP Games has ever made, and likely the worst development decision they will ever make. They completely shifted the meta of the entire sandbox by streamlining ISK to SP conversion and changed the way people are supposed to play the game. 
---
There is no reward for organic content in the game at this point. The sense of wonder and tension every time you undock or fly a new ship is gone (well maybe it's there for newer players) since ISK is so trivial. Non-money making space is largely completely abandoned and most attempts to revive it have been laughable at best because you simply put yourself at an immediate disadvantage by not joining a power bloc and farming under the supercapital umbrella and most times the risk is exponentially higher with a fraction of the reward. Ship balance in both PvE and PvP is simply non-existent at this point. The list goes on. 
---
Long story short it's a fine game, if you like the way the game is right now, but it's not the game I joined ten years ago. You might say it's burn out but I still fly mostly frigates as I have for many many years, and I still have fun each and every time I find another pilot to fight... when I find another pilot to fight. There's just not enough reward to fight for the sake of fighting, and there's way too much reward for simply refusing to do anything but empire building.
---
More like Beetlejuice... For the annoying factor. 
---
I do, I Do! I think I was up to dozens of members I could have in a Corp. Dozens!
---
Holy Space Cock, Batman!
---
Usually serious isk making takes some combination of SP, alts, effort and isk. It’s hard making isk when you’re newer, the more you learn the game and nuances of it the easier it gets to make isk. Also the more isk you have the easier it is to make isk. 
---
If you’re in high sec thats probably your first issue. 
---
Incursions are probably the quickest thing to train into doing that makes good isk for a new player. 
---
Thanks, I've been trying to be more like Brisc lately. I'm glad to see it's working.
---
Ccp leaves OP shit OP for a long time, typically until everyone starts flying it. Svipils, ishtars, etc. this is doubly so because needing Triglav would gut and therefore usage of Abyssal space, CCPs big recent investment. It’s not just a ship, it’s a whole segment of PVE.
---
I haven't slept in a week and I'm starting to sound like /u/Michael1995
---
People honestly don't give a fuck about their killboards. That mentality is largely fabricated and 95% of players that are active right now in the community:
---
1. Never flew with groups that actually did care about their killboards
---
2. Never played when those groups were legitimately active
---
The issue is that there's no reason to risk anything. You either mass drop everything into a legitimate contention over sovereignty or you fucking lose. Sometimes you do both. I mean the truth is there's legitimately no reward for fielding capitals unless you know the enemy is already escalating, in which case 99% of the time unless it's an obvious trap you just drop the hammer and nobody can even hope to escalate (further reinforcing the idea that it's kind of retarded to drop caps against anyone who's capable of bringing a greater super mass than you). The N+1 meta is stronger now than it has ever been. Imagine being CCP Games and you do all these mineral changes and see how many capitals are produced on a daily basis and you still see the largest alliance flying around in fucking Jackdaws because they simply don't have to do anything else to contest the vast majority of casual timers.
---
Bumping at high speeds should give an aggression timer so the Titan knows who the fuck bumped him so the whole fleet can shoot at them.
---
I love it, rorquals and skill injectors have allowed me to get 2 titans, several faxes / dreads and supers etc even tho I only started playing like 2 years ago by afk mining 8h a day in delve while watching netflix
---
To add onto what he was saying, I'd elaborate that many players may not understand just how much skill injectors have decreased the barrier of entry into the ISK to SP conversion and vice versa. For SP farmers in the past, you would have to bankroll a subscription for a character, pay for training implants, and then spend a significant amount of time training it into something useful before selling it on the Character Bazaar (which still somehow exists) and paying a 1000 nuPlex fee. SP farmers now simply start an unlimited amount of alpha clones, train them to 5 million SP or whatever the minimum is now, and immediately start profiting from SP extractions. The raw amount of SP changing hands nowadays is astonishing.
---
Additionally the income potential of skill injecting a rorq alt means most "serious" pilots have a few. This causes pilots that might not be in null to care a bit more about it. As a result I think you've got a lot of people more interested in keeping their isk faucet null alliance running than finding interesting shit to do in space they otherwise would be active in. 
---
Been playing since 2006, and Eve has changed quite a few times over those times.  In each of those huge swings and changes, the vocal parts of the community proudly declared that EVE was shit and going to die soon™  So the tl;dr that I'll shove at the front to save people time: EVE is just...*different*. Not necessarily in a bad way, but the game is certainly maturing.
---
If you look at highsec/PvE content, it's never been as good as it is right now.  If you don't want to interact with another player, or have limited interactions, you can do a plethora of PvE activities that simply didn't exist 10 years ago; even two years ago.  The ~elite~ at the time would chain belt rats and fight over static complexes that would respawn every few hours (and subsequently be camped by Russians, Australians, and anyone that could log in right after DT).  Now you've got your fill of different ways to interact with the environment, where you may or may not cross paths with another player.  HUGE boost. 
---
Industry has evolved, too. I remember having to literally mine in a Vexor, one of the most painstaking and tedious activities you can imagine.  Now there are more varied paths you can take other than mining, building, and researching.  
---
Lowsec has seen plenty of changes. Pirates and anti-pirates were actually a thing, though mostly they preyed on the players that had no idea what they were doing.  Then lowsec became stagnant and untouched.  Occasionally blocs would fight over moon ownership, but that wans't really a lowsec Thing.  
---
After FW was introduced, lowsec hit its stride.  From ~2008-~2013 it was packed with action, with no single party really dominating.  Summer of '08 when FW was first introduced, hot damn could you get some fights.  Some of my most fond memories were flying around Lowsec in a Drake fighting small groups trying to assert their dominance (and not really knowing wtf they were doing).  After the Phoebe jump changes and the moon changes, a wet blanket was really thrown over lowsec.  The groups that remained largely coalesced into one of two big powerblocs, which was A Thing until 2017.  Don't get me wrong, you can definitely get some sweet hot action in lowsec; one of the few places that you can roam for 30ish minutes and more or less guarantee yourself a (fairish) fight.  But it's definitely a downgrade from the heydey.  
---
Then you get to nullsec, where all the cool stories and wars are fought/posted about.  No matter the changes to the mechanics, it more or less (using pretty broad strokes in hopes of some semblance of brevity) turns into one huge bloc vs another, with a few independent parties peppered in.  After large wars, the blocs shatter into dozens of pieces but eventually they all get sucked back into blocs again.  From that political standpoint, nothing really changes.  
---
From a gameplay standpoint, it's different.  People are more organized and structured; a byproduct of the playerbase maturing.  There are periods that were really, hilariously, ridiculously fun and people active there will largely say "EVE is shit now".  It's not the case, though; there are fun fights to be had if you put the effort into it.  They aren't all stomps, and the stakes don't feel as high on a fight-to-fight basis - but you can find basically any sized fight that you're looking for.  
---
The one huge loss, and you've touched on it a bit, is that it feels like there are somehow too many and too few venues to read about EVE, fits, and the like.  There are so many groups putting out crazy great content, but there doesn't seem to be that One Place where you can consume everything you want.  You have to search for it, and even then you only get a piece.  /r/Eve is basically the One Place now...and I think everyone will agree /r/Eve is pretty lacking in non circlejerk memes.  Great source of circlejerk memes tho.  
---
Pretty much this. The new ships are obviously at a higher power level but given the obsirdity of carriers atm and capital balance there is reletively little outrage about them because they are honestly needed to combat the current capital power creep 
---
Nightmares I can believe but Rattles are slow pigs on top of having missile/drone weapons, which... are frequently derided in large scale fleet actions due to the delayed damage (and in the case of drones, I think also includes "doesn't respond (very well) under heavy TiDi conditions").
---
I've  actually associated with people who were Killboard curators, now granted, it's been years since, but they're out there. In regards to Caps, I admit I'm not much of an authority on the issue, I can only give my perception on the matter, tempered with the opinions of others on the subject. Take what i say with a grain of salt. :)
---
I try it and is anchoring now, thanks you :)
---
I started to follow this, then I wasn't.
---
Is it really child slavery when you make kids mine in a video game and give them 5% of the profit and friendship? 
---
I dont think supers are really that much of a problem. You can defang them super easy. I think the problem is lack of reason to have huge fights besides political reasons. 
---
We need to bring back regional resources. This would create alot of new content baised on securing reliable resource streams and also allow for a type of political sanctions. Also we really need to make planets more useful and have a reason to fight over them.
---
 Perhaps some kind of planet side super weapon capable of balancing sides if one side has a overwhelming supercap force.
---
Making some stuff deliberately overpowered for a while is a well-know game design principle. The idea behind it is forcing players to come up with new strategies, therefore shaking things up and keeping the game fresh.
---
I left for a year. Still have my old fits
---
Because look at the fucking capital meta, lol

---
So just like wow for me.
---
Lol. Hey, everybody! This guy thinks OC lore is still a thing.
---
So, can't put fins on a spaceship without ripping off Eve? Get real.
---
I like the idea, but lol. On another note, I did read something about there being a memorial for deceased pilots. 
---
In closing, I have to say, I cannot wait to see the day that 0.0 is totally owned and dominated by a single coalition.
---
"F"
---
no.
---
Yeah but sadly that will fade away when POS mechanics are eliminated from the game.  =(
---
npc sotiyos are also garbage in half of the space they can potentially spawn in because there's no chance of a titan bpc dropping in lowsec according to Larrikin 
---
They do that if the ore hold is full
---
How many divorces do you really want? Be honest, fat kid.

AAR: We (BUMS) have been skirmishing against NSH in Syndicate for a little while.  On the previous armor timer of that Astrahaus, we saw multiple scouts from other groups capable of forming lots of dreads, so didn't commit a real fleet, and just used a spearfishing comp to protect the structure.
---
NSH reinforced the structure again, and suspecting they would bring backup again, we asked for help from Iron, Fweddit, and I-RED.  We jumped in an initial group of caps and subcaps against NSH leshaks/nestors.  The fight escalated quickly from there, with NSH dropping dreads and Rote Kapelle bringing Loki's.  We counter dropped our caps, which outnumbered NSH caps significantly.  We had thought HullPen would be dropping with them, but they didn't commit to the fight.  Given our numbers advantage, we took down dreads quickly, and then moved on to subcaps.  Gf's all around and a shoutout to our allies for showing up to the fight.
---
Wut?
---
ITS A VIDEO GAME.
---
Even incursions aren't that stupid, I'm continuously blown away by CCP's lack of foresight.
---
As someone who has admittedly never done one before, what exactly is the content? My understanding is that besides being hard to get in, the sites in them don't amount to much because CCP never finished the storyline.
---
And?
---
the logic was "supers aren't in lowsec cause lore" unironically 
---
Hmm, puzzling. I've had this exact behavior before with salvage drones where after doing a lot of math I figured out the misbehavior was caused by them being incapable of salvaging a wreck - but they'd orbit it forever, doing nothing, not even failing.
---
I have to wonder. I don't know if this can happen in your case, but is one unit of the asteroid you are trying to mine larger in m3 than your mining drones can mine per cycle?
---
Another thing, I know mercoxit *can't* be mined by mining drones, but I have never been near it and don't know what sort of behavior drones have with it, if you're trying to mine it that's why it's not working.
---
As an experiment, try mining something easy, like veldspar and see if your drones work on that.
---
If I caught you or anyone else trying to memorialize me in ANY fake waste of life universe, I will personally haunt them straight to a hike in the woods, perpetually and for eternity. Its a fucking insult.
---
All I do is solo roam in Amarr/Minmatar FW. Plenty of good fights, and I've seen Schneckt around. Sounds like a good plan for OP.
---
can confirm.
---
source: am australian.
---
i dunno what is your objective but everyone is trying to mlg scam-kite\\kite hecate these days, so it's pointless in my opinion
---
As we all know, the real skill lies in subcaps
---
This is r/eve right? Hmm I wonder which one... are you lost?
---
I think we could achieve a lot of this less drastically by making supers/titans immune to fax reps, and possibly NSA carriers as well. Maybe remove fax altogether, maybe leave them as one of the main advantages battleships can get over dreads/carriers. 
---
Standard caps have too few subcap counters, but supercaps have *no counter at all* - in a fight, or in isk efficiency terms. There's effectively one fleetcomp in large sovwars/big fights, and it's a really aids comp to ship people into, and too expensive to welp &amp; replace. 
---
music is terrible and looks like you got carried by batphones according to BR
---
you forgot "today"
---
God damn it.....GOD FUCKING DAMN IT.... why didn't we stop this?
---
Here for the missile guidance.
---
Needs an update, hahaha.
---
But if you ungroup the gun things there’s several blinkies!
---
&gt; it's kind of retarded to drop caps against anyone who's capable of bringing a greater super mass than you
---
I feel like this deserves more attention, but pair it with this point:
---
**it's also really shit idea to commit your own supers unless you outnumber the other team so bad they'll immediately evac** (which also guarantees no fights)
---
Null alliances are so heavily tied to their supercap fleets that they can't afford to risk them doing anything fun or interesting. If you welp your titan blob, you're pretty much out of the null game; maybe for 6-12 months to rebuild, maybe *forever* if you get evicted while you can't defend yourself. 
---
So don't bother showing up unless you can show so big that the other side won't bother showing up. Or just bring a ceptor gang and warp off at the first sign of defenders. 
---
PGL fleets are truly something, in a good way. I would follow that man into a WW1 trench, rather than any other FC, ever.
---
I mean it looks way cooler on video s over the shitty kin dd.
---
We get it you live in your moms basement now go away 
---
If we add the fact that Sion felt the need to brag about the event AND Falcon felt the need to attack me when I started to evict Goons, I think the second explanation is more likely.
---
Oh, and Obama intentionally created ISIS, as evidenced by their surprisingly fast collapse after he left office.
---
Hull pen isn't with us nor did they have any clue about this timer. Was a timer to get a good fight out of a group similar to our size but alas, this is the current Eve - There are no guudfights
---
I was asleep, but good to know that somehow I can get salt from yet another person I've never talked to in this game. Thank you. 
---
Hulks have highest yield, you are thinking of mackinaws
---
Ran four accounts until 2015 or so. I was always more economically oriented. Some of the big eco mechanic shifts lost me my profit engines and my interest in the game. Was the last of my friends to un-sub. Now I just enjoy sitting in the corner watching. Eve is a pretty solid spectator sport. ATs are the last of the eve things that bring me back to the old binges. Maybe some day my submarines will come back to me.
---
Holy Moses on a hot plate that would be a relief. Sadly she has no basement and is damn near dead. And based on my brothers gaming addiction probably stoked she was too old for even pong.
---
huh
---
&gt; decided to be a stay at home dad 
---
XXI century is weird 
---
TNT lol.
---
As someone who has only been in starter corps since I started (and talks too much in them), I probably can give one of the better "impressions" of the first noobs that join.  I can say that the rate I see new faces in state war academy ask about caracals and fits has maintained the same.  They get interested in about everything, but the one larger change is that there has definitely been more and more chinese players come through the corp chat.  I have logs of SWA going back for a while, and thats probably the "largest" type of player change.
---
From a new player experience, it has never been better.  There are lots of good guides I can link new players, along with fits thanks to the community.  Also there are other people in the starter corp that go out and help (rescue) some of the new players sometimes.
---
From the perspectice of SWA's roaming militia that was created in 2010, fits were slowly upgraded from 12 man t1 kestrel gang to hacsNmore by 2016
---
There's plenty of ships flying around Amarr/Minmatar space. I'm part of Biohazard. Winmatar alliance. We are active.
---
I think also a massive part of solo PvP is being able to control an engagement and take range when it starts getting out of hand. In that sense the trig ships are perhaps not the only/best choice since they are  fairly committed to a fight compared to other options, if they do bring friends. 
---
Wait people don't buffer tank anymore?
---
Thanks for the feedback.
---
Hot damn this game makes me sad. I've been playing since 2011 and I think my favorite part about Eve was the journey. 
---
The fact that there was literally minimum time in order to be able to do things because of skills made every milestone exciting. First, destroyer, battleship, T2, T3, etc. It was magical every time. 
---
Skill injectors may have made it easy to catch up. But this game was never meant to have a method to do that, IMO. Implants were one thing, but going from 500,000 SP to 20 million in a day was unfathomable. Now the people who experienced that magic can't relate nearly as often to newbies and it really does feel like this game is no longer for a lot of older players. 
---
The extinction of play styles over the years have been the worst thing to happen to the game as well. It really seems like CCP is making a conscious effort to make empire building the only real activity in the game.
---
I don't know. I've been playing off and on for a very long time. Every time I came back there's always something exciting to get into. This time around it really feels like a lot of non null sec empire players are chronically disappointed. I'll definitely keep trying to play but I have a feeling that I won't be subscribed for that much longer. :(
---
do you have empty space in your ore hold?
---
Where are you anchoring it?
---
What is the corp name?
---
Tried it a few times early on, but only really started playing Eve in about 2008, so on year eleven now. Yesterday I unsubbed all nine accounts. Let's have a little look at where Eve falls short for me now: 
---
1. Story and Setting
---
Eve used to be this amazing sci-fi setting. Not exactly *hard* sci-fi, but human focused, cyberpunky and "realistic" grimdark with a whole lot of interesting politics, faction interaction and philosophies along with the fantastic choice of making the player characters immortal demi-gods and madmen. This sort of thing is kind of important to me, especially in Eve, because let's be frank. The actual gameplay mechanics of Eve are so basic and shit that without all the surrounding stuff it's downright awful. It needs everything else to give the gameplay worth, i.e. the investment into the characters and setting, as well as the player politics, in-game economy and so on. 
---
Sadly, the last good while CCP has let that lie damn near fallow. The early years there were some interesting developments in the politics and status of the empires, but after TonyG wanked all over the setting it never really recovered. In the recent years, CCP has been basically erasing all of TonyG's crap by killing off Jamyl and Heth etc, which most of us took some cheer from but then it turned out they didn't have anything ready to put back in where they'd taken the scythe to the derp.
---
So all we've got now is a stagnant and static New Eden where we're thrown Triglobytes and Derp Jove, obviously directly attached to Carebear Mechanic #402: Electric Grindaloo rather than being interesting additions to the setting and lore. 
---
New Eden's grown stale, dull and boring as a setting and we really don't need more spoopy spess alien precursor weirdo human bullshit. Just advance the story of the empires we have. If the cluster doesn't advance and develop, there's no fucking point in fighting in/for it. 
---
2. We've "solved" Eve. 
---
Let's face it, there's nothing new under the sun anymore. There's a few entities that do fun and interesting things the odd times we get new toys, but for the very most part Eve is "solved" in terms of meta. Sure, balance passes etc will suppress one doctrine in favor of another, but it doesn't tend to take long before the new meta is in place and we all know what's what. Usually, changes just cause FCs to blow the dust off of some older doctrine that now has a new lease on life with maybe minor changes to fit but everyone already knows how it flies and what it does.
---
I don't know how to solve this particular issue, neither by playerbase nor CCP, but it is an issue to me at least. There's no room left for inventive new stuff, or perhaps a bit more accurately: Everyone else are so "good" now that doing stupid shit for fun is suicidal rather than unexpected and potentially actually working. 
---
3. Super Proliferation and Rorquals Online.
---
I keep putting new numbers on this list but Reddit returns them to OneDot for some reason. Anyway, these changes were technically good but had consequences. Sure, now you have to actually work for the moongoo and moon income, but at the same time that means you have to fucking protect that. So players will do what players will do and for all intents and purposes you need the god damn super umbrella or you're simply taking way too big of a risk.
---
So you band together in giant alliances or coalitions, you secure the bear lands, you bear like a motherfucker and you get more ore than you know what to do with and you create more super blobs and more rorquals and so on and so forth. Fail to do this and you're falling behind to such degrees that there's no catching up. Not interested in bearing? You're fucked and consigned to the trash heap of history. Fuck you and your playstyle, this is bearing online and the super umbrellas will blot out the star etc. 
---
So there's  consequences. We massively devalue things like supers/titans and cap through simple inflation. We massively increase the bearing risk and thus massively increase the efforts to safeguard it, which basically kills any content that isn't either a quick gank or massive blueballs unless the stars align enough that the numbers are equal enough that one or both FCs fuck up and actually engage. 
---
4. Developer Philosophy
---
CCP lost their balls. Entirely. Remember HTFU? Remember being proud of the Chaos Theory, the brutal nature of Eve etc? I think they've stopped caring about or loving Eve for what it was or was meant to be, and basically only consider it a job and a moneymaker now. All new story development has to be tied to a new bearing mechanic. Events are no longer Caldari Titans dying by ramming a planet, but are instead copypasted event sites with a Insert Pirate Faction Here paint splattered on it with a shitty new skin in it. 
---
We have fucking log-in "incentives" trying to manipulate people by triggering the same addiction reflex lootboxes exploit, and they've even made their attempts at creating dailies and so on. I take issue with that kind of shit on general principle, because it pisses me off when game devs try to manipulate me. When they make it absolutely clear I'm just a fucking money squirting statistic to them, rather than a consumer of something they lovingly make. It becomes blatantly clear that their one and only priority is squeezing me for money, not being a game dev doing something they love for people who love what they do. 
---
This has only been severely exacerbated with the new owners, as CCP is shotgunning us with blatant and awful attempts at pushing up sub/active player counts with short-sighted desperate moves, in altogether too clear attempts at gargling Korean Bonus Dick. 
---
5. tl;dr/Conclusion/addendums etc.
---
I never stopped loving Eve. It's fucking unique. It's amazing. It's got the most insane player economy in the universe. It's got the most insane battles. It's got the most insane politics and stories. It's got some of the most insane communities - both awful shitty ones and amazingly great ones - and some of the most incredible individuals. It's a singleshard persistent experience unlike any other. 
---
And I'm unsubbing all my accounts from it, because it *hurts* to watch it go down the drain. The setting is stagnated and shit. The playerbase is getting more and more toxic and so am I. The gameplay isn't evolving much and is more and more heavily dependent on hardcore bearing which I just fucking hate. 
---
I love this game. I think it can still be the most amazing game out there and CCP could very easily make it even greater than it ever was before. 
---
... it just isn't. Not now. The world stopped living and breathing and the players stopped making up for it with their own stories and development. 
---
It's never been as good as it is now mechanically, but let's face it... Eve's mechanics has never been more than utterly mediocre and that's not enough on its own. We need all the other shit around it, and CCP has to do their part in keeping that world alive. 
---
... well that or just cater to the whales and bears, in the hopes for more Korean Bonus Dick to gargle. 
---
super carriers can be countered, its titans that are the problem. Cant TD the guns, cant damp the locking range, cant jam them... 
---
ASP is hilarious when people are retarded and not following orders... "Put your brain between your ears... Insert brain into head!"
---
Otherwise most fcs are calm and chill

Because no one can evict goons.

---
Why do people often sell BPC contracts with the BPCs put in a container?
---
Other than ashbrittle, name another wh corp that did that
---
They are bigger than hk retard
---
Yep, that would be cancer.  What about a scriptable way to send one ship somewhere 100km with something like 12km range?
---
Fozzie has been actively running the game into the ground for a few years now so it’s basically shit at this point. 
---
Started in 05, game probably climaxed around 2011-2013ish then just has been sliding down into the dumpster fire it is now. All major problems are instead just “hopefully this new stupid bullshit makes them forget”
---
There’s way too much isk, groups have gotten way too goddamn big, capitals have finally hit the point where there’s no turning back, rorqual change was a disaster, supers and titans - lmao at this point really. That’s what you get when you base your strength of a ship on the value, then remove said value (rorquals tho xd!!!) And injectors oh my god honestly why, and then to just fuck all the vets over by making it so they are trash to use on old characters too, who the fuck wanted a catchup mechanic in eve??? At best make it cut off at 5m sp and can’t inject anymore like goddamn 
---
The AT is a joke of a competition now unless all the bullshit rules are reverted before next season.
---
Really what’s the point anymore besides it being something that we’ve done for (x) years and something else hasn’t filled that niche market slot yet. That said it’s just a matter of time til something does, so eh.
---
Hed isn't mad, he's just disappointed.

Blue spy alt following a super as it is ratting. Once the super warps to the next site and is offgrid, the spy character lights a covert cyno in the previous site. Max tackle fit stratii are bridged to the covert cyno and fleet warpped by the the spy to the site the super is in warp to. 
---
Ok I'll bite.
---
Objectively bad. Significantly worse than it was. Citadels, rorquals, and injectors, fundamentally crippled everything that made this game special, and have not replaced it with anything healthy.
---
Citadels made sov irrelevant and megacoalitions more rewarding than carving an empire through blood sweat and tears.
---
Rorquals made the economy irrelevant. Ships are free. Supers are cheap. Titans are affordable to any idiot with a pulse. Everything is worthless.
---
Injectors made sp irrelevant. The concept had been suggested pretty much at least once per month since I started in 2005. Every time it resulted in autistic screeching. So CCP ignored 13+ years worth of people screaming about how bad of an idea this was, and shockingly, it turned out to be a bad idea.
---
And these are just the big 3. Moons, jump fatigue, damage caps as a concept, ship to ship imbalances, module imbalances, the list is very very long at this point, and every day we dig a little deeper and lose a little bit more of what made it special.
---
But most of all I feel bad for every new player who joins eve from now forward, because they will never experience what eve was truly about. The slow burn, meticulous, cunning gameplay. The satisfaction at the end of the grind, or con, or heist, or whatever you could dream up. The desperation from losing it all, even because of because of one simple mistake. The determination to do it again, better, faster, with more experience, the kind that isn't measured on a bar. Now, it doesn't matter. You can go from vni to carrier to titan in months, or less, and lose them, and it doesn't matter. What's the point then? Let's be real, there's much better games out there for this kind of play. This isn't cod. I just don't understand what changed in CCP, to make these sorts of changes. Maybe they didn't realize? Didn't care? I don't know.
---
LOL  But yeah, this is one of the major problems. It would be nearly impossible to differentiate with code when bumping is intended as a PvP action and when it isn't. It's one of those many mysterious things (like facial recognition) that humans can recognize instantly but would be impossible to code.
---
The Kikimora is not OP in my opinion. I’ve flown the ship extensively since it was released in a few different set ups and I’ve got a ton of kills with it.
---
The reason is that the tank is complete garbage while having a large sig. literally any t1 cruiser with more than 20km range will easily force you off. Ships with good speed and projection like retris (especially if they have an adc) will toast you and because they’re faster you can’t even get away.
---
It’s outranged significantly by sniper ships in a similar class like the Fessor (70km) and the cormorant (100km) while also being insanely expensive in comparison.
---
Honestly it’s basically a pirate destroyer that has insane range and damage, but all the same tank issues faced by t1 destroyers.
---
Now the Drekavac is a whole different story..
---
PGL is national treasure
---
Sweet SKIN.
---
Hi guys, heard about friends getting almost 1bil/hour doing t2 production and reaction. Googled and found a bunch of different guides and other complicated and convulted stuff. I have around 20 skill injectors rn and 10 bil capital. Can someone give me a dummies version of how to. Get into t2 manufacturing? I have only 2 alts for manufactoring
---
very cool and interesting
---
Elo is less loud but more frenetic.  PGL was less loud when he FCed Nulli.  Nulli was also not Test.  Not exactly elite, but generally had their shit together.  
---
I wish Mr. Hyde would come back and make some drekavac videos
---
You will be surprised by the amount if retards we have. 
---
You get what you pay for
---
every dreads are equal you racist
---
Because, for two dreks I can get a carrier.
---
Which is more versatile, cheaper under insurance, has a jump drive, etc 
---
Against a fleet of caps or supers, the trig shit just dies, same as always. Who cares how powerful some expensive subs are when a bunch of supers and fax neuter them? 
---
Eve is not a game, Eve is life.
---
I think the game is moving in a pretty good direction. Making it F2P finally allowed new players to join without investing too much, before you can see if it suits you. That alphas caused more botting is plain stupid, as it was always a problem, and most botters are still omegas.
---
Skill injectors caused actually a problem, on the other hand, it allowed new players to rise up and fight at the same level as old ones. Which is inherently good for any game, if there is a "catch-up" mechanic.
---
When it comes to structures, I think the general move was quite good. And that abandoned structures are easier to kill is also fine, (making them more easy to kill would cause other problems.) The asset safety mechanic, is in my opinion okey. However, I would introduce a **small % drop rate/chance from destroyed structures** for the stuff that is sent into asset safety. So there is more incentive to kill structures, and more incentive to keep the stuff in these structures to a minimum.  
---
If a keepstar of a block is killed, even a 1% drop chance (could also be a payout from the asset safety fee), we immediately talk about a few billions of assets that drop. That should add enough incentive, without crippling the financial capability of the loser.
---
Making wardeccs limited to structure owning corps/alliance is imho one of the most important changes the game has seen. Wardeccs caused me to got lowsec/nullsec or stop playing, I survived the transition, because I already played a while, but my of my friends left. Forcing this choice on player is simply stupid and probably cost eve thousands of players over the years. (8/10 of my highsec corp left eve because of perma wardeccs, pretty sure at least a few more would have stayed)
---
Honestly when it comes right down to it number of blinky gun things is incredibly important. Everyone now has to fly wyverns. 
---
Very good point and definitely something I did not consider. However, this does not address my main problem with the Triglavian ships: They have no relative weakness. They have good speed, damage, tank, utility, range, tracking and even drones. And its not a sort of jack-of-all-trades master of none situation, they are comparable to all but the extremes for their class. Their effectiveness in a 1v1 translates directly into strengths in almost any role and for the purpose of solo pvp you would almost always be at some disadvantage vs a Drekavac. Brawling in particular has a far more limited skillset where the Triglavians roles can overshadow its competition. In your example, even assuming the same basic fits, the second Drekavac can hold beyond point range at 12+Km as soon as the first is held down, buying time for the BNIs burning into range, akin to a Harbinger trying to scram kite or hit with scorch before going point blank. Any ship trying this against the Drekavacs would be hard pressed to do solid damage at a comparable range, and the few that could would have to tank against equivalent damage as soon as the Dreks swapped. There is no solid counterplay, especially for someone trying to take one on alone. Even in your example, the more complex the situation becomes the Dreks only get stronger considering options like 3 small neuts each, drone capacity, links, and a larger benefit from overheating weapons.
---
WH Space is a lot of lonely. It's basically a private little ground that anyone might come poke you, but depending on where you are, it's unlikely. If you like the grind, then WH space has oodles of cash for you. If you like being lonely and rich, or chasing folks to beat them with a stick, then it's for you.
---
Has Planetary Interaction's P0 spawn rates ever been investigated or discussed by players? I'm curious if anyone wants to talk about or share info on what they know about these mechanics. What are set levels of P0 availability on a planet, and how to these react to player extraction, player density, etc. 
---
Its load it will fire soon™.
---
They can be used for pvp. Heres my favourite bhaalgorn pvp vid: https://youtu.be/hPvXopK0hj0 
---
He has his fit in comments. However judging by your questions I'm guessing you're pretty new to pvp. In that case it might be better to get more experience in smaller ships first to try get the hang of it.
---
"Our" -- Implying there is anything left of CODE that could even remotely be defied as functional enforcement in 2019. But that's what happens when a movement started on the base ethos of the game abandoned by the very people who created the game. 
---
When it comes down to it CCP was on the wire a few years ago and getting more paying bodies in the server meant they had to actually read all those email suggestions they had been harvesting for years and look at the countless thousands complaining about a lack of PvE content and empire sec / solo activities.
---
[It's just good business.](https://i.imgur.com/s3key5a.gif)
---
Indeed ! I’ve been a fan of the squishy frigates, even if I wasn’t in PVP for too long. So I guess I’ll start with cruisers ! Since most of my skills are in Shield and Hybrid turrets, would a Moa be a good choice ? 
---
Thanks in advance :)
---
Sorry, people won't answer you beyond "buy low sell high" and "learn spreadsheet fu", because every other manufacturer is a competitor.
---
So am I.
---
Oh I see
---
Why did they keep jumping in dreads after it was obvious that this was a trap?
---
''shoot dreads A to Z''
---
basically shoots whatever he likes.. oh horde..
---
T1 cruisers are not a good class for finding solo fights or learning.
---
Comparing a kiki to a corm is like comparing a Caracel to a Tengu. A corm is 3mil isk. You're going to spend a bil in skill books before you can even think about sitting in a kiki, and maybe another 300m on the low end for a fit. Plus you're investing in skills that are useful for only one ship. Of course it's stronger, and it should be.
---
The first thing you do when joining test comms is mute PGL so v0v
---
Those are our normal cap comms tbh
---
Dang...
---
What would be a good class for that then ? 
---
Shooting poco drones leave for distant space and are not on grid anymore.
---
TEST used hundreds of dreads in UALX at 0 on the North/East super blob, but they didn't really do anything useful. They were just soaking damage from titan guns while the titans traded doomsdays.
---
I'm pretty sure more isk dies in the abyss than comes out of it. Isogen and Zerop isn't that plentiful and it takes a lot of time to farm enough of it for one ship. Ammo is also quite painful to produce in any appreciable amount.
---
I'm not sure if I count as a veteran (played since early-mid 2015) but fuck it here goes.
---
Skill Injectors was the worst idea CCP ever had, capital spam, rorqual crabbing and all the other (mostly nullsec related) things we all complain about today would not be nearly as bad if skill injectors were never a thing. The worst part if CCP could remove them tommorow but the damage is already done and at this point is irreversible.
---
Solo is dead and small gang is more or less dying. Lowsec and faction warfare need to be given some special attention so they can be revived.  
---
I'm pretty sure more isk dies in the abyss than comes out of it. Isogen and Zerop isn't that plentiful and it takes a lot of time to farm enough of it for one ship. Ammo is also quite painful to produce in any appreciable amount, and the turret takes quite a lot of material to produce as well.
---
Frigates and destroyers are good fun. Easy to find fights in FW space as well.
---
No; old feature.
---
Caps nullifying subcaps mainly. Something environmental to force subcaps like a large dense asteroid field that only cruisers and smaller can for throughout something like fw gates.
---
Mmh... The problem I have with frigates is that I feel like their health will be gone in less than five seconds, even with repair modules running.
---
Sadly I’m quite far from FW space, I live in nullsec =/
---
Losing fights is a lot more tolerable when it doesn't lead to us getting evicted
---
Hello.
---
You find other frigates to fight. The whole t1 frigate meta is quite evenly balanced atm yes the fights are quick but they last more than 5 seconds lol. I recommend searching YouTube for suitonia's "eve is easy" series and learn a bit from there
---
Normally in frigates you're fighting other frigates and destroyers, so the fights last long enough that you have to do a bit of thinking.
---
Jump clone?
---
Yeah, I could always use a Jump Clone. Is there a ship I could use to catch oblivious VNIs in nullsec ?
---
Are you a fucking retard or just bored? 
---
Out of curiosity, in what setting do you fly it in? Its damage on cruisers and larger ships is not particularly impressive but I imagine it to just completely eliminate a hostile gangs small tackle during a mid size fleet fight. The sort of ship that if ignored for the smallest amount of time will be able to pick something off and is too risky to pin down unless it gets itself caught. I can see how it could be killed, but I think the combination of range and tracking is just too strong compared to any other ship in *any* class to be balanced. The Confessor and Corm you mention cant even come close to the Kiki in tracking and damage, let alone simultaneously.
---
bait dreads for anchoring fort...?
---
I think that out of everything mentioned the tracking of triglavian ships is completely ridiculous and out of proportion. Having dreks with the double of the tracking of a Nomen, Leshaks tracking like medium rails and Kiki not needing any kind of control to apply to anything is really dumb and kills possible interesting counterplay. You can’t even td those ships because they are so fast that they have always the option of ramming the target and applying with no issues.
---
Which ores did you target? What are your skills?
---
-&gt; Can mining drone I's even mine the m3 required for one piece if ore? 
---
No it doesn’t. Trig ships can just ram to compensate for the range since they are faster than their counterparts and angular tracking is not an issue because they have double the tracking of their counterparts as base.
---
I wanted to watch this but had to 1. Turn my volume down. 2. Skip forward hoping for a different song 3. Skip forward again 4. Close the video
---
My oldest character is over 13 years old and I would say that the game is "ok". It must be doing something right for it still to be here. My one observation however is that the population tends to be concentrated in certain areas and others seem peculiarly devoid of life. I can't get too concerned over mechanics changes like others in this thread as the one thing you can depend on here is that the goalposts are constantly fiddled with by CCP and I don't have a problem with that as it makes you constantly reconsider things and not get bored once you happen upon "the one true way".
---
So what ? Your point being ? 
---
The Bhaalgorn is a decent solo-PvP ship. What it lacks in damage and tank it makes up in control. The Bhaalgorn is the ultimate 'stay the fuck away' ship, with heavy neuts and long range webs applying extreme pressure against tackle or active tanked ships. It struggles with relatively low damage for a battleship, as well as a low lock-speed negating some of its strength against small ships. You are also fairly vulnerable if someone can point you from outside of neut range, as you'll be wanting to rock Pulse lasers if you want turrets, and the full neut fit isn't good for solo PvP.  
---
The Bhaal is a ship I wouldn't recommend for solo PvP, but combined with wormholes and a small gang the Bhaalgorn can be the nastiest subcap in game. It can threaten caps, play incredibly stupid wormhole/station games, and can decimate the ability of any subcap to function within 40km. It generally requires logi and dps support - guardians, brutix NI, drekavacs and other faster armor ships work well with it.
---
2008 player here. The game is dead. Skill injections have allowed me to reach all my goals in the game. The bugginess of the last event was a major red flag for me. Haven't logged in since Xmas and have no desire to return. Low sec is dead and not infested. Yawn...
---
How? I once tried to fly to null sec and I got webbed, scrambled and blown up seconds after jumping at the gate
---
And no, autopilot was off
---
I really like at 1:39 when Rahan Takaa jumps into a large group of dreads when only 1 or 2 allied dreads is left.
---
A single tracking disrupt with a 60% penalty still gives it better range than a blasterboat, and would have as much effect as it does against any other close range weapon platform in tracking.
---
The kiki is not quite sqishy enough to be one shot, and it can hit beyond the lock range of a cynabal. Im not saying its invulnerable, but if flown well it can easily kill (or scare off) any frigate with 50k, giving it far more presence on a battlefield than any destroyer has the right to have.
---
The Drek is arguably less vulnerable than any other cap-reliant BC and has as much room for cap boosters and nosferatus as any other ship. A curse or geddon will fuck it as it would literally any other solo ship, but that is the logic that gave us capitals online.
---
You need to do something with those eyes of yours since you can not see forest from the trees.
---
Let me explain.
---
This event happened in dronelands back in 2017. Those times during a roam you passed approximately 50 nerds doing ratting in any given day. I am going to be generous here and say that only ten of those ratters used some kind of program to aid them with this task.
---
I had done my fair share of tickets during my days and it took me around 5min to make one properly.
---
So in your eyes I am a horrible person who ruins your game since I did not spend every day 50minutes of my game time for ticket punching? Is this legit expectation of yours to every player?
---
I have to say that EVE of the day is horrible and have no hope if it is populated with people having same kind of crooked logic that you have.
---
&gt; they are already evicting smaller entities again
---
Jesus you are dumb
---
Maybe make supers cost an upkeep fee? 100m/week per super and maybe 500m per Titan?
---
Or let it scale with the total amount of supers an entity has?
---
That also might encourage people to be less risk averse.
---
Another idea I had in the past is some form of ship collision so that players in a fleet would not f1 monkey but have to pilot on their own and have to make own decisions. I don't say that because only because I want to pick off the bad players of the blobs. I strongly believe that fleet fights would be way more fun this way even for the nullsec alliance linemember once he got used to pilot their ship manually and have to think for themself. Also having 200 cerberus clipped into each other just looks retarded as fuck. 
---
Damn, you just described my feelings. I try to sell all my toons except main and just fly frigs in low sec for fun sometimes 
---
in delve you don't need blue eyes tbh
---
Well unlike the other dude you got a comment from I don't really play anymore so sure. I don't know about the 1 bil an hour claim unless you had some serious capital and alts though. It's also a weird activity to measure by isk/hour as a lot of it is extremely passive. With 2 and a half characters doing it I was making about 4-5 billion in high sec and I was generally logging in for about a half hour a day to do that.
---
I'm not sure how dumbed down you need here but there are a few big things:
---
- Deciding what to make: Eve Isk Per Hour (https://eveiph.github.io/) is going to be the most valuable tool you can possibly get. You can filter down by sell rate, profits, item type. You can import prices from the API or set your own prices if you can get cheaper materials. It's amazing and how I found all my niche items I make. 
---
Keep in mind of price spikes when researching items and pay attention to sell rate. Yes capital armor plates might show up as the most profitable thing in the game to make at some point. But they are not worth making as they will never sell and are a massive pain in the ass to move. Alternatively also stay away from things like ammo, yes the sell through rate is amazing but you can make it at a far faster rate than you can ever sell it.
---
- Where to make your stuff: I build all my stuff on alts in high sec. It's probably not the most profitable way to do it but it was easy, I don't own a jump freighter or have a pilot that can fly one (besides my super pilot) and I wanted it to be easy to find materials and sell my stuff. Null sec might be more you're thing but make sure you have access to all the stuff you need or figure out how you're going to get it. Make sure you're able to have a steady flow of materials coming in (which you can do with your capital) so you prevent downtime with your production slots. Take into account shipping/fuel costs when deciding on profitability and location.
---
- Once you get better at it and more comfortable with what you're doing make sure you're taking slot efficiency into account. Don't just look at overall profit of an item but how many slot hours that item is taking up. It's for this reason I didn't make t2 ships really at all.
---
- Look into capital modules and capital t2 modules. This was my niche when I was playing more.
---
- When possible try to have a researched BPO and an un-researched BPO of each thing you're producing. The researched one is for making the T1 item required for the T2 and the un-researched is for copying into BPCs for invention runs.
---
I can't think of much more off the top of my head right now. If you have any more specific questions ask away.
---
 Then Securitas has come a long way since I last was on his fleets over a year ago. Figured he died from throat cancer from yelling at literally everyone and we haven't even undocked yet. 
---
:(
---
I love that guy's name. Still with the Church of Appliantology, Elron? Or have you gone full Amarr?
---
Wow thank you for such a detailed reply!! I think I understand the gist of it. However now the problem is that idk which skills to train. Obviously the manufacturing ones but which of the science skills should I train? There's seems to be tons of science skills. Is there a point to train the science skills to lv5 ?
---
The Kiki vs Corm comparison is to show the relation between the Kiki and ships in the long range role I mentioned. If you compare it with a sniper fit Beam Fessor or LML Jackdaw the damage numbers come a lot closer but the Kiki still has the insane projection ability that no ship in the game can match. I started the post off mentioning that the only reason these ships are not so common is because of their price, but with that steadily dropping and the decreasing demand of skillbooks eventually there is going to be nothing holding it back from being the only ranged destroyer to use.
---
Makes it easier to sort them into batches. Especially if their selling BPC sets like an Obelisk set or a Thanatos set. It will (or is supposed to) have all the required BPCs to make that ship and they are usually making up dozens of those sets at a time so they have an easier time sorting them out that way.
---
Nine accounts? Wow! And here I am flying about, doing all my stuff on a single character.
---
Don't be a risk adverse retard and try be someone outside of the biggest entity in the game then? 
---
Rude 
---
The capital meta and the nano meta that counters it have really hurt the slower buffer fits, although it can still be strong in the right situation. Fleets obviously still buffer fit exclusively. 
---
2005 player here. It's in the dumpster and on fire in respect to nullsec. N+1 was too difficult for CCp to solve, as was the super proliferation, so they went the other way and enabled everyone with the ability to a super/Titan. Citadels are another cluster fuck. 
---
If you want solo, safe PVE content, EVE is great. If you want to sit in a  super safe null sec bloc, under a Titan umbrella and make more Titans you'll probably never use because an actual bloc war is unlikely due to citadels, it's great. If you want to take part in the massive nullsec wars, you're fucked. There's the occasional, pointless, dick waving and entirely inconsequential fleet battle to be part of. They are usually tidi infested and ultimately boring. You'll finish way after the time you needed to get to bed and you'll be left feeling drained and asking what's the point, but you'll be able to post about it.
---
I trained all of them to III at first and then the ones I used most commonly to IV later. If you train them all you'll be able to invent and produce basically anything T2 if you have the other required skills for it. Just allows some more flexibility. Each level you train those skills will up your invention chance slightly. 
---
Aight tysm!
---
My opinion is that it has developed in some horrible directions and I will be leaving very soon. My main sub expires on March 1st, but I'm not sure I will be logging in for any actual play except to move my assets and sell off stuff, buy plex etc. and mothball my accounts just in case I decide to ever return down the line.
---
I have played Eve several times. 2003-2004 left cause it was just too undeveloped for me back then, 2008-2010, left due to RL time constraints and being unable to do what I want to do in the game, 2012-2015, left due to the beginning of mass multiboxing / botting meta and status quo. It was always in the game, but nothing anywhere on the scale that started at the end of 2014, Dec. 2016 to present, I'm leaving due to multiple reasons which I will list below:
---
Multiboxing / botting meta - nothing improved, nothing done, things got progressively worse and are continuing to get worse at a rather alarming rate.
---
Cap proliferation / botting and multiboxing  proliferation - the 2 go hand in hand as 1 feeds the other and continue on an ever increasing spiral.
---
When I came back in 2016 I decided to do the small and chill stuff. Small side of PvP, some explo / WH diving, set up my main account in HS and actually did the old and new PvE content I have not done before, it was kinda nice. the injectors helped me a lot to strip my old miner toons and pump the SP into combat oriented characters, and this was good.
---
So I did the PvE, Abyss, trained and tried Precursor ships (they are a lot of fun), but I see the game heading in a very wrong and opposite direction for me. Virtually nothing being done about the multiboxing / botting NS meta. The new PvE content is turning more and more into mining, thus super boring and just not for me. Only things I enjoyed is the new precursor ships and Abyss, but those alone are not enough to hold me here with a sub in light of other games available, so I have been playing other stuff.
---
The small side of PvP is nearly completely dead, just not enough of it left, both my PvP accounts are collecting dust for a few months now, I haven't even logged them in since they're PvP, so no assets worth crap on them anyways, everything is disposable.
---
I might come back again if the botting, multiboxing, cap proliferation quagmire ever gets addressed, doesn't have to be solved, it can't be, but just be at manageble levels unlike now. Or I might come back if there is enough fun combat oriented content, not fucking mining in events etc., that is completely independent of NS and is unaffected / unhindered by any multiboxing or botting. 
---
So to me, the current state of the game: NS - overran with bots multiboxers and other of this sort of shit, WHs - not really worth it and too much of a PITA with constant d-scan and scanning for everything everywhere at all times, HS - not enough decent combat oriented PvE content to keep me going and the new content coming in deviates from combat going into mining, thus a very negative direction which ruins what is good.
---
No worries.

Thanks

The age old question of make it so a Titan needs a support fleet, not just a fleet or titans + fax with tons of throw away tackle.

you'd look a lot smarter using words like "absurdity" if you spelled them correctly

Focused damage bombs with no aoe and big damage is something ccp promised ages ago. But ofc it will come soon^tm

The availability of the base ressource on a planet is dependant of multiple things, most of which ar exterior factors to the planet itself. As with mining, one of the directive one is the security status of the system you’re in : the lower it is, the richer the planet P0 ressources will be. This page give you a little idea of the ressources found in highsec, compared to lowsec, and nullsec : https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Good_Planets
---
Concerning capsuleer occupation and extraction on a given planet, you can actually see other players’ facilities by right clicking somewhere on the planet and clicking on "Show other players facilities" (I think it’s the name of the command, or at least something like this). If a lot of players are on the same planet, the ressources will deplete way faster than if a single player would be alone on it. Also, if you set your extractors near another players’ ones, the ressource you are set on will be gone faster.
---
One last link : https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Planetary_Commodities.
---
Here, you’ll see every P0 ressource and to what they can be further processed, alongside P1 to P4.
---
Have fun !
---
ECM is not as hard a counter as people make it out to be. The base damage on these ships is not pathetic; the starting gun damage on a Drek is 485, which does not sound like a lot until you compare it to a HNI which starts and ends the fight at 610. As mentioned above the Kiki at 50k beats a Cormorant in raw dps after 2 cycles, only 4 seconds total. A jam may buy time but it will not turn the tide, particularly in a fleet fight.
---
Did I see the neutral nestors just do a fly by in the middle of all that?
---
I never FC'd ever but saw that and thought, ooh primary them guys!
---
Haha looked fun
---
Reason? 
---
yeah i don't think anyone ever implied kb is toxic, like the other guy said he just laid down on the tracks of the meme train
---
Years for svipul nerf and that's even before balance has gone apeshit.
---
Oï !
---
As much as I’ve never sat in a capital ship, I’d say that Burst Projectors, at least the one dedicated to interdiction probes, are not used that much. It take an highslot, which could be used for a Fighter Support Unit, or anything else.
---
Maybe on carriers dedicated to defang the other ones, but generally, any big fleet employing super capitals will either have Interdictor, which are way nimbler and harder to catch for bigger ships, or HIC, which use their excellent resilience to survive long enough for the remote repairs to land.
---
Hope this help !

This is very old and only happens very rarely.

What happened is that the edge of the grid you are in is very close to your target.
---
Your drones, while orbiting the target, crossed into the other grid. To retrieve them you have to go onto the same grid as your drones and then recall them again.
---
Playing since 2015, and I realize I'm still a noob compared to much more oldschool guys who post here. But here are my very subjective feelings so far:
---
\- free to play was both a good and a bad move at the same time: while it seemingly attracted more players, it has become a breeding ground for botters with an unprecedented scale;
---
\- Chinese influx: I'm not a racist and believe that all people and nations are equal, and all cultures on Earth are great and valuable. But it's pretty clear that some of them (people and cultures alike) are simply *incompatible* with each other, and one will expel and suppress another when they are trying to co-exist.
---
\- Abyss: new ships aren't quite bad and should be nerfed a little bit to be on-par with all others; mutaplasmids did not change much in meta, but I'd remove this hipster shit from the game, abyssal arena is ridiculous and looks it is not worth those hours spent for its coding.
---
So, like [CoffeeAndCigars](https://www.reddit.com/user/CoffeeAndCigars) said above,
---
&gt;CCP is shotgunning us with blatant and awful attempts at pushing up sub/active player counts with short-sighted desperate moves 
---
TL;DR: previous speaker was right, make rigs for triglavian guns and ban VPN.
---
I always find it amusing that these shios get everything, but then also get a big drone bay smacked on top.
---
Imo they could do without drones. 
---
Thanks !

Original Beta player here:
---
Supers are cancer.
---
Buying game time with ISK is cancer, not killing off the bots after allowing buying gametime with ISK is DOUBLE CANCER.
---
PVE is cancer. Seriously its incredibly unfulfilling.  The fact that it's best done with a TV show going on a second monitor tells you that.
---
Short-term PVP is non-existent. Militia wars were supposed to fix that and have been broken since inception.
---
Its mostly #3 and #4 that has kept me from coming back. I want to be able to login for less than an hour and have fun. I can't.
---
I think you are a retard. Jelly fish.
---
Concord cannot be defeated.
---
Need more Content Driver.
---
That simple.
---
Btw, you have one specific where your streamers go all the time for content, starts with a F, don't forget it.
---
When utility on DPS ships becomes irrelevant, certainly. But in smaller numbers where the battleship needs to be within 30k and is hitting targets of all sizes, the Nightmares squishy nature, cap instability and poor (relative) dps and the Rattles pathetic speed, low utility and delayed drone reliant DPS make the Leshak a far better choice for almost any smaller gang. If we assume a brawl with other battleships involved the nightmare becomes nothing but an expensive loss and the Rattle is reduced to "generic DPS".
---
Cute
---
Venture, the ORE frig.
---
who the actual fuck are you
---
TIL fweddit be comin back
---
Remove asset safety.
---
Remover reinforcement timer for low power structures.
---
Remove panic modules.
---
Make caps have a spool up/lock on time for cynos.
---
= hopefully a few isk sinks, less safe 200m hour isk generation, clear a few citadels from space so eve doesn't eventually look like a city centre (fw benefits a tiny bit from that),
---
Then CCP could go back and revisit resource wars and take another look at pve in general (like it or not it's a part of the game). There's some good AI for the diamond rats and the abyss has shown that rats can use drones so how about combining the 2 for battleship burner missions or something. Passive moon mining was taken away to reduce passive isk generation and yet everyone knows what VNI ratting and rorqual mining are. Focus on 'background' stuff for a while I.e. not PvP focused balance passes or revisits.
---
Been playing over 10 years still in starter Corp but with presence in null. Sov is to secure new groups can't do shit without having to join one of the big alliances or a coalition. Supers are to prevalent even I a starter corp main have one. Realistically cap fights are meh for example we have dropped on init killed a few dreads but had a cramp ton of supers including a bunch(ok 2 or 3 I'm to lazy to look at the closes lol) of titans show up.
---
 True it was in their space but supers get dropped everywhere else as well lol. Carriers and super carriers aren't a massive deal can be countered by just bringing sub caps and keeping some range will die a lot but defanging them by killing fighters is doable.  Now for the bane of anything small group or even semi big sub cap......haw guns on dreads ive used them myself their fun but for the games health they need to be removed or make worse as it stands someone can drop a few dreads on a smaller groups stuff and shit stomp it use to be a sub cap fleet was a counter now just add a few haw dreads and no fear jve seen them trash interceptors so even small signs ships can and do die insanely fast. 
---
Also on the list the I guess lance did titans have some on ccp they had aoe then you removed it and made it targeted then made it cap only ie couldn't shoot sub caps now you gave them a directed aoe again lol
---
Also please make dice bubbles cause aggression on launch 1 dice shouldn't be able to lock down a gate on both sides more so as it is agression there is not a single model in this game  more  pvp( I've been bored in the past and bubbles rats in belts they still warp(belt rats warp around at times if left alone(yea nested () in a nested () cool lol))out of the bubbles) focused then bubbles.
---
You pretty much summed it up for me. I used to throw a lot of money at CCP, some may go so far and call me a "whale" but I did so because I was fully behind CCP and New Eden was a place I spent pretty much all my freetime in. So it didn´t feel wrong to throw money at the game. I mean, I was supporting some people who made something awesome and since EvE became a hobby it was money well spent. Then came the cut throat that CCP called consolidation. That was something that irrititated me. Followed by the whole ingame inflation, low-sec not getting "fixed", super prolif and so on made me cancelling my yearly subs. 
---
Fukin epic comment. Got em
---
I remember when you would scream. Just lost 3 atrons you yelled at us in tener. ;_; ninja and greg let the abuse continue
---
Delve is a special place. How you lose a super/rorq under the games largest Super Umbrella - no matter what time of day - is beyond comprehension 
---
No
---
The game can be fixed, it's CCP that's changed. From where I'm sitting I see no vision or passion for the game, no real direction anymore and most of all no balls to do anything to rock the boat. Attempts to tackle real problems are always like "we're going to make this tiny adjustment that has no impact at all and then revisit this in 12-24 months maybe". Working a dead end job living paycheck to paycheck, that's the impression I get. 
---
The company has been through a lot the last 2 years. Layoffs, people quitting, the takeover by Pearl Abyss. It's about time CCP released a public vision statement or whatever you want to call it for the game. Not an update roadmap for the next 3 months, a clear vision for what this game should be. The spirit of EVE. The values and principles that are going to guide development going forward. If they can't do that then they've got no hope of tackling the real problems that have quietly been getting worse and worse. 
---
And hey, if their vision is exactly what the game is now that's perfectly fine. It's not a game I'd like to play any longer, but if enough people have fun with it then great, enjoy. I've pulled more than my fair share of fun out of this game since 2003 when I was some teenager flying a Blackbird in giant 50 vs 50 fleet fights. The fact that my memories of this game go back more than **15 years** is a testament to how unique and awesome it is.
---
In fact, no joke, just yesterday I stumbled onto [this video that I made in 2004](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqtoDF3hOSk), 15 fucking years ago. For all its faults, this game is insane and always has been.
---
I am pretty sure that the vast majority of PvP in EvE is against players that do PvE at the time of the engagement, rather than between players that are searching to do PvP. 
---
And who the flying fuck are you?
---
Fozzie Sov killed the fun for me.
---
My two cents is that the biggest part of pvp experience is not the way you fly the ship. It is the knowledge of what fights you can take and how. Meany fights are won before single f1 button has even be pressed.  
---
Frigates are cheap. You can throw those to the wall in regular basis and still not be hurting the bank.  
---
This general experience of fight planing scales up in shiptree.
---
i cant believe you are still baiting someone
---
this actually isn't a bad idea.
---
the cost difference between a marauder and a dread is stupid.
---
There was a point where some supers went low armour. 
---
1.Putin attacks us-we need more allies to kill his farm system in C6 (lol)
---
2.Their army is fragmented and we can defeat them! ~~(no)~~
---
3.A*~~nchored a new faction dick in their c2~~*, Putin has installed new missiles on the coast of Cuba btw. ~~(maybe you have a screen?)~~
---
 ~~and despite kicking 3 people for being spies, you didn't whack the right mole yet~~ (Who ? -tell us) 
---
4.Destroying the system for  farm we  finally kill Outlaws ! ~~(no)~~
---
That is all....

Sell the BPC and use the money to enjoy yourself with smaller ships. All that's going to happen is that you will lose the Bhaalgorn to a blob.

no...just render them useless against subcaps...like used to be...if u want to deploy supers make sure u hold the subcap field

---
I typed the comment on my phone Meowtiger so I apologise for the distress caused. 
---
An upkeep fee is a way of disguising a nothing change as a nerf. It won't do anything to solve the problems and just forces people to do even more krabbing. 
---
The only logical change to supers and titans is to not make them the best at everything. They need a single role to be good at and need to be shit at everything else, like most ships are. And I don't care what it costs, "anti-90%-of-the-ships-in-the-game" is not a valid role for any ship to have. 
---
My thoughts on Trig ships is that the game needs many more of them and they need to be much cheaper then they currently are. Many need T2 versions, especially the frigate, cruiser and battleship. The destroyer and Battlecruiser are actually decent and I have no opinion on the Logi as I haven't seen it used enough to sway in either direction.
---
I disagree with you on several points, 1st off you can still fit a lot of the currently available ships in the game to outperform Trig ships, especially Frig and Cruisers, the fact that you choose not to is 100% on you and other players that make the same choice, for example you can still fit a 1400+ cold DPS active tank Tengu, or a less DPS version ( around 1k DPS) but with 70-80k EHP, that is just off the top of my head.
---
On the Battleship front I think the Leshak is missing a T2 version with even more DPS but much worse application, likewise with Battlecruiser. Hell, I'd like to see a Trig BC that can fit the large weapon system.
---
Overall the game needs much more sub caps that are better capable of taking out caps and supers, not less. So if anything its not that the Trig ships are too OP its that so many other ones need to be brought up, and in fact, once that happens the Trig sub caps need a further buff.
---
Well said. This is exactly how I feel
---
Rorqs have damaged the game. Skill injectors have diminished what it means to have put years of time in. And baring Goons falling apart 0.0 has been won and is a futile waste of time.
---
Fair enough, might remember it incorrectly/interpreted someone memeing to be serious or something.
---
supercarrier != carrier 
---
You just need to know there was a thing called the anime war. That tells you everything about Eve 2018.
---
Got to use and lose my first dread on my dread alt.
---
10/10 would do again.
---
Did you choose mining repeatedly ? 
---
Account is still omega, havnt logged in in about a year
---
yeah lol you fucking neck breather
---
Going close-range vs capitals is scary. So i would say to be the capital killers w/o obsoleting other ships they had to have less tracking rather than less range. 
---
No it wouldn't.
---
Trig ships are way to costly to replace Ferox fleets.
---
Too problematic, requires running clients in VMs or seperate PCs or other types of elaborate eve client sandboxing since Alpha accounts are limited to running only 1 client per machine. 
---
Otherwise I would do exactly that, have freagin 2-3 alpha clones in each of those systems, preferably with some minimal scanning skills sitting  there in T1 explo ships with just the basic T1 cloak and probes launched. But can't do this because I have only 1 gaming rig and using any of the stuff mentioned above is just way too much of a PITA, not worth it, and when I do play, I wanna play my main, not alpha alts.
---
I just did it in my booster charater (with a porpoise and T1 mining drones).  Worked fine on Veldspar.

CAREBEAR/BOTTING ONLINE

I start playing in 2009 and quit after few weeks of missioning in hisec...game didnt atract me at all,being hard to understand ....then a friend of mine told me about pvp and i moved in syndicate....mannnnnnn,belive i got like 3 days sesions  of game play,never had enough of pewpew...back then owning a carrier was a thing so cap supression over subs didnt exist at today scale...small gang pewpew was all over null sec, u didnt need to go 50 j without seeing a single payer willing to pewpew
---
EVE lost hes charm and i found less and less interest to log in...proly minus 3 chars by summer if CCP  dont have the balls to make eve great again
---
I love ya'lls goddamn refusal to have anything but a dark sense of humor.
---
Who wants to keep my 2008 account alive while I'm in grad school? Wait nvm. You'll just loot and destroy it.
---
If taking dirty ISK makes him the same, then you should ban entire leaderships of every single large / mid size NS block along with about half if not most of their players, because they all directly benefit from botting ISK and / or resources.
---
Except void is a sister alliance to bums and we would have been able to take that fleet alone with that amount of cap superiority. But, we believed it to be a trap, and therefore called over some dudes and dropped everything we had fully expecting to lose it, so yeah. I think we did pretty good for ourselves there, thank you very much.
---
This is very conditional. I think nightmare is still the best solo skirmish BS (especially for solo), as leshak is quite easy to stop with ramjags/ceptors and despite all the tank and damage it will be overrun, while nightmare can keep burning and fighting.
---
Rattle has stronger self tank which makes it preferred choice for capital fights where you do not have logi support. Leshak cannot facetank rapid torp phoenix or couple of carriers, while rattle does that easily.
---
But if you add some support then they are worthwhile to bring even in these situations. 
---
I feel like the game has never been better. The sovspace mechanic brought a much more dynamic gameplay in regards to pvp and also in regards to politics. Big and small groups can participate. The new capital mechanics layed out a far more consistent and clear gameplay and brought many new people into cap warfare. The escalation chain is much more reffined. The new structures let people populate very different parts of space, replaced those pesky poses with the horrible fitting mechanic and made new gamestyles available. I could go on and on. So many mechanics are much better today.  
---
I remember during the Rage eviction Goons and INIT calling HK lowballers for SDing their capitals, back then, I said that in the opposite situation, they'd do the exact same thing, turns out I was right again.
---
Moral of the story, if Goons get fun, they are geniuses, if you ruin their fun, you are the cancer killing EVE.
---
Goons are trashbags. 
---
The rorq &gt; skill injector &gt; rorq treadmill may have been accidental but damn if CCP isn't making made IRL isk from it. There are less people playing the game than in 2013 but due to microtransactions CCP is posting record proffits.
---
Just apply to the alliance that currently occupies the space you have your majority of assets in.
---
O. O where is damn shield xlshield booster?
---
&gt; The fact that the ships, modules and skills are as expensive as they are is the only reason they are not dominating certain areas of pvp.
---
The good, bad and ugly. 
---
In the 10 years I have been playing the game, much has changed and somethings has stayed the same. 
---
The good.
---
Sov mechanics aren’t the greatest but better than what we had, resources for players and player groups are plenty. 
---
The bad.
---
The current game mechanics drives players to gather in ever growing alliances and coalitions, which in turn is sapping out content. That is between large wars.
---
The ugly.
---
Although in the beginning citadels and the new structures gave promise. The reality has been ugly, you can go anywhere without seeing low-powered structures. They are too easy to anchor and can be spammed all over the place, and there removal is tedious... and near impossible for small groups with limited time zone coverage. 
---
Due to time zone tanking.
---
Dumb question... What is the minimum amount of plex to add omega game time? I suppose 500
---
A Lesh can't out tank a rattle though
---
My opinion on trig ships:
---
- leshak: super strong but necessary to fight capitals for smaller groups
---
- drekavac: quite good but for smaller groups its utility comes from ability to fit 2-3 links while being useful with damage
---
- kikimora: awesome offensive capabilities but very squishy, like any destroyer. So i think kiki is alright for current overall power level but it is way stronger than other destroyers. It has to be compared to other usable ships like retri, not other destroyers, if you want practical comparison. 
---
- vedmak, damavik, zarmazd, rodiva, tiamat, hydra - all are shit
---
Out of curiosity, what do you miss in pyfa to compare trig logies? 
---
Neuts, td's and higher speed with further projection are all good counters to triglav ships
---
Need to fix cap proliferation first vOv
---
Broken grid maybe?
---
My favorite part is the seamless transition from space to planetary atmosphere.  
---
*homage*
---
Debatable, depending on both fits. It would hit harder and last longer, for certain, but raw EHP/s the rattle will probably rep more.
---
Carriers and Super Carriers can't AFK rat but only officially on paper. In reality there are too few carrier / super pilots that never use macros or script of one sort or another. Of course they will all tell you that its not them, but yea, actually it is them. Its kind of a semi-botting or casual-botting type of thing.
---
I was being a little sarcastic but in all honesty "eh, we tried. "  is not what I would expect for an AAR, even on this subreddit.  What he said above was about what I would have expected.
---
We have one of these threads weekly like wtf
---
&gt; No one responded.. for five days.
---
I'm obviously not completely up-to-date on what is happening with this group, but I've picked up a few things left and right, I'm honestly not too sure about what you expect here, especially when there are just two people in the holding corp that holds the actual structures.
---
I'd say it's pretty sad to leave a group, and then proceed to kick their shit in, and cause people to loose assets :)
---
Their spool up time is a pretty fucking huge weakness. Especially in a solo situation where you have to target change often and get jammed regularly by a random flight of light ECM drones.
---
Which is still better than "eh, we tried."  I am not trying to be overly cynical but a basic modicum of effort would be nice.
---
You're supposed to be blue with the guys who hold sov.
---
We love sec though. He is loud because he likes you.
---
Horde in titans, 2019 is gonna be gud.
---
No super went below half armor, only one nyx was primaried until it became obvious it was going to hold.
---
just what my torpedo said to me when i asked him about the frigate i fired it at 
---
Good day everyone.
---
There is not much time, I will try to briefly tell you the truth.
---
I think there are enough educated people here to understand what is really going on.
---
Let's look closely at the myth that Braxus Deninard created as the leader of HK
---
Myth one.
---
Outlaws. evict small teams. Everyone believes and does not even check what others are saying. Check out our history of evictions and you will understand that maximum power is collected only for large corporations that have friends and the possibility of protection. All small teams are evicted by the same small Outlaws. group.
---
\` Do not listen to what others are saying about specific people looking what they do in reality.
---
The second myth.
---
HK is invulnerable and very strong, complete nonsense, as the INIT have recently proved, and other unsuccessful operations. I personally think that Lazerhawks is much stronger and smarter HK, and I think LZH lear all HK. You understand me if play in EVE much time and know history.
---
The third myth.
---
The Wormhole rules that Braxus Deninard tells and others who believed in this myth and continue to write there and too other people and do not think.
---
Eviction degrades the game in Wormhole. Just stand back and think about the actions of the players destroying the game itself? Only a fool will believe in that. That a sandbox game and any one doing what he what anywhere and no one cant say «hey you doing wrong».
---
What are these myths have led the creators themselves?
---
1.Rage is Down by INIT
---
2.HK Slow start lose position and C6 Farm ( New myth about Wh0re squad. Outlaws. And other for people get enemy.)
---
3. Now 40-60 people will destroy Outlaws. structures in 5-6, it will take them 7 days, the structures were installed 5 days ago, there is nothing there only 5 people and I am the leader of the Outlaws. Bravo! But your problem you not understand nothing and keep going self moving by your myth and believe in that shit. And that really funny for me.
---
4. Now think who evicts small groups? Who creates the myths that fools believe? Who thinks that it will destroy the team, the educated people know what and how the team is built up of people and not the characters in EVE.
---
5. CSM Braxus Deninard knows that I am (Tifida) is a participant and in 2018 is occupied 12th place by the way the first 10 get into CSM and he is afraid and know I am read the HK myths as an open book will be able to change the wormhole space towards freedom, where there will be new bonuses and new classes of systems , new methods of combining wormholes and other things that just lead to the development of this part of EVE, and not to protect the interests of one team.
---
So you may destroy all structure of my alliance but you never destroy Outlaws. Only I am may that doing because created that.
---
Fly safe 0/

Even if so, wingy bits at the back are not an EVE invention.
---
&gt; mall gang pewpew was all over null sec, u didnt need to go 50 j without seeing a single payer willing to pewpew
---
When was this exactly?
---
Eve is dead, it all startet with Fozzy sov after that with every Update it went downhill. there was a time where EVE literally deleted my Boot.ini and still it was 100 times better than now
---
daily.
---
SALTY BORIS TEARS NOM NOM NOM
---
SAID THE DIRTY "WELP VIOLENCE" FEEDER &gt;:(
---
its not dabateable. The rattlesnake tanks drastically more in both buffer and active. Active rattles tank almost double a leshak with 1 shield booster vs 2 large reps translating to an over tripple tank:module efficiency
---
1 way ive found. Kill a person be nice and help them out.
---
 Show these guys what they are missing and just be nice.
---
You could also have a seperate corp to have the new guys in to vet them like that
---
Can't extract below 5mil.
---
Still need game subscription.
---
Stop spreading bullshit.
---
Get your facts straight.
---
Idk what to say. I just allow People in. I hated it myself to be treated like a spy if i just wanted to join a corp or alliance. So i never did it myself we are just friendly open People and everyone is welcome we got the same thing as you a group of corp's in the area we fly with.     Idk i guess People just need to calm their ass down and stop Being so fucking paranoid in Eve.  Be paranoid in real life instead. ( All the camera's watching you 24/7 ) the bank that is controlling every part of your existence etc.   No People worry instead about a stranger in a game that want to join their group   
---
Legacy Fighter code?
---
A rattle is good for Cap kills as you can get some nasty DPS even on a ratting rattle, and you can pull range w/ the thing (120+ km on cruise) wich allows your smaller escort frigs (or drones, geckoes are nasty) to defang the thing or you simply are out of HAW gun range  
---
the delay to damage is a small hit imo, as its a big ship and you dont have to deal w/ it outspeeding your explosion radius or outrunning your missile range
---
This is something i've thought of for a while, is this a legitimate recruitment method? 
---
Why is it logically not invalid when null does it, but it is when wormholers do it?  
---
Only difference is the scale these conflicts tend to happen at.
---
If you take it out to PvP, it will attract a lot of interest, and die fairly quickly - unless you are already a pvp pro. Bhaals can be really handy in WH gangs, if you into that
---
Ya also look at other wh guys and create content with each other but not in the way as destroying everything they own. Skrimish and gf. Eventually youll come across some really hood people. Just try to stay out of the way of the big guys and stay in your little pocket
---
yay, goonCSM has made enough lobbying over the years to turn eve into a giant farming simulator... 
---
dont forget that a Cruise Rattle can outrange a rapid torp haw phoenix (unless the Phoenix is range fit, but even then hes giving up alot of tank for pathetic range on torps)
---
I have only played around with fits a little bit, but as far as I've seen all triglavian ships except the Leshak can be fitted to kite effectively. The shield kikimora in particular is a beast, with the nano vedmak being a nice option too.
---
Yeah this here summed it up for me
---
Come to aridia you can do just that. We are a bunch of corp's and people that are fighting against An alliance there  we roam we destroy structure's  and defend each others structure's we have a attack of defence every few days. Aridia is in Amar space next to lowsec   
---
One pretty big reason is the skills: not everybody has fully trained into them (as they're too busy training more rorq alts and the trainings don't overlap /s) so you don't get to see triglavian ships around that much.
---
your "its dead in 100 seconds" math forgets about resists, if i have my brick tank ~~shield super~~ Drake wich has meh DPS but 120k ehp and 90% resists on Therm/Explo (trig damage) it will take it 1000 seconds, and if i fit a MJD (loosing 20k ehp) i can instantly zoop out of his damage range (unless he short points wich is not very common afaik) and make him loose all of his dps, meanwhile drake can have a ~65km range w/ Heavies and outrange that Drekavik for a while (not sure if its enough time to MJD again, but it extends my lifetime by alot, enough to disengage and fuck off atleast) 
---
Now that were talking about it, is there a way to reboot eve back to 2010-2012???
---
I play for 2 a 3 years off and on but i still like it. But i was done with sov. Feeling like a number. Instead im doing my own thing now with People i met so far and had more Fun in 1 month than in 2 years of nullsec sov led by dictators    but they should more effort to promote the game more 
---
That tangent seems like it hit home a bit haha  
---
It's not paranoia per say, I can't imagine a large eviction fleet would want to evict my and a few guys from our little hole in the ground. (Maybe for shits and giggles), Idealing as @ThinningIce said, after murdering some newbro we get them involved in the corp some how.   
---
\- What do you mean you fly with other corps in the area? 
---
\- More than one corp in the same hole? 
---
What a truly terrible fit.
---
But at least they are in the correct alliance. 
---
*"caps apply too well to subs"*
---
let me stop you right there.
---
I guess you never watched videos from bjornbee or other content creators.
---
https://youtu.be/dMmDHUagnPk
---
https://youtu.be/6TYPi-ZLrsA
---
Capitals turrets still track like shit.
---
A year ago there was a "fighter are too strong" flavour of the month.
---
https://youtu.be/cTMwgFlinuA check this out, I'm on mobile right now and can't set a timecode.
---
Fast forward to 15:55min.
---
If a Wolf can tank a Supercarrier and destroy those heavy Fightersquads solo while being warpdisrupted, I don't consider caps apply too well to subs.
---
There are specific counters to every problem, fighters never got buffed for years now - only nervs to make them more volunerable.
---
Hi, I'm a bot (in Beta). I combined your list of YouTube videos into one shareable highlight reel link:  https://app.hivevideo.io/view/387e06
---
 You can play through the whole highlight reel (with timestamps if they were in the links), or select each video.
---
 Reply with the word ignore and I won't reply to your comments.
---
Your perception of reality is so insanely warped, but we knew that anyway.
---
Mmmmh,.. interesting.... Only the securebank is in the killmail... It's entirely possible that I forgot to activate the invuln. 
---
I did everything wrong, lol.
---
Can you try in other ships and see if you have the same result? 
---
Also make sure you haven't disabled the laser graphic options, that's one way you won't see the lasers.
---
Have you checked the ore hold? Just in case your only looking at the cargohold. It sounds stupid but better to ask and make sure :)
---
Yes. You have LSH a Russian alliance that owns most of aridia  and Then you have us. Several different small and medium corp's that are fighting back togheter  we are making going to make An alliance but we are still thinking everything through    but yea we got like 8 different corp's working and playing togheter like we are 1 
---
his ruffles don't have ridges
---
That sounds pretty cool!   
---
Wishing you guys luck! 
---
&gt; 5 million SP or whatever the minimum is now
---
&gt; immediately start profiting from SP extractions
---
didn't quote a hard number and didn't say you didn't need to be subscribed there dick cheese do yourself a favor and get the fuck out
---
I legit love you now &lt;3
---
you forgot to mention that they are considered T1 variant and thus, can enter small/medium FW plexes...
---
Then compare it to jackdaw, for example... it's probably the best LR destroyer for skirmishes - 369 dps with furies at 90km:
---
Sure it applies worse to frigs (got to switch to LML and even then it doesn't apply perfectly), but with some support (retris which wall it off from incoming ships) it easily overthrows kiki as LR damage platform.
---
Absolutely. Some of them will have spots for player presentations. For example G-Fleet, Vegas, Evesterdam and EDU. Maybe Toronto as well. We're starting to scope out the presentation schedules for some events and we'll make the call for presenters as soon as we can to give people time to prepare.   
---
Thinking of giving a talk? Would be a good one I'm sure :)
---
I had to override autocorrect on my phone when typing out "obsirdity" to quote you
---
so
---
you were saying
---
They spam those ads on People who already play Eve instead of People that do not 
---
Worst state it has ever been in. Technical game breaking bugs, monetization is going ape shit, content is starving, meta is stale, new content is dead on arrival. Don't think the game can pull out of this one without getting rid of SP trading - which will never happen cause monies
---
Good &gt; New Sov mechanics sans wanding.  
---
Bad &gt; Jump Fatigue
---
Ugly &gt; Citadels.
---
&gt; With alts, this can be remedied - to an extent. Upon dueling the alt, the freighter can be webbed by it, allowing it to enter warp near instantly - making it far more difficult for anyone to gank it. Assuming of course your alt gets to the freighter before the bumper does... If the freighter is being bumped, it's already too late.
---
This is even easier to get around than you think. When I was doing freighter runs, sometimes with active bumpers nearby, it just takes a little bit of patience and calm. Make sure the web alt is close enough to the freighter. Or, if you're in a pinch, use a Rapier for webbing. By the time your freighter gets to the next gate aggression timer is up, and you have a full minute of gate cloak to make sure the web alt is in range again.
---
That isn't to say it's 100% but when I was doing highsec freight runs, this was my strategy. Getting jumpy because you see bumpers are active will only cause a freighter pilot to screw up.
---
That being said, I do agree with the OP about DSTs. They will change your life.
---
I don't see a task on there for you to tell me to add more shit to my eve sheets :P
---
Played for over a decade but haven't logged in since October. The game just isn't what it used to be unfortunately. 
---
this. or get rid of supers entirely, the game was never meant to host capital ships
---
Another test dude that thinks highly of Killahbee.  I was in Horde when i had the change to fly with him.  Stand up guy, knows his shit.  If he ever did an NBSI fleet, would join in a second. Definately one of the good ones out there, regardless of the memeworthy shit he said.
---
Biggest threat of realising what a dumb idea it was and jumping out.
---
You can see TEST bringing in a 2nd wave of dreads 3 DD cycles in for some reason.
---
Recruit friends of friends and people you interact with in space who seems cool. If your corp is doing interesting stuff, people will join.
---
you sound autistic, are you from usa?
---
Read it again, he is right. With daily alpha skill injectors you can get a toon up to 5m SP in 2-3 months, where as before alphas you had to pay for those initial 2-3 months. now you can create an army of alphas, which will all be free and ready to become SP farms, dramastically reducing the ROI of SP farms.
---
The moment when you are a poor pleb but like to look like the guys with the bigger toys.. 😅
---
Triglav dread.
---
You need a fair amount of logi to keep the inhib alive against rorquals. They get through shields and into armor/hull rather quickly because most their HP buffer is in the hull.
---
 If you’re looking for lore/non-history books; Eve: The Empyrean Age and Templar One I’d recommend. 
---
Landscapes are so cool in this game it makes me want to come back to gas huffing 
---
Nobody seems to mention it but fleet subcaps are in a really good place compared to the past. We can have fights with TEST MWD eagles, PL AB Eagles, NC booshing Ishtars, Brave Harpies, Goon Cerbs, BL Munnins, Horde Megas, Init Ravens, SV Stukas, all at once. It's a nice change from the eras of Ishtars, Tengus, Proteus, Machs, just dominating the DSCAN.
---
Also someone should mention that CO2 had some issues and went away.
---
Read these and wasn't disappointed 
---
aoe titan doomsdays are new, used all the time. Apply to subs where titans in 2010-2016 couldnt.
---
Supers and carriers have fighters with exceptional application. See Suitonia's wonderful piece on fighter application https://suitonia.wordpress.com/2018/10/25/how-broken-and-oppressive-is-light-fighter-and-heavy-fighter-application-maths-edition/ 
---
HAW guns added to dreads allow them to track subs where before they had nothing of the like.
---
Together this shows a clear buff to damage application to subs.
---
No, https://zkillboard.com/kill/71751615/
---
This would unironically fix everything
---
Hahaha nono mate.
---
You need to train an alpha to 5mil without omega, then get a subscription and +5 training Implants to be anywhere near ISK efficient and also some spare Extractors.
---
Then you need to train that Points to be extracted.
---
That are solid Months of time investment and several billion isk beforehands.
---
If you got those characters set up you're good but before you sink money into them that you cannot liquidate for months.
---
TLDR: Seen much of the same shit happen in RS3.
---
Ex-runescape, alpha noob here. 
---
Many of your comments ( and other posters in this thread) resonate with my first impressions of Eve. 
---
I came here because I wanted a space warfare strategy game. So of course I go out and get killed, then do the tutorial missions, and set off afk hi sec mining in a venture while I do some reading up on the game, both here, on the forums and various other sites.
---
Slowly it begins to sink in that there is something rotten in the state of Denmark. Firstly I am beginning to ask why they are even letting alpha noobs like me come in, it smacks of desperation. Like those small town newspapers who are suddenly giving out free subscriptions delivered right to your doorstep. Without knowing anything about the game my first thought is "Isn't giving away Alpha accounts going to encourage botting?" It doesn't take me long to discover that bots are rampant. I played RS. I can spot a bot from a dozen tiles... I mean.. from a lightyear away. Its not rocket science... Well fuck, in this game maybe it is, okay whatever.
---
These skill injectors also remind me of RS, when they systemically began to devalue every skill, nearly every accomplishment in the game, by selling off xp to whales through microtransactions. You spent 400 hours grinding that level 99, kid? Fuck you, now you can just buy it with irl money. 
---
It also become rapidly obvious that Eve is suffering rampant inflation. In part due to bots and in part due to power creep. Okay, now where have I seen that happen before? Hmmm, oh yeah, watching my stack of gold pieces (gp) in RS3 slowly but steadily become less valuable year after year unless I bought into the "lets fuck you over and make you thank us for the privilege" rares market. Otherwise you fall behind in the money game and you can never catch up (unless you buy gp with irl money...of course.)
---
And this movement in Eve, it seems towards feeding the carebears. FUCK THE CAREBEARS! FUCK THEM! They moaned so much that pvp in RS3 is virtually dead and a huge percentage of the player base moved BACK to an old version of the game with shitty graphics, but where risk versus reward actually means something. In fact the Carebears even bitched so much about dying in PvE that death in RS3 is now practically meaningless rather than being the potentially catastrophic loss it used to be. 
---
RS3 numbers continue to decrease, and all the band aids will not help in the long run, because if you remove excitement then all you are left with is boredom. The content creators leave and the population becomes dominated by carebears, who look around one day and notice all the cool kids have gone, and eventually they stop playing as well. Because they are fucking carebears who are incapable of thinking for themselves, all they can do is follow. 
---
If I do continue to play Eve for any length of time the main reason will be to try hunting down and killing carebears. 
---
So this, my own observations, along with yours and other's comments, makes me dip my toes in the interstellar dust of EVE and go "I'm not sure I want to invest too much time or effort into this, even as a f2p Alpha." I'm sitting here in a Venture gathering insignificant amounts of ISK, thinking, trying to get some angle on how I could approach this game in some unique way. I want to like this game. Because there is nothing else out there. Star Citizen ( lol ), Elite Dangerous, Starborne, Galactic Empires, Sins of a Solar Empire, Stellaris (or whatever that Paradox game is called )... they are all either fps bullshit or derivative crap. 
---
But I must admit that I am finding it really hard to see a way that Eve will provide me with any sense of accomplishment. I have a horrible feeling that I may have joined a decade too late.
---
holy shit this is me....almost. i am much more bitter
---
Pretty good books.
---
Yeah sure you need to sink months into those chars and invest in Improved Implants, a full set of +5 etc and **then** start training to make your first extraction after another month.
---
Yea I guess the grid didn't break for anyone else which is why it was confusing.
---
I challenge that hypothesis - but it’s definitely an interesting thought. We would need to be very specific and define what you mean by the vast majority of pvp. For instance, do you mean total number of killmails? Or alternatively total number of individual engagements?
---
500 if you want to use isk. It's way cheaper to just subscribe than buying plex for cash to sub.
---
agreed.
---
One day he may be caught. What will you say, if the security team follows the money flow? "No no no, I didn't RMT. The botter sent me billions, because I blackmailed him!" Yeah, they will totally believe that...
---
Yeah he is up there for me, really chill bloke.
---
So why aryth said multiple time he was against the rorqual change ?
---
Use your Bhaalgorn to fuck shit up for somebody!
---
Just like pirate ships that are really strong in those situations as well (like worm in a novice).
---
I recently acquired EVE: source. It's a beautiful book, full of history and illustrations. I definitely would recommend it.  I was not to impressed with the frigate book, but it's still a nice piece. I am currently waiting for the delivery of Eve universe
---
They absolutely wouldn't. Feroxes would trade so much better that it would be a no-contest. Everytime you kill a drek, you may as well lose 4-5 feroxes for the same isk. Moreover, battles between fleets are rarely fought out in dps. They're fought out in applicable alpha. Feroxes would kite off against Dreks and Dreks would continue to chuff dongs from afar.
---
Hmm.. so if 3 BS &gt; 1 Titan , how many Frigs &gt; Titan ?   27 ? 
---
I don't think SP farming is worth the trouble these days, according to the calcs I did.
---
Just moved back to Amarr/Minnie wz from a WH, KB green, plenty to shoot as long as you ship appropriately.  When people say Lowsec is dead, they mean they can't get a fight with their 60 man sub cap fleet.  Jump in a frig and it's fine.
---
Because way back then you saw a reddit post or some gaming news about some crazy shit from the game, and youd sift through thousands of comments of "i never got eve its to big too meta blabla", then actually try it and get sucked in like that redpill scene from the matrix when you undocked from dodixie or jita like what the fuck is going on 
---
Meh, I still think being calm most of the time is a good trait to have for an FC. That way you can raise your voice if someone is really important.  
---
Hard to judge for your fleet if you are shouting literally all the time.
---
or just remove supers going through gates, and make jump fatigue relative to the distance between the destination system and the furthest system the super has been inside for the last 12 hours. This way you can have your super umbrella, your neighbor can have their super umbrella... but you can't have all your neighbors supercap umbrellas from all of eve arrive while a fight progresses in soul crushing tidi.
---
they saw how much money they could make with SP trading and that's the end of the story. nice retirement for hilmar
---
At that point the guy is just a retard who can't even check who killed his structures 
---
Its 2019... CCP should be able to pull it off:  Redditing in Stations.
---
With sadness and regret I have to admit I agree with all of this. With one addition, sever performance and instability has greatly increased over the course of the last year or so and is now at a point where its well below what I expect from a paid for product.
---
I too have allowed the subscriptions of my alt accounts to lapse and am very seriously thinking about un-subbing my main when its sub expires in march.
---
I love eve but I'm bored of being a CCP apologist and I no longer have the money or time to waste on sentiments like "well I *might* have fun!" when there are a million other things out there that do give entertainment for a fraction of the price and ongoing headache. My overwhelming feeling is that it's really a complete shame as it never needed to be this way.
---
triglavian titan
---
I agree
---
He's referring to carriers and supers. Nobody is claiming that capital turrets track too well. 
---
The wolf in that video has a resist profile specifically suited to counter em/therm.  On top of that, a wolf can't tank a Super if the pilot has two brain cells to rub together. What do you think would have happened if the super had launched Dromis instead of Sirens?  Sirens don't scram, they just point. Being warp disrupted has literally no influence on his ability to tank here
---
you must be mistaken. the playergroup that benefits mostly from skill injectors are veteran/established players. 
---
I'm not sure if you're being serious... The memes are choice in here, but goons have a bunch of members with personal WHs "just because" - one of my guys has 150 or so PI alts all on his own.
---
It is absolutely debatable because out-tanking a ship involves a lot more than just repping more raw hitpoints. The Leshak has cap stability over any shield fit, has to sacrifice far less utility for its tank, and will over time hit far harder than the Rattle. Not to mention the gap is far less than you claim, with X-type reps shield V armor being 230 V 190 raw hitpoints before any aux nano pumps are added. 8 low slots and higher base damage gives the Leshak a lot of room to maneuver where an active Rattle needs serious sacrifices to remain combat capable.
---
ban people that RMT buy botted isk for botting and the problem of botting is drastically reduced overnight.
---
I disagree 
---
Useless seems a bit harsh.  How about they can only affect subcaps with weapons subcaps can fit?  Maybe throw in a few extra high slots so they act like a kind of super-blob of subcaps to other subcaps while still duking it out with mega weapons against other caps.
---
\+15 years of balancing +300 subcaps just for capitals to dominate...
---
i envy him :(
---
I would agree more if the base damage before spooling was not so close to base damage of comparable ships like HAM drakes and Harbingers. In the fits I used in the OP my Harbinger hits for 610 on guns and the Drek starts at 485, so it would surpass the Harby again in some 20 seconds.
---
Yeah but after that point you're just printing isk.
---
If they are part of a nullsec group, they do not deserve a wormhole.
---
Horde has no ti... hmm, okey probably can't run that one anymore
---
Moros is a great HAW platform. 
---
Join goons, set tax at 15% and afk while your peons make you billions of isk
---
I understand that injectors convert the "cost" of skillpoints to just that, a monetary cost, rather than the harrowing prospect of losing hard-earned skillpoints it once was. I'd understand an argument against the SP cost back then, but now that it's just part of the ship's cost what makes this a bad mechanic? Do you consider the cost still too much, or are you against the clunky nature of how you "pay" that part ?
---
Having done my time with Amarr/Min swopped over to Cal recently and am stunned by how utterly deserted it is. Always heard about how much more active it was, expected gangs pushing back agains tthe upcoming defeat and hoped might even find a few intrepid souls who's want to dive through and harass the Galmil sov but you struggle to get even so much as a kitchen sink mooch around contested systems going. There are 200-300 member corps who's soul activity seems to be whining in the militia channel about how everyone's let them down.
---
Rest of lowsec doesn't feel much better, there's people living in Aridia/Khanid and the usual bottom feeders in Derelik but most of the rest seems to be basically uninhabited. When you can remember back to when even pointless systems like fucking Bosena were actually fought over it's really jarring to roam around for an hour and not see so much as a gatecamp.
---
I think your use of the phrase "carebear" kind-of negates all of your other opinions. 
---
tbh I thought the same about PGL before getting to play with him because the bad stuff gets the most attention on reddit, but I'd take an excited FC any time rather than a flat apathic voice (which is probably what I would sound like I tried FCing).
---
People say Vily is calm and composed, and he is, especially compared to PGL, but honestly my favorite FC quote is when he shouted THIS IS WHAT I WANNA SEE back in Vale.
---
imho a good FC should project a sense of urgency and excitement to their fleet, not bore them to death.
---
Drone lands or pure blind
---
Is it possible to use a cargo scanner on an Upwell structure to learn what is inside, even if it’s only the corporation hangar, please ?
---
id argue the opposite, introduce skill loss on CAPITALS aswell, wich will make welping em not just "oh well it was insured, so i lost 200m isk" add some more risk to ships that are just way too common in the current game 
---
The guy was lucid about the changes, props to him really, must be hard to be surrounded by thousands of spodbrains. But do you seriously think the goonCSM is actively pressing CCP to nerf rorquals/capitals now they're at the top of the foodchain? Ofc not
---
War doesn't really seem isk efficient.. it creates awesome and fun content tho
---
And see even less major capital engagements? 
---
Impressive range and damage for its size, but range and damage can work at any ship size. What balances the Jackdaw and other ships of its type is their application being lackluster at best. Fighting a cruiser or BC gang with those Jackdaws you will be dealing with opponents who can reach out and hit back, and hitting frigates or destroyers they will apply a fraction of their DPS. Using the same fit from my post trying to shoot an interceptor the comparison is [pretty obviously](https://i.imgur.com/s84w8gn.png) in the Kikimoras favor until the 60k mark where the jackdaws only advantage is range.
---
Consider instead replacing the screening Retributions with a few of those in the Jackdaw fleet, and now no frigate can get within 50km for longer than ten seconds....
---
Wrong in so many ways its funny.
---
Ignoring the many new parta of the game that were not in release in 2003 and would need the server codw updated to match. Things like Blops, moon mining, The Drone lands not existing etc. Every hardware update would require a cose redo.
---
Currently we are on TQ Server Rev 3 (Its actually the 4th gen but the 1st gen of a bunch of desktops on a network as the server isnt counted.) Each HW update requires significant code changes. Read the dev updates and sime of the CCP devs twitters thwy give a good overview of what the changes have ACTUALLY been.
---
Personal preference I guess. The calm, clear comma of horde makes it WAY easier to do/coordinate multiple things at once (TC, who's burning cynics where, coord with other fleets, intel, etc.)
---
Yeah this game really needs more risk adverse Loki fleets... much skill
---
Bring back clone upgrades!
---
&gt; I'm just a fucking money squirting statistic to them
---
It's starting to feel like this, agreed.
---
yes.
---
That’s a great plan ! Still need to get dem armor skills up tho 
---
And learn how to PVP, additionally 
---
EHP is Effective hit points. For simplicity you generally assume omni resists as anything else is unreasonable or unaccountable for. EHP is your raw hitpoints with omni resist taken into account already, so resists are in fact factored into my math already. Scrams are also very common and downright mandatory for brawling, and the Drekavac can hit your Drake for far more DPS than heavies will get you out to long past point range, at which point he can warp off if he decides you wont get any closer because you cant hold him any more than he is holding you.
---
no they are already stupid broken, the sp loss is perfectly reasonable for flying loki cancer
---
HAW guns don't track even cruisers without proper fit, watch those videos I linked where a cruiser sigtanks Bjorns Moros.
---
HAW guns were much needed tho!
---
Fighters don't travel 15km/s all the time and their dps application is against untanked hulls, on top of all fighters slingshot themself out of their own optimal.
---
If you look at those Numbers and simulate for real tanked *lol* ships like Cerberus/Munin with 70-80% resistances and 1700m/s 450sig you get a total dps of around 160-170 per Nidhoggur with 3 full fighters squads.
---
They might loose their fighters on the way for even lower dps.
---
Assault Cruisers got their active damage control and can most likely withstand with logistics or travel long enough out of bubble to warp of.
---
Your link looks nice but you see clearly on all those simulated fits and pictures that its only fighter outgoing dps. Not damage taken by their target.
---
A 55k+ without damage control ehp Cerberus/Munin can tank several carriers, dozen of fightersquads at the same time.
---
And logistics got enough time to react, no Assault cruiser can die to alpha with their damage control.
---
If those fighters travel to their targets with MWD you can simply boosh away the fleet and make them useless much like the Initiative did as we destroyed PanFams anchoring Keepstar in H-5 https://zkillboard.com/kill/73574692 .
---
Fighters were spread all over the grid in range of nothing because their MWD deactivated after use.
---
I chose Cerbs/Munin since they get fielded a lot by PanFam, Legacy and The Imperium.
---
If you look for damage taken instead of outgoing damage you get less stupid inflated numbers.
---
Jeen* and he is ours you can’t have him.

droping supers and titans on every frig roam i dont think gona make game funny ...is just erasing the content...i hoped when they boosted the isk faucets,game gona became more risky...risk vs reward....but no, isk is all over place and ppl dont fight for resources in game ,like used to be in the past
---
Please respond to this poll with a number (provided below)
---
1. I agree
---
2. I disagree
---
3. Third funny option
---
Oh, Supreme Commander, great game! But this is a Aeon's transport ship with tanks hooked xP
---
This crossed my mind back then and since I am a gambling loving man I decided that this is unlikely to ever happen. Still do.  
---
If I need to prove that what I say is true to a security nerd I would probably go first to the chat logs. 
---
Source?
---
To be honest I don't think there is much place to get try and get without some big alliance backing you up. Harass the fuck out of an entity that is not too strong (Prothean maybe, or somewhere in PB), create timer and batphone your target ennemies or who ever can small blood in the water.
---
But mostly rely on your ability to not be bored to death fighting around timers while having a decent quality group. Which generally is not so compatible.
---
Upvoted for soundtrack!
---
Lol, so less cap engagements. Goons will be untouchable if no-one fights with titans because of sp loss. 
---
maybe is time CCP gibe some pass over bs es...like make them more viable against caps?
---
It all boils down to the economic state of the game and by that i mean the combination of Rorquals + Injectors what ultimate lead to Super/Titan proliferation. As a side effect it makes subcap fights meaningless, losses are just shrugged off.
---
There is too much Ore/ISK in the game and it is way too easy to obtain.
---
This is bait...
---
\&gt;500 active members and 10 faxes
---
get more faxes
---
It´s been years now but there was once a "inhouse/behind the scenes" thingy where CCP showed the early days of EvE and it made clear what kind of mess the whole project was and still is. Pretty sure it´s still lingering somewhere in the web. 
---
Well lets assume if you create a statistic about how many ppl "naturally skill" the lost SP back to regain that specific lost skill compared to how many ppl simply buy an injector and put that skill back to whatever it was basically after they got podded to jita anyway, then CCP might even think about putting more SP-losses up, as it would increase the need for Injectors ... with the resulting market, farms, PLEX-prices etc.
---
Basically a good option for CCP to get some extra cash ... i mean SP loss for supers or caps in general ... not hard to implement that ... probably a couple clicks
---
The KiKi does not get 57km unless your just fitting optimal range mods. Also all you have to do it use either ECM or tracking disruptors with optimal rage in and they are somewhat cucked. Yes they are strong and yes they are comparably pricy. A T1 destroyer cost 10m to fly yet a fitted kikimora is 200-300m why shouldnt it be far superior.  The Drek could do with a litttle balance but the first wave of changes have not even taken place yet. 
---
I can also confirm that Kikimoras pop just as fast as corms.
---
Are they not already?
---
&gt; "...one specific area where your streamers go all the time for content, starts with a F..."
---
Fortnite?
---
oh yea, im aware of that  
---
and i can guarantee you that it hasnt gotten better ever since 
---
with 500 active members it should be easy. My alliance with max 50 active people took sov.
---
We lost it again after a few days but that doesnt matter ;)
---
But people actually fight us, if SP loss becomes prevalent then no-one will fight us and it will get worse
---
Sorry, paywalled
---
Yea this. As aperson who has helped propel an alliance we had to ride on the coat tails of everyone. That alliance is still riding a coat tail. Just how the game goes. 
---
Try nrds and come live in provi?
---
games always been so so, the number of decent groups is getting maybe a bit weaker, and if anything thats whats really going to kill the game.
---
The power blocs would come and ruin you pretty fast I think.  That would be NC/PL, Goons or TAPI - whichever interest you were harming most by existing.
---
You don't. Flat out, you don't. You make the attempt, someone calls an ally, and you promptly get fucked to death because you have nowhere near what the groups you'll be against have.
---
Rookie mistake of mine w/ the resists&amp;ehp, derp    
---
but yea if he warps off it would be a win for me as i could pull range or sod off as a T1 BC stands no chance againts the average Trig BC or even a well piloted Trig Cruiser  (it would be suicide for me to not focus on getting away if i get agressed by a trig pvp ship) 
---
Sell it, buy a capital. 
---
Couldn't disagree more. I fly the things almost exclusively. Cloaky nullified is 100% broken OP, especially if you combine it with a nomad set. To stop me you need one of - 
---
* bait that I dont see through 
---
* epic Boston timing
---
* a fuckoff massive pre-prepared gate camp with drones or jet cans literally everywhere
---
Otherwise I'm completely immortal, with an engagement profile wide enough to threaten all but the toughest sub caps solo and ability to carry a covert cyno.
---
T3c is op af. The skill point loss barely starts to offset that.
---
*shrugs* i mean tbh, the big blue donut is the main issue, really. 
---
no way to fix that except to hope for IRL issues to kill the horde.
---
As a guy with a severe hardon for kitey nano bullshit small hulls, I gotta either point out the Damavik is garbage for kiting or beg to see a fit.
---
How are you fitting a 1400 DPS tengu?  Only polarized weapons will get you that high and that's a pretty useless fit.
---
I can get behind that.
---
That would be awesome.
---
no
---
I disagree with that. Karkurs team is doing gods work but they are limited in manpower so there is just so much you can do. 
---
Best thing would have been to take a lot of money, grab some code monkeys and let them re-write the code. It shouldn´t be too hard given there is enough money and manpower on the task. Yet Karkur and friends re-writing parts of the code and fixing other stuff where possible. That is band-aiding at its worst. If the core is rotten, it is just a matter of time until the coverage will not be able to cover it up anymore. 
---
People were happy to not lose skills? How weird. 
---
I sometimes like not being kicked in the balls
---
It doesn't help
---
Much of my post was mentioning how the price is the sole balancing factor in these ships. With prices dropping a ferox could be the cost of only 2 or 3 Drekavacs soon, and since you are technically matching long range vs short range weapons the DPS/Alpha numbers are not as far apart as you think, even before spooling. If rigs could provide another 30% range to a fit [like this](https://i.imgur.com/HV5s9O5.png) it would be a very viable alternative, and one with a lot more ability to hit above its weight against capitals, structures or heavier fleets.
---
Join querious fight club
---
not just neccesarily make em less common, but make the stakes higher, make a devestating defeat/cap loss be actually something that isnt just "dock up, reship, jump back in", if you kill a titan that dude shud feel it by having to wait a week or 2 to be able to undock in one again , just as T3C gangs do 
---
Please god no
---
At least post the code and publication and not that bs
---
most commonly neut bursts are used, they're very powerful in nearly every encounter your super fleet may find itself in as suddenly losing a chunk of cap is bad for just about anything
---
web bursts are typically not worth using on any ship other than the vendetta, but they are mega useful for holding subcap fleets down while you lance dd them
---
other than that, no, pretty much bubble bursts 
---
i just wondered if it mjd'ed around him in a fleet while killing him yet
---
You can also use them to make ships harder to probe (probe scan result strength is based on probe scan strength versus ship sig radius divided by ship sensor strength)
---
Lmao. First thing you do is not listen to Reddit about how to do it.
---
The skillbook for Kiki is about 200m. The small disintegrator specialization for t2 guns is another 500m. Then there's the cost of the actual hull. We're talking close to 1b to start flying a destroyer, in the age where (particularly in nullsec) everyone and their mother has a capital or 2 that they want to fly pretty much exclusively. 
---
I don't think we're likely to see Kikis Online anytime soon.
---
Get as fast as you can out of the mining thingie and into Frig/Cruiser PvP in lowsec. It is cheap and fun enough so you might stay for a bit longer and enjoy the adrenaline kick of your first 1000 fights.
---
I would contact The Imperium and ask to take Cloud ring since it's dead here anyway
---
Its because the Trig ships are born out of risk and sometimes pvp. They hold no function in any other part of the game except pvp. People dont pve in a Trig ship. They are the hunters of New eden.
---
But why? These are intended to be personal and not corporation or alliance assets. Corporations have the ability to cover many timezones and defend assets in each of them, but individual players do not. That's why the reinforcement timer is so long and why you can even scoop the deoot during reinforcement.
---
Depends what the ultimate goal is, PB is mostly free space except from a few strategic systems. Come up with some better alternatives.
---
CCP shud just focus a year on rewriting the core or atleast undo all the knots and ties they have that bog the code down, as i said earlyer, it makes so many unessesary calls to the database, if you where to remove em you could improve performace by alot  
---
heck you can do that all while still having your art dudes pump out skins and the balance team put out balance patches,   
---
but i dont think CCP will dedicate a year JUST for codemonkey work, its just tape on more stuff till it finally breaks (see chat outsourcing, see removal of AOE damage on titan deaths, see POS removal, see drone bugs, see warp bugs etc etc) 
---
I can ride my bike with no handle bars.
---
I wonder how many people even play in WH's these days.
---
You need some diplomatic arrangement, otherwise you will fast be killed from more sides than you can handle. So, like other said, look after a power vacuum. Check which power is more or less strong and has an interest to fill the gap with a bluetral. Then, you can easily take space. Though you still would have to fight for it, but at least not everyone turns against you.
---
I'll do it, if you keep the sub running. I'll even train your chars. 
---
I'd rather have loki fleets then capital fleets.
---
Also if you think sp loss is keeping people from flying them then why did null blocs use T3s quite awhile despite having the sp loss.
---
Probably my hangar...
---
EWAR as a balancing factor is a poor argument. I can just as easily say TDs and ECM hurt any other ship in the game because that is their purpose. A Kiki is no more vulnerable to a griffin or crucifier than a confessor, hecate or god damned Apocalypse. And again, with price dropping my claim is the cost is the only balancing factor for these ships and it will soon not be enough to balance them at all. The confessor and many others will be all but useless if a Kiki costs 80m instead of 180m.
---
some of us are still alive.
---
most aren't.
---
We had some shenanigans recently inside the alliance which made 50% of our members quit... so theres that too.
---
Also, a coup attempt.
---
Aryth when he first heard of it said to CCP "If you release this, I going to abuse it" CCP decide to not listen Aryth, Aryth abused it. Source are The Meta show, but I don't remember which one, a few month back for sure.
---
Now you might say "yeah but what if he lie ?" Remember the context, it was right after WWB, goons recently took delve, MBC, fed by casino for years took took all the north part of EVE. So they had, more money, the propaganda advantage, more space and more people. Do you really think, as a goon CSM you are going to ask CCP to buff a ship worth 10 bil (I think it was 15bil at that time with the drones cost) who require a super/titan fleet to help you if you get fucked ? 
---
Really, stop blaming goons for reading the patch and adapting to it, blame your leader who also had CSM in that same room, who also had the same patch to read, who also had more money/space at that time, but decide to make fun of us until they release they fucked up 2 year later 
---
So, you want to kill dreadbombs? You want every single super force in the game to become COMPLETLY untouchable? This is a horrible idea
---
Should we add timers to mtus then?
---
i have 4 omega accounts. 3 i run with plex which i buy with isk. On 2 omega accounts i have alts which are SP farming. I just bought 1500plex, 2 mptc and 8 skill extractors. I make around 10b isk in one month. I want to inject my 4th omega with skill injectors to get him to fly a rorqual. I still need around 120 days to get to it. I don't have a rorqual with fit and excavators yet. Should i first get the ship and the drones and inject afterwards or should i first inject and then get the ship and the drones? I also want to inject my 2. and 3. omega to fly a dread and a carrier. They also need around 120 days until they can fly those ships. My 1. can fly a fax. I'm trying to decide if i should sell the skill injectors or if i should inject them.
---
I think i should sell for now until i have the ships with fitting and all and afterwards i can inject. In the meantime my 3 chars could train with implants and attribute remap.
---
&gt; f moving by your myth and believe in that shit. And that really funny for me.
---
The Kiki isn't actually all that good. It's got insane DPS but it's mix of sig and paper thin tank makes it really struggle against Jackdaws, Feroxes, RLML spam or really just any ranged DPS. It's also fairly expensive to fit up, and IMO a Jackdaw outperforms it at most roles.
---
You seem mad.
---
Tifida &lt;3
---
ive seen plenty of dread bombs where 80% of the dreads managed to get out, also dread bombs are like the least risky thing you can do w/ caps atm, id argue ratting in a carrier is more risky than a dreadbomb and that is just wrong  
---
so them being a bit more risky is something id gladly welcome  
---
also the SP loss would also hit the super, and make ratting supers less common or atleast the people more risk aware
---
They already have reinforcement and expiry timers? Not sure what you mean.
---
Are they supposed to be (semi)safe storage?
---
[Also if you think sp loss is keeping people from flying them then why did null blocs use T3s quite awhile despite having the sp loss.]
---
Where the fuck did I say that? I think removing the SP loss would remove what makes them special. They should come with a risk. 
---
Tone makes a big statement too.  Lord rahvin is a perfect example of that. Probably one of the few times I felt really bad about fucking up, just the disappointment in his voice was like, man :feelsbad:
---
Retrospectively, I'm pretty happy I chose a dread pilot name whose name starts with an 'x'.  
---
I think we will have to agree that the speculation there has gotten too complex. I will propose that the fact the Leshak is comparable to any single battleship at almost any role is a serious balancing issue, and previously such omnicapable ships were regarded as oppressively OP - IE Ishtar, T3Cs, T3Ds....
---
I'm surprised you haven't been downvoted into oblivion yet by the hordes or mindless drones for pointing out the facts so clearly.
---
Ever since early spring you have been busy evicting anyone who does not have a considerable amount of force fighting back just exclusively for monetary gain. The difference between HK and you is that they evict people they have a history with (at least the past year) because they don't need money, you evict people for sport. If you deny this you honestly have your head up your ass. I saw personally multiple times sub 20 member ACTIVE corps being evicted by you because uh they might have some stuff in there, let's loot it all and split into 200!!
---
&gt; HK is invulnerable and very strong, complete nonsense, as the INIT have recently proved, and other unsuccessful operations. 
---
Fucking cool mate, like a null bloc can evict a wspace corp, they so weak man we are all shaking! Go try drooling over some more inactive C6 farmholes while you can, maybe you can sniff up a couple bills before you are forced out of jspace for good. Although I have no idea what unsuccessful operation you are talking about, they try, you on the other hand just turn tail and run like a pile of shit the moment there is resistance.
---
Nobody ever liked you, not even people from your own community. Look at Inner Hell and how well they have been doing. Hole Control brawling others, being vocal with other group, helping, accepting batphones and you are there doing your own shit gameplay because everybody bad and enemy! Brax is the best husbando there is so shut your trap! I would not give a fuck if he came to evict me, but when my friends tell me they rather not move into jspace just to get evicted by Outlaws. yeah nah that is fucked up.
---
&gt; So you may destroy all structure of my alliance but you never destroy Outlaws. Only I am may that doing because created that. 
---
Well the ping said you are unanchoring everything in C2, your highclass hole - whatever bearhole - that was meant to be is also being bashed. What is threatening HK? They will just lay dicks all over you and bash you out of any hole you settle in but it is not my job to make empty threats, just looking at the recent hits and kinda worried about your future mate.
---
Replacing Moon mining POSes with yet another cancer citadel grind killed the real content.  
---
This is obviously a biased, possibly falsified article. It completely ignored the statistics of League of Legends players who participated in anonymous surveys and have admitted that:
---
&gt;A. The predominantly male player base spends much of their time in game attempting to lure each other into homemade “sex dungeons”
---
&gt;B. Upon success, they will usually eviscerate their victim, displaying body parts as trophies and continuing to use them for sexual gratification 
---
So when do you graduate middle school?
---
I don't disagree, but seeing as most major power blocks only fight when the stakes are heavily in their favor, increasing the stakes might not be the best way forward.
---
They have a different role. Depots are meant for storage overnight while you explore the nearby space and MTUs are for looting while you actively play the game.
---
&gt;Jackdaws don't apply to frigs
---
Have you played this game before?
---
Whats Jira
---
You are wrong in several claims. To give some context: I am talking about skirmish gang which is specialized in fighting overwhelming amount of enemy frigates/destroyers/cruisers.
---
First off, when shooting ceptors in jackdaws you switch to precision script and faction missiles, so actual applied dps is much higher (more than 100). Jackdaws there are not for shooting ceptors though. Besides that, our skirmish gang has hyena which lets even jackdaws to apply 100%.
---
Projection: jackdaws are one of very few destroyers who can outrange BCs (with exception of the ferox). Most BCs cannot even lock to range at which jackdaw can shoot. It means that jackdaw can survive while doing damage despite having quite low HP. Kikimoras have to get out immediately when something with projection lands close to them. It's their probably only disadvantage, but it is huge.
---
Due to this, kikis are bad frontliners for frigate skirmish gangs. Good frontliner has to possess several of the following: sturdiness + tackle, anti-support damage, stopping power. Retris (sturdy + tackle, anti-support) hyenas (med survivability, stopping power vs ram jags), garmurs (anti-support, stopping power - bad survivability but you got to have LR scram) are few examples of these.
---
Gf hate to see ppl dragging on the moros tho
---
Sorry, did you really eat the onion?
---
Thoughts on moon mining changes?  I really feel like fighting over POSes was one of the few solid results of the POS code.  Some of my best, and first, null fights were us dropping or defending a moon stick.  Now it's just another citadel grind. 
---
You are 100% in NPC corp. Dont need to prove anything to anyone. Go roam delve urself and watch those bots.
---
Jirub deez nutz
---
I’m your huckleberry. 
---
You don't try to pin it down you just shoot it once and it's forced off.
---
Won't someone think of the Excavators.
---
That would be the exact same argument on having one single allince ruling nullsec...  
---
And that is definitely not happening.
---
What
---
Look into NJED,  they are a cool bunch of people
---
please cease trash posting, do it on goonfleet or something awful instead
---
Fights start because of scarcity, not abundance.
---
Or start in NPC null (Great Wildlands, Curse) and blops/roam into a nearby dead area.  Harass whoever lives there until they give up.  Move in and take their shit. 
---
Haha eveonion when?
---
You can do it with two people - there's so much empty space out there, just take a slice from a shit group.  Suitonia did exactly that: [https://suitonia.wordpress.com/2017/03/25/how-i-feel-about-aegis-sov-my-story/](https://suitonia.wordpress.com/2017/03/25/how-i-feel-about-aegis-sov-my-story/)
---
You must be delusional
---
You complain that they are too strong by calling them risk adverse in a thread about with the suggestion of removing sp loss from them it's not hard to think your implying that at all.
---
It really isn't a risk in the  unless you think a small injector is going to add to much to the price of it for it to be flown and even if they are on special occasions. I can't really name people these days who don't have subs V and really worry if they lose it because of that.
---
If you would of just said removing SP loss would remove what makes them special then I could I agree with that though that's not mentioned at all in your comment.
---
The most well known IT Issue &amp; Project tracking app from Atlassian.
---
Nah, Im thinking correctly.  My wording was just confusing.
---
Exhumers are more annoying to box than rorqs when you use hulks, and if you don't use hulks then your yield is quite a bit lower.
---
Ah i misunderstood then, my bad
---
Read the pages a little more carefully - the https://www.eveonline.com/articles/patch-notes webpage usually includes the later updates to the same release.
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/pl6a4o/patch-notes-for-january-2019-release has the January 15th patch notes, but also the 16th
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/pjdior/parch-notes-for-december-2018-release has all the patch notes from the December release, and also the patch notes from a small patch on the 8th of January
---
Well, i just said that it is not really comparable to rattle (which dishes out 1.4k dps while tanking 5k before links/heat) and nightmare (which is slippery BS - not something leshak is known for), but you still claim it to be comparable...
---
The question is who you would invade, not where would you quietly sulk and hide.
---
I been playing since 2004. Around 300m sp on 2 accounts. I have multiple supers, which I have gotten over the last 8 or so months. And I didnt really work hard to get them. Felt completely underwhelming to get them. Rorq wouldnt have been so bad if it wasnt for keepstars and skill injectors. I had a titan back when citadels didnt exist. I was nervous every time I used it, and moved it. I hate skill injectors. In 2006 I got banned from the forums for some time after expressing my discontent with the introduction of plex. The thread was hilarious. I think it was Vegeta who owned Oveur in it. But at least Oveur seemed passionate about it. CCP still had a dream, a vision. I think they lost it around 2011. Cant remember last time I actually was on the forums. The changes to moon goo I think was great. That you actually have to go out and mine it. Instead of this massive afk income. Im in a huge corp now. I know almost nobody. The whole organization is so well structured, I dont have to know anyone. But it is fun listening on coms how all these former high sec idiots tell stories about shit that never happened. "oh yeah I had 15 geckos on my ishtar in 2007" and shit like that. There will never be a game like EVE for me again. I had been online for some time when I started to play it. But most of the lingo was all new to me. And I thought it was specific to EVE. From 2004 until 2009 I only played EVE. It satisfied my gaming needs in every way possible. And new and interesting shit was coming out on a yearly basis. Actual expansions. I am not sure why I still play. Probably because I have tendency to become addicted to shit. That feeling of winning a fight, but my hands are shaking so much, I have to wait 15mins to light my smoke. That dose of adrenaline. 
---
Where in it's description does it say they are made for semi safe/safe storage? I don't mind mobile depos having a rf timer but 2 days for such a cheap item is a bit much. 
---
You can kill a Titan with 20 dreads, lose all of them, and still come out on top. If all of those dreads suddenly lose dread V and the Titan loses dread V then you are WAAAY behind 
---
Larger scale nullsec dreadbombs have a high chance of large losses, offset by the fact that you kill something expensive. If your dreads suddenly start losing skill points on dead, dreadbombs will become a rarity.
---
Where do you fucking guys come up with this shit
---
I love you for the music... Avatar is that hidden gem people don't know about until they go to a huge metal concert. &lt;3
---
I will grant there that the Kiki is not enough to survive as a mainline fleet ship, and although I see now I claimed it could be the only ranged destroyer to use, that was not my intention. As I alluded to with replacing Retris with Kikis, the ship would fill a role most similar to an Oracle or perhaps blaster kite Naga, except where these target the groups primary the Kiki would be far more suited to staying only long enough to apply damage to enemy frigates. Consider if the enemy had two of those Kikis warp in to the center of their fleet. The jackdaws take a second to lock and 6s for their first volley to land, and in that time you have already lost a hyena or garmur, who are squishy and close enough for the Kikis to obliterate. With them dead or scared off they are free to warp off, come back, and do it again, ensuring that those jackdaws at 90k are the only thing alive because all your support got sniped. To try and hold a grid with the Kiki is obviously suicide, but targeting tackle it can nonetheless gain control of a grid.
---
They have a different role but even if they are ment for storage over night I wouldn't mind them say having a 8-10h timer. 2 days for a cheap item is a bit much even if it's ment for just storage over night.
---
I also don't think its even used like that by a most of the playerbase and I don't think a decrease in rf time would hurt the players that use it as you said while allowing people to reduce the amount of depo spam you see.
---
Yeah it is OK for playing the sub of a cyno alt but doesn't make any significant profit at these price levels.
---
Are you FEDUP? Leave FW space and join legacy seems to be the answer you're looking for... 
---
69
---
why would you post a video where you outnumbered the entire hostile fleet with just dreads?  
---
nice save tho o7
---
Why waste your isk on fun when you can inject another rorqual?
---
This is the preferred recruitment method of Spoopy Newbies. Blap a newbro, reimburse them and then entice them with epic stories about WH space. Granted, it does not always work.

Also, always keep an eye open on https://www.reddit.com/r/evejobs/ (or post there from time to time).

I just re-read templar one over audio book. Completely worth it.

I would love to see a combat capable Rattle with 5k tank before links, heat or crystals... The 1.4kDPS is easily surpassed by a Leshak. The Nightmares specific niche with its two neuts + AB bonus is one I cant argue with, but I bet any Leshak would win or scare off any comparable Nightmare fit *easily.*
---
So what was the story behind the dread welp? Just shits and giggles?
---
New meat here. 
---
How does one get into processing?
---
 And creating structures?
---
 I just want to build my own stuff.
---
Yeh, totally agree on that one. As said, it shouldn´t be too hard to unfuck the code by simply re-writing the whole thing. After all you´re not starting from scratch. Maybe in parallel universe CCP didn´t make stupid side projects and focused on unfucking the core game. Now we just need to find a way to migrate into said universe. :) 
---
and learning skills!
---
and no warp to 0!
---
PLS CCP MAKE GAME EASY FOR ME IT'S SOOOOO HARD PLS
---
I am literally nobody. I'm trying to ask rando's in the community how they would lead a war, but most everyone, hilariously, seems to have missed the "hypothetical" part.
---
i am thinking of them
---
they can pay for my bad pvping skills
---
What if only supers and titans get sp loss? Boom, dreadnombs are now even more cost effective
---
This x1000
---
A: you can make the SP loss not as harsh as loosing a LVL5 but lets say you loose half of it (20ish days or w/e)     
---
B: if you can welp 50b in caps wich thanks to insurance is more like 12b in caps to kill something worth ~100b that has next to no insurance payout, then something is fucky      
---
C: Blackops bridge some leshaks, have some more risk of failing to kill, but have a chance to evacuate and no SP loss when getting blapped   
---
Imagine if you had to set up isk farms without alpha. Starting at 200k sp. You're investing what, 3 plex and +5's in them to even get your first extractors in 3 months time. 
---
Instead you get them to 5m sp, then it's just +5's and one plex and off you go. Slap in some mct's for alts. 
---
Then how about "space cow"?  
---
You seem to fundamentally mis-understand these ships. They don't have more range and even if they did, they have a host of issues that you apparently are not considering. Judging by the fit you linked/the general content of your post you're still fairly new to pvp so allow me to (hopefully) welcome you to EVE and the world of pyfa. Best of luck learning!
---
Sorry guy I'll try find more time in my day 
---
I agree, T3C is not as strong as it was before. They were dominant in every pvp aspect of the game. So yes, it was totally consistent to bring a drawback to the use of these monsters. 
---
But now, their use is more cloak oriented for farmers ganking, exploration, blops. Not the "must have" ship"  for pvp it was before. They have been nerfed so yes, the skill loss must be terminated to be aligned with their new use.
---
Was a joke, they are a 500 man alliance and prob similar carrier numbers (maybe more I dunno) 
---
Learning skills... Who ever thought it was a good idea to have players train for a month before they started training?
---
2 words:
---
meat fanfics
---
not using the osprey to mine tsk
---
maybe in a paralell universe CCP allowed Private servers for DUST514 by making a PC port and it still lives on to this day *sob*
---
Totally unrelated to the resist nerf of T3s
---
Hey guys, let's remove the end goal of eve because 1 alliance use them
---
yes, honey. you are elite, sweety
---
Im sorry I barely consider the damavik a hull, I wasn't thinking about it nor I know of any good kite fits for it. 
---
I don't have spellcheck in the reddit app on my phone. Also its a word I misspell so frequently due to lack of spellchecker it's in my autocorrect. http://imgur.com/gallery/0sVosmP
---
Just remove it
---
Please tell me you're doing this with ravens
---
or make the hit on supers and titans way more severe than dreads/carriers  (the bigger the hull, the bigger the loss) 
---
Looking at the BRs, evicting force was not overwhelming for even a small gang to take on.
---
The only fighting back was a jackdaw catching an astero after the citadel wreck was being cleaned up.
---
you can remove misspellings from autocorrect
---
but okay
---
And is depot spam a problem somehow? You can reinforce them whenever and just come back later to kill them if you don't like them.
---
The two day timer is there so that you don't have to stress about losing all of your stuff if you can't log in one evening. For example, I used to solo deploy to hostile space and stage out of a depot. I stored ammo in the depot, but also the loot I got. Sometimes I had 7b inside just from the loot from the stuff I killed. Would've been shitty if I left it there on thursday evening, decided to head out for beers with friends after work on friday and come back home to find my depot dead. Making the timer shorter forces you to log in daily just to check your depot, even if you wanted to play other games on some days.
---
How else do you tenderize the legs? With nothing but a pinch of salt?
---
Sounds to me like you're the real monster here.
---
cant wait for Jira version 4.4
---
we will return you to the promised land
---
I swear it
---
Most expensive ... 
---
Jita Query all the way haha. 
---
he does npsi fleets occasionally actually
---
[https://imgur.com/a/DFqzD5d](https://imgur.com/a/DFqzD5d) \- this is the fit we've been using for years in following scenarios:
---
1. Before leshak era it was mainline BS against carrier meta
---
2. During leshak era it is used against capitals which leshak cannot tank, when we're low on numbers and cannot bring enough support for leshaks (as i mentioned - vs RTL phoenixes, 2+ carriers)
---
3. To start fights in various areas - just put out such rattle (facetank value) or nightmare (slippery tank value) and you can start a fight with decent chance without dying. Leshak in these conditions is too scary and not tanky to survive at all.
---
Is this a good time to cry about overkill and how titans are ruining the game?
---
I didn't know I was misspelling it, so thank you for bringing it to my attention meowtiger. I will definitely use the correct version from here on out. I also realised I mispelled relatively too, so again, thank you for your valuable service in helping me improve the grammar and spelling in my reddit comments. 
---
I dropped 6 of them in a WH once and kept 2 with imicus's, one with probes and ammo, the last 2 for blue loot and salvage, and lived out of that for a week.  I'm certain that the mobile depot is for the space hobos like me, that at the time couldn't think of having enough isk to join a structure and refused to join a larger player group because being a line member is boring af.
---
If they were easy to rf and destroy I would have never been able to achieve that. Even now I use them regularly on long term solo deployments in cloaky shit in enemy sov.
---
Yup. Thanks. Sound advice. Lost most of my ships in null, smart bombs seem to like me for some reason, so I'm just making a bit of replacement money mining while I read up on Eve. 
---
I think its becoming clear what my goals are. 
---
1) To encourage the replacement of the current terminology of "carebear" with "spacecow". 
---
2) To kill as many spacecows as possible.
---
But while being webbed you can allways bail the fight.
---
So fighting carriers is fine, I wouldn't reccomend fighting Supers with two support launch tubes for web and point.
---
But there are allways PvE plebs who die without dromis or siren in fighter bay:
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/73916451
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/73669885
---
There are different Assault Frigs with their T2 Empire resistance profile too tho.
---
The Video shows his reasoning why it Works in Bloodraider/Sansha and most of Dronespace: http://schildwall.phbv3.de/basics/npc_damage_en.html
---
Because those NPC rats are weak against EM so most ratters only have Ametats/Templars in Tubes.
---
If you switch Regions you better use another Assault Frigate to match their NPC damage profile too.
---
Starting to see a recurring method here, I have spoken to victims before post murder and even in some cases where i see a newbro with a &gt;1mil ship i usually reimburse them with a little motivation email. 
---
Have not taken to starting a convo and recruiting them however, thought the wounds would be a bit fresh from the killing part. 
---
I don't blame goons for the patch, CCP is guilty, not goons. Aryth is right, goons only abused it and people can't blame them for using a legit in-game feature. Now that it's clear that i don't call goons liars, cheaters or whatever, let's be realistic : do you seriously think goonCSM team doesn't preach for its own chapel? Ofc yes. Will there be a rorqual/capital hard nerf? no, because CSM members don't want to kill their own economy and lose superiority on their opponents.
---
So yeah CCP fucked the game so deep with the injectors + rorquals + keepstars combo that i doubt we'll ever get out of this rorqual meta, but goons aren't helping when promoting the spodbrain way of life. Game mechs are broken and the only counterpower that we have as players is in the hand of the alliance abusing those same mechanics. Do you see how we're fucked? :( 
---
5 billion ISK for excavators, but sweet fuck all for a tank.
---
Friends.... you mean potential ENEMIES! 
---
Nah haha, I've run out of friends to invite to eve for the moment, starting to feel like a zealot.. 
---
You can't complain about cows whilst at the same time complaining about inflation.  Inflation, specifically T2, is due to moon goo price increases, which is itself due to the lack of cows grazing on moons. 
---
Look at the price of the damavik. That was a ship that saw no real use and the price still stayed quite high. That is because the price just reflects the cost of production. The price is falling because these ships are still not being used despite their strength because the price is simply more than enough people are willing to pay. If they ever do see regular fleet use, the price would go sky high, because you simply can't hop in a rorq, go mine, reprocess some minerals, and bang out a thousand of them the way you could a corm.
---
We see what happened when they updated the chat code. 
---
42
---
Ooh thanks, they weren't there when I checked yesterday! Must have missed it
---
Why is that an argument in favour for a huge timer? That lone person gets the notification, rushes back and if they get dicked by a larger group, such is Eve.
---
What are we leaving in a depot that *needs* to be there for 24 hours with a 100% guarantee? Seeding stuff for murder tomorrow? Why shouldn't a proficent group actively managing their space be able to preempt that? Would it be worthwhile buying the shiny one and making the best safe you can?
---
Just a thought experiment, all ideas are on the table.
---
Sounds like fantasy scenario. In any realistic conditions i can imagine retris/hyenas/garmurs will assess situation and either stay and slay kikis or get out while kikis are landing.
---
Speaking of frigate fights, starting dps is much more important than post-spool dps. As an example - my retri starts at 321 dps with xray (and it is survivable enough to stay in xray range), shield kikis - at 258 or 289 with mystic depending on fit.
---
It only penalizes the people who cannot afford skill injectors and it literally is P2W.
---
There's a reason why we moved away from clone insurances and backups......
---
You appreciate that the Triglavian ships do not scale well with fleet size, and this is one of the baked in anti-proliferation balance factors?
---
You also surely appreciate that Triglavian ships have a max reach of about 60 km, unlike every other race's dual weapon systems, which puts them bottom of the pile vs dedicated mid- and long-range battleship fleets?
---
They're all in on brawly smaller fleets with heavy presence of logistics, almost crippled by 1 range-scripted TD and neutered by 2, never mind increased effectiveness of ECM in disrupting their dps over non-ramping DPS ships. You're comparing them inside their strongest niche and complaining they're powerful there. Show me how they do vs arty machs at 50k, or rail megas at 100k.
---
To address Triglavian logi, the Rodiva and Zarmazd don't scale beyond 1-2 in a gang of ~10 total, because it just becomes more efficient to bring logi-legion(s) with dual prop guards. So again, powerful in a niche where you are comparing them to options like 100mn-fit medium complex remote rep Oneiros, or a t3 logi in falloff, but clearly inferior when you're comparing 5 of them to a Guardian wing.
---
WRT the Kikimora, you're comparing a faction destroyer (the first of its kind) to a t1 basic destroyer, of course there is going to be a power discrepancy. As others have pointed out, it is more reasonable to compare it to a t3d, and there it has clear tradeoffs for its higher eventual damage, like being really squishy.
---
But it turns out noone would invade, because randomly invading a powerbloc in null is a great way to lost all those supers and get thrown back to low or high sec
---
My corp has more rorq and vexor bots than many alliances. Nuff said.
---
Proof of the insidious nature of killboards. Instead of making a last stance, press their heels on the ground and die fighting, they commit insurance fraud to avoid a red mark on a 3rd party site.
---
Then we complain about there being no fights in EVE.
---
I mean it makes sense to learn to train. It's not like you start off on rocket science in kindergarten. 
---
Eve becomes more and more casual every year lol.
---
Now I'm not saying learning skills is a good thing, but in general why I fell in love with Eve is because of it's harsh and unforgiving nature. That's why Eve is Eve and Wow is Wow.
---
Shitty mechanics != hard
---
I mean, I guess. It's not like you lose supers a lot. For most people, its gonna take them longer to get a new super than to retrain the skills.
---
Wtf though how was the fort net even able to take care of these guys?
---
&gt; I could type at length but I am very certain that history will show that skill injectors are both the worst decision CCP Games has ever made, and likely the worst development decision they will ever make.
---
Yeah rorqs and injectors. I was on the fence about injectors at first, but somehow I forgot everything I knew about EVE Online when rorqs came out and thought that cheap minerals would make people start happily fighting with BCs/BSs and Dreads again.
---
&gt; E2: somehow 18 comments in, no one has bothered to actually answer the hypothetical. Armchair space generals seem to be lacking in eutz
---
Yeah, I don't think people aren't that interested in speculating when there's real shit going down all the time.
---
Literally no Data, Links to any sources, or Visuals.
---
5/10.
---
"blackops bridge some leshaks" you can't.
---
"If you can kill something expensive with something cheap something Is fucky."
---
WHAT? That is litterally EVE...
---
&gt;That lone person gets the notification, rushes back and if they get dicked by a larger group, such is Eve.
---
But you don't get a notification if someone reinforces your depot. You'll have to log in every two days and fly to it to see if it's reinforced.
---
&gt;What are we leaving in a depot that *needs* to be there for 24 hours with a 100% guarantee? 
---
Because you can't expect people to be able to be on OnCall duty for a computer game round the clock. Corporations and alliances can do that, but not individuals. 
---
I talked about the kinds of stuff I have personally stored in them in another comment in this thread.
---
shit i can't stop laughing :D ... 
---
Zimbabwe's national treasure perhaps
---
Theres a graphic effect that turns the drone mining lasers off so it looks like they are just floating around the astroid. 
---
Do you get any notifications that they minned ore?
---
Well at that time, we didn't have injectors ;)
---
You realise that the single TD with 60% penalty cancels the Trig gun ramp, and you can do the same thing again with a second one if they didn't come close enough the first time? You appreciate you can pulse the TD to achieve this effect, which unnoticed keeps the pilot at range doing initial dps?
---
Your initial post comes across as poorly considered, 1v1 ship comparisons don't ever scale well to the broader context of the game, especially not with Trig ships when scaling up so drastically diminishes time to kill, the extension of which is what allows the dps numbers you're calling unreasonable.
---
Okay, but T3C skill loss was also factored as an economic risk into their power. Removing SP loss means logically, they should receive a nerfing pass.
---
It's also not in CCP's interest as a disproportionate amount of skill injector use is for that or capitals, and injectors require extractors which are revenue through plex.
---
so you want 100 titans cyno in, DD any structure and make it pop in 10 seconds?
---
This please
---
&gt; You have 1 Titan, 10 Supers, 30 Dreads, 10 Fax.
---
Garst, is this you?
---
Yeah but thats several Months and several ISKies to set up properly.  
---
Nothing some highsec Miners / Missionrunners can do on a whim in a day or two.
---
You need huge liquid ISK to PLEX several accounts and get them Implants on top of Extractors.  
---
Rich fatcats get even richer with that.   
---
All you guys tell us its so much revenue if you got a AP farm set up.  
---
Then why didn't you start yet?
---
Because noone wants to invest and go into minus for several months until your first profit, many people play it down since its so "easy" to make money with SP farms but they forgot the fact that you need to be established in this game before you can start this business.  
---
So you better have your own Rorqual(s) / Supercarrier in SOVnull or solo Dreadnought in c6, that takes some time to achieve of you dont buy yourself into the game.
---
SP farm are better than PI and just as afk.  
---
But they need way more seed funding to begin with.  
---
Yes, please yes.
---
just don't let them be able to dd structures
---
Losing any ship penalises the people who can't afford to lose it. SP is just another ISK cost. Not any more p2w than anything else.
---
Dreadbombs haven't been an effective counter to supercapitals for a long time now.
---
Would you care to quote the part of my post where I made a connection between inflation and spacecows?
---
No Sir, you are in error. I made no such connection. Bots and power creep cause inflation. Spacecows cause nerfing and lack of exciting gameplay. Like their earthly bovine equivalent, spacecows also stand around chewing cud and looking stupid. I do however imagine they would be satisfying to hunt down and destroy.
---
You know range rigs stack with tracking computers right?
---
No warp to 0 and impossibility to bookmark anything bellow 15km from a gate would bring so much salt in the universe!
---
So instead of max few bigger cap engagements per month and maybe 1 bigger super/titan engagement per year we will so even less of those?
---
I dont know abut others but I get most of my facts form the internet.
---
I agree there is no point In it anymore
---
You probably got trapped into your own argument here. The ferox is not that amazing of a ship but just very good for its price and easy to fc and thus used widely in trade-focused battles. Provided there is no bombers to annihilate your ferox blob you only need to kill a few sabres to be cost effective which will never be the case of trig ships. It is true though that if trig ships could fit a locus rig they would probably be strong in fleet combat as they would achieve the necessary range while having superior tank, speed, utility and even tracking. They would share with the ferox the very strong ability to annihilate tackling trash that isn’t properly achieved by other bcs, BS class damage and be able to still track at 0. They would still be worse than hacs against capitals and bombs and not cost effective to trade with but could definitely be somewhat relevant. But not much more than say sleipnirs. 
---
Well 100 titans damage fitted at 20k x 100 = 2M damage per second.
---
A keepstar has 27M shield + 20% Resis makes it 32,4M Shield EHP.
---
A keepstar is rf‘d in 16-17 seconds .. sure prob. A good idea 
---
I totally agree on that, there should be a SERIOUS skill penalty for losing caps (or at least supers), however, I totally disagree on removing t3c skill loss as those ships are still super overpowered as in can be bridged through blopses while being high DPS / Tank / logi ships and being extremely effective as links and long range tackle (Loki and Proteus)
---
LNAW have too much money, Hy been keeping all that snuffed out tax money :(
---
nope
---
So much salt!
---
Good job brother! 
---
I wouldn't pvp in a polarized fit... The main use for that is popping NPC haulers.
---
16-17 seconds in 10% tidi, repair timer is in real time
---
And yes, we ned less keepstars in EVE
---
I, too, want Goonswarm Federation to descend upon any keepstar in the game and RF it inside of a minute. This will be healthy for the game.
---
I don't know the description, it's just commom knowledge from what the devs have said over the years. 
---
Depots are the smallest possible 1 man temporary sort-of base.
---
Better have a fleet of your own Titans ready to defend on that Armor timer?
---
&gt; Losing any ship penalises the people who can't afford to lose it. SP is just another ISK cost. Not any more p2w than anything else.
---
I don't think you really thought that through completely. Losing a ship is a constant in Eve, that's literally what this game is based on. Losing a ship and additionally sp increases the const by a big factor.
---
Losing a T3C, that is not shit and not too bling fit, will run you about 1.6-2.5b, now add 2-4 skill injectors onto that cost and you get the true price tag of that T3C. A player with lower SP points will have to spend less actual money on restoring that lost SP compared to someone with higher SP. This isn't a big problem, the problem is in actual money spent - a player that is not willing to pay for skill injectors will have to either be penalized and can probably not fly their T3C at all due to fitting requirements and subs. So the player that gladly pays for skill injectors will have a huge advantage over the non-paying player here (since it could be a matter of time - maybe you're in the middle of a fight and the current doctrine requires T3C meta), as they can literally jump into the same T3C seconds after losing one. That is pay to win.
---
You're funny Suitonia! My knee hurts from slapping it so hard. But since I have your ear for a second let me also tell you how much I appreciate the effort you put in to doing what you do. Your theory crafting, your testing on Sisi, your thorough explanation/evaluation of game mechanics and how implementing new things would impact all aspects of the game. Or even just taking the time to patiently answer players that come to you with questions or without complete understanding of certain aspects of the game.
---
You truly do put a lot of effort into being a quality CSM member. So all jokes aside Suitonia, thanks for what you do and keep it up.
---
5 excavs, but no indy core or nexus. lol...
---
but the little guy
---
The next promo, if CCP follows the same schedule as in the past, should be February. But it's unknown if that'll just be a PLEX sale or a DLC sale as well.
---
got'm
---
Yes
---
Had half an injector to an already expensive ship and you get a really overpriced ship for what it does...
---
You seem to imagine a lot don't you.  Why don't you have a go at playing the game for a bit.  Then you won't have to imagine at all.
---
They do provide some fresh air to people ganking unprotected renters out of wormholes but they don’t solve anything to the capital problem. Even if it did, countering out of balance stuff with out of balance stuff is not a healthy approach. This trig thing is gonna fire back into the face of small gang nerds when everyone not flying a super will be in a leshak.
---
No it dosen't. 
---
a) It gives you the option of "paying" by just retraining the skill if you can't afford an injector. 
---
b) Skill injectors are buyable with ISK, so it wouldn't be p2w even if a skill injector was literally part of the building materials. 
---
c) The same could be said for any cost. The monetary cost of T3Cs only penalizes people who can't afford T3Cs, and no one thinks that's bad. 
---
I was generally against skill injectors as a concept, partly because it equalized T3C's cost to mere isk instead of the reshipping cooldown it once was, but given the situation now I can't say SP cost is P2W by itself. 
---
It would be better for the little guy. 
---
It's easier to drop 20 dreads then holding grid against a larger alliance for 30 minutes
---
I kind of did this but opposite.  20 min of me searching for Jira in the Eve map, boy did I feel like a rascal. 
---
From experiences, theres a few things you need to satisfy:
---
1. Player income - EVE is very bottom-up wealth driven at the moment. As an entity that small, you will want to have some kind of sensible arrangement to protect your ISK income, but that does not mean you have to suck a larger entity's dick to survive - NPC null mission blitzers, moon mining, abyssals, and occasional ISK week breaks for incursions in highsec are all viable, and will keep your members satisfied.
---
2. Define yourselves - you need to have a mission statement as to what your alliance is doing. That will become part of your identity. If, for example, you decide you want to be a region destabilizer entity which is focused on destroying the lives of those around you, it makes very little sense for you to try to then arrange good diplomatic terms with them. If you are a PVP driven group, to begin with the less hard-blue entities you live around, the better.
---
3. Engaging content - alliances are not won or lost by good alliance leaders; it is the FCs that are your lifeblood. You need active, popular FCs that your line members enjoy flying with, and those FCs need to be aligned with your alliance mission statement (see 2). Work with them to plan campaigns, etc, but empower them to do what they need to to keep the game fun for them. As a small player you will need to be a lot more dynamic - don't think in 3-6 month campaign plans, think 2-4 week long increments and then make active adjustments.
---
4. Leadership visibility - the worst thing for an active alliance is invisible leadership. Be there with your dudes, interact with them, listen to what their problems are. If you feel value in it, have a monthly Q&amp;A or whatever, just to get their feedback. Remember the alliance is their home as much as it is yours, give your membership a stake in the alliance so they make it their own and value it.
---
5. Stamp out toxicity - differing opinions at all levels, including leadership, is a good thing, but when people start getting toxic, its time to start looking at solving their problem, or if its unsolveable (like a general apathy for CCP or something), then its time to have a big boy chat with them and/or pull the plug on their membership. Negativity and toxicity are infectious and it will quickly drive your members insane to see unhealthy internal conflict.
---
6. Delegate - running alliances takes a LOT of time and energy. Get comfortable with the idea of delegating or you will fast burn yourself out.
---
Yes it’s different. Without new subscriptions/revenue ccp/eve online would fold.  You wouldn’t get to play eve anymore. Eve online MUST continue to draw new players/keep new players.  Veterans and old timers do NOT generate enough subscriptions to
---
enable ccp/parent company to pay the bills/share holders.  So, shut up, do some high sec krabbing and go pew shit.  Also, embrace the newbs they pay rent to Eve so that you can continue playing.
---
Nah.
---
Just add the SP cost to the ship cost and you're done. Any real money paying player will have an advantage on any non paying player whether the cost is just in the ship, in the ship and sp, in the ship, sp and you have to destroy an athanor to be allowed to undock, or if you have to send Jebi a bil before you are allowed out of the system.
---
ISK is ISK and SP is ISK too. There's no reason to make a difference. 
---
Having to rebuy your ship and buy a skill injector doesn't penalise anyone more than having to buy a ship at the cost of the ship plus a skill injector. Also you always lose SP in the skills that are relevant to the t3d you lost and this is another reason why there's absolutely no difference to gameplay compared to the t3d simply costing an injectors worth of SP more.
---
CCP could increase t3d production costs by an injectors worth and the only difference would be the injector penalty reductions at the different SP levels making the wholle process cheaper for players with more SP.
---
&gt; The monetary cost of T3Cs only penalizes people who can't afford T3Cs
---
I would argue that it penalizes the people who can afford T3C different from the one's who cannot afford the true cost of a T3C (incl. injectors). A have to spend money on the sub to train a linear skill queue while B can just buy PLEX and convert to injectors.
---
was just about to say that... since captials are as oppressive now as t3s were back in the days, we might as well implement skill loss for capitals now...
---
&gt; ISK is ISK and SP is ISK too. There's no reason to make a difference.
---
This is exactly what I'm saying. It penalizes the poor guys compared to the rich guys.
---
Why would I drop my dread when I can drop my titan and mandatory FAX alt(s) in this model?
---
Don't use the Depot for storage, use Secure Containers. Containers cant be scanned down; so if you drop them at an unaligned safe you don't have to worry about someone waiting for you.
---
Sure but any other ship loss penalises the poor guy just as much. It's just a more complicated mechanic of ISK loss.
---
If your argument is simply that it costs too much to lose a t3c then fine.
---
You know, I really liked buying and selling things one at a time
---
Snuff can't exactly bitch about lack of content, when they were the ones who have spent the last six months destroying any viable content in Low Sec by dropping titans on anything that wasn't a rookie ship
---
Yup. Make marauders great ~~again~~
---
E - let’s be honest they never been great
---
If you add in a skill injector block when retraining skills lost to ship death, i'm sold
---
how should this kill dreadbombs? how should super forces become untouchable? just inject like every t3c pilot would have to if he dies..!?
---
*fewer
---
&gt; making supers/titans immune to fax reps, and possibly NSA carriers as well.
---
Now this is an interesting idea.  Maybe say that because of their increased surface area they receive reps less efficiently and have a debuff on how much rep power they receive from a fax.
---
we need *more* caps dying
---
I think more subcap fleets would not be horrible. 
---
Etherium reach
---
My buffer Drek has 1250 dps and 156k who tank for 650m. So...it's power is slightly more insane than OP said xD it's better than most armor T3s at, I think.
---
You are too kind, instead all gates should have a 15KM permanent bubble around them... 30KM for regional gates.
---
I'd take 1-3 by autistically entosising with bifrosts every day and spamming raitarus weekly until whoever owns it rn kills themselves irl.
---
this doesnt have anything to do with sp-loss or anything.
---
it has to do with risk averse players. who only rat under their umbrella.
---
players who form giant coalitions instead of shooting eacht others. combined with shitty game-mechanics.
---
I have Sir. I have also been in null sec and been blown apart repeatedly. I do not regret the experience.
---
On the other hand you Sir, have been called out for attempting to misrepresent what I said, and finding yourself in error, rather than apologizing as is your due debt, have resorted to the lowest sort of condescending nonsense as contained in your last post.  Given this demonstration of your bovine-tier intellectual demeanor I would conclude then you are most likely of the spacecow variety. 
---
After 13 years playing the game:
---
The good:
---
1) Servers performance. Yeah still bad in the 3k-5k people battles but way better then it was.
---
2) Graphics. So beautifull still
---
3) The sand box. Still working as intended.
---
The Bad:
---
1) Sov system. It's a joke. Needs a complete revamp
---
2) Super proliferation. Needs to stop. Maybe instead of super BPO's, we start to have super's BPC's.
---
3) Isk inflation. When I started to play losing a BS or a HAC hurted. Now people destroy supers for fun.
---
&gt; "blackops bridge some leshaks" you can't.  
---
i was not aware of that, well you can still titan bridge em 
---
&gt; WHAT? That is litterally EVE...  
---
yes, maybe, but the isk gap is just way to massive in an [insured dreadbomb] vs [titan] scenario, its almost 0 risk for the dread pilots
---
thx fc
---
lowest it got was 30% or so I'm told
---
Yeah, so adding SP loss on capitals to risk averse players is going increase the chance of them using capitals or decrease it?
---
Just remove the timer, full stop.
---
I argued above that evicting evictors doesn't make you a good guy.
---
&gt; T3c is op af
---
what are capitals then? insane dps, insane tank, can teleport to anyhting within 7ly at any second. are used in comical numbers nowadays.
---
one could say, as oppressive as t3c's were back in the days. so, since t3s are to op caps should get a even higher sp loss right?
---
a 2 week block timer on skill injectors after loosing a supercap? a new kind of space aids... yea i like that 
---
Fozzie thought this was a good mechanic. 
---
Because it adds another level of cost to the shi.
---
Really makes you think.
---
Nah, snuff takes too much of an interest with an init batphone
---
Flying your replacement titan for 4 or 5 weeks with Titan 4 doesn't really change anything.
---
I have a friend who has an issue with randomly capitalizing words in the middle of sentences
---
I don't harp on it because I want to tear him down, I do it because a message poorly transmitted is often poorly received 
---
I don't want to argue with you on the basis of your spelling or grammar, I want to do it based on the merits of your positions
---
but when you spell absurdity with an O someone should let you know, and I'd trust you or someone else here to do the same for me
---
That is a two year old article.
---
Well, go for it. Why not? Eve is a sandbox.
---
HELLO I'M MAKING A COMMENT
---
Find a weak carebear group (like banderlogs), cloaky camp and hunt them till you break their will, mop them up
---
GL with supers, lol. Too many blobs 
---
What a load of rubbish. Best players I have met in any MMO are from Eve.
---
Been playing pretty much non-stop  since 2010
---
Game near dumpster, but pretty sure you'll be able to technically login and play 5 years from now. Main reason: turbonerds who made shit happen in the past in their 30s now and dont play, no new potential turbonerds, cause online gaming landscape changed a lot and there are plenty other options.
---
(CCPs recent moves/lack thereof doesnt help as well)
---
Like everything else you get the right skills and items ...  
---
I'm a bit confused about the question.  
---
But let's get a bit into detail: The reprocessing skills of ores are under "Resource Processing": [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Skills:Resource\_Processing](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Skills:Resource_Processing)  
---
You can either buy the ores or mine them yourself. The "ORE" ships are meant for mining, if you are Omega, Mining Barges are a quick learn.  
---
To actually build your own stuff you will need industry skills (found under "Production") and the blueprints. You can either buy the needed materials or use your reprocessing skills on your mined ores.    
---
Building structures is a bit more effort, needing more parts to be bought or produced first.  
---
Will probably need more than just minerals (reprocessed ore) like salvage and PI.  
---
To actually anchor the structure you need again extra skills. Never done that, so no idea if you can do it on your own or need to be in a player corp.  
---
Running a structure will cost you fuel. A structure can then be fitted like basically a ship, with service and other modules, depending what structure you have.  
---
A bold plan and unlikely to succeed if you do it just on your own.  
---
Good luck and fly safe.
---
just like no1 is flying t3s nowadays because of sp loss right?
---
I think that's pretty interesting, and it's less broken, at least at a glance
---
except the big guy then refs every single structure that he little guy has in 1 day
---
But why add something that in no way makes it better but has the potential to make the situation even worse?
---
so 1000000 dps of 100 titan guns is just fine right?
---
caps don't matter if you have the stamina and the autism to endure weeks of fozziesov to hold the space
---
most larger groups do not, notable exceptions being tapi and goons
---
the only thing you might need to worry about is keeping a staging citadel anchored, but that's only a problem if you move in somewhere adjacent to hostiles who might try to evict you
---
This is a good post.
---
**my plan tl;dr: move to npc null, get used to live there, make friends, kill stuff, get first sov from/with these friends.**
---
I would start by two assumptions:
---
- it is not specified in the post that we need to claim sov,
---
- the backbone of the alliance is composed of relatively young players, based on the capital numbers.
---
Based on this,
---
I would lead the group first to NPC null, to allow time to my dudes to get used to nullsec. They could learn how to travel safely, how to create/maintain a trade hub with contracts for us, how do bubbles work, and how does one gatecamp effectively in null. Isk-wise a logical step for a lot of them would be to run missions.
---
The preference of the group would also matter a lot in selecting the region. For example, if the alliance is bloodthirsty, we could move in the neighborhood of a sov entity we don't like. If the alliance has for example a past in FW, and for example their standings are ruined for a pirate faction, it is not a good idea to move there.
---
Titans and supers would be not coordinated in these numbers, their owners can do with them what they want. They can leave them in lowsec, or drop them around as they please. I guess the titan owner is maybe an old founding member or the rl father of a pilot in the alliance.
---
Me being the alliance leader, we would keep up a gatecamp 23/7, which would be the main activity of the corp. If some dude would like to take out a roam, they could figure out a few cheap cruiser/destroyer/idkwhat fits. Blops bomber fishing and baiting would be also encouraged. We would also go back to highsec occassionally to gank.
---
I would ask for someone in the alliance who has ever put a buy order in the market (I haven't since I registered in 2013) to coordinate manufacturing, trading and stuff. I guess I already have a few dudes doing this work instead of me. People should also train into a few doctrines while living in NPC null, especially gatecamping and hotdropping and baiting ships.
---
Making memes and propaganda would be encouraged, alliance would pay for good memes before we would start up the SRP system.
---
After a short time in, we can start making possible good relations with some entities. We would use these friends to ask for sov, ask for support sov claim, or backstab them for sov.
---
why not remove something that is outdated and definetly not necessary anymore compared to earlier days?
---
but he had a Templar II...
---
The big guy can roll over the little guy anyways, its literally just 30 mins of uncontested reffing that will be different.
---
Yes.
---
Clearly not, you still wanting to fly them seems to me to warrant the SP penality risk. They also still feature heavily in zkill kills and losses so I am not sure why the sp loss needs changed.
---
This is why you don't type the first thing that comes into your head
---
Maybe someone rolled them all? :)
---
Not that i would know who it was... just saying
---
\^\^ this
---
COST IS NOT A BALANCING FACTOR. You can lose a T1 battleship to a fleet of T1 frigates. You can lose a Marauder to a few hurricanes and scythes.
---
Titans are the end game. If you own a Titan you should be able to afford to lose a Titan. If you own a Titan you should have the means to call support or provide it yourself.
---
\&gt; Blackops bridge some leshaks.
---
K
---
Why do you need the source? He posted the entire article here dude. Eve is in serious trouble now. Ccp if going to get all kinds of scrutiny in the media and by govts now. 
---
The griefer days are numbered!!!!
---
The meta would have been perfect if everyone would playing it, it's the same shit than Casino, only one side used it and look what the result were
---
excuse me smart players keep them in the freezer so they don't rot.
---
Upaluminar'd
---
Dude the study proves we're mostly douchebags. Can't argue against it anymore
---
Saying this with your comment history lol
---
You're in denial
---
Even if you roll all of them at once, which is impossible, new connection will spawn.
---
They weren't obligatory, just for those who wanted to invest the time in the skills &amp; game. Many people trained them up to level 3 maybe and then carried on with other skills.
---
Funny when a mouth breathing retard, who knows nothing about the situation posts on reddit.
---
Shhhh. Some folks are eating the onion. Let's egg then on
---
I want to marry this comment.
---
Say it louder
---
Start with provi and go from there
---
It's literally the entire article man. Wtf. Stop being in denial- it's official that most eve players are the scum of the mmo world
---
Since this article is obviously not scientific, can wr use this opportunity to conduct a quick survey?
---
I have 3 heads in my fridge and I'm an Eve player. How many do you have an what is your primary MMORPG?
---
Which hurts the game even more because they make multiple rorq mining alts and then get burnt out on the game! Seen the same thing happen with a dude who started a skill farm. 
---
hehe rofl lol
---
The triglavian ships arent "faction", theyre considered t1 (it doesnt have the green icon in the window to indicate its faction either).
---
The Kiki doesnt show up under navy/pirate, it shows up under precursor. They are a whole new race. As "faction" ships still retain all the normal weapons available, trigs have a brand new weapon system that is unique to themselves.
---
They also have a t1 and t2 logi. No pirate or navy ship (outside of AT ships) have logi ships, let alone a t1 and t2 version.
---
The way the kiki and trig stuff is setup is theyre a whole new race, everything that we have seen so far from CCP and triglavian has been t1 (except Tiamat and zarmzawhatever).
---
This is why the vedmak and damavik feel very subpar. Its just farming mats for them havent fully caught up to demand and the "ooh shiny" factor, which is why their pricing is still so high.
---
And, in typical CCP fashion, a new thing is introduced to generate hype and a new FOTM. So, by nature, CCP releases these things a little OP to start off with.
---
gib fit!
---
To be fair, I've only been subbed to Eve again for a few weeks, so I missed those threads here, not being a part of the cimmunity.
---
I got 4 heads, not counting the animal heads that I started with first as a test. Counting them,I got 9.
---
Ha. Would probably make more people play the game tbh. 
---
Yours are easy to miss anyways.
---
Is Loki a viable solo null ship. Mainly want to fly it around and pop ratters and get some solo/small gang fights in.  Not finding much current information and I know T3s have changed some since the last time I played. For what it’s worth, I would be flying it as a gun boat not a missile boat simply due to how my skills are currently. 
---
never get outtttttt
---
CCP rise/fozzie doing the balancing(?), so its not surprising.
---
What? They've been severely buffed.
---
I didn't misrepresent what you said.  Here's what you said:
---
"It also become rapidly obvious that Eve is suffering rampant inflation. In part due to bots and in part due to power creep.  ...And this movement in Eve, it seems towards feeding the carebears. FUCK THE CAREBEARS! FUCK THEM!"
---
You exclaimed reeeeeeeeeeeeeeee and something about "carebears".  Anyway, as you seem to be slightly unhinged, I'll probably block you.
---
Nah mate I cant take a carrier or dread into the most heavily fortified nullsec in eve and make myself into a solo pinprick in the arse. I'd last a few minutes at best.
---
Ever since I got to know of supers in Eve I've basically this lol. Caps should be cap games and structures, not cap vs subcaps.
---
What’s your point? Everything described in it still applies.  Maybe Wicked Creek isn’t the spot nowadays, but there’s so much unused sov space that these tactics will work.  
---
&gt;I mean it makes sense to learn to train. It's not like you start off on rocket science in kindergarten. 
---
Yeah eve should have k through 12 and community college and a real University... Then we should have to make resumes and apply for jobs etc.
---
We should also include food- it's not like we can survive without food in real life.
---
And breathing. 
---
God, eve is such a poor simulation of real life. It's totally shitty.
---
/S
---
What they need to do is put every last penny that they have to keep the servers running, or just leave it up to the community to keep the servers running. But so far CCP seems do be doing rather well financially. I wonder when there will be a point that CCP can no longer exist, and they have to shut the servers down forever.
---
&gt; loud and obnoxious
---
Perfect description of TEST tbh.
---
Because this basically splits the community in different parts anyway:
---
One, that is using them and not caring about SP loss, as they obviously have nothing to skill anymore, so reskilling some days again and again and again and again is not a big deal for them.
---
One that is using them and pays for injectors. So they care even less.
---
One that is not using them at all as SP loss is off the table for them.
---
One that is not using them for any dangerous activity (like me for example). So pve with it is ok, cloaky, nullified, travel fit when gates, and still cloaky but good in dps in sites, but ready to warp out as soon something might be too dangerous. Which makes that group also a "SP loss, not with me"
---
I am sure, whoever loses a T3, is probably not like "oh yeah baby, now comes that sweet loss of my propulsion skill V ... awesome"
---
I’ve gotten less time to play now but even then I don’t want to login unless my fam needs me. 
---
Citadels suck and the tz tanking that comes with it. Citadel proliferation needed to be limited by constellation. The total removal of passive moon income killed some methods of content and made it almost worthless or more difficult to make content out of the moon mining now. 
---
I stick around for the people but the fact I’ve spent so much time here, it’d be tough to go cold turkey. In fact I tried but here I am. 
---
I think I would go for one of the drone regions that are full of renters or cloud ring. Or setting up shop in NPC space around GOTG sov and farming them seems like a good idea.
---
Maybe don't fly a garbage fit and you wouldn't die to a single dread?
---
Its amazing after all this time and the addition of actual interesting PvE mechanics (Wormholes, Abyssal) that the most encountered and farmed PvE is still the terrible belt/anom/site rats that are the same old grind over and over again.
---
CCP could of worked on the actual basic PvE encounters such as missions and anoms to make them more engaging but instead they just roll out new stuff only a small portion of the player base uses.
---
That is probably my biggest frustration over the years. If CCP put the time in to make missions more fun, varied, and rewarding as well as making anoms/sigs more varied it would do a lot to improve all areas of space. This would in turn attract players who play to enjoy the PvE content and hopefully leads them into PvP as well.
---
This is where our tax payer money goes to? What a joke. Aint that right? "Talks to one of the rotting heads from the skull mount in the attic"
---
I would say with injectors and sp farms 7 cant see a reason why a single class should lose sp 
---
Great because it doesn't take forever to travel anywhere in this game.
---
all the things you said make no difference to what i was arguing. he said the leshak tanks more than the rattle, he is wrong. If you are defending him you are also wrong. I am not arguing which ship is better of which has which strongsuits, but to argue that the leshak has even comparable tank to a rattlesnake is completely asinine.
---
Depends... you can lose all dreads without killing the titan. You can't generalize engagements like that.
---
\-Supers can only use heavies and tackle etc.
---
\-Fix long range heavies so they are crap against subcaps
---
\-You need to bring normal carriers to a fight to provide the lights and SS
---
I mean have you been to a trade hub? When the the depo "art" is bad in jita it causes me to lag so I would consider it a problem.
---
I wouldn't have a issue with a 2 day timer if the item cost more then the low price of 1.2mil item. If it was 2 days for a yurt mobile depo to come out that's a lot more reasonable since your spending 58.3 times as much isk.
---
Jokes on you, i dont even have a basement.
---
Testbros , selling horde vouch really cheap. You can get your srp dread and jump it directly to a horde keep. Free cynos 
---
Well, they already got a nerf. Isn't that what OP says?
---
That's quite intresting actually I haven't ran any lvl 5s in quite a while I'll read up on it thank you
---
This is the worst bait troll post I have seen here for a while *sigh*
---
Some gave me head once, does that count
---
Yeah because it will prob. Kill the tapi or goon keepstars .. it’s not like they support each other as soon as someone could lose
---
Useful comment 
---
It worked for pos so yes
---
You could go off my forum posts. You could go off my podcast appearances. You could go off my discord discussions. You could actually, you know, talk to me or talk to anybody who actually knows me.
---
On the other hand abundance gives us far more capacity to yolo shit around. The downside risk on dropping a big fleet isn't just isk loss, it's the morale damage and the chance of being evicted because you lost war-critical strategic assets. 
---
From the game's inception, the most """efficient""" strategy has always been to park yourself in a backwater region and krab until the end of time. But it's not until after the rorq changes that major alliances (goons, then PL and soon everyone) started looking at this as the one and only right way to play nullsec. 
---
there is a reason there are entire groups who meme about 'rolling back to 2012'
---
literally thousands of people noticed a huge shift at CCP that started favoring the dumb over the smart
---
That's why they did it to pos's all the time! /s
---
&gt; panic form a response fleet
---
mfw only rorquals use MTUs
---
I like the idea to break MTU mechanics for the general public by focusing only in the flavour of the month problem. I don't use MTUs anyways.
---
Idea: subcaps can target individual modules on a cap.  Destroying the module would remove/cancel the effects gained by the module - so you could lower the targets HP, damage output, speed, ability to siege, boost cap etc. Killmails for destroying a cap-module and of course the loser has the cost of replacing their modules. 
---
They provide shortcuts all over known space, allowing groups to hunt and engage in conflict in regions which would otherwise be geographically unreachable
---
A POS is not the same as a keepstar, or astrohouse for that matter, that being said low power should not have damage caps
---
Presumably my pilot would have learned that shit while they were receiving an insanely expensive education and cybernetic upgrades at the school of applied studies.
---
Yes but only after a long period of time (hours), how long was your hole short like that?
---
Well, that's the thing. If CCP nerfs rorquals, it doesn't just nerf Goons -- it nerfs *everyone.* This means that since we've been using rorquals more than everyone combined twice over, we will have that many more titans banked, and the game will have been changed to not allow anyone else to even meaningfully approach that number.
---
So, y'know, we'd grumble, but a solid, actually uncontestable advantage like that is something we'd take.
---
If you don't want to be bullshitter you need to back up your claims. Anyone can say anything, without proof it means nothing.
---
Show the 50% you bullshitter.
---
Supers don't really have a viable subcap counter given their ability to apply 10k dps perfectly from anywhere in the grid, but they're way better than titans. Hell, against a superfleet you can show up in a corm fleet + booshers and probably get a lot of fighter frags or something. With titans, there's no point even being on grid unless you're bringing your own titan blob (which is heavily dis-incentivized because the risk of losing it is so much greater than any possible strategic objective). 
---
It's a shame in wh space we can't have a 30 vs 30 without desync and lag
---
Little guy gets fucked just as hard now it just takes 29mins longer.
---
I don't think it was a nerf. Rather their role changed so that a stagnant fight meta of 500k ehp legions and such were no longer dominant. Right now they are pinnacle covops hunters as well as extremely strong solo and smallgang shops, and retain a healthy niche in the fleet meta.
---
Some, like the Loki in particular, are significantly stronger than any other alternative in these roles and can be regarded as borderline in some of them.
---
During the design of this pass, SP loss was frequently cited as a reason to make these ships more rewarding in order to balance risk. I think that has succeeded, but if that element of risk is removed those balance decisions should be reexamined is all.
---
T3Cs need a pass anyway, just comparing the different T3Cs it's evident that some of them are much weaker than others. Slot layout on the Proteus, for example.
---
Thank you for being a self-demonstrating article. Seeing you flaunt your hurt feefees for everyone to see is an absolute joy!
---
trash
---
Atleast that's something I can get behind.
---
Yes, the loki is extremely viable.
---
passive tank + 720mm howitzers is my personal favorite, you can shine it for a huge tank, or do it on the cheap. 
---
But you can do quite an  effective covops 720 fit with xlasb + LSE. but it's expensive.
---
then you can do 100mn + huge active tank with auto cannons. 
---
or you could go for something more classical and just do a 50mn ac boat.  
---
Download pyfa and start fiddling, the loki has many many viable possibilities. 
---
You are correct, and they certainly stretch the existing defintion of t1. I think comparing them to standard 4 empire t1 is a fooles errand though, as by nature of their weapon they don't reflect the original design philosophy of bonuses/slot layout, rather than restrictions, dictating fitting choices (while a single tachyon on a leshak would be meme-worthy, it's not even remotely comparable to an AC abaddon in viability, for example).
---
I'm assuming from the predominance of my post that you didn't comment on, that you either agreed or found the points unobjectionable.
---
To reply about Vedmak and Damavik:
---
Vedmak has subpar fitting - if you stay with t2/t1 meta mods the vedmak needs at least one ACR, often two to fit anything appropriately sized in the high slots with a prop mod and rep+800mm/dual rep/1600mm, and the CPU is very tight on top of this.
---
Damavik suffers from the same lack of PG and CPU, with a bias towards utility high slots to make up for missing slots elsewhere proving useless in most configurations because it doesn't have the fitting to use them. A basic 5mn/disruptor/MSE fit requires both a MAPC and a t2 overlocking rig to fit, and still can only use one of its utility highs. Only if you go for the current meta of triple bulkhead rig, can you barely squeeze on 1mn/scram/web and use both utility highs.
---
I would also point out that both trig cruisers currently don't keep their racial mass advantage over other those of other factions, which is a further disfavouring factor if you're comparing them vs HAC/T3/Gila etc for WH use.
---
Not just useless vs. subs - *vulnerable* to something. 
---
This is why I advocate fax removal (or make supers fax-immune). Atm there's no counter to a titan/fax blob except bringing your own, bigger one. That's really bad for the game and suppresses fights (because there's no point taking any fight that might escalate, unless you're able &amp; willing to commit your whole supercap fleet, which it's very rare for both sides to be willing to do). 
---
If supers could be reliably killed by something else, they'd make for a solid "endgame goal" ship but wouldn't be nearly as big a cancer on sovwars, and it'd ease up the "super umbrella" complaints. 
---
I'd vote no.
---
Its bad enough having to witness N+1 fleets of HACs and Battleships.
---
Depends the timezone and just how big and tight of a comp the 500 members can form for a subcap fleet.  Also lets assume you aren't going to bend the knee to a major entity and get "help" taking sov.
---
Lets assume you can form fleet sizes of 50-150 subcaps max, loose comp.
---
I'd probably target an area with a smaller, fractured lineup that is adjacent to null/low.
---
MKAD (Circle of Hell) is the probable target I'd make.  I would start off with a general campaign of small ship entosis once or twice a day throughout cache and round the clock blops of some of their renters in both cache and outer passage.  
---
assuming wallet is fairly limited, I would run primarily cruiser and sniping destroyer comps for the roaming and entosis fleets.   To generate timers on structures, I would use a distributed vexor bashing comp, with t1 sentries dropped in a spread around a fortizar (heavies if no PDS).  for initial structures I would try to keep it within titan bridge range so that reinforcements can flood back with cheap ships.  Would definitely limit the fits to meta/t1 - 1b of those goes a long way.
---
for morale, I would stress winning the isk war, as losing 10 cruisers would come a the same cost of killing 1 sabre.  Would primarily target out of position and suicidal tackle in more nano, kiting based comps.  Biggest issue would be avoiding gate bosons.
---
Step one for me.would figure out how to sustain the war.
---
You'll need beachheads raitaru ect to spam at the start. Mabee stage from. Lowsec.
---
Make sure you can afford continued losses and concentrate your efforts. And look for pinch points in entries and jump ranges.
---
Mabee solitude?
---
Been a while but it's usually dead?
---
But then why move to a dead area? 
---
Honestly titans need a heavy buff in my opinion. I wouldn't mind seeing them become what you bring to murder titans
---
praise bob!

On [Molea II Moon I](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/Molea/II-Moon-1) is a cementry POS. CCP has switched of the despawning of anchored containers around it so the memorials stay there.
---
What would make more people play the game? If griefers left the game?

Man I'd take losing prop v once. I am at like 3 or 4 losses with all 5s and they have all been offense or defense so it's a huge hit to effectiveness. Can we just get a like 1 day train skill that you need to fly them that you lose so I don't have to spend 3 or 4 days training just to get my dps back?
---
PB / Fade / Cloud Ring has huge empty spaces in it. Wouldn't be hard for a group of 500 to end up in space in those areas. If you were able to talk to GOTG to the north and Init to the south and arrange NIPs, you could occupy everything between them, except for the Banderlogs bit.
---
Of course you'd be displacing Imperium renters in parts of that area so I dunno how you'd go getting a NIP.
---
The reason we don't have more fights and whelps is simple. Most FC's are very vain. They are the type of people who line up to go on streams.  They worry about how many followers they have on social media platforms. Generally they place looking good above all else. They are keen for a brawl but only if the killboard looks attractive for them afterwards. I sit in a discord with most of EVE's FC's where they spend 99% jerking each other off.
---
You pick a side.
---
* Goon and Pets
---
* Alliance of the others
---
Tell them you want to take space. They will probably tell you to become a renter.
---
???
---
You've won EvE because alliance leaders don't need to ask these questions of Reddit, and instead actually figure this shit out on their own.
---
remove dmg cap from low power cits.
---
and consider changing dmg cap to be based on how many people are on grid, to encourage people to defend just to give it dmg cap
---
This is a relative weakness. DPS is only good, if you fight the same shipf for a long time. The larger the gangs you compare, the bigger the weakness.
---
Also in a fight against a large number of cheap, small ships, you are constantly fighting near minimal DPS. How many Cormorants can you fight solo in a Drakavak, how many in a BNI?
---
1 vs. 1, small gang against fewer, bigger ships - here are THE big strengths for the Triglavian ships. If they didn't have a superiority here, they would be dead in the water, certainly not worth their costs.
---
Sure but so would deleting everything but frigates. Both are horrible idea but still
---
They will never be equal amongst themselfes. It's like comparing muninns to sacrileges.
---
I'm not saying they shouldn't have another balance pass. I just think in the rules they as a shipclass currently shine in doesn't need the SP loss as a balance factor.
---
And I doubt we'd see a T3C prevalent meta again just because the SP loss was removed.
---
The CSM doesn't hold veto power over game changes, there, Chauncey.
---
you make a funny, but in all seriousness, increasing the spawn rate in belts, having them target excavators more, and giving them bubbles (along with more and better webs / scrams) would be an amazing improvement.  
---
I read/agreed on your other points. Just wanted to clarify that the kiki/trig ships are not faction, which has been a common misconception.
---
I would say trig stuff is heavily skewed towards abyssal modules. Basically rolling a lot of low fitting mods to bypass the restrictions.
---
It also reinforces the t1 statement. Their power is kept in check by fitting. The kiki, drek and leshak are similar but have more wiggle room for fitting. But again, because those are new, thats just CCP's way of getting FOTM hunters all hyped up. Theyll prob nerf the kiki/drek at some point.
---
The lesh is pretty well balanced IMO.
---
Fun fact: You can get under leshak guns in other battleships. Ive done it twice in my typhoon fleet (it does have a smaller than normal BS sig).
---
I am still searching for that tank mode button on the Kiki ...
---
I think that it is more probable that such an endeavor would fail in the current eve environment.
---
First, the time that the article was written was just after an sov changing war where a long time bloc was forced out and another moved which created specific unused space.  I have never read anyone r/eve or heard anyone on coms talk about the value of Wicked Creek.  So, when this article was written, there was some undesirable space that was open for acquisition.
---
Second, the proliferation of capitals.  The article was written before the Rorq changes.  Back then capitals, supers, and titans were not a regularly used tool in the Nullsec war.  If my memory serves (I am not 100% sure of this) supers and titans were still actively hunted.  Capital forces were still relatively small and not heavily populated in Wicked Creek or anywhere.  A group with a minimal capital force *could* take space and not fear a super capital hammer *at* *the* *time* *this* *article* *was* *written*.
---
Third, the famine that is active content in EvE is diminished and many null groups want an excuse to utilize their blossoming super capital force.  Anyone who tried to take any space any where in EvE would send a signal to any of the current nullsec blocks that active content is to be had.  Sure, fighting over timers sucks but content is content.
---
Severed hands, more likely
---
at one point it was great building them for a decent profit.
---
POS weren't worth 200b+ and didn't represent the pinnacle of infrastructure for an organization.
---
It'll probably attract more griefers. 
---
I don't think we can solve the rorqual meta by adding more rorquals and more capitals to the game bud. It would have balanced the powers on large conflicts maybe, but it wouldn't change a thing on a smaller scale and that's what people see everyday. It's quite discouraging to learn to play a game well for years and get stomped by some mongoloid who facerolls his keyboard :(
---
It's almost like you can make changes to where it's still so without a damage cap.
---
Thanks for the reply. I will look into pyfa. 
---
What are you talking about?
---
In their niche, triglavian ships are very strong - but then so are most 'in-meta' ships.
---
The solo 1v1 situation you described is clearly a niche for triglavian ships, as is the smallgang anti-cap paradigm. However in large scale fleet fights these things compare poorly even to T1 (Non-Faction/Non-Pirate) options before even factoring the increased cost and skillbook cost. 
---
I can't comment on other styles of engagement, but my exposure to these ships has mostly been in heavy-armor wormhole brawls. These fights tend to be in highly tuned and competitive doctrines with significant EWAR and Neut/Nos support on both sides, the latter resulting in a general meta shift away from cap-dependant weapons. The appeal of the damage available from a Leshak/Dreka has tempted some (including us) to field these platforms. However, you have to tailor the fit and support so specifically in order not to be shut down that it's debatable whether it's even worth it as operating near start-of-spool dps is a waste of mass for the fleet that could be used much more effectively elsewhere. 
---
As anyone who has fought us in these ships can attest, our tool of choice for dealing with them is a simple Triple TD Crucifier. This 12m ISK fitted T1 EWAR frigate can sit at 100+km optimal and apply all 3x optimal range TDs and result in optimal ranges (with usual fits, T2 Long Range Ammo) of:
---
 - Leshak 52.9km optimal -&gt; 5.5km optimal
---
 - Dreka 46.9km optimal -&gt; 4.89km optimal
---
 - Kiki 38km optimal -&gt; 3.96km optimal
---
And that's before any links and/or heat is applied with long range ammo, refer to my [previous post](https://redd.it/aewmdv) to see the other tradeoffs for that ammo. Remember that when a ships drifts out of your optimal with a disintegrator it can't cycle and the spool resets.
---
This on top of capacitor warfare and ECM platforms/ECM drones makes resetting these things pretty easy. 
---
TL;DR:
---
Triglavian ships are very strong in their niche, which is solo pvp or small-gang anti-cap warfare. But have major deficiencies against other T1 options in most formal fleet engagements across all types of space.
---
Inotee. Stop posting on reddit from work . You're only upset about skill loss cause you lost like 6 t3s in a row once and were too lazy to retrain.

SP loss only negatively effects swedes who have zero patience and an injector addiction.

Hello, I am new to EVE and i was wondering if someone could point me out to a complex guide for newbies preferably on YouTube. Btw i'm playing on tranquility, Nitrocat Ataru. Thanks.

Yeah but they just stay on fighters you got to keep clicking! Much more interesting.

If his head is now in your fridge, sure!

Yeah I too am attracted to a fanbase that keeps heads in their freezers

Only if you also make subcaps useless against supers and titans.  If you want to kill a super or titan bring your own supers and titans to do it.
---
how do I get involved in this jerking of the off

Here's something I never thought I'd say:
---
I miss station games.
---
Back in scalding pass circa 2015, I was in PFR. It is still some of the most fun I've had in this game. All you had to do is sit on the undock and wait for a small gang to come to you. Sometimes you got farmed (more often than not tbh), but it was still fun.
---
Citadels killed that.
---
In CHAOS, circa 2016/2017, we fought over money moons with snuff every damn day. It wasn't easy, and we lost about as many fights as we won. But it was excellent content, and there was no shortage of it.
---
Citadels killed that too.

Losing a single subsystem is 5 days, losing dread 5 is over a month. Also, noone drops T3 fleets into risky situations.

Skill loss on T3Cs was one of the motivations to inject a few million SP on my high-SP PVP chars during the xmas booster event. I can now lose about 20 T3Cs and instantly re-inject the skill if it's required. And hey, it's only a 4 day train either way so I really don't care very much about the skill loss. 
---
I do agree that it's pretty pointless though and could just as well be removed.

They are speaking about players paying them to play their game.  Preferably more players than less.  That is what advertisements speak of -- sales.
---
Suicide ganking did not exist in its current form a decade ago, not because it could not be done, but because there was no critical mass of players who engaged in it.  Ships have always been ganked in high sec, and can flipping was a thing long before the current suicide gank trend.  One part of the EVE player base has chosen to change the atmosphere of the game in a way that is inimical to the enjoyment of another, much larger, segment of the player base.  As a consequence this segment has shrunk dramatically and those who left now warn others away from EVE.

That really depends if you want to fly things that shoot lasers,missiles, auto/artillery, hybrids or drones. Gunnery skill is useful for all turrets but not missiles, same for rapid firing, sharpshooter, motion prediction. Controlled bursts is more important for lasers and trajectory analysis enhances autocannon the most. Drone skills nearly always a good thing to have unless you dont like micromanagement.
---
Do me a favor:

Open Dotlan.  Type in "Cobalt Edge."  Take a look at the major sov holder.  I'll wait.  Here's a hint: It's Hard Knocks - a wormhole corporation that just had its home razed.  At best, HK can field 40-50 man fleets (not counting multi-boxers).  Right now, as they are rebuilding and trying to salvage what's left of their corp, do you think HK will put up a huge fight for Cobalt Edge?  Even if they do, can they stop OP with 500 dudes?  No, they cannot.  Do the same thing for Oasa.   It's all renters.  No one up there is going to offer real resistance.  
---
It's the drone lands, so it's certainly not prime real estate, but there's a TON of sov for the taking if someone wants it.  If Suitonia and two other guys held Sov against larger groups, OP with 500 motivated guys can definitely do it.  
---
Scalding Pass is dead.  OP could stage in Curse or Great Wildlands and be unevictable while contesting Sov.  
---
Regarding "current nullsec blocks:" Do you really think Goons are deploying to Cobalt Edge to kill OP and his 10 fax machines?  Come on.  That's ridiculous.  Just get out of here with your risk averse nonsense.  
---
There's plenty of space out there for the taking.  All that's required is some logistics, some organization, and a group cohesive enough to take it.  
---
I’m surprise this hasn’t gotten grath to re-sub, lmao.
---
Not my dread lol. I did suggest not using a buffer one lol
---
Excuse you
---
Of course they will not have the same role and characteristic; however, some of them clearly do not have the same usability and are outclassed by others in most capacities.
---
It's like the pre-HAC pass Muninn. There was simply no reason to use it because within its role, there were superior options (Hurricane-Sleipnir-Rupture), while the Sacrilege had a place in the Legion-Damnation heavy armor fleet. The Muninn was not usable due to its midslot layout being insufficient for a shield tank maximizing artillery damage. Similarly, the current Proteus, while not shield, struggles with midslot availability that make things like active armor scramweb very difficult to make happen.
---
On the other hand the covert hunter Loki is extremely versatile and heavily outclasses alternatives in tank, damage, and utility, and even speed for kite fits. Without SP loss, is there *any* reason to use a Stratios over a dualneut Legion other than cost? In an age of carriers and rorqs, a pricing difference of a few hundred million is nothing--inflation will cause the meta to collapse and become stagnant if cost is the only concern.
---
This is what happens when they can't find the undock button.
---
Sadly, this might actually be the best tactic in the current meta. 
---
Agreed
---
Then go take it.
---
Oh, look, it's another person demanding infinite vigilance for anyone who is on the defending side, while he, as the attacker, imposes no such requirement for himself.
---
I mean you're basically describing having other players pop into your belt without local to warn you. But I guess it's less offensive when it's just NPCs.
---
dont make them lose the whole lvl.. just 250k sp like t3s...
---
now dont get me wrong on this. i hate the sp loss and would never ''vote'' for it.
---
in my eyes, its completely retarded to keep it in a game in which you usually learn the most by dying. and especially on hulls on which most of the fits dont work anymore with subskills at lvl4.
---
i just replied with the same answer i get everytime if i speak about sp loss...

What "them"? Use nouns, not pronouns. Do you mean POS or Keepstars? Also, what does this have to do with anything?
---
i started playing in 05, ive been off an on the entire time but mostly on. presciently i do not have an active sub.
---
the game does feel very segmented and controlled in modern day null. everyone has their place carved out. there are less small engagements that do not involve some massive force coming into play these days. having said that the space does still change and there are still good things to do, would just be nice to see some more focous be placed on the smaller gang/corp pvp rather than just the giants.
---
one of the main reasons i let my game sub expire was due to the instability we have seen recently.  from problems loggin in (less common but still annoying) to the constant changes that require a fair amount of work required in relearning new things. dont get me wrong, im all for progression and new content but it feels too... rapid fire, as of late.  add to that the chat system failure and i just got tired of dealing with problems to have fun. 
---
being around for so long ive seen my fair share of problems to work through from expansions and all. this time round it feels different though. maybe its not the case but i feel that its more about pushing 'new' these days with too little focus on making shew the 'new' is good - will function properly - and does not negatively impact positive aspects of the game that are currently there. 
---
You could easily quit your RL job due to that, for example when you are a (low scale employed) lawyer ...
---
We have a winner i guess ...
---
Fake news 
---
which is exciting and prevents afk play.  Not suggesting that NPCs fit cynos :) which is what it takes anyways to players to kill rorqs etc.

---
I assure you, it's incredibly likely without supporting knowledge and experience that your shinny new battleship will meet a similarly brain crushingly quick fate.
---
It might *appear* to be vastly more durable but what the person/people who gank you will likely use, will make short work of it in the same way that engaging 3 or 4 destroyers in a frigate will make for a disappointingly short fight in a majority of engagements.
---
Fozzie is very coompetent,  a good man and passionate about eve online.

I'm not OP, I'm not interested in Sov, and I have friends in HK so I wouldn't do that.  But thanks for playing.  There's nothing wrong with admitting you're wrong - it's actually a sign of strength.  You should try it sometime.

The "problem" is that little Timmy got denied drone kills because the rorqual put his excavators in a depot.

Maybe they should apply skill loss to every ship.

Or, just to troll the pirates out there, a multiplier based on how negative your sec status is........ &lt;evil laugh&gt;

A special thanks to [https://www.twitch.tv/balefuldysnomia](https://www.twitch.tv/balefuldysnomia) who taught me everything I know about killing enemies in lowsec in a godly manner while also not making myself a burden on my nullsec comrades. ;D
---
Id Ally with TEST/GOON/INIT and grab myself as many rorqual as I can.
---
You didn't go around insta rfing every pos though. I was replying to your comment about the investment for a keepstar. You can still change it so it's well worth the investment without a damage cap. The fact it doesn't have a damage cap isn't the main factor for getting one in the first place.
---
Not a real concept, just a few points:
---
- stage from NPC-Nullsec or from a close-to-Null Lowsec (Jumprange, as you have a bridge Titan)
---
- start roaming the area with your dudes regularly and be a pita to the inhabitants, drop their carebears (you have a bridge)
---
- check ot timezones, timers etc and create a strategy for entosing (throwaway Atrons, RLML Bricktank Drake to fend off tackle or small Frig Gangs etc. + response fleet)
---
- If you attack carebears, attack the ihub first, as it will hit their income immediately
---
Move to npc null. Take moons. Put up fort. Get fites. Make friends, make enemies. 
---
Yes, today the bigger alliance would have to suffer through weeks of terrible gameplay, little guy have no way of stopping them anyways. 
---
He had to be like 100% AFK for this to happen right? 
---
Move the skill loss from t3cs to capitals.
---
Ty, is in Tama, the corp is "Seguro te digo sacowea". :)
---
Pretty good plan and now is even easier with the moon mining!!!
---
&gt; Not interested in bearing? You're fucked and consigned to the trash heap of history. Fuck you and your playstyle, this is bearing online and the super umbrellas will blot out the star etc.
---
This sums up my feeling toward eve. I basically just ping warrior now. I know "eve is dying" is the meme we all like to repeat, but it feels more true than ever.
---
yes that would certainly be something i would be interested in doing in Toronto.
---
Absolutely this. 1000%.  
---
If I could login and actually have *fun* mining or running missions, I would still be playing today.
---
I tried that. I lost ships to *falling asleep*. When your PVE is an effective sleep aid, something is *wrong.* ...And it has been wrong in eve for a very long time.

Good, let the 100+ man fleet cry about how bored they are. Blobs shouldn't be rewarded

I think i would try something like this:
---
- Move in to an npc-space pocket in sov space. Perhaps you shouldn't choose delve for starters.
---
- Move carriers, dreads and fax'es to the NPC station in this system , leave the titan and the supers where they are for starters. 
---
- Start entosing a pocket / constelation
---
- Have some fun with regular subcap fleets and harass the inhabitants so they can't do business-as-usual.
---
- See how they react, how strong the resistance is and what kind of blues / bathphones / enemys they have, etc.
---
- Don't act too arrogant or be total assholes in local, resistance will be much bigger if it gets personal. 
---
- Chances are good that at one point, if you are persistent enough, they or their landlord will contact you and try to negotiate a deal or recruit you. 
---
If you were active enough and act reasonable, they (or their enemys) will see you as an asset and will be much more generous in negotiations.
---
- Use diplomacy skills
---
- profit?
---
Holding sov allone as an independent entity of that size is not possible in my opinion, so you will have to make friends or at last some agreements anyway sooner or later.
---
Some slash-fiction is pr0n, some is documentary.

Only if it was so cold that your junk retracted like airplane landing gear after takeoff.

As long as you add to the cost the average cost of 128k sp, then yes.

"Krabbing" is the same as "bearing" or "Jewing". A Krab is a derogatory term for someone who PVEs all day with no intention of ever PVPing, or only PVPing when they are forced to.
---
A pvper does pve when they have to so they can pvp when they want to. A krab does pvp when they have to so they can pve when they want to.
---
Yes, because there was no reason to run around insta-RFing every POS. That's my point. For keepstars? There damn well is. They're not even remotely comparable.
---
As a wormholer I second and third that!
---
But where is the study, this is just some idiot science writer trying to tldr the study, I need the data and the graphs , I mean why even count freezer skulls, the ones that are cleaned for decoration are what they end up as in the end after they are "used"...
---
That’s not helpful at all -_-
---
And I’m not fond of capital ships costing multiple billions, to be honest.
---
Thought you were dead.  
---
Are you recruiting fat krabs, PL?
---
It's as shame that the best weapon to fight just about any of those fleets is supers. Literally just supers. Supers are the best solution to nearly any fleet you might face.
---
The only exception to this is *maybe* boosh ravens.
---
HK owns it, but doesn't live there renters do. The reason they were able to take it is because in K-Space they still have a sizeable super fleet with a decent bit of alts. The reason they lost was because they were facing an entire coalition worth of people. (INb4 init comes out of the woodwork to say they did it alone and goons were only there to whore.)
---
I'm sure there are places on the map that aren't in some giant coalution, but honestly they are VERY few and far between in the current meta. This guy is right and it isn't as easy as when Sutonia did it. 
---
Problem:
---
&gt; We have enough minerals to be welping 1k dreads at each other every week, and we're pissing around in jackdaws and blops
---
Solution:
---
&gt; just render them useless against subcaps...
---
Do you realize something?
---
This post is like a salt lick for HK deer.
---
Why would anyone train a titan if dreads were stronger
---
A few of us on the Strategic Cruiser focus group argued for keeping keeping subsystem skills on death, and were told "no". At this point, SP loss is an archaic mechanic that's needlessly punishing.
---
Understood. It’s not like I’ll travel around null with a faction battleship to bring it to faction warfare space tho ^^
---
As a frigate pilot in, let’s say, a solo Punisher, what should I be capable of engaging ? Thanks :)
---
\&gt;    I'm honestly not too sure about what you expect here, especially when there are just two people in the holding corp that holds the actual structures. 
---
Why does a holding corp need more than two people? There are literally two of us reinforcing the structures using 3 alts. They had 350 in discord and a dozen or so watching us kill the raitaru. 
---
\&gt;  I'd say it's pretty sad to leave a group, and then proceed to kick their shit in, and cause people to loose assets :) 
---
This is ironic coming from a group who's spy machine prides themselves on Judge wrecking CO2 and the PL nerd destroying titans and clones. We didn't use our roles.. we transferred ownership and left a group that had become toxic.

&gt; Also on the list the I guess lance did titans have some on ccp they had aoe then you removed it and made it targeted then made it cap only ie couldn't shoot sub caps now you gave them a directed aoe again lol
---
The AOE doomsday that titans used to have wasn't directed AOE. It literally just killed everyone on the field. It used to be possible to do it through a cyno too. I don't think anybody misses that. The doomsdays we have now are much more reasonable than the old AOE doomsdays were.
---
Good jobs boyz
---
Because dreads can't really apply to subcaps. It would create a rock paper scissors scenario where Titans can DD and high angle subs, subs would be untouchable to dreads, and dreads volley the life out of supercaps and Titans.

Amen, brother!

---
**The Good:**
---
Time Dilation is the best thing to have ever happened to Eve and if you don't like TiDi it is ENTIRELY because you have never experienced the time before TiDi. If your opinion is that TiDi is a bad thing, you have the ***wrong opinion.***
---
Ship balance is better but outliers still occur. Back in 2010 it was like Drakes and Abbadons and Maelstroms and Zealots and that was it. Nothing else. But over time it remained that there was a dominant ship or "flavor of the month" (Ishtars, Mackarels, etc)
---
HAW Dreads are awesome. Dreadnought ship bays are awesome. Dreads should get a few drones though but they're much better than they used to be.
---
Jump Fatigue should never have been applied to Jump Bridges and it's very good that it was removed.
---
Starbase Fuel Blocks were a huge improvement.
---
Much of the Module Tiericide was also an improvement. 
---
Remote-rep carrier blobs aren't a thing anymore. FAXes were an improvement.
---
Keepstars and the ability to dock supercaps was also a huge improvement.
---
**The Bad**
---
Logistics and remote reps remain utter cancer and are still a reason fights often turn into F1 festivals. 
---
Bombers are still too strong against battleships.
---
Tiericide has stagnated. Gun tiericide, in particular, is so badly needed. HAW equivalents for battleships and cruisers? Yes Please. But I suspect the guy in charge is afraid of the idea of a fleet of battleships being capable of high damage application against cruisers or HACs without being utterly reliant on web support.
---
Ship balance iteration is still not as quick as it should be.
---
Jump Fatigue sucks shit but I have to begrudgingly admit it accomplished some of it's goals.
---
**The Ugly**
---
Many of the new ship models are awful and lack creativity. Asymmetry is being done away with, the novel and unique looking spaceships of the past are beginning to all look like generic science-fiction spaceships. Yeah updated models are good but total revamps like the ones we have gotten are just....ew. Most are just legit boring though.
---
Sov system is way worse. Fozziesov was a total complete disaster which did more harm to the game than any other change ever made.
---
Interceptors should never have gotten bubble immunity. This problem is being addressed though, but for a time these were the most cancerous things ever made.
---
There seems to be less "making history" in the game nowadays. It just doesn't feel as epic as it once was. Big wars are over before they begin. It feels like the game peaked at B-R5RB and has been stagnant since, but I wonder how much of this is just me growing up and recognizing that this is just a video game and not real life.
---
It's same as saying that community is split in two parts - the ones who fly rorqs and don't care about 9b loss, and the ones who can't afford the risk.
---
Roam delve and check bots urself if you are interested. NPC corp btw
---
Now there's a name I haven't heard in a long time...a long time.
---
Sucks to be little Timmy then. 😔
---
how do they get locked targets to stack vertically instead of horizontally
---
That's neat but it's not EVE related.
---
oh fuck, how did they find out!
---
Yeah and if you can't kill the target in that amount of time then you shouldn't be actually trying to kill the Rorqual just farming the response whatever it may be.
---
Cuz fuck anyone who doesn't have 100 titans right! Those are chump numbers!
---
Been playing for a month after a year break and haven't seen you play or FC. Hope your doing well.
---
Just remove insurance completely.
---
It half-solves the problem of feroxes being basically free, T1 battleships being stupid cheap, and capitals costing 200m.
---
Sure it would make dreadbombs a little less appealing, but they don't really work anymore anyway.
---
Wait shit really? Is that how bad it is now?
---
God i love my people.
---
no veto power sure, but they are supposed to report and discuss what are the main problems in the game. Since goons now heavily relies on rorquals and their super umbrella, i don't see them asking for a big rorqual nerf or a capital rebalance because it's not a problem for them. I sincerely hope i'm wrong and that CSM representatives are reporting the situation objectively and asking for a fix, but unfortunately i don't think so. 
---
Lose a titan, and that character is deleted
---
The cost is not the only balancing factor.
---
Kiki and drek have bad cap.
---
kiki has shit tank
---
kiki/drek are also much more vulnerable to tracking disruptors over other platforms, resetting the ramp is a huge problem for triglavian ships.
---
Also, a beam confessor/hecate out ranges the living fuck out of a kiki, and out tanks it by a huge margin.
---
I'm really starting to feel like 2012 was the best point in the game.
---
Bears gonna bear. I guarantee they'd be back out in force if you disappear from local for 20 minutes, after slaughtering as many as possible.
---
I guess it’s very sandboxy: worrying about others activities is activity too.
---
[Have a better version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yfy8uJc-kU)
---
If CCP nerf rorquals for game's sake, goons win. If CCP doesn't do shit, goons will continue to make the gap between them and the rest of eve even bigger than it currently is. So yeah, what you say is true but do you see how the game is fucked? Whatever CCP does, goons still win. Sad to see a game end up like that, with no solution to an obvious problem that will slowly cause its death :(
---
Then.... defend your keepstars.....
---
I couldn't have said it better myself. Well put good sir.
---
oof. Right in the feels.
---
Make some guy sad while you shoot him with lazors
---
Solo and small gang stuff at an all-time low.  The whole why-bother-logging-in-when-i-can-just-play-another-game-and-only-play-eve-when-a-ping-goes-out-on-discord playstyle means less potential content for everyone.
---
It's not entirely the game's fault, the player culture changed.  Corps/alliances coming down on dudes over ship losses because can't have that red on the killboard, individual players thinking killboard stats are the be-all-end-all of pvp so they only ever blob v not-blob.......so yeah I would blame a bit part of that on killboards, specifically killboards HEAVILY favoring pure isk damage with no regard towards how many people were involved.  IE killing 5 frigs with your 1 frig &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; being in a 50 man gang bridging onto a single battleship.
---
&lt;3
---
Happy birthday, papa PL
---
Is not dishonorable if you make a character just for that and you stay loyal with your mains in that case you are just putting a spy in an enemy alliance as an strategy
---
I uh... uhm what the fuck... that fit though
---
I lived in Oasa for awhile.  There's no organization in the drones.  Cobalt Edge is even worse.  If 500 people moved in with purpose, they could take Sov.  That's the end of it.  They wouldn't be able to hold all of CE, but they could take a constellation no problem.  
---
thank you for posting it was fun i showed it to dacler

Wait since when do Jackdaws not apply well?

Shit post. Can we tag it as such?

They used a last name of Dahmer in the last paragraph. Come on.

tbh not as bad as I thought it would have been
---
This guy fucks. Except drone regions will.be protected by landlords. Also alliances that join the renter regions usually just die off cause they don't do anything worthwhile to retain members. I.e. generate content that isn't your wallet flashing.

Diamond rats are no joke.

Well they are not totally dead, simply putting on grid much less subcapitals  and titans than PH.

That is not a terrible idea.
---
You’re missing a boat load of factors. First and foremost is timezone tank. Being in a lot of sov wars, it’s not easy or else more people would do it instead of just being pets. 
---
And when you compare that to the isk sunk into a character trained explicitly for the purpose of sale under the old system, you find that it pays off faster and the investment before payoff starts is significantly lower... so his point about the change making it much easier to turn so into isk than it once was is absolutely correct.
---
&gt; flavour of the month 
---
month, last several years. Same thing if ur an npbee I guess 
---
The easy fix is make structures easier to find like through locator agent or something. War deccers have it too easy, they just hide structure in the middle of nowhere and they carry on as usual. Give the defenders a reason to undock  and fight back. Let us find the "big bad l33t high sec pvper's" structures and have a real fight rather than them picking off easy kills with barely any risk
---
He ran a Test fleet last year's christmas i think ? we took out like 150 corms, while looking for fights we had a dude play guitar and sing, and it all ended with a brawl against horde where we got absolutely smashed ( we got out isk positive tho ! &lt;3 corms )  
---
Most fun fleet i ever flew in.
---
I've played the game pretty consistently since 2007 with a few breaks due to RL or frustration with what is going on in the game. I think CCP has addressed a lot of the issues that have come up over the years such as introducing jump fatigue to limit capital force projection, removing static resource gathering, and balancing/tiericide subcaps. There are still plenty of issues I see such as supercap proliferation and infinitely re-spawning resources.
---
My biggest complaint besides the recent server/chat stability issues (this is a huge issue and its shameful its still not resolved when everything was fine December 2017) is that the basic PvE mechanics haven't been iterated on or expanded. Missions are largely the same for the past 10 years with the only addition being burner missions which is a great change but there needs to be more. 
---
Where are escort missions, defense missions, capture the flag missions etc. We have the basic retrieval quests or clear the site missions that are boring after running the same 10+ times. This same thing happens with DEDs, Anoms, and other sigs. There is a huge potential variety of PvE content available in these that CCP has never expanded upon. We should have hundreds of different types of anoms all with their own unique spin to make PvE content more engaging.
---
The fact is that greatly expanding this most basic and ubiquitous content will benefit everyone in the game form highsec, lowsec, null, and WH space. Putting some variety and mystery back in the game and giving more rewards for riskier/rarer sites would reduce the need to farm sites constantly to make money. It also gives PvPers more opportunities to interrupt the site/misison runner to force a fight or lose your reward. 
---
I strongly believe that if you improve the most basic features people use daily in EVE you'll find that it attracts more people and keeps the current players engaged. I quit during the whole monacle gate thing and only came back after CCP changed their direction. I came back again in 2017 after CCP showed they fixed a bunch of outstanding issues while also introducing new engaging content (moon mining). Once again I feel like 2018/2019 CCP lost site on what is needed for more features no one asked for. Hopefully CCP 2019 can once again iterate on the things people use daily to shake up the perceived stale meta.
---
Wow that's actually a good idea I think
---
more fun than its ever been.
---
Because back then character bazaar could not do the same if you had enough money ? 
---
So, kinda like they did to fade but not at all at the same time?
---
I would like to thank everyone for down voting a joke, like I clearly did not even give you my character name, so how can you send me your isk? :D Also, people begging for money on the internet drive me fucking crazy. 
---
How about you monetize your goddamned stream like everyone else instead of begging for donations. The OP is as bad as Markee Dragon, who begs for money for computer parts for 'his stream,' despite having a very monetized stream, and a business selling time codes to people. 
---
But, as they say, a sucker and his money are often parted, so good on you getting stuff by begging on the internet OP. Cheers for at least having the honor to thank the people from whom you begged.  
---
lmao don't try and use jita depot spam as an excuse to kill rorqual drones.
---
?? T3cs are effective in most PvE and PvP activities lmao
---
Why DO they keep changing corps?
---
&gt; Because dreads can't really apply to subcaps
---
wait what?
---
id say that you remove insurance on caps, as concord does not act in null (where caps are) and thus "cannot guarantee insurance of this vessel" 
---
Not sure where CCP is going with this one, but the fact that they connected it to a 10 years old similar article is very impressive.
---
pretty sure he's resubbed and a wormholer now ? idk maybe i'm tripping.
---
Not unanimous I want skill loss for not updated clones again. So take your kiddie pool back to your backyard please.
---
You get literally 3-4 anomalies a week in NPC nulls. I don't think any group of more than 10-15 people can make decent living in NPC nulls.
---
How would my feelings be hurt, go back to munching spod and loosing braincells
---
Ah, so "Carebear" has fallen into disuse, I guess then. Thank you for the explanation, I appreciate it.
---
Agreed, I've felt for several years now that they just see EVE players as a revenue flow so they can pursue their other eccentric fail projects, since most of them would never get willing investors as anyone with business sense can see it isn't going to work.
---
Go on....
---
I like the shield boost amp, special as there is not even a damn civilian shield booster in the cargo :)
---
You say that and now I'm confident that my belief that 12 was the last, best time of the game is solidified. I thought it was just a personal, subjective observation.
---
Take the Hed-GP gate
---
We do.
---
The F1 button needs to be physically larger not only to make it easier to find and press but because its status as the most important.

One key to rule them all.
---
Perfection
---
Man old eve would have kicked you there so many times than.
---
I like that you've not even given any purchase to the idea of fighting back, or doing what we do, but better. I consider it to be a most ingratiating position of surrender.
---
Yeah remove, they suck now anyway.
---
The people who buy injectors to replace subsystem skills are probably the main reason that CCP wants to keep skill loss in T3Cs.
---
I've stopped playing twice and I'm in the midst of my third start-up. Nothing is like EVE, nothing ever will be. Hopefully CCP will understand that highs require lows *by definition!!!* Stop giving people safety and soft punishments, make EVE hurt and people will love it more. I really like some of the new ideas and I honestly think this game could last 50 years more as long as they keep the pain and struggle as the core experience. 
---
My new goal is pure ambition. Going back to hisec and starting a new-bros corp which does the whole empire building schtick. Teaching players how to play, declaring wars and muscling others out of markets, creating a team of people who can turn rocks into the corpses of our enemies. I think that is a great game to play and EVE is the only place where it is real.
---
well, it really depends on the specifics on the engagement, but if you're fit to hit titans, you're probably not going to have an easy time striking a mach.
---
like literally nag rev and phoenix rickity wreck subcaps with HAWs and revs apply well to a webbed ship with dual giga pulses
---
To be fair, CCP "balance" is 15 years of making a couple minor stat changes to 5 of them every 6 months.
---
in the areas he mentioned yes, theres a reason why you dont see big groups going for t3c doctrines anymore
---
Skillu has more than 10 fax gl hf xd 
---
Blue awox alt is best.  
---
unless it's webbed, grappled, and scrammed
---
Can confirm, my CEO installed a program that overlays a fart button window on top of where the undock button usually is whenever neuts are in local.
---
Or maybe just maybe you played a game for 11 years and finally got bored of it. This game has to be incredible for you to have not only played it for so long but to also have 9 accounts, if anything this is a massive endorsement for the game. 
---
Regardless enjoy your time off.
---
The first question that comes to mind is do you have a valid Mining Permit? Perhaps your drones are obeying the CODE. even if you aren’t.
---
I fully expect to get plenty of down votes for this, so knock yourselves out--literally.
---
First, I would like to thank everyone for down voting my original comment, which was clearly an EVE joke.
---
"Start giving me free stuff like your isk, and I will send you 2x back"...  So I now realize that some of you took this seriously, but if you take 10 seconds to think about it:
---
1. This is a reference to one of the stupidest scams in eve; AND
---
2. I did not give you my character name, so how can I seriously be asking you to give me your isk?
---
However, now that my joke got down voted I feel liberated! Now I am free to say exactly what I feel about your post, OP. 
---
You see, people who beg others for donations on the internet, not because they have cancer, homeless, or have to overcome some other obstacle in their life, but rather because they want new computer parts to benefit their ***business*** really irritate me. 
---
How about you monetize your goddamned stream like everyone else instead of asking for 'donations' (begging)? My guess is you already have, but it just is not making you money fast enough, and you calculated part of the problem was the sub optimal hardware you are using. So why not 'ask' people on the internet to just gift you the hardware!? Am I close? 
---
From my point of view, OP, you are behaving like you are Markee Dragon. You know the guy who begs for money for computer parts for 'his stream,' despite having a monetized stream with lots of subscribers, and a business selling time codes to people on the side. 
---
I am not a capitalist, but I feel like, if you want to be one you should invest your own money in your 'enterprise' instead of asking *slow* people on the internet to give it to you.
---
Then again, OP, I cannot be too mad at you... as they say, a sucker and his money are often parted, so good on you getting free stuff from said suckers on the internet and r/eve. You absolutely deserve props for being thankful to those suckers and saying so, and I am giving you those props now. 
---
Whole heads, or do the fractional bits count.
---
I'm sorry...have you looked at the Proteus? 
---
I can suggest this, but biased since I got to contribute https://www.amazon.com/Internet-Spaceships-Are-Serious-Business/dp/0816699089/
---
MMM the good ol days. :)
---
When I start playing with my cute little T1 cruiser back in WWB  it was not discouraging to fight 54 alliance who drop super/titan on you all the day, it was funny and gave me a goal : make them pay, now if people are too weak to understand "hey, they got money, they got years of experience and they use both to crush me, me the 1 hour per week player then it's fair" I think they belong in games created for them, such as World Of Wellfare or Guild Weaks 2. If you want a game to be fair to new player and unfair to old player then you don't understand what progression mean, ofc, if the north had adapt to the roq meta we would right now have a more healthy place in nullsec, more pvp, more "million dollar battle" so more people in the game. Rorqual are an issue because only 1 side use it. 
---
It adds a sort of maintenance and, bob willing, recurring cost to owning a titan/super. Everyone's bitching how caps are cheap now, yet losing sp(isk) is suddenly irrelevant?
---
While I don't really disagree with many of your points and some points even agree, I do know who you are in EVE.
---
So with that I say don't let the door hit your fucking ass on the way out you salty piece of shit. Please biomass.
---
So you have about 500 active dudes you move them all into 1 corp join a alliance in legacy or CFC and your in null sec, like there isn't a invasion play that's really gonna work out with that low of a number.
---
If you don't allow the diplo entry and want to fight, you need to wait for a war and back the losing side if you can make a difference ( given you have like 51 caps that seems iffy ), like that number is way to low to become relevant unless you have some batphones that like your alliance. 
---
My friend and I were having this exact debate yesterday. He was trying to sell me on his solo hunting loki (which he does well in). With me just saying, yeah it's a decent fit, but it's just not worth the price tag + skill loss. 
---
A game-breaking mechanic doesn't stop being game-breaking just because it takes a few more months to get there. 
---
Okay used excavators in siege and set to mine repeatedly on both moon ore and regular ore. Both times orbited for 4 min on a 60 min cycle time and display mining on status. No laser animation and with fully empty ore hold showed no ore mined when recalled. Tried with an orca with augmented mining drones same thing but sometimes the drones worked for one trip then failed again. Another corp mate also had the same issue.
---
Don't you have a gate to chirp about?
---
name checks out
---
Fair. I dunno man I just dislike titans as a concept, and would like to see a hard counter that a smaller group can access.
---
Gosh just reinject your lost SP what are you some poor scrub? /s
---
What's wrong with carriers exactly? I find them to be quite meh due to the fact that every large battle turns into "Hey lets all launch SSF fighters, lag the crap out of the grid, and kill fighters for 3 hours".
---
Basement? Are you crazy? it's much more tasty when fresh!
---
&gt; When they make it absolutely clear I'm just a fucking money squirting statistic to them, rather than a consumer of something they lovingly make. It becomes blatantly clear that their one and only priority is squeezing me for money, not being a game dev doing something they love for people who love what they do.
---
Funny that you say that. I remember how you were bragging about how great it was that CCP marketed the SKINs for whales and you had no issues with paying that much for SKINs you liked. 
---
Krabing supers and moving titans get rekt often. They could lose a shit ton of skills for dying, making those kills that much more valuable
---
When you have a locked target, there's a crosshair type icon in the corner, with arrows on it. You can drag that around.
---
NEUT EVERYTHING
---
It's time, for you... To grow up.
---
I think if you lose a titan, the game should just reach out from your monitor and slap you, and then delete system.32
---
Oh, I am sorry r/eve I take it back. What the person having been given the GDPR request should really do is fold to a law that does not apply to him, which was used incidentally by someone in the EU trying use the GDPR to get back at someone--in one of the most asinine ways available--because the got kicked out of a player 'organization' in an internet spaceship game. My bad.  
---
Ah can't you make roughly 50m ticks from carrier ratting, even if active?
---
this loud and obnoxious?  This is easily the most subdued I've ever heard PGL on a fleet.
---
I like the skill loss 
---
And move it to triglavian...
---
Damn. You could've done that in under 90 minutes with photoshop.
---
half of test is already in horde, but thanks.
---
And so the myth of intelligence correlating with psychopathy has been debunked.
---
Yeah your calculations are wrong. I have a 120+ character farm and I'm making bank. Anyone who says skill injector farming isn't profitable is doing their math wrong. 
---
I once typed "eve online monthly economic reports" into our corporate Slack channel.
---
especially Rorquals...."lose a rorq....youre back to Rorqual 1 "
---
Eh, they're all pretty much interchangeable.
---
Does anyone have a list of skills that are must haves to get to 5? 
---
I actually started in Illustrator by making the background, imported to Photoshop to do the shadow, and then put on the "PLEX" text, then applied a 30 second metal-grain overlay. 
---
In regards to your last paragraph, I would think that’s the majority of the player base now. Those of us who started 5+ years ago are most likely working on a professional life and can’t dedicate time to eve. 
---
By 'long history' I really meant, 'a long list' of. I mixed up my the word following 'long,' probably because 'history' is a word that often follows 'long' when used in similar contexts. 
---
I mean, you could make the argument that it would make cap usage even more risk averse. While that may be true, insurance hasn't been doing a great job of it.
---
I just really dislike the idea of any kind of ship being a throwaway item (except like T1 frigates/destroyers/corvettes).
---
Using MPTCs it is. The first slot using PLEX is about break even by my calcs.
---
I am a very new player, started playing on Monday. I have spent a few days getting a feel for the game, did some missions, worked through some agents progressions, tried some trading, did some trucking and lost a ship in low sec. 
---
All that to say this, I have settled into what is comfortable for me which is mining resources, then building things. So I have self identified as someone who enjoys mining and industry. Where does that fit into corp structure? Right now I am spending time in medium sec mining while dodging angel cartel ships in Metropolis space. I don't feel like I make alot of ISK but I don't spend alot either except for resources I'm short on to start building something. Are there corps for people like me? Or is what I like to do more of a niche position inside of corps? Now that I have narrowed down how I like to play I'm looking to really get into it, but it feels like I'm just pissing into a blackhole sometimes. Curious what the thoughts of others are. 
---
Jump Drive Calibration level 5, Amarr titan level 4, capital energy turrets level 5 is all you need for pvp these days
---
&gt;accidental
---
lmao they 100% knew, most of the community that had any braincells to rub together saw coming a mile away. Tossed in a few output nerfs to placate the oinking hordes because pre nerf rorqs were a completely broken mess (and still are but at least they’re not 300m3/s jump hictors)
---
If your fleet comp isnt complete shit, you would have neuts when they ram. No cap, no DPS, hardeners off.
---
What group do you fly with that this is a problem
---
As a guy who started playing eve less than a year ago, I would have appreciated it if there were no injectors. I feel like there's fun stuff to be done at every sp level, but almost everyone just skips the lower levels, which is a real shame imo.
---
Some people just cant stop breathing out of their mouths, it is insane.
---
eyyyy sad but true :(
---
So ... you keep them in your closet?
---
I can agree with this now that we have abyssal stuff in the lore. Like making Concord come up with something that is added to new clones to not have this issue to help fight the abyssal invasions. I still feel we should see abyssal rats in k and j space with the damaged drifter fleets rolling around, or at least have abyssal rats shoot structures for retaliation of entering abyssal space. There are plenty of mechanics that could be added to play on the abyssal addition, including small self sustaining little pockets that could be deployed in hostile systems for small gangs. Kinda like the idea of a POS but limited to, of course, cruisers. Once when the fuel is no longer used in the generator everything inside goes poof. BOOM, micro gang hunting/living in hostile space without proliferation of empty POS everywhere.

Yes, but nowhere near where it was. I remember when Proteus/Loki was a standard doctrine for almost every high end group.

---
Yeah, the intial primary nxy beed into 30% armor, but at that point about 10% of the faxes had triaged. You hear the call for more faxes to triage in the horde video and from that point on he started catching reps quite fast.
---
Except the problems is because of how powerful faxes are the problem caps don't really die.  This will just nerf dread use more.

Ironically I started playing rs3 again

Harmless cosmetics? Yeah, I'll whale for that. Then CCP went ahead and changed, and so did the way they treated customers.

You know, the amount of salt you and your kind hurf all over the place makes your post ironic as fuck. It's delectable.
---
I keep seeing the term "Fozziesov", can you give me an explanation as to what this is and what it means for the game?
---
Under the bed ofc, gives me something to talk to before falling asleep.
---
Considering T3 have been nerfed repeatedly over the last 10 years i've been playing Eve. I whole heartedly agree with the opening post. SP loss is a shit game mechanic anyway and discourages balls to the wall all out pvp and instead makes people more cautious when using them.
---
If anything they need to apply that mechanic to capital ships, not T3 ships. 
---
And then not drop an entire level. That's just frustrating. Just... enough to make it last 2-3 days to retrain with base implants.
---
Scalding pass! Cheap entosis ships. Encourage entosis and guerilla tactics. Force the current residents mad having to manage all the timers. Have had a ton of fun in that region.
---
You also need to add in the ctrl+m1 functionality to actually f1.
---
Now, now.  If they do it themselves they will probably get it wrong.  If they ask Reddit they definitely will get it wrong.
---
&gt;I just really dislike the idea of any kind of ship being a throwaway item (except like T1 frigates/destroyers/corvettes).   
---
exactly!  
---
its a CAPITAL ship, its not ment to be a throwaway item, it took some people weeks to build and the "mighty" cal navy parade you can see in HS has become a joke compared to what NS welps every day 
---
Cybernetics, biology, neurotoxin control/recovery for implants and drugs. 
---
Thats a god damn small fleet for so many ppl, i have that fleet in my hangar.
---
So I kind of disagree with him. Cruisers are more expensive than frigates and destroyers, but they're much more forgiving. You have shield and hybrid skills, so I would probably recommend a buffer shield blaster thorax with an mwd. It's fast, hits like a truck, has drones too, and is pretty disposable 
---
I accepted your criticism I would like to point out that I was not bagging for donations I simply just had a link so that people could if they felt the willingness to.  I was streaming to have fun and promote me self pvp in Eve online.
---
When people started subscribing and following that night I was super humble let alone the donations I received and to show proof that I would use the donations to buy the quad stick I created this post 
---
Crazy 
---
No, not particularly. With the move towards super tall systems allowing half the game to cower under a handful of cap umbrellas is it not reasonable to take a second look at mechanics born of a time when people actually had to occasionally poke their heads outside?
---
Of course but regardless of where you choose to engage, its important to realise that true solo fights are few and far between, especially in larger ships. Most others players with experience and co-ordination, combined with understanding of the Bhal's strengths and weakness will be able to make short work of it without much risk to themselves. More or less they just need the ability to point you from outside your neut/web range range (Lachesis/Orthrus) and apply damage to you from a similar range too, something many destroyers and up are capable of achieving. The risks of this can be mitigated by running a MJD since anything that comes in to scram you will eat a face full of neuts and webs providing your reaction times are fast enough. Of course it's also entirely possible that you run across some less experienced players that engage in a way that is favourable to you and welp to you because of it. As is always the fleeting possibly in Eve.
---
As for the Punisher, its an incredibly versatile little frigate with enough low slots, combined with its armour resist bonus to support a solid armour buffer or active tank and because its other bonus is only to the cap use of energy turrets (rather than a damage/rof bonus) it can be fitted with the aforementioned lasers or with blasters (for greater damage/tracking) or auto cannons (for selectable damage types with no cap use at all). This versatility means that other pilots who engage without knowing your setup in advance will never be 100% certain of what fit you're running, both increasing your potential engagement profile as well as your potential for surprising fights. As for your mids, some low sec fits run no prop, opting for a web/scram set up instead. Some run an AB/scram or even cap booster/scram on active fits. Have a browse on Zkill for the full myriad of options people have come up with, Ive even seen some crazy shit with 50mn MWD's and dual light beam lasers.
---
In regard to what you can engage, as always this will very much depend on where you choose to fight and your fit, but you generally want to stay away from anything that is likely to kite while holding you at range. Frigates like the Worm and Garmur can be utterly deadly with you never even managing to land any damage. Of course the no prop variants are most susceptible to this but regardless of your set up you will suffer if your opponent can pull range and use that against you. Generally when starting off you should focus on taking fights from other t1 frigates especially those that are willing to brawl, since with the buffer tank versions you will likely have far greater sustain that most t1 frigate opponents.
---
The difference in these short fights is often won or lost over range dictation and using the right damage type for what your fighting- if you choose to run auto cannons or by choosing to engage primarily shield tanked ships should you opt for lasers or primarily armour tanked ships should you choose to run blasters. This is of course only a rule of thumb and certain situations may allow different engagements to be more or less successful. With experience its most certainly possible to engage larger targets like destroyers or cruisers but only if the engagement starts at a favourable range to you and is against something lightly tanked liked a kitey corm, corax or talwar. In these engagements if you manage to secure tackle fast enough you can definitely stand a chance and they can lead to some seriously rewarding and unexpected kills.

I just wrote a book - The Space Prince - [https://www.amazon.com/dp/1792161220/](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1792161220/)   It deals with spying, running EVE organizations, and some other stuff. It is not a long book but packed full of hard learned lessons from playing the game.

Why are you stopping at heads?  Whole bodies are where it's at.

Long fucking month.

i would just take the system with less importance from the enemy and try to brick tank it. i dont think that capital fleet would be enough to take more, in fact, its probable that we will get ROFLstomped just on arrival so meh, no real point on planning an strategy.
---
Pyrolancia II wut?
---
this behavior definately isn't limited LoL, cuz that sounds like the DoTA players I know.  Perhaps it's MOBA thing?
---
I don’t see how removing the only valuable asset from the war dec process would lead to fighting. 
---
I get the current problem with war decs. It turns into a farming noobs declaration. Leads to the farmed not having fun. Then they leave. 
---
However, by removing the only thing worth fighting over from that process would war decs be even more abused? Now they war deccers can once again dec everyone and farm them. 
---
The proposed structure would allow more to get involved in citadel fights. Maybe they are created together. Even in a war dec, you have to “declare your intentions” to destroy a citadel. This new structure would allow either side to opt into the battle. 
---
Overall, I just don’t think the war dec. system can be helped in the way people want. If we truly want to keep people in the game, force them into corporations and communities that have organization. There are certaintly several in high sec; however, the low, null, and WH communities are naturally forced to be a bit more cohesive due to the nature of that space. If they want pure safety, then Eve may not be for them. If they want to learn safely, then reducing high sec and making it mostly newbie focused with just level 1-2 missions and tritanium may lead to everyone being in low and null. 
---
And to rebalance the Proteus so it goes 30m/s faster and fuck with the drone subsystem a bit. Yes. All good things. 
---
Ewww a razor keyboard

You realize with sniper corms you can pretty much track anything from like 80k out, you are literally just comparing the numbers instead of the situations these ships could be placed in where they will be heavily outperformed by cheaper alternatives.

Character bazaar was around long before Skill injectors. But since then, you're right. It is easier to inject your own toon than to buy someone else's. Then you don't inherit any drama or baggage that character got into before they sold it.
---
I hate to say it but this is true. While it does have oodles of potential it's really based around the pilot's own knowledge and ablities in pvp. Practicing with frigates and cruisers is definitely more sensible and when you know what pretty much all the ships can do and how to counter them you'll be able to pvp in a bhaalgorn. Although you'll still probably lose it if you don't have any support ships with you.
---
Eve is considered to be a (huge) sandbox, and you right now are sitting in a very corner of it playing just with yourself. You should try giving yourself some more space, try different things, don't be afraid of losing stuff, we all lose stuff all the time.

You can rat with them, you can steal cap from rats but not neut them out.
---
You can go up to triple armor repping them, you can shield fit them with nano lows (speedy bhaal is lols but flimsy), shield with dps, fleet with neuts, small gang with triple webs etc
---
They are very flexible but honestly the power grid and CPU allotted cause issues. They could be seriously OP if they had just a little bit more of both. The hull bonus is very useful, making cap less of an issue, this allows certain fits that are cap intensive normally not seen much. If you are looking for fights just know people HATE them and will drop caps just to get rid of them. If not dropping people will just avoid the fight. This is bad as they are very, very, very slow normally.
---
Because losing SP is only money if you immediately re-inject what you lost. At a quick glance on zkill I've lost 21 T3s [on my main alone](https://zkillboard.com/character/93417038/group/963/losses/) and I haven't once injected them back, I've just stuck it in queue and waited 4 days.
---
Also tbf the "caps are cheap" meme is untrue if you're counting the whole fit or the post-insurance loss. Minerals have gotten cheaper for sure and that's brought down the price of supers and titans, but regular capitals are actually more expensive if you're fitting them decently. Back when I started flying Triage in 2014 going over 2B inc fit was rarely worth it. Today though we've got a lot more T2 and faction capital mods plus the material cost of the hull was increased so most decent fax fits are a shade under 3B. The change with Dreads is even more dramatic between T2 guns and capital extenders/plates/injectors.

But seriously avoid a gang that has a keres, don't go full nos, fit atleast 1 neut, as You may sometimes want to kill the capacitor of the ship at the start of the mod cycle (opposite to nos). Careful about not burning Your mids (got me a couple o' times). Your guns track extremely bad, You want to keep atleast some range to track targets (above 5 km imo).

The Entosis Links. It was introduced in the Aegis expansion a couple years ago and changed sov from "shoot structure on timer" to "shoot beacon with hacking laser". 
---
It was meant to make sov more fluid and enable more "small gang warfare" by lowering the bar required to hold sovereignty in nullsec, but in truth it just made sov warfare more annoying and dull. It removed the "focusing on an objective" aspect of sov, encouraged trolling and harassment campaigns instead of epic set-piece battles. For semi-casual players who only go on pre-posted and announced fleet ops for known timers it was a major blow.
---
It did not succeed at killing big coalitions, ending mega-alliances like Goonswarm, nor did it end the practice of renting, which were also two goals of Fozziesov. It did succeed at making a Wide Space Empire very difficult but nowadays we build Tall Space Empires.
---
At that Goonswarm director meeting just after the announcement, not a single person there thought it was a good idea. Our CSM reps (who were finally able to talk about it with us) mentioned how they had said "this is a bad idea" but it was kinda just sprung on them, and when it was announced to the CSM it was clear they were going to make the changes regardless of player input. 
---
CCP officially called it "Aegis sov" but at the director meeting I disparagingly called it "Fozziesov" and the name stuck. I wonder if CCP knew it was meant to be an insult.
---
For all the complaints about Dominion sov, it was objectively a more fun system than Fozziesov. It just needed some work to make better.
---
Relieved to hear this, absolutely loved empyrean age but was worried Templar one wouldn’t hit the spot.

Thanks. I got all that. Wondering more specifically if people have figured out how quickly the P0 generates and if these variables change depending on other factors. For instance, does the rate of new P0 change if under heavy load from multiple players? Or is regeneration set to a single rate no matter how populated the planet is, etc.

---
Just checked, you can tank a Carrier with an [Interceptor (Malediction with my fit)](https://imgur.com/a/4YiYfLc) for several minutes.
---
If Carrier/Ratter runs with 3 dps fighter you [recieve lesser damage](https://imgur.com/a/EyUgNpg) than with 2 dps and one squad Dromis, if Carrier uses 2 dps and one squad Siren you can "overheal" his damage and need to turn your armor repair off so you don't waste cap and nanite charges.
---
So using Siren is the worst possible szenario, Carrier never should use them solo - so even if you break after said minute you can warp out easily since you're not pointed.
---
Carrier deals in [best case szenario](https://imgur.com/a/XaPvWII) with dromis about 150dps to a Malediction, after resistances you still take 40-80dps depending on wich fightertype Carrier is using.   
---
Malediction is Capstable for 40sec and with overheated MWD, with heated SAAR(small ancillary armor repair) its only 36sec but it repairs about 42hps (30% more), an overheated SAAR runs for 32sec so you run out of charges before running out of cap in both cases - does not matter if you're heating or not.
---
dps fighter MWD turns of after 20sec and cannot reactivate so they drop from 15km/s to about 3km/s and thats so slow you can outrun them easily, your MWD should be heated for a cycle to burn away from those dromis webbing you with 6.5km/s (webbed down about 3km/s) while still orbiting the Carrier at 25km, then turn of heat once youre out of dromirange and go to 4,5km/s again.
---
Dromis without MWD are at 1,5km/s speed so its easy to outrun them without heating, so once out of dromi range you can also outrun dps fighters again.
---
Consider the Carrier pilot needs to recall a fightersquad and switch for dromis.
---
Consider you're not pointed and can warpoff as soon as secondary tackle arrived.
---
If Carrierpilot switches for Dromi you buy time for your mates to burn into system, secondary tackle interceptor can tank again for another minute then just warp off if needed. If Carrierpilot does not switch for Dromis you are way better performing since you can tank three fightersquads way easier than two while being webbed.
---
If you are good you can dupe around and tank a Carrier even longer then that, because fighter MWD turns of after 20sec and needs 1minute to reload, your SAAR needs also one minute to refill charges - if you time that you can reload after you see those fighters dropping behind.
---
So if fighter second MWD comes up your SAAR is back again.
---
Remember you're still at 4,4km/s speed so Carrier fighter cannot reach you without MWD, and if said Carrierpilot does not switch for dromis you can tank him.
---
**tl;dr** If you fit properly and consider tank modules in your frigate, you can tank this 20sec burstphase a Carrier puts out while his fighters have active MWD, afterwards you outrun his slow fighters.
---
If they are dead, then so are the other top 5 entities on Zkill, such as Goons, Test, NC., Horde etc. RiP Eve.

---
Forwarning: drifters can and will target switch for no discernable reason, dont be salty, shit happens.
---
Its been a little over a year since I was eating drifters with my nag. Here's a quick breakdown of my thoughts/game plan for drifter farming.
---
You need a web buffed webbing ship, I used a either a worm with 2 webs and another toon with at least 3 points of warp scram or more. 
---
THATS THREE points of scram( a scram and a disruptor or 3 disruptors, etc...) you need 3 warp disruption points to keep the drifter from warping off. And at least one buffed web or two non-buffed webs. 
---
Or my preference, a vigilant with with 2 factions webs and scrams. This vigy can hold/tackle the drifter on it's own. 
---
Once your figured how you're going to slow down/tackle drifter, now I'm actually ready to farm him.
---
Wherever the drifter is, unless this has changed, the drifter will tackle and attack the ship on grid with the biggest Signature/bloom. Because of this, NEVER bring your tackle ship/non capital on grid with the drifter until the drifter has ALREADY attacked/agressed the cap you're using to kill him. 
---
1. Locate drifter
---
2. Bring in cap to take aggro
---
3. Bring tackle ship on grid. Tackle/hold drifter
---
4. Siege up and blap that cunt, keep close eye on your cycles
---
(Decent NAG skills will take 2 cycles, great NAG skills and better should take slightly less than 1)
---
5. Profit????
---
P.s. it should be obvious if it's not, the more webs you put on the drifter the better dreads apply, the faster he will go explodie.
---
Sorry for the terrible writing, any/all commentS/questions welcome!

Applies to pretty much everything. Free intel is bad for the game.
---
Next we will get a vid about BOB?
---
Panic 1 might be better. 
---
&gt;People honestly don't give a fuck about their killboards.
---
Yes, do they. But even if they didnt, its used for free intel to determine if a fight can be taken.
---
The issue with that is that there isn't really a small gang solution that doesn't scale up just as well into the big fleet territory.  
---
You buff dreads and then the big coalitions just drop dreadx100 and you've made them stronger so the only counter is more dread, or a huge wave of subcap which is obviously much easier for the larger group to field.
---
Pathetic. 
---
Now don't be rude to Welshmen. Stitcher does not deserve that comparison.
---
I mean, it demonstrably doesn't, though? They just lost nine accounts and the skin whaling attached to that. Pure cosmetics is one thing and it definitely worked. A lot of us have money we can spend on our hobbies and buying cool skins with nice lore tie-ins and so on is harmless and helps support something we care about while giving us something we enjoy.
---
The change that has come along since then is the manipulation attempts. The addiction triggers, log-in incentives and so on. This is far more sinister and I'd even go so far as to say malicious in intent and motivation. 
---
Perhaps it does work for them overall. It's entirely possible that people like me are very much the minority. However, it's kind of nonsensical to say it works on *me* as a response to a post where I'm unsubbing nine accounts.
---
Just gonna weigh in here that it seems you're working pretty damn hard to pick a fight with a random new guy who makes really good points, probably because if you argued with anyone who actually played eve, you'd get slapped down.  Firendofthefox is spot-fucking-on about this game, and you are totally misrepresenting his points--why?  I don't know.  Again, probably because you've never won a real argument.  Go eat some grass m8 and block me too :)
---
This is going to be my speculation here, but I'd say that the rate of respawn for P0 ressource is affected by the presence of capsuleers on the same point. Basically, the ressources regenerate when no extraction is being done on a point, or a very light one. So if you see a lot of people gathering their extractor heads on the same point, might be good to take off yours and find a better spot to reap the rewards before the first point is depleted.
---
Let me tell you how "instantly" the excavators land in Rorq's drone bay when they're on the far side of a fucking Spod rock :-D 
---
&gt;The changes made recently (rorqs, injectors, caps, F2P etc..) make sense in isolation
---
Injectors never made sense above say 10m and for small/medium stuff. The idea that you can inject end game ships instantly is fucking retarded. Injectors were supposedly added to help new players catch up. So we get some of that, and a ton of bullshit that breaks the game.
---
Ok lets be honest.       
---
For a random alliance - stats are good, but when you include history we are getting to a situation where **New Eden capital super power** is now gatecamping and getting most of the kills thanks to few members being part of big battles.       
---
This **ex super power** is brining less subcaps and heavy equipment on field than PH - that is declared "newbie friendly" group that have no recruitment requirements.             
---
We are talking about alliance that is constantly bleeding out members that initially allowed PL to become this super power.            
---
So yes PL is in very bad situation now and it don't getting any better unless you are assuming that current PL role is to third-party PH fights. 
---
Forget the skill books. They'll come in time. Practice d-scanning. It's the single most helpful skill in pvp.
---
They havn't gotten rid of Wardecs.
---
Small groups can ambush moving Titans. Unless you're talking about a 'Small Gang' of 5-10 Subcaps, then they shouldn't be able to touch a titan if flown correctly and with the right cover. Ambushing individual titans can actually be one of the more exciting challenges for a small group.
---
Regardless of how much cheaper capital ships are becoming, and how much they're being amassed now, a Titan is still a huge investment of time, isk and tying up a character to a speciallist role.
---
Whereas the 'Small gang' is just a trip to Amarr.
---
"Small Groups" 'Hard' counter to large groups has always been, manuvarability, adaptability, faster reaction times, faster reships and a higher level of organisation when it comes to a changing situation. 
---
They say that the emphasis on bullying or itimidation is a negative, I disagree. I think a lot of people who get pushed around in this game of a tendency to push back. I think it might be a confidence builder for some people that extends in their real lives. I used to fly with a guy in a lowsec corp that learned how to be confident in his decisions and actions through FC'ing. This study (if it's not fake) seems to focus soley on the negative aspects of our community and none of the positives.
---
I do feel like there are better ships to do PVE than a Bhaalgorn... Yes, the capacitor, and thus the tank, should be safe for as long as I can steal the energy from a rat, but the efficiency is quite meh. I do prefer my Nightmare for a PVE job ^^

---
These are all biases that form due to the players hyper-focus on their current gameplay.  There is a core correlation with the above and their interaction with Large Null Sec groups (or even any null sec group).
---
As someone who started in 2005, the main problem is there is no middle man room.  The middle class of groups has been eroded away by power creep combined with empire building.  Most people will assume this means 'super/titan proliferation', but I would disagree.  Yes there are a large number being built, and that is a function of the empire building, not power creep.  The power creep is actually on the small ships and the hunter side.  Hunting and skirmishing is so powerful, you can shut down a whole region with a small group of people.  There are WH based groups who can 'teleport' into your region/system and more or less literally alpha your ratting carrier within minutes of a wh spawning.  The same level of power resides on the anti-subcap front as well, with super-strong combat probing (super-easy I should say) and powerful new ships like Trig stuff, Boosh CDs, T3Ds, etc.  
---
All of this hunter power eats up the groups that would otherwise move into some of the lesser occupied regions.  People flock to the bigger entities who can protect them.  High skill, high wealth players can be immune to these since they are less dependent on ship-in-space income.  Thus we see high-skill high-sp high-wealth groups as the only remaining small/med groups in low/null.  These groups are now crying fowl about the moon changes, which has hurt one of their income sources that was immune to the power-crept hunters.
---
Because of this, the hunters have to hunt where the targets go, and thus we see endless posts about killing botters, afkers, or X post about Goons/Test/Etc ratters dying.  Since all of the hunters now hunt in the large alliance areas, they have to deal with large alliance responses, like FAX, Titans and such.  This leads to endless complaints about how broken something people call the 'umbrella' is.  Needless to say the umbrella used to be the whole fucking map, and capitals were more powerful, but ignore their cognitive dissonance.
---
Skill injectors were one of the catalysts of this chaos.  I do not blame them directly, as they just facilitate meta changes quicker, and ease new player attention.  Sans skill injectors, eve has become so industrialized that the Char Bazzar could easily fill the 'super/rorqual/titan' niche, since I suspect the number of people who inject their first one is lowish.  Obviously it would not handle the recent peak demands easily, and we would probably see more demand for titans, and more 'old guard advantage'.
---
TL;DR - Power Creep killed the Frontiersman
---
Go to a conflict area and try to take systems on the outskirts of the entity that's under attack
---
ah man, this is great :) I remember being a noob alpha pilot taking my venture into wspace for some 'ninja gas harvesting' xD the skillbooks were sooo expensive and I only did it few times before going back to running relic sites. good times
---
Just get rid of cynos. Nobody is willing to engage anyone as long as a single noob ship can be transformed into a gang of caps/supers at the click of a button. Caps/supers should need to use gates like every other ship, and if you want to deploy them, then you should have to manage that deployment. For those that weren't around, Eve before cynos meant watching gates in other systems, monitoring probable travel corridors, finding good routes, picking long gate to location warps and trying to gtfo before the gang arrived on grid etc - not just, "I better not engage this frigate/cruiser/whatever because it'll definitely have a cyno fitted".
---
If I have to take 2 months to train amarr titan 5 again I'll go on a bitchslapping tour across eve.
---
TLDW : where it is is now where it wasn't.
---
You can hit KWG or one of the other garbage small groups. I like cloud ring though. Build PvP skill skirmishing with Init (if they don't titan blob my little alliance to death) Conifers (or whoever lives in Syndicate now) and Trivumverate. Plus with your close proximity to Placid you can join the lowsec brawling community.

Cloaky arty Loki is ez mode for elite solo pvp

If you know how to fly against them or use e war it's not an issue
---
Join IM
---
I think I would disagree. You can live comfortably in NPC null and harass the nearby sov until you reach an agreement or for the group to reconsolidate. 
---
lmao go to wormholes haha why do you expect anything fun to be in kspace lol just scan 
---
.. doing it 2 weeks ago? 
---
Well Dr. Radakos has disputed these allegations, on numerous occasions. 
---
The results are so astounding that new players join everyday with k end in sight. Additionally, the old player base weeds out the weak, and uninformed through ADP. This is done to extract salty salty tears, and to make sure they dont get a special snowflake their ranks. 
---
 This obviously does not apply to high sec players, because you must actually play the game against other players. This must involve actual real people, and not NPC's to actually advance in eve. People who play in high sec are usually new, or skiddish trout that run from the thought of a ship blowing up that isn't an NPC. 
---
In closing, if you want to play a game with actual risk, you must join a nullsec entity, or a wormhole entity. PVP combat is also required, and thus more real than other MMORPG's.
---
Just like rl, you gotta keep your head on a swivel, and only trust those close to you. You cannot always protect yourself, and its a risk undocking. 
---
Eve is real. 
---
Fade seems open 
---
Not really, solo is dead since 2003
---
1 year of loki piloting in pvp I probably spent a full month re-training the lost skill to V since
---
Wormholer btw

Control key for locking targets
---
When it comes to the skins then they have already earned the money from you. They have already seen that people like you pay for the expensive skins. So they try to push it more and more, because of a positive feedback loop. 
---
You unsubbing 9 accounts doesn't matter much because other whales are still hungry and still have plenty of rorqual, afk VNI, and skillfarm accounts. But eventually it will break when everyone else have left and the game becomes too stale. 
---
So I still find it ironic that you complain about this when you were one of the people who helped CCP go down this path, whether it was intentional or not. Give them a finger and they take the arm. 
---
Up vote Made me Laugh
---
Could make loosing a capital like losing an old pod. Tie it into insurance for the vessel, up the cost of insurance to cover ship and skill points. Don't have insurance, you lose like 1%, 2.5%, 5%, etc. Of your total skill points based on the gap.
---
Feel free to drop by Ouelletta and request a 1v1 from any member of Stay Frosty (or anywhere else you find one for that matter); if they accept to have a 1v1 they will honour it.
---
Keep in mind that I said "if they accept".
---
Read the first few sentences. Anyone who is making an argument against the Triglavian Revolution will be eliminated. Eve is not your game to dictate. 
---
Adapt or GTFO.
---
Exactly. You need to have 1x plexed and 2x mptc characters per account in order to make a good profit. That's something every dedicated brain farmer will have. So while profits might be down for casual brain farmers, they're still quite good for the people doing it seriously. 
---
This speaks to me hardcore. Regular mining is too boring for me, but I've always been a huge fan of scouting... I've never even thought of actually visiting the gas sites in my usual Astero though. 
---
This could be the fresh bit of content I need. So a few questions for any frequent gas huffers!
---
1. Is the Prospect worth the money? The price at a little less than 20m doesn't seem to bad at all, and I'd assume you can make more than that in a single trip with this ore hold and the value of certain gasses.
---
2. Which kind of wormholes/gasses should I seek out?
---
3. Any skills I should train alongside the appropriate skills that I may not think of to train right away, but are decently good additions for WH gas mining?
---
Not sure how that link relates but its funny as hell
---
Imagine you are vegan and of course Wormholer and still salty that some Nullsec Bears evicted your  PL Alts out of your carebear haven. :(
---
Can't say. I've never seen motherships in game.
---
You can get solo fights in FW. Plexes have warp restrictions so nothing can really land on top of you.
---
Does it count if it's my head that is currently in my refrigerator, since I apparently live in an overheated hellscape that's 30 fucking degrees celcius at 4 in the morning.

If the next year is actually dedicated to QOL, it will put the game in a much better spot. I'm optimistic about 2019, but we'll see. Got a couple people coming back from AFK, seeing more activity in highsec- and lowsec by extension as the bolder of the highsec groups leave the pocket. Derelik used to be an empty waste, now it's a verdant waste.
---
You guys had a dread for every person in our fleet and we were all running anywhere from 3 to 7 clients aside from what 7 rote lokis. I'm sure this video is amazing content. Wow. Wow
---
Why would I do something I'm not interested in.  It can be done.  I linked an article describing in great detail how it was done, and I suggested where someone who wanted to repeat that could accomplish it today.  I'm happy to claim a win in this internet argument.  Next!
---
New player here.  About a week and half so far...  It's all starting to make sense as I wallow around in my frigate and become space junk real fast.  Yeah its cut throat out there...  Exciting.
---
But I don't know what I am more excited about...  Getting better and making other players miserable or trading in my trunk full of dead hookers for a collection of heads.
---
As long as I can work from home...
---
The best way is between your toes so you don't scar up those pretty arms you have. 
---
Hi r/all
---
Also. Cant web a sieged dread lmao
---
back when i played the elitist pilots used  1-6, Q-Y, A-H with SHIFT as a modifier for heat. It's perfect.
---
&gt; People honestly don't give a fuck about their killboards. That mentality is largely fabricated
---
don't ruin the mittani's talking points
---
I think it was in build otherwise if it was finished and delivered, it'd end up going to asset safety.
---
I'm not sure I agree. Of course they've already earned my whaling money *on the harmless SKIN front*. I have no problem with them pushing the harmless cosmetics as much as they want. Dedicate an entire art department solely to pushing new skins for more money if they want. 
---
(My recommendation is actually to spend more art department time on paid character cosmetics. There's a dire dearth of cyberpunk clothes/hair/accessories in Eve, and there's so many of us who'd throw the entire wallet at CCP if they let us and the art department wasn't going to be fixing all the other problems with Eve anyway. If anything, art department adding more profits to CCP should increase resources spent elsewhere.)
---
Of course, me alone leaving is never going to make much of a difference, but it never does in any game. It's when more and more people vote with their wallets that it does, and the whales become too few to maintain things. 
---
Like for instance these nine accounts that no longer purchase skins on top of the sub cost. They're not just losing the sub money, but the future skin whaling. 
---
I did indeed help CCP go down the path of monetized cosmetics and that I'll never apologize for. I have characters with the original monocle. It has no effect on the gameplay and it isn't trying to manipulate the players or even disrespect the customers. I gave them that entire arm willingly.
---
What I am complaining about isn't that and never will be, and I think you understand that. I complain - amongst other things - about their *manipulative* behaviour. The log-in "incentives" designed entirely around triggering addiction mechanics. The loot-box mechanics. The so very blatant short-sighted manipulation that don't take the long-term health of the game into account, etc. 
---
I think where we don't understand each other here is simply that I don't see how you're comparing monetized cosmetics with their manipulative addiction changes?
---
I guess I should say that they got rid of my reason for disliking wardecs.
---
I agree that there is no game like Eve, which is usually what brings me back! I think new ideas are good, but they should be built on the foundation of some of the older features of the game sometimes. I think also the voices of each section of the game should be heard, not just a select few.
---
Our ambitions seem to align, I've had similar ideas concerning hisec. We should compare notes.
---
I find this is a common theme among those who think supers are the worst problem in eve.
---
Being old school, Carebear has a special place in my heart, lol
---
What's your TZ.
---
Whenever I Google things, I have to stop myself from appending "eve" to the end of my search because I just don't really care that much about Moas irl
---
you see, there as been a shift of the general populace's opinion, that solo and small gang players are actually kiting risk averse pussies that only want to kill VNIs and other defenseless krabs.
---
i attribute it to the talent drain that has been going on since 2012/13 but accelerated rapidly the past couple of years.
---
the krabs won, no PVP here to be had
---
I don't use the F keys at all myself, keybound everything to my old wow keybinds. Q is prop, 1 is guns, 2-4 + ASD are other active mods. I rarely use approach command, so if I need to for whatever reason (eg scooping loot or whatever) I either click approach in the Selected Item window or use the radial menu, I think I might be one of about 12 people who uses that regularly lol.
---
Numbers to activate, F keys to overheat 
---
What the fuck are you talking about? Trig ships are fine because you can make a fleet comp countering one ship? Sure you can blob the shit out of a leshak with tds neutes long webs and dps. And you can add damps and ecm there for good mesure and throw a dread a carrier and a super on it. Ha ha got him ez. Btw everyone and his mum has a cap transfer in their trig gang comp to help with neutes and oh surprise trig ships are actually very strong on cap compared to other battleships like in every other aspect.
---
Mak was completely un-involved with the incident that sparked this article. 
---
There's two common models for this:
---
1) The people doing mining/industry are just random members of the corp/alliance.   There isn't any particular structure, just people doing what they like.
---
2) An industrial corporation within one of the giant alliances.  Industry alone can't protect space, so the indy corp needs PvP entities for protection, and those PvP entities rely on the indy corps to supply them with cheap ships.
---
If it's a big enough alliance/coalition, they'll have both.
---
My personal recommendation is to join one of the mega alliances, as a general new-player corp (Brand Newbros, Brave Newbies, Karmafleet).  From there you'll be doing #1 above, while getting more exposure to the rest of the game.  You'll also find it far easier to figure out what you really want from a corp, which will make it much easier to find that corp.
---
From that, you can move to the indy-focuses corps in those alliances, or a smaller group, or a different alliance, or it may turn out something completely different is more fun.
---
Oh ya. Like when they ran from the AT because they realized someone was going to shoot back?
---
1 (not F1) for point
---
2 for web
---
3 for gun
---
4 for propmod
---
extra ewar get added to modifier (like shift or a mouse button) + 1/2
---
Pay Goons a rental fee, park a raitaru in 1DQ. Wardeccers can now continue with impunity. 
---
Sheckle squad leadership all moved to laser hawks when given the opportunity, 
---
Big Sigma from drunken disorder did it too, and now a corp that used to challenge our evictions by evicting them themselves was evicted by us last week I believe. 
---
You know all the major corps poach heavily. 
---
F1 is prop, F2 is tackle, F3 is web, F4 is gun. If any is not present, the slot is empty.
---
I've never been a huge fan of KBs, I felt that they could cause risk averse behavior to become habitual for some. It's nice to look at one's space murder accomplishments, but it can work against one as well.
---
&gt; cloud ring
---
no, go to the npc space in pure blind instead. You have banderlogs, tri, oldschool, quite a bit of roamers comparatively speaking due to lonetrek proximity, close to init and rdraw as well in the null side and close to UF, salt farmers and seven sins on the ls side. If you go up north you have some NC. renters I think as well?
---
Citadels made living in WH space way too easy and I hate it. One of my favorite things to do was to scout WH space and gather intel on various groups for *reasons*. POS bubbles made it difficult to hide things which made this job interesting and fun. Now you just pop into a hole and "let's see, citadel, citadel, citadel..." it's far less interesting and the ease means you see a lot less weird shit happen.
---
Yes, I understand that the POS removal was necessary to fix ancient code or whatever but I wish (at least in WH space) that they were replaced with a similar system that addressed some areas in need of improvement but still maintained the difficulty level of living in an area of space that originally nobody was intended to live in. 
---
just saying that it is something to consider. i think we can all agree that we don't need more ships being able to fit into plexes where their power level is overshadowing everything else that fits in.
---
Q for guns, R for propmod, everything else kinda up in the air but using QWER and 1234.
---
MJD and MJFGs go on 5 to avoid accidental activation.
---
Removing insurance effectively doubles the cost of ship replacement and just hands more power to the uber-blocs (read: Goons) that have the industrial capacity to replace their own lost ships.
---
You'll see even fewer people undocking to fight unless the odds are so completely in their favor that the costs aren't a concern.
---
I actually like to click my keys.
---
i use S and D for hi-slor 1 and 2 
---
... it's called an investment? a very good one at that since it is unassailable, scales infinitely and is completely passive
---
Realistically they are just trying to extract as much isk as possible by sding cheap probably unfitted ships to then log off in their most expensive ship an haulers with all their mods. The fact that killboards exist has little to do with people trying to save their assets.
---
Cause It’s space heroin.
---
lol "heads in basement" amateurs.  I have a shipping container of corpses preserved with salt.
---
Wait? There was an incident? I thought CORA was a play on ARC, so I ran with it.
---
But I could totally see IKAME or any high profile rp corp turn down an in-character scientist on grounds of basic Corp recruitment standards and that cause some huge drama.
---
One thing leads to another. If they can get people to buy overpriced stuff they will attempt to use other tricks to milk their playerbase. Just like they did. 
---
Thank you, that helps fill in some of the blanks that I had. I remember the Entosis Links and stuff and Aegis and such. I appreciate your clarification to my question! 👍
---
Damavik is pretty shit anyways so doesn't matter. The only issue would be the kikimora which fits into smalls. For larger plexes the trig ships don't really have that much impact. 
---
Who the hell told these guys about my true slave decryption node. 
---
Space zombies when 
---
"recall all torpedoes" option when? 
---
I think you misunderstand. When people say super proliferation they mean super capital proliferation. Also one of my first losses was to a mothership smartbombing on a lowsec gate in 2007 so yea they were worse but there was far fewer of them around.
---
USCST
---
Its actually really funny. The reddit krabs/nullbears will complain about "kiting pussy solo pvp'r" but do the same exact shit. Theyll have orthrus, garmur, retri, nomens etc all the same in their defense fleets.
---
Then you bring a brawling ship, and get met with a kitey response gang, or capitals. Then theyll feel superior that they killed a brawly ship in their kite gang. Then their gang gets fucked by a better kite gang and theyll then jump on reddit to complain.
---
Theyre hypocrits and then also come out in comps that are anti-brawling and then complain that all people do is kite. Well no shit, you squash any chance of brawling with "kiting pussy" tactics every chance they get. Its comical.
---
Depends on the markets, sometimes large skill injectors cost more per sp than buying a toon
---
grr razor, hat razor (probably without a valid reason, too)

To be the sad man
---
I find myself falling back on the mouse a lot, but I'm trying to get used to using the keyboard shortcuts. It reminds me of when I first started playing Starcraft hahaha...
---
alternatively, you could git gud and not die in your T3Cs
---
Well, that's a fair and humbling explanation. I stand corrected. Thank you.
---
Still, its a bit sad seeing people destroy their own ships on the undock like that.
---
I 100% agree - see my other posts in this thread for similar ideas.
---
Location, location, location.
---
Compared with 2014/2015, solo pvp isnt as free forming. You have to find kind of out of the way systems to find decent fights.
---
Go to Delve or any other large null group, youre going to get blobbed. Hit their outskirts, renters or smaller groups, you will sometimes find some fights.
---
Same with LS. People will say to go nennemalia or nearby systems. Youll just get blobbed or every fight will be tryhards in snaked or slaved pods. Hit the LS outskirts, even non FW and you will sometimes find the better fights.
---
Ive solo'd for at least 5 years now. The map and zkill are your best friends at finding better locations to hunt.

I think i should make some alpha accounts 
---
It's pointless always has been... I stopped flying them because I can't be arsed with the skill  loss
---
It's possible of course, but I'm less sure it applies, because I don't consider monetized cosmetics to be "tricks". There's nothing dishonest or manipulative in it. Everything's exactly what it appears to be: Cosmetics most people won't even see you using, for exorbitant prices. No one can say they're being manipulated or even incentivized towards anything by it. 
---
"Log-in Incentives" and the loot box mechanics and so on and so forth are far more sinister in that regard and actually do dip into the manipulative side of things. 
---
I feel like that's a very important distinction and cut-off point. 
---
CPU and PG management would probably be the most important. Then get your favorite race of frigate to V

Replace it with a red one too!

My steering wheel don't have F  Keys. FC what do?
---
I spent lots of hours mining from 09 onward with my 12 accounts; I had multiple rorquals in the belt starting around 2011.
---
I've not logged in since some time last spring.  I don't miss Eve; I miss what Eve is supposed to be.  We've all spent the past 10+ years playing the game, mainly hoping they would "fix it".
---
apparently now. its a thing that actually happens.
---
for torpedos and cruise missiles, their animation has 2 stages.
---
if the enemy dies before they reach target(and dmg ticker shows up)  then one of 2 things happen.
---
1. the launch stage, the missiles have launched but havent accelerated(that odd 90 degree instant turn to target),  if this happens, they all circle back to the center of where you were when you fired (if you moving, jsut behind you.  if you not. center of your ship) and then blow up. (animation. no dmg)
---
2. the acceleration stage, if they on this when the enemy dies but before dmg tick,  then they just continue to fly in straight line, and fly off to the eons.
---
if the dmg tick happens, they always fly to the enemy corpse and hit it, even if it dies 3 secounds before the animation shows them hitting.
---
I mean, if you've already lost 100b, I doubt a few more to re-inject is that much of a burden in a large alliance. So the mechanic kind of suppresses smaller groups, as usual.
---
capqu will just diplo them down tbh. His only goal in eve is to blue the map and then retire.
---
I don't think that we need to go that far. I do think some kind of mechanic needs to be in place to remove the spammy depots around gates and trade hubs tho.
---
no isk for you
---
It will right next to TAPI's January 2019 dreads and deployment.

10/10 would let squirt money on me

Ohh good looks. I meant to say Logi Frigs/Cruisers 5. Very useful.
---
Basically I suggest maximizing speed, and anything that makes your fleetmates more useful.
---
I guess. Idk, I like using shift + mouse click to overheat modules.
---
r/fittings
---
I have a problem with your statement . Fozzie never thought. Ever. He just does shit. 
---
I don't really see how you came to the conclusion that they have no weaknesses and that there is zero counterplay. Triglavian ships are weak to most forms of EW. Damps, neuts, jams, TD's, and neuts are all incredibly effective because they can consistently reset the DPS spool. Trig ships don't really hit hard unless you allow them to spool over the period of minutes.
---
If you watched the last AT, people were bringing full-neut bhaals, geddons, legions, vangels, curses, arbitrators, and pilgrims (basically everything that can conceivably fit neuts) often to very effectively counter the leshak spam. Without cap the leshak has zero DPS and quite low tank for an armor battleship. Additionally, on TQ where you can fit scripts to TDs and damps it's trivial to make trig ships useless with just a single maulus or crucifier. 
---
Looking at things from the perspective of a battleship or battlecruiser 1v1 in pyfa is pretty silly. Those situations just don't happen on the real server outside of arranged duels. Take a solo or duo drek/lesh against even a very small (5 man or less) gang with cheap ships and the weaknesses become apparent. The ships, especially the lesh, are very cap hungry and will chew through cap boosters in scant minutes, and any sort of EW support will severely hamper them if not leave them completely useless. The kiki is very good, but a lot of that is because they get access to small FW complexes where the toughest competition is relatively low DPS AFs.  
---
tldr 
---
Already did back in the Hold'em days and when you could bet on AT. Your vigs were the most reasonable. 
---
Eve Online is still the best game in it's Genre for a Sandbox MMO, I honestly have never been able to replicate the rush that Eve has given me over the last decade in any other MMO. The Economy matters, PVP/relationships with other players/The Market/Industry etc. are the things that have kept me playing for so long, and EVE does them better than any other MMO experience. Eve has actually ruined other games for me because the Market/Economy often doesn't matter in those games (Sell to Vendors etc.). Simply put, I don't think there is another game out there where you, as the player, are able to be as influential on the game world and other players as you can be in eve. If you have a dream in eve, the knowledge and the backing to pull it off, you can have consequences on the entire playerbase. 
---
I do agree that it has lost some of it's mystery, although given that it's just a few months shy of being a 16 year old game that is probably to be expected.   
---
I think Nullsec has been stagnating steadily over the last 2-3 years. We're seeing a decrease in fresh blood, and old alliances are withering and being absorbed into other more successful old alliances. Felt really disappointing to see some old names like MC. fold last year. Ultimately I feel that the current Capital balance in eve along with Rorquals is what is causing this brain-drain to happen. We're just seeing super-entrenched forces become even more entrenched, with the only way to rout the enemy being to become part of one of these select groups and farming non-stop to get more injectors to get more rorquals to get more supers to make rorqual farming safer to get more injectors. The loop continues. All sides continually increase in super/titan numbers so no progress can be made. Sup-Capital ships do not feel like they are nearly as impactful as they once were, because Titans/Supers and Carriers out-class them even in anti-sub duties. So it kind of feels like there are 5-6 unisegeable castles full of respawning gold that you can't do anything meaningful to as nomadic or less established group. The only meaningful metric most of the time is how many Capitals they have vs how many Capitals you have.

Defending Krabs to protect this core loop of just generating wealth and supers means tech 1 destroyer roams just get Carrier'd if the locals are feeling generous, BOSON'd if they're not. So we've seen a reduction in the number of Nomadic/PVP focused groups because if the defenders care enough about them there is little they can achieve in regions like Delve, Esoteria and Branch. We have new PVE such as wormholes, Abyss, FOBs but the more than decade old Anoms and Mining is what is run by 90% of the playerbase because of how it feeds back into this loop. It does feel like there isn't really much special in the game when it comes to value anymore outside of AT Prize Ships and maybe Pirate Titans, because Supers/Titans are so common place now they don't feel special. Whenever I see a titan it's about as commonplace as seeing a slightly off-meta faction cruiser now. Oh a Scythe-Fleet Issue is here, neat.

I really want to see nerfs to capital ships in how they interact with subs, nerfs to capital umbrellas, and some kind of sovereignty shake up which makes things a lot more interesting again.   
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm still enjoying eve and I change things up every now and then to keep it fun for me. PVP in eve still is the best I've experienced even 12 years in now. Probably still will be here in 12 years time. It still is the best game on the market if you want a PVP sandbox MMO.

Very good, very good, now anchor up!

My F1 is cloak
---
Well put, my friend, thank you!
---
Not a bad idea. Not sure if getting rid of them completely is the answer, but maybe making them much harder/more expensive to use is.
---
HK is allied with PH, PL, and NC.
---
and BL i think, but BL just reset horde  and now have a relationship with them like snuff does to imperium
---
regardless, they would be helped.
---
Started in May of 2013, so I am about complete my 6th year. Not a real vet, but I was lucky enough to see the game in it's best state and have been witness to the changes.
---
Half of me LOVES New Eden now. Nullsec has evolved to these super efficient city-like regions, and it is fascinating to see how players are using the tools to make it such a safe and profitable space. The cooperation needed is monumental, and I am excited to see how the next few years play out.
---
The other half of me wishes for the pre-skill injector days. I remember training my characters for Chimeras and a Revelation. I remember a Titan being a lofty goal. I now have a carrier, dread, super and titan on my main (reeeee no dedicated super pilot) and feel like I have *nothing left to train*. What do I do now? Get a second Titan and do those boring trains again? Just so I can do what, boson rat in a levi instead of an Avatar? So I can respond to the next War to press F1 in TiDi? Fuck that. I think this game lost it's ability for players to connect and commit to their trainings with skill injectors, not to mention the ability for all pilots to sit into whatever is meta immediately, do ridiculous things like have 60 booshers ready to go at will. (Not knocking the actual gameplay of the excav booshing, which was super creative and right in line with what EVE is all about.) 
---
I don't know. I think we as players need to adjust how we are playing to solve some of these issues. But there is fault with some of the changes, no doubt about that. EVE is no longer about the game. EVE is just about them making money.
---
No Sir, it is most definitely you who is unhinged, and you have convincingly demonstrated that fact for anyone who cares to follow these posts. But in addition you have also amply demonstrated your illiteracy and lack of the most basic English comprehension. I suggest you pay more attention in class and remember to take your medication. I sincerely hope your condition improves. Good day to you Sir.

He had to remove it and put a cap battery, so it would be cap stable

So we agree that 50% are bots. Ok.

i thought neut ones would be super strong, just not sure if they got used or if mechanics made them less valuable than they appear on paper. Thanks for the response!
---
whos talkin?
---
Noooooooo! Stay here, while there is still hope!
---
You just said if there were disintegrator locuses the drek would instantly supplant feroxes in fleets, which obviously isn't true. People don't even really fly Vultures anymore which are way above the power level of a ferox. Vultures are just a way better blob ship than a range boosted, downtanked drek if you're looking to spend 600m each on a battlecruiser.
---
&gt;switch chars training on same account without logging out
---
You know what, I know CCP is concerned about caching issues for switching whole characters without logging out but I feel like this would be a good compromise.  Considering the "plex vault" is across characters I wonder if there is already a way to show/interact with data from another character on the same account that could extend to this.
---
tri is there now tho, and snuff will have acess to the area previously occupied by fedup so good luck dropping supers or even caps. When we were fighting with oldschool and banderlogs dropped like 10b worth of carriers snuff popped out and dropped them without any intel from us at least(the attackers), now with tri in the area things will just get worse.
---
Although I’d agree it’s useful (albeit not as useful as the cone). The skills will only happen if you plan them out right. Which is where OP is at. This is a planning phase post FC, not a skill improvement post.

Long time Vet (2009), Small gang pilot, Competent Fast tackle, AT Pilot and Practice pilot, and I lament of a game that is slowly slipping from what it once was.  While I will probably be stating a ton of redundancy here, I want to start by saying I had a love for this game, and for a time it seemingly loved me back. Gradually however the rush has subsided, the excitement become mundane, the ruthlessness and lack of regulation I once loved sterilized at the cries of the ignorant or simple.  
---
I think the game is, as big a cliche it is to say "dying" and I think I know why. I know why it's not the same for me, I can speak somewhat for others with similar interests and play styles. It's fallen away from it's roots, the harsh hostilie and dangerous space has been sterilized in favor of ISK gain and safety. The mechanics in place favor safety, the defender, and the bear. The Player base falls to two sides a large mass of warm bodies feeding the super alliance they are a part of with little in the way of thought process, employing every opportunity to game the system for gain. A willing member of a monstrosity that will eventually stagnate the universe into a conflict-less snore, and while the industry side of things is necessary to fuel the war machine there needs to be a balance.  
---
The other side of the coin is the innovator, the individual looking for adventure, the lone wolf or the wolf pack, unbounded diplomatic ties and often nomadic. This type of play finds new ways to fly, produces workable and interesting fits, and his ideas are either frowned upon or stolen in most cases. It is this pilot, not the line pilot that drives conflict that produces engaging content, finds new ways to wage war, and evades the blob mentality, but slowly his place is in decline, the holes he finds in the armor plugged, in the interest of the uninteresting.  
---
Too much of this game is played "outside the game" Intel being collected from nearly every out of game tool used, the networks we have created in play are  astounding. While these tools in themselves are not inherently bad, it takes some of the "play" out of the game. Part of the success of a large alliances is in fact determined by the quality of communications, operational security, counter-intelligence, intelligence and diplomatic ties which occur COMPLETELY outside the game itself. While this is something that makes EvE unique, it is also something that cannot be controlled or moderated by the game developers. In the end this had led to battles that are decided completely outside of game over a handshake and a beer. Not that diplomacy is bad, it's simply not very interesting for those not directly involved. Sharing information and fits is part of this dynamic, and really it depends on which camp you fall as sharing a successful fit in itself is going to make you vulnerable to a counter fitting in the large scale, the information for the most part is freely available if you know who to look at on zkillboard, and intuitive if you have a large game knowledge base.  
---
Resources are one of the number one drivers of conflict both in many RTS's and IRL, and without a doubt resources in eve are too plentiful, Imagine a universe where one had to fight over asteroids because the asteroids close to home had been depleted and probably wouldn't be found again for another month. Likewise prior to the current moon changes Imagine if the R64 moon that was providing a large influx of cash to the alliance was gradually depleted only to respawn somewhere else forcing an alliance to move to recover that resource. As it stands there is no reason to pack up and move anywhere, in fact the vast majority of null systems and non-faction low sec is unused rather than contested.  
---
Castles are too safe, there is nothing to go out and pillage, no short term relevant objective a group can accomplish without timers and waiting periods, no reason to take a fleet into space beyond, "because we want to blow this thing up." or "because we are super bored and want to do something." fights are stagnant there is no sense of urgency to form and defend, and in some cases no feasible way to contest. While this does make for some of the most populated battles in the gaming world and this is sensational news, in practice these battles are stagnant, binary exercising in FC knowledge and Depth hinged on who was more prepared and likely awake for the timer you have been waiting for for 3 days.  
---
We used to have short term objectives with lucrative rewards "Static DED" sites offered a point of interest and conflict over a potentially lucrative spawn. The Static Event sites are similar to these old DED sites, and are some of the most popular points of interest among my group of small gang vets.  The ESS mechanic is one of the most underutilized things in the game because it offers an avenue for conflict to occur (IMO ESS shouldn't be an option but a requirement.) Can flipping was the pirate fast track to a cargo full of ore. Station camping and gate camping and this sometimes stationary, neutral flooded game play is the task of the experienced pilot to find a way to game the High Sec community. Some of these methods are broken and need to be addressed. These avenues of play are slowly disappearing. This wouldn't be a huge issue if High Sec wasn't so abundantly lucrative and easy. I suspect that there are players of eve that have never ventured outside the bubble of security because there is no reason to, resource scarcity being non existent. Remember easy and risk less to me is boring.   
---
(1/2)  
---
Even the Faction Warfare low sec battles don't make too much sense both in rewards and time frame, it takes hours to flip the control of a system most of which is dominated by dull uncontested 15 min point control. When conflict does come along in the interest of profit often times those running the gated sites simply warp away choosing to avoid a fight long before an aggressor (read: interesting things producer) would even have a chance to engage. Why fight when you can simply wait for the aggressor to get bored and leave allowing you to acquire the LP you wanted in the first place?  
---
The objectives are occurring on to long of a time frame to hold interest. Additionally the non LP rewards for controlling systems are nearly irrelevant, no one really establishes market hubs in low, we can only have 6 clones total (IIRC) the rewards are appealingly centered on game play that IS NOT IN SPACE. Why doesn't controlling space offer static defenses, special missions, or unique tangible rewards? Why un-dock when I can stay docked and be rewarded? Changing a tax % from a 4 to a 5 is hardly my idea of an exciting reward.   
---
Interesting conflict in essence at least in some cases needs to be non-consensual. The potential to take a loss because a band of mercs decided to ruin your sandcastle or you were not there to defend it, should be an available option for objectives from a low to mid teir of importance. (These types of objectives barely exist.) Players like to feel like they have an influence on the game, and long term objectives to me have begun to feel not particularly relevant. In the case of Supers the effort and risk that would be involved in killing often is greater than the value of the would be target, again favoring a static dynamic. Gone are the days of a quick, and Covert strike on enemy assets backed by an alliance. Intel networks and local far to strong to let operations like that run smoothly one needs spies in place and sometimes even blue tackle, just to pull off a kill that can be replaced in a days worth of effort. In fact it is common in todays game to simply throw away assets just to claim that one has undocked or done something. This would have been pure insanity in the years prior.  
---
The state of EvE is not beyond fixing but it would take a lot of work, I would say give more relevance to smaller groups doing things that would help a larger group, add shorter term objectives that feel relevant to larger objectives. Local chat in particular might be a good place to start, adding a footing for gorilla warfare that changes the dynamic of the larger battle, via the disruption of the vast amount of information that local provides pilots. One of the first things a swat team might do before an operation is cut the phone lines.  
---
Eve is very much like a game of chess so consider your pieces and their usages, if any one pieces becomes too powerful, or the prevailing strategy, the winning move every time, you have a problem. The opportunity for very interesting play in a 3d space exists but is rarely utilized, often fights are very binary in nature. Strategies must exist to exploit any position taken, if they fail to exist they need to be created or things need to change. Players must at times be forced into vulnerable positions, be put into Intel darkness, and taken out of their comfort zones if eve is to survive. It is too easy to encamp, with no illusion of a fair fight and far to much Intel to be caught off guard. The defender wins the day, and he has little reason to leave his castle, and can infact 3d print a new castle quite easily.  
---
TL:DR  
---
The Defender is too safe, and can collect his goods safely.  
---
The Expectation of the blob is security not conflict or innovation.  
---
The Resources are too abundant and do not drive conflict.  
---
The Positions of the board are not balanced.  
---
The Cost of holding space makes little sense.  
---
The Conflicts are not necessary.  
---
The Pieces of the board are not balanced.  
---
The Large Objectives happen on too long a time frame or lack tangible relevance.  
---
The Small Objectives barely exist or lack tangible relevance  
---
The Opportunities for lucrative gorilla warfare have been in decline.

Just join a real wormhole corporation and let the people that specialize do their job while you play the game.
---
IKR, I mean they already know that the other char is training because they warn you saying the char name is already training and spam you with buying an MPT... I couldn't be that hard to add a button to pause the other skill queue without logging in.
---
its not a phase, retributions are who i am!
---
yeah that's true, only problem rn would be the kiki. 
---
was a fun fight.. I was in the goon jackdaw fleet that was stomping on the logi
---
Pgl raged at a newbro tristan so bad he left fleet then demanded that he get back in fleet.  It was so bad drack had to meet with the guy to apologize
---
Make no one drop dreads and limit fax pilots to super alts, sounds about right.
---
I've never seen a person more ready for war.
---
as epic as that would be, I understand there could be a lot of issues actually switching chars... I'm ONLY asking for the skill queue's to change... such a small thing...
---
The poor chap seems quite delusional, but I am sure after he has taken his medication, and perhaps gotten a good cud to chew on, he will recover his composure and moo contently. 
---
Ship replacement through SRP programs doesn't even factor in insurance costs. So on an alliance level, nothing would change. The cost would be on the player, which is where most of the isk in the game resides anyway.
---
tbh, I'd much rather have to replace each ship at full cost than have fleets of feroxes that cost next to nothing. Battlecruisers and T1 battleships are so cheap to replace that it makes them meaningless. Capitals are almost as bad.
---
I don't have anything constructive to say, but this thread has some good ideas IMHO.
---
I bet you wouldn't go on a bitchslapping tour in an Amarr titan, though.
---
I think that's more aimed at supers and carriers than anything else. It's kinda shitty when just about any subcap fleet can be countered by dropping supers on it.
---
According to Reddit I switch alliance every two days depending on what I say or comment. Once Goons, once PL, once Shadow Cartel, once Caldari Provision. 
---
I prefer the built in low quality keyboards of an old laptop to get to see those old potato graphics, and the feel of being a meta 0 warrior. 
---
Give it time
---
How about put in Supercap loss skills instead?
---
You don't run the anoms, you run missions in npc space.
---
It was finished building and not completed. Otherwise it would have dropped as parts
---
Wow they're really gate camping? Things must be really desperate for them to undock and kill things.
---
Great list, exactly what I was after. Cheers mate
---

---
That's exactly my point.  This doesn't affect large alliances. It *does* affect small alliances and single corps who don't have/can't afford comprehensive SRP. So it's just more power in the hands of large alliances who are already winning conflicts through attrition.
---
no he's saying that used to exist
---
it did 
---
Legacy is a battlehardened force that could have won all their wars w/o Goon help. Prove me wrong.
---
I think this solves the issue here.
---
Other people playing the game a different way than you is pathetic? Ok. nerd :D
---
That was a short deployment....
---
maybe you should try not dying.
---
100% no.
---
Using a blaster corm to oneshot cyno ships is also excellent
---
WE’RE NOT DOWN HERE FOR GOOD FIGHTS. AND WE DON’T CARE ABOUT IF PGL OR VILY THINKS WE’RE BLOBBONG [SIC]. THEY’VE TALKED SO MUCH SHIT ABOUT PL AND HOW WE AREN’T COMMITTED TO OUR DEPLOYS AND HOW TEST IS THIS BATTLE HARDENED GROUP. WELL WE’RE HERE TO TELL THEM TO NUT UP OR SHUT UP. THEY’RE GOING TO BE HOMELESS SOON
---
How long was horde in branch?
---
id 100% leave the caps out of the invasion, cheaply aquire the space by using low cost doctrines and by denying the enemy a fight, if you have good FCs then look at a war of attrition, they will want you gone but try not to die while snagging whatever kills you can (slippery pete if you can get the numbers then just third party)
---
as for space youll want to get a less valued area of space, stay away from all of the big boys, i suggest using a npc station as a mid point so that you can pick deep null.. itll be quiter and maybe easier to fight for and youll be able to keep a logistics chain.. then just increase your borders as much as you can without pissing anyone off and once you start reaching close borders with larger entities youll need to start looking at forming NIPs at least, maybe looking at joining forces at most...
---
or you could just join a larger entity in the first place
---
but im a wormholer so maybe not
---
lol the asshurt is real 
---
Precursor weapon specializations. Do they have higher drop rates in higher tier abyssals, or is the drop rate the same regardless?
---
should have used the boosters that were in the last event that allowed you to use 3 skill injectors without any diminishing returns. You would get a full 500k per large injector

I did use a couple, but didn't have enough to purchase more at the time.
---
:thinking face:
---
Fuck that. Put skill loss on death back in. This game doesn't need any more watering down.
---
In the age of injectors it's just an add-on to the isk price tag.
---
What would I possibly be asshurt about?
---
Keres with good skills is so sexy
---
Admit defeat? Hardly
---
We just showed the entire north how 1 alliance can cause them to shit their pants. I am sad we are dropping pressure as I enjoyed hunting horde like the dogs they are, however we need to regroup and then be warned panfam. TEST is aiming for your fucking jugular. Crab safely while you can.

Dreddit
---
why?
---
Maybe you should try not being a twat
---
I dont really see how having fewer individual pilots than the big ones is a thing that is new to PL or holding PL back tbh.
---
Scram, web, ewar, then guns. F1 thru F4
---
F1 is cloak, F2 is MWD, always. F5 is usually the gun button.

Some people think that there are ships without cloaks. I think they're crazy.
---
Your drop with goons was a big hit the other day nice job
---
"1 alliance"
---
Is this original content? 
---
I like your style. 😎👌🏻
---
Kick the 400 people who really just want sov so they can carrier rat in peace, live in NPC null with fewer mouths to feed, and harass the ever living hell out of all your sov-holding and moon-holding neighbors until they eventually get fed up and kick you out. Repeat elsewhere on the map until your original location gets complacent again. You get all the fun of invading with none of the inconvenience and obligations that trail along behind winners as prizes.
---
Personally, I look at fits for them, say "hey pretty good", then look at the injectors and factor in the cost of retraining/reinjecting, at which point the price:effectiveness ratio falls right into the dumpster.  Skill loss is effectively inverse insurance these days, and makes the ships absurdly expensive if you don't believe "the skills I train are free"
---
God dammit I hope so 
---
I could do this exact same thing with Microsoft Publisher in 1/9000 of the time.
---
But yours looks pretty nice though!
---
Hunters can shut down a whole region of activity because the response to them is to avoid conflict, rather than defending your space actively. It's actually quite hard to get anything notable done as a person or group looking for targets in space. Hours of effort for a hand full of kills if one is lucky. The intel networks of most large groups and some smaller ones warn of aggressors in space long before said aggressors could ever catch anyone especially if they are paying any attention at all. In most cases simply showing up as a pilot in local provides ample time to get safe. It's only the inattentive or patterned play and the crafty spies that net "relevant" kills.  
---
Truth be told it's even hard for a non specialized anti-carrier group to engage a carrier in sub capitals at all. Especially if the carrier pilot has any experience at all, or a backing alliance.
---
now this is podracing
---
losing a war a week after starting it?
---
The vast majority of EVE roleplayers are trash, so this wouldn't even surprise me.
---
ok
---
Well, to be fair, they are all goons so....

If i remember correctly when you set a new password it will let you know if that password is found in any of the data dumps that haveibeenpwnd has in its database.

F1 is always siege or cyno
---
I like to live dangerously
---
So if you log in to an eve account with a Pwned password, it lets you know it's been part of a breach and you should not be using it/change it.
---
EVE has a system which basically talks to haveibeenpwned (Simply speaking) to assist with this.
---
What this means is as part of the new breach, the system has been updated with the new information.
---
tl;dr as part of security EVE lets you know if your passwords have been used in previous breaches
---
Ok this must be a new copypasta or something
---
No link to said study. Hmmmm
---
We lost two cap fights.
---
Read the pastebin.  We had quite a few objectives when we came north, and we missed on one.

I hardly consider that losing a war.

Sure, just increase the cost of the WH space mats that are needed to build them to partially compensate for the loss in cost. 
---
That way, you still have to pay more than 350-400mil for a ship that can be cloaky, nullified, and still kill 95% of ships cruiser sized and below.

I believe what he is referencing is the warning to notify you if your EVE account password shows up on Pwned Passwords.

How many guys u usually have showing up to this?  Me and another eve bro in Durham have talked about attending but just haven't found the time yet.  I'm unfortunately busy on the 19th but would love to make it down there in the future. 
---
Because I wanted a hi-res PLEX icon. 
---
hey u dumb fuck did you see the last br? idiot? u guys blobbed and had goon batphone and still lost to a new player alliance with a TRASH FC lmao
---
Longer than a week. 
---
Needed more stabs, obviously.
---
I'd like to personally congratulate TAPI for running what i believe is the shortest campaign ever in eve at an impressive 5 days, this beats the previous record of Imperiums defence of Stainwagon (10 days). Good work team!
---
but why you wanted to high res plex icon?
---
I see a lot of lament about the skill injectors, and it reminds me of being a player that was a couple of years old and lamenting my training choices. I think I had even floated the idea on the forums back then about being able to take skillpoints from one skill and put them in another skill, albeit with a point loss penalty. No selling points, it was a self-contained system. The idea was met with derision, players saying it would never happen, you had to live with your choices in Eve, etc.
---
Now look where we are. I think part of what Eve is missing is that idea that you have to live and die by your choices. I liked the idea of skill injectors when they first came out, but I'm not sure about them anymore. I get the feeling from some of the responses here is that they've created more problems than being a good thing. That's just my perception of the matter though.
---
 Admit defeat? Hardly.  We just showed the entire north how 1 alliance can't do anything without a large goon batphone.

Welcome to the party dude! 
---
TFW when Piggle got slamdunked so hard, he needed Vily to write the alliances sick note.
---
I am in full disagreement with this, I thought fozzie sov was one of the best changes to the sov mechanic possible, and it caused a ton of very engaging an interesting conflict. Who feed you this honey to be barfed up on the topic?
---
I agree with the sentiment behind the skills and your post.  I just don't agree with the implementation.  Even CCP recognized that the only logical move was to not train any skills at all until your learning skills were done, and every single character should logically train every single one of the skills.  It didn't make any sense in the context of a choice-oriented RPG system.
---
Things like implants and stat optimization on the other hand are just fine.  They add a little spice and depth to the training, but don't railroad you.
---
Yeah, I got nothing. I still think Test should just dudes for welping posts.
---
One alliance? Did you write this one handed while you continue goon jacking with the other?
---
no, its not "officially" started yet 
---
It's almost like we've been up North for longer than a week.
---
It does, and it helps me get a better grasp of where we are with the game as a whole. Everything that happens in this game tends to reverberate through the entire universe, not just in a particular region.
---
It's not a defeat, we are going back to help our allies who are in very danger

https://dscan.info/v/9333959c93f1 within jump range of your timer while fighting alliances that are very well known for their love of dropping caps you gotta start making some calls.

I know a lot of people complain about it...but as a long time (took a long break and now returning) player, I actually like The Agency. It's helped me to get my sea-legs back and I find it a good way to get a direction when I'm sitting in space thinking "what should I do now".

There's one thing missing from this, and that's that if you want to be a Nullsec group you want to begin developing FCs that can deal with real fleets. You can do this by trying to hunt and tackle things that will generate these kinds of fights where you have at least 15-20 DPS ships, 4-5 Logi, and the assorted support ships. Other options include fighting over local high-value R64/32 moons, or forcing your neighbors to come break up gatecamps.
---
Sov fights are a good way to try and split the attention of bigger groups into smaller fleets to fight as well, or at least make it harder for them to cap blob you.
---
downvoted.
---
Im a new player about 4 or 5 months in and HATED the frig plan. Its almost impossible to find 1v1 frig fights and you dont learn much dying in 5 seconds. Ive learned way more running t1 cruisers with t1 fitting and only around 50 mil a ship.
---
Supers and capitals  alongside numbers and FAX mechanics have made sub-capitals largely irrelevant gone are the days of neuting support from Bhaalgorns and Geddons to break logistic chains. The Dynamic needs another look and a more thought out rework.
---
TFW you believe the meme.
---
Do people really pimp out their non-factions supers to 100b still?
---
There's no way to reach KWG without going through either Legacy, Legacy pets, or Fraternity.
---
Cloud Ring is a rough place to be TBH, your alliance members will have better isk opportunities and more content in a place like Curse or Venal.

imagine choosing to be in the trial alliance of a goon pet
---
You misspelled next Saturday. It’s not even actually started yet. They’ll show you
---
https://dscan.info/v/9333959c93f1 within jump range of timer after their cynos were seen lurking around.
---
so test is going home/random raiding,  is goons sticking around?  we got a bunch of hyperactive newbeans salivating over their new ships
---
That's not a nice thing to call PGL.
---
that's very mean, he had to make up having a kid who plays eve and here you go pissing on that parade

Everyone is forgetting to buff the proteus

I believe there is a consensus on the entire deployement being a meme

haha memes xd
---
Where's the fun/challenge in killing high sec miners?
---
 I rebound my F keys to 1 to 8, and put the mid slots keys on Q to Y, and low slot keys on A to H.
---
Then I put guns on 1, prop on 2, tackle on 3 and up. Ship specific mods like boosh button on t3ds, bomb launchers or dictor bubbles go on D, and cloaks and stuff go on Z. Tank mods go on the Q row.
---
F keys now get used for fighters. F1 selects all, then F2 to F7 select individual tubes.
---
The skillpoints I mine are free.
---
Tell us more
---
jeez you finns have some weird flavored foods.
---
Yeah moas are great. T1 Cruiser's are a good choice for pvp as they insure well and allow you to make more mistakes than frigates. However they can be a very enticing target too.

You're right. I apologize :(

just ask simple farmers
---
if you want to use those 10 supers first of all get way more faxes. I'd say yall should just liquidate those supers and try to convert them into more dreads in a 2-1 ratio(with pilot costs etc), maybe get rid of half the faxes too? that way you'd probably become quite capable of dreadbombing shit, and dreadbombs are way more cost effective and attract less attention than dropping supers, and don't need faxes.
---
No doubt a nightmare is better, at one point I was very space poor and running blood raider DED sites in a bhaal was better than a VNI. Bhaals are much cheaper than a nightmare.
---
Is it an invasion if it's empty?
---
Rewards are a bit low, but the intent is great. High sec is worth fighting for. 
---
dont apologize, just dont let it happen again. always be excellent to one another, and party on dudes
---
Spin it however you want, but the fact is that it wasn't [that short](http://i.imgur.com/linRI8K.jpg).
---
For spin to work, it has to based in something that can at least be stretched to resemble the truth.

Formaldehyde ruins the taste.

Careful now, #DayoftheMeteor

I too think the Agency is a good addition to the game. I have some complaints about the usability and intuitiveness of the UI.
---
I expected a your gay pwnd. Now Im disapointed
---
truly, the apm of starcraft pros
---
Has the Moros meta returned??
---
Depends on the ship. For tackle-reliant ships, point is F1, then web, then guns. 
---
Cloaky scout ships have an F1 cloak
---
DPS fits are always F1 guns
---
being able to adjust your skill q's acountwide would be a nice change tbh having to log back into a different character for that is just a chore and nothing more
---
You clearly need [one of these babies](http://www.billybuerger.com/pages/20180103/KailhBigSwitch.jpg)
---
This is disgusting. They log in, activate hack and jump to their fort before they even materialise. Litteraly. There is just no time to do anything else. Like how is this supposed to be fair. Meanwhile Falcon is parading around saying that we should calm down and that everything is fine.
---
All part of the plan. Can't lose a war you never declare!
---
There's a bunch of reasons MKAD still exists as a thing, and none of them are things that a 500 man coalition can reasonably deal with.
---
The primary issue is that at the end of the day, you need to stage from somewhere, and there isn't anywhere decent within 30 jumps of MKAD space to stage. The closest NPC nullsec is Venal, and to get to outer passage from Venal you need to go through MKAD's daddy protector in the form of Skill Urself. You won't be able to really effectively use most forms of capital forces, and if you try to anchor something closer to stage from it will get cap blobbed.
---
This is the underrated post ITT...
---
Yeah I should be careful since the campaign starts on Saturday. You're right.
---
Honestly the more important thing is that you can inject skills that where not popular like a year ago. 
---
So if CCP comes up with a massive boost to armor supers you can switch from shield to armor relatively quickly, where as in the past this was a majority issue. 
---
OK
---
That’s gonna be a yikes from me dawg
---
And this is bad because?
---
That chocolate licorice stuff was the weirdest best food I have ever had  
---
does it beat the goon northern deployment before the last war 
---
😂 Love you too Alu, don't worry. Have a special place for all my SPDR bros.
---
1 Titan, 10 Supers, but only 10 Fax. Someone's not pulling their weight / really doesn't want a pocket fax.
---
A properly fit kiki costs way goddamn more than a Corm...sounds fair to me.  Pay more...get more.
---
Dude this was a pretty friggin cool cinematic video!
---
All skulls are used skulls...
---
Well, you could pack up and try deploying somewhere.
---
then why are you giving up on the war if you didn't lose it
---
:thinking:
---
1-4 is highs
---
Q-r is mids (q is always prop)
---
A-D is lows. That was the keyboard and mod layout are always the same so one never needs to look down 
---
Likely also the costliest per day, at roughly 150-200b/day of losses!
---
Read the pastebin.  It's all in there including the part about us not really giving up the "war".
---
Really...doesnt that kind of detract from the fact that things in Wormholes are generally unknown until they are discovered or, in the case of local, given away?
---
I just said I'm fine with the more expensive ones having longer timers. 
---
Reading is hard. It's almost like you spend a lot more a wetu then a 1.2mil depo thats spammed in jita.

Vily says that

&gt;Over the course of three months we have taken our enemies main income source, [...]
---
We don't know if high-sec was horde's main income source. But let's assume it was (is). If you go look at the actual plex and injector market, and see which structures are being used, it's PANFAM aligned structures a lot of the time. Controlling the high-sec market is a lot more difficult than what TEST leadership makes it seem.
---
I mean don't take my word for it. Go look yourself. For the last couple weeks, TEST has been having almost no control over said market.

Still a horrendous place to stage from

If you don't shout this idiot down, though, CCP might actually believe him and nerf the whole triglavian lineup.

I feel like The Agency is a good place to start, I did the missions it offered at least.

As an AT pilot I like some of the changes that were made to the AT rule set (not all) mostly because it kept the meta fresh and innovative, and dissuaded the use of the same stale but effective strategies from year to year.  
---
That's a fascinating little piece of information, tha no you for that!
---
Holy fuck. Perfect counter would literally be Arty Tempest.... Way cheaper, Alpha their logi, double heavy neuts for trig ships, extra mids for Tracking Disruptors, and pretty damn good resists and buffer for a t1 battleship doctrine.
---
And if you want to be a real dickhole, ec-300's to wreck random leshaks.

If you are fighting dreks, you just need 12 tempest to nearly alpha them, lmao.

Didn't the 'official' deployment start like last weekend or something?
---
No, but the two comments you're replying to are talking about a titan
---
AUTZ kills
---
You can't beat the amount of money (aka CCP income) generated by a single supercap pilot.
---
And don't give them bounty or let them drop anything or it will be just more income and nothing else.
---
You identify a potential target.  They need to be smaller, and not really as connected which is largely going to limit where you get to exist, likely a drone region or cloud ring area.  
---
You're going to want to identify a group in your timezones so you're not attacking a russian or aussie group that can just timezone tank your smaller group.  
---
Next you need to start stretching your opponent.  You'll need a solid lowsec or NPC 0.0 base nearby to base from and strike and you're going to need to start applying pressure to the existing alliance in as many timezones as you can.  Cloaky camping alone isn't enough, you'll need to actually deny services without suffering heavy losses yourself so hit and run skirmishing and black ops drops are the order of the day, the goal being to prevent mining and ratting in an area to begin to soften the games mechanics of the system and stress your enemies line members.  
---
Avoid head to head confrontations for the first few weeks, you should be a painful thorn in your enemies sides, not a directly addressable problem.  You're going to create random timers all over the space you intend to take, you will respond to absolutely NONE of the timers you create, when your enemy is responding to a timer you've created you're either out creating a new timer or nowhere to be found.  
---
Your goal at this point is winning a marathon, not a sprint.  
---
After a month of waterboarding your enemy you should start to see cracks, if you dont, carry on the initial plays a bit longer, but once the cracks form, you start becoming a larger threat.  Responses to timers will taper off, as they start half assing things because they assume you're not going, this is when you strike and crush the weak response.  You'll see a spark of life here, their next form ups will be larger and more assertive, avoid these as per normal, and keep the rope a dope up.  Soon you'll see them NOT forming for timers at all, this is now your chance to take what you want, but only when you sense apathy from your opponent.  
---
This should be your base level playbook as a younger newer guy trying to break in.  
---
&gt; I could do this exact same thing with Microsoft Publisher in 1/9000 of the time.
---

---
On the one hand the risk and reward of flying without an updated clone or investing in learning skills was one that made your characters choices feel more relevant. The lack of pay for power made investing time into the game reasonable.  
---
On the other hand the skills were a barrier to entry in a game where said skills have only a nominal effect on game play. This prevented new blood from gaining a footing or in some cases being able to enjoy play.  
---
While it didn't feel good to have all my years of time invested in skill training fall to less relevance, I think the game is healthier overall for the existence of injectors.
---
This was before they had a mining bonus, best way was to Vexor + mining drones it up.  FeelsOldMan
---
Yes! 
---
I have a Razor Chroma keyboard also. Seems to be a solid keyboard to be honest, but the only thing that drives me absolutely crazy is the location of the macro keys on the left side.
---
During fleet missing CTRL and hitting the M1 key and my game and computer throws up all over itself. I don't even know what the hell is mapped to the damn macro. Probably my kid mapping something on it.

"some caps existed a region away, therefore this isn't a blob"
---
Moons were a great alliance-level strategic resource to fight over, and being able to create a timer that people had to fight over on short notice was fantastic; kept people from drumming up support and having massive showings. 
---
"some caps existed a region away so its not a blob"

Arts &amp; Crafts is HABIT I think,  idk I think I’d do the fanfic tbh because I have PTSD from sticking an airfix model to my nose and try to pass it off as inspecting the weld rather than a glue sniffing attempt to my parents Wasn’t aware at the time glue sniffing involved aerosol base propellants. I probably ate a lot of crayons at playskool. I lost Eve for the second time and missed the Brave dramas but did hear the tales from Travis &amp; co when I returned late 15.  I have a lot of affection for Gobbins and a lot of the old guard like Jeff Raider, my opinion of PL is probably outdated as 3 years is a long time, and a lot of people have moved on and maybe new blood is removing some of the aspects I affectionately haze PL for, I ran into a few guys who thought they were the shit because of the ticker and assumed if you were horde you were scrub, when guys like Grath, Jeff and others were really rolling out the carpet so I got a bit salty about a class of players who maybe thought they were better than others. I did a lot of small Corp gang ‘onorable ransom piracy and merc play late 04’-08’ with a close knit group and no drama and having seen all my original friends leave over the years you end up feeling like an outsider looking in to a life you once lived and breathed. I loved the time I spent in Horde helping newbros, supplying the station and feeling useful again when it was small enough you’d go on a pos bash or sov wand with Gobbins as FC and a dozen guys or be six guys taking a pos down talking shit. Now it’s 17k+ i’m not sure it has that vibe so much and at heart I’m a legacy of small-gang roaming nano vagabond annoyances and cancer falcons flying with the same gang day in day out so you really gel as a team, I burned out of the big fleet meta quickly and missed having a nyx to hotdrop, which wasn’t viable with such a small cap support group, and couldn’t get on enough with waffles culture at the time then skilljectors hit and it suddenly all felt a bit shit and I parked up and walked away. beyond shitposting for effect I really couldn’t care less about alliance politics, and all the decent nomadic merc pirate groups don’t seem to fit as well into Titans online. Not bitter though, still love the game for some dumb reason, even if the only reason I can find to login atm is sit in a police skinned Kronos keeping a eye on a few newbros and chucking them some isk or help to send them on their own journey. I just can’t take certain srs spaceship bizness seriously enough not to laugh at salty ragedramas. So Idk, no vouches, need to relearn 3 years meta and eft witchcraft, need at least some krabbing to join the Titan + nyx ball, 170m+, 155m+ supercaps and every specialist role in the game and an amalgamated 70m subcap specialist. Done dictors, hictors, nanos, Ewar, survived living in Tama and Rancer, scouting wh’s, dreads, carriers, F1 blobs, frigate and inty roams, blops and bombing, generally broke but surviving on minimal PVP, what’s left to do in Eve now they banned isk poker? 
---
&gt;But while being webbed you can allways bail the fight. So fighting carriers is fine
---
My main gripe with carriers is that they've completely invalidated battleships as a hull class. They apply better, have more tank, more range and more utility than BS, and after insurance, the cost difference is negligible for a ship that just does all the same things but better.
---
Supers should be anti capital and anti structure platforms. I think that Dromis and sirens make them too good at dealing with ships that should be below their engagement profile.
---
I would honestly prefer that support fighters were removed altogether. If I want to apply to smaller ships, I should have to sacrifice mids to tackle them like any other ship, or have another ships tackle the target for me.
---
WTF is an official deployment?
---
Pretty much since November, I've been logging out there, my death clone has been there, most of our fleets form from there.

origins of russian krab (noun) or krabit' (verb) can be: 1) crab/krab stands for crayfish (or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustacean), and it's used to refer bad players in online games (because they have claws instead of hands and thus play bad) 2) at some point putin said 'work hard as slaves on galleys', in russian 'as slaves' is pronounced 'kak rab' and people reworked it into 'krab' or 'kak krab' pretty fast, usually means working hard (or pretty often referring to working hard in a joking/ridiculing way)

So I suppose if you want hard proof of the origins you might start in Russian circles.

Don't forget about PANIC, it makes rorqs under super umbrellas invulnerable to the only reasonable way to kill big shit under it: dreadbombs. It prob wouldn't be worth doing it to one rorq but nowadays in a belt you can find them in the double digits, I reckon you'd be able to down a couple at least before the faxes became overwhelming.
---
I'm still trying to adjust to the lack of an updated clone. I keep feeling like if something bad happens, I'll lose a whole lot of training. Yet I cannot seem to find anything related to keeping a clone ready, up to date, etc. It's a spooky feeling to feel like it'll be ok if something happens, but not being sure that it will be ok if something happens.

---
it got canned
---
Eve's API doesn't use HIBP. 
---
However, when you log into an Eve system (The game, the websites. Anywhere you use your eve username/password) Eve's servers use the HIBP API to determine if your password has shown up in a password dump. If it has, it warns you, so you can change it. 
---
This doesn't happen with remembered passwords in the launcher, as that doesn't store your password. it uses a specially generated token. 
---
Eve's systems don't store your password, so they can't check it at any other time. They store what's known as a hash of your password. It's what you get when you run the password through a series of mathematical operations, which throw away data as they go, so it's impossible to reverse it, but you'll always get the same result. 
---
What they can do, is check that your password is right (by hashing what you give them, and comparing that) then use the HIBP api to see if it's in any of the dumps
---
(The HIBP api never gets your password. They get a fragment of a hash and return every hash that matches that fragment. The hash can then be compared at eve's server side)
---
(I've simplified the explanation. It's in line with industry best practices)
---
Sometimes if I'm feeling spicy I use f2
---
to be fair even if the profit was 0 i'd still do it, more alpha accs means effectively another f1 in fleet or more eyes. It scales far too well to even need to make a profit in itself.
---
The original version did but there still devving it
---
TEST now holds the record for quickest campaign defeat while goons still hold the record for fastest empire loss (world war bee). I hope you continue to try to outdo each other.

Verify the game files from the launcher. Verifying files from steam only verifies the launcher files. In the launcher, in the top right corner where the buttons to close and minimize the launcher are, there's a small 'E' icon. Click that and select `Shared Cache...` and hit `Verify`.

Lol, I was just re-reading the article on the Fall of Fort Knocks in Rage. I wonder if it's also a slight allusion to Mr Krabs, in terms of the stubborn greed he exhibited.

yes its not the highsec miners breaking the economy, so?
---
&gt; SP farm are better than PI and just as afk.
---
don't forget that sp farms can also do PI at the same time, and afk ratting, and anything else really.
---
I fail to get the point you're trying to make, yes it's the people with a lot of capital that are breaking the economy, doesn't change the fact that sp farming is utterly broken.

It kind of made sense when T3Cs were OP - high risk, high power. (Though that doesn't seem to apply to capital or supercapital pilots ...) But when T3Cs got nerfed so they are of a similar level to T2 cruisers, it should have gone away.

It really doesn't make sense that a Tengu costs an extra 500 mil or whatever it costs to inject a subsystem back up to V.

You basically can't do anything apart from taking some near-unwanted space from renters (and even then, if they're renting off someone big, you'll probably get killed).

This should be an indication to everyone that we need nerfs to power projection, multibox ratting and mining and the ability for the big boys to hit you anywhere in the cluster easily.

I'm on like my forth month of omega, and I honestly cant see how most new people dont just say FUCK IT and leave the game.  Old bros like this who cant fly unless theyre OP really make the game unplayable at times.
---
Because here is sorta the thing, there is a limited supply of players. 
---
Unlike back in the day, there isn't a massive influx, so you have to appeal to the existing player base. 
---
Doing the same thing as GSF with less people well leaders to the obvious question why join you, when i could join the group with more supers. 
---
So in order to attract the players you need you need to be different enough to appeal to players over the safest option, but given the balance is currently so heavily in favor of the GSF playstyle being different isn't a option.
---
Like realistically why would anybody sane join Test over GSF, pure economics are not gonna do it, culture isn't gonna do it (because it's not as much a factor anymore ).
---
Because honestly what is the difference between Test and GSF at this point ? 
---
Now keep in mind with both Test and GSF appealing to the mining player base it also means that even people with a GSF hate boner are likely to well not be in your corporation so there really are not that many people left, plus do you really think doing the same thing with less people will result in a win ? look at GOTG they tried and failed.
---
Hi, man! Finally another introvert here. If you are going to war against my fellow brethren \^\^, then look here: [Nephilim, for example](http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=24126).
---
Its kinetic resistance is 10% more than explosive one. If your ONI deals much more kinetic damage than explosive, then it might be a thing. 
---
To this end I might say that putting a hard limit on the number of available slots for citadels in a given region / constellation might provide a bit more meaning to the structures. Likewise a limit on the number of citadels an alliance can deploy might be an interesting thing.   
---
I have toyed with the idea of holding space having an effect on capital projection and the state of being completely safe in transit is a problem for waging strategic warfare. Something like requiring temporary infrastructure other than cyno, to allow cyno capable to move aggressively in non-alliance controlled space could offer a theater for small gangs to get it on about. This in addition to some more relaxed movement inside alliance-sov-controled space would offer what I think might be an interesting compromise and flexible intrigue to the lines of battle.  
---
I guess it would be a lot like a psudo static deployable relay beacon with a light year range that could extend outside the particular alliances sov. that would then allow a hot drop at a cyno location in range. Chains of these in place would allow for a full range jump from a capital but any one being disrupted or taken along the chain would prevent that drop.
---
Was about to rant about rigs but you nailed it 
---
The spin is real :D
---
You take that back, just imagine if we brought our super fleet up north!!!1!
---
Then they’ll see what it means to have NCPL have their shit kicked in
---
you're obviously retarded, sorry. 
---
I thought they were a high skilled casual nullsec alliance.
---
So goonpets confirmed then?
---
About 75-100dps more, I believe. So considerably more. Thanks!
---
Err...
---
I think that must've been right before my time. I was an 08 toon, mining in a I sorry and (lol!!) Badger Mk II! I was a dumbass who thought I was clever!
---
Well done. 10/10
---
dude are you ok
---
please tell me you're going to be ok
---
They’re really EVE stories. I’m trying to do one myself.
---
500k for Carriers, Dreads, RORQs, FAXs, Freighters
---
1M for Supers
---
If you use a data analyzer and have the wreck there is a chance to recover skill injectors.
---
Must use a script to remap all keys to F1
---
12 years a slob
---
also the unreal taperium downvote salt, guy makes a video about a 12 year old alliance and you're all mashing the downboats because progod fed too much and valkorsia allowed his rectum to post on reddit for him
---
sad bois 
---
&gt;but you never destroy Outlaws
---
...aaand they are closing down their alliance (announcement made approx 2 hours ago). 
---
Well, THAT was fast. 
---
Too far
---
DID THIS EXACTLY with a little baggy of what i though were chocolates, it defiantly shot out..... made bitter beer face
---
HAHA you fools believe you've won the day? TAPI has the most battle hardened super fleet eve has ever seen! We could have easily defeated you without goons but we decided to be gracious hosts in new eden and spread the content around.
---
You really want to focus on the relevant skills, but luckily you can now see what those are to focus on them.
---
And then learn how to effectively PvP. Which is not easy.
---
And nodding appreciatively when it gets blown up, because it will.
---
Giving it to supers and titans might make them less of a go-to-for-everything, but with the economy the way it is I doubt many will feel the cost unless it's quite severe. That being said titan 5 is a long fucking train so I dunno if removing the full skill would be very fair.
---
Normal capitals though, they should be exempt from it.
---
Legit.  Now add the hotkey to shitpost on r/eve and it would be perfect.
---
Dude, keep your shitty presumptions for yourself will you ? 
---
nobody owes you a fair fight broseph, instead you've just got to engineer your own unfair fights 
---
Not sure if it helps but my debit card worked just fine. If you have no card what so ever that is a different matter.
---
I'm not sure there's a big problem with most of them, though the number of Leshaks does imply they are a bit strong as well. But the Kiki is definitely OP, largely because it's impossible to out-track it which is supposed to be the mitigation for ranged weapons (e.g. rails/artillery), but also because only having one weapon means the fitting space is effectively hugely more than on other destroyers.
---
Did I ever say it was 0%?
---
You just assume it's 0%. Let me tell you something. Like Steadyo said in the talking on stations interview, horde has a shitton of theory and experince in the high-sec cancer war. Why do you think it's a 0% market? 
---
It's a 0.1% market, which equals a shitton of isk when you control almost all the plex, injector and extractor market.
---
Take my upvote
---
Getting trolled by Ctrl+V
---
I always got my prop-mod on F1...
---
TIL losing a few hundred dreads ain't all that serious
---
I don't really care about the AT - it's completely irrelevant to the actual game.  Not that I don't appreciate the skill that goes into training and winning, but the process has nothing to do with the real world, where N+1 will almost always win. 
---
What would be the point of them if they couldn’t kill subcaps? Why would you deploy a dread or carrier in the first place, when it would be useless except against enemy capitals, which also wouldn’t be used 
---
Yes.  Everyone knows the epitome of Eve is aligning and mashing F1 when told by some nerd. 
---
You're presuming the Horde wallet are paying for those structures
---
Do you like the part where they want to remove the rewards lmao
---
Stealing this plan
---
Well. Are you actually me in disguise? I do almost the same
---
Combat ships:
---
Prop F1, Web/ewar F2, Tackle mod F3, Guns F4, Reps F5 (and F6 if multiple reps)
---
On covops I put the cloak on F5 and the hacking stuff (cargo scanner, analysers) on F2-4.
---
Goons are scary yo
---
Where I live we have our own mining-permits( cost one cat-pic linked in local per day)  and I ve paid em. So my drones should be fine...
---
I would second the above comment.  If you have played for a week or two it is probably time to stretch your legs.  While I don't recommend Mega-alliances/coalitions at the start, now may be the best time to make the move.  If you are able to get on VC and are in the USTZ, look me up and I will help you figure some more stuff out......
---
damage cap isn't going anywhere, it's a fundamental mechanic of upwell structures. but it could do with being a lot lower. certainly it wouldn't be the worst idea to have lower caps on shield and structure timers
---
I'm taking notes.
---
If there's anything at all I've learned from EVE,  it's that history revision is common and that deleted posts is a good way there.
---
So yeah, I guess so. 
---
Of course not, those special ships are the whole reason to fly the tourney. 
---
It's not about loosing drones but time drones need to come back to drop off what they mined 
---
;)
---
I wonder if any of them will dare to leave high sec.
---
If there's anything at all I've learned from EVE, it's that history revision is common and that deleted posts is a good way there.
---
So yeah, I guess so.
---
Let’s have an eve Durham/Raleigh meet and see who gets more people make it a friendly competition between the sides of the state. 
---
Are you sure you posted in the correct sub?
---
Do we get our own razor commercial or what?
---
And the reply to the main points made?
---
Haha I do it quite often 
---
Don't need hotkeys when you're a filthy module clicker.
---
On one hand, it was a hell of a feed
---
On the other hand, honestly dropping that many dreads should kill SOME supers (even if everyone but PGL knew it wouldn't)
---
DELETE FAX
---
sry i ganked them earlier
---
while i agree with the spirit of your post i think the text of your post is dumb and wrong
---
it's copypasta
---
So, is this a contest to see who can put their skillfarm alts in mining ventures and run around killing them the fastest?
---
The best part was tricking a guy into eating a shitload of them. I went with a youth group when we we were all about 14, sorta an exchange program type deal where one year we'd go over there then they'd come over here the next year and so on.
---
So the family me and 2 other guys were staying with gave us a big fuck-off pile of swedish treats when we arrived and we quickly learned that the Scandinavian palate is pretty uhhh.. Unique. The salted liquorice was the top dog of horrible shit tho so the next day we're doing a tour of the city and we're fucking with another friend showing off our amazing collection of sweets and shit.
---
He takes the bait hard. Sneaks up and grabs a big massive handful of the demon liquorice and runs off triumphantly laughing, gleefully taunting us with the "stolen" sweets. Proceeds to doublefist the whole lot into his mouth, before collapsing to the ground hacking and coughing and spitting shit everywhere. One of the funniest most awful things I've ever seen in my life. We still laugh about it when we see each other to this day.
---
Depends on what you view as a deployment - we've had mandatory jump clones in Oijanen since early November, both for the armor cap/super fleet staged there as well as for several subcap doctrines.
---
The vast majority of our content was happening in the North (Oijanen/Perimeter) from that point on - we've had maybe half a dozen non-Rorqual related southern pings per month since then.
---
Deathclones were however moved North only a week ago.
---
10/10 flairbait
---
Unique flexability comes with unique cost.
---
I mean I still dislike titans. You've not really made points, just pointed out facts I was already aware of.
---
I use qwertasdfgzxcvb for hotkeys
---
&gt;Are you suggesting it doesn't count until PGL waves some magic fucking wand 
---
Nope. But it was kinda funny watching the series of "BIG CAMPAGIN START NOW OK" posts from PGL. 
---
CCP Nanny got sick of then crying about a skinned knee and turned the sandbox into a padded playpen, complete with hello kitty wallpaper/skins. 
---
I've never really understood the point of keeping heads in refrigerators. They become useless. I mean, even the mouth becomes cold and dry. No, skulls are where its at because you can make all kinds of things from them. Ashtrays, cups, a shrine to Sithis, etc.
---
As a proud member of Goryn I fully support this gift.
---
“1 alliance”
---
casually forgetting goons created most of the timers that are being fought over this week
---
What did you want him to say? It is what it is. You win some you loose some. You havent been playing EVE long enough if you havent seen both sides of the coin.
---
Stupid people stopped playing and smart players learned.
---
That and that shit FC Steadyo
---
Armor super fleet is a bit of a overstatement. It's tiny
---
It's funny because PGL has been posting "Ok guys now we are gonna do this for real" and then right after TEST comes out and says "jk we prob need help, but we won anyways because we killed horde's income (which you didn't!))
---
In the end though, it's all good fun, more content is healthy for both sides. Keep 'em coming
---
This bro joined our Corp with another group of kool bros from a alliance that died. When his old CEO pulled the trigger for them all to join, RTF just took them all in. At first this homie was clearly a newbro. That twinkle in his eye that most us have lost years ago to the countless wars, shit post,  drama and general community that can be eve from year to year. But over the past 2 weeks he has become that spark of renewed love and excitement for us. Even renamed FC to "Leader person" from one of his pictures. Was funny but now I can't live it down sadly. 
---
Forget for a moment the drama of "your with XXX, so your trash. We in XXX are the beat" chest beating sounds. This is the real blood of eve. A new player that can spark a new found love for eve. I wish each Corp could have 100 people with his love for the game. 
---
As for the isk  he asked me the beast way to use it, so we going to get him a few skill injectors. Going to help get him a few key 5s and help him into a t2 logi. He wanted to be able to be a better asset to a fleet and is enjoying logi so. 
---
Talk to gigx, lose your hands, have other FC's do it for you
---
Yeah, I think this is an EXTREMELY important point. Pilots are a resource, but FCs are a much scarcer and equally important one. Though there's experienced FCs that bounce around the game, any serious null organization will have to grow their own. 
---
Small time producers live in highsec in countless numbers. Rorquals swarm nullsec and dwarf subcap mining to really low levels. 
---
In the current meta the setup cost/reward of mining is very low except on nullsec moons. 
---
Now it means two things:
---
Either youre pragmatic and youll soon have calculated that the vni in null earns more than a hulk with 1/3 of the cost and youll wait for your rorq.
---
Or youre attracted like many others to the style and the real question will be whether you want to stay casual or you want to get deep into the game and make your own story. 
---
Personnally i dont see any issues with you choosing the quiet life. 
---
:) 
---
look its that guy from last years summer
---
RMT
---
Oh and dont worry. Most groups will be happy to have you if you can come to fleets. 
---
what you just described is a Baltec fleet, son.... see post below
---
Yesssssssssss
---
*Laughs in Scandinavian*
---
You guys are all weak!
---
That's because Triglavian ships are premium ships.
---
  &gt; only t1 ships that can't be flown by alpha
---
  &gt; completely new ship line introduced after push for micro transactions
---
  &gt; OP in many situations
---
  &gt; Triglavian modified modules are potentially the best in the game
---
shut up im vg
---
You cant really use autopilot anymore when you have FOB rats camping gates.
---
Is this the moment we see PL invade Test? Only time will tell.
---
So after some discussion, there appears to be some patterns outside of the established norms. The main one I'm seeing is F1 for prop mod, and the use of the QWERTY and ASDF keys. The thing is for me, I still use those for navigating shortcuts ("A" to align, "S" to warp to, "D" to dock/interact). But anyway yeah, it's kinda interesting to see what everyone does.
---
You signed your post, GJ
---
As much as I love both chocolate and salt licorice then I don't think it should be mixed. That shit doesn't belong together. 
---
That's because you're banned from the AT. Lol wew !
---
I love and hate that leader person one 
---
I wish that there was a bit of a compromise. Maybe some sort of limit/penalty per skill category instead of overall skill point total? I totally agree that the first 6 months to a year of this game can be rough when you are wanting to not only get basic skills to survive PVP engagements, but also explore the other things the game has to offer. Some people will say that the solution is "more alts dummy" but I can only handle a few accounts before I consider it wasting my money. And I'd rather spend the ISK i make in game on ships than plexing more accounts. 
---
Stop mining in high. Start hunting relic and data sites in low, null and wh space. Failing that see if there are incursion groups that'll take new players. Start scamming in jita.
---
Those all make more fun isk
---
You lost your highsec markets and rental empire. Your MER is below Stain region. Where else is isk coming from?
---
Providence Faction Forts ring a bell?
---
I can feel ur pain. The vault is bad.
---
On a serious note ... the vault should let u put in/take out like 1500 plexes / day. It wont affect normal player but will force traders to haul the plexes.
---
&gt;Controlling the high-sec market is a lot more difficult than what TEST leadership makes it seem.
---
TEST certainly did take a big 'old chunk of ICY's market share, but it's very hard to say exactly how much since the income is all OpSec.   
---
TEST has been winning most of the fights over the off-shore markets, but the ICY guy appears to having fun dropping market after market, and as long as Horde can form a fleet for it, TEST will need to stay serious about form-ups. We'll see which side gets tired of it first. 
---
Darwin law
---
You paid money for a Razer?  Can get an IKBC MF108 V.2 on Amazon right now for like $170. It's 5 pounds of aluminum chassis with double shot PBT keycaps and Cherry MX Blues/Reds/Browns/Silents.
---
Mikal I had asked about it in the BL discord since I can attend this one. Plz come back.
---
Not really: [https://zkillboard.com/kill/74634046/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/74634046/)
---
Camel Empire Secret Santa!
---
No but my IKBC MF108 with cherry blues and pudding keycaps -is- superior. Cost less too.
---
Right into the penis
---
I'm not saying all of them but enough to justify his poem.
---
We love newbros, so people like myself who have the extra isk enjoy the reaction when we drop 3-4-8-10bill in their wallets.
---
1. They can enjoy the game without it becoming a job, being able to buy ships
---
2. They tend to stay in the game, rather than quitting due to lack of money and ability to buy that awesome cruiser they’ve been eyeing.
---
I'm not sure what your point is, but I'm good with what Vily wrote.  We had a lot more success up north as more of a JC deployment, and trying to make it anything else without moving supers was always going to be challenging at best.  I'm just glad we're not going to keep feeding dreads to try and make a point.
---
However, to suggest that the entire deployment was (1) only a week and (2) a complete failure just isn't based in reality.  We've been up there in some fashion since November, and we acheived a lot of what we sat out to do. 
---
Also, we're not going anywhere yet.
---
I guess my point is that people seem to have read what they want to hear out of Vilys post.  I think it was pretty honest, and without a ton of spin, and there was a lot of good to come out of this deployment.
---
Only thing I took out of this was the admittance that they can't do much without goons
---
tbf a lot of major projects have had to go back to stage 1 in a somewhat late stage of development and still released decently without much delay.
---
But something tells me CCP isn't capable of pulling that off so I'm considering it shitcanned.
---
It's not 0% though. It's a series of different structures, all with slightly different tax values, all fairly low (certainly low enough to make them more attractive than Jita). I wouldn't be surprised if they cycled the tax values in order to make more in taxes. Pretty clever if they did, actually.
---
well, compared to what happened in the autumn/winter this is laughable at best
---
I was just thinking "ya'll muthafuckas need vector art."
---
That's pretty neat. I didn't realize CCP had that functionality in place.
---
I think BL is blue to PH
---
they were blosping with BL against Gotg
---
He should really make the logi on an alt account.
---
Good argument! I take it you're secretly without an opinion and don't really use T3C, hehe.
---
Ok, so we've seen how much Test is making off Perimeter.  It's a lot.
---
So if you're suggesting Horde still makes more, and in fact was making all that Isk for 18 months or whatever, where the fuck did it go?
---
I log in to PH top get in some small gang fights, gate camps, and the occasional stratop.  I dont enjoy those last ones due to tidi and all, but I like being a part of it all.  ALso enjoy playing the market from all the loot I grab
---
So when I launch the game trough steam, it launches the eve launcher and I then log in with a user/pass... is that not the same?
---
He has started 2 alpha account to start them skilling the basics to all 3.  
---
better yet just remove citadels 
---
Also, remove insurance.
---
My opinion is that it's a shit idea.
---
Now paying at least part if the asset safety fees to the dudes who killed the citadel, I can get behind that.
---
Reports this week of explosions on the side of a large battle between Legacy coalition and a relatively unknown opponent have been revealed to be not the destruction of Legacy capitals; as has been widely reported by less scrupulous media sources, but of the spontaneous explosion of a weather probe in a local gas cloud reflecting off the atmosphere of a nearby planet.
---
Hey Doom, long time! How's that southern invasion working out for ya?

Yay, this bullshit again.

Read the replies.

I'll agree that supers *should* have died, but uh... yeah pretty much everyone realized they weren't going to before the second wave was even called in and they went in anyways.

this would actually be a fun idea.  bit like a pinyata.   kill the citadel, get a surprise payment later.  bit like a ransom.

But... We have clones?

Jump to your toothless, strung out, wrinkly, nasty clone. Inject your brains out. Then jump back to your sexy superstar body.

I don't fly Rorqs but I've been told they can have some serious DPS. Apparently not enough for that one rat?
---
As someone who had to muddle through corp management on a daily basis, I can definitely tell you that alone would definitely have brought me back. That UI is one of the most frustrating and unintuitive pieces of shit in the game, and it is not granular enough at all to be useful.

dunked and mad about it

God I love dinoposters

It's not a big deal

If it is a big deal, yours was worse **&lt;--- you are here**

If it is our fault, lol gf we had fun no one is mad about this of course! 
---
This is amazing welcome to goonswarm and see you around in fleets!

I feel kinda bad for TAPI. I mean sure it's fun to fight with them against panfam, but I really think it's hurting them in the long run to be so, well dependent on us for deployments.

Must not have been around during the "make sure your clone is up to date" days.
---
Name your corp The Angel Cartel.
---
Move to Curse.
---
Point new player recruits to npc faction killboard 100% kill rate. 
---
Set tax to highest possible rate.    
---
Use experienced players to gangmaster new players into running round the clock LP missions with discounted corp buy back.
---
Recruit more carebear slaves to acquire more LP.
---
Offer all merc and pirate gangs a constant supply of shiny angel hardware at massive discount in return for super+cap fleet support and experienced sov taking management.
---
Use Slave force income to build out logistics and build a capital cache.
---
Start to recruit more experienced players with offer of full SRP on bling macheriel fleets.
---
Quell minion rebellion with dramiel fleet rewards or a reminder The Angel Cartel has access to unique Jove resources and can hunt and kill dissent with impunity. Point at corp law. Make an exhale of ringleaders dumping them in a Angel L5 room and convince them you have control over the fleet.
---
Operate an oppressive regime of constant brainwashing that their work is helping maintain the Cartels grip on New Eden and resistance is futile. 
---
Spread disinformation that you’ve paid PL to hack the servers and can now control the entire Angel NPC fleet.
---
Have cloaked campers sit in target sov spamming local constantly with obscure encrypted text with question marks and names to breed maximum psychological panic in carebears. 
---
Bribe target members to leave with offers of shiny angel things.
---
Oppress enemy fleets constantly with max speed dramiels flying around with no apparent purpose. 
---
Keep it up until they move back to hisec just to escape the relentless and pointless activity.
---
Continue to operate slave labour camps filling your personal coffers with isk until someone’s parents call the FBI. Resign as CEO. Pull all your skills and claim on reddit it was clearly all the work of rogue NPC agent code trapping players in a perpetual series of missions. Enjoy life as a space gorillionaire with the infamy that you managed to use deception and psychological warfare to persuade countless people to do your bidding....     
---
Never work though. People are lazy as fuck and after the bonus room sleep deprivation and ipcress file type sound/light torture is probably a breach of the EULA, UN Human Righys and sundry local laws.
---
That's not the ARC I know. And this incident didn't involve anyone from ARC afaik. 
---
Rough addition to this.
---
Goons now have separate shield and armor supercapital/titan fleets. That force can project around 30-40% of nullsec depending on which bloc fc’s are active.
---
The Delve Time Unit was invented to properly enhance the “already replaced” meme.
---
Citadels happened.
---
Moon mining changed.
---
Rorquals changed.
---
PL attempted to roll Providence. Test rolled PL and took all of Provi’s stations that got turned into faction fortizars. 
---
Wormholers + ex-Pizza + Tri folk rolled drones with supers. Tri and exPizza stopped being friends. 
---
Frat tried to roll test. Tri backed up Frat. PL deployed in force to get revenge for TEST humiliating them in Providence. TEST ended up dunking them with some minor assistance from friends.
---
PL went inactive for a while.
---
Test is the dominant power projector in the south east. 
---
Goons slammed the northwest for a few months in tandem with the Frat/winterco vs Test/legacy war. Forced a few keepstar kills and hometeam super welps.  GOTG bribed them to leave deklein
---
BL 3.0 happened. 
---
Horde and BL invaded branch “for content” to try and finish off Dorkness. Friends and Sort D. They failed.
---
Elo quit(idk if it was a meme or not). BL 3.0 got robbed. 
---
BL 3.0 status = 
---
I’m in PH, we’re resetting them

We’ll be bluetral like snuff and goons. They’ll help us with big picture stuff, but they’ll be able to shoot our dudes and stuff outside of that

Old but gold
---
Don't make is your main concern,  that's foolish 
---
We do not only have the Perimeter market to lose in this, but also a reputation of being the most autistic entity in the game. If that isnt all the motivation needed, idk what is.
---
You know what this will lead to?      
---
Big groups circling around clearing all structures and taking all the stuff.       
---
Do you remember those dead keepstars in the north?

You will still find supers and titans on contracts in lowsec pickup stations.                
---
reeeeeee graphs y-axis don't start at 0!
---
yeah so? i'm saying that even how it went down, I wouldn't post it to reddit lol
---
All rats don't show up on kills, just the last rat. A fleet of these rats spawn when you gank their NPC mining fleet. They hit pretty hard and point.

Interesting way of saying that

Yeah, the more alts mentality has always frustrated me. I in fact refuse to even have an alt. But I have known individuals that maintained 100 man skill farms until the market balanced. Literally printing isk. It's another thing that is wrong with the game that I didn't touch on, the holding of alts while lucrative to CCP is inherently not a good indicator for game health, because a second person is always better at whatever role you would have an alt do. It's an expression of a lack of player base, or lack of interest to assign a non body to a task that would otherwise be filled by a player. Likewise I have known many to simply boot up eve to "afk VNI, while I play other games" and the sentiment while widely embraced and undeniably effective at generating revenue, is terrifying in it's implications.

Wich alliance are you talking about? 
---
Some people are proud and do not accept gifts. Still a balance between isk making and cheap PvP fits is doable. 
---
The good organizations will surely throw free, basic ships at you.
---
T1 cruisers are a great way to find solo fights. As with any ship you'll risk being hot dropped or ganged up on, but I find that in a T1 cruiser I have more people willing to shoot me without calling in the whole Alliance. For the moa I typically go with an XLASB with duel webs and full DPS fit. 
---
I say this becuase all I have seen from either side is: Deathclones are up in the north now, let's go. Then it was 'whoops we don't start until next weekend' or something similar to that.
---
After whelping cap fleets not only one time, but twice, we get this statement. It's also fun to read that you guys are going to work with dudes from now on. As if this was a deployment from the indepentent TEST that had a certain guy say they would have an advantage in the north. As they didn't have to coordinate with others, but their enemies had to.
---
Gotta beat the insurance deadline 
---
Forgot about all rats not showing on kills. Thank you. Makes sense now.
---
Making isk to fund cheap PvP is alright,  but if it's you're goal you'll most likely burn out.  Especially seeing how other people are doing comparatively. All I'm saying 
---
do people actually believe in the Jita scams ?
---
yay dude, everything is fine
---
His not in PL any more , headliner kicked him for spending all corp isk on reimbursement.               
---
So he formed a new corp and now is doing it from the isk that he pulled from PL renting alliance wallet.            
---
Just send email with the lose to him and he will give isk for a new ship.  
---
#Austrian Corp?

Titans aren't 100b anymore lol, only if you're a dumbass who tarts it up with purple mods

I've said it before, and I'll say it again:

Two major EVE alliances are fighting a serious war over sales-tax revenue.

EVE is a weird game.

Regardless of the motivation, I welcome the opportunity to shoot/be-shot-by you.

Why does anyone use pepe emojis in the year 2019?
---
I use 1-5 and drag all my active mods into those slots. Usually 1 for mwd, 2 for point, 3-5 for ewar/weapons. 
---
I just click stuff that doesn't have to be toggled much (invulns, command bursts, etc)
---
This also makes rolling your head across the keyboard a viable method of playing the game!

Eve players are french fries, confirmed?
---
I understand your paranoia, but don't let that hinder your recruitment progress. I mean if someone really wanted to spy on your wh, there is not much you can really do. They don't even have to be in your corp. Just cloaked up on a ping near your structure lol. 
---
I found my first wh corp threw the recruitment channel.. and it was the best Eve experience I have had to date. Anyway, good luck.
---
I for one don't believe this post.
---
The refrigerator is not a valid long term solution for meat preservation, obviously fake!

CODE taught them better.

so this was the reason OSY-UD got invaded?
---
First comment too lol
---
Anybody who's actively playing will no doubt evac anything worth anything from a citadel that may be about to die. There's plenty of time for that, and with Jump Freighters and such available in null/low, it's pretty easy.
---
Mostly Asset Safety is necessary for those players that are away from the game, so they don't come back to find all their stuff has vanished in their absence. - With the outposts deleted from the game, there's no other place to put stuff without moving it up to low-sec, high-sec or NPC null.
---
&gt; I think removing asset safety will create tons of more content in nullsec and make the game way more interesting 
---
I don't really see how. Like I say, evacing is pretty easy and if asset safety were removed all it would do is make people more conscientious about making sure their valuables have been moved. - They wouldn't have to save the citadel to protect their assets, so there's no more incentive there then there is now to defend.
---
&gt; supers are the worst problem in eve.
---
Definitely not what I said. Eve has accumulated a lot of cancers over time. Which one is worst is another question entirely.
---
Because you are a leader, and a giant muffin.
---
\+1 Schneckt
---
that was 2-3 weeks i think
---
Sure sure. But what's the average accounts per player these days? I don't think you can truly say Eve is just stagnant and not dying by looking at accounts on without also knowing players behind those accounts.
---
You know what happens? Wealthy players just inject up 2, or 3 or however many Titan alts. Once you max one there is nothing left to train so you just add a second to next slot, then third. 3 Titan pilots on one omega sub, however long you set it to that’s how many alts you are going to have to keep constant coverage. 
---
Yep. Try it yourself eventually you’ll get somebody. 
---
Probably the best way to get into nullsec is by going from lowsec into Stain, from what I've heard. The only problem is that the gate seems to be missing.
---
Interesting chart. I find the most interesting year to be 2018 for its extreme flatness. You know, as in, no change with the weather. Doesn't seem to follow human expectation. One could almost say the steadiness is robotic....
---
(Yes, I realize this could be effects from influx of human Chinese players. Would be interesting to compare the same charts for Serenity with these)

---
Thing is, we aren't really ahead by that much compared to the north. Hell, they don't even need to be ahead, they just need to log in and protect krabs. Why they don't do that? Lazy, I think.
---
his killboard is pure gold too

Do you have the exact data on the steep incline/decline at the open/close of servers? That would really give the closest insight into how prevalent the bot issue really is.

So those Titans were paid for by alliance?

---
My opin, and please no disrespect.  I think your alliance may not have enough to hold decent sov,..yet.  If it was me, I'd blue up with some larger entities, then rent some Sov under a Major alliance cap umbrella and work out a mutual bat-phone.  Utilize rental space hard, keep standing fleets, indexes up etc, mega-krabbing, indy, mining, missions all that stuff as best that you can do... to get income to build resources and infrastruture.  Have your PvP corps set jump clones to some NPC Null and maintain a strong presense (and get experience &amp; content ftw ) in a target sov area.  Cloaky camp the buffer space around as best as you can as a force multiplier and for intel. Autistic-tosis and drop cheap citadels incessently (expect to lose them) from NPC null to those pockets, and do this until you create enough angst to make the owner "have to" make a decision.  Either defending the given pocket as a contant chore, or release it.  Hopefully, you'll want it more than the current owner and then they negotiate/sell/transfers/dumps it as not being worth and you get the sov free and clear.  I'd maintain the rental space to fall back to.  
---
Target selection,... a low traffic, under-utilized (defendable) pocket to enhance the "not worth it" thing to the current owner.   There seems to be space like this around and before going for it, I'd ask what they'd negotiate.  In any case, once I have sov for my aliance to start improving their lot, I'd start looking to expand into some more valuable sov with a hopefully growing and bigger fleet and making things better once again, rinse, repeat.    
---
I saw someone on another comment mention FC experience, I'd like to add that it's a must for more than just PvP/defense fleets to protect your friends, corp assets and morale. Just my two-sense.
---
If you really want a good laugh, hang out on r/mechanicalkeyboards for a little while.  Speaking well of Razer, Corsair, or Logitech keyboards is tantamount to heresy there.  The denizens thereof look askance on RGB in general, and on any keycap set that you didn't have to wait several months to obtain on Massdrop is questionable.  My F1 key is quite literally titanium, and I dare not do much more than lurk there.
---
One at a time works well for me.

It arose organically from fleet chat sperg. You were in strat-op mode and it was an attempt to lighten the mood a little.
---
I meant super as in supercapitals, which I include Titans in for obvious reasons.

It's about the pretty explosions, both in game, and in the salt afterwards.

Please just stop posting.

Where is the "align" key and the "don't bump the fucking titan" key?
---
Haven't you heard? The community and the people driving it(chosen by the community) give 0 fucks about content or relevance anymore.
---
Haven't you seen this sub? Full of garbage not even related to eve, storytelling with one Eve word in it constitutes "related content" now, and shitposting is regarded as the pinnacle of "helpful" on this subreddit. 
---
Games going down the drain and so is the community. 
---
A "spam local" macro too.

I'm really not, just stating a point

Next Saturday 
---
Any chance you can use your super powers for good and estimate the ratio of omega/alpha pilots? Estimate percentage of bots?
---
Mistakes were made. I don't know what to tell you.
---
That doesn't change the fact that (1) a large majority of us have had death clones up North since November, and (2), we acheived a lot of what we set out to do.
---
Now did we want to feed a bunch of dreads? No, of course not, but that's a lot bigger win for Horde then it is a loss for us, and wasn't entirely unexpected.
---
Also, no one believed for a second that we were going to go up north, to Hordes front door, next to all their friends, and need help at some point.  The intention might have been to try and limit that, but it was inevitable.
---
ITT: Trying to nerf goons.  If you nerf goons you nerf the game for all the small folk and will cause even greater "clumps" of folks sticking together because survival against the larger/largest powerblocks will require it.
---
No u
---
It hovered around 1.5 [for a decade](http://jestertrek.com/eve/pop-alts.png) so I think it's unlikely that it's changed very much. I agree it's probably gone up a bit, maybe as much as 10%. Not enough to significantly influence these charts.
---
Sup traitor!  Tell Elron I am fixing his garbage and turning it into something beautiful.

But they said they can win without you guys so that must be true right?

🤣LMAO GOTEEM🤣
---
they're wildly powerful in two situations - one is when you're fighting subcaps and want them to stop doing things in general, and two is when you're fighting a hostile super blob or dread bomb and want to neut out the faxes and or dreads
---
they're not wildly useful against small groups of ships mostly because the aiming interface is so stupidly hard to use even if you know what you're doing
---
but yeah the ecm burst and tp burst are largely pointless, and the web burst is only worth using on a vendetta
---
You're right. It probably also went into the fax and dreads horde also fielded. Thanks for the heads up
---
Jesus Christ I've only been saying this for half a decade
---
Still... PL got not a single Provi Citadel
---
Advanced Spaceship Command V too. Therefore you can't train up Capital Ships further until you retrain it huehuehuehuehue
---
Then they’ll come for blops, and t3’ds....

I guess I also need to get free dreads and faxes for my Horde alt.

okay two things one jeff is still around but he mostly just pings #games for people to play him at madden (don't, it's a trick)
---
two, i might suggest either odin's call (which is where grath is right now), or total mayhem, to get that old smallgang vibe back
---
pl and horde aren't really in a great spot for that kind of content right now

This is literally what happened yesterday.
---
Not even close. Jira is way more responsive.
---
I think he knows about that fight, as he was the horde subcap fc.
---
L8ke the kool-aide man
---
yeah, apparently the current theory  is that bumping the faxes over a period of time causes it. It is actually one of the reasons the heavy armour fights just arent worth the theorycrafting for any more.

uh... i started playing before you did fam, and an osprey was my first cruiser in january of '06 - i legit bought it for the mining bonus

tecnic1: &lt;ask question&gt;

someone else: &lt;give answer&gt;

tecnic1: wtf, no thats wrong i dismiss your answer without providing any evidence, give me an answer that fits my world view.
---
&gt; Thing is, we aren't really ahead by that much compared to the north.
---
You are, because you have the majority of toons like that numerical advantage is already a problem. 
---
But let's ignore that, how many people would stick around if all the pings where for defending rorqs how many would show up ? 
---
Because i suspect your massively over estimating that number, because most folks don't mine so why show up to save a miner ? 
---
&gt; Hell, they don't even need to be ahead, they just need to log in and protect krabs. Why they don't do that?
---
They drop supers, just not when it's GSF dropping them almost as if there aware getting in a super fight with GSF would be a colossally bad mistake, that would likely end there super fleet, or trade a super fleet now given your income and the Norths income even if they went all to mine like crazy they would not come out winning with such trades. 
---
&gt; you all need to unite and actually play the game, instead of coasting on your past achievements.
---
There is no you all there, i don't live up north. 
---
There is also the thing that the north drops on non-goon fleet's all the time, almost as if they are very much aware they dropping on a GSF fleet is colossally risky because 1 intel fuck up and well rip supers. 
---
Nor am I. It was a flippant comment. No intention to rain on your parade. 
---
&gt;Results released this week from a five year clinical study conducted by The National Institute Of Mental Health confirm more EVE Online players collect human heads in their refrigerators than all other MMORPG games combined.
---
Some how I don't think this surprises any one in the EVE community if it was to be true.
---
You could probably bridge that gap a little bit if they found a way to make marauders stronger and more useful. Right now there's no point in flying a marauder when a dread is a couple days more to train and exponentially better at everything(except high sec mission running of course)
---
Dude.
---
Does Horde give out free Titans?
---
That's all the evidence required.
---
Wasn’t the big war going on during the time when the other years had a dip? I imagine that would have got more people logging in. 
---
Good luck in your play for delve friend

not every1 got the patience and time to mine with gazzillion of rorquals everyday...if u bored and rich enough to welp 1 dred /week,go shoot citadels/.enemy caps
---
Imagine thinking the problem with the game is Loki fleets instead of n+1 super blobs 
---
lol. this is a meme bro
---
You act like incentives that aren't completely free stuff isn't a thing. I'm pretty sure TAPI does the exact same thing where they provide supercaps under cost.
---
Let's not forget 'Test alliance pleasing Imperium".
---
thats ccp problem...cunts milked the fuck out of stupids spending loads of dollars injecting in caps/ rorquals  and now they sitting spinning caps in keepstars cuz servers are shit anyway...or droping them on 3 frigs roamng the area.game is great

Hey now, this is entirely different!

[wiki.eveuniversity.org/Damage_types](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Damage_types)
---
I wasn't able to generate a visual diagram of what I was seeing. The closest I got was to use the analytics tools I have (and it's amazing how good some of the available analytics tools are now) to ask a question of my data. The question I eventually settled on was:
---
"What time, after downtime, to the closest hour, does the player count logged into EVE reach the average for that day?"
---
Then I plugged in the data for each year individually. Here's what was spat out:
---
2009: 1300
---
2010: 1500
---
2011: 1600
---
2012: 1500
---
2013: 1400
---
2014: 1500
---
2015: 1500
---
2016: 1400
---
2017: 1400
---
2018: 1300
---
What this means is, say the average for May 16, 2012 was 25883 (it was). The question is basically: what time should I expect the number of logged in players to reach 25883 that day? The answer for 2012 was 1500 EVE time. The average for October 15, 2018 was 21657. What time should I expect it to happen on that day? The answer for 2018 was 1300 EVE time.
---
That doesn't mean that time was exact for every day (in fact, the average hit 21657 for October 15, 2018 at 1323 EVE time). I just asked for the closest hour.
---
Now that doesn't necessarily 100% prove that there are a lot of bots out there. Again, it could be the big influx of Chinese players that play EVE around that time. Totally possible. But it struck me that the 2018 answer was the same as the 2009 answer, the same year that botting was last so prevalent in EVE.
---
Long answer to a short question, sorry. I do that. ;-)
---
Probably not free anything but alliance subsidies. 
---
I can't hear you with Nidias dick in your mouth
---
You're still missing several trillion ISK, even if they just handed out that entire fucking Titan fleet, which they didn't.
---
really op

did you really go through the effort to put the TM in the title

It was added about 6 months ago. Lot of people were not happy they had to click away that message every time they wanted to log in with their easy to memorize password...

I approve of this

Or just swap bodies every time you shoot up
---
What are you, a poor?
---
Elron made the group what it was.  I will make it better and we don't need wormholes to do it.  Elron still did something that is considered morally questionable.  Using "group was toxic" as an excuse is something a bad leader would say.
---
Needed to get to the comments to even understand what OP was trying to say.
---
How many times do we need to go over this:  Lose and loose are different words.  I'll use them in a sentence for you to help. 
---
You are an idiot with a loose grasp of the facts.  As a result, you are going to lose this argument.  Got it?
---
They're monthly right?  We should make a big push for nerds to come to the February one.  Then, among the new faces the regulars can try to guess which one of the retards is me. 
---
And it was 100% predictable.
---
Speculation, but it seems like CCP ignored the damage it was going to do to the game to bump up their revenue before selling the company.
---
My clones all chug Fedo cock on the Rens undock for isk.  They would be down with this plan.  
---
Very nice of you chaps.
---
Literally this very thread. 
---
What does any of that have to do with alpha clones?
---
&gt; Amarr titan level 4
---
Filthy casual
---
Test trickled in dreads at varying times and at different ranges losing the benefit of larger alpha damage
---
Short range dreads are useless at range.
---
And I bet DPS was was split because PGL was yelling over the target caller.
---
Fax are powerful currently however if you need them to make them irrelevant then dreads will become way too powerful for there costs.
---
i just threw up in my mouth a little
---
This is the TL;DR for anyone interested:  
---
You try to log in to Eve with your password *Hunter2*  
---
CCP uses an algorithm that can't (effectively) be reversed to turn your password into a [hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function), for this example *abcdefghijklm*  
---
CCP sends the first five characters of this hash (*abcde*) to to haveibeenpwned  
---
haveibeenpwned returns the hash of all pwned passwords where the hash starts with those five characters  
---
CCP compares your password's hash against all the hashes returned and kindly asks you to change your password if there's a match
---
Thats the highsec campaign my dude
---
Nope. The data isn't that granular. I have no way of knowing what people are doing when they're logged in (except for times when I've done goofy shit like [correlating logins with PvP kills](http://jestertrek.com/eve/players/archive/eve-combined-rolling18months.png) ). Only CCP has that data.
---
If you want to be next level and get your implant game on point.
---
I would train an industry alt through the brave newbies 120 day plan + Scanning skills &amp; Sabre skills. Shouldn’t be more than half a years training. Will come in handy YUGGGEE.
---
Also here are some pods I like to use. And what I’m training my alt to fly.
---
Vanilla pod: (the essentials)
---
If I’m going to a no win scenario or clubbing baby seals I like to use an a 10% warpspeed/ 3% evasive maneuvering pod and an Agency overclocker III
---
 But if it’s a fight i’d take a little seriously Id I’m in a nicer ship then I’d pod into something nice;
---
Snake pod: 
---
A mid grade snake pod with a 5% Evasive maneuvering in 7 and a zors custom slot 8 that gives a 5% to MWD speed bonus. Also add Quafe Zero to your Agency overclocker 3
---
Your scanning alt is in a Bifrost/Stork/Magus or saber/flycatcher your vanilla pod
---
Sabre if it’s a gank or nobodys got any, Comand dessy for MJD plays and links.
---
Or
---
Slave pod:
---
A mid grade slave set with a 5% armor bonus implant in slot 10 I think?
---
Alt is in an empty pod and a magus cause he prolly gonna die.
---
If you’re in a Marauder doing some Marauding Before you quit eve forever in a blaze if glory like a thug. High grade crystals / Asklepians with highgrade damage meme implants, your alt is in a nano Orthrus flying anti tackle in a vanilla pod and you’re both taking drugs like a couple of homeless junkies given the keys to the pharmacy. Just for the sake that all that is holy DON’T prematurely bastion. 
---
Or if you’re in a Bhagle high grade talismans cost 400m
---
great that you're enjoying it! 
---
Some are even just french 😮
---
But can it hold wine?
---
Even all racial drone specials to 3 doesn't hardly take any time at all, you should always have drones trained
---
No downsides to drones, just minor or major bonuses

2 years? Whew, not even sure I'll still be playing/care by then, but sure. Let's go with that.

I'm trying to fix my rep with the gallente faction however after doing 5 important missions for them my standing has only improved by 0.28 .  I'm training those skills and I'm running courier / combat missions but this grind is getting to me. I have no doubt that I'm doing something wrong here so any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!
---
That's what she said ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Honestly, I don't think even GOTG have ever had a "campaign" this short
---
That was so financially successful for CCP they will do another. 
---
atleast i get to suck a dick
---
What you have to do is boil the assfat from the body and then scrape off the top layer and coat the skull cup with that. Once it dries it will hold blood and or wine.

You're clearly jealous of my superior alliance and up vote count, you insolent fool .
---
We gonna ...  
---
**(⌐■\_■)**  
---
kill urself
---
I mean, if you play this game long enough, you get a pretty good idea of how much it cost to run an alliance.  All the information is out there if you connect the dots.
---
You can look at the MER, and knowing what tax rates are, you know how much tax is coming in, and you know how much mining is going on, the buyback rates for PI are common knowledge..
---
I can go on and on.
---
Well, now that we know how much Test is making in Perimeter, we can kinda make a rough estimate of how much Hordes cut was.
---
Whatever.  Don't trust me, do the research for yourself.   It's not hard to figure out how much Isk you should have sitting around.
---
I have 2 rorq pilots, one being a max industry pilot. More than likely going to spend a week or two mining, then sell off the excavators while keeping the hulls just in case id decide to mine again. Liquidate all the shit I don't need and send the ISK to my PVP alt, should be enough to keep me going for a while.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Other than skill training and the mining implants, I don't know fuck all about that stuff. Thanks for the suggestion and ill certainly be looking into some more, same with certain drugs
---
It's just failed leadership, pretty sad when they fail they take it out on line members instead of trying to make a change
---
What income do they think they destroyed lol? Ratting is still perfectly fine, PI works fine, mining works fine, there’s still ships in O-V and buybacks so industry is going fine?
---
I'm looking to start PI in nullsec, and I would like like to make an optimal setup to provide materials for making fuel. I'd like to do it on one character, and with him I have command center upgrades IV and interplanetary colonization IV. If need be I could upgrade both if that's required for a good setup.
---
I have tried Googling for some guides but they seem outdated or made for hisec. I just couldn't find anything good yet. Does someone have a good setup to share or a guide they could still recommend for using at this day and age? I hope you guys can help!
---
I jerked off several times. Ty OP
---
did that nerf not happen already 
---
It's really happening! Soon, we will drop sov and live out our destiny. The **Jita Plan** ... hatched by the Great Sapporo Jones himself, perfect incarnation of the appearance that a leader should have, Guarantee of the Fatherland's Unification, and Sun of the TEST Nation. 
---
Yeah just don’t liquidate your SP.
---
Oh yeah I like using Agency 3’a and standard regular drugs for the manageable penalties.
---
No.
---
Highsec. The circlejerk goes that horde has been earning trillions and that leadership is taking it for themselves. Now apparently they got control of the high-sec market, and the horde (alliance) coffers are empty.
---
I either don't know or can't say (due to opsec) what's happening to the isk, but there's something we KNOW for sure - TEST does NOT control the high-sec market like they make their linemembers control. It still under structures that are PANFAM aligned - albeit at lower taxes.
---
I think they had a nerf ready to deploy but put it on hold for a bit I believe.
---
Too many bots and too much afk content. Super proliferation is bad. CCP needs to change cyno mechanics,
---
whooshed right over me
---
Agreed and now he'll make No Vacancies worse for the wear.  Who knows though a change of pace may wake up his competent side.
---
Check out vector file formats, many scaling without looking pixelated
---
The problem is the campaign hasn't been short. The campaign is ending but after it accomplished the goals of swt out to do with the fall of the high sec trade wall. So if you disfigure the high sec war decs that have been going on and this taint as the same campaign then it makes sense to shift gears. 
---
Ah it was so heavily downvoted I couldn't even see it - ty sir!
---
No worse than PH being pets of PL who are pets of NC.
---
Yeah, I'm not going to touch the SP. I was originally playing to extract it but decided against it. Easy enough to just inject a new character up
---
Thats what i thought,  awesome 
---
"Important missions" will vary greatly in the amount of standings that they give, and if you're just doing L1 Storylines, or just really easy to do Cosmos missions, then you won't get a lot back for your time. 
---
Although it's old, the [Faction Standings Repair Plan](http://wiki.eve-inspiracy.com/index.php?title=Faction_Standing_Repair_Plan) is a good start to understanding how standings work. 
---
Be sure to pay attention to how your Social skills affect standings and standings gain, as well as learning faster methods of improving faction standings, like epic arcs, COSMOS missions, and Faction Warfare. Also check out the Impetus Glamourex boosters, which increase your faction standings gain. 
---
we have certainly not had complete control of the market. Nobody is contesting that.
---
My claim, is that you were making between 600 and 900bil monthly before we came. You now make enough to buy new harassment azbels.
---
Since your renter regions, member rent etc, does not come close to that im unsure how i am incorrect.
---
You if you think the beans live off spod...
---
&gt;That was the first one. There was a second nerf, which was less drastic.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I think, a working nerf would not just be playing with the numbers, but rather make a mechanic different. Like make them susceptible to jams. Or very cap dependent, that it requires a logi chain which can be broken etc.
---
Thanks for playing spaceships with us up in Geminate Friends.

TIL
---
I don’t think I’ve ever used a TEST citadel for market purposes. I either use Jita or O-V
---
Inc. &gt; VG.
---
VG confirmed bads, get rekt
---
In next season of The Horde Rumble it'll be Inc. bombing a VG. fleet
---
Meh, a fax outdoes 3-4 dreads.
---
Bit much if you ask me 
---
if you have facts im fine to make corrections or change my opinion. 
---
We’ve still got more good boy points than you.
---
100%.  VG is just full of "Trash Tier" FCs and the like.
---
the question is how big a subcap fleet can you form?
---
100?
---
200?
---
Do you have a Top line FC?
---
1?
---
2?
---
What are their schedules like daily?
---
2hrs?
---
10hrs?
---
whats your funding model? how much of a reserve do you have?
---
5bil?
---
5tril?
---
somewhere in between?
---
most importantly though.
---
What do you WANT to do?
---
why are you interested in space?
---
Vily said on TiS that it's more than 500bil a month... And since TEST also rents out regions (in much better space) so they can relate. Therefore, it's not hard for Vily to estimate that this was a huge part of Hordes income. Every idiot can read the MER, and with some brain, it's easy to guess how much money can be earned by Horde within their sphere of influence.
---
It's almost like they look at what you were using the ship for and fuck you extra hard in that area.
---
Salted liquorice is amazing! 
---
So say we all!
---
loki's the best subcap in the game pound for pound. does over 5k volleys and doesn't even suffer the usual arty application issue cause of the web subsystem. tengu's always been the king of pve, even in non-kinetic weak rats areas. the legion also has super strong fits but it's less used cause the loki's just better. proteus is the only one that's bad, at least in comparison to the others but that's mostly cause of it's weapon system and weakness to neuts. not to mention other fun things like cloak, bubble immunity and ceptor level warp speed with 3 rigs. they're meant to be jack of  all trades ships but they're also masters of quite a few things for virtually no penalty cause you don't even have to waste rigs and have enough cargo to refit to w/e.

I don't like tapi with the rest of them but [let's be fair here](https://zkillboard.com/war/619800/), they have been great content for the last few months.
---
That’s actually great 
---
Actually, TEST is not going home... We stopped the deployment to try to kill your supers, but the content JC deployment is still a thing. And nothing is more deadly to a player used region than being roamed regularly. With the dread cache still in the north, panfam can still not play risky, especially with hundreds of dread pilots that don't want to fly home their shit...  
---
In fact, I expect that the situation might get even trickier for Panfam. The obvious threat is over, while the annoyance stays with a decent level of unpredictability. Would be fun if a random fuckup on either side still escalates to a nice brawl.
---
I'll take all the feeds he wants to toss our way, but yeah, shit's still broken anyway

---
Does leave quite a bit of variance on what that bot number could be given the TZ question of downtime just happening to be right in the middle of Chinese prime time, but I don't think your conclusion with comparing it to 2009 being that far-fetched. Even if it's not as bad as it was then (which I'm going to say I don't think it is), that's still worrisome although I'd wager the actual number of active botting accounts is lower than most people would say if you polled the eve player-base.
---
Lol that's adorable. Smugging over internet spaceships
---
I just had the same thing happen to me. I was moon mining and the drones suddenly stopped mining. I tried a different rock and got the same thing. So i hopped into a cov and headed out. I got the "target is no longer present" message even though it was in space. So i am guessing the moon field has despawned but the game hasn't taken it out yet. Might be what happened to you as well.
---
confirmed death of learning limplants.  New implants to be introduced for a low low price of $1.99 each.  Thanks Pearl Aby$$
---
I think a solution might lay in giving the ageressor on the field an advantage, or rather penalizing caps that arrived later, or are jumping to a grid with already caps present.
---
I know this isn't a valid solution but it might make my point more clear: if every cap would get 1 second of locking delay for every other cap on the grid they are jumping into, this would give the escalating party a disadvantage. Say you drop 100 dreads on some poor fellow, if that fellows wants to call reinforcements those reinforcements will be sitting ducks for at least a certain amount of time.
---
Or maybe instead of a locking delay a reduced damage/repair output. Something to give the first party on grid a strong advantage, big enough that it stands a chance against a much bigger counter drop.
---
Which part is that for? The shadow? I made that in Photoshop because I liked it better than Illustrators. 
---
Thats lame, isn't there enough milk in the whiskey by this point?  
---
Yup! I changed F1-2-3 to Q W E and sshift+F1-2-3 to A S D. It's so much better.
---
I mean, if that's true, then all the big talk about TAPI proving they could deploy north and go toe to toe and stand alone as their own alliance was really just bluster and cover for deploying to hisec to grind structures.
---
Everything else they did was, by your framing, just window dressing, and really didn't even prove tapi could stand alone, since every major event had at minimum goons, and often init, snuff, and other legacy, all piling in to help. And even then, everything but the hisec stuff was, ultimately, a failure.
---
There's no silver lining here, frankly - the only way you find one is if you admit that everything progod said other than "let's get hisec money" was just lies to convice tapi linemembers to grind in hisec.
---
Somebody can correct me if I’m wrong but I don’t think there is a much of a difference between high and null sec PI besides there just being many more resources. I also don’t think PI has changed much if at all in years now so the guides you found should be fine. 
---
Be you
---
Get flair baited
---
That's fucking cool
---
Okay thanks for the tips, will check them out. You guys are in the thick of it right now eh? I arrived just in time for the move south last time which is why I burned out so quickly trying to keep up with fleets, cap ops, sov claiming plus running JF’s and industry jobs on the side do jumping full on into that kind of brawl would either leave me feeling a bit redundant in a skill redundant boat or a liability without some non stratop fleet time in the current metas. I’ve got 90 odd days of V’s to do for light fighters scouts and DD rapid blapping to max out as they were added in, plus need to figure out where if anything I’m missing for fax, finish t2 Titan guns and refocusing all V’s from Moros (rip again) to revs. I’ve been enjoying just messing around in WH space buffing my scanning and mapping back again in a loltank T1 frig alpha. Glad to here Jeff is still about. It was sampling on his podcast with Grath and Hedliner that dragged me back when I thought I’d escaped. ) 
---
Yea sorry wrong alliance bud.
---
How about add a fuel cost to the ship with the cyno for every ship jumping through it
---
succinct summary of all of eve online https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyS1kET_6nI
---
So you're talking like specifically cloaky hunting Loki? Cause that's one specific role. In fleets I would say the Legion is leagues ahead of the Loki in both a mainline and logistics role, the Proteus has uniquely powerful hunting capabilities due to it's warp speed buff and puts out significantly more damage than the Loki can muster sustained, and the Tengu I think fulfills too different of a role to really compare directly but ECM on a mainline DPS ship is huge.  
---
I won't disagree with you that the Loki is strong, but you can't focus on one area of it's usage and claim that it's the king of everyhing because of it. Projectiles have no fear of neuts but neither do HAM/RLML which is honestly what you see more on both Loki and Legions.  
---
All of the T3Cs can do nullfied and if anything the Proteus is far better at being a super fast warp speed machine, so I'm not sure what the relevance of that point is.
---
I think the best we have is the 25% cap you land at - being on-grid gives you a cap advantage &amp; time to have your ship stopped. 
---
Penalizing new arrivals much more would make it super hard to ambush a cap fleet, which is where a lot of hubrisdunks come from (since nobody intentionally jumps their caps into a much bigger cap fleet without a plan). 
---
I agree. They had a good strategy to start with and could have certainly kills some supers or Titans but as the recording confirms, complete chaos with a steady stream of Dreads/carriers being fed. Hell, he didn't even have supers/titans logged in yet and the battle was half over. Good plan, terrible execution. GF to my Test brethren and I hope to see you in Gem again soon. Lets wreck some fleets together. 
---
1. I'm keen to the Punisher bait, this was not a Punisher. 
---
2. Kitey kites are annoying and stupid. It's a tactic, but not one I like to use.
---
3. My point was it's a lame tactic, and a stupid way to achieve a kill. Try and change my mind... you can't. 
---
 the entire panfam super fleet to be exact 
---
WRONG.
---
I wasnt there.
---
idk dude did you see how quick XIX crumbled?
---
Those PAMFAM aligned structures are all 0% tax structures, and thus earn absolutely 0 isk for Horde.

Damn right, we didn't even need PLNC for this one, we growing up boys.
---
Well sad part is Horde cant stand on their own either. So really it just looks like one side pointing at the other when they cant handle their shit well alone either. 
---
Horde standing alone will never happen. PL and NC. Will always be involved. 
---
Wow, nice reach there. 
---
Factually incorrect. Case in point; [This](https://i.imgur.com/rWcVTmx.png) is the PANFAM aligned structure that currently is by FAR the main trade citadel for injectors, extractors and plex.
---
Unless you can somehow prove me wrong?? I am open to corrections, of course, if you can back them up instead of spewing random, incorrect information.
---
So accurate. And holy shit that video is glorious
---
The problem on some level is that it's pointless to even show up, unless you can field more titans than the enemy titan fleet. 
---
If you go to someone else's space with a dreadbomb, you'll get 1337420Turb0d4nk3d by their titan fleet. (Unless they decide *not* to use their "I win with 0 losses" button and instead lose tens or hundreds of billions fighting you conventionally, but they have no reason to be nice on this front.) 
---
I'm getting made fun of for pointing this out in the thread about test's huge dreadwelp earlier, but it's pretty accurate as far as I can tell; you can either show up in something fast enough to dodge their supers, or heavy enough to beat their supers. And the only thing heavy enough is your own super fleet. 
---
hey now, its was really important for him to tell the additional dreads to "have a cyno in the extra mid slot" xD
---
Jin should have stopped talking a long time ago.

Hey, this thread is for NCPL smug, where TAPI must not counter-smug!
---
I've said it a thousand times and I'll say it again, Geminate content is best content. Just hope we don't see a drop in content. Need those frags coming our way!
---
well that's kind of disappointing
---
Nice, loved the video!
---
As a line member, I don't see anyone talking about annoyance. Are their neuts roaming through Germinate daily? Sure.  But trust me when I say that hasn't put a dint in anything.  I'm not spinning.  I'm not deflecting.  I'm simply saying the roams haven't gotten to a level where anyone in any of the line member channels, or on comms in standing, bitches about it.  I haven't heard peep one.  The roams haven't been effective.  Step them up a deal, and perhaps they would be?
---
Lmfao rough neck joe I knew he would eventually lose a Super one day. That guy farmed so much isk the last two years it’s doubtful that he even feels the loss. He has a few more supers.

NCPL are part of our coalition.  Goons are supposedly not part of TEST's.  No one would particularly begrudge Legacy alliances chipping in, it's the goon hand-holding that makes TEST look foolish.

I’m pretty sure Jeff Raider spent it all on a mango farm. He knew the writing was on the wall and got in before Hilmar started selling Mangos 2 mouthfuls at a time with extra for a custom mango skin. Grath’s the fall guy which is why he’s still here so he can get ahead of Jeff in the Advocado game. He knows all those millennials love smashed advocados and Grath’s just the man to smash them with a blaster Kronos right up their arse.
---
Hedliner’s behind the meta here. By the time he gets in the game it could be fucking kiwi fruit and is likely shorting lemons hoping for a no deal brexit and a return to colonial G&amp;T drinking at 4 on the lawn, which he will not get off unless you have 100 bottle openers. Gobbins likes dem apples and PGL is probably all in on sour grapes right about now.

All of these accomplishments are good, though we of course had intended to do more this month."     
---
-Baloney, you just gave us content right next door. We've all had a ball shooting all the dinos you have sent up to Geminate. You seem to be focused on ISK and one-upmanship. We are focused on PvP. I dont care where we are or who we are shooting. GF

Literally any nullblock with Reddit posters does this
---
what try? Those supercap fights had a token horde showing, out of hundreds of supers and titans you whole alliance combined for 40ish supers and titans combined on the massive dread feed. Without NC showing up for those fights you never undock those supers and test rolls you with subcaps. It was a great trap and well executed by you guys, but try to keep the chest beating to believable levels.

&gt; skill injectors are both the worst decision CCP Games has ever made, and likely the worst development decision they will ever make
---
Thing is, with mindless nullsec carebears they don't really need to care about it; this game will be still running in 10 years.
---
Without any meaningful political/territorial development, yes, but the game will still be available.
---
wow this is very citation needed right here 
---
Depends how you look at it, you nerd the fax so dreads easily outperform fax and the situation is reversed, you have a cheap after insurance ship that has no real counter.

Damn it Wilmore, stop beating me to my replies.

Yeah if they fully commit they'd definitely win. Definitely. It'd be a steamroll but... naaah better not do that because reasons. 
---
When did they declare that?
---
Sitting in coms last night listening to this guy get money thrown at him I just knew it would wind up on reddit.
---
we do this thing on fleets sometimes where the FC will just pick a random new guy out of the crowd who has recently started playing the game and those of us with more money than most players can imagine just throw a few hundred mill or bill depending on the mood at the person picked.
---
Agreed on making an agreement with the larger entity first. 
---
We had about 10 dudes shitting on CAS in syndicate for 2 or so months, but it got shut down because they had a stronger diplo game with init who were nearby at the time. 
---
We fought them off at first when they only brought feroxes but there’s nothing we can do against 100+ Mach’s with cap support.

this is good

If you see as victory being camped for 2 months and mine like 500kkk isk in december in geminate while test mined 4500 in esoteria in same period ,then yes horde is wining...what an epic try to spin kill of 1-2 dread bombs by all north vs test subcap fleet :D
---
I'm not a CCP executive. I love this game and its complexity and its important to me to point out the great things this game offers. I think its a huge challenge to keep the sandbox nature of this game while also providing clear mechanics and fair gameplay for the players. CCP is doing a very good job in that regards and they deserve appreciation for that.
---
Is there anything really left of BAT to leave? 
---
no, i'm talking t3cs as a whole, which the thread is about (t3c sp loss). not sure why you're isolating one thing from another. i gave a few specific examples just so i don't talk out my ass. but my point is that they are too strong in some roles while being perfectly capable of doing a whole bunch of other stuff well with virtually no penalty. the sp loss is warranted imo
---
In the current post-facts era we live in, you don't need to declare anything. Just say someone did something and that's enough. 
---
Fuuuuuck, you caught me.
---
It's almost like they could have given it an "effect" like with the Network Sensor Array that keeps you from docking/jumping..   But that's none of my business.

Just get a tattoo of a fat neckbearded moneky hitting a giant F1 key with a large trout while you are at it mate.

They have some nice guys there, I know Kismeteer would like to get more guys active, so I hope he is able to do that.
---
LMAO
---
Ooof, I would've paid a few hundred mil and had that Nyx bpo JF'd by those more skilled than me
---
Idk if EVE in general has 500 active players

We must get a group of good trolls, mama' boys, basement dwellers, and grills to form

What’s the point of playing this game if you make an NIP with everyone around you? 
---
ikr? never try to move the big stuff that way, it rarely ends well lol

13 year vet here. For the first time in my eve history, I've reduced rather than expanded by eve footprint. I went from 1 to 2 to 5 to 8 accounts over the years. Currently only have 1 Omega, and it runs out in a couple months.
---
What the rest of these vets are saying are my issues too. The game is still a unique offering to MMO players... but that's like saying "that book had a pretty cover and a sweet title." The inner workings are what are most important, and Eve's are swirling down the drain. Bugs all over that take weeks or months to get attention. Glacially slow balance passes. Years and years of unfulfilled promises about design directions and balance changes. Rorqs, caps, supers, donuts, small gangs, WHs, lowsec are all in bad shape and CCP doesn't seem to have any plan whatsoever to deal with them, I'd they even acknowledge a problem in the first place.
---
It's hard to think I'm moving on from eve, but what CCP is delivering isn't worth my money or time anymore.
---
I liked kismeteer but daktar staying with PL doesn’t bode well as he was definitely their top member.
---
So you would have a fax.
---
LMAO I love this spin
---
"we won cause we mined more!!1!!"
---
Kind of the opposite I think.  For any healthy MMO there will always be an influx of new marks.  It seems like CCP just bubble-wrapped a lot of classic ganking scenarios, as opposed to, y'know, making them HTFU.
---
I still remember the outcry over how grossly barges got buffed, and how even after almost any fit was virtually ungankable, they still died en masse because people flew them around untanked with nothing but mining rate boosters.
---
So many words to say 'nooberdog fed my lane.'
---
fc what is srp
---
Glue a massive red button on top of the key. 
---
I was going to say that’s what I use because Casper told me to
---
Prop, scram/point, web, guns.
---
Always putting web after scram/point so I don't ever web them into warp before landing the scram.
---
Generally I find prop highest priority, so f1. 
---
Amazing contribution to the community! Keep it up Jester, thank you!
---
The Btron has spoken.
---
neat, thanks
---
Something Test paid a lot more of then Horde without having a highsec market.
---
Please stay
---
I use F2 for my weapons. F1 is my prop mod.
---
Ok, I was wrong. The Triglavian ships cant fill the roles of a lot of current fleet ships and are not the best at everything, with some of their own weaknesses and counters. I learned that at least from this thread, if nothing else.
---
However, I disagree with your point about 1v1s. Removing such a fundamental part of pvp from the balancing equation is not something you can do, even if they are not common anymore. In fact considering abyssal arenas you cant even claim that much. 
---
Before Triglavian ships, 1v1s were fairly balanced in their class. Few ships truly ruled because in a mutual fight against a similar role where combat is forced to within long point range, every ship had a counterplay for it. With the Drekavac and to a far lesser extent the Leshak and Vedmak, they have no true threats; If you ask to 1v1 me with a Drek I cannot bring any single battlecruiser and tilt the odds in my favor. In a brawl, he has damage and tank over anything, and cannot be scram kited. In a ranged scenario, his range and damage can match any BC (Baryon ammo and heavy pulses with scorch *start* the fight disturbingly close to each other). Utility wise, the single cap booster and easy potential for triple small neuts make capacitor warfare need a dedicated ship with multiple neuts and possibly talismans to really win the fight. Your best bet is reliance on ECM drones, which may turn the tide on the closest fights but then you sacrifice DPS for RNG and can be countered by a smartbomb in the utility slot. Where previously you could see a solo brutix and say "Maybe my cyclone could take it, or I can try a harbinger or hurricane" the only ships that come to mind with the utility you need to solo a Drek would be perhaps a curse, or an inferior ship with multiple neuts, good tank and talismans. The fact that an additional ship can turn the tide could be said of almost any ship interfering in any 1v1 and is not representative of a weakness. I have definitely learned that Triglavian fleets are not as unbeatable as I thought, but for the rare 1v1 I see no viable way of killing them, or at least the Drekavac.
---
 \&gt;and while we have had plenty of successes in the North 
---
I see you can get vily out of goons but never goons out of vily
---
that tends to be the case when you lose almost 300 capitals ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Cool stuff, thanks for updating! Although the flattening of the curve in the summer of 2018 worries me a little, part of it might be explained by the big war that happened.
---
You're stuck with us mate. Call us whatever you want.
---
I am pretty sure I have seen this more than once since I started playing Eve?  
---
Apart from apparent autism, is there any other reason and what do MC have to do with this (may they rest in piss)?
---
What?
---
Some quick advise, some may be obvious but anyway
---
Look out for smallish corps in lowsec while you roam, check their killboard. A good indicator of activity/competence is the ratio of corp members to active PvP characters. Like 100 members and only 5 active PvP chars... bad idea to join. 
---
Make sure the kills aren't 100% gate camping ones.
---
Make sure the corp is in your timezone.
---
Joining a competent lowsec corp isn't easy with a low skilled char but you can always point out you can scout and tackle off gate with a Frig/Ceptor.
---
"taken your main income source" As is its completly gone, and this invasion is totally unrelated to it?
---
There is a mod contact button that will allow you to message them without forcing us all to see a post crying that your post was deleted.
---
Jump into battle eject ships for newbs who died during battle to keep fightin!
---
You are in the wrong place then TBH
---
There are plenty of dudes here been spending thousands of hours into EVE and still hate every aspect of it
---
we have taken it from you. You will absolutely be able to try and take it back.
---
The two events are related but not exactly interconnected.
---
it's a maintenance bay not a construction bay
---
I think I have some understanding of the issues that come with the ability to instantly inject another Rorq alt or a Titan pilot.  But I can tell you that I would have quit this game in under a week if I had found out that my character would never be able to match abilities with someone that happened to start playing 10 years before me. 
---
I can't say for sure what percentage of newer players feel the same way. I do know I've heard enough people say something similar to think the game would have much worse issues with new player retention without injectors. 
---
Vily, I understand your need to create a narrative that gives your fighters a positive ending to this deployment. It's your job afterall. However stating that Horde "Turtles up"  is laughable. Goons turtle up, witness fortress Delve. Hordlings will always flow like water towards conflict. It is in our nature.    
---
How ?
---
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1SV_sWWIinoheBaGZgL2nUVJGYwnsNJqJ
---
Amazing read. Goes over lots of stats and stuff, may be a little outdated, post I found it from was posted a year ago.
---
I don't know about all that. Legacy vs all of Panfam might be way closer than you thing
---
GAY?
---
Well, and when lose a few Titans winning UALX and another dunking more dreads in D-G then we lost the whole time up north, and when every little gate camp you do gets SRP.
---
So yeah. I'm not sure what you are getting at.
---
It was said a while back. I'll go look up the post and show it later but for now I'll let you sit and wonder rather than doing your own research for you. 
---
r/wooshers
---
once again, both things can be true. You have turled up AND your ok with it.
---
and why do people keep saying we are ending the deployment?
---
I mean but in every situation outside of cloaky hunting there are better choices that don't have the SP loss. Yes they're very versatile ships but you can't fit them to do multiple roles at the same time, and if you're just saying because you can refit them to do a bunch of different things that's hardly a good reason to necessitate skill loss.
---
The fuck are you talking about ?
---
Sure. Goons wanted to get me in jail. Falcon saved them. Falcon started a bully campaign against me. Falcon banned me from running for CSM. Totally just coincidence.

---
Where did the rest of the money went I wonder.
---
TIL battleships and HACs are smaller than Jackdaws.
---
there's nothing to get, if you wanna start deflecting with little zingers expect others to respond in kind.
---
To piggyback on this, not all fleets are pvp or roaming oriented. We have "locust fleets" where all the mega ships move to a nearby region and mine all the moons. Definitely lots of action for miners. We also do a Corp fleet every Saturday night called Saturday night Swarm. We usually just camp a busy gate and bullshit in comms while you enjoy your drink or herb of choice. It's a lot of fun.
---
I'm sure most bigger alliances have similar activities so stop playing alone and find some friends to play with! 
---
&gt; You try to log in to Eve with your password Hunter2
---
Sorry what password? I only see ******
---
Mind blown.
---
Right now? In the current climate, move to Providence as your first practice run, Providence is a decent opponent currently for an alliance that size, pick a constellation and have a go.
---
Ah, you're one of those edgy kids I keep hearing about on the internet.  You know it's 2019 and calling someone gay isn't an insult anymore, right?  In fact, it just makes you look like an ignorant dick.  But thanks for confirming my suspicions, at least.  
---
Blarft was also ok , or Baltec .... but most of the old guard not playing any more tbh.
---
And you are? Lol v0v
---
Your hypocrisy is terrible. Panfam is a coalition, and must fight against the biggest coalition allied to the 2nd largest coalition, and all their pets. All that is about 50% of eve while northerns forces are around 15%.  And you blame PH for being helped by NC?
---
[http://coalitionsin.space/#/graph](http://coalitionsin.space/#/graph)
---
No, you just don't get how much fucking Isk we're talking about.
---
We're not talking about buying a few Titan BPOs  so you can give dudes BPCs, or SRP money, or fuel blocks, or any shit like that.
---
We're talking about multiple trillions. Like your leadership could have given out an entire Titan fleet with the amount of Isk that comes from the Perimeter market.
---
But it's cool.  Keep drinking the Kool Aid.  The numbers are there for you to figure this out yourself.
---
I don't really see why any battleship should expect to live if it gets webbed, grappled and scrammed, but maybe that's just me.
---
he's saying the thread OP is flairbaiting
---
#:WORDS:
---
&gt; You guys are having alot of fun atm. True You are focused on PVP, i think thats likely accurate more than its not true.
---
And one side in this conflict has SRP.
---
WAIT
---
I MADE THIS
---
THIS FEELS WEIRD 
---
Weren't MC just some trash highsec wardeccers?
---
On a serious note, there are little instances where the long train will be worth it if you're new to the game.
---
The PLEX vault is not what EVE should be about.
---
You should be allowed to make all your own mistakes.
---
Nunca hice algo mejor en el eve que desligarme de la comunidad hispana, todo es drama y realmente buenos pilotos no hay. Para hacer pvp no tiene sentido. Ahora seguro rekium es bueno para hacer pve, minar hablar un poco en comms y realmente no hay mas con que darle. Crecer en el eve no es solo tener una nave mas grande... 
---
Lol there are scammers in 1dq1 now. I bet that's pretty lucrative too 
---
you seem to assume that regularly roaming geminate is a scary thought to horde.
---
do you forget how many beans we have.  and how....dare i say lustful they are for anything to shoot at.
---
having more fleets makes them happy.
---
newbeans freaking love it, ever seen how much they complain in discord or plusten when theres no enemies to go hunt.
---
BL learned, as did snuffed out.  hell everyone "roaming" geminate when we first moved in learned. 
---
&gt;Goons wanted to get me in jail.
---
Speculation. One of the involved criminals tweeted something dumb. They'd have to be even dumber than the average vandal to think that it'd have put you in jail.
---
&gt;Falcon saved them.
---
Or perhaps he worked out a deal with them?
---
&gt;Falcon started a bully campaign against me.
---
Overly sensitive victim complex. *Yawn*.
---
Falcon banned me from running for CSM. 
---
False. You ran a [non-campaign telling people to not vote](https://forums-archive.eveonline.com/topic/460889/). You're still welcome to run for the CSM, even without subscribing, as long as you run a valid campaign. 
---
Maybe you're really a Goon shill because you must know that it'd be impossible to prevent Goons from voting (they're power hungry, right?), yet your campaign encourages people to refrain from voting which would the Goon's bloc voting power. Hmmm.

Weird timeline there.

What is the best option for testing ship fittings out? I assume it isn't the ingame fitting tool (although it has come a long way since 2011...). I want to toy with some options before I pimp my Gila.
---
&gt; These are draining on horde 
---
Lordy thank you, god please dont send anymore of your roaming fleets down the fuckpipe to O-V , Ive been getting so very weary of the effortless content I enjoy, when I decide to login every other day.  
---
   
---
Lordy mercy I beg ya sir...PLEASE DONT **SEND MORE ROAMING GANGS.**
---
It's a conspiracy :(
---
&gt; disagree with the "F2P is the end of eve" sentiment
---
The sentiment here however is more "injectors+rorqs is the end of EVE", which, while obviously also wrong, is closer to the reality.
---
Also, huh, didn't know that SWA (or other non-CAS rookie corps) are actually organised. Nice!
---
Is your settings turned down so you don't see their lasers? 
---
Everyone's happy to hop into their fucking HAW dread and snuff out the 4-man gang in the local area just so they can make a pvp highlight video of them dunking on nerds.
---
&gt; Fozzie has been actively running the game into the ground
---
Holy fuck, have you ever been employed in a corporation? Working on something as a team? This "blame Fozzie for 2nd World War" bullshit is immature and ridiculous.
---
Lol, sucks when allofeve.jpeg isnt on your side doesnt it?
---
For the SMA, I'd assume it's to keep them from becoming combat jump freighters, since they can already carry a fuck ton of modules in their fleet hangar
---
Gotta keep the JF role relevant?

I dont really like the formfactor?

You might wanna downsize to this : [https://www.artlebedev.com/optimus/mini-six/](https://www.artlebedev.com/optimus/mini-six/)

It’s free to play, try it, work through the tutorial, then join a new player friendly corp, there are so many things to do, you’ll have to figure that out.
---
Hold on .
---
I thought it was only a week.
---
Between Horde and other things that have gone on there, Geminate is by far one of my favorite regions. I only really like Cloud Ring better.
---
It's pretty, but not a good game. 
---
Problem is it allows a titan to not need to care about sub caps just lance them and be done with it. I just think for balance the aoe ness needs to go. Ccp stated before there are to many supers so they should be making them better lol
---
We* are fixing his garbage FTFY
---
Thanks for forgetting about me:( 
---
Motherships were the names for supers in EVE before the dominion patch I believe. 
---
Can you rephrase whatever you are trying to say to proper English please?
---
So, t3c is nerfed and even had a sp-loss on death and still so many people use it? I mean if it's nerfed - don't use it, and if it's still one of best sub-cap options - enjoy higher risk.
---
t3c is unique and good, that is why they come with additional costs.
---
Can I get the name of your dealer? Sounds like he's got that good shit 🌬️
---
Nice, putting the onus of proving your point on someone else while retreating because you know you're talking out of your ass. Fuck off, nerd.
---
Repackaging in containers would be amazing.
---
But making SMAs hold unassembled ships because of ~~logic~~ is about like complaining about how eve physics are often not like real life physics.
---
Or maybe Gobbins is just conservative with his spending and puts by for a rainy day, you know like battling a long attrition war designed to deny isk making opportunities for the non Titan poors in the line to reship and continue to let TAPI throw money onto the fire of a failed beach-head. Given what PL bro’s funded out of their own pockets to setup Horde then Gobbins is the last person I’d expect to be in it for the money. I mean for what? Be some guy who robbed a newbro alliance of money he’ll never spend, or go down in Eve lore as the newbro powered rock everyone broke on? I don’t think when we’re done anyone will remember who was rich in Eve but an awful lot of people will remember who fought the good fight. 
---
He's talking out of his ass about things he doesn't know.
---
Yep. His name is called trolling.
