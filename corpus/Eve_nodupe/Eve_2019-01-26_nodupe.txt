Imagine going through every single system, hopping to anomalies, and not even knowing you've been doing it to every single site for 7 empty systems. This end local bandwagon doesn't comprehend most of the fallouts of what they're asking for.

Ah, I thought you could get it to work by URL shenanigans, but maybe not
---
There's no dilemma here.  There are plenty of corps that will take you irrespective of your kill board.  Most will want to interview you first but that's no big deal.
---
Yes. But not if you're criminal and killed by CONCORD.
---
not the same, those were all play styles based on killing ships. The goons style and the chinese style is to blue people and krab. Thats the dangerous one

does this have anything to do with the bbq?

Depending on the slot it takes, literally any scram-kite solo ship?

Just off the top of my head, I'm sure there's more, but depending on the implant slot I would almost say basically any solo/small gang could utilize it at least to some degree

Can we get some cool "fore" skins?

I dunno, I found a new game.
---
After a character joins a corporation it takes 7 days for their standings to take an effect on the corp average. If they then leave or are kicked, it will recalculate at the next downtime. To remain in  FW you just need to keep the corp's overall standing above 0 to the faction. You can raise this average by making alts to put into the militia and sharing FW missions with them to gain faction standing and prop it up if your friend has low standing.

Just because they're not useful in fleets doesn't mean they're not useful. The game doesn't revolve around fleet doctrines, there are plenty of other aspects both pvp and pve.
---
Blasters apply well when target is webbed and scrammed. 
---
Unless these have changed recently, in which case fair enough.
---
But like I said, just because that weapon system isn't very useful in mid-large scale combat doesn't mean it's not useful in small/solo.

EVE is the sound and you are the colour dude. You gotta look for things in the game that gel for you. If you truly believe you can't "move forward" then my advice would be to go to high sec and start ganking power, you'll soon find a niche.
---
If you want to stick go industrial stuff then join any large null alliance. I think you are blue balling yourself by saying you are stuck not able to join a group cos of your background.
---
If you want something completely different join a wh group and find a place in there.
---
Point is there is definitely something you can do on the game. If you tell yourself there's nothing you can do cos of what you've done before I admire your innocence

Get a Freighter alt to haul the filled load to the refinery. Or (if you trust your friends in local) place an MTU in the center and just jetcan the ore occasionally. Bring a freighter out to collect when you feel necessary.
---
Eve Online and Kancolle crossover when? 
---
Does the revenant drop fighters? What if instead of having bots teleported to hs, they are teleported to a random last wave sanctum. And get eaten alive by a human player ratting. That would be hilarious
---
Not even close, they owned delve to the drones well after fatigue was added.
---
Drones are still fairly flexible in terms of weapon choice. Selectable damage and access to sentries/heavies gives a decent engagement profile. Some groups even use a 100mn version (don’t know how often anymore) that is fairly tanky.
---
But more than likely when it comes to which HAC an alliance uses, it probably came down more to the politics or preferences of the leadership. That applies to all doctrine choices though.

Always wanted a dreadnought now that i have one like 3 years after i created my account.. i have nowhere to fly it save ish.. 
---
TRI was formed for a final timer on a old school azbel and had no plans on defending the fort as we knew it was dead as soon as Snuff/Init decided to shoot it. So as soon as the fort hit armor timer we moved out of it. As for PL and NCdot, they knew about the timer and decided to go there to see if they could get a fight. The main fight that involved tri was over the azbel timer, not the fort timer.

Some goals like T2 production and running a corporation I could do any time - just have not chosen take the plunge yet.  The longer I play eve, the less fun I think it would be to run a corporation - yet I actually have a significant cause to create one now (and I do think it would be an active, successful corporation - if i put in the hundreds of hours of work needed).

As far as The Agency, the only fix is removal. 
---
You should do some research on how these things work. The government needs constant budgets to operate. When politicians debate over the budget to the point that they don't pass a new one, the government 'shuts down' because there's no funding allocated until the dispute is resolved. It's not like Trump pushed a button and nuked the federal government, it's a budget dispute between different aspects of the elected government.

---
This is literally how I wound up back in the game after taking most of 7 years off.
---
Wut? This implant would actually make sense for a blingy brawler. Every extra meter of scram range my Deimos gets helps in catching a kiter. Makes no difference for a brawler vs an arazu and friends. Even if he catches you at a T2 bonuses scram max range you’re still fucked. 
---
theft would be sufficient. 
---
Well that's a whole different issue from what is described by the OP in the thread. There is no mention of bad blood or one way friendships, just that they decided to leave and now its no fun.
---
I am afraid but also interested
---
lol 
---
Untrue. You just need a ship that can tank. Active tank blaster boats are terrifying to fight, especially when in the case of a Deimos it can permatank a small gang. 
---
Definitely remove local in null.

I meant that if you put a little pressure on the guys, there are no fences stopping you and they will buy you off with Fortizars.

With keepstar’s that is less of an issue anymore. Only time you would really need the coffin char is if you are deployed out of a fort. 
---
I don't believe you have a license for selling fake badges. It just so happens... 
---
If I find a nice hole to rat in i.e. lots of combat sites. I scan down every signature in that wormhole. If there are more wormholes than the one that I came through and the static’s, I leave that hole alone and go to the next. Not risking it even if it’s a lot of isk.

Weebs need to fucking neck theirselves (in-game)
---
Imagine being so bitter about a single alliance that you think someone who has identified himself as in INIT in this fucking thread is in pl because he calls you out on your shit.
---
I'm going to share a bit of my thought process here:
---
1) Based on what you said, any argument in favor or removing local will need to address the question of how players will find other players.
---
2) I know how I find people in w-space. I also know how some of the ways I find people in w-space break down. For example, the chief defense of a w-space PVE expedition is to intentionally close all wormholes into or out of the ratting system, and then ignore all sigs in the system. If a new sig appears, get safe quick. In practice, this leads to *very* safe ratting, not too dissimilar from the effect of a neutral in local on nullsec ratting.
---
On a positive note, I know that I can find a less cautious player in a wormhole system by doing a d-scan sweep of the system. The same technique works in nullsec (you just usually don't have time to employ it due to local), but the systems are larger. This suggests that nullsec PVE players could use a *lack* of local to introduce a defense where they "hide" in parts of systems that are inconvenient and unlikely to be d-scanned. Of course, if you know where the locals hide, you can go straight there... This strikes me as a pretty cool possible interaction.
---
On the other hand, I'm thinking about how annoying it is when I jump into a wormhole system where the residents store their ships loose in a POS. I see that from time to time in k-space too, but it's less annoying there because a glance at local tells me whether those ships are inhabited or not. (Usually.) With k-space logistics being generally easier for tossing d-scan clutter around, this has the potential to get very annoying very quickly, but CCP is also talking about removing POSes soon so it might not be relevant.
---
3) Everything in (2) presumes I'm able to get into a system that has a player active in it without getting spotted ahead of time. With a true "no local", cloaky eyes get *immensely* more powerful in nullsec. I can't find an empty system to stage my blops party out of anymore - there might be an Anathema who was watching me the whole time, and is ready to drop a HIC on my bridger the moment I decloak it. If I jump into a pipe system that's being watched, I don't know when to blitz and when to go slow to let my stragglers catch up. Let me be clear: Both of these would be nerfs to small-gang and roams, and I believe both would be positive changes for the game.
---
4) Cynos screw up everything. (*sigh*) My roaming gang can be defeated by eyes (or even ears) on relevant gates. A cloaky camper just parks in your system and waits. Then as long as that player is willing to keep that skill-farming account subbed (still \~free?), they eternally threaten to drop untold numbers of ships directly on top of you. What happens to this threat if local is removed? A cloaky camper showing in local (as now) is a camper that may or may not be at keys, and may or may not have reinforcements ready right now. A "maybe" threat. A system with nobody in local right now is a "definitely not" threat. There is no "yes" threat from cloaky camping. Removing local transmutes "definitely not"s into "maybe"s.
---
I firmly believe that you should be able to spend effort to make your space more safe. (Not totally safe, but *more* safe.) Example: Placing eyes on the gate to your pocket gives warning against roamers. Onlining a cyno-jammer prevents standard drops. I'm not convinced that safe from being watched is a reasonable level of safety. I'm not convinced that safe from there being anyone else in the system is a reasonable level of safety either (for nullsec level rewards), but I can see room for exploration of possible tweaks that would allow residents to spend effort and resources to neutralize the potential harm of a cloaky camper or other sneaky lurker.
---
5) This ended up being much more rambly than anticipated, so I'll just say that I want to think more about the population of different parts of nullsec and how relative densities might affect things. There's lots more to unpack, and local-as-it-exists-now and no-local-ever are not the only options.
---
You ever done development? adding N+1 coders doesn't necessarily make things go faster.  Also there are some people who like lore
---
Battle hardened veterans???
---
I've always wondered how can you tell its a macro and not just them copy pasting the same shit every 30 seconds?
---
why are you in tapi then
---
That looks more like a kikimora to me
---
Your reaction is exactly why I do this. One day I will have a use for these.
---
&gt;  Delve just needs more cloaky campers like marshy (minus the broadcasting) to stop the true cancer on the game which is bots that require 0 human input.
---
This is funny to see especially after the last time local died and bots were getting killed in every single null region across the game, in fact the death toll in delve outside the one guy who died with his mach fleet again was rather light because more than a few of us went bot hunting during the blackout.
---
If you sat in goon alliance chat all day and saw some of the pants on head mentally deficient things that get said/asked you'd doubt the average line member was smart enough to do that too.
---
this guy doesn't really understand ban evading, this is like the 6th time? i've had to ban him.
---
He doxxed someone, got banned, and has an ego bigger than Jupiter.
---
But how long did it take to come up with those 2000 accounts? If it was from the event this summer to winter than taking out 2000 accounts isn't much in the face of all the new ones popping up everywhere including highsec.
---
They could hope contest, and the player base vote on what they like, winner gets added.
---
in the end that worked out pretty well for you guys though.
---
Aren't they still cala/quix pets though. 
---
There is a keyboard command for "force blackscreen off" or something like that. Default is Shift + Backspace, I believe. In my experience it doesn't work, though.

RIP Skruff

---
Fort Knocks ghost girl when 
---
Yeah, but does Test really do anything?
---
Because if you get lucky, you are scamming the gankers into tho paying for the right to kill an empty freighter. The trick is to set the kill right price high enough to make money but still low enough to look attractive to gankers looking for freighter kills, then fly around in your insured freighter and wait for a customer, if/when they buy the kill right and kill you, you get the ship insurance payout which is close to a billion for a freighter plus what ever you charged for the kill right as long as you set the kill right price to be more than the insurance cost you make money.
---
&gt;Also there are some people who like lore
---
all 3 of them

&gt;adding N+1 coders doesn't necessarily make things go faster.

---
Yeah, I run the corp "The Milkmen" - wormhole life isn't for everyone, so I understand not wanting to dive into it.
---
Send your asshole into shock
---
No... you literally don't understand development then.  Shall I link you that silly NCIS clip where they have two people typing on a keyboard to counter the hackers breaking in?  A game development company needs to have multiple specializations.  Gallente versus Amarr.  Jove versus Sleepers.  All of these started as lore first.  If you like Eve, you don't have to like lore.  But you should atleast understand how it contributes to the game you like
---
Because hostiles outside of GSF still have no fucking clue as to how we work internally.

xddd dont dey pvp w other ppl so dat mean dey are pet of dose ppl?!?? Xddd im funy!!!!
---
A lot of activity dropped off in December. This was a combination of "What's the point?" and "Time to start moving" when it came to corps within alliances. That's strictly within the USTZ, I don't know what went on outside of that other than what I read in Discord. RMC seemed to play a lot of sides, i.e. trying to setup a dread bomb against HRE with TRI on the Armor timer of their Keepstar, with no luck. I like to think I'm pretty well versed when it comes to nullsec politics, and even I was having trouble keeping up with the various coalition lines that RMC was jumping frequently. I don't blame the Imperium for telling RMC to get up and move, though it came at an annoying cost to the activity of my corp. I will say that Brand Newbros and a few other corps in TEST were roaming through Period Basis semi-frequently, as well as us roaming into that pocket where IRC had been living, and we definitely got some fun USTZ fights out of it. Very small gang and not news worthy, but it was interesting.
---
They did try to fix local.  By outsourcing it to the "cloud" so it'd be scalable and have expert support.  How well did that work?  Lore is part of the game and a needed part.
---
WAKE ME UP
---
If you are a member of Goonswarm, be useful. If you are useful enough, get along with enough people, and stick at it for 2-7 years, you'll rise to a position of power or burn yourself out eventually.
---
Listen, I'm not going to shit on you for the sake of it. I'm glad you let a small alliance crash on your couch and build, most alliances wouldn't have done that. So for that, I give you thanks and props. I had nothing to do with leading that alliance, but I am really, really against your stance on botting. As for providing screenshots about your threat about Winter Coalition, I can't do that because you never said that in public channels. However, there was a very clear implication that if we attempted to speak to WinterCo about leaving RMC and joining, we would immediately be reset and killed. This was enumerated on a few times. Not a completely unreasonable stance to take, I suppose, given that you're intent on taking space from them, but doesn't exactly inspire the loyalty of future groups outside of your primary cultural base. I wish you guys good luck with hitting The East as I really don't like any of the entities that way, but I think you'll find the Chinese will protect their botting grounds pretty heavily.

With all this going on, if my mouse can be programmed with it’s software to map ctrl-r and shift-r to the back forward buttons, is that a macro? Does the client try to secrecy things like that?
---
At the time EVE was split in half. Half the map was controlled by NC. &amp; PL who set up a massive renter empire, the other half was controlled by the CFC who also set up their own renter empire. EVE was a shit game in those days.
---
Then CCP put out the Phoebe Jump changes that made it nigh on impossible to control that much land easily so both groups scaled back their demense a bit before basically shutting down renting for a few years then oh hey look, we have renters again (WERM, Pandemic Horde, Initiative etc.)
---
Sorry, opsec.

There are no jumpgates J-space...

I'd play with that but it's too over powered. a 20/19 for 0 kinda not right. Love the card though. o7
---
The whole point of a buyback program is that it is always there, and ITS EASIER for u!  U gift up a little isk for convenience.  Also, I would figure that compressed ore is a lot easier to move around than huge volumes of minerals.
---
So I just wanted to confirm, its a myth that rorquals make 110-150 million isk/hour? 
---
No clue, I think benefit of rorq is that u can make WAY more isk per hour minimally tending to a few rorqs than u can by micromanaging a few hulks.  I've heard 150mil/hr, but I've never moved in a rorq so I couldn't confirm. 90 Mill is nothing shake your head shot, especially when you're doing it with one account and very little interaction.
---
Turns out the reason is really boring.
---
Yeah, that's true. I'm planning on multiboxing it with a Covetor and an Incursion-runner for a good 270 mill + an hour. 
---
Good plan, just don't get ganked 😉

Seeing Wildly Inappropriate ping ponging around the north and especially losing Geminate really pulled at my heartstrings.

My alts talk shit to each other just to screw with the newest recruit and make them wonder why they joined. Never gets old.

My toon is nearly 12 years old, and I have 4 solo PvP kills to my name. Two of them were in the past few months in the Gal/Mil warzone. Fit some cheap cruisers, go wreck some faces, and have the grace to laugh when you inevitably get dunked. It's a ton of fun any way you slice it.

Not really. A bear hole doesn't make you a krab. I'm not paying for 14 accounts from my wallet, nor buying them ships from my wallet.
---
I'd love it if I could have 42 chars on one account, believe me. Until that happens, I need more plex and more isk to find it. If you'll donate 14 plex, I won't need more isk.. Aside from buying dreads, supers, etc

Vintage Matari Exodus, doing what they did best - getting great fights not with capitals, or with stupid blingy fits, but with raw skill, ingenuity, and cohesive teamwork.

---
Something that is unfortunately missing from the eve of today where a credit card, rorquals, and the era of disposable supercapital blobbing gets you everything you need. :(
---
uh excuse me they should be working on the chat system hello 
---
What ship were you flying? I heard we had some visitors earlier. Glad you had fun!
---
No haha it's not a myth.. maybe with normal 2nd ores but if you're mining 64 moons it's more like 2 to 3 times that per hour
---
I used to use my director alt from way back when I was in corp leadership in the old school NC days to pick fights with alts that no one but the other leaders knew were mine when I was bored. Sometimes I'd even get the alt killed in a shit fit freighter on the jita 4-4 undock to have something to talk shit to the alt about, the reaction in corp channel was always awesome.
---
Whats the yield on your rorqual?

---
:) 
---
We aren't exactly monolithic. Wormhole "terrain" is varied just like nullsec terrain, although the features are different. Just like different nullsec folks prefer different terrain tradeoffs, so do we.
---
Some things I can tell you: As far as I know, nobody rats in someone \*else\*'s C6. The dominant C6 ratting teams are too many dreads to fit out a wormhole and back, (or even too large to fit through a single wormhole at all), so those tend to get run "at home". For C5s, there's a bunch more variety, with the primary requirement being that the system has the type of sites you want to run in the first place.
---
Rorquals used to be more profitable (even after the various nerfs), but their prevalence and power is such that ore prices are in the dirt. Supply is ever-increasing even as demand is probably falling. Between the considerable sp and up front investment, I think they're a questionable path to wealth these days if you're not already set up.
---
Bear in mind that any logistics or hauling you do beyond the mining cuts into your isk/hour. If you haul the ore yourself, refine all the minerals, and sell or produce with them, then sure, you will make more money on paper. But you could have just been mining more, or doing something else that's even more profitable. 
---
I am no machinist, I am studying Plastics and Composites Engineering, but I am taking a CNC class as part of the degree program, and I have already taken a manual manufacturing class where we used a manual lathe, mill, and drill press.

Glad you had fun exploring, it can be very rewarding.

I'd recommend having a read around of https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/ 's wormhole articles. it has some great information on surviving wormhole adventures. Plus it's a great source of information for the game in general.

if i'm a greedy krab and want more gold i'll roll my static until i find a suitably empty c5 with plenty of green sites, jump my cap into and roll it's static too. i have a dedicated toon for my phoenix which serves as a hole roller/drifter killer. i don't bother with escalations (who does anymore).

with all the holes in my static rolled, i'll run all those green sites with rattles, kill all those drifters, and then use the phoenix to shut the door behind me as I jump back home.

You haven't had fun till you managed to manage to get all of the people you recruited to a corp to unwittingly picks sides in a fight between you and yourself that you staged by suiciding a hauler on the jita 4-4 undock in a shit fit badger. All because you had to setup a pos back in the days when it took hours and as a result you were so bored you were falling asleep at the keyboard while waiting for pos guns to anchor.
---
&gt;shit fit freighter 
---
how shit can you fit a freighter with 3 slots?
---
If you mean the NPC FW corps then yes
---
Holy shit I got goosebumps... 
---
I got some serious goosebumps man! Thank you for that! 
---
How big is your monitor?  Thanks for the video, Ishtars are so sexy
---
Wrong word, I meant hauler, it was badger on an alt with nothing more than the base skills and like 3 hours of training so it was literally what ever I could put on, I had shield hardeners, a 100 mm plate, hull rep, i think there was a missile launcher with fire works loaded, I had mines in the cargo hold. some cheap story faction mods I found in a station inventory, it was bad
---
nah they were in BL for a while, just recently
---
Can confirm.
---
Sometimes when people are being shitlords I will kick off z0r chains with my alts. usually 4-5 steps in people will self-sustain and I don't need to whore my alts out.

They're pretty active around the amarr/Minnie war zone.

They went from farming horde to farming in horde. 
---
Found the MCAV pilot
---
They did. They reformed as a corp and joined BL for a while. Now they're solo again.
---
Join WAFFLES today!
---
i'm not one to Judge but what sort of arsehole would steal from their own corp or alliance  though?
---
are you talking with yourself now?
---
Tbh setting up a POS back in the day pretty much would give you mental illness so this is a reasonable explanation
---
Been years since I pulled that stunt, its not as funny when you aren't a corp leader/director.  
---
everytime we hear about an alliance in trouble, we seem to have large corporate thefts and betrayals from high ranking directors.
---
The judge being the most notable in my time in EvE.
---
It was a jump bridge pos too, while I was setting that one up on my main I was doing the same thing on another character a few jumps away. Watching two mods online in the old POS system back then was pure fucking cancer. Which is what lead to me being bored.
---
'fun'
---
Not really? They're boring. The escalation gives almost zero isk and adds way more time. 
---
I'll pay you to run all pye farms

Who cares about pvp when you can just blob?

Huh, I actually saw these guys gating through TKE when I was on my way to run a site. Certainly did a double take when I saw three dreads pop up on dscan lol.
---
What is this Corp, I don’t remember hearing about them before 
---
General rule of thumb, never speak in local in a wormhole. They might not have scouts out at the time you enter. 
---
If you managed to dodge a gank in an imicus, that’s honestly pretty impressive. 
---
Most of the time gankers will be using things that make it practically impossible for you to escape, so make sure to drop the loot you collect off in hisec fairly frequently. 
---
Onlining POS. Done that myself. I understand why you broke mentally.
---
Oh damn good idea !!
---
571mil for the Raitaru Structure
---
You don't even have to fit it with defenses if you want it to be expendable.
---
If you really want to put up a fight, it'll be another 500ish-mil to fit it.
---
Then you need station services.
---
I wouldn't pay more than 3bil for a highsec Raitaru and I would never buy it from somebody else. 
---
Buy it in Jita
---
Courier contract it to desto system (and set Collateral!)
---
Fit it yourself
---
I've been doing a lot of wormholes lately (came back almost 3 months ago starting from scratch ((used extractors on an old character for the new one)).
---
1) Always bookmark the exit.
---
2) Have a plan in place incase the exit closes while you're scanning.
---
3) Profit.
---
I'm about a week away from taking an extended WH trip in a T2 cov ops frig. Dont event care where I end up, although hi sec to take my loot to safety would be nice ^^
---
Hmm. Well it's something like:
---
1. Get a fleet titan
---
2. Get a nano avatar.
---
3. Get a angel capital
---
4. Get a collection of all the subcaps in jita.
---
5. Fly a AT ship
---
6. Be the CEO of my own corporation
---
7. Get big enough to be able to join a big coalition
---
I first read it as Scam Range. =.=
---
Looks like Tranq is heading away from Serenity not towards it.
---
Oh damn good tips i did loose my first wormhole that was also fun to find lol
---
First of all where do you get 80% jita buy? :) Second it really depends on what you are mining. If you are mining Ochre for an hour the pay will be quite shit. With somewhat mixed skills and no IC T2 id say 100 m isk/h is quite a good estimate. Drone Skills do bring quite a lot for a Rorqual so you might want to train them too.
---
Can you make up your mind, is it cancer or useless?
---
&gt; be out of warp and fully decelerated before you can even see someone
---
I just assumed this was normal mechanics when I'd login my cyno alts and they'd already be 0m/s when I finally see them.
---
Make more Minmatar skins and quit pumping out Amarr skins.
---
Its like CCP looks at the skin metrics and sees that Amarr skins sell really well and Minmatar skins don't. All I'm saying is maybe its because the Minmatar skins usually look like ass (or mustard) while the Amarr skins have racing stripes and gold or metallic coloring and literal flames shooting out of the sides of the ship.
---
Playing EVE for more than a year consecutively already makes us pretty insane, so this type of behavior is quite normal on the scale of things
---
Sorry bout the MTO fight. For what it's worth:
---
* GOTG was there with Ferox and Muninns as well as an RR Hurricane fleet (that died trying to camp us in an NPC station) to whore on the Keepstar.
---
* NC. seemed to be there in Muninns (with Horde) to whore on the Keepstar and shoot GOTG.
---
* Frat had Eagles and Corms shooting anyone in range and whored on the Keepstar.
---
* PL came at the very last minute to whore on the Keepstar in Jackdaws and almost wanted to fight our Jackdaws but then Frat warped their Eagle fleet onto us so we just bounced.
---
* Siberian Squads were there with something, I dont remember what. It was assumed they were defending the Keepstar.
---
There were some small groups who tried very hard to whore on the Keepstar and lost their lives in battle. I only disconnected twice. Fight was 7/10 would fight again.
---
&gt;started to Tri to form up to dread bomb
---
booo

I actually find wormholes safer than the edges of low security space, but I usually find a wormhole in the arse hole of high sec. If you jumped into a wormhole near a trade hub, that's going to be one busy wormhole.

Countries that don't have some serious debate over how money gets spent tend to go bankrupt.

But besides the point there's no reason to make this political or nationalistic, all I did was tell you how it works over here and what's actually happening. 
---
Wow super cool, you killed three dreadnaughts with 230+ heavy assault cruisers!
---
Inb4 carrier ratting becomes the new major ISK maker.
---
Take a look at the fit and see what the going prices for it’s modules and rigs are. 
---
Other than that, it may be best to just set your own up from scratch as it rekmoves the risk of being scammed. Unless it’s a major Freeport of some kind, there is little to no extra value gained from an existing structure as opposed to placing your own, new one. Might be worth asking the guy also why he is selling it.
---
Of course if you do go the route of setting up your own, be sure to take necessary precautions and think it through thoroughly. It is entirely possible that the place you pick is ripe for aggressors. 
---
Yes that is literally me.
---
I honestly have no idea why I still play this game or what goal I am moving towards. But I’ll say I’d like to have 24/7 10 lines on both of my industrial characters. 
---
It's effective misinformation. I have a few alts that the local population firmly believe aren't anyone's alts.
---
Elo can't do anything without goons~
---
There's already a process in place for submitting (player designed) alliance logos, I say piggyback off of that.
---
Yeah, it'll probably take 3-6 months for the SKINs to be reviewed and approved, just like with logos, but that's a hell of a lot better than never.
---
If CCP is worried about seeing a bunch of Avatars with penis skins, they can retain tight(er) control by having us use a tool that lets us pick a base paint color and a couple of details from preset templates.  Think of it like the SKIN version of the corporate logo design process.
---
No, eXistence_42 is pretty much right on this one. For anything important, TRI and NCdoot are strategically allied even if no standings have been set in game. It's the same way our relationship is with goons.
---
I visited my wreck field last time and noticed there were two Catalyst wrecks there as well.  I can't recall if they were yellow.  Does anyone know, can I destroy the Cat wrecks as well without drawing a suspect flag?
---
I assume CODE has neutral alts standing by to salvage these wrecks immediately?
---
Try running a site solo and comparing.  its a very easier answer.  The loot that is multiplied as well is only the red loot not bpcs or skillbooks.

Well that's good to hear! As much fun as ~~sitting around some rocks talking for hours~~ mining can be, I was really hoping to better learn how to pew-pew. Specifically how to pew-pew against other capsuleers.

---
I just asked, thank you for explanation
---
given it was high sec, and 0.8 security... probably only a few seconds.

If you come across a NPC station you can currier contract it to Jita, explo loot is low m3.

---
oh im so sorry it was actually 75 heavy assault cruisers supported by 12 logistics cruisers and 90 tactical destroyers. narrative saved, team!
---
TIL
---
Yeah... who does this kind of shit?
---
That's how I got invited into my first corp back when I was still alpha. 
---
I was in a Heron and splashed through a hole out of Gal lowsec and came face to face with a Tengu loaded for bear. He pointed me, but I was fit to take a point and still warp. Bounced off a celestial and warped back to the hole when Mr. Tengu landed on me to continue the party. Guy was so impressed that an alpha in a T1 got away that he convo'd me and offered me a slot in the corp. And after a couple of hours when my butthole finally unclenched, I accepted.
---
Fun bunch of guys. I was the only alpha in the group, though that quickly changed. As well as being the only one that wasn't a refugee from the various null entities, and that part hasn't. Too bad the corp imploded from drama three months later, but they all know that me and my Manticore are just a batphone away whenever they need a sneaky bastard to set off some fireworks nearby.
---
So the way I've done that: generated srt(subtitles) file in excel, list of the files from Chrome file list, cut the text and add dots so it is yyyy.mm.dd not yyyymmdd and then srt generation. Image Magick might add date to each photo, I'll try to make something with that.
---
Seriously, depletion effects, aurora effects and new skins are exactly what EVE is in desperate need of right now. Bots, bugs and enriching the meta are minor issues that players don't really care about.
---
Right?
---
It's not that hard if you choose the right ship. Blobbers only use a small selection of min/maxed ships.

Can a supercarrier dock on NPC Stations? I've found some contracts on stations where they sell an supercarrier... Did CCP change that? ty
---
Tbh the dps if the ship is just so bad
---
How do you move dreads through to a c6 or c5?
---
They can't, but if a Keepstar/Sotiyo where they are docked gets destroyed, I believe they get asset safety-ed to an NPC station along with everything else. So you can undock it, but not dock back up, much like when you construct it initially in a Sotyo.

i mean at least you didn't drop supers

the reason i find it really interesting is because that corp farmed horde and was a general nuisance to them for a while. very toxic/edgelord in local to them :P
---
&gt;  I have all skills trained (besides **industrial core V** and capital industrial ships V)

that is where you are losing the most of your isk. t2 indy core gives 500% mining bonus vs the 400% bonus on the t1

How is a hauler with a festival launcher shitfit?

Thats standard on my haulers, what the fuck else are you gonna use.

You will need to do your own research. Put the program “eve isk per hour” is a good place to start. 
---
Becomes?
---
Rebecomes :P
---
Most of those are garbo tbh.
---
How would you implement this? Would you be unable to fit a PANIC and a shield booster at the same time? Seems like too much of a nerf for CCP to consider...
---
What's the point of joining a wormhole corp then?
---
You can fit a shield booster on a ship with polarized guns, same on the Rorqual, you'll just have 0% resistances but could shield boost tho. 
---
Just delete panic altogether, there is no place for ship invulnurability in eve.
---
Assuming this isn't a troll post - I find being a single person in a battle of two people is pretty good.
---
I hear some noobs put things like cloaks or tractor beams on them. 
---
Its cant fix problem of over9000 rorqs in game :(
---
Dwindling player numbers taking their toll eh?
---
Cloak yeh but why the tractor beam?
---
Noobman. Hahahaha! Nice one CCP. 
---
Hey that guy just tried to smart bomb me on a gate in low. 
---
I'd probably go about it another way.
---
"The neural stress of redirecting all ship energy from industrial to defensive use causes long-lasting trauma even once the device has burnt out"
---
Activate panic = Have an irremovable "booster" forcefully inserted into your character that gives a 75% mining yield debuff for 14 days. 
---
Well he is in smartbomb syndicate. It's his job to do that.

Why the Auto Targeting System I's on the Ishtar's?

well, commited fights in the size shown in the video do get dropped, no matter where you are

Then you would have to be able to immediately end the siege cycle.

Assuming they are a high sec mission runner who hasn’t yet discovered MTU’s it’s probably quite useful.

i come to curse next week. wait lp crashing
---
just report me if i botter, or stop talk shit
---
first you need to train logistics cruisers to 5, the difference in cap cost for your reppers is too important to pass on. depending on your doctrines, some fits will also just not work with logi 4. You also need remote armor repair systems/shield emission systems to at least 4. 5 is ideal but 4 is fine usually. other than that, the standard cap/pg ones in engineering and navigation, tank skills under armor and shields, targeting and sensor compensation

don't worry. i report u every time when u start talk shit

We stopped a snuff citadel from anchoring, their t3 fleet was very strong so ishtars forced them to shoot the drones instead of us. So many drones that we killed the cit.

They do it anyways

Am i the only one who've seen a reduction in loot from T4 Gamma sites ? except for the big loots, I've yet feel like I'm getting around 20mil ish less than usual.
---
&gt; You will need to do your own research
---
Pretty much this.  People will help with general questions, but when it comes to specifics they'll be a bit more cagey.  No one wants to give away their 'secret sauce' recipe.
---
At a bare minimum for manufacturing, you'll need to to figure out a way to calculate how much something costs to make versus how much it can sell for.  You can do this via a [variety](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Manufacturing) of [different](https://eveiph.github.io/) [places](https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/blueprint/https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/blueprint/) or just roll your own spreadsheet/software.
---
Fukin wiked epik
---
I often talk to myself. Sometimes I need an expert opinion 
---
Pretty sure that's their allies (like those fucking TIKLE blokes) that are dropping caps all over the place, just because they can 
---
More content then. Im likin it

Wow, a new Bro diving in the holes already?! Nice!

Everyone drops caps on things you shouldnt. If you cant beat em join em. I dont like it but its how it goes atm

---
I think I remember some other alliance that used to drop supers on junior FCs leading 20 man t1 cruiser gangs, but promising that they'd never drop if the alliance they were from fought. The mass supers were only there to make the ihub grinds when you didn't fight go faster, that's all they were for. Haha lol owned dropped on this guy who tried to take out 15 cormorants lmao.

And so easy to fix - nerf cynos so you can't drop capitals on any fight you feel like immediately.
---
Then delete the Capital Emergency Hull Energizer or whatever it’s called. That’s an invuln module too, getting 100% on every resistance for your hull is very very bad !
---
These would be interesting to put on the map no?

4b in cargo with cargo expanders and only need 200k m3
---
Would've asked for source if they weren't illegal
---
The only requirement for me is a c5 with a c5 static and no bad wormhole effect (best effect is red giant). After clearing all sites I'll roll the c5 static with a dread until I find a new system to move my accounts into.
---
I've been using 2 Naglfars and have died multiple times, but the money is just too insane to stop. I make around 2b/h. Insured dreads pay out decently, but it's still probably 4-5b to replace fits and ships in ur SMA. Hobocrabbing is great. I used to use an orca with a faction small pos and intensive reprocessing array , and keep a bunch of compressed ice in the orca to reprocess into strontium to run the dreads. But I eventually abandoned that and went for a more barebones strat of as little accounts as I'd need.
---
If you cant beat them because the game allows for unfun mechanics, then don't engage and play where they cant. IE Come to J-space bby :).
---
If you're interested in wormholes, look up Spoopy Newbies. Newbro friendly WH corp in Brave, can probably teach you a thing or 2!
---
If he didnt convo you after and give money to a new bro, then he's doomed. BoB demands you reimburse new bros!
---
Ah ok, I misunderstood so equipping panic module gives 0 resists across the board... I mean it would be a big nerf... A half dozen bombers would be able to break it, or a single dread... 
---
not my style of gameplay, but awesome you're enjoying it
---
eve is all about finding something you enjoy, and someone you enjoy doing it with
---
If panic lasted 16 seconds (like EHE) I don't think people would be looking to get rid of it...
---
Its 95% and only lasts for 30s, not 7 minutes. It helps dreads survive DDs which I am all for.
---
&gt; Haven't really seen them do much of anything on the map in the past year  or so and they've been mostly absent aside from a token amount of  players from TAPIs deployments.

maybe you should open your eyes then

It’s 95% iirc 99% anymore

[http://puu.sh/CCA82/02cd4a5000.png](http://puu.sh/CCA82/02cd4a5000.png) mind you this is a pretty sensible rorq refit, and if anything, tanking 100 subs is an understatement if the attackers are running something like muninns or feroxes.

It's our masterwork 200 IQ plan, get worthless krabs that have no ambition but to make isk and get toys, with no ability to really use them, even better when they have hugely inflated opinions of themselves so no one questions it.

Just fucking remove PANIC. Problem fixed.

get yourself a wh tracking app, like Eve-eye, or onto pathfinder, a web based mapper - this will tell you what class of wh you are in, and what statics that wh system has - lower class, 1-3 will have k space statics, just blip around C3s exploring until you get a hisec.
---
If they have one on standby, it only takes 2 seconds to get a fax on grid... If they need to log in an alt or phone a friend, 16 seconds is nothing
---
The Ashimmu did almost all of the work (1832231 damage), a Ashimmu does somewhere around 600 DPS, that means that fight took at least 50 minutes.
---
Stop bitching about it and move a dread bomb and try kill them.
---
cala's in snuff now tho
---
Still, that will be rare...and the counters are still the same, regional gates will just become a little less weighted in the traveller's favour. 
---
Why don’t u ask your corp mates for the skills since they know your doctrines .. it’s kinda difficult day what u have to train if we don’t know the fittings .. in general , logi 5 cap skills 5 , cruiser 5 , tank skills 5 , remote rep skills 4-5 , navigation skills 5 
---
Pretty much supporting what others have said in here.
---
Look up where your friends went, decide which group of them you want to be with most. Talk to them and see what can be done. Also ask a bit about what life there is like.
---
Once you've found a new home, reconnect with those friends! Because a lot of stuff is going to change. There will be differences, even for an industry focussed player. You're going to want to be chatting with them to help pull you through the differences. You'll need to adapt and your friends will help you through that.
---
Just seed dreads idiot 
---
That km is not fake. I was in that alliance with them. The ccp dev thought he was on test server and flew around with it. It got caught and poped. The polaris dropped and got scooped but got replaced by ccp for a plex when they noticed what happend.
---
I wasn't on about the Cockroach KM, I know that's real and I find it hilarious, I meant the whole manipulating the market with a rarely traded item to add fake worth to it, then killing a ship filled with said item :P
---
right now it isn't.  back when PL played the game and was a threat it was.
---
so you already decided to be fulltime logi and yet can't even figure out what to train on your own?

Nah, you will just spoil them this way.

Noted. Will be trying

ok. try

EHE is not invulnerability tho

My old CEO likes to claim she has ties to ccp and that they audit the corp members and tell her what to give them soooo..... yeah

Ahhh a fax trying to rep something with 0 resists is still pretty shit lol
---
The ashimmu did 1.8mil damage. He did not have every module off.

You first

My experience with catch is you guys sit docked and wait to aids form 5:1 80% of the time.

Hell while we are add it how about we just make it to where rorqual pilots just hand us their excavator drones and let us blow their ships up as soon as we come into system.

Nerf silicone. 
---
If you refine it, you will eat shit on hauling.
---
People buy and sell compressed ore because it is high density.  Uncompressed core prices are higher because no one uses that shit and some nobs have listed a few on the market to catch noobs out.  The compressed ore is cheap because that is the thing being traded, and that is the current price.
---
Mineral Prices are another thing, and they will be higher than Ore Prices because of the density issue.  Would you rather haul 40,000m3 or 1,600,000m3?
---
If you refine your ore, you are stuck hauling the minerals to a market no one will buy them at, because they will have to haul them to where they build.
---
I Think 3 Roaming dreads are not worth to meantion on reddit in 2019...

Lol no. The illustrious James 315 has updated the former blog with conscientious regularity since 2012. Some random scrub must have made the latter. Anti-gankers have historically not form corps because they are afraid of war. Also see the question from yesterday.

It was hard to have any large fight back then without 2-3 groups jumping supers from far flung corners of Eve.

 Does raising the industry index level in a system do anything other than raise ADM and give better mining sites? I.E. is it better for production?

---
This is a classic case of someone wanting to balance based on what the meanest, biggest and best organised coalition can do to defend its industrial back bone.
---
CCP has already nerfed their tanks with the inability to have more than one Ancillary.   Anyway...   
---
Raising the industry index improves the ADM and allows for mining-related iHub upgrades to be installed to improve the quality of the mining anomalies as long as it remains high. It is unrelated to the system cost index (system tax) for manufacturing. It confers no production bonuses.
---
Yeah I came across one of these in Aridia as well.

You can also teleport your exploration loot to lowsec by using player citadels in nullsec. Use the Cargo Deposit feature to deposit your loot inside, then from the asset inventory window (ALT+T), find the station (use system tab) and right click -&gt; Send items to asset safety.
---
You'll lose 15% of your loots value, and will have to wait 20 days for it to arrive. And then will have to visit that station in person to retrieve it from asset safety before you can contract it. But it can be a very useful solution in deep nullsec if there aren't many lowsec stations around, you've got a lot of loot and want to keep on exploring but don't want to risk losing a lot of valuable cargo, or have little m3 left (such as holding data site loot). 
---
Pfffffff ok
---
Everything is just time. Death is approaching with rapidity beyond your comprehension
---
&gt;maybe you should open your eyes then

Maybe you should enlighten us, what have brave done that is worth mentioning

---
Considering how many +1 year players in Brave? no. 
---
Being PC and having basic respect for your fellow human being are two different things.

The only people this will punish is people who dont have an umbrella.
---
And it's the people who dont have an umbrella who probably need more attention balance wise not a nerf to further lower their indy.
---
And I say this as a goon.
---
drone damage in the lows
---
100mn in the mids
---
add in shield extenders/damagecontrol/nanos as needed to tank the sites
---
maybe a shield recharger? idfk
---
if you're gonna post a fight with sparton fcing the least you could do is all CALSF to the alliances in the title mate
---
blessings to you my friend
---
maybe a little more specific?
---
I do know what kinds of modules that are used, but do not know how many are in the fit.
---
yeah, so go test it
---
Make it cheap.
---
Omnidirectionals x2 in low, rest DDA.
---
Med the 100mn Monoprop, uses less cap, 1 large shield extender, 1 drone nav computer and maybe a medium cap battery for being cap stable
---
High slots 1 drone link augmentor and maybe an auto target system.
---
Rigs are core field extenders for recharge.
---
Never done drone sites much, maybe you need to tweak this.
---
Fit should be around or less than 100m. Have many backups, it will die eventually. Watch out for npc dread spawns.
---
The Matari *would* be the ones to develop that
---
my thought too
---
Had neutral logi.
---
Agh i see
---
wtf 
---
never knew they didnt have any cpu... ok u win
---
That is true. The tank of Rorqs is not the only issue with nullsec right now, and to change one you have to change the others. At this point CCP probably doesn't have the balls to shake things up.
---
jesus christ rorqual pilots are fucking entitled. it's the tankiest ship in the game, is invincible for 7 minutes, and does a shit tonne of dps. they're fucking broken and the price of ore is the only proof you need. 
---
this doesn't help your case, lmao
---
At this point it's pointless to balance capitals, mining or ratting because it will negatively affect more than half of active player base who does nothing but pve. Basicly if almost everyone does it, for whom do you want to change it? 10% of player base?  Try to look from CCP perspective. Mind you, i'm saying that as solo player, this is simply different game nowadays.
---
Get over, this is new EVE. 
---
Alternative answer: Because they have trouble recruiting competent people who are willing to spend their time trying to curtail PvP in a PvP game. The EVE mechanics are biased toward enabling fights not the other way around.
---
Let's examine a potential ag candidate. He lives in highsec full time. He's got a grudge against gankers, almost certainly because he lost a ship to them at some point. That was also his first PvP experience. He probably identifies as a new player and thinks of himself as the hapless victim of cruel and unusual punishment. He's unwilling to take responsibility for his loss and hopes to salve his bruised ego by exacting revenge. In other words, he's an misguided, butthurt pleb. Who would want to be in a corp with a bunch of people like that?
---
You're gonna have a bad time in eve if you need everything soon fed to you in little pieces.

---
If you have decent programming skills, yes excel is useful, but brewing your own code will be far more profitable, in my opinion. 
---
Free pointers:
---
Nanofiber internal Structure II and Damage Control II's, by calculations I have made over the years, almost always sell at a significant profit in any decent hub, Null included.  That can be a useful place to get started learning the 'process'  (How to research, how to invention, skills needed, BPO's, the T2 components you need).  That way, at least you don't lost isk per se building them.  You aren't going to be plexing learning on these, but you aren't flushing isk down the proverbial toilet either.
---
Just forget ships for the foreseeable future.  They take a lot of time, training, you need decryptors which is a whole other level of analysis, and everyone thinks they are going to build ships.  Any given hull might be used on one doctrine and blow up a little.  DCII's die all the time across a range of ships.  Margin is one thing to consider, but volume is also an issue.
---
There are a lot of places where costs come into play.  Some websites will help you address costs, but doing it over and over again got to be tiresome for me.  Instead, I learned to pull the data from ESI and post process that, making Matlab tell me the cost of items, and what they sell for in relevant hubs.  Then, you have a list of a few high profit high margin items to target building.  
---
T2 manufacturing, knowing what I know now, I would have put it on an alt.  Separate it out from a main, and try to find a place where all your facilities are clustered.  (So a rigged refinery if you are going to mine or import compressed ore, a building location for modules, a rigged laboratory optimized for research).  Then you can leave your alt in that system/cluster and if your main deploys, you aren't losing isk not updating builds.
---
And yes, I am not perfect.  I think I have a good system, and someone else way above my pay grade will come in and say "Oh you should do this, do that...".  Lot's of ways to make isk, these are just some of my thoughts that I learned over years of doing this.

We're all schrizophrenic in a way, I like to prank my friends with my alts two like "OMG somebldy is attacking", then my main arrives like [an* hero](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/an-hero), thats why EVE let s have at least 3 chars per account, and an infinite amount of account on the same mail adress ! huehuehue
---
Hi Ianov! I've collected 90 solo kills (noting that zkill doesn't count deployables or fighters or pods as solo kills) this month so far. That's more than many players do in a year. I made it to a hundred in November but probably wont get the ton in Jan - cant be stuffed pushing for that final 10.
---
Thanks for your support of my playstyle :) I'll send you an autographed picture of my 44 kill mark current Loki hull if you want?

Hmmm, so both legacy and skill u moving supers is skirmishing.. got you cool
---
Nono i mean shooting anything that moves. If you are just gonna get awoxed by your own corp why join one?
---
If CCP would fight botting the economy issues around ratting and mining would improve things for everyone a lot better than addressing ship fit and doctrine.
---
The bots dont give a shit about invulnerability cores, they aren't using them.
---
Would like but too poor xD o7 fly safe
---
What? I agree with that guys post, while it would be great for invul to be removed it doesn't really solve the core problems with nullsec right now.

Pssshhh everybody uses Google docs now

Dude, come on. This isn't the 1980s.
---
    while (1) { print 'REEEEEE' }
---
Fully AFK VNI ratting is possible, the frigs don't do shit because they can't catch up. I set up my VNIs and leave them in the back while I keep my Rorqs in thr front, while I watch Netflix, play Path of Exile or Overwatch with 0 attention on the VNI, other than reset every 30 mins. Only deaths are to the rare Dreadnaught.
---
Essentially 4 drone damage mods, 2 drone tracking mods in the lows. Everything else is retard mode, because it's unnecessary and compromises clearspeed, therefore isk/h.
---
The meta economic monopropellant 100mn AB is mandatory in the mids, not equipping it is - again - retard mode. 10mn is just not going to cut it and frigs will shred you. Cap stability is **mandatory**.
---
The rest of the mids are up for grabs, it depends on nuance and what type of rats you're targeting, but personally I highly recommend 1 large shield extender, 1 active shield hardener for the damage type the rats are dealing (e.g. EM for Sansha), 1 drone nav computer.
---
Pop one drone range extender in the highs because we still have fitting juice and why the fuck not.
---
Rigs you fit whatever makes your cap stable and the rest is shield regen increase. With max cap and ab efficiency skills you should need no cap rigs, personally I use 2 shield purifiers (increased shield regen) and 1 cap regen rig.
---
Warp in to havens at 50, orbit at 45. Rock havens orbit point is the stargate, gas havens - the chemical laboratory with the two missile turrets. Release drones as rats start targeting. In gas havens - manually kill the turrets first, then go afk.
---
You can go fully afk, but it's preferable to check every few minutes and manually kill the frigates to save some 5 to 10 minutes per site; you do this not because the frigates are dangerous and might kill you, but because the aggro with frigs is funky and if frigs is all that is left your drones tend to sit idle and do nothing.
---
I second this. Find some modules that are used in virtually every doctrine. Damage control 2 is an amazing one that we can all probably make and still not meet demand. Just about every ship should have one fitted
---
The present

that's what the upvote button is for

---
ur dumb
---
You either die a HERO, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villian.....
---
Doncha know it's ratting *titans* now
---
Mum is this fun pvp?
---
You need max passive fit tank rattlesnakes, they will be able to clear it without worrying about losing a ship.
---
ah yes, the myriad and sundry active tanked titans
---
Are you saying compressed ore is a higher value item by volume than the minerals you get from it? That doesn't sound right to me
---
Shhh don't tell him
---
Agreed, we should go back to the time when the drone regions dropped drone poo and make that the sole source of minerals. Mineral prices were just fine back then.
---
If that was their vision, they wouldn't have given them the ability to mine at all.
---
Fuck that. I already pay CCP to play the game. I'm not gonna also pay some wanna-be online highsec mining mob boss. 
---
Not true. They want them to mine. CCP had three bullet points they wanted the industrial command ships to meet. 
---
1. Help mining fleets mine more effectively
---
2. Defend the mining operation
---
3. Contribute with powerful mining drones.
---
All of this was listed as the goal of the 2016 rorqual changes.
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/mining-foreman-revolution
---
I think what he meant is no one other than your corpmates are blue.
---
How is it relevant to anyone outside horde and that corp?
---
35 mins at 840dps which is a very all gank no tank fit so probably over an hour
---
Compressed Veldspar @ The Forge Sell Price: 1,800 isk @ 0.15 m3  
---
Veldspar @ The Forge Sell Price: 1,380 (13.8 x 100) isk @ 10.0m3 (0.1 x 100).
---
Those both have the same mineral content.  One is 50% more expensive because it is 66 times smaller.  The vast majority of uncompressed ore is noobies not knowing what to do, or scammers targeting them.
---
1 Compressed Veldspar = 100 Veldspar = 415 tritanium * Refine%  
---
At maximum refine, this is 370 tritatnium.  
---
370 Tritanium @ The Forge Sell Price: 1,661 (370 * 4.49) isk @ 3.70 m3 (0.1 * 370).
---
Thus:
---
Compressed Ore: 1,800 isk @ 0.15 m3  
---
Regular Ore: 1,380 isk @ 10.0 m3  
---
Mineral Contents: 1,661 isk @ 3.70 m3  
---
Fun for me of course :)
---
Those aren't listed in order of preference.
---
What does your post have to do with being an industrial? I only see you had problems with the social aspect, though I understand that can be daunting.
---
I've been in your boat, and it sucks but you can always find a new group. Have you considered following your friends to Goons?
---
You can only hope the next one will be the environment you like. If not, find another.
---
Ignore everyone trying to shit on your fun.  It's a sandbox game, meaning there's no wrong or right way to enjoy yourself.  I'm happy you're having fun and still logging in (the most important part)

Never said they were? It’s just a list.

All moon goo is now a type of ore. It's broken down into 5 groups now (rarity level). [https://www.eve-mogul.com/tools#/moon-ores/](https://www.eve-mogul.com/tools#/moon-ores/) this shows the values of each.

---
So what's the problem? The rorqual ITYOOL 2019 is doing all three just fine.
---
Me and my buddy's just had tanked domis with full cap batteries, with armor reps and cap transfers in the highs. We let the drones do all the work, but you have to be on the ball with your cap because those first 5 to 15 minutes that fob is gonna succa you dry.
---
z0r chains are the only real option
---
Don't need to join a corp, joining a good discord helps though. We're all pretty helpful in the EVE-Mogul discord: [https://discord.me/evemogul](https://discord.me/evemogul)
---
I haven't bothered flying in the nullblob fleets in a while tbh.  
---
I occasionally put my super in fleet or buy w.e the fotm subcap is (Mach, munnin, Ishtar, mega, apoc) be bored out of my mind then not bother for a while.  
---
I've known my CEO for the last decade+ both in game and irl. She's a good 90% of why I'm still in NC.  
---
I haven't seen another group doing this and don't believe fights of this caliber are possible in 2019's Eve.  
---
Nothing would make me happier than to be proven wrong and/or fly with said people.
---
my bad had a glitch on the phone app and it looked like you wrote the post then replied to it
---
[we could go back to using this](http://imgur.com/a/UPIPOWF)
---
Yeah, expect to pay 800m(ish) for the hull, another 800-1b each for rigs plus fit which can run from 300-400m to another bil if you're t2 fitting. Plus the service modules add up.
---
If the structure isn't reinforced, I'd recommend ship scanning it then putting it into eve-praisal. That should let you know if you're getting scammed.
---
Drone skills are maxed. And no, I was mining brilliant gneiss and stuff. 
---
Lol thats fair
---
Don't professional spies recycle their characters after they're burned?
---
Roaming won't help but you can make 100 cloaky camping alts that pay for themselves with injectors and camp their carebears till they pay you.
---
Same problem people have been saying for years now. 
---
Panic+insane tank is not good balance.
---
lol Bisu. still bitter. cucked
---
When I first started playing I joined a small, kind of shitty nullsec corp. The CEO was absolutely despised by the head of the alliance, but the guy loved the CEOs alts. Any sort of alliance fleet involved at least a 20 minute (half french) rant about how awful our CEO was and how the CEO's alt should take over.
---
As best as I can tell it started because our CEO found a capital ship on his alt and lit a cyno so the alliance head could get a kill with his titian. This was around 2010 when that sort of thing was a little less common. The CEO thought the whole thing was hilarious so he just kept kissing ass on his alt after that.
---
So argue that, instead of bringing in some unrelated nonsense?
---
they mostly bot in branch, cloaky camping is amazingly rewarding
---
Can you actually read? 
---
they also have the eoa bait beacon, which I suppose is going to go down while the strat index goes back up
---
If only CALSF had a video maker &gt;&gt;
---
Yes, can you? You're bringing out a bunch of unrelated bullshit in a weak mockery of an actual argument. "The rorqual is supposed to be this role because I said so!!!!"
---
^This
---
Reduction skills give more with each level. Like you look at the ship bonus and think, why is that 15% so important.
---
But the last point makes it from 60% to 75% reduction and you're actually using 37.5% cap less with logi 5 instead of 4.
---
This is solid advice across the board.
---
When you start up, start with things based on profit margin.  As your production expands to meet or exceed your current markets, thats where you aim for higher value markets like hulls, but that is also where the bigger fish are.
---
Ok dude. Let’s rehash this single sub thread.
---
Me: hey I’d like to see the panic balanced by allowing only 1 rorq to panic per grid at a time, they were intended to support a mining fleet
---
You: then why can they mine?
---
Me; hey here’s an article where ccp listed their vision of what they want the rorq to do
---
You: rorqs are fine
---
Me: the argument is the panic + tank is not good balance
---
You; why list unrelated opinions?? (In reference to a ccp article, which was a reply to your counterpoint of “why should rorqs be able to mine then?”
---
Me: RRREEEEEEE
---
Ffs
---
&gt;AFK VNI
---
EvE 2019
---
The thing is that you're trying to hamfist the "support role" nonsense as a justification for what you actually want. If you think PANIC is overpowered, fine. If you think rorquals can mine too much, fine. But *actually* address those points with a real argument. Writing fanfiction about how a ship was "intended" to be used is meaningless.
---
He's TAPI, reasoning with it will fail
---
not anymore
---
link a br that isn't over an astra
---
Fuck off
---
took you long enough. Btw how does it feel that most nerds in test still like me more than you?
---
Sure, ill find the BR when they went after the fed up fort 
---
Sounds like an industrialist would have plenty of work then
---
That might work depending on the response fleet from the fob
---
Quite right.
---
Market orders are full, but it says I have 0 isk total for both buy and sell orders.  Nothing is listed in My Orders, and I can't buy or sell anything.  
---
Is this a bug?  Thanks
---
there's 1 or 2 people who kill the guristas fobs regularly with those implants and the max passive rattler fit.  I just think it takes too long for the little amount of isk you get.
---
The guristas are easier than blood raiders, if he has the blood raider one it might actually be pretty simple thing. On the other hand he does want to do it as a group with his corp mates.
---
I think you mean World War Bee.
---
you're a bitter, toxic shitter, always will be, a shit pvper, a shit killboard .. generally just shit. have a nice life
---
Hi.
---
Panic is overpowered. As a suggestion, we should discuss having only 1 panic be activated per grid at a time.
---
This would meet CCPs original design idea for the role of the industrial command ship (as a support command role), and would introduce more risk when multiple rorquals are on grid, or mitigated by spreading rorqs out across multiple anoms.
---
Let’s discuss counterpoints to this argument and not go off on tangents about some other nonsense and discuss the original comment. 
---
Is this more clear? It was you that derailed this conversation with nonsense.
---
I'm honestly impressed it took people this long to tell you who you were talking too. How does it feel that your alliance banned you from "serious business" discords becuase of how hard you got hazed?
---
Nope. You're *still* trying to logjam nonsense about "CCPs original design idea" for a ship. The fact that the rorqual can mine a lot does not diminish its other aspects. Why can't you let this specious argument go?
---
Corp Prices are more ;) pokes rollo with a stick! 
---
so not all of them then.. 
---
MBC dissolved in 2015 
---
:ok-hand:
---
That's something CCP said you Pepega, back from 2016, not his personal opinion, what was stated when the ship was re-designed, by the people who re-designed it.
---
But you also always lose tho. 
---
We used to have a guy who would RP convos between his male and female alts. He was... quite the character. I also know people who go to lengths to hide their alts so they act like they're someone else's toon outside of private discussions. 
---
TEST, a bunch of dipshits ruled over with even bigger dipshits
---
added CALSF to the youtube title because &lt;3 you guys  
---
reddit won't let me edit the title of the post tho sorry
---
&gt;little pressure
---
Took just the biggest super capital force on their porch for weeks.
---
I'm sorry that your mantra didn't past muster. Truly, arguing with one's feelings is fraught with peril.
---
I was never banned from any Discords, shitter. Try again. 
---
The same principles apply whatever class you're looking for - you want a hole with sites to run (obviously), few connections and no active locals.
---
Most people will run the sites in their own home, but they don't spawn very often, so that's why you need to farm statics.
---
I’m so triggered right now. I’m going to complain to all my friends and seek their confirmation bias and have them all downvote you to make me feel good about this!
---
You hurt my feelings and I need to find a safe space to hide in.
---
It's something they said, but he's interpreting it through his own distorted lens. The fact that a rorqual can mine well, perhaps too well, doesn't mean that it somehow loses the ability to be a support ship as well.
---
Sounds like something that an alt right nazi would say 
---
Oh shit it's Querns 
---
*grabs bag of downvotes*
---
and i trust this BR will have supers on it or some ships that would designate it as "not a skirmish" 
---
Like, is this supposed to be some sort of dig at me? It's not like anyone on my side of the table gives half a shit about what I post.
---
Truly, I shall be slain by the force of the fake internet points being applied in a particular direction.
---
"his own distorted lens", Dude, it's an opinion. Everyone has their own unique distorted lens that everyone views the world in and how it should operate. And by discussing and debating with these opinions, we can come up with ideas that are over-all better than any one vision could be.
---
I’ll say this slowly so u can understand it. 
---
If you are hostile and don’t like us dropping on you. Move a dread bomb into range of catch and drop...
---
So where the fuck are u going to seed dreads ? 
---
Blood will use his mouth to find it. 
---
Sure; I'm saying his opinion is wet garbage from a smelly dumpster.
---
Those are the best. We had a c5 open to a static c5 which opened back into our home hole. Queue 3 dreads balling through holes to get a new chain. 
---
Tells who it is brav!
---
Oh deer
---
Nothing there is illegal, though the drunken loli DRF is cutting it close I guess. 
---
Source is a very mixed bag, it's from all over the place. 
---
Now with more memes. 
---
I just wanted to emphasize my upvote with a more personal statement, I don't like how unpersonal the system itself is.
---
I wonder how the deer got the job in IT...
---
That's the next level up apparently.
---
I gotta step up my multiboxing
---
Yeah I agree with you, hostiles should just seed hundreds of dreads like TEST did in oijanen to easily kill supers... Oh... Shit
---
There's always a Reynolds on comms...
---
while backed by the second biggest supercapital force
---
it was pressure, absolutely, but at the end of the day they weren't up to the fight and just wanted to krab and keep their space
---
Didn't pay to extend the software licence on the botting program 
---
Eve updates would be one thing to add indeed, like when moons were reshuffled, the moon changes to active moon mining, and the change from POS sov mechanics to the other thing, then to fozziesov. 
---
Another few points of importance would be the BoB disbanding (you see it on the map but it would be nice if it slowed down a bit right around there so we can see the details of what happened just after it). And a few other such important events (I'm no expert on all those events). 
---
Jump changes would also be an important update (both of them, both the introduction of jump fatigue but also the new 5 hour cap on jump fatigue). 
---
It would also be interesting to see some of the MER data in the last few years, represented on the map easily somehow. 
---
The sov map looked something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/aYHo8nv.jpg). Dominion sov, longer jump ranges, and no jump fatigue meant that NCPL could run a rental empire that spanned half of the map. The CFC ran the other half. 
---
Yep lol test fed, just Like PL in UALX. 
---
Brave dojo YouTube channel has some recent classes.
---
Might be more expensive for ya. Should get better deals 
---
Sys Admin
---
Wow pl fed too, that's completely shocking to me. It's almost as if anyone who uses the 'just seed dreads' line is retarded. 
---
lmao if you think "players forming a proper industry" is what is making them easier to manufacture, versus the fact that the amount of minerals/ISK in EVE is increasing by 10-20% a *month* (based off the entire 10+ year lifetime of eve)
---
This post is shit, not a shit post.
---
best VNI fit is a ratting carrier - Eve 2019
---
imagine paying 55b for a titan hull in 2k19
---
I mean the last time PL played the game was in 2017 according to reddit, so brave have just been doing nothing for a year+ by your own admission 
---
oh deer god what are you doing in my server room
---
worse than one of my posts and that's pretty hard to do. gj
---
As always, I’ll plug my app so you don’t need to do a spreadsheet if you don’t want: http://eveiph.github.io/
---
mining was more profitable to smaller miners back then,  compared to larger miners have most profit.
---
was honestly less safe to mine or rat back then, as you didnt have dockable stations in every system.  and mining barges arent as durable as present day orcas
---
pvp was more about roaming, so spies would be essential along with intel to make your roam meet their roam. compared to now where its more about defending one of the many citadels.   nowadays roams just dock up at a local citadel if a big force is cutting them off....
---
dreadnoughts were more valuable(imo) as they were a way to quickly destroy(or reinforce) POS towers as you clear out alot of them.   plus the classic dread bomb.
---
while now, they just not worth putting as siege ships as citadels got dmg caps.  so they just for dread bombs and the occasional haw.
---
carriers added a whole new playstyle due to extreme lock range and fighter range vs their old drone boat.   not sure i like or dislike this.  its new, but i still miss 15 drones.
---
and on and on.
---
honestly, i think i prefered it before citadels.  as citadels made it to easy to "escape" combat,   and citadels are so cheap and spammable that its hardly worth the effort and time to kill them,  vs the old POS where drop a few super carriers(mother ships) or a titan,  blast away at it, move to the next.  come back next 24-36 hours and finish it off.   fast, simple,  no sitting there waiting for dmg cap to let you finish it.
---
and no fuel = POS dies with no reinforce.
---
So is more broken up into smaller groups now?
---
I found the elusive complete ship balanced patch, CATCH IT
---
Same as everyone else: It gave up on life.
---
&gt; pvp was more about roaming, so spies would be essential along with intel to make your roam meet their roam. compared to now where its more about defending one of the many citadels. nowadays roams just dock up at a local citadel if a big force is cutting them off....
---
That is disappointing to hear.   Roaming PvP to just see what you could find was my favorite part of the game
---
just have some refits ready
---
Dont let him tell you that doesnt exist either, Im in a wh corp and we take roams to nullsec every day and kill stuff.
---
don't get me wrong. still some roams,  but its less common and when your roam gets tackled by a counter, its far easier to get away and just gf as you leave.
---
The most disappointing thing to me is how loss matters less and less nowadays. When I started 8 years ago, the perma-loss aspect of EVE was incredibly unique and interesting to me, nowadays Caps can be welped like BS and half a dozen dead Titans get replaced in less than a week.
---
Big losses used to hurt and have consequences, now even Supers and Titans are becomming more and more disposable.
---
False; true, raw Goons are all in [Ten Dollar Bond.](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/corp/Ten_Dollar_Bond)
---
1.8million RAW damage, before resists are calculated.
---
Why is it so much easier to replace them now?
---
But are you encountering other PvP roams or are you just killing ratters you ambush?
---
Well, time to get to work.
---
Those deer ribs ain't gonna make themselves.
---
CCP misunderstood that servers are dear.....
---
Thank you, this is very helpful.
---
Occulus Rifts is the corp name. Message Abrams Jasen in game and he will get you sorted 
---
Totally unrelated but that username is such a rollercoaster.
---
Plex in cargo
---
Didn't we already basically have that with the Avatar's shipmodel?
---
rorqs mine like mad
---
people are skilled enough to do the most profitable stuff reliably
---
everyone knows what is profitable and how much isk/time it takes.
---
in short, people learned the spreadsheets.   
---
Both, we run into little fleets all the time.
---
good to hear
---
thanks
---
I think I'm missing a joke, who is that?
---
Thats not fair. Some of us were also masochists first.
---
Enormous (skill-injected) Rorqual fleets and ubiquitous Supercap ratting provide both large amount of cheap minerals and liquid ISK. Plus the coffers of the big alliances have only grown over the years.
---
You have no eye deer !!!
---
Well shit thats a long ass time then
---
You are absolutely right and I will support your statement with the following:
---
Nunc condimentum ipsum quis tempor pharetra. Praesent sollicitudin elit nec erat dignissim, non ornare leo euismod. In a dui a tortor sodales pharetra. Ut scelerisque in dui in rhoncus.

---
So we're just taking content off the front page and putting an eve related title on it to post here now? jesus bob.
---
Fake news. Brave doesn't have any supers.
---
Show me your lossmail to a rorq and where it hurt
---
small gang fights where you take on higher numbers than yourself are certainly still possible - you are forced into kiting more than just facetanking, though, because of the amount of capitals around
---
but if you think no one is getting great smallgang content then you definitely have not looked
---
every day we stray further away from god's light
---
Those we're the days of off-grid command bursts and before excavator drones.
---
You don't "rent server rooms" at AWS.
---
Not smaller,no. Still several large coalitions with a couple medium size entities claiming they are *independent and don't need no man*.
---
Its posts like this that remind me that things can be worse than countless ccpls posts in this sub.
---
"Leader person" LOL
---
yeah that seems to be what happened. we did t4s last night but popped on a 3 starving vedmak spawn lol. that spawn seems to be the hardest

Join Horde! We have a pretty dedicated wing of Logibeans to keep our Dangerousbeans Alivebeans. Also, we like beans. Do you speak french? You could join Frenchbeans. Like industry? Join the Industrialbeans. We've got Freshbeans, Seabeans, Parmesanbeans. Join horde, and be a bean. :)
---
Nope, those implants come from Serpents Inquest, as noted in their description.
---
Shield slaves will be coming from Sansha.
---
This is something else. 
---
In terms of territory controlled, yes. In terms of relative power, probably not. 
---
local worked

However you should be mindful that a neutral does not steal it while doing so, or you will get memed.

Probably deer was in charge of cable management. 
---
I don't play the game anymore, but when I return back I plan to revive my old corp. That means literally that - getting into lowsec/nullsec with a bunch of new people and maybe some bittervets, tagging around, killing people and get killed, and after some time maybe get back into null (and as a CEO, into null politics). And I am fairly sure I can do that, providing I'll spend enough time (re)building the corp. It's not a rocket science, those spaceships are just virtual.

Granted, I already have the experience with the low, null and even with the null politics, so I know what to expect. But at the beginning I didn't know much.
---
When I started, my goal was to build a lowsec mining/fighting corporation. I didn't know that *it's not possible to build a newbie corporation in lowsec*. So I went to LS and built a corp, right next to the factional warfare area - and we lived there happily for months until I made a couple of newbie CEO mistakes which were not related to the lowsec or any batphoning or whatever.
---
You don't need to wait. You literally can just log in and start now:
---
1) Have a plan, be ready to adjust that plan according  the reality.
---
2) Learn what kind of threats your corp can suffer and how to protect your corp.
---
3) Recruit, delegate, so that you don't burn out.
---
4) Live your EVE life, when you are ready and the corp agrees, move to the null.
---
Or, alternatively:
---
1) Keep complaining how X can't be done, watch other corps happily doing X .
---
That cabling is a mess. 
---
&gt; as I’m not making enough money to actually go anywhere 
---
You know you can join a lot of newbie nullsec corporations literally in your Velator?
---
My ultimate goal is to find a reason to return back to EVE. I miss my peeps but the game is now shite.
---
Lore wise its an easy fix, just have it where it requires 90% cap to activate and once used it can regen cap until 15 minutes after panic button used, numbers can always be changed.
---
Considering pretty much the entirety of 0.0 is NBSI, a corp switching alliances would be very important information to anyone in that area to have warning that someone who was formerly blue to them could have become neutral depending on their affiliations. 
---
&gt;everything dies. There are no rules and no one is blue.
---
The impression i get is that you shoot anything that moves. Nothing is blue so you shoot everyone.
---
In what way does it not work now?
---
I couldn't help it but those cables are all messy and need some work.
---
its almost as if that is how memes work.....
---
EVE Uni has an industrial/mining campus based in Amarr which could certainly be a good place to learn and get your feet wet in that area of EVE. You're also not just limited to the one campus, you can come and go to experience many different parts of the game.
---
Its not needed and cancerous.
---
Server room has been commandeered by the wild life it seems.
---
Goonswarm stopped being "goons" a long time ago, when Mittani took over. 
---
Search for DJ and the stories behind him 
---
You'd have to log in almost everyday anyways cuz you have the 1 Day queue cap on skill training.
---
It's just power creep, really. You really think you'd be having more fun 10 years ago having to rat for an hour to fit a t1 frigate to PvP with than you do today ratting for an hour to fit a faction cruiser?
---
You're right that losing X ship today is less meaningful than losing X ship was 5 years ago. But losing Y hours of krab time when you get popped is the same 5 years ago as today. It's just that the Y hours buys you a bigger ship today.
---
&gt;and no fuel = POS dies with no reinforce.
---
Pls give this for citadels k thx bye 
---
I dont want to say this is normal, but it's definitely common.  Got a dude in my alliance who acts like his alts are different people and tries to speak "in character" for each one.  
---
Also had a dude complain to my FW alt that I ran away and to come back and let his "girlfriend" kill me.  I said he can kill me all he wants after I finished the site.  He agreed, I went back, he popped me instantly, then called me a faggot.  I asked his corpmates in the system how they felt about him role playing his alts to be bf and gf but they all left before responding.
---
Blue represents allies because of the standings system ... corp mates aren't even blue, they have a green icon.
---
agreed, and agreed.
---
or at the very least no dmg cap on low power
---
Yeah, mate, lets ask for numbers that cannot exist so I can reject everything!
---
There is no reason to give a garmur or recon a longer scram. I see no situation where this can improve the game.
---
The day after those new triglavian ships appeared, I took a vexor to do a t1 filament, wanting to learn this new method of pve. Got a bunch of pretty inexpensive stuff like the books. However, in the last room a triglavian destroyer book dropped. Didn't even know how much that cost at that time. Later managed to sell for almost 1bil!!!
---

---
A lot of ships were shooting other ships and some other ships were trying to not let them die.
---
Bitter? I‘m sorry. Hope you find joy somewhere else in life. 
---
I was hoping for something more precise but thanks! 
---
I think we should TBH 
---
@eva fix it
---
&gt; You are absolutely right and I will support your statement with the following
---
Tsk tsk tsk, you forgot to cite [your source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum)
---
Yeah but abysalls you can spam all day every day. Dread ratting you may be able to do a few times a week
---
This is the best reply in this thread.
---
Wasn't my kind of play either, but if it's what you enjoy, stick at it.
---
okay.
---
&gt; ask for numbers that cannot exist 
---
Is basic math that hard for you? Here's a free math lesson. 
---
To get a percentage increase in a number multiply it by 1 plus the decimal value of the percent, so for example a 4% bonus would be 1.04 multiplied by the range of modules after the implant has been plugged in. 
---
Now using this newly found knowledge, you can open up pyfa or EFT and figure out what the ranges of scrams and webs would be with these implants plugged in. 
---
Good to know. Cheers.
---
I'm black; what is this?
---
I mean corps that will buy FW items from you so that you don’t have to personally sell them on the market
---
Some random rat my first or second week playing and I got a Dramiel BPC, maybe 40m at the time? I felt like a RL billionaire 
---
Looking for another corp? I joined Stranger Danger recently and its a fun group to fly with. 
---
[https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99005896/](https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99005896/)
---
Congrats, you have won this thread.
---
Cheeeeerfuckenzah!
---
Lol wat? That's some dumbass propaganda... less specifics, more memes...
---
&gt; usually they gone by the time the rescue fleet arrives
---
IME, the assumption is every capital has a cyno fit, so we're always ready to leave the instant they bring in four (or forty) supers.  To do otherwise is to plan to feed bigtime.
---
I mean, if even not for the direct shooting at the thing, I loved flying between POSes and topping them up with fuel when I had nothing else to do.  Lots of situational awareness required, you couldn't just jump on top of the thing so scouting was a must, etc.
---
Now not everything needs fuel, there's no hauling stront out with a fleet to do a POS save, and you can jump a hauler right on the thing that needs fuel, and instadock.
---
Those are the numbers available, so there is no point in asking for them. Surely you cannot be that dumb?
---
They really just need to delete small citadels.  The cost is too low compared to the effort required to kill them.
---
Removing the damage cap from smalls might work as well.
---
High-grade Slave Delta from a belt rat in null. Sold it for like 350mil, which compared to my income as a newbie belt ratting was insane.
---
That deer should be wearing their security badge. It's against data center protocol to not wear it. So irresponsible.
---
That's how that implant made me feel lol I was still relatively new, at the time, and perpetually poor. 
---
Needless to say, I saw that "40,000,000 isk" and promptly (and with a healthy amount of paranoia) flew to Dodixie to sell it. Felt like I struck it huge.
---
Now, I'm so Jaded by DED sites that a 40mil drop is profoundly "meh."
---
CCP Doe
---
true.  and usually the ones being caught are bots so....no real loss if they die
---
I'm a pretty new player and read that station trading could be profitable. Now I've tried this for a couple of hours in Jita 4/4 and have to say its pretty annoying to see 10 guys 0.01 isking almost every sell order I try within a few minutes. Sometimes an order is updated 5 secs after I updated my price. 
---
Any ideas are welcome on what I should improve :)
---
That first "big drop" was such a sweet feeling.
---
&gt;expecting redditors to make sense or be consistent 
---
New around these parts I see
---
CCP changed out their chat infrastructure and it's ... less than reliable.
---
Most of the time, the people in local are, in fact, the people in system.  Some of the time, certain individual people don't show up because something went screwy somewhere.  Some of the time, a person will be seeing the wrong local for the system they are actually in.  And of late, we've seen some incidents where the list in local just gives up the ghost and you can wander around freely without showing up in local (during which the number of ratter losses on zkillboard skyrockets).
---
As someone who really enjoys active carrier ratting you can't really compare it to afk VNI ratting. You cannot do shit else while carrier ratting, you have to mash buttons so fast you have no time for anything else. You will lose fighters hand over fist if you don't keep them moving constantly. VNI ratting you don't do shit, you can read or do anything else you want.
---
I prefer carrier ratting because I like to be really active and engaged while playing the game, but if you multibox or want to focus on some other things ingame VNI ratting does not require much attention.
---
No i-deer
---
Not just the first really. I do a lot of exploration and when you stumble on a 125mil relic site can after a dry spell it feels so good.
---
That equipment looks deer
---
This guy dinoposts
---
You're the one bitching about how cancerous these implants are, meanwhile you cannot even post what the new ranges are. 
---
You are the dumb ass here who cannot even understand just how trivial 4% increase actually is on bonused hulls so you cry **CANCER CANCER** because basic math is beyond your abilities.
---
this
---
It’s not a deer... it’s Hilmar’s patronus.
---
\&gt;  i will be ready !!!   
---
oh, friend, no... you won't be. but go do it anyway ;)
---
You'd think that the module tiericide would be over by now. That was one thing that I was most excited about when I started playing 5 years ago.
---
I play with four alts at the same time... I refer to them as “us.” ... yeah 
---
i know this is just a meme shitpost but I am a professional AWS toucher and tbh i really doubt its amazon's tech that is letting CCP down - you can set up all kinds of crazy redundant and load balanced operations - I have built and maintained stuff that has 99.999% average uptime.  And honestly even if the software is shit and crashes every half hour, you can honestly compensate for that by having redundant server resources and automated crash recovery, etc.  It seems like their AWS people dont know their ass from their elbows, which is fairly common cause its a new field and nobody knows how to test new AWS employees worth a shit
---
So I did receive reimbursement yesterday, but it was only the modules which did not drop (which sorta makes no sense cause it was in the abyss and nothing is recoverable, but I understand that's how reimbursements work). I was slightly ticked because I lost a faction ADCU, battery, and A-type repper, but overall I'm grateful to CCP for the way they handled this, because I got the ship back (and it's t2 rigs) plus it still has it's A-type AB and Dark Blood Web.
---
Its gotten exponentially worse
---
They are unneeded and cancerous. There is no point in adding them to the game. You dont understand that. You are dumb.
---
This video gets real at 4min 30sec  
---
God bless Joecuster
---
also corp or alliance mark on ships like citadels
---
it can be profitable but in my experience it involved too much of exactly that. IMO it's too dry and tedious.
---
Why why why.
---
I just want coloured neocom icons back. Don't move icons from where they are now, just change them back to how they used to be coloured. Monochrome is awful for a list of buttons you are meant to recognise at a glance. Such bad design.
---
Or at least make it an option in the settings menu 
---
Oohhh now i really want to go lol
---
Because they want to hear all the tears and complaints about "I try to go into the Industry section, but I keep clicking on the Map instead."
---
NPC Titan spawn last week, dropped a CONCORD BPC that sold for 700 mill. 
---
I forgot to reply to this when I saw it, but you had some points I wanted to talk about.  
---
I agree that the majority of subcapital fleets have tons of play and counterplay, but we also just had a recent patch to remove the 'insta-warp-alpha-ceptor' ship concept, even though it remains in some form still.
---
There is also very little counter play against well executed specialized ships, like Command Destroyers, 7300 scan-rez hyperlockers, smartbombing T3C/BS, smartboming/boson titans, 4,500 m/s+ sniper kiters.
---
You, like most people, have mistaken my argument for some kind of PVE based argument.  It is not, and I don't mine, and I don't rat.  You can see this flawed logic in your post "if they leave, it worked".  Titans make people leave pretty fucking fast, so does no targets.  
---
I feel like your entire premise is founded on a 'fleet of cruisers or battlecruisers out for fun', and not the reality of 'tri hard butthurt pvper trying to prove a point with 1bn isk frigates' fleets.
---
Anyone taking out a cruiser fleet or higher is looking for a fight, and they will probably find one.  These fleets are plenty durable against a carrier if they have any sort of logistics, be it spider RR or dual/tripple logi.
---
Your idea of a hunter group does not even exist in modern even because those ships are bad and powercreep has ruled them out.  The prospect is a better hunter ship than 90% of hulls out there.  A stealth bomber is a better dps ship for ganks than 80% of hulls.
---
When was the last time you saw an un-ironic T1 cruiser fleet anywhere that wasn't just out for fighting anything that took it on?
---
pb is such shit space. lmfao
---
gons did destroy the game. whats ur point lol?
---
The larger groups are a bit more contained than they used to be, making room for *a couple* more medium to large entities.
---
Basically we're at ~5-8 large to medium powers instead of two.
---
(Goons, TEST/Legacy), (PL/NC, GotG, Horde), Fraternity, Triumvirate
---
Goons, TEST, and Legacy make up The South.
---
NC/PL/GotG/Horde make up The North.
---
Fraternity are in the east and recently hosted The North for an invasion of Legacy/TEST.  With the help of goons, that invasion was *thoroughly* repelled, including having the north's entire super fleet trapped in anchored bubbles for a week.

this is what peek elite pvp looks like

Tomorrow is the 5 year anniversary of B-R5RB, so at the time the Holloween war was wrapping up. N3 and CFC split all the non-drone regions space between them and if you wanted to live in nullsec and didn't want to work for the russians or provi you pretty much had to choose between those two. 
---
Using caps was much different, you couldn't really use any if you weren't one of the big boys.  Caps had no jump fatigue, so could make as any jumps in a row as they had fuel for. If a group with a decent number of caps caught wind of a fight on the other side of the galaxy they wanted in on, they could have there entire fleet there in minutes. So if you didn't have enough caps yourself to act like a nuclear deterrent, you had to be very careful about how and when you used them.
---
Regions could be burned down in way less time than today. There was no damage cap on structures so a mass of supercaps could flip stations or tear down POSes in minutes.
---
I started playing just after B-R and was living in Rens for a while. That trade hub specifically has gone downhill a lot. It used to be really active in a fun way rather than a Jita spammy way. People would help out newbies and haggle on prices in local, there would always be people trying to one up each other dueling on the undock, and you could get anything you wanted at pretty much Jita prices, sometimes cheaper. At a certain time of day local would just switch to russian. Now I'd hesitate to call it a major trade hub and that's sad :(
---
somehow i never even knew the passive targeter was a thing
---
I feel like a deer would've done a better job.... I might need to send Amazon a wire comb and some rip-tie...
---
Looks like they’ll find Hillary’s emails in there. :-)
---
co2 and horde did most of the work when goons deployed, and NC the supercap stuff, GOTG only had to deal with a SIG for a few months and did literally nothing once goons deployed. Co2 formed bigger than GOTG with 1/10 their numbers
---
Woah really I'm the highest so far ? Unstable web mutaplasmid, sold for 1.2B a few days after into the abyss release.
---
How are they cancerous? Go do the basic math and see just how 'cancerous' they are. 
---
You fucking idiot. Its not about the math (nor is it a problem). Its about them being unneeded and solving no problems in terms of game balance. What you likely get is a slightly more cancerous garmur or recon or whatever else has a scram bonus.
---
Its on you or whoever wants to argue this is a good addition to show the problems this solves.
---
So that's what's been undeermining the servers.
---
http://www.zkillboard.com
---
Do you remember when they changed it? They stated they had research that showed you learn ui faster when monochrome or something of that nature.I think it was all bs, I still struggle occasionally to search the right icons, mostly when drunk and high. Think they took that into consideration with their research?
---
Title had me thinking something else
---
...HERO
---
"Cindy!  Get back to work!"
---
Everyone knows the servers are run by ferrets not dears
---
Excavs and panic were both part of the same update.
---
Pretty lame shit. 
---
Tri will never Failscade, We have to many members who care about who we are and what we stand for to let anyone Hit the Delete key on us!
---
I see people bringing up "Ohh x corp left the alliance" and "oh u fucked over that dude" literally not knowing wtf they are saying only spewing out roomers they here without the full story..... Tri will not failscade even now as we are fighting outmatched numbers we are still doing what we need to do.
---
I like to look at things from a surprising perspective, A Goonswarm perspective.... If 90% of eve can pound an alliance the size of goonswarm literally making them outnumberd worse then we are now and they are still in game. Seriously Tri has fuck all to worry about.
---
Now get back to your mining you cheeky shit's
---
They'll do anything to make a buck.
---
Attitudes like this is why 'EvE is dying'.   
---
Get over your ego. 
---
Yesterday I did a lowsec combat site and got an 80 mil implant at the end. Got the fuck out of dodge after that
---
Is there a cheapest system to buy SI's in game? Near Rens it costs around 900m but i'd be willing to travel to save a few dozen mill if its cheaper elsewhere. Thnx
---
Damn I wish I had this kind of production quality 😫 or a big strong man like joecuster to tuck me in at night 
---
Yes, they reduced it recently.
---
Without excavators they still wouldn't.
---
Rorqual 1:0 FW small gang gagsters.
---
Ya know, to be honest i'm done asking around. I was interested in potentially getting into wormholing (which is why i was asking to begin with) but literally every single thing i've read or person i've talked to has been overwhelmingly hostile. So i'm probably just gonna stay out.
---
There's a world of difference between Goons in this game and Goons on the rest of the internet. Similar origins and a lot of the same humor I guess, but Goons here are doing their own thing and have been for a long time.
---
^(FYAD FYAD LOL)
---
u can have me 
---
Fuckin yikes. The folks who have 1.2bil to just throw around willy-nilly confound me.
---
My theory is that he was bullshitting and was never the owner of any significant number of bots, and therefore didn't impact the market at all
---
A high grade ascendency omega implant blueprint that dropped from a data site I think it was. I built it and sold it for 6 bil
---
There are only a few dozen people still playing the game that are good enough to consistently succeed in small gang beyond just ganking shit. The meta has pushed the skill/isk floor so high it's incredibly discouraging to anyone trying to learn.
---
This is a ridiculously silly reason. Eve has gotten along just fine without posts every time a corp switches *allegiances*... 
---
Obviously reddit is a uniform entity.
---
Starpirateaji of Borg.
---
Imagine throwing 1M at some item on the market.  That's what 1B is for some people.
---
you get scrambled 
---
This is a Ranger Regiment structure btw.
---
You missed the most important aspect and that is the guns are independent of the ship. So the ship can still apply damage on a target it has burned hundreds of km from, as well as gain high transversal with no loss of dps application. So it is very good on stuff like structure grids and against stuff with shitty tracking.
---
Deer Team,

---
Hey, it's a group of people who are actually aware of the fact that asset safety is only partial in k-space.
---
&gt; this is a good addition 
---
Given it's likely going to be an additional ISK sink into the game, that on it's own is a good enough reason to me for implementing it since it doesn't negatively affect the game in any drastic manner.
---
Yeah this is stupid. Rearranging the things under the popout menu is kind of fair enough if you want to put new things in there, but the sidebar shouldn't get touched. People have muscle memory for where the button they want is and you need a really good reason to change that.
---
We don't want Agency right up near the top.
---
Meh, when there are zero changes to the original vid, it's just a repost.
---
*Time, Dr. Freeman?*
---
What about the gate from lowsec to Stain?
---
Progression in this game is not your character build but what you're doing.
---
*was
---
How many dsts will it take to move all that?
---
\&gt;  why would you do that 
---
Because their UI people don't know what an awful idea is until they try it and we point it out. BONG.
---
I appreciate the response. There were methods to still find people in the game without local in Wurm too, it's a medieval thing with spells and shit so you'd spin this pendulum on a chain and it pointed to where someone might be. That was the core argument to 'local isn't needed', but in reality after it was tried and tested it only worked as an addition to local. Running around clicking to spin it literally constantly proved to not be a workable mechanic nor practical. I think that can be a parallel argument with local and d-scan/probes in EVE.
---
*shoots GOTG out of that  (  )   *
---
AAR: Raitaru got shot, Raitaru popped, loot dropped.
---
you aren't big and stronk though :C
---
local stopps working time to time now.  CCP cant fix so they said if they cant find a solution soon, they will return it to old code
---
:tenbux:
---
for all that to drop, it had to be stuff in construction, right? or can it just be sitting around in corp hangar
---
Weird flex but okay
---
Yeah. I can't wrap my head around that.
---
Your no longer a threat, no one can make you quit a game that's bad for everyone eve needs more players not less. But your ability to wage war has been destroyed.
---
welcome to r/eve, where low tier posts happen a lot. 
---
tldr some dudes rf'd a raitaru with an altcorp, suddenly ranger regiment allied in the war.
---
GSF declared war, a few feroxi later the raitaru was dead (lol)
---
Hot DAMN. I need to start doing data sites...
---
Correct. If the structure isn't in w-space, only the input materials for items still being built, or the finished items if they're still awaiting delivery, will drop from structures (including blueprint copies, but not blueprint originals).
---
TRI is the only independent alliance in the game, what are you going to do about it? We always fight outnumbered. 
---
I think some people are missing a gigantic fucking change, and I didn't ready any replies at all per normal redditing so maybe someone said it too, people and null-sec chains are actually using capitals all the time. 5 years ago that WAS NOT the case.
---
I still mix up People and Places and Fittings all the damn time.
---
hahahaha
---
Holding grid or consistently getting out with kills and without losses is one way to succeed as a small group, but, as you say, the personal, SP, and isk requirements are pretty tough to meet. Small groups can also have a different type of "success" by just having a healthy tolerance for loss - flying cheap-ish and taking dumb-on-paper fights can still win you lots of BRs, even if your fleet is going to eventually get wiped out. 
---
Skill injected rorquals.
---
#They didn't want to donate to lowsec gate to Stain fund.               
---
Like for real. 
---
Confirmed: goons highsec alliance.
---
....it would help if it was ADC (Another Data Center) instead of AWS...
---
....and dust booties.
---
Completely disagree. Scram is one of the "strongest" EWs in the game. Making changes here should be a last resort. If they are looking for some kind of extra isk sink, this would not be the way to do it.
---
If you dont already understand why a Garmur is cancerous, there is no need for me to waste time.
---
Sorry, but it is basic reasoning skills to deduce that free to play pulls in a lot of players.  Even shit F2P games get a ton of players because hey, its free!
---
smalls should have 1 reinforce timer 24-36 away, and that's it
---
fuel = no timer
---
remove all damage caps
---
This is  how EVE works
---
Same with an 8m+ data site.
---
Don't feel too bad. I've been on and off the game for maybe 4 years and lost all fights - never a single victory. I don't play anymore though.
---
I warped to a random hangar container in my Prowler since Hole Control stole my fortizar kill, opened it, clicked loot all, and scooped 20 bill.
---
Legit already replace....however this was me when i swapped screens from fleet to look at the rorqs: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyU1a4c1Tdk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyU1a4c1Tdk)

wtf?

/u/ccp_falcon i beg you DO NOT change the neocom layout.
---
Its fine the way it is and relearing it would take FOR EVER.^
---
Obligatory REEEEEEE change
---
WTS Fit Rorqual, excavators not included
---
Nah, they are more like [Beaster]([Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/sg9qQuN.png)) now.
---
Up until they fought that war with RED (funded by that oil tycoon) they had clout.
---
not even mad dudes... job well done.
---
I felt a great disturbance in the force, as if dozens of mining drones suddenly cried out in terror, and were suddenly silenced. I feel something terrible has happened
---
How’s Brave doing these days? 
---
I haven’t played in 4-5 years either and I can’t get a firm grasp on how Brave’s been doing since I started winning Eve.
---
Looks like goons are trying out new ways to mine without rorquals.
---
&gt;FYAD FYAD LOL
---
?
---
DAYUM!
---
where are the hamsters
---
thats why we need a wall
---
when you need help from goons -1 Bitch move but im sure they had fun
---
Proviboi 
---
good has happened\*
---
Rofl better poor another cup of koolaid
---
This thing is ridiculous please STOP mucking up the UI. STAHP.
---
OR give us customization options so we can revert it (and while you're at it, a chance to revert to old skill plan layout).
---
I feel ya. I was having a hell of a dry spell until I pulled 3/4 billion out of two Lowsec escalations, yesterday. Shit, was I happy. 
---
Then to get this 120mil implant from a den, today? I'll probably get screwed for the next year, or two, and have to pick up mining.
---
Poor guy is probably getting awful traction on that floor. That's why hamsters work better.

dumb bots got owned

Also me personally? Several of your keepstars and cap fleets. Now go munch some rocks so you can have things for me to shoot.
---
As time goes on, it is not uncommon for parents to move in with their kids... 
---
Hitting a blunt should make them focus more.  I think most of CCP is at the meth stage at this point.
---
all bombed on the same tick

but jay, they didnt pull on one tick!

Thanks Boris ♥

You're forgetting this classic: https://www.deviantart.com/tabnir/art/T3-chans-358356788
---
Imagine being this bad at basic math and game mechanics that a single ship breaks you down so much you forget how to use your words.
---
he is in the drone regions.  so a bit different.  Frigs can catch you depending on where they spawn.  
---
... but how does it make you feel to know that bots can play EVE better than humans?
---
poor cloaky kids
---
thats programmed into the bot to make it not look like a bot
---
How does asset safety work again ?
---
This is great for the market.
---
Spaked*
---
Looks about right to me. 
---
lmfao

Warped to random Poco to take a break, see T2 player wreck. Peeked inside, several faction mods, dread ammo and one A-Type invuln. Grabbed it all and salvaged the wreck. I'm a completionist.

That was the best fleet i've ever FCed. Thanks for the fun Ranger Regiment!
---
There isn't a "best" fit as it depends on your playstyle and preference.  The best fit is the highest damage that you can put out while still not dying.  This of course depends on how much AFK you want to be.  Really, just play around and feel out what you like.  I prefer a full buffer / shield regen fit, but others perfer armor (not as popular in the drones) or shield boosting fit.   I usually stop at 3 DDAs as the 4th doesn't speed things that much up and with the additional buffer i can go a bit more afk etc. 
---
Aye lmao you got us dude.
---
You may not like it but this is what peak PvP looks like
---
I liked one of the books, wanted to join the Guristas when I realised EVE the game was based on a random book I had read a few years earlier.
---
Still have stuff in their NPC stations from trying to live there, get standing and join them.
---
Little did I know ... you can't join them. :((
---
&gt;The Forge
---
It's a public manufacturing house for Hi-sec industrialists who dont have their own facilities. This stuff was probably all due to ship to Jita or one of the local trading Citadels.
---
There is no scaling. It always drops triple loot. Easy to tell by stuff dropping in stacks.
---
Also, the ingame estimate for abyssal stuff is iffy at best. 
---
My first big loot: I was derping in an executioner in lowsec, warped to a site with way too many rats in it but I could kill one that dropped a faction point for over 100m. The other nice find I had was a lone gecko far from everything in a wormhole. I had a few drops bigger than these but these are the notable ones. :)
---
You may not failscade; however, you about as weak as FCON was lol 
---
This - https://zkillboard.com/kill/56537114/
---
doesnt they always?
---
Well, okay so look at the All Time Top for the [Oracle](https://zkillboard.com/ship/4302/topalltime/). TEST used to use these a lot during the HBC era as fleet ships, yet if you look at the individual player top 10 all time, most are solo or small gang pilots (although Dreddit is still the top Corp of all time due to them using it as a fleet ship). The top for me to beat would be 2,866 kills which is very much doable.
---
Even if you take a ship like the [Raven](https://zkillboard.com/ship/638/topalltime/), the number to beat is 1,699 and the top guy for that is a pure killboard padder.
---
:wtc:
---
Citadels ruined the game 
---
Lol safe pvp sooo safe pvp
---
Aside from the joke, this does raise a number of questions that appear to have interesting answers.
---
Stab in the dark: Russia?
---
You want to balance the isk explosion by adding a scram range implant. This could literally be the dumbest fucking idea ever. How dumb are you exactly? You should never ever take part in a discussion that is even remotely concerned with balance.
---
The fact that you have no reason for having this in the game should mean rejection by default.
---
&gt;since it doesn't negatively affect the game in any drastic manner
---
So you want bad things in the game if they are just slightly bad. Thats amazingly retarded.
---
Umm ... no? Original Goons vs morphed (neo)-Goons.
---
I just don't forgive or forget what Goons do. They have and probably still are doing some nasty RL stuff, attacking the player rather than the character.
---
&gt;tri, gotg
---
top fucking kek
---
Probably just a bunch of freighters
---
Maybe that’s the right move. I think you are seeing hostility where there is none. Solo WH can be a very steep learning curve and you are taking offense when people are patiently explaining so a WH corp is going to be a bad fit. 
---
I left about 4 years ago and came back in december.
---
Citadels are obviously the biggest change. Starbases were a buggy nightmare that took way to much effort to do anything. Actual stations are amazing. And they look cool.
---
Im still getting used to the fleet structure changes. Not needing actual skills to pass bonuses is a nice QOL change, but im not sold. They could have done something else with the command skills besides burst range. Having fleet command 5 on my alt now feels like a waste.
---
Precursor ships and the whole abyssal thing is blowing my mind. I love the abyss idea, but i dont like the mutaplasmids in a game like this. I hated how blizzard made random stat bonuses a thing in their games, and i dont like it here.
---
My beloved claymore is now a missle boat. Need to train HAMs.
---
Why are cap batteries so much better than rechargers in every situation now? It used to be small ship = battery, large ship = recharge. Now i get better stability with batteries even on battleships.
---
I dont fly capitals, but the EFT warrior in me loves the force aux ships, and the crazy new titan modules.

67 killed. We had to bring in another bomb truck. After 20 minutes, they still were 'vator mining. 
---
this would explain so much of why the chat breaks on a regular basis.
---
Yeah it was. Supercaps maybe not, but carriers and dreads were plenty common everywhere.
---
That they continue iterating instead of allowing imbalance to happen is a good thing.

details?

&gt;   You can generally deduce trends with decent accuracy just by looking at available metrics.

The only metric they have release is combined active player count.
---
this is good for bitcoin
---
Wow, your delusional ravings remind me of the gigx cultists.  
---
Thanks.
---
mutaplasmids ?
---
I'm at work so I have a limited time for memeposting. My apologies, I'll self destruct an avatar as an apology 
---
Someone who has used them will have to give a better answer, but from what i understand its rare loot from abyssal dungeons that let you randomize stats on modules. You can get crazy powerful officer grade stuff, or t1 trash.
---
the amount of stupid in my own alliance amazes me
---
damn, thats one fitted titan in excavator drones..
---
bLack LEGIoN hASN'T ACComplIShEd ANYthIng IN DelVe

all's great except that teeeny tiny little fact that you would need to sell tens of thousands of those DC IIs to make any visible profit...
---
Do input materials and pending deliveries show up in a scan?
---
Had a pretty big (300ish, big to me at the time) multi-sided fleet fight qhen I was in faction warfare, lots of people in t3cs and faction battleships and shit, me in a tackle frigate about 6 months into the game. I bookmarked the wrecks and came back in a hauler hoping to get lucky, scooped about 800mil in assorted faction mods and somehow managed to bail juuust as another group of scavengers came to check it out. I was sweating bullets!
---
i could be wrong , but stuff in corporate hangers also drop

yeah dude just send 100b isk to querns and i'll give you a code for the phone app

Is that the name in-game?
---
Do you take rubles??
---
Your're gay havoc
---
Thanks, me too
---
They haven't. Look: http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Delve . Not one system taken. Their invasion has failed. The might of the Imperium has sent them running with their tails in between their legs back to the squalor of the north.
---
&gt;It's a public manufacturing house for Hi-sec industrialists who dont have their own facilities
---
it wasn't
---
&gt;One with lots of customers from the look of things since these are all input materials or items waiting to be delivered.
---
nope just 1 alt corp
---
This is correct. Corp hangar drops.
---
Pro tip: Don't use corp hangar. 
---
'nobody will get a killmark on this hull for ages, I'll sort these out later' - a CCP dev, possibly.
---
Had that happen before to our 'home' hole except there was another hole in between the k space and w space connection.
---
We used that (extra) hole to hide the majority of our fleet and baited some randoms, (who obv didn't know the chain connected back to itself) into a losing fight. They seemed a bit freaked out when our fleet 'appeared'. I guess because they thought they had scanned the majority of the wh chain...
---
God, the state of that rack...
---
please don't take that copy pasta post serious......
---
no shit
---
I think that was pretty much everyone who read the BR for this debacle.
---
i just use teamviewer and have it push the sound to my phone... don't tell ccp but i have a macro on my razer mouse that clicks 'warp off' and it safes up all my accounts
---
Oh that’s smart, do you still get the sound notifications when the site is done or when there’s a faction spawn?
---
It doesn't. Corporate hangars go into corporate asset safety, just happened to me last week, still have the package in asset safety.
---
That's a lot for words for "I can't say how it's bad so I'll just keep saying it's bad". 
---
Setting aside low security space.  
---
Restricting cyno's to alliance controlled territories, alongside a mechanic that uses "cyno range projection control points or deployable structures" might be an interesting compromise.   
---
A deploy able that would let you hit within a small range (perhaps 1 Lightyear) outside your territory, that had to be linked to the previously controlled cyno-able area, chain deployed up to the max range of the jumping capital group. 
---
Odd, I got a charon drop in hisec the other week from a raitaru I shot. 
---
Test is part of legacy. Saying legacy/test is like saying imperium/goons.
---
no i have it set to automatically make a note which client got what event when i come back i can bookmark it and loot it. it's just a simple notepad i have on my desktop that just says
---
CLIENT 17 - CHARACTER NAME - FACTION SPAWN - 0052:12
---
as for when sites are done, it lets me know when all 20 are done so i can go back and set them all.. i set it to the "Jobs Done" peasant sound effect from warcraft 3!!!
---
They lost 1 ship vs zero ships when you look at it from a different angle.
---
Refits? Isn't the the 'no refitting with a weapon timer' rule still in effect?
---
Not me, but a few years ago there was a guy whose thing was wardeccing the POSes of dead corps in highsec. For months he got maybe the occasional bill, but nothing too crazy. Then it happened. He opened up a Corp hangar array wreck to find a stashe of capital and super hulls and component BPOs all fully researched, as well as a few T2 BPOs, namely an Ishtar and a Sabre. The very rough appraisal at the time was 70-100 billion.
---
You never know where secret riches live in this game.
---
was it your structure though ?
---
Brave's been doing quite well. We have sov in both catch and impass.
---
I still click Social-Fleet every time I drop fleet even though they fixed the fleet window closing automatically like 6 months ago. I might off myself if I have to relearn muscle memory for other menus.
---
4x RR dominixes (3x should work on the BR)
---
Warp in, kill rats, afk while drones kill the structure.
---
would they be test dreads, or ncpl dreads since the corp flipped and brought the structure with them?
---
Why would that even matter? The structure owner has to rent a corp office just like anyone else, they're functionally identical regardless of who owns it.
---
But yes, it was mine and the corp hangar was the corp that owned the structure.
---
I too miss the suitcase. =*(
---
is losing all those dreads really cause for them to lose total morale and just give up?
---

Thank me later.
---
When I was a newbie less than a week into the game I got a 400 mill mid grade implant from a highsec belt rat. 
---
ya apparently they joined test like 3-4 months ago, i thought it was more recent
---
fuck that's alot of drones
---
\#DronesLivesMatter
---
anime was a mistake. pod urself (in game ofc).
---
That charon would have been built in that Raitaru and waiting for delivery.
---
Only materials or results of currently running industry jobs drop.
---
A Full set of CNBCUs from a nemesis i onepunched with a thrasher on an undock in npc nullsec 
---
The burden of proof is on those who want it to show why it is good for the game.
---
Maybe I'm a little slow, but 2k kills is a LOT of kills to me. I've been flying solo off and on for a year or two and I only have 600 solo kills. At that rate, in a single ship, sure you can get there, but that's still a scale of years.
---
Get a Corp asap
---
This innocent highsec raitaru right here: https://zkillboard.com/kill/74811616/
---
Its a lot of kills but its doable, and thats why it's an endgame challenge for me. I'm going to try a much less used ship first though.
---
I was running industry jobs in a structure that was destroyed and they asset safetied though. 
---
How? 
---
I see Fafer made a wise decision
---
big thanks!
---
lol yeah, soon as casino went away from the game, because their hate of goons was only about casino money feeding them. Or maybe it was a mentality shared by many player, and this mentality still exist and we can call them Grr-Goons player, but pro-MBC sound better for me since it was the name they took when they decide to take the north from goons because grr-goons
---
RIP
---
Weren't these left over from the maila park thingy when the maila keepstar was still alive?
---
Yep I’ve made contact with some old corpie friends and they’re happy to have me join them. :)
---
Lmao of course.
---
Nope!
---
Ya my bad eve is great now that sov is actually useless lol!!
---
FML
---
I don't think you can even join Moosearmy with less than 5 rorquals. TESTs premier krab corp.
---
High Sec??? Well, shit.
---
1. Buy skins
---
2. Get bored
---
3. Leave for a few more years
---
4. Repeat step 1-4.
---
Hmm, I'm getting a lot of entrepreneurial ideas from this post...
---
Careful what you say about the most hardened battle force in Eve my dude 
---
Stop looking at deer titties at work
---
Too late it's on SiSi, everyone knows it's not used for player feedback, it's just a way of easing you into those changes that are guaranteed to happen...

Saved, and I realized my mistake.  I thought that url contained this http://forum.eve-ru.com/index.php?showtopic=63838

chill dude i'm not in there, was just making an observation, nothing that important
---
She was just fawning over the cable management, although it's possible that she made doe eyes at the hiring manager for a few extra bucks.
---
I wish my titan could stop all damage taken to it for 7 minutes. Oh wait it would be dead in the period because it's not the all powerful rorqual.
---
What’s your reasoning as to why this specific aspect of lowsec should be exempt from the standing rules in place everywhere else?
---
They do not. If you’re trying to determine if a structure has valuable loot to drop, your best way is to infer from the local indexes and traffic in the structure. This information is publicly available in the starmap. It can require some weapons-grade math though.
---
Okay.
---
Oh! I left before skins were a thing. :)
---
Think of it from a logical perspective - if I am voluntarily enlisted into the militia of a sanctioned empire, why would I receive a legal penalty from attacking a neutral/pirate opponent that’s intruding into a military complex? 
---
Tri is dead bois, nothing to see here.  Move along.
---
Yes, These dreads were in built for 1 and a half years...
---
This game could really use more of these Delve killmails
---
Fuck that's true
---
i quit i'm joining goons
---
It’s been requested tons of times for many many years. The reasoning is that no neutral party has any business being near or in a fw plex. If they are they are looking for a fight and should be flagged suspect and engageable without loss of standings. Doesn’t make sense that everyone in faction warfare should be a pirate because neutrals entering combat zones.
---
Yeah, excavator drones are so big loss to the rorqual miners.
---
&gt;we point it out
---
And then ignore it anyway cause it's ccp ui team...
---
Then now you get to be a dream client for CCP, do everything in order, not being able to reach step 6 is also intended...
---
Noooo, stop! 
---
I went on a roam through drone lands a few years ago, was hunting ratters/miners like usual. We happened upon a skiff or mackinaw (can’t remember which) and promptly killed it. Upon looting it I discovered a corpse and took that as well. It was only after checking my cargo later on that I realized it was the corpse of one of our head FCs.
---
I still don’t know how or why it was there. I still treasure it to this day.
---
Truth hurts but meh... why bother fighting when you can buy new skins only this week for just $59.99
---
An a-type invuln from a t1 frig pvp frig. 
---
Came expecting a bunch of dead dreads or something, instead I got drones. Cool.
---
It's delve they're idiots
---
All eve goons have been pseudo-goons since PL carried them through killing BoB. 
---
Just 59,99?? Brb stealing moms Credit card
---
I hope that at least kills the stupid meme, if they were still mining with hostiles in local then they were just dumb afkers and not bots.
---
Oh you don’t know how correct you are. I’m also doing things like EVE North (since I live in Toronto) as well as doing Fanfest probably 2020. What step involves going to see my name on the monument? ;)
---
I got a True Sansha scram from the Frostline mining site. I know, sansha from a mordu's event. Belt rats came by and one was a True Sansha
---
Lol! Actually no. You need to be able to fly certain PvP ships to join. 
---
By the way...I’m the HR Director if Moosearmy. We have a fleet minutes per month requirement or your ass goes to high sec. 
---
eve is just a random game now...dont feeel the need to log in anymore...fock ur mining and skins and citadels
---
Nice flair bait
---
How dare you bomb my drones! :(((((
---
BONG
---
My immediate reaction
---
They killed Walking in Stations and Dust. They were supposed to bring Dust back like 3 times but haven't succeed yet. 
---
I'm not taking offense and i'm not seeing a patient explanation. I saw someone say that you shoot *EVERYONE* this was confusing. So i asked and was accused of misrepresenting. 
---
I probably didn't articulate myself the best.
---
I just want to point out here that you seem to be saying "you can't find people without local", and I'm saying "...I do that every day". There may be other factors within k-space that make it harder than in w-space, but we should be discussing those factors and not simply saying it doesn't work at a baseline.
---
b0pe needs to die already, not having a brazillian be the CEO is heresy
---
Or Shadow Flight, newbro and alpha friendly.
---
Damn black legion finally did something.
---
No no no, they've reached botting perfection. They've actually managed to program in the retardation of the average goon, good luck catching them now CCP! 
---
RemindMe! 2 years
---
"We don't bot" 
---
&gt; You missed ... guns are independent
---
&gt; less gun management
---
You're very right tho
---
You know as well as anyone you can't remove damage caps on Keepstars.
---
Buying a permanent marker. Bonus points for vandalizing Xenurias name for a 2nd time. 
---
a symptom of a larger issue
---
I've also not heard anyone argue against it in the roughly 1.5 billion times this has been suggested. 
---
Who's stuff was this?
---
were there no timers?
---
Was this an awox? [https://evewho.com/pilot/away-god%20KD](https://evewho.com/pilot/away-god%20KD)
---
it took them what? 6 years to fix warp core stabs in plexes and they still managed to break insta gate activation?
---
don't hold your breath.
---
Imagine people just farm all day because they have nothing better to do. That's not too mind blogging, considering people stacking alts and spreadshit warrioring.
---
don't
---
You know more than anyone that the majority of your bots are far smarter than your players.
---
don't forget the part about tweeting a photo on an account named after someone else in an attempt to frame that person.
---
everything that was dying 5 years ago is dead, roaming is practically dead, supercaps and caps are literally EVERYWHERE cant roam null without getting dropped, all the bigboy F1 fights are supercap brawls, CCP has done nothing in the last two-3 years maybe even before that but appeal to krabs and empire building. goons have abused the current rorq meta to the point that literally no one would be able to fight them and come out on top (most likely) unless they fuck up BIG TIME. in null you are either in one of three coalitions or you get farmed out of existence.
---
ITT: People being resistant to change as always.
---
This is the exact same reaction that happened last time they changed it. Guess what, people got used to the new one. Not we're grabbing pitchforks to keep it.
---
Yeah come to think of it maybe it’s best they don’t lol
---
Why did it drop Corp hanger drop loot? I thought everything went to asset safety?
---
Capital ancillary shield booster bpc 20 run, dropped from a carrier rat. Sold it 2 days later for 18bil
---
&gt;keep that political shit out of here, thanks.
---
Yep! It’s an easy fix, easy as in it doesn’t negatively affect anything else. 
---
When I was starting again I got a 70m ammo drop from a .9 combat site, that was unexpected.
---
So really your argument is over rorquals in goon space.  Due to the fact if your rorqual does not have reinforcements to save it the invul does not matter.  It’s still going to die.  Want proof look at zkill.  They die everyday.  And so do their billion isk drones.  I personally like rorquals the way they are for the content they bring and the isk I’ve made stealing drones.
---
Got pointed by the structure in my deacon right as we were warping off before a fight started, and the "bleutrals" backstabbed and popped me. Our fleet wrecked em back. Shopped around in 5 systems to half-build a taranis and came back to help my brethren pop looters and targets of opportunity. Was a fun fight, especially as a 3rd party.
---
New stuff that made quite an impact (for the better or worse):
---
- player stuctures (PVE and PVP)
---
- new sov mechanics (PVP)
---
- (rorqual) mining 
---
- agency events every other month (PVE)
---
- Abyssal deadspace &amp; triglavian ships (PVE and PVP)
---
From a nullsec/meta perspective: Everybody and his mother has a goon ratting alt in Delve nowadays, using the safety of the super capital umbrella to fill his personal coffers. Of course this has overloaded goon's coffers as well, wich basically has flushed any balance of power in the PVP part of this game kinda down the toilet. Read a Montly Economic Report and you'll get an idea. 
---
The poitical part of Eve was actually exciting a few years ago, when all of Eve united to kick out goons from the North and then went back to the daily business of fighting eachother again. But with one single alliance having more supers nowadays than the rest of Eve combined, Eve politics have become too one-sided and therefore boring imo. 
---
The rise of Pandamic Horde is worth mentioning though. This massive newbro-minded PL spin-off, centered on PVP gudfights, has proven to be a content magnet for the rest of Eve. You want content in this game, you just take a fleet and visit the themepark that's called Geminate.
---
Thank you again for this valuable public service. 
---
/u/TnTHeidiMae
---
even with low power, there's timer.
---
Is that when they added the negative targeting stats to WCS? Coming back after 10 years that was one of the things I was glad for.
---
Jobs installed with "on behalf of the corp" ticked.
---
It’s delve they’re rich 
---
What do you want to do? Just do it in wormholes.
---
Not the entire fleet at all it was PLs super fleet there was still like 300+ titans and supers in the north
---
I won't lie, those dreads had a pretty beastly tank.
---
**NO** WE LEGACY WILL OVERWHELM THE NORTH WITH OUR SUPERIOR SUPERFLEET ^(that’s highly supported by the goons)* 
---
To be honest it’s barely a trade hub any more nearly everything goes through jita or amarr 
---
Fair enough the eve-lingo is a little confusing. I remember asking what "point" meant early on and drawing some chuckles in comms.
---
People don't shoot corpmates, but pretty much everybody else is somebody you shoot, so no other corps are set to blue. That said, sometimes people do fleet up with other corps to get a target. I've pinged Wingspan when I found something I couldn't kill solo and was far from Dropbears chain.
---
SHIT
---
correct me if im wrong but if you have any bay "overloaded" you cant warp or jump anymore right?
---
Insta gate activation (known by some groups as power sliding) was kinda broken. Now I’m definitely biased as I’m a pirate who shoots fw people. However, being able to constantly bring back up into a fight with literally no way to stop it is definitely broken. In any other context back up can be slowed down or stopped entirely, being invuln just because you spammed a gate activate is lend.
---
And yet, looking at the 1DQ price for Excavator was over the last 100 days, the price is going down.  
---
Was 1.25 billion about 100 days ago.  Now buy orders 825 billion and sell 884 billion.  Not any real movement of 30 days.  
---
So, the long and short of it, unless no one bothers to replace their drones, it’s probably not making much of a real impact.  
---
Be nice to Fafer 😡
---
Incorrect, fighter bay and cargo bay were overloaded yet i was able to warp around/jump. I think if you were logged out before the changes and log in after, then it is applied after you dock/undock or interact with cargo etc.
---
Avatar cat ears when?
---
I mean, if a rorq mines roughly 200mil/hour, and each drone is roughly 1bil, it takes 5 hours to replace one drone. So if you lose a whole flight, that's 25 hours of mining to replace a flight of drones.
---
I'd say that's pretty significant, if you lose a day of mining because you lost your excavators.
---
I was logi and links in that fight and it was great fun. Really sweaty on the logi too as people were getting volleyed.
---
Only complaint is the trickling in of HAW dreads by snuff. When the fight ended, it was literally 1-1 dreads to our battleships.
---
gr8 b8 m8. I r8 8/8
---
that  makes sense 
---
depends on where you are.  in some space 15-20 mil cans and 40-50 mil sites can be found.
---
Both probably. 
---
Probably cause that's where they needed the dreadbomb.
---
I mean, it's like 15 dreads worth of excavators
---
Ishtar
---
And here I thought it was going to completely ruin goons financially.
---
Near2 and other similar programs are cancer. Learn to watch Intel on your own and stop using the complacency crutch 
---
Lol...too right that.  Around 5 billion loss does take normal miners a little time to replace.  That said, maybe next time, they will be more careful when it comes to watching local and intel.  A small price to pay to learn that lesson.  
---
Skill extractors/injectors introduced in 2016, thus changing CCP focus  of EVE Online towards maximum cashout. Good or bad, this was definitely one of the biggest changes in EVE Online ever.
---
That's not a deer, that's the loss adjuster from the Hartford looking at where the chat server was...
---
A lot more then 15 dreads and your u can't do insurance on drones.
---
You didn’t answer my question
---
How has this changed the game?
---
Cut out the first 4:19, this would be a masterpiece
---
not against npc, on these fob you just fit double large cap battery until the fob runs out of cap (which it will do before you) and fit some extra cap regen when you get neuted. 
---
enemies spawn 100k away? refit to a mjd. 
---
having such talk of carebear fleets of ten domis needed to kill it i was rather disappointed it turned out extremely easy with two rattlers. 
---
did however not realise i needed a damn industrial to scoop the loot.
---
I'm in TIKLE, I ain't bitching, I think it's hilarious 
---
Meanwhile in 'Advanced' audio options land:
---
SCREEEREREEEE
---
B..but my iskies :(
---
I've seen that one before, and have a copy of it, but somehow missed moving it into this folder. Nice eyes. 
---
botters would have recalled their drones as soon as BL entered local, not keeping them out for 30min+
---
Wait, does this mean that Horde wants to take back the Forge/Perimiter trade again? I thought Gobbins backed out on this a few months ago.
---
I was teaching my friend who just joined how to do lowsec belt ratting for easy starting money. We found a Mordu's Legion frigate spawn that dropped a Garmur BPC, two of them across two systems!
---
I manufactured them and gave him half the isk from selling the two and he was super happy and bought a Thorax.
---
you may be thinking of hirr or synda
---
It can be profitable but playing the 0.01 isk game isn’t worth it. Keep in mind that throughout the day the price will fluctuate up and down. You don’t need to update orders constantly to roll in sales. What you need is a huge number of buy and sell order slots across multiple characters to not have to 0.01 isk constantly to get any sales and buys. 
---
That said way too tedious for me too. 
---
Some things are so gay and dumb they cannot be explained to outsiders.
---
just remove excavators.
---
That's the kinda shit that keeps people around
---
Filthy fucking krab. 
---
Yes, but you didn’t answer my question...
---
Krabbin4lyfe bro
---
*quietly puts Excavator BPCs back on the market*
---
High-sec is the end-game!
---
These are part of the epic cap builders Vily pinged about after PGL whelped all the dreads.
---
5 years ago low sec pvp was limited to t1 cruisers and below as jump fatigue was nonexistent and capitals would be dropped on anything worth dropping on (t1 BS, t2 cruisers, etc).
---
It was also a great time to start in FW since the whole meta relied on low sp, cheap ships. Strangley the threat of a PL drop prevented people from upshipping too much so it was a regular occurrence to have your 20 man cruiser gang met by another 20 man cruiser gang.
---
Actually they use asics now
---
PEAK
---
Okay then, Short answer is YOU don't.
---
How about you stop crying?
---
yes u can, but its easier to just use a bluetooth headset while u mow the lawn
---
they're just drones dummy lol who cares why don't you fight something that can fight back like the supers they camp anoms with 
---
already replaced
---
NC. In Blue, TEST&amp;Co. In red
---
As an AWS person I can confirm I don't know my ass from my elbows, however this is really just a shitpost; I really doubt any problems CCP has are related to AWS in any form or shape.
---
I don’t what???
---
I ask if it’s possible to get the mobile notifications on my phone, not some donor don’t question, retard..
---
Please keep using 3rd party programs to get ahead of others.
---
Who the hell mows their lawn in January in the middle of winter...?
---
I got a 3 run Capital Ancillary Shield Booster bpc from a normal, nonfaction serpentis belt rat. It was worth a lot at the time.
---
It’s legal and CCP let’s me, so adapt or else..
---
Use the screenshot button. It'll save you a hot of hate from the eve boys
---
On you when you don't know how to watch intel properly because you got lax and relied on NEAR2 or other garbage.
---
Uh, missed a couple of decimal points? 
---
Highsec doing what Highsec does best
---
What's so special about this?  Am I missing something?
---
Botception
---
It’s fine, all I would lose is a VNI which is EASY to replace
---
And if you catch my rorq, I’ll just panic and light cyno, so your point is??
---
That too. You just cant kill em instantly(unless they re shitfit). Deal with it. vOv
---
You've made it for me.
---
Supers and titans were a big thing, and so was just knowing some bittervet that had one.
---
Lag was bad but drake blobs n alpha maelstrom fleets were fun enough.
---
Shitbirds used to dualbox a falcon alt to get out if a fight was going south.
---
As well as the usual voice &amp;chat services, Test had their own tv channel thing for movies, which were interupted with news broadcasts for upcoming fleets, 
---
Battlecruiser fights / small fleet fights with them were the best thing ever and common in low sec.
---
...wait all this was more than 5 years ago, shit
---
CEOs just got TEST command ping to prep for deployment to Assah. We're headed to a deployment in Provi for a morale boost to farm carebears. God I hope we don't lose a region to CVA.
---
Can confirm. Were dead. I'm not even logged in, that's how dead we are.
---
yeah that's definitely true
---
See you soon! Don’t forget to grab your standard issue titan and rorqual when you arrive!
---
I’m missing it 😢
---
What's TRI relations like with PANFAM?
---
Luckily our goal is to get kills and no single-handedly disrupt the Delve mining operation
---
Chat worked back then. Now it doesn't.  
---
Jeez, great rack on that deer.  
---
We've been doing this for months. We've killed hundreds of excavs
---
thEYrE jUST drOnEs 
---
Shitty laptop with shitty double hotkeys from different software running...
---
Shitty excuses
---
everyday we Stray further from gods light :feelsbad:
---
&gt; I had mines in the cargo hold.
---
jesus fuck that must have been such a long time ago, can i have one? 
---
It’s super sad when you see alliance x is eating shit in random system. 
---
Open the report anticipating some dank titan whelping and it’s wall to wall mining drone kills. 
---
Honestly who cares?
---
Thankfully i haven't built or bought one yet. This thread has convinced me to use other people places. The main reason I wanted to was because I have had a number of stations where I have been doing industry shut down. I came back after a while absent to discover jobs that were ongoing where now in asset safety and thought I could avoid this. I guess I just have to roll the dice.
---
I'm struggling to see the logic in this UI update if i'm honest
---
/u/ccp_falcon was this done by a work experience student?
---
of course you will eventually get used to it but the time until then sucks balls when you open the wrong window 10000 times
---
Lol...corrected.  Thanks. Inflation not that bad yet.  
---
Link your lossmail.
---
As a former data center guy yea, a fair bit of cringe there.
---
Don't have any. Was looking through the bounties cause I smart bombed someone and got 41 mil from it, the idea of bounty hunting sounds fun especially if we had to do high sec ganks for it. Went to see what kind of ships they flew to gauge what we'd need to claim them, and obviously it's not physically possible for us to even claim the bounties because they all abandoned the corp.
---
It shouldn't be. With all the other issues affecting fw right now please don't waste time on this. This guy does not speak for us all. 
---
yeah if you add them all up they lost a single titan. 
---
Sounds great. 
---
Actually a little activity down here in Delve makes it more fun.  Gives JU standing something to do other than sperg up Theta comms.  
---
Enjoy your drone hunting...I am sure there are some MTUs around that you can go after next. 
---
eve wiki is an UNOFFICIAL source by the way
---
It's kinda funny when the corp leader/directors don't know it's you that's doing it, and don't remember that all of the assholes talking shit in chat applied on the same day and had "blah blah alt" in their applications.
---
Find me dozens of 1b MTUs and I'll hunt them
---
yay wrong information.
---
spanked\*
---
I was talking about wanting this on comms yesterday too, this'd be a nice feature to have.
---
200M/hr in a rorq? Only if you're mining moons. 
---
330 million in total drops from a high-sec 4/10 DED.
---
I've had bounties returned to my wallet before. No idea why though.
---
I got some when they came out, lots of fun, but larger entities that use all the glitches of hi sec to wipe you out ruined that fun and the losses were painful. Lesson learned. Best idea is join a larger corp/alliance with thier own so you can use to your hearts content.
---
Anyone else miss the old player unfriendly circa 2011 UI?
---
See what I mean? Lol
---
You are indeed wrong, corp hangers go into asset safety.
---
Source: All the goddamn assets safety cans my corp has everywhere in lowsec from all the faction citadels that got unachored :|
---
Ruining the game for new players who get sucked up by some dumpster tier carebear corp before they can join an actual corp that will teach them how to play?
---
hurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr^(rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr)
---
Pretty much anyone south of where it doesn't snow.  Like a large portion of the world.
---
It was long after they stopped being usable items but before they were removed from the game. I haven't seen any since I came back to the game in june.
---
AKA not going into FW with a hangar full of Breachers and Rifters IMMEDIATELY after character creation. Yes. That. And also MTUs lol
---
It's just PrintScreen.
---
This should be such an easy fix though. 
---
Oh, thanks for your input
---
YW.  Fly safe ! 
---
get out of my region son.
---
Only one of them knew it was me doing it and he wasn't logged in when the fun started. It was like two hours later as I was forming the corp into  two groups of people 1 for and  1 against ridiculing my alt that he logged in realized what I was doing and ruined all my fun for the sake of the corps sanity. The best part was they wouldn't believe both characters were me for awhile it was great.
---
Welcomes all of New Eden's traders? It's only a matter of time until they increase the taxes.
---
I should stop posting and biomass btw FeelsBadMan
---
I still see complaints about the last change every time it gets brought up.  What gives you the impression people got used to it?
---
Make sure you apply to CODE for your ratting license... 
---
No Horde definitely isn’t going back to perimeter. I talked to Gobbins about it today.
---
But... but Goons on reddit said that there are not many rorqual bots
---
A fix to something that isn't a problem for everyone. 
---
Is that some sort of compiler I should be using?
---
Named expander in the side in Angur sun, the one that used to be there, you could sell one for the price of Moa in 2003 :)
---
No keep going, I'm almost there
---
we actually had a conversation YESTERDAY about LOWERING them ;p.
---
and if you go to the help desk we very clearly say that we hold the right to revoke access to people attacking the keepstar
---
For real? I am brushing up with Excel because eve and a few people form work want me to help them, but should I be moving to Sheets?
---
Another thing from my work is making weekly presentations, I tried Slides put went back to Powerpoint because it sucked, Powerpoint sucks to, but not as bad.
---
Dear Vily,
---
I am too lazy to shoot at the shields. No one is going to contest the armor timer if that happens. Is it possible to contact the TTT helpdesk about making an expection for a poor spacetrucker?
---
make neut alt?
---
Yea my bet was that it was a fighter construction rait for ranger regiment 
---
if the 60 billion on the BR is accurate its like losing close to  20-30 uninsured dreads depending on the fit.
---
feels good to have an entire folder.
---
So your  argument here isn’t that it’s a bad change, just that it’s not something you care about. I don’t give a shit about my sec status either but it’s pretty obvious to me that this change would be a slam dunk with zero drawbacks and minimal effort on CCP’s part. 
---
I didn't want to loose anything from the fight either hehe
---
That's cute &lt;3
---
Not logging in isn't enough. Not being subscribed for a while was. But that was before the introduction of Alphas.
---
I've found one that offers everything I need and there are over a thousand members of the corp. I'm guessing that they wouldn't get picked on as much as a corp like mine that has 3 members
---
this was kinda sad tbh
---
It's a change I'd rather not see happen. There are already ways to increase sec status such as ratting or clone soldier tags. Being pirate encourages pilots to be somewhat more aware of mechanics and to make use of resources such as hauling alts.
---
Even if it were a quick change to implement it's still dev time that could be used on something better.
---
Goons just made a lot of isk on PH and Test fighting. Guess who supplied minerals for those ships and build all those T2 modules.....^(all pun intended)            
---
damn what did pearl abyss do to eve
---
Mmmmm but why the fight? Just because they could?
---
In-game political affiliations are literally a core part of the game.
---
Couldn't these guys move their stuff out before it goes bye bye?
---
and these things will not happen anymore with shitadels, shame because these things are really what makes eve eve
---
It doesn't really matter and isn't worth throwing a fit about it.
---
My point of advice, when I suggest DCII's to anyone starting out is, you won't lose isk while you learn all of the steps of the process.  You should move on from then asap, certainly not try to make a living selling them in Amarr, but it is a good example of something that won't lose you isk while you learn.
---
i mean, other than exploits, bounties haven't been refunded
---
unless you have a source
---
it's always been a one man corp (with alts) and he's active, he just doesn't die
---
Isn't that what panfam normally claims to be looking for? The fabled "gud fites"?
---
Have you tried asking one of your alts? 
---
why would anyone do that? some bizarre belt ratting fit?
---
I believe there was a PANFAM structure in hull that was saved. Then (as in right now) PANFAM forces are hitting the TEST keepstar to provoke a fight - and getting one.
---
This is just from what I've seen though, and no official AAR has been given due to stuff still happening.
---
Oof
---
https://br.inyour.space/?s=144&amp;b=8452560&amp;e=330&amp;t=bqfaaaaaaaaaq
---
BR so far I believe. PanFam shooting at the TEST Keepstar, trying to get the shields. TEST trying to defend.
---
its legal till CCP decides its not, some of these decisions seem to ride on a coin flip when it comes to their devs.
---
Gud fites come to those who earn them. With hours and hours of bad fites
---
honestly this is complete bullshit, small gang /solo eve is unironically in one of the best places i've ever seen it
---
Imagine sitting on the crutch of citadels ruined the game instead of adapting and getting involved in the new content generators for big and small groups alike 
---
FW was originally designed for newer players. Players that probably won't have access to stuff like hauling alts. Also, I'd much rather my newbros got stuck into pvp rather than the stupid time sink that is lowsec belt ratting, but if you were looking for less new player retention then that's a solid idea. Finally, If they're in lowsec for long enough, their sec status will drop, but it shouldn't plummet off a cliff immediately just because they're actively engaging in the part of the game that's fun. 
---
There's lots of money to be made for whoever owns the hisec markets. Panfam want their isk fountain back and would like to sing on reddit about how they deleted a hisec keepstar, TEST also like easy isk and singing.
---
This has been going on for a while, you should get out more. 
---
Intense
---
We’re also definitely not in the middle of reinforcing the trading keepstar in perimeter 
---
Horde Will win with nc an People join The nc horde figth we need to stop Goons an test before They get to big its now Guys or game over
---
Hauling alts take a couple of days max to train unless you want to start getting into dst or jf use. I'd rather my new guys use them or corp hauling services than feed on trade hub undocks. 
---
I think you are the first person I have seen argue to keep it as it is. So your entire basis for not making any change at all even if it’s simple like proximity to a fw beacon you become suspect is that it would waste developers time because you can simply create alts to do things you are limited on?
---
I get that there are many other issues that resources could be devoted too but how about you give some examples of some that would be unanimously positive with zero negative effects as adding suspect status to neutrals in a war zone
---
“Small groups” 
---
guess ur still in a dream state lmao
---
'smokescreen' covops cloak 3-run BPC from a limited sleeper cache in highsec
---
Well it’s legal now and I have some dishes that need to be done, so you have the code or not?
---
It probably just really depends on the person/group but yeah all the Indy stuff I've been given has been in sheets because it's just easier to share
---
Great argument! Certainly not just context-less memes or anything!
---
I had a sweet job in high school with an IT company and had the opportunity to continue that full time with my own clients. I could have been making a ton of money but I realized I was too young to give up on my life so I went to college instead to study Neuroscience. I may never make as much as I was offered at the age of 18... Life is weird. 
---
Honestly, who would even suggest such a thing?
---
Oh ur right citadels totally benefit the small dude in any sense 
---
Just means I get even richer.
---
I'll beat the other guys price and sell it for 97 billion
---
Who the tower shoots has to do with docking access and also no point in giving those shooting it free cap recharge and repairs. Of course access will be restricted if you shoot it.
---
I did? I feel like I’m getting dumber this conversation keeps going
---
I tend to follow the rules that CCP has in place and find it perfectly fine that my VNI is a negligible loss and I can completely yank your puny dps with my PANIC mod
---
I just need something that can alert me ahead of time so I can finish scrubbing this toilet and get to computer before my excavaters are threatened
---
Can't lose it if you can't take it to begin with.
---
:thinkingface:
---
I don’t know whether you’re being ironic or idiotic tbh. 
---
Well with THAT KB I'm not concerned about you at all.
---
What killboard???
---
Lol!
---
My friend asking about damaviks and kikimoras shipfus. If you now what i mean😅
---
2019 was a bad year.
---
WTB Delve Excav insurance
---
It was an r64 they were mining...
---
So, one of our Azbels was coming out of its reinforcement timer, and we formed feroxes to save it. Test wasn’t on grid with it, so we started shooting the keepstar. Test fought us a few times to force us to let it repair, and were about to undock again when I had to go get dinner. 
---
I once killed a Helios-Scanner in some random WH, he dropped me a 400mil POS faction blueprint.
---
PvP never pays but this one stuck with me.
---
The one that does the most damage while still tanky enough to survive.
---
What that entails depends on your skills, region and anom.
---
I titled this small QoL. What the FW community needs as a whole is a lot more which would take a long time and require a lot of work. This is just another small QoL request. What FW group are you with that hasn’t mentioned this or think this is an issue? 
---
Fucked it up
---
YEah they use asic miners these days
---
Don't be lazy, just create your own killboard, then add all your char's api there.
---
Lol Jesus dood. 
---
This is people multiboxing during fleeeeet
