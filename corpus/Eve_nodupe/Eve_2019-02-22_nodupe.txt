Meh, bois around bleak lands should just move to black rise / elsewhere.  Unironically, there's no sense in trying to play the game with these people.  Plus, unless you've enslaved yourself to goons recently, you probably have fewer big ships to move around than snuff :)

Thanks for the update, its been a while since i last did incursions.
---
He said 10% of his share, i'm guessing he had split it with someone else.
---
Using NPSI to clear out SOV that nullsec alliances won't....... Hard No.
---
I miss you weirdos 
---
These kind of videos are my favorite thing about EVE
---
 \&gt; go to that system with a fleet of real players and start farming it, the bots will stay docked and you'll have their wallets locked
---
They'll only stay docked as long as your fleet is there.
---
And they keep a closer eye on us after the election too.
---
Why doesn't Shadow Cartel use their titans?
---
Please don't eat koahi TIA
---
Whenever you kill a ratting carrier or super the Rats will always be the top damage (unless they catch in on the 1st or 2nd site) cause it saves all damage done to the ship in that system. 
---
so you are saying he does rmt but just is too smart to get caught?
---
its about as close to the 10% bpc worth as you can get with an immediate payout
---
Eventually the owner of them will grow tired and try to move out. This only happens beacause we let them do it
---
I thought you were a cool dude. 
---
This sucked to read
---
Wow this thread went to shit real fast, lol.
---
I mean, I paid well for that detective service. Lol. 
---
I’m gonna need a loan to pay back the merc that tracked that down 
---
lol no.  
---
Do you think anyone in alliance leadership doesn't rmt?
---
Good job linking to another, larger thread on the front page you twit
---
And if you don't think this is effective take it up with olmeca gold, he seems very annoyed about it. You should set him straight 
---
Also known simply as trading...
---
you know the shorter a sound clip is the more accurate it is, i heard this from a friend
---
I dont want to, but I do love me some sliced and grilled spam dipped in melted cheese.
---
quick google search came up with this, mentions Lychton so I'm assuming it's what I'm talkin about https://www.reddit.com/r/Bravenewbies/comments/31m3a1/brave_leadership_is_changing/
---
B..b..but capitals are OP and ruining eve?
---
CCP didn't ban Azathio, although he's now blacklisted by Goons and TEST. 
---
Does skill farming still work? I thought injector/extractor markets had gone to shit recently. 
---
Amarr have a nice array of missile/drone ships to help on the pve front.
---
Yes, because Reddit is the place where we show off how fun we are at  parties. Because we obviously have to spend our time proving ourselves to others.
---
He's the loan shark in the second dingiest pub in town.
---
dude that sux you got a YT complaint.  That shit is low blow bullshit.  I get it some people in Delve don't like you but come on whoever did that....That's ridiculous.  I for one think it's awesome Olmeca did what he did.  He is really good at it.  So is Don Trolleone, aka marshy.  It gives content.  The streamer should have done a 5 min delay or more..that's crazy why stream where you are ratting in a Nyx....damn
---
So what the story?
---
I see
---
R.I.P ZINTBUS 
---
It's a good meme, but why is there no distinction being made between INIT &amp; Bastion, plus that happened on Bastion home turf, it had nothing to do with the deployment other than we were busy moving instead of helping another alliance?
---
I am arguging that the issues it 'causes' are far less influential in eve than in other less well designed economies in mmos.  
---
Why does your entire enjoyment of the game revolve around the use of automated tools that you never encounter and struggle to identify correctly as automated?
---
Option 1 - super rat one Saturday a month, all day. Bring energy drinks and a bucket to piss in. Expect to be completely catatonic all day Sunday from the concentration drain.   
---
option 2 - Create 5 VNI alt accounts who exist only to be AFK in havens or hubs. After monthly extraction profit you'll be about a hundred mil short of plexing each account. While doing other things, have these clients spinning in havens or hubs completely afk. You'll lose some but shouldn't give a crap. The plex gap adds 20m a day to your requirements, throw in another 20m daily allowance for replacing losses, means you'd need to average 1.6 ticks a day for the month. That's one site each toon. Total actions required is "undock", "warp to", "orbit", "launch drones", "recall drones", "dock" - 6 actions, not counting login.  
---
Option 3 - pull off a convincing catfish and become a corp CEO as the token hot girl. Leech taxes. Win Eve. (or does this only work in WOW?)
---
He as a person is permanently banned. At least they ban all his accounts, they might also ban any shared accounts that he has logged into (sharing accounts is against rules but rarely actioned)
---
So why the gsf Blacklist? Were you really involved with RMT? 
---
Well if you think you don’t deserve the ban you can open a support ticket and be prepared to come 100% clean with the GMs (and to wait weeks for any result).
---
I got a character back that way a long time ago when it seemed a lost cause (not rmt tho); it’s not hopeless and they do see reason if you aren’t lying to them.
---
But if you were selling isk to pay the rent then good luck I guess
---
In b4 ban for sharing GM communications after unban for RMT :)
---
I once asked Nolak how long it took someone to pay off a 30b loan when they got it for  a Rorq or Carrier/Super and a ping went out, we happened to join the same op he then starts talking shit about said person who just asked for a loan with zero collateral. I was not asking for a loan merely how long it takes the average person to pay off 30 bill with low collateral and he was just too smug for my taste. You will be forever meme'd in alliance chat you corrupted fallen Bee.
---
with plex prices where they are and ccp actually hunting down rmters, rmting seems like it would be a lot of work for less return than a minimum wage job
---
not like work getting the isk, just assuming you've got trillions of isk, turning it into dollars while not getting caught and banned just doesn't seem worth the effort
---
I've come across some data sites that I cannot scan down to better than about 67%, no matter how many times I scoot the little box around. What am I missing? 
---
I too find it funny because everything I stated there has happened so far, you moved to NPC space, lost citadels (including that exact fort), and most of your ihubs. Also, before TRI ever even arrived you managed to repeatedly feed subcaps and caps to us...so thanks for the content. 
---
"we're experimenting. all is well. nothing to see here. move along!"
---
Is this a pasta or are you retarded 
---
I know this is gonna have some wide variance, but for trade is there a rough percentage return on investment per day/week/month you should be aiming for? Looking at doing a mix of station trading as well as moving to other markets to upsell.
---
Thanks heaps :)
---
You use hammers on nails hombre...
---
Nice.
---
Funny how when Marshy got accused of shit Goons had their pitchforks ready to go. This dude literally gets banned for RMT and all Goons are like "lulz Nolak thx for giving me that rorq once bud haha."
---
Moved to NPC space, Lols. Our staging is NPC station atm as we all need to be in one place logically, however we never moved out of Ewok. We lost that Forti to Snuff and NC mainly, not to you. You alone wouldn't be able to do much at all. Even that system you hold, without TRI umbrella you wouldn't be able to hold it. When it comes to "feeding" you with anything, you are gankers only. You wil never fight outnumbered. Keep dreaming. 
---
damn you really made them upset, they even linked your post in mumble
---
Just out of my own curiosity, how exactly and precisely did u/PurityOfHerpes obtain this picture in the original post ? Is this poster Nolak himself ? Or did this Nolak come on another account somewhere and say "look everyone I got banned !" and started sharing this picture with everyone ? Or did this Nolak share it only with a few people who then shared it with a few more so on and so forth ? How did it end up here ?
---
why does this guy have such a hard on for goons?
---
I’m that good. 
---
83m? That's 2 hours mission running in a marauder.
---
Ignoring the publisher fallacy (dev cycles and all that, see wow peaking pre-merger, etc):  
---
One of my mains points is unfocused outcry.  I have been playing WoW and EvE for a similar time span.  Problems will not get solved without being identified as a problem first.
---
EG:  I posted quite vehemently in early WoW development about issues with the gear item formula, mainly that over time increasing ilvl would homogenize gear by necessity of power level restrictions.  This is now a staple of modern WoW and the seasonal 'stat squishes'.
---
These are the types of in-depth problem identification I am looking for from people other than myself in EvE.  
---
This is difficult because it requires people who are not beheld to a single play-style.  Able to see the pros and cons of decisions from multiple perspectives.  
---
EG: Nullification is a game-wide issue.  See: lack of meaningful gate camps as a result.  Combine this with increased wealth and SP resulting in increased JF use, and we see much less travel based killing.  Often times we only see null-sec fleets killed in transit.  Is Tama even camped these days?
---
Another non-trivial issue is one of player knowledge capital.  EvE has always been special because of opSec and entrenched knowledge.  This has been eroding over the years with fleet FC's becoming more experienced, intel networks maturing, and a more open player base willing to share their knowledge.
---
Lol, would be horribly funny
---
that's true, the vigilant definitely seems like a powerful cruiser, but it extremely expensive. Might as well run something t2, or even throw in a lil extra and get a Vedmak.
---
oh fuck
---
I SMELL SALT
---
wow, work the shaft
---
You realize you lost it to us right ? We reinforced it and killed it, NC. warped in at the very end to shoot us and then whored at 1% left on the fort. Look at the damage done...
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/74348346/ Notice how NC. did .01% of the damage at most? They actually made it more difficult to kill because they camped on it for about 5 minutes while the timer just ran down in the beginning. They came back at the end and shot all of our logi with 1-2% left on it while we sacrificed ships to make sure it died. 
---
We never fight outnumbered? Do you not recall a darkness./slyce batphone where you again fed?

If you actually were RMT-ing though, you deserve the ban. CCP doesn't generally do false positives on this shit though. Although I guess given the people you used to deal with, there is a chance you were collateral damage in their investigation into men with names starting with "Az".

---
This warms my heart. 
---
Maybe they can do a tutorial on unfucking your starting overview
---
The signature is high level, so you need good scanning skills, SOE core probes (and SOE core probes launcher if you have the isk for it) to improve the scan strength. If you can, add some scan rangefinding arrays in the mid slots to improve the scan strength even more. And obviously use an explanation frigate that gives you the best bonuses to scanning by skill level.

Trading isn't the best option to make isk. At best you'd probably get 10-20%, but suffice to say, I never really done it. I just looked into it and it seemed not to be worth it. I try to focus on PI and production. If you can put your PI materials into some items, then you're really making a better profit. I make rocket fuel and robotics and use those in my builds to maximize profits. I also do lvl 4 missions for isk, loyalty points, salvage, and items to refine. I trade in LPs for faction ammo (sell those)... I build basic rigs with my salvage (sell those), I refine tech I crap for minerals to build.
---
Assuming you are in hi-sec (0.5+) and your corp is not war-decced, then no one is allowed to attack you unless you attack them. If you shoot someone in a fleet that is suspect/criminal, only that person will have the rights to attack you back. However, logi ships may repair / provide support as long as they don't directly attack you. They will turn suspect and you may engage them as well, but if you do, they may engage back.
---

---
Jita always has 1500 or so people in the system. So there is going to be A LOT of trading going on. Bots included.
---
I dunno, isk tends to kind of snowball after you get to a certain point. 100bn isn't really that hard to make even just ratting or mining and it's still worth around 1k USD from plexes (I realize RMT is less than plex prices). Someone at the apex could make well in excess of that a week through ore buyback, production, marketeering, etc and then it gets tempting when you want that new graphics card or something. Not saying it's happening but even people with jobs can fall victim to it with the massive amount of isk it's possible to make nowadays.

Yes I am serious. L4 missions are in gated deadspace and anoms aren't. L4 missions exist in unlimited supply and (highsec) ratting anoms don't. Ratting gets even better if you're willing to venture outside of highsec.
---
I never talked to you. But listening in to comms I know you helped alot of people and you seemed pretty cool yo ,e. Sorry to see you go.
---
The smartest way to not get caught RMTing is to not RMT
---

---
Combat sites exist in limited supply and are shared by all players. L4s are issued to you alone in unlimited supply.
---
You may run the epic arc every 3 months from the last completed time. Go to your character sheet, go to interactions, then the standings page. Select Servent Sisters of Eve under the faction tab and click on the diamond/star icon on the reputation bar (it will say Epic Arc). That will get you started.

Hmmm, that is actually possible, I think there is a banwave in progress. Maybe, I have no proof either way of course, just my thoughts.

Trading works the same as in real life. The more money you put in the more money get back. So if you are getting a 15% return then if you put in 1mil isk you get back 150k. If you put in 10b you get back 1.5b. So really it just depends on if you like trading and if you have the required money upfront to get back the type of returns you want.
---
enemy ships, not yours
---
OK, hope its resolved by time I wanna get on.
---
I always tried to fly with players better then me and stay on top of the corp killboard.
---
WHERE IS SHE?! 
---
It was more a description of his position than his loan techniques.
---
I like how you put harassment in quotes. I do recall 2004-2009 Eve, where you had shit like groups of players doxing people they didn't like ingame, calling their employers and making accusations about pedophilia and child porn. Among many other frankly disgusting things both in and out of game.
---
Thats why I do a single C5 site throughout the month.
---
you keep them in your hanger and use them to make injecters so new accounts can fly intercepters and light cyno fields for when your rorq fleets needs a protecter
---
Ah, makes sense :)

yeah but you also jump to hostile cyno beacons soooo...

That's an awfully ambiguous way to say "to fight against a gang of 5-10 random ships." It read as "to fly with 4-9 buddies" to me.

---
I was going to get loan for a Levi from Nolak thank fuck I didn’t prolly lose it to ccp ! My karma is going good please down vote !
---
Ultimate Eve end game achievement is how many Rorquals you have going at the same time. I think the current max record is around 150 ish. 150 accounts, ran by 1 dude, and according to him, not botted. I could be wrong though since I haven't paid attention to such things in a long time. 
---
So this is your goal. Ultimate competetive spirit of Eve Online.
---
Yeah at the moment I've got about 20 billion to put into it and am using other income methods to build that amount, and was thinking to aim for something like 10-20% return per week but I guess I'll figure out how realistic that is once I get into it a bit more.
---
Won't be hearing "Do you need a loan?" every other minute in comms now.  Silver lining in everything.
---
I was making 3-6 bil a day scamming in local when I played in college. With margin and contract scams. I ended up selling all the isk on ebay for beer money and got banned though. 
---
the whole Imperium?
---
even SMA???  
---
Wasn't this account banned a few months ago lol
---
How much for the Millennium Falcon?

Maybe cause Nolak helped some of our guys with his loans/habits of coordination home def ?

Jackpot!

Think of all the isk you can lose running them.

Hey m8,
---
Your ideas are in general good and you picked good footage. Your edit could use some fine tuning. In the beginning, your cuts to black, the length feels odd. Either give them more impact or shorten them.
---
Later on you could work with a more consisten pattern of stitching the footage together.
---
And some text on screen would give it some purpose. But it's pretty.

Nah that was your own inference. I was making reference to the fact that 'harassment' is a generic umbrella term that encompasses all manner of things, and as such is not particularly meaningful in itself. 
---
eg: Consider a) Calling someone a fuckwit with no skill, b) telling him you hope he gets cancer and dies, c) exposing his identifying details, and d) slandering him publicly. These are entirely different things of vastly differing severities that could nonetheless all be considered 'harassment'. Which downplays the seriousness of the sort of stuff you were talking about.

Hey Nolak, what's up? - I was thinking about getting back on to see your pretty face, but now...

Yeah, I had some issues with the cuts and getting them to line up how I wanted with the drumbeat and the timing - spent hours fiddling around with it and in the end I gave up and decided I can be more of a perfectionist on the next video! Hopefully we can keep the footage coming, my love of EVE videos and VidBRs is back and I wanna help contribute to EVEs rich lil history with some of my own poorly fought videos!

Keep crying... The way you are performing so far in a month or two there would be no one left from your "agressive PvP" bunch. I know, you came to North because of abundance of content as there was nothing to do in South :)

Im very bad at it

what if i told you when you factor in drone travel time and orbit behavior, hulks manage to mine more than rorqs do already.

I heard sonething about a loan?
---
Thats a lot of kugu posters in this here thread there mr. judith mikakka.
---
Good Fight Hawks! So so close on the first dread that got caught by your triage.
---
Looking forward to the next one, in our home though!
---
You need a loan ;)
---
Nolak was not that kind of a nice guy as everyone pretends. He was maybe entertaining, and the "Do you need a Loan" was a Meme, but at the end he took always nearly 100 Percent Collateral and a decent amount of Interest. 
---
So all the people involved into deals with him are not "free" from their loans, they even lost a big amount of ISK,Collateral etc.
---
100mn AB garmurs
---
Inc before Marshy and Olmeca starting a RMT Campaign in Delve to stop RMT'ing. Like they both used Broadcast Input to stop botting !
---
I mean, if it's a Pornhub vid of Big Barghest Fleet Neuting Over Command Battlecruiser Comp I'd still watch it. 
---
now we know how many globby alts are on reddit 👍
---
I can always get you a loan. Dont need  no shiity rmter
---

:(
---
Yes it does
---
You need a loan?
---
Ccp will tak your money take loans with reputable people like me :)
---
Hah I see what you did there 
---
&gt; I don't think that recruitment culture is the only option they have - I mean, they have this mix of elitists and mass recruiting between their alliances (Imho), so it's not like they can't keep that up to some degree. What they really need is to up their "political game" a bit. The nonsense they did with blueneutraling each other for content isn't exactly how you would fight against goons and the split from GoTG over what happened.. well, I think it's more of an EGO problem at the top than a recruitment programm. 
---
Yeah their politics sucks. From a gameplay style though we've definitely shifted more toward quantity over quality.
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;that's a bad argument though. AT ships are meant to be exclusive. You don't want exclusive stuff to die all the time cause that would mean you would need to seed more of them. So more destruction can only be ensured by usage and you can't have much usage with little ships in circulation.  
---
&gt;So, the idea of having them destroyed more often is against their purpose. The purpose of all other ships (i.e. the ones that can be produced at will) is to get destroyed, so usage (and loss) metrics are a viable argument imho. I don't disagree with ceptors in general either. Less dangerous traveling is an option that has it's place in Eve.
---
I don't disagree but my point is something being used more does not necessarily mean good. Sometimes it's good, other times it's not, but not based on how much something is used.
---
 
---
&gt;I don't necessarily disagree with "field burning", but at some point, it gets unreasonable to me really. Do you really expect that you should be able to cause anything but trivial damage with 4-5 people and that you should be able to cause a lot of damage with few people and easily at that?  
---
&gt;I mean, the odds are stacked against you (defenders advantage) and you stack the odds against yourself by refusing to bring adequate ships and numbers, yet you somehow expect that it should still be viable? Yes, defenders got it easier, but all these advantages come from the fact that they didn't refuse to grow bigger in numbers and ships they can afford to toss at you..  
---
&gt;This notion that "you should be able to cause signifcant damage no matter who the enemy is and how many they are" is something I really can't agree with. If you refuse to use available options, then catering to you won't help unless the advantage is so extremely stacked in your favor that a win for you is pretty much guaranteed...  
---
&gt;So, for me, the solution is not to "give you more advantages untill you can make it" (which is what removing local would be in a lot of cases), and more of a "motivation to get you out of the shell that restricts you", which may or may not be impossible.  
---
&gt;While I am certainly willing to argue about how we could shift some things around to make it more reasonable for both sides, I still see your motivation as one of your biggest disadvantages. Not saying it's all about you, but a major problem is your voluntary exile too. For me, it's only natural that "if your enemy has more people, you should bring more people too" and that "if your enemy uses bigger guns, you should consider bigger guns too".  
---
&gt;yes, there needs to be a place for small gangs, but imho, this place can't be "I killed an alliance worth thousands with a handful of destroyers".
---
I don't think a handful of destroyers should be able to kill an alliance. But for example if we messed with the resources in a system if left unchalleneged. I always want the challenge of someone fighting back. But that won't really happen unless there are consequences for not doing it. Would be fun to "raid for resources."
---
Ok ok 1 tril. 
---
Does that mean you need a loan?
---
Yes
---
Hi!
---
I now know you dont have a spy in goons because you are retarded enough to think nolak was in any leadership role. HAHA
---
I have no idea, I've been winning Eve for the six months, because 1/10 of my shitting on company time profits are still too much to pay for this game.
---
ur really bad at memes
---
I does.
---
I once asked Nolak how long it took someone to pay off a 300b loan when they got it for  a Merlin or rifter  and a ping went out, we happened to join the same op he then starts talking shit about said person who just asked for a loan with zero collateral. I was not asking for a loan merely how long it takes the average person to pay off 300 bill with low collateral and he was just too smug for my taste. You will be forever meme'd in alliance chat you corrupted fallen 💩
---
I'm skeptical, yet intrigued.
---

---
Still not banned
---
It was not that I needed  a loan, I was just curious at the time how long people carried lones with him since he was such a ruthless business man
---
u are right. 
---
Cynabal, without a doubt.
---
Rip u/zintage_enaka he will be missed
---
I was referencing a specific encounter with a player i'd heard of them not engaging a astero because they had a history of pvp, not that they had a history of blopsing or baiting, just that there zkill was at above 90% so he didn't engage.    
---
I'm curious now, which is it? you said zkill wouldn't have an effect on wormholes, now you're flying with a gang will make you not get fights due to zkill  
---
You wanted to say the real RMT lord of goons
---
I've seen players buy up the entire stock of items and simply drop it back on the market at a higher price. Most players won't undercut back to the original, they'll just match your price minus a penny. 
---
It's not compromised.
---
Far stretch there bro, but nice try. Some level 4's can take 30-60 minutes to complete... depending on ship type. The last stage should at the very least give you a chance at a faction drop. Saying combat sites are limited is also not the case. They respawn very often, and almost always easily found in nearby systems. There is NO limit to them. 
---
Ok thanks. I'm seeing a huge increase in baiters shooting down these tractor units.
---
I like to use a 220mm dual-web armor cane. It's specifically designed to fuck up frigates, and could probably pop a dessie gang with good piloting
---
You don't need to be in Jita to modify your order. 
---
I read it as "a gang of 5-10 destroyers/frigates"
---
Careful now, CCP might notice you.
---
TIL that Nolak was a "Goonswarm financial overlord".
---
Amarr is fine if you want to join decent militia corp like DnG for example.
---
But caldari is awful atm.
---
I hated that man to the bottom of my heart. He is the reason I made a 10/10 video on youtube. He was charging people for "information" and "fits" on how to do it because they would heave been "stealing" from him by doing the 10/10s so he wanted to make money out of it. Total piece of shit. I'm glad he's headshotted.
---
did someone say party?!
---
&gt; You reference our crabbing alts in an attempt to inflate the size of our actual fighting Force.
---
Could have saved us all a lot of cringy reddit posts during the blue donut wars, if you had told the rest of TRI not to count crabbing alts as fighting force.
---
A tale of twists and turns (aka a totally not biased AAR)
---
**PART 1 - THE DRAGGENING**
---
NV jump into LZHX home with a fully formed fleet, closing the hole behind them. Part way through jumping in (to ensure mass limits were fully utilised) LZHX caps start to land on the hole at 0. After immedietly as they warped NV bubbled grid and managed to drag the LZHX subcap fleet from the cap grid. In this time NV pressured LZHX Phoenix resulting in the [Phoenix entering low structure](https://i.imgur.com/03z8FhZ.png) and being caught with triage at the end of siege.
---
**PART 2 - THE BLAP BEGINS**
---
Barghest torpedo volley, with perfect application, is over 10k per boat, with 17 Barghests, a Golem and the Phoenix this is near enough to volley potential on the LZHX platforms in a Pulsar. Between this and the large Pulsar neut pressure from the Barghests on the LZHX triage, 13 Nighthawks, 3 Claymores, 2 Shield-Bhaals, 3 HICs and a Jamming-Tengu were lost on the LZHX side. During this time LZHX focused the NV Dread pilot, [who attempted multiple coasts out of siege](https://i.imgur.com/AiZYzkV.jpg) whilst his refuelling truck (a bustard) attempted to refuel him. During this time, LZHX Tengus caused considerable misery for NV Barghest pilots through ECM.
---
**PART 3 - CCP STRIKES BACK**
---
Whilst the NV Barghests were breaking LZHX subcaps, a catastrophic server crash occured and at least 80% of both fleets suffered disconnects, including the NV triage. Fortunately neither side lost ships during this break and things got mostly back underway after both fleets were able to log in.
---
**PART 4 - A FLURRY OF BOOSHES**
---
As LZHX lost subs, they reshipped those that weren't podded (as we were fighting in their home) into additional subs, including a large number of command destroyers. These caused some catastrophic positioning issues for NV who lost their kill potential from falling below the required alpha threshold. No NV mainline ships were lost during this time, but the lack of ships on the grid meant neither side lost any ships and both sides continued to burn through cap charges on their capitals. 
---
**PART 5 - A HERO DIES**
---
After being primaried for the best part of 45 minutes, the NV Phoenix dies during a coast attempt after [taking an astonishing 14.7m damage](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75277045/). Shortly after the Phoenix dies the Barghests are still able to break a few more LZHX subcaps, A Tengu, 2 Nighthawks, 2 Golems and a [Drake](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75277115/). However without the damage pressure from their Phoenix NV knew they would not be able to break hostile capitals and things got desperate as cap charges started getting low.
---
**PART 6 - THE COUNTER BLAP**
---
LZHX prepared target painting Golems (who were quickly primaried and destroyed) as well as painting and webbing Hyena's at range, this, coupled with the Pulsar effect and large signature of a shield Battleship meant that XL Phoenix torps were able to apply to NV Barghests, volleying 6 NV Barghests and the [NV Golem](https://i.imgur.com/KEZp19s.png) in quick succession whilst LZHX lost some of their remaining subcaps. In addition to the Phoenix alpha, LZHX brought a small wing of 6 Arty Tornadoes to aid with the volleying and a few more ships via a direct HS wormhole in their home.
---
**PART 7 - THE EXTRACTION ... ATTEMPT**
---
With the situation quickly turning sour for NV, an attempt was made to extract the triage and the remaining subcaps. Just as triage was about to end a LZHX sabre landed and bubbled the NV Minokawa, which immedietly re-triaged to try and keep NV subcaps alive. At this point NV attempted to extract their remaining Barghests and support and get about half of them out and leave the [Minokawa to its fate](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75277426/).

How rich are we talking here? I'm genuinely curious. I thought was the guy who was collecting all limited issue ships. Forgot his name but it's not Aryth.
---
You must control the spice. 
---
You know what the actual funny part about that is? I'm the person who taught him how to run 10/10's, for free. He had the nerve to ask me to stop giving people in theta help and advice about them so that he could start charging.
---
Iirc, Aryth controls moongoo market of whole whole new Eden Or something
---
If Nolak was rmt'ing he deserved getting kicked even though he seemed like a okay guy. But we all know Mar5hy is input broadcasting by how he launches bombs, but he is still here, and I assume you are okay with that right? Oh nevermind, I forgot proof is needed, well maybe some of us would like proof that Nolak was actually wrong too.
---
no, highsec pocket near amarr fw.
---
Not the only one with lots of these either.
---
There is only ISK&lt;&gt;PLEX inflation, and his statement is based on the always assumption that PLEX is better value store than ISK.  This is predicated on the idea that PLEX is the only inflating item in eve, not isk.  But keep being shit at the economy.
---
4-6hrs/day for 14 days for a mere 2b seems sorta low dude. Don't do this shit to yourself please.
---
I doubt he got Blocked from making new account, considering iwi people were allowed too, unless something changed
---
Well that's running just combat anoms/sigs and a lot of that is probably spent goofing off in chat. Actual site running is probably idk 2hr/day.
---
Duh, ScFI

GF guys, most fun I've had in a while!
---
༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ
---
This is why I dislike people recommending station trading for isk. 
---
You need one of 2 things to make it worth it. A shit ton of isk, a shit ton of order slots or a shit ton of time playing 0.01 isk game. 
---
Look at the price chart for any given item. Every day prices will go up and down. As long as you have enough buy orders out there you’ll naturally pull in items and sell items as that natural fluctuation happens. You only need to update your orders if a price is on a permanent trend up or down but that still isn’t every time somebody beats your offer by 0.01. This is why I say you need a shit ton of orders. 
---
The other ways around this are with a shit ton of isk to just buy out entire markets and manipulate them at your own will. Or you can try and keep up with the never ending 0.01 isk. 
---
People still upvote the fun at parties shit?
---
i like my huwai watch 2 also KOA HI!
---
Hardly.
---
Aryth has what, maybe 10 tril? Let's go with that as a safe estimate.
---
At $3 a bil, you can RMT about 500bil a month. If you go higher, it takes even longer. So at that price-point, you're looking at 20 months to RMT 10 tril.
---
And you only get $30,000 from it.
---
+1 very nice
---
Then why not scan down and run combat signatures exclusively?

Tho that doesn't sound so good anymore considering the circumstances.
---
wait so like 6 months for 10k? shit sign me up, especially if I was cashing out of eve.
---
If I use EC-300 to jam an enemy ship, can that ship shoot me, or just the drone that did the jamming? I can't find a clear source online after the changes and want to know if they are any use in 1v1 PVP anymore (meant to break Vedmak spooling).

---
I mine with 3 rorqs and 3 hulks, max boosted, +5% implants, max yield fit (t2 strips with t2 crystals with 3x t2 mlu), exhumers 4, mining drone spec 4, and drone interfacing 5 on all 3 hulks.
---
I've run the experiment of having all 6 mine the same ore type over a period of time. The math that a max skill rorq is about 2.7x max boosted hulks is more or less correct. Even with travel time. 
---
The advantage of hulks is that they don't need to move (great for picking off all the snall rocks). I've been meaning to work out how much productivity is lost in repositioning the rorqs, but I don't think it can be much more than about 5 minutes of downtime every hour. I think maybe I'll work that out tonight.
---
You are thinking of Entity I believe was his name. 
---
I believe you underestimate his wealth by a large amount.

I didn't factor in price elasticity however and that's a big point.

More like you are about to lose 20 bil plus your collateral.
---
The same reason not everyone just doesn't VNR rat in null sec. You do play this game right? 
---
I don't know what iwi means, but when it comes to banning, there are different types. Some folks get their account banned, but only that account, and are free to create more. Others, such as in this case, they are banning the person. So no more accounts. Any account that they even suspect is his in future will get blapped. This is same type of thing they did with gigX.
---
Why, so CCP could take your ISK and you still be out collateral?
---
Is that near Dodixie?
---
Rus Rus as alwaya
---
Do you actually do loans though?
---
How exactly do you fit that?
---
PLEX is about the only thing I'd avoid scamming with. I figure fucking with CCP's money is a good way to attract the wrong sort of attention from them. 
---
I do but only with some people.
---
You could see his entire screen he didn't even have them up so he could see them and was too busy ratting to even check them. 
---
And they fed another redeemer and a tengu this morning to the same rats. Its not an exploit to use legit game mechanics to kick someones ass.

---
That bit killed me. :D
---
I must be wrong then.
---
Multi-boxing incursions was the best.  I had an industry alt that literally couldn't fly much beyond an ibis that made over 15b over the course of a month or so just afking on gates.  Bonus points when my corpmate would let me afk alts while he was doing it and I was out soloing in lowsec.
---
EPIC!
---
Eh, only in terms of super rare items (AT ships basically) and account services.
---
Coming back after five years of not playing, virtually everything dropped in price. Faction ships, faction/deadspace mods, T3 ships, capitals, super capitals, minerals. The only items that went up are PI and T2, both because of industry changes.
---
Just like rorqual miners forget to turn off isboxers ?
---
Iwi was not blocked for rmt was it ?
---
One of my favorite things 
---
Unless CCP fixed it recently: you can join caldari and awox amarr pilots without any penalty to standings. That way you can still have lots of pvp targets and can run plexes and earn caldari LP doing minmatar plexes. And some of the amarr pilots don't have you on their overview :-)
---
im from Goons and I wish you kill more of em'
---
Why did GSF blacklist Azathio?
---
Also that, it's a shame :(
---
Given the way Aryth dominates particular segments of the moon goo market, I would guess he has no need to RMT.
---
I do not see a downside in that
---
They're cancer tbh
---
Given Aryth's leverage in the market and already considerable wealth, along with his long-term financial planning, he's the last person I'd suspect for RMT, but I also thought somewhat the same about Nolak so who knows
---
10+ Trillion
---
CCP took all stations and gates away. The only thing you can warp to is this dreadful shit?
---
Nolak was the bro who got me into eve. Sadness. A good guy
---
If you aggress another player you and he will have a limited engagement timer with each other for 5 minutes where both of you can freely shoot each other. Doesn't matter if how you aggress him and jamming drones definitely count.
---
Funny how goons have all the RMTers.

How about a proper beginner overview ffs; when recruiters want newbeans we know how to find them and we'll teach them

---
If you're sitting in fleet with someone and they commit a criminal act, will you also be flagged just for being in fleet?
---
An addition to this is if your safety is set to green, is there a circumstance you could be flagged as a suspect or criminal? (Assuming you don't have killrights on yourself that could be activated)
---
Any kiting ship with enough speed/dps. If brawling then those cap battery stable fits.
---
My vote is a Macharial if you expect to brawl against 1500-2000 dps. Nightmare for 2000-2500. Rattle for 2500-3000.
---
Above that you need a Marauder to tank (or retarded amounts of bling) 
---
If you’re expecting less than 1700 max then I’d say a Prophecy brick tanked if they aren’t kitey. You’ll die but if you take 5-7 T1 or 2-3 T2 frigs with you you’re isk positive. 
---
An MJD nano Bhaalgorn if you can hit 360 noscopes.
---
All this depends on not getting dropped by caps though vOv. 
---
No, you can't be punished for the actions of your fleetmates under crimewatch.
---
You can't shoot another player or activate an AOE weapon with safety set to green. The option to steal from cans is shut off. The safety has no known flaws. 
---
Ah, so that's probably why he got blacklisted.
---
dual ASB Vargur or Cruise Golem
---
Nope. Wet is a property of non-liquids that are in contact with liquids. 
---
Think losing collaterals and risking wallet zap of innocent loaners falls under goonfucking.
---
If PLEX is always increasing in value but ISK is not decreasing in value, PLEX is deflating, not inflating.
---
It's more likely EVE ISK is losing value though, as PLEX is pegged to various currencies, meaning the EVE ISK to USD "exchange rate" is getting worse.

Nice vid. When you say you had issues lining up the cuts and the drum beats, do you mean your timing felt off? Most good editing software has options where you can extend out the clips so instead of seeing something like this: [https://i.imgur.com/fNw6uRq.png](https://i.imgur.com/fNw6uRq.png) you see this: [https://i.imgur.com/8Hg0Hkb.png](https://i.imgur.com/8Hg0Hkb.png) which you can then cut at specific noises just visually like this: [https://i.imgur.com/O1S3NZK.png](https://i.imgur.com/O1S3NZK.png) and then you can match up your video starting point with the sounds like this: [https://i.imgur.com/Rx8VKM6.png](https://i.imgur.com/Rx8VKM6.png) . Not sure if thats what you meant by lining things up or if any of those pictures make sense to you, but basically zooming in on your audio will enable you to make cuts when actual sound starts by eye instead of by ear.

Six destroyed FRT Rorquals in one TEST strike, yikes.
---
Wow I have 2 million and had a item drop tonight that sold for 1 mill I thought I beat the game....
---
Wow you have killed 6 rorquals with 180 people .. totally worth a post .. nbsi groups do that aswell
---
Domi's? I can fly domi's.
---
calm your tits
---
So, if I am reading this right, you find the amount of work you have to put in to destroy another player under particular conditions to be out of reach of the casual player.  Let's take a look at the pertinent conditions for a moment.
---
Your target is flying a Titan under the protection of a major nullsec Alliance.  The Alliance in question has [literally](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/Goonswarm_Federation) [thousands](https://eve.fandom.com/wiki/Goonswarm) [of](https://imperium.news/alliance-profile-goonswarm-federation/) [characters](https://www.invenglobal.com/articles/780/eve-onlines-goonswarm-greets-2017-as-largest-player-guild-in-history-of-gaming) from which to draw defenders of every stripe.  This includes people reporting and collating information on the location of neutral and hostile pilots in particular systems, and arranging for active fleets of defenders on standby to respond to aggressors.  And you managed to bypass all of these manhours dedicated to defending players just like this "Pleb," with the efforts of a few dozen characters?  Perhaps less?  Good on you, but why should we encourage CCP to make thousands of man hours less effective than dozens of manhours when it comes to offense/defense?  If that many players wish to unite for their common defense, shouldn't they be able to get some results when opposed by much smaller player blocks?
---
Guess Test is pissed about losing the komodo eh
---
Are you here just to advertise your awful br site?
---
Thank you for your reply!
---
What an Edge Lord
---
Lenny was a a well paid DoD contractor with literally no reason to RMT and yet he did so never discount what people will do just because they can.
---
Oh, if he’s camping a relic site for explorers, that makes sense. If you fit to be able to lock as soon as possible after dropping cloak, carry multiple scrams and a web, in addition to an AB/mwd of your own, you’re not actually going to have a very good ship for pvp. What you will have is a ship that is impossible to escape from, no matter how well the explorer is fit for running away. I can see someone not engaging a astero suspected to be combat fit/bait in anything below a t3c, since if you drew your fit up for a different scenario, while the Astero is anticipating this exact situation, you will probably lose, even with something like a stratios. 
---
I wouldn’t expect someone to base their decision to engage based on all pvp, though, at least I just scan killboards for kills/losses involving exploration ships. Making a judgment of all time kills is pointless, because zkill is actually a pretty terrible reflection of how good you are. 
---
r\gatekeeping ?
---
Why would some actually consider mining in highsec if you can make 15-25m a tick passiv an VNI in nullsec Oo 
---
AAR, Seadooski (™) and his mom formed Goku fleet, we go through the still broken WHs system and burn to 15U-JY in Fountain and blap an Init. Rorq and a few of his buds show in Ferox, so they die, too. - 4.5b https://zkillboard.com/related/30004611/201902220400/ .. then we go back o the broken WH place and sit on the sun, grab food and drinks, pee, poo and wait 10 mins for more F1. Seadooski leads us all to glory and the scouts find new FRT Rorqs in Detorid to kill, so we kill 6 more and assorted tackle, Jackdaws .. -36b more for the bad men. https://zkillboard.com/related/30000465/201902220500/ .. we burn back to Immensea and high five. Thanks FC o7

This event, the Guardian Gala, features assorted NPC pirates who remember last year's Guardian Gala, and have prepared for party crashers.  The NPC flotillas are not very predictable in precise makeup, and the sites randomly include over the top NPCs that seem to be giving the solo play crowd fits.  The loot from the sites includes large amounts of mining a special ore type to acquire even small amounts of the relevant refined material, which is needed both to manufacture the dropped blueprints for a Booster, and to purchase random entries off of a loot table, with no guarantee that the loot will be worth your time and effort.
---
The event is difficult, and does not simply print money the way other events have.   There is even an explicit ISK sink as part of the site. It also is aimed at people who can bring serious firepower to bear, such as by bringing friends, but the loot is not easily divisible.
---
That AAR \^
---
Much respect 😎
---
This was a little project of mine for a week, just bored so mind as well write something. Hopefully you like it!
---
A disease for fighting bots/rmt? Why?
---
He's never approached being the "wealthiest individual in eve", he does have an awesome collection though.
---
I believe his inventory website is down still. I remember him saying he doubted he was going to put it back up on reddit a few years ago, when it originally went down.
---
No wonder the Mino died, Amon wasn't piloting it.
---
Looks like a great fight! Waiting for the video.
---
Its almost like, Bombers are really effective against rorqs :O 
---
Color me impressed

Do you see people defending nolak in this thread? 
---
confirmed. I took a poop that made me question my sexual orientation. 
---
So you *have* pooped so hard it felt kinda gay. Congrats, bro. Creecher will want to talk to you about that in detail at the next Eve Vegas.

He's a good dude.
---
This is gonna be awkward when that one year reminder I setup in 2018 that says "loan" pops up in Elysium though...
---
someone lend me a Rattlesnake and ill run ALL OF EM 
---
Oh tapi downvotesquad isn’t happy someone killing 6 rorquals with 180 isn’t anything special :(
---
Haw Phoenix 
---
The spice must flow.
---
wasn't he a KF director at the very least? (i might be misremembering.) anyway, he was part of the inner circlejerk. really annoying nasal voice too that i'm glad we won't have to hear anymore. bet he thought loaning was the perfect cover-up for RMT.
---
Downvotes are the new upvotes. so'k. They're the most read comments. 
---
Could be that I misremember but I remember the feeling that "this feels a bit pricy for getting blown up in a couple of seconds". True I'm a poor pilot and a bit cheap :P Might be that I added T2 drones and as you say, those are expensive :P 
---
i mean ... it really isnt, that was bomber bar's thing for a long time, kill a hand full of rorqs w/ 200 dudes in bombers      
---
id be way more impressed if this was 200 T2 cruisers or heck, 200 stabbers doing this... but bombers? wich can be bridged by a covert ops?    
---
pretty darn boring if you ask me 
---
Good job CCP! Next will be merkelchen.
---
+ they prob. use blue cynos aswell 
---
Saw a couple fun videos a while back on frigate swarms getting swatted by blaster Tengus.
---
CCP screwed up event balance, prices are fubar.
---
having followed his advice, i'd say it's very accurate
---
Going to go a long long ways towards caldari/gallente titan 5
---
CCP doesn't ban for sharing GM conversations, unless you are editing them or quoting out of context specifically to make CCP look bad.

Yeah, but there are degrees of idiocy, surely we can can agree on that.

I mean, a week?
---
You must be a heavy procrastinator in college
---
&gt;Are you a wormholer or nullseccer?
---
&gt;Wormholer
---
&gt;That alone makes you better than most :)
---
Has there ever been a better example of the elitist wormholerbtw mentality?
---
Yep, ccp seem to be making it harder and harder to obtain the accelerators in each successive event.
---
Are you selling?
---
hey Nico! You uh... you want to go bowling?
---
Why did you censor the total balance?
---
hahahahaahaha  nice  for you

Titan?

Yea it's still down.

Lul who these dudes thanking him for loaning their friends/corpmates isk? Sure thank the guy charging ripoff interest to your friends.
---
Fuck this dude.
---
It's battle. War would be something bigger.
---
Because he was in goons it will be a rogue individual, had this been someone on the other side it would be proof of institutionalised RMT.
---
wat happened!?
---
All liquid or also assets? That's an insane number! 
---
Coming from CODE.. I'm sure you have absolutely 0% vested interest in people hauling. 
---
&gt; actually hunting down rmters
---
heh, funny
---
If only people burning out could stop shitting on games  they used to like.. what would reddit be like?
---
Just checked and the site is still down, but I did find a screenshot of someones stable in 2016 and it's... well it's a lot of ships.
---
https://imgur.com/IBxK6UD
---
Yes, but you can have 2 alts in mackinaws ships following you ... just inject them ....
---
Except you can be easily proven false. 
---
Every feature CCP continues to release then abandon for no apparent reason proves you incorrect every time it happens(most recently npc FOB's).
---
Your attempt at white knighting just makes the situation worse, people like you won't just admit that there is indeed a problem that the company refuses to acknowledge.
---
That cat needs a diet. 
---
enjoy your ban :P
---
Lol half these ships that people are suggesting will never track or apply to frigs. If your fighting alot of frigs and dessies I would use a 100mn t3 cruiser probably a Loki or maybe a legion with rlml and webs. Another good option if you are looking for something cheaper would be an xlasb osprey navy though that would be a tough fight. Retribution is also really good at this you just have to kite well and pray that no t2 minmitar ships show up. 
---
Shocker 
---
I guess that old saying is true: "more money, more problems".
---
Can't be. The official narrative is that rorqs and panic mods are op and can't be killed by subs and need to be nerfed into the floor. BR must be a fake.
---
I agree peoples get bored but it's because from many years we get a lot less real new content than in Apocrypha times ;(
---
Can we just stop feeding for like 1 day. We now have no super fleet and no pulsar fleet. What's tomorrows feed confessors in a wr. 
---
Does anyone else see the irony in all of these complaint posts complaining about all the complaint posts on r/eve?
---
Mixed feelings, I can't be happy about panda slaughter but I'm happy about crab slaughter.
---
If I recall correctly the source for him being a "well paid DoD contractor" was himself and the claim was made in the context of and to support his "didn't do nuffin" argument
---
Not exactly the most credible bit of information I've seen in my lifetime
---
This is why it bothers me that I can't play in UZTZ that often, I miss these roams. Nice! (:
---
He's on a diet but refuses to lose weight :S
---
When you run an angel 10/10 ded site there is an incredibly tanky structure that drops loot. I ran my first one today in a rattle and I think I could have taken it down in about 2 hours and 10k missiles. I watched a video of the site ran and he refitted to torps and took it down but he didn't talk and i couldnt make out what was inside. It kinda looked like an extra overseers effects but what tier was it? Is there an extra chance for faction spawn in there? Because i got nothing but base loot on my first run which was sad :( does anyone have stats on that guy? I tried to find it on chruker but found it difficult to navigate. Thanks
---
Considering all of them were paid back, it would be very bad business for me :D
---
A bored playerbase is still a very bad thing for Eve, and CCP alike. 
---
but are you vegan?

So basically your sovereignty claim on Pure Blind is based on discussing that you cry to NC/Ranger Regiment less often than Pure Blind residents cry to Snuff/INIT, am I understanding this correctly?
---
Lmao big yikes. 
---
Dropping features left and right then never going back to them isn't how you keep a game relevant. Being frustrated by a product as a customer is entitled whining you dumbass. 
---
Keep defending the 16 year old game that can't manage a simple in game chat system.
---
Crazy talk. Next you'll tell me if I don't want to get a DUI I shouldn't drink and drive. Psh.
---
I dunno, I don't think there are a thousand real people in SkillU.
---
You are pretty much spot on. And you can confirm the TZ tanking on dotlan. No need to fly up to Pure Blind unless you want in on some of the action ;)
---
It's actually called GSM, for Goonswarm Stellar Management.  
---
this is what happens when an event is so fkn bad that mo one wants to run it.
---
Lets go down the list to see how things have only gotten more boring. 
---
1. Burning your enemy to the ground.
---
- Burning a POS used to take at most 48 hours. -- Now it takes a week with an extra timer and damage caps.
---
- Killing a station used to allow 100% asset denial and or force massive firesales for the benefit of the attacker. -- Now players just casually asset saftey. 
---
-Locking people out of staging in a region with limited moons.  Now we have Infinite anchor positions and geography in space is even more homogenized.  
---
-Hell camping is now impossible.
---
2. Getting casual fights.
---
-Null sec entrances used to boast easy small gang content. Now with interdicted interceptors its practically barren in comparison.
---
-small gangs fighting / camping on outposts used to be a thing. Now we have citadels which vaporize anything but a fleet. We also have tethering. 
---
3. Capitals
---
-capitals used to have a niche of structures bashing / anti capital ganks. Now they are used to kill even frigates. 
---
People do not get over EVE that easily. I have constant urges to come back and I imagine many others in my position do also. But we take the time to think about how it has only become more frustrating and more of a hassle to play. 
---
Eve is supposed to be a hardcore PVP game for fucks sake. There is a place for crabs in EVE but jesus christ without us crazy autistic psychopathic PVPers your experience will become hallow and pointless.
---
Is ice wet? 
---
I laughed too hard
---
Great catch fellas!
---
Shhh! Don't tell them!
---
Safe for later comment 
---
If old school runescape can be flourishing at this point in time, there is literally no reason to give ccp the "old game, not gonna get better" pass. CCP can do better, we should expect that from them.
---
Are you planning on doing anything with that isk at least ?
---
Pathetic white knight copypasta.
---
It's a necessary evil as they eluded to in their recent security post. There needs to be consequences to alliances and corps who benefit from RMTers. I hear it's frowned upon to report blues for botting (because it benefits your group) but if the ban hammer is blunt and punishes all who benefit from them it encourages people to not harbour cheaters and face the consequences of doing so. So I wouldn't be surprised if the same thinking is used for RMT. Basically if you don't wonna take the risk don't take the ISK.
---
Who the fuck only makes 30 mil an hour mining in null? Are they on the asteroid with a fucking pickaxe or something?
---
Running a 10 hours fireplace video instead of eve.
---
u not bob
---
Ask your alliance. Nobody here has any idea what your corp/alliance does.
---
Who knows, if I make enough boatloads (literally?) of it, I may invests in more Omega time so I can continue to haul in all teh orez in a barge. Not quite sure yet, though. I'm sure I'll do something with it eventually.
---
why? if people didn't haul, what would code do?
---
*snicker* Fair enough.
---
was hoping for a 200men bomber fleet vs random caps but was dissapointed by seeing this was an intense fight with skill and bling
---
&gt;  This includes people reporting and collating information on the location of neutral and hostile pilots in particular systems,
---
- One can bypass intel by afk camping or wh ragerolling. Either way, it's not accessible to disorganized hunting groups. Meanwhile, instant intel via local has always been controversial. People who successfully bypass intel and local are putting way more effort than people relying on near2 and one of his thousand buddies' report which took 1 second.
---
&gt; arranging for active fleets of defenders on standby to respond to aggressors.
---
I have np with active subcap fleets. Delve has plenty of those and I think regions should depend more on those. They deter many kinds of hunters. The problem is with supercap umbrellas.
---
&gt; Thousands of man hours
---
Umbrella maintenance does not take man-hours. It's basically enough for you to have 5-10 titans/supers and some faxes on at a given time. What matters is your capability to escalate via pings. But simply having people who can log in at an instant is not effort. It's merely existing as a blob.
---
&gt; why should we encourage CCP
---
Here is the breaking point. If you equate safety to net man hours, and have no other diminishing return for growing larger, you create a self fulfilling prophecy in which the largest alliance puts more net man hours to its space's safety, then it's space becomes safer, then more people moving in, then even more safety. That's exactly what we have seen in the game last few years. If you design your game in which the largest group is predetermined to exponentially grow to be larger and stronger, that's not exactly a vibrant and interesting game.
---
&gt; If that many players wish to unite for their common defense, shouldn't they be able to get some results
---
I never defended that organization and effort should go unrewarded. But there needs to be balancing factors. For example, effort per capita should matter more than net effort. Regions like Delve lose below 5% of all their farm as content to hunters of PvE ships (mining, anomaly farming or otherwise). In the least organized regions, this ratio is about 15-18%. If I was CCP, I'd aim to make these ratios about 15% in the safest regions, and 25% in the least safe ones. Imagine it as a content tax. Organization still matters in that you lose less ships. But then you still have to pay a minimum tax for the game's health. One person's super killmail is often 50 people's reason to play for an entire night. That's how you keep people playing Eve. By catalyzing content and explosions. Goons too, could go and kill other people more easily in a system like what I have in mind.
---
If only it didn't take 100+ poeple 
---
wowza v impressive stuff !!
---
Garbage attempt 
---
&gt; Being frustrated by a product as a customer isn't entitled whining you dumbass.
---
You know you can always stop buying that product, that could send the right message. :D 
---
By the way, crying about this on reddit is definitely the right way to change CCP attitude, so keep up the good work, it is bound to pay off big time! Soon! I promise!
---
&gt; Keep defending the 16 year old game that can't manage a simple in game chat system.
---
Yes, sir! I will, sir!
---
mining an entire site by yourself will not give you enough of the mineral even with great refine skills to build even the shittiest booster.

as the most famous ISK famer in world, no one pays attention to chinese and russians. i just want to say RMT everywhere every minute and every second.
---
wow, what could wrong with no supercap umbrella. your missing the point of how pointless the Tapi post is. 
---
" I've pulled in about 200mill ISK in just a few days  " That's a few hours in nullsec and code doesn't go to null keep tabs on the intel channel and you can still afk for the most part.

---
The first few books are really good. The eighties movie is rad.   
---
I think the mini series was also awesome. 
---
The 80s movie from David Lynch is far from the books and was screwed up by production company cutting. Lynch made an 5+ hr epos that was cut to 2 hrs ripping the story. But the Actors/Characters and the classic "Lynch" atmosphere still make it worth a try. If you read the books before you wil be disappointed maybe. I hope for the new project currently ongoing, as they promised to go straight by the written story of Frank Herbert.
---
Obviously brigaded post for 35b of rorqs in 2019 is pretty cringe don't you think?
---
I wonder if they get fined 1B per rorq...
---
Yes. Depends. Yes.
---
Entity owns the single examples of a lot of unique ships too, where value is almost impossible to measure as they are one of a kind now (pretty sure he has a few that are?) been ages though. Sold him some stuff once for the collection. 
---
Move to lawless nullsec under some big alliance's supercap umbrella. Fit a cyno. Use the alliance's intel tool to alert you when any baddies are within 3 jumps of you. 
---
Compared to highsec you'll be safer and you'll make a lot more isk.
---
big shout out to the tackle pilots tackling stationary targets and to the 160 bombers shooting pixels
---
That isn't Entity's collection.
---
Maybe you should try playing with him more so he gets exercise. Don't wanna see you lose your kitty prematurely!

Now how about you find one that isnt shit fit and link it? [https://zkillboard.com/kill/74404931/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/74404931/). Easily tanked a 100 man fleet for 45 mins till 100 more showed up

---
Exploration in high sec is probably more chilled
---
Right. Which makes me wonder how much larger his would be. I've never seen so many ships or so much asset ISK in one menu like that.
---
Oh, so stuff like that Golden Magnate. Man... would love to just see what his collection looks like!
---
i know the guy, he was afk shitting, thats all
---
exploration is something i find pretty chill if you eventually burn out on mining, i do that mining, and VNI ratting in null. 
---
That's the kinda perspective I was hoping to get. Thanks for the heads up! Looks like I got a book I need to find. 
---
Well his collection was worth well over a trillion, though most of that value was through unique ships so the menu system wouldn't price them appropriately. Still, last I saw his collection he was running into the tens of thousands of items or something, he had at least one of basically every officer mod. Insane amount of junk. 
---
Ratting in Delve under Imperum umbrella. 
---
VNI and chill, about a mil/hour and plenty of fun in local with other semi-afk miners/ratters. :)
---
Oh he gets played with, and races with the other kitty all day!
---
You could just rip the character models from Eve and create some ~~porn~~ artwork.
---
Ya know, you can score some karma with him if you get a girl to hold him and take a pic over at /r/GirlsWithHugePussies 
---
Anyways, hope Mr. Kitty gets on track and has a long life! 
---
CCP does. 
---
They just play the race card when you say anything about it and gets you mass downvotes on r/eve. 
---
Wow you're like the opposite of me, i was glad i could go mine in null :)
---
I just love the flames of a Rorq in siege mode
---
Grapple+Web Vargur. Things die.
---
For each one of those braindead rorq pilots there are a few dozen others that are practically untouchable because they're doing things right. Can't really show you those because you don't get a survivedmail for fitting a tank or lighting a cyno properly.
---
I mean seriously, *large* shield extenders, empty low slots, T1 *non-meta* nav comps, are you fucking serious?
---
That bit about how roaming used to be fun exactly. I ‘member only Razor once dropped caps on our roaming fleet. Rest was good fun fights.
---
Even Brave carebears now drop there capitals on roaming fleets because they dont have the same value as they did.
---
Sucked all the fun out of null.
---
I like low sec exploration for chill gaming.  There's loads of empty distance  areas where no one bothers to go.  I do it in an astero for ultimate stealth/slipperiness  and just casually farm low end stuff.
---
Na, I just kept deleted and doing it again.
---
Haha, gotta do that!

I will pass the well wishes forward!

I'll pay some attention to it but I've mostly seen players mining them (I think... you've made me think now whether they were really players or not), mostly in fleets of ventures with an orca or just solo people in Retrievers or other mining ships.
---
wasnt it 110% collat
---
Ive known alot of people who take eve as relaxing. Just in highsec mining. Sometimes doing homework or working
---
When you're talking about game balance, yeah. Exactly that.
---
Otherwise I can go shitfit any overpowered ship and suicide it into some newbros, here look at this killmail, OP ship died so it's obviously balanced. Case closed.
---
Get a grip man. 
---
A rl friend of mine is playing as an "indie", he's very loosely connected to my current corp, but he prefers to stick to himself. He's running missions and trades quite a lot. I am just loosely cooperating with him, I have a few alts parked in his 2 men corp, which I am using as highsec outlets for my weekly loot. Together we're analysing and speculating on price developments and so on.
---
It is possible as an indie to get by, but it's kinda difficult.
---
But gotta take in consideration of some nostalgia goggles on.not to take away too much of a game thats loved but partial has to do with nostalgia.
---
Find something to buy and then somewhere to sell that at a higher price. Or look at courrier contracts.
---
Yes, if you want Max ticks and an extra horrible kill mail
---
Is there any kind of online tool to check prices of things?
---
What is a  rough estimation on profit from doing PI in nullsec with 6 characters maxed skills? 
---
Then you wouldn't have this thread and the ++ posts, good guy  [d00mdark](https://www.reddit.com/user/d00mdark) even provides you with reddit content to retort
---
i swear this sub is getting closer and closer to SC levels of shill....
---
https://evepraisal.com/ Allow you to check the Jita price of many items. I'm sure there are other sites but to be fair, figuring out the way to make a profit is suppose to be the interesting part, because hauling is boring and slow as fuck.
---
agree. Real men love brawl
---
preach it brother. this game is done. will never recover, too much mechanical and technical debt.
---
apex legends is actually quite a lot of mini sandbox fun 
---
A battle would imply a single instance of combat or a skirmish.
---
This has been a protracted period of combat that has gone on for several months.
---
When was this clip taken?

I really need how to know how to truck, never did it, but everytime i think i want to go back to new eden i think about space trucking... But in the end i never do it

As long as you're enjoying yourself, you're exactly where you need to be. 
---
Its not just a value thing- Most people are completly incompetent when it comes to piloting anything these days. If they dont have an fc to babysit absolutly everything for them they just wont do anything. So naturally they go for the I-Win-Button that is caps 
---
Holy shit you made me laugh a lot having been on a few PGL fleets, though he did actually look after me once by name.   I rather like him.
---
  Just like you, I chose Amarr several years ago for the design of the ships and lore and never looked back.
---
I never felt a limitation in any case and they have ships to do everything you want. Of course, they might not always be the best but as an average / casual player, I do not care. I am not sure I would notice the difference.
---
My advice: fly what you want to fly. At the end of the day, for me, what matters is that I am having fun in this game and doing what I want to. This is in my opinion the beauty of sandbox games like Eve - freedom.
---
What I like about Amarr in PVE: no need to carry ammunitions with lasers. As long as your capacitor is up your are in the game.
---
I hope you ain't a handy man 
---
Good one
---
&gt; With lasers seeming to be Amarr only, there is no cross benefit like Hybrid weapons with Gallante and Caldari so training into new faction ships would be more painful. 
---
I want to add a little to this since it's not quite true. Most of your training time for a certain weapon type goes into it's support skills. For lasers you want to train all these support skills for turrets which perfectly applies to other turrets like hybrid and projectiles too. 
---
So even if you want to start out with Amarr and lasers and later decided you like to try some blaster fits, all you need is to train that specific gun skill and you're good to go. The only exception to this are missiles since they have their own group of support skills. 
---
And as others said, Amarr is usually fine. Flying something you love is better than flying something you hate but is marginally better. 
---
I am, quite. Thank you. :)
---
Yeah, if I just want to relax and veg, I can just sit back in my chair and close my eyes. But typically, I'm working in some fashion while I mine. It's nice to be able to multitask and enjoy myself a bit while doing so!
---
also having most of your pvp content streamer migrate to other games is totally not  a bad sign, those guys are actually the problem!
---
Depends on the ice. Most  common ice is coated with a thin layer of water so yes. Colder ice is a solid, so no.  If there is enough high pressure and heat the ice is both solid and boiling at the same time. It really just depends on the state of the molecules at the time. This general concept applies to most of not all matter. 
---
First of all, after managing to save a few accounts and a little liquid, WTB Loan retainers, 50/50 split in the profits and a 50/50 split of sharing a ban. 
---
Second, I am not a Naz Al-Ghul so my shitpost wont even hit the "killah Breeze" level. 
---
Yesterday i logged into my accounts and noticed that most of them had been banned, i stupidly lost another one logging in from my home IP. I shrugged and continue'd playing path of exile after accessing damages and seeing how much isk was saved ( out of 650B lets say 500 has been lost and 80% of my characters are lost aswell ) In the end, i cant say im suprised given all the space-politics that transpired last month. Some of the people i know ate a ban aswell ( unsure if the missus has, havent checked yet ) Lets just assume that its safe for me to say "i won eve" Going to evesterdam to crash the goon BBQ and afterwards i expect to move on to the next major MMO.
---
The thing that does color me utterly suprised is CCP's quality of space detective's, Where as my ban makes sense to a certain level, Nolak's does not. Before my blacklist we ran a seperate shop where Nolak took all the safe and legit loans and i took the more risky/shady ones at increased intrest. 
---
To my knowledge Nolak runs a completely legit and smooth service with a large satisfied playerbase and i hope that CCP has the ability to have their space-detectives poke through that however given their initial response, im a bit worried. 
---
Anyhow, enough ranting from my side. 
---
Do you need a loan?,
---
Azathio
---
I keep my collection of ships and event items in Luminaire, because it is a very symbolic system in EVE Lore.
---
And people that's quit don't get nostalgic of EVE? Or 'the good old days' of the game? Nostalgia-factor can easily be applied to both Runescape and EVE so 'just nostalgia' is not the answer I think.
---
It have more to do with CCP not giving their best. They can do better and we should expect that. This is the sentiment I agree with.
---
if u think 10 tril is insane...theres people out there haveing 150 tril + in their wallets..and no these guys arent goons or in any 0sec alliance for that matter.
---
....
---
What system you mining in?
---
As a matter of fact, both nolak and i are prohibitted from creating new accounts, i suspect a lot of other players will run into that soon
---
Also you needa factor in the huge ore-hold aaaaand the compression-capabilities of the Rorq.
---
Oh, come, now - if I'm mentioning that I'm essentially afk mining in highsec, I'm not such a newbra that I'm going to advertise *where* that is. I'm mining in highsec, and that's all anyone needs to know.
---
Is there any way to know which signatures are "high level", except trial and error? I spent like an hour scanning one down last night and failed, and had the same experience earlier in the day. I thought I was pretty good at scanning until I hit these two, both of which were in hisec. I've even done well scanning inside wormholes and did not have this problem there. All of this is with an Imicus. 
---
Oh ya like i said its definitely not just nostalgia its a healthy mix. Hell the pokemon games they came out with not to long ago id say is a good example of going forward making it better and still adding that spark of nostalgia to give it that extra oomf
---
Its FRT, they probably didn't have it trained.
---
What!? How!? That's... holy shit! I thought the richest dude was sitting on a few trillion, then I see 10T+... now you tell me 150T+
---
I think I got my fill on shock of wallet sizes.
---
I am kinda under the impression that you fear you  are bound to Amarr ships if you choose the race. This is not the case. Even as an Amarrian character you can fly any ship you like. Only the skills you have in the beginnin are race specific.   
---
Do not view this game as in different races have different ships to offer. Rather look at it as there are a gazillion of ships and any single one has some kind of purpose. To find out about the purposes of each ship will take a lot of time but you don't need to know of any single one from the getgo. This is the fun part of the game.   
---
So go ahead and enjoy learning about the ships and their possibilities.  
---
What a surpriiiiiiise..said nobody.
---
Yes, mining missions in highsec
---
To be fair, if you don't plan on using it for ratting, supers are not a worthwhile investment in gsf. With their only use being deterrence and the only chance to take them out is to have them sit on a structure during moonmining-fleets, it is dead weight capital that is worth less and less every month and other ships are a lot more fun. Get a second titan, btw, so you can have twice the amount of non-used ships in your hangar. (You can not even spin them!)
---
The problem with this logic is, anyone who got a loan didn't know he was RMTing.  Obvious he's been doing it for years and CCReee couldn't catch him, so how can you expect line members to know he was RMTing?  If they lose their wallets for him that's pretty horseshit.
---
The trick for this event was to mine the shit out of the last one!
---
Is there a mechanic that stops you from building titans/super capitals in wormhole and being stuck forever in that hole you build it in?
---
Oh, i agree on your your specific points, but imho we're past the point where fixing specific game mechanics "fixes the game". But, that may just be my own 'limited' perspective as the last time i've *really* been able to dig deep into the game like that was 2004, to be honest.
---
I also agree with you on WoW, going off on a tangent, but nowadays a lot of people do. That game is designed by excel sheets, not game designers, nowadays. Funny you mention the stat squishes, i was pretty vocal about the exponential stat/number increases around tbc and wotlk as well (which is why i didn't bother with cata onwards) :)
---
I guess that i look at the game a bit differently in that way than you do. You'll probably hate me for saying this, but i really wish CCP weren't a bunch of indecisive fucks and just released *some* kind of avatar gameplay in 2009 or 2010. They had a pretty nifty prototype in 2008, and there was a lot of potential in it. The round table at fanfest that year was also fairly productive. It could have grown the game in pretty interesting ways. Sure, there'd be problems, but at the time it fits the overal 'feeling' of the game (exemplified by the Future Vision trailer a year later). 
---
And i'm one of those people who can't really see numbers, and mostly goes on feeling, when it comes to games. After Apocrypha, EVE started feeling odd. New 'expansions' felt stifled, uninspired. CCP also started to diversify more openly, with WoD going into full production. It felt like they had lost direction, which became readily apparant when releasing avatar gameplay in the sorry state it was in in 2011. 
---
I feel like the outcry at the time was both misdirected by the community, and misunderstood by CCP. There was a general feeling that they were chasing 'jesus features', releasing something unfinished, then just leaving it to rot (oh how i wept for FW all those years in particular). Combined with the complaints about the non-gameplay of Incarna and that leaked internal newsletter i think CCP, rather than seeking some kind of balance in the way they developed EVE, went in a complete 180 and purely focused on 'internet spaceships' first and foremost. Crucible was hailed as 'the best expansion ever' later on by most at the time, but i personally hated that it was basically just a glorified balance patch and nothing else.
---
I was at fanfest again in 2013 though, and somehow i still have mixed feelings about it. At CCP Presents, Hilmar asked whether the audience wanted to know about 'the door', they said yes, and he said 'next year'. That moment however never came, and now the door has been removed permanently.
---
I really feel like this has a more poignant meaning than just that: I feel like CCP both figuratively and literally 'closed the door' on *any* development which would grow the game beyond 'just internet spaceships'. I know, a very unpopular opinion.
---
Back in 2000, when i first learned of EVE, CCP cited Elite as one of their main inspirations, and intended EVE to be the 'ultimate scifi simulator'. Oveur casually referenced this during the CCP Presents keynote in 2008. In 2011, CCP suddenly felt like it imploded, and during both FF's in 2013 and 2014 it felt like CCP was still conveying the same message without truly understanding it anymore.
---
Sorry for the rant. TLDR: I can't really specify specific problems and solutions, since i think EVE has gone beyond the point where they could help "turn the ship around". However, i also freely admit that this is just my own perspective, and i can get that from your own perspective it may just seem like 'unfocused outcry', and i guess that can be frustrating, so sorry for that :)
---
Yeah it's great :D
---
No Nolak was a common face of Theta Fleet boss and I think I remember seeing him in skirmish commander chat. In my experience, he was a good guy and a loan hawk. He wasn't really a shark; he just swooped in on the opportunity to make a loan.
---
Nolak, all i'd like to say in your case is sit tight, you have literally nothing to worry about and after they have spend countless hours going through your space paperwork i assume they will come to the same conclusion
---
\^

hyperion
---
Reminds me of the Black Desert Online whales who defended p2w, and will continue to do so. They were happy to be buying their way to the top, so when negative feedback rolled around... you got posts like this. 
---
I would agree whole heartedly if RMTing was even half as widespread as an issue as you're making it out to be. It's not a perfect solution by any means but I do think it's better than nothing. We can't live in a perfect world where ccp can vet every ISK that went through everyone's wallets that's just an unreasonable demand of manpower so a middle ground must be found.
---
dude, everybody know FW (and LS in general) is in a bad shape but what you suggest (besides one time fun) is not gonna improve the situation. Awoxing...hoping the guys don't have your ship in their overview...
---
Lame AND not funny, well done
---
Titan/Super needs sovreignty and one cannot have in wormhole.
---
However one can build Dread/Carrier/Faxes in wormhole.
---
If they are in a low class (C4 and below) they will be stuck forever there as they cannot use the wormhole connexion
---
\&gt;not poitot
---
Or the bot code fucked up
---
Would feel pretty bad to be the 1 guy that stopped it from being a flawless
---
Assuming you're #nopoors, blingy Jackdaw with Crystals. Works a charm as long as the 5-10 random ships aren't high alpha.
---
RLML caracal
---
And while isk is losing value and given the current rorq meta then everything created from industry is also inflating so they cancel out in large part.
---
use plex for 1 character and mct for the 2 other. it s still 300M per character per month with this

Yup, drive around low sec on a Friday or Saturday night, you'll find plenty xD. Occasionally get dropped by bored cap fleets though. Fw low sec is usually busy enough. I've rarely seen pirate corps recruiting.

Is it even profitable these days now moon mining is a thing in high sec? I mean I make 300-500mil a day with 3 chars (orca, skiff and procurer). The procurer account makes around 100-150mil of that. This is around 6-10 hours of play, depending on the moons. 
---
I have no clue what lvl3-4 mining missions even require or bring isk wise but if its above 25-30mil an hour I might look into it. 
---
they re currently re-doing it, got like everyone lined up to be in it too!
---
First of all, after managing to save a few accounts and a little liquid, WTB Loan retainers, 50/50 split in the profits and a 50/50 split of sharing a ban.

Can we go back to the eve is dying?
---
Top belt in tama is the most chill place to mine...because you won't be there long.
---
I’ve actually taken to doing it a lot lately whilst studying for University, keeps me in touch with the game without needing to be all-in on it, so I can puzzle over hard stuff and not feed billions of ISK. 
---
Just because it’s low effort doesn’t make it low value :)
---
Im doing it with only one char so cant tell if you do it with 2-3 chars, thukker mix have highsec l4 agents btw. Theres on the Eve forum a guide for all the l4 missions.
---
Atk tho?
---
Scamming, but not the slow brain kits local scams 
---
i feel better about my shitty piloting now, considering at least i can roam without instructions
---
Yeah it never works in jita
---
I mean it does, but you have to spam chat or have a bot spamming it boring if you ask me
---
Unless you bot, vni ratting requires you to be at your desktop every half an hour to warp to the next site. While this is lazy mode, its not passive. 
---
Yea dont do that now, you lose money on mctc. 
---
how are the loaners getting their collateral back? 
---
Usually collateral covers more then the loan because of the hassle of liquidating it should the loaner not pay
---
but that svipul only costs 1mil!
---
Thanks, I hate it. 
---
Rapid Heavy Golem. Small shit melts, and they can never kill you.
---
I'll have to keep my ears to the ground on that one! 
---
it's not only whales tho. imo it's sunk cost fallacy. hard to justify pouring so much resources into a video game only for it to turn into a playerbase milking shell of it former self. so it's easier to tell yourself "everything is fine, the devs know what they are doing it's actually the ungrateful (read: dwindling) playerbase that is the problem" then to face the truth: you keep investing into a lost cause
---
and 5000 plex ;)
---
I mean....I pretty much have nothing to store, but I'm on my way.
---
Boris, i wouldnt be as carefree if i was you :P
---
what would happen if a certain someone decided to fully disclose?

Wee, friends~

that's probably just panicking and expecting shit do die at the same speed as rats
---
I just keep it in my ass, to be on the safe side. 
---
You can see what scanning difficulty level the signature is somewhere in the probe menu after you scanned the sig down a little. I just don't remember where to look exactly because it's been a long time since I had to check the difficulty levels. Okay, so the Imicus has 4 midslots, so you can add the scan rangefinding array to get more strength. As for the site itself, maybe it was had to scan down because it was a ghost site.

What do you do personally to make money or have fun btw mate?

No.  ICE!  The bluer, the better.  Mineral prices have crashed.  Prob because of goons in Delve.

Same can be said from any artist's album, if you really want to spin it that way. I saw The Beatles' Yellow Submarine on Spotify.
---
1. Yellow Submarine - EVE is a submarine game and pretty much all Amarr ships are yellow
---
2. Only a Northern Song - Current northeners seem to be *singing the songs that others tell them to sing*
---
3. All Together Now - Current meta is to blob anything and everything with 800 of your closest friends
---
4. Hey Bulldog - A certain EVE celebrity that appears regularly on a certain recurring EVE spin show on twitch is a lot like a modern bulldog. Let's leave it at that
---
5. It's All Too Much - When you respond to the blob your enemies brought with an even larger blob
---
6. All You Need Is Love - The best ship in EVE is friendship
---
Everyone feed because they couldn't nano good enough

So what is Burn Jita, and why am I getting wrecked?

Why were they not rescued?

People in here saying, "oh, shows rorquals can be killed." I don't see any sign of the super umbrella that's supposed to arrive.

Ganking. Highsec needs more gankers. Is almost a dead role.
---
BHAHAHA 🤣
---
It just felt off, despite me lining it up with waveforms when zoomed in. It wasn’t a particularly fluid waveform to fiddle with and I rendered a bunch of versions of the introduction section to try and line it up better and better - just couldn’t get one that didn’t feel off by a few frames here or there. I’m not sure how noticeable it is, but I for sure felt it was slightly off beat in many of the edits.
---
do you imply they aren't there already?
---
do you wanna be friends
---
I read that there is a link between Signature Radius and Sensor Strength, and the lower the ratio the harder it is for you to be probed. Also stating that a ratio below 1 require special ships, equipment, and/or implants to be successfully probed. 
---
Is there any practical benefit to not being able to be spotted from probing, as in can gankers work around it? Is there a cap for this mechanic? I have a ship currently that has a signature radius of 25 and a sensor strength of 76.5, so would this mean it's impossible to probe down my ship? 
---
entertaining PVP, profitable ABYSS.

goons stockpile thousands of dirt cheap catalysts in high sec and use them to gank every freighter/anything that enters Jita.

The funny part about these abysmal, attention-seeking, threads is that every time it’s some tapi barely above skirmish fc that posts them.

Between Valk and Seddow and apparently OP I don’t think test will ever run out of people that basically blog everything they do in the game.

&gt; pvp content streamer
---
thats the point, the people this OP speaks for rather watch people rat in Supers nowadays ;-P (the flair confuses me tbh)
---
I've generally heard that around 10% per day is a good target, and that seems to match my experience pretty well. Take that with a pinch of salt though, since I'm working on a smaller scale in one of the hubs outside of Jita. 
---
Percentage returns kinda depend how you include margin trading in your percentages really. I tend to average 300-400mil/day, and I've got ~5bil actually in escrow and stock, but with an additional 4bil to cover on my buys, so it's like 7-8% on the actual investment, but only like 4-5% if you're looking at the buy order value+stock.
---
Happy to give some more info if you're new to trading and interested.
---
Those people created at least 2/3 of the content that made this game great once. 
---
B-R or UALX wont happen anymore except some people make that fight up in a shady &amp; dark jabber room to "entertain the line plebs" and keep mineral prices in balance so the plexxed multiboxes do not cry about subbing costs
---
He has an imp armageddon, just asked him, he's still active on the Failheap Challenge IRC/Discord and forums.
---
I don't believe he really plays Eve anymore.
---
The game has existed for a decade and a half, most of that time with few to little ISK sinks.  Anyone dedicated to being space rich, and with 15+ years to do it, could easily have well over 100 trillion ISK.  I wouldn't be surprised if 150 trillion is on the low end of the ultra space rich.
---
I'm not even that dedicated and I still pull a couple billion a day when I play.  There are people out there pulling multiple tens of billions a day.
---
It's not even that hard given enough time and enough willpower to participate in the literally the most boring resource gathering systems in all of MMOkind.  
---
Not to mention, before the moon mining changes, the people at or near the top of most alliances who controlled dozens of top end moons were literally sitting around with their thumbs up their asses while billions of ISK poured into their wallets daily.
---
They weren't even gathering it.  They were paying minions to go collect it and hand it over.
---
No, being space rich isn't hard, you just have to have ambition, dedication and a load of charisma doesn't hurt either.
---

C5 ratting, looting bling crabs for money, for fun I do blobs small gang (have not In a while tho) and join f1 Fests sometimes

Considering the price for opening boxes and the average outcome you could make at least 2.5 Mil ISK per site. Rich bastard would you buy me a ship then? A fitted Kestrel should be possible ...

Right cuz it’s in the FC’s best interest to turn pilots away from a fleet just so he can stroke his epeen over accomplishing task X with only Y people.
---
From what i understand krabbing is the act of doing PVE for ISK. and krabs are the players who do it.
---
The term is often derogatory but isn't necessarily.

No bounties lmao

Yes you are

I've not tried trade hauling. I have one account for trading and another for PvP. Moving stuff from one hub to another? That's so much effort man.

what? high injector prices make them more attractive...

If you can contact him, tell him to post some pixels of all this stuff for the sake of curiosity!

Or... I mean, I guess I would offer a few ISK to tour the collection of pixels like I’d do at any museum.

No, that's too simple.
---
It's wrong to compare each accelerator with no accelerator. The correct way is to compare each accelerator with the next lower one.
---
The Standard accelerator gives 21600-12960=8640 SP (times 2 with Bio V) more than the basic one and costs 185M-89M = 96M more. It's hard to justify that unless you get only 100k SP for a large injector.
---
The advanced gives only 4320 SP (8640 with Bio V) more than the standard one and costs 259M more. That is absolutely insane. That's only for people with a serious math weakness...
---
Pretty good, nice
---
Easy way to disguise your RMT, I guess. 
---
we don't RMT while doing it though, lmao
---
Problem:  People are using cerebrals, which don't bring in any IRL cash to CCP.  Cerebrals were more preferable than LSI to certain players, hence why people used to farm the shit out of them during the events.
---
Solution:  Introduce a time limited item to drive up the price of LSI (the Absolute booster), then do an event that makes cerebrals completely unattractive due to their high cost and rarity
---
Result:  People stop using cerebrals and buy LSI instead, which means more cash for CCP
---
They're called *meta* posts, get your shit together. /s

Killing in high sec is a suicide though, where's the fun?

I guess I’m just amazed because I feel pretty well off with my hovering around 1b after years of off and on play and finally finding the whole VNI thing that seems to have grown in popularity.

Still, earning billions with little effort seems outside my grasp but i end up falling back to my own lack of knowledge and how to apply it. Or maybe it’s my own lack of ambition to obtain that much for I see it as mostly pointless at that level. You’re very much right that charisma does a lot.

In EvE u have to make ur own fun. For me is to hunt high value traders. Usually it takes few months and then u score a big hit. The fun comes from the thrill of hunting someone that does whatever he/she can to avoid being caught with 20b in cargo.

You don’t seem to understand that the story here isn’t that a 200 man fleet killed some rorqs; it’s that FRAT actually let 6 rorqs farm in the same zone without having any means whatsoever of defending them, other than throwing like 5 Jackdaws at them lul.

I agree with what other commenters have already said about the cuts and stiching so won't labor the point there.
---
I don't really get the relevance of the title and ending graphic (very nice btw).

Your tag line is "License to roam" and yet there is nothing in there that could really be counted as roaming content focusing more on citadel bashes and small fleets.

I guess the orca exploding could have been part of roam but there's nothing to suggest it is.

Highsec mining is a joke. It caps out at what? 20m isk per hour? A Rorq gives 120m and is even more chill.
---
Nice
---
another reason why injectors suck: they wreck the natural slow progression that SP training forced you into.
---
get out of highsec, join a beginner friendly corp and ask questions like a 5 year old. you will get the hang of it in no time.

If you need some isk to get on you feet pm me, i stopped playing and still have assets to hand out.

Orthrus or Loki.
---
An Orthrus can reach insane speeds (4k/s+) that only intercepters will catch, keep enemies at range with boosted scrams and apply damage to most ships.
---
A Loki with a 100AB is somewhat the same, a bit slower but a very nice tank.
---
The difference between the two is the "If it gos wrong" factor. In a Orthrus, you can normally overheat your MWD and burn out of a dictor bubble while killing any tackle and then finish any others that are silly enough to get within your tackle range. If you get an unlucky scram hit you early or you run into a gang with a Huginn/Lachesis, your likely to lose your ship. A Loki can sometimes brute force their way out of small gangs.
---
You and me both. It sorta shakes off the "you have to be playing from the start" myth that was already horse shit but the game has changed to whoever can pump the most SP in the most alts. 
---
Well if you're that lost in the game, you're not in a good corp. Or not in a corp that caters to your needs.
---
So they can get their cookie?
---
Right now, I only have the one account active on Omega, and since I can't run any other Alpha accounts as I do that... just a Retriever for now. I can fly an Orca, but mostly, I wish I had the funds to Omega up my other accounts so I could take out belts before the bloody NPC miners rape them.

Orca meta would make a comeback!

&gt; As for pvp, I love it but I haven’t got around to do any yet,

Well, you kinda did, but it was not very intentional. :)

Oh. 14 years playing EVE and the same bullshit. I'm a krab I'm the only one who matters killing me isn't good for the game. You need meeeeeeeeee plz don't wreck my isk per hour. I haz the build slots. I don't pvp unless Daddy Big FC is there to tell me when to press f1. Feather in your slicer etc etc
---
No offense but I've never heard of that guy. 
---
It's a good first try. Nobody get's anything perfect on their first run.
---
You've got some good rhyme in there but mix it up a little from line to line to stop it getting stale with the same refrains. Also, personal preference, but I prefer the author to stick to either rhyming or not through and not suddenly switch mid-poem.
---
The rhythm of the poem is rather jarring and ultimately detracts from the whole. This piece might have benefited from shorter sentences to create a more continuous rhythm.
---
Your word choice is generally quite good, careful not to mix elaborate words with more common vocabulary, I just did it there, it sounds awkward and confuses the reader.
---
I'm being critical, hopefully in a constructive manner, but I hope you continue to write and keep producing poetry.
---
I mean now I understand why people are so against them, I regret using them but what’s done is done.

Also that would be very nice of you if it’s okay of course, I will message you my ign in a bit..

No, my entire playstyle relies on me compeating with the market prices that botters can unload materials at. But clearly they couldn't possibly cause issues huh?
---
Sorry I threw too much information into this post and I guess I didn’t put my points in order, I’m actually in a Corp but as I mentioned I’ve become anti social in games, I think I’ve turned into a solo player due to not being bothered to make friends, I think that could possibly be my problem..
---
CCPlease fix broken sleeper wh system

What's funny is everyone giving goons thumbs up for black listing but gonna are running hundreds of rating bots in they're back alley systems. But you know know one talks about that....
---
Not sure you are in a good corp mate, otherwise you wouldn't be comming here to ask this questions (and probably would have been adviced to spend your isk more wisely)... that a corp is big, part of a massive coalition or that it has a lot of propaganda in their favour doesn't mean it is good.
---
Sometimes, depending and what kind of player you are, a small / medium sized corp could be way better for you to learn the game and build closer relationships with your corpmates.
---
You can't possibly be serious...... the game is nothing like what made it good before. Fucking nothing.
---
Keep your earlier revisions. Always nice to have something to look back on when your have a polished piece. Can also help to have more 'inspired' earlier pieces to borrow good bits from. It can also make you look at your earlier work in a more critical but balanced way and help you to find your best writing.
---
As so many asswipes in World of Tanks say...
---
...this guy *really* should uninstall.
---
Hahaha, you’re right.. I should of said that I’ve experienced pvp but didn’t really get the chance to shoot back 😂
---
I was going to say much of what was said here. If you want to explore the options of the game and then specialize a bit, get out to highsec until you have a good feel for what you're doing. It won't get you a lot of PvP skills yet, but that can wait. Don't dump a ton of ISK into expensive ships until you have the skills (in SP and practical experience) to back them up. Explore, mine, rat, produce stuff - there's tons you can do without the ever-present risk of people who only play to blow up everyone else. Once you know more what you're doing, then get on out to null and dive into PvP while still doing whatever else you enjoy.
---
Thats nasty looking, but cool
---
Rlml Legion 
---
Just don't fight other rlml ships in it and your gucci
---
It can be useful. Imagine, you’re being chased through lowsec/nullsec/wormhole space and have nowhere safe to dock. If you’re opponents are on your tail, and if your ratio is below one, you can warp to a random celestial, create a safe bookmark in the middle of your warp, and once you land warp to this safe spot. 
---
Congratulations, you’re now impossible to catch for your opponents, simply because to scan you down, they would need a CovOps frigate with all skills to V, the best implants and modules. So now you can just safe log off and do something else, generally they’ll get tired pretty soon if waiting you and will go hunt something more interesting. Plus, roaming fleet generally have 0 scanning ships, because they’re so rarely used it’s worthless to take away a pilot that could be a damage dealer or tackler.

There's entire alliances and corps that cater to antisocial people (skill urself, adversity, etc.). 
---
These guys are a bit more advanced in the game but you could also join some renter groups like Brothers of Tangra if all you care about is to grind and to learn the game. You won't have to make friends, just grind and ask your questions in corp chat.
---
This might be one of the biggest points of denial, but no, you're not in a good corp if that's the way you feel about EVE. You'll think of many other reasons because you're in denial, but that's how it is.
---
Well I was advised to join one of those big newbro corps, but I think you’re right. I should of probably joined a medium size Corp where I would actually be noticed instead of being another fish in the pond.

Is it open source? Or more information about it and what it can do?
---
Orca shotput.
---
Looks like they won here, but thats just at first glance...
---
???
---
I do run with the corp when I can, but it's a relatively small corp - or, at least, not a lot of people have been on lately. But every couple of days, someone hauls out an Orca and a few of us go and take out a belt or two.
---
To that I add that capitals in low class wormholes see limited use. Basically, they’re worthless outside of home defense, but they are also what make the home advantage of wormhole corporation so great.
---
Starting from C4, Dreadnoughts can also see a PVE role, as they are great to clear sleeper anomalies and can profit from the capital escalation that bring even more ISK on the table. FAXes and Carriers are however, still locked in the home defense role, since FAX doesn’t have a PVE application and Fighters just get shredded by sleeper drones since they have the advanced AI mechanic that fucking hate drones, and Fighters being so expensive it’s not worth.
---
One child per rorq
---
I'll admit it piqued my interest, how the fuck do you krab in a Navy Exeq? People even fly them at all!?
---
Honestly I’m not saying that my Corp is good or bad because I haven’t really interacted with them much, but I guess you’re right.
---
I appreciate your feedback and if I may ask one more thing, what’s special about renter corps or the ones you mentioned at least? Since I’m still unfamiliar with most corps/alliances.
---
Looks like giant shrimp, or should I say Cancer? 
---
It is sadly the most common advice, and even if it is the right thing to do for some people, it can completely ruin the game for others that are looking for something more casual, free of obligations and/or intimate.
---
The thing is that its kind of hard to find small/medium corps in nullsec that don't require a lot of time commitment from you to actually enjoy the experience; but hey, nullsec sucks (totally personal opinion here).
---
Depending on your gameplay preferences, I could recommend you any of the corps that form part of A Band Apart (the alliance I'm in); we have dedicated corps for anything except nullsec living, from pure industry to lowsec piracy and everything in between. So if you feel like trying out something different let me know.
---
Of course, there are tons of good wormhole or lowsec corps out there, focused both PVE, PVP or a mix of them, but I wouldn't like to recommend anyone I don't know personally.
---
Other than that, if you are looking for a newbie friendly group to learn the ropes of the game, that isn't tied to nullsec living or uses you as a cog in their war machine, Eve University is always a recomendable group (they have "campuses" in every region of space).
---
That's great mate, thanks for the idea! I'm already thinking on how I could go sure to understand if someone is a trader first, and secondly if he's not afraid to go to low/null sec. You make money slowly but you make a lot. Do you do that alone?
---
And there will always be people like you to boohoo about it in a reddit thread, and people like me to point out that no one gives a shit, and people like those responding to me telling me I'm gaypwned

&gt;CCP can do better

They can't, the CCP of the current year cannot do better. It's an empty husk of a company.

Keyframing is your friend. 
---
Oï !
---
So, basically in DED sites you always have The assured Overseer’s Personal Effects, which compose the assured ISK revenue. The OPE in 10/10 will ALWAYS by the highest tier possible : the 23rd tier, which can be sold in CONCORD stations for 133.837.000 ISK a piece.
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Angel_Cartel_Naval_Shipyard
---
I do not know if what is said here is still up to date, but you indeed have assured faction spawns in the first, second and third rooms. The only room without faction battleship is the fourth one. Also, as said here, you can get even more loot by shooting the "Docked &amp; Loaded Mammoth", which you can find if you have Collidables showing on your Overview.
---
Concerning what the dude in your video looted, it can be three things : the OPE (always there), Domination modules (rarer) or X-Type Gist modules (rarest).
---
Hope this help :)
---
Renters are renting systems from established powers (think: loose landlords).
---
As such, they join "renter alliances" with minimal duties: since you're not part of the alliance of who actually owns the space, you don't have to do anything for them except pay your monthly rent for the system. So, (mostly) no PVP obligations. 
---
On the other hand, renters often have to defend themselves (and can't) because the overlord alliance doesn't really give a crap about renters. Think of corps like Fusion Enterprises [FUSEN] or HIsec Carebears [HISCB] in Brothers of Tangra. If you're more interested in grinding, those are the best bets (I know of).
---
The other alliance I mentioned (skill urself) and corporation (adversity) were just example of antisocial people still joining up together to have fun with other like minded people. I really don't know much more about them other than they are advanced and antisocial
---
excellent effort
---
Thanks for the reply, I agree with what you say and I’ll  tell you the main reason why I took that advice. 
---
Because at first I thought, big corp and big alliance would open opportunities for me, little did I know it also created a lot of obstacles. I thought I’ll have safety and protection, I thought I’ll be able to rat, mine and explore in peace, But it was the opposite.
---
I’m pretty sure it’s the same with every Corp and alliance but I think it’s mostly that I had high expectations I suppose and that’s my fault
---
Hell, I used to afk mine in syndicate and lived.
---
You might want to progress to quickly. 1 month in and throwing around 500m gilas is not a natural progression. take a step back. you mentioned "Intel channels"... i hope you are not in null sec yet. if so...take a step back. learn Dscan / Local Intel. get some experiance with newbro friendly corps in LS and HS first. Join Pandemic Horde or Brave later or any other newbro group.
---
Wormholers are so super elite with their invulnerable Keepstar fortresses... oh wait.....
---
Thank you for taking the time to explain this, I’ll look into the mentioned corps and try to do a little research to see what would be a good place for a newbro
---
I mean, I'm not paying 120m for a +6 accelerator. Fuck that
---
&gt; That's.... not where any of the actual isk-making bots are 
---
Correct, because they are all docked in the beanstar and as such are unable to make isk. Look at the flowchart in the original post of this thread. 
---
I like to sit in a brick tanked orca and drone mine. I'll add any noobs I see to fleet and boost them while chatting.
---
roughly half a mil EHP before overheat so I'm probably not going to die, noobs get some advice and faster mining, and I get to be social on the internet. Everyone wins!
---
I have been dutifully filling the surveys they send after each event but this time I won't since I'd be putting more thought and effort in than they clearly did in this piece of shit.
---
&gt; The Fedathron too
---
The Fedathron is like the holy grail to me.
---
Saw headline and was scared it was Aryth
---
I was honestly doing well when I first started and I was in a little highsec Corp that fell apart due to leadership disputes and I made around 600-700mil my first week doing exploring and then it went all downhill.
---
But I 100% agree with you it’s not natural progress and I realize that I made a mistake by buying plex and selling it and buying injectors, as I didn’t really get to experience early levels and barely flew any frigates apart from imicus for exploration.
---
Lesson learnt but all I can do now is start from the beginning and pretend I don’t have all these other ships.
---
if the dude who was ratting in lowsec with a gnosis and english is not his first language is reading this i hope you spent the isk i sent you on something nice and thank you for providing content for solo players and being a sport about it. friendship!

---
It is low... But I didn't do it to make isk, I did it as a side effect of looking for fights.
---
If he liquidated his assets and could find someone insane enough he could probably approach ayrth levels of ISK. Some of that shit is 1 time only, gotta be worth trillions.

Jackdaws/Confessors/Caracals are all great options depending on context.

Just read your discord spy alt.  The reason is always there.
---
The best part about this?
---
*You can do both at the same time*
---
You can’t do it wrong, you play EVE the way you want to.
---
Injectors... I have a philosophical thing against them. I’m on the way to lots of SP purely on the original intent of the game. I have a few pieces of head metal and all the rest is time. But, I have some history there now. And the SP to prove it.
---
for my first few months i did mostly WH exploration and mining. Doing exploration in WHs in cheap frigs (heron/imicus etc) will push you to grid dscan/grid awareness. do that. super helpfull. scannable HS combat sites (YouTube channel "jonnypew") are also good for learning and ISK. Next progression step can be c3 sites in Gila. Again dscan/grid awareness needed but good isk. Thats basically what i did. In terms of pvp i had much luck with a good pvp orientated newbro corp. Sadly i cant give recommendations for that today as i am out of the loop there. It seems the Default today is to join Brave or Horde.
---
Watching porn.. 
---
At that makes tons of sense.
---
Can you imagine a star cluster where a pilots' perceived level of skill was based on their abilities and not where they call home or who they fly with? Neither can I.
---
I have no idea how to play the game, so this is currently what I'm doing.  Mining in high sec and trying to just make some ISK.  No idea what I'm going to spend it on, but at least I'll have it for the future.
---
If you're going to be gone a while, PLEX is usually a good value storage.
---
Are u ok
---
Warp to belt drop drones shoot rats rence and repeat.
---
I have never RMTed any ISK, and this is a side affect of someone else RMTing who I was in contact with.
---
So basically like on every other rorqual fit in north or Delve or tapi space .. wow impressive achievement
---
Please calm down.  I wish you the best.  I hope you find peace and acceptance of yourself soon. 
---
Indeed. ISK is always good to have.
---
lolwut? What did my comment have to do with fits?
---
heh, I tend to view porn as a fairly, um, interactive activity, but it's still too passive for me. That's why I do phone sex - a lot more interactive, a lot more fun!
---
Ive had multiple supercaps from time to time. The RSI was what stopped me from keeping it. 
---
Im new here. Can anyone explain what RMT means??
---
which is bullshit anyways. have fun trying to catch up with a veteran that has the same access to injectors as you do. now couple that with the scalability of todays afk pve.

thanks to injectors you will actually NEVER be able to catch up where as before you could at least get on the same level.

I made myself a spreadsheet actually for that, including only yield (so im not taking into account travel time), it's about 5.5 Misk per hour for missions reward, and around 13.5k LP per hour.
---
A thukker M cap battery is about 3000 isk per LP, so 5.5 M + 40.5M =  46 M per hour with one char using an Hulk and T2 crystals for ore missions, venture for gas and hulk with ice rig + t2 ice miner.
---
Some thukker mix items can have higher isk per LP, you have just to check the market before spending your LP.
---
good Job. any of those in risky situations or did you even got baited and made it out?
---
Train up Gas Huffing, get a venture, some probes and ninja huff the good shit C540, C320, C32 and C72, ninja'ing it by setting a 15min timer (although you can warp the moment you see the rats on your overview), and you can make decent isk quickly.

Other things will happen .. if the game would rely on people who finish school and do other things it would have died 10years ago.
---
&gt; This basically means you can't buy anything or borrow money or really do ANYTHING with another player for fear of losing your wallet because you can never be sure if they're cheating. THIS is the kind of thing that can *actually* kill EVE, if you make your players afraid to interact with other players.

Just saying, if you put your money into things or people, best make sure you know what you're doing, or you can lose it all.

There's nothing like "being safe" in EVE... you can be safer in some places than in others, but you'll never be truly safe from danger.
---
Idgi why as a line member would you enjoy dropping on a fleet with 3x as many titans as they have pilots?
---
I finished school, college and work since 12 years, basically I started with the colleagues from my first job. The average age in my Corp (12 year old corp) is way above 30 if not above 35. But that is the problem, with our casual hours per week online time we do not match the pattern of "working ingame" that multibox-pve-buffing has created, as we want to spend them with PvP and not grinding.

I've had many staring contests with Death... and I always won..

it even has little arrows pointing to when stupid rich people like somer blink and i want isk  got banned and it drops by 15-40t each time.

you probably mean net worth but even then if you are claiming anything over 30t please post pics or stfu

Autocorrection
---
Totally! Thank you for your feedback!

?
---
my weekend started well.
---
got in to the office and i was the only one there, so i turned around and decided to 'work from home'. just waiting for the event to start - and i've already eaten way more snacks than i was intending to...
---
Because it being common somehow makes it less of a colossal failure
---
Molok, works great :D
---
Since this has garnered quite a bit more attention than I expected, I'm going to make an official statement:  
---
This ban is in error. I am not an RMTer, I have not and will never buy/sell any ISK. I started my loan service as a way to help newer people by offering low-collateral loans and advice on how to start earning ISK in EVE. Unfortunately, after being scammed for at least 20b isk, I had to change my terms and now generally require 100% collateral to not get burned. I have over time given away a hefty amount of ISK to newer players who needed help, and spent my time in the home defense fleet saving what needed to be saved.   
---
I have faith that CCP will unban me as I have done nothing wrong. We'll have to wait for their investigation to end. 
---
If you think about it, 1B/month is like eve minimum living wage, roughly like 2k/month in the real world equivalent for much of the US. So eve to real world would have a 500000:1 ratio. 500T isk would be equivalent in that scenario to 1B real us $ in terms of buying power of average person.
---
If that made any sense :)
---
You do not have to make friends or something that drastic right away, just ask questions on Corp chat is enough for starters. :)
---
Yeah The Boys
---
i lost two tengus this week cause i wasn’t thinking. but also got to shoot unit suitcase dreads and carriers so that was nice. also reconnected with an old eve friend after 3 years. 
---
Weird. You call us Shart box 
---
We call you Craptron
---
Really ccp should open  a new “hardcore” server that just has some basic changes players keep suggesting. There could even be a polling system like osrs.
---
No skill injectors
---
Citadels require 72 hours to kill... 1 timer each day
---
No assett safety
---
Excavators plus PANIC deleted, thus turning rorqs into boosting ships.
---
A limit on blues/corp/alliance size could be considered
---
Constellation based respawns on ratting sites.
---
No local/ local delay 
---
Omega only accounts allowed to reduce botting.
---
Penif 😢
---
I think that's only liquid isk though. Not networth which a lot of people conflate with isk.
---
5b per month?
---
it is a derogatory term for PVE players.  The other term you'll see is jew or jewing, cause there is a lot of antisemitic garbage in eve.  
---
dude that's all thats left of the playerbase: greedy narcisstic sweatbags. everyone else that's autistic enough left for wormholes or overcam his sunk cost fallacy and moved onto other games
---
Wow high still dropping on frigates... Really impressive....
---
This is it. Eve has gone downhill because of these changes. Especially caps.
---
I know some prime beacon real estate you can show off on 😉
---
Yes. P0 to P4.

Three that i've used before that let you search for things. Hopefully one works for you
---
its only liquid isk and only on active characters, i still think that you are lying if you are claiming anything over 30trillion in net worth and you don't post screens. 
---
The owner reached critical stupidity level and Noraus said fuck it.
---
ah ok makes sense
---
give me the isk he gives you i will double it
---
Honestly I’ve never payed much attention to the chats, one of the few and best conversation I ever had was in a wormhole with a Russian using google translate lol
---
Well doesn’t make it worth a reddit post 
---
Impressive!
---
this is so inspirational....  
---
Both sides were obviously input broadcasting
---
Very much risk
---
*Cringe*
---
Looks like a nice 1vs1
---
Death once whispered in my ear "you are not strong enough to withstand the storm." I whispered back to him "I **am** the storm..."
---
Both I guess. I just don't see the point in farming for hours and hours just to build one accelerator. It really detracts from the special, limited nature of the event imo
---
Is this bait? I feel like this is bait.
---
Mining in null
---
I think Eve uni has some good options for you to learn the game.
---
They have a progression from highsec to lowsec to null.
---
You'll learn a lot about the game there.
---
At least that's how it was when i started out.
---
Now i'm in null watching my drones mine a have some fun with friends in lowsec and i'm quite happy.
---
And that is the most important part of eve, since there is so much to do one can get overwhelmed.
---
Just make sure you do things you enjoy doing.
---
&gt; Getting the idea?
---
That you're retarded? yeah.
---
The only issues i ever really had with unscannable sites was ghost sites. If you can get to around 90 or 100 scan strength you should be able to scan most or all of the sites you find.
---
&gt; People already think I'l worse than dirt. Nothing I write will convince them otherwise, so why bother?
---
Get Vice to interview you. Hell, I'd want to hear how you're a freaking internet spaceship banker.
---
You can use these training chars as cyno alt, spin a VNI, ... Injectors are accelerating issues, they are not causing them.
---
&gt; The official narrative is that rorqs and panic mods are op and can't be killed by subs and need to be nerfed into the floor.
---
I don't think you understand the criticism of rorquals, or want to understand it for that matter.
---
So Nolak... I barely talked to him on Theta once (i have only been ghosting it for a couple of weeks), but from my brief exchange he seemed like an alright guy, and the constant “need a loan” meme when he was around was amusing. 
---
Seems a shame really. I mean, if you seriously play eve and aren’t living in a third world country and working for a dedicated RMT farm, RMTing your shit and isk is just not worth it. Assuming, ofc Nolak is actually guilty. 
---
Having worked in the industry once upon a previous life (on the QA and design side) I know how these things go... mistakes are sometimes made, but the tools in the hands of the GMs are very good—IF they have a reason to look. So if someone is not guilty, they better have a damn good explanation.  
---
In any case, I think they owe him an explanation of the evidence on which they based their decision, or a real email stating they are still investigating and will detail their conclusions. So I really hope it isn’t true that CCP summarily closed Nolak’s appeal ticket with no comment or explanation provided. 
---
Kill injectors ruin the game for newbs. Think of all the sweet Atron and Dessi blobs that these newbros don't get to experience because they want to skill up to cruisers and battleships before they ever learn to tackle or kite. The brotherhood of sitting on a gate with 50 of your corpmates in pew pew Atrons, Slashers, and Merlins. A member of the deathswarm. Laughing with glee and excitement as a stray Brutix or Cane jumps through to be unexpectedly blapped by the far less powerful ships... They possess something that the skill injected newb doesnt. Brotherhood. 
---
Forced to wait for your skills to improve, you and your compatriots have to make the best of your lowly situation. Manufacture inspirado. Force content. MAKE yourself useful. The glorious scout who saves us from jumping into fresh hell. The swift and fearless tacklers who block our enemies escape. The fear inspiring 80 man dessi down roam streaking across space in search of "gud fites". The newbie kitchen sink FC learning the basics without the risk of killing 2 billion in your brothers and sisters ships. No. These experiences have been robbed from our beloved newbros. We've bred a new generation of capsuleers who never learned that the lowly frigate is many times just as, if not more important than the tech II cruiser. 
---
that just increases the number of accounts able to continuously update the market there
---
I would pay to get a 2009/2010 version of EvE to play on.
---
or the launcher, there has been at least 6 new launchers in the last decade!
---
chinese silverminer is that you
---
Isn't this an AT corp with some pretty good pilots though? 
---
Ur a fuxking retord 
---
realtalk like 90% of its usage was in hostile theaters
---
Didn't actually pay attention for which system exactly was it, but it was in this pocket http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Devoid/Mili#kills
---
But there was more than 1 system that filled my overview with beacons.
---
uh huh, shall i tag tridgit into this?
---
You do get the occasional lowlife that needs to feel significant in wormholes, and they tend to group up. Those with whom'st we assemble, we resemble. Mustn't be very good news for what his corp is like I imagine.
---
He hurt you, didn't he? Please show me on the doll where he touched you
---
Wrong on both fronts.
---
Krabbing is not really derogatory, it is just a way to describe things. " my krab accounts" "my krab (worm)hole"
---
And we used to widely use jew instead of krab but then we as a community cleaned ourselves up to use krab almost exclusively.
---
How does that work?
---
I'm from Salt Lake and I know "Non-alcoholic". Lol!!!
---
How many ways can we iterate forgetting all your accounts :thinking:
---
Thats an interesting perspective because I have the exact opposite. I considered hisec mining to be nerve wracking and null mining (with Horde) to be relaxing. In highsec you never know when some random will try to kill you. In a 70-ship Procurer fleet with battle drones, we're praying for some targets to show up.
---
Jew’ing but PC to not trigger snowflakes
---
listen kid, watch your tongue or my rage... will be... your worst nightmare.
---
Learn ninja salvaging, it's fun and teaches some important skills like scanning and understanding D-scan as well as making you learn the crimewatch system.
---
It's moderately profitable and can give you the skills to try day tripping into wormholes later which is also fun.
---
who would win: 100 retrievers or five bombey bois
---
yes, and?
---
The man that taught me how to kiss &lt;3
---
Someone once told me nothing is impossible, But I do nothing every day, you Mr penif are my inspiration to continue doing the impossible **every** day.
---
I personally use a VNI to sig/speed tank. Stick a large cap battery, 100mn meta afterburner, and an adaptive invuln in the mids. DDAs and drone tracking enhancers in the lows. Heavy drones to shoot the rats resist holes and you should be good to go. I think you need capacitor rigs as well.
---
Each one an epic battle of skill over adversity.
---
Multiboxing bombers is not hard, at all.
---
And I did it a few times, suddenly the standing fleet comms turned into a cosy fireside chat. :)
---
pandas dropped an avatar on my six man roaming fleet which was very nice and very cool for the guys who had never seen a titan before and also very cool for me who had never had a titan on my killmail before!
---
&gt; remember when PVP was the main driver.
---
No, this has never been true.
---
Looks like OP just shit post.
---
Another obvious statement 
---
:thejoke:
---
no u
---
My friend,having lots of isk is not the goal of this game; neither having lots of skill points nor having the best ships.  The best part of this game is that you have to raise your char from zero to whatever you want. And enjoying it. Just try different things,but the important one is to play with other players, as a miner,industrialist, pvper, trader,etc. Look for other corporations and join them. Don't be scared to change. Maybe you find nice new friends and your good playtime will come back. And farm every single skill point you need,every fit you want and every ship you will drive,because the goal is not having them, but what's before that. Other players will teach you how to enjoy this game in very different ways,so learn of them. And finally, don't be afraid of losing a battle,because in this game,even if you lose a very expensive ship, local practically always shows a "gf", and that is the most wonderful thing of this game: the players. Enjoy.
---
Flair is relevant.
---
Best of luck! I already miss you posting kitties and puppers! 
---
Oh yeah that's us. Shit was Hilarious. 
---
Isn't that true for everything? If people are doing things right they have very little risk, that is by design.
---
The game would be shit if you just had a 50/50 chance of dying whenever you undocked.
---
You gotta put more effort into ganking than the group puts into defending to be successful.
---
boys i hope 
---
Good
---
I would instantly subscribe to Phoebe Patch EVE, greatest and most active times both in logged in accounts (weekends paked over 60k), CCP doing good stuff like tiericide giving a lot of T1 Ships some value back and PvP Activity was at an alltime high as youcould actually do something without the bored Supercap-Boogeyman jumping on your 3 Dreads on the other side of EVE.
---
[:thonking:](https://i.imgur.com/14COhR2.jpg)
---
Agreed. To me the most fun I have in eve is when I'm trying to accomplish something I by all rights don't have the skills to do. That requires thought, planning, and trying something new.
---
100% bombey boi. with an extra 110% China Salt.
---
of course krabbing is a derogatory term.  Otherwise you'd just call them PVErs or just pilots.  It is a way to put down people who focus on PVE.  Not that most people care, but it isn't a positive term. 
---
And the term jew and jewing are still commonly used both here in reddit, in game, on voice coms, in player / corp names etc.  Maybe it was much worse back in the olden times (like 2015) but eve is still incredibly antisemitic.  
---
Cringe
---
Yeah get a rorq and make hundreds of millions per hour while totally AFK.
---
We obviously mean iterations *which improve and fix the game*, didn't think it was really necessary to explicitly specify that.  Although this is CCP "if it's working, break it" Games we're talking here, so you probably have a point.
---
China will not grow larger...
---
Hm, correct fits, even down to the strong blue pill booster, no shield mindlink though. I'm rather impressed, actually. Would be more impressed if he actually brought lots of danger drones, could've made them pay for it. 
---
I think discord is saving eve cause its dragging more people way deeper into all the groups. why CCP still has no official one is beyond me .. every fucking mobile game has by now. 
---
I bet that feels pretty nice.
---
Two five man bombing runs. Check the timings hahaha. Welp lost 50 retrievers lemme just reship and do this again :)
---
aaaaaaaaaa, a Generals joke. I salute you, sir.
---
I play since 20 days and I spent 90% of my time in Wormholes so I'm pretty ok with that. What's ninja salvaging btw? And what's salvaging at all?
---
Seeing Gay Borg and Jen Makanen in local/overview, along with some others gave me feels.
---
Also tell Jen to scream at people to rename their ships. MC Cerb. Lol.
---
Yeah people don't want to give you fights. That is why they drop their superior ships with their higher sp pilots on your roaming gangs.
---
assume you have 2 trillion and you are fed up with eve 
---
you don't like the direction of it and don't see it getting better
---
do you A) just quit and leave it there in case you ever come back or B) RMT that 2trillion isk at $3 per1b wholesale to another RMT seller who sells it to buyers at $4+ and then do something fun with your $6k   
---
RMTing is actually stupid easy with how many isk sellers will buy it off you a few hundred billion at a time, they have corps that haven't been banned in years and thousands of positive ratings on the rmt websites. There isn't any work involved except logging in 1-8times a month until you empty your wallet 
---
where does this myth about GSF never using supers come from exactly? It is in gross  contradiction to the facts, we have used our supers both in small and large engagements more than anyone else in null for the past few years.

Osrs has been going for 6 years now and it is only growing more.
---
It isn't nostalgia anymore.
---
Get your damn permits already. Jeez Snuffed our, pay your bills
---
Thats the simple truth. "A dark harsh place" does not apply anymore to EVE 2k19. Its more like "Billion tons of ore can be mined daily and we do our best that you can do this nearly fully afk without bein bothered by this annoying non-consensual PvP".
---
A Primae. At least then the killmail would look hilarious. 
---
My broadswords with webs are ready for you, honey.
---
it's like 4-5 bucks per billion but yeah you are 100% right 
---
also the people who have the most in eve and make the most effort are often the people who have nothing going on in rl so the temptation can be huge for them
---
Damn, I hope that someone recorded that, would love to see a video of all those barges exploding.
---
It is a mix of "12 years with my dudes &amp; dudettes" and "sunk cost fallacy" still keeping me in ... but as I wrote somewhere else, Discord is threatening my EVE subs more than any other game. With that tool we can fully maintain our community without subbing EVE ...
---
Injectors have a cap.
---
70m-80m sp is where you really max out on a main as far as usefulness, and alts max way below that.

Most of my characters have below 50m sp and almost all of them don't have anything left to train for their role.

Rorqual mining is very chill in null these days, if you're in the right group. In decending order of chill for rorqual mining; Goonswarm, Test, NCdot. Horde is apparently starting up rorqual mining but not sure they've done it yet (at least not sure if they're using the good drones or miner IIs). You can pull about 100M an hour per rorqual, FYI. And the rorqual alts work well as fax alts in wartime (or a fax alt makes a good rorqual alt for peacetime). 
---
If you're in Goonswarm, Test or NCdot I also imagine you could do some reactions and t2 manufacturing, which further improves your income. Apparently you need to rent systems to do reactions and manufacturing in NCdot, not sure about TEST, but in goonswarm GSOL anchors public (for alliance/allies) structures all over Delve for manufacturing and reactions. In about 6 months I've turned 20bn into 70bn with t2 manufacturing and trade (zero ratting and mining). 
---
When players run missions or sites and the wrecks are left you can salvage them using a salvager or salvage drones. Ninja salvaging/looting is probing down mission runners and going through their sites behind them salvaging and looting the wrecks they've made. 
---
In high sec this is great because mission runners often dont want to risk their mission ships, some will even allow you to clean up after them for a cut. Others you can bully or possibly even fight.
---
They can get really pissed sometimes too but they don't often do much and if they dock up or start crying wolf you can usually find another mission hub near by to start doing it again.
---
I never read the book but the movie and mini series were almost as good as the computer RTS game. Dune 2.
---
We definitely didn't get the first bombing run, The second run someone mentioned they would get it but we are waiting on him to confirm.
---
I would of had recordings on my normal PC but was using my work one.
---
the afk mode he's talking about wouldn't really work unless you guys have some tool that sends an actual sound to alert you someone is in a nearby system
---
Imagine being in LSH and talking shit about dropping frigates lol
---
Was the same guy we killed running 48 retrievers at once.
---
Only one thing left to do. 
---
Alexa, set destination to Providence. 
---
lol well i saw the length and went hmmm so i figured formatting was the wise choice XD. 
---
Does dreddit wormhole? 
---
Didnt Snuff leave Goons after buying all the cheap Delve supers and titans they needed ?
---
depends on the missions you accept.
---
not gneiss at all can provide you 4M isk/h and 10k lp /h, but the average is 2.6 Misk/h and 6.2 k LP/h 
---
Right now that means that one character can make a total 19.2M isk/h in HS (using average values and direct sell orders). Thukker is 18M/h.
---
However with two characters you can do more than double that : an orca+ a covetor/hulk help you a lot. Alsodon't do the gas missions, they suck because the orca can't sniff it so it's useless unless you already have two other toons sniffing(one venture+ one orca = 1.67 venture, 2 ventures = 2 ventures  ; two ventures+ orca = 3.34 ventures, 3 ventures = 3 ventures).
---
ignoring both gas, and ignoring mother lode(so only 6 out of 9 missions), you can do 27k lp/h and 11M isk/h, which means a total of 84 M/h (thukker is 78) with two characters(so, actually 4 times what you can do if one character takes all missions).
---
Meanwhile in NS you can do (at most) 250M/h with this same setting.
---
I guess it really does suck to suck.
---
just fill it out and tell them its shit
---
Near2
---
look on the bright side - at least they're fucking up successive iterations on things few people care about in any significant way.
---
Better drop on some Caracals about it
---
omg its the thing i was too afraid to ask for all my life. this is game changing
---
wow ok big toxic alert
---
Wait how is this goons fault? Wheres Omecca to tell us?
---
It is multi-bot with virtualbox，fifty ratting vni or mining barge, they come to tranquility sever two mouth ago. Because another chinese servers was down ,whose economy has been hurt by bots and five hundred plex would cost 20 billion. There are many bots in fraternity alliance, which is why their population is increasing so fast.
---
What corp? Highsec miner lookin to move.
---
I was not involved. 
---
Whose got the video?
---
50 toon, all same corp, same all red zkill died to same bombing run  
---
definitely nothing fish going on here at all 
---
I agree about the skill injectors from hands on experience lol, it does ruin the game for newbs. I wish they approached it differently for newbies to catch up.
---
Pretty much every group is spy paranoid. 
---
But you could create a new account and join them on a Alpha alt.
---
Starting from scratch for a while might help give you some perspective as well.
---
That's what my guess is as well. 
---
And also botting.
---
Idk where you get your information but there was 45 faction &amp; t1 battleships on grid with another 35 faction battleships one system over. Our numbers on that battlereport is pretty much spot on though.
---
&gt; swooped in on the opportunity to make a loan.
---
swooped in on the opportunity to sell isk.
---
Just a stealth bomber, with 4 scorch in your cargo. That's all,without any doubt.
---
that seems legit.

---
Where's Olmeca when actual fishy shit goes down?
---
Oh yeah, not goons, not fishy
---
PLEX cost more on serenity because a dollar is worth more in China because their wages are lower, nitwit. 
---
The population increase from china on both servers are due to the proliferation of personal computers in China. More people are online playing games, so most games have an influx of Chinese players, especially those with Chinese menus. 
---
Shut up u gopnik пидор 
---
His toon is an alpha. Ice mining is a safe haven of value because omegas are the only ones able to mine it 
---
C4 and dread?
---
Did you meant C5?
---
What's wrong with you?
---
No need to spew profanities just because you don't feel the same way. If you would count the number of pings/requests for supers since that operation in the north half a year ago (excluding requests for bridges or rorqual coverage) and still feel like they are a "worthwhile investment" with regards to invested isk and usage/fun gained, then good for you. Also I couldn't care less which entitiy is using supers more or less than others, as it doesn't change anything in that regard.

No video. We do it for the local chat more than anything, and we dont keep it for posterity. Although, after those two bombing runs, there was only 1 character from FRT talking in salting it up in local. Makes me wonder how many heartbeats were behind those miners. :thinking:

Or which person tells them to press the f1 button.

honestly never heard that , Rating as in Pirateing

Dont beat yourself up. The game is hard and if you are in a megacorp and know nobody it can be daunting. But if you set a goal you will find someone who can advice you in very specifics mechanics. In a small independent corp the players will likely have a much less broad area of expertise.
---
Bot bombers trained to hunt bot barges!
---
Oh snap. 
---
not at all what i said, however the chinese affiliated groups have a long history that is very well documented about their proliferation of botting and many memebers of Frat and ranger regiment have spoken out about it.
---
Currently Frat is protecting them. 
---
I implore you to roam through their space, see for yourself. it is actually pretty impressive the amount of "aksjdlasj" characters there are, all in Gilas named 88 or 222. Its crazy
---
people were copying silverminer.
---
goons are causing copycats!
---
Ive been doing high sec mining as an alpha, do a bit of scanning here and there between study breaks, bit of chatting when I notice people that are there for HOURS as i finish reading chapters or writing notes. but yeah its fun and relaxing 
---
I had one of these VIP sites spawn in one of my mining systems, so I brought a Nyx in just to see what the loot was like.  First, the NPC carrier tanked WAY too long with an anti-capital fit Nyx on it, and second, the loot box contained a L1 pyrolancea drug worth 500k.  Great work, CCfuckinREEEE.
---
&gt;It is time for us to wake up and destroy the bots. I have sat and watched as countless posts have been made about the botting menace, yet no one does anything.
---
because it's not the player's job to do anything.
---
is it as cool as a Hel though? 
---
Eve will soon evolve into hunterbots vs krabbots
---
&gt; If they dont have an fc to babysit absolutly everything for them they just wont do anything.
---
'Don't feed' is drilled into them from day one in nearly every alliance, you can't engage without the risk of feeding, most wont even attempt until an FC comes around who takes the blame off you when it all goes tits up.
---
Yet again it's leadership of alliances and their policies that are the underlying problem.
---
You shouldn't have a 50/50 chance of dying if you are doing everything right, and no one is saying it should be that way. What people are saying is that you should have at least some risk in such a high isk activity. In test space for example I only have to join the standing fleet, be in jump range of d-p and pay some attention to discord pings to get 100+mil/h with basically no risk. The only fitting I need are a cyno, lo and panic and I will never die unless I get really, really unlucky. I need no piloting skills, won't even have to pay attention to Intel or have a scout it's not even a high apm activity. 
---
FRT bots best bots.
---
It drags me into my group yes, it does NOT drag my group deeper into EVE as the chat client / communication platform level to which EVE has sunk for some of us is much better covered by Discord functions.
---
wtf is this abomination? are those ibis knuckles?
---
i have mixed feelings on skill injectors. I think mass skill injecting is broken and is wrecking the game. I think a skill injector here or there for that 7 day skill that you need to t2 something on your pve ship is ok. I went through the early game progression by training with the goal of making isk to get skill injectors to "catch up" to older players. Now the price has skyrocketed and i could just skip it.
---
Sad day. Was stuck working so I couldn’t partake. 
---
You say that, but there are so many people that complain about bots. They sit there, they report, and then the bots stay around for months.
---
People wont bot if they are always camped.
---
I was told it was in reference to a Crab coming out to hunt, and dashing back into it's hole if danger appears ie: PVE Ratters.
---
I don't doubt they give shelter to a shit ton of botters, but so do most major alliances and renting empires.
---
If you are looking to unify everyone against bots, try to make all those groups actually purge and report the botters withing their ranks; you'll have a slightly better chance of success and it will have a way better impact on botting activity.
---
If you think that is impossible to achieve, I'm not sure how your proposal is in a better situation.
---
This guy was a multiboxer not quite a bot. 
---
What does a PLEX cost to buy from Serenity's official retailer?
---
That’s why I’m enjoying it so much because of how hard it is.. Dying several times in a row and losing millions kind of discouraged me for a bit, I didn’t play for like 2 days but other than that I was having so much fun so I couldn’t stop playing.. With regards to the megacorp part, I joined a “mega alliance” but I joined one of the less populated corps just so I’m not a part of a Zerg and actually be able to meet people and speak to people.. But again, throughout the years I’ve started having a difficult time making friendships in game, it just started feeling so artificial that I can’t be bothered communicating with people in game, unlike when I was younger It was much easier for some reason..
---
[Don't forget the Russians...](https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98587039/)
---
Bots are made to dock up when someone enters local.
---
If you are always in local, bot wont run.
---
if they adapt, easy kill.
---
I mean, it kinda sounds like you bought isk and are trying to do things without any actual experience on how to do said things.  Put away that isk for a rainy day, find a good corp that will help teach you things, and play from the bottom.  Knowledge is worth far more than blingy shit in this game.
---
They are next
---
I have to say opening up to people you don’t know can be hard. I have this problem and feel spent after about an hour into being on coms with my alliance. You just kind of have to take the plunge. It is hard, so very hard when you are socially awkward. But you will eventually get to a point where you are freely talking with your Corp mates.
---
Regarding the skill injector thing, take it as a learning point and create another character on your account. Progress through without any crutch and learn the hard way. I know you have sunk money into your character so don’t biomass it until your new character is up to the same level you’re at now.
---
Incase you don’t want to do that you could just be fitting your ship incorrectly for the activity your running. I have a few pve fits lying around, if you want them pm me and I’ll shoot them your way. Or it will give you an idea on how to fit for the activity your running. 
---
CCPls... how do 100 barges in a system not call attention to themselves and draw a red flag or two, or a hundred..?
---
I would venture a guess that non english corporations overall have a higher rate of bottting than english speaking ones.
---
Now input broadcasting....i cant say.
---
Part of the problem is thinking you need to "catch up".  EVE doesn't work that way, you can be very useful and near-perfect in any one focused area without much SP investment at all.  Its like joining another MMO and thinking you need to have millions of gold like the vets instantly, when in reality, it really doesn't matter.
---
That’s exactly what happened. But I guess lesson learnt, thankfully I got a lot of good advices on this post
---
uwu
---
Maybe this is CCP's plan. Develop the first MMO that plays itself. 
---
OMG .... my sides ... that is glorious ....
---
Arguably scamming and Corp thefts have brought a larger net total players to the game.
---
PvP as a category driver for player growth has likely ended more player careers than it’s started.
---
If it looks like a bot/input broadcasting, and acts like a bot/input broadcasting.....
---
I'm always intrigued by these sort of posts.
---
As a newbro, per threads like this, there is nothing to look forward to.
---
I guess I'll have to wait, burn out, and pitch in my 2 cents then.
---
&gt; PLEX cost more on serenity because a dollar is worth more in China because their wages are lower, nitwit. 
---
If you are an analphabet you should not write poems ....
---
Why would you guess that? English speakers are less likely to cheat? lol
---
I know the standard eve advice is "join a corp" but honestly, that never worked for me.  I'd be in a corp and be busy when fleets were going out, and bored the rest of the time.  Brave, Surely you're Joking, Pizza, Eve Uni, smaller groups, same story.  What eventually got me hooked on eve was two things.  First, I started following NPSI groups.   
---
 Whether this is pve like incursion groups, or pvp like Spectre Fleet or Bombers Bar doesn't really matter.  The fact that you can follow multiple groups and pick the one that has the next fleet is super helpful.  Second , I found a group without many content creators, and shouted in chat until people joined me on fleets.  Sure I was running them, sure I was terrible, but they matched with the times when I could play.  
---
I did eventually join CODE on one character, which worked well with the highsec locations of NPSI groups,  but overall, taking control of my playtime and the activities I wanted to do had a huge impact on my enjoyment of the game.  Relationships in eve develop by doing stuff with people, not just being in corp with them.  One of my favorite players in Eve is Bradford Clear. (anyone know if he still plays?)  Chatting with him was always entertaining, and he would do wacky stuff like taking fireworks to the Alliance Tournament.  Being in his corps never worked for me though.  I would find myself playing on a different character during those times.
---
yes
---
I can relate to your first paragraph, the thing is in real life I have no problem with communicating with people and making friends, it’s just in games it’s like I’m a different person I feel like I don’t know how I should interact with people. 
---
Also thanks for the advice, I think I might consider making an alt to play through the beginning while I work on my first character on the side and eventually continue on it
---
If the in-game NPE they keep remaking every 6 months is any indications, 10 pesos says these "tutorials" will be hilariously bad and inaccurate, and likely lead to more players quitting than anything.
---
Having a revenant does not mean having the brain to use it properly lol 
---
Obvious false positive is obvious... /s
---
I guarantee there will be a "How to use the NEX store" one on there at launch.
---
&gt;(PL, NC, Goons and TNT) could band together for this virtuous act
---
.....you screwed up there.  NCPL  and Goons...in the same sentence with band together.
---
Maybe I am the outlier here but I don't think ISboxer is something that should have ever been allowed. I think whatever function that ISboxer had that were seen as legit by CCP should have been integrated into the default eve experience and client. 
---
well i said all the major alliances, and i listed them. Whats the point
---
Keep up the rad work 
---
Best thing I can suggest for the online part is just say "Hi, hows everyone today?" Next thing you know you are having a conversation. I'm the opposite, I have like no friends IRL due to the social anxiety I have.  I can open up when the conversation is started with me, and it is a topic I know.  If I don't know I start asking questions to learn more, but then again spent after 30 min and need a reboot.
---
I'd probably shorten it and drop the stuff that shows the ui. It felt out of place
---
cool video!
---
There's 5 fits I like to recommend:
---
* Intro Explorer
---
* Alpha Explorer
---
* Interceptor Explorer
---
* Astero PvE focused Explorer
---
* Astero PvP focused Explorer
---
I'm more than happy to share any of these fits with you in game.  You can always message me at Nobutadas Amur and I'll send the fits your way.  I also keep those fits publicly available in NobutadasTwitch in game channel.
---
I think this has stuck with me from other mmos and it has become a bit like a habit, instantly having to “catch up” so I can pvp, etc. 
---
The thing is I feel like people with better skills have advantage over me, I’ve wanted to be able to go out solo and fight other solo players. I think FW should be on my to do list
---
I thought Marshy and co. was all didly and swankin' just a day or two ago and now he's talking about rather playing a different game because of having station camped by NPC rats.
---
the point is major alliances are typically hostile with other major alliances. unless they in a coalition with eachother
---
NCPL and Goons are hostile to eachother, with grudges. hence not being in same coalition
---
the only real exception is test who is a pet to goons.
---
Anything over 8 inputs per second is inhuman.
---
I also phone the police when I see a crime. I also moan about crime.
---
i do not try and fight crime myself, however - for i am not a police man.
---
cloaky camping only works if people are scared of your cloaky camping alts. 
---
my favourite ratting system has a cloaky camper - never seen them do shit, so i continue to rat there constantly. a VNI pays for itself in 2 hours - so a VNI bot isn't going to be too scared to rat until that cloaky camper actually does something.
---
I will trade you 5 sheep for 10 isk.  
---
well, you should at least leave some for russians
---
Chinese server was run over by bots because they were "allowed" to bot, CCP actually does something against bots on tranquility, we will never have that level of botting. 
---
&gt;im pretty sure all the major alliances (PL, NC, Goons and TNT) could band together for this virtuous act.
---
Eh, no. 
---
Ganking hi sec carebears and it can be very lucrative. Also running ded sites in npc null is lot of fun.

Ok. You first...
---
They are the good ones, and non english speakers are all communist scum *hypnotically staring into your eyes*
---
Yeah the idea that PvP has been or ever will be a primary driver of recruitment and retention of eve's player base has been proven false repeatedly, the vocal minority will always claim otherwise though.
---
You’re not technically uncatchable if you remain in space and are dscannable. Figuring out approximately where your safe is and doing close passes with bookmarking in-warp can slowly bring a pursuer closer and closer to your safe, eventually landing them on-grid.
---

---
Amazing. You love "playing" a game where you don't actually play it. I suppose that's the same hisec pubbie mentality that leads you to hide in a POS instead of actually *fighting* neutral characters.
---
Thank you for this reply, I feel like you could kinda relate to me and vice versa, I’ll keep that in mind...
---
There may be a video Soon TM Franny. 
---
Run the events....
---
Oh wait, don't do that actually
---
That they harbour bots as well? 
---
fun fact: of [8 botting super/carriers](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/98wnlv/botting_supers_beeing_teleported_to_youlai/) public executed in high-sec, 5 are from delve, 1 from detorid, 1 from esoteria and 1 from drone land.
---
You can better serve your purpose if you can simply camp whole delve, and seriously, kill them all please! But of course you won't.
---
HEY ! ITS ME !   
---
Awsome as usual, great music choice, love the video. Keep up the good work senpai &lt;3  
---
\-Mach Tackle Btw :)
---
you are not a botter
---
Bots are made to see non blues in local, and dock up.
---
Money. 
---
Sounds to me like 2 ventures would clear the sites faster than you could clear the rats in next site.
---
wow a whole 8 botters publicly executed, im sure they do this daily huh? Great stuff good work.
---
Oh.... that was a very isolated thing you say? Happened once? Oh fuck weird
---
Why would alliances that rent to botters help you stop botters?
---
Do you also think the term ratting is derogatory? Seems like your hypersensitive.
---
&gt; Wormholers are so super elite with their invulnerable Keepstar fortresses... 
---
got destroyed by a mindless lemming herd of thousands, 95% of them not even knowing what and why it happens, just jumping into the holes they were pointed to and press F1 on the target broadcasted.
---
You are smoking too much honey. Logic is too much of a luxury for you.
---
11. Best of Times (???)
---
frat rorqs, super(s), barges looks like detorid is a nice hunting ground... With losses like the last days you guys gonna attract alot more flies coming your way...
---
Honey never expires, much like my will to fight the botting menace
---
sure but thats not realistic and a good safe is not between celestial but between safes off of different celestial.
---
it already does play itself, a few years ago there was a battle that took place somewhere in highsec iirc that entirely consisted of NPCs
---
&gt;The reward is simply to high for the effort you put in to it
---
You are totally ignoring the effort that goes into keeping a safe super fleet ready to save rorqs on a moments notice.
---
FCs, scouts, making sure you have enough numbers, spies to see if its bait.
---
The average rorq pilot doesn't put in much effort but you should have to put in more effort than the whole group if you want to be successful in ganking someone that is doing everything right.
---
Well, that's not friendly to spodbrains having 15 rorqs so I guess ISboxer will have a longer lifespan than the game itself.
---
Or South Korean. 
---
1DQ1-A
---
Meanwhile, I've just returned and decided that the most fun I can have is mining in the most dangerous ways possible. So if you kinda like mining, but wish you die a lot more while doing it... I'm recruiting.
---
&gt; I challenge all the large alliances to create a joint task force in this crusade. We can work together, as the free folk of eve, and keep them out.
---
LUL, what makes you think they aren't in the same pot? Doing shady shit at alliance/exec/leadership level.
---
lol, nice.
---
&gt; Do you also think the term ratting is derogatory? Seems like your hypersensitive.
---
Seems like you are a dumbass?
---
ratting is used because you are killing rats. 
---
krabbing is used because you are calling people crabs (and not because crabs are great or awesome). 
---
This is probably the dumbest conversation that i've had today and i've been on reddit all morning.  
---
Targets for public execution were not chosen at random. They were cherrypicked from reported bots and chosen for maximum entertainment value.
---
You can't run reactions in highsec and in lowsex near Jita you would risk too much.
---
You could do it in low class wh with hs static or join nullsecblob and do industry in peace, no point in doing  it in lowsec really. 
---
I’d argue it is less about value and more about engageability. When people bring 40-60 man fleets of high SP ships (T3C, HACs) Brave can’t fight that on even terms. We don’t have the pilots/isk to ship into similar ships, we’ve tried. So we drop caps because it is the only option to fight them without chasing ya’ll forever in a ferox fleet to get dunked at 0 by 100 mn T3Cs or never get a fight since we outformed. 
---
Caps are the leveler. We can Cyno them in so faster ships can chase you. They also have very significant DPS so we need many less of them. 
---
Basically if you bring something engageable to GE- you’ll get a fight. Bring a hyperdunk T3C fleet that Brave literally doesn’t have the pilots to counter in subs and aim to dunk krabs vOv idk what you expected. 
---
Sure I just wanted to point out that if you’re in space and uncloaked you can be found
---
I'm glad you view him as an omnipotent godly entity capable of being in every system at the same time, praise ~~Bob~~ Olmeca!
---
fair enough
---
Got time to upload it to a different site yet?
---
Because, as everyone knows, eve players are the nicest and unselfish species in the whole Internetz.
---
So... is CCP hinting that 62.5% of botter in universe are from delve? ;)

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of Death, I will fear no evil... for I am the **BADDEST** m*therfucker in the valley.
---
it's 50 T1 barges for gods sake, they are worth less than a completely unfit rorqual....
---
That is what you're trying to say, yes. It's also hilariously wrong, for the reasons I stated. 
---
only low and null space
---
it just shows you how truly salty goons are about Olmecas presence...
---
at least it's not the usual bullshit "grr goons"
---
Better be a video to kill them all in one shot. 
---
How about you camp each other? Problem solved.
---
You're elite sweetie.
---
I need permission from my mom and the clip. 
---
you inspired me sir, thank you for being the person you are &lt;3
---
So... you are indicating that CCP chose to pick more than half of the execution target from delve because they believe it's more entertaining? Well... I can live with that ;)
---
last time I played, was part of the first wave of western capsuleers, you could straight up buy like 10b isk or something for a few bucks. Officially. From the chinese eve website. 
---
Dang yo...
---
Do share when you can 
---
and any half decent bot is going to have a whitelist function for this very reason.
---
what's worse than losing 2hrs of ratting because your VNI died?
---
losing 18hrs because it did fuck all because you couldn't white list some afk camper that never uncloaks.
---
i talk a lot of shit about goons, however i will say this.
---
I think they have a much lower amount of botters/system then most alliances. You guys are so flooded with membership and have smaller space per live character, i think it gets policed and reported more then say... frat. Frat has a LOT of space, and much fewer players. There are dead end systems and spots that really only the botters live in.
---
Worth the same if you go by build cost. 
---
I couldn't help to picture you as a humanoid eagle...
---
&gt; Why would alliances that bot help you stop themselves?
---
FTFY 
---
Haha, Jen here! I used footage from another alliance bro to stitch this mess together.
---
better call the internet police boiz
---
Supreme Leader giveth, Supreme Leader taketh 
---
so... how about prove it keyboard hero?
---
How about *you* prove it?
---
go away with that Caldari crap ....
---
I have a lot of spare time coming up soon. Ill make a nice power point, slide per system with highlighted botters. It will be pretty epic.
---
One Power point per Frat owned region
---
That is when you kill them. Hence the part where i said people deploy. Literally just need bombers and campers.
---
&gt; what are the chances of a leadership dude rmting his isk
---
extremely high.
---
&gt;but Goon upper management not knowing about it?
---
zero.
---
~yearly reminder~ https://pastebin.com/QT7yxnBC
---
I don't mean to be shitty, but what's the point of making isk for isk's sake? If you aren't using it for something, it's just a number.
---
and why would people want to deploy to get some vni kills when they can literally just ping a fleet and get way more content for way less effort?
---
WE HAVE MANY BULLETS TO SPARE
---
I call you an imbecile who raped your sister, prove me wrong
---
I see ALOT of bombing runs in the future! 
---
Looking forward to it ;)
---
Found the guy that never got salty eve mails.
---
Evemails are better then killmails. Lesson number 1 in eve
---
[This](https://imperium.news/shall-we-play-a-game-emergent-ai-results-all-in-npc-fight/) might be what you're talking about?
---
I hadn't heard about that, but Google was feeling generous today.
---
&gt; If you would drive a race against the Formula1 champion using his car and giving him a childrens trycicle, you would win, but he still would be F1 champion and if you brag about that win you would be laughed about by the whole world. Thats what happened in Rage ...

did you just assume he's not a Formula1 champion? 
---
If nolak is unbanned then i will gladly help him get on his feet...nothing like getting space violence to say loan in chat spamming nolak with 300 notifications...then blaming welp squad
---
that's literally what you get ganking high sec miners.
---
again, more content for way less effort.
---
so, why would people bother 'deploying' to camp some arse end of nowhere systems?
---
bought my 2nd super with chribba 3rd partying, seller was a PHEW guy and handover in Faspera - I wasn't sure not getting popped until i jumped safe ... 
---
I guess not undocking presents less of a chance for adrenaline than high sec mining
---
I mean, the things you just stated aren't fishy in any capacity. A mining corp got bombed explains everything you just stated. Calling people botters with the evidence being that they played like normal people just devalues any conversation about bots.
---
1) they are comparable. Most normally used in armour doctrine fleets, but their are examples of good solo ships (imperial navy slicer is a ship i use for solo PvP often....even though I fly on the minmatar side of that conflict - sorry boss!). slicer , retribution omen navy are all decent solo boats and Ediety has already mentioned the Harb
---
2 &amp; 3) they work well because of a good general resist profile (T2), chunky armour and lots of low slots. Theres none of this "do i shield or armour tank this" that you can have with the Min ships... generally just max the armour (there is atleast 1 exception to that but i wont go into it).
---
They are never going to be the best at PvE - the drone boats generally take that spot, with Gila / rattle / VNI at the top.... but they do have drone configs too - arbitrator( ? ) and Legion are 2 examples.  Otherwise they have an advantage that they dont have to spend much cargo space on ammo. for PvP see point 1.
---
4) I dont know what you're expecting in the way of "balanced" eve has at its core a paper, scissor, stone mentality, coupled with a n + 1 fleet calculation.... there are no bad at everything races... I could bemoan the lack of a decent min frigate for fleet work, but its the work of a couple of days to get frigates for other races... many of the skills needed are transferable between different ships. its the turret - missile - drone divide that is larger.
---
Ccp could just make botting against the eula. Problem solved!
---
Tfw my isk/hr is better than my $/hr :(

Sounds like a good chill group, glad you are having some good HS fun, was my self thinking about starting a 5-6 toons mining fleet in HS for some chills.

Pulsars are a weird, weird place. 
---
you sound like a super fun guy. Bet you get the dankest killmails on your 50 man fleets. Or you are just a huge complainer, lmao
---
I stopped playing pretty much because making money stopped being fun, and with fun I mean good payouts. Whenever I found something to make good money with, someone else abused it and ccp went full fuck you mode and nerfed it shortly after, they nerfed incursions, then relic sites, then increased drops in complexes, then c4 whs, then solo moonmining, not even sp farming is worth it anymore if you pay accs with plex ... No money to burn means less pvp means less actual fun-fun.
---
There were only 50. Clearly nothing to see there. They got the same guys twice
---
And then they become self-aware. I think I'd prefer SkyNet to whatever Eve would become.

100 ships with random pilot names and no punctuation/capitalization all sitting in tight ball.

Makes one wonder...
---
Once in the life of every pilot, the pilot will notice that just using one of the factions is a bad decision. All of them are good starters, depending on where you go and what you do. I started playing in null sec north, so amarr turned out to be very bad for pve. Moving to tenerifis and catch suddenly the minmatar became interesting.

For pvp tho, amarr are great, I love the zealot especially

Not that I doubt they bot, but with mining barges (to a degree) you don't even need it. You just fleet warp them all out if there's any danger
---
Not sure how many it'd take to where you'd have to bot them to keep reassigning barges to new asteroids fast enough after they mine out
---
How often is that logging in? I seem to remember profit depends on how much you pick up the PI
---
bless you

solo pvp 2k19
---
Obviously, none of them had mining permits.
---
Yeah, I am inclined to agree. While I definitely can't argue that the number of bots in Delve/etc is zero, common sense says that Delve is not a great place to run bots. Delve's safety comes from being on comms and actively asking for help; bots can't do that. Plus, the amount of competition for krab sites means that your throughput, as a bot haver, is going to be seriously impacted c.f. a nice quiet rental system.
---
Of course, this is common sense and assuming all actors are rational, which is not particularly realistic.
---
The golden rule of eve is don't field what you can't afford to lose

This is a great idea. With enough people, we can really move the world.

You pull in a couple billion a day when you play? What are you doing?
---
Restart extractors daily. Depends also on how many people are doing PI on the same planets, so it could be less than 4b in busy systems.

Honestly, just posting this because it's funny.

&gt;The quality of the advert must reflect positively on EVE itself.

People with over a trillion aren’t grinding for isk like the common man. They are doing market speculation and manipulation to the point that you would be thrown in prison if it was real life.

If I recall aryth has done a lengthy post with screen shots of his control over the moon goo market on the goon forums.

Bonus points if someone can sneak in a dig at CCP.

This is hot garbage and you should feel bad and be banned

Basically AT ads... get fucked CCP.  Anyone who submits an ad should be murderzoned and blacklisted.

That’s my problem, I don’t care what I lose or how much it’s worth... Yet I know it’s wrong the way I think

Thats a great outlook.

I'll never understand why someone would continue to play a game that does not make them happy.  Also, the reason your fleet is doing stupid shit is because you aren't a good leader.

I would not consider Bot alliance a great place to be in. (Unless you want to torture yourself). They're farmed way to often and leadership and Scarlett Lady can give a hoots ass about the linemen/renters.
---
Sadly the worthy members have left, execpt Vyxin (Bless her soul for taking care of ppl there). So i would contact her of your interested in living there.
---
If you do go there, be prepared to be farmed by LazerHawks, Hard knocks, SkillU, Init, Legacy...........
---
TIL zkill has an `finalblow-only` filter.
---
I'm surprised nobody mentioned cheap frigate PvP... Probably not very much profitable, but could be one of the most entertaining things in Eve.
---
Aye, more risk averse than any krab.
---
1)Is it posible to build keepstar in wormhole?
---
2)If yes,than is it possible to build titan in wormhole
---
3)If yes,than is it possible to fly titan  out of wormhole?
---
yeah I only knew about it because someone else mentioned it once!
---
Eh, the ones wearing the ties are usually salary, which started at around 50k a year ten years ago. Hours are shit though.
---
Sure, we know it did.
---
That’s not the question though at all. The question is again whether PvP as a category of player growth and retention represents a more significant net positive than others. Which it’s been shown not to be. For ever person that joined because of B-R or fights like it, there’s several who joined the game and were summarily PvP’d right out again by things like hisec gankers or bad luck with Lowsec roaming or being harassed in nullsec.
---
PvP is good for the long term health of many aspects of the game, and can be one of the most enjoyable experiences in EVE. Nowhere in that is proof that it’s a good driver of player retention. It’s much easier to get people playing and then slowly boil the frog in regards to PvP in EVE because the skill and equipment disparity can be quite off putting.
---
no it's the most chill thing you can do. Ganking is appears to be the lowest it's ever been afaik. Majority of the gankers seem to have gone to killing people in wormholes or low sec killing, they do still exist though. 
---
Good. I need to get back in, but I have to go through the annoyance of rejoining Waffe. Bleh.
---
i think its hilarious u kids talking shit about penifSMASH. u wouldnt say this shit to him at lan, hes jacked. not only that but he wears the freshest clothes, eats at the chillest restaurants and hangs out with the hottest dudes. yall are pathetic lol.

He's living rent free in your head. 
---
is it really PVP though?
---
Sign me up, as long as it costs more money than I make. 
---
Everyone fill them up with shuttles then mass eject them until node crash pls and ty
---
War of the input broadcasters? Or is this the first sign of bots becoming sentient and hunting each other and to top it all the bots are now shitposting about it on reddit?
---
I generally play about about 4-6 hours a day on seven accounts.
---
Between my PI chain cranking out Wetware Mainframes (I'm not lazy and collect P2 on six accounts daily) and mining for a few hours on six of the seven accounts, I can easily pull in a couple billion a day.
---
It's not liquid assets directly into my wallet, but around 2 billion a day in hard assets.
---
Now, do I do this every single day?  Hellll no.  Mining is boring as shiiiit.  But that's the difference between me and someone with trillions of ISK.  I get bored easily doing ISK generating activities.
---
It’s frat. They will just send their children to the sweat shop to build more
---
yeah let's go get a cheeky nado
---
I'll have to try and set it up this weekend and I might go back to afk ratting
---
Damn gotta try abyssal, how much money could I make in LV 1? And is it always pew pew?
---
1)  yes but honestly ,  just build it in highsec and haul it in with a freighter . Its much safer due to no asset safety in WH space
---
2) No, to build any supercapital ( Supercarrier and Titan ) you need a specific module on your "factory"   which requires to hold sov. And you cannot claim sov in wh space.
---
3) No , nor is it possible to bring any supercapital inside WH space.  The reason for that is either Mass limitation  or just CCP wont allow it. 
---
Never did events, in any game
---
Yes I think I'm going for it, just gotta see which fit can be good. I tried trading but damn man, it's slow af, I'm surely doing it wrong but I don't like going from system to system without doing nothing at all

I just accepted you into Dreddit and you're already shit posting.

I'm so friggen proud :')

Why wont they just make the stain to low gate?

I can see that worked greatly.

Holy hell that sounds tedious. 
---
Back when POSes were a think I ran some reactions in a little pocket of lowsec of off Paye in Tash-Murkon. Never had any trouble, but I only did it for a few months. Despite being completely across the map from Jita isn't only 16 jumps. Hauling to/from jita was the worst part.
---
Miller? You are heretic!
---
Really sucks that newbros get gobbled up into big groups now. No small corps forming and driving content 
---
If you can't figure out why there are no bots in O-V (hint: it's because people roam through all the time and there are far quieter systems in in Geminate), then I don't know what to tell you.
---
1. Well, you can't bring it to every WH, in lower classes your only option is build it within, along with the freighter to take it to the spot and anchor.
---
Try lvl3 electricals in a Caracal https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEgThIUyfOA&amp;t=8s  
---
So? Nullsec is built on botting, there is not a SOV holding alliance that does not have a bot core. Fraternity have got 12 years of botting catch up to do to rival any group on TQ.
---
I’ve been out of the game a long time, and out of mining for longer. How does one mine moons?

That too apparently lol

&gt;Please be aware that CCP reserves the right to reject videos that don’t follow guidelines or at its discretion. We try not to, but if your video is super weird, obscene or otherwise inappropriate for teen audiences, then we'll have to decline to air it.

---
 CCPlz... how do 50x2 barges in a system not call attention to themselves and draw a red flag or two, or a 50x2..? 
---
Am sick and tired of the general direction the game is going, seems to be away from active playing and into more AFK Rorqual, VNI ratting and all that sort of shit.
---
And I can't freighter anymore as I stripped that in order to put the points into more active playstyle skills and have no intentions on getting those again anywhere in the near future.
---
yea, I know  :( its a huge fucking can of worms, I didn't even wanna touch on in the post and derail it though.

Sometimes there is no accounting for intelligence, and I am not referring to the person he (let's make sure I use singular here, because I think we are dealing with a single known input broadcasting botter here) killed. 
---
Lol had to drop 35 titans, one for each active members of the defending force. Ha

LS alliances can’t compete with that, only big null factions can field a comparable Titan force, but then snuff might lose some and they can’t have that. So club LS to look cool. Can’t really blame em, that seems

to be the nature of the game lately. Almost everyone does it.

Someone sets up a refinery and shoots the moon with a big lazer, tractors up a big chunk, then shoots the chunk to create an asteroid field. Someone then mines it in a ship.

Well I’ll be damned. I need in on this, sounds way more interesting than my old days mining belts in hisec

Nice coincidence that Drone Walkers had 25 in that fleet and Phocas Legacy was just kicked from DW a few weeks ago.  :)

Nah, that would imply cat ears at al.

I hope you're not lying. But, if you're gone forever, know that I enjoyed your company and thank you again for saving my assfrigs on drops with your fax :)

good meme
---
They ask so much of us
---
You are not the outlier at all dude, I feel exactly same way. Just that r/Eve is has too many people who either partake or directly / indirectly benefit from it so they often scream about things like this the loudest due to their self interests.
---
Round up the lads
---
Dropping shit in your home region, outside of dread range outside of esoteria, full tank fit is a little bit different bud.
---
At low amounts of isk, isk is enough of a bottleneck that "isk for isk's sake" makes sense.
---
When you have enough that you can reasonably do most things you might think of on a whim, that's when you really need to be asking yourself this question.
---
What Titanium said is mostly true. They will ban any accounts they know are *for sure* associated with someone who is permabanned. And they will ban all accounts associated with an IP address; however, if perma banned people *in the future* make accounts from separate IPs there is not really much CCP can do to stop them, unless they somehow make it known to CCP that they are a perma banned player trying to get around that ban. 
---
That planet is literally metal as fuck.

thing is if you are getting boosted there is gonna be a rorq on the field that can tractor in shit

Dear grandson,
---
These are renters. And I am not saying there's no bot in our renters. Besides these must be really bad bots that get killed my neut in local that easily. [Maybe](https://zkillboard.com/character/2114791209/) [they](https://zkillboard.com/character/2114810441/losses/) [should](https://zkillboard.com/character/96727211/losses/) [get](https://zkillboard.com/character/2113660803/) [better](https://zkillboard.com/character/2113659696/) [version](https://zkillboard.com/character/2113637625/) [from](https://zkillboard.com/character/2114690575/) [delve](https://zkillboard.com/character/2114664498/). It's just hilarious to say FRT are the largest bot host, or we all run bots.
---
Don't fucking blame CCP's failure to ban botter to us, we execute and kick botting corp out of renters on sight, and did it better than 90% of null blobs for no revenue.
---
rorq mining vids incoming

* If you're in a large entity with intel channels, download and setup Near2 to help get early alerts for incoming hostiles. Always have local open and do select-all on the local list so it highlights everyone and you can see any new people who join system more easily. Be on comms and in standing fleet all the time so you can quickly ask for help.
---
* If you're in a good corp/alliance there should be daily or near-daily PVP content. If not, look for a new one. Join up, ask what the fleet needs and fly it.
---
* Setup and train an alt to do high-sec incursions (very good income per hour for no risk and can be done with minimal battleship skills). The alt should be in an NPC corp so you don't get wardecced. This will completely remove the risk of ganking.
---
If you take care of these three things your experience will be much better.
---
Wasnt trying to be hostile or sarcastic, but ok I suppose. 
---
and qual broadcasters

Try a passive shield fit and compare it to the Nightawk in tank, damage and utility.

tbh anyone that undocks is probably botting on some level

YEah i hear they use asic miners these days
---
&gt;At low amounts of isk, isk is enough of a bottleneck that "isk for isk's sake" makes sense.
---
Yeah. I mean, I don't quite have 3bill ISK right now. That's not a ton, especially if I decide later that I want to drop a ridiculous 1.8bill on PLEX. If I was sitting on hundreds of billions, then yes, I agree, sitting on it would be silly. But for now, it's enough to have a small cushion, enough that I'm comfortable with buying what I damn well choose without running out of funds. It's not like I'm flying particularly expensive ships, nor doing anything that really puts me at risk, so, yeah, 3bill is comfy.
---
I have wanted to fly an Orca for the longest time and was finally able to buy one from a corpmate!  Minor miner goals.
---
If they want AT ads which somebody in CCP or PA obviously likes, they can give us an AT or get fucked?  OR we can collectively continue to bend over?  Idc so much tbh, I'm not even subbed, but this request is really cheeky coming off the back of an AT cancellation. 
---
u dont have a revenant tho

thats a mirror you are looking at sweetie

lol so what ur AT frigate has killmails congrats morgon why dont u come to nullsec instead of orbiting a fw beacon with logi alts all day...
---
My toon (I'm a chick, btw) is actually on Omega right now, but I don't plan to keep it that way. I just had some skills I wanted, so I paid for a bit of PLEX during the Valentine's Day sale. I have another month's worth on reserve if I want to use it later for skilling... or if I get super frustrated with Alpha, or if I want to PLEX another account, or whatever.
---
People collect ships?

JK, nothing I have is worth anything so I either build them in my home system or leave them in Jita

Honestly, are we throwing stones at Frat now? I'm not saying they don't deserve it but nanoseconds after pointing out obvious input broadcasting in other alliances defenders come out of the woodwork to talk about binding to mouse scroll wheel and APMs. Frat isn't special because they are primarily Chinese.

Do what you want to do, how you want.

It's eve.

Maybe FRT should kick renters using bots?
---
\&gt;  Besides these must be really bad bots that get killed my neut in local that easily. 
---
Couldn't you say the same of the botters you just linked?
---
I agree that CCP need to do a better job, but alliances need to stand up and kick obv botters too
---
What? Somehow Olmeca is to blame for something here? I'm sure if he were awake in China TZ he'd be hunting them, too.
---
it's ok, just load 10 bil loot into a t1 hauler.
---
Wtf are you going on about? Apparently confused that reddit memes while Mar5hy was on vacation about him botting were true, when he doesn’t. Or maybe you missed the security update with thousands of botting account bans already this year. You seem confused. To be clear, no botting isn’t ok and yes they ban people and yes you should report those you see botting. 
---
&gt;First off all, sorry if this ends up being a long post, I just wanted to share my experience and hopefully get some helpful feedback.  
---
&gt;A newbro here, I’ve been playing for a little over a month so far and I’m in love with the game, what got me hooked is how complex the game is and the amount of things there is to do.  
---
&gt;But sadly I’ve been having unfortunate experiences lately. I bought bunch of plex and sold it, saved some of the isk aside and bought a bunch of injectors just for the basic mandatory skills, keep in mind mostly the magic 14 and drone skills, I haven’t skilled into titans and whatever.  
---
&gt;Now even though I had a decent pile of isk which I ended up blowing away eventually on an alt and dying, (still got about 1.7b) I wanted to farm a bit so I can experience different types of isk making methods for the future.  
---
&gt;During the process, whether it was exploring, ratting, mining and even abyss I’d always end up getting ganked or I would die to a camper. I’ve learnt from some of my mistakes such as not looking at the intel channel while ratting or mining, or opening an abyss portal in an unsafe area. But at the end of the day, my profits didn’t make up for my losses and as a new player it was kind of discouraging even though it’s part of the game which I honestly don’t mind but I think I’ve been doing things the wrong way.  
---
&gt;As for pvp, I love it but I haven’t got around to do any yet, my killboard thing is all deaths whether it’s from players or npcs. I know it’s sad, I’ve been doing mostly pve in a fully pvp game but I like grinding as well.  
---
&gt;I’m in a good Corp, not gonna mention the name since I know how politics are in this game and I don’t wanna get any hate for whatever reason, but as I’ve grown older I found myself having difficult time making relationships online, since I’m just not bothered for people which I know is wrong but i will work on that.  
---
&gt;I think another mistake I made was buying plex and selling it, having a large amount of isk prevented me from appreciating the value of it and I spent it on a bunch of expensive fits and specially 400-500mil gilas and other pointless things.  
---
&gt;My final point is that I love everything about this game, even getting blown up. But I’m either bad at it or I’m doing everything wrong, I wanna be able to sustain myself through pve, have money for pvp ships and an occasional injector, I want to get into pvp and have fun ganking, roaming etc. But I honestly don’t know how to approach any of it.
---
You did make a bunch of mistakes. But its not unsalvagable. Could use some more specific info though.
---
First, what exactly and precisely are you trying to do with your 400-500 mil Gilas ? How high are your current skills with them ? What fits are you flying ? These are money makers, and while for us older players that have played for many years playing drone boats does get boring, you are no where near that point yet. Gilas can actually be quite challenging and far more engaging to play then turret ships, depending on what you do and how you go about it. Its just the fucking bots, AFKers and shit and drone auto agro that end up giving them a bad rep.
---
Guess who's on Friday and Sunday CQ, priiiii
---
I don't see him hurfing and frothing how bad this is, I know and understand why he is not hunting them.
---
Yeah, it's relaxing. I can chat with people and make some ISK while I work (well, my home jobs, at least - I have a day job that I can't do while I play), but I really miss being able to run the four accounts I have at once. I would love to run more - an Orca, a few hulks or barges, and a hauler. But I lack the cashola to pay for the time. A gal can dream, can't she? :)
---
I was thinking it was PvE.  
---
i was tinking more along T1 battleship with max number of low slots, all armor plates in lows and higgs rig
---
&gt;Bring stuff we can helldunk with feroxes or else we will helldunk with supers
---
I'd fly it
---
Like dropping 35 titans on an equal numbers BS brawl, nope.
---
Fore sure, because it is the better way to fucked up your alliance.
---
&gt; alliances need to stand up
---
We did, just don't expect us to do full time job on that. We are here to play a fucking game of spaceships, not Financial Crime Detector 2019.
---
And assuming you are reporting that corp under good will. That corp is reported to renter director and they will do some investigation ;)
---
YEah I hear they use asic miners these days
---
i'm aware. They still spent a ludicrous amount of time on it if they are at 30trillion+
---
my point was there aren't a ton of players with that kind of wealth in eve, people make it out to be like there are a lot of these kind of people around
---
Not all of us relish the vicious PVP aspect of the game. To each his own, man. I'll play it my way, you play it yours.
---
got my first stratios today, i’m going to use it to do some exploring. i’m excited to be able to scan and hack ghost and sleeper caches. i can also use it to run some combat sites i scan down. it’s better than using the myrmidon/imicus combo that I was using.
---
I presume because he didn't see them on grid input broadcasting. Or do you expect Olmeca to show up in every thread where miners die, like goons happen to show up in every thread where people talk about miners dying?
---
Oh look a bunch of killmarks you got whilst being the most risk adverse faggot.

Nah, olmeca just posts videos of every miner he sees using more than one ship.
---
\&gt; We kicked a good number of them already, we just don't police renter space like 6mo babies. 
---
Glad to hear it. I was just responding as you asked someone to prove that there are systems full of botters in FRT space. 
---
I don't know how to report a corp to FRT, I have reported all 3-4 systems of botters to CCP however.
---
You should look for a mentor, not even to fly together if you dont want to. But so you have somebody that can explain you things more indepth than the corp chat of a random group.
---
Go to zkill &gt; find the top 5 killed systems in lowsec and nullsec. See if there's been a bunch of kills there recently. Take a frig there and loot everything like a madman. Last time I made a new char I looted up 500mil as a 1 day old character who could only fly merlins.
---
yeah you really seem like you don't care much and definitely don't seem comically assmad 
---
Nanos or gtfo
---
Ah, there it is. So your complaint isn't that Olmeca isn't here talking about Frat miners input broadcasting. Your complaint is that Olmeca talks about input broadcasting at all. 
---
Ready to eat shit you mean ?

&gt;  I bought bunch of plex and sold it, saved some of the isk aside and bought a bunch of injectors

There it is.. Eve is not WOW.  You have to be patient, to plan and wait.  It's not mindless point/shoot/respawn.    Eve, unlike other games have actual consequences both good and bad.  It's a lesson you're learning with 500 million isk Gila's instead of 3 million isk Catalysts.  You missed out on a core piece of the game, a sense of accomplishment, which you replaced that with a Visa card.    
---
Like you said, the damage is done.  You've completely bypassed the very soul of eve, not sure how you come back from that.
---
Fuck skill injectors.
---
i got my first two solo kills this week, though both were (probably) bots in unfit ventures. kinda disappointed in that but a kill is a kill regardless.
---
Skill Injectors made the rich richer and the strong stronger and devalued character growth substantially.
---
My 250 million SP, all-natural, 2005 main PVP character is a joke now.
---
I spent deployments keeping my account active and giving my wife a list of skills to train for me so that I would always be on the power curve.  I always had the right implants, trained the learning skills when those existed, shifted attribute points to be optimal when that was introduced... I always kept up as best I could with my training.
---
Then CCP decided to give me, and my kind of player, two big middle fingers by letting anyone come in and leapfrog me with enough ISK or real money in the bank.
---
I still play cause I love the game mechanics and the genre and because nothing else out there is like it, but it still feels like a sucker punch that knocked the wind out of me every time I think about it.
---
That's why EVE is getting worse for me personally.
---
Adversity. Is recruiting, by the way. 
---
Regarding the gilas, twice I died in the abyss.. First time was my mistake not paying attention, second time was on t4, the long range ship messed me up and the third time some people from enemy Corp camped my beacon thing... 
---
Honestly I kind of understand my mistake, it’s just newbie errors but it’s always some kind of different type of newbie error. 
---
Also my skills, most of my magic 14 are up to level 4 and my drones are 4-5.. Sorry I can’t give you exact info as I’m not near my pc atm
---
That’s a good point, I’ll try to find some bored vet  from my Corp or alliance willing to hold my hand for some time... Thanks for the idea
---
&gt;No small corps forming and driving content
---
Small corps can't live in Null, they get evicted/farmed constantly.    
---
Small corps can't live in wormholes, they are constantly evicted/farmed.    
---
Small corps can't live in LS because they are constantly evicted/farmed.    
---
Small corps can't live in HS because they are constantly evicted/farmed.
---
There is literally no where in Eve a small corp can survive anymore..
---
It's an inferno!
---
I'm not against adding rigs for this. Give people another choice to make.
---
Merc rig?  
---
Ice rig?  
---
Ore rig?  
---
Tank rigs?  
---
Fake news. Photoshopped
---
Underrated comment. 
---
Welcome to Eve, Youtube and the rookie chat will be your friend. Ask questions, ask more questions. don't be afraid to undock. You will lose your ships. ISK is just a number. Fly dangerously and have fun.
---
What response would you like them to give?
---
It's far too late to significantly change the event.  It's quite obvious that the event is not much of "a hit", so that doesn't need saying.
---
They tried something different.  It didn't work.  That happens a fair amount in gaming.  Talking about it not working doesn't change anything.
---
Are you gonna pay me isk to do it?
---
I wanna play the game, make it worth my time or HTFU
---
Honestly I’ve never played WoW, I’ve mostly played hardcore pvp games... It’s just that regular mmorpgs are so much different compared to eve and that’s what makes this game so unique.
---
Anyway, I agree with you, fuck skill injectors... Because with little knowledge and not realizing how this would ruin my experience, I did a blind mistake... The skill injectors and plex ruined my newbie experience, hopefully I can amend this some way.
---
the legacy rigged projectile rigs ragnarok doesnt count
---
Oh yes the rookie chat is golden, my first post on this reddit was about how amazing this community was and how newb friendly people are. 
---
better than the last album they put out at least
---
His argument isn't valid as null will use these to greater effect than hisec anyways.
---
Is P2 different than PI? Lol, sorry if that's a stupid question. 
---
Haven't played in a bit, and haven't done mining in ages
---
What are you talking about? There is definitely room for small corps in low and high sec.
---
Lol wat. Olmeca isn't in every system. If he saw this, and thought he could get them and there wasn't a better target, he would go for them. Wtf. 
---
Just walked into that one, didn't he?
---
I am on the way home from overseas and really looking forward to logging on in about 24 hours as it has been a week.  🙂
---
Yeah gotta give him that one. That is pretty spook
---
Cargo expanders.
---
Sweet so it is as useful as I thought it would be. 
---
So is there any way to make it impossible for you to be successfully probed? Even if thay had a covert ops frigate and implants? Or does it cap out at the point of needing a cov ops ship to detect you?
---
lvl 1-2 is not really worth it imo as a money maker but useful for getting a hang of the sites and how to fly/fight whats inside them. Probably looking at around 60-100m/hr in lvl 3's depending on how fast you can go through them and drops.
---
Dope af! Glad to see you’re still playing and kicking butt
---
Mildly worse than TEST, but OK.
---
Exactly, some are Russian too.
---
I was huffing some gas in WH when another Venture warped in. I didn't know if that was some kind of bait, or some newbro. So I decided to warp off, switch to Astero and shoot him down. As soon as I warp off he writes in local "Dude, you don't have to leave, there is plenty of gas for both of us". So I came back and we had one of those nice conversations that make us come back to this game again and again.

FW you can also have fun with simple t1 ships, and t1 frigs.  
---
Sure, you'll encounter people with nicer, shinier, better equipped and better skilled boats, but exploding in say, a tristan, doesnt lose you much money, and you will still learn a thing or two.
---
P2 is what you get when you extract and process at the same time.  So you extract the regular material from the planet and process it on the spot and it's P2.
---
P1 is basically worthless.  PI is what *all* of it is called under the same umbrella whether it is P1 or P4.
---
Nice try CODE... 
---
It's not specifically a language thing, it's just that English speaking has a high correlation to the Anglosphere/Western European gaming population which is drawn from historically very High Trust societies.  So there's cultural stuff going on that leads to more self-policing and lower cheating/botting rates in English speaking groups compared to groups drawn from different cultures such as Russia or China.
---
What "lower" means can vary wildly and definitely not saying there are no cheaters in one group or that everyone is a cheater in the other, just that there are significant difference in rates between different groups.
---
Ugh.  Live in Stafford but this is either a 45-minute drive or a 4-hour drive depending on 95 on a Saturday afternoon.  Decisions, decisions.
---
Uh, god damn right right we "come out of the woodwork" to defend people.
---
The vast majority of the accusations being flung around are so obviously bullshit or fabricated it's getting to the point where I'm starting to wonder why it isn't a bannable fucking offense to lie about another player to incite harassment
---
Have you seen the "evidence" retards like Olmeca are trying to pass off?
---
The last dude he accused was running FOUR FUCKING CHARACTERS
---
Ya'll need to fuck right off with dipshit accusations and examples which only demonstrate you are bitter retards if you want to be able to bawl out like that with any credibility
---
Ugh.
---
That's bullshit from so many points of view I feel dizzy.
---
i just restarted playing this week, after a long absence. i paid for some omega time, and a friend is loaning me his retriever (all of my good mining ships are stranded, for now, in null). one evening, i forget which, i was the only one in local, so i was jetcanning the ore from my retriever for later fetching. someone else showed up in local, and that someone ended up in the same belt as me. in a venture. i knew he couldn't scoop up all of my ore and take off with it in a venture, but i was ready to go jump and grab my miasmos anyway, in case he was scouting for friends.
---
instead, he ended up pulling his venture alongside my barge, and started mining in the same area as me. same area; not the same rocks. i didn't target his, he didn't target mine, but we chewed steadily through one end of the belt for a while, never saying a word, until at one point he ended up not coming back from emptying his hold.
---
don't remember his name, but it was nice to mine in quiet companionship with a neut who wasn't a dick in anyway. :)
---
for the rest of life, i started up a new business from home, which is slow going, but i'm slowly teaching myself how to market the business. marketing is new for me, and it's a bit of an odd field, especially for a gal like me. but i've gotten a few customers so far, and marketing efforts are generating traffic, so, yay, "she can be taught!" really pleased about the opportunity to work from home now. just waiting for the day that i start getting busy enough that i can quit my day job in accounting. i have faith!

In case you're not trolling - this weekend is 'BURN JITA'. I.e. a bunch of Null-sec alliances are going to turn Jita/high-sec into a gank-fest. Killing everything in sight.   
---
Here's a lengthy write-up: 
---
[https://tagn.wordpress.com/2019/02/11/burn-jita-back-for-2019/](https://tagn.wordpress.com/2019/02/11/burn-jita-back-for-2019/)
---
I'm happy I swear, don't I sound happy?
---
Drifter are the borg. That as close as it gets.
---
Get an interceptor and some ship with neuts--ideally a curse, but it could be a vedmak or even a vexor--and go hunt blingy rattlesnakes somewhere.  All you really need to do is neut them and survive for a bit and you can get loot worth well over half a bil.  Not the most reliable way of making isk and it can be very frustrating, but its also a load of fun and every time you make it home safe you've paid for another round of hunting ships
---
ELI5 please?
---
Didn't though?  I'd think tons of  people running ~3 rorquals w/o input broadcasting now. Rather than the 15-20 barges they would need to input broadcast.
---
I hope they are wrong as well and will miss you if they don’t figure things out
---
snuff killed lowsec a while ago friendo
---
Well yes in that regards, except there are now people decided to have 15-20 rorqs ;)
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/as2lue/just_a_high_apm_multiboxer_scooping_across_4/
---
Should we add a tag like *would have lived if it's a bot* in zkill?
---
I did say I understand why he isn't hunting them?
---
No? My complaint is how every goon using more than one ship is input broadcaster to him, but nothing beyond goons matters to him, regardless of how fishy it might look.
---
Is it normal to send some ISK to everyone you kill in PvP, or just to newbs? I've been the uh... beneficiary of such kindness many times, and I'm wondering if it's just for new players or not (and how long until I'm no longer considered "new"?)
---
What happens ISK-wise when you score a PvP kill? Assuming no bounty on the victim, do you reap any cash for the kill? Or just salvage rights?
---
There are very few interesting fun fights to be had in eve anymore. 
---
Anywhere you go that isn't bots you will get supers and titans dropped on you. There is no counter to that for a roaming gang so you simply stop going. 
---
There used to by this tournament that was fun once a year for the people that still liked flying subcaps but they got rid of that too.
---
The only thing left is ganking in cloaky/nullified shit and while fun  that doesn't come close to a well matched small gang fight of 3-4 years ago. 
---
This super/titan issue isn't about proliferation its about actual changes ccp made that made them the best counters in the game to most sub caps. Fighters that apply near perfectly and zoom 6k and titan guns that track subs and bosons. So yeah CCP has actively made the game much worse. 
---
Okay but only if I get a ZPM
---
50
---
Salvage or a small amount of LP if its an enemy in FW.
---
Typically new players or if you like them.
---
Not really. Years of eve and we still saying the same stuff
---
Try minmatar low sec,  no snuff there... But not much else either 
---
It's not invincible though cause any frigate can maintain range on it and deal enough DPS to kill it. It lacks agility to dodge incoming ships and is slower than a 5mn fit.
---

I thought it would be zero. Caps haven't been allowed in high sec in a very long time, way before FAX we're introduced.

How about the Wraith? 
---
Lol what? I regularly skirmish with goon fleets in GE-. That shits hella fun. But T3Cs blow fight because you need a similar comp to match them or just outnumber them and as I said we can’t form that and they run away when n+1’d too hard. 
---
Oh wow, so everyone who's been gifting me ISK after killing me are actually paying out of pocket? I assumed they were just refunding some kind of payout. Nice.
---
Depends what starting isk and SP you're working with.
---
At the basic level it would involve a T1 hauler. These things are basically made of paper. You'll be hauling mostly your own stuff and doing trading between regions and dragging mission supplies out to mission hubs or faction warfare stuff out to low sec border systems.
---
Hauling other people's stuff takes isk to cover collateral and a proper ship. You do not want to haul in a T1 hauler when you stand to lose anything because they get popped just for fun and luck of the draw they are carrying something all the time.
---
Once you have at least a billion isk you need to have trained into either a freighter or a t2 hauler.
---
A freighter offers larger capacity but you don't ever want to haul anything more than 1.5 billion or so or be at a high risk for being ganked. This has a higher upfront cost with the freighter being a little over a billion isk but you need less collateral in the bank afterwards because of the ship's limitations.
---
Alternatively you have a t2 hauler. More skill intensive ship to fly but lower upfront cost than the freighter. The big thing here is that the contracts can be a big as you can stomach putting at risk. This means hell of a lot better potential isk/hour but way more at risk if you screw up.
---
To find contracts you have basically 2 options. First join a hauling corp, either Red Frog or PushX. There can be a waiting list but you can expect steady work from these. Or you can go at it independently and get contracts from the "Haulers Channel" in game chat channel.
---
You can of course keep hauling just in bigger quantities with those ships for your own trading and industry purposes.
---
And lastly there is jump freighter work. Basically you'll need 10's of billions of isk. You'll also need a second account of cyno alts. You can work for either the Red Frog or PushX, your alliance in null or low sec or go at it independently. Independent is going to be difficult. You'd be restricted to stocking low sec and NPC null markets. Those areas already have people living in them so they don't really need people doing it and more danger of dying. 
---
Only so long as they don't have any structures.  Minute they do, someone larger will decide they don't want that corp taking "their" mining and ratting, wardec them and hunt them until they leave the area.  Most new, small corps at that point will dissolve rather than trying again.
---
Umm people who go to kill caps? Loki’s, retris and sometime Trig ships. 
---
Well done.

sooooo the replicators are bots, the bot special weapon is isk inflation, and the gas cloud is the storm of shitposting on reddit?

WTF are you on about. Marshy was got ISboxing across multiple clients. 'No, they use Asci' or some other shit into 20 chat channels at once. Bans for bots are not permanent the first strike is 3 days so 6000 bot bans does not even equal a single rmt ban.
---
CCP does not even publish name and shame ban lists, they literally give 0 fucks for anything other than RMT and have said so on stage at several fan fests.
---
U clearly havent seen my armor golem
---
Sure does, but there's people that do a lot of tedious garbage in this game
---
If you have information about a ‘bot core’ in Test, pass it onto me and it will be dealt with.
---
Does anyone know a rough number of FAX ships in highsec atm? asking for a friend, obviously.
---
Fuck you I ain't buying or selling shit from TEST markets.
---
Yes, might have made a little mistake here. Just checked, and it’s indeed starting from C5, even if a solo dread can clear up C4 sites.
---
When Olmeca extracts goons salt by not even showing up.
---
It is known
---
&gt; YEah i hear they use asic miners these days

---
This particular time, yea. Wasn't there a dude at some fanfest that was bragging about running 150+ at a time somewhere ? Might have not been a fanfest, something like that though.
---
No I meant this thread.
---
And if you noticed the last Olmeca sperg, he claimed 8 actions per tick is very high apm.
---
I don’t think there’s a way to simply make your ship impossible to find, even with specialized fits. However, if you really want to be uncatchable, get a covert ops capable ship.
---
Low effort Test / Russian post to try to get others to do their camping for them instead of paying for it.

what happened to his friend?  https://zkillboard.com/kill/74404855/

I played for two years in a new bro centric corp, lost the will to play giving the same advice and being ignored.             
---
           
---
I left the game for a year and realised what i liked was pvp, win or die i dont really mind as long as its fun, happy to lose 20 talwars for a t2 kill, happy to fly a t3 comp 3/1 to win.               
---
            
---
There are many elements of the game i don’t enjoy so i don’t do them anymore.               
---
Catch standing in brave in eu prime is call of duty esc, people come to fight and i enjoy fighting, my favourite so far is flying Jags at around 60m a pop. Looting breaks even but tbh if you sub and plex 500 every 3 month you would fund it.        
---
         
---
The biggest mistake i made was continuing a play-style i did not enjoy. Sub is £8/month ish if you don’t enjoy the grind and can earn it in real life faster than game you know what to do.            
---
Try something new every month, if you like it do it again, if you don’t don’t do it again
---
Reminds me of this guy in Delve that multi-boxes an army of retrievers.
---
https://zkillboard.com/system/30004727/ship/17478/
---
How do you even manage that many ships without some kind of bottling/input broadcasting?
---
Krab is one syllable and has fun pun options. PVE is three syllables and boring.
---
I use the term as well.  But i damn well know i'm using as a derogatory terme. 
---
Good, you'd just scare off our preferred demographic.  Go out back and we'll throw you some old bread or something
---
&gt; -Null sec entrances used to boast easy small gang content. Now with interdicted interceptors its practically barren in comparison.
---
This right here is and has been the singular biggest problem with "small gang content" since it's introduction, the effect on introduction was immediate and unmistakable, and it's just stunning how few people complain about the actual problem rather than just blubbering about not getting fed kills
---
When everyone can interceptor/yacht freely and JF their valuable assets from A to B there is no reason for anyone without severe mental deficits to actually get caught in a camp, it presents too perfect an alternative for anyone but the densest mong to not see the risk:reward calculus
---
Which means there's no reason for anyone to bother camping, no idiots in frigates chasing the ~elite solo roamers~ off gate for them to demonstrate their amazing ability to align, MWD and F1 at the same time against
---
When every mobile thing in space is an interceptor there's no reason to even be in space without a ship and strategy well suited for engaging them and any escalation that could come, because they are able to blast up and down the pipe every 15 minutes without interdiction until mom puts them to bed, and not even the most eager young FC can convince themselves it's worth forming a gang to chase them around
---
Which means nearly everyone you encounter on your interceptor roam is going to be either other interceptor gangs or fully evolved nullbears that have had interceptors shotgunning his sites for years, could give a fuck less about your notion of PVP (ganking him with zero risk and no other acceptable outcome), and 100% will escalate to supers so he can get back to something vaguely interesting like mining
---
Fast, cheap, nullified ships directly reduce to consensual PVP and gut the entire content ecosystem, it is everything wrong with the game and always has been
---
I'll take the stale bread. Can make some amazing bread pudding from it!

[Fuck you I won't do what you tell me!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWXazVhlyxQ)

I think it might be more group specific though, because I know players who will use it as a neutral term, and I know players where they always mean it as an insult. Maybe it's the group you fly with

I store my ship collection inside market orders.

---
Rogue Drones are sort of like Replicators.
---
Except less dangerous, and less intelligent, and less cool. But could be a nice baseline for a replicator-esque storyline.
---
Level 4 skills and a 500 mil Gila are completely inadequate for T4s. You may luck out and get a streak of the easy spawns in a row, but then a regular or difficult spawn will get you for 100%.
---
Its good you understand the mistakes you made with regards to opening it as far as locations go etc. but until you have some more 5s and can afford a better ship with confidence that you won't lose it, stay away from T4s.
---
T3s on the otehr hand aren't that good of income, you make better ISK running plain old L4 missions and without so many losses, as well as other content.
---
The official forums have a nice PvE section, with exact fits, cost breakdowns and all that, you should check it out and read up a bit before getting more into it.
---
For PvP, use T1 cheap ships. Since you are trained into Gila, you can use a Caracal or a VNI. Alternatively, side train a little and fly a Celestis. Long range dampener Celestis is pretty nice, newb friendly and you can contribute a lot with it in small scale engagements, unless dropped on by caps, and its cheap as hell. 
---
T1 frigates too. Super cheap, so you do not incur large losses. 
---
Talk to whoever you fly with for PvP as to what would be good to bring, set your per ship budget maximum and go with that.
---
Oh man, EVE and Scre... actually no, knowing Screeps players that's not surprising st all.
---
*if you find yourself in a fair fight, your tactics are flawed.
---
*places torpedo delivery order with wingspann to deliver torpedos to people near that shitty keep*
---
Can we do a gofundme for best sneaky dig at ccp?
---
&gt; The quality of the advert must reflect positively on EVE itself.
---
Or does it even need to be sneaky...
---
This isn't a zero-sum equation. EVE can get worse *and* players can get bored, and that's exactly what's happening. The expansions over the last three years have made EVE measurably worse for many types of players. Bored players used to be content to wait out the next Fanfest or see the next step in CCP's plans. Now that isn't happening because CCP hasn't announced any next steps, and those that they've hinted at are just more of the same.
---
So yeah, it doesn't have to be one or the other. It can be both, and it is both.

Fleet warp is not nearly as effective from back in the true ISBoxer days. It's the lazy alternative, but there was (and probably still is) a delay in the command going through beyond simply warping.

Mining in hs 2-5m/hr.               
---
Afk VNI in nul 40-60m/hr (100m loss).                
---
Carrier ratting 120m/hr ish (not chill 1-2b on the line).                
---
Nul mining 20m+/hr (20m on the line t1 barge).           
---
                
---
Eve doesn’t tend to do chill, enjoyment is your kpi
---
They did.
---
Oh lord, I'm going to be streaming this.
---
I work at my PC most of the day, and have 3 rorquals out, a VNI ratter, and a 5th sitting in a carrier waiting to jump just in case. I make about 350-400m an hour I plex 5 accounts, build capital ships, fuel blocks (1b a week), and go on fleets. Near2 + eve-o preview + big alliance = win.
---
do you have any proof of him being a sister fucker?
---
*dropping in delve while the entirety of the imperium superfleet is at the X47 hull timer
---
.. or think?  Yes.
---
i've started a few weeks ago, annd made my first 100 millions (in a night) exploring with a cheap probe. that's... not too bad i guess ? anyway it was pretty nice, just a bit frightening (i managed to survive to two attacks by warping fast enough and cloaking in a safe).
---
now I have enough ISK to lose a few more expensive ships :)
---
They had super heavy tank, massive tackle range, with very high damage and while not zippy they were quick enough with an mwd 
---
Damn, looks like it was a close one! 
---
This is a great advice, I think I keep forgetting that this is the whole point of playing, it’s to have fun and enjoy
---
Who's gonna evict some small group from a C2? Who's gonna evict some small group from unevictable space like lowsec? How about highsec? With the wardec changes, new groups can actually flourish even in highsec. Even NPC Null is fine for small groups.
---
What the fuck are you even talking about? 
---
I have no idea what you are talking about ,haven’t watched a single episode of star gate 
---
Great fight dudes. Hope you didn’t mind the re shipping. We figured since we were feeding you that you guys wouldn’t mind and it was being a great fight, but I can see both sides of it.
---
I hate your comp, but it’s good to have to theory craft against something new 
---
Sorry off topic a bit. Sounds like the political climate of the US. Fling around propaganda until it ruins your opponent... 
---
If you woke up thinking you wanna start sh*t with me... think twice because I woke up wishing a moth*rfucker would.
---
Yea because the mods of this sub have ever actually done their jobs here?
---
Is today the day you start moderating this sub the way it should be?
---
sorry, new player here, what's an "AT pilot"? I thought that doesn't exist anymore
---
Well they don't have their Rage anymore so...
---
Caldari definitely need more pvp pilots.  Try to join an organized group that is combat focused over farming. Good luck.
---
The door is over there, please see yourself out.
---
Thank you for this advice I appreciate it, also you were right, I did 2 t4 abyssals and I thought I’d be fine, until I got screwed. With regards to the l4 missions, I’ve actually wanted to try missions since that’s the only thing I haven’t tried in Eve yet but there’s two things I’m worried about, my standings and being in a Corp that wardecs might get in the way of me doing missions successfully...
---
fart gas from the smelly goons
---
Haha,  I spoke too soon 
---
Your posting is bad; both in taste and frequency.
---
luckily that means nothing on this subreddit
---
The Mittani long ago instructed goons not to report botters in Delve. So no, they're not policed and reported there.
---
No.
---
Sounds like work.
---
Eve uni graduate here. Best first step I took as a newbro. Than progress to null or wh. No shame in flying a t1 frig and tackling, being a hunter will help you to learn and still get on killmails. Massive fleets are fun but even is a frig you are still on coms and in the thick of things.  
---
Yes, starting with your 1 day ban :smug:
---
yeah, that has changed btw. Keep up with the time my small brained friend. Drink your Hi-C and eat somemore more cranberries, get rid of the UTI your uncle gave you.

it was a good day

new guy here, what is a super?

Great! But don't go for any site that doesn't have a pirate name in WH, those rates WILL kill you, and kill you fast.

this is great when you read the username and the bio that pops up. lol

hello wally have a great weekend 🙂

ty, you too

wait was that me? Asilthar? if it was GF my dude!

Iceland's only convention center that is big enough to hold it is being remodeled.

So instead of one fanfest, they're doing several mini-fanfests around the world.

thanks my dude geeat fight!

;) doesn't make any of it less true. glad you like it, though!
---
It does, you can become a mod if you keep it up!
---
yeah you only need to go through five pages of multiple choice until you get to a box you can fill in
---
point being there was more effort put into the surveys than the actual event
---
if mods were based on shitposting surely stainguy would be the top dawg
---

That's a good argument tbh.

---
Then yeah, they are gifting you isk.
---
Players have complained about this event site seeding system since events started 2 years ago.
---
CCP has changed absolutely nothing. Their calls for feedback are just trolling.
---
Havent people been multiboxing tonnes of miners for years now though?
---
Our T1 dessie roam brawled a Hyperion a while back, and it didn't work out well for him.  He killed maybe 3-4 of us before he popped.  Even with grappler he didn't seem to apply well.  Maybe he got bad rng.
---
Either way, brawls are life and love.   If you can find them among the kitty nano bullshit
---
With that fit, they've got roughly a 90s cycle time on the ice harvesters. With 50 barges, if you stagger them absolutely perfectly you will have &lt;2s per barge (1.8s, which with EVE's tick timing is basically 2s)
---
So I guess it's not *theoretically* impossible, if you're inhumanly well coordinated and focused enough on your task to perform the same action every 1-2 seconds continually for ages.
---
Practically speaking tho, it's clearly not an actual person multi-boxing legitimately.
---
oh god
---
Let's not forget the frat white knight who probably got paid to pr on reddit is saying they have renters=bots+rmt in their main alliance not just the [renter alliance](https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99007871/).
---
&gt; random pilot names
---
they're chinese names in pinyin you fucking dork
---
So you want Olmeca to come into this thread and comment about how the miner was clearly input broadcasting because he's multiboxing 50 barges, to prove that he's a hypocrite for pointing out the same behavior in Goons? 
---
I'm not following your logic, and I suspect it's because it's very, very stupid.
---
I've seen the evidence first-hand in Delve, and other regions. Your argument would ring a little less hollow if Delve (and other big regions, but chiefly delve) weren't rife with input broadcasting and cheating. You think the accusations are fabricated because they are about you. That doesn't mean they are fabricated. You can only watch 20 rorquals pull excavators on the same tick so many times before coming to a certain conclusion. 
---
&gt; Eve has not gotten worse. It's had considerably more content released to it and it has been perfected ever since 
---
What?? That last big content expansion was 10 years ago, Apocrypha.
---
I dont count rebalancing and 1-2 new ships per year as great new content.
---
Is this what /r/eve is back to doing, posting killmails of insignificant shit with zero story?
---
The nullsec rorq miners and near-AFK ratters are the ones 'not actually playing it'.
---
Thank you for this highest of high quality post.
---
Did it blue your mind?
---
Lame pun artist btw.
---
I doubt there's anything that isn't purely passive (PI) or station-bound (station trading, manufacture) that's as chill as HS mining. You have very limited chances of being shot at, a low APM and a reliable income.
---
The problem of course is that that income is tiny.
---
this is so dumb if you are a new player and only play a few hours a day you basically cant afford anything 
---
lolololololol
---
the joke here is that pandemic legion are northern coalition dot renters
---
Is this one of the PLebs Olmeca was talking about? 
---
Init lose 4 rorquals this week, 75b during their deployment  and they want to give themselves esteem with this post.
---
And wormholes
---
no, the joke here is that this was just the staging for this https://zkillboard.com/kill/75295516/
---
&gt; You can only watch 20 rorquals pull excavators on the same tick so many times before coming to a certain conclusion.
---
Maybe you should record that and post it as evidence then?
---
First of all, 1.4b(-insurance) or less because loot was lost which is little compared to what he makes, he could welp retrievers every hour. It's like posting "look we killed a carrier" except it was a super effective carrier that can cheaply reship.
---
BTW According to calculation managing 50 retrievers should have as big cpm as about 7-9 Covetors so it doesn't necessarily have to be botting, I would be able to manage that (if I had 50 accounts :P)
---
Obviously, that reply won't get upvotes, it will probably be downvoted by test redditors.
---
no, the joke here is your posting. ayy lmao gottem
---
its peoples way of saying "good job for getting out there. please keep at it"
---
I'm going to agree with a lot of the other posts here: you tried to jump the progression curve without really knowing what you were doing, and that's a recipe for a quick burnout.
---
The first time you try a lot of things you'll forget something and get killed. That's how you learn in Eve. So make those mistakes with cheap ships or when you have backup available to bail you out.
---
Eve is a social game, if you don't want to make social connections you're probably not going to enjoy it.
---
If you haven't done the career agent missions yet then do those, it will give you a taste of various aspects of PVE and you can see what you like.
---
Gas harvesting in WH is very lucrative and may be available for alpha (we were talking about this in CASMA chat a while ago and I looked over skills but I didn't see and alpha restricted ones.  Someone will correct me if I am wrong).  A venture full will take no more than 20 minutes and net a lot more isk than you will earn in HS mining ore.  However, it is not an afk activity and it can take a while to find high end gas sites.
---
awesome dude! The more you learn in exploration the more money you can make and the smaller the risk of losing it. enjoy!
---
I should clarify. I knew it was coming out of their pocket, and I know how to recognize the transactions in my wallet. But I assumed it was a portion (or entirety) of their spoils for having killed me. I didn't realize they were paying me at a loss.
---
You are the wind beneath my wings. 
---
All chinese are botters, not all botters are chinese
---
You could ask the CSM to take action!
---
Can we ban your posting instead?
---
I stopped playing for the foreseeable future today because my gf asked me to, am looking forward to travelling with her and generally spending more time with people. You guys have been great!
---
look at their corp name, they are mocking ccp with their blatant botting
---
Haha good joke
---
Zero, caps can go to high sec
---
i hope everyone is having fun in eve, i love this game but can't seem to find the time to play anymore. everyone please shoot some bads for me, thanks. 
---
It's getting to the point where the posts complaining about negative posts are the ones now cluttering up the sub.
---
10/10 would do again 
---
I already have a couple, and I assumed as much. Thank you for your answers.
---
I want an event with static sights and you get points based on X amount of NPCs killed that keep coming in random waves. Give them low tier highsec level bounties and let me afk all day in them with my gila alts. 
---
Those weren't bots. They did fight hard, well repaired hard to survive
---
Gnosis, HTFU 
---
Why regret?  If you got the magic 14 you're in a good spot.  Someone I know .. spent a bit on plex to fill out the magic 14 skills pretty soon after starting.  It opens up everything and you don't have to wait weeks for dumb skills to train.  Science V yeah, f that not sitting around for it.  5 days for 1% ship agility?  Yuck.  Best time to inject is before 5m skillpoints anyhow, each one is worth like 12 days or something bonkers.  After 5m they're only like 8 days.  $20 gets you most of a month of training time if you're smart.
---
The cynical part of me thinks that some folks want others to be lowbies in T1 ships and poor fitting skills so they have easier food... Not everyone started at launch with their 10 alts.
---
Where you went wrong was filling up your isk.  Gotta earn that isk.  If you don't earn it you won't value it and you'll do dumb things like bling fit a ship you have mastery 1 skills on and rock expensive implants for your first trip to LS.
---
Zkill lighting up with freighter in jita atm
---
ban the evil griefers, highsec is supposed to be safe!
---
Gotta love the Concord disco ball
---
cant regulate what people choose to name there characters lol wtf... 
---
You need to carry a drop booster to make it really effective, I'm assuming he didn't utilize one. Need a grappler and a web too, not sure if he was using just one of them. I have no trouble hitting anything that's not a command linked AB frig. Even then though those usually only take one nice shot. Just need to wiggle around a bit or choose a fatter target.
---
With asklepian I run triple mag stabs and a pyrplancea IV for that nasty 1500 gun dps. Very good for blapping fatties and has respectable antimatter/null damage too.
---
CCP: Hey everyone, wanted to let you know we had a huge surge in alpha accounts on February, so we're going to think about adding more content.
---
That is pretty cool.
---
This largely depends on the corp you joined. If its a small or mid size corp with structures, then you're kinda screwed unfortunately if you stay with that corp. Stay eitehr neutral (NPC corp) and have a 2nd account for PvP in a PvP corp, or at least one that doesn't and will not have any structures, or one that is big enough to fight back and give you good tips and help out.
---
For the actual missioning, pick a system way out of the way and high traffic, do not go near the traffic pipelines or the popular mission hubs. If you are decced then you will need to watch local and D-Scan a lot. if you see combat probes, especially getting closer to you, then go to a safe spot or dock up immediately.
---
For the standings, don't let them go into negatives for your main character, it can become a real PITA with regards to content and market access, not to mention the Navies will start shooting at you, not Concord, but the actual Navies if you drop too far. If they are already down you will need to re-grind a bit, starting from career agents. They used to actually give a ton of good standing but I'm not sure if that is still the case due to all the recent changes. You can fly around from faction to faction and do all those kinda missions in a T1 frigate, or Sunesis.
---
SOE epic arc, the newb mission arc will give you tons of standings and you can repeat it every 3 months. Can be easily done in a VNI or Gnosis (but Gnosis too slow) or even T1 destroyers, but the destroyers you'll need a bit of level 5 skills, for lower skills go with cruiser, Gila is way overkill, just do like 400 DPS put the rest into tank and speed to do them faster, bring 1-2 cargo expanders with you, some parts require you to carry some stuff and if your cargo is filled with ammo or otehr stuff you might run out of space.
---
For future I recommend a 2nd character that you can dedicate purely to PvP that you don't have to worry about standings or security loss from podding people while in low sec / FW. Keep it low skilled, maybe go with a single faction like Minmatar and skill up frigates and cruisers, maybe some destroyers on that character. Whenever your corp goes you just switch characters and hop into a ship and go with them. It can stay an alpha and be adequate. if you make it on a 2nd account you'll have the added option in future to plex it once you start making the ISK and can dual box.
---
As far as actual missioning goes, start from career agents for the standings, then go through a few level 1 and 2 missions just so you get the hang of the agent mechanics etc. Do not take combat missions against other main empire factions such as Amarr, Minmatar, Gallente, Caldari, these missions and the kills in them will cause you very significant standing loss towards that empire. So read the mission text carefully. Once you get the hang of it, don't jump into L4s. Do L3s first, again until you get the hang of the mechanics and very comfortably clear the big ones. 
---
Then start on L4s, however, with level 4 skills and 500 mil Gila, there will be ones that will be difficult to do and you may lose your ship, beware. If you stay with Gila it is highly imperative you learn how to fly the active fit and speed tank on it real good before you proceed. The passive fit Gila is kinda bad cause all those shield mods blow up your sig and there are quite a few missions where you will be taking a ton of extra damage because of it. Likewise if you use MWD. The speed and sig tanking bit you need to learn anyways because it will apply everywhere, both PvE and PvP alike and on most ships you will fly.
---
Again, go ahead and check the official forums for exact info, both new player and PvE sections have a lot of info in details on it.
---
Hmmmmm so good another thread about goons needing banned :)

lame

they can't keep getting away with it

welcome to about 4 hours ago, glad you've finally caught up.
---
thankyou i had a nice nap! 
---
Calm down, Marshy
---
When i was a newbro and i joined Brand Newbros in TEST, i got myself a salvage destroyer and followed some VNI ratters around. I think i made 200 mill in three days, which was far more than i had ever made before. I always recommend salvaging to all our newbros.
---
If I'm out in a expensive ship and a neut enters local, I'll dock up, so according to this logic I'm a bot?
---
I read that and I see "Dreddit: join goons today"
---
Starts with ""first of all" ends with a "won't get upvoted". 
---
Second of all, just because he profits off it even if you kill the bots every hour doesn't make this post less good. It's even more fucked up that people can do this and they profit off of it unless someone sits on their shoulder like daddy communist system.
---
Seen him put in it some crazy sketchy positions, so no hate if he wants to gank some plebs. We’ve all done it.

There are a good choice of azbels with better rates, shop around. 
---
Eve has got more fun for me over the last few years, maybe because I chose a new direction.

tell that to the Gala event. 
---
So you're just gonna turn a blind eye and business as usual? The guy who bots clearly lost before he even found a game to bot/rmt in. Some people are having fun hunting bots fyi.
---
I would have prefered player ads at the AT
---
fair, you can't beat a good nap tbh.
---
Where?
---
Supercarrier, sometimes a titan is also lumped into "supers" because they have the same jump range.
---
That's actually a decent bit more than I was expecting, I played with trade here and there a while ago but never really stuck to it as my trader lived in a wormhole.
---
I guess to provide some more information at this point I'm looking to have a trade alt in each of the highsec hubs, with a mixture of jita station trading and exporting to other market hubs. Plan was to go for a mix of high and medium volume items. Any tips would be appreciated though 
---
On the first view it could be Marshys and Olmecas Ego hmmmm not sure

Does look a bit like the a cloud from Abyss, the ones that give you sig penalty, a bit, but not exactly. But you're in 0.9 not Abyss, so I don't know. If you see it again fly into it see if it gives you any effect, also if it causes you any damage it should by default tell you what it is.
---
They tried that, the last video posted was obviously someone using hotkeys and not broadcasting.

keep politics out of the space game.

Please show me on this Charon how hard you got ganked

I have this mental image of a hundred Goons screaming "BEEP BOOP" as they gank someone.  
---
A+ would recommend 
---
Lol, you know you can bind swap windows on Isboxer and spam that and recall drones key right? it's really easy to recall drones on 20 rorquals in less than 2 seconds for example.
---
Unless you have a recording where you can see all the drones go back to the rorqual at the same instance, your argument holds no value. 
---
I'm not saying that there no bots in Delve, but the amount of poop that people flung around bouts with no evidence is plainly retarded. If you suspect a bot, report it to CCP, you as a player can't really know with "Oh he recalls so many drones" if the player is a bot. 
---
If there's a clear pattern you can identify and record that as proof (which you can obviously do and recreate all the time in the eastern regions with vexors and gilas).
---
I agree. Lived mainly solo in a C2 for a year and didn't come close to being evicted.   It may be safer for a small group with an anchored structure living in J space then high sec. 
---
Exploration is probably the best
---
I was there briefly just now and it spiked to 70% tidi when concord arrived

ok so i understand that you are having trouble learning how to use zkill. So I made you a spreadsheet of all the barge kills https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sL3Ml39_ZPbcCd2MbkNQUGf0B6rp2yMY9Fvx9j_zxts/edit?usp=sharing now we can count together :D

I mean when you say "mental image", you actually mean "screenshot" here, right?

I guess you could call them master baiters.

Snuff could never kill lowsec more than CCP did before their alliance was even created

go to jita and sell coercers easy money

Alone most of the time but with minimum 3 accounts. The traders are in Jita &amp; Perimeter, hardly going to lowsec.

Ok, here’s my go at it. 
---
“
---
The fluid in the pod keeps the body nice and cool
---
The senses, extending across local space, exhilarating aura of control
---
Your corp mates looking at your ship, only see a fool
---
That lousy fit will never last three cycles in a worm’s hole
---
Still, you undock to start the dance for fame and recognition
---
The poor souls inside your hull who joined you for the race
---
They heard the call for filthy lucre, mustered of their own volition
---
Soon their corpses too will join your own as they drift away in space
---
You’re not forgotten, your frozen bones will serve as tasty loot
---
Scooped up you will be, kept cool in your assailants hold
---
Your kill mail is their badge of honour as they holler and they hoot
---
And yours is just the next strand of New Eden’s story told
---
Some naked greed, some hopeful dreams and awful lot of strife
---
Such is the endless grind, dear fellow, welcome to the pod pilot’s life
---
===
---
Words to that effect
---
I would recomend looking into corps like Brave Newbies, Brand Newbros, Karma Fleet, Pandemic Horde and Eve University.     
---
They are all great corporations you can join, almost no skill requirements, and they allways have someone online.    
---
Just get into comms and talk your heart out, get into some fleet, get some action and try to socialise, it just makes the gaming experience better, listening in comms, reacting from something in comms, killing shit together in comms........     
---
I my self were a lone wolf for almost two years before I joined a corporation, only thing I ever regretted was that I had not joined sooner.......     
---
This is only my two cents, you do what YOU think is right!     
---
Best regards and godspeed
---
The Psychology Studies where worth it... still happy not have choosen the Lesbian Dance Course at the University
---
You mean MEGA!
---
That simply isn't true, I know if many groups in low sec with structures that none of the bigger groups ever bother to hit because they know that there isn't going to be any content coming from it. Now sure, if a small group anchors a fortizar then ofc they can expect it to get killed.. since theres essentially a super hull worth of assets that will generate a nice kill mail asking to be blown up. Or if the corp acts like assholes to locals telling people stuff like 'you're not welcome here, fuck off', then yes obviously their shit is going to get pushed in. 
---
Wouldn't be EVE without goons. God bless em'

Like you said the game is complex and so many different little things to learn along the way to avoid getting your shit pushed in.
---
And none of what Im talking about has anything to do with how many SP you have or what ships you fly.
---
That's what I was gonna say - a space fart!
---
burn jita is live but no one cares.
---
the salt must flow

I know for a fact zero is not the answer. caps built in highsec can stay there, they're all just really old.

Good job to them for mercin' that bot operation. Too bad it will be back anyway
---
Everyone should just submit ads with an AT17 intro/outro.
---
If your a goon the bosone titan, since they dont know anything else
---

And they hated Olmeca, for he told the truth

The flames of jita are getting pulled through the gate

For alphas you are best off in wormholes, because the people there usually don’t try to camp gates, which is the only time you really need cloak. Everyone else will just wait for you to start doing a site and then gank you, and being omega won’t save you there.

Looks more like a lot of alpha bots made some goons.

There was a post a while back i cant find it that calculated how much damage a doomsday would do. Its a very rough calculation but its not unrealistic.
