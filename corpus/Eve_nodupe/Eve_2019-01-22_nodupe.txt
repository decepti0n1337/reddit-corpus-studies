Wow, that’s beautiful! Great tribute!

I didn’t realize that the government had been shut down since 2003

Looks amazing!

Currently T3Ds are completely outclassed by AFs, especially Confessor

---
Instant-align Hecates and fleet Jackdaws may be still very useful, but other fits I would say are not good in the current meta
---
i would use some polys for the rigs on the Tristan but thats up to you

Caracals off the open market??

Couldn't you just have a person From Corp A lead you to the rorq by fleet warps to bookmarked holes, that's what we'd do
---
&gt; I just shouldn't watch anime
---
The only important part of your comment
---
Which anime?
---
Had it happen as well. You either have to wait till DT or you can try to petition it since its technically stuck, and you cant target it, and ships will keep spawning on it
---
I'm guessing you've never owned an Audi...
---
Nice killmarks, don't let the haters phase you. 
---
We are currently staged on the Oijanen gate in BWF as we have been reduced to a shadow of our former glory and all we can do is camp hoping to catch rookie ships.
---
Hope this helps you guys to get your fight.
---
Your description of C4 corps is p. funny lol
---
Could bump him
---
The second you send the recall command, the cycle is aborted and you get jack shit for your time. Maybe you should go get in a rorq on the test server and see the actual process that you have no experience with at work before you start telling the rest of the game how it works
---
They’re effective... 
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Effectively CCP’s communal tampon for PR
---
Sounds more like your FC need to speak clearer. I can't even hear the "Do" without the subtitles. 
---
you can't "finish" a cycle that was interrupted, just go grab a rorq on the test server and try out what you claim is happening, you will wind up with ZERO ice blocks in your hold.
---
THE COCAIne keeps him sober from alCoHOL
---
What I meant was most WH's don't like being dropped on, they like to pvp without caps on grid unless they are ready and confident for such a fight. Why do most wh groups ignore delve? They hate the supercap umbrella. In wormholes you get more control in who comes in and limit hostiles choices by mass limits. 
---
I'm not saying anyone is wrong for running away or ignoring cynos, its a valid response. Just don't start talking non-sense about taking on the blob and you're fine. 
---
X - for doubting that you have two functional brain cells to rub together.
---
No, they only affect mining lasers(ice, ore)
---
Sure, um ... 70b, I think I paid more but I'm not doing anything with it so meh
---
" I have done plenty of rorq ice mining " then you were doing it wrong, all you have to do is check the drone stats while they are loaded in your rorq, then do some basic distance math.
---
Actually tried to launch a three man corp into a C2, gave someone the wrong look and ended up getting evicted. 
---
" It's ok to be wrong when you click the Report Bot button in game as long as it's in good faith. " Yes, but being a dumbass and posting threads calling people cheaters because you are ignorant is just a waste of everyone else's time.
---
Unfortunately that did not happen in my case, kudos to you if this is your policy. 
---
Upvoted to spite the others.
---
You sure? I thought that it was optimised across all ores... Dang
---
And he is apparently also shit at ice mining.
---
Wow this is amazing, thank you for sharing. Mindful would have loved it. 
---
maybe everyone was right that mining does kill your brain but goons are just immune to brain rot?
---
I also heard it as him saying we need MJD. Entirely his fault for not speaking properly. 
---
Why am I not surprised that you are spam posting this lower effort response to goonswarm members who respond to your low effort thread...
---
hey if he's dumb enough to not be able to figure out how ice drones work do you really think he can comprehend something as mind-numbingly complex as fair baiting?
---
You sound like a snowflake that's never ever played sports rofl. If you get upset over someone calling you retarded when you're doing retarded shit, maybe competitive things isn't for you.
---
Buy a sports car and get a new haircut
---
For the record, I've never been killed by this guy or heard about him until this thread. My only salt here is that people go around doing dumb things like this with supers while I'm to poor to own one :(
---
you forgot to add OP is dumb to your list
---
If you have good scanning skills I can recommend an exploration interceptor. Ares is a good option but there are others that work as well.
---
"  and re-post this when he seems savvy enough " The guy can't even be bothered to figure out how ice drones work, how savvy can he be?
---
The indy window can be really slow, maybe try just waiting another 10s? An actual indy guy will probably have a more helpful answer
---
Pirate ships underpowered? I think the Gila would like a word.
---
Stiletto because I don't like dying in bubbles. 
---
Add two blasters and you will get okay dps. ;)
---
He doesn't pretend to be either, because he is? Why are you dying on this dung heap, it's not even a hill.
---
Holy fuck, I used to fly with him back in the day. I’m honesty fucked up that he’s gone... 
---
Rest In Peace man. 
---
The compressed tab is just high sec and then did the blueprint page and all the steps and still just high sec.  even says high compressed ores.  Was sitting and waiting for truck to warm up so had a ton of time to kill on my phone.
---
Ok, thanks for that.
---
Well, I know fuzzworks does the optimised thing as well, I'll have to resort back to using that
---
Im very interested in living in one, unfortunately I doubt theres much a single person can do to protect an astra inside one. :( 
---
I'm around the 1 year mark as well and now CEO of a small C3 corp. My EVE history was full of upper-management, CEO experience, former Director of War with LAWN. Two of my former directors came back and we've invested more into this project than I ever imagined. I learned the ropes with No Vacancies (great group btw) and now I have a chance to teach newbies my style of play, while still juggling the needs of experienced players.
---
And that, to me, is more fun than I've ever had in this game. It's hard at times, living with only a null static. But I enjoy wormholes. I would've Won Eve, but the wormhole life kept me here.
---
I'm still heartwarmed when a gramps gets his diploma!
---
&gt;we are right there on the precipice of being the truest of WH entities. The only group that can truly claim that title would be SC/Eve-Scout. We try to leave WH space the way we found it - with no trace of activity whatsoever after the party is over.
---
If you consider leaving wh's with no trace of activity to be the "truest" then Eve-Scout is instantly disqualified from the billions of annoying cans they leave in every single system known to man.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also I thought Wingspan was a HS corp?
---
Put the BP in your hangar.  Open the industry window, then halfway down you’ll see some drop down boxes.  Choose current station (this can be changeable with better skills) and then make sure the others are all set to all.  In the bottom half you should see you blueprint.  Click once and the details will appear up top.  Hover over everything, read the tool tips and also check you have the skills to build by hovering over the icon below the BP icon.
---
link km
---
Make sure the mats are in the item hangar in the station that you're starting the job. I've left my mats in a hauler's cargo sometimes, and have also left blueprints in a private can.
---
Try logging off and back on.
---
Maybe it needs to be built in a specific station based on the career agent?
---
I've been considering moving into a c1 wormhole solo. I dont have much experience with structures. Would I need both an Astrahus and a Raitaru?
---
I could've swore he said MJD.
---
Faction standings yes, security status no.
---
long ago on another character I no longer play on, during POS days. 
---
1) I don't think you understand what skynetting was in eve
---
2) this post is a fuckin nightmare itself lmao ":the LuCeiFEr" oml child please
---
kind of hard to own supers in provi
---
huh, i almost feel like if you opened the link it would say suitonia 
---
Why is this the answer everyone gives when they are asked for proof of being evicted? It's either you can't remember the toon, you forgot the corp, sold the toon years ago, or don't want to share the name of the toon/corp... If you can't remember your eviction why even mention it?
---
If that’s what he did, I’d see your point.  It’s not, so your point is worthless.
---
7o
---
Double click on the blueprint
---
man you had 7 fights in 3 hours? I live in amamake and sometimes I don't get that many in a day. granted I don't take literally every fight, I try to take ones that I at least have a chance with.
---
but if you had that many then you sould stay around Amamake, 7 fights in 3 hours is a lot for this area if you're talking about actual 1v1s. FW lowsec is where you'll find most fights.
---
Is this what propaganda has become in 2019?
---
:dagger:
---
No I don't want to reveal my details like that, what sane person will give up their cards on a reddit comment like that? It is up to you to believe me or not. I'm not going to force you, if you think it is a statement full of shit, then by all means carry on. It is mentioned because I have some experience in it. 
---
Imagine being so risk averse with a super, you sit in a fac war plex to farm killmarks lmao
---
Take Lasker up on this, he is a boss.
---
Is killing 1000 frigates in a large plex with a *supercarrier* impressive?
---
That's not actually the worst idea, making repair require some Triglavian material instead of paste.
---
you guys form thicc fleets, get those rage rolls going daily ;)
---
The power is yours to affect change. Just leave this place, and it won't be about shitposting here.
---
You probably can't do anything about rorquals, be they botted or human run. Such is your powerlessness.
---
That's a point not a scram, isn't it? You can still MJD ships under that effect afaik.
---
seeding your enemies staging with subtly incorrect doctrine fits really is an amazing form of sabotage.
---
Great write up! The quality content we need rather than fleet fights with shitty music in the background on youtube.
---
Just a piece of advice, while you were quite successful with the dual rep incursus, I really don’t recommend it for FW. The lack of range control means you will only every be able to kill inexperienced pilots as anyone worth their salt will just shoot you outside your range till they run out of tank/you die OR just disengage and leave. 
---
It does have its uses but there aren’t many. Instead I recommend going for a scram kilter or dual web control ship for sitting in novice plexes. Hit me up for ships and fits in an in game name, my name is the same as this reddit handle.
---
You should also work on your module placement. Anime is all about being your best or some shit.
---
Yeah, I was pretty disappointed, I kind of wanted to see it but it was cloudy here.
---
Mostly meant Frigates. Not really underpowered as much as uninteresting. They could have cool roles.
---
That one dude does. He's lonely.
---
this is the downside of having 17 FCs in a 9 man fleet :P
---
Shield gank fit is downright fun in a Hecate.
---
Can we please stop with the #changemymind bs, it's basically the #metoo movement for self righteous reddit tards. 
---
&gt;!Common wormholer being salty like normal. Bring the downvotes since your ego demands it. I've already won.!&lt;
---
Fite me 1v1 at sun
---
Good fight! That pilot was effectively AFK.  
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/74708714/
---
The dps you only get in sharpshooter mode so you lose a ton of tank. The Jackdaw is also slow for a brawler so there’s a risk of getting kited. Perhaps bad is an overstatement, it’s just not great for the cost.
---
Yeah the Fessor fit is like you said, the third mid is personal flavour. I like a sebo although cap booster or web is popular.
---
If you do max gank Hecate it should be Hull fit. If you do rep i alsways go single dead space. Dual rep is too cap hungry because of cycle time bonus
---
Not realistically from where he's positioned. Attempting to do so spawns defense fleets that would annihilate any ship that tries.
---
Not sure what the strength vs a ship mounted warp disruptor. Everytime I've seen it the icon appears to be a HIC point icon, so maybe it's an infinipoint? 
---
But the only advantage it has is the warp speed- which is a pretty nice advantage admittedly, but for a *painfully* slow blaster brawler I think that the lack of webs just absolutely cripples it outside of some fairly niche situations; even if your target has no web, the lack of it on the Hecate means that almost anything- even most cruisers- can dictate range on you by slowboating out of blaster range to scramkite you.
---
The hull gank fit is just massively better because it's much more difficult to try and control range on it since it has dual webs.
---
cringe
---
On a close look "returns" in videos 3-4-5 happen to be in 12 seconds. So Goons' point seems to be valid. Moreover, it would be 99% effective for a bot to retrieve once neutrals show up in local.
---
This thread is actually damaging efforts to raise awareness for actual issues like input broadcasters. I hope you edit and admit your mistake.
---
I FC some relaxed svipul fleets through lowsec occasionally, after nerfs they aren't insanely OP, but I still like 'em.
---
Nah it's just a shitpost.
---
Now I feel old. Jump Fatigue had only just been introduced before I went on a multiyear break. To me it's still a brand bew mechanic.
---
&gt; The dps you only get in sharpshooter mode so you lose a ton of tank. 
---
I think it's thinner compared to some of the other T3Ds but the main competition it has as far as rocket brawl destroyers would be the equivalent dual prop Flycatcher and triple prop Stork, and the latter only gets slightly more EHP than a SS Jackdaw with a shield link active.
---
Otherwise the main downside is that a SS Jackdaw is a lot slower- 801 m/s heated on a T2 AB vs 1202 for a Flycatcher or 1302 for a Stork.
---
The flipside of course is that the Jackdaw massively out-DPS's both, has unlocked damage compared to the Flycatcher (though lose a little application), and better projection than the Stork- plus that super swag reload bonus.
---
That you can then modeswap to propulsion, super-speed reload to faction rounds, and then instawarp out if need be makes it a really strong alternative IMO.
---
Compared to the Hawk you have better DPS, probably better range control (dual prop w/ web vs either scram+web or scram+dual prop on the Hawk), unlocked damage, and instawarp. On raw buffer and tank you at best break even and/or lack since the Hawk has good active tank and the option for the ADC, but the damage unlock, reload speed, and control I think makes it very competitive even so.
---
That said do you think a solo LML kite Jackdaw could be any good?
---
&gt; If you do rep i alsways go single dead space. 
---
I think personally I'd at least start out with a faction model just to make it a little easier to lose *lots* of them (since I will inevitably lose lots of them I'm sure), but I'm also not sure if an A-type will fit if you want Neutrons, and Neutrons for frig/destroyer blaster brawlers IMO are just very critical since the extra range both with and without Null is crazy high value.
---
But I do agree that dual rep is just too thirsty on cap with that cycle time bonus; you either need to compromise on the guns or something in order to get injector+nos or else run dual injectors, and the latter of course runs into the same problem the dual-rep Incursus generally has: a facebrawler with no control.
---
Holy hell that's amazing. Wish he could see it.
---
Good. Rorqual mining should be more similar to this.
---
Eh mine is about 50 planets and once you get the hang of it it's 3-4 minutes per character to reset them all and once a month 10 minutes per char to transport everything. 
---
Thank you
---
From the numbers an alpha should be able to fly a Porpoise with T1 drones.
---
Would be about the same isk/h as a venture but it would be a better gank target.
---
Nope. I actually agree with Goons on this one.
---
People still try to apply real world logic and norality to video games? Tell your friend he should learn to distinguish between reality and fantasy. 
---
Fc is getting killed by faction police, wat do
---
Maybe just as simple of an answer...  Are you in a manufacturing station?  Not all stations can build.
---
When you actually know the pilot bc you were in the Corp and you left bc they're bad
---
Don't forget to bring a towel
---
Command Destroyers are pretty cool; the Pontifex and the Magus are IMO much better at active tanking than the Bifrost/Stork, and I *think* all of them can get huge buffer tanks.
---
The Pontifex is limited to only 3 mids, so this does mean you can't really pack the MJFG which kind of sucks, but it's got better tank than the Magus due to a more even resist profile, *but* the Magus has the mids to bring MWD+injector+scram and the MJFG so you can boosh people away from their friends.
---
The Stork IMO is best with the triple prop fit:
---
    [Stork, triple prop]
---
    
---
    Ballistic Control System II
---
    5MN Y-T8 Compact Microwarpdrive
---
    Micro Jump Field Generator
---
    Faint Epsilon Scoped Warp Scrambler
---
    Fleeting Compact Stasis Webifier
---
    Republic Fleet Medium Shield Extender
---
    1MN Afterburner II
---
    Rocket Launcher II, Mjolnir Rage Rocket
---
    Shield Command Burst II, Shield Harmonizing Charge
---
    Small Anti-EM Screen Reinforcer II
---
    Small Bay Loading Accelerator II
---
Decent EHP (\~10.6k with the link running), tons of control with full tackle and an AB, and lots of ability to slingshot into/away from kiters with the MWD or just moonwalk out with the boosh button (or boosh things like lone Sabres off of gate so that you can kill them).
---
If you're flying as part of a gang then bring whatever links will be most useful; the triple prop fit is best for solo or maybe duo.
---
For gangs that want Skirmish links the Bifrost is frequently the "best" option though much of this is because of the fact that it's very easy to run it as a semi-AFK alt that brings links and a boosh button to the party, and the Magus is... less so.
---
Nullsec is owned by groups of players. There are limited opportunities for a solo player fo move in and live there, outside of NPC null. So I'd recommend you pick an alliance to join first.
---
Otherwise, just dive right in. You don't need any special ships or special skills, just good friends with the balls and the know how to take what they want and fight to keep it from the next group trying to do the same. 
---
Oof maybe later xd
---
dank fit

Just going to sleep after first day in WH, cant wait for tomorrow!
---
Excellent post, I couldn’t imagine playing the game not living in wormholes. No local is best local.
---
what kind of station ? the only kind my friend..
---
 CITADELS ARE NOT STATIONS
---
Yeah that bug has been around forever. I always hit F on each target to ensure my drones behave. Just second nature now.
---
This is a bad idea and will never happen because of how groups shape the story of the game.
---
Why should you be able to get your hands on a corp or alliance name / ticker for a group who used to be great and people still have fond memories of so you can reuse it.
---
Think of something original. My suggestion is Black Legion.....
---
I also flew with him before and after the split. Really nice guy. 
---
He will sorely be missed. 
---
That's generally what harassment fleets do. The trick is to catch them. For that, you need good tacklers. Unfortunately, in my experience, the only ones with good tacklers appears to be Pandemic Legion amongst PanFam in general.
---
1000 kills without dying is impressive.  I'm sure people have been hunting him forever and he's still alive.  It's risk averse, sure, but I don't know anyone else with 1000 kills against other players.  Do you have a ship with half that many killmarks?
---
Go to wormhole space instead.
---
Pretty much this ^
---
Read this and almost reflexively checked my scouts KB. I do this more than I’d like to admit.
---
A group with 1 member that hasn't been active for 10 years never made a dent in the lore.
---
Come back. There are many of us who’d help you get up and running. Most corps will give you starter ships and grinding up enough for a normal ship/steady income streams will likely take you only a couple days with your knowledge and established characters. 
---
This game is too fun to walk away from, you know that. 
---
Blaster Tristan maybe?
---
This is worthy of an o7
---
Excellent work.
---
I use Rushlock's Ares fit for nullsec, and the astero for wormholes to defang/delay my death incase backup can arrive.
---
Count me in. 
---
:big_think:
---
big oof
---
Horrible idea, Black Legion...... however......
---
well the answer is do you want to be a goon? if no then go lowsec, basgerin preferrably :)
---
Also why is the FC asking if you need to MJD, they should be making that decision
---
I'm just seeing this since I dont check Reddit often and he hasn't been in our corp for a while, but I am CEO of New Eden Allied Trade Order. I tried to get in contact with him on Discord a few times and figured he was just away for work since he left for weeks at a time.
---
I am incredibly sorry to hear about this. I'll have to let everyone else know. He was a great guy. He just showed up one day in our WH in a loki whole we were structure bashing dead POS left by older corps and started helping us out of the blue. Absolutely terrible to hear of this.
---
God forbid we couldn't play this game AFK anymore. God forbid the already PvE dominant drone boats get a mechanical nerf.
---
Also, as for competition, I am extracting from 12 plants the same way, I know there are 4-6 people using 2 or more accounts doing P4 chains in this one system.
---
I offered to share a list of what I was extracting  from what planets and they said it wasn’t close to worrying about.
---
Actually yes, are you recruiting?
---
I must have missed the original post about his passing. He was in my corp until sometime in November. This is terrible news. 
---
imagine being so salty that you kick goons off of the discord for mememing about getting banned. calling us cult members didn't help either. :P 
---
Is this the real life

Is this just fantasy?

Any guess on how much would a titan with 1% hull, no armor and all burned out guns cost to repair?
---
legit everyone fc's themselves, is more of a group think in our merry bunch of hooligans, sometimes its bites you in the ass ( see vid) most of the time we are epicly decent :)
---
Ya, he joined up with some of his old friends in my corp around that time. He was a great guy and his passing hit us all pretty hard. His passing is a terrible loss. 
---
That model is pretty impressive, man. Good sendoff.
---
If you don't mind me asking, was it 3D printed?
---
When I first got into carriers, what I really wanted to do was small scale fleet skirmishes with balanced composition.

What I got was TEST capital fleet balls of doing absolutely nothing other than showing force.

---
I am ceo of New Eden Allied Trade Order. I put a post up in the original thread just now as well.
---
He was a great guy. We were structure bashing one night and he decloaked in a loki and started helping us. Hopped in comms with us and stuck around for a few months helping us learn the ropes of WH living. He was a huge help when our wormhole got attacked by a much larger Corp and helped see us through in a major way. I'm really tired up to hear about this. 
---
Yes it was. White PLA on a Tinkerine Ditto Pro, in one piece. Hand painted. The stuff in the drone bays is blue tinted acrylic glass, laser cut.
---
why give away punchline in the title though? such opportunity to reel people who don't see the content into shitposting :P

Fucking hilarious. I was stalking your kb looking for AF fits and was wondering how you got that bhaal....

&gt;Holesale Operations

Name checks out. 
---
Ya man, he was always willing to help, always willing to jump in a strat and scan or post up his alt in a sabre. Absolute stellar pilot and just overall generally great dude. He will be missed. 
---
We have a memorial structure as a freeport in the jcode where he left us and a structure in our home named in his honour. 
---
This was a best of a fitting RL memorial as I could think of for his digital persona.

"Caracals off the open market" goes back to some of the dumb shit with Band of Brothers.  There had been a plan to keep Caracal blueprints to themselves and not allow the ships to be sold outside the alliance.  Among other things it came to represent any idea who's self evident impossibility is only out done by the stupidity required to believe said impossible idea was possible and for that matter good.

We should have a random purge hour everyday where local drops off and its a free for all.

Sometimes the factory window simply doesn't respond, even if you just successfully performed some other action. It's a weird bug. Close it, reopen it, try again. It usually works the second time. If not, the other replies all give good suggestions.

That's actually a pretty cool idea. I'd definitely want an options panel for what notifications I want. I'd definitely get annoyed with out of range notifications etc that seem kind of redundant.

Oh youve made a very important point. There should be individual toggles for every phrase.

Ya'll are gonna feel real retarded in a couple days.

100%. Allow me to pick which phrases get played and I'm sold.

We had your corps wormhole in the chain week or so ago. Felt like visiting Hollywood and seeing celebrities xD

Maybe record several phrases , and you can assign to several different actions. 
---
Phrase a
---
Phrase b

Phrase c
---
Action a is being locked

Actions b is being shot

Action c is losing your ship

If he was mass cloaking upon logging in by broadcasting, the time he saved last year calculates to be about 30 hours (say 5 minutes per mass log in for 365 days). If he was only logging in (and not cloaking), he was banned for a mere unharmful accident.

Meanwhile, tens of Delve Rorquals saves hundreds of Excavators each month via broadcasting the scoop command. They go unbanned because we don't have an army of reddit warriors behind us. In situations where 100 excavators disappear in a single dscan cycle, we can't even obtain proof. We know CCP won't even look at these cases. We know that, so most of us don't even bother to report. We are just expected to blindly believe that tens of Rorqual multiboxers we come across with every day is a high APM professional gamer. Until one of them fucks up, lights a cyno or speaks in local with multiple accounts. Even then, the cult mentality will stand behind cheaters of their own space cult.
---
So the game lost one of his best content creators for 30 days or more, just because he happened to be a Goon rival and banning standards apply to only to such people. On the day when there is no Goon rivals anymore, you'll realize you killed your own game.

If I wanted to grind all day sure I'd live in delve or some shit. I only have so much time to play this game so I prefer to live somewhere I can actually enjoy that time rather than ratting or mining or other shit I don't think is fun. Provi has constant small-mid size pvp conten with objectives I care about and it's where my friends are, I take that over being rich any day. Doesn't mean I can't dream about a super.
---
What?
---
I am living a better life out of poverty because Goonswarm is friendly toward botters. Many other people trying to live a better life are doing the same.
---
I have often lived in NPC nullsec, and it’s still one of my favorite areas in the game. The LP from missioning is usually profitable, and it offers the interest and challenges of living in nullsec without all the fuss and bother of sov ownership or living in a sov alliance. However, I think it could be better. 
---
It’s often been suggested by players that CCP allow us to drop iHubs in NPC nullsec and install ratting and mining upgrades in these systems. The motive is obvious: players want that super sweet nullsec ISK, and they don’t necessarily want to remain beholden to sov alliances in order to get it. It's also a pretty fair observation that sov null has become one of the safest areas to carebear in the game, so the logic of "the rewards should match the risk" no longer really explains why it's so much more lucrative. 
---
However, allowing player alliances to establish sov in NPC nullsec defeats the entire purpose of NPC nullsec. I think the far more elegant solution would be for NPC nullsec factions to drop their own TCUs and iHubs in their own nullsec systems. Their sov index would be a measure of either the number of missions completed or the delta of reputation gained with that NPC Faction over a particular time period. Once the NPC sov index is maxed out by missionaries, military and industry iHub upgrades automatically unlock and apply across their systems. Those indexes may increase in the usual manner, by ratting and mining in them, spawning more and better anomalies. 
---
If CCP really wants to make it interesting, once all the indexes are maxed out, a special NPC-themed event spawns in some random constellation, much like an incursion, where players can defend the Faction’s sov from attack by one of its NPC enemies. If the players fail to properly defend the space, then the sov index gets reset and must be raised again. If they win, they get mad loots and the opportunity to keep farming the upgrades until the next attack.
---
This system would have several virtues. First, it respects missioning as a popular activity in NPC nullsec and brings missionaries into the player ecosystem in a new, very positive way. Obviously as the space becomes more valuable for ratting and mining, it will attract a more diverse group of carebears, as well as players hoping to attack those carebears, which will necessitate defense fleets to protect those carebears. This creates a synergy which makes the game more interesting for everyone. The indexes would give additional intel on the relative activity of these areas of space for players. This system could also be ported into lowsec and hisec, where instead of the empires attacking the pirate factions, the local rats get frisky and start attacking the empire in a more interesting way.
---
Another compelling feature of this system is how it creates story-driven opportunities across New Eden. For example, it makes me sad that Outer Ring is not the best mining space in the game. Story-wise, that doesn’t make any sense. With the new player-owned bases and Rorqual buffs, the place should be abuzz with ORE-themed mining fleets, but instead it remains one of the quieter areas of New Eden. However, if players had a way of improving the number and quality of anomalies in this region, that might change. As you point out, pirate faction space in particular is primed for story-driven events, and for those of us who run missions it would be cool for that to really be taken to the next level.
---
The Astrahus offers significantly better protection, and adding more structures may disincentivize attacks as they become a pain for attackers (though do be careful about adding too many, having a dozen Raitarus and an offline Azbel makes you look like easy money). 
---
If you need multiple clones (with different implants), or need more structure services than a single Raitaru can provide, then feel free to get an Astrahus though most industrialists will manage with just the one engineering facility. 
---
&gt;Aside from isk, there's no reason for miners to use barges/exhumers unless they want mercoxit. That's just totally nuts.
---
For the entire rest of the game not under a super umbrella, subcap mining is pretty good.
---
nah, high grade talismans on a 7 neut bhaalgorn is the shit my dude.
---
The other guy is wrong. Gas harvesting equipment will receive the benefits of Mining Foreman bursts for range and yield. 
---
&gt; Until one of them fucks up, lights a cyno or speaks in local with multiple accounts.
---
uh, hello?
---
Thanks a lot for the compliment. It's been the one thing I needed to work on for a while now. I still see a lot of room for improvement, and my hands are still very shaky, but I'm glad I can get compliments out of it now.

I painted it with a single small paint brush, a few toothpicks, a needle and some string (to draw the red lines).

Do you even play eve?

&gt;but i installed the latest driver
---
Well there is your problem.
---
Is there actually any positive to installing drivers as they come out? I usually only install them when a new game i get says I need them.
---
I'd say it's a stretch to call him one of the games best content creators. He's just another butthurt anti goon claiming to be npsi but focused solely on delve because he's too shit to hunt any other region or without blue alts. Broadcasting is broadcasting regardless of who you are. Too bad more people don't end with the same fate. I'd have a lot less krabs at moon fracks to contend with
---
Small gang is not an F1 fleet.
---
It's normally just a hectic conversation between everyone.
---
It's his first broadcasting ban. I'm not sure whether you need a second broadcasting ban or second ban to get permabanned. But I'm sure CCP would be willing to bend grey area issues to your benefit if you made 10 more threads about it.
---
Hit me with a ban wave, it doesnt really matter. I'll reeee
---
lmao
---
Your argument is "if he was just using it correctly!" which ignores the fact that CCP has a *lot* of data on how people interact with the game. They've done multiple panels and presentations on this demonstrating the level of data they have. When it comes to "Who do I trust" and it's between a raving lunatic on reddit or the data driven company, well, I'll choose the company.

Our fleets are at most about 15 people we still have an FC in charge.

For a mod you have a very questionable definition of 'raving lunatic'.

As for calling people dumb for not using the report BOT function for input broadcast, that's pretty ironic. Also the report bot function barely works for bots, why would it work any better for input broadcasters? 
---
Well... You know.  Rules as written and rule as enforced. This is just to long to get in to, but people have had there power cut because of it.   They were playing outside the rules
---
&gt; So the game lost **one of his best content creators** for 30 days or more, **just because he happened to be a Goon rival**
---
  Lol really? *Really?* You are special mate. And it was because he fucked up and input broadcast in local chat. Not because he was a "rival to goons". Spin harder.
---
  
---
&gt; He's just another butthurt anti goon claiming to be npsi but focused solely
---
This is another completely brain dead Goon narrative. You can't do 40% of all nullsec's farm, stack 1/2 of all nullsec's ratting supers and 2/3 of all nullsec's Rorquals in the same region, then blame a group purely specialized on killing PvE capitals for getting most of their kills in that region. Every time they roll into Delve it's a way better chance than anywhere else. What do you expect them to do? Hunt in Outer Ring?
---
I’m not saying they’re bad, I’m saying they aren’t worth shit because they’re overfarmed
---
&gt; calling us cult members didn't help either

  Screenshot?

To be fair... if you KNOW you can tackle rorquals in x region its a big factor in your decision making as an fc where to go :D And EUTZ issnt very actively rorqual mining (outside the imperium) for some reason lately...

About the content creator comment tho... the guy was best at making people dock and not do anything so id argue he probably created as much content for people as he denied at the same time (but who knows)

You can't call broadcasting off a dscan, remember there are intel channels, if you get reported in a system, most of the people in the systems next door are already sitting ready to pull their drones. I would say in the busy systems we are usually about 7 different people mining in an enorm. Each of them pulling drones for 2 or 3 rorqs can easily make it look like someone is "broadcasting" to you. 
---
The only people who would be able to see and get proof of broadcasting are the guys on grid with the broadcaster and GM's when they look at logs. 
---
you literally take reddit to a whole other level

Yes I have been but its been a little scary. I have yet to pop again but the nature of the mwd means I am very susceptible to scrams. Not to mention accidentally flying out of the zone when kiting. All and all, I'm not really a fan of my current set up. My goal is to basically get to what you explained. A fit that will do one or two types of filaments very comfortably and relaxed. I cant describe it fully but my current fit really stresses me out when I fly it. Its very high maintenance when flying and not that much relaxy :)

My definition of raving lunatic is Olmeca_gold. Pretty sure I used it accurately!

&gt;  Also the report bot function barely works for bots, why would it work any better for input broadcasters?

CCP works off of reports. If you do not report them, they live. If you're on some holy crusade against bots - as olmeca is apparently is attempting to do - you would use your only effective method.
---
It was a long time ago but BL dropped like 100 tier 3 bc on our cfc carrier group and blapped blapped blapped carriers until they lost critical mass and then walked out. Was great to see. 
---
An NPSI FC is much more valuable to this game than any content creator in any nullsec entity. Bombers Bar is the only entity that can provide regular super/rorqual kills to hundreds of people who don't want to deal with politics, bullshit and strings attached with null alliance membership. He is the top FC and innovator of Bombers Bar. You just know him as a camper. Besides, he went into camping to kill ships. If he denied zombie anomaly farm to some turbokrabs, so be it. That's not real content and overfarming is actually harmful to Eve ecosystem atm.

Also you literally did not answer my question, the topic of discussion is not bots, it's input broadcasters.

&gt; You can't call broadcasting off a dscan, remember there are intel channels, if you get reported in a system

You know I log into random systems in Delve 15 times a day right? If not, perhaps get more knowledge on how I operate before giving me advice.
---
&gt; The only people who would be able to see and get proof of broadcasting are the guys on grid with the broadcaster and GM's when they look at logs.
---
No. Sometimes a 15-boxer of Rorquals doesn't notice until I land on grid, then scoops at the same server tick. The other day a 10-boxer targeted/blapped my ships same tick when they were approaching for the chain boosh. There are plenty of incidents where we actually notice broadcasting beyond the dscan.
---
Imagine being in retarded enough to believe you aren't

Then again you are a spodcel lmao

oh yea because a 100 man bomber gang surely brings more content than the entire last years worth of wars, ok

You strawmanned me and are now upset that I disregarded your strawman. Neither Olmeca nor myself were talking about a 'report bot' function. The only one that brought it up is you. It's good to know to see you are intelligent and unbiased though. The quote and context are about reporting something in general. I know this is difficult from you seeing as you're jumping into a thread from an active brigade and all - but maybe apply a little effort?
---
&gt;  Worse yet, we know CCP won't even look at these cases. We know that, so most of us don't even bother to report.

Forever and a day buddy

&gt;"Currently we don't even know whether "report bot" also applies to broadcasters. A bot is definitely very different than a broadcaster, as broadcasting looks manual on a single account and should be checked across accounts. Maybe we are expected to send a mail to the security team."

Well done you used straw man in a sentence, how very original of you.
---
Somebody call the wambulance we got an emergency. Major butthurt.

Yeah, because since 9 months ago when I first began to bomb I was never mass reported due to slandering fucks like you. They banned mar5hy for a local incident in a couple of weeks. But somehow they let me kill 1 trillion and steal 1.5 for 9 months until you made one last slander. I'm super scared.

---
&gt;They banned mar5hy for a harmless local chat incident
---
So if it's *'harmless'*, it's okay to broadcast input?  TIL
---
Glad to see you've changed your mind over the last few minutes and are now okay with the use of said mechanism by miners to retrieve excavator drones since that is also 'harmless' and hurts no one.
---
i believe you have been brainwashed. dont worry fam i gotchu. let me explain: when you dont live in the swamp you can use methods wich give you MUCH more isk per/h wich in turn means you have to grind LESS. instead of dreaming with having a super you could actually have one and use it. doesnt necesarilly means you have to grind extensively, you just have to be smarter. yeah friends are cool, maybe you should convince them to leave the swamp all together !
---
So because ccp doesnt catch one type of bot/input broadcasting they should ignore an easy to verify(char logins to server and cloak commands sent by clients from same ip) one that's been brought up to them?
---
Assuming you're being honest and this isn't a Grr Goons Incognito Mode post, I hope you get banned.
---
And in my eyes cloaky campers that camp entire regions with their alt armies just force people to not do anything or only do it with a massive fleet ready to form. Yes he caught some stuff doing that but how many roaming gangs have roamed through that space not finding anything cause everyone is docked with don trolleone in local?
---
&gt; solo LML
---
I probably fly the jackdaw lml solo as much as anyone, my stance is that you have a very narrow engagement profile.  Prop mode max skills with meta mwd only hits 2.2km/s, which can easily get hunted down by assault frigs.  Without blinging anything other than pithc sb and expanded soe launcher, you're going to be running into cap issues if you aren't overheating your cap booster.  People have claimed that jackdaw can work solo using extenders, but I haven't really seen that done well.
---
If you move up from solo to slightly larger groups of 2-4 pilots, it has an easier time dealing with things, as whatever you're shooting at is usually focused on other ships, and jackdaw can point things if needed.  Dps is low, and it can be rammed by about anything.
---
Light missile launcher will overheat in 6-9 cycles depending on rng.  I've lost my launchers and subsequently my jackdaw more than once this way.
---
How does input broadcasting benefit someone like Marshy exactly?
---
&gt;Don’t blame the thief, it’s not his fault, blame the people who own houses with stuff in it
---
You know the chief of police in South Africa actually said that, with something in place of the stars.. Don’t blame the thief, it’s not his fault, blame the \*\*\*\* people who own houses with stuff in it 
---
You might be on to something. 
---
Rorqual broadcasting is as easy to verify as mar5hy broadcasting. The decider is who creates the most noise, because there seems to be nobody regularly looking into these cases at CCP until someone makes 10 threads and possibly bags them on csm level. Yes, if that's gonna be the decider then CCP might as well ignore their own rule until they fix the uneven enforcement of rules.
---
It also depends on which assault frig, I think the hecate could still deal with amarr/minmatar assault frigs due to their t2 resists, whereas caldari/gallente afs it will have much larger issues with.
---
Ask him
---
If you are hitting 5 ships. All 5 of them repair for the longer possible time. Needing more DPS to kill them.
---
By "not doing anything" you just mean "not doing pve". Unchecked ultra safe pve is literally the cancer killing of this games macroeconomy ATM. Every bit of isk ör minerals he prevented from being generated is a positive thing for Eve.
---
I'm asking you because you're up in arms right now, how do you think input broadcasting benefits someone like Marshy with his playstyle?
---
Awesome writeup, and sounds like you had some cool fights.
---
I see some familiar faces in those killmails too :)

Sorry, can't take this comment seriously if you think saving drones from people who wanna kill or steal them hurts no one. Enjoy your brain death. O7

REEEE, I read the post but didn't check your username.

Did CCP ever respond with anything in the past to the videos you used to send ?
---
The Agency is the primary tool used by capsuleers to discover opportunities available in New Eden.

Open the Agency from your NeoCom by clicking on the icon.

Yeah I think the lack of interesting quests and pve content is one of the main boundaries keeping new people from playing the game and sticking with it...
---
I know how to make tons of money relatively quickly. I've done it in the past. I just don't think any of those things are fun. Shooting NPCs, mining, playing the market, industry, hauling, I've tried it all and while I made good money I dont enjoy any of those things. So why do them if I enjoy living down in my swamp with all the other swamp people? Being rich isn't gonna get me anything since I would just do what I do now but with a bigger number in my wallet. Sure I could own a super but tbh I don't want to fly one in a fleet. I've flown carriers in big fleets and its pretty mediocre. It would either be a hangar ornament or some solo/small gang something or other that would never get kills since I'm not good enough at this game to do that well. So yeah I'm not brainwashed, I just enjoy playing the game differently.
---
Remember kids, differing opinions does not mean someone is wrong.
---
We are the borg.

??? Some background would be nice.

&gt; So if it's 'harmless', it's okay to broadcast input? TIL

Examples of allowed Input Broadcasting and Input Multiplexing are actions taken that do not have an impact on the EVE universe and are carried out for convenience:

• EVE Online client settings

• Window positions and arrangements (of the EVE Online client in your operating system’s desktop environment)

• The login process

Has the roam already happened?

You don't get to have it both ways. Input broacasting (aka cheating) is either 'harmless' (as you said) or it isn't. Can't take your position seriously if you don't see that what mar5hy did and what your rorqual foes (allegedly) do are the same thing.
---
Agreed
---
They finally do it?
---
Also my apologies to perfectionist crowd for my crappy cropping.

As commenter below said report and ban both. But a proper bot would add some randomness to account for mouse movements. The guy logging in and cloaking likely wouldn't since he like a lot from his group don't see what he did as a big deal meaning he likely had it straight up doing them all at once.

3 weeks ago he got caught input broadcasting by having all of his campers chat at once.  All of EveTM rushed to his defense because of course he would never do such a thing in combat.  Justice was, however, served.

I never talked about bots. I don't think there are many rorq bots in delve. There are some super bots and many vni bots. I talked about broadcasters. They use isboxer the same way mar5hy does, when they need

Imagine being this hateful of a person.
---
i think you miss the point - go watch the streams of BB. the amount of holes that go to delve seems to be like 70% with the other 30% being whichever backwater legacy are currently holding.
---
it's not about them killing more in delve, it's about them seeming to automatically rolling any non-delve hole. aka, specifically going after one target at the exclusion of all others.
---
Good thing you're not talking about doing something in the video game, you're talking about banning someone's account(s) - a is a real action against a real person's paid for goods i.e. the video game they are playing.

I have a Hookbill fit to compliment the Hawk fit we use for T3s for our lower SP dudes. I didn't know it until we were in a site, but the dude flying the hookbill was an alpha! I am not entirely sure if 3 of them can do T3s, but I feel confident that 3 of them could definitely do T2s. I need to start experimenting more! 
---
If you're interested, I have an ingame channel I'm trying to get more people in from streaming that serves as a little "collection" point for abyssal fits. The channel is "Abyssal Lurkers" and it's a work in progress! So far the only frigate fits I have in that channel are the Retribution, Hawk, and Hookbill. I really want to expand that! Sixstring and Erschlag did a stream the other day where they did T3s in 13m Punishers and while they did die a few times, 1 of them made it out of a T3 with over 400m in loot, I gotta get that fit from them. 
---
&gt;I think that equally responsible are the alliances who give us a home.
---
no - it isn't up to players to police botting. it's ccp's job.
---
the only thing i expect corps to do is filter out spies and awoxers best they can.
---
There's actually a surprising amount of lore in the game already. But the best stuff is that which is derived from player actions (some of which is seen in the info of random collectors items that has been given out around christmas and such). 
---
hes still sensative about it
---
Hit F1 sent his pod home
---
very cool
---
This is what happens when you feed ur bots 2 much adderall...
---
Shit, I wish my market would update that fast, making sell orders takes like 4 minutes with all the lag.

[This needs to be a Trade Good in Eve](https://www.amazon.com/Pipedreams-PD9804-62-Anal-Eaze-Desensitiz/dp/B007YSIL7U)  Might help with all the butthurt

"Must have" doesn't mean anything. Someone who multiboxes dozens of cloaky campers doesn't need input broadcasting for them except for logging on and adjusting windows, all of which is allowed under the input broadcasting ruleset that CCP has. From the outside it looks like idiots who are being fed a narrative are swallowing it hook line and sinker and can't use any of their meager brainpower to think for themselves and instead parrot back and forth the same tired story.
---
CCP doesn't ban delve botters with their perfectly timed actions, or multicasters when you have 20+ cynos light within 1 server tick  
---
but one dude camping those guys?  
---
he gets banned,  
---
Really makes you think 
---
&gt; I don't think there are many rorq bots in delve.
---
but yet
---
**that's all you fucking post about**
---
&gt;Justice was, however, served.
---
Debatable.
---
yikes
---
Is typing in paragraphs that difficult?
---
I wanna see this debate.
---
Yes but why would a regular person play this game at all?
---
Mama, cyno had just gone up
---
the way they were talking about it makes it sound like a troll, guess we'll see in a week or two
---
&gt; From the outside it looks like idiots who are being fed a narrative are swallowing it hook line and sinker and can't use any of their meager brainpower to think for themselves and instead parrot back and forth the same tired story
---
  But CCP have obviously found proof of dodgy shit and banned him? Doesn't matter who's meming what on reddit- It was reported, and action was taken. Criticising people based on "brainpower" doesn't change that fact.
---
This has been posted at least 3 or 4 times already.
---
Search marshy posts on the discord and you’ll find it. I would screenie but I’m banned
---
actuaalllly you should ask mar5hy what use input broadcasting serve(s) him, not the other way around
---
Or is it perhaps more along the lines of people engaging in a Reddit campaign (the same thing that has Been maligned plenty on this sub) to witchhunt people until CCP acts.
---
Pretty sure everyone of those got banned within like an hour.
---
As a bombers bar FC I'm glad marshy got banned. All the awoxing he was attracting was starting to take a toll on our morale. Thank you goons. 
---
Did you guys use a fucking titan to bump that orca out of tether?
---
Yes exactly that. 
---
Dude, you went full retard. Never go full retard when lying through your teeth.
---
i was never in pospy, but i can't believe they wouldn't have a discord or slack or something you could use to get a hold of someone without logging in
---
Fuck me now that's in my Amazon history.
---
Wow, I didn't even think you guys existed still.
---
I mean, I don't know. You'd have to ask him. 
---
If there isn't any good in it, why did he?
---
Atleast COAD had a pleb filter.
---
you just said, on the comment above that you DREAM about a super... am i missing something ?
---
Nice work
---
This is absurd. 
---
It’s time to stop. 
---
its those damn goons and the  gsm that did this.
---
collecting corpses is weird. Scanning is awesome for a month ,mediocore next month and than it more like niche .
---
&gt; until CCP acts
---
  How dare CCP responds to tickets!
---
Die quietly. &lt;3
---
UALX was intense and fun for us.  It was a final stand where we put everything on the line for the fight, didn't get blueballed, fought, and won.  
---
If we had lost there it would have crippled us for a long time after.  But we didn't, and we anchored the new keep less than twelve hours later.
---
Sorry it is so late, but respects should be paid to the fallen.  
---
How many carrots did you eat? 
---
"regular person" "jita fuckery" .... I agree, pick one.
---
I think supers are cool. I started playing Eve because I saw supers and titans and thought it was the coolest shit. I still think they are the coolest shit. If I could have any one thing in Eve it would be a classic swagnarok, and I would love to have a sup because they are awesome gigantic scifi space ships. Flying one though? Meh, don't need to. I've always found fast and small more fun, or logi in fleets. I've been flying caps (dread, carrier, fax) for years and with very few exceptions I have more fun with subcaps.
---
Then don’t go to the wtfamazon sub either.  But it does makes shopping more fun :)
---
The only thing impressive about this is the amount of autism required to persist in such a risk averse style of gameplay for so long.
---
&gt; Someone who multiboxes dozens of cloaky campers doesn't need input broadcasting for them except for logging on and adjusting windows, all of which is allowed under the input broadcasting ruleset that CCP has.
---
I mean, why this may be true.
---
He did something that wasn't allowed. So...
---
Obvious troll is obvious.
---
1 Super average high skill tick, 120-140m.  Ticks per hour, 3.  Hours per day 20-23.  ISK per day, perfect farm, 9.66bn.  
---
Going rate of ISK &lt;-&gt; Euro, aprox 1$ per 1bn isk for the seller, 3-5$ per bn for the buyer.
---
Thus, 1 super = 10$ per day before account cost.  Thus 1 super @ 140m ticks @ 23h / day @ 30d/mo = ~300$.
---
8,000 euro = 25 super bots, perfect, undisterbed.
---
Enabling it when disabled by default. I guess only he can tell us all the ways he used it. Typically one doesn't turn on a banned feature if one is playing by the rules. Not really our job to prove anything. CCP has the facts and acts accordingly. 
---
To be fair, that's probably not the worst thing Apothone has but in his mouth... o.O 
---
People used to do this in world of warcraft so annoying. 
---
Well it sure helps him pull off the two bombing runs where he killed that whole pile of mackinaws twice.
---
Honestly you seem to be right, or there wouldn't be so many people in highsec that do it.
---
And you know, now that I look at this again, there are some advantages to the subcap boosting ships I hadn't noticed before.
---
Even a porpoise can easily beat the mining output of a rorq using tech 2 mining drones if it's not in its industrial mode, which I'm not very familiar with but I believe immobilizes it for a full 5 minute cycle.
---
That's a *long* time for thumb twiddling.
---
So if you're *not* going to be able to get help, a porpoise looks a heck of a lot more attractive - not only because it's so much more mobile, but is also much cheaper. Even *when* you die, replacing it won't cost much more than a barge.
---
Still.
---
I'd like to present the argument that even given the insane skill, isk, and support requirements (eg, super umbrella) that a rorqual really needs to do its thing - it shouldn't outperform everything else, and certainly not to the degree it does.
---
In my opinion all that does is ensure everyone who *doesn't* have said umbrella be completely unable to compete - so the rich get richer and stomp everyone else.
---
Botting rorquals have become self-aware and are now shitposting on reddit?
---
But now I've gone and Blopsed it all away
---
remember, you are getting down voted, not because you are a retard saying stupid shit, its because of goons.
---
Hold onto the hate in your heart friend.
---
All of garaas accounts got perma banned for that. I am sure ccp is going through any and all delve rorq bots that people report and look into them but you do have to remember that some of our dudes are "special" enough to just plain multibox lots of rorqs but the ones that bot can get fucked imo. Not every rorq in delve is a bot though
---
Those damn Goony  Goons!
---
Why not make some reddit posts about it for a couple of weeks?
---
w8... like.. i give 0 fucks about this Mar5hy guy, don't know him.. but this.. right there.. isn't imperium THE biggest afk cloacky camping group with DBRB's camping program? something something pot and kettle?
---
&gt; He's just another butthurt anti goon
---
He camps where the easy frags are, keep drinking that koolaid. A couple of months ago dinoposters would have called him anti TEST.
---
This and make sure the materials required are in your hanger and not your ship
---
But you couldn't as you had carpal tunnel syndrome... click, click, click, click, click, click....
---
&gt;  All of EveTM rushed to his defense
---
Nobody rushed to his defense, I think mainly those affiliated with Bombers Bar.
---
Gaara's Sniper got banned.
---
I call bullshit. Nice troll.
---
He is visiting his SO in Bulgaria atm, that's why his accounts are all offline
---
I'm out of the loop. Can someone explain?
---
Here is a shovel, your going to need it for the downvote chain your most likely going to get
---
The _horror_!!
---
And these new age computer security morons say 'security by obscurity' is nonsense.
---
By logging in and insta cloaking dozens of characters.  Remember, any one command can only do one thing for one character.  Using a program to input broadcast the cloak command to multiple cloaky campers on login is a breach in itself.
---
He also has used it to coordinate excavator bombing runs by multiple characters. 
---
At any rate ccp investigated and found evidence to issue the bans for input broadcasting.  Its well deserved, and for them to have done so they would have had to have strong evidence to take that action on dozens of paying accounts. 
---
Yeah that's exactly what I'm saying.
---
Where are you guys located? We can bring some fights if you're really that bored hahaha... 
---
Line have been drawn... you think that will stop?
---
You gotta start actually being neutral...
---
Your talking about Garra with that cyno thing in Delve...and he got perma banned within 12 hours of that happening. Just saying
---
CCP are doing lore stuff, but they've been rather low-key about it.  Not a lot of folks are even aware, and the Roleplayers are kinda hogging the fun on it at the moment, because no one else will pick up the ball. As such, CCP will probably keep it very small-scale until people give a fuck in numbers of over a couple dozen.
---
Yes please we need it
---
Really?
---
NC. Or did I miss/whoosh something on an ironic question?
---
Well, makes sense. I wasn't following this sub very closely, but got reminded with this random ad popping up.
---
CCP biased confirmed :( All mar5hy wanted was justice. When he was ranting with his screechy voice on stream " I WILL CAMP DEM FOREVAH" !
---
Send him ingame an evemail and ask him ! 
---
Sounds resonable to me. What else would you do with a super? Actually use it to grind another one? 
---
&gt;Fuck me
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Freighter. Autopilot.
---
Best way to get from Jita to Amarr without trouble, eh?
---
Really? A video about killing an Orca? Fucking hell BL.... has fallen so low. Not even CODE post videos of killing Orcas...think about that
---
tbh i feel bad to say this, but the Dunning Kruger in mar5hy was way stronger then in Olmeca\_Mold :/
---
for morons yes
---
Fuck off.
---
If I'm ever to expand this report to a different class of ships, it probably will be T1 destroyers as the second most common class in FW after frigates. But it won't happen anytime soon.
---
Cheer up mate, 
---
I thought the Ragnarok bumping an orca was funny, and apparently so did the majority of other viewers.
---
No, go away.
---
&gt;won
---
&gt;tapi flair
---
hmm
---
Which is nothing lol 
---
I was more commenting on the idiot OP than your response
---
Could potentiality save a little time by cloaking all accounts with 1 button after login. 
---
tldr qq
---
&gt; Since when that mechanic is a glitch?
---
Oh I'm sorry, it's just a typo. NPC enemies which does not respond to incoming fire whatsoever is totally legitimate mechanic.
---
Malediction with Cold Iron skin.  Don't forget to wave at the passing sabre.
---
Less actual players in this game is what we desperately need, thanks CCP!
---
well im not dbrb and just because the alliance im in is in the imperium dorsnt mean i have to like everything he or his alliance or even init does. And i think you should also consider the difference between 100 guys being organized by one guy to hurt hostiles during a strategic campaign to lower adms and one guy running 100 clients to find that one rorqual here and there for his npsi fleets. My argument was simply that its hard to tell how content it actually creates at the end of the day.
---
i used to run explo with astero and decent solo kb, i've met only people who btfo as soon as i enter local and other people who tries to catch me with at least one T3C.
---
apparently i decided to use pve only fit when i want iskies , and than just pvp with a ship and fit i want .
---
&gt; The other day a 10-boxer targeted/blapped my ships same tick when they were approaching for the chain boosh.
---
I have done that to plenty of people who landed on my Rorqs while mining. Most commonly known as Drone Assisting to a dedicated Drone Bunny. Who needs IsBoxer to make 50 Sentries shoot someone when you can use the in-game mechanics
---
if he would cloaky camp bitting systems i would 100% agree
---
Dual rep is pointless vs exolorers so you are down a slot in 1v1 astero fight. Capacitor/batteries and drones is what decides fight.
---
So having dron amp can help you kill drones faster.
---
Dual rep is for fighting stuff like sabre or something.
---
Your angle of argument is dumb but marshy routinely drops multiple characters to do something at the same time - such as ganking drones in an anom. Control groups exist with some IB software. Dscan could be another potential use, off the top of my head.
---
He was caught red handed input broadcasting... l
---
Then why ban him long after that campaign ended?
---
These dudes are saltier then HK after losing 3 keepstars 
---
You still play this shit game?
---
Why even bother being apart of this garbage community when all the good shit posters and pvpers quit you know it's gone down hill when they bounced
---
Nah he was camping me too.
---
Someone call the goddamn police what a brutal and unforgiving crime against humanity!
---
Fuck yourself, hope you get permabanned
---
Hi
---
Nice Troll, try harder next time.
---
Uh, Garaa?
---
not sure if he's referring to ingame ui windows or eve client windows, because moving the latter using input broadcasting is completely legal and allowed by ccp
---
check the link here https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/aiikco/week_3_of_mar5hywait_thank_you_ccp/eeoa6l4/
---
What a load of crap.
---
Main issue with cov ops is align speed and speed.
---
Astero with double nano has sub 2s align and its faster. Astero can crash gate camps with ease.
---
If you get caught by combat fit astero you are dead in semi combat astero.
---
So if you dont want to fight double nano is way to go.

Don't actually play, no, but I have been banned before twice for literally the stupidest reasons so I understand the plight.
---
Eris is great when you want to dump 1000 dps on someone with polarized blasters but in it's role it's admittedly trash. 
---
br : https://zkillboard.com/related/30002930/201901212100/
---
Agreed really need more interesting pve / quest/ lore stuff. Even though what the new tutorial had us do was so basic ,I was absolutely blown away by how cool it was all the story involved there unlike the brainless missions or ratting sites we have now. Basically do more stuff in the style of the tutorial.
---
And what are your brilliant insights regarding this ban?
---
Tbh as i dislike mining - i disagree - due to simple reason.        
---
None of the ingame mechanics should be annoying and linked to "how fast and long you can click".             
---
fair enough.. the irony lvl's was over 9000 when a imperium was complaining over cloaky camping but i see your point
---
Hell yea man wormholes are great. Some times I miss my Nyx but it never saw much use anyway.  
---
The one thing I like about wormholes above all else is a seeming sense of honor between us all. Doing honor brawls with groups smaller and larger than us is quite common and if shit goes down like people trying to evict you people that you have never even heard of will be offering to help.
---
I just killed a man...
---
Well, go on, let us judge you. What are the two reasons?
---
Actually sounds cool.  
---
As long as it's configurable and can be turned off.
---
First, in local, saying “I will slit your throat in the name of Allah” (permad for IRL threat lmfao)
---
Second, in local, 2015, linking a fake killmail that opened your map, apparently crashed some peoples clients during a fight. (Permad lol)
---
Both reduced to 30d after petition.
---
You're building a straw man (grr Goons input broadcast and grr CCP ignores it). You can have no idea whether either is true or not (none of us can).
---
Anyone, no matter which alliance they are from, should be banned for broadcasting/botting.
---
Please ban Mar5hyyyyyyyyy 
---
Underrated comment and lmao at all of the goonies trying to do an “akchually ur rong”. 
---
Did you forget the part where they fucked you over?
---
Recently i was trying to compete with a market bot.       
---
Annoyng as hell.      
---
You have 200 orders up adjust it just for them to be outbided by random(0.1 to 1ISK).       
---
How do i know that this is a bot?           
---
Well tell me how a sane person (even using ESI) below 40s can outbid a random order out of 200 ? ALWAYS when a char is online, and sometimes it was online like 20h ....           
---
If you tried to compete with it - he paused on this order after 2-3 outbids for a random 15-35min.           
---
If you did raise and order by above 10% of previous value - the order was ignored for few hours - as i guess the guy come and accept it or adjust manually.            
---
CCP need to step up with detection of this kind of bots - they are fucking up gameplay of normal players. 
---
Because it's Eve and people do shit like that
---
You should try to put your own mark on the game. Be original, and when that fails, use dots ;)
---
TBH i am expecting a  ruse cruise at this point.          
---
This is why I come to this subreddit.
---
Minerbumping.com is good for HiSec news.
---
I support enforcing rules
---
https://i.imgur.com/vErzBpM.png
---
That’s pretty much all I did in Fountain for months.
---
i have more solo kills with brawling swipul (past-nerf) than with a brawl hecate with the same fit price. meanwhile on paper hecate is better.
---
I think it will be a ruse cruise :D
---
You can fit what, 2-3 supers in a max system?  So this guy has 3-10 systems to himself, 24/7, in delve?  Sure...
---
https://i.imgur.com/qSTkz3L.png
---
Actually being neutral would help this, BB is not NPSI.
---
Cheers :3
---
First of all i think you are to old to watch cartoons ... but then people are doing much stranger things at older age.      
---
Second of all - this mechanic should be adjusted.                 
---
Imagine yourself if we could get anomaly having only those diamond shaped rats in it - &gt; of course adjusted a bit so they don't alpha anything getting close. 
---
So corps should openly accept botters?
---
I suppose that tax isk is decent income and you don't need to give a shit, that's ccps problem.
---
CCP usually doesn’t temp ban, there have been fringe cases, of conduct unbecoming of an eve player or leader that have resulted in temp bans before, however, the norm is...you get banned. You’re banned. They don’t have to tell you anything about why you were banned other than you broke their ToS. Sucks for your roommate, but s/he shouldn’t have been botting/input cloning/RMTing. Have a good day.
---
&gt;The user agreement (EULA) has been thoroughly reviewed and no rules have been broken.
---
:thinkingface:
---
some real gems in there "I'M NOT SALTY, YOU'RE SALTY" and admitting bannable offenses and encouraging people to partake (account sharing).
---
RIP xD

I'm in a 180 man corp, probably around 30ish real people, maybe... i alone have 7 alts and thinking of making more
---
it also saves him from getting his camper scanned down while logging in
---
Corps should be responsible for policing botters.
---
Cos, it's not their fucking job to do so. It's ccp's job.
---
It took months for him to get banned after he did it the first time he got dread bombed by PL.
---
Months and months after it was obvious to anyone without major spodbrain. 
---
I knew a guy who had a non-aligned dominix in some random system in querious. The character had been kicked out of a renters alliance months before, but it was a drone ratting domi so he could keep hunting forever without docking and just send the money to his PVP alts. The system was out of the way so he somehow got away with it for a long time.  This was like 5 years ago, though.

---
Big alliances usually have a travel guide like this one: https://wiki.bravecollective.com/public/corps/brave-newbies-inc/get-to-hq
---
Read it. Don't join your new corp too early, they are usually wardecced and HS becomes kind of hostile for you. Travel to the last station in High- or Lowsec, dock, accept the invitation there. Log off and on again to load your new standings for the overview. Then continue the voyage.
---
Before you go, look at your assets and decide, what you don't need any more. Sell this stuff if possible. Big alliances often give out free ships to newbies, but it certainly helps to have some liquid ISK.
---
Don't load a lot of value into your travel ship. The initial trip is dangerous. Once you are in, you can scout saver routes via wormholes and fetch what you need and left behind. 
---
Yeah and getting evicted is not that big of a deal.
---
If you live there you are always ready for that possibility.
---
i dont even know who Mar5hy is :P
---
- no botting whatsoever, ever
---
- no alpha multi-boxing or 3rd party program omega multi boxing, ever
---
- no isk or plex sold for any outside currency, ever
---
- roommate is my roommate
---
No, just the EULA.
---
well,  i would be mad too if everyone is happy botting  but me
---
b-but input broadcasting the chat is allowed
---
Beautiful work. o7 
---
wanna bet ccp isn't even following their rules (again) and is doing a permaban instead of a 30day?
---
Not all drones engage at the same time, and the drones always engage the enemy closest to you when they engage. In the 4 seconds between engaging, your you were closer to a second target.
---
And me
---
Wait for your petition to be answered. If you need to add any comments or information don't file a new petition, just comment on the one you have open.
---
False positives do happen, but they are very rare.
---
Pressed f1 and now hes dead
---
Well, s/he/you got banned for a reason. Reddit cannot help you. You have to reach out to CCP. I can definitely tell you, that you did something wrong. Worthy of a ban...Mar5hy. :-p
---
ccp is such dogshit
---
they specifically outline times they temp ban and not permaban, yet totally ignore those and just permaban people anyway
---
i've been banned thrice permanently and was unbanned each of those times because it was for no reason
---
Can you still run FW missions in a bomber solo? anyone know?
---
Also logging in all camper toon and cloak up at the same time minimized his chance of getting scanned down and killed while logging in
---
Who ia marshy?
---
Thanks for the clarification!
---
What did you excepted them to do ? Congratulate him for breaking the EULA and getting caught red handed ? That’s just asking for more player to simply buy the first cheap program there is out there, run it for retarded farming and then complain to CCP either here or on the forums that the ban wasn’t justified, since apparently some people can get away.
---
I know you only have three brain cells connected to each other, at least try to use them a bit. And the horde of bots of Mar5hy bringée nothing to the game, except having a simple neutral useless player in each system of Delve, and beyond.
---
Dave, I hope you're not being boring here and alluding to Ripard. Because that would disappoint me.
---
What "Proof" of said banning is there?  Just curious how the eve community knows this before the actual person that is supposedly banned.
---
For fucks sake, is it bots or input broadcasted accounts? Stop saying everything is fucking bots.
---
His point still stands. The only reason people use VNIs to rat, with the low rewards they yield, is that they are very low effort as well.
---
If you'd like to - or are forced to - put more effort into ratting, there are options besides the VNI that yield far better rewards. 
---
nope, they are not
---
Welcome to Eve 2k19 where 90% of fleets are frigate/destroyer sized
---
Olmeca's current strap-on
---
Hey OP, you came to the right place to get ccp to notice the ticket, should be sorted soon :)
---
Mar5hy has been banned before so based on \*their\* rules this should be a permaban.   
---
Noone knows if that's not the case and you need two bans of the same source (ib, botting etc) to get permabanned.  
---
But it seems logical that it isn't the case and two bans of any nature should get you banned permanently cause you are not playing by the rules in multiple occasions. Content creator or not you SHOULD follow the rules. If you don't like the rules you can always leave the game :)
---
If you look at the data you will see that PL don't have any supers or titans on the list ... when you look at the PH data you will find a NYX ... and this ship class beat PL top ship that is interceptor.         
---
Only 10 different people sharing the same broadcast at the exact same time over multiple systems.  
---
But even if ALL those screenshots are fake I am sure CCP had logs pulled to check if that was the case.
---
When you get banned for second time its most times perma ban, so follow what rules you say ?

I guess that is one way of ddosing the server.
---
He can do what he wants with it, and we can laugh at him for it.
---
Surely you would pay more? Isn't it a flat fee (higher than the percentile) per order that doesn't reach the minimum?
---
He's a guy who has dozens of accounts, he uses input broadcasting to play them at the same time, which is forbidden, but we don't really have proof. 3 weeks ago he wrote something in chat but forgot to turn input broadcast off. A dozen of his alts sent the exact same message at the same time which kinda gave him away.
---
PL is saving up their super fleet for a surprise butt sechs
---
If you afk yes but if you make the drone target one rat it's good
---
Sharing a broadcast does not equate to being banned.  So the question still resides, how does eve community know he is banned?

Unfortunately, due to unforseen circumstances of my PC getting fried. (mobo, PSU and CPU dead) this has been postponed till I can get my PC rebuilt, probably next week sometime. I will be sure to PM you on reddit and let you know when this happens. I do apologise. 
---
I think I see the problem.

No wonder your banned....

Thats like saying murder isn't bad because he was going to die anyway. 
---
Leave your alliance and PVP in a smaller group.
---
It's fun to achieve things on your own. 
---
A few weeks ago one of the fleet commanders for bomber's bar said something in local at the same exact second on dozens of accounts. This can only be achieved by input broadcasting, which is against the rules. Both mar5hy and several players supporting them argued it isn't ban worthy for various reasons such as they is fighting the bots and it was his enemies yelling to get rid of them.

And how many of these "old" names aren't formerly large. I think they need to expand ticker size for sure, but no. Keep your hands off old tickers and corps.

Hahaha very nice

Was he some boogeyman for null guys or what?

Why didn’t the frigates and drones that where close to the carrier get melted by the bombs?

And we are talking w/o implants, correct?
---
You mean I can scam all trade hubs at the same time?
---
Both are prohibited by the EULA, both get you a deserved permaban. It’s just the way to do it that changes. Here, made it simple enough for you.
---
That's not surprising considering the fact that Horde Vanguard. is the number one supercap corp in the game 
---
https://i.imgur.com/NiT7AvC.png

Why so bitter? 
---
Was banned* and neither of those reasons IMO, are reason enough to permanently remove a player from the game that already has a low enough playercount as is. And neither of those reasons would have been a ban unless some retard reported me and REEEE'd hard enough.
---
Calling actual player-controlled accounts "bots" literally just makes you seem retarded k thanks
---
Congrats, you've accomplished a lot in such a short time, really.
---
How about you join a small group, put up an astra or pos somewhere deep in the middle of people neutral to you, and start harassing them?
---
you tried so hard and got so far but in the end it doesn't even matter
---
For goons yeah, but he cheated so fair is fair. Grrr gons
---
Npcs in warp spoolup are very strange, cant even lock them usually.
---
Is input broadcasting reddit posts against the EULA?
---
Oh goody, something Minmatar is bad at. Everyone needs a weakness
---
Combat probe the ship and you will have more time to apply bumps before backup arrive. Idk might be impossible but you can dock straight up after a bump or two.
---
in the dread whelp.  PH baited and in the end had as many super caps on the field as NC,  PL had about half of either PH/NC.  Nc still had the most fax but PH were not a lot behind 
---
DELETE THIS
---
Ermmm... embarrassing, have you ever done rorqual mining? Because that is drone mechanics 101, especially when you warp the proper distance.  Oh boy. Grrr Goons
---
Hey, that is "emergent gameplay" right? RIGHT?!?!?
---
You are free to do your own research. Some conversations in BBs discord show that this is the case. It could very well not be.
---
Figure out what you like to do and keep doing it
---
Tapi totally lost that fight and got camped in system for several days and proceed to lose the war and got paid a undisclosed amount of money in PLEX
---
they are but humble krabs. they aint no nuthin bout no killmails
---
thats not how math works.
---
You’d think not but ... this reddit has me often worried about IQ levels at times haha 
---
The easiest way to get "unbored" is to reintroduce risk to your gameplay.
---
Solo or small gang blops hunting when not in goonswarm.
---
Try to fly ships solo that are "not in the meta".
---
FC a small gang and achieve a 2:1 victory.
---
Carry out a solo wormhole eviction.
---
Build a carrier and a dread using mats only mined from within the wormhole.  
---
According to your post I'm going to guess you have the isk to do these things, the question is what kind of high risk gameplay do you want to get into first.
---
Week 3 of a goon beeing a moron and crying about something he didnt need to care about personally... stop beeing a lemming and dont jump on the goon wave of pointing people you dont know.
---
Hey! If you are so bored roam througth delve and report bots! ;-)
---
you out of all people should know that i didn't try hard 
---
&gt;Edit. I should also mention that mar5hy has been in conflict with legacy and imperium for a while now. The two groups has joked and laughed that despite bomber's bar claims to be neutral, mar5hy will roll wormholes until it goes to space belonging to them and will exclusively targeted them with bombs during fleet fights. Mar5hy however claimed they were paid to cloaky camp, so they will roll to where their alts are.
---
tldr, people claim to be neutral got called out for not being neural proceed to prove they are indeed not neutral
---
Well obviously reporting players breaking the rules works, lol, so you could report all them goons but let me guess... there's conspiracy at the highest level? ccp are complicit in goon supremacy? ccp are goon pets?
---
put up or shut up, your paranoid hypocrisy is boring
---
Nice to meet you Ms Shut Up, i'm StainGuy!
---
Fuck I miss the memetanni now

Feels like a ruse

Well of course, when talking to people like you I have to lower my level of you won’t understand. In fact, I almost took out my kindergarten book with the pictures so you wouldn’t have to read only text, I should have, apparently.
---
Anyway, that beautiful counter on your first comment that like to be in the negatives (like your IQ) show us that the community doesn’t agree with you. See ya idiot.

YEah they use asic miners these days

great, another dumb wh jerk off post, just what we all needed

Most of the time browsing this sub feels like wading through a swamp full of shit. Then just as you start to get bored of it you stub your toe on something hidden in the filth and fall face first into the shit only to realize that what you stumbled on was a brick of solid gold.

---
I've see and heard of some of his Don Trolleone characters being spotter online as recently as tonight so not sure what's going on there.
---
I've also heard a rumor that CCP did ban him but also gave him explicit permission to create new accounts on the condition that he'd no longer be allowed to do that whole mass cloaky camping business.
---
On the whole, though, I'm not convinced that Mar5hy's group isn't just trolling everyone while he's away lmao.
---
Once I was competing with a region buy order against another guy with a region buy order and we were both dedicated to the 0.01 game. This was an item useless in small amounts but valuable in large. 
---
So I sold him 1 of the item at every npc station in the region. Repeatedly over a few weeks. He quit 0.01 isking against me.
---
don't speak retard sorry
---
I love when people like you, who were ban twice, not play eve anymore, a little toxic count (just looking at the reason you were ban tell a lot about you in real life, no judging, just looking) are the same very people who stand against another guy breaking the EULA service. And you really think your voice have any weight ? You really think CCP want people like you in EVE ? Look how overwatch is dying because of toxic player ruining the game, CCP doesn't want that, and people like you well deserve their ban, sadly we can still hear your pathetic voice on reddit...
---
Leave hisec?
---
I think if the stack is split into 1s then it would be multiple orders. If he made a bunch of 1 run industry jobs, then that would explain the split stacks. 
---
Not sure how you managed all that since 2014, i have played alot and since 2003, still i find my self some to do. Grab a munin, throw on it cannons and scram, take a wh and try fly home, always gets you some fun, hell even take some 2-3 buddys with you.
---
Do you realize what  you are saying ? It's like being in jail and saying "I would never end up here if no one would have report here to the cops, grrr this system".
---
You acted like a toxic count and get punish for it, deal with it, don't complain about how well CCP is reacting to people like

TIL. How to fly fish with ice excavs .. actually didn’t know this technique.. oh something something bot conspiracy .. what other tricks do ppl know .. can a different thread be spun up on the do’s and donts of optimal rorq mining? Maybe suspend the autism meta screeching to have a different level of thread on reddit as I’d be keen to hear more on this topic 🤓
---
&gt; X - for doubting that you have two functional brain cells to rub together.
---
Eat a dick, you dumb bitch =)
---
Why isn’t this posted/adverted on evetech?
---
I’m looking for a FAQ, have you a GITHUB or something?
---
What else can this bot do?
---
Can it take into account ME/TE/Structure Bonuses, not to mention costs like SCI and Tax?
---
Can you set build quantity?
---
Which calculation are you using for the ore required?
---
So as long as the player count is low enough you can do whatever you want? 
---
Wait, I thought Horde wasnt allowed to use capitals....
---
&gt; hey if he's dumb enough
---
Me too I wish Input broadcasting was legal only if MY SIDE use it, otherwise ban them grrr 
---
Omeca posting please ignore
---
Very nice.
---
Get off the themepark ride and out of your little HS safe space and start playing the actual game. 
---
I'm sure that GSM is already on it.
---
Are you the last goon ?
---
What happened??
---
There is no conspiracy its way easier CCP tends to listen to the loudest voices.
---
This means when GSF starts an effort to get somebody banned they would put on a unified push against this person to end up the loudest voice if you do the same against GSF member they policy is to try and bury it, now this isn't 100% effective granted, but the idea CCP is judging by the same standard if GSF starts to complain vs some random person is silly.
---
Ironic.

This guy here gets it

Oh man... i'm 100% shure that this will just fuel his rage and this time he will plant not just 1 but 2 cloaky campers in every system in delve. 
---
Might be a bot might, be notifications from market programs like evernus, mogul(i think they both have the option to notify you when an order is no longer top order) or even some designer r market program that querys the api every x seconds. 
---
Please stop posting, this is worse than TAPI drool posting.
---
Let pull it this way, I don't use input broadcasting, I'm not ban, A guy in pl don't use input broadcasting he is not ban too, Marchy use input broadcasting he is ban. Do you understand how it work ?
---
make it your mission to take down snuffed. or piss them off in a small area :D
---
haha jokes aside, it doesnt sound like youve given Faction warfare much of a go? solo frig 1v1's? dual rep vexors taking on assault frig gangs?
---
maybe try not being on the side(grr goons) that has the most power, join a smaller group with your main or whatever?
---
it's even funnier how that im the first guy who got banned for saying "marshy got banned." apparently shitposting is goon propaganda too.  also there's the screenshot \^ 
---
ofcourse he is, dude thought he was some big badass who people were supposed to be afraid of. He decided to input broadcast, got called out and that pretty much damages his ego and his image. 
---
He can't handle criticism or getting caught out cheating. 
---
yeh, eve's not for quitters like that.
---
he wants to play, just doesnt know what.
---
If you don't know how to contact a diplomat, then you are not looking for a diplomat.   
---
What you want is something else or a generally stupid idea. You can write me an ingame mail (same name) about your idea or what you need and I might be able to tell you what the next senseful step is.  
---
You can also do it via pm or smth - just offering ;)  
---
What do you expect, the competent dudes left, old corps died, hedliner filled the ranks with MC rejects. They'll be a husk ready to close the doors by the end of 2019.
---
well, here is a thing. both my hecate\\swipul fits tank 450 heated without implants(with improved booster) , BUT 
---
i would not recommend it until you are very aware of what you are doing .and my very first hecate was shot by thrasher..
---
with mid grades both could pull out at least 550+ which means they could take on almost any cruiser (in theory)
---
i have no swipul loses , and i really do not want to login , so i won't show exact fit, but genera idea is
---
\&gt;200 canons
---
\&gt;10mn AB,warp scrambler,pith(something) shield booster,cap booster
---
\&gt; gyrostab(maybe two) , something else i don't remember. maybe damage control
---
this fit is not for a new guy. it's hard to manage oversized prop, - how many peeps escaped my scram just because of my shitty piloting? a lot. in the same time it's great for mitigating damage if you are know exactly what are you doing . it requires very well understanding of prop mode/def mode functioning, and any mismanagement leads to a hull damage, next mistake- you are dead. 
---
of course i'm talking about more or less challenging fights , because there is no fun in beating shit out of vexor with t1 guards.
---
i remember i've killed at least 2 pvp fitted VNI (1vs1, not 1vs2) , one elite proteus with griffin alt (lol) ,  and maybe bunch of smaller shit i don't remember anymore like rail hecate and few dessies etc.
---
last time i engaged pve gila, and made it to 1\\2 shield than bailed because rapid light and med drones are no joke dude 
---
Think he rorq mines
---
I was just about to put together a solo t2 fit myself: would you be so kind as to post one of the known cookie cutters for us abyssal outsiders? 
---
Don't shout out the masterplan!
---
So many people do not understand multi-layered satire, FYI this was a joke ripped of from a very popular political cabarett ... but I lost my faith years ago already ... maybe I am also way to old for this sub ...
---
If CCP fucking pays me to do it. I'll activatly screen. Until they pay my bills to do their fucking job, I'll kick when I notice it. Fucking retard. I'm not spending more of my time doing admin bullshit in a fucking GAME. Biomass yourself.
---
You are such a cry baby.... stfu stop posting lmao
---
It's more you always need a second person from corp A online or have everyone have an in corp alt ready to lead the fleet it. 
---
Why is that wrong?
---
VPN caused me a ban and was lifted after further investigation 
---
My favorite moment of eve was when Aura told me she was done holding my hand and was going  into sleep mode.
---
Would be the worst bot ever. Dunno about ice, but on usual ore you would just waste so much time (and ISK) just to make sure they are "safe"? Doesn't make sense at all. 
---
Do it with a char that has positive standing with them. No defence fleet will spawn.
---
&gt; when you have 20+ cynos light within 1 server tick
---
  That guy was banned tho
---
He got caught input broadcasting. And to be honest its kinda a mess whats going on from an outsider looking in.
---
Never been in a bombers bar fleet but I was in goons for about two weeks. There are tons of input broadcasters and bots in delve and surrounding areas. It looks really bad when you are in an alliance that is openly bitching about input broadcasts, while simultaneously being in an alliance that directly benefits from it, it denigrates your argument and honestly makes you look like a huge bitch.
---
As a result many people are speculating, rightfully so, that the only reason he was banned was because of goons/legacy level of bitching. It also sets a really bad precedent by ccp because they didn't do anything at all initially and then moved on it when 'the community' (heavily favored in the null-bear-i-wanna-get-rich playstyle) said something about it. Conversely, the dude did cheat so its w/e, whole thing seems slimy to me and its an issue ccp can EASILY fix but for whatever reason choose not to.
---
\&gt;  You acted like a toxic count and get punish for it 
---
the eve community in tyool 2019. jesus this game is so fucking over lol. 
---
&gt; It took months for him to get banned
---
  lol no it didn't, it was all over reddit the moment it happened
---
Just what that game needs. Focus on pve. lmao
---
He input broadcasted a message over all of his campers. While that might not of broken the rules, it proved that he had the settings turned on for broadcasting and then this was reported. Maybe CCP found out that he had used it for other things.
---
I'm not sure you fully understand the mechanics of faction warfare complexes.
---
This.
---
2 things:  
---
1. It is a bit strange, as the OP shows, to start a show and have 3 episodes and then suddenly stop. I hardly believe every CCP employee able to make some quick updates is on holidays. If that is the case:  
---
2. Tell your community (at the last episode) "Hey, we will be on a break now. Expect the next video around XY" or smth. You often do something and then stop, for no one really getting the why.  
---
Thx in advance :)  
---
6 Monitors?! Doubt GOTG can form enough to need that
---
&gt; its an issue ccp can EASILY fix but for whatever reason choose not to.
---
They stand to lose money if they bring the full weight of the EULA down on every botter in the game.
---
and which of those did he do ... oh wait 
---
nope.
---
Yes, I too see that, I try to recruit anyone I can to try and play this game :( (I even offered my friend a 1 year subbed 50m sp toon to play and he still wouldnt! &gt;.&lt; )
---
lear to read retard
---
imagine being so anti goon. that you start supporting input broadcasting. 
---
you need to take a hard look at your life mate. 
---
Sweet dunking
---
Multiplicative bonuses vs additive
---
Thanks for the response
---
Yeah Mar5hy is a salty boi ^_^
---
&gt; They banned mar5hy for a harmless local chat incident in a couple of weeks
---
Yes because he didn't broadcasted for anything else right ?
---
Station trading is a difficult way to make money without some expensive skills to increase your margins, lots of game knowledge to identify good items to trade, advanced industrial ships to efficiently move items beteen regions, and lots of capital, a few hundred million at least. That being said there are some great money making activities to do as a begginer to give you some time to train those necessary skills. Beginner corporations will provide those skill books at a reduced rate or free, and will help you with ideas to begin making that isk. If you are interested in trading they can also provide resources to help identify what items are needed for doctorine ships that you can buy at a highsec trade hub and import into your region atuch higher margins than just buying and selling in a hub. Good luck! 7o
---
who are they alligned to then? There are Goon Fcs there are NC. Fcs there are random small group FCs. some of the FCs might not be neutral, just because they won't hunt their blues, Goonswarm FCs for example won't hunt delve when using their main.
---
that doesn't mean that BB is goons, they are still neutral
---
Hey you /u/HypeSwarmFederation get out of here with your logic and facts, /r/eve is no place for such things, don't you know that all goons are botters and constantly input broadcasting. Everyone else in the game is cheating so i should be able to to! 
---
/s
---
what is a spacemonkey alliance? 
---
So what your saying is you have sentries out while mining? 
---
Like you still have to swap you drones out, this is likely where the accusation of input broadcasting comes in not about the drones aggressing.
---
Well ccp has already perma banned people before for things that have NOT even taken place on their servers, so maybe.
---
I am also going to take exception to the Heron being the only one that is viable, I think you can absolutely do Magnate, Probe, Maulus, Crucifier. 
---
The new meta is instawarp jackdaws
---
&gt;he wants to play, just doesnt know what.
---
how about another game
---
Sick fight
---
What did he get banned for?
---
Sorry for so many typos and grammatical mistakes. It was like 5 am and i was barely awake yet filled with rage. 
---
Maybe you can make a cyno light next to the ship too so the cyno is now lit?
---
What's the status of storyline items? I have a ton of them as well as a bunch of BPCs. The build cost is fairly cheap compared to the sell price, but I'm wondering if they are expensive only because they are rare and not really a useful item. I don't see many on the market.  I think I got them in cosmos a while ago. Is that still a thing? 
---
Oh man am i being recruited here? Lol
---
I think I covered most of the "high risk/skill" parts of eve, outside of saying "become the next power alliance", which isn't that much of an attainable goal, whereas everything else (outside of killing an at ship) is.  Now, if that one corp that is saved winds up turning into a powerhouse, who knows what could happen.
---
So if he has had a ban, for any length of time, does that mean that all the goons that lost anything to him should start making reimbursement petitions? Because he had to cheat to get those kills.
---
It's a kind of bait used to trap that most cunnning of animals, the common dinoposter
---
Botting is bad except when I do it because grrrrrrr goons
---
Also when you're doing beginner missions often it's better to just buy the item off the market and turn the mission in. 
---
&gt; Fweddit
---
i didn't understand all of it but: yes
---
No shocker there, Cruisers Crew is pretty dead. Anyone competent looking to join a PvP group would look elsewhere first - actually quite a few active small gang PvP groups lately, which is nice. 
---
My boys will do it. 
---
The playercount is low BECAUSE of crybaby bitches that report shit like that flooding the game lmfao
---
So I’ll be honest... TIL about evetech. I’ve not seen it before.
---
Yes, the calculations account for structure bonuses. It’s normally set at a T1-rigged Tatara in null with V refining and refining efficiency, IV ore skill, but with no implant.
---
Other things the bot currently does include a plex-to-injector ratio calculation, telling you if it’s a good time to buy. It also can tell you the value of ores (raw and refined) based or recent jita averages. It can produce a refining spreadsheet on demand, and it can do price checks for whatever you want.
---
The code is not currently open source.
---
Lowsec gate to Anoikis when? 
---
I've had to largely scale back my participation with this game due to work and IRL stuff, but I think you're hitting on a really big problem this game has; PR. Any time I ever mention that I play EVE, I get one of two reactions: 1) What's EVE? I've never heard of it before! 2) Oh, EVE, yuck. I've heard terrible things about it. It's always a variation on those two responses. 
---
CCP has done a fantastically terrible job on advertising this game. We can talk about mechanics and changes till we're blue in the face, but it won't make a damn bit of difference if CCP doesn't put some effort into advertising. I realize it would be expensive, but how difficult would it be for a sci fi game company to put an ad showing a "This is EVE" style trailer just before the next star wars movie or something. I guarantee you it would explode EVE's exposure to a wider audience and bring desperately new blood to the game.
---
It's not wrong to do it.
---
It's just wrong to do it and pretend you're a neutral entity when you're clearly not acting in a neutral fashion.
---
Ok who are cruisers crew and why should I care
---
Unlike in overwatch, there is a block button which will not deprive you of anything to click! :)
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Eve) if you have any questions or concerns.*

Swap drones, then assist to a drone bunny. The speed needed to do that across multiple rorqs at the same time...... yeah that does sound like input broadcasting to me
---
Ofcourse BB is NPSI.  
---
Not People-i-like Shoot It
---
hrm, wonder if CCP could just have randomly named NPCs flying about nullsec, but they show up in local. could even make them a fun little target you can hunt across systems. 
---
Bug report was first thing I did, but thanks for the reminder!
---
That old CEO could get the Corp back via a petition because they used to be an old CEO/director. It has been done for corps a lot younger than 12 years idle.
---
I suggest a name change to retardalert447. More fitting.

Yeah i agree with you in that competent players would know to look elsewhere. Many c2&gt;c5/ns corps who are very active and willing to even teach people to git gud. 
---
But my experience from being in quite a few dead/dying corps is they recruit aggressively and proceed to burnout any new players with their ridiculousness. 
---
Oh hi. It's retardalert447 again. I am amazed by your insanely well put arguments but I will have to respond equally well.  
---
yep.
---
why does cowkiller have a butt hole for an avatar?
---
Wait, do I understand correctly? The intent was to force him to fly across the entire region to collect these items?
---
not arguing with that, but your initial assumption seemed to be that its never okay to input broadcast, which isnt really true
---
I agree wholeheartedly, but how did your comment further anything?
---
You should also eat 50 dicks you pompous fuck.
---
wew elo what a shit post. why don't you focus on your own issues like your dieing alliance over ours. thanks.
---
Lemme know if you want seconds.
---
Well don't keep us in suspense, did you get purged? 
---
? Why would i have to argue? Your statement is wrong, and you put no proof at all for it, it doesn't deserve anything more than a nope
---
I imagine you feel like 10 seconds after having a monstrous shit.
---
Not a minute later, AND it was glorious! 
---
im not sure why the 100mn comes into play when we can apply 4 rapier webs 1 loki web and 2 thorax webs (turns out thorax pilot had 2 webs confirmed after this post/discussion
---
thats 5 long range webs and 2 short.
---
with a fleet applying more dps than pyfa states it can tank. although paper dps the webs. and the majority of the dps therm.kin i would say that loki dies either way. did i mention we were successfully bumping him away from the gate, and if the police did shoot him extra dps would of jumped the gate to help finish him off.
---
im finding it hard to see a way he gets out alive, with no one being able to help him on that side either.
---
&gt; This is bullshit!
---
Sums up Eve online perfectly TBH.
---
dead alliance please ignore us.
---
We're neutral until we come up against the combined northern blob, then we form voltron, we've never denied this.
---
true dat
---
you sound bitter, i suggest taking a look at yourself
---
Yeah the one thing droid did best was the fitting tool. Very very intuitive and convenient
---
Amazing thank you! :D the eve droid fitting tool is a really good example of convenience if you are looking to making any further changes to yours in the future. But yeah a fit multiple option when more than one slot is selected would be amazing
---
not my assumption at all, but "forgetting to turn it off" seems a bit off, that and if this ban is legit then that means CCP found actual reason to ban him, its not like they would ban someone if there wasn't any actual evidence, all the reddit hurf blurf means nothing. 
---
I am really sorry for what is going on in your head. I truly am.
---
but they did take a few bosons to the face
---
This is now 1 comments too many talking to someone that has the issues you apparently have. Have a good day. I hope everything that's troubling you goes away soon friend.
---
we 100% just like the mess around have fun, nothing serious. we like to troll, and enjoy laughing at salt.
---
when i saw this randoms bio and saw he had some 'im perfect' bio, that was what tipped the edge to try to grab some more tears from an already funny thing to watch.
---
now we have a good idea who he is, and i love how i think maybe this post has made them come to the system alot. its great when content comes to you. 
---
i respect him as a pilot. it would be aparent from being advised to me, hes a good logi / ceptor pilot.
---
and he did very well in a recent fight our kitchen sink had against thier kite gang. and him in his ceptor did do himself justice. which makes it even better that he died like an idiot on the day in question :)
---
Name checks out
---
The problem with this is when would they do that, realistically. Right now chat is so messed up can you imagine if they did advertise and brought in big crowds? I don't think it would end well because the game isn't in prime time form at the moment. In game chat is litterally the most basic game feature ever and they can't keep it running. If people joined right now and got hit with that they aren't sticking around for the 6 months they will take to roll it back. 
---
Never 4get [\[CSKFC\]](https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98248224/), EVE Online's #1 ever pvp guild. I wonder how many corps there are like that with actually good names/tickers.
---
Jesus dinos get worse every day. seek help.
---
Undock 4 or 5 alpha nados. Alpha it, doc before defence fleet lands. Problem solved
---
Well it depends on the fc. Marshy likes to roll delve, some other fcs don't want to role delve. 
---
I have rule of not overheating when multiboxing. Especially if it's logi. So many fucked up situations with burned out modules. And in half of them I have accidentally overheated a module.
---
No it isn't.
---
At the moment it is. But there has been two international entry level corps in the alliance in the history but they got disbanded when their leadership got too busy with rl stuff.
---
I too support enforcing rules, especially those particular few I'm not breaking. 
---
As said before, only Marshy does that. Other fcs like to hunt other places. 
---
They always give GF's

---
those bots are buying plex on the market, them being banned will not stop the other players from buying and posting plex for sale, CCP gets paid whether then ban bots or not this is a dumb argument.
---
All these years searching for the answers. The bitter taste of uncertanty. Lost between ideas and drifted to the edge of sanity. All this just to find the answer here... God! This life... this life is a bot.
---
Ever used a vpn?

Sensitive about spelling.

Some people like to game for fun some for hate.

Should probably get the tit pilot an orca so he can store his massive balls in the SMB of his tit
---
char name "Marik Kahoudi"
---
doesn't look like you ever attempted to join a single one of their fleets in the first place?
---
the only "reason" that CCP needed was the pressure from shitloads of mindless drones on reddit/ingame. this isn't the first time CCP "bent the knee" to Goon pressure, it won't be the last...
---
That's what doing wrong brother, also brek it to 2 7 people fleets
---
Well... welcome to EvE Online, i guess ;) Best of luck for that ticket, but CCP announced not to refound any abyssal killmails...
---
"I should be able to cheat if it's used to kill the gon"

You are missing a brain, or reading competency ... or both
---
Fair enough, I just go by what I see on the streams
---
Interesting. How do you process / track payment?
---
Nice bait post. The grammer was a nice touch and really adds some authenticity. But I'm just nibbling not hooked today. 
---
Not that I am aware of unless it's a freemium one, which I highly doubt. Will ask tomorrow
---
I enjoyed reading this, thank you for sharing it
---
The only noticeable lore they added is the world news. Sadly these are only used to promote new ships being added or totally wasted (like the Kyonoke thing that was only used for one fanfest and had no real influence on the game).

As @GelatinousSalsa stated, it's not linear.

*there is no conspiracy*
---
*presents conspiracy*
---
well that is ridiculous tin foil hattery. 
---
CCP is a professional company, they would not ban someone if there wasn't reason to do so. 
---
are you kidding? like seriously how delusional do you have to be to think CCP would ban a players accounts just because of hearsay? People go on and on about goons being spodbrained but i think the real spodbrains have been here, under our noses the whole time. 
---
You can be neutral and prefer to hunt certain areas, for example....
---
Many NPSI streamer fleets go to horde space.... They aren't goon affiliated
---
Many wormhole groups roll delve/esoteria.... Doesn't make them goon affiliated
---
Actually hunting outside a non Delve, Impass or Esoteria hole isn't really worthwhile for 100 bomber group, better to roll of nothing to tackle right outside the NSS or they know there's something worth investigating (ie dumbass botting supers). Hell my wormhole group does the exact same because it's just a better use of time than gating around empty systems.
---
The bot sends you instructions when you run out of messages. You send ISK to a corp and put the discord name in the description. The bot can query that and authorize further usage.
---
It's funny to read that from you, because I think you(or any other FC who it's fun to fly with) leading fleets is quality content and worth so much more for eve than just random rorq mining while watching netflix.
---
My sentiments exactly, they ban one guy withing 3 weeks for broadcasting in chat and with the only real "gain" from all of that broadcasting being the ability to cloak on all chars vs hundreds of goon rorquals mining 23/7 and changing the game economy and as a result the political map of eve as we know it just because they can and just because the rest of eve does not have a loud enough voice...
---
Why delete this?
---
Yeah, it's pretty retarded considering that's the entire point of region wide buy orders.
---
Gsm? 
---
im gay
---
yeah, pretty cool, props to these guys, they overwhelmed us the last couple times we went there with to small fleets, committing in the pocket behind the bubbles is scary. - We killed all of those after the fight :D
---
Ah I'm busted??? No sir but thanks for spending the time to try and bring me out.
---
yea but they do, as i can tell from having my ship handed back to me by CCP
---
Magnate is, as you show, doable. The Maulus and crucifier obviously work but they're not exploration frigates.
---
I don't think the probe has enough going for it and the imicus has the same issue to in my opinion
---
Not saying they never win a fight but the odds are heavily stacked against them
---
Yeah, that's the way Don was. 
---
Evictus hate Evictus right now, we cant even hold on to valuable members. We just have to praise the incompetent ones we going to be left with and say good job guys you rock... 
---
Meanwhile alliance wallet goes what's all this SRP and all the indy (90% of alliance) rub their hands together, meanwhile "the 10%" import everything cos our indy cant even seed correctly.
---
Did he just invite people to account share his cloaky campers?!
---
A follow up would be he says he'll do it for free now, like he was charging people to share his accounts in the past.
---
Very interesting. 
---
By all means, keep your code, keep it proprietary, least until you decide to abandon the project as some devs tend to as fine passes.
---
My IT department is quite curio, and I’d like to give my gentlemen’s a new toy to mess with. Hopefully we can provide useful feedback.
---
Bumping big, fat but slow ships.
---
Can second this with third party info. People I know had their ships reimbursed that got lost due to server issues or bugs.
---
There is a no-refund policy for client-side issues.
---
welcome to lowsec. join caldari. we flippin systems like crazy.

Thanks  I got my math wrong.

ohh the salt here!
---
Wormholes are awesome!!!
---
Hell no
---
German efficiency at it's finest.
---
Wormholes :)
---
I suggest you check the mer his campers had no impact on delve. One person cloaky camping am entire region isn't scary. Ngsa with 200 people each multi camping makes an impact, this guy wasn't even close 5o being a threat. 
---
we lost so hard in ualx that panfam thought they'd won the war and fucked off home
---
Supers have a jump drive so they wont be moved
---
they won't move anything with a jump drive
---
Basicly since creation Phorde was always bigger, the whole idea was PL as an elite group and since you need a meatshield now with the current sov iteration they formed phorde and recruited all the brave guys they used to farm.
---
At this point the players just grew up and injected into their own capitals, also phorde has way more FCs, so way more content, no reason to switch to PL.

Station trading.

The amount of research and potentially profitability is endless
---
it actually stands for NC/PL Special Interests
---
Just bot isk since you have limited time, realize thegame is a waste, and quit 
---
I'm confident if someone was able to provide the same level of proof to CCP about any other botters or broadcasters shooting themselves in the foot then ccp would action it just as well.  
---
I'm not sure if its just a meme or not but if you basically hand ccp a timetable of when you break the rules then of course you are going to get dealt with quickly.
---
thanks, but i like to play, not to get virtually rich sitting on a chair :)
---
For Bombers Bar NPSI obviously means Not Panfam Shoot It.
---
They lost any right to call themselves a neutral entity long ago.
---
If you think Panfam isn't krabbing in rorqs every day you are delusional.
---
Why would you bot quake m?
---
i know, but im not even sure i can move it with the new fighter changes aka overloaded fighterbay 
---
This is eve. The autists will always win.  You need to recalibrate your expectations.
---
ffs stop whining like a little baby, people all over the place get banned, just report them. And if you dont like what ccp is doing just quit the game and get on with your life
---
wat? same reason you'd do it with anything, to make isk
---
I agree with you in form, but at some point they are going to need to change up their recipe when it comes to advertising if they want to keep their doors open. The game is never going to be this mirror shine polished thing that so many people want it to be. The trick is to make it good enough to get the hook in their mouths and start reeling them in. There was another thread about doing more to expand on things like Lore driven NPC wars in high sec and what not. Where you could join up with large NPC fleets and blow shit up. I promise you that would get somebody like me to come back and play regularly. The game is just so stale right now. It's just in a weird rats nest of problems that are so interconnected, I don't know how you would isolate one thing and call it a day.

Just unanchor the structure. Problem solved.

Can't find the exact date he was banned, but iirc it wasn't until 2018. 
---
Thank you :)
---
Yeah, 'tis a truly salty excretion extruded
---
Jesus Christ, are you people STILL carrying water about this?
---
No you can’t move without dumping the fighters 
---
Talk to people. It may sound like a broken record but it's still very true when it comes to eve. And doing stuff as a group is more enjoyable. 
---
I hate gas huffing for money. But on a quiet night as I'm winding down before logging off, I'll gladly huff and chat   a bit. 
---
they also lose money if legit players leave because it becomes impossible to compete unless you bot
---
This.  
---
From my experience. chatting with people yields most entertaining results in local of nullsec staging systems. 
---
Apart from the constant attempts to recruit you, the conversations can be great fun.
---
I am missing the words to express my feelings for your actions...
---
wow the votebrigades are strong in this one ... and the salt about stolen excavators that could not be pulled in time ...
---
the "professional" company as you call it has been known to side with alliances in the past, some GMs even supported said alliances and gave them an unfair advantage until that was found out ofc. 
---
I did not say Marshy was innocent, the response time was surprisingly low for CCP however, where you can watch a bot mine for months on end 23/7 with constant reporting but one guy steps on a massive alliance's tail and poof 3 weeks - gone.
---
CCP has literally let Goons get away with irl crime, where they vandalized the eve monument (no, not the sticker), fabricated evidence of some other guys involvement, and all they got away with was an ingame ban...
---
Or perhaps you forgot about all the times Goons led literal harassment compaigns against other and got away with them... Or that time when Mittani threatened CCP with negative press during the Valkirie launch preparations over an ingame background? He both got his background and got away with it...
---
I more or less stopped doing the markets because of this. I know the pain.
---
And he would have gotten away with it too, if it weren't of those meddling goons!
---
this is a new low in your unending obsession, get clean mate 
---
So isk bounties would cause SP loss on death?
---
Holy fuck that would be the greatest bad-for-the-game change ever
---
You are. In answer to your last question.
---
Orca Pilot here. 
---
Insurance Fraud Gatecamp in Venal went as expected :D
---
Thx for uploading this! 
---
I love it 
---
Actual players do not count in the bankroll of CCP, just subbed Accounts, and bot farms and input broadcasted mining multiboxes made a huge pile of CCP income from subs since Rorqual patch. Simple as that ...
---
CCP just banned the input broadcaster that will impact their profits less ...
---
Yes but I’m missing the old structures from the game
---
nice fights dude! How does the Zarmzant compare to say a logi legion, in your opinion?
---
update: seems like you have to jump in/out system to "fix" it somehow
---
Flew with him in NEATO. He was a great guy, always ready to have a great time.
---
Farewell, traveler. Amongst the stars you will rest. 
---
they fucked the access rights, they're not showing cause the ov thinks u don't have docking rights to them. if u warp to a citidel from ur asset window for example it all works fine but it'll show up as u not having docking access even tho it's in ur own corp
---
Is 7 day cycles even worth doing? 
---
Try spectre fleet, 0 time commitment, just show up for whatever fleet is going on.  The people who join the fleets are fun and usually know what they're doing.
---
Yes but don’t expect to be rich on it.  
---
If your going away on a vacation I use 7d cycles.  
---
Because it’s better to get some then none. 
---
Yes, but one at a time. Either the guy went out and collected like 50 after hitting all stations, or had to wait a couple weeks before he got enough to where it's actually worth it to fly out and get it
---
I know who you are talking about here with the 10 rorqs, he is obvious as fuck. Use to be in the same system with him for abit. Noone, not even in goons can claim he isn't broadcasting. 
---
Have you reported him to CCP showing those killmails? There is literally no defense to those, surely worth them investigating.
---
&gt;lots of data
---
&gt;works off reports
---
hmmm
---
They tank nicely and rep much further, if you have other ships providing links they have their niche, just a bit annoying if you want to rep your tacklers aswell or enemys split damage.
---
Kadesh holding against the Caracals was quite impressive, but he was burning fast, alot of missiles probably never reached him.
---
it isn't tho, not even close.
---
Would you dock in a 100 stations to collect a single piece of morphite from each?
---
Hey mate. Thanks for the exaustive list. I already have some checks in it, but I'll surely try to add some additional ones in the close future.
---
Hopefully it will make me play full-time again. 
---
So happy that you decided to make the plunge into Wormholes, It was one of the best decision I have made as well! Too manny people still to this day think Wormhole space is too scary, it really is sad. Hearing your story, even sharing it may make others rethink! &lt;3 
---
This is golden. thank you for making me smile and spreading the good word!
---
Wait, killmarks are real decals on your ship?! 
---
the only problem even if half of the imperium starts spamming their local chats/alliance chats there will be 0 reports to CCP because "wE DoNt RePorT oUr owN"...
---
bring solo back
---
No, you wait until you've collected enough stuff in the region and do some lazy sunday autopiloting. 
---
Usually if you're running region buys you're doing it with multiple toons in a corp, thx ccp order limits). It's very rare to only have one item in a station when you do the collection rounds.
---
People did with videos, CCP did nothing. Maybe not enough reddit threads were created and upvoted by 40k Lemmings ... or they would have lost more subbed accounts banning input broadcasts on Rorquals ... just an idea mkay ...
---
that's only for content leeches. everyone else know how to entertain themselves in this sandbox
---
Or he got automatically slapped on a list when it was detected and someone finally got round to looking into it. Presuming as default there's a conspiracy is kinda weird.
---
Please tell me what to do in game to make it my digital crack. I find it very booring but i want to try to get into.
---
Oh, RMT Baki of Viking Empire, what a shithead ....
---
Do you have pictures of PANFAM leadership all over your wall? 
---
Can confirm, Relogging brings the problem back though
---
might be worth trying then, its not like you loose anything by sending a petition 
---
The carrier thing sounds like a good idea.
---
because we have way to much content in eve and need to change that by punishing everyone that undocks and fights.
---
im sorry to tell you, but YES you definetly are retarded
---
What is the bug?
---
mar5hy is literally a member of NC.
---
I've been following this via Nolen. Bittersweet, because that model is great and this community is awesome.

"Well slap my ass and call me shirley, you've been locked!"

so I guess some of the dreks were also RR? Or how did that zarm survive? 
---
i see punisher i upventure
---
It isnt wrong, but dont say you are a neutral npsi group that hunts everyone all the time when facts say otherwise. Own who you are. 
---
Just to experiment and see what is possible. Our fits cost 1mil each and we could almost finish the instance.
---
Pretty good risk/reward value when we got the 300mil skillbook right away.
---
Yeah but the API is caching market price responses for 5 minutes, so when you are consistently outbided in less than a minute by the same guy, it can be a pretty good indication that it's a bot. 
---
But if it's just a one-time thing, you're absolutelly right in that he is surely simply using an external program to be notified on underbids.
---
Theoretically, but it comes down to drone weapon cycle time.
---
For example, if your Praetor's weapons cycle every 2 seconds (just an example), then it would be inclined to wait up to two seconds to fire for the rest of your drones to fire too. If it will take the rest of your drones more than 2s to get into volley range, then the first one fill fire anyway, and match the next cycle.
---
I like how I've been downvoted because people haven't bothered to investigate a game mechanic that's been around for over 10 years lol.
---
I would suggest testing it. We know for a fact (even per OPs posted example) that Focus Fire does not ensure they attack the same target.
---
Well CCP has posted those for example here: https://www.eveonline.com/now/surviving-the-abyss-together
---
Yeah, I'll be there, pal. lets 1v1 just you, me, and an obnoxiois number of questionably effective drones. 
---
That is a great work.
---
&gt;Making isk by botting a low volume low margin item
---
Ok.
---
Now ban turbo miners rorqs in delve. Wait goon won't pitchfork that cos dear leader would get mad. Hilarious 
---
&gt;Can't deal with your problems in game? Deal with them by yelling the loudest. Congrats for another metagame win for Goons.
---
Or you could sent a mail to team security, just like a GM will likely tell you if you open a ticket about it.  [security@ccpgames.com](mailto:security@ccpgames.com)  is the mail btw. Use it in the future and thank me later.   
---
&gt; If he was mass cloaking upon logging in by broadcasting 
---
the question is not "IF", it definately happened else he wouldn't be banned now. Yes, it's a matter of principle and actually unfair to comparable programs. For NGSA, we have hundreds of actual people around and if one guy wants to match that and uses unfair tricks to do it, then something is wrong. Go through the effort and you can have it &lt;-- that's a fundamental part of Eve and Broadcasting to achieve this result because you can't be arsed to do it manually is equivalent to botting.   
---
&gt; Meanwhile, tens of Delve Rorquals save hundreds of Excavators each month via broadcasting the scoop command. 
---
Which is just a claim without any kind of proof from your side. Show me proof and I will happily help you reporting these people, cause I don't care about affiliations. I care about the rules because they exist for a reason.   
---
&gt; So the game lost one of his best content creators for 30 days or more, just because he happened to be a Goon rival 
---
the game lost a small insignificant content creator because he didn't abide the rules. With your twisted logic, one could make the argument that botting is also fine cause it creates content. LolWhat. 
---
At this point, I can only ask WTF is wrong with you. Got sting by a bee lately? 
---
I already asked once, but no seriously, why do you actually care that much? Are you one of the sore ex-PL veterans?
---
Hi! We are aware of this problem and we are very sorry that this slipped through testing. We are currently testing a fix and we hope that we can deploy this fix very soon as part of a client update. I'll update here as soon as the client update has been deployed.
---

---
Yes there is a massive difference. Depending on where you plan on ratting then even a quiet HS beats LS in terms of income (this because you can farm the very profitable 3/10s which drop A-type frigate modules). While there are sites in LS that escalate into 6/10 NS still beats LS in that department hands down, since the sites that escalate into 6/10 are more abundantly available in NS (to the point where you can clear constellations of these sites for an entire day very quickly in LS while being able to chain-farm them in a single system in sov-null).
---
If you plan on living in LS I'd suggest adopting the mindset of roaming for PvP and doing DED's you stumble upon on the side, this way even on quiet roams you can end up making enough isk to fund your next ship.
---
Here's the thing, though - market making in this game is annoying and tedious, so people are always going to automate it.
---
What they should do is have in-game ways to automate it.  Select a starting price, an ending price and a duration, and have the market order automatically self-update at a regular interval.  Would require more computation on the server side but would make this kind of crap completely unnecessary and would rebalance the market game away from bots.
---
Same problem here, also after docking my chat channel which is active switches to another one. So if you write something it can happen that suddenly you write in another chat channel  ... this wasnt before a thing
---
thank you for the immediate response. 
---
Member when BL actually mattered?
---
I member.
---
&gt;Whenever I told Goons that CCP induced mechanics allowed to recruit them every single zombie turbokrab in this game and fence them behind game breakingly safe conditions they shat on me.
---
This argument is fundamentally flawed. Yes, CCP introduced mechanics that would have allowed every nullsec entity to recruit every single turbokrab in the game. It's only about goons because goons took the opportunity and used it where every other alliance in the game could have done the same but ultimately chose to stick with their Renting system which is basically a "Fuck your renters over while getting paid by them".   
---
Next thing you think is "but only the largest umbrella can protect people", which is another brainfart of yours. Yeah, use CE as an example region again that got stomped with it's completely imaginary umbrella (fact ist, DRF had NO Umbrella and NO Capitals on standby at all).   
---
nuff said. 
---
thats why you put in a minimum ammout so you get like 50 of x item instead of 1
---
clearly you never played market pvp in eve online
---
&gt; At this point, signs are pretty strong on that only people who create huge turmoil and 5 reddit threads on their names get checked for broadcasting.
---
So, start doing this? Surely with the mountains of evidence you've produced, you can name one person and demonize him. Why not work with the tools you've been given? It'd be a lot more convincing than talking in aggregate. That just makes you sound like you're raving with no proof at all, which is obviously not the case here.
---
He got shitstomped often by goons

I was the zarmazd - local reps, pimp (no abyssal stuff though), some heat and drugs
---
As an added 'Seconded' to this statment. Having the tickable Option for 'Aura Assistance' would **greatly assist players with sight impairment.** 
---
Features like being able to 'hover' over the cargohold on your capacator bar to know the %percentage of your hold filled is nice for the avarage player, but for short sighted, or generally sight impaired players, it might be nice to have Audio given for the landmarks of 50% and 75%
---
As an added, added supportive statement. I imagine it would be so nice for someone who wears glasses all day, or requires reading glasses, to be able to take them off at the end of the day, especially if they work with a screen throughout the working day.
---
This feature would be a wonderful idea for CCP to impliment, worthwhile, and not something directly game changing.
---
He was being paid by FRT to camp TEST specifically.
---
You need to find a small penis therapy
---
You're all being trolled, he's on holiday...
---
Wow, more StainGuy whining about PL. 
---
Have you considered a "change of tempo?"  
---
I've been having to flip overview tabs for a few weeks to get them to load up properly after log in.
---
Doesn't explain the different timestamps. They would sell all at the same time, with maybe 1-2 minutes total in between due to server lag.
---
Seconding the Newbie Corp thing with one catch. I joined Brave and in a lot of ways it was a good thing. They basically have content on a drip in Catch because they have a name for being willing to fight anything which is great if you just want to fleet up and fight. 
---
That said, personally I didn't really get any better at the game and the mechanics until I decided that I had enough cash from my Brave character to make an alt. It was just going to be used for Brave Logi but I wound up just dicking around on it as a lowsec learning toon and I've been having a blast trying to make a profit by shipping things between stations at a markup or getting into PI and missions. I think I'll eventually take it to try out wormholes.
---
My roundabout point is: you can join a newbie corp, theyre a great way to make cash or get a fight with no real pressure to be super active and that may be what you need, but they only really encompass a very small part of the game and I recommend joining up later after mesing around with smaller groups in lowsec a bit first OR with that as a goal to work toward. 
---
I agree on this, too many people are relying on (even legal) external programs and the API to update their orders anyway, putting you at a disadvantage if you don't...
---
Usually it's average value considered for risk/reward estimation, not discrete infrequent events. So if you do it purely "for science" - very well, but for practical purposes using, for example, worm is a lot more effective, since you have a lot less chance of diying and also can complete sites a lot faster.
---
In other news, your comment furthered a number of things, here's a list:
---
He's averaging two orders per minute or thereabouts? Seems a bit slow for a bot, hell even for a human. 
---
r/ThereWasAnAttempt
---
Can confirm :
---
https://zkillboard.com/related/30001058/201901212200/
---
IIRC you pay no broker fee if you set the order duration to "immediate".
---
If the order has any other duration you will pay the tax even if the item sells instantly.
---
A broken bot would most likely have a duration to their orders so they would pay 100 isk for every single sale.
---
You can't target same a ever tick with more than 5 6 ships.
---
ELI5 pls?
---
should we have ships and fits for free then?
---
If we recall a few months back to the "war" in the south and the Provi  shenanigans 100% of BB fleets that went south targeted TEST assets, and when they partook in big fights as a third party, they were always only against TEST fleets.
---
Is this a gevlon alt?
---
and? Anyone from TEST can become a BB fc and only hunt in PANFAM space  
---
&gt;And they need to clarify the way to report these people
---
You literally right click their name and press report, its not that hard...
---
Try wormholes.
---
Its like Eve on *Hard* mode
---
Please stop
---
Yeah this seems fake to me
---
Objection noted. Please visit the complaints department, located in Airlock no. 561.
---
Delve is like 5super 10rorq each syatem
---
Thats capital usage in every big block though. It's show of force majority of the time, occasional suicidal dread bombs, then maybe 1 real fight year, 2 if you're extremely lucky.
---
&gt; and its an issue ccp can EASILY fix but for whatever reason choose not to.
---
pray tell
---
Get an orca on a alt
---
Move from wormhole to wormhole 
---
Autistic?
---
Ya this isnt real
---
So someone sets a trillion isk on my head , I died in a fight get popped and have no skillpoints anymore ? Sounds like a good mechanic to kill the game 
---
Calling ccp’s Help Desk customer support is like calling a single bacterium complex multicellular life
---
&gt; There are tons of input broadcasters and bots in delve and surrounding areas
---
Probably, those it's hard to tell.  I don't see them.  Certainly some suspicious behaviour.  No worse than any other region.  Just more concentrated in Delve because the playerbase is more concentrated (average 50 pilots or more per system).
---
JUST KILLED A MAN (in game)

---
CCP its time to go back to the old clone system, where there higher your skill points the more you had to pay for a new clone every time you were podded, and if you did not have an adequate clone, you would lose skill points. 
---
The game was more fun then. 
---
Do you even know how their fleets work lol. They roll a ns static. Each time they roll it's a different region. Sometimes they don't roll delve at all.
---
If they wanted to come to delve all the time it's easy to arrange. You don't need a wormhole fleet for that
---
To be honest the name is pretty misleading, focus fire doesn't really mean "coordinate fire".

i had to open to post to see wtf is it

Being paid with botting money to input broadcast camp, lul. 
---
Yes, you can! Only the Mining Laser Optimization Charge will work, though.
---
If you're not afraid to lose the bonused link and/or only have few people available, you can also use something pretty funny, similar to what is below...
---
    [Magus, Your Favorite Magus]
---
    Co-Processor II 
---
    Co-Processor II
---
    Medium Shield Extender II
---
    EM Ward Amplifier II
---
    Adaptive Invulnerability Field II
---
    Mining Foreman Burst II, Mining Laser Optimization Charge
---
    Gas Cloud Harvester II
---
    [Empty High slot]
---
    Small Processor Overclocking Unit I
---
    Small Cargohold Optimization II
---
It actually works, though! 
---
Do the math: 
---
* Each Prospect mines 2.66 m3/sec (2 \* 1.33)
---
* Under Porpoise boosts without implants, it mines 3.86 m3/s (4.34 with links)
---
* Under Magus boosts without implants, it mines 3.72 m3/s (4.12 with links)
---
* Meaning that using the Magus makes you lose 0.14 m3/s per venture without links, or 0.22 with links
---
* ...but the Magus itself provides another 2.088 m3/s (2.313 with links) worth of mining due to the gas harvesters on the Magus itself
---
* All in all, this means that the Porpoise becomes worth it over the Magus only with \~15/20 Prospects on grid
---
* The key trade-off in this case is the cargo space on the Magus, so feel free to play it risky by making the Magus' tank thinner and add more cargo expansions for maximum antitank fun ;)
---
Of course, if someone has better insight or I made some mistakes (I'm no miner, and just writing this over lunch break), feel free to correct me!
---
Mostly seems like you guys just think its unfair lol
---
I asked if you had a source because it didn't mesh up with my experiences.
---
&gt; Focus Fire does not ensure they attack the same target as above.
---
Yeah, thats called a bug.  Shockingly, there are a lot of systems in EVE that don't always behave the way they should.  I know this may be a disturbing revelation.
---
when your hull hits 0 and u lose expensive ship.
---
This was a good fight - i wish bubbles weren't so obnoxious in their appearance though. Props to the guys for bringing the fight two times.
---
"NC. PL Special Interests"
---
T1 battleship I hear sniping raven is considered among the best. Otherwise most pirate faction bs will do, prime examples are machariel, barghest, rattlesnake and vindicator. Also if that's your thing and you have the skills for it, all marauders are golden.
---
&gt; Without the money I've earned from EVE I would likely still be in poverty as I had been for most of my life.
---
At least you going back to bread and water will be a small heartwarming event when the servers close.
---
Whining or laughing ?
---
Always try to if you died to a genuine bug or game error, 9/10 CCP will reimburse your ship.
---
T1 battleship missile or drones work best most common ships are sniping domis/raven/typhoon 
---
Same with the Provi vs Pamfam, they always targeted Provi. 
---
I prefer the Raven 
---
Hmm what kind of support is needed for unreleased game that didn't even leave alpha stage?        
---
Yeaaaa but he does it for 4 straight hours
---
Amarr is literally golden 
---
Ok, so how is that different from a militia serving the whims of big blocs?
---
&gt;You do realize those 'absolute' boosters expired on January 7th, right?
---
You have to piss someone off pretty badly for trillion ISK bounty on your head. Idea was to make bounty to really worth something. Killing a game is just a small side-effect.
---
In first idea killer of bounty target gets ISK, proportional worth of which deleted from bounty target SP.
---
In second idea no one gets ISK, instead ISK used to "prepay" SP transfer from bounty target to it's killer.
---
Fakes news, no BR exists without Snuff helicopter dicking everything with Titans/Super
---
&gt; By running as many accounts as I do it is possible to earn over 8,000 Euros a month (after losses from banned accounts, etc) in an area of the world where the average person makes less than 700 Euros a month 
---
So, let me get this straight. You're allegedly making your livelihood off botting, and "surviving" in your area of the world. Yet you want to shed light on the group/ability to do so? That in no way makes any sense if you are actually relying on this a way to survive. Why would you give 2 shits about this game/community if botting is your source of  IRL income?
---
Not to mention the complete lack of any specific names listed in your post of whom in leadership actually encourages/turns a blind eye to botting. This entire post just reeks of trolling/grr goons. I don't like goons, but this is just all kinds of low effort trolling.
---
I am terrible at this game for many reasons, one of them is... insurance never seems worth it. I lose a capital maybe 1 in 50 times I undock it to face shoot someone, ergo I think to myself... if I keep buying insurance on my cap ships, at the end of the day it costs me *more* than if I just eat the loss when I get popped in one. 
---
I'm using machariel with fit under 1bil I've found on YouTube. Other option is sentry, rapid heavy rattle I had fun with. Then you need very good frog skills for burners. 
---
In general choose one and stick to it. Get gunnery or missiles and drones support skills to at least 4 and you'll have good time. 
---
most of the fcs are not in big blocs. I've only been in one BB where we couldn't attack goons because the fc used his goon main, all other fleets we have gone for the first targets we find.
---
Nothing is stopping you from joining and look for yourself, or just look at the KB and see that there are kills from all blocs
---
If you're not running a close to 1:1 ratio on FAX to titans/supers, are you even playing EVE in 2019?
---
How 2 farm sp find a venture in high sec put a bounty and blap with a gankalyst you have enough time to pod 
---
Excuse me, sir, the whole entire point is to see fewer people undock to, you know, drop Titans and MoM fleets on cruiser gangs. 
---
Well maybe a trillion is a big number but I’m pretty sure some alliances will pay multiple billions or even more on hated hated people .. losing skillpoints because someone else wants it is a dumb idea 
---
Yeah, I also with the same for the link animation.
---
I believe there was something like this when eve younger were you had to upgrade your clone to not loose sp or something not sure tho 
---
Comparing vaporware with dead game :D
---
They already are. They are already invulnerable to the vast majority of eve, and can only be countered by other alliances that can field large masses of capitals and super capitals. 
---
You can do the same with an orca, for cheaper, but with less ship and you're not blocked by low class wh
---
This is the best idea. 
---
&gt;Am **I retarded** or not yet?
---
I would do that to a random person just because i can. 
---
That would kill the game.
---
Sentient DDAs are taking over the ship

\&gt;medium shield booster

yep that's a fine breacher you got there m8.

Get a ship with fitting bay near it and fit a cloak and jump til you reach neutral space like provi if you aren’t kos atleast its what i would do never flown a cap outside of sisi
---
Make a captcha popup every tick on wallet xD Boting/Population problems solved :D
---
It is also the only masterrace in new eden and doesn't afraid of anything, but that really has more to do with personal beliefs.
---
Join a wh corp! There's always things to be done, ships to be blown and isk to be made. Spoopy is recruiting.
---
Dear r/eve, this week I sat and looked at my spreadsheets do absolutely nothing... and enjoyed it.
---
Yep , but people own dumbness would have lost them SP not someone with to much isk 
---
Just make it more expensive than buying injectors.
---
Dreads have never been as powerfull as they are now thanks to Remote Rep supers no longer being a thing.
---
 Look at the DW- beacon bomb, look at the countless ratting supers that get cobbed in delve. 
---
Sure, sometimes a dreadbomb goes wrong, you might even pull a PGL and feed 250 dreads. But in the end you at worst lose a couple ten or hundred billion.
---
If you also lost skillpoints, it would be vastly more expensive.
---
If it's not stuck by a bug, no chance. And there is a good reason for it.
---
Renters are underrated, if anyone brings fights it's renters and especially these
---
MEDIC! MAN DOWN!
---
If the number of threads guarantees action, why aren't you burying this forum with your vendetta?

Well I mean, someone has to handle all the subscribers, manage that realistic economy, kick the bots offline (oh wait that never happens) and general other stuff..... oh wait you think that only one of the games is alpha. Good bait mate!
---
i'd suggest rattlesnake for best efficiency 
---
focus on missiles and drones. with active shield X-Large booster.

The PvP roams are a lie, krabs do not leave their safehavens lest they have overwhelming numbers, which take time to form.

Three days in a row I ran an abyssal site thinking about putting in an hour of two of farming to be confortable with my wallet. each day I looted a desintegrator spec skillbook (between 300 and 400M). Bless be Triglav.

Was kn goons for 2 weeks and saw lots of bots and input broadcasters. Please name them thanks 2 weeker. 
---
thanks :)
---
A 1 run job doesn't produce 1 piece of ammo. A T1 run is 100 charges, T2 runs are larger (5000 IIRC, not sure).
---
I mean we do smaller fleets and everyone generally manages their own ship but we still have a shot caller.  Especially with booshing otherwise you'll have like 3 people spool at once lol.
---
Oh wow  !!!
---
TBF- His new name for you seems apt after your little "reee".
---
Of course, you can't really be on r/eve without being a bit retarded

Apply to the local superpower with your alt then sell it through them. Then dash.

Bots.

lol init blobbing the fuck out of them with bombers.
---
gtfo
---
I have 6 cloaky / cyno characters. I have used them once, to hunt for a blops group. I have cloaky camped zero times. It just feels.. lame. I  guess I just didn't feel compelled personally to do it. It feels much more like an area denial attack than anything else. It isn't content, but the denial of content through implied threat.
---
Are standings belonging to Corporations even used for anything anymore? I have 2 corporations from years ago when I used them for high sec POS anchoring but now that you don't need them for that anymore, I just wonder - anything else I can use them for or should I just shut these corps down?
---
Then whats the point in having it at all if you have to put a bil in bounty to work
---
My guess (and it's just that), is that he ate the 30 day after the cyno incident for the first offense, and ate a perma later.
---
vOv
---
^ sell immediate or sell outside a hub
---
why would u input broadcast ingame actions across cloaky campers u fuckin morons 
---
CCP handles this kind of thing very well. Only time I had this kind of issue was when I was new and did not realized that you could not log in multiple characters on the same account at the same time. I had bought a plex to enable a second skill queue but found out the hard way that it would not do what I want. I sent the ticket to ccp, they refunded my plex and I was able to start my second account with it. This all took less than a day.
---
I think that things like this are pretty straight forward so don't take a lot of time. What you see people complaining about is the hard stuff like accounts being hacked and assets stolen. Those take time and research. These softball tickets get knocked out quickly.
---
You know, you have a valid point.
---
that doesnt make ccp money
---
pve/ in game stuff you only need one account
---
major null sec wars you need a titan account, super account, 5 burner alts, subcap pilot, 45 indy alts, and 2147 vni alts
---
duh which one makes more sense
---
Because killer don't pay a dimm.
---
And piss off your entire playerbase.
---
I was briefly in CAS and then was kicked after 2 weeks because I got on Mar5hy's bad side. Although Cow and others wouldn't own up to that being the main reason and told me they were "purging out anyone who didn't have skills for their new doctrines" which isn't a reason u boot a 2 week old member. They gave me my stuff back but wouldn't give me temp access to any facilities inside their c2 so I lost like 4bil in pods.  Feels good to see what goes around comes around.
---
8/10 shitpost.
---
&gt; the only constant
---
LOL are you living in pre-injector era?
---
Said this on the other post and will say it here. Mar5hy is an extremely toxic player to play with and BB is not that fun on the inside. They aren't the good guys plebbit thinks the yare.
---
What is input broadcasting? What did I miss? 
---
Sell in outlying areas. You still have to do market PvP but with less people 
---
&gt;It also sets a really bad precedent by ccp because they didn't do anything at all initially and then moved on it when 'the community' (heavily favored in the null-bear-i-wanna-get-rich playstyle) said something about it.
---
ccp has been setting this precedent since as long as ive been around moron
---
I mean, we were hunting rorquals but didnt find anything except the clusterfuck of bubbles you can see on the video. We didnt search for a fight and we were just clearing bubbles when they warped at 0, got dragged 30 km of us in their own bubble and died to bombs. I know we blobbed them, but they suicided, we didnt force them. The brought a fight being insanely outnumbered, they are brave and thats why I posted thr BR. 
---
Is there any evidence of his banning available? Like anything at all?
---
Use the drone that applies against the abyss environment, e.g. if the abyss is exotic use drones that do kinetic damage.  
---
Yeah but then you're faced with the issue of tiny volume where you might sell a few units a day and do people really buy ships and modules in non trade hub systems? 
---
I'm assuming 99.9% of people buy at a trade hub because they have access to all ships, all modules, all ammo etc all in 1 place. I find it hard to believe someone would buy their ship in x system, then fly it bare 3 jumps to pick up 3 modules, then fly it another 4 jumps to pick up the rest of the modules all while paying more money? 
---
Why not just fly to the trade hub, by everything you need cheap and be on your way? That's why I think the only real profit to be made is in null because there are no trade hubs... at least for dozens and dozens of jumps.
---
Are you referring to people threatening other people for their lives / hands? Cause I 'd be pretty concerned about that even if it's not *ON THEIR SERVERS.*
---
Using programs that send one keystroke to multiple clients is not allowed.
---
Not interesting per say, but I've got the fire for eve again after 2 ish years away playing overwatch (no not with Jayne) at a masters level.
---
Got right back in with a fun Corp and am enjoying small gang fighting.
---
While on my break though, I did finally push through 100 mill SP so... Go me! 
---
i laughed at this...hard 
---
RNI ftw, I love that ship
---
Correct. High volume means high competition. 2000 nerds all with the same goal in mind, making isk. Find things with lower volume and you will find less competition.
---
Bounties are not just about because you pissed people off.  It’s a way of tracking (and laughing) at your friends and corp mates.  You get a pop up of hey xxx was killed when you paid a bounty on them.  Easier then stalking their zkill see like damn that’s the third xyz ship you lost this week?  Dipshit
---
Keep undercutting them by a larger margin. If someone undercuts you by 0.01 ISK, undercut them by 300,000 ISK or more, depending on the item you're selling. At some point it'll become unprofitable for them to continue doing that and your items will sell. The other option is to just sit there babysitting your orders all day and never enjoy the actual game.
---
Its crooked
---
I am torn between two great and powerful leaders. One tall and one Club.
---
Cheerio dickhead. 
---
umm
---
No love for Nyx bots?
---
That’s the choice you make... either go for a quieter market and less involvement or the full blown 0.01 ISK gang...
---
Jita is obv the busiest. Amarr is competitive. Rens, dodixie, and hex less so. Don’t forget the big player owned markets too. Usually 1 more established per region. Yes people buy whole ships/fit from them, and all other random things you wouldn’t believe, and often pay more than Jita for the convenience of not having to go there. Potentially you could corner an entire market.
---
Assuming you don’t want to go to the nullsec ones, such as providence or solitude, and equally avoid markets 1 jump away from a trade hub. I like Tanoo, in Derelik.
---
Just go afk already retard
---
Well, that's different then
---
Why would I ever pay a bounty to have someone else collect the sp then?  Great idea to kill the game and corps/alliances.  Find the ceo/director or a corp, bounty their ass, and have them lose the skills needed to be one or have that many members and corp dissolved by CCP because oops not you can’t have that many members? 
---
Goons will surely brigade this Unit 130037 til justice is served, right? Right Goons?
---
Yeah pls no bully honest, hardworking miners and industrialists.
---
If this is the new template on how to get shit done, dont let stainguy see this post
---
K
---
Of course not, the bots do that for me.
---
if CCP was banning bots aggressively half of Ranger Regiment would be banned. It's so blatant. If you look at the KB alone you can see the same people dying to NPCs/Hunters multiple times a day.
---
Shhh, thats day 3.
---
Maybe not a full on bot but a mouse or keyboard macro.
---
You can run level 4 missions comfortable in pirate cruisers (especially the Gila), heavy assault cruisers (like the Ishtar), and T1 battleships (Raven or Typhoon for example). Faction or pirate battleships work of course even better. You can run them in some T1 battlecruisers if you have good skills but it's less smooth.
---
Which ship is the best depends a lot of your "style". Some like to clear the whole mission, some only kill as much in a mission as is needed to finish it, some decline certain missions. Certain agents give you other missions. For example there is a level 4 mission group called Angel/Gurista/Serpentis Extravaganza. Your agent will only give you one of those. So depending on which missions your agent likes to give you one ship might be better than another. (It's actually also an option to decline those as they take relatively long.)  
---
As an orientation: The Rattlesnake is good if you want to kill everything because it has very high DPS but it warps slow. The cruiser options and the Machariel are interesting if you don't want to kill everything but just finish the mission quickly because of their warp speeds.
---
I know how nullsec statics work. Nothing stops them rolling that hole until it connects to the south of the map.
---
The nyx bots increase the demand for ore and thus the number of rorqual bots. Its a tragic cycle. 
---
This is true, please forward me all info you have. Lets work together on this. 
---
Late
---
Same thing happened to me.  According to senior gm, I hit the "outside" of the arena even though I wasn't too far from the warp gate.
---
CCP doesn't give a shit about bots. [These](https://imgur.com/a/4Rx2xP8) have been here forever with numerous reports.
---
Why isn't there a second Muninn buff on your manifesto? 
---
Omni tank tengu 😁🤘
---
how can you be CSM if your afk xD
---
Please forward me the info in an evemail.... lets work on this together
---
Feel free to point out a single place I've said that.
---
I just laugh at the hypocracy of them claiming to be neutral while always seeming to end up in the same small handful of regions time after time.
---
If they are targeting a certain area or group. Just own it. Lying about it is just childish.
---
Who will you nominate as your successor when you burn out after a month?

Oh yeah I know that now but I really just wish that it weren't the case.

Props for counting the days for the historical accuracy of the comment.

Big if true.

we reformed

&gt;  Beg you not to vote for Brisc Rubal Beg you not to vote for Sort Dragon

I foresee some awkward small-talk at the first CMS gathering.
---
What's your stance on coke for every fleet?
---
they are already the strongest cruiser platform for you swiss army knife doctrine
---
you're*
---
Hard to get into most high end PVE for new players too especially people who want to PLEX their account right away like it's a job, it was hard enough to farm 150m to do that back in 2008, good luck grinding 1.8billion isk from level 2 missions lol.
---
Ha yea I'd never vote for AFK KNIGHT for CSM make sure to cast all you're votes for our fellow goons
---
Pepsi Max is better.
---
i heard it was a social experiment gone wrong
---
Please enlight me on how you're gonna help CCP combat bot as CSM except tell them it's a big concern for everyone.

If you want cheap you can't go wrong with a MJD Sentry Dominix.
---
COSMOS loot was moved into the loot table of regular exploration sites a while back. The BPCs come from sleeper caches. There is still a supply of this storyline items, although it is a chore to sell them due to low demand.
---
has anyone else been banned during this "ban wave"?

&gt; You have to piss someone off pretty badly for trillion ISK bounty on your head.
---
No you don't. I'm sure that goons could afford to systematically wipe out every other player in the game using this method. And they would probably do it to, not to win the game but just to be doing it.
---
PvP
---
Then be disappointed.
---
Doesn't change the fact ccp didn't give a shit until he started whining about it to media outlets.
---
To soon
---
Cool I suggest CCP to move all previous time bans for botting to perma bans retrospectively. Lets see how sincere your anti bot credentials are.
---
Kids with guns are botters? Shocker.
---
Torpedoes on the dominix, dominix AND dominix!
---
Is the supply still growing, or did CCP shut off some of the items and just waiting for them to become extinct?
---
No, he's referring to Stunt, who got banned for ~~impersonating a dev~~ mocking Fozzie sov in an image he never even posted publicly, but made the rounds on reddit and eve discords.
---
FCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC oooOooOoOooo, didn’t mean to crash the gate
---
It looks like you mostly covered fleet uses, so I wanted to chime in on some of those niche cases for OP. 
---
The hecate can fit a *mean* little tank if you fit it for tank, while also keeping some pretty solid DPS albiet at very short range. [I only died here because I misclicked travel mode instead of tank](https://zkillboard.com/kill/73492259/)
---
It also get a base &lt;2s align in prop mode so that is pretty solid.  
---
The confessor can be fit to be a great mid-long range dps or anti small shit 
---
You can fit it to hit ~2600m/s in prop mode with 70km range using beams.  Its still pretty slow, but with good positioning you be effective in a small gang.
---
The jackdaw and the svipul can also both be fit with a pretty solid passive tank, scram and probes +cyno if you want, for a good prober and initial tackle.  
---
have you deleted the csm yet?
---
Make a Video, post evidence 
---
EZ 
---
Go back over everything again and actually pay attention to if you are enjoying doing it this time.
---
You'll know because you'll hit this spot where you think you've only been playing for a short period of time but suddenly it ate up all the time you had to play the game.
---
You guys did an awesome job. Excellent tribute gents.
---
Can't tell if stupid or...
---
Would you like to know more?
---
I haven't played in a couple of years but have some friends who made a WH Corp sitting in a C4 trying to get me back. I did nothing but hauling back in the day and little to no pvp, so posts like this are encouraging even though I have no idea what I'm doing now. 
---
&gt;and by some stroke of a miracle wait until the demand is greater than supply for a few days and my order gets filled
---
This is a legit trading/speculating strategy. List at what you're confortable selling and wait till the market adjusts updating every month or so.
---
But you need the stock and cash and characters to keep arround. And you ll loose if the market settles higher than your order.
---
Being a new marketer then i'd bank on what is siggesyed below. If you're gettong undercut by 0.01 undercut by 100k, keep the cash flowing. 
---
Ah got it. Alright, makes sense now.
---
I guess I missed that BB fleet. 
---
Someone must have a video of it somewhere 
---
Total quantity of stuff get sold, divide that by 3, keep your order above that quantity. Basically, update your orders like 2-3 a day and it's just wait game. Usually that'll get your shit sold within few days. 
---
Sell for a fair price 1 to 5 % cost of production. Few will follow you down there if they do then buy their items. Hold there for 90+ days and await market departure of competition and increase price until competition returns, rince and repeat.
---
if you play eve for long enough you will use drones as well. and at that point you can confirm this by yourself. so yes this is a legit bug that exists since the beginning of eve.
---
This has been a familiar form of propaganda since at least 2013
---
&gt; Giving input onto the ships and modules balance of the game
---
What good is input when CCP take no actions... Pretty sure Suitonia has raised how the game is currently completely broken... zero feedback to the community.

Why so mad though?
---
Wew. Dude has a serious hateboner for BL.
---
The problem is, input broadcasting itself isn't illegal in and of itself, if you use it for certain things CCP has laid out.  A chat message isn't a smoking gun for malicious cheating.  We have to take their word for it that he went beyond what is legal, and given their laundry list of public failures in the banning of bots and broadcasters, their word is very nearly worthless.
---
Suitonia is a small gang guy - I fly in every size fleet and also FC

Yeah my fessor is

4x beams, combats

2x nano, 2x sinks DCU, Saar

---
So I have a shield fit I've been crafting but haven't run yet, I think it would function well if you needed to get quick disposable dps on a target that was already tackled. 
---
Otherwise I think the armor tank is superior since with blasters the only thing it has going for it is a beefy tank. 
---
BL is fucking trash still sitting in sakht 7-7 to afraid to undock cause they are all a bunch of pussies when elo is gone no other fcs than elo and can only fly 1 doctrine what a fucking aborted joke of an alliance
---
 Hear, hear 
---
point being?
---
You think they care more about your opinion and all of a sudden will balance the game?
---
Ok so you go to harass goon's rorqs by killing a few of their harvester drones. Only as soon as you are spotted you get max sp loss bounty. Now if you fail to escape the capital drop you are losing huge amounts of SP. What are you gonna do? Risk potentially billions of isk to kill a few drones or just leave?
---
I have been flying Gallente and Gurista's ships almost exclusively since I first logged in in 2014. I am well aware that it *exists* but I am not convinced it is a bug. The stray drones always seem to be going after something that's targeting them.

CCPls ban ice excavators! they confuse the bot "hunters"

It's going to be real entertaining when it turns out he wasn't banned.

check out hateless_gaming on YT. he has a bunch of fits for battleships (dominix, apocalypse, raven, etc.) and some tips on how to do level 4s.
---
As far as I can tell nothing has been shut off. The change ensured that the loot to build storyline stuff would be dispersed widely among explorers, even if they had little clue what it was for. It makes its way to Jita buy orders. The stuff that used to be super rare is less rare now. I suspect that the existence of custom abyssal items has somewhat reduced the demand for storyline.
---
Well, that might be calling it a bit too soon. It's very possible he gets booted for leaking or untoward conduct before he burns out. After all, he isn't an Imperium candidate -- that makes him orders of magnitude more likely to be removed from CSM due to misconduct.

I know this is a meme posting of sorts... but I can't say I disagree with the end run desire. I multi-box and manage my screens manually. It's not that easy (also, this is a video game- so come on, it's not that hard either) but that said... I could do infinitely more clients if I was the type to break rules and input broadcast. I am not that sort, so it's annoying to see others get away with input broadcasting or botting. Mind you, afk rorqual mining isn't either of those and they die in fires naturally so I'm not referring to them. It's not wrong for people to want a playing field with the same rule sets applied evenly for all.
---
More along the lines of, it's simply necessary to get things done when you're not part of the alliance with 60% of the game's players.
---
I was actually worried we had missed it and NEATO was planning our own memorial roam so me know as well and we will join if possible.
---
lmao idiot tapi

He has hands on experience
---
Why did you cowardly fuck off to PH staging rather than continue your campaign in Delve? Did it get too hard for you? Do you need your mother to tell you you're elite?
---
Alright so here's the thing, your story is completely unbelievable because you are posting it here. If your story is true then outting you to save face is the optimal thing to do so you just shotgunned yourself in the nutsack.
---
So either you are monumentally stupid or a huge liar. Neither is a good look to have.
---
Obviously Reddit is full of Trolls and Idiots but I'm not asking to take over the historical names of great Corps.  I'm saying that 15 years ago, a single player made a Corp named Willie Killers (or one of a thousand other simpleton names) and since he made this Corp **15 years ago**, every single ticker was still available and he claimed \[KILL\].  He then promptly quit and a hundred great PvP Corps have come along and formed great long-lasting Corps but no one, for 15 years, has been able to use the ticker \[KILL\] because Willie never did anything with it but he **also never came back** to the game.  15 years ago, every ticker name was available and, since you're not getting this simple concept, no one made a ticker like \[-.KX.\] if they could just use \[KILL\].  The problem, Morons, was that they took the ticker and never came back to the game.
---
Tickers have been reused since the beginning of the game when the Corp is actually disbanded and not left forgotten for a decade.  No one ever thought that those tickers were being 'stolen' from a great Corp of the past.  They were just recycled.  Responsibly.
---
You mean you flew every size fleet twice and then went off to play Fortnite.

...says the group that keeps losing...

And Erotica 1, who invited people onto a private teamspeak server and recorded them doing the most embarrassing things to try to win free ISK.
---
&gt;demand is still just as low as it was before
---
this may be one of your problems. always look for markets with decent sales volume. just because an item has a large spread between sell and buy prices doesnt mean its a good item to trade.
---
Haha,  encountered that one too yesterday
---
I love this post, and want to play too! Let’s see:

Day 1 of wormhole pvp bots not being banned!   
---
Day 5 of Jita market bots not being banned!   
---
Day 823 of Reddit meme bots not being banned!

Wow, so original, creative, and fun. Yes, let’s do this journey together, at least 10 times a day.

Session changes fix a lot of issues in eve. Logging, docking, and jumping between system all seem to be useful.

No I wasn't referring to that

I think your off the point here. There isn’t anything good coming from having any bot in the game. But ccp keeps turning a blind eye to them.

Who would ever know with all the meta level deception.

So I suppose you've got some proof that proves BB rolls holes until they get one in Delve right? Comms/Video....you know...evidence instead of bullshit?
---
Sounds like you have become what you hate the most.

Amarr is a nice medium volume market if you got a decent amount of capital, it's entirely possible to corner a common PvP module and jack it up a lot. This week-end the Faint warp scram was 400% jita because someone cleaned house...

Be careful. You are not a goon so your posts may be removed.

i think its hilarious u kids talking shit about goon rorqs. u wouldnt say this shit to them at a locus swarm, they are jacked. not only that but they wear the freshest purple mods, mine at the chillest moon fracks and hangs out with the hottest exhumers. yall are pathetic lol

When it s like this for buy order, i make really buy order and i laugh : ok i pay more than i should but the trader has his marge totally fucked up. i did this last week when i was buying stuff faction deadspace for one super.
---
FYI he's not banned btw ;) Don still in systems..
---
There are 40 odd VNI bots in the Fountain pipe between 5CDQA and IGE-RI (like 14 jumps). I've reported these dozens of times.  
---
Oh, they get banned. Then they get replaced by more bots with the same ship names and same bot scripts (same origin structure, same undock timer, same fits if you blow one up).  
---
Generally it takes CCP about 3 weeks to trashcan a VNI bot. If the botter invests just 2.5m SP initially (say 4bn in injectors), at 22/7 of 50m hourly, minus 100m for the ship and 1.7bn to plex the account, you are still left with a 17.3bn profit over three weeks.  
---
Yeah, no. Reporting them and waiting for CCP to bother banning them simply isn't working.  
---
This isn't a dig at Init &amp; TNT. These bots are everywhere, this just happens to be where I hunt.
---
You have no chill bro.

I remember hunting Russian ratter-bots in the drone regions ten years ago. Nothing changes. Now we want everyone in a titan so we have Rorq bots.

This is the dumbest meme I've seen and I've seen many

CCP should sell their own bots for PLEX. Then they would have an incentive to shutting down all the other bots.

So a CCP, a company, with real games, has better customer support then a scam? hmm

How would you handle not having any coke while in Iceland? Or do you have a supplier there already?
---
&gt; I know how nullsec statics work. Nothing stops them rolling that hole until it connects to the south of the map.
---
Apparently you don't know how they work. Statistically each wormhole has about 2% chance to spawn in Delve. You can roll one wormhole per 5 minutes at the fastest. If they made their fleets wait 250 minutes or more all for a Delve wormhole, they'd bleed fleet counts pretty fast.
---
They hunt in all viable wormholes. Space viable for whaling has shrunk because you recruited all whales. So they hunt in Delve whenever a roll happens. And get many kills there because you also recruited all brain dead people incapable of lighting a cyno.
---
is that before or after you go afk again?  or are you simply looking for a better excuse to be afk for?

---
Nobody ever wanted to ban afk mining, you can flame the style of playing for narratives and laughs, but if somebody likes to do this its ok.

It is all about people managing to magically give the same command to 20+ Accounts within the same servertick. And there I don't give a shit if it is somebody doing this for PvP or for PvE.

Hell one of their corp ceo's even publicly admitted that he was the guy botting about 20 Nyx in Omist and after losing them due to local bugs switching to 300 Gila Bots in Feythabolis. If I remember right he said he was the former CEO of P.I.R.A.T. (with his main).
---
To repeat a few others, head to a smaller market, also use differences in market hubs prices to find items that move ok and have a decent enough price differential.  If you are new at this and/or don't have much capital, then Jita is not for you.  I made my first bn trading in Hek, when fw was a more active, but found that I had to switch items on a regular basis as others also played the regional arbitrage game.

There is a little flex to the size and shape of the space bubble, and the gate moves a little in that space too. It can be anywhere from 15-40km from the edge. This is why it's not safe to orbit the gate with an mwd ship. Orbiting the bioadaptive can is more consistent
---
i did some figuring after the fight, and...  it has a higher damage mitigation than a ceptor or garmur running 10km/s ...  
---
The caracals would have melted it... if any of the tackle had 2 webs, at least we know now. 
---
Trolling aside I’d rather just not put any more time into a game that won’t even go enforce their EULA. I have been unsubbed for 4 months now and just comment here and there when I see stuff interesting pop up on reddit. I always loved the community. However the game is no longer worth paying to play or dedicate any time to. I respect ppl like tall CEO that still try to make something of the game and still have the dream. However, I’ll no longer be dedicating time and money to eve. I’ll continue to play FPS with my bro’s like wallymarts though. 
---
The narrative demands that I ask you: Why did you not report them already? Is it because of "no blue fucking" ?
---
yes, that would be the sane option. OP however wanted a new way to "carry" people into battle with carriers, which kinda already exist with titans
---
Sure, let's just ignore an entire sect of the gaming community as whole in favor of grabbing as much money as we can, right now. It's not like enhancing the story, lore, and PvE content won't provide a more meaningful experience for those who don't want all pvp all the time, therefore attracting more potential players and subscriptions, making CCP more money in the long run.
---
Join the imperium, come down to Delve, the 1DQ market is bursting at the seams.
---
&gt;you can see the same people dying to NPCs/Hunters multiple times a day.
---
Maybe they're just bad?
---
We can make a better world.

I've encountered this bug numerous times. If you click approach and then DO NOTHING, your ship will approach correctly, but if you click anything (move cam, turn off/on modules, etc) you will go back to aligning to a random spot. Fucking sucks.

Only if you’re Narcissus.

Horrible idea.

Just no.

Simple -- I don't know of any nyx bots. I don't go out and seek them out. The only reason I even know they're the most common kind of capital ratting bot is because of the [New Year Security Update.](https://www.eveonline.com/article/pljaph/new-year-security-update)
---
No
---
"awful" don't be a prude you bigot nazi

I report bots like mad. CCP rarely gives a fuck. Some explo bots have disappeared, but others are happily making RL money for their owners.

Losing what? Certainly not to your coalition. Don't let your Dino overlords brainwash you like that.

Every time I buy salvage with a one jump buy order in perimeter I wind up having to collect it from 10 different stations
---
Well let's make a list: Off the top of my head, corp standings were good for:  
---
- anchoring towers  
---
- reduced refining taxes in NPC stations  
---
- installing jump clones in NPC stations  
---
- allowing corp members with lower standings to access higher level Agents  
---
It seems that everything but the last point has been supplanted by nerfs and Upwell structures.
---
Because their FC was using retard-level tactics and didn't do what any competent FC did, which was change tactics when they don't work. 
---
&gt;Please forward me the info in an evemail.... lets work on this together
---
I was not flaming amigo. I was defining that I see a distinct difference in the two and wanted to highlight which item I disliked.
---
Is it considered voyeurism to cloaky camp vni bots? 
---
You can also send me the details, we have a group who investigate and kick any renters who are caught actively botting, as well as reporting them to CCP.   
---
Only the Fountains / Initiative A ones tho pls - Dark Shines ingame.
---
Why is this post even still here?
---
60 dps seems a bit low. If you had to sacrifice a lot of dps for tank wouldn't it be better to dedicate one of the frigs to be a logi so the other two could focus more on dps?
---
If the logi gets focused they can just pull range and use a self rep. If you can fit a similar amount of repping through the logi but fit double the dps then not only do you cover for the loss of one dps but actually gained another dps effectively.
---
then again... &gt;focus fire
---
also I've had some time in WH space krabbing with nestor duos. set drones to passive and expected them to not auto-attack the rats... and guess what happened. they auto-attacked the rats.

drone behavior is bugged. it's a bug so old it's even in the famous [RMR short animation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnKk2ysyNrA&amp;t=182).

They stream the fleets, mate...
---
why are eve players so obsessed with calling other groups pets?
---
Yes they do make people wait. Go and watch the streams. The guy literally apologises multiple times a night for the lack of content.
---
as long as mar5y is still about, whatever these are doing is about 
---
The combination is awesome and tear extracting at the same ... The ship and the System he disconnected for the last time ....
---
Is this... Now?
---
I've seen quite a reduction in the value of relic sites too.
---
I've got screen captures of you saying very bad things to me, how much isk to not post them?
---
Is impass better? I was quickly discouraged by neuts trying to poke me inappropriately and gave up ratting in catch.
---
Just make it a mini-game. ``pirate_faction`` is angry that you're collecting bounties on their ships, so they hack the Gibson and you have to counter-hack to save your tick. Throw in some shitty skin/clothing rewards for "you didn't fuck up ``#`` times" milestones and people will love it.
---
Going to vote for somebody who will actually stick around. You don't give a fuck. You just cant let go. Need BIG SHINY TITLE
---
CCP should just allow all isboxer and Logitech functions again. 
---
Yes, early in my career I received a donation from somebody who won EVE. It was only a billion or so, but it was quite a bit more than my net worth at the time. I transferred the ISK outside of my main character's wallet so I wouldn't be tempted to spend it or accidentally get scammed out of it, and it came in handy later once I had developed career goals.

Congratulations! Good luck with your campaign.

I would like how you want to achieve all those wonderful things?
---
How can you help CCP combat botters?  
---
How can you help CCP to prevent lag?  
---
Will you start to work as a dev for CCP or what?
---
Except for balancing CSM members can't really give valuable input to those problems except to point out that they exist. And I doubt that CCP needs help to realise those problems. Bug reports are for that.

none. 
---
How do you want to improve HiSec PvP and why is the Catalyst the best ship in the game?
---
Only if they also put in an turn aura totally off button

Marauders in my opinion are still the best level 4 mission running ships.

So would the price of Plex crash is somehow managed to ban all the bots and keep them from coming back?  I feel like a significant number of accounts are bot accounts.

Dude I designed their fleet concept and started those fleets when I was in BB. I don't need to watch any stream (PS: I did watch many of them too). I just told you that you can roll one wh per 5 minutes. OFC they don't hunt in all wormholes. There are 0 whales in many null regions in Eve? So make people wait, sometimes half an hour. That doesn't mean they keep rolling 4 to 8 hours until they hit Delve specifically.
---
You're just severely uneducated on how these fleets work to be able to rightly interpret the streams. But that's not an excuse when I tell explain how they work.
---
There are other trade hubs than Jita. I sell all my shit in Dodixie e.g. It takes a little more time to sell, but there is less competition and there prices are a little higher. Other than that, if you want/need to sell your shit right away buy orders are your only options. Markets go up and down all the time, everything that is reasonable will sell eventually.
---
Since October we have had continually escalating tentions over the Minmatar/Amarr boarder.
---
It started with a series of terrorist attacks within the Khanid region, and escalated to out right conflict between both NPC actors and player actors. This took the form of a major blockade that I believe you can still go to and interact with, as well as an active conflict in which Amarr allianed organizations layed seige to a Minmatar controlled Raitaru, including a member of the Amarrian fleet in an Apostle (this took place in high security space).
---
This week I hope to record an episode with a member of PIE who was involved in this, to get the full story.
---
Additionally, we now have news that strongly suggest another flashpoint between the Gallente and Caldari are coming. 
---
Lore is happening, but people are convinced that it is not, and thus ignore it as irrelivent. 
---
One thing I did early on was salvaging/looting in FW warzones. Lots of elite wrecks with valuable salvage, lots of abandoned drones, often unlooted wrecks... lots of PvPers to run away from to keep it exciting. 
---
Shortly got into FW myself... I'd go out in a T1 PvP frigate and farm one enemy novice plex to pay for that ship (and then some) and then go get blown up.
---
reading, its a skill
---
Make some friends, then the game itself is just the frame for additional social contacts and enjoyment...
---
You got my vote! 
---
Elo secretly likes the zealot more.
---
There aren't enough sites for the amount of explorers especially with all these bots. There were times where I jumped 45-60 jumps in my astero and found no relic sites and only some data sites worth 3-6 mill. It's sometimes more profitable to run level 3 missions. Ha
---
Join the Delve bots?
---
Wait, you want me to actually pray. Can't I just give you a facebook like in exchange for 1 pray?
---
How much are you paying for votes???  My friends and I have tremendous amounts of votes to cast.
---
I started playing about a year ago exclusively exploring in null and wh space. After 2 to 3 months I started playing other aspects of the game. I recently returned to exploration (about the last 2 to 3 weeks) in and around stain and I literally come across an explorer in about 50% of systems I enter.
---
I scan about 10 data sites for each relic site found.
---
I have the opinion (misinformed or not) that the explorer market is saturated at least in around stain.
---
If I can't go to the relic sites, I am going to try to have others bring them to me. Planning on shipping a t3c out to do some hunting.
---
Great video :-) some of the most fun I have had in a long time

Yes, I remember and there is a reason I have this on my phone.

It's all about forgiveness, if you're too poor to afford an emoji you can use a like. It's all about giving what you can.
---
They had 1 web from the ares on the zarmazd for a little while.
---
I approve of Elo's post.
---
If you try to build things with low industry and produktion skills at NPC stations you can never compete with stuff that gets manufactured by guys in their null Sotiyo.
---
Playing the market sucks without money or necessary skills.
---
concerning WH relics: average seems to have gone down while exceptionally good cans are still as rare as before.
---
I use a nano helios with a hyperspacial rig, single T2 data coherence rig and a Zeugma. I switched to using a Stratios for a while because i was tired of being chased off sites by Asteros but i've found that i can't actually catch them as the Stratios they just run away. 
---
The loss of the speed of the Helios really hurt my ability to run sites quickly, 3.2km/s MWD as Helios vs 1.7km/s as Stratios plus 10AU/s warp vs 3AU/s as the Stratios made me go back to the Helios, plus its cheaper to replace and easier to import into null.
---
The only thing the Startios really had better was scaring off other explorers, the ability to face tank ghost sites. And no fear in sleeper caches.

BL and Horde wanna restart the campaign in Branch against GOTG and Winter Co.?

Eve is one of those odd games where hate seems to carry over into IRL so fast.
---
I don't know who this guy is, nor why he was banned (account sharing?), but the mocking of players leaving the game is kinda odd.  Same sort of shit happened with GigX got banned. Even tho he was the imperiums enemy, he brought content to 200+ people and their enemies (even if you considering getting shot at negative... its a part of the game). It doesn't excuse what he did, but any player leaving the game is kinda sad (more so if that person cascades multiple people leaving).
---
I reserve the right to change my mind when it comes to cheats and abusers :)
---
I'm assuming they don't Plex them, run them from vms/cloud instances and just train up Alphas in the background. 
---
I'm sure you could script updating 1000's of Alphas training ques easily. It's probably not something ccp is looking at.
---
That’s a great counter - exploration has become “too easy” - time to hunt explorers. Need to train into a t3c. 
---
omni tanked Tengu with HAML/HAM, still pretty good for them.

I'll send you bi-weekly updates with lists of [suspected FW bots](https://assets.epicurious.com/photos/5747a0285a5fbbae31ae4aeb/2:1/w_1260%2Ch_630/shutterstock_259774139.jpg) ingame.

Of sentinels and strings, I worry thus. It has been seen over the horizon and unto the desired folds that those who follow the seventh path of an Unknown Shape are unfit to rule within. Carry forth the light, O mercy mine own, and perish be the sun kissed bosom of thy daughters within the star filled night. Be gone from this realm and with you the era of forthcoming fire and the sages blessing of old . I now see the curse bestowed upon our kin many generations ago and by the fires of last evening moons, I bestow this message upon thy eyes. And unto all who gaze upon these letters be warned that everything that has been or has not been said forth hence shall be named as such being treasonous towards the ending vows of an unknown sound . Godspeed O reader mine, and safe passages to all who see this warning. For the road ahead is accursed and I too, soon shall be no more. Looking ahead, I spot an end to this mad forest. I look back and see the winding trail from whence I came . A voice compels me forward. A shape compels me to stay. A sound compels me hide. A message compels me to flee. Measure not the length of the course, rather the end of it. A path without end is a true path. The path which ends abruptly is no path, rather a way which leads one to their own end . Death need not concern us because when we exist death does not, and when death exists we do not. Yet death exists. So then, do we? But is one born in the end? Or in the beginning?
---
I am also recently back and I've been having good luck in Venal, although some days are totally dry, but others you can pull lots of money out. I have no idea about syndicate or outer ring, but I agree that it seems like there are more explorers than before. I've been pulling in \~1bil a week with maybe like 10 hours of work. So really not that great, but more interesting than running missions. I've just been running a covops too, but I keep thinking I should start running an astero for ganking other explorers, but the cloak delay time drives me nuts.
---
Yeah would be nice if there were combat dead spaces a bit like incursion space but with more limits, so if one corp fly's x ships of class 'a' second corp can send no more and no higher class. Would make for some great balanced fights.
---
oops :D
---
move to wormhole space... you don't get that 900mil bil.

Vast majority of security L4s can be easily and quickly done in cruisers. if you have autism or like slow ass shit then you use a battleship or marauder.
---
Gila is best bet, followed by almost any T3C except Proteus cuz that sucks too much ass now. if you go with a Gila you can also easily do Abyss which will give you tons better ISK, while if you pick a T3C then you can do all the "scanny" and "cloaky" shit in addition to the L4s.
---
Eventually, you'll have all, its just a matter of decision which you want to do 1st. I recommend the Gila before you get into T3Cs or battleships because its a good and solid "all-around" multi use ship that can handle various types of PvE content so you won't lock yourself down like you would if all you train for is a battleship or marauder. You need something to break the monotony.
---
In addition, in case you do decide to hop into a T1 cruiser and an empty clone and go welp it in PvP, cruisers will give you much better options then battleships, double this for starting players and Caldari / Gallente combination (both required for Gila) is actually pretty good for this, many options and ships to be welped in very fun ways.
---
Well yeah, obviously. Luckily you can easily get all of those perks by joining a corp. If you build in NPC stations and complain about margins, that's just retardation.
---
How would you "rebalance" t3ds, given the chance?
---
I don't want to answer that and give away exactly who I am in game if you don't mind.i have a lot of thoughts on that corp, it seemed like such a good idea to join but it was so disappointing in the end and then ended horribly for me. 
---
right click trash
---
hit yes on are u sure dialog
---
I think you’re greatly underestimating how many people play for the lore/story and PvE content related to that. I don’t have any numbers to back up my claim of course, but considering that what makes gaming headlines is “new 4000 player battle” and not “wow new amar princess person”, one could conclude that it is better for CCP to focus on null sec.
---
And with any gaming company, they are going after the big players. The ones that will drop 10k on plex without a second thought or have 250 accounts. Gaming companies love the whales, not the little guys.
---
I gave up on it soon after it didn't get updated after the T3C subsystem changes (yeah, that long ago).

https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/012/132/thatsthejoke.jpg
---
From the perspective of a long-term lore nerd and roleplayer, here's why this idea is both fantastic and highly tricky:
---
**You need to think about how a storyline is going to play out** two or even three years down the line. The "Empyrean War" - faction warfare - was supposed to be "the empires descending into open warfare", and indeed over the first year or so there were many follow-up events and storylines which reflected player accomplishments in the conflict. But after that period, the warzone settled into its familiar-back-and-forth swinging pattern of control - yet it grinds on for no apparent reason, making the whole concept something of a joke (some players have nicknamed it "the pendulum wars" for a reason).
---
Sansha's incursions face a similar issue. In that case, it wasn't "about too" - they *did* invade the Empires, there were some fantastic battles, and some fantastic lore additions were created (if you've ever run incursions, the NPC "Slave Heavenbound02" is actually a reference to a player character whose player agreed to be 'captured' and give the NPC its name). But then the attacks started to grind on, and here we are years later with no change. The mighty, looming threat of Sansha's Nation has once again become a farmable joke. Why? **Because storylines need to have an end.** And that's tricky when you tie that storyline to mechanics. 
---
Lore projects are also highly dependent on the people behind them. **Arek'jaalan**, a massive and largely player-driven project to explore the mysteries and mechanics of Wormhole space and the NPCs which inhabit it. Although players put in nearly all work responsible for the Arek'jaalan project, it ultimately hinged on the character of Hilen Tukoss (CCP Dropbear). When Dropbear left CCP, however, no one else was left to pick up the project and it ebbed away to nothing. More recently, the Amarr-aligned player community ran into a situation where lack of follow-up from NPCs dramatically changed the impact of an event and left us "sitting on our thumbs" while important things happened.
---
Lastly, you need to **make sure such events align with existing lore** on the topic. Things such as we see in the Prophecy trailer or the "Empires are losing control" tagline don't really mesh well with the actual lore on the topic (they came from the marketing department, not lore...) The Empires not only wield overwhelming military power compared to capsuleers but have us on a metaphorical leash: Using black-box control of our capsules to redacting things from our sensors, dictate when we can fire our weapons, and determining capsuleer usage of structures we built.
---
#tl;dr - 
---
Storyline-centric events are mountains of fun, and I hope this doesn't come off as me saying they don't work. If it did, read again - they've been some of the most fun I had in my time in Eve. But I must acknowledge they're profoundly tricky from a development standpoint, particularly because good storylines must end but any mechanic can become repetitive and grindy if perpetuated long enough.
---
One of the difficulties  getting people into wormhole space is too many corps require high sp, and those that don't are tiny.
---
There are a couple of good sized exceptions. Spoopy Newbeans (Part of Brave collective) and Shadow Flight (Who originated out of Pandemic Horde but are now independent).
---
Roll your static and find targets. 
---
&gt; Here is a kick in the nuts!
---
Welcome back! lol
---
And how many of those 4,000 players were being multiboxed by a single person? And lately I've seen login numbers upwards of 40,000, which suggests that up to 9/10 of the population doesn't necessarily play for the big fleet battles in Nullsec. That's a rather large majority and a significant pool of people to draw from who very well could be more interested in the love and story (therefore pve) than the PvP aspect. 
---
Perhaps CCP needs to do a poll?

What if they are a priority for CCP, but this is the best they can do?
---
Very very well said.

people still play bots online?

People.. bots = $$$ for CCP.

'Every account counts' - CCP motto.
---
With the Zeugma analyzer and the Blackglass implant you can skip pretty much all of the minigame other than click click click , loot. No need to worry about what you click on it. Goes super fast.
---
Folks ignore it because we've had so many hype trains and big build ups only to be dropped on our ass by an anticlimactic climax or nothing at all.
---
With all this "border conflict" stuff, I'm literally just waiting for it to go by the wayside.
---
Out of curiosity, are you memeing that the people in Delve are botting Rorqs or just botting in general? Rorqs are highly scalable for AFK carebearing and other than swapping rocks, I can't see why they would be more likely to bot than things like Supers.
---
Speak to Shadow Flight they do a 100 day training plan for their total newbean starters.
---
I see you are insane.
---
You kept doing the SAME THING, even when it didnt work. Next time, move your camera to look at a spot in space, DOUBLE CLICK IN SPACE TO WHERE YOU WANT TO GO. Atleast try that next time, instead of whining "omg im gonna die to a bug"
---
Stop using Approach. Also, it worked when you went to approach the battleship (LMAO WHY ARE YOU APPROACHING THAT BS IN A FRIGATE, Zero Transversal!)
---
I hope you learn to be a better pilot from this.
---
Yah and I watch a lot of them, do you? I've never seen proof in any of those streams that they roll holes if they aren't going into Delve.
---
Surely if this is all on stream, you'd have a clip to show us all, right?
---
Or not. There's plenty of people like me who check orders once every few minutes. The only way to drive out competition (other than crashing prices) is to undercut like a madman.
---
There are ingame "tricks" to check and change orders very quickly, which are not widely known. You easily check two dozen orders in 20 seconds, it's not difficult. 0.01 isking with the mouse wheel takes a second.
---
Our Logi pilot tried putting a Medium Ancillary Remote repper on the Rodiva for a Tourney style match... that might be something to check out on the zarmazd as well?
---
I would like to be Gobbins pet. He seems to me the sort of owner who gives you nice treats, let’s you sleep on the bed, and doesn’t yell too much if you piss on the carpet.

Oh, we’ve not really had a problem as most of us play around the same time, so I hadn’t really thought of that

I'm in a rorq in delve.  Come shoot me.  Oh wait
---
Ask him when the coke wears off and he realises what he has said

no because a blingy zarm with genos can sustain a ded self rep easily

Stick everyone in a fleet together get them all aligned neut pops in local click fleet warp.

Then should use their art department to help out.
---
Martyr Mar5hy t-shirts are coming out next week. I'm gonna make loads of money on this eve drama. Waaaay more than i'd make with my rorq bots! 
---
*Remote* Ancillary
---
There should not be any asset safety in the game. Stop your whining.
---
No VPN used
---
Pick something to sell that has a lot of volume/day, and a big enough investment required that you're not duking it out with casuals. Look for something that doesn't have huge numbers of orders that were updated in the last hour. Compare the number of orders that were updated in the last day to the daily sales for the item... if there are 10x as many units in orders updated daily as there are units selling in a day, that's a problem.
---
 
---
No VPN
---
So you dont come out for fleets ever and then bitch about the Corp? Kinda childish no? So next time for your future corp, get out of the hangar and get active. Eve is much more fun when you dont whine. I suggest you try it next time around.  
---
I multi box and pay cash for one year subs for my accounts. I do not support botting at all. Either for ratting, mining, or cloaky camping. It does piss me off when I lose excavators to a group of bombers that launches all his bombs at the exact same time and you know he is the owner of all the accounts. You report it and nothing app  happen but, how do you know if they do anything? Maybe they should make a corp called Botheim to put all the banned bots in after they are banned.
---
Which was very sad because TBH they were probably the best scam artist the game has ever seen
---
+1 very nice
---
It can sustain ded remote rep easily too
---
This, if it's a pirate faction if you have 2.5 standings to them or better, they will become neutral to your character and no longer engage. 
---
unbonused remote ancillary reps in addition to the bonused Mutadaptive Remote Armor Repairer? am i missing something?
---
I dont believe you are input broadcasting until it is proven. But you calling his harmless overlooks the simple fact he was input broadcasting and has suffered a ban for it. See past your own bias. 
---
russians arent people
---
The only detracting point that makes it a no-vote on my end is our habit of going AFK.
---
Hey can you push for tiericide to be finished? Getting all the useless trash out of the game will be nice. 
---
Yes. Essentially just an unbonused remote rep for extra repping (has short range though). Allows you to get reps on something like a tackle ship without breaking spool on let’s say your Flagshak
---
That’s not ironic.
---
you can tell he's not right in the head because he uses the new reddit stylesheet

---
Where were the input broadcasters in Gooons? Which channels. 
---
Pretty sure CCP Falcon doesn't have time to write lore anymore they've given him too many other responsibilities
---
Forgive my lack of knowledge but would an IP ban work here?  or rather a hardware ban?
---
Forcing them to buy a new computer for every VNI would rack up that price significantly. 
---
&gt; Yah and I watch a lot of them, do you?
---
yeah.
---
having a bot doesn't grant you market knowledge on how best to use it
---
as its unbonused its basicly useless. range is not viable in a 100mn scenario. waste of cap and fitting space. rep power is worthless.
---
Show us the proof then submit it to CCP. Until then you are just making arguments to support your case with words.  
---
Wormhole Society accepts newbies :) we ask people to be omega, able to fit covert ops cloak  and willing to learn.  That's it.
---
doesn't matter who designed what.
---
they literally stream themselves sitting in a wormhole doing fuck all until magically the only thing they find is in the south. 
---
Yeah that's what the game needs. More Goons.
---
I will only vote if you go to Eve Toronto.
---
Now ban all of the CODE. input broadcasters with 25+ accounts. 
---
Zap through them quickly in a Dominix Navy or a Kronos. 
---
wtf is this the DEA 
---
He has nearly as many reddit accounts as eve accounts.
---
I work from home and check orders very often. Your best is to sell now or sell in Amarr.
---
I know. As you can read at the bottom of the Imgur album, it has a lot of flaws. 
---
If you're talking about it's position on the base, that's by design though.
---
Not every fit is 100mn though - the fit of my zarmazd is dual-prop
---
All of Oasa has bots, but if you bother them enough, you can occasionally get the owners to undock
---
I too would like to see local removed.
---
Not if they are using VMs. You can also just spoof an IP. 
---
The only real solution is to ban them all and then remove skill injectors. 
---
yes, don´t do drugs kids
---
Goon bots: 1
---
Marshy input broadcasting: 0
---
Honestly though. We live in the age of artificial intelligence where bots are passing Turing tests left and right and everybody acts like CCP is intentionally ignoring the botting problem.
---
"Just ban them all it's easy!"
---
ok than its just a waste of cap and fitting space for little to no rep power increase
---
Because of the boosher menace
---
In the majority of the time you are watching bombers idling in the wormhole they are actually hunting in nullsec you idiot.
---
Too much INN brainwashing causes you to see what you wanna see on these streams.
---
I think you read what I said wrong. 4,000 people in the largest null sec battle doesnt mean there are a maximum of 4,000 people in null sec. Not everyone in null just magically warps to the same system when a big battle happens. 
---
Truth is, most people don’t play eve for the lore/story. It’s just not that kind of game. Look at other MMOs; OSRS and WoW. Sure, there’s questing and stuff, but most people are just grinding to play the game, not really focusing on the story much.
---
You’re very much in the minority, sorry bud.
---
Many things have been said about Goons.. and I assure you that 'above board' isn't one of them.
---
i tested your post for salt.

have a extra reg rep on mine... works for repping the drones, or a quick top off of a friendly nerd when main dps is elsewhere, would not trade it for anything
---
This post is too good to appreciated on reddit.
---
It's not a delusion if they're literally streaming it, mate.
---
You were kicked from Horde for reporting Horde botters?
---
Your mistake was not simply reporting them to CCP with the in-game tool.  Never hesitate to do this if you suspect a bot. There's no valid reason not to.
---
That said, sounds like whoever kicked you has reasons to protect botters....🤔
---
Can I have it?
---
lets go baby moa fleets begin in march :thumbsup:
---
is there a way to check whats in the wrapped asset saftey?
---
cause i got like 24 of them. half of which i'm pretty sure are probably either newbie ships, ammo, or left over ore long forgotten
---
"Everyone disagrees with me, therefore everyone is mistaken"
---
That's fine, do it with as many items as you can and just wait for that station to be worth visiting. 
---
I doubt the bots for farming in a niche MMO are quite that sophisticated, honestly. Still, it's not an easy problem.
---
No because they’re both trivial to work around if you’re committed without buying a new pc or getting a new IP.
---
I think Strategy or Sourcing possibly.
---
I realized the IP wouldn't work after typed it, but can you get around a MAC ban with a VM?  
---
I still dont see any proof other than you claiming to have been in goons for 2 weeks and SEEEEEING these supposed bots 
---
Show screenshots of the transactions. You can blur all the numbers except the numbers of real money to isk. Let's see some proof.

Why not Sort Dragon? Cuz BL and Horde failed to take Branch from GOTG? 
---
How dare you spill classified information!
---
I do...and I'm telling you...if you're talking about JonnyUK streams specifically, **I've never once seen them roll a hole just because it's not leading to Delve.**
---
A large large majority of the time, you can't see the hole or any of the rolling on the stream anyways so I'd love to know when you saw that happen, and what was said?
---
So without proof, you're not really adding that much to the thread other than "Grrrr BB", just to confirm.
---
PL and NC run botting empires plz ban
---
How about a new GM corp that doesn’t show in local with instapwn jove Powers. Call them Bottysmackers. Btw if someone starts Bottysmackers corp I want in. ;p
---
Well, we don’t have to worry as much in Delve since Mar5hy got banned
---
You sir have founded a whole new source of gaming income!
---
Can we please have an AMA on this.
---
I think biggest downside of zarmazd is relatively weak RR power (mutadaptive RR which starts at mere 210 rr/s, RR drones take time to travel), so covering it a little w/o sacrificing other stats much makes sense. It has enough tank to brawl into ship it's repping in many fights. Similar to its RR drones, it is conditional, but +70 RR/s is +70 RR/s.
---
Good info, bad delivery. rote kapelle / 10

You made the jump and I followed you not too long after....thank you man prolly woulda quit Eve too 
---
This cracks me up, but more believable than amrastion

Hell you could fit an entire cap in compressed ore  pretty sure

The correct answer is delete all the ones that aren't hecate.

I think the HK eviction showed that too. A lot of people jumping up to go help and banding together was really cool to see. Space bushido is real
---
GoonStellar Management 
---
Wait you can have more than one reddit account? 
---
How the fuck retarded do you have to be to run a bot to munch on rocks?
---
B-B-But thats hay...
---
I unno. 
---
you don't need to see what holes they roll - just look where they end up.
---
almost every time it's delve, or as he puts it 'Jurassic park', or another region in the south.
---
yes - i've seen them end up in other places and i can count those on one hand, if you chopped off most of my fingers. the amount of times they end up in the south vs anywhere else is massively disproportionate even given the population density of the south. the inhabitants of the south don't struggle to find content in the north, so why do BB seemingly struggle to do so?
---
Found the botter
---
They need to remove cargo-scanning in hacking sites. This will force completion and despawn sites.
---
&gt;Posting ban #s even though the bots are up and running 30 minutes later.
---
It's almost like we said this would happen when skill injectors were announced. Punishing bots is nearly pointless when they can just spin up a new one in 20 minutes.
---
Even VNIs used to be a few weeks of training before they were useful for afk ratting. Now a VNI alt is barely an investment.
---
He already bought a year of Reddit Premium dude. He's committed. 
---
Yes, open the full Inventory window, by your Plex vault tab, there should be another for the Asset Safety where you can view the contents of the Wraps.
---
Leave my RMT empire alone.
---
Saw you last night.  Docked up my Ishtar (manually).  I don't know how you know they're bots.  Same origin structure (duh), undocking at the same time and having the same fit is probably not that unusual for alts.
---
For me it's something like not responding but then that could be a language problem so even then not clear cut.
---
I'm not sure if this is a meme and at this point I really couldn't care less.  I've never actually voted in this silly thing but if you're putting your name forward ur getting my vote, meme or not.
---
Down Fido!  My complaint is with how its implemented not costs or whether it should be there to begin with.
---
bring back old magnetometrics

You can use an esi tool to see what assets are wrapped up, but in game without visiting the station there is no way to tell.
---
They should have just sent him to the chinese botter internment camps.

You'd be better off training into a Sabre and bubbling up explorer bots. It's cheaper, and you should be isk positive after 1 Astero kill.

---
No man, thats the plan. Vote for the flakiest candidates so that they all drop out. Burn the CSM down and start anew. 
---
They're sophisticated enough that the processing power used to discriminate them from human users would be massive. No these bots can't pass a Turing test but they are remarkably camoflauged when compared with a human's inputs into the server
---
Poors wanna downvote, but F2P is whats fucking it up more than injectors. Farm ISK with zero investment, creating more inflation.
---
You watch the stream. Bombers are waiting on the citadel. You think they are rolling until Delve. While they are actually hunting in non-Delve. Classic delusion.
---
Yeah, but he'll be back. Enjoy the temporay reprieve. I know i am.

You'd think in the many months he's been active this time that you all would have had time to come up with a greater variety of jabs than just regurgitating this.  I'd guess a good majority of the active playerbase has been active at one point, gone afk, and then returned.  The only reason Elo's afk stints are of note is that he contributes to the community _such that his absence is actually impactful._  
---
If something happened to you IRL and you didn't loggin for 6 months would anyone really notice?
---
I don't believe there are botting Rorqs in Delve.  I mean if there are, please show evidence.  It's just the stupidest idea I've ever heard.  It's more or less passive.  You can fire up TACO to see if booshers are nearby and pull drones.  The only reason you could possible have for botting it would be because you want to earn whilst you're at work.  Well, is there a bot that knows the Ocre rule, that joins JU standing and speaks up on coms when you're tackled?
---
Either botting Rorqs are a thing in Delve and they die frequently, which is a very expensive way of earning, or they aren't and you're mistaking bots for being passive/AFK.
---

&gt; You can also just spoof an IP. 
---
please don't use words you don't understand
---
The static's matter more than you think, so rule out the C3 completely because it doesn't lead to W-space. 
---
C2 groups are typically pvp-driven, though I don't think many groups would turn down a good scanner.
---
I would personally recommend a C4 as it gives some good variety and endless scanning, but you won't be able to run sites in a Stratios. Not even close. You'd need a rattlesnake or a group of people with logi. 
---
I think even C2 sites would kill a Stratios.
---
&gt; You watch the stream
---
i do. that's the entire point - they don't even hide the fact that they almost never end up outside of the south.
---
Of course I don't believe there's only 4,000 people in the majority of Nullsec. I've been around for 7yrs, now, I know how big Nullsec is. And plenty of them prefer to rat and run escalations in their free time. And a significant number of "Nullsec" Corp/alliance members live outside of Nullsec.
---
That being said, 4,000 characters in a single battle does not automatically mean that PvPers are the absolute overwhelming majority. Even if it's a 2:1 ratio of PvPers to PvEers, that's still a large part of the player base that is being neglected and heightens the probability of those players deciding not to stick around.
---
Constantly Kowtowing and pandering to Nullsec does nothing to benefit the game as a whole. I really don't get why you're arguing against something that literally does nothing but benefit the game. To each their own, I suppose.
---
You came to Delve and promptly went back to playing Fortnite after you were BFG'd and gatecamped. You left the moment that it required effort to continue to get kills and now you're chestbeating on reddit about how elite you are. 
---
Barghest is bae
---
I haven't been out to null in a couple weeks, but have been hopping through wormholes looking for sites. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. No idea what's going on.
---
Does this favor bots too, or would it make no difference to remove these?
---
What type of industry are you planning to be doing? To do mining and T1 production solo (even with some alts) is much easier in hi-sec, as the moons in WH are same and you don't have to actually run Athanor by yourself, you could use the public ones.   
---
For the rest I can offer you to join my corp, I am solo atm as well, but definitely would not mind some company. I have been in C2 for some time and have just moved to C4. I am mostly farming blue doughnuts, have C3 static for relics, and also have everything to start doing reactions.
---
You are also more than welcome to drop your structures around. i have Athanor with reactions, could put Moon Drill if there would be enough interest/company to run mining fleets. Am about to drop Astrahus that I was running in C2 - it just unanchored last night. 
---
You realize that you are part of the problem right? You farm noob frigates 1 jump out of a novice system with a Super Carrier.

---
There's a big difference between baseless and vague assertions of input broadcasting within entire alliances, and very clear evidence based accusations of input broadcasting tied to an individual.  While it's clear that botting and input broadcasting are more or less rampant in the more _"relevant"_ entities in eve, there are still many of us that have made a commitment to making isk through avenues not against the EULA, as these are generally better for both CCP and for the health of the game. 
---
You're not being victimized by gons because they're smarmy hypocritical sperglords.  You're getting memed by pretty much the whole community (smarmy hypocritical gons included) because you done fucked up son.

Although, I did (re)learn what a Sabre is, cloak+mwd, and to drop off loot occasionally.

Thanks for the response! 
---
In regards to sites, while I can technically fly battleships, I wouldn't be able to properly fit them. Can I fly battlecruisers, including the t2 varieties. Would a hurricane, or the fleet issue cane be any good for running sites in c2? 
---
And a follow up on the moving in part: Should I be looking for uninhabited systems? is that reasonable? How should I deal with any current occupants should I find them? 
---
is this still active :P

Probably because he's been on the concil already (maybe twice) and hasn't affected any decent changes

It’s possible to be both the best scam artist the game has ever seen and a dangerous, malignant sociopath at the same time.

They could still just take the high-ISK and leave the carbon. Maybe take it a step further and cans/site explode/despawn after can being opened?

I love how he downvoted the post that exposed him. lol.
---
Tiericide is indeed a big project. One that one of the current CSM (Brisc Rubal) was not even aware existed. 
---
I look forwarding to tiericide completion
---
You can run c2 sites in a well fit jackdaw, easily in a battlecruiser, myrmidons are really good, easy and cheap, or a praxis. Or whatever, c2s are super easy.
---
It's pretty rare to find an uninhabited system nowadays. If you find a hole you like you can try to evict the residents, but if its full power structures you're gonna have a hard time solo.
---
You can not spoof an IP over TCP. They can (and do) use VPN to change their IP address.
---
I'm kind of flattered that TEST is supposed to have this much influence with CCP now.
---
Also if you can provide solid evidence of botting take it to Dran Arcana and we'll kick some nerds.
---
NB: VNIs warping to citadels when you enter system is not solid evidence of botting.
---
If you AFK on the CSM your spot is changed to another person. 
---
I will not be going afk, though.
---
NBA 2k sucks mate, madden is far superior. Plus Madden 19 is on the PC now, woohoo
---
CCP has big responsibilities, although botters also could drink bleach ingame.
---
Nice. Thanks.
---
Appreciate the headsup, I'm on it.
---
Are you botting? If not, keep up the great work for your alliance. 
---
Why not just day trip into wormhole space? Having structures to maintain and statics to roll will eat into that limited free time. 
---
A strat could run C2's but the isk per hour is low. If you're dead set on living in w-space I would look for a C4 with a C3/C2 static. Rat in the C2 (myrmidon works great) until you can fit a rattle and rat in the C3. It's normally safer to rat in a C3 (one static) and far better isk per hour.
---
ok funny can we stop with marshy posts now

Feel free to send me the information ingame and I will work on it.

i don't need saving; i don't care where BB drop. i just find it hilarious that they pretend to be neutral and make no effort to hide how lop sided their destinations are.
---
I think a better solution would instead of banning the bots CCP should either A.) reduce mining amounts by 99% or B.) reduce ratting bounties by 99% - this way the bots would continue until they actually noticed the decrease which I imagine would be much slower than the realization of a ban.
---
I like how every anti-botting post ends up being a 'make ganking easier' post.
---
No not botting.  And fair enough
---
not really
---
injectors make it possible to instantly make a new VNI bot after your last set get memed
---
F2P or not it would still take weeks or months to make a profitable bot (other than stuff like distribution bots which apparently exist now wewlad)

The farm animals can't stop licking the salt block.

Maybe for starters they can start looking at the characters reported as bots. So far it has only been a waste of my time to report them.

He's just a nolife incel.

This is a terrible post
---
CCP was forced to do this by the Paris Climate Accord. Goon tears were causing sea levels to rise.
---

---
I blame the people who can't understand that blocking what the bots do *right now* doesn't actually stop botting.  It just gets the bot author more money because his customers have to buy a new version.
---
hopefully this post doesn't get lost in the noise, this is dead on. 
---
Do you have a source for that or are you just making it up, because really the behavior i have seen doesn't lead me to believe there very clever and mostly operate as a state machine that responds to like 3/4 variables.

The booster you got for Christmas it gives you 75% standing gains which also translates into 105% decrease to standing loss to decline missions with max skill. This enables you to just decline every non burner mission from level 4's and to decline any non good level 5 mission, allowing you to only target missions that drop faction.

Level 4's are reportedly pushing 600 mil phr and level 5's are netting people &gt;1bn phr.

It's pretty easy to find info on them if you look around. And you'd be surprised how many humans act like state machines when they multibox.

---
Actually the bots got kicked. :))
---
Elo: I will Help CCP fight Bots.
---
r/eve: How? If you have botting info you should be giving it to CCP now not holding it hostage to get on the CSM. If its not info how will you be able to "Help" when you are neither able to effect the code to make it harder for Bots to be used or change the mind of people already using bots. As these are the only 2 ways to battle bots .
---
Elo:  I'll give input onto the ships and modules balance of the game.
---
r/eve: Wow the bare minimum the required to be a CSM member. Dont set the bar too high for yourself. 
---
Elo: I'll work with CCP infrastructure team to help combat lag and improve the QOL of larger fleet fights and moving fleets.
---
r/eve: Again, how? What changes are you aware of that the coders working on the game are not. If you have some immense coder knowledge you should have CCP hire you instead of trying to scam a month on the CSM before being ousted for lack of activity.
---
Elo: I'm begging you please vote for me, dont vote for Brisc who has reached out to High Sec, Low Sec, Null and J-Space people well outside "his" experience of the game to give a voice to them as they are also Eve Players, he doesn't represent the Larger Fleet fight blocs that I'm appealing to and that 100% what the CSM needs. More TiDi generating NullSec FC's on the CSM. And again I'm so desperate to get this gig I'm begging you to not vote for **Sort Dragon!**

Well, there are screenshots of discord where he offered to "share" his characters.  Guess he's going for another ban.
---
Hey Elo, last week when local was bricked as well as all the other chats, a group of TEST members I was with tackled a botting Hel that night in Period Basis. 
---
Everyday he logs in at around 04:00 EVE Time and bot ends at around 17:00 EVE Time. After this Hel died, I went to the system only to see him doing the same fucking thing in a Thanatos. After tackling him one time to see what he would do, he did the same thing he did in his Hel. However I wasn't able to get some friends on to tackle since it just wasn't worth it due to the high presence of people in local. 
---
Here's the pilot's KM from the Hel: https://zkillboard.com/kill/74563477/
---
Please, if you are serious about ending or atleast putting a massive hole in botters and their income, then you got my vote and a bunch of other TESTies that hate bots just as much as we do.
---
C'mon, work the shaft.

There's a lot of talk of the Hecate hunting fit here. The shield hyperspatial fit is good for covering a lot ground but it's thin on tank and doesn't cover the hull weaknesses as well. If you don't have a lot of time to play but want to get into null and try to poke people into chasing you around it excels. Your engagement profile is very limited though. Stiff arm scram/web and any capwarfare is usually the end for you. To kill a VNI you end up keeping the MWD lit making you an easy target for site DPS and drones. Learn to know when to bail if you're taking too much.
---
Take the shield fit and trade hyperspatials for core defense rigs. That's a fun ship with more staying power but again you need to know your engagement profile. If I have the time I'd roam in this over hyperspatials any day.
---
Pilot name is Caldari Joans if you want to see fits and what I typically go for.
---
MAC addresses only default to the address burned into the hardware.  You can set it manually to anything you want.
---
(And that's assuming they're using physical machines instead of VMs)
---
Join the "Fits for L4 missions" chat channel. It has links to fits you can probably use, or easily train into.
---
also I didn't add this in the post; When I say "same thing as he did in the Hel", I mean he kept launching and immediately recalling his fighters. Also never yellowboxed me once.

What's the opposite of giving someone gold?

Elo is John Wick. Comes out of retirement, kills 1,000 dudes in a week. Goes back to retirement. You just can’t compete with John Wick. He’d literally kill everyone in Eve if he stayed too long. 
---
I'm just concerned for the future of your great alliance. If an AFK has been who doesn't even play EVE anymore has almost as many kills in January as your 100th dude, it doesn't bode well. 
---
You COULD not get your shit at all, it could just be trapped in a station like it was for years.
---
Like holy shit you get this sweet 'gimmie' added to the game and you cry like a bitch because its not enough?

Eat shit.

---
Asset safety is better than the alternative, in which you'd come back to no assets at all.
---
Fucking test. 
---
but has he actually achieved anything other than padding his killboard?
---
well when you abuse FCON too much...just like any other resource they do deplete.   So now your really just saying you helped kill an alliance off that was good content.
---
Ah yes, a stat indicating a month's activity surely demonstrates that he remains active... for more than a month.
---
I wish mittens would give me the whip uwu

I crave you getting a Boson to the head irl so we don't have to read any of your smug """reveleations""" about the economy

Gobbins has long been very supportive of streamers getting fights that aren't supercaps dropped on them from what BB has said on his stream or maybe it was Zarvox
---
Begging people to not vote for Brisc or Sort... Your self esteem seems to be lacking a bit. 
---
Doesn't seem to be a hindrance to most members of the CSM for the past few years.
---
I can't tell whether this is still a shitpost or if it's gone right around the circle and ended up being a genuine attempt to deal with botting.
---
Because he was caught redhanded cheating.  We also had no problems with goon folks being banned for the same offense.  The difference is in what everyone else has done.  When a goon is caught input broadcasting via chat, goons, along with everyone else, condemned them.  This time, it was goons condemning Mar5hy, whilst most everyone else attempted to downplay it.  That is the big difference.
---
It\*'s an infinipoint, yeah. But I think it's a point not an infiniscram.

\*: talking about the citadel no-warp effect when you engage it, since the post I was replying to got deleted

Uh, I only do that in the MER threads. You could, y'know, not read them? How the heck is cybereconbullying real?

Even more proof that this is Evertrader is that he's posting from the false POV of an Evictus member, just as he did with /u/concernedeve.

people realize the theft/disbanding/quitting shit was a joke right

There's so many lessons from real world markets. The other obvious one is the pip size - you shouldn't be able to 0.01 ISK a million ISK item, the minimum adjustment size should be maybe 100 ISK on a price like that.
---
"cybereconbullying" if only you were as good at posting as you are at making up words
---
Yeah just the worst, I hear their ceo is a massive asshole, always afk except when he shows up to yell at people.
---
You've willfully demonstrated numerous times you don't understand the mechanics around the Armada fleets.
---
Two possibilities. You're incapable of understanding what's been explained to you or you understand all too well and are willfully misrepresenting how the mechanics work to align with a narrative.
---
TL;DR You don't understand or you're strawmanning.

Gotta make more room for spod, I guess.

Assuming you're not trolling I only have two questions. 
---
1. Given you're one of the most notable 'do some stuff then quit' people in the game, why would this be any different?
---
2. Whats your view on wormholes?
---
Good luck, I guess :)
---
Honey Detected 
---
Probably the (new) players took our "explore instead of mining" advice so there are more people exploring and even if you find something to sell it will worth less.

I wanted to live in WH space more than anything for a change in pace and to experiance that side of the game. Right now I do just day trip into w-space, both to explore and as highways out to null sec.

As desirable as it is to go solo (shoutout to #BringingSoloBack) to be effective in a wormhole you should probably join a corp. There are an absolute ton of C3/C4 corps that are looking for independent scanners, and if you find one that isn't too active then you can run all the sites in the chain\* and do your thing solo.
---
\*= Meaning C2/C3 relic and data sites with no rats. Some have rats. Use the link below for everything wormhole PVE.

Didn't test just tuck their tail and run, complete with villy taking the keys to the deployment away from pgl?
---
glass houses, ningen
---
Yes unless you left everything in a POS or a wormhole citadel in which case you should have been ready or lose it anyway.
---
Idk if you spend much (or any) time on this sub or in this game but goons are rly fuckin stupid 
---
You have to remember, the average Goon has enough brainpower to light a 1-watt bulb, and that's without having to walk at the same time.
---
that´s kinda one step below highsec
---
You can't spoof an IP with anything that requires 2-way communication, TCP or otherwise.
---
You are almost self-aware Dave, keep it up buddy.
---
Just to give CCP credit here, they never actually lost their rolling capability. The Zero-Point Mass Entangler was added in the same patch that removed the mass reduction on the bubble generators.
---
cant find you on discord but id like to know your fit!
---
it has nothing to do with the fleets.
---
going to the same place time after time is the very opposite of being neutral.
---
What's TACO?
---
Mfw you literally cite the only part of Esoteria not owned by Test when claiming we have rampant bots. If you have any info on bots in Test or LBFB hit me up.
---
Querns is a self identified video game developer.
---
Suffice to say he has zero irl prospects

Isn't that just called buying ISK?
---
I mean, maybe. But can someone find a post about Gaara being banned and Goons being as chipper about it as they are about Marshy being banned?
---
fucked if i know, i pay minimal attention to test - last i heard he was deployed in delve and i didn't see them doing anything at all.
---
I've reported people talking in local about bottling and how they do it to have isk to do stuff with after work.
---
That account is still active as far as I know
---
10-4, Thanks
---
Where exactly are these Test bots? I take great pride in hunting down, blacklisting, kicking, and reporting any bots I can find in Test, so if you know of any, let me know.
---
Hey, those are more useful stats than OP provided.
---
&gt;people realize the theft/disbanding/quitting shit was a joke right
---
Joke and/or just the latest addition to the pile of BL white noise posting, yeah.
---
guessing since you went with some kind of insult rather than an achievement of his, the answer to my question is 'no'.
---
Ouch
---
Fuck, this really saddens me. And I did not even know until now. He joined us when he moved to J-space back in 2012 I think.
---
Then ran into him ingame early last year in a random lowsec system. He instantly remembered and had some nice words for me. Fuck. Fly safe. I am glad he enjoyed the game and made friends doing so
---
they went to delve for some whaling, got some frags, moved back north when tests invasion officially started, got some frags. People really don't get that BL is in this for the content, and I think eve is worse for a huge chunk of the player base not being able to grasp that any more.
---
Oh? Interesting. Perhaps I stopped playing when the patch notes about them being removed were just coming out and I hadn't heard anything about the script. Apologies.
---
ShitStainGuy
---
No, it is called Pilot's License Extension. 
---
ITT I learned goons are the standard to which we measure the elite pvp alliance that is Black Legion. That seems totally reasonable....
---
It was a compliment Dave, but it seems you can't realize that. Why don't you stop reddit for a little bit and get back to being flavorless nullsec line member #281023
---
&gt;You COULD not get your shit at all, it could just be trapped in a station like it was for years.
---
That sounds fun.
---
You can get around hardware IDs *without* a VM, with VMs it's trivial
---
The only thing HWID bans work against is aimbot kids in shooter games
---
It's fair enough since it's pretty open and shut that he was broadcasting, and almost certainly he used that for other things.
---
You do wonder if CCP are investigating the vast number of 23/7 ratting accounts with the same zeal though.
---
"Beg you not to vote for Brisc Rubal Beg you not to vote for Sort Dragon" excellent talking points sir, you have my vote!
---
Also the guy saying it's a script is wrong, it's a seperate module you have to buy, but it has the same skill requirements and can only be fit to hics.
---
Botters with first time offense only gets banned for a few days don't they? afterwards they get extracted or sold. 
---
Maybe you should pyfa it and put another armor mod on and see for yourself

The bigger problem in my eyes is how much alpha clones can do right now. A lot of the bots would be useless if alphas couldn't warp to anoms or if there were any other kind of pve restrictions.
---
"free isk" lol. You sure enjoy talking good of an extremely toxic individual holding people's ingame things for ransom (via scams etc.) to harass them out of game. That's literally what it was; out of game harassment with the game as a tool, for his personal enjoyment.
---
Goons used to be good badposters. Now they are just shit posters. 
---
nah that's just one job i had for about three years
---
No, you don't have to up the rewards. The rewards are already balanced for the amount of effort it is to clear the sites. They are not balanced for AFKing the sites and that's why the economy is broken with a huge ISK surplus.
---
Same thing
---
&gt;I crave you getting a Boson to the head irl
---
ig ofc
---
I'll vote for you because you personally tackled me once ahead of your fleet and that's the most interaction I've had with any candidate other than Jintaan.
---
In my opinion Sort and Brisc did much more than other CSMs who are not worried about re-election 
---
&gt;it has nothing to do with the fleets.
---
&gt;You've willfully demonstrated numerous times you don't understand the mechanics around the Armada fleets.
---
It has everything to do with the mechanics of the Armada fleets. At this point you're doubling down on stupidity.
---
I can't stand u/Olmeca_gold and what he did to CAS and BB. But I'm forced to agree with him here.
---
Just curious, why are you specifically targeting delve bots?
---
Found the internet hardguy shouting from behind the safety of his master’s army.
---
No characters are deleted, ever. You are still there. Your stuff should also still be there if not in a POS.. that was probably shot down a long time ago.
---
go back? i already am that's why i'm posting.
---
fuck all else to do while half arsing fleets.
---
Nah
---
Not wanting to be rude, but you really should think a few minutes before committing Ideas to the permenance of the internet.
---
It’s one thing to say something and it’s quickly forgotten, but people can look back at this in twenty years and wonder just what the f*ck you were thinking.
---
That's the joke!
---
Yeah but Spod kills are a much more important metric than player kills these days.
---
carry that water
---
Yeah bots don't really make sense. I could see input broadcasting for those with a large number that need to recall drones quickly, but it seems like it would be mostly pointless to use a bot on something as afk as rorq mining.
---
"they always go to the same place, that's not being neutral" 
---
"but muh fleet idea"
---
no dude. stop it. they go to the same place because they want to - which is fine, just stop pretending that it's not by design.
---
&gt;Can't deal with your problems in game? Deal with them by yelling the loudest. Congrats for another metagame win for Goons
---
*Project* much?
---
&gt;Meanwhile, tens of Delve Rorquals save hundreds of Excavators each month via broadcasting the scoop command
---
Since you're so fond of asking for it - you got proof? Or is this just anti-goon speculation? hahaha
---
&gt;Maybe we are expected to send a mail to the security team. I asked a GM, even he wasn't sure. I sent mails with no answer. Broadcasters I reported continued their activities with no penalty.
---
lol "CCP investigated them and found nothing wrong but I know better!!!!! reeeee!"
---
&gt;So the game lost one of his best content creators for 30 days or more, just because he happened to be a Goon rival and banning standards apply to only to such people
---
Remember when those goon supers were teleported and killed for botting? Pepperidge farm does, so does reddit, but salty anti-goons don't lol
---
At least I undock and fight.  
---
It's really not a big deal; I shouldn't have used "cry" in my post. I play, I leave, I play I leave. If in fact everything is gone, there won't be another "play" cycle.

Proving more evidence you don't understand how Armada fleets work. Let alone wormhole mechanics.
---
Quality stuff compared to a lot of the other Eve news things I've seen, thanks!
---
It takes time to travel between cans.  There is ample time to lock a can before reaching 6km range for module activation.
---
I have always been impressed with CCP’s customer service. I haven’t always got what I wanted, but even then they were polite respectful, and efficient.
---
I am sure not everyone has the same experience, but in mine, I am certainly happy.
---
Of course every botter and RMT trader WOULD disagree wouldn’t they? 
---
It’s Best not to believe every complaint we see on Reddit.
---
i downvoted him for being boring
---
i don't think i have the right kind of diet to cause permanent jizz stains unfortunately
---
Shame 
---
I love the taste of Mar5hy salt in the morning
---
Spectre Fleet, Low sec clone soldier ratting/pvp, and abyss are all good low time commitment and low sp requirement options.
---
i know exactly how wormholes work, i lived in one longer than i've lived anywhere else outside of high sec.
---
not that the mechanics make a shit of difference to my point. it's not like it's that big of a deal to just say "fuck it, we're gonna go here and go here lots".
---
When the Devblog states a cost is 15% and what you get is 30%, that's implementation issue.  I don't care what the cost is, my point, its confusing.  
---
i never seem to have an issue with it.
---
This
---
hmmm, scarily accurate.
---
good luck sneaking anywhere without a cloak.
---
1 Input broadcasting was the reason for the ban, not brigading by Goons. 2 affiliation to Goons doesn't avoid bans. 
---
Mar5hy needs to take a look at himself and stop blaming others. He broke the EULA.
---
Yeah, you won’t catch too many players by just camping in a sabre. But people will occasionally mess up or get distracted irl, and it’s unlikely that bots are any good at dodging camps. 
---
&gt;  had some better footage but lost it
---
Can you at least give us the footage you were supposed to post?
---
Good lord, the issues are with the implementation being confusing.  The community doesn't want Asset Safety and the Devs buy-in I could care less.
---
Yes. Unfortunately CCP buckled under the pressure of WH tears. I think CCP shouldn't have caved and just told WHers to use porpoises to roll just like our WH CSM suggested.
---
that´s because you got to much time on your hands while pressing f(1) once in a while 
---
I know you love this game Elo, and god knows we need someone to wave the flag - but is it really worth the personal cost to try and push shit uphill? The above personal dig is exactly the sort of toxic shit that makes me think we’d all be better off to let this game die in a fire. No matter what good you try and do you’ll be hated by some part of eve’s players, and I can’t help thinking the CSM is just a dead relic and the best way to improve the game is focus your energy on not burning out trying to solve all the things, and continue to do what you do best. And please get a good Euro fleet going in BL so I can throw dictors into the burning fire of your infectious enthusiasm. If you run I’d vote for you, but think of your health + sanity Space John Wick ;p

The general opinion seems to be that with the advice to the braver new players to try exploring, and the tales of masses of exploration bots, that not only is space picked clean, but the value of loot has been depressed due to more on the market.
---
Data sites have been poor as well for quite a while.
---
It would be worthwhile to have an exploration bot purge, and for CCP to look at the drop table as well. 
---
fwiw i've worked at ccp since may 2006 and i've never been more optimistic about ccp's commitment to dealing with the botting problem. we know we have a problem and we are committed to doing something about it. 
---
Or I could write the post in crayon for everyone because my complaints are not about costs or what I should/should not get back from asset safety.  T
---
his whole post is the implementation being confusing for a returning player.
---
check out a wormlife freeport this maybe the answer your looking for 
---
What do you plan to propose about exploration bots emptying out entire regions? Both nullsec and wormholes are largely picked clean these days.
---
Yeah, I mean, it's nice to make EVE F2P when you can't use the main aspect of the game, like warping to anoms and shit.
---
Jesus christ do you actually use your brain cells sometime ? 
---
lol, no it doesn't.
---
  I see you are too dumb to double click in space 
---
thats right, all botting temp bans come with the transfer / extraction lock on all accounts - not just the offending one(s).. we slap all your accounts, and if you've been logging into your buddys accounts as well he might get punished for what you did... 
---
i'm not happy to see the constant negative feedback coming from our community, but i am happy that you are voicing your concerns, and i urge you to keep that up. change will come. down w/ the bots. 
---
Yes, and it can be very lucrative. But you need to have less of a sneaking attitude and more of a strike hard and strike fast attitude. 
---
Without a cloak you might as well be broadcasting your presence. So assume someone is watching you and get about your business quick. find your relic sites cargo scan the cans hack the best ones and get out as fast as you can cus your a sitting duck.
---
You can make a lot of isk this way, i tested it myself recently. With minimal training (even using only the SP from a referral) you can fit up a T1 exploration frig for 600k-1m and bring back 50m+ from a trip if you play your cards right. And no big deal if you lose it, you bring back one big load and you can afford a dozen such frigs.
---
Remember that the d scan is your best friend. 
---
Just make sure you don't murder PvE for the sake of the few morons that want to have their elite PvP content of farming VNIs. 
---
I’m sure the 24 DPS you did being 964th on the killmail really tipped the balance of the fight. 
---
negative. using the in-game button is great. please keep doing it. i understand there is no feedback going out to you guys so it seems worthless, i can't solve that myself, but i know it's an issue. 
---
Or just make it so the site despawns faster after the first can is hacked. I think it's an hour at the moment, but a partially hacked site is useless - make that timer 15 minutes.
---
Hey, CCP Hellmar (CEO of CCP) actually wrote the in-game market code. Maybe you can tweet @ him for info.. :P 
---
"council estate"?
---
What does that mean?
---
Do yourself a favor and spend minimum 6 months in a wormhole corp and you'll learn everything. Is it viable yes but ymir you give yourself a couple months you'll make your life so much easier. Some corps even encourage you to have your own "bearhole" to do pve content in and with that if a group tries to fight you you can bring your friends
---
Exploration is one of the most lucrative things for low skill players to do - and in nullsec, about the only source of income until you skill into a VNI. So all the nullblocs that have been hoovering up new players have to tell them to explore, saturating nullsec.
---
You can still get a decent income from wormhole daytripping.
---
Are you suggesting the CSM look at the characters reported as bots?  Because I don't think that is a thing they can do.  Now, if you are saying they tell CCP to look at characters reported as bots, how is that different from telling them it is a big concern for everyone?
---

most cheaters rationalize it by convincing themselves that everyone else was cheating
---
One cannot Blame anyone else for Bots, other than those running them and the corps and alliances supporting them.
---
CCP are quite clear they know the damage bots do, and just how much the player base hates them.
---
One must remember that one shouldn’t make players lives unpleasant simply to give Bots one more hoop to jump through that would probably just be worked around with a minimal recode.
---
Sure, people can get away with a three day ban, but you can bet they are forever watched like a hawk afterwards, this is to protect the mildly stupid and not drive every chancer permenantly away, they can usually be re-educated and reformed. 
---
Bot farms however, are a war of attrition. You shoot them down and they Reform, until they realise it isn’t profitable and move onto another game.
---
Solving the Bot issue, requires, consistent, repetitive boredom for both CCP and the Botters, and Feel sorry for the CCP guys, they aren’t machines. It takes a while for the bot masters to get the message and move on.
---
Random noise to a line wow that's amazing. 
---
https://pastebin.com/Cvh3QD41 it took me so long to implement that ( i'm gonna assume your understand i could apply that same logic recursively and add more then 1 offset point ). 
---
Like outside bot makers selling there feature, really the bots are not that complex, like a function like that implemented in any language shouldn't take all that long. 
---
Now you can make it more complex ( that's relatively trivial ) and yes detecting bots of cursor movement is likely gonna have a limited catch rate, because yes bot authors can work around that ( and the more i see the more i suspect i should develop bots for a living ), the issue isn't that there is a catch all solution the issue, but it's that most of the bot source code is still as shitty as 5 years ago. 
---
the Barrier needs to be raised where developing a Wow bot is easier so bot devs go there again. 
---
 We  don't believe you anymore

&gt;I will be running for CSM in this coming year. My main platform is this: Helping CCP combat botters, Giving input onto the ships and modules balance of the game, Work with CCP infrastructure team to help combat lag and improve the QOL of larger fleet fights and moving fleets, Beg you not to vote for Brisc Rubal Beg you not to vote for Sort Dragon  
---
&gt;Looking forward to apply to the CSM
---
So what is your stance on the current ship / fleet balance ? In particular what is your stance on viability of small fleets, sub caps vs capital / supers ? Please elaborate.
---
It’s a troll post. OP made his reddit 4 days ago and tried to post the same thread, Couldn’t post it because his shit was to new.

Wrapped into a random relic anomaly, found someone's 4b tengu wreck

Living solo in a wormhole is possible.
---
However, it is much higher risk.
---
I'd recommend a C3, as they are generally unpopular to live in.
---
I spent roughly my first 2.75 years of Eve in w-space.  I wouldn't go back, especially not without friends that are awlays on when I am.
---
People keep saying that word. I'm sorry but not everyone in the game is a bot. 
---
Awesome dude, love the Trig ships. I would really like it if they (CCP) either buffed Vedmaks or introduced their respective T2 Assault versions. I would just love to make a full Trig mini fleet with a couple Drekavacs, Vedmaks, and the Trig Logi. And in that fleet I'd ask everyone to name their Vedmak "Harrowing". Just because ....
---
Not sure about that. T2 rig mats are keep rising in price.
---
The irony is if you are a goon you sound more like a BoB nerd tryhard. GSF 2019 literally SirMolle’s revenge.

Thats cool, how about we see some results, and I dont mean number of accounts banned. I want to see that when I fly 10 jumps through EVE that I dont see 30 botters.
---
What if we had a NPSI fleet to take down bots? Or would the botters just join it then?
---
Maybe ask Stain Guy
---
Harly when are we reforming gamma
---
Unfortunately you do not qualify for the CSM, being a member of an alliance not affiliated with goonswarm
---
mar5hy is controlled opposition for goons change my mind
---
What if we want an extraction lock on our accounts to protect against hacking? Can we request the same anti hacking protection botting accounts get? 
---
You are pricing your items to too high, and choosing to deal in items that have too low of a trade volume to get your items sold.
---
I list the items, and don't change the price unless they don't sell completely after 3 days.  Repeat.
---
Which items you are dealing in are likely the issue.
---
I pray that your up and coming solutions do not cause regular players more pain just to try and take shots at botters.
---
[https://youtu.be/bgjU8j5mCNk](https://youtu.be/bgjU8j5mCNk)
---
pick some different items to trade.
---
The skill war has been on for a month, it's not news, and nothing is happening, before we form in full soon
---
You're unlikely to get evicted if you power your structure and don't wind up wormhole groups. The trouble with soloing is everything is on you - scanning, logistics, scouting, fuelling the structure, rolling connections - and doing all that every time you want to play without anyone to chat to about it will probably get boring.
---
C2 (NS/C5) are some of the more popular holes for active PVPing groups (because of the NS for content) so it might take some effort to find an empty one.
---
Depends if CCP listens to the shitbrains that want null anoms to be like  WHs and make ganking easier cause VNI are too hard to catch and deny them their elite pvp content. 
---
:allears:

You can be mostly afk and still maintain your spot - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vYJTKXkYajxBmLg6ufnMu8BTbpBbEPFrln74oYyJBbA/edit?usp=sharing

Goons are controlled opposition by CCP; Change my mind
---
That sounds great.  I dabbled yeaaaars ago when eve was a referal 21 day (?) trial.  
---
It sounds wonderfully naive, but I flew "diplomacy" books down to 0.0 stations and made 100,000's of isk trying to educate null-sec ruffians!  It was an entertaining tale - and I learnt a lot off the forums about how to survive bubbles and use waypoints to jump around!
---
I think exploration was added since that adventure, so I'd like to do what you described!
---
Can you go through wormholes and end up in the ass-end of player owned 0.0?  And if you don't mind one more question...  Are there stations that buy and sell in said places, or are they all player owned?
---
Cheers!
---
Yeah but he carried on input broadcasting after he logged in. 
---
Or would you like to try and make the case that he just had an valid need to simultaneously tell people in multiple different systems about ASIC miners?
---
Seriously man, I know you want to fuckgoons, that's OK, it's great to have a large ambition in the game, but jesus man take a step back and look what you're trying to defend here.
---
Yeah really. I still don’t condone it, but I have huge understanding for why someone would bot.
---
Hahaha that's funny, well looks like that alliance is no more
---
I think you are being a bit generous to CCP here. The reality is that CCP has heavily invested in and promoted some of the most afk activities in the game, in particular sov anoms, and failed to clean up distro missions and faction warfare. Meanwhile, stuff like DED sites have been largely neglected, and only with Abyssal space are they really pushing pve in roughly the direction it should go.
---
The reason bots are so prevalent is because they are so rewarding. We know pve can be challenging without just being a series of catchpas, and ccp needs to make things like scanning a lot more central to pve imo. 
---
Can I have cake?
---
I love the idea that he thinks the CSM is allowed to talk to the three codemonkeys left on staff and that any of his ideas will be worthwhile.  
---
Port the engine from Python! make more servers go more fast!! overclock the rams!!!
---
First of all - never search hole near big hubs(amarr,jita).  Its primary mistake most newbie relic-runners.
---
1-3 class wormhole marked is "**Unknown**" without deadly/dangerous prefix. 1-3class hole relic's w/o guards, grub it and become a billionaire. 
---
T1 explore frigates cost you nothing. When you scan signatures turn on MWD and align to bookmark, at least u have few seconds and 30+km advantage to warp out if someone scan you. Cargo containers(bookmarked of course) can halp you hide treasures after every relic site right on Wormhole.
---
RIP English. I hope it is readable
---
I will *once again* tell you that you're flat out wrong. You can call me, who was there, a liar if you like. I'll be interested to learn how you had superior access to the CSM channels at the time.
---
Not 100% sure on this since it’s been a while since I took classes on it but I think the MAC is only resolved through ARP on the last jump right before that piece of hardware, so only the users router knows the MAC of their computer. You could try to ban the MAC of their modem but I’m guessing that would require help from their provider since only their nodes would be sending the last message to the last message to their modem. 
---
If you want to play casually then daytripping is a perfectly reasonable way to play. Make some godforsaken lowsec pocket in Kor-Azor your home, scan for holes and run stuff in those.
---
As I just said in another thread, soloing in a wormhole is possible, but there's a lot of stuff that needs doing (logistics, scanning, scouting, fuelling structures) and it's a lot nicer to share that load around. If I were you I would look for a relatively casual wormhole corp.
---
C2 sites can be run in a Myrm. A Drake can do them as well but it's painfully slow.
---
&gt; I think I should be looking for a c2/c3 with a static low sec and a static that leads deeper into W-space
---
Only combination that satisfies this is a C2 (C2/LS).
---
I want to believe you'll fix the problem, I truly do. Attack the problem in layers, as Glen shofield would say. Small changes add up over time.
---
It's one of the highlights of Eve.
---
I have to admit, I don't really give a lot of input on ships and modules ;)
---
It's standard whataboutism he broke the EULA got the proper punishment but because he thinks others are (whether they are or not) that he doesn't deserve the ban because ccp hasn't caught every botter currently in the game. Some botters may seem obvious but banning accounts on light evidence opposed to you showing yourself breaking the rules to the entire world is two completely different scenarios. I don't understand how someone can chose to die on the hill of grrr goons that hard after being caught that red handed. 
---
Quite a few in my corp, however the ones I know all speak english. Those that do not speak english well likely aren't in coms so I am sure there are quite a lot more just doing their thing.   
---
I love that this game is so global as I've learned a lot about other nations and cultures just from conversations in coms
---
Fair enough. I would recommend joining a WH corp to get an idea of what living in WH space is all about. The below link is a little old, but should give you a good idea about what the corp I fly with is about. Whatever you do, fly safe.

Uh ... k. What does this have to do with Eve?
---
Thank you!  Any tips on which race for exploration main?
---
Won't be in mine (assuming I run again. Still deciding)
---
Sure, I want them gone as much as the next guy, but the CSM input on it really boils down to: "Can you do something about bots please? People who use them are terrible people who I don't want in the game."
---
That's about it. I guess I could repeat it a few times to take up some more time.
---
I'm sorry we've done a better job adapting to the changes CCP has implemented?
---
UNBAN ME FROM YOUR DISCORD YOU COWARD
---
Well the taint is strong with you so keep trying. 
---
Maybe not anoms in null?
---
Yeah, so let's just lock all alphas from one of the easiest ISK making method for the sake of "fuck bots", which would probably make them leave instead of play the game.
---
tbh, those sheets are deeply misleading.
---
There's a lot more to the CSM than the short friday meetings with the CSM coordinators.
---
I think it's a good idea as long as there are some tight criteria applied to which corps get their ticker removed. 
---
he and his 40 other accounts yes
---
F2P is the only thing keeping his game alive.
---
u/BP_EloKnight if you're open to sharing your botter info, I know a flock that would be interested in assisting. #bethechange lol
---
on more serious not sure if there is any Arabic alliance. Probably like with most mixed together within various corps. 
---
404 Botters not found. 
---
I just started doing much larger scale ship industry building battleships and battlecruisers. It has come to the point where mining all the materials with 1 rorqual just does not cut it anymore. Should I stick with cruisers and the occaisional BC and BS or purchase minerals off the market or ores off the market? 
---
Mexalon and noxcium are the main minerals I am lacking even when target arkanor and dark ochre. They also happen to be the most expensive on the market. 
---
What would you do then
---
&gt; Can you go through wormholes and end up in the ass-end of player owned 0.0?
---
&gt;Are there stations that buy and sell in said places, or are they all player owned?
---
They are all player owned and you will not be allowed to dock. There are npc owned regions of null however you could do that in tho.
---
armageddon needs another midslot pls
---
I don't know why you are being sarcastic.... Goons actually have really good pvpers! They are just largely out numbered by "not so good"  pvpers

Please keep him here so he doesn't shit up the Goon forums.

I even take the full sites if I scan in enemy territory. I'm aready stealing their money, so I can at least clean up, because I am coming back anyways.

By looking through all these shit posts stalking one person makes you no better than that person.  Worry more about yourself and what you do and less about others you will be a happier person for it. 
---
CCP servers run on hamsters, not rams. Everybody knows that. 
---
Sorry..
---
Like honestly you can make it work but solo wormhole live is well being that guy living alone on the desert island, it will drive you insane. 
---
Likely you could blops in most of your logistics ( unless you want to jump freighter it but then you need a cit to transfer the items ). 
---
Now if you want to just Rat honestly there better holes out there, for staging for solo pvp it seems also questionable ( like it's not that hard to enter nullsec as a solo pvper ) and really it feels not worth the effort of rolling. 
---
So while you could it comes down to a question of why would you ? 
---
Wallet-ready mission runner here. Did it feel like a grind?

Not going to lie, I try to avoid the timezones when the French are playing simply because I can't understand anything, haha.

fortunately posting isn't a muscle
---
Doesn't really matter
---
You missed the point, Molle used to belittle Goons raids on his empire the way you just did, and goons used to shrug and say ‘we had fun.’ You’ve literally turned into what you set out to destroy. You are in goon in name but not in spirit. 
---
Not murder PvE for the sake of shitbrains wanting to catch VNIs cause it's "elite PvP content" and no risk. 
---
For wormhole shenanigans I'd suggest checking out Wingspan TT's videos.  They're probably a bit dated now, but they show some of the fun and ridiculous situations that can occur in wormholes.
---
Going South is a pretty long video series from \~ 3 years ago but still very enjoyable and always makes me want to jump thru a random wormhole and ruin somebody's day:

---
I mean if they sort out the botting problem, maybe then they can make PVE engaging, high effort and high reward, but focus it on group content which makes it much harder to code bots for (I'm talking logi, ewar, DPS, etc). Finally they can put their awesome diamond rat AI to good use.
---
Wrong game G/F fired
---
The easiest fix is to just swap to the diamond rats AI. Bots will die in their droves. Players may, hopefully, adapt.
---
Lots of botters regularly extract their toons to preemptivly inject new ones too. Unless we get a SP + ISK banned statistic, Im gonna call absolutly bullshit on ANY impact being had on botting.
---
Probably A) Nerf VNIs as ratting ships in general, B) Make PvE in anomalies more 'dangerous' via adding new spawns ("Assault Frigate" or "Interdictor" spawns in addition to the usual Titan/Super/Dread option), C) Make PvE less bottable by introducing more Tryglavian style elements to PvE, or some combination of the above.
---
I mean citi's are OP AF but not for free reps.. I mean its kinda broken in a very specific circumstance.. 
---
Paying for reps is literally only a isk sink for highsecers even before Citidels..
---
Nice Reddit CTA youre having there chief
---
As terrible as your alliance. Lol pets of pets.
---
Yeah I'll never extract my pvp main seems dumb. I calculated up how many sp I'd have to use to extract a skillinjector and between all my mining, pi sp I dont ever use would only be like 200k. Not worth it.
---
I will make a coordination group to assist.

nothing to do whatsoever with this post but it is good to see the rumors about your demise from eve were wrong o7

that's not "IP spoofing". you can't just set your IP to whatever you want it to be.

Roaming for 30 minutes to catch a vni is bad gameplay I'm not advocating for that. I'm more worried about how does an honest player compete against someone with a pile of bots that rat all day
---
}:&gt;
---
&gt; Probably A) Nerf VNIs as ratting ships in general
---
Leave the fucking VNIs alone for fuck's sake. What is so outrageous with the fact of having a cruiser do 15 to 20m per 20 minutes ? Why does this fucking ship need to be murdered because of some stupid lemmings that want to catch them because they don't have big enough balls to actually hunt real targets ?
---
&gt; Make PvE in anomalies more 'dangerous' via adding new spawns ("Assault Frigate" or "Interdictor" spawns in addition to the usual Titan/Super/Dread option)
---
Yeah sure, so that XxVNISlayerTheGreatxX can catch them without a sweat cause he's a baddy that can't bare to catch a target that is actually a PvP ship. 
---
&gt; C) Make PvE less bottable by introducing more Tryglavian style elements to PvE, or some combination of the above.
---
No.

Cheers.  I was hoping for some shenanigan vids!  Nice one.

Yeah, sure you can. But when a new player arrives on EVE and you face him with the different ISK making methods, why is he going to chose VNIs ? Because it's easy, it makes good ISKs and it's not very skill hungry. So yes, it's easy AF, but it doesn't make it a problem.
---
You know why people are going ape shit on VNIs ? Because they can't catch them. If VNIs were botting in high-sec, nobody would give a flying fuck because you can't attack them anyways (outside of HS-ganking ofc), like Distribution bots, nobody gives a fuck because they are not targets. People go ape shit on VNIs because they can't catch them, and to be honest, when I see the rage about all of that, I am glad they can't catch them, suites this fuckers just well. 
---
Its one of my stringest traits, along with my glib wit, easy jib, and silver tongue.

Let's take a step back from the meme for a second. Elo is active almost every night. He organizes, mobilizes, and runs a fleet _every single night_. Yeah some of those fleets are busts - you can't make your enemy form. But if you're criticizing Elo for going inactive I think you seriously need to take a step back and ask yourself when the last time was that you created content for hundreds of people *every night for months*

And i'm not even talking about neut pressure , which is always present in pvp. Even random crabs fit at least med neut.

most damage should be mitigated using oversized AB , and only if it fails , def mode+drug+overheat should do the work .

Thank you for your support

Sorry but you were not approved as a leadership candidate for the GSM by The Mittani, your application has been fore-fitted.
---
I will be posting a series of thought pieces about current meta and balance over the next few weeks. This should answer most of your questions
---
Do any one know what initial loose mail fuel olmeca?
---
Appreciate your support
---
1. Being AFK would just get me removed and replaced on the CSM, if that were to happen.
---
2. Wormholes are mysterious and I believe there should be a showing of a wormhole CSM to give more in depth knowledge on them. 
---
I appreciate your support.
---
Your kind words made me smile, thanks.
---
Depends on which ship is using them.
---
Medium lasers are much more wonked up.
---
I hope I can count on your vote
---
I do not bring my political views to the CSM. 
---
Sounds good
---
You got me, I had nothing better to do today then come up here and lie.  Get a grip.
---
I need to take that class
---
Eve is the only choice in this list.  You’re only on a break.  Come back. 
---
Quality stuff as always. 
---
I will be posting thought pieces as well as a more structured view of what changes can be actively made to help with these problems, while not taking up a large amount of development time. 
---
CCP has not once succeeding in making PVE interesting beyond the initial few times you try some form of it.
---
We can make a better world
---
Thank you so much 
---
I will not be buying votes.
---
Thank you! We certainly appreciate it and live stream/podcast news is something we are in the process of working on. So we will definitely keep you in the loop as we make some headway on that!
---
CCP and the people will do the deciding if I do go AFK. 
---
Go back to botting Mr init
---
There's explo bots too lul 
---
Market bots/mission runners/ hauling/traveling bots/
---
Tell your m8s to make reddit accounts and hop onto r/eve so that we can "help" with the assignment.
---
Plot twist, more time is spent on reddit than ingame...
---
What? How do you expect to win without votes?
---
I used to snipe with drones in a Domi, upgraded to a rattlesnake. Mjd out, let the drones do most of the work, collect bounties and lp
---
yeah that worked out well for gigx
---
The people will decide if I am elected
---
Literally the worst comms I ever heard with your voice included... JUST SAYING, m8!1!!eleven!!
---
The truest of knights will always have my vote
---
Show me where I called you a criminal.  Also show me where I was acting childish.  I was simply responding, in a light-hearted and humorous way, to your over the top defense of VNIs.  You, predictably, responded like a total lunatic who spends too much time playing video games.  I'll make a deal with you - I'll grow up if you go outside. 
---
yeah you fuckin nailed it bud, mar5shy is the one who is buttblasted. You can tell because he makes a half dozen reddit posts about it a day.
---
wait that's you guys
---
The market value has gone down too.
---
On top of that there's no late game stuff for exploring.
---
Superior caches are medium tier at best and drops worthless prints most of the time.
---
There's literally no market for polarized/storyline stuff. No one even uses it.
---
Most of the "storyline" stuff is worthless cause of shit stats or over mat requirement.
---
Oh, my bad, I didn't read the caption on the 'past' image.
---
You called?
---
The only good goon is a podded goon. Change my mind.
---
It is the combination of the two. F2P Alpha clones with a significant amount of skills locked behind Omega restrictions would be much more difficult to farm isk with without injectors.
---
On their own injectors and Alphas are not insurmountable from a botting perspective, but when combined they create a dangerous result that is robbing the future of the game to push up sub numbers / PLEX purchases in the short term.
---
among the numerous things you are not factoring into your thinking here is that were CCP to summarily free up thousands of premium corp tickers, 99% of them would immediately be re-staked about by the same types of nobodies and dweebs who got them 15 years ago
---
all you're doing is pouring water in a bucket full of holes. move on. or, alternatively, develop your own space game with a better corp system
---
"People" is a strong word...I believe they prefer to be called goons
---
1b a week is extremely bad bro 
---
A vni bot with no input makes like 1.2bil+ per day....
---
&gt; Yeah, so let's just lock all alphas from one of the easiest ISK making method for the sake of "fuck bots"
---
Yes, pretty much. This may not be the best solution to the bot problem but if left unchecked it *will* kill the game in the long run.
---
Let's say ACs on cruisers. Medium Lasers are fine.
---
Except there aren't enough sites 
---
&gt;Your assignment is to delve
---
This was a **bold** hint from your professor.
---
No but apparently it makes you salty AF.
---
I think fighting botting in any game is a whack a mole thing, so thanks for picking up the hammer i guess! :)
---
oh good, the consultant is here
---
honestly if he just looked at anyone's killboards (which many people in goons seem incapable of doing, these days) he'd see that BB goes everywhere there is a target.
---
Thanks for designing the armadas, they're fun as fuck
---
Maybe dont knock it before you try it and actually go on a BB fleet and learn how they work instead of assuming?
---
oh dear sixty - when you submit on reddit you either choose self or link post, you can't do both
---
for anyone curious, this is the URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgewi-Odnn4 (googled his ingame name and found the youtube channel)
---
It amazing that guy who brags about how easy it is to multi box and tab through accounts to boosh drones calls bullshit at the idea of miners tabbing through accounts and pressing “return to drone bay”
---
We revive it maybe once a year for a bit but most have won eve and are too busy with RL to play any games together.
---
CE, I assume?
---
Remove pve from sisi for starters
---
&gt;it's not news, and nothing is happening
---
So wouldn’t that make it not a war 
---
I always loved WH space, it brings some kind of peace to mind. I've lived pretty same setup, 3 alts + astra, I was in C2 with C3/HS statics. It worked out really great, but just for getting familiar with solo living in WH. After 6 weeks I decided to move to C4, drop a bit more structures, as the fuel costs are really not that much to worry about. Plan to do a bit more of everything - reactions, PI, research, manufacturing. Along with farming blue doughnuts, as usual.
---
If you would like to join, just let me know, we can figure out something that works best for both of us o/
---
This exact thing happened to me on both of my accounts simultaneously. Ofc my gila in abyss died, CCPs response was "not server lag, fuck you". I also had a video...
---
The reason for the gap between delve and everyone else in the MER is not due to bots, it is due to the mechanics that CCP have created. Remove bots from all of New Eden and I bet there would be very little change to the gap.

All drones go to heaven.

---
Hard to make half a dozen reddit posts when he's banned from reddit for vote manipulation lmao.
---
But he's not in goons, so you're using the wrong metric
---
VNIs will never kill the game. Not as long as Rorquals will be able to make 200m per hour while being just as AFK. 
---
I rebind most keys, and figured numpad 9 would not have made my point 
---
If your interest is only exploration, there is no need to bind yourself to any specific system with the structure to worry about. Just find a quiet (no structures) wormhole, scan from there, come back everytime you're done and log off in safe spot. 
---
Ideally, you could also bring alpha alt to the same system, and keep all of your loot in a container at safe spot. In that case, when (not if) you get shot while exploring, it's less painful, as you would still have all the loot and the pilot to take it to the trade hub.
---
Yeah I'm kinda sick of retards being like "CCPLZ NERF VNIS EVE IS DEAD". 
---
Is there anyway you can show us that it is being effective. 
---
Like some sort of number with the economic reports you do? 
---
eg.
---
200 accounts were banned this month for botting in VNIs
---
5% of player reports were banned in the last month
---
100 trillion isk has been taken out of circulation from botting accounts for links to RMT this month
---
Yes, thanks. Now please ban Goons broacasters and bots. 
---
Kk. Please bring back the Asher hour. Now Jeffrey of the Raiders is too busy with Madden we need some quality podcast content. 
---
I see the same 4 bots come through every night at the same times. 
---
Test is rampant with bots?
---
First, I never mentioned VNIs once in my post, so props on the reading comprehension.
---
Second, you cannot compare the two. Rorqs are a **significantly** larger investment than VNI's, both in raw isk for the hull/mods/drones, and in skill points.
---
I petitioned this exact thing and they said "no". I am really interested if they will reimburse him. 
---
The VNI itself is not the problem, the game mechanics surrounding it are. Those mechanics need to be changed - not the hull.
---
So what ? CCP is going to nerf all that shit ? Yeah, it will work, until bots adapt, then bis repetita. 
---
No u
---
But his soul was mad. Being alone in eve online, it had looked within itself and, by heavens I tell you, it had gone mad.
---
The alternative is doing literally nothing. What a great fucking idea.
---
Whatever it is, the only reason people yell about it is because they can't catch it, shall it be VNI, shall it be Rattlesnake, shall it be my ass. 
---
Lol thanks aha didn't even know lmao thanks for posting it :D
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgewi-Odnn4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgewi-Odnn4)
---
afraid to tell you ccp already plan to nerf pretty much the whole trig line. they even said its coming during vegas.  
---
Probably pg / cpu reduction, base hp reduction, speed reduction, and more than likly, a reduction to the base damage of the weapons (leshaks having more dps than sieged haw dreads.... Dreks hitting 750k ehp... )
---
I could give a fuck if a VNI gets away from me in null sec if it is actually piloted by a person. You're just talking out your ass right now.
---
Done sorry lmao
---
Haha typical me, should be fixed lmao
---
So as far as low yield are you referring to another activity with similar skill point investment and ship investment or are you comparing it to carrier and super ratting? 
---
True. The point was to see if the fit was as fast as pyfa said. FacPo never locked them.
---
I mean, maybe actually do something about botters if you don't like seeing it. If you actually do something about a problem, it stops being a problem.
---
Suprise! We've all been retarded the whole time!
---
We gave ccp proof of it 18 month ago and nothing happened when he did the same thing in our region
---
oof
---
I thought the SOE probes came from SOE missions?
---
An alpha can fit a heron with 2 sensor boosters, run eccm scripts. It's not a cloak, you can still get caught on a site, still get smart bombed on a gate and such. What it allows you to do is go to a "safe spot" in space and run both sebos and the only person who can scan  you down will need perfect scanning skills and implants. This allows you a little freedom to scan stuff and learn how it works out in space.
---
You can go to the signal cartel website that tracks the Thera connections. Use those to get from A to B in null or whatever quickly and back. Sure you will lose ships,  but one site or even one good can will pay for it. Have fun learning.

No, that miner was banned from GSF for input broadcasting, but nice try.
---
delete this
---
Ahhh a friend is wondering what the song is?
---
RUUUUUDE
---
personally I would almost say its better to go balls deep right out the gate without anyone to hold your hand. The most fun I have had in eve in my 13 years is doing just that, even with all the mistakes I made. 
---
Seriously. Nobody cares if your English is bad. 
---
It's a game and all we want is having fun. Your accent doesn't matter at all. 
---
You still have those totally legit players copy and pasting Intel in every system ? 
---
Hahahaha. No. We all know goons can't tackle.
---
It is an English term for public housing. It has negative connotations.
---
If you've got the skill/capital to do carrier or super ratting, then that's obviously way better.
---
But even newbros can switch to things like relic hunting and pull in more ISK than VNIs can. If they want to stick to ratting then a Rattlesnake won't demand significantly more SP, but will drastically improve ticks. Or they could go do incursions for much better ticks. Escalations can also be quite profitable, even in a shit-fit long-range Domi.
---
Maybe if you left your bot-infested, cheating corporation people would have more respect for you.
---
Mmmm kinky 😉
---
I don't understand why someone would bot in a rorq... When it's set up, it mines automatically until the rock pops. A botting rorq should be easy as fuck to kill, they'll have their Indy core running which means they can't get safe. They won't be active to turn on active tank, or swap out mods for extra buffer. And they won't light a cyno. The one thing you'd probably see is input broadcasting for multiple rorqs. 
---
Pandemic Horde is your friend to this solution. 
---
It's an older meme sir, but it checks out
---
Yeah except I'm not imperium at all 🤔
---
Do you have any specific examples of non-legitimate players doing this? Since there’s a lot of people who report intel, given the nature of living in a fairly dense region. I normally report intel when I’m in Eso even. It’s pretty tough to get anything out of a blanket accusation like this, since I’m not about to look at everyone who’s ever dropped a name in intel channel. I don’t hate my time that much.
---
🔥
---
Sissters probes do come from SOE LP shop. Look at core probe variations, you'll see what probes i mean.
---
Hey there fella, you seem to have injected one too many weeds.
---
I love the jag. It can be fitted in many different ways. I have fits ranging from a low dps kiting missile fit, to dual prop, dual rep (MSAB+SAAR), MSAB+small shield extender, cap stable blingy shield rep and etc. For fittings there's a Reddit post about the fits, so just google it. As for tips - I mostly try to go against cruisers with low tracking weapons (like laser boats and stuff). The only problem with that usually is getting into range, especially if the enemy is further away from your scram+web range. So you need to close the range fast while at the same time keeping the transversal speed as high as possible and that requires some manual piloting skills. For that I'd suggest you check Chessur's vidoes on YouTube. He has good vids on transversal and manual piloting so that will help you understand what you need to do.
---
I used to build Survey Networks and have them installed in the alliance IHubs. I've stopped because of several reasons, one of which is that I can't check what is installed in IHubs any more. 
---
It is overfarming. In Delve, it is mostly the lower level Data sites that are left. 
---
Elo please clarify what is the problem with Sort and Brisc. You are a strong candidate but you don’t have to beat them down in order to get elected. 
---
I'm sure more people than goons threw botting tickets at CCP after a dozen screenshots of local messages within the same server tick were posted on Reddit. But no. It's all a Goonspiracy. Deep State Imperium strategy. Black hand spymaster at work. Mittens sends his regards etc.

I mean you used to have a bunch of numbered accounts in every system you owned that where clearly there for collecting real time intel.

Goons only kill roids these days.

As someone who's bot mined before, you literally can specify what rocks to mine or not to mine and this was 7 years ago. I'd like to think this software has improved since then since it's still active and supported. 
---
Fucking club penguin XD
---
I am pretty sure I've seen a picture of some rams on the CCP servers in the past.
---
You can specify what rocks you mine as well as which ones you don't, you'd have to be retarded to include the ones that'll get you killed by your own alliance.

What was your char name again?

i dunno but he sounds like the kind of guy i want to get to know

I found that looking at the lowest and highest price on a certain timeframe you can spot a certain pattern. Pick a item that suits you, buy low sell high. Sometimes it takes a few days, sometimes it's months. Jita is hard

Is this just another account for the guy who doesn't understand how ice drones work?
---
SHhhhhhhhhhh
---
So he shouldn't get a ban because there are other people who bot; yet the argument is made that special treatment is being given.   
---
I don't understand. Ban him, and ban all botters once exposed. How does the fact that others bot have any bearing on his punishment?
---
LOL yikes
---
MFW apparently TEST is "rampant with bots"
---
  No wonder why CCP takes ages to act on real botting accounts when they need to sift through thousands of tickets from solo hunters who struggle to kill VNI's in active pockets with Intel and comms...

fitted to the fore of what
---
I have names of most of the botters in BOT. Can you kill them too?
---
to spazzy for me
---
Do you have any evidence of them actually botting rather than just being in system?

Also are you sure they were TEST-owned? We had some numbered neutral cloaky campers in our space for a while.

We have in game events in which players can take part in the unfolding history. When it leads to something like a new ship, you write it off as being "pumping out new items". If it does not conclude with something major release or climax you accuse it of being a tease. 
---
The EVE lore is playing out in real time. We don't get books or giant trailers that advance the story in huge ways. We do get chronicals and in game News, which is evolving and continually calls back to previous events. The lore doesn't exist as a justification for a series of park rides (although the older systems like missions and epic arcs seem to be so). Generally the lore plays out along side player action.
---
This happens because EVE is mostly about player interactions, and seen from a capsuleer perspective. We don't get to see very much behind the scenes but there is a lot we can gleen.

The current ongoing story is quite active for those who wish to engage with it, it is simply true that not a lot of people want to directly engage in the ongoing affairs of the NPC empires. Which makes sense. We are not agents of the Empires, we are aloof alien mosters too busy playing with massive war machines like toys and treating people like cattle to be too conserned. Even still, we the "War of a Million Lies" first referenced in [Inheritance](https://community.eveonline.com/backstory/chronicles/inheritance/) and now again in [Sign Wave Omega](https://fiction.eveonline.com/stories/chronicles/sine-wave-omega).
---
Would I like there be more visable lore activites? Of course. I still think CCP should absolutely make more [CDIA files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJKcK-Fv80I), but the issue is CCP can only realy focus on the things they can prove will engage with their playerbase, which is for the most part not the ongoing lore. Because of this most of the best lore developments, and efforts have been labors of love by individual and teams of devs (EVE Source, SCOPE videos, Jamyl event, Sansha Incursion events, etc.)

shower thought: you're the forrest gump of /r/eve

Yeah this is why I initially made this thread as I was surprised how little I see people using the Buzzard. The massive selling point for me is being able to install the data and relic site rigs at the same time as well as being able to fit scanning mid slots. You can gain some of that align time lost by not fitting an afterburner or microwave. I think you gain 1-2seconds. But I havnt tried this yet. 
---
To me the Buzzard is the best ship for data and relic sites. The problem is you're made from chicken wire and paper :P It seems like a lot of people take the Astero for the extra defense but imo if someone manages to creep up on me I'm already dead so I really dont care about defense.

does that make goons the hillary clinton of eve then?

This. Also 100% applicable to being able to multibox a dozen ships and just AFK them at the same time. Whether or not this style of gameplay should be allowed is up to personal preference, but it should not be **rewarded**.

Being a CEO or FC is the quickest route to a burnout. Most people just want to log in and be served content like a pre-packed airline meal. People call CEO’s and FC’s out for not bringing content, burning out and quitting - few people ever stop to acknowledge how much work they put in so other people can enjoy the game, often at the expense of thdeir own enjoyment. We need a ‘hug your CEO/FC’ thread / day where people can actually stop being shit and say a thank you to the good CEO’s and FC’s who make Eve magic happen.

TBH, I haven't noticed any such botting in my parts of Delve (at least among ASCEE). Assuming this really isn't a shitpost, how do you tell a botting rorqual from a normal dude? I really haven't looked into figuring that out

kidding, if the market was at some point at the price you listed at, there is a good chance the market will come back to that.  Unless you sold at an all time high, your goods will eventually sell.

I think the bots are in every system, even highsec. I roam though Atlantins and the neighboring systems on occasion and they are filled with ratting and mining bots.

Awww this so cute. Day 815 of delve rorqual bots not banned. Lol day xxx of &lt;region&gt; bots not banned.

Damn people. There are bots everywhere. U gonna demand every area 1 by 1 on reddit be banned?
---
I hope all bots be banned.

But there is only so much they can do. Maybe ccp needs their own piece that bans shit. But saying ow its goons only is pretty shit.

Another thing CCP_peligro isn't saying but I assume from last time I tested something with him (I think it was him at least :D) is that reporting provides CCP with extra logs. Which can but only help them find patterns or find new botting methods.

Hello EVE Reddit
---
Let me give you some insight on this and so everyone knows I know this was my fault in the end this isnt a pitty me thread just wanted to lay out everything so I can coupe with the situation. Soo it started almost a year ago at the time me and my wife were going through a very rough time her mom passed away and it just caused her to spiral and do dumb thing after dumb thing... Sadly about 3 months into the new year I come home to my wife sleeping with not a man but another woman... I thought we could work things out even for the kids sake but sadly we couldnt and we divorced.. soon after I realise a gaming laptop of mine I had went missing at first figured I left it around the house as at that point in time I was a depressed mess and my house was not in the best of shape after months of getting out the mud of my life and trying to make thing better I get around to cleaning and getting the house back in order but... still not laptop at this point I am confused so I called my now ex wife to ask if she took it... well I thought my life was in the shitter but for her it was even worse she got on really hard core drugs and was selling everything she could get her fix apparently she sold off my EVE account since the laptop and everything was still signed into my gaming email which is not my primary email as it took me months to even notice that the password was changed on my gaming email after months of back and fourth with Google Support I got back access to said email... and it was not a pretty sight I found that most of my MMO accounts/ Steam account was gone... then I turned to EVE in a frightful panic to make sure it was okay... low and behold my account was gone I could not log into it, could not retrieve any details period I had to create an alpha account just to submit a ticket... after another couple months of fighting with CCP to even let me have access back to the account period they finnally responded after almost 3 months of back and fourth they gave me back the access to the account but would not restore and skill points or assets... So it was a win... I got my account back but my chracter of almost 13 years gone just like that all my skills were drained I have a whooping 6.4m SP when the toon had 180m SP and was sitting in an Avatar... all gone...  so to everyone never. trust. no. one.   not even someone you think you are going to be with forever...

Thanks for the vid.

Isn't that the game where they have an online marketplace for ingame items, but if you sell stuff for lower or higher than the suggested price they ban you saying its unfair and antisocial behavior?
---
I’ll do my best with any information you provide

Ironically, you're referring to the guy who literally just got banned for input broadcasting. He was actively cloak camping Esoteria with his numbered accounts.

Was he really? And is there a way to prove someone is vote brigading?

So your wife became a lesbian, you got divorced and she became a drug addict, sold your computer and the stand out problem in this was she RMT’d your eve account. Only an Eve player could possibly make a thread like this.

I wish you good luck if you run! I liked the writing style too

A better question would be can you find a post with goons being as salty about that ban as your average redditor is about this one?
---
But but but...  The Wall... 
---
yea I will have to check into that next time
---
CCP released the numbers for alts before, the average is about 1.2-1.5 alts per real player
---
This is the highest income option.  mach is my favorite mission ship it's fast, high damage, good application, just all around great. 
---
And once you learn burners you can pretty easily hit 200-300mil/hr.  All my fits are here:https://forums.eveonline.com/t/burner-mission-ship-advice-to-solo-them-including-fittings/9580/7?u=chainsaw_plankton 
---
not sure if any are outdated haven't run missions in a while but I haven't seen any posts about mission changes since either.  Can also make a bunch of optimizations but that usually costs a bunch of isk or adds risk.  Mutaplasmids should open up a lot of interesting fits too, but with RNG I didn't want to include them.

That means that your bot would only be mining ochre.

Then do something about it. Take in volunteers. Train GMs better. Don't just ban in waves because by then the botters are up 50-500 b isk and can just inject a new fleet of Gila bots.

Judging from the fit it was designed to hunt ratting VNIs. However, the #1 important thing you can use against a ratting VNI, IMO, is a web. A webbed 100MN VNI starts taking a **lot** of damage from the rats, probably more than you're doing in the Hecate.
---
If I were him, I'd probably drop the adaptive invul, use a web, then fuck around with the lows &amp; MSE meta to get a damage control for more tank.

easily 10%+ bots, and probably 25% afk, 25% alts and the rest players. 
---
probably 5% alpha accounters

I wonder how they get that number, because it seems too low. If it includes people who started and quit the game within a few weeks or something it might be right, but anyone I know who has played for more than like 2 months has at least one alt.

This is old

It's PvP to go with your PvE.

You log in for your couple of hours, leaving half finished sites, to ruin the time for all the other explorers.   Which obviously means that they'll get frustrated and leave your grounds alone.

It is obvious where botters live (the local outage recently was a clear demonstration of the scale of the problem).. solutions from the community have bee talked about for years... so I am not sure where this optimism has come from;  maybe the continual negative /r/eve about it.

CSM members keeps telling us that you guys are worried about the out of control ratting and mining in the game.. I guess you are also optimistic about that being fixed too.

While it is true that you don't use it in your posting, I don't think your brain having a refractory period is a thing. Not to mention several years of it would make most people seek medical attention.

You can also try waiting for them in the site itself with a cloaked sabre and/or fast-locking bomber and astero.

I might be getting flair baited but it 'seems' like the super majority of all posts in all the Marshy posts come from members of Imperial Legacy. Marshys ban also has absolutely no bearing on my EVE experience and I have a total of 1 BB fleet to my name.

Actually, the gap would probably get wider. Which coalition has the most real people? Hint: it's The Imperium.
---
Just make anomalies more randomized and require more active gameplay? No need to nerf any ship or activity if that was the case. That goes for Rorqs too. The issue isn't the 1 VNI, it's the fact that anoms and mining is too fucking easy multiboxing to infinity, with or without input broadcasting.
---
I love it, if I use it for something who do I credit and send ISK to?

As cool as it is, kinda fucks the kids that dont own a console/PC.

You assume correct good sir. I’m on the same general path as you guys as of late. RL leaves little to no time for much of anything extra.

No more that I have Eyes out around the place to give me a few jumps to switch out to Sentries. 2 40-50AU warps (Before they even get to the system) between me and my scouts gives me enough time to switch and assign sentries.
---
Besides you didn’t think it through, what about the min/max whores who split all their drones and put one each on different targets for maximum whoring. (Gallante Tricks). If you want to solve it offer a bonus for the top damage scorers and a deduction for anyone with disproportionately low damage, that’ll also encourage people to lock up broadcasts properly and not just tail in on the end of kills while they scatter fire.
---
Looking forward to a thesis written after summer dude spends 30-6mins a week in Jita. GL. Do it for the science!

I really appriciate the stance, and that you're actively doing something. Thank you.

I'm surprised he doesn't have the "GOONS 4 LYFE" signature the other trolls have

I really think if you are at your keyboard, playing the game, you should be making substantially more isk/hr than someone, who lands, launches drones and afks.

Astero bc why not be ready to pvp when you undock. Only use the covops for pure scanning, as in wormhole chains or sig scanning in null
---
Iirc buzzard/covops are only better than an astero at scanning if you’ve got covops 4 or 5. And your last paragraph exactly. You’re paper. Why run the data relic sites when you can camp one in an astero and get loot and a killmail our if it. Bonus points for salt

Input broadcasting at least. You might think it's silly, but given that gaara was banned for it, apparently there's people out there that consider it worth it
---
lol these fuckin BL idiots are so dumb. first the come down to delve (DUMBEST THING EVER) and we CRUSH THEM then they run to reddit to shipost and ruin everyones experience????? why dont you come back to delve where ill be waiting arm in arm with my goon BROTHERS (something you wouldnt know anything about) and we will drop 100 titans on you fuckin shitty boys
---
Both are messing with it, by different mechanisms. Capital ratting breaks it just for the sheer amount of ISK you can print in one ship. AFK ratting breaks it because, in a different way, it reaches similar levels of ISK/effort.
---
The irony of the new police skin marketing campaign is "You are the law" ... doesn't anyone else giggle at that..given the "look someone break rules....no response"
---
I wasnt in gamma :( 
---
Wasnt it literally Elo who hellcamped the fuck out of goons capital fleet with that aborted joke alliance? Do goons teach you no history?
---
No mechwarrior online? I love my mad cat MK II-B....fear the hiss of my dakka
---
No, that's not the case. There are arguments for and against the Alpha state, but without injectors, it would take weeks to train an Alpha up to be able to fly a VNI and it wouldn't be practical if you got banned after a week of botting.
---
LotRO, naturally 
---
Am I in BRAVE 2015 now?
---
You literally suggested someone rich enough could steal ALL YOUR SP if he’s rich enough. Yeah thanks go away now
---
&gt; I manage without a problem multiboxing 4 VNIs while being semi-AFK
---
This is **exactly the problem**. Game design shouldn't encourage people to 'play' the game while not actually playing, and feel they have an entitlement to high in game income without actually playing.
---
Nerfing drone ratting overall would be a good step. Almost nobody rats in non-drone ships because they're so vastly better than anything else for most ratting.
---
this is a great post my GOON BROTHER! after we crushed their tiny dicks with large manly mouths when they deployed to delve (DUMB) they resorted to shitting around on reddit like IDIOTS and no one likes them at all. GOONS FOR LIFE!!!!
---
Have you eaten your hat yet?
---
You only have 350 rig bandwidth on an Astero. You have 400 on a Buzzard so can get the extra data and relic site strength. An extra 10 is a massive help in destroying mods. It's better than the jump from T1 to T2 analyzers. 
---
Additionally you have five mid slots on the Buzzard instead of four on the Astero giving you additional scanning modules making you even faster. 
---
The Buzzard and Astero are not the same in my opinion when it comes to the data and relic sites themselves. It's a choice of dropping defense for better hacking/cohesion strength and faster scanning. A T2 Buzzard is also roughly half the price. 
---
McBotty McBotFace would be an ideal corp... kidding... this is is a thread i dont know why I clicked and read on.
---
Sizing the botters via this route would give strong scary metrics that would hurt CCP not aide them... bare in mind CCP has one sole objective guard the metrics around bot vs population numbers.... bot ubiquity is a number that you do not want to advertise for a game/product.
---
In this history of stupid ideas this is literally the worst. Nobody would ever undock a high SP player again because they’d basically become flying 200 billion loot piñatas for guys like PIRAT to brain rape. You do understand some people have actually paid a DECADE or more of subs to earn that sp? Not everyone got it from the injectors via the free anom isk fairy. I would cancel every sub and never log in if CCP introduced any mechanic that tied PvP to sp loss. Keep your greedy sp gluttony out my brain tyvm. 
---
Don't do it, you'll burn yourself out when you have to do everything and it's boring as fuck by yourself. Plus in the event that someone does come knocking good luck defending your hole. Join one of the many wormhole groups. Trust me this game is so much better when played with people, even more so with wormholes. It's nice to have someone watching your back.
---
What's your stance on FAX removal?
---
"  Helping CCP combat botters " Good luck they can't be bothered to devote more than one guy and some closet space to the cause of getting rid of bots, and they regularly ignore the CSM when it suits them anyway.
---
Two things about that, although you're not entirely wrong.
---
One is that if you make the gameplay more complex and more randomised, it's harder to write a good bot, as well as being more fun for human players. How about randomised waves, intelligent targeting by rats, randomised connections in The Maze (it's not a maze if you can just look up the way to the final room, is it?), rats who understand target selection, logi, webbing your drones and so on? (Sleepers and diamond rats already do a lot of these things.) You end up having to write a responsive AI, rather than just a script.
---
The other is that if you keep changing things, people don't get value out of a bot before it becomes obsolete, and it stops being worth the author updating it because he can't sell it when it doesn't work most of the time.
---
none of them listed a cause CCP has ignored for over a decade as their sole focus.
---
Plus every querns badpost main dish usually comes with a side dish in the form of vaugepost and/or previously estabilished karmawhoring meme/"opinion" by Brisc Ruble.
---
I have only just restarted playing so this may not even work anymore(I have a question just put up). I always found using shortcircuit and eve-scout data was often the quickest safest way to get deep into null(and back of course).
---
You can spoof an IP...
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address_spoofing
---
Not likely no but then again throw down an athanor and keep it fueled. Most wont bother to attack.
---
Have an orca or frieghter ready to repack everything if you do get reffed or just keep minimal assets so you can log them off.
---
It's really not that risky.
---
CCP already ignores the issue and the people have been ranting about it for years.. So it sounds like you are setting the stage to bow out after you realize CCP is going to do nothing even with you championing the anti-bot cause.
---
Does the zeugma still double dip into both the data and relic skills giving you more HP than the t2 versions? 
---
Yeah the Astero is a personal favorite! I got a few other ships I wanna do as well
---
I knew why I stayed away from "sports games".
---
Didnt say it was quite the opposite we meed bigger isk sinks but ship repair isnt where we need it.
---
I still find it hilarious that everyone thinks that Mar5hy is actually banned.
---
I died in abyssal space when the enemy was bugging out half in and half out of the pocket and it wouldn't take damage. No refunds for me.
---
So how come we keep seeing the same characters doing the same thing even though they've been reported till people had carpal tunnel? The old line was they are banned in waves but many of these accounts survive multiple waves so that excuse has gotten a little stale. If you guys could manage slightly more than one piddly little PR anti-bot stunt a year in highsec they might feel the issue was being taken seriously.
---
I mean, I do blame the botters. It is proximately their fault.
---
But yes, CCP help them a lot. It shouldn't be possible to make large amounts of ISK (or fungible resources, e.g. minerals from mining) when AFK or near-AFK. As well as risk/reward balance, there should also be effort/reward balance.
---
And how about not allowing injectors for the first week of an account, or not for alphas, or something else that prevents people from insta-injecting VNI alts? Bans don't stick because you can just start again the next day, and if you manage to launder your ISK you have enough to do so out of the profits. Any genuine new player isn't going to want to buy an injector that soon anyway. This would restrict the ability for the rest of us to instantly spawn new alts as well, but that would also improve the game.
---
Actually I'd just like injectors to act like boosters, injecting maybe 50,000 SP a day, not dumping it all at once. Being able to credit card yourself into a Rattlesnake on day 1 is not good for the game, and nor is the ability for the super space rich to ISK themselves into yet another Rorqual.
---
And yes some simple changes to anomaly mechanics would make a huge difference, both to bottability and also to fun - wouldn't it be more fun to have some uncertainty about what you'll be facing and have to actually play the game?
---
sadly, i think the only way to truly answer this question is to calculate your profit margins. 
---
You vastly underestimate the workload of constantly changing the game, and vastly overestimate the difficulty of writing a bot.
---
You randomize the maze.  Both players and bots do a right-turn rule to solve it.
---
They have logi.   Both bots and players shoot the logi first.
---
And so on.
---
At the same time, that random maze needs to be thoroughly tested.  And the randomness can’t be as easy as calling rand(), because if it was truly random it isn’t always solvable.  While not difficult, it is harder than implementing a right-turn rule.
---
Same with more advanced rats.  Which is why the rollout of more advanced rats is sooooo slooooow.
---
Well I'm currently running a vni on my way to a Rattlesnake. I find vni ratting to be extremely useful to just inject money into my wallet especially without having to go anywhere or without flying my evening worth of loot through dangerous space. You get your money now and in increments rather than risking your whole night to jump it back to base or to high sec to sell. Plus the relic game is pretty heavily hunted by new new bros so there is a significant lack of sites without taking 15 or so jumps just to get started. Usually takes me an evening or two after work to start making profit if I lose my vni. Without a month or more of hard training into something I don't see much of an improvement in isk per hour. On top of that is easy and semi afk but that's just a bonus. I much prefer to run sigs in my tengu because it's active 
---
Or you create proper ISK sinks to the game to balance out the ISK faucets. That way, you wouldn't have to destroy the PvE aspects we have rn to cater to people who don't want it anyway and which will never adopt it on masse, no matter how you change it.   
---
I don't agree with OP in blaming CCP for botting happening, but the fact that its happening on this scale should be a flashing red light for a wider issue thats always kind of been there.

Two of the key methods of making isk in game are incredibly unengaging. Mining and anoms present very little engagement for the average user. Most new players who mine quickly learn that they can tab in and out with very little increased risk or fall off in income. 
---
Botting should be a clear signal that the nature of the content needs to change, to make it more engaging for the player so they're not tabbing in and out, and also making live very hard for botters. In particular, mining and anomalies. 
---
And give the bots more sites to hack?

He looked deep within my soul and assigned me a number based upon the order in which I joined.

Seriously, get it right, it's RRRR, RRRR, RRRR, RRRR, RRRR, RRRR, RRRR, RRRR, RRRR, RRRR, RRRR, RRRR,

Pretty sure it is stainguy "  "I will build a great gate-- and nobody builds gates better than me, believe me --and I'll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great, great Gate to stain, and I will make ccp pay for that gate. Mark my words."

Can anyone?

Not everything needs to be compared to this standard.

You can also spelunk an IP.

Yes. be another worthless F1 slut.

This is also the problem with CCP's "banwaves" strategy. If botters can get around permanent IP bans, CCP gives 'em enough time with each bot to make a significant amount of money. 
---
If CCP would ban these bots 2h after they started up, a lot of the botters would have to go get real jobs since they could no longer reliably finance themselves off bot income. 
---
You think I haven't already searched for answers to these questions. I guess I can forgive you as maybe you identify as a poorly programmed bot but this is an extremely valid question.
---
You have motivated me to see if I can block people on Reddit.

Railgun range with tracking of blasters. What's not to like.

Oh man, 15 hours old, seems I missed the latest installment of StainGuy's obsession.

These are such retarded statements. If there was no local then there would probably be nobody undocked in anything expensive in Null sec, like everytime local breaks. 90% of my null sec alliance logs off and goes afk. Hole/gate control would be pointless in no local null because of cynos. While it may enable a hunter to more easily attack rorqs or Supers, with no local, you would have maybe 10% of the prey there is now, especially considering those big toys will double in price due to decreased mineral supply.  It would make Null sec more risky than wormhole space and less profitable.

You mean suspension?

Fucking weeb.

I just reinstalled the game after leaving just after wormholes were introduced. I feel totally lost - what major changes have been made since then? Even just terms to Google would be appreciated.
---
You're fucking spoiled... here you are with the audacity to request new functionality in the game... now eat your skins and know your place... what do you think this is... a game that evolves based on growth, maturity and player needs/wants.
---
OUR CSM folks need your support, we're aiming for bugs to be fixed and maybe..if we keep the circle jerk pumping sessions going a bot / eula breach ban or two... but lets not push it...
---
now returning you back to Nyx Police skins.... stay on message.

The annual ruse Reddit until they think everything is real.

Right? All the 'pro pvp alliances' form big because they can, but most good fights I've ever gotten have been from renters

Rocket fit dual scram bomber...its only good for this one application but its goddamn good for this one application. Dictor cloaked right by the can is better but less hilarious of a killmail.

You'll have to be more specific as to which unsuitable candidate you are referring to .

Maybe if CCP starts off the meetings with a big pile of blow instead of coffee for him he will stick around.
---
i want to use missiles. i love the idea of a swarm of explosive tipped phallic object splattering my enemies. most of what i see is others saying that they cant compete in damage with lasers and cannons.
---
how do i make them decent dps? what ships would be good for pvp? pve?

We need to spread this news. Just this weekend I must have seen half a dozen cans where they just left the carbon.
