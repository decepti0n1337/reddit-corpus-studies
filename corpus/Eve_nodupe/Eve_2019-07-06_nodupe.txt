Move to highsec/lowsec if you want to be a carebear. Nullsec was never meant for people who want to sit and have a cosy time farming.

---
Just posting to confirm that while this event may be organized by Imperium members, this is open and welcoming to all. In game I'm as grr goons as it gets, but in RL we're all just nerds hanging out. This is always a good time.
---
Bye Felicia.
---
Balls deep for you imperial fagots basically lol
---
Make me want to puke with this hipster bullshit post
---
I can tell you exactly what will happen and how it will happen without any risk of The Plan~ being jeopardized. Reddit has unwittingly flexed it's voting potential to put Tyrannos Strategos onto the CSM. There is a reason Tyrannos Strategos didn't appear on any Imperium ballots. We couldn't allow for any indication that we actually wanted him on the CSM. Not even to our line members, it had to be you; reddit that put him there...
---

---
Reddit puts Tyrannos on the CSM with the hopes that he will be something other than an embarrassment. The scandals that surface involving gobbins and olmeca will further deincentivise the [/r/eve](https://www.reddit.com/r/eve) crowd from participation in CSM. Reddit voter turnout will see an all time low, paving the way for an even more powerful GoonSwarm voting bloc. This will have ripple effects causing a sharp drop in viable non-bloc candidates and a sharp increase in NPC candidates designed to split up the vote for the benefit of The Imperium. A member of the northern side of this war will change sides and help The Imperium. The unchecked proliferation of un-used citadels will continue to be zealously addressed by the real heroes of EvE Online. The Imperium.
---
All of this will happen and there isn't a damn thing any of you can do about it. Even if a small percentage of you are self aware enough to accept what is happening, it's already too late. The election is over and no amount of information control will halt the downfall of reddit voter turnout.
---
The past 3 years I have canvased here knowing full well that you would never willingly accept The Key~ to your shackles even if presented to you. The ultimate argument inoculation, the ultimate dead agenting of an enemy group. It's too late, there is nothing you can do. I have already won.
---
it is real!
---
I wasn't clear: add NS local as it now stands (no requirement to be chatty) to WH.
---
4 ships doing what exactly? If its any of the following, no one cares:
---
-rorq mining
---
-VNI/rattle ratting with near2
---
-intel alts
---
-cyno alts
---
-sitting in your capital waiting to cyno on something
---
Not even the most dedicated small gang guy has 4 ships doing things at the same time relating to pvp.
---
30K Goons roaming around in subcaps wold be excellent. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Those 30K Goons would quickly turn into 20K Goons and 10K former-Goons. 
---
And how is *that* going to play out?
---
It'll be content. A metric fuckton of glorious content.
---
Idno who "someone in this thread" is or what their relevance to our discussion is. The blue donut is a problem, CCP realizes that, and they're doing something about it.
---
I was winning EVE. Damn you CCP, first the invasion now this... Downloading and resubbing now
---
Are you talking about some phantom newbie player who is also living in nullsec solo?
---
I understand what you mean but things like dscanning should be taught, and scouting can be done by some of the hundreds of online players in their megacoalition. Isn't that part of the point of having those massive player groups?
---
All it takes to be a picket for a ratting system is someone in a pod or a 10mil Heron cloaked off the gate, with the jump activation sound turned to full volume. It doesn't have to be something crazy.
---
I also agree sov needs changes and wars aren't being enabled except out of sheer boredom right now which are all things that need to change too.
---
finally, our time to shine
---
:D
---
Please do.
---
If u see them it will be a lot more organized. There are regions people will jump to rorquals cynos blindly to help. That might happen less. Ik I just with a dread blindly np. It's just 3b. Doesn't mean anything in eve anymore.
---
HTFU! It’ll be fun!!
---
&gt; ~~erection inception ~~
---
Erection Intelception FTFY
---
Miner, calm down.
---
lmao we lived without a functioning chat server for a year
---
I think they'll be fine
---
I found the dude crying about AFK cloaking entertaining as always. Damn those evil vile cloaking devices. Damn them all to hell 😆
---
Pretty much. Coincidentally also the whiniest, most vocal group in the game lol
---
I feel like this is just going to make people even MORE risk averse. Like, you think there are going to be more people to hunt because of this? 
---
The botters will have their systems covered with gate eyes, they won't be new prey.
---
Real players will probably just rat less and/or find a source of income that doesn't leave them as vulnerable
---
Big blocs will be more hesitant to take large fights since you don't know exactly how many people are in local, in their dread staging, etc, etc. 
---
I really hope I'm wrong, but I feel like after a week or two this will be kinda disliked. Sure, it works for wormhole space, but that's not nullsec lol.
---
Hope I'm wrong though.
---
If I want to go without risk, I go after Proviblock. As a hunter, there isittle reward in ganking some noob outside of the large groups ratting in a VNI. I would rather encourage me groups to take root than allow the current empires of alliances grow even more.
---
Though I am also a wormhole and would to love to watch null burn to the ground.
---
T2 ships are going to be scarce again? A ressource and not a staple? That's a problem?
---
Even if undeployed, a slingshot Rorqual takes around 12 seconds to align and warp, and that's with a special fit.  An Orca is about the same, as are exhumers and barges.  By the time the pilots of such ships can see the incoming logoffski dictor on their dscan it's probably already too late.  This is much more than a nerf to people who afk or bot.
---
As I've mentioned elsewhere, people are acting like this is just going to make null like wormhole space.
---
IT IS NOT.
---
Wormhole space doesn't have an ingame map that tells you statistics like pilots in space and NPC kills.  Wormhole space can control their entrances by critting all holes and rolling the ones to undesirable connections.  Wormholes are not subject to cynos dropping entire fleets on a scout's tackle almost instantly.  PvE in wormholes is generally much more lucrative on an isk/hour basis than in null.
---
There was a very fine balance of risk vs reward in null, and I would agree things were getting stagnant and needed a shakeup but this, this raises the risk tremendously, with the same reward structure.
---
holy shit lmao I forgot this existed
---
Speed.
---
You mean like how it already is in wormholes? And most wormhole groups do just fine
---
CCP isn’t here to ruin the game, they’re here to ruin *your* game.
---
Yeah Astero fights are super hit or miss on whether it's an actual fight or an explorer you are kinda beating up on.
---
the autistic will find a way to make their style work even better now
---
hunting is easy, don't be bad
---
step 1: dont add wrecks to dscan
---
step 2: sit in system spamming dscan button
---
step 3: if the filtered number goes up by 1, it's hunting time
---
When you get lost too much time in wormhole space
---
Covops do become visible on dscan when cloaking. It is a small window but you can see it. Someone paying attention can then warp or mid off and align if they need to. IF they are paying attention. However, if they are not then I feel no remorse.
---
The only exception to the cloak window are Combat Recons which are dscan immune. And personally, I am not a big fan unless in super small gang or when solo.
---
Lol
---
So much aids.
---
It's called, go do something else for July.
---
Cry us some tears...
---
When you stay too much time in wormhole space
---
People have said TQ was a blue donut for 10 years, we are in the middle of one war and goons just finished a different one. The only thing that drove these wars to stop was CCP intervention so maybe they should stop doing what they are doing so we can continue our war.
---
Hello Kitty Island Adventure and Barbie Online have put up refugee camps for the likes of you. God bless and stay strong!
---
I'm glad I'm not subbed right now. Being force to PVE over a holiday weekend sounds like cancer.
---
If you are goons or test you're fucked. That's kind of the point. If you aren't goons or test, guess what, you get to fight over the power vacuum.
---
Do you smell burnt toast? I think you had a stroke.
---
YOUR PROBES ARE UNDER ATTACK!!
---
can i have your stuff?
---
make sure to include other family too
---
I'm not safer than someone in high-sec, people in high-sec do not have to deal with the nonsense people in null do. No one orca mining on high has to worry about some edgelord in a cloaky ship pointing them and hotdropping a fleet ontop of them.
---
if you mean Eve-O official forums... you can't put shit back in a dog.
---
R/eve is not a hive mind
---
So... Exactly like it works right now?
---
Said no one in GSF.
---
Let's hope they all unsub and leave delve undefended.
---
Words are hard
---
it was a good bomb run. clinical execution. not fun from the horde side, we thought we were going to fight it out until that happened.
---
we didn´t miss you tbh.
---
All these nullbear tears...
---
I aprove of this message.
---
Aaahahahahahahahahahahajajajajajjajahajaaj
---
Entosis maybe
---
Yes
---
In my experience, never underestimate the power of human stupidity. People will take risks, its who they are. Also super rating is NOT the only way to make money. Doing wormhole sites can be just as profitable. It just isn't as safe at times due to the need to travel from time to time. Incidentally, its also how my Corp spots a fair few targets. On the way to go clear relic/ gas/ combat sites. Other times we baited using a carrier in a combat site and absolutely dumpstered a T3C fleet when we responded to the carrier pilot's "distress."
---
I wish we could have left it trigs vs Feroxs too.
---
Its pretty fun up there
---
No im Happy because they remove your local.
---
BLOPs rebalance when?
---
I'm assuming you speak spanish so...
---
Haceme el favor de dejar de ser tan peltudo.
---
No te olvides de contratarme todas tus cosas antes de irte, gracias.
---
It took a day or so for them to drop last time and it'll probably take a day or so for them to drop this time.
---
i too like having a stroke
---
Its not that type of content we want anyway.
---
Goon brigades are already out in full force
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
Also VNI’s getting nerfed
---
He is about to drop the biggest most masterfully thought plan ever concieved in EVE. The Embargo 2.0, now instead of fucking with the market they are gonna buy everything for sale in New Eden and biomass all their characters. That will show them!
---
I'm so happy, you young little krabs know nothing about when eve was hard.
---
Hashtag:welcometotherealworld
---
And what if your anom is farther than 14 AU from the ingress point? The Covops in warp is immune to Dscan, can land cloaked, maneuver, and point.
---
Resulting in, "Thanks for the ISK! Bye suckers!" :D
---
The only thing you have to change now is the travel fit being all ecm being worthless
---
&gt;Welwyn DeLuca
---
8h
---
&gt;Unsubbing all 3 accounts. Thanks fozzie, you finally made me win eve.
---
  HAHA the forum thread is a gold mine of salty krabs
---
I don't believe the *cyno* needs to change. 
---
I believe the *jumpdrive* is actually what needs to change. 
---
* Long distance jumps/bridges take just a long as short distance ones; one session change timer.
---
* Big ships and small ships land at the same distance from the cyno; 5000 metres. 
---
These two points mean that there's no downside (other than bumping) to having every F1 monkey pour through the cyno. 
---
So, yes, the current teleportation mechanics still favour the biggest null-blocs.
---
His only ping on the topic was pretty chill.  It's not like that part was entirely unexpected to be a thing at some point.
---
lol...too right.  
---
Never underestimate Goons ability to not understand risk, and feed ships like a crazy person.  Got to love them.  
---
I expect things will work out in the end and honestly it’s hard for me to get too worked up.  I was just thinking about how these changes may push the meta this way and that more than anything else. 
---
People will adjust over time.  More than a few people though will probably sit on the sidelines till we actually see what CCP has in mind and then either dive in once it’s been min/maxed or leave for another game.
---
How shit are GOTG.
---
This is before local has even been removed, imagine how they are going to manage afterwards.
---
The sharks are circling and it's going to be a feeding frenzy.
---
I'm allergic to Delve and have a doctor's note ok
---
How does one RMT when buying plex from CCP?
---
If they were gonna use an autoclicker they already would be. 
---
This argument doesn't make any sense
---
i've been roaming montréal since last week and holy shit french v is a long train man
---
hopes it will pay off
---
&gt; Especially since this is temporary,
---
  Hopefully they don't listen to the whingers and keep it forever
---
That moment when you have to say DBRB is a gsf FC...
---
Considering they still have yet to change the way combat anomalies work and that GSF has the biggest response fleet around this is likely to effect them the least. Carriers, supers, and Rorquals will still drop a response fleet. More small ships might die though.
---
Other regions will feel this more. If you don't have a response fleet ready your less likely to bring out the big toys.
---
I predict more VNI level deaths and less capital deaths.
---
Yea....it's dope.
---
If you ask null then it is
---
That degenerate remembers the boot ini incident and still hasn´t learned how to play the game without local. That is why nobody takes eve players seriously in tyool 2019.
---
Fuck off.
---
Up voted thread just because you don't like it.
---
Nina Glutdrache is it you? :D
---
&gt;  likely won't undock anything bigger Than a stabbed vni
---
  Unless they're staring at their screen 24/7 while running sites, they'll get caught by cloaky tackle.
---
  This is gonna make cloaky lokis king of the skies
---
Local changes will make things interesting. But at the same time I am amazed at the amount of people drooling about free kills on PvE ship.
---
More space, more moons, more ships built, more place to build those ships, places to use those ships, etc.
---
As a nullsec player I say BRING ON THE CHANGE
---
Depends, who are you
---
If you feel eve is funded just by subs alone in 2019, I have something to say that'll surprise you. blackmailing via subscriptions doesn't carry the same weight anymore ever since F2P- and PLEX/Skin sales
---
This won't affect goons a lot, everyone else without a super cap umbrella will. All this really does is fuck with botters, and most intelligent ratters will just jump in cheap t1 stuff or not rat at all. At least the hunters can fight each other and get that small gang pvp they always dream of.

maybe form up a fleet? Ask for mates to patrol the gates? Pay them a cut of the mining fleet's profits? You know- Play the game as a team?
---
Imagine going to an eve meet, meeting these people, as real people.
---
I hope your dinner was ruined too.
---
Havent played eve in years but this sounds like a good reason to come back. I can be an extra bitter vet now.
---
Then you fly in dscan range, name your ship something provocative, and uncloak for 10 seconds every few minutes.
---
If the krabs refuse to undock and defend each other- they won't bother undocking to defend sov timers- they'll lose space, and eventually structure assets. Undock or lose your shit.
---
Blueing all of null takes some time you know
---
Can I have your stuff
---
Implying rorq fleets hugging spod rocks makes the game a vibrant place.
---
One can only hope.
---
Nobody gives a fuck who you are enough for that information to matter.
---
You're a welfare recipient, what could be gained from this?
---
I used myself as a reference. Just a few months ago, that was me. Spent one month in HS, and finally got into a corp in NS. An alliance in Legacy with no cap umbrella (at the time). I lived in a pipe system and got wrecked many times. I learned how to survive over time but local was of course a big part of it. I didn't lose interest and now I have 3 accounts subbed, I bought some plex and I'm in a carrier. I'm fighting a war against FRT.
---
Without local, I would have just moved on. In fact I almost did, since the entire skill system sucks for a new player. EVE "pay us for months before you get access to decent content" Online, basically. Just removing local is hasty and bad, and I hope it will stay in some form that yields useful information.
---
But yeah, my general point is, new players are important to think about.
---
Wait, wait, wait, you guys hide for weeks from war decs? Hardly a loss for the people who play eve of you never come back.
---
Unlimited. Slots are limited only by your characters skills. 
---
Slots hasn’t been a thing for years now. Instead the more industry that happens in a system the higher the system index cost.
---
You sir are a gentleman and a scholar!
---
Less rorqs mining
---
  Demand for minerals stays the same
---
  Prices go up due to less worthless krabs spodbraining
---
  More reward for the risk
---
  ????????????
---
  PROFIT!

---
Must say the execution was impressive.
---
They also wiped out the reshipped fleet shortly after the stream went offline ive heard.
---
CCP Hilmar is Bob's chosen prophet. He foretold this.
---
Make Stealth Bombers Great Again!
---
And how is getting caught in a rorq different now, to when local is changed? The only thing that changes is not knowing there's a loki 20 jumps away. Apart from that, you still have your Panic module, your cyno, and you SHOULD be in a fleet ready to counter... What's the difference?
---
"I CAN'T MINE IN PEACE REEEEEEEEEEE"
---
More vibrant than no ships in space at all lmfao, at least rorqs can be ganked.
---
It would be relevant if wormhole sites were anoms that could be directly warped to without probes giving advanced warning..
---
&gt; Like he was directly asked about it at EVE DOWN UNDER and gave that specific response
---
  Love it how when this was linked- everyone was cheering for it. "Shake up eve!" people were shouting- Now a fraction of the playerbase (turbokrabs) are scared their safe space is compromised. "I wanted a shake up that helped my play style"
---
Goons 2K19: you can take the carebear out of highsec but you can’t take the highsec out of the goon
---
This is disgusting. They log in, roam our space with no local and kill our krabs and bots before they even materialise. Litteraly. There is just nothing we can do. Like how is this supposed to be fair. Meanwhile Falcon is parading around saying that we should calm down and that everything is fine.
---
So CCP is turning Null sec into WH space with but with jump gates.
---
Eat shit
---
Are you nuts? Give these motherfuckers a raise!
---
Sure, they could have handled the Drifters better, but overall this is awesome.
---
This is the medicated shampoo and shave nullsec needed to cure its case of krabs.
---
Go back to Wo- oh wait you are. Stay there.

Reduced bandwidth...
---
Hmm.
---
Delayed/Blacked out Local?
---
Oh boy. In a week? Oh shit!
---
“Oh hey, ecm. Rook primary I guess”
---
You all have tried that in the game and it hasn't worked their either.
---
I remember we ganked one of this guy's rorquals a couple months back, I got him to pull up my toon after the kill and he went on some grrrrr goon rant.
---
Good times.
---
You absolutely should!
---
Goddamn that was a fun fleet.
---
Implement friend or foe identification beacons that are set with passwords. Let espionage occur when they get stolen. Force players to use shibboleths to identify friend or foe!
---
So what's the sentiment amongst Testes?
---
https://youtu.be/IbAxQLv-QE4?t=7
---
Bait
---
I have good news: https://zkillboard.com/character/96797619/
---
Where are we seeing that it's only 48 hours?  The thing I read said that CCP would give a 48 warning before blowing out local - where is this "two days only" coming from?  I was under the impression that this could last for weeks/months.
---
You are the most reliable badposter I've seen in some time.
---
VNI's are getting nerfed, so they won't be used for ratting much. More Myrmidons will die, though .-D
---
This was very helpful thanks.
---
One quick question though if you have a moment I am still a bit unclear about the number of alts.
---
Were you using them to work together somehow, or simply to have more factories to operate?
---
I cant work out how an alt would help my main be more efficient that I would bother training them up. Perhaps if I train a hauler specifically but if I'm doing this I feel like my main should have the needed skills?
---
I agree that it would be a big change, but I don't think it'd go out the window. If I were a ratter, I simply send out combat probes and click go once in awhile
---
Less rorqs means higher ore prices- which means a higher payout to those who take the risk. Grab your mates to protect your ass while you chew rocks- win win.
---
  If you can't take the risk, or you're a risk averse coward wanting an easy ride- find another game.
---
Hell yeah brother, cheers from Iraq
---
Goonfleetdotcom is that way 👉
---
WWB MK2 when
---
Obviously
---
&gt; without even asking the CSM or any represents first
---
  ASKING?
---
  The CSM merely passes on views and ideas between the players and CCP. CCP can do whatever the fuck they like- It's their game. And some random "space politician" isn't gonna change shit.
---
&gt; it needs to be worse than the active system
---
Maybe make automatic dscan use a % of your capacitor, but let you adjust the timing however you like, down to like 2 seconds or so?
---
I expect CCP to eventually just say that we exploit and break the game. And then ban us, or at least our leaderhip, like they did after Siege of Yulai. Or simply find something on Mittani and ban him, like they did with GigX
---
Better yet, how about they don't and you HTFU
---
I only moved to null like two weeks ago. It's definitely going to be interesting. Bots will die, which is a good thing. It's going to be exciting for sure. Is the VNI nerf happening at the same time? That will make it even more interesting... Rattlesnakes, Ishtars, Domis, and Gilas will be all over the place.
---
I've barely logged in for 2 months- with these changes, not only will I jump back into the game- I'm gonna resub my cap accounts.
---
None of that is needed. With passive moon mining dead there’s no reason to have a empire bigger than 2 or 3 regions. 
---
And with drifters doing stuff, not only is there a minimal benefit to holding more space, but it’s also more trouble than it’s worth. Space is already pretty divided up between the major coalitions, everyone has all the space they need, and doesn’t have a reason to permanently take any more
---
Loool
---
I played eve online from release until 6 years ago. These news of shaking things up and causing null to change things. 
---
I ran a smaller sov alliance and it’s refreshing to
---
See things. I re-subbed and I can’t be alone
---
this sub is bipolar as hell
---
Cornak with the Snipe!!, but yeah bro already replaced :)
---
Moth
---
You wont. They'll never to go player gatherings- They hardly play with other players in game as it is. They want to mine/rat in peace, and watch their ISK wallet go up to buy their third titan they never undock. All the while alliance is pinging for more dudes for fleets- He's busy rubbing one out over spod rocks.
---
With local gone there's more incentive to have people defend their systems, and those are the targets roamers want.
---
 Im not holding my breath but maybe after a few weeks of this more than half of our pilots will be aligned on a given warp.
---
So I'm pretty stoked.
---
The thing is as a pvper with no desire to ever earn isk via pve i am totally fine with the effect this could potentially have on the market
---
Well don't accuse us of having a blue donut when we clearly are trying to have wars. Instead CCP is forcing us to go home and play PVE whack-a-mole while we guess at what they are doing next. How should we HTFU? We are dealing with what CCP is throwing at us but that consumes our free time, so no time to prosecute a war.
---
Super excited as well. Keep in mind this will likely drastically change prices on a few things. Bots saturate the market, some things are cheap because they are around.
---
remap to space, save effort
---
-2 paid subscriptions
---
I'm starting to wonder if local was ever really broken, rather it was a test to see what would happen?
---
Believe it or not Mittani has been in support of at least changing null local since his CSM term
---
We'll miss you bot friend :(
---
This. Is fucking glorious
---
WHY REMOVE LOCAL FROM NULL? OMG WHYY
---
I am very angry.
---
And domis
---
Yes my question is why?
---
&gt; RMTing isn't as bad as you think it is
---
&gt;globby
---
Really did you take a poll or some sort of survey? I don't think I should be immune from PVP and think the removal of local is stupid.
---
Hey u/CCPFalcon why do you still have ads up for Eve Toronto?
---
rook will do it
---
I know you're excited, but never lick my lips again.
---
Pretty much this- You roll through some regions, and all the ships are landing on fortizars docking up the moment you appear in local chat. If the krabs want to krab, they'll need backup.
---
Hello I'm Draclira Merlonne and i approve of this message. Let the blood flow my minions.

Noone's opinion here represents that of the playerbase.
---
But good bait bee.
---
Naa I want to see all the salty threads demanding CCP revert the changes or they'll call daddy Mittens and their dad is a lawyer.
---
I have a feeling that they can't implement delayed local on top of Eve's stale spaghetti codebase.
---
Check gs_isk, we had a conversation about it earlier this evening.
---
Triple box frigates is way better risk/reward.  I have 75m on the grid in t4 abyssals.
---
Good.  You really won’t be missed, you entitled fuck.
---
Have an alpha on each gate nearby.  Of course they have to be on separate computers, could call them a...virtual machine.
---
Solo? Or with 2 others? Do you throw dpwn a mtu or just get the bio and move on?
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

---
Just need to use non-shitfit rorq and have response fleet on standby.  Easy.
---
Why not a test and a f up at the same time?  Ccp saw the bot chaos and saw how it broke them.  Why not break them more.  But the side effects of, or unintentional effects on smaller groups will be a unsub.  Just like what happened before war deck changes.
---
Finally giving me an excuse to come back to the game, fit up the blops bs I left the training queue running for and bring out my recon alt :D
---
Oh, don't worry your pretty little head.

Is this recompense for that time we spent a week photoshopping Falcon's face into memes?

I will wait for something permanent, but if they want my money again this is a solid step in that direction.

The most obvious bait to ever obvious
---
Wormhole guy here, can deny this claim. We will be rolling off renter space and hitting goons brave and any of the other high activity blue doughnut bears.
---
You mean the Dominix and Gila? (+Ishtars for omegas)
---
Probably rattlesnakes too.
---
It's the only solution
---
In game right? the only people doing anything irl and harassing players is CCPs SJW GM team. EVE Online is a game, its a GAME JIM!
---
Thanks I will
---
*watches intently, slightly drooling.*
---
be sure to file a report to ccp
---
It’s almost like different people have different options and voice them at different times.
---
For people who dont want local-theres LITERALLY wormhole space. Instead of pointing that out and telling whiners to shut up, like any normal developer would-CCP went full retard and is deleting local in nullsec.
---
The chances are so low that you could let a few structures burn in exchange for hundreds of free reinforces though.  Also, it takes a couple supers or a single super to defend from what I've heard, should be easy to defend I'd think.
---
P sure mittens isn't exactly opposed to local changes, so g'luck there
---
All this time in the sandbox and nerds always seem to forget that we play at the pleasure of ccp. Good or bad they do what they want and we either adapt or we dont. As for drifter stuff this feels less like a raid boss and more like a zombie invasion. Its chaotic and random. I would be severely disappointed if it's as simple as shoot x and your sand castle is safe
---
I suppose "blinding" your opponent could make a valid strategy when attacking a defender.
---
I mean they nerfed respawn times from 5 minutes to 12 minutes that's pretty huge.  Same with all the mining and fighter nerfs that have nerfed income.
---
The big elephant in the room is actually skill injectors.  Skill injectors are the cause for the "hyper-inflation" people are complaining about and CCP is panicking over yet they make money off them so they want to change the game to accomodate that lifestyle.
---
I have had my corpse scooped by them in the past, before this current iteration of their AI. They will shoot wrecks too.
---
100x Livestock or Genetically Mod Livestock.

Use an alt and stop posting bad baits.

Posting in a legendary thread.
---
Dominx, Myrms, Gilas and Ishtar will increase a little, but not that much since it will spread to different hulls; people are gonna buy VNI for cheap and use it for PVP (it was already good, now it's probably gonna be OP).
---
Depends on whether you ask krabs in Eso ("REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!") or pvp'ers in Immensea/Detorid ("Fuck yeah!")
---
r/all here: someone ELI5
---
Shaking up the old bitter vets is good for the game let some of us new people have some breathing room.
---
Preferences are adaptive. If botters leave, prices will rise and increased income will attract people who are capable of adapting. There will be economic disruption and price fluctuation, but that's the price you pay to enact long-term reforms.
---
Of course, thank you so much is was a blast.
---
Botters beware.....  lol
---
Believe it or not, most goons are fine with it.
---
Good luck. Proteus sucks.

It's been a long time since I've dabbled in this game, but there's bound to be a reasonably small list of 'bottleneck' components that you could focus on to increase the bang for your buck.
---
Not me though, I'm space poor.
---
People get suicide ganked in high sec all the time. They cant join a Corp with out being war deck's. Null sec is the safest space unless you are in a shit alliance
---
To me it seems like it's going to be shit for anyone that doesn't have a super cap umbrella to drop on Intruders
---
And in one fel swoop goons lost half the members lmao
---
Local is IMO one of the most disturbing metagame addons that ruin roleplaying style gameplay. Damn yeah. Delete it forever and let's play tactics and thrill again!
---
Rooks don’t use drones, so if a hunter was using your method a rook could krab 24/7 and you’d never know
---
That’s not going to help when you get hotdropped
---
That only applies to everyone else though, small gang, black ops hunters, wormhole raiders and other PVP focused groups have had to adapt and change over the past 3 years, moving into wormholes, using more accounts, dealing with the capital umbrella, Citadels, ansiblex gates, overpowered and regionally untouchable capital ships
---
These guys can't even do anything different that isn't orbiting the same Haven they have for the past 3 years. Nullsec is more entitled than Highsec and has less critical thought power, less desire to play in an ever evolving world and with player interaction than the average retriever pilot in Highsec. 
---
I love how we used to get told to just bring 2 logi and 2 recons to deal with capitals pre nerf, but telling them to bring just 1 rapier or just a 1mil sp player in a vigil is too much. 
---
You've been screeching adapt or die for 3 years, let's see if you can adapt or die for a 3 week long event.
---
No one scans for those, especially in active krabbing systems. Maybe they will start if recon krabbing becomes a thing, but as of right now there’s no reason to
---
It's been awhile since I played. I remember that once upon a time proteuses could be cloaky w-space gankers
---
More Strathisla next time!
---
All they have to kill are soytios and ihubs with supercap upgrades
---
Please please move to lowsec
---
Same, I'm gearing up to jump back in after a like 9 months. It's an exciting change,  and I even mined a shit load. I welcome changes that make eve dangerous again.
---
&gt;everyone else without a super cap umbrella will.
---
What do super caps have to do with drifters? Are people now killing them with supers?
---
I got my biggest smallgang kill yet in Amamake.
---
I also got my own shit fed to me.
---
10/10, move to Amamake.

Now that is a great idea

&gt; ed a lot of eve, to where most of his time was spent playing the game. Friend B did not. Friend A would tell friend B about his day, but friend B had no idea what a point or a dread bomb was. Having played the game a fair bit, I would translate into plain English what friend A was talking about t
---
Awsome story - broadcast for repps almost
---
I want to do that
---
Except wh dont have super fleets and are mass limited
---
Ah no worries, 
---
I’ve made some pretty decent money doing Hisec sites so I’m looking to swap the Myrm for a VNI. Would a similar fit work for a VNI?
---
Chat being tied to a structure sounds like a terrible idea. Chat barely worked to begin with.
---
I love this so much!
---
I ramped up Domi production 10x
---
True, we do play and the pleasure of CCP wanting to make money,  and we are their customer.  
---
If it was only truly random, the only alliances seem hit are those involved in the current major wars.  
---
as I said it's speculation, I'm just trying to understand.
---
Pretty much sams, last month kb has been mostly dry, I was busy with work too. 
---
Perhaps now once more I'll take shit loads of solo pvp fits I've collected and go for a spin in Branch.
---
"Harden the fuck up" - CCP probably
---
Yup, this is pretty much the drifter mechanic now I think. I'm all for it.  It's really hard to get any idea of how things will actually impact huge null blocs by testing them on sisi or just going by what people say (the people saying they're unsubbing all their accounts over this etc, yeah right), so having a way to "do it live" while also having an in game reason to be able to just say welp never-mind that's not happening anymore, is a great way to go about it imo.
---
incoming deployable for intel relay
---
Are we though ? Dont be afk be on coms and  be in fleet with the correct fit and your fine
---
At least I post with my eve name
---
My brain melted
---
More players = more seats?
---
Lets give wormholes 4 seats with their 300 players, that would be smart.
---
Can I have ur stuff?
---
Good ole Curzon Dax.
---
People keep saying this as if it's a bad thing and I'm just confused lol. Some of the most fun content that's left in eve is tackling a rorq or w/e and fighting the defense fleet that warps in. Unfortunately since everyone is so spread out, that pretty much means cyno'd in caps, but if they're in smaller clumps you're more likely to see the lower sp pilots bringing subcaps etc. More interesting than just hazing a few bil in fighters and fucking off.
---
That is the exact reason its random. The people involved in major wars have the most structures. They defend the most space and no this isnt a client customer relationship this is a game created by people and we are subject to the whims of the people who make this game. They are not required to please us and can do what they want.
---
hehehe some of us do, for example i'd do bridger, light tackle , super carrier &amp; "another scout type" :P :P
---
Local Chat is a channel that updates to include player names in the channel list (or remove them) upon entering any system in normal space. In wormhole space, you ONLY show up if you type something into it and even then your name is only there for about 15 minutes. 
---
It seems like the devs are now removing it for NullSec space, the region of normal space that doesnt have NPC empire influence and is all able to be owned by players.  The big thing here is now you have no way of knowing if enemies are in the system with you by simply looking at your chat list.

Not only that they will absolutely have a chance to get a inhib up.

92% of new players quit in the first two weeks

Make huginn's relevant again?

This if you have three hawk capable pilots.
---
god bless
---
Don't worry, they're soon going to nerf capital weapon application against subs back to what it used to be. Supers won't be effective counters to roaming sub gangs anymore. And Finally the long winter will be over and the game can grow again.
---
Well you’re lucky then my friend. The reconditioning program is pretty intense. You get locked in a room with BBTB whilst he reads GS_ISK and screams it back at your via microphone. He also does a pop quiz on ore types just to shake things up.
---
[This is the last straw.](https://i.imgur.com/k9Lyctd.jpg?1)
---
PI question. 
---
I had a great fellow answer many questions for me, thanks  u/NyuIsHere !
---
I do have one additional question.
---
Most places I look assume PI in WH.
---
Hi/low not worth it for various reasons.  
---
Whats the advantages/disadvantages of PI in  WH vs Nullsec?
---
why would I do one instead of the other.
---
Sounds legit
---
lol if youre that much of a coward then good.
---
Does anyone actually read that besides BBTB?
---
Oh haha I get it, it’s black, dark and empty.. just like my soul
---
&lt;3
---
Welcome back my dude 
---
Hopefully we get more people who want the change.
---
want a cookie?
---
Depends. If you make enough money where it doesnt affect your IRL wallet at all, people can just use real money and use the ISK for other shit. Though to be fair, it does provide ample opportunity to make good ISK to the point that making ISK for PLEX isnt \*hard\* and certain methods scale fairly well such as Rorq mining.
---
Tripleboxing. No mtu. I get the resource caches as well, but it’s only really useful if you are building ships with it.
---
I personally have 8. No I don’t mine and or rat at all, I use them all for pvp, hunting and general logistics.
---
Do I think someone with 20 rorq alts is healthy for this game? Idk but I know for a fact my brain can’t function with 4 or more clients running simultaneously, I can only imagine the autist with 20 rorq alts getting caught must go through. It’s like a retard punching bag at that point for me who likes to hunt out those idiots :^ )
---
I don't know why people rat to pay for PLEX, just do PI, actually don't, more people doing it means the profit will go down.
---
I have two, am avoiding a third, most people in my corp have 2, with the CEO and XOs having about 4-6 each.
---
I agree.  As slow as rorqs are to wind down and align...I don't see why this is necessary.    
---
In fact, I'd make them even slower to wind down and align if you want to get good fights.  
---
I'd be interested to see the numbers of krabs who just don't log in.  IMHO, logins gonna plummet.
---
what risk?
---
Thanks Man! Totally gotta relearn this game haha
---
im really excited for the local delete
---
I'd guess 80% of them don't bother reading updates. Shit many nullbears even log into comms? The first day or two will be a bloodbath.
---
Actually no. Despite me posting with my name, I do not post as good as you do.
---
Wtb Chameleon.
---
He literally is, though.
---
Goons crying about risk is top tier.
---
douchebaggery
---
You have limited number of planet slots and each planet is dedicated to producing one thing, so more alts means more plants, which means you can make a lot of the PI you need.
---
You aren't doing basic planet setups with this, this is optimized so every planet is a huge factory planet (no miners, just makes the one thing you want it to, really well.) and also note that the setup WILL take you a long time to complete with how annoying and tedious it is.
---
Generally to mass pedicure a single p4 planet (assuming 2 input) you want 1p3&gt;p4
---
2p2&gt;p3 4p1&gt;p2
---
That's 7 planets for one simple chain.
---
It gets even more hectic if you're making the materials yourself instead of importing, you'll have to add A LOT of stripper planets to maintain the output of the factory planets. (Just import, you'll make more.)
---
With alts you can (with help of spreadsheets) plan it so you make many of each factory type, resulting in more end product planets producing for you.
---
Ideally you'd want as much alts as you can afford to to make, both isk wise and mental wise, as there's no hard limit on how crazy you can go with it.
---
Of course you can do it with one character, but you won't reach anywhere near the numbers I stated, even three characters with PI will make you a decent chunk with the setup, more than enough to plex and have much left over to enjoy.
---
Except they show up in the YouTube tutorials newbros inevitably turn to when confronted with EvE's overly complex skill training ui. That said, it's far easier to figure out now than it was when I joined

Can't fix it, it's now s feature.

Plot twist: we don’t.

In other words... You'd rather lose EvE as it is than watch it survive in another form.
---
WH is dead
---
anything in asset safety automatically gets delivered to a lowsec station after 20 days if you dont manually move it to another station/citadel in the same system it was originally in. you didnt lose any of your stuff. youre just going to have to pay 20% of value to get anything back, firesale whatever is worth that 20% but not worth keeping, then contract your hauling service to move everything else back into null
---
Ok, srs answer to your questions on the off chance this isnt bait
---
1) Botting = using an application or script to automate your gaming. So instead of being at your computer, you can go off and do other shit while the app controls your ship and makes money, mines, etc.
---
2) Skews the economy, prpvides an unfair advantage in some cases, and most importantly, its against EULA.
---
3) the apps/scripts use the instant updates in local chat to detect if a hostile enters your system. If you enter a system full of botting carriers/supers for example, those ships are entering warp around the same time you actually load into the system (rendering them an untouchable source of isk generation).
---

---
Obviously, it's no one. I made the whole thing up. You've cracked the case.
---
Okay, that makes sense. Thanks!
---
I don't know if I'm smart enough to live in a wormhole tbh.
---
I KNEW IT!
---
Np, my dude
---
I've slowly dwindled down my 20 something accounts to nothing over the last 3 months. Rolling into nullsec every single night and having to chase a horde of botters was so draining on my morale and the very blatant silence from CCP outside of "report bots" killed my desire to play the game. Earlier in the week I started selling everything off, decided for the first time since 2006 I was gonna actually quit Eve.  
---
  
---
Today, I get to work and get mass-pinged by friends and former members of my corp (which I started to wind down as well) about these changes. I will resub and play Eve again, and I'm stoked for these changes, but I sweat to God if you just tease us for a month with this shit and renege because the krabs REE'd enough, that will probably be it for me. This is one of the healthiest changes you could possibly make for the game on all sides. Less people will be comfortable AFK mining/ratting, so the economy will begin to unfuck itself a tiny bit, botters will be significantly easier to kill, and about a million other things. This will radically shape up the game (although likely not the politics) and I'm looking forward to Eve more now than any time since 2012ish.

You have effectively fished for my upvote

Thanks, it's been a while since I've cringed this hard.
---
I love the change. Now to introduce a mechanic to hunt down afk cloaks campers
---
Dayum
---
Ngl I kind of like their salt.
---
And implement some sort of passive moon mining also please.
---
Either way, their oppinion is wrooooong.
---
Most space is still under utilized. A site takes seven more minutes to spawn doesn't matter unless someone is actively waiting for it to respawn. 
---
The carrier and vni Nerf help but as long as space is under utilized, just adding more accounts will negate the nerfs. Unless the way we utilized space and actually are capping that more often little will change.
---
Meh, highsec is an important starting area for new players and a good area for trade and low-level activity. CONCORD is pretty central to that. It's all well and good to make null and WH space harder, and hopefully LS more viable to live in, but high seems pretty alright ATM.
---
Bot d-scans, sees a ship on dscan and docks up. Turns out it was piloted by a friendly blue bot, who has also gone to dock up.
---
Id be alright with that feedback loops.
---
It's missing a few "D-scan" in there, but yeah.
---
My two wishes:
---
A black ops implant that makes you invisible to local.
---
Hackable structures.
---
Most of them actually are.
---
Remap it to spacebar. Makes life easier.
---
How is choosing to be a nullsec pirate something reprehensible? Why would I sit shooting rocks all day when I can find and shoot you and steal your shit? It's nullsec. There is no police. Of course this would happen.
---
Above average post. We’ll allow it.
---
NOOOOO... THE KNOWLEDGE... IT BURNS
---
I never do this, but HECK YEAH OMG THIS IS GOING TO BE AWESOME sorry for being loud
---
Many will re-sub.
---
Your name messed me up for a sec
---
&gt; Not even the most dedicated small gang guy has 4 ships doing things at the same time relating to pvp
---
Not true. I pretty routinely would do 4 and above for PvP. I'm not great at it, but I definitely did it frequently.
---
you also chose a wormhole, the nullsec masses did not.  It is easy for wormholers to say htfu we already deal with this, you chose to deal with it.  I dont rat so this doesn't effect me, I am active enough that the asset safety removal would not either, but so many people would be and they have build their hangars around knowing that.
---
That said, I am for altering asset safety, I am also for altering local, I just think that this is going to not work as intended.  Every salivating for all those juicy kills good luck dscanning empty system after empty system o7
---
Every time I watch the HTFU video all I can think about is how many of the people in it were laid off because CCP's management screwed the pooch.
---
Null only and temporary. Not impressed.
---
Keep in mind it says [2019] on it, so next year finding friends will be removed from the game
---
Finally, the AFK cloaking nerf that Eve deserves.
---
You SHOULD be compensating your protection fleet. If you want to go mine highsec, go. I'll roll up with my pirate fleet and suicide gank. Makes no difference to me, I want kills. We'll go where we have to to get them.
---
Pay us and we will provide the protection and as an added bonus might get some kills which would be great.
---
There will be no incentive to leave hisec...  the past changes should have told everybody that they need to look about 5 years down the line.
---
I'm not sure why people are shitting on you. You're likely right about quite a few people unsubbing or quitting over this. The reality, though, is that it doesn't matter that much. Those are not people that would have provided content for anyone else, they're just the reason that super hulls are down to 11b. If some of these people leave (likely temporarily), it's not that big of a deal to me, and I think it might unfuck the economy somewhat.
---
It's good for people who want Eve to be more dangerous, since you won't be able to see who is in local so can't be afk or semi afk in null without dramatically increased risk.
---
It's bad if you're a miner or someone who likes being afk or semi afk because you don't know if a shitload of folk just arrived in system to fist you.
---
I see, you're one of those people that posts here but doesn't actually play the game. Gotcha. That context makes the post make a hell of a lot more sense.
---
Feels like this change is to restrict mining industrial activity.  If it was for good fights they would create a deployable thingy that jams local out.  You'd know something was going on but you wouldn't who or how many.
---
i can already see the "needs more purple" votes on zkill
---
That last sentence is not true. I've seen the new bots already, they set a cloaked ships by the gates of systems they wish to use, and the moment you jump in you have to decloak, even for a couple of seconds.   The new bots scrape that info and go warping to POS's.   So that did nothing to the bots.
---
They finally fixed local
---
Me and my wife are unsubbing 17 accounts....rofl
---
Just like the game is going to be soon enough. LoL
---
Lol chin here with his on point comments
---
Bring back the other dude, he sings better
---
That's exactly what the new bots do. Cloaked ships near the gates of the systems they wish to use. That few seconds you have to decloak, they scrape your name, ship type, and Corp.
---
Intel from these bots is far superior to player Intel...  It's detailed and instant.
---
If these are career milestones, why would they only be for ratting? Last I saw, there were achievements in the activity tracker for everything from exploration to mission running to belt ratting to PvP. And that's going to be perfect for increasing new player retention. Give them an incentive to try a little bit of every side of EvE, and let them find the part they like.
---
   That said, when has EvE been a sandbox in the past 10 years?
---
remove highsec burners
---
gg
---
&gt; gameplay, my only weakness
---
They did, the madmen did it!
---
Feels like it's targeting renters.  Easy targets made easier targets.  Not the way I'd go but...
---
Prepare the Stukas.
---
I think I'm starting to see the toxic attitude towards new players that's making them quit. Dealing with dozens upon dozens of social rejects like you is what made me quit after all - and I played for five years and loved the game
---
No no no! The haven’t played in years and THIS still pops into my head at least twice a month.
---
Ah the sweet excitement .
---
So eliminating local only to introduce a tool to get it back. Unless there are some limitations on this new supposed structure, then it's totally pointless to do this. It just adds a slight extra step and then it's all back to the old ways. What's the point then of killing local in null if you're just going to give null seccers a way to get it back by simply putting up another structure in each system that matters.
---
Also creates a gaping hole to hide giant response fleet on a bait rorq fleet.   So many possibilities.  
---
Now, where did I put that BLOPS?
---
It's not, the new Intel bots are amazing!  They sit a cloaked ship near the gates (because cloaking isn't broken) and as soon as you have to decloak, the bot scrapes your name, ship type and corporation...  Honestly the Intel is way better, contains ship types and is instant!  
---
Way more reliable than player Intel, so yes! Thanks CCP!
---
What is your content without the krabs?
---
Of course.
---
Could it be this is all to blap botters?
---
If so, that would seriously restore some health to the economy. No?
---
yeah but you see that's still fallible
---
you can blops people in without anyone knowing they came in
---
LOL Well Done
---
you realize your pvp ships come from pve right?
---
These match up to the activity tracker achievements, so most likely a reward for an achievement - get it once then never again. That said, there are achievements for pretty much every activity in EvE, including mining, ratting, PvP, exploration, travel, trading, manufacturing, etc., So this could encourage new players to try different sides of the game
---
Yeah I agree. I get tired of how loud he talks and rambles about shit, but at the end if the day, he takes out fleets. He kills, feeds, gets stalemates or finds nothing, but I respect him for leading us to something other than ratting and mining.
---
The new Intel bots are amazing!  They sit a cloaked ship near the gates (because cloaking isn't broken) and as soon as you have to decloak, the bot scrapes your name, ship type and corporation...  Honestly the Intel is way better, contains ship types and is instant!  
---
As someone who's sorta new why is this a good thing?
---
It's not, they're one-time achievements. They match up with activity tracker achievements
---
Have fun with that, when you're clearing sites relatively quickly, you leave wrecks all over the place.
---
Is forced PvP better somehow?
---
FUCK SNUFF.
---
Also, lol.
---
Be honest, cringe is all you are good for.

HAM*

There's no need to write the L on the end, everyone knows Heavy Assault Missile shooting tengus are ham tengus, ham raven, etc.
---
&gt; 100mn Lach?
---
I feel like the goal when ratting is to actually apply damage to the target, not to buzz in circles too far away from it for your blasters to hit, or too fast for your railguns to track it effectively, even with the optimal and tracking bonuses.

I think these days most people tend to have two because that's what the character creator suggests, but back in the old days one was more typical.

Praise be.

The Curse is basically a Gila with maybe 10% less tank/dps.

But since you're tanking pirates, just fit against them and be unkillable, until we show up.

Combat recon still shows on probes.

---
Are you mocking someone because they enjoy playing a certain way and because they are choosing to stop playing a video game after a change that no longer allows them to play how they enjoy?  
---
In my book if you don't have fun playing a game you shouldn't be playing it.
---
yeah 55% is the best possible return. It should also be noted that reprocessing should be done on location, or at least in proximity. Just recently I reprocessed 60k m3 trashloot and ended up with almost 300k m3 minerals...
---
No Eula was violated..... At the time....
---
Poorly thought out.
---
I can drop 1000 unfueld raitarus and break a region from a small corner with super captial coverage, then scoop them later at no cost.
---
They'll have to be quick to spot that cloaky Loki on dscan when it appears for a second
---
I am. They can still do those things. They just need to work together as a group, not an anti social krabber
---
They're good for getting in, melting face, and getting out solo engagements. No T3C puts out DPS like it. Unless I'm retarded which is entirely possible.
---
They did this to themselves.
---
Which is hilarious because Null Sec has been the safest place to be for a long long time.
---
Flying through Null is boring, usually never see a soul or if you do it's a predictable gate camp.
---
Flying through low/high sec will get your blood pressure rising because other people are *normal* and you don't know who is feeling frisky. The threat could be literally anyone, at least in null you know if it's not blue it probably wants you dead or is telling someone who does.
---
No we won't, don't tell him that. He might come back.
---
Could also be tweaked by flying any of the Concord ships. However it might be accounted as a little overengaged...
---
God damnit, bobby
---
wtf do you think i meant by "i am totally fine with the effect this could potentially have on the market"
---
That, and most bots will whitelist cloaky campers after a period of time, so it really doesn't matter if local is there or not.
---
Well, there are the drifter wormholes, but those are different that the attacks
---
No I’m saying if the attacks are going on in systems with wormholes?
---
Gate camps are back on the menu boys!
---
Sweet, jump in whelp ship, let it get boson'd, jump in hic, point, dread bomb. Please fucking do
---
What happens once all the krabs start to run out of isk?
---
I doubt they are correlary. There are tons of wormholes, and they are collapsing all the time.
---
Oh no, you have to push dscan now like you were always intended to do!
---
The absolute fucking horror!
---
No more F1 -&gt; Watch Youtube while occasionally peeking at your oversized local channel for reds!
---
The problem here is that if you were keeping score, Hilmar/CCP is still something like 99:1 in the bad decision/good decision department.
---
And you subtracted from it, making me better than you.
---
I'm not complaining that it does, simply responding to the accusation that null is safer than high-sec or that I expect it to be. That is factually incorrect
---
Suicide ganks and war decs are soooo much easier to deal with than having a blackops battleship drop 50 bombers ontop of you from no where lol.
---
if only ccp had a way to limit structures per system
---
whe where talking about getting some space so we get more fights, idk.
---
Muh domi takes 17 minutes to fully replace ;___;
---
as someone who hasnt played in years, whats "local" again?
---
&gt;force gameplay
---
holy shit
---
my man
---
Fucking delete this!
---
&gt;Personally, I liked working for nullsec. They gave us ships and anoms. We didn't have to do anything. You've never been out of nullsec, you don't know what it's like out there. They expect effort!
---
&gt;Personally, I liked working for nullsec. They gave us ships and anoms. We didn't have to produce anything. You've never been out of nullsec, you don't know what it's like out there. They expect results!

same and missing "All the above"  option
---
Flew a thousand km to meet my corpmates and drink beer all night.
---
Well someone just need to cloaky camp every gate to know the details of whos comming in and out of the system
---
Did you legit just tell me to not accuse you of having a blue donut hahahahaha
---
Oh I forgot wormholes have intel on the in game map to show how active they are.....oh thats right they dont
---
\m/
---
wtf
---
Big if true
---
You missed step 4.  If you don't have wrecks as part of dscan, the second a wreck pops up on dscan, you'll know, since the number filtered changed.
---
WhY wOnT Nc FeEd ThEiR tItAn FlEeT tO uS!?!?!?
---
No
---
Local going away is gonna be costly for ccp i think, i have 10 accounts 2 mains and 8 in ratting ships until i see how it work out i will not resub those 8. Its time to just pvp, though i do like an hour or 2 of ratting after work 😊 dont know why that makes me relax.
---
Good
---
Nah, but you can cyno in hundreds of guys instantly into a wh...oh wait
---
[Unfortunately it doesn't go very long unless the beak gets wet.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCKC-QVcVn0)

Laughs in freshly rolled Nullsec statics.
---
How long will it take a newbie with zero Eve experience to become competitive in PvP? I might have a guild of 10 from another MMO joining me, we generally play 12 hours a day, 7 days a week
---
Blue Abyssal Deadspace.
---
That and keepstars allowing super docking, anyone can get into a super and rat even with just one account, anyone can get into a super and feel like they have a big epeen dropping it in a home defence fleet, or single boxing a titan on an assortment of KS bashes.
---
There’s a reason the original creators of the game specifically forbade supers being able to dock.
---
YES YES YES YES FINALLY
---
Yes I do.
---
I might actually play this game again
---
True, but there are options such as wormholes dropping people into systems without utilising any gates, or conundrums facing bot creators such as if you see someone enter but not leave, what do you do? Ignore them? Did they log off? Are they cloaky camping? Did they exit via a wormhole?
---
Basically allowed you to see if there was anyone in your system and who they were.
---
Local changes might actually give me a reason to undock
---
Rip peasants.
---
Well, I never remember to insure my ships anyway, so I guess I can just ignore this, lol
---
Or rather it would, if it wasn’t wrong half the time
---
That's my first reaction as well. I don't have the time or the brain power to really put in what it takes to afford multiple carriers and multi-boxing VNIs was what helped me afford the blingy DPS ships my alliance brings to fights. Now I'm thinking I may just be limited to tackle and logi.
---
I still want to believe it's a good change, though. I just don't see how someone like me fits into it or how I'd adapt.
---
Ok this is fucking funny.
---
I’d rather have 1 PVPer playing this game than 10 risk averse nullsec farmers under a super umbrella
---
Fuck them
---
Holy shit I forgot how good that game was, time to reinstall.
---
picture funny, despite being entirely inaccurate; this is a good change for all and we're saying that..
---
A good Astero fight is probably the most fun 1v1 matchup, since it’s pretty slow paced. No other frigate duel will last anywhere near that long
---
You won't.
---
Prove it.
---
The number in the name is the 'size'.  In general:  
---
Smaller Size = Better Tracking  
---
Larger Size = Better Damage, Better Range  
---
Sometimes it is not possible to fit the largest gun to your ship and have to go with a slightly smaller one.
---
So many people in the forum "urrr I unsub now nope I win eve thanks ccp hurr durr"
---
Don't even try and lie to yourself, you ain't going nowhere
---
Call the Waaaaaaaaaaaahmbulance, we have a spodbrain with a critical case of butthurt!
---
Me, a wormhole dweller: you guys get local???
---
The last nerf says yes. Up.
---
Its an older meme sir, but it checks out.
---
DMed you
---
bye lol
---
I don’t feel to bad, I explore a lot, have been rolled up on in relic sites, exploration Astero should be sub-2sec, orbit/keep range 2100m, you can just cloak and warp away +90% the time.
---
&gt;Nullsec isn't a new player area.
---
Good, at least you are willing to admit you have no clue what you are talking about, there is nothing from stopping a new player playing in null except for having the balls to do it.
---
I've got ten bucks that says this makes a difference for all of a month and we're right back to the trash that the game is now. 
---
hint: asset safety and local isn't the problem shit even bots arent.
---
Pretty sure the price data is just incorrect and it's always like that on sisi, although I would love to see this happen.
---
Every system in delve will have supers sitting on it now..
---
*Spod.
---
Countless CSMs: "What we want..." *What I want...
---
Player-base: "Give us your soul or free sp!"
---
Vets: "Ahh, remember when...?"

Bitter Vets: "Blame it on CCP! - Nerf bats ahoy, WTG CCP. - It's just a graphical update... again. - Bring back the good ol' days!" 
---
Ex-Player: "The game lost it's mojo... - Dead Game. - I'd return but..."
---
**CCP: "Hold my beer"
---
Same though I usually just forget. And on T2 ships I never bother anyway.
---
Have you taken the price difference between SISI and TQ into account?
---
Shits have far less estimated price on SISI, therefore they will have a smaller calculated insurance payout
---
Fewer* rorqs.
---
uh, most goons i know... are really not upset about the local changes. we're only mad about the stupid drifter shit.
---
I’m not sure what this has to do with Krabs? I don’t rat at all but still buy insurance on things. Seems to me this is just another isk sink for CCP.
---
maybe, but the drifters will affect them as well when they try and hunt
---
Do not speak of the Omega Protocol! beezaz.
---
they have nothing we want... why would we take over space?
---
Yeah he seems in favour of it. I'm not bothered too much by it either although I will admit I don't rat and I'm an explorer so I do a lot of wormhole daytripping so it's not as spooky for me.
---
Good. There hasn’t been significant risk in null for a decade, if you think introducing some is unreasonable Dr.Stafford prescribes two tablespoons of cement so you can harden the fuck up.
---
uh, lol. you clearly have no idea how cap umbrella works
---
Even permanently, what do players like that provide for the game? I can’t see how this would be a bad change.
---
Well, without local, you’ll never know they’re there.
---
you die very frequently, with no counter other than to fly a super and drop titans and supers on em
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe%27s_law
---
Can i have your stuff?
---
Just curious, How are bots fair?
---
yeah skillpoint trading doesnt end the game at all its totes ok if day 1 retards can inject a titan. games totes fixed if citadels drop loot and bots can die!!
---
lol. you will be until you get hosed by drifters
---
Whoosh
---
Well, you do need a balance. Someone has to build the ships, and with appropriate risk, they can be content in space (even if they don't want to be) but there hasn't been a proportional risk in null in a very long time. If all the krabs quit it would be bad because shit would be super expensive. We need some to balance things out.
---
&gt; Omega Protocol
---
lol. new sig alongside theta?
---
That might be the point. Introduce chaos.
---
Exactly! I'm resubbing my meager 3 accounts. Getting the boys back together and roaming, burning, pillaging everything!!
---
Why stop?
---
Is it three weeks long?
---
I agree, but in reality even if this does crush retards / bots (doubting the ladder) aside from a couple funny killmails. We all know damn well because 1/3 of their pop are automated bots, 1/3rd user base drop shareholders will freak and they'll be doing an about face in a month (or less) .... sux
---
They already exist ... they are called Dreads. vov
---
You think the groups living there already haven't put in the extreme amount of work to make it what it is?

Blah blah blah blah something oversized guns something anti-capital subcapital

A dread has more dps, a jump drive and more survivability than a non-Blops battleship
---
Next uninspired player proposal
---
&gt;whining about big alliance
---
&gt;TEST flair
---
you realize test is like the #3 alliance in eve by members (horde #2 by about 100), and #2 by systems held.
---
Tbh if he does nothing but rat &amp; mine then its no great loss to the game and the economy will be better for it.
---
You almost went full Juggalo there fam :P lol
---
You can logoff somewhere in system, wait a few minutes, then log back in and the gate-bot won't see you. Free hunting.
---
Also wormholes.
---
if you krab an obscene amount of ore but dont want to/cant build capitals, building a fuckton of battleships and insurance frauding them is often the next best option because you dont need to fuck around with hauling a massive pile of ore to jita
---
Commisar0617,
---
By the laws of the Imperium, i find you unfit for doodie by thought, action and affiliation.
---
Your crime is general pubbie-ness, self-thinking, not reading the forum and being gullible.
---
All bad traits.
---
May the emperor forgive your sins.
---
**BLAM**
---
Actively attacking people equals a blue donut?
---
Your corp should be your concord.
---
Don't forget tear jars will climb up to the same value as injectors :)
---
With all the stuff happening, I've been getting the urge to stop winning eve again. Except instead of going back into a large alliance, id like to drag a few friends in. What's some good nooby group stuff to do?
---
I have probably missed something, and almost certainly have something in the wrong order. This is all the wars that I can remember TEST fighting.  
---
The war in Tribute with CO2 and other friends, ended when CO2 was evicted and we decided to leave while we were sort of ahead.
---
Stainwaggon war. Started in Jan 2017. Evicted an alliance which was unable to hold its space. Multiple regions fought over.
---
War in Catch. PL and friends came down to harass us, we fought them on and off for months.
---
War in Stain. We fought to keep Stainwaggon evicted by planting athanors on their moons.
---
Operation Bad Dragon. TEST invaded GOTG with some help from the DRF. I actually really enjoyed this war, even if it was interrupted by goons deploying here too, and ended much earlier than anticipated.
---
War with CO2. Things happened and we went to war with our old friends, meaning we had to come home from Operation Bad Dragon. I also enjoyed this war. There were a few fun fleets and even a good fight against a goon drake fleet. Sadly ended much too soon thanks to the Judge.
---
War with Triumvirate. Kind of an extension to the war with CO2. Phase one ended with their keepstar dying if i recall correctly. 
---
A few aborted "invasions" of the north that caused me to buy a Cerberus and then do nothing else. Does not count TBH, but I am still salty about that.
---
Provi war. Mostly PL claws getting smartbombed and HTP getting an awesome dreadbomb on SouthSide devils Titan. The rest was structure bashing and entosis. Not so much fun gameplay after the first week or two.
---
War in the South East. Mainly against FRAT to start with, although that was an on and off thing for a while. PL and friends eventually joined in, then Goons mobilised to attack the north. There was lots of fun fleets throughout. After UALX, their invasions momentum was stalled, and after a few more battles, was entirely blunted. Other things happened and then everyone across the game kinda signed peace treaties. 
---
Invasion of highsec. We got the TTT out of it, that was great. Lots of subcap brawls with domis and feroxes. Was a staging for...
---
The other war in the north. PGL made a weak attempt to justify the war with some questions along the lines of "They had this highsec market for 2 years, where did all that isk go?) Was a few fun fights imo, but never really went anywhere.
---
Finally, second war in the South East. Frat did a thing and we're back at war with them. Been a few fun fights, but kinda quiet.
---
Legit or speculation? That would be most excellent.
---
At least now if you enter via wh and are a bit lucky with the system you bypass their filters.
---
Skill injectors would be less of an issue if EVE didn't have a class of ships that are grossly overpowered compared to the rest. Nobody cares about people injecting into subcaps.
---
I am not saying this as a negative.
---
People on the internet invest inordinate amounts of time into some weird shit.
---
Mine was here all along.
---
Not sure why you're downvoted. Figured it was pretty normal. Super -&gt; Fax -&gt; Subcap in mainfleet -&gt; Dread/emergency cyno/cloaked dictor/ etc.
---
Same deal with Brave between our impass krabs and out catch pvpers.
---
&gt; Oh no, you have to push dscan now like you were always intended to do!
---
*laughs in force recon*
---
It's what I love about hunting explo ships.  They are hard to catch if the person is paying a small amount of attention. Makes it more fun to actually catch them.
---
Byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee :D
---
Can I have your stuff/wife?
---
Praise Bob! \o/
---
No one else would even undock, so only bots are gonna be making ISK anyway, meaning your optimism is unfounded at best and dumb at average.
---
Overview with only ships, reds and neutrals. Pixel reader on first line of overview ... voila.
---
They’re in every goddamn system. Well, the active/populated ones. 
---
A mechanic where an active pilot with a cloak will be near impossible to catch, as long as he keeps moving. But go afk and you get scanned down and killed. 
---
Everyone’s talking about force recons but even they’re vulnerable to probes.
---
FC what is SRP
---
No, it will be a buff to lowsec, because active players like local will move to lowsec for content
---
*ratter enters wormhole space* ... *instantly gets jumped by 10 cannibals in leshaks and gas their corpse deposited at the sun to appease bob*
---
"amarr ships need love."    
---
    
---
Some things never change.
---
Reading through those forum posts I'm pretty sure a solid 50% of people don't even know d-scan exists or have any clue how to use Intel channels. 
---
This is some high level salt.
---
Use "wasd + shift" to dodge attacks or just roll "spacebar" throughout the fights.
---
Making isk in Lowsec is a grind, I would hope null players would adapt by taking a slightly higher risk in a low class wormhole for a decent buff in income rather than downgrade to lowsec isk/h just for the safety of Local.
---
Delay the notification by 12 hours, reducable by expensive rigs down to 3.
---
Mad krabs
---
Praise Bob.
---
I'm a bit of both. Getting tackled from ratting and killing shit both gives me the shivers, so win-win!
---
Wait, you have a whole 5 seconds?  My epithal aligns in 4. I wait for the speed indicator to change to m/s and drop the stack I have hovering over my PI hold.  The Epithal is already aligning for warp as I hotkeyed a warp to the next POCO before I exited warp.
---
At least I've loaded system and scanned before they're alerted. That alone will make catching things so much easier.
---
I got got in a Prospect and my alt in a Venture in a Vital Core Reservoir, I read the probes on dscan wrong, didn’t think I was being probed, then the guy lands a dictor right on me, astero uncloakes, couldn’t even be mad.
---
This would explain the incoming reduced player counts.
---
when did eve have local chat as region chat?
---
TFW goons are fine with the local changes.
---
I try my best, just ignore the -10 sec status not  quite sure how that happened  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Aprove
---
Grab a PvP fit Ishtar, find a 0.1 or 0.2 system with a dozen of astroid belts, and get to town
---
You can earn just as much isk in (non-FW) lowsec as ratting in a carrier
---
Fastest way is to move stuff to the POCO while in warp to the first POCO.  The less time you are on dscan, the better.
---
Mocking someone because they don't enjoy playing the same way you do is pretty immature IMHO. I'm not saying the game should necessarily cater to them but mocking them for choosing not to play is kinda an asshole move.
---
My interpretation of AUGslave's comment was they were only suggesting the game would be better if pilots   who are upset by dynamic content like the drifter invasion unsubscribed. Cheers
---
Might want to take a look at the [number](http://wiki.eve-inspiracy.com/index.php?title=New_Eden_Crew_Guidelines) of people you kill every time you lose a ship
---
That's how PI works everywhere. Who doesn't do this?
---
I know I'm talking about if you're doing T2+ stuff. The best way I've found to do it is to have 2x launchpads so I always split my T1 stuff into 2 stacks so I can fill each launchpad. 
---
I just don't do it while sitting at the POCO, I do it all before.
---
I bet you are in CODE.
---
Have you played this game?
---
Cut it out with that entosis bullshit.
---
There is already stront in the fuel.
---
wouldn't have to be big, could be like a secure can.
---
It's not delayed, it's triggered by talking. You could sit in a wormhole until the end of time (current mechanics) and not show up in local if you don't say anything.
---
Well, I guess it will. But the main strength of a bot is that they don\`t lose focus 24/7, while ppl do.
---
After u load grid, lets say u are lucky and warp directly to ratter anomaly 10 AU away, it will take a ceptor like 8-10 seconds until it will be able to lock something (warp acceleration/deceleration) ... a BS with 2 inertia can do under that.
---
It will help a lot the logoff traps and wormhole backdoor with recons.
---
"You're a Monster! CCP!"
---
Beautiful.
---
Its almost like my argument wasn't about what modules a ship could fit either, huh funny that.
---
Blood gang!
---
That's what people keep telling ccp, but they don't seem to want to listen.
---
Pretty sure the payouts of insurance are based on the mineral value of the hull and the sell value of the hull. The sell value on the hulls after the full averaged market time they used to make the in game values on items always drops to 100 isk and they use that number for the insurance payouts.
---
I thought we were just complaining about 1000 titans killing the game?
---
Rorquals are sooo 2018.
---
I don't think you really understand what you are talking about enough to predict what will happen. Also, do you think null sec miners currently don't work together?
---
Hmmm recon, stratios or cloaky t3c... *cannot wait*
---
i mean for ref timers
---
Oh noo, they lose their little safety net.
---
No, entosising services provoked awesome fights because it was single cycle effect - entosis a cloning bay, and it shut off then and there. Defenders had to undock and counter entosis it or kill the attacker tonsave their clone bay. It was glorious, but then all stations became fortizars and so nobody can have fun now
---
Some one is mad that they cant have people having their back. I have a video for this

'fixed' doesn't mean good

i half read it.

i often keep an eye on it if i'm at my pc. i can never be fucked with the scroll back half the time, it moves too fast to try and read every single line in there.
---
risk of rain 2
---
thank GOD
---
To be fair - local didn't stop me undocking. it was the drifters.
---
i fear the drifters more than players. a player does shit dps and you can ec300 them and moonwalk out.
---
a drifter? you have no warning, they fuck you up faster than you can swap drones, and they are basically a guaranteed death sentence compared to another player warping in to your anomaly.
---
God dammit, my wife and I just resubbed 18 accounts between us! CCP is ISK positive!
---
You can use compare tool for them, look at: tracking and damage modifier values. What you end up using, it should be related to what you intend your ship to be used for.
---
I love this. Thank you so much for making it.
---
Positive reinforcement
---
Those mouthbreathers don't read reddit. They're all over on the official forums.
---
It's kind of impressive to see just how many null sec people are in fact whiney ass care bears... #waawaa #EveIsHard
---
SISI randomness. Because market value for everything is 100 ISK, insurance values it that way.
---
I dont krab, but I've thought for a long time about moving into wormholes. I think though that no local in null takes away one of the main things that makes wormhole space so much more dangerous and unique and cool. Why move into a wormhole now when I could just stay in null?
---
&gt; Fairly convinced that is half the point of this experiment.
---
ehhhhh
---
Even with local gone, I can't imagine that many people will be willing to leave the afk isk faucets of null in exchange for low.
---
True, but there could be interesting things to mitigate this like naming schemes programmed in and anything out of the norm triggers a dock.
---
This is the major 1, together with rorqual’s has had the biggest(negative) change in the game, bring back space coffins to make titans and supers mean something again

pros and cons to it.

I honestly love local,  i run into dudes I was in alliances with almost a decade ago now as enemies and get to have quick 10 second chats.     part of this game is the social aspect, and not always just the nerds on your fleet comms.
---
but there are lots of reasons to get rid of it too.
---
We have plenty of content. We fight each other for the sake of fighting each other, and the ones that don't get evicted.
---
You got this backwards my friend... CCP will cull numbers not boost them...
---
If you do, great. The problem is when massive nullbloc members pretend to care but just want their alliance to not have to deal with shit.
---
You're the kind of ratter I want to fight. The kind that will learn how to adequately tank and bring the fight to me when I tackle instead of minmaxing for tics. I've been killed by them before and of course threw out a gf because it was. 
---
If it was easy to take out ratters, I wouldn't want to do it so much. Dropping local is an advantage for both parties (except for those filthy curse pilots... Oh hang on... I am one).
---
Bruh.
---
What else would you bring... not sarcasm im seriuos. Supers are most effective, just look at null incursions.
---
Have fun with that.
---
Lets assume you will have a perfect intel bot via ESI. That needs every Krab to be logged into ESI every time and log out after he is done. Automated checks will show then discrepancies and warn the Krab, if ever Krab is disciplined enough to do all the steps.
---
You really think that will work? Let alone the option to show up via WHs within seconds and tackle within 1-2 minutes.
---
Question is how often ESI updates (i don't know but i doubt it will update every tick or even every minute) and if CCP will lengthen the update cycle when needed to fuck with an automated ESI tool.
---
There are hassles with owning a super? lul wat
---
No..no you didn't
---
Me likey
---
All triglav fleet- plus bombers.
---
Try using a PC thats not straight out of the 80s
---
I prefer to think of myself as a content beacon
---
If you can't work out how to tank long enough or sort your shit out to disengage honestly it's your issue mate. Noone is forcing you to krab or mine in null. It's part of the game, work it out or not.
---
You heard him, touch him!
---
yes.
---
Then the hunters get in fights with other hopeful hunters. It's still content! I welcome scraps with other prospective hunters and gate camps. Hopefully there's an uptick of hunters heading out to null getting stuck in my gate camps too. I like shooting at folk that shoot back.
---
all i've seen is people coming back in droves tbh
---
Hail Mittens
---
you think it will change something for rorqual &amp; caps ? no, umbrella will be always there &amp; vni, ishtar, machariel and other t3 will "inject/skill" for caps &amp; fax  
---
so this sub should enjoy the 2 weeks of hunt without local intel before coming cry because they only meet caps on field.  
---
PSA : yes! you can hunt in delve soon without intel but remember most of gsf sigs are very active, so prepare to be hunted too  
---
*like often ccp point the playerbase for their mistake*
---
A'prove
---
L5's are a pretty easy way to make great isk tbh
---
How is it wrong half the time?  I've been using it to scout out wormhole connections and haven't had an issue with it yet.
---
Because the mechanics are completely different. Being able to roll a nullsec and go anywhere you want within a few roles is pretty great.
---
&gt;Do you honestly believe people only play a game when another person tells them to?
---
I'm referring to the people who personally don't like the changes and are unhappy. Like the ones on the official forums saying they'll unsub.
---
It won't affect our/NC/PL/TEST turbokrabs because we/they have a kajillion/large number of tits ready to drop on a tiny notice, but it will affect everyone else that's smaller.
---
for real?
---
Yup, PL and NC fell way behind the meta. And now PH is the one left trying to pick up the pieces.
---
I wonder where you are going when you are made to painfully realize that the only krabs left are in tanky supers within range of fax-o-clock service. Good luck in hello kitty while I play a real pvp game, matey.
---
That's player fault though. So many people pushing the magic 14 on people way to New to benefit.
---
Lots of my old corpmates that have since quit are coming back. Big changes, but hoping they’ll be healthy! Love new and exciting challenges
---
Why not have fixed structure points like moons or planets etc 
---
Would stop there being structures watching over gates willy nilly  and make people have to make choices about what composition of structures they want in any given system.
---
not sure how many per system would be appropriate, maybe link the number to the system infrastructure like i-hubs tcu’s eg 
---
One problem could be what happens when the owner of the system has reached the cap it may reduce the ability for attackers to create a beachhead with a staging fort in system 
---
Getting a big fleet in through a gate when the enemy knows when to form for a timer may stop fights all together if the can seriously camp all the gates in 
---
Put it this way they need to try something but I don’t envy the devs job
---
There still wouldn't be.
---
But nullsec is intently not designed for new players.
---
If you really are going to take the position that nullsec is designed for new players, then I'd wonder what the hell game you're talking about, because it sure isn't EVE.
---
Hmm, maybe the Drifters that don't show up on D-Scan or in local could help with that?
---
The developers (CCP) are making a major change to the game EVE.  
---
In this game there are \~5,000 solar systems and each one has a chat channel called "Local Chat" that you auto join (and are then removed from your prior system's local chat) when you go into that solar system. Since the game's inception people would use this to warn themselves when an enemy player comes into their system - usually by clicking show info on any new people in local.  
---
The new change is that in the more "dangerous" solar systems on the deep fringes of space Local no longer shows someone's name in the channel - only if that person types something in that chat.  
---
Now people that used this as an intelligence tool are considerably more at-risk of being hunted or caught and as one would expect there are very strong opinions from the community on the matter.  
---
&gt;!As a sidenote I've been playing off and on for \~1.5 decades but am currently in a 4(?) year break. This change sounds so interesting as to "shake things up" that I'm genuinely considering buying a new PC and resubscribing.!&lt;
---
Your perception of how Goons operate is a bit off.
---
No, insurance payouts is based on the "base price" of the ship, which comes from material market data.
---
Most materials cost more than 100isk normally, so the base price on sisi is lower than in TQ.
---
\-LVL 5s
---
\-Burner Missions
---
\-FW Missions
---
You can make fine isk in lowsec
---
200 reds(dreads) in system. but you dont know that.  
---
moron rorqual gets tackled by a loki and cynos up.  
---
are you gonna jump that cyno?
---
that's some high quality intel right there
---
All of the salt is just makes me a little bit happier every time I read blackout related threads
---
Naw thats actually a blooper from one of the last videos CCP made

---
One thing people didn't quite touch is do not mix them.
---
Use all the same gun. You may think "oh it would be nice to have some fast tracking for smaller stuff and some heavier guns for big stuff" but all it really means is that you'll never have all your guns working together.
---
Best update ever and I am a Goon 😎
---
Those are just the exact same problems a player would face too.
---
that will transform your venture into a titan when you undock. This is why a lot of people say eve is pay to win.
---
I just got like 5 150mm railguns. Then lost it trying to go to a new corporation hq or something. So.
---
But wait, does that not describe many existing aspects of eve?
---
tbh, *if* i were running intelbots, id just use overview graphical recog, and output to jabber or something. idk. i don't bot tho. soooo
---
hey. i read the forums... weekly...
---
And can be done just now.
---
For the non-cheats, this is an improvement 😋
---
The who game is designed for new players, it just takes guts to experience it. Spineless cowards like yourself are of course exempt.
---
High level income in NS (Supers, rorqs, moons, etc) all beat low class wormholes by a mile.
---
Local has been fine for months 😋
---
Krabs don't count as people
---
will you be doing 40man or 20man raids?
---
Because zul'gurub was an underrated raid dungeon - but Blackwing's Lair has a special place in my heart, especially the suppression room.
---
Yeah, I'd love to see some more constellation based stuff.
---
Then we use less power and make Eve more efficient. Instead of needing a client running to scare people, you jump in to system was away then log off.
---
Now you can achieve the same 'cloaky camping' effect with a third of the accounts (repeat for each of 3 characters on each cloaky camping account) 😃
---
This is an environmentally friendly change!
---
That won't work. Hints WHs, some Recons don't show on Dscan. 
---
No local and no Dscan means you have to have an ESI tool that counts the "players" in system.
---
Press F for V button
---
thanks to local being gone, we can hunt them with ships!
---
I asked and they said that bot works sitting near wormholes as well.  One of the programmers said they are going to add the ability for it to launch a bubble on it's own as well if people planned on using a cloaked interdictor.
---
Eve’s server tickrate is once a second so doing literally anything more than once a second is usually pointless.
---
*wormholer btw*
---
Tarren mill allday
---
Do it
---
An old friend, like me
---
They use hex to communicate
---
Still not a reason for this bad design. Hitting button every 2 seconds doesn't take effort or skill, it doesn't bring any layers of depth with it. It's tedious, and EVE already has a fair share of tedium in it. Why should we have even more of it:
---
Am finding the game relaxing, if I just tinker with it for say 30 or so mins a day how long will it be until I start feeling that wall of where I will want to go beyond the F2P version?
---
The PvP doesn't interest me yet and some of the PVE missions and mining runs might be perfect for doing while zoned out.
---
I care about T1 vs. T2. So... 
---
yOuR ArGuMeNt hAs BeEn **DEMOLISHED**
---
Talking about good fights in 2019...
---
Pretty sure you can already build them in wormholes.
---
It's not like when you live in delve you don't give a fuck about local or intel, you just use cyno button
---
But don't focus exclusively on them.
---
Bjorn Bee would disagree.
---
And they detect people rolling in from a wh how exactly?
---
What kind of hourly wage can you get and how much plex can you get with it?
---
Get rekt noob
---
not when the supply decreases along with it.
---
I honestly dont know if you are trolling....
---
"I have thoroughly assessed your concerns and evaluated all your opinions. I have reached a conclusion..."
---
I don't know for sure, devblog mentions July so I assume it will be next Wednesday to the final Wednesday of July which is the 31st, for a total of 3 weeks. They do stuff on Wednesdays now so seems like the most logical time line to me.

You won’t have to spend more than 3 days “leveling” to get in a bare-bones t1 frigate. The difficulty you will face will come from obtaining street smarts. This may include
---
-becoming competent with hunting down ships using dscan 
---
-setting up your UI well
---
-how to not get baited
---
-how to not die to gate guns 
---
-how to be paranoid at all times
---
Eventually these things will be common sense to you. The single best way to lean eve is simple- get somebody to teach you the game, like a corpmate. If you want to find someone like this, head to eve university and you’ll find plenty.
---
&gt; did nothing to the bots.
---
well except that Alpha accounts can now almost be the equivalent of a cloaky camper.
---
once you are in their botting system they dont know if you are active or not.
---
Isn't structure-bashing PVE?
---
Plz skip over Brave and come to Delve instead. Plus you wont get to see any Titans in Brave space. The Goon umbrella needs more kill marks.
---
Like never? But have you bought your supply of soe combat probe launchers.
---
I have to agree on stellaris. It's a dope game i just recently discovered for me to.
---
Hunt for krabs in lowsec. Whatever kill you get
---
Might be insignificant, but once a noob tastes their first kill they’ll be hooked for weeks.
---
Check ebay for eveonline paper clips
---
We don't need intel to respond to drops. We already get 'suddenly 100 drekavacs' from a wormhole on a pretty regular basis, and this is no different really. We have a well practiced system to rapidly respond to any threat within the standing umbrella within seconds, regardless of the circumstances, and we can reset and respond to the next drop within 5-10 minutes after that
---
The only people that will die are the people that are hopelessly disconnected from alliance communications - ie the same people that die today. And trust me, no one gives a shit about them.
---
Alliances with no response fleet, or a slow response fleet, are going to have far more difficulty.
---
Your skills aren't going to train any faster with that sort of time commitment.  
---
It will depend on what kind of corp you join. If it's one that advertises by anchoring a container near a gate in a starting system, it's probably not one that you want to join.
---
drifters tear up regular caps pretty quick, and basically one-shot subcaps. So we just throw supers at them until they're dead. Supers can tank the damage just fine, and do enough DPS to clear them quickly.
---
"I've been playing this game for 10+ years and I'm going to unsub forever RIGHT NOW"
---
Please. If you can't even see how the game plays before quitting, just contract me all your stuff.
---
I've never been there. How does it compare to Tama?
---
The guy has very bad mental health issues. He needs help.
---
sure, but they dont do anything
---
As is the way of eve lol
---
Spoken like a typical fucking krab. Here's an idea: get out from the anomalies and try hunting and tell me how easy it is and how quickly locals will wimp out of a fight when you bring anything more than 4 or 5 dudes in a kitchen sink fleet.
---
Better ISK and more risk. Bear in mind that there's still wandering Drifter Response Battleships and still the persistent threat of people you don't even know coming from a system you didn't know was connected and fucking you up. It's more dynamic and differently paced than null, and the mentality is vastly different as well.
---
If you're still interested, MCAV is recruiting.
---
So when you plane is delayed..does it just take off without any one doing any thing,
---
For me, I would have a scout on the gate cloaked. In wormholes, if I am ratting in a system down the chain, we can roll holes to cut off excess connections and place scouts of the other side of the statics so we know when something is landing on the hole or if a fleet shows up.
---
Same principle here, though I still recommend ratting with two-three people and share the responsibility of watching the gates with alts.
---
Check the official forums "CCP don't listen! Unsubbing 3x10^8 accounts" etc etc
---
&gt;scouted gates
---
but it does turn every Alpha account into a possible "cloaky" camper.
---
they scout you coming into system, sure, then you log out.
---
any time you want you can log in that Alpha and hunt their ratting system.
---
also, turning off stargates in kspace if we're going for feature parity.
---
No, this is Patrick.
---
Well, you can build one side and have it sit there looking pretty. It's functionally useless, though.
---
&gt;the game is dying because the player count is going down
---
&gt;you won't be missed if you quit.
---
please, pick one narrative and stick to it. i'm confused as to which one we're meant to be following.
---
I thought we were calling The Olmeca Protocol? God damnit, Steve, where's the memo?
---
Two different narratives for two different groups of people.
---
well, that's all OP asked for, lol
---
Hookbills.
---
This will age well, like cheese kept in a shoe
---
Have you heard about our lord and saviour Space Violence?
---
The abundance of resources scales with the true sec (the -1 to 1 number related to security). WH space has a true sec of -1 so you can expect good abundance there. On top many systems have a good planet composition which means you can create all PI in one system. Especially WH systems with a highsec static are popular for such "industry" holes.
---
You can do PI in any security level but you will usually create less PI at the same effort.
---
&gt;Making isk in Lowsec is a grind
---
Not really. All you have to do is find a wormhole and suck the money out of its relic/data/gas sites.
---
Hes not really bragging about rmt hes bragging how much money hes spent on the game...
---
They are actually injecting in rorqs and titans....
---
or park an Alpha account permanently
---
Maybe try r/evejobs/ ?
---
No way in hell anyone can scout all the gates anywhere near as well as they can just watch local and report anyone that passes through.
---
When CCP still had a little bit of testicular fortitude, sure.
---
Please link any non-bait/non-troll posts with someone who lives in NS complaining about the change, I've not seen any.
---
Well, that's just how EVE goes.  
---
You get another ship and a brand new clone.
---
o7
---
yup...coward....lived in wormhole space, primary live in lowsec, done a carrier roam as the only carrier...
---
Come on, dude, you just come off ass butthurt when you make such clearly false ad hominem accusations.
---
DON'T TALK TO ME OR MY WIFE'S ACCOUNTS AGAIN
---
And you are saying people will just drop their supers on anything willy nilly? Especially when they have no idea what is lurking just out of sight? 
---
I see two possibilities with it. Supers will shrink their umbrella to systems they have good Intel for and only deploy normal caps outside of it. The second comes with bolder players, they deploy outside of an "Intel perimeter" and they get close to starting a battle like Asakai because they misjudged the risk involved. It wont work close to delve, but other regions? Quite possible. 
---
In all fairness, people will turtle up to a large degree, but many sub caps and even some normal caps will take risks they really shouldn't. They ignore warnings and get dropped. It happened, what felt like at the time, almost everyday when I lived in Malpais. Cloaky campers in system, Corp receives warning mail of campers, spod brains then ignore said warning, let out a bunch of rorqs or caps and promptly get slaughtered by a Bomber's Bar fleet, or even a T3D/T3C fleet. Heck, a month or two back my. Corp took out Confessors to kill a Nidhoggur and almost got it before the response fleet arrived.
---
Look at the official feedback thread
---
Not since stealth bomber nerf :(
---
WOW was the 1st MMO
---
Thats some spod right there.
---
My Google Fu sucks today. Anyone remembers how those things are going to work?
---
I only remember that they were supposed to be intl structures, and increasing their number in the system would improve the quality of info you would get.
---
Just re-subbed &amp; tryna get that chain fam.
---
keep talking shit you just sound more and more fake with every post.
---
I think that's probably more than a little bit of the reason behind this, as well as why they're using a lore angle to first have it drop. It's likely a test to see how income and isk flow changes when people using botting scripts/programmes can no longer use local as their primary source of information. 
---
That said, pvpers can't be everywhere at all times so it's difficult to truly see how much of an effect it will have until CCP themselves publish metrics, if they do at all. I think what it might do is force out some of the people who have wandered into null by way of "safe space" marketing to maximise profits, back into safer areas and naturally curb isk generation that way. 
---
In a addition to that, and I'm really going out on a limb here, it might force more localization of groups and cause a certain degree of tightening on Null sov borders as alliances won't have the time, advanced warning or even reach to properly counter issues in far removed regions of their sov. What this will do is anyone's guess, if it happens at all (we all know that EVE players always find a way to make things go their way). It is my hope, however that it opens up some of nullsec to smaller groups who are able to hide behind the absence of local and carve out a small existence for themselves.
---
Rorqs, titans, supers and FAX are all way too good compared to everything else in EVE, which is why everyone's injecting into them. I think carriers and dreads are more or less ok right now.
---
arent the prices related to the market in some way? selling everything for 100 ISK probably fucks with the equation.
---
i don't know for sure though
---
No thanks, I avoid the official forums like the plague.  I meant a post from a NS alliance leader, but I'll edit my previous post to be more specific.
---
That's not nessicarily a bad thing. If part of the reason is to curb the horrible state of eve industry, the fact is, most of the people 'unsubbing' 17 accounts pay for that sub time in Plex bought with isk. So it's not *nessicarily* a financial risk to CCP to make this switch. Doubly so I'd they thing that it might drive an influx of returning players who don't spam generate ISK in that way.
---
&gt; Force null sec to be what it should be.  
---
You mean you think it should be inhabited by uncoordinated dimwitted lions you can hunt as easily as NPCs to pad your killboard that no one but you looks at? Are you a dentist by any chance? 
---
If you want to hunt in nullsec you have to organize also, nullsec is not a canned hunt. 
---
Most hunting fleets in delve don't even try to go about it in a wise manner. They're like a grizzly randomly wandering into a town; It wanders through a few front yards and tipping over some garbage cans, it takes a look around and sniffs the air, wanders aimlessly between some houses with no real goal and even less of an idea of how to achieve any goal, which gives people plenty of time to call up their neighbors and flash-form a turbodunking supercapital fleet to nuke the bear. 
---
And every time the bear is turbodunked its reaction is the same; Utmost surprise that a town would turbodunk a bear, a bear that gave them plenty of time, and a bear that didn't even try to stop them from turbodunking.
---
Every weapon type has a short-range version and a long-range version. For hybrids, railguns are long-range and blasters are short-range. Within that, every type of turret has three variants, between rate of fire/tracking and damage. For blasters, this would be electron, ion, and neutron. Beyond that, there are faction and meta variants which are the same thing but better compared to a basic Small Neutron Blaster I and Tech II variants which require you to train more skills to use but are also better (and often cheaper than the top meta stuff and faction stuff).
---
It depends on what you're doing with a ship. So, for example, my corp, EVE University, has a fleet doctrine based around Merlins. As soon as the scout has tackle (not before, because we can easily bring numbers that make any sane person dock up when we appear in local), we show in, get to extremely close range with neutron blasters, and dump Caldari Navy (faction) Antimatter Charge (short range, high damage) into the target. Doesn't really work for taking on frigates in comparable numbers, but if we can find something in the low-sec areas where we bring these fleets, it's dead. I've been on a few killmails worth several times the value of my entire fleet (and the victim's response in local is often hilarious, especially when someone accidentally links the killmail in local instead of fleet chat). And, since basically everybody who plays the game uses our wiki, you can easily find this doctrine and a lot of explanation of how it works (and some of the same stuff for other doctrines which use different weapon types).
---
Laughs in cyno ceptor. (You can buy a lot more of them!)
---
People deserve to be mocked for hiding under the coat tails of a coalition super fleet- while doing absolutely nothing to help maintain that space. Rorq mining 24/7, logging off during strats is selfish. They can cry all they like about "raising ADM's" or "making Tax income for alliance" - They're dirty krabs and can do that in highsec instead. Everyone is a combat pilot first. End of story.
---
Cloaked campers are just a trick to exploit local and people's natural risk aversion to drive down activity in a certain system. Without local, there will be no need to cloaky camp in the way we're used to. You'll never even know they're there...most of the time.
---
Originally the concept was to differ the effect based on the amount and placement of the arrays in the system. The more you have the more "strength" and functionality you have.
---
Well, you can ask around. I've been gone from EVE for a while, but I know some people here still know me.
---
Well, we could have stopped them from killing the athanor, but since it was a neutral citadel, we went for a common goal.
---
Might as well convert all NS to WHs and allow jump gates to work throughout all of it.
---
All I see on there is people complaining about drifters and supporting local removal as far as any higher ups matter
---
Early 20th century naval developments. The Dreadnought battleships were distinguished by their primary battery being nothing but big guns of the same size, rather than a primary battery of various sizes. Because it gave this great advantage. This came about because of improvements in fire control technology allowing for reliably accurate shots beyond the point blank range (the range at which the shot is not significantly affected by gravity, so the gun can be aimed directly at the target, as if the projectile would fly in a completely straight line).
---
With how naval developments of the time are paralleled in the game, you'd almost expect the major powers to at some point start stockpiling really big ships and have everything being based around who has more of those...
---
That's because it is.
---
No only to Jebediah Kerman. So he can blow them up on Eve...  :)
---
I have no idea what you just said.
---
Low is mostly empty space - better get into the outskirts of any major null coalitions where you actually find content and do not need to roam for hours.
---
Also no gateguns!
---
If OP is a bittervet oldfag like I guess, he can anchor a bubble or so (Interdictor) for a proper gate trap and can secure kills for his bros.
---
Nothing is as tiring and frustrating as searching Low for kills, better gank some Retrievers for shits 'n giggles in high then!
---
up until 24 hours ago, it was clear CCP was moving the game in a certain direction
---
if they stick with local removal the game will be actually worth playing for so many people, local existing was the biggest blow to small groups ever
---
i play for 5 years and made no friends in eve. For me other players are just NPCs with a really advanced ai.
---
Yeah but the guys who just want to mine and rat and skill up rorq alts in relative safety will just stop buying skins for their alts/injectors for them. 
---
If people stop playing, it's not just subs they stop paying for.
---
You need to read into a lot of informations outside of the game.
---
If you bring a 10man gang you can be "competetive" asap but keep in mind EvE is n+1 so expect to get dropped by Supertits or some shit, especially if you're close to any bigger null Alliance staging system.
---
Its best to get small ships (wich is also great since you can quickly train into them) like Assault Frigs, T3 Destroyer, Interceptor and Interdictor.
---
jokes on them, curse as a drone boat for ratting can be scanned down lol ..
---
i've looked at some of them, and there is one guy in goonswarm posting on every single one of his alts about how he's unsubbing
---
the only reason I know is cause i know the guy
---
At 350m/hr a c3 rattle makes fairly solid isk, even compared to carrier ratting.
---
With one account, c3s beat Rorqs, with two they're on par with supers and with a few more you just run c5s. With dreads you make a few billion per hour
---
Hey now I'm really professional ship blower upper myself. https://zkillboard.com/character/94615654/
---
yeah, maybe something like that
---
I'd rather a more chaotic nullsec with action- attracting more PvP players- over stale, overpopulated rorq fleets doing nothing but watch their wallets go fat. It's the same stagnant lack of action that lead to serenity dying.
---
More things boring for the coward Krabs who refuse to undock for fear of.... Of... **Ship losses**
---
Except they have a cyno and a fleet of 10 bombers for whenever they feel like checking the system they just log on, cloak up, find you and nothing to be done about it except have a cyno of your own
---
you really dont understand what 150+ bombers can do to a ratting super when they decloak next to it and that people dont have problem sacrifice a bomber and trade it for a super :)
---
lol,
---
I just saw this post and you beat me to it:(
---
I was about to right the same thing
---
I find that really attractive, but hole rolling seems like a pain in the ass. I guess I'd have to see some pros do it.
---
Rorqs were nerfed pretty significantly weren't they? Also a titan is literally the Endgame ship, I don't mind them being a bit OP. Having to drop a ton of dreads on a super to kill it makes sense. Same with supercarriers being a bit OP, I'm not of the mindset that a couple of subcaps should be any issue whatsoever for a super, or even a carrier in most cases. They should take numbers and a coordinated effort to bring down, or a handful more specialised ships - like a gang of leshaks.
---
What do you mean by "differently paced"
---
Dude werent you supposed to unsub yesterday, sup with all the screeching?
---
very pretty
---
there s also always the possibility that ccp will do something about j space as well, in the aftermath of the  nullsec bash, so we might be seeing some stuff developing in whs too :)
---
just re subbed to his account great guy and vids
---
All
---
2 ppl didn't get the meme, its okay
---
Rat with your cruiser and get a dread, and 500 of your friends do the same, then get CCP to reinforce the system you're going to dreadbomb so you kill one titan every gun volley.
---
Don't tell everybody!
---
What about a wormhole stabilizer structure which will permanently stabilize a wormhole of your choice until the structure is destroyed.

i watched it on twitch, was too late for me to form on stuka fleet but it was hell of a fun even wathcing it. DBRB's reactions are priceless and he's laugh is contagious. This guy should do standup comedy outside game :))
---
https://twitter.com/TheMittani/status/1147276785706557442
---
For reference :)
---
no - i've never said i was unsubbing.
---
i said i was going to play the witcher 3 that i brought the other day in the steam sale. which, i might not, i'm not getting on with the game particularly well. while the combat system in 3 is much better than 1&amp;2, i'm still not taking to it particularly well, i find it a bit slow and clunky.
---
I want to believe it's a shitpost. But the more I read it, the more I think it's just a shit post.
---
do you actually use whs to grind or just regurgitating posts? 
---
yea its comparable with super ratting:
---
1. once you found a hole that has enough sites of the proper type
---
2. have rolled it shut
---
3. you are able to scan uninterrupted for an hour or two
---
4. new sig? better safe up
---
5. mass will only allow dread ratting in the home hole which means you re aubject to its regen which is shit
---
6. secure the loot (without your loot ship getting ganked)
---
7. export the loot (finding a kspace pipe) without getting ganked
---
8. the loot stays safe in your citadel even of you deciddd to take a 4 days break around your vuln timer
---
once these are fulfilled then yea idk the rest is equivalent to super ratting
---
meanwhile ns ratting means you get on undock and start ratting, the money is gained immediately in 20 min batches.
---
I re-subbed - I quit because I used to print unlimited isk in nulsec and that was boring as hell (in my hel)!
---
Less gate camping, more dog fighting. Everyone who's spent some time in Amamake has a great story to tell.
---
What is the reason that prevents people who dont like "No local" from Just moving to low-sec?
---
Or is this complaining for the sake of complaining?
---
Unless you are a hisec miner who feels entilted to perfect safety and moved to null, now your little shotshow is at risk.
---
I'll have to take a fleet out there and check it out.
---
Don't worry, we replace all the quitters with the people who are coming back.
---
I haven't belly-laughed this early in the morning in quite some time
---
Yup I have so much isk from null and I didn’t even carebear. Between fleets and running the alliance I didn’t have much time for that. The issue is sov became to cushy and easy. It needs this reset button if you will to shake it up.
---
They would have to leave their alliance and friends, go live in a totally different place and probably make considerably less money. It's a pretty big deal.
---
So does.
---
It's subjective, but I think you can get at least a good month or so before you hit the wall, depending on what you do. Explorers tend to hit it first as they discover how useful a cloak would be.
---
I haven't logged in since Odyssey/Rubicon and I'm enjoying it as well!
---
Drifters have wormhole stabiliserz.....
---
Nothing. But usually people choose to live in a certain kind of space because they like the mechanics there. Lowsec has gate guns, no bubbles and so on. Most NullSecers prefer the null mechanics.
---
The other thing is that many don't believe that the hopes related with the changes will come true. I for example believe that no local helps bots but people will notice them less.
---
If you want to rat, mine, salvage or PVP - well that is your answer now pay our wages and shut up!!!
---
Couldn't agree more and was looking for this. Not being able to dock supers needs to be a thing again. 
---
Dare I say it gets extended to carriers... no no no. Crazy.
---
I guess that's fully up to you. Maybe turn omega when you can't train anything as alpha anymore?
---
I have next to 0 low-sec experience so excuse my questions.
---
Are there no Mining anoms? Or is the ore/moons/pve Sites Just less valuable?
---
Isnt there low-sec space next to null so an alliance can Cover both?
---
The game is dying because the ACTIVE player count is going down. You wont be missed because all you do is krab and add nothing to the game.
---
im thinking this would buff lowsec as most moon miners will relocate there with rorqs
---
npc null will see itself revamped as strategic storage area. 
---
hs jump midpoints and direct access systems will hold again huge strategic importance.
---
hisec will see an increase in incursion/fob runners
---
nullsec will be home to a few large entities that cam afford the sov holding and the drifter deterrent in small superdense pockets.
---
remove/nerf asset safety and add resource scarcity (to have people move a bit, kinda like whs constellations work) and everything will be great again: caps and supercaps will be hard to get by, t1 hulls will see an increase in use, blingy stuff will no longer be commonplace (running escalations in blind will be super hard), tank levels will subsequently drop compared to damage levels which will make more ships go pew. Eve will be reborn!
---
The default answer to this is: I'm playing for years now and am still bad so it doesn't matter if you joined late ;)
---
I like that channel.
---
all people are doing is moaning they can't catch krabs, so if krabs add nothing to the game and we remove them all... what exactly are people going to be hunting?
---
Here I was thinking nullsec fights are the only reason left that people even discover this game, I must have missed the articles about the massive veldspar mining operations that saw 4000 miners all trying to get the last rock in highsec as concord bravely fought off the evil code from blowing you all up
---
Or die
---
Yeah idk man I don't think you've ever dread ratted your home hole. Two dreads two cycles a site for 500m avg if you aren't shit. You can't run forever because finite sites, yet it's enough for me to plex 20 accounts running for a few hours a week
---
CCP's policy as regards wormholers has generally been to alternate between pretending we don't exist and desperately trying to make it so.
---
In all seriousness, I do hope so as well. The main benefit of wormholes is that they were never designed to be lived in in the first place, and that hopefully gives CCP plenty of leeway to add newer and even harder content to wormholes. I look forward to full-on drifter hive awakening and roaming drifter fleets.
---
Drifters .... where have you been the past few days
---
so people who really hate krabs are going to... start krabbing?
---
They're less valuable and it's much harder to defend the space you live in, so you have random dudes warping through all day. You can't place warp bubbles there so anything with a cloak or a good align speed is uncatchable.
---
I assume you mean to a wormhole, but it’s a pretty complicated thing. This isn’t meant to be a full list, just some of the main things. 
---
1 - scarcity of content, you can play without local, but the amount of holes and the population of WHs makes fleet combat more rare than null. 
---
2 - requires leaving alliances that can basically be like family. 
---
3 - WH living comes with its own challenges (finding holes to get freighters / other large ships out of to restock, for example) 
---
4 - you can’t cyno in WHs so it makes the idea of invisibly hot dropping dreads / caps, inexistent.
---
The funniest thing to come out of the last month of changes has been importent HS children desperately trying to pretend NS is crying over everything when the only complaints out of null have been some grumbling about the tedium of dealing with a big PvE event in the middle of their PvP shit.
---
You guys waiting eagerly for Mittens to have a meltdown are just setting yourself up for disappointment.
---
But then people who have quit the game or live in HS and WHs won't have anything to circle-jerk over and live vicariously through.
---
Ccp is about to make Bank on resubs.... People have been complaining about this shit for sooo long
---
(wormholer btw)
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Take a look at wormhole space. C5 krabbing is pretty much the 'standard operating procedure' for making ISK. Its a lot of ISK, and you usually make the ISK worth of your ship back after a short time. But there is quite a lot of danger; if you run sites in a Dread, someone can come on top of you while you are in siege and kill you if you don't have the support. If you are in subcaps, a group can find the way you came in and try to stop you from leaving and force a fight, or tackle you while running the site. However, you are likely going to get a fight out of it. Either the dread fights or the subcaps fight.
---
I think this is the most balanced way of playing the game; you can make isk, you can make it safer by rolling holes etc, but at any point someone can come in and force you to take a fight. A real fight too. Dreads fight back, leshak / nestors fight back.
---
The problem with nullsec is primarily that its risk free; its too easy to not worry at all about dying. A change like this makes it harder to krab it complete and utter safety; but you don't need to be in complete and utter safety to make isk.
---
Then we eat krab meat
---
Balanced
---
&gt; The problem with nullsec is primarily that its risk free; its too easy to not worry at all about dying.
---
of course it is, because the reward is shit.
---
A lot more ragepings and few, if any, long formups. Because you don't have set geography and your corp/alliance realistically only holds one system at a time, you don't get advance warning of fleets roaming into your space. So wormhole engagements tend to be a lot of "get on and let's do this!" and not a lot of "enemy fleet six jumps away, we have fifteen minutes to form.
---
This might just be MCAV, but there's a much different mentality towards PvP as well. We take fights basically no matter what and we don't care about the KBs. It's a point of pride that one of the foremost criticisms of us is that we ["take too many fights"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c1f9za/most_competent_wormhole_groups/erd9vj7?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x). A lot of wormhole corps have this more open mentality on PvP, where it's about getting as many fights as possible and having a good time rather than krabbing and docking, and this is largely because PvP can happen essentially at any time anyways.
---
A myrm takes 2 ticks to be isk positive. I doubt people will lose 1 myrm every 40 minutes even with this change.
---
My questions were more concerning the possible Changes to null sec. But thank you for your Insight into WH space!
---
Was local something that use to not be in the game? Genuine question.
---
Falcon punch :)
---
I'll take a shot at this one.
---
Less members in a corp than a null corp traditionally.
---
A lot more emphasis on player generated content, members scanning chains, scouting, looking for things to explode.
---
If you only F1 monkey you have a steep learning curve.
---
No shitposting in local.
---
Spamming Dscan every 5 seconds will become ingrained in your muscle memory.
---
If things go bad, the few members count more, and you need to be more active defending your home.
---
Null sec - " I miss when null sec was hard"
---
CCP - "Null sec is now wormholes"
---
Null sec - "surprised_pickachu.jpg"
---
No Bubbles at all? So No dictors?
---
By docking Up you mean NPC Stations right? Are there many of these?
---
3 supers deal with drifters easily,  mostly the rats warp around the grid erratically and must be chased (but cannot be probed). Still gating anything bigger than a frigate makes you a potential Tyranos killmail. Even day one injected Rorq with T1 tank can survive the initial wave.
---
I resubbed a few days ago. I still havnt done anything ingame, but I feel like this is "I was there" moment Ive been waiting for.
---
Thank you CCP! Сжечь их всех!
---
Yea well its all comparative. In wormhole space you're risking a 3-4 billion isk dread to run a site. Maybe it gets blown up every three to four months. You've definitely made more than what you spent on it. 
---
In the same line, nullsec rattlesnakes are worth 500mil possibly. If you lose one every three to four weeks, you've also made your moneys worth.
---
There is another part of this that you're missing; A prerequisite for owning space is being able to defend it. Nullsec does an excellent job at defending itself from large-scale territory grabs that nullsec is used to. But when it comes to guerrilla style warfare theres nothing to interact with. Structures have timers that people can form up for days in advance. Forcing people to HAVE to fight the 3-4 man roaming gangs is something people think removing local will do because its more interactive and more enjoyable for everyone.
---
I think you do make an interesting point in regards to risk vs. reward. It would be interesting if half of nullsec had local deleted, but that half would have 25% higher bounty payouts and the other half that does have local would have 25% lower bounty payouts to make people more interested in risking it without local.
---
Really itll just be more gilas
---
"Im not undocking and unsubbing until"
---
HNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNG the grammar
---
There will be no more AFK cloaking in null...
---
what times to live in
---
yes, dread ratting in home will make you "some"money. you can even one cycle with three dreads if you warp in  right iirc. However it scales pretty bad. Null ratting scales indef, that s what im saying. 
---
Also you need to be alone in your ratting hole as it can t support your corpies ofc - null does not have this issue. 
---
So wh is ok if you rat for a few hours each week by yourself. Null is ok if you rat for a few hours each day  or mine for more than a few hours each day.
---
&gt; All you elite pvp types need to remember that it’s the carebears, miners and industrialists that are the motor of EVE’s economy. Without them, who will build your ships? Who will supply the materials for it? Who will provide the fuel for your structures? What will it do to alliances taxes that fund SRP? Without prey, the hunter dies.
---
Lmao. I love how the guy thinks you're either a pvp'er or carebear and definitely not both. I'll build my own ships tyvm.
---
As all things should be?
---
SHUT
---
It's based on mineral costs, and I don't ever remember SISI prices being this low, probably because the data comes from before the mirror.
---
It will easy to find TEST. They never shut up in local.
---
Honestly this probably depends on region, I'm in brave space, and small skirmishes, rorq kills and save fleets are pretty common. There isn't a significant lack of action that I've noticed, and while some players own supers or Rorqs, the vast majority do not. 
---
It does seem that these changes will affect opportunity to generate income though. How can you rat or mine if drifters come to say hello. As a new player trying to make money in null, you're absolutely fucked if drifters show up, or if you forget to d-scan while using a woefully unoptimised ratting ship now vni's are gone, or while mining in your newbro venture. And as for other players, controlling fighters while spamming d-scan for anyone who's gonna cyno in a 100 kiki fleet or caps of their own every ten seconds isn't exactly fun. Especially if drifters melt battleships and regular carriers pretty damn quick, and can't even be d-scanned.
---
While a more dangerous null is something I can support, I don't agree with drifters being practically instant death to anything bar a super, and I think the "we're going hunting" spammers will soon realise there's fuck all to hunt apart from each other and drifters, and supercaps will probably still send them home via pod express.
---
So, from what I understand, does this make passive mining incredibly risky now? Now those miners will have no advanced warning if any hostiles, and can’t just set up a mining routine and go to sleep. 
---
The economy will be affected, but a wily Corp could take advantage of the chaos and decimate a rivals ability to mine.
---
He is really god damn ugly.
---
Applying the logic of current hunting tactics to a post blackout Eve. We've got a live one folks.
---
no
---
The game is incredibly difficult to balance, at least they are trying something and i would cut them some slack.
---
Probes show on dscan.
---
&gt;Also a titan is literally the Endgame ship
---
Not with skill injectors they aren't. We've literally seen week-old characters in Titans before and we won't stop seeing them anytime soon.
---
IRONMAN wormhole btw
---
What else gives similar tax money?
---
&gt;Unless the way we utilized space and actually are capping that more often little will change.
---
Or, alternatively, made holding on to large areas of underutilised space non-viable and forcing players to actively use and maintain space or else abandon it and let others move in.
---
Like, say, adding pressure from NPCs that forced large null entities to actively defend their structures, threatening them with losing stations to overextension.
---
:thinking:
---
Honestly tho, what big oppressive group actually is shitting on small alliances?
---
Every small group that struggle to survive ends up joining some coalition and becomes a grain of sand on the beach.
---
The player base representing ‘small groups’ is very small and hide under the rock when anyone enters their little lowsec/nullsec pocket. So yeah it may affect them, but to the extent you’re saying.
---
Besides that point, when goons moved their super fleet up north, it was very obvious they moved, when PL moved their super fleet to get trapped in UALX, it was very obvious and local chat wasn’t needed to see such power moves to see.
---
That still requires a player to find the wormholes.
---
Didn't they already nerf the application of capital-sized weapons on supers?
---
How does that matter?
---
imagine all the current null ratters playing 0.1 isk games with the LP items, give it a week and the prices are down
---
You said that about the Drifter changes.
---
Then the Mittanni opened his mouth and endless Goon spergposters spewed onto r/eve.
---
I always thought it was a gonna be a pain but its really not once ya get the hang of it. Can have a hole closed in a couple minutes if you have enough people/toons so you dont have to wait out polarization.
---
Whether or not your joke was intentional, it was still amusing.
---
Time to resub
---
Maybe you are a spoiled prat?!
---
How many Supers do you own? How much ISK do you posess?
---
For me, starting a new char is fun. Getting the max out of an alpha is a challenge. 
---
I started a new account last week.
---
Hello, 
---
1. I'm pretty new player (like 1 month) and till now I've been doing explorations ( non npc data and relic sites)
---
What I really wanna start doing is deal with Combat Sites, but the problem is I don't really understand what should I choose for them. I'm an Alpha. I know that most of you will say like "There is no particular ship to use about CS", but for example can you like give me your ship and fit, so I can try it ? I accept any advise for CSs - about ship, fitting, which CS should I go into and which shouldn't and any other advices.
---
2. Can you advice me about fastest way to earn ISK on Alpha ? Is it gas sites, combat sites, relic and data sites, mining ?
---
Thank you in advance,
---
Yours
---
Deyan
---
&gt;We've literally seen week-old characters in Titans before and we won't stop seeing them anytime soon.
---
This is fairly rare. 
---
&gt;Not with skill injectors they aren't.
---
And this applies to literally any aspect of the game. Everything else is easier to train into than a titan?
---
So much this. We had a fight with some guys that jumped into our hole, they jumped dreds through knowing they couldn't get them back out. No one cares about their kB just having a gf
---
Scanning for wrecks only helps you find force recon krabs. As far as I’m aware that is not actually going to be anything but a meme, so there will be no point in wasting time hunting for them. 
---
Like I said, if it actually does start happening, I’m sure people will try to counter it, but I really don’t think it will
---
You can have 50 dudes on you in j-space as well
---
probing, everchanging neighbors and gameplay with your corp VS living in a region you know and defend with gameplay in your coalition
---
So much nuller blood... So many dead krabs... It's going to be glorious
---
Please link where I said we were fine with the drifter changes.  Thanks.
---
I don’t actually know what you are asking
---
krabs are in fact a part of the "ACTIVE" player base, the people who post never log in aren't though... without crabs there would be no gank fleets, no territories to defend... nothing... but hey lets call crabs useless leaches, because they certainly don't create the ships that you fly, the stations that you spin you ships in, the economy that powers everything in the game, yes fuck the crabs!
---
Nullsec without local might not be "worth it"?
---
your understanding is a little basic
---
when you're entering an area with a small group of people, or blops in, everyone in that coalition knows who is there, and how many immediately, which starts the clock of a response before anything even happens. it also alerts everyone in the area, driving away anyone paying attention to their game
---
why would anyone want to smallgang roam an enemy's space when you're likely going to get blobbed before even being able to score a kill? Sure, you might end up luckily scoring a couple of kills, but that's not regular. The only people who successfully do things like this either put in waaay too much time, have blue spy alts, and/or are picking the lowest hanging fruit.
---
So, to answer your question:
---
&gt;Honestly tho, what big oppressive group actually is shitting on small alliances?
---
It was CCP.
---
Perfectly
---
No one is going to make an official announcement until they can see how things are playing out. Like with the drifters, even Mittens didn’t make his speech the day they launched
---
Not for much longer, judging by some of the stuff CCP has been putting out.
---
lol nope
---
I don't think there's any point trying to talk sense into people tbh, "krabs are cancer of the game" that's the motto here, even though those exact krabs are responsible for running the entire fucking game, but hey L33T hunters got to L33T...
---
When you see yourself in OPs meme but aren't ready to admit which one you are...
---
Why all the bling?
---
At least for guristas, you could active shield tank one with a t2 large shield booster and t2 adaptive invuls and do havens no problem
---
So if I'm understanding correctly, now is absolutely not the time to start logging in again?  You can't really rat anymore in null since drifters will kill you in anything including supers, and any assets you have in null are probably going to be asset safed to LS (due to hostile NPCs killing all your citadels) where you won't be able to recover them due to hostile NPCs (because there's a different NPC threat in LS now?).
---
Sounds fun but unless you have a stockpile of stuff in not NS/LS is there any way to participate?  Sounds like no.
---
paws button :))) pause the paws :)
---
That’s fine but these idiots are acting like NS is opposed to any change to local at all and that isn’t the case.
---
and then, when they start getting shit on for being "krabs" they will finally understand who they were shitting on that long time ago...
---
PL is a shadow of its former self and hardly worth a mention these days PH is the only thing holding up Panfam
---
Eh... Any decently fit ratting super should have the buffer to deal with a LOT of bombers until backup arrives in like... 10 seconds.
---
Add stront to citadel reinforcement timers. Drifters rarely attack citadels, and when they do they attack low power ones
---
Observatories: Restores Local in the system (Can be attacked by drifters)
---
No damage cap, no reinforcement timer. Anchor time 2 hours.
---
1,000,000 EHP, must be anchored &gt;1,000 KM from a celestial, structure, upwell structure, mobile depot, anomaly, etc
---
Cost: 600m in [whatever citadels are built from], warp disrupts anything that attacks it for 20 seconds (like citadels do), upon reaching 75% HP and 25% hp messages are broadcasted in local asking for help
---
\#Already replaced
---
That should probably worry you, at least slightly, this Marketing move seems like something rather short-lived, so there will be "disruptions" in local for a week or 2 and when enough subs are gained they just revert everything back to normal... it's a trap, calling it now...
---
Cool battleships needed a nerf overdue
---
I'm still on the fence but I must say this has made me consider resubbing more than anything.
---
It only hurts the little guys tbh...
---
Rorqual and Super / Titan ratting wont stop with just that. Guys run their anomalies without problem even if there is a hostile gang in system. For a **proper** fitted Super or Titan you need some Dreadnoughts (not just five *lul*) and it takes some minutes to die so there is still time to respond.
---
Mind a **proper** Fit, shitfit Hyperspartial Nyx with 1,8mil ehp dies in seconds.
---
But if you tacke an Avatar or Aeon with 50-60mil ehp thats gonna take a while.
---
In the Capital branche nothing much changes, just subcap guys are kinda fucked. I don't know. It certainly helps against bots tho so thats a given.
---
sovereignty, consistent sustainable system density, better logistics, afkable $
---
Not really. With how easy scanning is, I can’t imagine a bit having a hard time doing it.
---
welcome back loki
---
Even without local, carrier ratting isn’t too dangerous if you have a cap fleet on standby. Super ratting is even less dangerous, since you can’t be tackled by anything cloaky. 
---
Those playstyles will just keep on doing their thing. They’ll die more, but isk will be worth more with all the subcap ratters gone, so it balances out. And the requirements to get set up in a wormhole are too steep for most people who rat in subcaps. You need multiple alts for rolling, loot trucking, and usually you have to multibox the sites too. Most human VNI pilots can’t afford that, or they wouldn’t be in a VNI at all.
---
Krabs are not the problem. Krabs that do nothing outside of log in, mine, and log off are the problem. 
---
The economy is more complex then you think it is. If everyone in delve stopped mining, producing ships, the price of those goods would skyrocket and it would suddenly be more worth other groups times to invest in that, and someone would take its place. 
---
"Without krabs there would be nothing to gank" right now, local results in there being nothing to gank. "No territories to defend" the territorries people krab in are defended by the inherent features of the system. The cap umbrella prevents territorial conquest but local prevents guerrilla warfare.
---
I don't know a whole lot about low-level combat sites in HS so you're gonna have to experiment a little bit, but you can use something like this as a starting point:

You won't be able to use a lot of those mods, especially the drones, so just swap them to meta or faction versions (that means stuff like compact, enduring etc). There's passable fits for all kinds of T1 cruisers for that purpose, so if you tell us which race you prefer we can probably come up with something more to your liking. 
---
Try it in a site - if you can't tank it, just warp out and change the fit a little bit. Maybe fit an active tank (that means repair modules) or try different sites. 
---
As for best income, I think exploration will earn you the most money, but you'll have to take the risk of diving into wormholes and nullsec for that as HS exploration just isn't as profitable.
---
I think all NS farmers will go in Low Sec (less $$$) or Wormhole (more $$$) depends on the size of the balls of the farmers
---
If they stick with it. They'll cave. CCP always caves. 
---
(I hope I'm wrong, of course, but so far betting on CCP shitting down their legs has never gone wrong.)
---
This is superb.
---
I assume you meant to reply to my comment in the other thread. NPC stations are all over the place in lowsec. Take Black Rise for example - every system you see with a little square next to it has an NPC station: http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Black_Rise#sec
---
And yes, no bubbles at all.
---
🐛
---
This is a common 'krab' attitude. 
---
"We run the entire economy and make the game run" is naive as it assumes you are the only ones capable of making the economy run. Are you and all the delve miners an important part of it? Yes. If you all unsubed would it cause a significant change in that economy? Yes. But the game is not dependent on you, and if suddenly all the players who simply play to mine stopped logging in, the economy would balance itself out by making mining more profitable for other groups.
---
Simply speaking, you are not as important as you think you are.
---
Even then, those players that get fed up with the BS and leave aren't just going to quit the game. They're going to go to people who aren't completely anal about everything.
---
For example, ever since the drifters started their run on nullsec a lot of wormhole corps have been seeing an uptick in the number of applicants.
---
Writing it as "boot-ini" makes me suspect he only heard about it and that it was bad.
---
Ditto, tbh. Besides, Brave is just another massive cesspool alliance, who the fuck cares
---
I understand many pilots dont appreciate the new changes because it will affect them in their daily activities.
---
But have you ever though about all the previous changes and how it have affected other pilots when the game changed in your favour?
---
Just look at me, i have been playing since 2004 and i have never used nor will use skill injectors, now you have 1day old toon in a titans. Did you consider all the time i have spent training my skills in **REAL TIME** to get the ships i wanted to fly or asked to fly by the corp/alliance?
---
Many of the pilots complaining dont know what eternity it feels to train 60+days long skills and now anyone can just inject them in 2mins. Thats not fair but you did not see me go quitting eve, i kept going and iam still around.
---
People being able to have 15+ rorqs and making billions per hour and people can do shit because you have so many titans ready to save you and just die because you and your friends drops a shit load of caps. I mean if you just want to pve i really think there are better games for that type of gameplay --&gt; wow is in that direction. Just remember that in Wow if you die you dont loose assets = perfect gameplay for those that dont want to loose shit when they die:)
---
That being said i dont mind people having 15+ rorqs but it has to be a risk when you deploy your assets when you want to make good profit. Everything that has a good profit is dangerous, just compare to real life. Where can you get a lot of money with no risk AT ALL, if you know that place/option please let me know so i can make money as well.
---
What iam trying to say is that changes will always piss people up and the only thing we can do is to accept the fack that we are playing a mmorpg game and that there are many interest involved, not its the turn for pilots like me that appreciate a good roam/good fight to have a bit more fun.
---
And yes other pilots will have it harder but its not as bad as you might think or imagining. Yes you will not be able to  afk mine with your rorqs as you might use to but you still have your friends to back you up.
---
And you will probably die a bit more but you will also be able to make the isk you have been making and if you compare your income with your "deaths" i know for sure your will go isk positive. So its not much of a problem at least not as many are trying to paint an apocalyptic view of everything:)
---
ps!
---
The list can go long with all the changes that affected my style of playing eve but i just wanted to keep it as short of possible and give you the idea behind my thoughts.
---
I also think this changes will bring back way more people that dropped the game due to the changes in the past and if we are lucky we should see an increase in active players which is good for the game in general.
---
Removing local is basically a huge buff to BLOPS
---
In any free to play game you’re either paying with time or money. These players who are no longer paying with isk are also no longer providing content or community effort to the continuation of eve.
---
The incentive to leave hisec is pvp and more isk and that will not be changing
---
I think you vastly underestimate it, and I'm not just talking about the economic changes, now say hypothetically all krab in delve unsubbed,  reddit would cheer yay, all the players who have returned thinking they can hunt in null, now can't hunt in null, because a hunter is nothing without prey. 
---
They would all in turn also quit again likely jumping on this subreddit once more letting us know 'games dead im out'. So now you've lost the krabs,  you've lost the hunters, and as an end goal you're now worse off than you have ever been. 
---
And that's ignoring all economic changes that would affect new players and making stuff expensive and unobtainable there fore destroying there enjoyment,
---
Got to actually be a good spy for Intel. Who would have thought
---
Just waiting for classic wow
---
Obviously, but the nullsec hate train is going at full speed right now, and trying to stop it is pretty pointless. 
---
Really I think we should be burning wormholes, not hisec. That would be a lot more interesting, and probably just as profitable
---
😅
---
And a super is 15+ bil and a proper* fit carrier is 3bil? I'm failing to see the isk comparison there? Except for you lose that ship in null likely more often for less reward from sites
---
heh
---
i am alpharius xddddddddddddddddd
---
NS is still worth it without local because of the logistics of living in a WH.  You can still have 50 dudes drop on you in WHs.  The key is for CCP to implement it properly, and for that we'll just have to wait and see.
---

---
Snuffed Out, mostly
---
But you can't run to same WH 24/7 like you be able run to null or hi sec. That is AN issue.
---
hai
---
Yes, hi, hello. In *my* Eve Online, as in, 2005-2010, you accepted that whatever you brought to null was basically already lost, even tho you could not destroy outposts. This bullshit has to end.
---
Also, NPCs have yet to actually destroy a player-owned structure.
---
i hope all you fuckin crabs go play another game.
---
not even a year.... filthy casual
---
Yeah exactly like during the northen deployment.
---
Highsec is a bit to lucrative, compared to lowsec or low class wh. Compare the income streams and the effort required.
---
If you want to spend a few hours a day ratting to draw even with running for a few hours a week, then okay. I guess you do you.
---
I like to krab once, MAYBE twice a week if I really need isk, and then I can either pvp, play other games with people, or whatever.
---
My understanding is that most WH corps moved their assets to lowsec after Fort Knocks got taken out, so there may not be a point in burning them.
---
there was some complaint about the local mechanic not having any options. this is totally false. drop a few probes, ignore everything, new sig pops up and you have an indication. 
---
maybe they could release probes that can detect but not probe down cloakers and make them expensive.
---
If all the krabs in delve unsubbed tomorrow, the impact that would have on the game would certainly be dramatic. What you describe would probably happen.
---
The critical mistake you are making in your logic is that the deletion of local will result in every nullsec miner, site runner, etc to unsub from the game. That will not happen simply because supply and demand will keep everything balanced out.
---
Lets say that within a month the change to delete local hits. Nullsec people either 1) Don't log in or 2) Log in and die to roaming groups. Lets say that this is impactful enough where across all of Nullsec 10% of the players are no longer contributing through bounty tax, minerals, PI, etc. 
---
Lets now talk about this in terms of the market as a whole. Given that there is X supply of GOODS and Y demand for GOODS. These krabs are one of the main producers of GOODS, but they are not the demand at all. How often do krabs buy stuff from the market directly. Therefor, the loss of the krabs has NO impact on Y, the demand, but WILL decrease X, the supply of goods.
---
Given that the cost of GOODS is a function of supply and demand, we will see an increase of cost for GOODS. HOWEVER, the remaining 90% will see a slight boost in price they are able to set their goods to. Maybe mining makes 100mil over 3 days before, now it makes 120mil afterwards.
---
Krabs will never go away because the more that go away the more profitable it becomes to krab. So your situation where all the krabs leave is simply not possible due to supply and demand.
---
Hunters with ~~cyno and bridges ready~~ dotlan will have a huge advantage
---
Truthfully,  i support no local.  I support no asset safety.  I hate drifters and they are a broken bullshit poorly implemented system and I did freeze my accounts due to them, it made no sense to me to pay for sitting in a station,  once drifters are over regardless of local situation ill return
---
Reality doesn't really matter to the "bee man bad" types. Not only do goons have the biggest response fleet, they probably have more people sitting cloaked on gates than any other group by far. Delve intel won't likely be affected much at all.
---
Still around 1b/h if you fully invest in carriers for L5s
---
Yeah and let us boson sites for 10b/hr singleboxed
---
Remove all npc stations in any known space and you want be bothered of asset safety any more.
---
I don't see that changing anything at this point. Most people who have supers are more than rich enough to inject an alt to fly it if they suddenly became undockable.
---
Versus  losing a fuck ton of subs.  We will see how this plays out. I cant see this going the way you think it will
---
I am making an isk comparison between the price of the ship, how often it is lost, and how much isk you gain between the purchase of the ship and the loss of the ship.
---
A 100mil battleship can run some shitty sites at maybe 20mil a tick, or 60mil an hour. A 500mil battleship can run decent sites at maybe 30mil a tick, or 100mil an hour. A ratting carrier is 3bil and will make 120mil+ an hour and not die. A ratting super with a good cap umbrella will make 200+mil an hour and not die. ZERO RISK (as long as you are paying attention).
---
In wormhole space a group of dudes can run C5 sites at 1bil an hour with 5-6bil of ships, and die maybe once every couple months. In a C4 you can run C4 sites at a couple hundred mil an hour with 1-2bil of ships, and die maybe once every couple months.
---
In wormhole space, there is a balance. There is risk, and there is reward. In nullsec, there is no balance. If you pay attention you will not die. The reason I am making this comparison is to put the safety of nullsec into a more hollistic perspective; perfect safety is not healthy for the game because it makes it uninteractive for everyone.
---
Still would be better than burning hisec
---
Yeah it's a line from some mittani pings.
---
How the fuck do you spell cartels wrong here but right in your Albion posts
---
Yeah i agree the current system is no good,  however changing it to Wh levels of danger without even a slight increase in rewards damages the space as a whole imo
---
I literally haven't seen one goon complain about the drifters except mittani. It's definitely a stupid mechanic, but I'm willing to forgive it since it's something new and I love when they do stuff with the lore. Only complete dipshits are actually losing ships to drifters, and they don't come back to finish off ref'd citadels.
---
well you didn't do a very good job, low sec should be a graveyard and nullsec should be a picture of everyone docked up.
---
If only.
---
They need to make some trailer ad for this shit and send it out to everyone would be massive as fuck
---
Had totally forgotten about that sub, thanks a lot
---
Personally I agree; while I think it is important to limit the reach and power of a power group (especially when the majority of the space is 'unused' and 'unlived in'), the solution that CCP arrived at is fairly unelegant.
---
That being said, I think it is preferable that CCP does something to try SOMETHING than sit in fear that what they are implementing is not perfect.
---
Is the drifter mechanic shitty for some people? Yes. Is it perfect? No. But does it have an impact that MIGHT be for the better of the game? Who knows, but I think for the time being it is worth finding out the answer to that question.
---
&gt; Also, NPCs have yet to actually destroy a player-owned structure.
---
Technically not true; they killed a jump gate and an athanor, maybe one or two more. It was pure coincidence though, they didn't reinforce them and come back for a timer, they just happened to hit structures that were already in hull timer.
---
There are bots with supers too.
---
This is obviously a test by CCP to see how ppl adapt and how big the outcry is, better to do it during the summer than autumn/winter/spring when ppl are actually playing.
---
&gt; perfect safety is not healthy for the game because it makes it uninteractive for everyone.
---
the only reason such levels of safety exist is because of how much interaction is put in to it.
---
the only reason you're safe is because you have a large number of characters doing NOTHING but waiting to protect those that need it.
---
one of the reasons i don't own a cap and prefer to subcap rat and die quietly if i fuck up is because that keeping a cap safe is a reciprocal arrangement that would require me to have multiple omegas which quite frankly i'm not willing to foot the bill for - because unless i'm willing to be part of that umbrella why should i expect to benefit from it's safety?
---
Do you even get any content in WHs? Null content is kind of dry and with WHs being dead I imagine there's no content at all
---
i think they introduce new structures for local and then some parts of null wont have null and the populated parts will have it but it could be taken down by attackers.
---
If it makes you feel better , sure why not...
---
Oh yes sorry my Bad.
---
Which group is bigger is the only thing that matters
---
Yeah fit will carry over easily to vni with the changes coming to it
---
inb4 the conspiracy theory starts up that all the salt from Mittens, the burn high sec thing, and the Drifter attacks on Goon structures are all diversions attempting to conceal a carefully orchestrated plan based on insider CSM info to sell a shitload of combat recons at highly inflated prices.
---
https://i.imgur.com/gJzxA7f.jpg
---
then you should be happy
---
That is an important part of the problem (one that CCP Hilmar has gone on record as saying as being one of the most critical design decisions made) is that the reward of living in nullsec does not vary by region. On that note, I am curious how much of the market is repressed by the lack of danger. Maybe making it riskier will increase the reward?
---
Regardless, an increase of danger without an increase of reward will make nullsec less attractive. I think this is something that CCP should definitely keep their eye on.
---
Haha good one
---
" Simply speaking, you are not as important as you think you are "   
---
The biggest bitch from hunters seems to be krabs are too hard to kill, so if there are no krabs left to hunt, what exactly are you going to kill?
---
&gt;That will not happen simply because supply and demand will keep everything balanced out.
---
That would require hunters to start krabbing to replace lost krabs due to unsubs.... and we all know that isn't going to happen.
---
True but you can krab 24/7 in wh the sites need to spawn. Sure the sites pay more but are less available. If course you can roll your static for krabbing space but critting all static wh connections is not what mist ppl do.
---
Could have been an all monitor fleet, the bombers did all the kills.
---
&gt; if dropping tons of supers and titans is basically your answer to everything, then on the long term, drifters will be the only thing that will be left in delve to fight, as nobody else will take the time and ISK to come there  
---
good
---
Yes a lot of the safety (especially at a capital level) comes from how much work and interaction is put into this. Capital umbrellas make it very difficult to blow up structures or take down super capitals. This has nothing to do with the change to local, because the change to local impacts gameplay where capitals frequently do not see play (but definitely do).
---
Local requires ZERO work and provides an insane amount of intelligence and information for those who live in that space. That is a large problem with it (and something that I guarantee is going to come soon, making local cost something either in infrastructure or isk).
---
Srry for the bad spelling my phone typing skills are untrained
---
If they where listening to the goon csm we would be worse off.
---
All hail Drifters
---
I would argue that there has been no positive impact to the game that drifters have brought,  the reason I would say that is simple,  it has forced a large player base to sit by irate,  it has wether people like to recognise it or not, created the true 'blue don't if ccp.came out with no local from the start that would have shaken things up, give trig like invasions on systems even if it was drifters could be avoidable,  
---
Let's remember it has only killed a anchoring anathor and an Astahus that was low power outside of that ot has killed every player not in a super basically at random without counterplay that is not great.. Also I would argue Wh space is safer than null with the removal of local reason being when I lived in wh it was standard practice yo scan your statics and make sure they were critical before doing anything,  the risk of someone jumping you with a large enough force was low unless solo ratting without backup
---
190days with a remap. Way too long.
---
You must be a fairly serious krab who rarely does PvP; How do you believe hunters pay for the ships they fly? Do they just magically appear in our pockets?
---
I hunt quite a lot and also krab quite a lot to pay for the fairly blingy ships that I fly. I do not mine because it is not super profitable for time invested, but if mineral prices started to climb I would consider it.
---
no local means any Alpha account is now almost as effective as a cloaky camping omega account. once you get past the gate watching pod you can log off and when you come back online to hunt they dont know you are active.
---
What a fun to keep people waiting to counter drop 24/7 to a dread bomb, and rat in a super for 30-45 mil tick if May Land in cyno inhib anomaly and no one Will Save you.
---
Needing to center probes in 3d space would be pretty difficult
---
The likelyhood of all crabs disappearing is very low. It is a function of supply and demand; if somehow half of the krabs in the game left, minerals would be worth much more, making it easier for those remaining krabs to stick around (easier to justify getting blown up once a week if you pay it back within an hour). All the krabs leaving is not going to happen.
---
Even if they did, hunters would simply fight each other. How many fights happen that are between hunters and other hunters? They are way more fun because they actually fight back and present a challenge.
---
nobody cares what happens in your lowsec frigate battles on npc stations
---
I'm Amarr, but I don't really care about which race I'm going to use - I just need some Alpha fits which I can try if they work out. I'm pretty sure I won't find the best even maybe a good one at the beginning, cuz it also depends on my combat skills and my tactics when I fight, but I should start from somewhere. I can't tell I have knowledge about fitting, cuz this is something I think takes bit more or even much more time to learn, so it is like I hope I can learn most of the things with examples rather than reading rough theory. So anything you think it's good - send to try )) (it is really better if you stick with just Alpha fits, cuz I don't really know what to replace the Omega parts with) 
---
Never have you and I ever been on the same page before as much as we are now.
---
I'm excited to go roam in Esoteria in something other than a Wolf, Jaguar, or Hecate.
---
Not after the social boosters drove LP to the ground. Now you get like 550isk/lp for buy orders
---
I do too.
---
Buying plex from CCP *is* RMT
---
This makes me want to come back. Not sure if I have the time but I think I'll give it a shot.
---
"there has been no positive impact to the game that drifters have brought". While that may be true for yourself, it is not true for the game in general; At least, in what CCPs goal for the game (likely) is. 
---
I think the biggest problem for drifters is that for a large group of players they are fairly uninteresting to interact with; they let you continue owning structures which is VERY IMPORTANT but we are not used to having to 'prove' that we deserve our structures yet. 
---
I think this unenjoyability from interacting with the drifters comes from the simple fact that CCP cannot hand-tune a tool to try and fix the citadel spam. While the drifters may drop low-power structures here and there, there are going to be casualties along the way.
---
To be totally honest its hard to provide an objective analysis of the drifters because their storyline has not concluded. If the drifters finished tomorrow I would agree that it was fairly lackluster but I am hopeful there is more direction to it that will provide more interesting gameplay.
---
&gt;That is a large problem with it (and something that I guarantee is going to come soon, making local cost something either in infrastructure or isk).
---
which is just going to hurt the little guy, as is always the case. big groups won't notice a rounding error worth of isk in expenditure a month - for small groups it's not a rounding error it's going to be a huge chunk of their working capital every month.
---
same thing if it's an infrastructure thing rather than a tax - but it's going to be the man hours of the logistics division of the group rather than the wallet balance.
---
That is why I wait. This is too good to not get fucked up by CCP
---
Math checks out.
---
I used to piss off guys living in the same system so bad by hyperfarming the good anoms in our system. I had my timer set for 5 mins ready for the respawn every time. Made them so mad!
---
Wormholes. Also you can just camp cloacked in their system and they will not know if you are there
---
No, it just hurts the botters really
---
Carebears are gonna cope in whatever way they can. It's all projection.
---
I actually had dscan on space in a previous config, and also had it on mouse3. But I find V is actually easier for me. That space bar is a big key, pressing it takes more finger power!
---
just upgrade your ratting ship to a capital with a cyno.
---
Same, but I just downvote what’s linked in the in brigading channel like a good little bean!
---
Except most wh pvp players willing to go to null are rolling the holes. No bot can scan and warp to the fresh wh in any resonable time to detect the fleet coming in that way
---
Here is another perspective; if it costs 1 billion ISK a month to provide local to one system, who pays more? The group that owns one system, or an alliance with 500 systems?
---
It will probably not be perfect to balance but I imagine the amount that a group has to pay will be ROUGHLY equal proportionate to their size. As is most things, smaller groups will have a harder time as most things scale exponentially.
---
Oh my sweet sweet summer child. You have never been to w-space right? Do you think there are bots there? It's not only the entries you have to be wary of, once I'm in your system I can just cloack and you (and by you I mean your bot) will never know if I'm still there.
---
&gt; \-dealing with the citadel spam directly 
---
How? They don't come back for timers, so they're really nothing more than an irritation.
---
&gt; \-bring us the highest quality, AAA grade goon salt unseen since world war bee 
---
Still haven't seen any of this mythical "goon salt". Unless you think mittani represents the opinions of all goons, which, to be fair, you probably do.
---
No. 12: Mittani, is that you?
---
1. If you were docked, it's safe to login.  
---
2. Read about 'Asset Safety'. Basically, you can tell the game to deliver all your stuff to the nearest lowsec station.
---
Doubtful imo. Prey is usually more numerous than predator in my experience in eve.
---
Or just make them hostile to all players the same way drifters are in null
---
Well it's not even that it's less attractive but imagine if some repricussions come from this, now I don't think this would ever be a reality,  but say goonswarm main source of income starts becoming wormholes and they as extra large holes open in null start spamming structures /capitals etc in there,  and I'm talking in mass, like the force that went north on mass 'uncontestable' would you still have the same thoughts on the matter. 
---
Or is it due to this largely being a buff to Wh ganking you see it as positive?
---
Christ that’s sad
---
:thumbs_up:
---
This is a retarded idea.  
---
&gt; Please do not upvote.  
---
downvoted
---
CCP will, unfortunately, never do that. Carebears unleash an ocean of tears after even the smallest losses. Can you even imagine the shitstorm if CCP presented them with an actual threat? It would legitimately be the funniest shit in EVE history though.
---
Hey now, not everyone in null is a crying krab
---
what local?
---
Chat should work just fine regardless of local count, see wormholes.
---
Spread the word lads!
---
It's called lightning a cyno.
---
They were buying PLEX for those subs anyway
---
Slight correction: [WH Space](https://i.imgur.com/qEh2MuY.gif)
---
I'd rather have 100 rorq krabs leave, and have 50 combat players rejoin the game.
---
The HardKnocks eviction that happened in December of last year, when a small GSF group decided to evict one of the largest and most powerful wormhole groups shows that in a straight fight between wormholers and JUST goonswarm, wormholers lose everytime.
---
If GSF decided to take out wormhole space, they would win. Would it be fun? Fuck yea, turning wormhole space into even more of a bar fight bloodbath would be fantastic. When the dust settled goons would 'control' everything; but it would not be that easy. Taking out high-value targets is one thing, but the nature of wormholes makes it difficult to deal with groups permanently. Furthermore, logistics and management of MULTIPLE wormhole systems is a pain in the ass and close to impossible for dozens of holes.
---
In that context, a lot of nullseccers have C5 krab holes these days, so it looks like they understand the ISK faucet but don't want to invest time into the maintenance and logistics of wormhole space due to the unreliable nature of connections.
---
Goons concerned about the little guy.... Good one haha
---
Well Krabbing implies making isk ... you are not going to get rich blaping null-sec drifters .... it's more just doing it to have fun as there is nothing else to hunt ....
---
Get myfitnesspal and lookup c25k (couch to 5k). Between these two free things you can get yourself in shape. My wife and I have lost over 100lbs each roughly and it's great. It's mostly all just diet and just controlling what you eat. If our lazy asses can do it hell anyone can.
---
I have never seen such a heap of salt in one place.
---
I find the botter who say they unsub 40 accounts and then login all their 40 accounts to like their own posts the most fun.
---
This is the best thing ever
---
Now I think about it, it would be fun.  Though I don't think we'd find many targets after a while (not 30k, that's 30k characters, not people).
---
Username checks out too
---
Everyone does realize that this is a test right.  And that if this test does not go well they will be amending it.  Just saying I would temper expectations of long term changes until they are announced.
---
I always wondered what null would be like if so many got there wish of no local.
---
so pointlessly killing red crosses is somehow more valuable if it's less valuable?
---
i'm fucking confused now.
---
Yeah injectors are fine for 'halp I'm a newb I need to catch up a bit' but you shouldn't be able to inject 50m SP into a new capital pilot. Imo they should act like accelerators.
---
Welcome, CCP Monkey’s Paw
---
Perhaps I view it differently or perhaps my years in wh space has given me a different view, i dont personally find navigation through the holes hard based on the statics they have,  I guess there is just some initial learning.  
---
Like watching in the day lazerhawks rage roll holes finding specific people or batphoning allys and rolling c4/5 statics till you found them. These things seemed like common place at the time
---
net, or gross? because you can keep multiple systems under 1 umbrella, that umbrella will exist whether you own 1 or 10 systems you can spread the 'cost' of that umbrella over 10 systems. also if you have a population that requires 10 systems you will have the population to have a substantially stronger umbrella, leading to more successful defences which will reduce the cost of replacing ships that aren't successfully defended.
---
such are economies of scale - which is why the small guy gets shit on in almost every situation, they don't have the scale to benefit from such cost saving efficiencies.
---
nah the lowsec one is p accurate tbh
---
I would temper my expectations as to how the player base is going to deal with these changes before you get too excited about this being monumental in your game play experience.  Because as you have said this will change the game play for not only you but all those that you hunt......  Keep that in mind when boasting about getting exactly what you wanted from CCP as you do not truly know if it is what you wanted.
---
It's okay for a capital ship to be fairly strong and difficult to kill. But it shouldn't be able to ruin the day of small ships, either. A battleship can have under-my-guns problems with dessies and even cruisers - so why does the next class up get the ability to engage (almost instantly, with NSA) further down?
---
“The eve community is mostly angered” what are you talking about? Most people are happy with this
---
0.0 has not been for small groups since cap proliferation stop bringing up this tired ass line.
---
Kestrel is kill
---
Bob?
---
According to CCP yes .... you are not the only one confused by this.
---
So we swap one group of quitters with another group of quitters.
---
what's with these people who can barely speak english constantly posting posts that make absolutely no sense about shit i'm not even talking about
---
What a massive strawman.
---
"You can't deal with it because I came up with a solution that doesn't work."
---
Did you just get bored and start writing?
---
No. It's null sec. As in, no security rating. Because there's no security by CONCORD. So your proposal would mean no more nullsec.
---
Unlikely though, more likely 1-5
---
3. Don't.
---
Wormholers and nullies are two different people cut out of different cloth though. Wormholers knew what they were getting into, and had years to get used to it. For null, most of the people are currently in the "I didn't sign up for this" mood. Even if wormholers didn't use scripts to run d-scan (even though I'm willing to bet some do), a lot of nullies will.
---
I think that people are genuinely not addressing the fact that this is going to change large scale engagements to showdown levels that we have not seen before.  I feel like this is going to result in a lot of fleets just sitting docked because no one knows what could be around the corner.  I hope it is everything all these starry eyed people think it is going to be but I keep thinking back to the fact that a lot of fun in eve is squashed because of no or bad intel so I see this as being a detriment more than for funs sake which is why we play this game.  This is just an observation before  you go jumping down my throat as a mad carebear also I have not PVE'd in a while.
---
They're trying to remove the afk part of these faucets at least. As seen with the VNI changes.
---
&gt; set up a mining routine and go to sleep.
---
I know you all think everyone in null is a bot but rorqual's self tackle to mine and ain't no way you are leaving 7 bill on the field while you sleep.
---
A game with more fighting, sounds good to me.
---
Some of them are also yelling while crying.
---
&gt;I feel like this is going to result in a lot of fleets just sitting docked because no one knows what could be around the corner.
---
protip: no alliance relies solely on local for intel for large fights, and better intel is always gathered, and everything works fine.
---
that entire premise of yours is flawed.
---
I wonder what would happen if you couldn't use injected SP on capital ship skills.
---
WH connections to nullsec are:
---
C248 (C6)
---
Z142 (C5)
---
K346 (C4/C3)
---
E545 (C2)
---
Z060 (C1)
---
Null was always meant to be the wild west of Eve. I don't see the problem.
---
the mind boggles!
---
majority of assets are not in Lowsec, because most assets are doctrine ships the problem is more than most defensive plans now include the notion of an unwinnable fight so most groups will have plans to log off all their assets, there is also the issue of setting it up as you need to seed the assets in the hole.
---
Plus there is the issue that if you ping the other side can roll the hole and then your fleet needs a new entry meaning you now have to infill in the hostiles off TZ.
---
Get fukt goons
---
362 days. Cute
---
Most definitely in agreement with you.
---
Honestly I think the blackout will be an interesting mix up. I can’t say if it will be good or bad for the game but I can say a list of new structures to add under the current structure mechanics is definitely a step in the wrong direction. I do think the mothership idea is pretty cool, but why add a new ship when you can just change the way a current structure works like the astrahaus.
---
I'm hesitant to see CCP add another stupidly overpowered and excessively large ship to EVE, TBH, but this idea doesn't seem like the worst. Any such World Ark would have to be *incredibly* vulnerable, though. I imagine it would have to be anchored in place to be docked in and to fight, with maybe a 15-minute disruptable anchoring timer (so you can't just anchor it in the middle of fights). While anchored it would have a single timer and otherwise act like a normal structure. If the timer has been triggered it cannot move until the shields are fully repped. 15-minute disruptable unanchor as well, and no timers and massively reduced shield/armour when unanchored. That sort of thing.
---
Hi im ccp wanna buy some plex
---
Should be 3620D. Otherwise checks out.
---
At this point I don't think anyone cares if these guys quit. They're likely pissed because they were the afk vni ratters and their nullsec safe space has been destroyed. 
---
People like that quitting isn't actually a bad thing.
---
Oh I didn’t know they were changing it, is there a post on The changes?
---
And... that's great... give do some work to get your kills Instead if easy mode this ain't space invaders.
---
Oh and you know HK Keepstar died recently because of a well thought out plan.. so please dont say it cant be done you're just being lazy.
---
Because there is something called probe scanning too
---
So you want a titan.
---
When you log in look at your ship on the character select. If it says "docked - &lt;station name&gt;" you are safe if it says undocked the station is gone and your stuff is in asset safety. Either way you can asset safety it out of there.
---
Why not go pla... Oh right :(
---
This. It's saying 'I'm not ... unsubbing until (the change is made)', which is essentially saying they don't want local back.
---
Sharpens stiletto with anticipation
---
cheaper?
---
Made for wormholes. This is bare minimum tank for my needs. 
---
But sure, if you can make it work with less, go right ahead.
---
Are nullbears really that poor?
---
Fair enough, my point being that there is no economic incentive for a NS entity to burn a WH unless they plan on living in the WH long term.
---
This
---
Please, don't project your own reaction to everyone else.
---
Hope there's not a steam sale going when that happens.
---
Hmm, they have relatively fast warp and can discard drones, because they only use two.
---
Yeah, you are right.
---
It would be funny, think it would be a half and half. I used to be a carebear and I would get bored. If they made the loot worth a shit I think people would actually enjoy this whole thing, like incursions 2.0, but from what I've read (coming back after a hiatus) its nothing more than an annoyance that ain't worth shit so I understand why people are pissed off.
---
Your absolutely underestimating the power of subterfuge.
---
Dont worry. A whole super umbrella will materialize when the blops cyno emerges. The krab will infact, be saved.
---
Its the other krab who just got dropped on who wont have their umbrella save them.
---
Little tsun zhou for your thoughts
---
When you log in and you’re at the character selection screen, you can see where you are and in what ship. If you were sitting in a ship in a station that was taken down or destroyed, you will be in space in your ship and will have to navigate out. You might die, but that’s half the fun. All your assets will be in asset safety at the nearest lowsec station. You can pay a fee to recover your assets from lowsec and get one of the public courier companies (or just a public contract) to move your stuff for you. If you place collateral on the contract you should be pretty safe. The biggest public courier companies are PushX and Red Frog.
---
If the station is still there, you’ll still be sitting in it even if you’ve been kicked. You could either join whoever owns the station, or use asset safety to get your stuff out.
---
Is it worth playing again? You have to work that one out, I think it is but we all have our moments.  Good luck.
---
The salt reserves will increase in size when nullsec becomes empty wasteland with rare dead end systems guarded by supercap &amp; titan umbrellas. Only this time it will be PvPers crying that there is noone left to shoot. RIP solo &amp; group roaming. The era of capitals and cynos shall begin.
---
And yet exploration bots exist that not only scan sigs but also somehow do the sites.
---
I've been in null since i first started the game- Never lived anywhere else. I say bring on the shake up.
---
Four easy steps:
---
1. Open compare tool
---
2. Drag all of the relevants in it
---
3. ???
---
4. Chose the cheapest one
---
The "profit" part is at the other players supplying tthe stuff on markets.
---
So everyone always says just train/fly what you want as a noob...but the more I read about eve the more obvious it is that I should be Skilling into caldera shield/missile ships instead of gallente armor/drones/
---
The reason being is that gallente has blaster bonuses and blasters suck since the meta is mid to high range combat.
---
The real difference over the last couple years was that more and better tools were available and allowed(!) to scrap data from ingame communication channels through log files that allowed players to be warned from 3rd party apps about incoming hunters. So avoiding PvP in PvP areas became the norm and removed a lot of content.
---
People in travel systems would link pilots and system names in a channel, often sitting in structures and not undocked in space. But when there is no local to link people without actually ever seeing them on the same grid this mechanic will stop working.
---
A dual rep paladin in bastion with high grade asklep set and strong exile **might** be able to tank them, but even with scorch you won't be hitting them for much if at all at the range and speed they're at. And you'll run out of cap boosters and die if you're wrong, losing 5-7B. A super with dromis and light fighters, on the other hand, ezpz drifter squeezy.
---
Aw. I let the kids know about the gold. They said to thank the internet very much 🖖😁
---
Yeah, overpowered definitely isn’t the aim - World Arks aren’t out there to kill anything. Even the ones in the Invasions don’t actually have any weapons; they can, however, deploy effect towers like webs/damps/drone&amp;missile-denial AOE/etc. 
---
In any fight, I’d expect a World Ark to influence the field of the battle itself in lots of ways like that, rather than shoot things 
---
And I like most of what you say there, yea - save for docking/undocking, which I’d envision as always being possible (it’d be a mobile station, after all). One timer maximum when anchored, and being stuck in place if the shield timer gets worn down, only being able to deploy effects when anchored, etc - that’d all be proper~
---
The more chaos the better
---
Thats for that insightful comment that had no baring on the reply I had..
---
I was responding to the comment saying it was only in null due to outsystems not the main system
---
It makes perfect sense for people to Bot, EVE prides itself on having a natural economy and so people will act in pursuit of the highest profits. I’m not passing judgement, I just think this new paradigm is going to change things significantly.
---
That would mean cheaper ships and items which is great.
---
Where do I even begin
---
I just started eve back up after very briefly playing it back in 2011
---
Im so lost in everything
---
but I guess my main questions are 
---
I keep getting my ass handed to me during level 2 security/ fighting missions - what am I probably doing wrong? 
---
Whats the best way to make money early on during the game? 
---
How do I learn things? It seems like people know so much and its all so specific im so lost, I feel like I dont even know what to ask
---
Final Nail in the coffin for this game. First it was Drifters. Now I can't see who's in local? Seriously?!
---
You're kidding right? The "dangerous and lawless" space is already the safest place in the game but lets add concord. I've seen some shit ideas before but yours might just take the cake
---
This here is what i want eve *not to be*, and what this guy thinks is a bad idea is how eve *used to be*
---
with such idea you better go highsec, nullsec is not for your....
---
Yeah but you are not stereotypically retarded unlike &gt;insert test line member
---
&gt; No shitposting in local.
---
I still shitpost in w-space local just fine when I fly through :|
---
&gt; im thinking this would buff lowsec as most moon miners will relocate there with rorqs
---
Say what now? Fat chance of that happening.
---
The game being... ? Is this Star Citizen?
---
Is this a trollpost? Because for all we know, the developers of that game collected a few hundred million worth of donations but have yet to release a game after all these years.
---
My pleasure
---
My PI is now making  about 800mil a Month with little work. I plan to get with a 3rd alt to around 1,2bil the next month. Now I face the problem that every other activity of mine is far more work to come close to these numbers. What do I do? My main goal was always ISK and now I have "enough", now I somehow lost my goals that I had lol, what should I do?
---
What is this game?
---
Holy fucking shit
---
I think.. You just took the bait
---
So a change which is going to ruin the whole of eve. Let's make a meme directed at goons.
---
I'm Number 2. To my defense, I had a pretty rough day when this photo was taken...
---
I am in TEST tho
---
chaos is a ladder
---
I think you also took the bait..
---
Cynos should nerf lock range to 0 when fit, solves that problem.  Coverts cynos exempt of course.
---
People decloak when they land on gate and again On the other side when they break gate cloak. If there is a cloaky intel bot on that grid, it sees the enemy on grid and pings intel. WHers will have free reign in the system their hole spawns, but will still take gates. This system would be more reliable than counting on players reporting stuff.
---
they are already doing it
---
no Local is going to make big fights against TEST much less fun
---
Any AU TZ non-carebear PvP corps hiring?
---
I'll be getting involved in the game again if this change sticks. Haven't been properly back into the game for 2 years (was playing for 5 prior to that), but this sounds like an incredible change.
---
Its the perfect middleground though! Spam this button repeatedly to watch your ass, or, get lazy and make it risky. Bots die and players who want to live almost 100% always live. Wormholers got this, anyone can learn it too
---
Protip: Did I say that they rely solely on local or is that you putting words in my mouth as a part of some ASS-U-ME situation?  How exactly is it flawed if you take out your dumb ass assumption out?
---
I like it
---
I like the idea of a mobile base. It must be worked out so that it's not overpowered but it could be really fun (I just fear the fact that it won't be possible to buy it for anybody who's not in a large group). 
---
For the observatories I really don't want them arround. If they appear it would take a few months for the big alliances to have a local chat just like they had before the blackout and so nothing will change for them.
---
Maybe, hard to tell with the current climate
---
Underrated comment here tbh
---
My understanding is that you have absolutely no idea what youre talking about.
---
Yeah, they didn't try; they are actually doing it right now
---
Do you not know how to read english.  You sound like a fanboy that has gotten just a little out of control.  Here I will add a coma because you obviously cant handle text in english that is not perfect grammer.
---
what the fuck is wrong with your comprehension of the english language?
---
i never said you said that you mongoloid, i'm saying that alliances NEVER relied solely on local, so your assertion is incorrect, since any actual scouting beyond local will take precedence over what local shows anyway
---
You can always logout or just cloak for a while. Either they come back out or no isk for them. 
---
Hell you can leave an alpha on the gate and make their intel network either make sure no isk is generated or ignore you completley and go on like everythings fine
---
Those retention figures tho, 80% stop playing in the 1st 2 weeks ooof.
---
As Mr Spielberg did on his movie "Jaws", the main point is not to be there, but the fear of nullseccers that we are there. Its more effective ;)
---
So nerf the income. Don't just remove the ability for new players to have a safe starting area to learn the game in.
---
Stealth buff for trig doctrine? Sounds great, gotta stock up on those blueprints then!
---
Get out normie reeeEEEE
---
Yaay wh!
---
But they do rely on it.  Also what the hell is your problem.  I did not insult you why do you have to insult me.  And now you are changing the goal posts.  God this is what it is like to converse with someone that does not understand what you are saying because they are so hyper defensive that they just lash out.  Maybe take a breath and walk away for a minute.  I did not say that alliances solely rely on local either it is a tool for intel.  If you cant understand the fact that I was talking about a tool in a system of tools than I do not think you are qualified to talk about this.
---
&gt;Here I will add a coma
---
i wish you were in a coma
---
&gt; How many fights happen that are between hunters and other hunters?
---
the billboards make it look like they tend to just shoot the krab together and then leave.
---
it is not buff it is equalizing
---
Well now I am reporting you to mods because you are just being negative and name calling have fun with ban.
---
&gt;But they do rely on it.
---
not for large-scale fleet fights. this is naivety on your part.
---
&gt;I did not say that alliances solely rely on local either it is a tool for intel.
---
how many times do i have to say I NEVER SAID YOU SAID THAT you fucking dumbass.
---
This is the strawmanniest thread in r/Eve.
---
Salt snorting may cause blindness (i.e. can't see local)
---
Do they?
---
Haven't ever heard of that before.
---
lol
---
Ccplease, Rainbow Vomit Mega skin.
---
They got rid of local chat not chat.
---
See something that spooks you select an appropriate chat window.
---
Type.
---
Anyone in [SYSTEM] in a [SHIPTYPE].
---
No answer...then you might want to hide.
---
TIL I want ship skins with glitter.
---
Did unicorn come all over it?
---
but elite dangerous just doesn't have the same depth.
---
RIP inb4 he realizes something
---
What else do you think snuff does out there
---
I will be absolutely floored if i see fights happening over *lowsec moons* again, from mega coalitions lmao
---
Is eve back?!
---
A for effort! Well done sir :D
---
Free torpedoes?
---
The eve playerbase is so weird.  Why do we have a playerbase that actively wants people to quit a game that has been having sub problems for while now.
---
I like the cut of your jib. Delete local! Seriously, in some cases we're talking vast distances - fuck local. Dscan or go home. Talk about immersion.
---
Wait until it's permanent, dude. No sense resubbing for a 1-week event.
---
Other hulls will go down, though. Don't fly gallente and it's win/win.
---
Well, the Armageddon might go up but...
---
lol like even a couple of months of no taxes would cause an issue for an established Null alliance. how poor are you people.?
---
You underestimate the deep, primal fear that the average nullbear has for wormhole space.
---
Have fun burning WHs then I guess.
---
Virgin Arazu vs Chad Lachesis
---
The idea of a large mobile jump-capable base has been around for years. It's an idea which got a lot of attention when we first found out POS towers would be removed.
---
the fuel should be talking in local
---
I hope the observstories or whatever basically just give a count of people in a constellation, and you have to actively man the observstory, and dscan it. 
---
Why? Cuz people can get PAID to do this for their alliance. And you can easily detect bots this way by focusing on the ms ticks and using an algorythm to detect timed dscan refresh for synchronicity and frequency distribution, OR to detect random number generation in bot code,
---
I'll ask. Kids entertainment may have changed since I last encountered it...
---
CCPlease...
---
Is this the clone soldier/mordus ratting ive heard about?
---
Might hurt CCP’s bottom line in the short term, but it’ll improve the health of the game and hopefully allow for growth that way.  And anyway, the krab haven we have now is at a lower player count than the old days when there was more PVP content.
---
Who wants to kill VNIs all day long?  I want to kill DED ratters in their blingy shit.  Thus probes.  
---
Also, if you think D Scan is useless, how do you suggest someone find targets in the 30 different anoms in a system?  Just guess and hope to get lucky?  
---
Lastly, Covops are a massive threat when they are my scanning and scouting alt, with a nice little gank fleet waiting on the other side of the hole.  
---
You don't have a clue what you're talking about.
---
Nothing of value lost.
---
Poe’s Law
---
Fuck yeah to advertising billboards. Giant cocks everywhere.

---
We'll see, the summer is the perfect moment to test something like this.
---
yea lol, people should check anher on a good night, or some of the lowsex in derelik
---
[Pff, who needs a salt mine when the tears never head such a high salt grade.](https://i.imgur.com/yBlgWqX.gif)
---
no problem.
---
I think ccp chose the 'die'
---
&gt; Unsubbing 3x10^8 accounts
---
That made me lol
---
or, just make sure your cyno has fuel and drop supers on whatever ends up on grid.
---
just like it is now.
---
He's not wrong however..
---
RIP any value there was left in FW LP.
---
Would make living and ratting in a WH stupid easy.
---
just out of curiosity... which dip on there was the last time they removed local?
---
Oh, can I join you guys?
---
Snuff does it because of how dead it is and how far ahead in force they are of every other low sec group. They do it because noone can oppose them.  
---
&gt;Aideron Robotics  
---
But you already knew that didn't you? I guess becoming a Test pet in null beats getting roflstomped by Snuff in low.
---
You can't get a sudden cyno lit on top of you in a wormhole.
---
Null. Null never changes
---
Thats how I see it too.
---
The status quo was slowly killing the game. Eventually they would lose the whales anyways. So making this change might lose subs in the short term but invigorate the game in the long term, increasing subs and activity.
---
Ccp needs to keep the long-view and not cave to short term losses.
---
in belts it's probably the clone soldiers.
---
oh it will.
---
good luck finding anything smaller than a capital to drop on, that's actually a player not a bot.
---
WH space is dead because people don't like living without local. 
---
CCP - Fuck it, lets delete local in Null but keep cynos! that way we can put two things that people hate together!
---
Yea, this is a buff to WH space.  But people don't play there because they don't like the mechanics.  This isn't a situation where you have to play the game.  most players are just going to up and quit because it isn't fun anymore.  they aren't going to try the WH lifestyle.
---
&gt;turn on eve sound  
---
If you had kept this out it would have been much harder to tell this is a troll post.
---
I hope they settle on delayed in the future with an increase to the delay based on # of ppl in local (the more in local the higher the delay).
---
Your solution is to sub more alts? Found the ccp plant
---
It's probably a test to see what happens.
---
Plus side it was good motivation to size up to a nyx myself
---
why does everyone think these changes benefit them more than goons or any other bloc? aka why is everyone dumb as fuck?
---
Shut fuck
---
I doubt all of those ppl will pay month to month, most are probably on longer paying plans, and most of those are centered around october/november/december (when sales happen and ppl come back from vacations) .... very few of the 'i will unsub' crowd will be gone forever.
---
Then why are veteran players in highsec??? 
---
Why is majority of the game's population still in highsec?
---
&gt;**You guys force gameplay upon us, nullsec**, without even asking the CSM or any represents first.
---
&gt;It is true, the CSM is uneffective. But not because of the way the CSM work, but rather because of the devs at CCP.
---
&gt;The entire last week was a complete clusterfuck and the biggest clusterfuck since the boot-ini mistake.
---
Yeah, that's because they're the developers. Do they need to have 100% consensus from every single player before making a change? 
---
If they seriously think this is on-par with Bootini, they're an exceptional individual.
---
1. If your docked in a player owned structure its a 1 way undock and when you die you will go to your starter system most probably.             
---
             
---
2. You can either put a contract up to have it moved or fire sale it where it is, the second is less hassle and may even give a better return depending on the volume.             
---
            
---
3. Sounds like you left because you felt overwhelmed/uninformed. Consider joining one of the new bro centred corps and take a class or two, /r/evejobs should help.          
---
              
---
When i return after a break i normally sell everything and start again wherever my friends moved to.
---
"no longer plexing with ratting isk" FTFY
---
the question becomes what is the point of making isk?
---
if sov null becomes worthless, and 95% of it will without local, there won't be any reason to fight wars.  people won't need isk.
---
seems like a lot of money to quit over local.
---
You gave the secret away
---
yes my sentiments exactly.
---
Unless drifters attack the structures. - then it's one more effort-tax on owning sov. But an optional one.
---
&gt;Why is majority of the game's population still in highsec?
---
That statement is so far from the truth it currently resides somewhere beyond the EVE gate.
---
Yup, they've been there for ages. If you kill it it will drop 300m.
---
Can’t be tackled by anything cloak
---
The stratios would like to have a chat
---
Dude, that's been a thing for half a decade now.
---
There will be no last time, this is a game changer for CCP....
---
This information is so broad as to be absolutely useless.
---
Yeah, the player population has been declining for the last two years. Your point?
---
1.2bil isk a month is not that great a revenue in the whole scale of things. It's great if you just started playing, you can buy a ton of t1 subcaps (especially battlecruisers and under), but you won't really be able to afford that many T2 cruisers and above.
---
You could try market trading, start doing pvp (there's always the classic, buy 50 T1 frigates, fly them to an active lowsec system and take any fight you see), try FCing, get into better PvE activities (a decently skilled PvE few months old char should be able to do 100mil isk/hr)
---
Just remember that making ISK shouldn't really be an end onto itself. Why did you want to make ISK? Market trading? Burning it all in pvp? ISK is a means to get something, not an end onto itself.
---
Y-you're joking, right?.... Right?
---
Traitor
---
what are you talking about? this isn't the first time null will have had no local.
---
Many krabbers buy PLEX with ISK anyway- they're contributing nothing to CCP's bottom line.
---
thats the joke
---
*You have 19 messages remaining*
---
No I mean there's all these retards thinking meat's back on the menu but there's an equal number of goons or test or whatever also doing exactly the same. It's a benefit to everyone who likes to pvp in relative safety. 
---
You don't even need to do anything, you could literally go to a region and do nothing except be seen to cause chaos. You could also infiltrate a corp and feed them bad intel to make them paranoid. It's hard to verify if there are in fact 150 bombers if you can't see them in local. A few alts could drive intel fucking insane. It's great.
---
Also I don't see how this will affect bots, they are the winners here I think. They'll be docked before you even know they are in system, they aren't going to go "oop, welp.. no local, lets go play wow". They'll just adapt their software and become untouchable.
---
This is the age of bots and no one will be able to see them.
---
cause its a playerbase that doesnt interact just creates isk inflation, a vast single universe that was eve feels like a lot of singular systems where there are 30 people in local but have docked 2 minutes before you entered systems because of intel channels and out of eve programs.
---
OBSERVATORIES were shown in the 2017 eve vagas

---
What ship are you using for level 2 security missions? A destroyer should be able to clear those confortably, and maybe even some frigates, with better skills.
---
Best money makers for beginners usually is exploration (go to nullsec through a wormhole) and gas huffing (extracting gas in a wormhole).
---
Missions are not really worth doing except maybe for L4s (but even then, there are better ways of making isk). Gas huffing has a steep startup cost for a beginner (roughly 30mil isk to buy 1 skillbook), but it is the most reliable way to make isk as a beginner, although it can be dangerous. Exploration can be done with the ships you receive in the exploration tutorial, so it's essentially free to start. You might want to train all of the skills in the scanning section (as an alpha, takes roughly 2-3 days), it will help with scanning and running exploration sites.

Go CCP finally shacking things up! Keep it interesting!
---
If you think this is going to get rid of intel networks and bots you are dreaming.  It will change the dynamic in which they operate but if you think this is going to be a situation where you will be able to hunt a coalitions space in peace you are pie in the skying it.
---
no it doesnt, this mentality is bullshit and is the reason why the game is stale right now.
---
Instead of changing the fit for you, I'll just teach you how to easily do it yourself. This way you'll be able to apply the knowledge to any future fittings too.
---
First, select my fitting and hit ctrl+C to copy it. Then go to the game and open up the fitting screen (ctrl+F). Now in the bottom left, there is a button called something like 'import export'. Click that and then select 'import fitting from clipboard'. In the new window that opened up, click 'simulate fitting' at the bottom.
---
This should load up the Vexor fit I posted in your game, so you're in business. Now to the top-left of the image of your ship, there are two buttons that swap between two modes. One of the modes tells you which of those mods you can use, and which ones you can't (they'll be outlined in red). Now that you know exactly which mods are the problem, you can start looking for alternatives. Right click on a module you can't use, select 'Show Info', then go to the 'Variations' tab. This will bring up a list of similar mods with different stats - some are way better and more expensive, some are cheaper and require less skill to use. The first group of modules in that list are the meta versions - the ones without any color in the top-left cornet. They'll have some prefix in front of their name such as 'enduring', 'compact' and so on. Those take very little skill to equip, and they should all be usable by alphas. So select some of those replacement mods and you'll be good to go shortly. Even if you can't use some of those, most should only take an hour or so of training to meet the requirements. 
---
I'd post some pictures to go along with this, but sadly I'm not at my PC currently so I can't. If you get stuck somewhere in the process, let me know and I'll elaborate.
---
Soo we will have 30x more active krabs? There is no AFK ratting with caps, all this vnis, Ishtar and mach will suddenly play the game with 10x more focus? I say that's a win/win.
---
Shhhhhhhhh, it’s a secret.
---
Thank you!

I actually hurt my back in november and havnt been able to sit in a few months. But its better now and I can atleast sit long enough to harass /r/eve before I need to get up and walk around.
---

---
you don't want CCP to do dogfighting, it's not going to what you want it to be.
---
No I meant the player on player stuff.  Like the hate between pve people and pvp people.  We should be trying to get people to play the game not ostracizing people that dont play the game the way you play.
---
As an aside I typed a response to someone else and posted on accident if you saw that.
---
Gallente has railguns too, which are mid-long range weapons. Gallente and Caldari actually both have ships bonused for Blasters/Railguns (together called Hybrid Weapons)
---
Drones are the ultimate range weapon, since they hit well anywhere close-long range. Drone skills are actually pretty important since a lot of ships from all races have some drones as well as their main weapon. Drones are both a main weapon and a side-weapon so they're actually pretty important to train, whatever ship you choose.
---
All of the ships are actually fairly well balanced, so that's why people are telling you to train whatever ship looks cooler to you. Only in the higher end content does it really matter if you're using lasers, or drones, or hybrid weapons, or projectile weapons. By the time you end up at the higher end content, you will probably have trained into most weapon types anyways.
---
You won Eve, so stfu. Your ideas don't matter.
---
Is the local gone already? Tbh on vacations now
---
Pics or gtfo
---
&gt;You moved from flying a 5b Golem in highsec to flying a 15b Hel in nullsec because it's actually safer right?
---
these aren't the people threatening to unsub - these are the only 'krabs' not impacted by these changes at all.
---
Lol, when I had finally decided "OK, this is time to leave high sec and go PvP", I had left my trusty mission-running Drake and what few implants and mods I had at the station I run the missions at, exactly for the same reason - what if it doesn't work out or I lose everything. Hadn't been there since, the drake still sits there, waiting. It's been 12 years...
---
Don't say that man. I believe!
---
That's cute , but do you have any proof of it not being the case?
---
You're right, rolling holes, critting or setting up scouts on the statics, waiting for Bob to offer a hole that's got enough anoms in it - none of that stuff is a "grind."  I just have isk handed to me all day long.
---
this will be very nice, as the bigger alliances probably wont have people at every gate. black ops will be very valueable.
---
I guess I need to read this thread of people threatening to unsub.
---
pffffffft, i can fit TWO whole pizza in my mouth, try injecting more points into mouth skills
---
cya 👋
---
A test? Where do you get that idea? From CCPs track record this is about as permanent as you can get, because once they change it, they will fire the only person who knows how to change it back because of "Legacy Code".

They won't be able to cave, they will release the one dev who knows how to revert it next week. Then claim we are stuck with it due to Legacy POS Code.

Seeing as how he is FOR the blackout, your analogy makes zero sense.
---
You do know you're preaching to the choir, right?
---
&gt;How would the recent removal of local (or other changes, for that matter) do anything to help the problem?
---
It seems its basically CCP giving up on trying to get rid of bots, so now the players will do the work instead.
---
The only reason he cares is because it’s going to be harder to use his 50 alt accounts that rely on local to do anything meaningful.
---
Crabs want to crab and being safe and when they are forced to pvp they want to win so the just join the biggest block anyway.
---
CCP trolling their playerbase, what could go wrong?
---
my prediction: people don't undock.  wars are put on hold.  the weekend of the blackout is the boringest shit ever to happen as hunting without local and no prey is a fucking slog.  CCP somehow thinks it was a good idea and implements it fulltime, claiming that the game is now "fixed" and no other changes are needed.
---
(probably)bots and renters - your point?
---
what is a good ship to do the epic arcs?
---
The fit he linked is 100% an alpha fit, you might not just have the skills to fly the modules yet. That's why the previous poster said you can replace the T2 versions (ex: 10mn Aftrrburner II) with the T1 version (ex: 10MN Monopropellant Enduring Afterburner or 10MN Y-S8 Compact Afterburner). T2 versions are better, but not necessary to start out.
---
If you want an Amarr ship to run the missions, you could also try this one:
---
[Omen, PvE Mission Basic]
---
Focused Anode Medium Particle Stream I
---
10MN Monopropellant Enduring Afterburner
---
Patterned Stasis Web I
---
Optical Tracking Computer I
---

---

---
It would be a Goon that asks for that.
---
Those are the only people hunters ever get to kill, so yes, it will be a bad thing because the hunters who cried because they weren't getting easy kills still won't get them, resulting in them crying some more until CCP gives them another lollipop.
---
TL;DR: "REEE"
---
That's because I'm a pirate that need to do some ratting on the side, so of I get caught I might very well enjoy the situation and try to at least get a kill.
---
You first.
---
I was literally wondering what happened to you the other day. It would be a decent month to resub for WiNGSPAN, mmazing. Check slack if you're still on there.
---
&gt;You screeched Adapt or Die to everyone else for over 3 years, now it's your turn to adapt for only the next 3~ weeks. 
---
If it turns out they get ganked too often, they will simply not undock. It is very unlikely you will get more "content" because of this.
---
If a couple have that many accounts between them then its probably for the best if they unsub. That doesn't sound healthy.
---
#2 less spodbrains
---
Exactly this. I don't want to spend several hours a day sitting in my rorq just to make the same isk as a few hours in my dread. I don't need a second job.
---
No, read it.
---
Cheers dude ... got it now :)
---
l answered yes to all 3 but l'm still going to mine away and get space rich, if l lose a ship or 2 ohh well l have spares
---
#Meats back on the menu boys.
---
Wonder where the targets will come from ...
---
Follow it thru. Once they unsub, who ya gunna hunt? Who's gunna make your bling stuff? Short term boom. But unbalanced.
---
I imagine this will stay on SiSi as CCP's way of making it harder to insurance fraud shit to get boatloads of ISK.
---
LML nano Jackdaw is pretty fast, warps in under 2.0s, and costs around 60m ISK.   
---
Almost all AFs with a PVP fit and some kind of active tank can run them fine, Vengeance/Hawk/Ishkur especially do well here.  
---
If you want a covert cloak, an astero can run and tank the sites just fine, it's a little slower that AF/T3D but that's fine.  
---
LML Crow can do them too if you absolutely want to be nullified. It's slower than the Astero though, but still won't take longer than 3 hours to go through an entire arc.
---
15 minutes undisrupted maybe worth if it can cyno directly to key systems and release entire corp if subcapitals to attack enermy’s weaknesses or capture entire system
---
Hunters Don't like being hunted. When faced with equal force's, most just run. There's few in Eve who want honest PvP.
---
Rooks have a flight of light drones. I suppose you could ignore them in order to hide better but that’s dps you’d be missing and that’s something to avoid as a ratter.
---
Scanning a system with people in local is significantly different than scanning every system to see if anyone is online. The map and Dotlan are notoriously wrong. The grass isnt always greener.
---
What was wrong with wormhole space? Why didn't you do it there? Your answer will probably be why this won't be a success.
---
And that is exactly the attitude you need to have.   
---
It is perfectly fine to be a krab. Make all the money you like, but don't expect perfect safety and understand shit will happen. Don't fly what you can't lose etc :P
---
Most goons have been asking for this for years, in fact.
---
Pain in the ass :D. Get 2-3 guys sitting in a rolling megathron and most of the large holes will be gone in 5 minutes.
---
Stop bitching and find ways to enjoy the game
---
Good attitude :)
---
Adapt or die
---
Strat
---
I don't understand the question
---
people playing the game = they are out in space doing stuff, the current iteration of intel provides too much safety for people pveing and a lot of "big name" content creators have left the game due to it becoming stagnant and not fun anymore, so there are two ways you can go about it, either all the pvpers leave and it becomes farmville or you adjust the  risk reward for both. There is no way you can force people to not use intel channels, all you can do is hide it from them.
---
I am not a HS pilot. :)
---
not undocking and feeding free kills is adapting, since the other option was dying.
---
I see that you, too, are a purveyor of The Black Library.

No it is legit. Some people turn down some sound dials to unfuck their ears, and one of those dials happen to have gate activation sound when zoomed in. It is legit.
---
Yes, but it still gives you idea where to go to find prey. 
---
And what is their main time zone.
---
And players can do nothing to hide from this.
---
The reason I unsubbed my accounts has nothing to do with safety or whatever other shit the "eLiTe pVpErS" throwing shit at people on reddit/eve-o will inevitably reply to this comment with.
---
My reason is simple: I very deliberately chose NOT to live in a wormhole, because I have no interest in that play style. I've spend almost 2 years making a home in null, and now CCP has apparently decided null players should live like wormholers.
---
So my choices are: accept it and play like a wormholer, which I have zero interest in. Move to another area and throw away the last 2 years of my play time to start fresh, which I not about to do. Go play PUBG, or whatever the new version of that is these days.
---
Since CCP apparently feels we should be all about instant gratification anyway and doesn't give two shits about those of us stupid enough to have been doing long-term empire building shit, I guess the best option is to go play PUBG.
---
Cheapo T1s are the way I've been going lately. Now I'm never afraid of being blown up.

---
Nah the map gives you a good idea of where people are doing stuff.  It's delayed, not 'wrong'.  If you get there and there's nobody out then they probably saw you on intel and docked when you were 5 jumps out.  I almost always find wrecks on scan in those systems.
---
Also I'm spamming dscan all the time as I pass through systems anyways, so I don't really see how this makes much difference for me as a hunter.
---
Can a strat actually apply enough scram points to hold a super? It needs like 25 scrams or 10 I forget.
---
The commtents there 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣 top kek
---
To add to this, a 10 man gang of even just T1 frigs will shred any subcap unlucky enough to be dropped onto.
---
you already were BOSONing atrons anyway so it's not an adaption.
---
Tbh the added lack of safety that is coming up makes me want to sub more accounts. CCP is going big balls mode and it's beautiful.
---
I'd say because carriers use fighters, which are even smaller than frigs, and fairly versatile in terms of application, they're just like a squad of geckos. 
---
Maybe it's more of a lore-based point, but carriers can target anything on grid, and are a massive step up in sensor capability Vs any subcap. They should be more 'anti subcap' than most other capitals due to the fact that they can use light, support, and whatever the anti-drone ones are called (grams etc). 
---
Personally I think dreads and titans should have difficulty Vs anything that isn't a capital, while carriers should be the most versatile of  them all in terms of application and targeting.
---
Folks talking about how CCP keeps 'hurting' nullsec. Eve is supposed to be hard, and while i might not be the ruling authority on the matter, Nullsec should be the hardest to live in. The greatest freedom with the maximum risk. IMO, currently, it's a bit easy to get comfortable and assuming your not a smoothbrain.
---
you can just look at the gate  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Oh, but it does take on a delicious new flavor with no local. Is Sisterfister logged in or not? No one knows~
---
I really liked her voice
---
Lol a whole 1 pilot from pl and four nc.
---
Which 2 where in feroxes 😂 but looks like a gf anyways
---
It can certainly evolve towards what you say to certain extent . But dead end systems simply can't host that many ratters and miners. 
---
Ratting and mining pipes/systems will also eventually be bubbled and gate camped with roaming fleets attuned to the patterns over a few weeks.
---
Nonetheless, the flux and chaos will be interesting the first couple of months. 
---
For active ratting, abyssals are better and I feel that's where people will start to move. In active abyssals, with 3 toons, you can make way more than 3 rorqs or carriers. Abyssals are also relatively hard to not but would be more safer than null.
---
I think it will certainly hit botters the hardest as they hunted down especially if it is a coordinated campaign. 
---
I don't think it will completely solve the botting menace (they just need to be left alone for 3-4 hours to start making profits off vni/myrms.) So, 100s of botters, 100s of systems, so chances of beingnisk positive are still great for botters. I feel they will continue as is but pvpers will have more easier content and it will improve 'perception' of making things better.
---
Imo bit too early to tell what transpires.
---
Local has been on the chopping block for a while.    Think back over the last couple of years.   Small disruptions, then more wide spread, now a "temporary" official removal.   It is simply being done in stages to acclimate people to the idea.
---
Well stop acting like one
---
Nail on the head Bro
---
Ok wow that DOES sound like a huge change! Local chat is de facto for many MMOs, this is crazy!

---
Yeah when was that? a decade a go?......before citadels? before fosisov? before inyectors and alphas? dude this is a totally different game now. To the Imperium is nothing, we adapt and make shit happen....but to new players and small groups....this does not make it easier...far from it.  EVEN more consolidation will happen....the more the environment is hostile, the stronger home you built.
---
That is exactly how "delayed" local works. I don't know if everyone here get that, but to be fair, the term delayed isn't the best.
---
ofcourse i have

It’s 25, I thought it was +3 per level no +5. Still though 2 strats together can hold it

did you read the post?
---
It says "stop reeing", which is the opposite.
---
And if I log off in system and come back later?  Does fancy gate bot know instantly if I'm back or not?
---
When the Kids show the CCP Art team how it is really done.
---
I like how everyone seems to consider small gang PvP the holy Grail that will save the game. When I first started EvE, I decided to try a bit of small fleet PvP, and after a two hour snoozefest of at best uninteresting conflict with no meaning, I've avoided it like nails on a chalkboard ever since
---
Did you read it? It's a dude reeing about people reeing. 
---
TL;DR: REEE.
---
&gt; Yeah when was that?
---
like a year or so ago. very recent.
---
it was the same game it is now.
---
I changed from that 1 year ago. Never been happier
---
Is that dread bomb logged in or not? No one knows~
---
oh wait i forgot it's already replaced _damn_
---
Bitching is how I enjoy the game. Sitting in a beer garden with a few eve mates shitposting on reddit is the new meta don't you know.
---
Then hunters need to adapt as well, I dont see a problem with this. We all know that someone will be out in space, eve players are some of the greediest people i have ever seen. It's all just a matter of when someone gets the withdrawals of not getting them sweet ratting ticks.
---
But you dont mean that at all. If you look at player retention which is at 4% after 30 days, do you really want "die"?
---
Dreads have to log in at a station, though, and stations have a guest list.
---
Lol, wasn't the answer I was expecting, but that also explains it. 🤣
---
I'm running a FW toon and it's making a good amount of LP, but the time and effort it takes to sell those LP is not worth. It took me 3 months to sell what I got in 2 weeks doing FW, and I had to sell everything much lower than I anticipated.

Something they made into the optimal style gameplay by a massive margin with citadels, carrier/super changes, rorq changes and a host of other things.
---
It looks pretty cool, the colour scheme does give some FTL vibes (I always loved how colourful some of the ships in that game are).
---
&gt;Then hunters need to adapt as well, I dont see a problem with this.
---
How do you adapt to no content? I can definitely see ratting only happening under the umbrella.
---
&gt;It's all just a matter of when someone gets the withdrawals of not getting them sweet ratting ticks.
---
If ratting turns out to be a death sentence, they will just stop as there is no point.
---
Sorry folks. Eve evolves and has been for 16 years. If you don't like it, there's that saying many have said to me before... adapt or die.
---
Basically it came down to this... null sec has the most rewards, but it's pretty much policed by the players. The players forgot that and decided to peace up in harmony and become the carebear land. Everyone is sucking everyone's cock and no one is slapping the hoes around.
---
That's where the Drifters come in. Swinging their big cocks and smacking the shit out of the new age life is a cloud of puppies and ice cream soft jelly belly pudge dweller. 
---
Now null local is getting jacked and pimp slapped. So... man up you pansy asses and fallback to fortify your stongholds. Condense your space, make room for Daddy, and wipe those salty Goon tears off your pimples face because it's time to grow up!

With a super, you could always just warp a cloaky next to it and use the cloaky as a warpin point with a HIC or dictor. As long as your non-cloakies are beyond 14 AU of the site, the super can still get scrammed. You need a gang to kill a super anyways.
---
And you gonna do what exactly? Go and rat? Or go and try to hunt even rare prey? The question is whether there will still be prey or not.
---
where was this concern about new player retention when pvp'ers were the one having their playstyle clobbered? 
---
here's the solution to fixing player retention - go out and fight each other. Enjoy fighting the 20-30 man caracal gang that comes to your space with something other than OVERWHELMING FORCE TO DEFEND OUR HOMELAND and gosh who knows you might even have fun
---
or die, I honestly don't care. I've had to suffer through 5 years of CCP systematically destroying my playstyle and now that bears have a taste I can sustain myself entirely on their salt.
---
Goddamn I do love me some satisfactory. Vertical level builds are superior to all others.
---
do dreads have to log in at a station? or can they prestage logged off in space? 
---
asking for a friend
---
It's a whole lot more sensible than rage unsubbing, FW missions ain't even risky lmao
---
I've never played before, but all this salt about things being shaken up has made me seriously interested. Would it be okay for me to go and ask a ton of questions?
---
You can always know where someone is from the wrecks.
---
It's easy to say adapt or die when you don't have to do it yourself.
---
It's me! How am I supposed to make ISK now?? Waaaah!!
---
They certainly can, if you dedicate alts to log them off in space. That being said, how long does that take to set up? How many alts do you need to dedicate to it? How often can you do it? And, lastly, how worth it is it to go to that much effort with the FAX girth that contemporary umbrellas have?
---
Good to see players adapting to the new gameplay.
---
Kestrel is not kill. I'm still having good success in various flavours.
---
&gt;where was this concern about new player retention when pvp'ers were the one having their playstyle clobbered? 
---
Probably exactly where it is now.
---
&gt;here's the solution to fixing player retention - go out and fight each other. Enjoy fighting the 20-30 man caracal gang that comes to your space with something other than OVERWHELMING FORCE TO DEFEND OUR HOMELAND and gosh who knows you might even have fun
---
But "forcing" people to sit under the umbrella encourages this kind of overwhelming force.
---
I think you are forgetting eve is a game. Besides ore makes those ships that you like to pewpew with. Without krabs there would be way less of those titans and supers that win nullbloc engagements.
---
In years of pvping in modern day nullsec, including Delve, I've never once died to a boson. I don't personally pay any attention to local and have no clue who bosons. I've been hit by a boson a couple times, but every time has been against me in a blinged loki, so I just tanked it and jumped.
---
All I do is play careful when warping to gates in Delve, and for the most part don't go more than 2j from the wormhole regardless of where it is cause rolling it with 4 dedicated roller alts is just easier than gating.
---
bye
---
Thank you for this. I am happy to lose faceless krab npcs. I "know" hundreds of these in Dreddit, I don't care whatsoever about them, I care about the guys that came out last night when I yelled HE CA TE and got dank frags.
---
Wish we could've gotten a better fight, fleet was a little ganky.
---
Read my comment again.
---
  I'm not against PVE. I'm against people who exclusively do it 24/7 in a nullsec alliance. You're a combat pilot first and foremost. Everything else is secondary.
---
There's also the situation where you're most likely going to be taxed if you're not in your own WH
---
You should probably point out in the middle of your meta whine that this is for the null sec epic arcs that will also be having the no-local.
---
If you want the other arcs, you need a bigger ship.
---
If you were to use available T2 BPO, wouldn't you at least make sure it's always in use while you expand with invention?
---
Thank you for the asset safety link, considering returning and I’m certain I’ll have to track down old assets
---
Isn't it exactly what CCP calls "delayed local"?
---
I unsubbed because I was bored.
---
So far this event has just made all the nullsec entities go into full turtle-mode while they wait to see what is happening. That means very little content that I enjoy, its mostly just been drifter response fleets (zzz). 
---
Maybe this event will eventually have some good long term outcomes for the staleness of the game as it is currently. Lord knows null could use a good shake up. Meanwhile I'll just watch unsubbed from the sidelines until such outcomes happen.
---
Don't even bother.  People like him are impervious to logic.
---
and the trove of spais/awoxers (that admittedly couldn't compete)  
---
:)
---
They don't need a cloak. All they need is an alpha account with a fast frigate orbiting the gate at 1000KM, if not tethered to a structure. Very hard to probe down, hard to tackle it if you do.
---
equivalent?
---
As someone who krabs C5 and C6 space in dreads, the margin's aren't even close. 400m an hour super ratting? Try 2b an hour with dualboxed dreads.
---
I know very few people that Exclusively mine/rat and do nothing else in the game. Most people mining or ratting have goals. I don't know many super or titan pilots that weren't rorq miners at some point. Krabbing is the meta because Krabbing builds supers and supers win wars. Don't get mad at people for playing around the mechanics in place.
---
you are probably right, I always saw isk as and end to it all because I never had it before lol.
---
I really am into mining and Industry, I have a char that is pretty much maxed out in trading so maybe produce stuff for my system and try to get ultimate control or something? I dont know... I still love mining but I am not in Null so thats a problem since I cant fly a rorq :-/ mmhhhh I need to come up with something.
---
Tbh, what i fear is that this will again stomp on the online numbers and like always EVE will not recover.          
---
This is just a test run for CCP but even before it started it is costing us real players.        
---
CCP is trying to make game flat ... while it should be making game more diverse.       
---
We have plenty regions some of them could be  :     
---
* perma cyno jammed by some natural effect        
---
* no fatigue in another       
---
* high wh k to k in another       
---
....       
---
Forcing players into gameplay they dislike is just bad.
---
Losing local and actually checking dscan when undocked isn't playing like a wormholer, it's called being forced to be present and active while playing the game.  Not having local is like, 5% of wormhole life. Wormholes also have mass limits, no cynos, changing connections, limited access to kspace, etc.  
---
To quit playing over not having local and saying it's not over safety but because you don't want to be a wormholer is contradictory.
---
If krabs believe that nullsec ratting isn't worthwhile they will venture to different areas of space to do their PVE. Hunters can follow.
---
RIP CCP Defenestrated.
---
" 'cause I lanced a hole into the side of that "OP pls nerf" drifter pile "
---
RMT Deliveries best Deliveries.
---
If you have 1 monitor and no intention to split it between 2 clients, you can place a cloaky alt on WH / gate and then switch to your main. Unfocused client can still produce sound. In that case you use activation sound as your warning. Some people in WHs were doing this for quite a while.
---
That is my concern with observatories as well.  If they just return local the big alliances will have them and the krabs will (still) flock to the big alliances.  I’d much prefer it offered other intelligence and surveillance information about the system they are anchored in.  “How many players are in system” or “what ships are undocked in system” would be much more useful in low population systems than blobby systems.  
---
If there 5 guys in local, but only four people from your alliance are saying they are in system, who’s the 5th?  Much more useful than if there’s 100 in system, good luck tracking everyone down.  As balance, if you have 100 people in a system, receiving backup is much more plausible than if you only have 5 (besides cynos).
---
love how relevant this is 9 years later
---
&gt; I know very few people that Exclusively mine/rat and do nothing else in the game. 
---
  You must have tunnel vision then. There's plenty in the large alliances. 
---
  Supers alone don't win wars- Logged in players in ships, not krabbing win wars. 
---
  You can still have goals- Just wind down the 20 rorqs before a stratop. It's not hard. 20 hours a day you can krab all you like- But be available when the *alliance needs you*.
---
Bots are already killing that
---
Where does all the FW go on? I joined the Gallente’s military corp, and all the systems I visit on the Caldari side are empty at the Novice sites.
---
Just downloaded yesterday. Could someone give me a eli5 of that ccp to delete local video/post?
---
It shouldn't work like that. Are you sure they are all online?
---
&gt;1 monitor  
---
Filthy amateurs
---
Yeah...so...now the town won’t know where the bear is ten steps in advance and it can more or less vanish when it wants to.  That turbodunk starts to need to become more adaptable than just opening a cyno.  Sure, it will still work, but it becomes more complex of an issue.
---
Just type in 3200?
---
From the way he describes it, it's not likely this was from post-Citadel
---
Depends where you're at and who lives there, really.
---
With no local it'll be even more the optimal style for gameplay.
---
if you want to come hang out with some people and talk about spaceships that would be fine duder.
---
If enough people resub the hunters _are_ the prey
---
When they're not it's funnier. &gt; See helios sitting at 0 on a can with his mwd still running  
---
"eh I'm just gonna bomb"
---
A grind you say? What do you think Havens are?
---
Also people who dont actually pay money to play threatening to unsub. Thanks for helping lower plex prices. Ccp doesn't give a shit about you.
---
`I've spend almost 2 years making a home in null`
---
Try imagining being part of a group that has been playing the same playstyle pretty much since the game's inception, only to have it be nuked in favour of your playstyle 3 years ago.
---
Yet if I say that I want to fly a drake in KBP and get fun fights you'll just squeel `ADAPT OR DIE, WE'RE HERE TO BUILD AN EMPIRE NOT ENTERTAIN YOU &gt;:(`
---
I believe this is a great buff to new players. Don't get me wrong, you undock you accept pvp. However I've had to encourage so many new players getting podded in T1 explo frigs with 10 mill excitement of loot that Eve gets better. Now they can be podded with 50 mill of loot and I don't have to spend as much time running relic sites.
---
If they had removed infinite anomalies instead- you'd have the same whiney turbo krabs threatening to unsub anyway.
---
1) Join Goons or TEST, live under the umbrella. 
---
or
---
2) Find another game where we aren't beta testing major changes on live.
---
As far as mechanics that make living in a wormhole very difficult and inconvenient, lack of local is pretty low on the list...
---
Not to sound like the above person, but logically a WH is more risky than Nullsec. If you find a quiet spot, it's unlikely anyone will come across you unless they make an effort to do so and even still might be just a stratios/explorer. In a WH; it's a guaranteed % that someone who does pvp will roll your hole.
---
Same. I feel people here are being too happy about all the changes and not realising their inherent problems.
---
CCP needs to push further to make this event fun, not just making nullsec semi-WH space. Fighting an unending enemy without compensation is not fun, and it just drives blocs into turtle mode. This game's best moments always come from PvP and I fail to see how this will lead to more PvP conflicts.
---
it's a safe assumption this is a test run for seeing if the mechanics would be approved by a large portion of eve.
---
But then you have local.
---
where is bee flair?
---
Look for systems where some contesting is happening. You'll get fights in the plexes. We could use some help in Fliet for example.
---
Ur low class.
---
Sorry, could not resist.
---
Yeah some null is absolutely lousy with em. Look for astero lossmails wirh small cans in their cargo
---
Join a corp with an LP buying program.
---
Welcome to optimal use of game mechanics, coupled with an excellent organizational structure
---
And the dread is cheaper than whatever Battleship they would introduce.
---
Oh, my bad. Came unchecked.
---
Amen!
---
aDaPt Or DiE
---
annnd thats /thread
---
Honestly I’ll just be happy to have the “-“ be included as a character instead of being intentionally left out of the search.
---
No you haven't. You don't even play.
---
It is a trial run. If people keep logging in ... it will probably stay. If online numbers and subs will go down the drain - it will be first and last time this happens
---
The mineral prices on SiSi dont account for the difference
---
Right, but the rorq is like 7b with drones.... You should expect some decent survivability with that
---
Mfw memeing about how retarded observatory’s would be if this was their purpose, on comms last night and someone actually wants it 😂
---
Sometimes true. Sometimes not.
---
the sell value of the hull has nothing to do with it.
---
The mineral base prices on SiSi are not that different from TQ at present
---
Krabs should still be able to krab in relative safety.  I can see intel maps being modified to track allied pilots and ships.  Krabs will just have to check dscan and be aware that that Loki they see there isn’t on their friendlies list.
---
You don't understand how PLEX works do you?
---
I'm so excited for this change
---
all the old pvpers are coming back!
---
and then they will find out that there is nothing to kill. 
---
15k is the new 30k.
---
Holy fuck... I'm agreeing with stainguy...
---
No local doesn't suddenly spawn pvp'ers.
---
I've always loved my asteros. I'm afraid of bling fitting them even though I fly them often. They are one of the few ships where bling makes them God mode. I just am afraid of flying a 200 mill frigate.
---
Most people are not pissed about local, they're pissed about the stupid drifters
---
The only real outcome to this is that now, if you’re going to undock something, you need to be ready to defend it. If nothing else, it encourages more cooperative gameplay amongst friends and less of the stupid “dock up the second a neutral comes in system” nonsense. The people who do nothing but krab and avoid interaction with anyone else add literally nothing to the game other than inflating the economy even further.
---
There are base values on SiSi too....
---
Trit base price on TQ is 5, 4 on SiSi.  
---
Morp is 8970 on TQ, 6610 on SiSi
---
the base price minerals come pretty close to 100% of payout value on TQ, on SiSi they are wildly different.
---
The fallacy you seem to be ignoring is that jspace only needs to krab as far as the next whelp. You could try u docking to fight something instead of shooting red crosses for "more than a few hours each day."
---
You will not be missed during the blackout.
---
Silly me, I didn't realize the goal was to reduce complaints. I thought that the goal was to rebalance risk vs. reward.
---
the meta is the friends we made along the way
---
Since that is all Choco can get, yes.
---
I'm not sure why you'd invoke this particular screed in a thread about removing local. Is removing local supposed to encourage this?
---
Contrary to popular belief, it’s more fun to shoot at something that shoots back... the problem is that nobody wants to shoot back. Hopefully this change will force teamwork and actually lead to some fights between small groups since people will actually have to defend their shit if they want to undock now. The people unsubbing are people who likely were unwilling to interact with anyone else anyway, so who cares if they leave? The “space will be empty” argument is total bullshit when it’s already effectively that way since any time you enter a system, the 10 dudes in it dock up anyway.
---
lol bye
---
Apex Legends came out and I started playing that non stop, lol.
---
Wasn't a conscious decision to quit EVE, just kinda happened.
---
I'll still be in Wingspan when I come back :D
---
perfectly balanced, as all things should be
---
There’s almost 1500 people in your alliance. If your leadership does a good job with this you shouldn’t see too much of a change as a line member. Intel channels, scouts/pickets, QRF fleets, and constellation choke points will mitigate everything except WH threats. All this does is force sov holders to actually control their territory.
---
Just because this time around you don't like the gameplay being "forced" on you it is bad? 
---
I'd rather have ccp ruin the game with bold choices instead of the stagnancy of the last 3 years. 
---
The outrage of all the krabs because after 3 years of getting pampered the game finally gets more dangerous again is giving me such a justice boner that i might have to schedule a visit with my doctor.  
---
When all the dieing pvp groups were complaining about the state of the game it was "adapt or die".  
---
Now that the krab iskies are threatened suddenly there is a concern for player numbers and dropped subs.
---
As if this game hadn't bled enough already because everyone with half a brain left quit the game long ago.
---
When you say "local" you don't mean local.  You mean "some radar-like scanner system that automatically pings when something new is detected in system".  I mean let's separate out the chat function completely from its use: intel.   You don't need the local chat function at all except perhaps to spam dino ascii art at your enemies, which is fun but not the point... I digress.
---
It could have multi-system tracking function (past route decays) so you can see that, it can tell ship class and perhaps type, etc.
---
Anyway the point is this will be expensive to maintain and probably compulsory for all systems the blocs have.  Killing or disabling it will provoke a fight, yet, perhaps, but it'll be back up again right away.  So what's the point?  All this does is add to the required infrastructure in null-sec, that smaller groups already struggle with support, maintenance and defence of.  It's basically a further burden with no real benefit.
---
If you're going to remove local just remove it and be done with it.  Don't add superfluous extra reasons to turtle down in your home region.
---
So like how pyfa works? I love that feature
---
Not yet, I was referring to the Drifters in nullsec, which seems to have upset nullseccers more than losing local tbh.
---
And CONCORD.
---
Mauti is, in this case, talking about a c2 with c5/NS statics.  To roll the null hole u need:
---
1) 2 characters in higgs megas and 6-7 minutes (3 min travel time 5 min polarizattion timer) 
---
Or 
---
2) 4 characters and u one shot the gole.
---
HHCC. HHCH if shrink. HHHH if no shrink.
---
I'm someone who hasn't played EVE for over a year now but i still like to keep track of what's happening in eve from time to time , from what i've seen there is nothing changing that would make me want to come back to eve and with the recent crap ,i know i made the right decision.
---
I know Hilmar said he wanted to do something instead of nothing , i would recommend he start playing his own game first , see what's up.
---
Then it makes nullsec a worse wormhole. You put in all the anxiety and take out all the exploration and stuff like star effects.
---
Why would he want to play this? He didn't sign up for this. I didn't sign up for this. If I want to have no local and fight small gang, I would have joined a WH corp (I was in one for a brief while and I liked it). 
---
Your points are moot too. I always dscan because sometimes there are blue cynos, but that won't save you from a force recon or a Drifter fleet. I am being forced to be active and eat shit randomly because someone has a force recon. Besides, constantly dscanning is only one more button than constantly looking at local. It's not much more active.
---
They've said it will be of "undetermined" length. I kind of have a feeling it's going to last a lot longer than people think.
---
The tinfoil hat on this fucking guy
---
I'm a nullbear but I also run DED sites, Abyssals, epic arcs, exploration and other PVE stuff in high sec in between spodbraining. FW is also something I wanna get into and I'm training an alt just for that. Definitely keeps the game more interesting than being constantly holed up in null.
---
Let me reiterate this will have no change for people with bot intel networks as they will just sit on the gate.  This will make no difference for intel networks or bots unless you come through wormholes.
---
oh querns you're so far out of the loop. 
---
you're right who would ever go through the effort to stage a dread bomb just to catch idiot titans doing idiot titan things. Maybe some other game's players, but not eve players...
---
Literally nobody is asking for high sec to be more dangerous. What are you on about?
---
I'm surprised your leadership lets you post on reddit. Did you have to ask permission first, or just run your shit by the PR directors first?
---
Sure ... this one account will compensate all off us those ratters that will rage quit over those changes.        
---
In the end it will be less people to hunt again.          
---
Guess what majority null players will do ... they will not login if there is no local ... even less stuff to shoot at.           
---
WH population , or to be precise lack of it is best example.        
---
 At the end of a month we will have 5k less active players on a daily basis ... but the real damage will   be in sub numbers , so we get  bigger push from CCP for the P2W stuff that  base on extractors and skill trading
---
i'm logged in right now
---
ok then more changes, more changes more changes more changes. If they can afford to have 1 alt per system online and working on a relay way that they report a change in their overview so be it
---
Because it literally says that....  An undetermined amount of time.  If it is wildly unpopular and causing less content it will be pulled back.  Thats why I said temper your expectations because if this goes badly it will be reversed lol.
---
If they could enter wormholes I'm gonna live out of one
---
Or, krabs will undock because they can't help themselves. See goons on deployment.
---
Honestly, hearing this argument anyone would think that the typical krab was doing it for the pleasure. They do it for the money, and as long as they make more than they lose, they'll keep doing it.
---
Everyone a James315?
---
The kids grew up, the sandbox got stale, so CCP drops in a bunch of piranha. Love it.
---
&gt; But "forcing" people to sit under the umbrella encourages this kind of overwhelming force.
---
And that would be different than the current situation how...? If people stop being safe in giant nullsec blocs, if renters can't rent space safely without being farmed by roaming gangs because they don't have the intel net and umbrella in their regions, if people don't feel safe undocking to generate tax income and build supers to generate more tax income - maybe those people look outside of the big null blocs. Maybe they move somewhere and engage in content rather than sheltering in place. Or maybe they quit. I literally do not care. It's better than what we have now.
---
Can’t do much else with it but you can fit 6 scramblers and an armor tank on a curse lol
---
We’re gonna miss your 7 rorqual accounts. Really.
---
It just says starting, it never said “For the month of”.  Feels like people are trying to push the narrative that “Look CCP ONLY intended it for 3 weeks, I’m deciding it’s ONLY going to be 3 weeks hint hint,”.  
---
This need to happen ages ago, because we are fast approaching the era of 35b Titans and 3-4b/mo for plexing an account.   
---
Losses and risk make ISK and Mins worth more, the actual bad actors AFKing 10VNIs with zero PVP ships are the ones this hits the hardest.  Normal play patterns could never keep up with that, and it needed to balance far more connected styles of gameplay.  
---
Love your blog And content BTW
---
You obviously do not know the people of delve or the big power blocks.....
---
Do they all have ammo in them?
---
Do you group your weapons?
---
no they won't lol. people were krabbing in rorqs and supers in delve when it was the most dangerous place in eve to rat.
---
I unsubbed because I was paying different amounts on different days. One will expire at the end of this month and another expires in August. I may resub them both, but it depends how this turns out. I think this is going to backfire hilariously with regards to bots
---
Gosh... you might actually have to fly with friends now.
---
You do know that CCP makes more money from people who purchase PLEX in-game to sub, right?
---
nor do wardecs.
---
This may be a shock to you that some in null do pvp as well as pve and can manage without local. The nullbear is the one who has no intention whatsoever of defending what they are tyring to accomplish in space.  Granted not every fight should be taken, but the nullbear runs from every fight if they can. Local is the ol' reliable tool for the entitled nullbear.
---
Nullsec botting is a bit of an umbrella term for 2 problems that kinda plague EVE (and plauged them always).
---
1 - ISK making with low degree of user input required
---
2 - legitimate botting for isk making
---
The former tends to be assumed for the latter.
---
EVE has always had some kind of profession that provides decent isk semi-afk, but the anomalies introduction took this to a completely different level, as you can run a Vexor Navy Issue/Ishtar fit (it was named the ISKtar for a while), to require very little user input.
---
That way you can run 4-5 accounts doing the same thing semi-afk, with the ammount of work otherwise needed for 1 account.
---
Just warp at some range on the anomaly, launch heavy drones and orbit at range while they kill everything.
---
However, when CCP also introduced anomalies, they introduced easy isk making away from the mission hubs and the eyes of plenty of ppl, in the deep dark reaches of nullsec, which was amazing for legitimate botters who in hisec would run missions in Tengu's out of Motsu (or some other mission hub).
---
These botters went to nullsec and slowly moved up the tech tree, VNI (40-45m / h) at first, then ISKtar (slightly better and safer ship, harder to take down), then Thanatos (120-130m isk / h).... and some now have nyx's (400+ m isk / h).
---
Personally i don't think that there are many botters in Ishtar's today, outside of the chinese alliances; the chinese players came to TQ recently from the chinese server, and they have not yet fully moved up the chain.
---
VNI's, different matter, as some may be running alpha accounts in VM's (which for a very powerfull PC today is a breeze), to either semi-afk or automate their isk making.
---
1. Open info for one type

A tide of darkness spills forth. As it rises Bob and his children will rise with it.
---
A-FUCKIN-MEN
---
Who are you and what did you do to stainguy
---
cause you are on the wrong side of this..
---
They already do this. Most alliances do. Smaller entities can still do this. In fact, I’ve seen ones that do. If nothing else, wormholes just become more useful for sneaking into somebody else’s space.
---
&gt; so I want one ~~or two~~
---
Make all your weapons identical.
---
&lt;3 Suitomia
---
Y'know.. i'm okay with killing the game in the name of trying to make it more enjoyable for people who want to actively engage in something besides semi-AFK mining in complete safety. If it turns out that is all the majority of the playerbase wants from Eve then perhaps it's time for a mercy killing.
---
Then why are all the empire builder btw types crying and umsubbing?
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm not sure if these changes will be net good or bad. But removing local cannot simultaneously be a buff to this playstyle and destroying it. You can't have it both ways.
---
Could say the same thing about you.
---
And ofc the two goonswarm members say they want more conflict while being members of the large blue donut. The amount of self-awareness is astounding.
---
Yes ccp is at fault because they forced the MER meta. Yes goons are only exploiting the mechanivs as ccp gave them to us yadda yadda.  
---
Doesn't change the fact that you as players are also at fault for not taking a more risk embracing stance.
---
This might be the most butthurt I've ever seen you querns. It's very satisfying. 
---
Good luck defending your renters and pets when they don't see that roaming gang coming until they're already losing ships. Maybe Delve won't be all that affected - but all your pets and renters aren't going to be so lucky. They'll have to - _gasp_ - form up defense fleets and go hunting for the people killing them instead of just dropping supers on them until they go away.
---
Isk investment is generally a poor measurement of survivability and should not be considered as a reason for safety. 
---
But I mean if you buy a rorqual you are arguably buying the safest ship in the game, seeing as how the panic button bypasses EVE design by being complete, non-conditional immunity to harm. This opposed to let's say siege or bulwark (or whatever the marauder mode is called) which leaves it extremely cap vulnerable.
---
Tl;dr you're getting the safest ship in the game already when it comes to cost.
---
True facts. Im building a circular skyscraper where different parts of the circle lead to separate factories and all the storage and material input is in the center. Gonna be sick!
---
No.
---
I look forward to the increase in subs from this legion of pvpers. 
---
The data is going to be very interesting.
---
Lol, he cries about it every time too
---
&gt;**If** it turns out they get ganked too often, they will simply not undock.
---
The 'if' being the key part of your statement. There's no certainty that outcome will -- or will not -- happen. 
---
It's about as vacuous as saying 'If a better game comes out, people will simply not log in.'
---
Too expensive. An assault frigate can comfortably handle every epic arc mission. Dual-rep Hawk is easy to fit and is probably the safest. Plus they have the advantage over a Sabre if you get caught by one
---
its ok, only the threat of not knowing will be enough for start, from then onwards we shall see what happens. First step is this is implemented, second step is this is permanent, after that only good stuff can happen
---
I don't krab for quite a while and those krabs are my source of income/fun, and due to CCP bad decisions they will not play
---
What pets? And when did anyone in the history of the game give two tugs of a dead dog's cock about the well-being of their renters? Shit, we don't even make money off of ours -- the whole point was for hostiles to not make money.
---
Got a few of those and i'm not a bot (astero losses with small cans inside ... use them for extra cargo), got some links so i know what i'm looking for ?
---
They have unsubtly hinted that asset safety will be on hold during the blackout. That's what the interbus border stuff is.
---
Basically yes. Afraid to lose and pvp is something that takes effort in this competitive game. You can learn something from a lossmail or not. I guess the nullbears just want their low effort gratification. But it's a sandbox and they can go to low or high sec if local matters that much.
---
This is a nice put together post and might help a lot of newer people. I’m not that new and still learned a couple things. Thank you
---
Roaming pvpers fighting roaming pvpers, just as the pvpers intended. Coming soon to a null near you.
---
Your vignette about dreads staged in space would work just as well today, if you spread the dreads out between multiple systems. Why is it, then, that it took years for y'all to bag even a single titan in Delve?
---
[Can do better](https://i.imgur.com/4SfRisr.gif)
---
Truth is, you will never be rid of bots 100%, i think the change has more to do with stopping the PLEX from rising and overall isk inflation.
---
I've been winning for a while, but I think with local gone things would be fine, back in my crabbing days, we already had people on gates two or three jumps out when the shiny toys were out.   This ads a bit more reliance on that activity and breaks some of the local based Intel external tools which is a good thing.
---
I  curious though, this was always the biggest thing yelled when folks complained about perma cloaked campers,  everyone's talking in these threads about "work to secure your space", but when you have a perfectly undetectable hole in the wall so to speak, how does one secure that?
---
Just get lucky that you catch their covert cyno bringing a small fleet in just at the right time? 
---
If local stays gone, and with it market an end to low effort isking in null, should we reconsider hunting methods with little to no active counterplay?
---
Time to buy some bubbles
---
too bad that is not the reality of the majority of scared players out there haha.
---
But you're not living in a wormhole. Which is where your argument falls apart for me. 
---
Have fun playing PUBG tho!
---
Nobody undocked with it either. The dudes who used to just dock instantly are just gonna stop undocking in the first place. As a hunter, this is just gonna make my d-scanning a lot more efficient.
---
No it is not. That's why you sometimes end up in situations where people just do insurance fraud on battleships because the payout is worth more than the costs to make it.
---
Changes coming are here merging the pve capability some for a more viable PvP boat when you make the swap I'd just drop a armor repper and add in a dda
---
You just sit tight and wait, I have the feeling shit's about to hit the fan.
---
I've unsubbed due to just boredom and this being the straw that broke the camels back. I don't even rat or mine, in fact I hate it. I've got enough isk to keep my sub up playing skill training/farming for a pretty long time, but in the end what's the point. The design decisions of CCP have made nullsec warfare (what I enjoy as a titan pilot) into nothing but structure shoots. I don't blame out enemies from not fighting, I mean, what would you do ? Some big last stand to just get obliterated ? That makes no sense whatsoever. 
---
The game has become, and for some time, into long periods of boredom/monotony with brief spurts of adrenaline filled greatness. CCP just seems intent on killing the game as I see it, ignore the CSM and has for years, and just do whatever they want. This step seems to be trying to undo what CCP Seagull put in place with the citadels/keepstars/empire building. Probably why they parted ways in the end, she had her vision, and Hillmar got a wild hair and decided he wanted to do something else, and here we are. CCP seems to just throw darts at a board and see what hits the bullseye, never really having a plan to anything anymore. At some point, its time to just hang it up. I went from 13 accounts, down to 3, and probably end up at 1 till the isk runs out. I will end up doing some ganking for pvp, since that is what I like to do.
---
The era of big cap battles I think is over. If anything, this may make us all blue each other, force all the null alliances to blue each other in the end, and put everyone in supercaps and rorqs - the exact OPPOSITE of what all the reddit screamers want to do.  People are going to do the easiest and safest thing to make isk, and that will end up being more supers online ratting/mining under a massive umbrella. CCP is just going to cause this to accelerate at a faster pace than before.
---
You do realise that it is used sarcastically, because it was the nullbloc narrative of the last 2 years, and now that change is happening that they are not benefitting from they suddenly forgot their own sweet words. Adapt, or die.
---
It would probably help a bit but CCP would lose a lot of income.
---
Just a question but what has been forced onto you at this scale in eve?
---
It is stupidly easy to bypass all that with Blops, bombers, and instawarp ceptors. You burn one ceptor to get as big a blops fleet as you want in any system.
---
Thanks! I understand a lot better now!
---
So basically, join Waffles am I right?
---
Independant lowsec/WH entity where community and comms are the most important things. We currently live in a WH but keep clones in our lowsec home. 
---
The motto is "max fun/hr" and oh boy do we ever!
---
Come and be a part of us, everyone knows everyone on a first nickname basis. I won the last karaoke night also.
---
Atleast take a look:
---
https://forums.eveonline.com/t/waffles-is-recruiting-low-sec-null-sec-wh-pvp-pilots/
---
Another thought, with null becoming potentially less safe then high sec (finally!), do you all think CCP might redress high sec safety as a way to heop retain the players that moved to null for safety reasons?
---
Meh just give the POS their infamous Skynet update back and let them roam the systems.
---
INB4 gankers employ their own explorer bots to find targets since no one would actually dumb enough to rat/mine outside super umbrellas
---
The various flavors of a given size and type (all of the different 125mm railguns for example) are called "meta levels." When you get there compare tool open on a type, look in the leftmost pane and click the box for meta level and it will arrange then all for you in this order (CCPlease make this a default).
---
The basic module (125mm Railgun I in this example) is meta 0. 125mm Railgun II is meta 5. You probably want to get meta 3 or 4. Meta 4 is "almost" as good as T2 (except it can't use T2 ammo) and therefore is usually the most expensive of the lot, for some things even higher than T2. Meta &gt; 5 is faction, storyline, and officer and you don't want those if you're asking questions like this.
---
"I tried it once for two hours years ago and I can confirm it sucks."
---
Fixed that for you.
---
Theres absolutely nothing wrong with how Dscan functions currently.
---
We need less automation, not more. So many whiny players expecting the game to play itself for you. The game shouldn't be warning you of impending doom (by immediately advertising names in Local), you should be actively watching out for it yourself.
---
And you are impervious to adapting, so i think you are gonna die :unsmith:
---
I actually don’t know how to digest this non troll pro pvp WITH built in isk making advise post. Like.
---
Friend? Team? Eve players? Hello? 
---
The game COULD become entertaining. I’m so scared to be hopeful. Fuck local.
---
&gt; how do you suggest someone find targets in the 30 different anoms in a system? 
---
Only about 10 of them are good. Hubs, Havens, Sanctums. Everything else is level 4 mission isk. If there are 3-4 ratters in system, blind warping to anoms has a good chance of netting you a kill.
---
Tl;dr
---
You wanna break that down for us champ. Because it sounds like a bunch of entitled bs.
---
Lol no you just might have to look at your screen
---
Yes, as soon as people do anything other than anomaly ratting in a vni/carrier they might actually have to expose themselves to danger while making isk.  
---
If they go to lowsec who tf cares if there is local or not, as in lowsec you actually have heterogenous groups in the same system, and not just the same color blue. So local doesn't represent the same issue in low as it does in nullsec.
---
This is why I first unsubbed last year -- I prefer lowsec and subcap combat. What felt like a concerted effort from CCP to drive people into nullsec is what made me not log in for weeks, then months. 
---
I personally give no fucks about empire building. I'm happy for others to be into it. But I'm not happy with the idea that nullsec ought to be end-game content. 
---
So I'm very happy to see CCP kicking anthills. The ants are currently scurrying about, but they'll eventually rebuild elsewhere.
---
PLEX costs $20. A sub costs $15.
---
Because every time someone logs dreads in in range of Delve they get scouted.
---
Honestly Querns it ain't all that hard. Local is instant, perfect intel. You're seriously arguing that removing that instant, perfect intel somehow won't make dropping supers more dangerous.
---
Ok. Good luck!
---
So the solution is... to give them even more incentives to do that.
---
Right.
---
Idk man the passive-aggresive smileys coupled with the same copypasted "heh null r crybabbies" post screams insecure HS wannabe.
---
You have no problem with hardcoded hotkeys?
---
It's not equivalent to the siege or bulwark. That would be the industrial core
---
&gt; And when did anyone in the history of the game give two tugs of a dead dog's cock about the well-being of their renters?
---
and then
---
&gt; the whole point was for hostiles to not make money.
---
I guess that's why you give two tugs of a dead dog's cock. Also stop tugging on dogs' cocks, regardless of their health. 
---
Renters make money. Either you have them because you want money or you want to hold space to deny your enemies money. You're really twisting reality here querns.
---
I have quite literally never heard of anyone doing this ever. Most alliances have local industrialists that buy the ore at Jita prices anyway, so there is not really a need for that.
---
Me low class ? :D
---
You did not get the memo :p
---
brave has a wh corp btw
---
Also called: basic knowledge.
---
Someone paid for their plex, so they are still making profit for ccp.
---
It's quite a stretch to tell me I'm a whiny player who wants the game to play itself just from that post.
---
Wow. Nice tribalism. All these hiseccers supporting shit they really don't understand.
---
you do, you can fit 30k dps tank, with a panic core, put out over 1k dps with combat drones, and if you're fit right, fight off a gang of 15 cruisers for HOURS.  If your flair is accurate you also have a cyno and a super fleet on standby.
---
Stop REEEing about survivability.
---
You do realize that local is being turned off throughout nullsec, not just in Imperium territories, right? Everyone's renters get hit equally; as in, they all get their shit pushed in. While I do think that turning off local is dumb, it does complete the objective of denying rental income to hostiles as an incidental bennie. Have you tried thinking things through further than "grr bee man?"
---
Plenty of new players who aren't going to have that basic knowledge, and probably aren't going to want to read through a tonne of guides.
---
I'd also doubt the way fractions of seconds of flight time work in EVE is anywhere close to basic knowledge, but maybe I'm wrong there.
---
Lol who actively scouts gates?
---
Yep, this is one of the first times where i've said "this reminds me of why i joined eve"
---
Yeah someone else has to pay ccp so you can play. They wont stop just because you rage quit. I will keep buying plex same as i did 5 years ago. Im fairly sure there are plenty of others who will keep doing it. So go ahead unsub ur rorq army.
---
 *Masochism* is the practice of seeking pain because it is pleasurable, named for Leopold von Sacher-Masoch from Lviv.
---
How would you scout dreads that log in in space distributed over several systems today, while knowing that they are dreads with enough time to prepare? Dread defense is 98% reactionary, with the other 2% being the hilarious bubbles on NPC delve stations. That shit ain't changed.
---
The portion of the playerbase that kept amongst themselves and added nothing to the gameplay... people who fly with friends shouldn’t care about these changes, as they’ll be able to defend anything they’re flying anyway.
---
So one thing I, among others, was told numerous times during my first year or two (in the UoC starter corp) by various alts; get out there and do something, put that isk to good use. And by that, they meant get away from mining, running missions e.t.c. 
---
My mentality at the time, similar to a few others in my position, was that I would go out and get into the mysterious/scary world of ~elite pvp~ once my skills had gotten higher. Or when I had enough isk. 
---
Basically I was making up excuses for myself, I was just hoarding for the sake of it... until I realised all the ISK, ships I was collecting at the time were utterly worthless if I wasn't prepared to spend them, so to speak. 
---
I imagine quite a few people out there have never come to that conclusion.
---
People will say this is a sandbox, you can choose your play style with some degree of freedom... but this is *inherently a PVP game*, and has been advertised as such (mostly).
---
If the people out there ratting can't adapt their fits to take hunters into account (hello, heavy neut domi!) or, heaven forbid, a change in isk-making activities (see everything Suit mentioned)... it's no great loss imo.
---
Im of the opinion that the rorq is in a good place at the moment
---
And how would ECM other than bursts help you?
---
Your mistake was thinking I only care about how this impacts you.
---
querns - not everything is about goons. _You_ made this about goons. I didn't. I'm happy that I get to hunt all the renters, all the bears. 
---
Not everything is about goons.
---
As you blind warp around and miss on the first 8 sites, what happens when someone hits d scan and sees you and sounds the alarm?  You get no kill.  You jump into system, use your d scan to find the ratter, land on them in the first try, score kill before alarm is sounded.  If you luck out and the combat anoms are within range of your in-gate or in-hole, you'll find them on d scan before your decloak timer.  
---
TLDR: Get good son.  Wormholer, btw.
---
You are not wrong.
---
&gt; not undocking and feeding free kills is adapting, since the other option was dying.
---
By living in nullsec you give consent for PVP with no retribution,deal with it.
---
Living in a random null pocket shouldn't be safer than living in the chain between Jita and Amarr
---
Local chat is a chat channel you join automatically every time you enter a system. It lets you see who else is in the system with you and chat with them, which is a useful feature. However, it is also a very useful intelligence tool - specifically, it lets you know whether there are enemies in system with you. So while you're ratting or mining in friendly space, you can easily see when a hostile roam has entered system, and quickly dock up. This has been widely criticized as overpowered and feature abuse, because it takes very little effort to stay 99% safe in nullsec. 
---
CCP have elected to spice things up by (temporarily) removing that feature from nullsec, some time in July. Instead, local will function as it does in wormholes - you can still use it to chat, but your name won't appear in the channel until you send a message. So now safety will be conditioned on physically looking at the gates leading into your system/pocket, and/or actively using d-scan to figure if any ships are coming close.
---
Highsec and lowsec will not be affected, and that's likely where you will be spending most of your time for now, so you shouldn't worry about the changes so much until/if you decide to come to nullsec.
---
Cool...then we are doing things right then.
---
I mean we will see, if the outcome of the blackout is negative then ccp can have the triglavs nuke the drifters and bam, we are back where we started.  
---
It's a fairly safe way to explore drastic changes.
---
Sure, but that's pretty much my point. You get something entirely unique that makes you entirely untouchable. Well worth the 7b investment imo.
---
There’s already no one to kill for a dozen jumps or more because they all dock up when they see anyone enter local or appear on an intel channel.
---
Park one of the bots by the WH.  As soon as you go to move you still have to decloak.
---
you guys don't get it..
---
Well you see when they log in, you see them in local, and start jumping faxes. The extra 60 seconds it takes for all the dreads to come out of warp and jump means your faxes land before their dreads do. 
---
Querns I'm tired of arguing basic shit with you. You would argue that you were wet when you left the house if you got caught outside in the rain. I get it; everyone is a moron and goons are the only ones who _really_ know what's going on. Go ahead and bitch to CCP with your handful of CSM members and let's move on, ok? Literally no one cares what you think outside of goons.
---
What about that would make them a bot?
---
its reasonable where it is, with 1 caveat.. it should be as hard as a carrier to multibox.
---
Being able to control 50+ at the same time should be legitimately impossible... 2-3 per person, seems reasonable-ish to me.
---
&gt;If they go to lowsec who tf cares if there is local or not, as in lowsec you actually have heterogenous groups in the same system, and not just the same color blue. So local doesn't represent the same issue in low as it does in nullsec.
---
Someone who finally gets it! 
---
You're not going to find a neutral PI hauler in the arse-end of Venal. The only neutrals in the far-depths of nullsec are wormhole explorers, and cloaky campers. In this case, there's very little uncertainty about player intentions. And I find that boring as fuck.
---
Don't get me wrong, I applaud helping newbies out with factual knowledge, I've been doing it myself for years both on YT as in Rookie channel etc. It's not meant as a critique, more a pointing fingers at non-new players who could/should have known this by now, but still don't. The sort of people you mentioned in your rage quit thread.
---
Spoken like someone who actually uses the UI.
---
There's no pretending Goons are crying. We've seen the logs. We've heard Mittens speak.
---
This guy searches
---
Ah, yes, the standard backpedal for when your weak attempt to catch me in a no-win argument falls through. Again.
---
They don't exist though.
---
&gt; But I'm not happy with the idea that nullsec ought to be end-game content.
---
Are you saying that Nullsec shouldn't be a type of end-game content, or shouldn't be what CCP think is the "only" type of end-game content? Because the first viewpoint is pretty narrow sighted.
---
one for one you're wrong as stated below... the fact you can box a dozen rorqs makes up for it though
---
[Over here, Stranger.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEAakGOwSqw)
---
i live pvp and pve in nullsec, you are an evewho away from searching my name dont be that dumb tia
---
eve players are so greedy, the amount of dummies that will die in the first couple days will be quite high.  
---
Same thing when they introduced the triglav incursions, mjfg, ...
---
But whatever will happen, what's important isn't that blackout will happen, but what we can learn from it for the future of the game.
---
How do you know that they're in dreads, though, if they're logged in in space? It's not like we have folks spaced out evenly every 14 AU in every system mashing d-scan every three seconds, every hour of every day. And, with local, you can easily insert a dread when no one's looking, so opsec stays intact.
---
Besides, this entire vignette *also applies to your whole "they can just not log in at a station with no local" bit.* 
---
C'mon, man. I need some actual grit here to whet my forum posting on. You're not cutting it.
---
On balance, given the complete absence of an argument in your response, I think you should probably fuck off.
---
It will answer the question what better for the game, being weighted towards the hunter or the hunted.
---
Is there a link to that information hasn’t heard this?
---
Ah, yes, the erudite internet arguer who is just so _tired_ of slumming it with us peasants but persists anyway. Nevermind that you assumed I was happy because goons would be vulnerable, when I'm just happy that _everyone_ in null sec loses local. You could never be wrong! It must be my argument that's wrong. That's it! Not your assumptions. No, never.
---
People have been using destroyers
---
Ah, I'm not rage-quitting. If I was rage-quitting there would have been more anger. I just need to take some time away from the game and re-evaluate how much I should be investing my time into it, as the things I used to enjoy in the game just don't feel fun any more, and honestly maybe that's just me being burnt out.
---
It's been a long, gruelling 3 years on the CSM, and I need to find my fun again.
---
done properly, you can chain roll c5s+ with 2 ships in under 2 minutes.  For low class holes, you can roll a c2 null in 4 minute with 4 battleships and a hic.
---
During the HK eviction, i'm betting the WH community rolled over 2k holes in the first 12 hours.
---
You don't matter and no one cares about you, or your dead alliance.
---
When you can't decide on one skin so you try them all on at once.
---
It's only 3 weeks and not permanent? That makes me sad. Not resubing then
---
Focusing on the "grr bee man bad" thing is not distracting enough to detract from your earlier misstep, friend.
---
yin tahn
---
Until we learn WHY CCP did this, their reasoning, I'm not applauding anything. I fully endorse the ideas but if it's done in a blind knee jerk reaction without any thought, planning or understanding we're just no better off than before, because it could be changed at any time and any sort of other random change might happen. 
---
If there IS a plan I'd like to know what the plan is and if it's "lets go back to a harsher EVE" THEN I'll applaud them.
---
Last email I got was may 28th. No deal, just a come play because the invasion is here. 
---
CCP can't market or merchandise.
---
I've learned that the average big bloc f1 monkey is pretty poor. I'm a btw so my sites drop 550 mil
---
or stop being a pansy as bitch
---
Your statement was "CCP doesn't give a shit about [people who dont actually pay money to play]." Given that they make more money from those types than they do someone who pays a monthly subscription, I can assure you that they care quite a lot.
---
any reason on why you think removing local is bad
---
yeah you got me querns. You think arguing is like a tennis match where you score points. Whoever has the most points at the end wins, right? And obviously you're the judge of your own scoring. If you think you scored - well fuck, I guess you did.
---
Unfortunately that's not how arguing works at all. But whatever makes you feel big and tall is fine with me, querns. Meanwhile I'm going to go and enjoy actually playing.
---
&gt;shouldn't be what CCP thinks is the "only" type of end-game content
---
This. For clarity, end-game content should exist in all four areas of space (HS, LS, null, w-space). Early-game content should exist in all four areas too. 
---
I absolutely resent the notion that the general progression for a character should be `starter-systems -&gt; high-sec -&gt; low-sec -&gt; null-sec`. There's been a few idiots running for CSM over the past few years that have actively stated that's how things should be. Rest assured I didn't vote for them.
---
Bring on the pain
---
It's a minor/moderate nerf to the most organized and a shot to the knees for the less organized. When looking from that perspective, it gives the more organized a stronger hand to play.
---
If you have a lot of space, you can afford to set up a "security zone" around a core moneymaking area under a capital umbrella. Your subcap ratters and miners are going to be at some risk, since cynos can't save them fast enough. However, Rorquals, Titans, and Supers are going to be relatively safe since they can tank until the cavalry arrives.
---
If you don't have the capitals to have a standing fleet create an umbrella, protecting your PvE is going to be hard, and your weakness is going to attract ratter/miner hunters until your people get farmed enough that they stop making money.
---
A fleet of Kiki’s came into our space last weekend. I’m not terrible active because eve has been soooooo...well you know. 
---
Anyway. I was on and seent them on intel and went bouncing through mumble channels trying to find friends to go brawl gloriously with them. 
---
In the most active channel I was told they were spider tanking destroyers from hell and I would never be able to kill them. I should dock up until they went away. 
---
Astonished I bounced to another mumble and found ravenously drooling pvp friends who were actively planning to introduce those jolly Kiki’s to a dumpster. I fairly effortlessly inserted myself into their plans and killed a bunch of (not spider tanking) Kiki’s. Survived at half hull in my Sabre and was really happy I clicked the log in button. 
---
Later that night while placidly mining on some dank ass spod...or was it bistot...with my single rorqual....a gang of CORMORANTs came into the area...THIRTY ONE of them. The fella “in charge” of our mining operation started to assure us we would be safe and everything would be ok. We were gonna dock if they crossed into I forget what system and it really doesn’t matter. 
---
This kind of cowardice literally pisses me off. Like. Do you fc guy where depends when you cross a street irl? Asking for a friend. Anyway no one my mumble was very interested in going to pvp those brave sons and daughters of Odin so I activated my chimeras jump drive and went to greet them by myself. I killed a hawk and lost a couple t1 fighters I built. Then I got yelled at for leaving the mining channel. Whew.
---
Not that jumping a carrier into some destroyers is really brave....I’m not beating my chest about how bad ass I am. Just that the people (in my alliance at least) it seems are less interested in pvp because they might die and mostly want to dock up in the face of anything. At least I can jump a carrier by myself and maybe have a good time. 
---
(I got yelled at for risking my carrier too) buh-hitch please. 
---
I’ve been tackled in my rorqual before and I’m always like “bet bitches let’s brawl” I’ve got my button and my cyno. Let’s make some content. Even if I lose the qual I hope to gain a good fight in the process. 
---
I’m excited about no local. So. Excited!
---
Not YOUR rage quit, the rage quit thread you made about the nullsec krabbers :P
---
The UI is very handy for dscan specific celestials/moons/sites when hunting, but the hotkey for “look at” an object isnt hardcoded iirc.
---
I'm pissing in the water supply so we have more Water!
---
Exciting to see if you find anyone to shoot
---
You can control your entrances in null... they’re gates, and they literally never change. People just might have to guard them now, or put cloaky alts on them to listen for gatefire, which is what wormholers already do. The disadvantages of living in a wormhole are mostly rooted in logistics. It’s very hard to get things in or out of a wormhole. Local chat makes things spookier but that’s about it.

The problem is if you have enough people that do not play the game out of fear you will crash the in game economy and it will no longer support pvp unless ccp seeds stuff on contracts.  I dont have the answer to this problem but I do know that the people that were risk averse when there was local are not going to be less risk averse without local.  At the end of the day you need pve players to keep the game a sandbox.  If you alienate those players to much it will destroy the ecology of the game.
---
I just trained into recons a few days ago. My body is ready.
---
&gt; what happens when someone hits d scan and sees you and sounds the alarm?
---
Nothing, since a recon/bomber can warp cloaked.
---
The new Intel bots are amazing!  They sit a cloaked ship near the gates (because cloaking isn't broken) and as soon as you have to decloak, the bot scrapes your name, ship type and corporation...  Honestly the Intel is way better, contains ship types and is instant!
---
I think CCP have finally done what nullsec was supposed to be.. dangerous..
---
You want to mine solo in middle of lawless space the  God damn right it should be risky.
---
But I think.this will affect the solo player massively.  Why should someone pay another sub just to scout or probe  is asking too much and given 80% of eve player solo regardless of being in an alliance it may have a huge impact.
---
You provably have not read the patch note on ECM sometimes ago. ECM jamming is useless now.
---
No, the mistake you made was trying to pull a gotcha about me caring or not caring about renters. It had nothing to do with what you thought. You thought that I couldn't simultaneously dismiss the well-being of our renters and assert that it was important to deny renting to hostiles. Turns out, I could -- no local does the job of denying rental income to hostiles far, far better than our initiative could. Thanks, CCP.
---
Learn how to read, please.
---
uhh...yeah dude...go for it
---
Good approach !!
---
Take time and please come back !!!
---
bad analogy
---
there is no gameplay difference between RMT and CCP's current p2w economy
---
Those already exist. I watch myself get reported in enemy intel channels on my spy alts the instant I break gate cloak all the time.
---
Does it count to be named krab when:
---
I am paying for my account via plex. 
---
So I do one week full time krab mode and rest 3 weeks doing pvp? 
---
Am I not something like 1/4 krab only?
---
Rorquals, supercap umbrellas, botched implementation of citadels leading to no objectives to fight for/hurting the already struggling fw, balance changes making caps apply perfect damage to subcaps, asset safety removing incentives to blow up citadels that have 2 timers timed to the convenience of the defender, suspension of tiericide, skill injectors fucking with the delicate balance invested/rewards, a cold war meta that forces people to fight rats and spod rocks instead of other players, perfect intel networks preventing fun roaming/concentrating all players of an alliance into a few systems of a region, ... 
---
All this shit has been shoved down the throat of people interested in meaningful, fun pvp. All we got for it was an "adapt or die". So excuse me while i go jerk off on the tears of the null crabs.
---
Myrmidon. Google how to regen-fit them.
---
I think a delay (an actual one) works way better, but honestly that's not a bad change. My disappointment primarily is w/ how CCP is developing and evaluating changes like the Drifters, which makes me think more grindy bullshit like that is coming, rather than actual improvements to the tools available to the players to cause damage to other people.
---
It feels to me like CCP sees the community as the problem, not their shitty game design choices over the past three years we've highlighted at every summit.
---
Delete support fighters, add fatigue to Ansiblexes, remove AoE DDs, fix TZ tanking, bring back weekend fights, have an active balance team, etc etc.
---
That would be a welcome change.
---
I heard this guy telling a noob how he should inject into a rorqual and then inject into another rorqual. And then inject into another rorqual.
---
Whoa. Whoa.
---
I quit eve and gave everything away. When I came back I injected a carrier, bought a hel, injected a nyx pilot and bought the ship. Then I injected a Erebus and bought the ship. Then. I stopped and just played eve to kill people(in game and in space). I’ve injected cyno alts and shit but whoa. Like I got some stuff and then quit the drug.
---
"Having no local is no-where near as bad for smaller corps, since you can all communicate well together.
---
"Hey phil is the Myrmidon on dscan you?"
---
"yes""
---
yup, that is how small corps work ..... /facepalm
---
this is probably exactly the conversation that CCP had and why they think that everything will be fine.
---
What on earth are you talking about?
---
Basically this. *downloads client*
---
Man, it is almost as if the crabs in nullsec actually put in no effort in trying to grasp the fabric of this game because their effortless playstyle has been catered to by ccp for way too long. 
---
Call me a bittervet but people really need the good dose of htfu that blackout will inject.
---
I also just resubbed yesterday + a handful of people from my old corp. First change for pvpers and hunters in a longggg time.
---
1) remove support fighters 
---
2) disallow anchoring of ansiblexes within 1000km of other structures/celestials/etc, remove reinforcement timer, double build cost, 2,000,000 EHP and no damage cap.
---
3) disallow the use of AoE DDs within 60 seconds of jumping in or within 100km of a station or gate (if not doable just remove them)
---
4) add stront bay for ref timer back into citadels
---
5) total removal of local, or with observatories but give them no reinforcement timers and low EHP
---
I think that rorqual drones should work like carrier fighters and you should have to do SOMETHING with each squad while they mine. Similar to the carrier rockets. Or like something similar to elite dangerous. Find the pockets of good stuff and mine that. Or get like hideously terrible yield or something.
---
GET RID OF THE DSCAN NOISE at least give us the option to switch it off on it's own
---
I'm withholding the applause until the change hits TQ. But between now and then, I'm warming my hands up in anticipation.
---
I think all of those ideas are interesting, and would probably be beneficial for the game.
---
I just have no faith that it'll happen.
---
&gt; I'd rather have ccp ruin the game with bold choices instead of the stagnancy of the last 3 years. 
---
if only there was a third option.  like a detailed plan to stop people from leaving.  instead we get BOLD choices that lead nowhere.
---
i mean, it depends on what you're mining and how big the rocks are.
---
And while they crab they endlessly go round and round about how much isk they have. Oh my god I avoid being in mumble just to skip that. “I just got my 3rd rorqual and I’m thinking about getting a ratting hel next month” 
---
Zomg shut up about you stupid fake space bux
---
Why are elite pvp people so happy about no local, I mean how elite is it to kill pve ships that has no counter.
---
It’s cool because it’ll force people to work together if they want to undock safely. It’ll also hurt bots, which I’m all for. As a solo hunter, my life will get harder because if I see something undocked, I can assume it’s more likely to be bait or at the very least, has a response Fleet on standby, but that’s a lot more exciting than shooting afk idiots in VNI’s.
---
instead of killing the game, CCP could, you know, actually try and fix the game?
---
Actually I don't know what is going to happen. All I know is that the game is already dead to me, and this might make it a bit better. Something had to change, lets see what the actual effect will be.
---
You look really nice today avree
---
Sounds like he joined the cfc and has a serious case of spod withdrawal. #helpfinancestainguyrehab
---
I hope they give it enough time for adjustments to take place tho.
---
You sure do have A fixation on querns. Its like olmeca and goons, but on a personal scale
---
Oh yeah the only thing unique about wormholes is no local chat. TIL.
---
Your safety against other players should be friendly players. But you’re right. The drifters, in their current form, are a bit silly.
---
You might have some of the turrets offline because your fitting skills don't give you enough power grid/CPU to use all of them. Check the fitting screen and see if they're greyed out or don't have ammo loaded.
---
*laughs in covert cyno*
---
&gt; non-carebear PvP corps
---
not in sovnull. most of the decent sovnull corps or alliances do both.
---
I don't know, why do you? You have stated many times here Globby that you don't play. Now suddenly you do? Nahh, you are just lying.
---
&gt;tribalism
---
*proceeds to regurgitate mittens propaganda*
---
Suitonia, you're goofy, but we love you.
---
I hate to be the skeptic here^1 but I'll consider resubbing if this mechanic stays in place after their test run with the drifters being the reason. 
---
CCP has walked the line of being bold before many times, and very few times have they ever crossed it before sprinting back across a few months later.
---
^1 ^(*Of course I don't hate it, I'm a bittervet, we exist to be skeptical.*)
---
ahh FFS its easy.
---
CCP sells plex for set price, (usually only limited sales) so Plex has a somewhat fixed Real dollar value.
---
RMTers, Sell plex for half price or cheaper. This undervalues plex VS real world dollars. This also adds more isk to the global eve economy. isk is easyer to acquire because of the cheaper price, thereby devaluing ISK as well. This mean every time someone RMT's your isk is worth less.
---
Kinda like whats happening with the US economy. becasue they print money from nowhere, through low interest capital loans.
---
How the fuck DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND THIS GLOBBY.
---
Good bye. I don't think anything is going to happen how you said it would. It's a temporary outage. If this short event made you quit, you should have quit long before this. There is so much more to this game than how you play, but that's your choice. Take a break and then come back and try something different.
---
My God read the fucking words and work it out you thick twat
---
You mean like... how it is right now?
---
&gt;I got yelled at for risking my carrier too
---
How can you unironcially care about someone risking a ~1b ship?
---
I did and it didn’t make any sense because you have no idea what the fuck you’re talking about.
---
Right? Like I’m not asking for anyone to replace it for me....I’m just trying to fight 30 nerds by myself and I don’t know if a battleship that can handle that.
---
A well fit battleship costs just as much lmao
---
I love the blackout idea in nullsec but is funny how hard CCP is trying to burn isk.
---
I think the new ratting meta will go something like Ishtar &gt; Gila &gt; Myrm &gt; Domi (with priorities changing from one to another depending on particular circunstances like how "afk" you actually are, if you are expecting a fight, have support and so on).
---
Ishtar and Gila would be the most similar to the current VNI, slightly better but more expensive.
---
We have ways of finding people.
---
I'm reminded of something Rainier Wolfcastle once said on stage.
---
If you’re joining a nullsec corp to not interact with anyone and just krab, I don’t really know what to tell you, dude. Either make friends, be ready to fight back, or go live in highsec where you can be safe from the big scary pvpers.
---
Not if there are tons of them and all at different ranges. Lots of shit to dig through.
---
i wonder if this dude is mental or an addict. "they'd do ME a favor, if they ban me" (c)
---
I would like to see no Warp capability, and next to no mobility at all. Only Jump drive, so you can jump cyno to cyno. Or maybe very limited mobility, and very low warp speed.
---
Problem is that there are to many systems 90% are empty and unused other then the occasional explorer. 
---
The game needs to change so that alliances have to Branch out again. This also fixes the problem where goons can harbour God knows how many players under a single supercap umbrella.
---
All your smug sperg for the last few months makes this whingey salt oh so funny
---
inb4 "EVE has sound?" 
---
Byt yeah, this is a totally valid request.
---
I get where you are coming from. ccp is shit at iterating on new content. Always have been. But considering that they packaged this in a timed event, they seem to be learning. It really isn't as bad as you make it sound.
---
Well, I guess you’ll just have to be able to defend stuff if you wanna fly it from now on.
---
I guess only mods can see modlogs? There needs to be a sticky for complaints and sticky for the people frothing at the mouth.
---
Me, an intellectual, just waiting around to see how CCP manages to fuck this up.
---
Mordus is belts too. Clone soldiers are rare spawn mordus rats are rarer spawn but when you find one you're guaranteed an orthrus or barghest bpc.
---
Danke
---
The best part is the ishtar and Gila have a better chance of getting off grid. Whereas the domi and myrm both will feed to roams more, but they are cheap. It's a much better trade off than just afk isk / hr imo.
---
&gt;to mine away and get space rich
---
Lmao. Join wormholes and make close to a bil an hour
---
I don’t think all the krabs are gonna quit. Plenty of them operate under super umbrellas already, and for those guys, nothing will change.
---
You can port the 100mn VNI fit over to a Stratios pretty easily and it works.
---
Oh yes the good old helpless crabber defense. Might i suggest... adapting?
---
Does the Queen know of your treason on the wall? Lol
---
i sure am
---
Which would be?
---
Absolutely.
---
Suitonia you can't just go and steal my argument about "adapt or die" being their refrain for years like this!
---
Not even close to J space though. C5 krab holes are almost as retarded plexing
---
that was suitonia not jintaan
---
the whole temporary no local thing isn't that bad.  my problem is that CCP doesn't seem to understand the problem.  We are losing players left and right.  Eve is very much underpopulated.  These changes, like no local, are going to lead to less prey, more clumping up, and fewer conflicts.  I don't understand how that could possibly be a good thing?
---
&gt;This also adds more isk to the global eve economy.
---
????????
---
are you dumb
---
&gt;Sure ... this one account will compensate all off #us ~~those ratters~~ that will rage quit over those changes.
---
LMAO, nice failed edit. 
---
You became such a joke it's almost sad.
---
Theres nothing saying this will happen.
---
There is a mention that interbus have reviewed their border  transport service in a news article.
---
Well i don't disagree with you that pilots logging in during a cta is important. EvE is a game and mandatory ctas get unfun really fast. IDK about you but i like to have fun when i play video games.
---
If a gang of 15 cruisers drops on a Rorq, we’ve just identified 15 idiots. Now, a 150-man Bomber’s Bar fleet or an INIT Stuka op, that’s a different story.
---
https://i.imgur.com/wmeOGaX.png
---
gotcha
---
whatever loser, believe whatever lies you want
---
It's not worth the cost for T2 or faction ships to insure. It's been like that for as long as I can remember.
---
Right but that is also true with the current local mechanics so again not much of a change to an alliance line member. There are multiple stages to security. Deter, detect, deny, delay, defend.
---
Ishtar and Gila will be used by people ratting on the side while doing something else on the computer, maybe Domi aswell.
---
Myrms will be shitty disposable ships with low ticks, but cheap.
---
Roamers generally don't care about the PVE ship, just tackling ratters is the best way to get your friends to respond. 
---
Sadly CCP removed the other ways we had to get a response, like camping stations/gates and entosising outpost services, when they introduced citadels and fatigueless jump bridges that are anchored on citadels.
---
I can imagine it, a load of keen newly resubbed bittervet PvP players jump into a Goon system in Delve and got boson'ed.   And then find most of nullsec pretty dead.    I wonder how long they will last?
---
I understand why this local thing was done, but it is not going to solve many of the issues no matter how much people might want it to.
---
I wouldn't agree with High-sec having end-game content, since Concord protection automatically makes the region mechanically much less risky. Making yourself not profitable to gank is comically easy.
---
No please don't tell her I don't want to go to the Tower of London
---
I make a cool bil/hour doing lvl 5. You can make more multiboxing fw missions or burners. C5s may be slightly more but they're limited by the number of available sites. So yeah you may be right... but the guy who said lowsec is a downgrade from null is definitely, woefully incorrect.
---
You say that but last time local chat broke I took the opportunity to fly deep into ns and sneak out with something super valuable. Was a lot of fun and I made good isk. There are all kinds of opportunities for fun in this game if you quit whining and go look.
---
No, more like roaming PvPers running from roaming PvPers, just like it is today. PvPers only want to dunk ratters, that is fully evidenced by looking at what is already happening in null.
---
It is the spodrage. It is one of the infecting viruses that eventually leads to blue-donutitis, a very common form of brain degradation among eve players.  
---
The main virus transmitter are crabs, so i recommend getting vaccinated before engaging with them.
---
There may be a plan, you have no idea either way. Quit your bitching and play the TEMPORARY changes or don't. No one cares about your opinion. You added nothing to the conversation.
---
Yep, and not just to players. Dodged a dread spawn last night in an Ishtar. GFL doing that in a Myrm or Domi.
---
uhm, no? im basing this off observations from here and especially the eve forums. 90% of those in support of the drifter shit are hisec dwelling players
---
I include marketing and industry as possible sources of end-game content. 
---
While I can't build supers in high-sec, I could plausibly still be an industrial giant while in high-sec.
---
Is it just the 4 interceptors and t3 cruisers that can be nullified?
---
You know how squishy a bomber is?  And a recon can take down some stuff solo, but it's sub-optimal for the solo hunter.  Again, you have only a rudimentary understanding of how a hunter works.  It's probably best if you sit this discussion out from now on.
---
Depending on the space. They’re suboptimal against Sanshas.
---
Okay, but at this point it is not about ccp making perfect choices. It is about them gaining confidence to make choices at all. I'm not so attached to no local in null that i expect it to be the single one thing that heals the game.  
---
I perfectly understand that alot of things need to happen.
---
But it represents a step in the right direction for the devs at ccp. And i can only applaud that.
---
Someone always says this but I've never seen it effected. The fact is most people can't or won't mission in lowsec because it's too scary. There are always neuts in local in lowsec. A few years ago when Doomchinchilla dropped a lvl 5 mission guide everyone screamed bloody murder but all it caused was more carrier ganks. So /me shrugs
---
What kind of rewards can one expect?
---
And since they're 8ntroducing wh mechanics to null, maybe no clone services as well?
---
BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD!  SKULLS FOR HIS SKULL THRONE!! KHORNE FOR HIS KHORNE FLAKES!!!
---
What was the fate of the Chinese server.
---
tl;dr pls implement fuzzy search
---
I am not a goon = ) u know me tho in the bakery
---
Apparently they are highsec players that interact with null in some shape or form, considering that they actually care about the changes.  
---
A guy from marmite will hardly give a fuck if null has local or not.
---
And how do you presume where players live in this subreddit considering how popular flairbaiting is/ most small groups not having flairs because they are too small? That is some third eye shit you are pulling here.
---
You are thinking in an environment without covert cynos, or a pilot coming out of a wormhole do solo things. There are more organized groups who live in NPC null that do use blops and covert cynos.
---
Kind of but...like not really?
---
No cynos in wspace, when your nyx/niddy/rorq gets jumped you are turbofucked
---
HA!
---
it is a step, but a step in the wrong direction.  i have yet to see some sort of theory on how this will increase subs or the population?  sure it can be reversed, but then you will have pissed off all of your customers in one way or another and gained jack shit for your efforts.
---
How erect are you?
---
Even burst ?
---
Stagnation.  That's why CCP did it.
---
Guilty as charged.
---
Perhaps those PVE ships should have some kind of protection, like a standing fleet or something.
---
Remember the good old days when all you had to do to become filthy rich was own a bunch of moons and helicopter dick around all of eve with a giant cap fleet. Pepperidge farms remembers. Also most of the mods are NC/PL affiliated so its kinda unsurprising they are of the opinion "lul krabs get fucked"
---
Great reply, thank you! Sounds pretty awesome.
---
Curse would be best. Local will be gone brah.
---
Have you heard of pressing the v key my guy
---
only took them 15 years; but yes. I really hope this is building up to be a giant Players v Drifters mega battle where there's 10k eve players battling 10k drifters.
---
Don't need to be set on your overview, just on the overview setting you have dscan using.
---
That's 300m for the tinker ratlers total or per character?
---
StainGuy is a nameless goon line member/f1 monkey, so this type of post is just up his ally.
---
Is the abyssal space guide reliable? If you take a look at gila electrical. you have a starter fit for t5 for less than a bil, but there are several possible upgrades listed. Most of these improve your tank, but if the starter build is good and stable (according to the first page), then whats the point of all the upgrades? So can you really reliably farm T5 sites with this fit?
---
Go for the whirlwind attack. It's amazing
---
No, think about the all the pain the krabs are gonna feel you heartless bastard.
---
"Anti-subcap" is not a valid role for any ship to have when 90% of the ships in the game are subcaps. Forget the lore, surely you can understand this from a game design perspective.
---
You have to be delusional to think that this changes anything in regards to nullsec sov stagnation.
---
If it’s permanent, I’ll renew my subscription in a heartbeat.
---
Leopard is awesome.
---
For all the guys on eve-o crying that they will unsub the 17 accounts that they share with their wives i also see people saying their interest for the game is picking up again. 
---
And as i stated above, to be progressive you have to take risks and risks can entail taking a step in the wrong direction. Incidentally whenever ccp fucked up bigtime, they also noticeably improved afterwards.  
---
So even if blackout turns out to be more shit than let's say incarna, then ccp should have learned something and they can go on to the next thing.
---
In game development these days long dev cycles in the way that eve is experiencing are poison to the longevity of the game.  
---
F2P &amp; mobile games have set a standard of instant gratification that eve by design fails to meet. So timed events might be a way to keep the playerbase more engaged.  
---
But this will only happen if the playerbase starts embracing change instead of inherently being opposed to it.
---
😈😈😈😈
---
I'm still waiting for them to iterate on clones after removal of clones upgrades.
---
Observatories - I really like this idea. Maybe even few types like Medium (+- fortizar price) - local in system, Large (+- keepstar price) - local in constelation, XL - local in region. High prices are needed due to power which these structures give (especially XL and large). XL would have to be very, very, very expensive. (10x keepstar price or maybe more). Also limitation is needed like one observatory per system.  
---
Arks - good idea, but again, it have to be very expensive to build (keepstar price or more). These ships would give really big advantage. There should be few within the game.
---
First time in awhile I've wished for time to play Eve.
---
Oh well.  At least there should be some good content on here to live vicariously through.
---
He's just angry the drifters aren't attacking via a previously unknown lowsec gate to Stain.
---
A nyx
---
Is there any way I can place buy and sell orders and courier contracts via mobile? Like an app or something?
---
Suitonia - titans should be able to be killed by a solo t1 frigate because balance
---
It makes their life harder, so they hate it.
---
Oh well.
---
&gt; We do not need more rorqals, we need more players actively interacting with other players ( aka pvpers).
---
sure, but you do realize that "no local" is a buff to rorquals?  rorquals really don't give that much of a fuck about local right now.  might lose an excavator here and there, but since you are stuck in place anyway, you can't do shit if a neut enters local. 
---
plus rorqs are ideal for dealing with campers.  panic gives you plenty of time to deal with whatever comes though the cyno. 
---
with "no local" you would be an idiot to mine in anything other than a rorq.
---
Better than my corp mate:
---
"SHIT!"
---
"What's up?"
---
--- 30s of silence
---
"Hello? What's happening"
---
"Oh, fuck me"
---
"Who what where dude?"
---
"I'm dead"
---
Why would you pick a Stratios over a Gila?
---
My only comment as a new player and player retention. Ive come to imagine EVE as  giant board game where every piece cost money. A chitty t1 frig ends up being worth 5 to 10 cents?
---
Playing around with my penny ships are fun, but then I dig a little deeper and realize the 'real' players have empires worth thousands.
---
Analogy. At the mall playing with the 'penny racer ' where your penny races another penny down the hole. Cheap quick fun...you look over your shoulder into the 'hobby lobby' and see 20 neckbeards playing some massive tabletop game where they each have invested tons of money.
---
It looks fun, and you do want to play. But the barrier for entry is huge and their campaign is a decade on going which perks given to all their characters.
---
Yep, have observatories only give incomplete info, so that there is a human element of combining the puzzle to understand what is going on in your system.
---
It is actually one of the more fun parts of living in a wormhole.
---
Didn't say I would, just saying it's doable.
---
This is solution to bot problem. No local for warp offs, drifters to come clean up afkers. Easy money
---
THIS\^
---
I like how everyone applying actual logic to this player base issue is being downvoted in favor of yeeting spurgelords reeeing "you won't be missed"... it's like they are so retarded they don't realize what's actually happening to their futures. 
---
EvE players are both smart and monumentally stupid at the same time
---
😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂
---
Because destroying that structure can become a tactical choice for attackers
---
I would hate to see the impact of autoscan on the servers in a large fight. The servers having to add in the calculations of all positions of every ship at regular intervals, no thanks.
---
I just TL;DR'd it for ya. You enjoy winning eve
---
I don't think there's risk averse v non-risk averse.  For example, I'm non-risk averse when it comes to PvP.  But if I set out to earn with PvE, I'm very risk averse.  Why?  Losing one ship, an Ishtar say, means the last two hours of grind I've just done is completely wiped out.  Life is short.  Too short for that.  I'd rather do something else.
---
But what's over 9000?
---
I know Curse went up to 500m but quickly dropped back to normal
---
And Rook spiked up to 500m as well but didn't drop like Curse
---
Just saw this. Holy shit. This may actually make me reinstall.
---
The tears on the eve forum thread are priceless. Tons of people who have gotten way too used to their absolute security blanket in null.
---
Sounds like you quite before you tried the actual game part of the game.
---
If they bring out a structure that restores local it will become THE default structure to build in every system and put us right back into stagnation. The only thing the game should accept to take on ‘no local’ is a player gathering the intel on the field and relaying it to others.
---

always take the bait

&gt;i really hope i get to pve
---
eve-o 2k19
---
At one point I had a news article prepped in case I lost my Rorqual decrying the humanity of the loss, with an op ed on what idiot put an idiot in charge of a ship that size.
---
Never lost ot despite doing boneheadedly retarded stuff with it.  Like, jumping it to a kickout station on jump 1 after purchasing it because I had no jump skills and could only go like 1 LY.  Dropping corp so I could move the character to another account for a move op, then saying f it, undocking it WHILE NEUTRAL from staging and jumping it on to a station so closely it bounced.  Decloaking in a random system so I could refit my carrier off it and store some heavier mods, because I forgot to fit a cloak to my carrier.  Oh, and I YOLO'd it through a star system with cap hunters and no station.
---
This doesn't go in to its career as a starbase logistics ship, or the many freight runs it did.  Somehow it's still collecting dust as one of the older Rorquals (it's fit with 3x large cargo rigs, for an idea of how old it is).  I thought about refitting it to something more appropriate, but worried about people not knowing how old it was when it went boom.
---
&gt;I make a cool bil/hour doing lvl 5
---
That's level 5 burners right? That takes how long to set up?
---
World Arks would be a massive target. Your nomads would be more on the scale of like Snuff or BL to be able to defend it. But I'm not against the idea, just we are past those days where it wouldn't be a huge target. 
---
Personally I'd rather see a small FLEX Anchorage that I can stash somewhere as a FOB. That'd be much more useful on the smaller end of the scale.
---
Good talk. Exactly the level of discourse i expected from the average PL Edgelorde. Not to say that everyone in PL is like this guy, just a non trivial portion.
---
Those are the main ones, yeah. There are a few special edition ships with that feature, namely the Victorieux Luxury Yacht, and certain AT ships.
---
&gt;Yes, as soon as people do anything other than anomaly ratting in a vni/carrier they might actually have to expose themselves to danger while making isk.
---
Exposure is irrelevant as getting caught is a death sentence.
---
The big difference is that there isnt as much isk to be made in ls.
---
There’s a cruiser called the victorieux luxury yacht that is covops, nullified and can get instawarp there are also all of the alliance tournament interceptors, but they’re several hundred bil each.
---
If thats the goal, they should nerf or reduce the anoms.
---
Can confirm - and you can do it in a PvP fit Strat without too much difficulty.
---
Not optimized for PvE, but I did it for shiggles a while back.  https://youtu.be/8a5y32wtmXw
---
I thought Mordus are in those lowsec only anomalies.
---
I mean, the Tower is a pretty nice tourist destination.
---
You can find the info ingame anyways so a third party tool that lays it out better is just more convenient.
---
There's no point in engaging in 'discourse' with someone as stupid as you. About half the subreddit mods are in goons or test, so your premise of bias is laughable at best. 
---
You're clearly one of those people still upset about HERO coalition, who's not interested in facts or logic, just spewing toxicity on the subreddit. 
---
Welcome to my block list. Goodbye.
---
rainbow glitter barf
---
So what is the trade-off for local? In wormholes you got no cynos, random system location, no jump gates, limited ship type gating in/out in trade for a "delayed local".
---
So in null you guys are having what turned off to compensate for the lack of in-system intel? In game with the agency I can see how many and what anomalies exist in your system, out of game I can use dotlan to see current activity in each system to know where to find targets (system location is not random). I know where to go and roughly where it is before I get there. I can use a nullified ship to get there. I can make a deep safe and cyno in a fleet who are out of d-scan range.
---
What is the compensatory mechanic?
---
Keep in mind, that there is a lot of space, where rarely someone comes in ... since the whole map won't change in terms of entrances and such, there will be still alot of systems, that will remain unvisited also when the blackout comes ... so there will be alot of people mining and will say afterwards "i was totally afk, nobody came here and attacked me". :)
---
But ofc chances are, that it might change to a degree.
---
Another moronic shit post
---
Wow, that proves nothing lol. And you are right. I can believe whatever lies I want. But that also means I can not believe them as well, and I choose to not believe yours.
---
Regular lvl 5s. 3 carriers, 3 tornados, 2 dramiels, and 7.0 faction standing on two characters. Takes a lot of work to get setup. All in all it cost me about 10-12 bill including ships and dog tags for standing. You can do them on one toon now with glamourex boosters.
---
most of it is general misunderstanding/grr goons/grr null
---
Thanks. Very fun times ahead! I think the mk I'll blackout will be good for Eve and it's current state.
---
This man clearly has the intellectual response.
---
dotlan and the number of kills will give you away.
---
&gt;The 'if' being the key part of your statement. There's no certainty that outcome will -- or will not -- happen.
---
The assumption is that it will happen. Thats why people are so happy and there is realistically nothing else that will be "gained".
---
&gt;It's about as vacuous as saying 'If a better game comes out, people will simply not log in.'
---
It is not. This is a specific change. The result can to some extent be predicted. A "better" game is subjective.
---
Looking for a passive regen Gila fit for DED sites - preferably something I can change around to run in different areas.
---
then what will people hunt, and where will null minerals come from?
---
Well, if they did that without a cyno, I would be surprised, but then the question is, if it was so dangerous, why werent they caught?
---
&gt;"Anti-subcap" is not a valid role for any ship to have when 90% of the ships in the game are subcaps.
---
I mean we have titans which are pretty much "anti everything". 
---
But when we're discussing capitals as a whole, surely you'd agree that some should be more optimised towards fighting smaller ships than ones their own size, while others should be much better Vs structures and other capitals?
---
Whether you describe it as anti-subcap or not, out of Titans, Dreadnoughts, supercarriers and carriers, I believe carriers should be the most effective Vs anything smaller than a carrier. 
---
I don't think a carrier should have to call for backup if it encounters a couple of roaming frigs, for example. That'd be ridiculous. It absolutely should have no problem blapping them away. Maybe mess with tracking, so it has to use grams instead of regular lights to actually hit the frigs, but it absolutely should definitely be able to wipe them out.
---
that's simply retarded
---
You can stay in a mega alliance and still socialize with everyone in your corp.
---
ODN welcomes you if you speak french and don't want to leave GSF.
---
But what is your ultimate fix for everything? 42?
---
One the one hand, pvpers want pvp everywhere, miners and ratters want best shut down systems so they can go picknicking with family, come home and the rorq out is still mining.
---
Nullsec wants to be super safe but also super dangerous. People want the option to lose everything, but at the same time, 100% asset safety no matter where you live.
---
Game should be super hard and super easy for everyone.
---
Maybe you need to cut the eve map in half and on the eastern side you have no local, no assett safety on the western side you have local and everything is safe and you can shut down gates. As a result all pvpers will meet pvpers on the eastern side, as they cannot enter the safeish miner heaven on the west. Hurray everyone happy, no rorq will ever die again, every pvper will get kills every day.
---
&gt; And you are saying people will just drop their supers on anything willy nilly? Especially when they have no idea what is lurking just out of sight? 
---
yes. pretty much.
---
I think a meltdown by mittani and him and aryth pushing for an embargo of hisec and burning of everything to make their lives hell deserves more than the qualifier 'grumbling'.
---
Bitching maybe ?
---
Lmao what are you smoking? You can ask literally any corp that does small gang, and they will all tell you killing a ratting vni/domi/gila/etc is mega boring. Every single one of us much rather fight another gang where you actually need to display some skill other than q clicking and f1ing some random ratter.
---
over 9000 was to mimic Vegeta... well msot of the stuff that i checked has actualy spiked the price some mroe then others....
---
I totally agree with you there. Although  rorqs are already invincible under a supercap umbrella so i don't see how removing local is gonna change all that much. Yes mining is gonna be stupid in anything but rorqs, but it has been anyways for the last 2 years.  
---
Also barge mining is still viable, barges mining without rorqs are super rare in null bloc sov, so they are still protected by panic in the common situations i encounter.  
---
If anything no local improves chances of sniping excavators/barges because hunters get a better element of surprise.
---
I'm not trying to make a point about the details of the implementation of the change though.
---
I'm trying to make the point that embracing risk not only affects what happens directly on the server, it also helps embrace change/evaluating said change for it's merits.  
---
It is the only way for us to move forward, and to make the game more enjoyable for all playergroups.
---
"Mods have been removing them from this subreddit because we don't need to see the same tear-filled post over and over and over."  
---
"There's no point in engaging in 'discourse' with someone as stupid as you."
---
 
---
yup i'm the toxic one. ;)
---
You blocked me? and nothing of value was lost.
---
&gt;And that would be different than the current situation how...?
---
Technically, the difference is that they could rely on local to be safe. In reality, probably not much, but that indicates removal of local doesnt fix much.
---
&gt;maybe those people look outside of the big null blocs.
---
Isnt the reason they are forced to be part of them or they get killed?
---
&gt;Or maybe they quit. I literally do not care. It's better than what we have now.
---
If you are willing to let the game die, of course.
---
and you think this will change anything?
---
Boil the krabs
---
New? Those already exist.
---
Wait... so items on the market that will be used more are going up in price? How is that possible?
---
For sure I pick fights alot everywhere, you get bobbed no matter where you go.
---
Yes, so either the hunting will be "ineffective" or krabs will be gone.
---
This is very very good.
---
thats were l plan to retire to when l win eve lol
---
Ziggy Freud just called and asked for you bro :D
---
you ralize that most blocs have very organized logistics people that could implement a system to compensate within a couple weeks
---
No I am saying it will push more people under umbrellas and changing into safer ships.
---
Weekend manipulation is standard.
---
Different week, different item.
---
Ya what do those do to a super carrier?
---
Sounds like crying, you behind in your vni quota for this month to be able to call yourself elite?.
---
&gt; Yeah, it's not fair and you're probably Null NPC #3743
---
Null NIC #3743 you mean?
---
Null Not *Important* Character
---
id say pilgrim or curse. they have drone bonus and you can keep mid/highs for their bonused ewar + armor tank it
---
That’s preferable to them just docking up.
---
Intel channels and d-scan should be all you need to be reasonably safe.
---
This man wins ^^
---
1 week fuel? tbh, it would only be put in active systems... like all of delve.
---
Then why not add jump gates to wormholes so we can continue the homegenization? They are different and don't need to share mechanics.
---
they use that little?
---
Grr gon hat gon
---
Bro centered corps?
---
They’re temporarily sharing one mechanic. Stop being dramatic.
---
Sorry kiddo, you’re going to use the moisture from your own shitpost to jack yourself off today, goons love a reason to setup defensive gatecamps and have npc delve content again. Content comes to them.
---
Listen you, he knows what he's talking about. How dare you question him. You probably don't even roam. Poser.
---
The isk you get out of lowsec is about the same, i just takes actual effort to farm, and it is not as riskless as anomaly farming.  
---
Which is what i was refering to in my comment above.
---
&gt;The big difference is that there isnt as much isk to be made in ls.
---
That is not addressing the point i'm making about the composition of players in your average lowsec vs nullsec system.
---
Losing PvP content in null and deciding to replace it by raiding HS as a way to generate content and voice frustration with the Drifter event is a "meltdown" and "bitching"? Sounds more like level-headed leadership. Spin it how you want though, grr goons and all that.
---
You understand that the safety I enjoy in high sec is NPC and game mechanically enforced? The safety in null is one players create for themselves. I'm 100% sure I am much safer when I go to mine in a .6 system then if I went to do so in a 0.0 system.
---
I seriously doubt the credulity of the claims that they will walk away. But we're the players who seek to keep the current status quo to permanently leave, then eve would not be worse for it. Nullsec is stagnant, it's monopoly is boring and the players who bask in its safety whilst not contributing to it's security leave me asking ' who are the real eve players?' the botnet supported mega alliances of nullsec? The space renters who do not contribute to content? The guys who have stagnated the economy, strangling new players out only unless they tow the line? 
---
Fuck em, players like the above have killed the game for newbros.
---
On all eve meets, i never had someone going to a dev at any situation saying the game is shit and after the meetup they unsub. ... Tbh it would be hilarious and sad at the same time if someone actually pays for an eve meet and really does that in front of everyone ... i think the laughing of everyone would push him out of the building anyway :D
---
Not sure why even NC is mentioned there.
---
BR shows 2 PL and 4 NC members present. Rest is all Horde.
---
This is the first somewhat reasonable objection. But tbh I don't think the extra overhead would be that much compared to all the other data already sent to each client. But fair enough, it is an extra strain on bandwidth.
---
Ugh. The Bowery? Gross. Let me know when it's at some place more my stature like le meridien.
---
Maybe if CCP communicated with their player base we would know that. Instead of we have hilmar hating in his primary marketing force.
---
nullsec and the sov stagnation / citadels have nothing to do with local being on or off.
---
the triglavian and drifter patch looks more like smoke and mirrors to get our attention away from something else ccp dont want us to focus on
---
Sell to existing buy-orders. The Isk/LP ratio is a bit smaller but if you need ISK now then its better than waiting around.
---
&gt;believing ccp won't call this a success and make this permanent.
---
Then it’s cool. It’s one mechanic. It’ll be alright.
---
Wow, and that only took 16 years, too.
---
Funny enough, he's on vacation now. Means he not only enjoys his free time, but also in case he thinks about eve whilst laying on a beach in the sun with a drink in his hand he might be like "oh how beautiful this will be once i am back" :)
---
That what i call a stress free vacation ... :)
---
So grr goons/grr null = highsec player.   Mmh, i didn't know that the wormhole i roam out of counts as highsec now.
---
Have you considered that blueing up your half of the galaxy pretty much turns it into a highsec labelled as null :thonking:
---
Uh out of curiosity what group are you a part of?
---
Supers and rorqs will still be safe, I thought people hated proliferation of these things but here we have ccp encouraging them. Same as the drifters, the only ships that cools stand up to them are capitals.
---
&gt;That is not addressing the point i'm making about the composition of players in your average lowsec vs nullsec system.
---
Not sure what difference that makes.
---
Dude read the fucking stats instead of spouting off shit constantly like a typical PIA redditor
---
Everyone puts their top picks.  Goons are a coalition.  They have reps from multiple alliances in their coaliton and then they coordinate with other null sec grps to have a vote list.  You see alot of null sec ppl on CSM because that who turns out to vote.
---
v0v we change locations every time
---
People leaving a pvp game because they have to engage in pvp sometimes - somehow is the reason the game is going to die. 
---
Ccp should just release a PVE server with pvp turned off so y'all can farm your space rocks in peace.
---
As funny as it sounds ... recons were always decent. Running 5/10 in low if you don't want all those hungry killers seeing you? Rook :P
---
So curse with full drone dps fit and buffer shield ... could in fact work.
---
Besides Remote Desktop so you’re essentially playing the game on your computer, no.
---
Nah my VNI quota is filled for this month, considering that i am posting here instead of actually roaming.
---
Why would any company go to their user base and say "our product is getting boring so here's the things we were going to surprise you with but fuck it we'll tell you know"
---
Companies don't do that, kid.  Especially with this community that bitches at literally any change. I for one am glad the REEing is confined to when the changes are made rather than having to listen to people bitch months before the change.
---
What stats? What the fuck are you even talking about? Is there some mystical database of numbers floating about that I’m missing? You’re preaching bullshit about the death of solo to a guy who literally plays solo. It’ll be fine. Adapt. Also, there’s much better ways for a solo player to make isk than ratting.
---
I edited it multiple times. Typed this on phone while riding a train.        
---
Accidentality gave 2 golds also today.
---
Remember when brave had a victim complex? O wait i dont have to
---
Legit tho: ever Krab who complains should have ALL their accounts perm banned.
---
Why?  What does it stop that is good gameplay?
---
He probably buys PLEX from CCP but at the same time from another site where he is not supposed to. So kinda mix up i assume. I guess the CCP PLEX buying is more a cover up then and the other site would be cheap as fuck so his average is super low.
---
Hahahahaha wow to be this fucking delusional...
---
CCP stated that's why it is not on auto-scan. I can't wait for the people that try to macro it and get banned for automating
---
Shame. Thanks anyway :)
---
its so unfair you just kill stuff while running away in your coward kiters and as soon as we get 70 dudes in harpys to fight you you just warp off  :(
---
Because you are quoting my comment making it seem as if you responded to something specifically. Instead you brought up a non-sequitur.
---
He s less retarsed than op
---
I agree. I wrote an interesting piece years ago before I quit. It was the first thing I ever posted. You should check it out.
---
You’ve never seen a super die to 100mn Lokis before?
---
+1 to burner and FW LP - this is probably some of the most profitable  and most sustainable isk making in the game.  Even better, you can do it with relatively little SP.
---
oh cool, that's interesting.
---
*Oh shit our narrative is biting us in the ass. Quickly post "grr gon hat gon" to assert control of the narrative again.*
---
Where does this "It's only going to happen for a few weeks" thing come from? Did I miss something in the announcement? Or is this another one of those CSM leaks that never happen?
---
If opt-in local was normal for all non-starter systems, it would probably reinvigorate wars under the new system, and even that old dinosaur, factional warfare.
---
TL;DR we found out we were important enough to be streamed on twitch today, so we did the logical thing and found the camera! 
---
^(Also, Provi, learn where the "Disable camera bobbing" setting is on your graphics please!)
---
It doesn’t inherently, just the bots almost always use them.
---
Streaming and beeing like "they do me a favor if they ban me" at the same time. He could stop by himself if he really hates the game so much.
---
He's not popular for the joy he shows for the game. From what i've seen on reddit ppl are more rooting that he dies in a super.
---
Take Bjorn Bee ... he's more the face of eve by showing how much he enjoys playing and streaming, solo and in fleet. If that evan dude would really be the face for eve, then no wonders 99% of new players don't log in within the first 3 weeks anymore.
---
Since when is 70 harpies + logi a fight vs 3-5 cruiser and down
---
Great argument coming out here, guess i have to concede. Your wealth of experience vastly overshadows mine.
---
You exhaust a C3 within an hour or two though.
---
Then you either log off for a few days or have to spend time finding another C3.
---
you say i dont understand while replying to a thread asking me if i realize my "pvp ships come from pve"
---
you are literally replying in a thread discussing how carebear crybabies are saying the sky is falling claiming they are going to dock up, and that will show the world! who will build your ships!??
---
you are replying in a thread where people claiming the economy will tank while im saying " i like this change even if it negatively effects the economy" 
---
where have i implied nullsec miners dont work together? im praying they do im praying they grow some balls, call up their friends, pay them to run security for pve ops because i sure as shit know theres one thing you dont underand
---
thats supply and demand
---
as long as this game exists someone will be wanting to earn isk. 
---
if all the little carebears take their pve toys and go home, eventually someone will take their place because there will be isk to be made
---
Fixing the game means different things to different people.  If you wanted to define "fixing the game" as resolving every problem of every demographic, it becomes an insurmountable task on two fronts.  First, there are a massive number of things people want fixed.  Second, when fixing or balancing something for one group you will inevitably piss off another.  They have to chip away at it.  Maybe I am over simplifying it, but that is how I've been looking at it.
---
I have said this a million times but it should use fighter mechanics for the excavators
---
No, he's kinda right on the money.  Yeah, there are a lot of "pvpers" out there that froth at the mouth at the idea of dropping 4 blops on a lone ratting VNI.  This isn't what most people describe "small gang" as though.  Small gang is usually roaming FW or null space with some meme ships (sometimes built loosely into a nano comp, sometimes not) looking for a challenging fight.
---
Perhaps you should spend more time familiarizing yourself with the game and less time extending your "haha".
---
&gt; CCP's next bright idea is to add local to wormholes.
---
Watch that be a counter-attack on the part of the Triglavians.  Everyone in the dark *except* J-space.
---
Observatories would just bring back local and nothing would change. We would be back to the same stagnation. I would rather stay the course and let it shake out than cowtow to the same groups that have been killing this game for years
---
You've never seen a FAX?
---
Everyone asked for this for years
---
I'm a simple man, I see a suitonia post and I downvote
---
Why not remove local from everywhere? Why not have drifters attack all regions of space? Why not add any null sec mechanics to wormholes? These are unique areas of space and don't need to share the mechanics.
---
&gt; Isnt the reason they are forced to be part of them or they get killed?
---
Read Suitonia's post. People don't join big blocs in order to be safe through engagement. They join big blocs to be safe by sheer size. They don't get on comms, they don't join standing fleet, they just fire up Near2, Netflix, and their 10 accounts and rely on the defense of scale. It's bullshit. Being part of a smaller group means you necessarily have to engage with your friends. You have to actually participate in the game. 
---
Right now the only major risk to most NS PvE activities is loss of income - you dock your rorq or carrier or super up for 15 minutes cause a gang is coming through, or you go play another game for an hour because there's a stuka fleet sitting in a WH. And people get mad about not being able to make isk. The _second_ you inject risk of loss into the equation, people throw a fit. The entire magic of eve is that nothing is sacred, nothing is safe, nothing is permanent. Removing local damages intel networks. Sure, you can have gate intel bots - but they only go so far and you require more of them. So we lose the perfect intel. Players have to engage - or take risk. Many players will leave. Many players will choose to engage with their groups, finally. Many players will just die. And some players will say "fuck the big groups, I'm gonna go live somewhere else - if I have to expend all the effort to keep myself safe, I might as well also reap the rewards of owning space."
---
So yeah, if the game dies - I'll be sad. But as it is the game _I_ enjoy playing is largely already dead. I'm losing nothing.
---
OH lol ... i thought he really made it just for this. Just realizing it's already 9 years old. Damnit there are things that fit in every situation in EVE i guess :D
---
Someone sayid Null is to safe let's nerf it. Null safety last as long people are willig to provide help. So let those people to burn out and everything in null will back on track without removing local. But as long bigger alliances stay organized that long there Will be safety in null. Just let CCP provide new Type of structures with allow to keep local runing, when it's not fueled no local plus emiting some sort enegy affecting on all covert op devices: no cloak, no covert cyno. When destroyed no local, no Energy emision So all covert op devices work as usualy. When refueling this structures 1h cool down So no local all covert op devices worki g as normal. That would give people some Time to rest and a reason to fight to remove this structure.
---
Right now, Eve needs a good brush fire.  Let's get back to turning null into Vietnam.
---
krabs don't feel pain
---
I actually was in my car waiting, when I read this I almost died laughing.thank you, have an updoot😂
---
funny enough from your flair id guess those 5 cruisers will cost more than the 70 harpies :P
---
I mean Hillmar did say he hates nullsec players so there's that. How about discussing changes and seeing how they affect things. How about not explicitly placing 20 spawns in goon space, how about not killing all nullsec activity for a day for fun? No communication on any of this is awful as a company. They don't need to say their player base is leaving but they can explain the rationale behind it. What about the CSM? Do you think they were informed and approved of it? That's what they are there for, to keep ccp from damaging the game and CCP most likely ignored or didn't inform them.
---
So as someone who has followed eve online on and off and dabbled in new eden for about a month a few years ago, can anyone give me a short rundown about how this change is gonna effect the game and why you are all excited?
---
except it's not wormholes... wormholes are singular system that tend to not have interconnecting gates, they have to be scanned down to find the "door". you can't Cyno in super caps from staging in wormholes.  there isn't ihubs in place that should be keeping the "Fluid Router Network" online. hell if drifters wanted to entois or attack Ihubs and that's what caused local to black out I would be far more okay with this stupid change.
---
and to be fair no one in null sec (who lives there) has ever said "I miss when null sec was hard"
---
Il mine my own hulls duh
---
Recon and Black Ops ships should have a module to  screw with it somehow.
---
ALL OF THIS. Complacency breeds weakness. All the null posers are finally showing their true colours.
---
I miss CCP Guard he would have nixxed this local blackout bullshit in the planning phase.
---
Cool let’s make it so that you can’t shoot other players anywhere but wormholes. Let’s make it so that nullsec is the only place you can fly cruisers for some reason. Lowsec is the only place you can use projectile weapons. This shit’s totally arbitrary dude. It’ll be okay.
---
wormholes.
---
Nullbrain can’t conceive the fact that small gangs arent looking to commit suicide to 70 assault frigs
---
&gt;arent the prices related to the market in some way?
---
Nope, material cost only. tech 2 insurances suck because of this.
---
r/eve: *We hope that the Drifters completely destroy you and your play style, burn all your structures, completely reset everything out there.  You're what's killing the game!  I hope a Drifter molests your pet turtle and runs off with your mother, etc. etc.*
---
Mittens: *[Mentions the embargo.]*
---
r/eve: *See, Null is losing it's shit and being hostile!*
---
This is gold
---
Except not by you because you don't like pve. 
---
When is the last time you were involved with the logistics of nullsec markets? I'm getting the sense the answer is never. You want stuff to blow up? Well there's gonna be allot less of it.
---
When was the last time you were involved in any way in mining in nullsec?
---
This wont happen. The primary reason to rat in null is the infinite stream of super easy anoms to do. Since holes dont have that you wont see much movement, if any.
---
no, that's why i said 90%. WH and lowsec fall somewhere in the 10% minority
---
After a month of extensive testing on SISI, we have concluded that nothing changed. Before 0 rats were killed, then after the changes, 0 rats were killed.
---
&gt;BL Flair

&gt;Calling literally any other alliance a "dead alliance"
---
My fucking sides
---
downvote me idc but up until now this game supplied content I enjoyed and engaged with, not just pve but pvp. Before this update I had the choice but now it's been taken from me and that's why myself and others are unhappy. we have been forced into one type of play style. ironically the same thing most of you have been complaining about for the last few years except now you somehow think this is beneficial. I'm not paying for content I dont want or enjoy and you wouldn't either so this is why I'm unsubbing.
---
you realize that 90% of combat capitals, recon ships, blops, hictors, etc, all have cynos as standard fitting?
---
Maybe you're an insufferable tool with no empathy for new players. Starting from 750k SP isn't a challenge. It's just a long tedious wait.
---
They exist, and supers still die to blops fleets. I’m not sure what your point is.
---
Friendly reminder that Dirt'n'Glitter is recruiting.
---
Maybe stop being shit and adapt? Not our fault you're too shit.
---
It isnt better isk though. It is better isk short term, but the anoms respawning in null means if your ratting for hours every day a super will easily out-tick a wormhole ratter.
---
this isn't going to change a goddamn thing about stagnation. if anything, it will make it worse.
---
I am 100% positive that day local get removed Farmville and Minecraft will get boost in users. All this miners have to go somewhere where it's still safe!
---
Weirdly enough the majority of those drop blops on vni types are in nullsec blocs.
---
Not really. The same rorquals and supers you tackle that light the cyno will still light their cyno and you're still gonna get dunked. 
---
The differences will be is the idiots who had a chance to warp out when Intel reported the fleet 10 jumps out now don't get that forewarning nearly as often. So they'll die more often then they already do. As they should because they didn't fit a cyno, they're not in standing and they're not in theta. 
---
You may also see that people will park and cloak their titans on delve gates and wait to boson every roaming fleet as it enters delve. You also may see scouts set up on all paths into delve. Watching gates or perma gatecamps set up in surrounding regions so we see everything coming. 
---
We are the largest coalition in the game. What hurts us hurts everyone else more. :)
---
unironically fof drake
---
Ask Xenuria about ratting myrmidons and if it's safe to rat.
---
There's a copypasta out there.
---
Very introspective, bravo. Besides the obvious war on botting, what effect do we really expect from this change?
---
From my high sec armchair I suspect the reaction will be consolidation and capital use proliferation. Your in a big block, what do you see?
---
Sure they will, if they grind Isk and buy injectors.
---
/r/fittings would be a good place to ask too. I don't have any gila fits saved but it shouldn't be too hard to find
---
And it is totally arbitrary to change something has existed for 15 years.
---
Living in low on the border of null and ratting in null would still be an option, wouldnt it?
---
Your main space would be easier to secure and your pve space would still be close enough to not be super annoying.
---
An anti-Drifter defense mechanism?
---
Change My Mind: Those random days when EVE lost local everywhere due to ''technical difficulties'' was CCP testing this Purge scenario.
---
&gt; I mean Hillmar did say he hates nullsec players so there's that.
---
Woah woah woah. Where/when was that?
---
it's too late to implement scarcity. The damage is done. there are people in jita with many, many max stacks of minerals
---
You sound like a high sec miner from miner bumping
---
Citadels and refineries are bonused for cloning bays and moon drills such that they only need 80% the normal fuel. Both those services cost 5 blocks an hour, discounted to 4 with the role bonus. Assuming 375,000 m^3 in a JF, you can fit 75,000 blocks in a single load at a fuel block's 5 m^3 per unit. At 4 blocks an hour, that's 18,750 hours of continuous high power service, which is 781 days, or 26 months.
---
3 weeks? I so hope CCP makes it permanent.. will only benefit the game..
---
Yeah, except the fact that Delve has lost nothing to Drifters. Or real players.
---
And it’s caused growing issues that, with the shift in the metagame in the past couple years, have been exacerbated.
---
All player owned stations got converted to citadels that can be destroyed or moved.
---
Or maybe ccp employees get off on the salt that any change they announce produces. 
---
Even if shit is unannounced don't you think the point of a video game is to entertain? What is more entertaining than having unannounced big bad drifter bois kick the door down. Just buckle up and enjoy the ride while it lasts.
---
Oh nice I know this one: pretending to be schizophrenic on reddit! Very funny gag sir, enjoy my upvote
---
Some kind of a security update. Mine were deleted, but then somehow returned after a day or 2.
---
&gt; I don't join voice comms ~~*or socialise with my corp*~~ unless I absolutely have to.
---
As a long time standing member of SUAD I believe this is what has allowed me to be around for so long. Lmao.
---
You mean something players have wanted for a decade? xD!!!!
---
More like they can't get local chat working so they threw in the towel and #WorkingAsIntended :P
---
MJFG Dessies will pose a major threat to rorqs even under umbrellas without local, since they can't use a local overlay and recall when neuts spike in.
---
Tank fit supers will probably still be safe, but quite frankly they aren't that great in terms of income. You will however be able to tackle their fighters after they warp to next site with a Stratios or similar and kill like a billion worth of drones if they are not aware.
---
Ratting titans probably won't be impacted but my god if you think the majority of people are going to switch to ratting titans you're so clueless. They have such a high SP/ISK floor and by that point you honestly shouldn't even need much ISK, you've already farmed your nullsec circlejerk ship.
---
We're also yet to see the full effect of the dread buffs earlier this year, so I have decent faith it'll be a significant nerf even to Delve.
---
I think you underestimate the amount of people resubbing for this. I've seen a ton of posts in r/games and r/pcgaming about people returning to eve. IMO it'll easily offset the krabs who are truly quitting.
---
I disagree with the changes being made. It will make my preferred style of play much less enjoyable overall, and I'm much more likely to completely drop EvE for Classic WoW if this is a permanent affliction.
---
This, 100x. I know propaganda and grr goons are part and parcel of the game, but I was hoping to see something more elegant than a hundred different Joe D. Hisecminers parroting the same sad "le salty nullbear xdddd" fantasy ten thousand times.
---
You can use any rigs with no skills, the skill requirement is not really enforced for rigs, unlike modules.
---
Yes entertain, I am sure all of nullsec had fun with being forced to defend against concord level NPCs in every single system. That was sure a great amount of fun. The only people who had fun with the drifter invasions of nullsec have been people not living their enjoying our misery.
---
Local is not the issue and has never been the issue.
---
Safety is only enforced in starter systems, concequences are enforced in other high sec.  You are just as much at risk and without the ability to proactively remove a threat in high sec.
---
Null sec ends up being safer because we can effectively be proactively defensive there due to the lack of Concord enforcement.
---
Yes because as you probably know, brave was the only group affected by PL cap projection. Which is why they changed the game.
---
I have looked up like 15 of the dudes claiming they will unsub... every single one of them was goon/imperium lmfao
---
No shit.All trig fleet my ass. The only thing thing that mattered were the bombers.
---
I was about to fall out of the game but subbed up again when I heard about the drifters and the shake up continues to get more interesting.
---
“We felt as if nullsec needed a shake up, and removing local is one of many tests that will determine the best possible solution”
---
Not exactly hard
---
Risk adversity is the issue, but you can’t fix how people think. You can, however, take away their perfect intel tool.
---
They probably have a bot for that.
---
fuck fuck my reliks
---
come back! bring your old boyz too!
---
Thank you, CCP. Promote the guy who gave green light for local removal and fire whoever wants to force PvE on PvP players with the stupid drifter spawns.
---
This!
---
&gt;He could stop by himself if he really hates the game so much.
---
This is like telling an alcoholic to just stop drinking alcohol if he doesnt like his organs going to shit.
---
This. You have to be risk averse if you're sitting in a hauler picking up your PI stuff, in a freighter carrying your minerals from refining to manufacturing citadel, fueling citadels or whatever else you have to do in a ship that can't shoot back and/or is slow as  a snail.
---
It will not take long until the first comes with "then you have to work together, get protection from your corpmates".
---
Sure, i allways wait with all these backgraund work until someone is available, willing and able to do this. Good luck with that.
---
You know people have to be looking at him weird chilling out by the pool with a tasty beverage and just randomly chuckling or bursting out in laughter.
---
That perfect intel tool worked both ways. Also it was the team work that allowed that intel to flow to other players. People keep acting like hunters don't benefit from local either and its absurd. Local was always a two-sided blade. How many hunters are going to burn out because they flew through 20 systems and had to dscan for 3 minutes to find nothing.
---
Shouldn’t you resub now so they can point to the specific part of the chart where subs rose quickly right after the announcement?
---
Except there is zero reason to bring up past meta in this conversation about moderation actions besides trying to feel sorry for yourself
---
krabbers?u mean bots?better be 5 k online players than 25 k bots
---
Now i am confused, i thought it was a a select number of individuals with gunnery access that was burning out, not all of nullsec.  
---
Also are you insinuating that ccp made you play their game so you can keep your shit in said game? That is  *scandalous*. 
---
Woweeee, it's hard having empathy for people that shit on your enjoyment of the game just so they can build a bigger sandcastle.  
---
What goes around comes around.
---
Goons and tapi circle jerk goon and tapi threads and get mad when the rest of the players do the same LuLw
---
I have the feeling that this has nothing to do with New Eden but rather with the technical problems they want to solve in the easiest mode. They simply remove those servers, replace them in the meantime and invented a story for New Eden. Maybe I am wrong.
---
see its shitters like this that makes me confident I'm making the right choice.
---
Just let player add tags for items, so the playerbase itself can customize it for their needs.
---
Is it me or does it look like he just Sharted and he’s a bit surprised and semi enjoys it
---
You’re acting like the advantages on either side were proportional, which isn’t even close to true. If I’m hunting, the only thing local saves me is time spent d-scanning to determine if there’s somebody to shoot. In many cases, this can be done flying from one side of the system to the other so it’s not terribly inconvenient. On the other end, if I see somebody come into local, I can just dock and be completely safe. For the hunter, it’s a time saver. For everyone else, it’s life and death. 
---
Also, dotlan exists.
---
This is obviously a test to see how much they lose vs. how much they gain and now that they have BP cash backing, they can do it without having to explain a fucked up quarter to suitors.
---
In my estimation, this is a really interesting time, is EVE going to go forward as Minecraft or as the weirdo it used to be.  If it's the former, then you need all the spodbrains and us oldtimers need not apply.  If it is the latter, then EVE isn't a game based on spodbrain subscriptions and their salt is like icing on a cake.
---
Except that I'm talking to a PL guy that thinks krabbing in Rorqs is currently too safe. Which ,when you compare it to holding isk printing moon poses defended by a giant cap force that can project anywhere in eve, is pretty risky.
---
What are you even trying to imply
---
 [Alternatively](https://youtu.be/Hbbf2cPKi-c)
---
Once again, he mentioned nothing about rorqs or moon mining or pl at all. No wonder he got fed up trying to entertain your self pity
---
Good job being a part of the problem that pushes new players out of EvE.
---
Crit your statics, someone rolls in you warp off before someone even enters the WH. If you get caught it's because you're not paying attention. WH is safer than nullsec and makes more money. These nullbears have no idea what they are missing.
---
You implied this event was fun, I said no one in nullsec had any fun with it. People fighting off the drifters had to put in a ton of hours and people trying to hunt/live in nullsec had to deal with randomly dying to unavoidable NPCs. What part of nullsec enjoyed the unavoidable instakilling NPCs? Or was it just anyone not part of nullsec that enjoyed the suffering?
---
So you would support these level of drifters coming to all levels of space then if you think they are a reasonable addition? Should all citadels in HS/LS/WH being attacked and reinforce as well? Should drifters warp into HS/LS missions and instapop mission runners? Please explain how this was fun.
---
Ask your pals for something original to post.
---
This.
---
Flare checks out.
---
About to consult a doctor erect
---
Amen.
---
This is the first change is a very long time that has made EVE less safe. For that I applaud the move.
---
Since I am unable to find what I thought I heard I will admit I am probably projecting onto what he said. I did find something else amusing though, an apology from him for not communicating and needing to improve null 8 years ago. Turns out CCP never learned the communication lesson either.
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/a-letter-to-the-followers-of-eve
---
It’s all natural. Don’t be ashamed.
---
I mean they have. They've been talking for awhile now about stagnation. The methods are a surprise, but the concept is very much not.
---
I suppose, but the major draw for me with T2 BPO was copying the book, which I understand they have locked out some how
---
Does weapon specialization skills damage bonus appliy to faction weapons?   
---
e.g. Small Beam Laser Specialization V adds +10% damage to True Sansha Small Focused Beam Laser?
---
we do constantly... have you not paid any attention?
---
He read it somewhere on reddit so it must be true.
---
I realize your speaking of proactive players vs reactive NPCs but let's take a scenario as an example.
---
 If cloaked,and nullified Loki boy comes calling you can try to smartbomb him at a gate but if I am not watching Intel he could get me as I mine. And he will be able to warp off/cloak long before help arrives or I can close to scram.
---
If he does the same in 0.6 he is going to die regardless of his skill. That will prevent it from happening enough for me to consider it safer.
---
crazy.
---
lol OK, Except it's in a thread that is explicitly about that. But hey, believe whatever narrative fits your worldview it's what you'll do regardless of what i say.
---
It was 2 weeks ago Hilmar floated the idea of removing local and it will be gone in a week. There is no way this was communicated or even discussed. Either it was either already planned and they intentionally didn't discuss it with the players or it was a snap decision made to seem strong and definitely not discussed with players. I can't wait for 5 years when the NDA drops on the most recent CSM meetings and we can see the lines of "holy shit this is stupid" followed by "CCP said they will take it under advisement"
---

This isk faucet needs to go. No more insurance fraud...
---
Doesn't matter, we love rolling into Test, 7 times out of 10 they'll form for a fight and have a good go.
---
The strange thing is there are some things that you have written me in this fit that doesn't sell at the market at this time ;dd
---
No , I'm not thanking them for allowing this shit mess that is nullsec, bots, capital proliferation and other assorted asshattery build up since 2012. Fuck no.
---
Wouldn’t they, though?
---
Good bye. Contract your things to jasmal dona.  I'll take em off your hands! See you in Albion!
---
I'm not saying it's not a need, but rather those with resources will be impacted far less than those who don't. Ex, ratters in Domi/Ishtar/Myrm/Tengu/battleships. Solo subcap ratters in anoms have not much protection and there's no fleet friendly ratting. The barrier of entry to living in null is raised to have at least a carrier or live under an umbrella, which I think is the opposite direction from what it should be.
---
I would have preferred they put incursion style ratting events where caps are not allowed by the acceleration gate and the presence of a fleet makes the encounter between ganker and ratter less one sided.
---
"Now"??
---
Now that local is going to be removed, has CCP listed anywhere whatsoever, that cloaking can finally be countered in some way, either through a vastly expensive structure, a very specific ship entirely meant just to detect cloaked vessels, or what naught.    
---
From what I remember, and I admit it's VASTLY out of date since I stopped playing 3 years ago, cloakers complained that local negated much of their advantage.  With that gone, I really, REALLY hope CCP will finally say 'well now's the time to do this entirely' and help fix the whole 'yep, I'm at the computer 23/7 cloaked in your system, yep, no way am I AFK, here all 161 hours!  Yes sir!'    
---
I don't want to dig up the entire 'cloakers' thing again, that's another discussion for another time, if anyone cares I just want people to actually have to be active if they're cloaking nearby, not login, cloak up, go to work, wait 18 hrs, then drop dreadbomb on ppl that had no way whatsoever to know you were there.    
---
Anyway, too long, my bad old habbits die hard.    
---
If the observatory structure lets ppl decloak afk cloakers, awesome, but I haven't read it anywhere yet.  Just wondering.
---
I dont know where his post is, but he is not an authority on this, so it may not matter.
---
&gt;People don't join big blocs in order to be safe through engagement. They join big blocs to be safe by sheer size.
---
These things are not independent.
---
If you don't have 'Active overview filters' and just switch overview tab to do 99% of d-scanning, you're doing it wrong.
---
&gt; How about discussing changes
---
https://forums.eveonline.com/t/local-comms-blackout-discussion-thread/171935
---
&gt;Because you are quoting my comment making it seem as if you responded to something specifically.
---
Probably because I did.
---
There is no PVP there. They just get caught and die. Then they consider if this is worth it.
---
☑ C4   
---
☑ Wolf Reyet   
---
☑ 75% of kills on coalition fleets and impass/catch.   
---
Do they though?
---
Maybe afk drone ratting is fucked over, but subcap mining should still be perfectly viable as an entry point into null, particularly for `the little guy` who can mine above average ores on an athanor. 
---
DED tengus will also be perfectly fine since they'll be much harder to track down, and besides they were already super duper safe. The possiblity of a lach entering site if he got lucky on a combat probe between dscans is perfectly fine.
---
"it's not a bug, it's a feature"
---
No, it was done "in stages" because CCP is incompetent and couldn't get chat working properly for over a year.
---
"I can't be shit if you're shit"
---
ok
---
We are currently in his fucking post. He is the author of this post. The post you are commenting on. Jesus christ you didn't even read the post you're commenting on?
---
There seems to be something going on with drifters. It would be nice to know if we need to expect some other random change in the future. Are they going to start 1 shotting supers, are they going to break asset safety, are they going to follow up on timers, or will some other random shit happen. People complain about a blue donut in eve but all the wars either stopped or paused because we can't guess what new random thing CCP will throw at us.
---
There's plenty you don't want on your overview but you do want on your dscan???
---
I am not commenting on his post. I am commenting on your post.
---
I'll only be sad because if they leave I might have to find prey that shoots back
---
If CCP wanted to remove the AFK part they would fix drone aggro. Or many of the other things wrong with null PvE. Removing local is just a bandaid fix
---
Dominix, the little space potato that could.
---
Ded sites have low spawn rates, you can't sustain more than 1 person per system per day off of ded sites. The current population of DED site runners is also supplementrd by escalations from anoms, which you can't safely run in subs.
---
Your gut reaction to a temporary change was "reeeeeee ccp im going back to WoW"
---
Yes you count as turbokrab.
---
I was just playing around with some recon simulations for ratting and I got a rook fit that would permanently rep thr incoming DPS of a haven while producing 550 dps. I dont rat so I wouldn't use it, but it is something we might see.
---
"I want to fight, but on my terms only"
---
Fighting you might not always be fun to people you are fighting. Some might find you nuisance that should be disposed as soon as possible. Sometimes with bosons and supers, sometimes with 70 AFs.
---
Domi tbh. Can do low level ratting sites pretty easy
---
I know :) when i wrote that, i was in fact doing that ... 5/10 in low ... was using a rook for it ... works like a charm
---
I think it's pretty clear you've never actually small ganged in your life
---
half the fun is taking engagements that aren't in your favour and turning them around lmfao
---
tbf there's like 4 people who properly stream this game in English
---
I wish I could resub but my budget can't fit EVE.
---
A sharp spike now followed by an 80% of spike dropoff the following month will definitely send a message.
---
yfw the krabs all stop krabbing for the 3 weeks and make it look like the system failed because they all know it's temporary
---
Different thing. Those are Covert Research Facilities, think you gotta scan em down now (used to just be like regular anoms) and theres a bunch of Mordu ships and some loot cans to hack in middle, and you got a timer before the cans explode.
---
But there is also pretty rare (like I've seen less than 10 in my 5 years of eve) Mordu belt rats, it'll only ever be a single rat in an Orthrus or Barghest. They scram &amp; web &amp; are pretty tough tank &amp; dps wise, but have 100% drop rate for BPC of the shiptype they're in. When I started playing me &amp; 1 or 2 of my first Eve buddies would go hunting them in t1 fit algoses. Found a lot more clone soldiers obviously, 10-30mil clone soldier tags were nice and all but 3 noobs in 10mil t1 dessys stumbling upon the occasional 400m barghest bpc (2015 prices lol) felt pretty fuckin great :)
---
&gt;Also find it curious why all the low/WH people reject the possibility of a fleet based PVE activity in null. Makes me think this is all about easy kills rather than actual fights.
---
Citation needed.
---
I don't get why you support murdering babies and eating puppies.
---
I think the change pushes us in a new and possibly good direction. When I started playing Eve, dscan, multiple safes per system, Intel channels, group content and general awareness of surroundings were either required or highly encouraged. Hell, PL even had ratting fits that required 2+ VNIs with shield and cap transfer, because it was safer to rat with a buddy.
---
I think everything will shake up and be spooky for a week or two, then it will be business as usual. Sure, a few extra Krabs will get welped, but they'll learn and HKs will have to get sneakier. The change could prove the meta game. More Blops should be interesting too.
---
allow a clone vat to be put in it, and you got what titant should have been: mobile forward base of operation :D
---
Didn't they re-include that?
---
You can toggle it with shift + C
---
Wow, lot of responses! Still a bit lacking in knowledge on what holes have what statics/etc but I think I understand a bit better. I need to actually see the process (rolling for content) in action sometime. Very interesting.
---
The only ones, who move out if null will be the mouth breathers who like to constantly krab. They don't care or want content unless they have perfect intel from their Delve botting i el program, helping them safely drop their Titan blob on the hunters.
---
With no local, a new way how to d-scan and finding intel all together would be great.
---
&gt;  It will make my preferred style of play much less enjoyable overall
---
When the small-gang pvpers were saying this, everyone kept screeching "adapt or die".
---
Now it's finally your turn to adapt or die.
---
ok first, what the fuck reddit. It's telling me your reply is 5 hours older than the comment you replied too.
---
But on point: Stealth Bombers ARE blops gameplay. Blops = black ops is using hunters to find targets, then blops bridging in a bunch of shit to kill it, typically. This typically involves sb's (stealth bombers)
---
That’s exactly the idea lol - Supercarriers were originally called motherships but had their name changed, and I think there’s room now to introduce true motherships
---
So i just read it. How the fuck does that address anything? Its just bullshit. Hes literally ignoring the actual issues and attempts to defend the removal of local by mentioning other things to do.
---
Are you fucking serious?
---
Bots have intel bots, perfect reaction to new sigs, perfect attention, and perfect dscan and grid reaction.
---
They are hit the least by this.
---
If they have I’ve missed it. I tried a few days ago and it didn’t pull up anything.
---
Been wanting this for EVE since 2008, finally a good change.
---
Stop trying to make sense of this, can't you see we're trying to bot infinite anoms here?? Me and my 32 VNI accounts just want to play a social, risk vs. reward MMO without any social or risk aspects in *my* gameplay... why is this so hard to understand?  
---
Christ my diaper is full again, I hate CCP
---
Ever docked up?
---
Seems reasonable.
---
You clearly have nonudea what the fuck you are talking about.
---
A rorq us 120-140 M/hr, carrier is 150. And a super is, what - 200-250?
---
How is it that this beats C5 krabbing?
---
That is indeed my point as well. If ur citadel isnt just some unfit meme trash then 1 person can come spend 3 minutes gunning it and TADA your entire system just became secure for an unknown number of hours (average seems to be 4h b4 they begin respawning) 
---
So applying this to horde space 160 systems. 3 minutes per system that comes to about 480 minutes or 8h worth of "man hours" per spawn.
---
If we are generous and say they respawn in the same system every 4h thats 6 spawns a day or a yikes factor of 48 "man hours" a day to defend your entire space assuming you have a citadel in every single system.
---
Lets add 25% onto that to account for travel time bringing your total per day up to 60h of "work" to defend your entire alliance. So now lets use tapis math here to assume they got 4000 warm bodies to defend a structure. Well thats .015h per person of "work"
---
Oh but it also pays. Well lets go back and do a little math on that. If the drops are  static and we low ball the value to 10m per spawn thats 150m an hour.. hmmmmmmmm
---
For the uninitiated: http://i.imgur.com/DiW82z6.jpg
---
I've been in whs since 2009. There is a lot of nuance to things.
---
No you sound like a miner bumping "victim"
---
&gt;his game supplied content I enjoyed and engaged with, not just pve but pvp
---
Ok so you cant do what you want whenever/exactly how you want in a sand box game? Sounds to me like what you "enjoyed" was risk averse pve theme parking...since afterall that is what this change most targets. This is a very miner bumpering point. 
---
&gt;Before this update I had the choice but now it's been taken from me
---
You can still rat  without local or with local (depending where you would like to do so). So once again the only thing that has been taken from you is risk free pve.
---
&gt;we have been forced into one type of play style
---
no you havent. You can still rat. Just need to be at your computer and hit V or change how you do it.  
---
&gt;I'm not paying for content I dont want or enjoy and you wouldn't either so this is why I'm unsubbing.
---
You would have quit soon enough when spod stopped getting you high.
---
I prefer the warm embrace of a POS shield.
---
Good point. I’ll do one month.
---
A proper, max ticks ratting carrier will die in a minute or so to 40-50 bombers though. How fast can they react and jump to the cyno with warning?
---
You do know you are talking about CCP, now do you?
---
I did, and sometimes it's fun, sometimes it's not, mostly when no one even undocks. But not my cup of tea overall. 
---
Additional, most of big null entities deem their homes as "no fun zone". If you want fun, I wouldn't choose these regions as roaming destinations.
---
CCP bad
---
mmh ok, i assumed blops was using the black ops bs's  them self but, my point still stands, they need a buff /  sb's a nerf to make them more then just a bus for the real fleet
---
Stagnation and continual BOT abuse I think are the reasons.
---
You don't have any safety net in wormholes, unlike in nullsec.
---
If you leave your static crit it's piss easy to bring in sabres and kikis to kill your dreads.
---
What pvp content in null ?
---
The moment the supercapital fleet of the goons was made clear, that pvp content was lost, end of story.
---
CCP did not build that fleet for goons, they built it themselves.
---
What level-headed action .... that is not level-headed action.
---
It's the overall drain from alliance-wide losses. I imagine multi-boxers / botters would take the biggest hits (and also feel it the least which is fine). Say you have 20 accounts spun up and you can't dock any of your supers/caps? You'll get 'some' to a safe space but it will increase the overall churn of cycle as now your space-coffins can be scanned down and popped while you're at the dentist office getting that crown fixed *again*. I think this would be great as it would create "parking lot" services. New jobs and meta in EvE is always a good thing... And of course: All things must return to the great tritanium cloud in the sky. 
---
This just hastens the glory.
---
Yes and no.  
---
If we think logically about this we will see that due to the sheer complexity of eves design, as soon as you introduce drastic change affecting a specific player-community that playergroup will get smaller.  (Example: collapse of BL. after phoebe as their playstyle vanished from one day to the other).  
---
So by taking a heavy handed approach, ccp will put pressure on certain player communities, and ccp would be wise to assess the risk they are taking that way very carefully.  
---
Now you can offset the negatives by providing alternative playstyles for players getting pushed out of their old ones (but ccp isn't really good at that).  
---
So to make this approach work we have to make sure that our changes have a net positive on long term health of the game and playercount.
---
Now what are the alternatives to drastic change? 
---
We could have minimal changes and preserve the status quo. Which at this point would lead to economic collapse in the near future, further stagnation in the pvp community (which is already not healthy) and even more entrenchment of null-blocs.  
---
That doesn't sound all that appealing, does it now?
---
The other option (the ideal way) would be constant smaller updates (as under Seagull), iterating on existing content (tiericide) and having a good mix of activities for large and small groups. But ccp seems to be unable or unwilling to take this approach.  
---
So to reiterate: we have minimal change, constant change and drastic change.  
---
Because we apparently can't have constant change the only reasonable remaining choice is drastic change.  
---
It is not perfect, there will be loads of reeing (as always) but atleast it has a chance to be successful in vitalizing this game.  
---
The minimal change approach is ruled out because we have had that the last 3 years and it doesn't work, player count steadily decreased ( if that is the metric for success that we wanna take).
---
Now applying the above logic to the Blackout event, i think the good outweighs the bad.  
---
The pve community is far more stable than the pvp community. Everyone needs isk in some shape or form, so farming will never truely stop. It will just change in nature with what is most efficient.  
---
pvp on the other hand is based on fun/hour (sorry boons, i'll quickly borrow that), so if there is no fun pvp, that part of the community is automatically gonna decrease dramatically in size.
---
There is a point to be made about size of the respective communities (i imagine the pve guys outsize the pvp guys by a factor of 5 or something of that magnitude) so in the end only ccp has the hard data to make those decisions.  
---
We might also want to consider that current game balance is heavily slanted towards empire builders/defenders, which would speak for a nerf to their playstyle (even if we don't agree with restricting playstyles on a fundamental level).  
---
And last, with the current devaluation of isk it might even be a positive to trade a negative playercount delta (due to pve'ers leaving) in for a more stable ingame economy. This would give actual value and meaning back to isk and therefor actions in the game.
---
TL,DR: it could be worse if we weigh up the alternatives.
---
&gt; I have quite literally never heard of anyone doing this ever. 
---
Welcome to eve! How're you enjoying your first few days? Insurance frauding isn't very common these days, though it does still happen, but there have been periods in the past where we would build and insurance fraud hundreds, if not thousands of battleships as it was a relatively fast, reliable, easy way to get most of, and sometimes all of the value of the minerals.
---
until it isn't and they can either adapt or quit.
---
Economics is hard. Don't push yourself too much.
---
DELETE THIS
---
ya the primarly wh but do alliance level stuff if needed
---
inb4 deployable that will scan peoples ids as they enter system, deployable in nullsec only, no reinforce timers, must be placed on 0 at a gate.
---
Because most people in eve get SRP for everything, and because SRP magically comes from nowhere, right?
---
Yeah. I misread what you asked haha. My bas
---
Yeah I was about to unsubscribe completely but now I have two accounts subbed and I’m using more MCT than ever at these prices.
---
Burn them. Burn them all.
---
Can confirm. Krab salt is the only thing keeping me alive.
---
Praise be his name
---
I read it. 
---
I'll tell you what others have told me: "The first sentence of each paragraph pretty much conveys your entire point. Assemble a single paragraph from those sentences/thoughts and people will hate you less"
---
"Wait people hate me?"
---
"yes -- but this will lessen it slightly"
---
"oh... ok"
---
Oh and as a response to your response:
---
Yes, I agree. 
---
(TL,DR: I agreed with you)
---
&lt;3 o7
---
Kudos to you for going out and at least trying, and your self awareness is higher than your comrades. I'd highly suggest getting out of that group and playing EVE the way it is meant to be played. Having fun, taking risks, and trying new things. 
---
It is not fun playing EVE and being forced to listen to some spodbrain FC or leader. Then going out and trying something like you did and being mocked for it. Fuck those people my man. Go find a group who values what you do.
---
People like what they like. No amount of pleading and cajoling will get many of your target audience into PvP or make them sociable, it's just not what they like to do. Stellar block of text though.
---
No asset safety, your 'jump gates' appear randomly more often than they do in nullsec, you can't cyno in your friends to help save you. Nullsec is still way safer, not to mention highsec is still by far the safest space in the game if you're not in a hulk or an overfilled transport.
---
CCP is trying to fix the problems CCP created in the first place, why thank them?
---
yep. The ui helps you to see exactly where it scans too, incase there are 2 moons inline with you
---
I like visual things so it helps me atleast
---
A mobile base would be cool. Frankly it's how I assumed titans worked when I was a newb.
---
I never plexed anyway, farming subscription in my real job took way less time.
---
Well, now some other game is gonna get it, this one is only for bots and blocs now.
---
Cyno Inhibs.
---
Yeah it is a good ship to learn on, in that you can make a mistake and still recover, sometimes.
---
You can control the size of the ships that come in, and unless they bring in a ton, you can just dock up in your citadel.
---
Thank you CCP, null bears gonna feel the pain! So excited hunting fits ready to go, destination delve then tour the cluster anti clockwise. 18 players and 25 alts currently planning our expedition.
---
Dod you have three characters, like UM- or S-G?
---
Where are people getting the idea this'll only last for a month?
---
Here you want to dissect something dissect this. GO FUCK YOURSELF.  I've been playing this game 11 years and I've watched this game change in so many ways and I've supported it all up till now. https://zkillboard.com/character/261453958/ betting I've ive killed more shit in the last few months than you have in your entire eve career, get the fuck out here with your spod brain bullshit. And this wasn't my only pvp toon I had 8 more just like him. These are the players you're losing contrary to popular belief.
---
Great, that solves one case.  What about every other case?  It’d be nice to have a modern search function.
---
&gt;RPing as a miner is what got me into the game so as long as l can fly the biggest mining ship lm happy lol
---
The implication here is a rorqual;
---
&gt;Can do that in a WH.
---
Saying you can (fly a mining rorqual) in WH space
---
&gt; Crit your statics, someone rolls in you warp off before someone even enters the WH. 
---
Pray tell, how does one warp a rorqual off while it's still in siege? Or are you genuinely suggesting through the short comment chain, that the person wanting to fly rorquals ought to do so in W-space at only a fraction of their mining potential of the ship?
---
TBH I'll wait until there's a turnaround in the long term PCU trend before I celebrate too much.
---
Risk vs reward or fuck off.
---
It's short term safer and more dangerous in the middle term, since no Asset Safety only comes in if you lose the citadel timer a week later. However, a limit on enemy entry to your hole is very valuable and you will have Capital supremacy unless they seeded your hole.
---
Lol doesnt take 70 harpies just takes showing up with equal or few numbers for most of the small gangs to run away.
---
👌
---
Frankly I'll just migrate to a different game I enjoy. I only recently came back to EvE.. a week before all of this nonsense kicked off. Definitely not the welcoming back I had envisioned. So really my attachments to this game are fleeting and investments shallow. I've been "winning eve" for several years now, and this brief dipping of my toes back in has seen them bitten by an alligator that is CCP's design decisions. So I'll sell off the small fleet I built up in the last couple of weeks, dump my liquid ISK into PLEX then hit up WoW Classic as my MMO timesink of choice when it releases next month and wait to see if EvE decides to unfuck itself. If not, well, I guess I'll just RMT my 2004 main to keep myself off from this game permanently so I don't have any itch to play again in the future.
---
J U S T A D A P T
---
That doesn't really make sense? Winning eve is quitting the game, so unless you're dumping your ships in w-space and 'retiring them there', if you're playing, you're not winning eve.
---
If you have a way of stopping a 20 man kikimora gang from killing your site running fleet, I'd love to hear it.
---
Except when you get invaded and your shit is blown up it vanishes forever.
---
All goon krabs can unsubscribe for what they bring to the game who the fuck cares 
---
Nice post mate
---
it takes a special kind of stupid to ignore how blatantly safe highsec is
---
don't you guys run home sites along with your 50 corpmates?
---
Wormholer here. So while drifters are not reffing our citadels (no asset safety btw.), we've been dealing with them just fine the last 4 years. Not on this scale, or intensity but wormholers know that drifters are nasty.  
---
I wouldn't mind drifters on this scale in all other k-space regions. Let it burn.
---
For me the enjoyment of eve stems from harsh consequence and danger. ccp are checking how they can make space more dangerous in new ways.  
---
Yes it is on the extreme side of the spectrum, but i still think it is fair to assume that a sov holding entity can defend their own space against drifters in their current form.
---
I can see that the event isn't fun for sov-holding entities under consideratuon of the grind that it is. I truely do.  
---
However with the sheer number of players in nullsec alliances this workload should get distributed much more effectively than it is currently.  
---
If ccp were to announce that drifters will stay until all eternity, i would disagree with it. But we know that drifter fleets are a timed event, so you'll have to tough it out for a bit.
---
Upvote for the comrade o7

🦀 All crab move to wormhole 🦀 
---
😁 Very safe in wormhole 😁
---
No, he means krabs. You're seriously mentally deficient if you think 3/4 of the people online in null are bots.
---
I missed the whole Rorqual thing and wrote this post after just waking up, sorry I pissed in your cheerios by trying to offer advice. Calm down there friend.
---
Can't wait for Reddit to collectively shame whbears
---
I was waiting for the \~\~idiots\~\~ goons to come out of the woodwork and start complaining about wormholes.
---
The psychedelic mega? Too bad it gets killed by a frig.
---
Thanks for reading it, heh. 
---
 Due to aformentioned teetering between genius and clinical insanity of this community i sometimes get a bit too neurotic in making my point as clear as possible, apologies!
---
[Just burn them all](https://youtu.be/zDVEHE10nHc?t=200)
---
No people either have their own farmhole or they rat their statics. Either way you don't do that with 50 people. Maybe 5-10  for C5/6s. Anything below that is solo.
---
Many people dont think Eve is at its best when most people are in big alliances under big super umbrellas supported by big rental alliances. Just because you seem to doesn't mean his argument is bullshit. He's providing people who are whining because their playstyle took a hit an alternative to quitting in a huffy fit. 
---
You know, basically what bears didn't do when pvp playstyles were getting destroyed.
---
Spelled Rook wrong.
---
The guy who multiboxes 50 rorqs isn't going to give a flying fuck about the change. It's the little guy who rats in a subcap that is fucked.
---
WH are the safest place to mine in eve
---
Do we really need PR statements for the obvious.  
---
Also they fired most of their community team and then announced a fanfest worldtour stretching that department even thinner. Cut those guys some slack.
---
And now you know the same feeling that a lot of players in smaller pvp alliances felt with nearly every update for the last 3 years.
---
&gt; Hey Krab threatening to unsub
---
Already unsubbed before "threatening".
---
&gt; You screeched Adapt or Die to everyone else
---
Me? Like who?
---
&gt; Here is a bunch of stuff you can do
---
I can't do any of those because I can't log in.
---
&gt; wormhole space 
---
If I had any interest in dealing with eviction shitpies, I'd already be there.
---
&gt; factional warfare
---
This means dealing with boring niche mechanics of eve called pvp more than necessary to secure space. Definitely do not want.
---
&gt; will probably have more fun
---
Fun while doing pvp chores? I don't play games to do chores in them.
---
&gt; and will make actual real friends
---
I answered no to questions above so I probably don't need new friends.
---
&gt; You'll make the game more fun for everyone too
---
No, only for those who like dealing with boring niche mechanics, and that doesn't include the most important person in the world, which is myself.
---
&gt; Having no local is no-where near as bad for smaller corps
---
It's nowhere NEAR is bad because it's FAR MORE bad. Effectively that destroys every small alliance which doesn't have supercap umbrellas because every big alliance gets free content on every roam, and there's a lot of those which are -10 to us, since we blue no blocs.
---
&gt; oh hey there is a myrm on scan and I have no idea if it's friendly
---
And you don't care because you're in a super and cyno is ready in case he's not. Compare that to small alliances with very limited support who have to run from every myrmidon which might be a lightblue neighbour passing by for all you know.
---
&gt; Why not give a wormhole or a LS
---
Wormholes are for chickens. LS simply has nothing to do in it.
---
&gt; independent nullsec corp
---
I am already in one and changes will probably murder it, so not for long before we're forced into a bloc.
---
&gt; Abyssal Deadspace PVE is new and pretty cool
---
I do not approve time-pressured content because life happens and I may have to dock up, and would not risk losing a costly ship to each and every internet hickup, which is why I will never enter abyssal space.
---
&gt; You can run Epic Arcs 
---
I haven't ran it the first time, wouldn't run it the first time, give zero fucks about standings because they are worthless. LP might be nice but burners require too much skill investment in small shit to bother.
---
&gt; Why not give wormhole day tripping a go?
---
Same reason we're not going into them now. Unless you can collapse all entries, it's shit reward at too much risk, and unless you live inside, you can't bring too much in or out either.
---
&gt; How about moving away from cosmic anomalys to cosmic signatures
---
We have 3 in our constellation right now, and there will be 10 people in each of those, complete them in 30 minutes, and it's done, no more unless you venture 15 jumps out in no-local conditions... NOPE.
---
&gt; FW is a lot of fun
---
For people interested in boring niche activity which is eve pvp, means not us.
---
&gt; Triglavian Invasions
---
We brought a decent fleet out for those, got all our loot stolen with no chance to do anything about it, thanks, but no thanks, not trying it ever again.
---
&gt; incursions in highsec which also yield the same ISK/hour as carrier ratting
---
Probably the most realistic option but god SO MUCH EFFORT FOR ISK/HOUR NOT EVEN CLOSE TO CARRIER RATTING (unless you suck at carrier ratting).
---
&gt; join in on the hunt
---
There would be nothing to hunt, as I doubt anyone will undock, like said before, nobody undocked last time local was fucked, it's unrealistic to expect anyone undocking with a warning.
---
Overall, 0/10, quitting is still the only option.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; 2) Skews the economy, 
---
Very true, this leads to inflation, particularly of plex
---
&gt;prpvides an unfair advantage in some cases,
---
Some? Surely you mean most. Being able to earn money 'actively' playing the game, while you aren't even at the computer is a hugely unfair advantage
---
&gt; and most importantly, its against EULA.
---
This is where I strongly disagree with you. It's not bad because it's against the EULA, it's against the EULA because it's bad. To say that it's bad because it's against the EULA is to say that the EULA is some sort of moral law, that determines the goodness or badness of an act, simply because it is prohibited by the EULA. That's a ridiculous presumption.
---
Wouldn’t you just pvp them at that point? That’s what i do in nullsec.
---
heyyy, can i come chill at yours?
---
My point is that prices on SISI are fucked up always have been and always will be because of the 100 isk seeding. This would be a monumentally boneheaded change so i would wait until it happens live before actually breaking ut the pitchforks and angry mobs. Instead lightly poke CCP about it.
---
I've seen a lot of "highsec is the most dangerous, just look at dotlan kills'.
---
Wormhole PVP is heavily distributed in many individual farmholes, typically run by &lt;5 people, not at all uncommon to be done completely solo. Gimme a solo ship that can fight 20 kikis with logi.
---
The stuff going on recently has made me more interested in EVE despite never playing it. From what I've read, the best thing to do when you start is to join a corp friendly to new players. I have a few questions though.
---
How much is using the free account going to hinder me (at least until I decide to sub after getting a feel for the game)? How much time should I expect to be playing the game at minimum? Any general advice?
---
Thanks.
---
I didn’t think they had it in them, I’m very happy to be proven wrong.
---
Wh resident here. No local is normal. Man up
---
&gt;Many people dont think Eve is at its best when most people are in big alliances under big super umbrellas supported by big rental alliances. 
---
Its absolutely retarded, but some of the core problems with null are the cynos and the low effort isk. If people can farm in a super and be instantly protected by an unkillable amount of shit, what did CCP expect?
---
I hate free intel, but it is the reality that I also need to know if there is a point in being in a system. Dscan and map statistics are not enough for that.
---
&gt;He's providing people who are whining because their playstyle took a hit an alternative to quitting in a huffy fit. 
---
I actually cant tell if its genuinely that or if hes semi-trolling and enjoying the salt thinking that no matter how fucked players get, eve will always be here.
---
I thought ccp was trying to get people to move in diff parts of space and reduce the blue ball.  The more they create opportunities to blue ball the more pilots will ball up.  Next thing you know it will be as stagnant as the old China server.  Whatever eve is dieing and has been for last 10 years.b hope they are getting profits from there off the books (sarcasm) bit coin ops.
---
Local off in null always please
---
&gt; less interested in pvp because they might die and mostly want to dock up in the face of anything
---
less interested in pvp because pvp is so goddamn boring in eve.
---
want to dock up, because if you form more than them, they run, and if you form less, they get free win. Neither of those options is a win for us, might as well dock for the same result, with added bonus of them not coming for round 2.
---
&gt; Let’s make some content.
---
Making content is ok, but this change is making ME a content, do not want.
---
Just a thought from one of those long gone bittervets. 
---
We have the drifter now, and I guess they (attempt) to kill all the shitty citadels. so if you combine that with no local, shouldn't it really just be like W space with titans and NPCs trying to hard cap the structure spam?
---
Sounds like a good kick in the ass to big coalitions. Even if they name ships the same, it wont be good D-scan info, since you can just copy a symbol. 
---
Or do I just have a pipe dream here and itll never happen?
---
*Schadenfreude* is pleasure derived by someone from another person's misfortune, and this game is toxic with it.
---
WH citadels don't follow NS timer rules btw, they aren't subject to the same 10 day timers.
---
You are wrong. It's not about the immediate intel. Bots have a predictable behavior, they may react if they spot you, but what if you then just cloak up and wait? A player may then change tactics, maybe get a cheaper ship or have some friends ready, a bot will wait a bit and then go about it's business because that is what it does. And then with eyes on the bot and no change of it detecting you you can plan observe and plan the trap.
---
Players will adapt and manage to handle this and bots will try to adapt as well but ultimately they will be easier to catch and destroy. There are no bots in w-space but a lot of PvEers successfully doing their thing. The same will be true in nullsec.
---
This will hurt the bots and not the players. People are just salty because the enjoyed this perfect intel for so long and got used to it. It is about time this got fixed.
---
F
---
Like what? You get 7 overview tabs. Personally my overview has  
---
1-Structures/Gates - travel
---
2-Hostile Ships - for pvp
---
3-Friendly Ships - when im logibro
---
4-Drones/Depots/MTU's - for utility
---
5-NPC's/Hostile Ships - for pve
---
6-Hostile Ships/Wrecks/Structures - For Advanced Hunting
---
7-Everything
---
With this set up d-scan becomes easy, as anything I'm looking for can be filtered easily.
---
In null i use 2, 4 and 6 to find ratters, what site they were in by wrecks, their mtu's etc.
---
In wh I use 6 to see if any ratting is occurring at all in system and then switch to 2.
---
If I am doing pve ill use 5, hostile probes and ships will still show on D.
---
If im trying to find a pos ill use 1.
---
There is plenty you don't want on your overview but you do want on d-scan, luckily most stuff you want on d-scan, doesn't show up on overview unless its on grid!
---
Ban him simples
---
Maybe Goons do but that isn't representative of everyone else, and in fact shouldn't be the case anyway.  Cynos are meant to provide jump points for moving capitals, not for allowing dropping supers on anything that enters your space.  If you want to escalate a fight you can still bring a tank cyno ship, you just have to have 2 ships minimum on grid and dedicate a ship for the cyno.
---
Of your list capitals shouldn't have them unless intending to escalate, recons are bonused for them, blops primary purpose isn't to be a cyno and they only have one in case they get countered, HICs are specialist tackle they just happen to be nice for cynos due to tank and the fact they are normally tackling something you want to drop.
---
My suggestion doesn't stop any of those ships using cynos, it just stops people being able to rat with a cyno fit for super snuggly safety from the umbrella and it stops solo bait cyno ships.  Any other cyno playstyle can still be done by using a dedicated ship for it.
---
dont overfarm your content, otherwise they will die off

&gt;How much is using the free account going to hinder me
---
Not much at all, at first. The biggest drawback will be training skills at half speed, but all your starting skills train super quick so it's not a huge deal. Also exploration is considerably more inconvenient since you can't fit a cloak, but people still make money exploring as alpha clones (free accounts). 
---
&gt;How much time should I expect to be playing the game at minimum?
---
As much as you'd like. Most things in this game you can do 30 minutes a day or 5 hours a day. It's only advanced roles/careers that require hours of active play every day.
---
Thanks Jintaan. I started in 2007, and still find videos like this useful for helping reinforce my understanding of game mechanics, and making sure I'm up to date on the way things are still working. Helpful for new and old players, clear, and concise.
---
This is a very strong alliance. Lmao
---
They refused to undock after 2 weeks of fighting, and lost ALL their sov. Good stuff
---
You could try playing the game as a game, a thing of simulated danger and discovery, where you're faced with challenges and try to overcome them. It's supposed to be fun. Eve is a space mmo that has been approached in almost a dark souls style way, with a lack of hand holding. That's what makes it interesting and fun. If you don't like dark souls, then maybe Lego star wars is something you should take a look at.
---
&gt; has CCP listed anywhere whatsoever, that cloaking can finally be countered in some way
---
no :)
---
That’s literally the point
---
Sorta not eve related, but I'm spending 3-4 days in iceland at the beginning of august. I just spent a day in the Keflavik village for a layover and loved it. What should I spent my days in August on?
---
third time's a charm?
---
Flair checks out
---
Krabs are gonna move their ratting to hisec and farm incursions tho
---
Thanks!
---
What about the guise who don't think it's just an act
---
i am  just gonna like...notmindyoupls and hope you either become part of my content or unsub or something idk
---
&gt; a bot will
---
a bot will mark your name, proceed to nearest ansiblex to another system, and not return until intel bots spot you elsewhere.
---
&gt; There are no bots in w-space
---
CCP security had a nice presentation of blowing up cheater assets in wormholes, so that is factually wrong. There are bots in w-space. The same is true about nullsec, bots are buffed by being affected the less.
---
This will hurt players and to a much lesser extent, bots.
---
Technically he only said he buys PLEX from CCP in the clip, regardless if he implies otherwise. Listener has to fill in blanks to draw the illegal RMT conclusion
---
something about ratting in WH after criting all connections or killing WH drifter bosses with citadels.
---
That one time I outran an orthrus light missile in a 50mn MWD slicer. Many laughs
---
Big block F1 trash? cool. You been playing that long and need to quit cause of local? Looks like you havent picked up much over 11 years kid.
---
1st i dont mean to publicly embarrass anyone in my organization 
---
2nd i do not wish to face the repercussions within my organization for having SUCH  massively different point of view than perhaps they do. lots of people "outrank" me in the alliance structure and i would rather not deal with their hurt feelings here.
---
Spends first 2 paragraphs accusing people of being meaningless krabs, spends the rest of the post telling them how to krab.....
---
you talk a lot of shit. let see your character fuckboi. some no name renter trash probably.

oh okay you're in some legacy pet alliance
---
brah just leave those retardos.

Implying that finding people in local means shit 3 years after introduction of citadels.

Please, WH kids scan every sig, dock up when something new appears, had to beg CCP for a mod to close the smallest holes.

WHers have more control over the access to their location than anything else in the game. Find the right hole and monitor/manage it well and you have crazy safety.

WHers get out of having no asset safety by just keeping bpcs in their WH and their BPOs in their static connection. Only real issue is accessability on demand to other areas.

You dont understand that it's OUR isk and minerals that pay for your ships. You're welcome, hypocritical CODE member #378.
---
No RMT for River this go around. He will have to get an IRL job now.
---
I do currently hunt caps (p.s. we use HICs for that too) but have also played in null and flown both caps and HICs.  Eve is about rock/paper/scissor and fitting for a purpose.  Whilst people currently often do fit cynos as a backup on things I'm putting forward that I don't think it should be possible to do so.
---
He wanted 'globbing'. CCP heard 'blobbing', oh my...
---
I'll take payment in the form of a set of T2 Capital Hypers that Wheeler promised me.
---
you have no idea what im about.
---
you have people in this very thread claiming that the economy will crash and there wont be any more ships
---
"im saying of course that wont happen because people will continue to want to make isk and the way supply and demand works someone will decide the risk is worth the reward then you come back and say 
---
The people with multiple rorqs are the ones that have the assets to win battles. No one is worried about dieing to your 3 man nano gang."
---
so you agree with me, the crybaby carebears wont dock up and quit the game they will actually take part in protecting their pve ops.
---
you dont even know what you are arguing about.
---
im the one saying it will be fine if local goes away and it wont be the end of the game and as a pvper im fine with whatever happens to the market
---
you argue with me by saying "i dont know what im talking about and nullsec pve players are capable of protecting themselves"
---
you are on some weird contradictory tangent and cant even understand you are supporting my point which i explained to you above
---
And when you get people to form a response fleet, you fuck off as quickly as possible. That is a fact.
---
Go enjoy your PvE server. :)

I had to stop seasoning my food, I just can't stop licking the salt stone that is the forums.

Your isk and minerals used to make the Catalysts that I use to destroy your illegal mining barges. Ironic, isn’t it?

But how am I being hypocritical in any way? He’s crushing and unsubbing. I just told him to calm down.

I guess if the only thing you’re trying to do is smack around rorquals you’re right 🤷🏻‍♂️

Yes please. It'll actually be great to have more people living in whs

---
&gt;your 'jump gates' appear randomly
---
First, those are rare. For example, in my experience a new wh has spawned literally a handful of times while ratting in the past entire year.
---
And second, you roll them away. You can literally isolate yourself from all of eve and rat in near perfect safety. The only way you can get ganked is if someone logged out has been watching you roll everything patiently.
---
That can happen but it's extremely rare too.
---
There's no doubt that not only are wormholes the most lucrative space in all of eve, but also the safest. Not even high sec can match, because you're likely to get suicide gankers if you're flying something blingy.
---
Cool! 
---
Didn't even think about it.
---
A flight of unbonused lights is going to be pretty negligible dps
---
Stratios is a vni
---
And then you have wormhole groups that roll their static over and over all day, some as many as 300 times in a day. So I think you’re missing something... you have no control over a k162 spawning in your home.

---
I think you missed the point of the post. Its about CCP trying to improve the game by doing something risky to the game and to their business. You're opinion might be true, time will tell. Regardless of that, it's great CCP are giving this a go because it shows they want to make things better.
---
By all means pleeeeeeeease move your krab business to w-space.
---
Standings will be the hardest part to set up but now we have the glamourex boosters, so standings are easy!

Kyle wouldn't have let this happen

If that works for you, that's grand.  I fear we have different definitions of safer.  
---
In 0.6 it'll be three or four catalysts or a Talos/tornado for a fraction of the cost of said Loki.  They will die, but they'll probably still get their barge kills, and the 3rd party hauler will scoop the loot and head to station. (Assuming we're still talking about miners).  That's the whole CODE group's primary gig.  
---
In Null, you have the Intel from that Loki player four jumps out, you're probably in a standing fleet with a response fleet available if things go south. Probably on coms with your crew to help with the watching Intel a but.  Sure a straggler or two might get picked off, here and there, but by and large everyone will warp off to a citidel before the Loki finishes loading system.
---
I've been in null for about a decade before I quit.  Beyond the above, I had far fewer attempts on my stuff in that decade then I have had suicide gank attempts on my (non blingy)  ships in high sec while just putting around.
---
Weren't they dead after WWB?
---
If i go to a deli every week for 4 years and the quality started to go down the drain? Absofuckinglutly. I'm not gonna then kiss their feet if it starts to get better again. This ccp worship over making things better is ridiculous when they are the ones responsible for where we ended up.
---
Ill likely be resubbing 1 account soon due to this and a recent trend CCP has been doing.
---
You roll your c3 static in less than 10 min to get a fresh c3?

&gt;NullBears: DRIFTERS SHOULD SHOW IN LOCAL! I SHOULDNT LOSE MY AFK VNI
---
the actual complaint was drifters should show on d-scan and on probes.
---
And fun thing is that alphas can still use most of the t2 missile launchers and BCU's RHML Raven here I go!
---
At least you can reliably make money in nullsec.
---
Oh wow, I wish I would've known of you before. It's totally great that you know what everyone's wish list and opinions are. I shall think of you as Santa Clause, except only on Eve opinions.
---
Then you can completely lock them down with just a few alpha accounts. That's not how they will handle it.
---
Please link the presentation where CCP talked about wormhole bots.

wat
---
for me retiring away from hi/low and null sec is wining eve because l have done all my goals and WH space is all about me and only me lol
---
Will resub back when next "event" will be inability to target other players for a weekend.
---
I've played WoW exclusively on PvP servers since 2004 :)
---
The general complaint is that nullsec is safer than highsec, and that it shouldn’t be that way. What you said was absolutely asinine.
---
Well the old way included a burst jammer and targeted ecm, but that was pre-ecm changes. Now you're a bit limited by getting only one shot for your jammer to work and you better hope they dont have a a keres/lach/similar with a good scram.
---
What incursions? There are currently 4 communities fighting over one focus. It's horrible and no longer valuable.
---
It only lasts until it’s iterated on. Shouldn’t take more than 4-5 years.
---

I think they're assuming we all live in holes with highsec statics, but even then it doesn't quite work.
---
SMA ~~is~~ was still around?
---
I think they will keep the drifters as the forever boogeymen not "tame" them down wih a mothership to kill.
---
My bet is on the triglavians joining empire and the consolidated powers driving the drifters back into their wormholes until ccp need the boogeyman to come out again.
---
Wow, I'm so glad I periodically check this sub. I'm reading they are deleting local for nullsec? I'm honestly blown away by this change. When does it go into effect? Will it be permanent?
---
Let's see how it plays out first, Nostradamus.
---
there are t2 battleships
---
My abyssal long point and drones are ready.
---
You can’t do that in a rorqual, because you have a siege.  Unless you get very lucky and it ends right as the new sig spawns, you’re dead
---
I’m not sure that saying, “Thanks for finally doing something right” is anything like worship...
---
Gimme a 1 man gang comp, minimal characters, that can fight 20 kikimoras + logi.
---
yeah if you count the 15 ships that die to concord per gank as ship losses, and people killboard padding tens of thousands of shuttles at a time, it is
---
but if you look at actual pvp losses- no it's not
---
Ishtar, Gila, Myrm, Dominix, in no particular order.
---
My guess was darkness or one of its pets.
---
It's basically the only thing lacking in jspace.
---
That was the point.
---
I'm telling all my mates if you want shitloads of ISK do Burner Missions in Highsec. They are amazed they can do at minimum 500m ISK/h. 
---
You just have to know how.
---
The title being “local blackout during July” implies that the blackout ends in August
---
very nice
---
&gt;(MFW I'm in ~~Vietnam~~ deep null, and suddenly the ~~forest~~ space junk starts ~~speaking Vietnamese~~ broadcasting...)[http://imgur.com/a/2NJGBet]

---
Yes I know I've been told, didn't realize OP was talking about a Rorqual. I'm aware of how they work :D - https://zkillboard.com/kill/77539857/
---
Insurance was like that last mirror. They nerfed insurance across the board but mostly for capitals. It should already be live on TQ.
---
For example:
---
JFs used to give 2 bil insurance, now only gives 800m.
---
Dreads used to be 1.6B now only give 200m
---
What is dead may never die
---
No cynos is a much bigger advantage for defenders than attackers.
---
Its basically like a permanent cyno jammer that cant be disabled, while your enemy can also only bring caps one by one due to WH mass limits. Yet you already have a cap fleet in place because you build them locally.
---
And the lack of asset safety hardly matters, Citades on their own are so hard to kill and the logistic effort to get a cap fleet into a WH thats defender by people with that have capitals is pretty crazy.
---
this is the kind of quality content we need more of in this sub
---
This is a good shitpost
---
Mostly so you can name it Ratios so that people can d-scan you and laugh at what a dumb name that is.
---
Mmmmm more salt please
---
Asset safety...
---
How do you kill defender dreads with small subcaps if the defenders can undock Carriers and Fax to save their Dreads?
---
The initial effort to get caps into a hostile WH as attacker is insane. And if you dont, the defender has a massive advantage.
---
Half just wants to krab under the umbrella and the other half seems to want a reasonable chance of fighting other players
---
no regex support in 2k19 smh tbqh
---
In the ARRRRRRRRRRRMMMMSSSS OFFFFF AN ANGEL
---
If you want you can suck my dick, ive been told its salty.
---
Can the defender (not plural) actually bring fax + carrier spam?
---
Very ugly. Can't understand shit
---
HS Circle-jerking, I believe is what he called it
---
If fighters are 'smaller than frigs' then they should have frigate level of damage.
---
Actually I think the problem is it's dumb to allow one pilot to effectively control a whole fleet of frigates on his own. It just can't be balanced.
---
&gt; I don't think a carrier should have to call for backup if it encounters a couple of roaming frigs, for example
---
A couple of roaming frigs aren't going to be able to apply meaningful damage to it anyway. But the problem here is if a carrier can apply to frigates, you can drop it in (with an instant cyno, another problem) on any subcap fight, and it will ruin that fight.
---
I did the same thing in my carrier and a fc also told me to go dock up. Since its a capital apparently it matters more. 
---
They even posted a thread on here about me using it and the gang we attacked replied back basically saying I was safe and they are idiots for freaking pit about it.
---
So the point is to cause all nullsec to withdraw to their own space and only have to defend vs NPCs?
---
That’s hardcore bro, I’m pretty hardcore too!
---
I once flew outside of delve and engaged in player versus player combat against another player and I still have the shakes to this very day
---
Nah it probably tastes like what your mouth is spewing
---
Well they can build them in the WH, and most WH corps will build caps quickly because its such a massive advantage.
---
Sure if 20 roamers catch one guy in a dread, he dies. But whats the chance of a high level WH having a random dude with a single character doing pve without any support or alts whatsoever?
---
It doesnt take much carriers/fax to save a capital ship from a hand full of small roaming ships.
---
ask your mama what it taste like
---
It implies it at least starts in July.
---
please make longer vids and more ricardo meme's
---
It's bad for botters. Now they don't warp away when someone enters the system and the chat, so catching them is a lot easier and hopefully we also see a decline in bots.
---
Another thing is to catch ratters or miners. So those 2 professions will be more risky because you don't know if theirs a neut in the system. 
---
Sort: Pvp guys going to love it. Pve guys going to hate it.
---
I suspect you might be able to do it with 5-6 with 2-3 haw dreads a fax a bhaal and an abyssal web vindi. The amount that would suck to multi box though.........
---
These drifters are so poorly thought out though and due to CCPs ever changing mechanics we can't even begin to work to deal with them. Wormholers know how drifters work and can reliably deal with them. We could have them 1 shotting supers tomorrow and we would have no way of knowing its coming. Additionally the complete lockdown they caused for any subcap activity was unprecedented. The big blocs got the means together to deal with them now, but who knows what is yet to come. 
---
At least you can agree this is not a fun event, as you can see above people are offended when nullsec suggests these event is not enjoyable for them.
---
Furthermore we don't even know this is temporary, due to CCPs radio silence, every plan we make for dealing with current and potential changes has to be a plan that will extend out indefinitely.
---
The purpose of the war was actually to boost Imperium-bloc voting numbers for CSM. Cut through the noise my dude.  
---
Also, that's a terrible name for a war.
---
L-lewd?
---
~~But if you insist~~
---
The nullkrabs screeching about losing their risk free isk are not new players.
---
They should be dead, somehow they have cheated death 🤔
---
I love how it's a small gang of 3 fucking Cynabals that takes out a Tiamat, it's almost poetic in a way
---
'bout time one died! at least it's pretty to look at, even in death
---
&gt; Is removing local supposed to encourage this?
---
Yes, of course. Because now krabs can't just dock up when something is in local, so you can maybe catch something, and then you can bring a response, and, y'know, have a PVP engagement in this PVP game.
---
Very poetic!
---
Yeah the fit is a little disappointing really.
---
I would like to know his gang composition though.
---
I'm referring to the mechanics of the war. What its purpose was has been discussed many times already.
---
well as i played more, i can say this is 100% not true. You WILL get caught. I lost 5 ships so far in a span of 2 weeks, because im getting hunted down all the time, i also escaped quite a few. So saying "you will rarely be found" is 100% bullshit mate :)
---
But also neutral locals, NPC stations to stage from, and a lot more people passing through, so you can't just scaredycat away from every splash in local. If all the krabs go to lowsec it's still better than today.
---
And they won't, because apart from scannable DEDs, the ISK is much lower in lowsec and you don't get infinite respawning anomalies.
---
Needs more purple
---
Is that no local PVE in null? ... nothing\`s changed.
---
You can’t read, because the guy said low class wormholes.
---
Also, a couple rorqs on an r64 absolutely crushes C5s.
---
F, have my filthy upvote.
---
Keep up the good work. FUCK the QFC retards.
---
you forget that the retards you are attempting to appeal to will literally scream bloody murder if you force them to do any thing that might reduce their ticks by 1%. the creators of the mighty krab drama threads in every large alliance.
---
&gt; Forcing players into gameplay they dislike is just bad
---
And yet it's been fine when every update has made it impossible to play small gang PVP or roam nullsec?
---
"Maybe you need to cut the eve map in half and on the eastern side you have no local, no assett safety on the western side you have local and everything is safe and you can shut down gates"
---
if only there were different parts of space already where some have local, and some don't, where there is asset safety and where there isn't.  
---
I don't have an ultimate fix.  But I don't think CCP does either.  They seem to be just randomly throwing out things without testing or with a goal in mind.  What exactly does CCP think "no local" will do to the game?
---
Max abyssal rolled purple to be precise!
---
The drifters haven't been done very well. But the no local thing will be great.
---
Mine's not crashing.
---
I was fully expecting to see a small gang consisting of four supers.
---
One of the cynabals here, we caught him on an abyssal trace. The 3 cynabals were in the system next door on gate, we had our stiletto sat on an abyssal trace on the keepstar grid waiting for a dude to come out, the Tiamat decloaked on the stiletto and we went in at 0 with hail loaded in the cynabals.
---
He said his corp/organization has lots of people that "outrank" him; I can only think of worthless legacy alliances that have lots of directors and subdirectors of things.
---
ah, so you can't easily see if you are the only one in a system and have to rely on scans instead, which is harder/impossible to automate and takes more time --&gt; not as safe
---
this is interesting.but won't the game also suffer by being unable to chat with other people in the system?
---
I sense danger
---
A bit late, but I just want to say thanks CCP for the new stargates effects et informations displayed on it. It is actually really nice to look at
---
&gt; You understand that the safety I enjoy in high sec is NPC and game mechanically enforced?
---
Local isn't a game mechanic? Citadel tethering isn't a game mechanic? Being able to light a cyno and instantly drop a response fleet isn't a game mechanic?
---
You made the initial claim. The onus is on you to support it.
---
"barges mining without rorqs are super rare in null bloc sov"
---
barges are used all over the place when you don't have a super cap umbrella (and without rorqs).  without local, this will not really be possible.  sucks to be anybody other than goons, TEST, or FRT.  
---
i disagree with the idea of "embracing risk" when doing development or implementation.  this is the equivalent of throwing a container of unknown liquid onto a fire and then just hoping for the best.  This is not a good way to implement things.
---
I can see a World Ark only being able to jump. Maybe only to special cynos that have a warmup time and are visible on the overview, so you have to bring along a support fleet while moving it into hostile space. This coupled with delayed local allows for some very interesting maneuvers.
---
Don’t apologize, the internet has made people unbelieveably lazy.
---
The entire idea that people need a tl;dr on fucking reddit is simply the definition of asinine.
---
&gt; less interested in pvp because pvp is so goddamn boring in eve
---
So, uh, what are you playing Eve for? It's not like PVE or industry is exciting in its execution.
---
Phoenix not too bad. I killed a lot of kiki gang that thought they can win easily. They tried, loose ppl, and fly away.
---
Yes, but you can always go down-chain or simply roll the static to get new anoms.
---
It is 2019 so you're not wrong.
---
Well done boys! 
---
He had no backup bar keepstar?
---
Then your losing time on rolling and scouting and scanning. There is significant setup times involved in wormhole krabbing. There is 0 setup time for null ratting.
---
That is why most krabs go to null. It requires 0 thought or preparation, you just undock and start krabbing and the rest of the alliance takes care of all the effort for you.
---
&gt; Before this update I had the choice but now it's been taken from me
---
Uh, no it hasn't. You can still PVE. You just have to apply more than 0,5% of your brain cells to paying attention and, y'know, *actually play the game*.
---
Rattlesnake for the pimps, Domi for the poors. 
---
EZPZ
---
We had a Rattlesnake on us but it came too late, with 3 neuts and all at 0 with hail, it didn't hold up long enough for help to arrive.
---
Just put it in your market quickbar, then you won't have to type anything.
---
ok.
---

---
I'm mocking the people who say that, there was some people saying it unironically in the first remove local thread.

Very nice!

World War Flee is the best one I’ve seen so far
---
From the two entropic radiation sinks that dropped, [these](https://puu.sh/DPx6B/8caf428a4c.png) are the stats, nothing exciting.
---
7½ minutes a site including warping around? That's very fast.
---
These are kikis counterfit specifically to fight dreads, not mwd nano kikis.
---
Also bots: *Spams EVE online forum* "CCP lost my 17 accounts if this change isn't reversed!".
---
Personally I prefer "The Apathy war" because a lot of it consisted of people from both sides talking about how little they cared about what their groups lost.
---
kinda trash :(
---
Eyy, I'm on Reddit!
---
Have you ever lived in null? Im honestly curious because you have the impression that null is some super safe paradise. You can go on zkill and 9 out of the top ten  most dangerous systems  are nullsec systems. 90% of all the major battles that have happened in the last year have all been in nullsec. All these supers and titans and rorquals are dying in nullsec. But now im being forced to move into wormhole space by ccp. If i wanted to do that i would have moved back into my farming c6, this is were the real carebears  and spod brains reside. But I wanted a place not only where I could PVP but also PVE without taking extreme means to do either or. There was always content when i logged in, always something to do. And I had the choice to participate or the choice not to and make some isk. Now that choice is being stripped from me because now I can do everything right and still lose big. Im being forced to fight or die. I choose death. I've lived through the greatest moments of this game and im content with those memories. But I will NOT condone you and your like destroying this game and I will not support CCP when this goes live.
---
It's temporary for a month. After that the changes can be recalled by CCP. They will probably collect a lot of data to see how things progress and then decide to lengthen it or not (i presume). 
---
A lot of communication between players happens in the corp or alliance chat channels. 
---
Corps and alliances also use their own intel channel. So if someones scans a neut, the rest will know it. It's just a lot harder to see where that neut goes. If he decides to get cloaked in your system...you will not see him and nobody will know he is gone or not. 
---
So yeah. More risk and danger overall. 
---
You still can chat with others in system if you wish to do so, but you first have to use d-scan to know if someone is even there.
---
HIC rolling is used more for people rolling for content than krabs, krabs usually don't put a HIC char in a farmhole since it's such high SP.

LOOKS LIKE MEATS BACK ON THE MENU BOYS
---
It makes me laugh when someone else dictates how I should play the game that I personally pay for and sub too for my personal enjoyment. Am I unsubbing? No.
---
Lets detail those other options shall we:
---
Abyssal Deadspace PVE: Tried it, found it boring and suited to a select few people.
---
Epic Arcs: Yep run them, again boring as fuck, but does help with standings, however once every 3 months doesn't really help with the interest aspect.
---
WormHoles: Have tried this several times, however my RL permitting Primetime is stuck after one major TZ Primetime and before another minor TZ Primetime. Finding corps and pilots is almost impossible, Believe me I've tried for years, even starting my own corps which eventually ended up favouring another TZ.
---
DED Sites and Cosmic Sigs: Yep lol done it, it's ok for the first 1 or 2 sites, then it gets repetitive and boring.
---
Faction Warfare: Christ lol I think I'd get more excitement out of mining.
---
Triglavian Invasions: This initially interested me, however after running afew I lost interest and to be honest the isk is not worth the attempt.
---
HS Incursions: Timezone is the issue.
---
So I rat in my single VNI because it suits my Playstyle, Timezone and RL permitted engagement. It's the easiest and most reliable way to make quick isk, so when I do get ingame, I can join fleets and PVP when it suits me. and wife/kids permitting without having to creditcard everything just to afford doctrines.
---
I will adapt, I will find a way around this change that suits my play style and my available time. So while this change may suit you, it again is another slap in the face for those of us who don't fit the norm.

Typical CCP and the CSM not talking to everyone before they make changes.

That's not the title.

My recent experience with low, is dudes in Gnosis who wont come off station, that try and tackle anything coming out...
---
that reminds me of a trailer I saw, for eve ? Where you follow a pilot that dies and reship , again and again. Does anyone know that one ?  Been looking for that for the past 30mins I could swear it exists.
---
Anyway, if I did not imagine it, I was really hype. That's what I imagined big wars in null sec would be like, you know. Die and reship right in the thick of it, because everyone put its death clone. on the titan. That one was a disapointment :D

I know. I remembered this comment when that trailer dropped. Called it.
---
With no local coming you have to be able to protect people. Dronelands makes perfect sense you have 200 systems within your super cap umbrella. You can pack lots of people in there and provide protection, also no NPC space
---
join goons u will be fine...
---
&gt; Could not find another Post talking about this

You're a bad spy.

adapt or biomass

Holy crap. That’s some God tier hostile takeover skills... I both love you and hate you at the same time.

check zkillboard for inspiration

---
Why would you trade a dysfunctional piece of shit for another?
---
Never claimed to be any good
---
Given how Aryth is claiming there is a null wide cowards pact, set up due to outrage over drifters, to fuck with high sec, and CCP making changes that incentivize cramming as many people as possible into a single region, looks like at least null leadership is tilde tilde tilde adapating instead of dying tilde tilde tilde. Bet Test announces something similar soon, leaving even more of null empty of anything except renters.
---
I think he's suggesting that CCP bring back local after the blackout, and instead make it regional, not that there was regional chat before.
---
Yo, contract me your stuff ill put it to good use.
---
11 accounts, 1 rorq, im calling bait on this one.
---
yeah it looks like ... people just dont think :D
---
Why should a couple of accounts (rorqs) equal 1? We are talking about isk/hr per account.
---
all 4 of them
---
This was just confirmed by Vince Draken himself on the meta show.
---
Time will tell. But I think it is a good idea.
---
Anyone who has tried to attack rorqs or caps in Delve has found out the hard way that Goons are pretty good at defending them. The way Panfam was stretched out over Tribute/Vale/Geminate didn't allow for this, but the drone regions are much more compact.
---
The funny thing is, according to certain Horde leadership, NC/PL was actually against consolidating in this way, because they didn't want to give up their existing infrastructure in Tribute. So in a sense Goons did us a favor?
---
He’d still get saved despite his incompetence.

I'm not playing till drifters are gone. I don't mind no local, but I think it would've been better if they were delayed till decloak instead of delayed till speaking in local. I think if they make this permanent, they should get rid of the data that shows on the map for NPC kills, ships lost in space, cynosure, etc. That's dumber free intel than local. Also, get rid of killmails while we're at it. More free intel.
---

Adapt or bye!
---
On the plus side its summer... go enjoy the nice weather...
---
its on the meta show.. the fortress delve,  fortress malpais and fortress esoteria i guess.

Vince came to the meta show and yeah .. nc , pl and ph are consolidating .
---
Now were thinking with empires. Cool turn of events.
---
|...bait
---
I for one am shocked
---
ROFL
---
I think the observatories should just restore friendly local, with an access list maybe? You feel space is full of friends but enemies might be lurking? A bit different to WH space.
---
Before we end up with a proliferation of d-scan bots, can we export the d-scan to the hud as an option, and eliminate the button?
---
Cool story
---
Can I have your salty nullbear stuff?
---
What are they in second grade and need participation trophies?  
---
Fix the fucking game and stop fucking up promotional events.  
---
Look at how the last Russian Czar fell, and then compare it to EVE's birthday.
---
It’s going to be activated sometime this month. It’s technically just part of the drifter event, but CCP is going to monitor response to it to see
---
If it’s a good idea to keep the change.
---
Here goes an abyssal pvper
---
But usually kiki roam in mwd so...
---
and once a group gets an ark?  Only super large or super wealthy groups can own those, use those and project power with those...  Maybe if those could exist only on NULL and be really vulnerable to attack... so high risk to carry around to fool around, and used to carry fleets ??
---
If you Need local to be happy with eve your delusional. The drifter attacks will eventually subside. I hope local stays gone and they make intel structures. This feels like the first step, The invasion is just a lore reason to shut off local. Get out of cancersec And play real eve go explore some whs or small gang content. The drifter attacks only heavily effect the largest of space holders the small 1-3 system guys will be fine. Ns is literally only good to make isk and thats entirely because its broken I hub upgrades are flawed at best.
---
Eve is much better outside of nullsec ive been in a wh since like 2009 my second year havent left in any permanent capacity since.. And ive had alts in ns so I know the front line members experience also. My wh life is MUCH more enjoyable maybe not as easy or reliable as ns. But much much more enjoyable.
---
God you're beyond helping. Why would you bring a nano kiki specifically to gank dreads?
---
this might be a bit cheeky: you're welcome.:P
---
Yeah, there is just no point.
---
How many accounts does hilmar have? Geez
---
Get out.
---
I mean instalock gnosis camping has been everywhere since the gnosis came out, not sure how its relevant to the conversation
---
Sounds like you dont know what rolling is then
---
The point is you cant just impose any change and expect the game will always be here. It might actually die.
---
this was planned before the local changes,  local changes just prove it absolutely the right decision
---
Because the game is changing and they won't be able to mine/rat/ship spin almost risk free. Set in there lazy, afk "gameplay" and don't want to change.
---
This is what I assumed but I just thought maybe there was something I'm not seeing, idk.
---
Eve
---
Good move.
---
The reality, is this will harldy effect them, 
---
It will only require a addition bot or two per system. I could program it bot warning system in less then a day.
---
Adapt or Die like you told us spodbrain
---
It's great to see NSH taking the hard fights against competent opponents and coming out in top.  They look like a top notch bunch.
---
&gt;A well fit battleship costs just as much lmao
---
*Looked at 6B Sin in hangar* yep you right
---
&gt; What do you guys think?    
---
[points two fingers to eyes](https://i.imgur.com/SdILVqF.jpg)
---
Cause they can't adapt or die like they told everyone else to do for the last 2 years.
---
I choose to die rather than adapt to this Bullshit.
---
I have been playing a lot of Kenshin lately, mostly due to not needing an internet connection to play (I constantly travel for work). Whether I log in to Eve or not always depends on connection for the night, not what the current fuck up for the week is.
---
Bye it's not that bad if you have 5 iq
---
No one else has had to adapt. Low and WH space haven't been touched since at least 2001 if you were to believe the whiners on Reddit lol.
---
Null is supposed to be dangerous, high risk with high rewards, right now it's safest place in the game and allows people to mine/rat 24/7 with very little risk. With programs like near2 which are actively encourage it's generally the shitters/new pilots that end up getting caught.
---
I don't think this one is Hilmar. Probably Falcon or Rise.
---
So the issue is its somehow unfair?
---
just pvp instead of krab... sorted
---
Im guessing they might just shut down EVE soon. There was similar situation with another game(not by CCP).
---
press F for geminate
---
What about an area of contention like FW?  I am not talking about full blown FW mechanics but a timer where you have to remain so many km from a beacon.  Maybe remove RR in that sphere or make it like the old POS shields where you can enter (as if you entered the PW) but no target locks from the outside.  Not fully fleshed out but entosis mechanics are a succeed/fail with no in between.  What I like about citadel timer mechanics is the count down timer like in FW.  That gives nearly an even playing field.  It could even work with citadel mechanics where the spheres spawn around the citadel every hour (or all spheres are there but only one can be attacked per hour).  There would be no timer reenforcement.  Some spheres count differently than others based on old reenforcement mechanics but all structures could be attacked at any time by contesting the spjeres.  IDK how it would all work together (citadel's would obviously be able to interact inside the sphere to be part of the fight) but N+1 mechanics are boring and seen to make for very predictable game play.  I am not saying the bigger, more powerful fleet shouldn't win but anchoring and pressing F1 for 15 minutes 3x is what everyone is complaining about.
---
It doesn't look like anybody has brought this up, but I wonder if this is Pearl Abyss's acquisition of CCP finally manifesting itself. If they have what amounts to fuck-you money backing them up, they can take way more risks.
---
I don't know why you think krabs that don't interact with anyone, don't get on comms, aren't in fleet, aren't on discord, what makes you think any of these people post on Reddit or anywhere telling people to "adadpt or die." Most of the people saying anything in here are just memeing and haven't played EVE for years. For some reason bittervets don't stop coming here to complain. Lots of people that lean think the last few years of EVE have sucked, but want to keep playing the game in hopes it gets better at some point.
---
Even then, obviously covert cynos would have to be excluded from the "can't fit with cloaks" rule. You just add a step: light covert, jump a tanky blops with no cloak, light regular cyno, jump all the things.
---
Yes you could require blops have cloak fitted to jump, but just how convoluted does this have to get?
---
Sounds like you’re in the wrong alliance
---
This is nothing like the goon model of "fuck it, drop everything on everyone"
---
I'm always up for Minecraft, local or not.
---
I used to fly with these guys :-)
---
Pretty much the same story re: us moving to Delve. We overcame a ton of inertia when we got ejected from our space in the north, and ended up in a stronger region for it.
---
They completely reworked combat annoms in high class wormhole space just a couple years ago, and citadels completely shook up wormhole life... we adapted.
---
This looks like some of that twitch.tv faggotry. It shows your age.
---
This question is loaded.
---
I think their position is that it will kill small corps and make burnout way way more likely to players in null, oh you saw a ship that you don’t know?? Better ping for literally 400 players to log in and stage cus who knows if it’s one ratter or literally all of goon coming down the pipe. Now repeat literally every time you “feel” a ship is on the way which could lead to massive massive burnout 
---
Either way I love change and look forward to how EvE as a whole will adapt.
---
They didn't have much choice here. The Goon model is the best model if you want to become " or stay " a superpower in Eve at the moment.
---
Can I have your rorqual?
---
Bad meme format but good post keep it up
---
How would a bot know if the player logged off or something besides having d scan bots around the system
---
:(
---
Lame so this means no more fun fights from horde

They are removing local.  We've been asking them to remove local for 15 years.
---
Active playing, expensive ship and 12M ticks. You better off in a myrm...
---
More like Kenshit!
---
Ha! Got em.
---
Come at me when you lose an AT ship. Until then get back into the spod rock you crawled put of you poor.
---
Why would you be so supportive of features you haven't even thoroughly tested? It was at this point I realized you came here with baggage. The whole neediness, of the thread and point and "fighting" for or against the idea of walking back or tweaking the changes is off-putting. Basically, you tried too hard

Reeeeee wormholes are the safest space in the game reeeeeeeeee
---
With the local changes, null is going to be empty of renters as well, unless those renters can coordinate working intel channels and reliably successful rescue ops.
---
You wouldnt but the reality you dont need to. If the bot registers a incoming netural it places it self in a timer of inactivity.  Unless it regesiters the player leaving via another gate. 
---
You could easily develop a dscan bot also, but the reality it does matter bots will operate with people in system or not in the new system. But the reality is it wont matter you if they can keep their cost verse death metric low enough nothing will. Say they are able to pay off there ratting ships with 150m. You would have to kill 6 to 8 a day without them loosing a penny.

Err, this is already exists.
---
It was the reference to surgery on the vas deferens that proved it to me.
---
Tripwire and Pathfinder.
---
That is normal panfam did goons a big favour in the casino war.
---
It's really not if you have a couple of friends (or alts) and you get to grips with it.
---
Unless there are hostiles on the other side of course but that's all part of the fun!
---
No they'll just do what renters have always done, play the numbers game and make more money by krabbing a ton than they lose dying. Like when Goons basically lived in Kavela for a couple of months and horde still kept most of their rental alliance together. Renters are not players who are likely to pull up stakes and leave (and besides bots will probably have the least problem adapting to this stuff).
---
Enter system.
---
Warp to safe.

Eject from frigate.

Dscan bot always sees a ship.

---
Fuck it, take my upvote. You'll need it.
---
&gt;Swing the narrative towards downplaying getting evicted from region(s) for member retention, retreat into the drone regions and adopt the delve model.
---
Boy, you said it me.
---
you lost an AT ship to a fucking procurer, who was probably mining spod, is this why you hate the QFC? because they hurt you?
---
So put a cyno on your rorq, tank it properly, and get on comms and in a standing fleet. If you can't be arsed to do that much, why'd you buy a rorq? (Full disclosure, I can't fly any caps, yet, but even I know this shit.) If you can't afford to lose it...
---
Did you pop a nut you were so mad?.
---
Seriously you just described everything that is wrong with eve. Mostly it's people like you who gear up massive crab fleets and just waste bandwidth with lazy afk play.
---
Go play Farmville.
---
Have fun with that dickhole of yours.
---
I wonder why there are so few people living in whs ...should be hunter paridize where hunters meet other hunters to pvp ... lol
---
This is not going to do anything for roaming gangs. Maybe for a large scale war it would make sense, but small gangs roaming through null sec won't care to waste their time bashing a structure just so they can't be seen in local, except everyone will already know they're in local anyways, and as soon as they leave a new structure will be put up.
---
Good luck rolling off random wormhole spawns when it is an MCAV rage roll party

No need to lie tbh, we are just adapting.

Good trailer... when is the release date?
---
just like WHs
---
Good.
---
Large groups will have scouts out and good intelligence. Large groups are well organized that way; they will exploit the PVP potential - imagine 250 people in NGSA doing their thing and there's no local. Small groups just don't have the numbers to do that. With "no local" you could literally have a super cap fleet on the door of a small group and they wouldn't even see it coming.

Resource management in eve is way more interesting than pvp.
---
so BOT is REKTD now
---
while i ve seen many tear of pvpers about ratters that dock when they jump in, i ve never seen 2 pvp groups going at each other when they meet at a foreign system
---
No local plus drifters will make life very tough for people without working intel channels and reliably successful rescue ops.
---
But I've never understood why anyone rents in an era where Goons, Pandemic Horde and Legacy will take literally anyone.
---
Yep.
---
TEST has an intel map that shows all the chat in the intel channel, all side-by-side, with the ability to set audible alarms for specific systems.
---
On current EVE meta, Goon model is the **only** model that somewhat works. It sucks, but that’s how it is.
---
I think you will find it was the pilgrim I lost the AT ship too. Come back when you know what you are talking about mwah x
---
So pretty much recons will become meta for hunting bots
---
All the big blobs do. Just takes intel from those channels and pings when enemies are X jumps out
---
Find a new corp
---
My point exactly.
---
Makes the donut stronger
---
Good shit dude, that's some eve level math
---
People who stay renters don't want to have any kind of pvp requirement, even the "one pap a month per character on average per month" kind of pvp requirement goons has right now. I don't get why, but there are still a lot of people out there like that. (plus a ton of them nullsec wide are bots and or rmters who want as little attention paid to them as possible).
---
I'm sure that probably a realistic representation, but you can't tell a posters alliance by their flair.   
---
There are a lot of people on /r/EVE who purposely use the flair of the alliance they hate/are at war with. Sometimes to make retarded comments on purpose.  
---
Also, many people left their earlier alliance but did not change their flair on /r/EVE.
---
If they want to improve null, talk to the csm, and actually listen
---
You know how I know your lying,
---
Because if any WH groups found out you were doing this you and all your shit would get a one way ticket back to K space.
---
Also, I could see this working IF you are in like a shit ass C1 with like a null static.
---
At that point HS is more profitable.
---
I smell CCP shill.
---
Coming back to Eve, I have a curse o7
---
No specific bonus for Took on ECM burst
---
Wait.. so are the miners and ratters fine or do you need to get the Chinese to help?
---
Kyle, lets be honest you would've been playing dota or coh :P Miss u dude
---
Why would covert cynos be exempt from this? If the main target of the nerf is cloaky camping, then making it not touch covert cyno would make it utterly useless
---
Can be ok but lately became invested by a bunch of try hards in overblinged ships and HG everything pods.
---
I live in delve so yes
---
TZ coverage is a thing with defense fleets as well.
---
Total War: New Eden
---
Krabs and bots #AlreadyReplaced with actual players, sounds like a plan.
---
Test is already there
---
Nobody cares about you null sec npc battles on reinforced cits
---
For an alliance of over 30,000? Wtf? You're on crack.
---
That's your opinion and you are entitled to have it. The best resources should be in space that is dangerous. You like null resources? Then mitigate that risk or do your thing in low or high-sec.
---
ouch!
---
You're going to find not much changes.
---
The weak and disorganised are still going to be targets.
---
On the other hand, as soon as you tackle something worth killing in Goon, Legacy or Pandemic Horde space, a cyno goes up and multiple faxes and a lot of supers come through.
---
But you'll be able to catch small stuff on gates, I guess.
---
Not being fluent in highsec mechanics, can you explain how this works to me? How does one use someone else's killright?
---
I dont know if you are trolling or if you are genuine. I will assume the best of you. Soon, null-sec local chat will work the same way wormhole local does. No one will appear in local unless they say something and then that person will disappear from local after 15 minutes whether or not that person has left the system.
---
I'm not sure it's fair to call it a war at all.
---
I am willing to believe this is genuine. After all, it's on the Internet, so it must be true.
---
Our Krabs are the same people who pvp
---
I don't know what I should think about that. Thanks for the information.
---
*shrug*
---
If you haven't yet realised the Goons think numbers matter, then I'm pretty sure 2005 wants it's memes back.
---
The big coalitions will be able to handle it, it is the small to medium sized entities that are well and truly in the shite.   In my opinion it will entrench the big coalitions further, the real question is however on just how many people in those entities say, nope not for me, could be quite a lot.   I have a feeling that hisec will get busy again.
---
Cuz they were running local monitor bots and it breaks their krab network.
---
With no local, to be able to track hostiles in your space, you virtually need eyes on every gate. I doubt that going big (space-wise) is the way to go here to create safety for your line members. Stretching out that far creates pressure on the line members to get in carriers / supers, as those are the only ships that last long enough for help to arrive. For everyone else, it's going to be go cheap or go broke. Buy Myrmidon BPOs now!
---
Oh my god. That is my new 4th favorite sub.

---
hahahah, im ok with no local; makes things more spicy
---
I read trough many threads and sites the last couple of hours but could not find a real answer.
---
So I ask here. Is there a way to profit of manufacturing, invention or research without investing so much time into understanding the economics of your region you are selling and buying in? Is there even a worthwhile margin (20-50%) to be made without investing exstensive research into the market? And if not, do you have other ideas, besides PI, to make money "passive"?
---
And this makes swings between rage and applause boil down to which half screams louder.
---
We're really not upset about local. We're upset about being forced to grind buggy ass drifters for zero reward
---
I never actually thought I would consider coming back to play.    
---
This is a good thing for the game.
---
what am I suppose to do wonder around with my hands up in the air when 90% of null systems are ded
---
no local kills any incentive to spread out.  the delve model works and will continue to work.  no incentive to spread out kills any reason to fight.  so fewer wars in null.  empire building is now just getting enough people on all the time to sit in a standing fleet and response to people that try to kill your rorqs and supers.  
---
people that are happy about the experiment, what do they expect it to do?  do pvpers expect ratters just to hang out and die?  reship and then die again?
---
The old old sov system relied off something similar: pos sov, just ended up with placing hardened pos's on every moon, just ended up being boring for all parties involved. At same time probably still better then it is now where its essentially infinite but still allows hostiles to create a beachhead
---
So your fine with the local thing?
---
It s a standard fleet to shoot people, and sometimes you know people light a cyno to defend themself, and my dread come in :)
---
I'm shocked that Panfam didn't do this sooner tbh.

Trigger to dock up will be a scout on a gate and/or the results from dscan.
---
Cloaked bot at the gate with a overview scrapper of some sort.   Gate activates, the alt pings the rest of the bots.
---
Major battles and small scale daily content are completely different, and both of them need to be possible

You saw a few people complaining on here. There are like 30 or 40k accounts in the imperium? It looks like most of the goons are indeed, adapting or dying.
---
So your happy with the state of the game as it is now? You like the current sov mechanics and so forth?
---
Okay so apparently the entire last year of goons smugging about their rorqual infested no brain capital balanced MER meta didn't happen.

Blatantly handwaving the valid concerns of the smallgang community by inventing classics such as "bUt ItS a CaPiTaL", "just rorq farm until you catch up", "nanofag" and the aforementioned "just adapt". 
---
&gt;Most of the people saying anything in here are just memeing and haven't played EVE for years. For some reason bittervets don't stop coming here to complain.
---
What makes you think that when i say "adapt or die" that it is anything but sarcasm.  
---
And afaik most of the people that are actually active on this sub, starting discussions and shaping the conversation are all active, (mostly) respected players. This goes for people from all areas of eve posting here.  
---
Yes there are bittervets, but everyone playing this game for 3-4+ years will have some kind of bitter in them. Doesn't invalidate their opinion.
---
&gt;Lots of people that krab think the last few years of EVE have sucked, but want to keep playing the game in hopes it gets better at some point.
---
Lots of smallgang pvpers think the last few years of eve have sucked, but want to keep playing the game in hopes it gets better at some point.  
---
Man, maybe we are not so different, just two bittervets venting their bitterness. Really makes you think.
---
It was actually stated on the Meta Show it was planned before the drifters came along by your leader. Just FYI
---
Everyone, including Goons, have vulnerability timers, Intel channels, and I hope the knowledge of d-scan. You don't need the support of PIBC, Mango, or whoever. People going batshit crazy over nothing because they forgot how to Eve.
---
No no. See, if you have a positive security standing increase in the past 15 min, cyno spools instantly!!!
---
Just make a good title and send out links to Scope news video.
---
I think we hear them doing that for years now.. I remember when they came back to fade after announcing they would leave it for tribute/germinate and saying they would make Fade the new delve, Then they move to germinate and say they would make Germinate the new Delve, then NCPL announce they would make Tribute the new delve and so on..
---
Not really, they don't have nearly the density or allies crowded into Estoria that goons or Panfam after this do.
---
Mittens is right. Goons don't have much to worry about local. He knows it. Isn't mad. If anything the changes will amplify the effect of Rorquals, under which most players of Eve left medium-sized alliances and huddled in a few huge superpowers. So the empire builders rightfully rejoice. 
---
The drifters were different, because they introduced a new manhour tax that scaled with the more citadels you own. That was disturbing for mega empires, so he was upset. 
---
Meanwhile, the linemember might actually lose a few more things in the blackout situation compared to the usual. So Mittens is wrong about that, and linemembers rightfully are worried.
---
lachesis wants to know your location!
---
Dumb memes
---
In *this* case my post was incredibly winded and ranty, so i think apologizing to the people that slugged through that in this instance is fair, heh.
---
Not enough tilde  **\~**  **\~** **\~**  **\~**  **\~**
---
Have a fit?
---
Probably gave some good initial data on the ups and downs of no local. This could have sparked the initiative for trying it out on a bigger scale.
---
I think we have different definition in terms of krab then. I generally don't call those docking up to swap ship for content a krab; Most of the time referring those not even knowing how to light a cyno.
---
I wouldn't mind the drifters if there was a counter other than citadel guns, titans, or lots and lots of disposable destroyers. It's just not a fun mechanic to fight; if you could form a standard combat fleet and have a good fight against them I don't think people would mind as much, could be a good way to train new FCs.
---
It would also feel more worthwhile if they were an actual threat to structures and if there were a way to escape them if you encounter them while ratting/exploring/etc. Right now they're basically just a suicide button or something you ignore entirely.
---
Ishtar, Gila, Myrm, Domi ... Rattlesnakes make become more popular too

&gt;null bloc sov

aka the entire map minus provi &amp; npc null. There is barely any null that isn't under cap umbrellas.

No, seriously, get out.

"FORUM FORUM"
---
/u/uwutranslator
---
Its cute that you dont think more chnages are coming
---
"If you can't defeat them, join them"
---
fuuuuck no.  i'm not happy with the state of the game now.  but i can't see how removing local will help in any sort of way.  it is a step (a big step) in the absolute wrong direction.
---
you're right lol, he mean't the official forums, not here. My bad```````
---
They do.  It's called a heavy armor brawl.
---
This is the big difference - wspace farming might pay more for time you spend on it, but for each time you get to pve, you need to put some time into setup, run bunch of sites and then stop. Null ratting is much more ad-hoc, you can literally login, run single anom, dock up, do something else, come back and go back to running anoms - no setup, no additional timesink. Both have their advantages, it's up to player to pick which is better fit.
---
You guys still taking applications? I'm all skilled up for a prospect but have been struggling with getting back into the game lately. Not really finding a good Corp yet to run with.
---
&gt;Okay so apparently the entire last year of goons smugging about their rorqual infested no brain capital balanced MER meta didn't happen.
---
Goons has like eleventy million characers. Why do you think their krabs are the ones posting here? 
---
&gt;And afaik most of the people that are actually active on this sub, starting discussions and shaping the conversation are all active, (mostly) respected players. This goes for people from all areas of eve posting here.
---
The internet is full of 'vocal minorities.' EVE is such a den of shitposting and memes, that it's hard to have a real, useful conversation here. EVE is full of people that burn out, but for some reason it atttacts a huge number of people that want to "I told you so" and keep posting here even years after unsubbing.
---
People keep jumping on krabs, but they're just krabbing with the tools CCP gave them. CCP is the one people should be jumping on. We still have broken citadels, mining/ratting anoms, skill injectors, and nothing fun worth fighting over. It's not the krabs fault this game sucks right now. The game sucks because the mechanics are all steaming piles of shit.
---
Yep, just apply in game.
---
While I do believe you have an explanation that's true for most of the people upset by the change, it's best to not put words in the mouths of everyone.
---
Let them speak for themselves.
---
The "drop everything" rule only applies in TKE, the LXQ area (Etherium Reach) will still be under old rules.
---
What about the like 15 MWDs that I couldn’t search with “MWD” or the meta modules with the word which doesn’t let me search for em because some bullshit is between restrained and microwarpdrive
---
Fix ships... Piss off goons.... Which would you pick?
---
Of the people I've talked with, most goons that aren't krablords are fine with it. Might give us more home defense content that isn't just cloakies and ceptors
---
I fail to see how a d scan bot will solve anything. 
---
1) d scan doesn’t work on recons
---
2) tracking weather or not someone is in system or has left system will be a nightmare
---
3) cloakie roam with covert cyno bridges will fuck that boats threat level
---
4) you would need a bot on every gate constantly d scanning and a program to monitor what comes in and out on the system. Still, cover ops fleets will still fuck you
---
So yeah, no.
---
Or I can just play something else that isn't a waste of my time.
---
I think I'll do that.
---
You still get more than you pay for insurance, so for ships you can be reasonably sure will die (cyno ceptors/bombers, dictors) it's almost always worth it to insure.
---
it's mostly political
---
Fair enough
---
Im aiming atm for a 1k spm base in factorio. many things to do.
---
I dunno. The small to medium groups thrive in wormholes under the same conditions.
---
Go program a bot and spend the billions to keep an intel chain like that up. Player on inbound and out bound of ever gate in region! Lol okay.
---
It’s a great way to play Eve, let the paranoia flow through your bloodstream.  Don’t forget to spam DSCAN every few seconds, it might just be the only warning you get.
---
Not sure if your comment is sarcastic, but the moon mining changes affected lowsec. The greater difficulty in boarder control in lowsec drives gameplay differently.
---
They'll put alts on gates and keep AFK krabbing. However, it'll be a lot easier to counter them with logoff traps and they'll be a lot more cautious.
---
The bobber's set on this one.
---
What would you do instead?
---
There's only really one way to play the empire building game. I guess having to evac their territory because they knew they couldn't compete was a big wake up call to the north.
---
Uhm.. ok dude, you're just very ill informed. This is what any decent wh group does. And I've been leading my wh corp for over a year now and doing this all the time. 
---
I can tell you the kind of people who get evicted. Take a look at our killboard and you'll see. Throughout the last 14 months.
---
And what wh experience do you have other than to spread misinformation about wh life so you can maintain your null slaves?
---
They try to revert it, but somehow this breaks everything.
---
it explicitly says the standing fleet, gatecamping, no cap dropping system is now lxq in etherium
---
With no local it affords greater protection also.
---
They'll be subscription based now, costing about $14.95 a month per bot? (One could hope...)
---
What about mcav? They're active in whs but it's not like they're everywhere all the time. You know how big wh space is? Lol
---
I want to resub so badly.
---
Yes. I think there needs to be a level of government to make registration in local compulsory. Tenuous hold on a system probably wouldn't provide that.
---
Last time we ran into him in spectre, he DD'd his own Niddy, then got bubblefucked for a good hour as our logi kept reps on our inhib. 
---
If we had access to dreads, it wouldve been glorious.
---
They are to busy raging their tits off and crying about it. No local just means a more active play style instead of pushing 5 buttons and going AFK. Nothing will change if you're paying attention.
---
I hope the people bitching about this change get kicked out of alliances im blue to so i can kill them
---
:pepelove:
---
The backlash already received from Krab empires tells me all I need to know about this change. 
---
I sat and watched some fat fuck in Karmafleet stuff his face with Cheetos while semi-afk Rorq mining last night on stream. He was staring at something off-screen more than he was looking at his screen. He was surrounded in the anom by a number of other Rorqs I can only assume were having just as much of an engaging and emergent experience as he was. 
---
I plan on bringing content to these poor souls as they looked almost bored to tears. They do say that players who lose a ship or more likely to continue subbing in Eve.
---
Pre-order culture
---
thanks for returning it
---
Cloaky null Loki. Can't be dscanned. Not in local. Even if bots park scouts on gates, wait until it resets in the site- good hunting
---
and when they check for wrecks on dscan and warp to your anom your plan is...?
---
Can you brother the level of confidence these nullbears have about the dangers of wh space that they're telling *us* it's too dangerous to do the things we already do every day. LMAO
---
The biggest problem with EVE is that major alliances have stupid names.
---
Give us the next target please
---
If you are capable with the rorq it will be MORE profitable
---
"but that requires more effort!"
---
Basically this yeah
---
Not sure of your point? Everyone gets tethering and players deploy them. A response fleet will be player created and deployed as well. As such the safety of a citadel and a response fleet are not there by default, for free, and they do what they do 23/7 by NPCs.
---
Bots can already use d-scan. Gotta remove that too I guess
---
oh so you know what changes are coming?
---
wow....it took you guys a while to notice this.  like seriously. this is like France realizing germany took it over...3 days after they got taken over
---
"There is barely any null that isn't under cap umbrellas."
---
none of the west is under a cap umbrella.  nor is most of the north.  only part of the south is under an umbrella.   AND most of the umbrellas are not 24/7.  outside of TEST and Goons, the umbrellas are filled with holes.  so basically you have about 4 regions that have a legit super umbrella out of the entirety of null.
---
That's about 12 bil to start prepping for fun. I know maybe that doesn't seem like a lot, but I don't krab endlessly under a super umbrella.  I like to spend my ISK on PvPing too rather than hording it and relying on Alliance SRP to replace my losses. 
---
If you've ever been in Goons, which I have, you'll know there are people who won't undock unless they have SRP.
---
i agree, i think we will see a dramatic decrease in rorq mining and an increase in super + carriers. Vily said something very interesting on the meta show, if you're outside of the six umbrellas you're not going to risk your stuff you just wont log in. Everyone is excited about hunting.(I know i am) But who are we going to hunt if no one is logging in. 
---
I think there is going to be unexpected consequences around the no local, i would like to see a delayed local 15 seconds. maybe more.
---
Wait for concrete stats on player count dropping before believing that most of these people will unsub. They are just throwing a tantrum to see if it sticks.
---
Yeah, and https://zkillboard.com/character/3019582/ is hungry
---
I'm not unsubbing *yet*, there's still... a week or so, till my next billing date. If I do end up unsubbing, it's not because of no local, or because of any other changes coming to null, but because the random drifter attacks are still going, and are still just as random. Until that forced pve shit leaves, I'm not logging in, and I won't bother paying for a service I am actively discouraged from using.
---
eve
---
We'll see. That jump fatigue can start adding up
---
increase anom respawn.  buff rats.  fix cynos.  let structures decay when in low power till they explode.  increase maintenance costs.  increase industry costs.  nerf carrier application.  nerf auto drone aggro.  put in anti bot mechanisms.  etc. etc. etc.
---
Actually, that's not a bad idea. Integrate d-scan into the hud, but with no distance markers.
---
Because CCP has spent the past 3 years killing every playstyle but theirs and they don't like how the shoe fits.
---
The important about rental corps is that they want their autonomy without too much hassle from high-ups. If things get really rough, they usually have the means to just extract, asset safety not withstanding.  
---
There is also the cultural aspect as well, some people don't want to be bothered by randos in their corp. At the end of the day, the corps make the alliance, not the other way around.
---
If I was a renter fuckboi wouldn't we be siding together? Wouldn't I be threatening to unsub my 97 accounts?  I understand how d scan works and could easily pvp or rat without it...I've only been playing 8 years...you have no excuse
---
Flair baited?
---
What's your playstyle that the lack of local is killing? And how?
---
soon (tm)
---
Lmao are you a idiot or delusional. You dont need a entire region. They didnt need one before. Most bots are located in closed off pipes and dead ends. You need only a few to cover ingates to form your timers and move on. Remember your average hunter isnt going to wait around 45 min in a system waiting on prey. And a bot hunter will over farm making to easier for the bot to move to other bots in other regions to continue and leave those alone for a few day. 
---
Local wont brake botting, neither will drifters. Mostly because botters can out farm losses and have far more time to operate then the even most avid gamer.
---
Go make your bots, I’ll be the one dunking on you.
---
Agreed you will kill a bot or 3, but again your spitting into a self perpetuating hurricane.
---
I don't like how it has two turret slots and one launcher. It's 
---
#sinful
---
But what about friendly gateflashes?
---
Between that change and the drifters entering anoms, CCP is trying to make null more dangerous, while goons/test and to a lesser extant Frat have been focused on making their krab space safer than high sec and building up massive ADM reports, which along with blue lists, their members and leadership consider the most important things in eve.
---
Gol dern man, mucho upvoto
---
It's weird how people think this is a good thing. Everyone will just blob and leave null. You do have to factor one thing though, the hunters can fight each other and think that they will have dank frags, only to get blobbed and clubbed by the blob if they approach any fortress.
---
‘Ey Tone, look at this goof livin’ up to his name.
---
Yes I am in the alliance I flair as.
---
I'm not trying to establish a narrative of a vocal minority, i'm trying to tell you that yes, indeed, you can have useful discussions on this sub despite the shitposting. I mentioned the powerusers to explain that the critisicm raised in this sub isn't just bittervets whining, it's the actual content creators begging for change.  
---
Also bad shitposting feels like it is on an all time low, thanks based mods.
---
Do you really want to nail me on a cross for calling out the crabs that add nothing to the game except inflation and citadel spam when they think they have better ideas about how dangerous eve should be?  
---
Do you really think it matters that goons have n+1 members with potentially individual opinions when their leadership expresses the opinions that i mock here. It is leadership after all that sets the course and culture for a coalition of that size.  
---
If goons were as individual as you are trying to make it sound they wouldn't be such a homogenous blue blob.
---
Yes the average krab is just using the broken mechanisms that ccp implemented.  
---
But whenever i see a change that might affect the krabs negatively they start ree-ing like noone else. If the poor, innocent krab realised that the mechanics are broken, shouldn't they be happy when it gets changed.  
---
You will hardly find smallgang guys that would disagree with kiki, retri and rlml nerfs despite that being the primary tools used by them.  
---
That is why people are smug about drifters and blackout, it has been a long time coming.
---
God you are so dense. Like I said before If I wanted to play wormholes, I would go in one. Wormholes never excited me, they gave me headaches scanning the dozens of sigs to find the one hole to nullbear space or that perfect highsec logistic hole. I detest that gameplay which is why I dont seek to live in wormholes and hate everrytime about it even the V key spam. I dont want that gameplay forced on me and will not support such. I dont know how many ways I can say fuck wormholes and fuck that gameplay.
---
Myrm and Domi both can fit MJDs so I would argue they are just as easy to get away with
---
&gt; ... maybe not as easy or reliable as ns.
---
With my limited play time availability, I like it easy and reliable. It's about my fun-per-hour. I have no means to commit to something like wormhole space nor do I ever want to. I have not the patience or resources (or skillpoints) to be self-sufficient in farming/hauling/producing my own shit. To own an maintain my own citadel, etc. I like a big alliance and their dedicated logistics, freight service, stocked local market, people on at all hours of the day so no matter when my free time finds me I can socialize and get involved in some kind of group activity, because I have a 10-hour-a-day/5-days-a-week job and the biological need to sleep.
---
I can make some pretty easy ISK without having to grind for hours by using a carrier that doubles as my suitcase to keep my required fleet doctrine ships and a few personal solo/small gang ships stocked. One night a week of clearing havens is enough to keep me PvPing for the rest of the week. Having local keeps me from being ISK negative by feeding carriers to dread bombs, because I can see a cloaky hunter in a system and avoid that system entirely rather than risk it and hope the umbrella can save me. Or I see a gang roaming through on intel channel and get my carrier off grid; then hop into an appropriate ship to go try and them with.
---
I can roam around our ratting space to keep the hunters from getting at our krabs, and go on scheduled stratops to F1 at other blobs which is really fun for me personally. Big fleet engagements with hundreds of players on each side. Ships getting alpha'd off the field almost as fast as I can lock them. The battlefield tactics and intelligence of a big war conflict. The propaganda and local spam, salty enemies. That's just great.
---
It's not a lot of time commitment, as I can rely on the leadership and FCs to stir up content and I can provide my warm body and ability to follow directions promptly and accurately, which I'm comfortable with doing.
---
In short, being a null blob line member fits my playstyle and desired level of commitment to the game perfectly. If that is significantly disrupted by these changes, then it's going to kill my fun-per-hour metric and have me leaning toward other games that can maximize that.
---
It wouldn't be the first time. Last time I quit EvE was the introduction of fozzie-sov. New WoW expansion was coming out, and it was just kind of inevitable that other things were more fun. So I stuck with WoW for the past few years as my mainstay game, when WoW was having a slump I found other games like Rust, etc. The latest WoW expansion has been trash, Rust has has it's own problems, and I was getting a craving for internet spaceships again. So I joined back up, found a big alliance and settled in and was having immediate fun. The kind of fun that makes you stupidly stay up til 3am by accident and feel like a zombie the next day at work. Only to have this fucking drifter garbage come in ruin it. Now CCP pulling this null local chat garbage after 16 years.
---
I'm too risk averse to want to play in nullsec turned wormhole space. With WoW Classic coming out next month, and being really hyped for that, it's probably where I'll end up. I was already planning on kind of switching back and forth. Logging in for stratops still, doing some AFK Dominix ratting while in WoW, etc. Try and juggle my EvE and WoW engagement. Though that isn't really going to be a possibility now when I have to finger-fuck V every server tick to not feed AFK Domis while mainly focusing on running dungeons and grinding in Azeroth. So I might as well mothball EvE entirely and commit to the one that isn't going to willingly shit on my fun-per-hour.
---
Mittens is wight. Goons don't have much to wowwy about wocaw. He knows it. Isn't mad. If anyding de changes wiww ampwify de effect of wowquaws, undew which most pwayews of Eve weft medium-sized awwiances and huddwed in a few huge supewpowews. So de mega empiwe buiwdews wightfuwwy wejoice. dey know dey don't need wocaw as much as ofews.

de dwiftews wewe diffewent, because dey intwoduced a new manhouw tax dat scawed wif de mowe citadews yuw own. dat was distuwbing fow mega empiwes, so he was upset, awong wif evewyone ewse who owned wots of citadews. In deiw defense, dwiftews wewen't bawanced in fwequency and de amount of fiwepowew it takes to kiww dem.

So yuw can see de pwedictabwe pattewn in his officiaw weactions to dings. If it wowks fow his empiwe, he wikes it. If not, he is mad. Has nofing to do wif de content of de change, whedew it wowks fow game bawance, ow how CCP communicates it.  As yuw can see, he powtways attempts to changing de game to be mowe bawanced as "wobbying towawd changing de game to huwt Goons". Unfowtunatewy, cuwwentwy, game bawance does wequiwe changes dat wouwd take away fwom mega empiwe intewests. But he convenientwy is ignowing dat.

 tag me to uwuize comments uwu

Are you opposed to relocating to lowsec? To the best of my knowledge, the Drifter fleets aren't there.
---
Imagine having to lie not to look like a fuckboi...
---
You had me all the way to the last paragraph.
---
My wormhole experience tells me that opt-in local can only be better than the status quo.
---
Lol. I dont bot in eve bro. But not because its not easy to do. 
---
It isnt because  the rather static predictable game play(even with the changes) is hard to develop bots for. Its because the part most people dont see. CCP is one of the most active, innovative people when catching the sale side of isk. That is where they really shine. This allows them to back track the trail to hit large swaths and is much harder to isolate then the average player sees.
---
And again you cant out dunk the bots brother. They make more then you have the ability to kill.

t. CCP viral marketing intern
---
Wait until even the scarcer amount of targets deplete except in regions where you get counterdropped 50 titans
---
This is cute. 
---
Why are miners upset that they can't mine? Why are ratters upset they can't rat. Wouldn't a PVPer be salty if their ability to kill other ships was prevented?
---
Null is not WH space. Mining/Ratting in WHs is different due to mass limitations, randomness of connections, ability to roll holes, and no cynos.
---
D-Scan does not help if a group gets a scout in system, cloaked up, and you're in Siege. You're stuck for 5 minutes. With the changes from May it's even easier to kill a Rorq now. 
---
So the answer is the miners will stay docked and survive or go out and mine and have a higher chance to die, also losing 2 Excavators each time they die. But hey they can mine enough to make it worth it. Wait a minute, we just came off a 2 month war where we couldn't mine. Now we can't mine because Drifters and No Local.
---
But yeah there shouldn't be a reason to be salty. 
---
So we have vastly more Risk, the rewards are lower then they were pre-May. Basically we are the bitches of Eve/CCP. What's wrong with the game, miners/Ratters. Ratters/Miners are now easier to kill. Ratters/Miners make less ISK per activity. But Why oh Why are Ratters/Miners salty? I don't know? It doesn't make any sense.
---
The game isn't broken because Ratting/mining. The game functions on a base layer of Ratting and Mining. There are a lot of features/functions in this game you can change to correct ISK proliferation. 
---
Also generally when games release new content they try to make it funner and more engaging and not more tedious/boring. 
---
You don't like Super Umbrellas, limit the amount of mass that can move through Cynos. Create randomness, allow a chance for the Cyno to collapse based on Skills.
---
You don't like Super/Titan proliferation, create a upkeep cost for Supers/Titans. Due to the Size/Power they require maintenance to keep running which costs ISK per month. 
---
Create Super/Titan only sites that increase the reward but also have a larger chance of Titans/Supers getting killed. 
---
Limit other sites to Sub Cap and below and Cap and above. 
---
You want to engage more new players, create a skill point bonus per activity. If you mine a ton, you get Skill points to spend in the mining categories, you scan, you get skill points for the scanner categories. Not a ton but enough to allow players a sense of achievement the more they do something in the game.
---
You don't like Blob mechanics, limit the amount of ships allowed in a given space using bouncing mechanics so that fleets have to spread out, get out of range of targets. 
---
You don't like AFK players but you're happy if people have AFK campers/scouts? Really? How is that fair?
---
Get rid of bubbles. How does it make sense that a shitty little Sabre can bubble fuck a whole fleet, it's boring and shit mechanic. 
---
Also the whole entire Scout mechanic does not work. You get one guy through a gate camp and it's now fucked entirely. Or a random WH connection spawns before you can get eyes on it. You're fucked. 
---
There is so much they could do to improve this game and they don't. They just keep reading fucking Reddit and doing whatever is screeched about the most. It's shitty in all respects. 
---
This isn't the End of Eve or a game destroying change. But it is another shitty change in a line of shitty changes. Miners/Ratters have a right to be annoyed, it's their game play that's been fucked to high hell and they haven't got a single positive thing in a long time. 
---
That's why we are salty. I want to mine. I want to avoid the Bombers bars, the Marshies, the Booshers. I want to build ships and haul them to market and make some ISK. That's it. I'm not fucking this game so stop shitting on my head.

Please reread my comment and then realize how I said yes you could devolpe a descan bot, but how it is totally not necessary.

This is where reading comprehension comes into play.

I just came a little.
---
&gt;empire building is now just getting enough people on all the time to sit in a standing fleet and response to people that try to kill your rorqs and supers.
---
That's the second stage of empire: ensuring you hold what is important.
---
The width of an empire is nowhere near as important as its depth.
---
The whole thing is bait.
---
Damn, those caps just melted.
---
you sound as bad as your fitting skills
---
EvE its hunting season
---
By telling them "don't undock what you can't afford to lose"...? If they're at a point where they can buy and fly a rattlesnake they should have learned that lesson it's litteraly the first rule of Eve. (Newbro btw)
---
nah, from the discussion forum, checked first 550 comments and cross checked via evewho and zkill.
---
Ok, Send me 1000 PLEX, pronto.
---
The same when PL burned TEST out of the Vale and chased them south.
---
Observatories need to not just give back local like what we have now, or there'll just be no change once they all get deployed. Particularly if it's a FLEX structure you can deploy under a Keepstar weapons ring so you can't even shoot it.
---
&gt; they gave me headaches scanning the dozens of sigs to find the one hole to nullbear space or that perfect highsec logistic hole
---
good thing you don't need to do that in null eh
---
EHP seems a bit low for 600m and no damage cap/ timee. But I guess that's just the number. Otherwise I like what I'm seeing
---
Issue with relocation is that I have lots of very blingy stuff that would be hard to relocate in the current state of nullsec. Other than that, I'm not fond of low, mostly due to it being choke full of risk averse pvpers and lackluster pve content. If I do move, it will be into w-space, since it would be both easier from where I am currently, and it was on my list anyway.
---
The most likely scenario is that I stay in null though, either because it becomes fun to live in once again, or because I quit due to Drifter Bonanza ^(TM).
---
oh look someone just realized no local actually does the exact opposite of what they expected... hmph... it's like I been saying this
---
It might be a jab at "largest crate",  which it's not (largest is 15.4k plex at 499$)
---
Id they are ao bad i'm sure you wont back down to a 1v1 then. Pick a ship class and a system :)
---
It might sound silly, but HAM fit + 2x bcs II + dc II and the mids 1x pith x-type kin + th and one adaptive invul, 3x republic fleet shield extender + 10MN AB. Rigs: one Core Defense Field Extender II and one purger. Gives you around 61k EHP + 52 HP/s passive regen. 
---
Thats specific for guristas and serpentis sites. First 2 rooms no issue with speed tanking. The third room is the tricky thing the 3 web towers. One is usually close ... the other 2 try to get close, and kill them ... in worst case warp out and warp back in (yes you have to go through 1st and 2nd room, but by that time your shield is almost full again). You might need a 1% PG implant here, or you have to check if you can improve it without.
---
The other way to fit it is active and very tight. Pith x-type kin/th + adaptive stays the same. But then you go Pith X-type large shield booster, Pith x-type shield boost amp, 10MN AB, republic fleet large cap battery. Rigs: medium anci current router II and medium capacitor control Circuit II.
---
You are not capstable when running everything, but at 0,9GJ/s with AB off. It's an expensive fit, but comparable to a tengu, that tanks the side easily. In worst case overheat from time to time. And in super worst case warp out. It's been a while i was running 5/10, but i never had a rook dying so it def works.
---
Hope that helps a bit, sorry for no good format :D
---
Yea i was exagerating there. From the top of my hat there are umbrellas in delve, fountain, esoteria, impass, deklein, wherever the fuck FRT lives atm. Panfam is about to open up an umbrella in drones. 
---
In the other parts of null you will be hard pressed to find anything but hordes of vnis, the odd carrier and a couple of barges. And then you still have to beat intel channels/near2/bots.
---
If you want to actually pvp you can choose between horde &amp; brave and provi. It's a pretty sad state of affairs overall even if you have a couple non umbrella miners strewn in here and there.
---
Getting window lickers like you to quit playing will be the best part of the event imo
---
I'd like to think bots are screwed but I'm not so sure.  Drifters go after random shit so its not a 100% sweep and clear scenario.  Bots now just have to place scouts on gates and retool their programs to trigger a fleet warp when non-blues enter system.  
---
Its fanciful thinking to thinking botting is gone.
---
it's almost like this is what I have been saying yet in your superior stubborn ignorance you proceeded to push aside the "this is what's gonna happen as a result" from people like myself and power forward with dumber and dumber ideas
---
I will not be lending you a ladder, you rightfully enjoy the cold dampness that hole has to offer you
---
Jesus, was all caps in the title really worth it?
---
TEST can't compact like that. The autism threshold would be breached and they would start killing each other (in game) as the forums caught fire and the diplos commit sepuku.
---
Edit: hi im dentass
---
See this person knows what he is talking about.
---
u/uwutranslator
---
You are right about the fact that it will cause people to more consolidate. Goon Rorquals aren't really at much risk because they mine in hordes anyways.
---
But, we can all agree here that there is no way ratters are going to feel comfortable about this, not even supercarriers knowing very well that they can be jumped on by a 100 bombers.
---
But, I think this is something that needs to be tested to see what happens on the gameplay and meta game. I would like to see the direction it takes. This was much needed, and it will be fun to see how easier it is to bomb excavators, how easier it is to bait, how easier it is to have them be burned out, how easier it is to bait them on TCU's and citadels which are extra and out of reach.
---
Goon man bad
---
&gt; diminishing returns
---
You should be careful what you wish for
---
:inhales: LOWSEC
---
Ahh shit, you're right. I didn't notice the arrow. It's been a while
---
Plus Brave still does open recruitment so if they crammed their allies in the awoxing  and blue hunting would hit hero levels
---
Pretty sure alot of people know the actual outcome it's just not talked about and alot of people are pretty excited for the smallgang content/maybe new meta
---
Alot of the ones who resubbed to fight krabs/standing fleets will realize how aids some regions are with super umbrellas and complain on Reddit
---
because there is pretty much nowhere else to find it. Also nobody seems to be crying here
---
I love your mentality.
---
It wasn't a war. 
---
How about Operation Elephant Stampede?
---
It wasn't really a "world" war though. I wish we could get passed those naming conventions.
---
Try Desert Swarm (because glassing). Not only does it represent the manner in which it was carried out but also the end result.
---
Think of the historians. Don't make them write terrible names like World War Bee lol.
---
You forgot break the game as an option.
---
Isn't that just local then?
---
You don’t really need to know a ton about your region for industry to be honest. 
---
The only market really worth selling in now is Jita. You can make profits just fine by buying all your material off buy orders in Jita as well. Where you build is up to you but then it’s on you to figure out your logistics either from a wormhole, low sec or null sec to Jita. The other viable option is to setup in your null alliance home but then your research is easy. Doctrine ships, ratting ships, and sabres. 
---
Eve isk per hour is a program you should get familiar with if you’re getting into industry. Makes finding items to make a whole lot easier. It’s only the initial research that really needs to be done. Most markets are fairly set in their ways unless a patch hits or a major war breaks out. 
---
As for 20-50% margin though that’s some awfully high margin you’re looking for there. Not going to find much return on investment like that anywhere in EVE.
---
I actually got downvoted for saying that wow
---
Thank you, I wanted to do this but busy with flooring today.
---
Totally expected results too. Fuck em.
---
What have you been saying exactly?
---
Idk how you disillusioned yourself into giving yourself any credit in anything about this.
---
THERE HAVE BEEN NO DRIFTER ATTACKS SINCE THURSDAY
---
THIS IS FAKE NEWS
---
\+1 for having the courage to admit he's a sloppy bottom
---
you'd have to know there was a bot in system first but there's no local so have fun with that
---
&gt;iterate
---
\*laughs in Jestertrek\*
---
reading some of the comments the last few days over the changes i have come to the conclusion that null bears are under the false impression that its there right to have entire regions of space for solo projects and thats what piss them off the the most with this change to local they will have to share there sandbox
---
i dont think he forgot lmao
---
LUL
---
You can build as many caps as you want in a hole. The common bottleneck is usually humans not ships.
---
This is why a larger corp can seed a hole over time then still win against caps. As long as they hold hole control they only have to kill each toon once and they cant get back in from k-space to re-ship.
---
Ishtars are a lot easier to kill than Domis btw.
---
Humor me: your shit is on timer, a foe seizes the opportunity of local radio silence and attempts guerrilla warfare against your stretched thin assets. What then? Everybody glued to intel and every man at a post can’t blink? Seems stressful.
---
Conduits offer a spit where you can fight a set amount of enemies, kind of like a regular anom.  The rewards are the same as fighting regular trig rats plus some BS spawns. You can maybe solo a minor depending on ship and fit but the waves are timed and if you can not kill them fast enough you will get overwhelmed. I do not believe you can solo a major.
---
Hows local doing?
---
Yes, they did indeed melt quite fast :D
---
gnosis with fof missiles.
---
You can put a killright up for sale.  Anyone passing them can see it if they look.  If they want a shot at the pilot they need only pay the killright price and they have the right to shoot that pilot.
---
[You're god damn right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9RVS8cjNN0). Go forth and kick ass!
---
I want to add, **subbing** is best for the game. I proudly sub for Omega via my IRL hard earned $$$ -- I will *NEVER* ***EVER*** obtain Omega via the buy PLEX with ISK route. My rationale why:
---
1) If subs don't keep EVE's lights on then the Wallet Warrior Whales will become the 'paying customers' for whom the game will be catered to. I DO NOT want a future where microtransactions have completely taken over, so I vote with my wallet for the subscription model. I am grateful that CCP still *offers* the direct-subscription model and haven't terminated it in favor of forcing everyone to buy PLEX (we may see that occur if too many subs cancel).
---
2) If I cease to be a paying customer, then my opinion about the game's future is *definitely* worth absolute $0 to CCP (how much it is worth to them when I *am* paying is probably "not much," but certainly not absolute zero).
---
3) I value my time *at minimum* the amount I make per hour at my IRL job. There is, plain and simple, no ingame activity whatsoever whose ISK per hour can rival it. I have no issue with buying PLEX -- as long as I paid CCP for it myself.
---
Its amazing, its like youre completely blind yet you somehow found the reply button...
---
Thanks for the write up. To bad it boils down to your last paragraph.
---
Your to risk averse. You cant enjoy eve without risk. Simple as that.
---
wouldnt know, unsubbed and havent logged in two days.
---
The thing with deleting local is, you won't get more PVP. You'll get more krab kills on those who were not paying attention to the changes. Guess what? You were killing those krabs anyway. Local or no local, there are always idiots to find. That is not pvp. That is hunting krabs. Very important difference.
---
It's a tired meme of CCP releasing things and then refusing to iterate on them.  Back in the past they'd dump something out say it was a work in progress and then just never touch it again.  CCP of today is at least better at continuing support for the new stuff.
---
If ccp doesn't reverse this decision I am unsubbing my 80 accounts all of which I do not spend a dime on and instead only use plex making them effectively worthless to ccp that ought to teach those out of touch idiots
---
Are you retarded? They literally just communicated that it will happen, before it has happened. Now it can be discussed by anyone in the lead up to it happening.
---
I mean, of all the entities eating crow right now...
---
Really not that hard to guess when you can check it's activity by the map and other key telling points
---
How to get everyone running hisec incursions on alts in one easy step
---
&gt; Miners/Ratters have a right to be annoyed, it's their game play that's been fucked to high hell and they haven't got a single positive thing in a long time. 
---
Just quoting this for posterity.
---
triggered
---
Small doesn't mean dumber or less active, and larger doesn't mean smarter or more capable. These things are entirely seperate from one another, other wise goons would be the best small gang, blops, super hunters and main fleet pilots.
---
They aren't. Large groups are ostensibly built off the backs of a few dedicated individuals but you can find the same level of commitment in smaller groups.
---
This line of reasoning is flawed. Please put down your kool-aid.
---
It's both really. You'll catch some krabs that aren't paying attention, but you'll also lose that hesitation for people to engage based on what's in local. Maybe you have a surprise for them, maybe they have a surprise for you.
---
That's why I just stick to forsaken hubs in my domi.  I let the carriers take the havens its not like ticks are any different either way.
---
Yes isnt that totly crazy how the day your subs expired just perfectly lined up with the day changes you dont like are rolled out. I wish I had your foresight
---
Anyone with half a brain with no super carrier has already been doing thing
---
I'm not here to SRP your Caracals you keep losing
---
Then learn to fight.
---
You really wasted my time with a Reddit post for this
---
Shh, maybe if they don't know any different, they will believe it. They really are a quite gullible lot
---
gotta be able to claim active use of blops in their corp ads amirite predditors
---
Flair checks out. Yes, yes I did
---
evE
---
Problem with that logic is that off all the null-sec areas in the game, this will have absolute fuck all effect on Goons and TEST. They have the numbers/resources to protect their krabbers with minimal changes to the way they operate.
---
The people this *will* effect are all those living outside those protected areas, and it will drive them towards those blocs in an effort to protect themselves. They may well be able to handle the odd solo hunter or small gang, but those are the least of the threats people have to deal with in null. This isn't wormhole space; you *will* get dropped by caps and supers eventually once groups like Snuffed realize you are out there fighting back.
---
The end result of which will be a complete lack of any content *outside* those protected areas.
---
I haven't played EVE in years, what is crab a reference to?
---
nah, seeing people in local isn't a big change for rorqs. if someone was in system while you're in siege, you're getting caught either way. the only way you get advance notice is intel channels or alts up the pipe - same way it is now
---
Yeah its not a well planned attempt at all, but it is an attempt.
---
lol get fucked crab
---
There's also the alternative of:burners, lvl 5 blitzing, fw farming, etc.
---
I congratulated you actually, and said I was wrong about me saying you wouldn't get elected. So no, it did not "*hit my psychology hard*" - I am disappointing that you took the seat of someone who might would have been more open to criticism and less stubborn so when someone told them their shit idea was shit they wouldn't double down. The no local is a clear example and I'm super excited every one bit in to the narrative "*GOONS HATE THE NO LOCAL IDEA*" b/c no it's not us influencing a change that pushes us way ahead of everyone - it is you, so thanks!
---
Credit? I'm not looking for credit in anything - I wasn't the dumbass who promoted the terrible nullsec-bloc empowering idea of no local - you were haha. I just wanted to tell you I told you so. Dance puppet!
---
Nope. Incursions were nerfed with the invasion. There is only one focus at a time and all the incursion groups have to compete against each other now. Better find somewhere else to run.
---
I can accept a certain amount of manageable risk, it's EvE afterall and my killboard isn't without losses. Nor do I have any compunction about undocking a ship and understanding that I can lose it. The level of risk exceeds my comfortable threshold when you take away my local chat intel. I dislike playing in Lowsec (sec status hits, gate guns, no bubbles, etc). Empire space is a complete waste of time outside of buying shit from Jita to export home. Which leaves wormhole space (which I already explained is simply out of the question for me personally), and nullsec which is the right level of manageable risk, reward, and mechanics. Make nullsec into wormhole space then it loses it's appeal, which leaves me no other option but to look elsewhere for entertainment.
---
OP is a troll alt. Pathetic af.
---
Yup, somebody didn't read announcements in channels. This has been planned for awhile.
