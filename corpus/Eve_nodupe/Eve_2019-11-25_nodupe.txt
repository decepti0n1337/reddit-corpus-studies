If you want to do arranged fights just go to sisi. If you want to pretend-fight you might as well pretend-fight on the pretend server.

---
Arranged fights on TQ should be dropped on every opportunity!

Class 3 wormhole
---
Gotcha. Thanks.
---
Thanks
---
No, he's talking about WHs, not 0.0.
---
NP. Run some of the ones in Delve, they can be fun with the right people.
---
I had this probem like a day ago, just left the client running for a hour or two out of frustration. and it worked
---
Then make sure to get on good terms with the pilot  so that they will tell you their sites and sell an in cyno for a  group to come kill that super.  That would be the true Eve way.
---
CCP Peligro is the guy who hates russians, good luck OP
---
Eve wide war !!!
---
bahahhaahhahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahah
---
oh wait you're serious. let me laugh even harder
---
BAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
You should make another ticket and ask if I can have your stuff
---
&gt;how does one learn PVP solo if either the hunters are multi-boxing and working on overkill or others run or are not fit for pvp? 
---
I ran into a similar problem. I think, unfortunately, it's just a matter of mass - keep looking and you will find PVP encounters. Also, while not strictly solo, fleeting up with a small gang can improve the number of targets you can take on.
---
They gave you a 3 day and took ISK, you decide just to change sites and wonder why you were banned?
---
Have prices gone down so much? I used to get 200 to 250 an hour off exploration in venal.  Granted that was like 4 years ago
---
I can't imagine why FRT lost, almost as if Legacy blued everybody else.
---
Yes, defensive plexing happens that way. Roll cheap, null losses when that pvper that is not even FW comes looking for solo deplexers. They always roll with builds costing much of a bill, so.. meh, roll cheap and accept your losses.
---
Some PVPers may get salty at the cheesing, but rolling expensive does not pay unless you have a big ship to haul several classes around for different size plexes.
---
You must have missed out on the Ventures deplexing era. Funny stuff when you see one running from you in a large and then your laughing stops when a non-FW nestor jumps you in full t2 guns, ammo, mods and gear;  Just shrug and join the venture bro.
---
bro üòéüí™
---
You got released because your way of playing EVE was abusive, you get clear notification but at the end of your ban you continue to do the same shit in cosmos... And you come crying here. Do you wait for compassion? The 24/24 cosmos ratters are noxious, your ban is well deserved.
---
Are you sure you're not a Russian botter?
---
I don't trust my alts to help out either man. Bunch of moochers living off the iskies my main makes.
---
My problem is I no longer know which is my main ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
&gt;While this activity does not necessitate the use of a 3rd party program in order to carry it out you ARE generating income in an automated fashion while sleeping which is not being present playing the game.   As such our automated systems will continue to detect and institute administrative actions for this activity. We do not find this to be acceptable gameplay.
---
While this is true, I would prefer the automated system spawning in a squad of triglavians instead.
---
CCP aren't based on the US, the BBB can't touch them.

[deleted]
---
No idea myself, was on comms when we heard these lads where on their way down the pipe (I think around the time they where in Q-U or EX6?).
---
PS: Hi Abi, hope your well. 7o &lt;3
---
How are they being uncooperative? They literally tell him who to contact, he is refusing to do so. He was told why he was banned the first time, then proceeded to not change his behavior and then wonder why he got banned again.
---
Also, the BBB is a joke, it has zero power and no one cares what they think.
---
If they are farming or using alts for defensive plexing, it is common.... Even if it is cancerous to pilots like myself and others who want the PvP's.
---
OP SUCCESS CULTURAL VICTORY
---
The latter more so than the former.
---
Thanks for the reply! That's a lot of things that im not really familiar with, but maybe i will just focus on some of the pvp, and maybe not the faction stuff for now.
---
Hopefully i can learn enough for when it gets updated :-)
---
I don‚Äôt know what to tell you my dude, exploration, or hunting explorers, is my bread and butter as I scan and map jspace for my corp, a lot of my time is spent waiting and stalking, but when I‚Äôm in full explo mode I make 50-150/hr.
---
What‚Äôs your fit? Do you use a mapping app, do you feel you have a good understanding of what type of sites spawn in what systems?
---
I run a Astero with sisters launcher, Frostline analyzer, T2 hacking rig, Blackglass hacking and Prospecter scanning implants, the rest gets mixed up, and I carry a depot to handle some other possible situations.
---
So how do you know that the OP isn't correct?
---
A pvp fight can escalate in something bigger. The escalation is specific combat site given by another one. Some of them are really worth to run.
---
I'll try to provide a brief overview. 
---
First of all, you got it mostly right - escalating a battle means bringing a bigger, better class of ship onto the field. The pilots don't usually re-ship, they instead stay in the fight and keep the enemy occupied, while bringing reinforcements. A common form of escalation is bringing capitals into the fight, not only are they super strong against all subcaps, but they are often also the easiest to bring by virtue of their jump drives - they have no travel time between your staging area and the fight, as long as they're in range. That said, escalting can also just mean bringing any kind of reinforcements. 
---
That said, here are the two main reasons why you would avoid escalating a fight. The first one is that an escalation that the enemy is unprepared for will in most cases cause them to immediately look for ways to disengage and retreat. If it was an even fight until that point, that just means less content for both sides. 
---
The other reason is that it's risky. If you escalate to caps, you are putting a lot more firepower onto the grid, but also a lot more value. If the enemy was expecting you to do this, and prepared their own counter-drop, your shiny capital fleet might be in big trouble now. Maybe the escalation was exactly what the hostiles were looking for, and the subcap engagement was just them baiting you into dropping your fleet so they can kill that, and you never had a chance to begin with. So a capital escalation should only be carried out by FCs who are familiar with the risks involved - who else might have a fleet in the area, are they friendly with your enemies, can they threaten your escalation, do you have an even bigger response to that, etc. etc. 
---
Take this fight for example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRyieLU_vRE
---
The video is from the perspective of a Goon fleet. The story starts with a Pandemic Legion pilot dropping his Naglfar close to Goon space. The Nag itself was likely an escalation to a bait subcap engagement. The Goons then respond with a counter-drop of several super-carriers and titans. You can even hear them say on comms, 'dumbass, how many times is he gonna get baited?' However, PL then uncloaks several Tengus, which immediately cyno up and PL is able to escalate into a big dread bomb, and surprise the Goons, which were not prepared to fight that kind of formup. Goons immediately try to organize yet another escalation in the form of FAX and more supers, but they are too slow and most or all of their initial super fleet (including the Revenant) die to the dreads. So this is an example of a multi-stage escalation where firepower is increased exponentially with each phase (subcap -&gt; single dread -&gt; supers -&gt; dreadbomb).
---
Again, if you think that using ADCs is a drawback then you've clearly never flown AFs or HACs.
---
I don't think we are talking the same place bud
---
Lol Brave hates BOLD. If it were up to me I'd declare war
---
They salvage brave wrecks and don't return the stuff to the pilots, even though it's common knowledge that it's the right thing to do. They shoot blues that do the same to them.
---
FKF Aurgurnet once ordered a fleet to shoot a blue that was salvaging a battlefield AFTER the battle was done. Those bozos left because they don't like the rules
---
rant done. maybe
---
Pre-Arranged? Lol. Didn‚Äôt even know this fleet existed until it hit EX6. What else do you expect to 75 BS? Brave managed to form like 25 Machs with the 10 min notice we had. So if you can‚Äôt manage equal numbers you ship up. So we did vOv.
---
my complain was about game support and my ignored tickets. If they explained to me the reason in ticket about that first ban half year ago then i would stop afk ratting. I asked what i violated in game support ticket which was ignored for more than 6 months and there was a bunch of afk ratters on the site so i did not knew they all violating game rules.
---
I'm pretty sure they wouldn't play up the hype with a mystery like this if they didn't think we'd enjoy it.
---
&gt; im really somewhat happy because i dont need to start the game every day for afk farming isk.
---
You didn't need to do that before you were banned either.
---
Likewise.  I die a little inside when I hit a chain of seven C2's and it's nothing but sleeper sites.
---
not botting but afk ratting like others do. And i dont expect any support from reddit: considering auditory i need to admit that i am gay (but i am not) to receive sympathy and support from tards like you.
---
So he can build the T1 components out of the researched BPO? :shrug:
---
Sure but then less relic site spawn in the region you are farming and you waste more time moving around/scanning new systems/taking more risks. 
---
I can see that making sense in WH c1 to c3 since you might want to move around more to avoid getting ganked, especially if your ship is not that great/well fit or if you are not hacking that fast yet, yeah. But low sec/null sec it seems so counter productive to leave all that value on the table if you intent on roaming there for more than like an hour. If you clear relic site only, then soon enough only data sites are left in the region anyway because everytime you clear one it could respawn into a data site but not vice versa since you are letting those there.
---
yeah that one wouldnt post tho kept getting removed this the only time its been posted :3
---
yeash! I was at my PC but played other games, watched porn, eat and even slept near. Sometimes i was really afk because i have toilet on other floor.
---
That legacy fc is pretty smart. 
---
He knows no one in goons can drop dreads in him without getting kicked.
---
What is a dreadbomb?
---
Why is this like 10fps
---
Yes if you take the shit components from the data sites, you have to leave behind the stuff that used to be for making data interfaces.
---
From the other side he's not alone. There are multiple ships on grid and attacking you. This is no different than if there were multiple people. How the fuck are you this stupid?
---
You can't even keep track of your own bullshit. I haven't been the one pushing a broad brush generalization of your entire faction, I'm simply countering your idiotic claim with actual history of the game. Your "never experienced Gals who would fight against the odds" story only works in a world where GalMil didn't fight, and win, against multiple blob invasions. Invasions by blobs that were at their time literally the biggest blobs in the game: TEST, then Brave. 
---
What's really hilarious is that you're acting like I'm being all unfair lumping you in with the null blocs. Nah. If I'm gonna start throwing out broad slurs of an entire militia, then CalMil is and has always been \*even worse\* than the nullsec blobs were. At least they were blobs that would actually \*\*bring good fights\*\* which in my time CalMil has almost never been reliable for. 
---
But ya, I can tell there's no penetrating your deep sense of victimhood at this point. Enjoy that narrative.
---
This is gold.
---
People only do data sites for the data cores and decryptors used in invention/tech II production.  Those people are few and far between.
---
&gt; relic sites are a extremly rare sight because exploring is now crowded like never before.
---
I'm in brave, exploring in catch, not only was it seriously crowded with newbro explorers but lots of neuts also exploring becasue of the intact armor plates. You can't get much more crowded than 1 explorer per system and even then you can still get plenty of relic sites.
---
It do be like that!  
---
  
---
Though once the drop happens, I'm a big fan of "extract and go fight next door". Because fuck their timers
---
yeah pcgamer always were a useless bunch of pricks
---
&gt;than any of the actual fcs
---
Just because my favorite doctrines are memes doesn't mean I'm not a real FC dad
---
= nothing will happen, just trash talk for public
---
Did you prearrange the agreement that it was not prearranged?
---
Use data analyzer on enemy citadels.
---
Find an enemy citadel that has a good reinforcement timer at a good time.
---
Destroy enemy citadel shield.
---
Have fleet battle over citadel armor destruction.
---
Tards are gonna tard.
---
Well, this is how it will actually happen within the two blue donuts. Get used to it.
---
Also make it easy the swap characters. Not have to completely relog
---
I love these. The kill-mails are always 250m+ &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
---
I'm not sure we want Soda and the "cancer NA streamers" over here. There is WAY enough drama already
---
tl;dr Game is hard, want it to be other way around.
---
&gt;  I literally fly to a site, kill a red thing, dock, log off.
---
Just to remind everyone that this was the reason dailies were abandoned the first time round. CCP wanted us to have meaningful interactions from daily login rewards, and that didn't happen because everybody just did the bare minimum to get that reward and then left.
---
Seems they stopped caring about that a long time ago.
---
Got 2 question..
---
How dangerous are the occasional Autothysian Lancer patrol? Are they worth killing?
---
Do Empire/Corp (for example Gallente Navy or ORE) NPCs drop anything wortwhile? Is it possible and/or advisable to farm them?
---
CCP Round strikes again
---
So you blobbed 2 Frigs and now you are proud of yourself? Duh...
---
even if it wasn't why would you drop caps. Big nullsec alliances hate fun
---
We all have struggles in life and lots of people become suicidal. It's no excuse for speaking to people like shit. 
---
Not once have I heard him apologize for being ass holes to people. So that's a load of shit. 
---
Having struggles is no excuse for being a rude asshole. Good riddance to him. 
---
On top of that, going online telling everyone about his problems. What's up with that? Sympathy cry?
---
nah, that's not why. it was a pain in the ass.
---
On the contrary, we went from 'bottom of the pile' having very little left after being kicked out of the North from our Deklein home, to now owning the western side of the galaxy, to having more kills than any other alliance, to having more titans and supers than any other alliance and to producing more wealth, ships and goods than any other economy in New Eden. In short, we went from rags to riches in the space of two years.  
---
Contrast this to the enemies who have literally done stuff all for this game, who refused to engage in capital battles in the North with us. Who didn't get with the meta and didn't build any real industrialist base until recently. Who had to rely upon the RMT of online Casino money to have any success and who continue to unfortunately, pose no real threat to us because they're just bad at this game. You can't blame their disorganisation on us, for stagnation.
---
it migh yes, but when someone is carebear and see redKB astero, he would probably just keep going instead of actually do something about neutral in local.
---
That's quite often scenario which I'll see all over the place. Without zkill they will have to actually pay attention at least ;)
---
I know i already made a post stating my opinion but i would like to sum it up and say i think   
---
Zkill = Good  
---
and as such will recommend visiting  [https://www.patreon.com/zkillboard](https://www.patreon.com/zkillboard)  and support the guy running the site, as it is not free to do and it does take from his sparetime to keep it running and up to date.

---
60 minutes of solo roaming is more learning than a whole week of fleet pvp. This is not good advice, sorry.
---
Can you link to some of the more active Korean Eve forums
---
C4 and C6 mostly crabs yes, C5 space and C2 space mostly PvP-groups. C1 and C3 entrance level space with a lot of n00bs ... basically like Karmafleet ;-P

---
While frigate pvp is very fast paced and little room for error being the difference between winning a fight or losing one, if you do learn how to pvp in frigates everything above a frigate gets easier.
---
I learnt to PvP in a similar fit vexor, 1600mm plate though and neuts, drone for damage. Hella fun.
---
How to profit from lp? I used the isk per lp website and for one item on buy prices which was 27k lp i could sell it to a buyer for 55mil showing a 2k isk per lp but the item has a 10mil isk cost and some insignias and ores which show as 208.000 as cost. Is this 208k in lp or in isk? How do i calculate how much do i get? 55mil-10mil?
---
Hooray - time for another rigged blueprint lottery. Just make sure you're friends with an 'anonymous' CCP dev so they can spawn a BPO in your hangar tee hee...
---
Pilot's name lol.  "You guys help please my Mazer....  Naga fleet!"
---
I can observe a desire for a green killboard in myself. I consider this a bad thing, and on a rational level try to ignore it, but I find myself unable to really shake it. It's a very curious feeling.
---
I like the intel part of it - not in the short-term, and not even to figure out what a particular pilot flies regularly, but to get a feeling about what ships and fittings are out there, and what they die to.
---
The incentive to avoid losses for a green killboard is a **strong** net negative to the game, in my opinion.
---
how many seconds before the server shutdown?
---
100% Their are corps based on zkill. And I had/have CEOs and leadership who will tell u to dock up if they think u wont win the fight. Doestnt matter if ur having fun they dont wanna see red on killboard. Some people wake up check zkill and base their entire gaming experience off of that. Instead of undocking and playing they dock till an end say fight.
---
Where do you get these small injectors? I thought it was from the event which ended already. Dumb me did it only last 2 days of the event while i was in my 8th day of playing since i didnt know how much is 10k skill points and did only trade hauling
---
Well tbh if you get older and don't have much time for gameplay - big groups give you the freedom of ignoring big ops due to RL stuff.       
---
If you are in smaller groups and you don't join this fleet you can lose a lot.           
---
In citadel era it is like NPC space with NPC stations or big blocks.
---
f12 - report bug.
---
Or you just want to inform internet that you encountered bug? Because posting here will do nothing to your issue.
---
Yeah, brother. Capitalism doesn't work and communism is even worse. National Socialism is the future.
---
nope just letting pl know that apperently you can warp now when you get stuck in a gate tunnel, normaly you cant do anything
---
because it's easy- for the brainless you can get spoonfed content, participate in cliques, make super safe money, and the sky is the limit on scalability.
---
plus people like to 'be a part of something'
---
Ok, we can go from here.
---
Don't forget to measure response you got to control the stimulus. If you want to prove a bot is reacting in inhuman time, you need to provoke it N times with M different situations. A player aware of the danger may behavior like a bot for a small window. It may not do it in different time frames under different situations.
---
Again CCP just needs to make invisible ships and let bots "self denounce" themselves since only a software reading memory could do it.
---
My point here, and it's a shame people are so eager to downvote and don't care about understand what's about, is: TO MAKE A PROOF, YOU NEED TO CONTROL THE INPUT, not just the outcome. The "bot hunter" did not make a scientific controlled experiment.
---
E.G. Players may try to keep doing krabing or will cry for help in fleet char IF the neut does not leave the system. A BOT may be bad programmed and forget to check for neuts before undocking. Like why a player would undock just for re-docking? That would bring a hypothesis!
---
So, good luck I hope you understand how far you are from the truth and understand you have a culture to assume too much too soon.
---
Glad to see somebody civilized. o7
---
No, I'll rather take capitalist irish potato famine than that thank you very much. 
---
At least I stand a chance of survival.
---
&gt; Obviously you are prepared to talk in circles for the sake of ‚Äòtaking up a fight‚Äô so I got nothing more to add.
---
I'm not talking in circles you keep trying to insist you are correct without establishing why i should substitute the definition of a word with your interpretation of it.
---
And yes i will continue to argue until you give up and leave or convince me. That's what reddit is here for.
---
yeah its strange, notmaly you cant do anything
---
Its not at all a numbers thing unfortunately. Its entirely about WHO is in your alliance and how they behave.
---
There are alliances with multiple thousand members that have somewhat lacklustre content. And some with maybe a couple hundred people that are MUCH more active and enjoyable.
---
A good CEO and framework of FC's/directors are  what defines the alliance IMO, you can have 4000 members following a boring ceo and be bored.
---
Or you can fly with 300 guys, with a great, charismatic CEO, and a group of dedicated, enthusiastic and engaging FC's and never be bored
---
why not?
---
fyi posting on reddit has caught the attention of devs much more often than bug reports
---
SEE: GHOST TRAINING
---
100% i agree. Right now the third group is majorly overserved, the 2nd group is ok with this but its damaging the first group and this will eventually kill the game. 
---
Everything needs balance.
---
vituiks m√§n
---
It probably has something to do with POS code
---
Because null krabbing is piss easy, consistent and scales well. 
---
The more people run missions the less profitable it becomes for everyone. Krab holes are inconsistent because the sites take ages to respawn, there are a limited number of krab holes, it takes (relatively) a lot of work to set up with rollers and such and you're separated from the rest of your alliance. 
---
Null you just warp to an anom and shoot rats. That's it. Or put 2 rorqs in a belt and mine. Then 4 rorqs. Then 8 rorqs. Easy.
---
You are substituting to the definition of of a word for something else. 
---
Solo: for or done by one person alone; unaccompanied.
---
One person. Alone. 
---
If you are interpreting person to mean something else then that‚Äôs your interpretation.
---
&gt;Why stay in a null bloc
---
Top notch infrastructure to use.
---
It has been a few months since then though ;)
---
I really wouldn't consider Bold to be representative of Test. This is hardly the first time they've pseudo gone and 'do their own thing'. 
---
As for the super dropping, he does this with dreads too. I think it's hilarious. Late 2018 and earlier this year a Reddit pilot kept using a Revenant and chilling from GE, and people were having a ball, and totally fine with it. Not saying Bold isn't cringey at times, but this is largely a ruse cruise.
---
&gt; Not interpretation or redefinition... definition of solo: for or done by one person alone; unaccompanied.
---
You are accompanied, by yourself. This isn't hard. You bring more ships, you're not alone end of story. Being solo is an exclusive or thing. If you have more than one person then you aren't solo, if you have more than one ship you aren't solo. You are redefining what solo means to an inclusive or to include both of those things. The number of PEOPLE piloting each ship doesn't matter (in the case of multiboxing this is less than 1.) It is neither here nor there in the context of the game. Only the number of ships you bring to the fight actually matters. 
---
And lets pick one thread or the other to continue the discussion going back and forth across two over the same topic is just obnoxious.
---
This really made my day.  Bloodraiders set +10
---
Lol congrats chori
---
Cause a ship and fitting in your 0.0 station is 500mil but in jita its 400mil.  So you buy it all in Jita and ship it to your 0.0 station and pay the hauler 30 mil.  While you keep doing your thing out in 0.0
---
I don't think so, last test scanning hadn't been implemented yet, I'm sure it's planned though
---
its a problem of how to define content and "people to shoot" as well. I can have someone to shoot at anytime i want too, doesn't mean its particularly fun, and i guarantee you those sIgS and sQuAdS pringing 24/7 every 30 minutes aren't finding any content all that interesting. sigs and squads just means you're bashing shit with your closest 60 friends in feroxes instead of doing it on mainfleet with your closest 200 friends, apply the same to bomber ganks and munnins.
---
Its also telling how high he puts srp on the list, and says its nice to have "opportunities" to become more involved in the org of an "interesting" size, while calling small-mid sized orgs "cults of personality" and not what they really are, a group of people who share common goals. The author of that comment sounds like the exact prototype of the dudes yearning to be space important, probably is  an aspiring assistant to the junior diplo and watches sion's fanfest presentation every day before bed.
---
idk his entire comment and honestly the position of a lot of people here just sounds like they are newish to the game or pvp in general and never actually had an actual brawl with ships they really need to use somewhat correctly and dudes they can(and need to) actually rely on.
---
Titans get bubbled, ping goes off, mumble server crashes due to too many people coming on at once, will use YY next time. Very cool, very awesome.
---
And you fail to realize that OP wants to get rid of the "only one character per account at a time" thing as well.
---
Basically what Jester mentioned in his AMA post that got linked here.
---
&gt; "WXYZ" structure for EVE accounts: one player could have "W" character slots, "X" of which are being used, "Y" of which can train concurrently, and "Z" of which could be logged in concurrently. 
---
There are a lot of Pros and Cons to that idea obviously.
---
I never understood this approach to the game. For me the only factor that elevates this game above others is exactly the fact that the things i choose to do are tied to huge time investments and hard work. It¬¥s what gives your choices weight and creates a sense of risk and involvment unlike any other game. I want it to hurt if shit goes sideways. That¬¥s was whole point of the game for me because, let¬¥s be honest here, from a gameplay perspective eve isn¬¥t really a good game that¬¥s able to create engaging day-to-day gameplay by its mechanics alone.
---
Interesting to see how the perception on this has shifted over the years within the playerbase and reassuring to me that it was the right call to opt out when i did years ago.
---
this is exactly how sotiyos are supposed to be contested!
---
you can log in one character per account at any one time, so having 10 characters on 10 accounts lets you play all 10 at the same time. having all 10 characters on 1 account you can only play 1 at a time
---
Maybe after we get direct x19
---
Wouldn't mind that they have the coolest ships
---
Obviously you'd have to lift the login restrictions
---
1. Link the fit to your hauling alt  
---
2. On your alt, click link &amp; buy all.  
---
3. Move the bought ship, modules, rigs etc to your hauling ship.  
---
4. Fly the contents to their desto then contract it all to your main.  
---
Done.
---
Damn Volta with the good stuff again
---
I don't want to buy a new ship everytime i want to transport one of my ships...
---
hehe yeah i notice the hi-sec part, but mvd+cloak is the real tank
---
The excuse isn't that it would take a few months. The reason is that it'd tie up a team for that time, who could spend it doing something more productive.
---
Which would you prefer: Alliance bookmarks (now the more flexible shareable bookmarks), or the ability to log out to character select?
---
I said at the end that Mastodon is the tankiest highsec DST for that specific reason.
---
Character select
---
No use a bustard or occy. Mastodon is for speed
---
Your opinion. You are entitled to it. It is wrong, but you are entitled to it.
---
To add since you called me out. My em was high 80s thanks em and thermal highest I'm not stupid.
---
He didn't drop corp fast enough, shame.
---
It's been a thing since the new app released with skill queue management. Late August.
---
No idea what the upper limits on characters are. I've not run into it, but I don't run an insane number of accounts.
---
I suspect you may be part of a tiny minority there.
---
ya, I enjoyed it. I mostly stuck to ratting / combat sites, but very much had the core Eve gameplay feel nailed down. There were bugs and features missing but what they have is a great start. And it's great to be able to just log in for 10 minutes from any where and clear a site or kill a few guys, or even just travel somewhere.
---
For experience context: I tried Eve out for a couple months a few years ago and kinda of lost interest once I hit alpha cap and didn't think I had enough time to commit sitting at my computer to make omega worth it.
---
I'm not trying to be contrary, but I believe you are mistaken.
---
completely ignoring that basically every nullblob is doing that.
---
but are you unironically complaining about not getting ''gudfites'' when you guys use cynabals like this https://zkillboard.com/kill/80100968/ so basically a faster warping windrunner and expect horde to feed into you? 
---
i mean... dont get me wrong i dont want to defend horde but if you want good fights, you have to bring something that is somewhat engageable in the first place instead of this...
---
Oh goody another witty seeming but unnecessarily condescending troll who doesn't actually know what this is addressing
---
Someone pls explain
---
Trust me I'm not I literally just suffered from this shit literally the only thing I could have done better is even fucking more isk into tank or use a bustard or occy.
---
Time isn't an opinion; it's math.
---
wh ? but why ?
---
Isn't that the entire point of their Kalevala move?
---
you should have replied that to the guy above me...
---
Possibly. But consider this. It was requested years ago. There are more things that can be replaced there instead of bookmarks.
---
Citadels
---

PLEX overhaul

Would it lose to all of the above?
---
OK. I'm going to test with friends when I can to confirm, but I am surprised to hear this, because Cloak + MWD trick has never failed me, except when manually decloaked prior to MWD cycle finishing.
---
link it?
---
No, your opinion that the time was spent on better things is the opinion I'm bashing, but you do you mate.
---
Then I have no idea how you died to 4 Tornados considering that the max alpha for 4 ganknados is ~12k unless they are polarized.
---
Sorry, I failed to grasp the joke. Help me out here, though. He is wrong about being caught if the trick is performed correctly, right?
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

---
Yea no dedicated em and adaptive thank you em was highest resist. I know how these ganks work I've been through enough of them mostly from my own fault this one I'm a bit bitter about cuz it shouldn't have been possible.
---
well, not for those that only celebrate with shopping.
---
Null krabbing is just brain off wrp to Anom. For Lowsec you have to invest brain, like finding good LP-Shops, fight other buyers of tags with your buyorders, and make LP into ISK without screwing up.
---
Also it is much harder to scale up a L5 setup or L4-Burner-Setups to massive Multi-Accounting, like Droneboats in Anoms or Nullsec-Miners.
---
Yeah, gank Nado's work nice in any space because of the one shot alpha... Even in 0.5 space it's unlikely to get a second volly off with a nado on a gate since concord is normally already there. 
---
Also remember, I don't want to fly the nado back at the end of the night, so eventually I'll just blow up a hauler before I call it quits regardless of their value.
---
Can we just leave homophobia to 12 years old playing fortnite?
---
Your opinion has nothing to do with time.
---
So basically, Hilmar talked out of his ass the whole time.
---
you miss the carrier shame on you
---
Or you can join someone blue to horde, sit in horde stagings and farm the people coming to farm horde. It's pretty damn fun
---
Twice the ISK value of your cargo.
---
For sure, it's definitely a case of old systems meeting newer systems &amp; CCP never iterating on the old system. It's not a big issue (or in my opinion even AN issue), so I'm sure they have bigger fish to fry.
---
I would if I cared at all about eve. Does garst still run it and is he active?
---
‚ÄúWill there be microtransactions for EVE Echoes?
---
EVE Mobile will use the best practices from mobile game business models‚Äù
---
Best practices for what? Milking the money out of whales?
---
Because IF i'd manage to find a neut to haul in Nullsec my Corpmates would shoot him down pretty quickly. And noone in corp is doing short distance hauling.
---
Someone Playing a video game in a way that works for them, is not in anyway cheating, and that they find fun is some how a "cancer".

No sir. I'd submit that the cancer is you and everyone who thinks like you. No one is stopping you from doing what you want.

---
Nothing shifted, it was exactly like this when I started playing in 2007. It was probably like this from the very beginning. Most people who play or have ever played eve have been casuals, most players and people who try eve never leave high sec.
---
We like to think we are "normal" but we aren't. Those of us who engage more with the game are just nerdier nerds.

---
I was wondering that too but CCP is incompetent so probably just missed
---
Two years ago on a fanfest CCP said they would buff autocannon falloff by 10%.
---
I made apost with figures showing that this would be very small buff https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/64n29d/figures_to_show_how_much_10_increase_in/  
---
TL;DR: 1% DPS increase at 20 km range. Less than 3% DPS incrase at any meaningful range.
---
This buff never got in the game.
---
Now, two years later we finally get the autocannon buff.
---
&gt;All Medium Autocannons have had their Rate of Fire attribute increased by 3%, and their accuracy falloff attribute has been increased by 5%.
---
This may seem smaller than what was suggested two years ago but in reality this is bigger. The 3% rate of fire bonus alone is more than what 10% falloff bonus would have been. The 5% falloff bonus is completely meaningless.
---
Zerging, mass gank and bait/traps. Probably some suicide bombing and a lot of explorer hunting.
---
In 2019, korean don't grind that much anymore. I mean, sure, explo is the smart way to accumulate your first isk while being not too boring (at least teaches you D-Scan, visit some WH, and some risk factor).
---
I expect them to group in PC room with friends on friday night and do a lot of zerging PvP. 
---
Grindy MMO are dead here, it's all about the thrills you get hunting other players in PUBG these days, with some big baiting and surprise ganking involved. I would imagine the few who get hook to EVE will bring that mentality with them.
---
These "die hard PVPers" also fund their ships somehow? Most of them don't get SRP and they lose stuff every day, most of them grind for isk like everyone else does. And almost all of them started as a line member in that second group, just like you.
---
What pushed the game towards micro transactions is rorquals outclassing everything else in terms of mining. Supercaps outclassing everything else in terms of PVP and ratting. It pushed everyone into buying injectors for those things, buying more capital alts, buying more rorqual alts. Because without those things you get left in the dust. How many people in null have a dedicated FAX alt? And at least one titan alt? And a supercarrier alt? And 2-3 rorqual alts? All bought with injectors, all eating up PLEX. CCP is loving this meta mate.
---
&gt; It doesn't make sense to allow it in a freighter, because there is a specific freighter already dedicated to this.
---
Okay I dunno if you are misunderstanding, but *you can already do this*. What I am proposing is that ccp should either break double wrapping rigged ships(which allows you to throw them in a freighter) or just allow us to throw them in there without doing some buggy shit.
---
It is even more than that. Gotta teach the Bot how to find the anom the PvE bot is running then find the citadell they save on to warp back to the anom and have the bubble in line and after that you still need to teach it to adjust logoff times for the PvE bot restart timer. Certainly not impossible but it would take a good chunk of time I'd think.
---
Ok boomer
---
Yeah they definitely used tricky wording here to hide that fact.
---
Good choice
---
It's actually a carrier
---
This is really interesting, thank you very much! I wish more FCs would post detailed AARs, even for small skirmishes, it helps give context much better than just staring at zKill.
---
I curently run about 600 DPS with drones in my Gila. Can I do better?
---
And pleeeeeease ask some halfway style-skilled about new hairstyles. Not some basement-dwelling guy who thinks wearing his undies on his head is enough clothes for social interaction.
---
Do you not understand that being able to do something in a buggy, workaround way is not good game design?
---
Either fix double wrapping or allow us to put rigged ships in freighters.
---
DSTs and any other ship in the game (provided they have enough cargo space) can transport *packaged* ships, but not assembled ones. Presumably, OP wants to transport fitted ships without destroying their rigs, and has decided that the best way to do this is to put one or more of them into a freighter, which doesn't have an SMB, so he has to go through the courier process. I agree it's a weird design decision, but I imagine this has to be such a niche functionality, it only ever bothers a very small handful of people who I guess have to periodically relocate a small number of ships through HS (incursion runners I guess?)
---
Its almost like they need a product team that writes user stories for the development team instead of depending on the CSM to make business cases for shit.
---
20 years too late to be a boomer, sorry. Care to try for door number 3?
---
Luckily more and more people despise these forms of monetization and keep away from them. This is why the executives never name them. Microtransactions and lootboxes are like swear words now. I like this a lot.
---
Or they just gave us a dread that is basically a titan.
---
Take that to a different product - like MS excel - can you imagine if your user base voted something as the number #1 request and it was just rejected outright due to 3 months of work?

Your inherent need to use it as a label indicates that your statement was false and you apparently need to feel superior to some random guy on the internet... how little validation do you get in the real word mate?

you are a moron
---
- Give each of the career agents a shot
---
- Sometime early on, fly a cheap combat ship to lowsec or nullsec.  The longer you avoid it the scarier it will become.
---
- Join a corp fairly early on

I just want news feeds back on character select instead of having to rely on wishy-washy bots. That's it. That's all this concept was even for. Multiboxers hijacked the fuck out of it lol.

Came here to agree with this.  Update is garbage.  On dual ambit vaga, with 425s and triple gyro, i'm doing 423 DPS vs 410 and I get 2 more KM of range.  **GARBAGE BUFF**

Even though they had very short stints in TEST, I always found DnG's culture to be hilarious (to say nothing of the Ke$ha obsession).  They always seemed to like tweaking the noses of authority in a way that my inner troll could always appreciate.  o7

I‚Äôm in Horde because I‚Äôm casual as fuck. I can‚Äôt remember the last real Horde fleet I was a part of. I roam around and get in bad fights and sometimes I‚Äôll join standing fleet and camp a gate while I watch netflix and it‚Äôs nice to have space to rat in if I feel like it. I couldn‚Äôt give two shits about anything higher up in importance than that, I just don‚Äôt have the time for it. I‚Äôm old and have a life.

&gt;Will there be microtransactions for EVE Echoes?
---
&gt;EVE Mobile will use the best practices from mobile game business models.

That's a yes.

I wonder if CCP also forgot to give it 5x penalty to Entosis cycle time
---
Thanks bro!
---
the liar's paradox
---
How is this the 1st time I'm hearing about this?
---
You're arguing for both sides? What if you just charged $15 per 3 omega characters?
---
Maybe it reaches dread DPS once fully spooled up five minutes later? And at the meantime it¬¥s a weaker dread that can receive support from other ships
---
Boss makes a dollar, I make a dime, that‚Äôs why I poop on company time :)

In cheap ships, there is no reason to run away. Maybe just one.. more... shot

Mind = Blown
---
Wow wingspan still exists!
---
I agree with him.  Provi blobs hard.  He isn't wrong.  It has been my experience as well.  You guys will sit around for 30mins forming a fleet way larger than ours like clockwork.  This has been the case for years.
---
YouPorn, you saw him on YouPorn.
---
That was probably Garmon/El‚Äôtar
---
I wouldn't worry about *speed* in the slightest. Fit for align-time and tank. If you're going to be cloak-tricking, align-time is much more valuable.
---
While an entirely logical and good idea, I do not think it would stand up to the player base. You'd just end up with a bigger doughnut. 
---
I would really be interested to see how T2 vs. T3 production happens and the constituent hierarchies involved behind it. While scarcity and depletion are sort of a temporary bandage that *will* be gamed eventually, how would a more fundamental change to industry and logistics affect 'empire building'? 
---
At this point, you can't even hit 'Reset' on EVE without the blank slate being repopulated by the same entities from before instantly. This seems like the crux of the 'shake up' Hilmar is getting at.

Are base sales tax 5% and broker's fees 0.5% in NPC stations in EvE?
---
I am trying to make my brain farm as efficient as possible so to reduce these two expenses I need to know Accounting skill and Broker Relations. It seems that the tool tip for Broker Relations is broken, saying that the fee is a base 5% (not the 0.5% that I seem to be paying)
---
Is this a typo or am I not understanding something.
---
Also any tips on other ways to make my brain farm more profitable are welcome :). My training clone has +5 int and +5 Memory implants and is remaped 32int/26mem. I am only training Int/Mem skills and selling them.
---
Vily will find a way. He always.

They said as with everything Triglavian, "massively  OP." So probably not needed

---
NCPL had, at the time, a roughly equal number of combat fit supers/titans as the imperium. If legacy supercaps joined with us, the rest of eve's combined active supercaps would be outnumbered by us.
---
They're not worth killing and will spawn some drifter battleships that wil oneshot you once you break part of their defences.
---
This reminds me alot of Fweddit, except they don't speak English.

Why do they speak in Trigalvian ?

sure, did they have the same economic backbone to cope with the losses though? nah. so why bother fighting you? that¬¥s what your style of gameplay is all about, no? building the biggest, most potent and unengageable pixel sandcastle in a world of utterly meaningless pixel sandcastles. good job. you did it. now what?
---
Yea, but i only know how to calculate the margin, as an alpha and only level 2 broker relations how do i know what is the minimum margin to make a profit

The bpcs are not a problem, although copying bpos would be easier and produce better copies.

---
No, however, there is no way to implement what you are proposing. You seem to be wholly incapable of grasping just how flawed your proposal is.
---
Better yet, us the same 2FA for all of your accounts as was suggested, that solves your problem.
---
*Edit
---
You also failed to address my question in previous reply.
---
I did something similar once. Was hauling compressed Kernite around at a moment that was profitable and got bump locked back when that was a thing. Bumper Convos me asking for 125m to let me go. 
---
Me: Look, this load and ship are barely worth that to me. (A lie, but not a huge one, the Kernite load was worth about 600m in Jita if I remember right.) And if you had help coming I'd be dead by now anyway. So you let me go and I'll pay you 25m after.
---
Bumper kicks around for about 15m, trying to get me to up my price but I stand firm and insist on paying only after being let go. I was right, they had a little backup. So they cut me loose, I get to Jita, and likely to their surprise cut them a transfer for 25m. I want to encourage nice habits after all.
