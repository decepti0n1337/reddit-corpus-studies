&gt;Why should they exist at all?

---
Just so we don't rehash everything, this thread has many good reasons.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ahfidn/if\_killmails\_and\_killboards\_ceased\_to\_exist\_would/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ahfidn/if_killmails_and_killboards_ceased_to_exist_would/)

---
No it’s not, the most regarded is sov mechanics.
---
I haven't really looked for rorqs, the only ones I have been on grid with since the blackout were a couple we were killing in frt standing. I know people won't be using rorqs much but when it comes down to it however a rorqs yield drops by 50% when you use those miner 2s. My point is that most of the major methods people use to mess with excavators can be dealt with by a few T3Ds or other similar pvp ships on grid so paying people to protect your drones might be better then using miner 2s.
---
In all fairness if you want a true controlled comparison you’d want to look at an average pre drifters days and times
---
Why do we only rely on zKillboard? CCP should provide an official game killboard that automatically posts losses.
---
God damnit. Now I have to check my testicles for lumps.
---
In a wormhole, you can crit your two statics which makes them dead avenues of attack, or people can roll their static into you. People can also roll statics into nullsec, with the bonus of they don't even have to hit the system you are in, because as you said there are static maps, so if they land close they can cross normal space to go gank you. So in null you have to worry about wormholes many systems away from you instead of only wormholes in the system you are currently ratting in.
---
I don't know yet. On one hand, it has its advantages, on the other it kinda makes EvE feel lonelier. 
---
In the end, from what I have seen this weekend so far it does not fundamentally change things in any way. If you belong to a big power block, then your life continues just as usual.
---
They are gonna revert this next week I bet. Too many krabs are salty on forums.
---
Great attitude. Love it when you guys come to Eso aswell and take fights no matter. Wish more would do it like that, no pretense, no bs just fun.
---
People throw money at new players. All u have to do is show interest and the will to become a vet!
---
No u
---
Ez. Don’t undock
---
Nah, bombers kill them before they even get back,  rocks are big.
---
Play with a group so they can kill the guys that want to destroy you.
---
Good write up more informative than mine to say the least.
---
Yo should ask on tinder
---
razor live in tenerifis as part of the FIRE coalition,  
---
Intepid crossing is Test renters.
---
Was meh 5 years ago for me lol
---
Goons feed much harder then test and frat, we look at 80 hac losses and think it's a loss, they look at it as a light day.
---
Noones stopping anyone from buying the same service?
---
But to whom? Unguarded panfam structures?
---
the same as always...me as a crab not engaging in farming (yes, I'm too pussy for losing ships credited to some m-f\*\*\*\* suprise we're you are always at the loosing side except from wh-ratting and too lazy for doing D-Scan every 10 sec) and so I keep waiting for pings either to kill shit or  to save shit as logi...
---
I predict significantly less supers and rorquals - with or without bots. There will be probably same amount of ships died as in average, however I guess it will be significantly more expensive overall.
---
One way to do it (if you’re not webbed down baldy) is to slingshot them. This only works if they’re orbiting you. 
---
What you do it align to a point, and let them turn towards you. 
---
When they reach the middle of their orbit (both of you should be facing the same direction) align to a point directly behind you. 
---
They should (if they don’t adjust quickly enough) be slingshotted rapidly away from you. As soon as they’re out of their point range you should warp.
---
This normally works even if they’re much faster than you. However if you’re too slow yourself they won’t get slingshotted far enough away. 
---
This works with webs and scrams if you’re going fast enough.
---
If you’re faster than the other ship just burn out of their range.
---
When you try to get out of a point you should overheat your prop mod (afterburner / microwarp drive).
---
I think Sister Bliss and Pandoralica should be on this list too.
---
So?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Maybe Jita should die.
---
And fun fact, the vast majority of production still takes place in HS....because its safe to stash the billions in materials you need to mass produce. If you think NS production isn't heavily tied to Jita market, you are delusional.
---
Patch Notes:  
---
  New mouse action to switch out to the last used non-EVE application. Hold Control + Shift keys and click any thumbnail to switch out from EVE to a browser, text editor etc
---
  Client Layouts now are stored and properly applied for maximized EVE client windows as well
---
  Alternate thumbnail render (to be used with some Remote Desktop apps that doesn't transfer thumbnail images)
---
  Improved support for multi-display systems where each display has different DPI set
---
  Improvements in the thumbnail opacity management (stability and performance)
---
  So unless some of those fixes / improvements are ones you are after then it boils down to the mouse action to let you swap from Eve back to your most recently used non-Eve app. Be it browser, Discord, whatever.
---
You can just put your response fleet on grid in subcaps that are good at killing bombers, svipuls for example. Bombers decloak, you nuke one with arties and launch defenders to kill as many of the rest of the bombs as you can.
---
I think Laz is better than travis, but that's just me.
---
1. neut him until he has no cap to use scram
---
2. ecm him
---
3. kill him
---
4. warp core stab and pretend he did not exist &lt;&lt; not recommended
---
5. never undock
---
the numbers don't end up for Esoteria...there are 4 times more loses by TAPI and the same amount of loses for anyone else looking for trouble.
---
The problem with using launchpads for everything is the greater powergrid and CPU. Using a storage as a mid for the material to be routed to factories saves CPU for more factories.
---
Nah man. I am never critical of anyone elses setup. If it works for you then good on you.
---
Your net worth is disgusting
---
Fuck that shit, Zkillboard should still be a thing. I want to be able to look back on all the fun I had in the past and remember all those great times I had with corp mates and stuff. Can't do that without zkillboard. Please leave Zkillboard alive, although I would be fine with a delay.
---
Ok if we're going with ships...
---
BISMARCK!
---
Exactly where drifter hordes are.
---
well actually you can reinforce and then kill the jb , because its not safe, and citdels don't gun themselves so go ahead and shoot them
---
How can I play on group?
---
It’s the law of reddit, my friend, you have to love it, otherwise you get downvoted
---
Not in the last hour, there aren't (according to both the ingame map and the esi endpoint).
---
Hahahaha sure thing
---
Well usually when lists are made the smaller the number the more important the item is. In this case Laz is #9, and Travis is #15.
---
I know lists are difficult to read, so this is a free lesson.
---
I'd say fewer kills.
---
Is the status quo and basically dead game a good "point of view"? You have had this info publicly available for 16 years. What compromises are you willing to make?
---
What is a scram? Sorry, i don't know too much
---
Warp scrambler.
---
Haha null is dead when you fly around. Have run into nothing, so go to delve get super blobbed. Great idea blackout
---
Then we can move ahead and remove the ability to activate any modules to fight back at all if youre in a big alliance, because after all in nullsec being in an alliance shouldnt make you safe. whilst we are at it add a new ship just for hunters that warps you directly to the nearest ratting or mining ship and instantly stops them warping off or firing back because the nullsec should be dangerous
---
They are easily manned. And structure bashing isn’t PvP. It might generate PvP but on grid with a citadel makes it bad. 
---
I get the feeling you wouldn’t like losing your jump bridge network. High sec is where space is ‘safe’
---
krab fever will return shortly, fear not.
---
Fewer kills. People rnt coming out in nullsec. Amd nullsec players rnt undocking....go figure
---
I think it’s going to show pvp activity across nullsec has fallen off a cliff.
---
What is the difference?
---
Project Discovery makes that 6 things. :)
---
Well I could add 16 and 17 just for them I guess, but neither of them were as good or as influential as any of the 15 I listed.
---
more points of disruption, and you can't use a mwd/mjd.
---
Now if we can just get the Chinese out of ProGodLegend's ass. Seriously he thinks bringing them from Serenity to TQ is a good thing? Look at Serenity in it's shambled dead server mess and see if you want TQ to become that. I would be happier if he went to Serenity and kept them there.
---
start looking for corps in game, or join something like the public spectre fleet and go out.
---
nah. he's just new.
---
Does anyone have the Gif for rogue drones? It says something like "only you can prevent rogue drone hives".
---
What are those?  *I'M NEWBIE*
---
Just read uniwiki, dude.
---
I hope they add observatories to wormhole space as well, we can give you t2 mining in trade, since you think it missing from wspace isn't fair.
---
What are the fleets for?
---
You keep your fucking moon goo.
---
What is this heresy? Where is our Lord and savior Seddow?
---
Yeah here let me just contact this random FC who i have no clue exists about some massive fight somewhere I do not even know about. BRB.
---
to go out and kill things.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/adbyho/new_spectre_discord/
---
Must be an irrelevant since he isn't on the list.
---
they are propulsion modules, mid slot items.
---
MWD is "go fast" but can be turned off with warp scramblers 
---
MJD is "spool up and jump 100km" but can also be turned off with warp scramblers
---
regular warp disruptors can't turn off either.
---
What are you talking about. 
---
Big alliances used to Titan bridge fleets if they needed to move quickly. They burnt a cyno and lit it. Big alliances could and would still do this. If you can’t see why jump bridges are bad you are part of the problem. Gates connect systems and traffic on gates creates content. Jump bridges bypasses this and as you can’t camp a jump bridge without being on grid with a citadel they should be reworked or better yet removed.
---
Good job man.
---
Not seeing a lot of strong arguments there. It seems some players mostly want it because they benefit from it. Certainly raises a bunch of questions. Is it reasonable that you should be able to check someone's fits? Why are players forced to have a profile if they have no API key?
---
Go back to warframe.
---
Oh thanks!
---
Had values drop on a few things in the last few days
---
Feels bad man.
---
And other players can attack me with both disruptors and scramblers?
---
Holding more than one constellation of sov then disables cynos and low slot modules.
---
No, we need fatigueless jump gates so we can get to the war front, which is really far away.
---
Thig is a godlike dota player nowadays :C
---
33 billion?
---
You want another 6 million?
---
I mean why not have observatories, the lore reason for local originally was gate beacons, but if we as players are taking over the tracking with a structure that does it for us means it could easily be added to wspace.
---
disgustingly low
---
https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004925705-Warp-Scrambling-and-Warp-Disruption
---
I'm sure that we'll sit and wait the days, weeks, or possibly months before the covert cyno ship reveals itself and becomes active.
---
Do you even play this game?
---
Yeah, but we dont *want* to add them. DED be damned they have no legal authority over JSpace.
---
No, it would be very, very bad. That's the last rubicon. There would be no going back.
---
110100100 1000101
---
Pray I don't alter it any further.
---
Havent talked with him years and years, glad to hear he is still kickin shit and taken names, and glad he isn't in EVE....whenever I was in fleet and his name was on grid I knew we were going to die. The guy was a master, no one can touch him, he just had the knack.
---
\&gt; I think Laz is better than travis, but that's just me. 
---
And also OP's opinion as well
---
Nah, the trade war is to fuck with highsec.
---
They still do use Titan bridges. And those very same Titan bridges can still drop a fleet on your face and kill all your beautiful roaming ships. You're in their space, you play by their rules. I hear lowsec has plenty of content and no jumpgates, maybe try there.
---
Be less salty. Be more smarter. Always have a way out or fly something you can afford to lose.
---
Yeah as the saying goes ‘a talented man is talented in everything’. Dunno why but many russian influencers of the past now play dota 24/7 *rolls eyes*
---
it'll be back at 1100 UTC Monday
---
Same, and also 'Jersey Walls' aka 'J walls'
---
Attackers can now hide in local and now you want to take away the defenders jb network? No.
---
You think bots put their APIs on zKill?
---
Same, it's not that different.
---
Where’s your stream been? CHEERZAH!!!
---
Pred Elite but no Thelastsparton :thinky:
---
wait, Test is in Panfam?
---
i don't think he's disagreeing with that, at least not in regard to said pov.
---
DOTA can keep them then, when the "good" Russians played this game, they really sucked to play against...mostly because they would kick your ass into your mouth and all you could taste was shit.
---
Be nice.  He turned to Reddit for questions.  Just link the relevant Eve Uni article and give him nice pats on the head.
---
Less time in space, more risk you will be caught when you are. The risk balances out.
---
That's the point of standing fleet. 
---
Do you even play this game? Oh no I forgot I'm replying to querns who just plays reddit.
---
Sometimes they do.
---
Ah, goons. Never change.
---
You can make your own list if you want.
---
Hurrdurr Eve is only about PVP, if someone is trying to do something productive and wants to make their own ships instead of buying them with IRL then they are playing the game wrong.
---
That's what all of you l33t pvpers sound like right now.
---
yes
---
when you are tackled, you either win or die. 
---
it is the same for the smallest and the largest ships :)
---
DED has no authority over nullsec either that is the point, these aren't DED structures.
---
Generally, I just keep a sticky note of important systems, and use the auto navigation to plot long jumps trips for me. Its worked well enough so far, and generally hasnt cost me anything in hi-sec systems.
---
You can self-destruct and end up back at home station. You'll obviously leave behind/lose your ship and any implants you had installed on that character at that time tho.
---
Well they kinda do actually. Managing rating of DED sites, gates, fueling routers...
---
It's like the federal government in rural North Dakota. They have a *little* authority but really not too much.
---
What alliance are you apart of?
---
They would not need a black out if they gave us a way to scan down a cloak that is the reall fix. Make it a station add on that takes a hour or somthing
---
CCP Fozzie proposed some new [Implants](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/summer-2019-new-pirate-implant-sets/149867)! Are they allready ingame? Not on active duty atm.
---
Is that new [Slave-Set](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/eveonline/original/3X/1/9/19365bd538b4a0356cbe4afb2bd4f75edc7fba6a.png) seriously going to boost shieldpoints by 54%... wtf thats a lot!
---
Needs a 0 on it
---
Standing fleet can't prevent the bombers from doing their job, just kill them after the fact. Maybe. It's almost like covert cloaks are strong for the kind of hit and run tactics that are used to kill excavators.
---
I don't know what you're trying to argue. Recons are a small fraction of the overall t2 market. Technetium is a small fraction of the build cost of a recon. Technetium also goes into nanotransistors, which is a component in all t2 ships. So the recon price spike has nothing to do with a fundamental r32 like technetium going wild. Ferrogel is also trending upwards, and Fermionic has spiked quite a bit. Both of those are racial-agnostic
---
I expect CCP will crunch the Key Performance indicators as soon as they have useful data and look at their other metrics very closely. 
---
Independent of the court of popular opinion on the forums and Reddit, the numbers will tell a story that CCP will be reading. 
---
I have my guesses of which way the data will go, but I expect we will never see the real numbers.
---
Beep beep boop I am very human look at my human pod beep boop
---
Lol it’s not worth buying right now.
---
I dont think tethered Rorquals count as mining.
---
Had two NS holes on our chain, roamed one and realized the area was likely stronger in other timezone, so went to the other one, and happily found a nice fight within a few jumps. 
---
You are full of shit.
---
Hard pass, they turned off a chat channel they didn’t let us creampie their ass
---
\+1 for killmail and other ESI delays.
---
jesus i was looking for his full name and skipped right over it.
---
There should be a system for destroying Stargates. It shouldn't be easy, it should take a lot of time and effort, but there is too much space. If there was less space, there wouldn't be so many buffer regions and people would be forced into conflict. It would probably cause lots of fights too. Some people would roleplay sov defender and some would go for the burn it all style. Of course there would have to be limits, you don't want all of it gone. The game just needs more things worth fighting over.
---
Covert Cloaks don't stop you from killing their hunter on the way into the region. You guys already have a autism camp when I last went through there. Your able to kill cover ops ships before they get through m8 I've done it plenty of times. 
---
If you kill their hunter they can't get through and if they do standing responds to deal with them when they go for someone thing.
---
No worries friendo.
---
Ummmmm....sorry gotta say something. Null does NOT mean zero. It is defined as "empty or devoid of".
---
True very true
---
Excuse you but it can mean both.
---
I can say with near 100% certainty that your last statement is just false - every kill on Zkill has had one party or the other agree to it being present - don't forget that when you die the following parties get access to the kill - the victim, the killer, the corp of the victim, the corp of the kill, anyone else who is linked the kill in chat or eve-mail - anyone with the right appointed permissions in the corp can then view said kill (or maybe even the whole corp, I am not too sure on that part) and subsequently submit the information to a killboard, the ESI simply cuts out the middleman, but if I kill you, whether you want the kill there or not is irrelevant, because as the killer I can post it.
---
Point is they have and always will exist in one form or another, and it is more than just the victim who get the right to choose whether a kill is shared or not.
---
The thought was people seeing a market booming so they stock up on the required components to build for that market and thus the price of said components increases. Im not trying to argue that alone caused this i was trying to argue that theres more recent factors that could have played into this than goons.
---
I know you! LOL  Murder all robots!
---
&gt; "Most are just going to stop playing."
---
Bye bye, don't let the door hit you in the ass. :-)
---
They do...but even though FCs back in 2006 screeched about talking in local....we still showed up.
---
Don't let the PLEX replace your yearly hooker fund.
---
Raitaru &gt; Pos because docking but you might want to drop a pos before hand and bring in rollers to keep the hole shut until it's anchored.
---
A better idea would be a C2 with a HS or Lowsec static and a C3 static for krabbing. You could always roll for new holes to farm in and always have a kspace.
---
What is "using a blue covert cyno to blops in?" for 500 Alex?
---
10 minutes of single module gameplay isn't a good story. Its a pretty good video all things considered yes, but the munnin pov is just boring as sin
---
I think one to two days is a bit much but a data a few hours old (like ESI releasing average pilots in space four hours ago) would provide some general info to hunters but would be old enough that it didn't give you precise intel. Similarly, CCP could distribute killmails in a batch every few hours to the involved pilots for mails older than an hour.
---
I'm loving the blackout so far. Please CCP, let it stay for a long wile at least!
---
Cmon, show us the screenshot of COMPLETE transaction.
---
Please add to Lowsec as well
---
IIRC It's only blacked out til tomorrow or something, then Squizz was talking about a possible delay.
---
Who said anything about the hunter being the one to light the covert cyno? You use a bricked T3C just to get past the camp, then hide it somewhere and use it to bridge in hunters, bombers, whatever. It's completely unstoppable barring a fuck-up on the part of the pilot in question. Covert cynos exist. Covert bridges exist. Interdiction nullification exists.
---
And, again, standing fleets can't respond fast enough to prevent excavator death. It's not mechanically possible. Decloak, lock, shoot volley. Excavators dead. Even if you catch the bombers, the damage is already done. Bombers are so cheap that it's worth throwing away dozens of them just to kill a single drone.
---
This doesn't even take into account just bombing the excavators, which is even easier. Yes, defender missiles exist, but have fun maintaining laser focus waiting for a 12 second window over literal hours.
---
Fuck off and break local
---
#looks at bank account
---
LOL 33T just another poor casual looking for upvotes.
---
(honestly though....good shit )
---
Correction: There is zero counterplay that someone in a rorqual can do to stop someone that is willing to use 5 bombers to wipe an excavator squadron. Wait for them to get on a big spod, launch. All 5 die - if he is afk or not.
---
&gt; How many NPCs killed How many jumps being made Where cynos are lit
---
I disagree that it should be completely removed. Giving potential hostile groups a chance to see in a very general way where they might be able to get a fight is a good thing. Then the groups can send scouts in to gather specific intel. If you get rid of it completely, it's like two gangs call for a rumble somewhere in Central park but there's a nlackout and they keep walking into trees, falling in streams, and stepping in dig shit while never finding each other.
---
Then you use standings to fight what comes through and boot the blue covert cyno.
---
I am perfectly capable of buying 500$ worth of plex but only in my dreams
---
i appreciate the advice :)
---
i’ve heard C2s are very sought after and would likely result in a contest of sorts with lots of PvP, likely before i even anchor a POS. is this still the case?
---
You aren't required to mine with excavators my dude. You either rat with someone standing can get to in time or mine with t2 mining drones cause you don't want to focus on losing them.
---
This is false. 12 s leaves enough reaction time even for big rocks and there are tons of mechanical counterplays. But when the krabs are expected to innovate and adapt they always perform worse than hunters.
---
What did you do with Hilmar ...?
---
I mean the main C2's That I would call sought after are C2 NS/C5 or C2 NS/C6 because it's really good for groups who love to roam.
---
Outside of that you shouldn't have much of a issue unless you leave stuff unfueled or make a group mad enough to evict you.
---
This is on tq. It is accessed via LP things from killing trigs.
---
Uh, yes, and that's what we are doing. And that's fine. It doesn't change the fact that covert cynos are extremely powerful with no local. My only issue is anyone pretending like they aren't, or pretending like there is counterplay.
---
&gt;I can say with near 100% certainty that your last statement is just false - every kill on Zkill has had one party or the other agree to it being present
---
It is not necessary to create the profile of the player who hasnt provided an api key. If you get a kill, you could still have it on your profile. But zkb wont allow it. Every player is searchable.
---
&gt;whether you want the kill there or not is irrelevant, because as the killer I can post it.
---
People can play 24/7 for weeks (or so it is claimed), but a bot can automate it for you. Is the automation an advantage?
---
Boot it from what? It cynos in dudes at a deep safe. There is no way to know who did it. He's not talking about blue tackle. Jesus, dude. Play the damn game.
---
Lol people actually think this is an experiment. If it's connected to lore, it stays.
---
I see :) that makes sense :)
---
so a C2 with a LS or HS and a C3 would be most preferable right?
---
I miss zkills, not just for Intel, but to see my kills. I can wait for zkills to come back on Monday and see some of the shit that went down!!
---
I believe that if you are the final blow on someone, it will show on Zkill, regardless of if that someone is on Zkill. The person who makes the kill needs to be registered or the one who dies, not both.
---
I feel this strange urge to send isk
---
um we were not the ones responsible for not paying the sov bill in B-R you dumbass.  PL forced us to give them that sov so that they could control it, that was all on them.
---
Oh I'm not going to pretend they aren't strong. Just that there are ways to deal with it not that most of them are optimal but being a defender is really optimal in the first place.
---
Unless your getting dropped by 200 bombers there is counter play I suffered from it last night.
---
Induced a midlife crisis.
---
The redistribution of Moon Goo was the catalyst for the Fountain war....because Fountain happened to score the haul on moongoo via its moon count. Had nothing to do with Tribal, had nothing to do with Montolio. Was all about keeping that passive isk machine rolling.  
---
As for TEST nearly dying....you high? They were never anywhere close to dying....I farmed them for like 6 months in Aridia, and after enough time they would easily put together 200+ fleets to come shit on our 20 man groups. 
---
I fucking hate revisionist history...so I leave with this. Fuck you. TEST is shit and fun to meme on, but fuck me your anecdotal comment is garbage.
---
Report his fuckin name, the system, all the shit
---
i would have pred higher than he is, good fc and an awsome bloke once you get to know him and to me hes also a good friend.
---
id also add kendarr to this list when i was in goons and SV i woulda run through a brick wall if he asked
---
i wonder if there could be a bonus for the attacker if the shield or armour timer is uncontested. to try and make a quick form defence of those early timers important.
---
Stabs don't cause problems for the dual web Coercer fit that I've seen a few people using recently.
---
&gt; Now if we can just get the Chinese out of ProGodLegend's ass. Seriously he thinks bringing them from Serenity to TQ is a good thing?
---
You are reading too much reddit my friend. This not how things happened and you are giving pgl too much power.
---
When you define "deal with it" as "kill the bomber," then sure. That's not "dealing with it." To "deal with it" would be to prevent the defender's loss from occurring in the first place. Players with even a smidgen of strategic planning capacity can guarantee an excavator kill, regardless of any action taken by the defenders. This is with tolerance for human error on the part of the aggressor. Significant tolerance.
---
Good meme but it was the Moon Goo redistribution that sent TEST and CFC to war.
---
Mentions blue spy so where else would you boot it from? I mean if you go to your corp and see X member is always sitting in a bomber in X system and never moves never gets any kills in one yet blues keep getting dropped by cov ops It's safe to assume he's a spy.
---
There are ways to do it but it requires monitoring your corp. That same shit is how we caught the last spy that bridged a fleet on me.
---
That it is old friend, can't wait for Andrews second book tbh.
---
You caught an idiot.
---
It's always worth buying Plex unless you want the game to cease its existence.
---
people were spending all their time krabbing to earn their next injector or pay for their next plex. now they still have their accounts subbed but they cant pve, because fear.
---
if the blackout continues (please BOB) eventually they will run out of isk to plex and start krabbing again, decide the game is actually fun pvping and leave the krab lifestyle permanently, or CCP will lose a customer.
---
If you show us a purchase receipt, I'd be more likely to think you cared.
---
Sad thing is there's a lot more broken shit that CCP is to blame for, that he should be focusing on instead WCS.
---
Do you have anywhere we could hear and watch some of those awesome fcs in action? Are most of them active or inactive?
---
Oh fuck off.

Its not like anyone on TQ is going to go to war. CCP created the cesspit by giving every nullsec region everything they would need to suffice.

Serenity died because a couple groups controlled everything...guess what TQ is dying because a couple groups control everything.

I swear Hilmar is on a 2-4yr delay for getting information. When he came on Twitch a couple months ago and told everyone that they would be focusing on recruiting new pilots from Steam, I almost died laughing.
---
Steam is NOT where you find dedicated (plays the same game everyday) pilots. Hilmar is clueless either by absence or someone giving him BS intel.

Here's a thought for nullsec alliances, how about you just delete intel channels, since they are setup by alliances no?

No I mean web. A few guys who I know have talked about trying this out. It seems to have gotten some good results.
---
And low should be either all heat sinks or a single DC. Basically, the idea is that you sit right at the warp-in point for the plex, immediately fire your overheated pulse lasers and web the guy to make him easier to hit. Against basically anything which can fit into a small besides assault frigates, there's a kill pretty much immediately. And if the Coercer is the one which survives, it's in hull and should probably warp off to repair..
---
You are just a stupid piece of shit.
---
Get fucked with your fuckin input, you fuckin shitter

Why would i include him. He came to relevance in a period of "peace" and has literally done nothing since. His first major campaign was WWB and at his discretion the CFC abandoned their space.
---
Is there an actual campaign hes has ever led? No.
---
So ya. Asher is irrelevant in the history of EVE.
---
people would use destroy-able gates to create pockets of pve systems. even if ansiblex gates were open for all.
---
the only way i could see it working would be if destroying any gate destroyed all gates in that system and turned the system into a WH. simultaneously the adjacent systems would gain gates to replicate the original connections. so for example you couldnt disconnect a whole region by destroying the entry system's gate.
---
in this system building gates to WH would add them to known space as the counter to destroying gates.
---
Seems like someone got first hand experience now

Seeing what happened with Drifters , fitting a Warp Core Stab will cause Drifters to personally come to your home and beat you into submission before forcefully biomassing your character.

How exactly will you know who the blue covert cyno is.. when you light it off a grid, not in a fleet with "blues" and the whole fleet bridges to you past your gate camp and then goes about normal business?

lol I will, should i put it on auto so you can follow?

Thats what a singular keystroke looks like when you spam it.

Anchoring the POS shouldn't cause you any issues since it takes 15 mins. The raitaru might get contested during the vulnerability timers (when deployed and then 24 hours after), but it's probably not going to be contested.

Here's a wormhole eviction survival guide (has some tips about how to not get evicted):
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/8yye3r/wormhole_eviction_survival_guide_for_beginners/
---
The best way to protect yourself against an eviction is to not look to be worth evicting. A single fueled structure shows that you are a small active corp that probably doesn't have too many assets, so it really wouldn't be worth evicting you. 
---
The worst you can do is to leave it unfueled. If I see an unfueled structure, I would probably solo evict the structure (using 3-4 alts) since I often get multiple 100s of mil in loot.
---
Most replies are inaccurate on the actual value of that hull. The ship is practically the unicorn hull of Eve. It is pretty much untouchable in the hands of a skilled pilot. Additionally there are only \~40 left in the game making it extremely rare and valuable. The price of that hull comes down to the last \~40 owners and what they decide it to be. So think about that, to obtain one is a major undertaking let alone the amount of isk. Last I checked I saw someone selling an Imp for \~600b on the eve forums. To top it all off, the fit is max blinged for obvious reasons so that adds significant value on top of an already expensive hull.
---
The drifters are fascinating. Here's a link so you can read up a condensed very well written piece on them.

Assuming a perfect reaction time of 0.01 seconds and all of the drones are on the closest side of the rock- yes they might survive. If your reaction time is longer than 1 full second OR they are on the other side of a 40k+ unit spod rock, they die. There is zero counterplay that rorqual can do aside from what, use 10 dudes with defender launchers?
---
I can do it. You can do it. We can guarantee they die. That means people won't use them. That's fun and dynamic.
---
What about barges or exhumers? Oh cool, there aren't 10+ people online? Guess I'll play another game?

That's the answer.

&gt;  I started in fade then went to &gt; deklein &gt; branch &gt; tenal &gt; cobalt edge &gt; Oasa &gt; the spire &gt; insmother &gt; detorid. I spotted a grand total of 4 supers pos'd up, 1 cloaky prospect, 4 pos'd/tethered VNI's and a rorq fleet using miner I's and II's. 9 regions, more than 100 jumps from start to where I finished as a result of checking all the pockets I passed for anything I could try and shoot at and nothing. 
---
sure you did buddy, sure you did
---
Supes haven’t cost 20b in quite some time...
---
And either way, this leads to the question: Why not just farm in w-space, then? If the ratios are so out of whack, why not change what you’re doing?
---
You don’t even have to be that drastic, either: subcap ratting is perfectly viable, and a lot less risky.
---
That's cool, I didn't know! Wouldn't dual-scram (or even triple scram) work better though? Or I'm guessing dual-web might be better when you're fighting someone who wants to fight.
---
Of course there is a chance to lose your ship! This :clap: is :clap: fucking :clap: Eve :clap: !
---
If you want to grind in perfect peace, go play Runescape! There should always be an element of danger.
---
I have to agree with this, I'm not even sure if WCS is even an issue for other than those few people who miss a killmail or two due to them in low sec.
---
I only bought one of those this year, I might buy another not sure yet.
---
I used to buy one of those $499.99 every single month until (1) Alphas aka "screw you long time Omegas"; and (2) Captain's Quarters disappeared (I dropped almost $10k so far in Star Citizen to reclaim the walk-around ability, worth every penny). I need that, so I pay for it.
---
Sometimes the 15,400 Plex were on sale. The 25% off ones were the most appreciated. I would buy 2 or 3 of those during the sale. I never bought from a 3rd party (like MarqueeDragon), I always bought directly from CCP website.
---
I still loyally spend almost $2,000/yr in subs. Yes, I could PLEX my account with ISK but free Alphas do NOT pay CCP's bills, I'm not stupid. I almost cut my subs in half this year then Null Blackout happened, lol. LOVE IT! I'll cut them if/when it ends.
---
I was very sceptical, but I really like it so far. I do wish CCP would have a look at killmails. Anything to stop people from getting free intel from them.
---
Okay wtf is this ratchet zkill?
---
opsec and brave mix like oil and water.
---
You ran into the tri WCS ishtar in ns yet?
---
The pvp players that are bitter vets arent killing anything but other pvp players. They're all having fun, good luck
---
The story was in the comms and many other small details. You piece it all into one thing and you get something better.
---
Maybe?  Or maybe CCP needs to make the area in a lowsec site a 200km bubble that the gate shoots you into.
---
This is propaganda.
---
To be fair, he's been getting fed BS intel for years.  
---
One of the funniest looks of shock I've seen from him was a few years back at a Fanfest speech (long after the 'Summer of Rage', as I recall), and he asked the room if they should 'open the door'... There was a resounding 'yes', with maybe a dozen 'noes'. The look on that face was priceless. Clearly his intel had told him to expect the opposite.  
---
(Personally, when it comes to WiS, I hold Torvi to blame for a lot of it - but CCP in general, for their hubris in thinking they could actually pull it off with their new tech, instead of settling for something lesser.)
---
If someone warps into you they want to fight you, the idea is it kills them so fast it doesn't matter if you scram them or not.
---
Hopefully CCP will see this action from goons and make a change for the better.... like varied and dynamic resource availability in null that “randomly” leaves delve with a pile of shit. Sad little krabs...
---
There hasn't been a large player drop why are you randomly making shit up like "the majority if players hate it" and "theres been a large player drop"?  One if those is probably false and the other goes against the majority of the voices on the platform you're making that claim on.
---
Could you post the actual link of the tweet?
---
Ive flown with Pred for many years and he is absolutely a great FC and an awesome dude...but he hasn't really had much of an influential impact on EVE like the others on the list. He gets his spot because he is a great FC, but he held himself mostly to LowSec, and for that I don't think he can really rate higher than people that led several hundreds of people in conquest/defense campaigns.
---
As for the others, they don't have much clout, Kendarr was a relative no one inside his own coalition, and Wolf to his credit was awesome to fly against and with (on occasion) in lowsec but he was never really a top teir FC "hiding" in lowsec like Pred. If Pred.
---
&gt; There is zero counterplay that rorqual can do aside from what
---
False
---
&gt; What about barges or exhumers?
---
They too have easy ways out. 
---
But I wouldn't tell publicly. It's always a race between the hunter and the defender and the fact is you've got much more mechanical room to get better than we do. We already push them hard.
---
V..... V..... V..... V..... Thrasher.... +15.... +15.... +30

Nah amigo. We can go to sisi and you can be in a rorqual and mine for an hour. I will randomly choose when to bomb. You will lose at least one, most likely 4-5.
---
You know what's an easy way out? Not doing it when you don't have friends online. Which means you don't wait around for people to be on. Which means you get disinterested and this repeats with others and then there are 10-15 less people online. That's what happens.
---
The journey from wide eyed newbie to disgruntled bittervet really is quite the experience.

Stop teasing me....that would be awesome!
---
i wonder how much t2 goes into navy/pirate ships, caps, etc
---
people will adapt
---
you fit max blap and try to kill them before they realize/manage to warp out
---
Covops is probably your best bet. Fit warp speed rigs, nanofibers in the low slots, a prober and cloak, and mwd and shield tank in mids. Recommend Helios or buzzard due to 5 mid slots

The game going offline or not has no relation to an individuals obligation or as you framed it 'worth' to buy plex.

Plex isn't worth it to buy. Why in gods name would you intentionally give a company that just got bought for half a billion dollars money... just to keep a game online?

yes, and also 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019
---
good job!
---
You'd probably have to make some very difficult compromises in order to fit a triple-scram, since there are only two mid slots.
---
Like the other guy pointed out, the idea is that in LS, pretty much everyone is looking for a fight. There's really no other reason to stick around in LS. If someone slides the gate into a plex, there's even less doubt. Because of this, you're going to find someone to engage you. Might as well win the fight fast enough that he never even gets to consider warping off.

Here's a change to WCS I just pulled out of my arse. Not perfect, but should be low-effort on CCP's part;

* WCS become an active module,
---
* No auto-repeat,
---
* Cool-down on use,
---
* Increases required align-speed from 75.0% -&gt; 87.5% (and so-on for stacking multiple modules).
---
Depends on what you're doing, and where. You can get a Victorieux luxury yacht, which can fit a covops cloak and is nullified so bubbles don't affect it, but it will die to smart bomb gate camps and the like, or you can fly a Monitor, which I know less about, but is supposed to be super tanky from what I understand.

I crabbed 12 to 15 accounts hard core because i enjoyed it. 6 of those accounts have pvp pilots on them. I credit card sub and sometimes buy plex because i recreationally crab for pure enjoyment, i don't plex. There's no way in hell I'm undocking them with blackout and drifters. As far as i'm concerned i'll un sub 6 to 9 accounts and occasionally buy plex. The risk and stress of crabbing without local and random ass behavior of drifters makes it an un enjoyable acivity. I used to be a good target for roamers and there was good content off that. Now I'm just going to do pvp stuff and over farm the people that are still crabbing because they are braver than me or actually need to crab to plex. I lived in wormhole space for 6 and a half years. I did my time of austistically spamming d scan and putting scouts on all worm holes. I retited to null because i wanted to enjoy my eve experience. That relaxation has been taken away so i wont do that anymore. Only speaking for myself, but this bullshit has reduced content targets in new eden by a dozen rorqs and some supers and cost ccp 9/15 subs. It has also added someone whos probably not going to do anything but hunt other crabbers if i get the motivation and transition to full ping warrior.

Ok a distinction without a difference. What has Asher actually done other than lead some Boat-esque meme fleets.
---
Everyone on this list has led and succeeded in a campaign in their own right. Asher's first campaign as lead FC was WWB, and he capitulated to upper leadership and did nothing, and has been chilling in Delve for 2 years.
---
So please tell me by what merit does he deserve to be on this list filled with people who have either conquered or defended, win or lose.
---
MFW no ShadowandLight
---
Although you probably don't want to use a monitor. They are tanky, yes. But it's not fast enough to be elusive. If there's a gatecamp they will take the time to wreck you in a monitor. The ship itself is 500mil and is neither cloaky nor nullified
---
I'm gonna disagree. This blackout has reminded me how much I absolutely hate gate camping and don't miss it being the meta. Sitting around a gate with bubbles for hours waiting for some poor sap traveling around trying to find content just to blob him isn't fun. It's not engaging for either group. It's boring to sit there waiting and, imo is no different than waiting around for an FC to ping a fight.   
---
You wait around and blob anyone that shows up, typically in something small enough that if a bigger fish comes, you just run away or the loss is so cheap it doesn't matter. Gate camping is shit.
---
Yeah, isk is weird in eve. At the beginning, millions is huge. At the end, the vet who gave it to you might as well have thrown a couple pennies at you. I've given hundreds of millions to new players before randomly, I always wonder if I'm helping or ruining the experience.
---

---
If Test weren't on bad terms with CFC because of Montolio there might have been an arrangement rather than a war.
---
Lol, no you are right. Everybody is loving this. The majority of players have finally gotten their wish.
---
From my understanding, your example of how it's used is exactly why people want it delayed. The goal is not just to prevent people from seeing a death and avoiding an area, but to prevent large groups from being able to immediately dogpile any gangs that form up in the area.
---
You aren't wrong that getting quick notification of active groups can create content for defense fleets, but from the perspective of the roaming gang it's not ideal that they get their location and fleet composition broadcasted as soon as they get one kill. It would be better if the defenders had to work or at least communicate with others that saw the fleet for that intel.

---
I think there upgrading servers that would be my guess.
---
No you can just ship scan it to find it's fitting.
---
Wow, that's actually more subs than I thought.  That's a lot of subs for a 20 year old game.  And there are a lot more out there playing player-run shards as well (and splitting the audience like that is less likely in Eve).
---
My point here is just that EA doesn't run shards out of charity; if it's still operating, I can just about promise you it's in the black, if marginal.  There likely isn't even a dedicated dev.  And (within reason) the smaller the community, the cheaper it is to keep the lights on. 
---
Maybe you're right, but personally, in a world where your Ultimas and Runescapes are still kicking around, I'd be shocked dead if Eve gets shut down anytime soon.  It's reached critical mass; there's too many players with too many fond memories for nostalgia not to keep at least a small cadre alive, a la Ultima, which was really my point here.
---
It's a joke, a fairly mediocre FC who did not succeed in defending Drones from N3 back in 2013.

If you ask me it was jump drives, bridges, and teleportation. Freighter convoys used to be a thing. Logistics were a lot harder. Stabs are OK especially since there are HICs and -3 scrams now.

How do Catalysts fare? I see them blaster-fit more than Cormorants and they have eight turret slots?
---
As long as the same applies to webs :-) Warp Core Stabs are absolutely necessary to get new pilots (yes I train as many as I can) to even try low/null.

Merely being in a corp of more than one person and looking at a skiff in the ship tree should prevent you from defending against the chad hunters ofc

---
Elaborate on that for me. It seems like a non sequitur. 
---
Why is changing web activation necessary?
---
Eve Online is 16 years old right now. We've certainly entered the angry teen phase of life.
---
But at that point they may as well just instantly align out if they're expecting that since you're helping them get to warp faster.
---
I would say if you averaged it out for the low and high populations across all 27 shards that would give you approx 7000 users. It is F2P though, so I don't know how many are subscribers. 
---
My main concern with your stance would be that CCP wouldn't have the financial backing of a company like EA. Often it won't make as large of an impact on an entity like that as it would a smaller developer/producer. They tend to trim the fat closer to the bone than a giant like EA.
---
hold up 33 tril net worth... wtf

---
And I think the trade-off of wasting slots is fair. Suppose if they wanted to nerf them a bit they could add an additional penalty to the scan range and resolution to also have it impact align times and/or acceleration.
---
The fits that I've seen have been T2 guns, T1/meta everything else.
---
I just don't believe that they would keep official shards running at all if it was not making them money, that's all.  EA are notoriously miserly and have killed franchises before that weren't.

"Not political at all". But them again, you can't really blame PL for occasionally going blatant propganda when goons have literally made it their business model.
---
Eve has great PvE content, and it's what \~70% of the players spend 90% of their time doing.  
---
Mining(moon, anoms, asteroid belts), ratting(killing NPCs for bounties), missions, trading, manufacturing, hauling, research+invention, incursions (large-scale group PvE), exploration, Project Discovery...
---
Every time I hear this "I don't like Eve because I like PvE" it makes me mad at CCP for allowing the large alliances to create a skewed (and coming from those alliances, hypocritical) representation of what Eve is.
---
Only if they start warp before your webs land. If you have them dual webbed before they start to warp it will slow them getting into warp.

No, you're not getting it. Let players destroy space. Let's be real, we'd be lucky to keep the current player base going, but there's enough space for a hundreds of thousands of current online users, maybe even a million or more online. Delete it, but let players pick the systems. Delete the stargates in a system and everything is gone, it gets asset safetied out maybe. Like is said, there would have to be a complicated process with limits and conflict drivers.
---
I believe that's 33 bil
---
We went for an obvious bait mach the day before- still managed to kill him as the jackdaw fleet landed- That we had no idea was coming. 
---
  We're blind, both as a defender, and attacker- And it's forced both sides to take more risks, or to assume there isn't a trap set- You can't see who's in system.

---
One of the scariest alliances people don't really talk about anymore was Stain Empire. Those guys were doing HAC gangs with precision before it was cool. Had many run ins with them back when I was in goonfleet and Brick Squad. I actually missed those crazy Russians when they went inactive.
---
Lol stabs are completely fine and balanced, considering the CPU they need, the low slot being taken and the debuffs they have. He just seems salty cause he might have missed some easy kills, which ruined the fattening of his killboard.
---
Worst concept? That sounds stupid, since it's completely viable for modules that stabilize your ship's warp core to exist.
---
open the door?
---
There are plenty of empty wormhole systems and you can pretty safely anchor a cheap structure without having to go through all the hassle of 24hr hole control.
---
Wingspan has a solid hole finding service, they can probably find you an empty C2.
---
Please. Better to just lose low sec.
---
We sure can please check out WDS Locators in game and our brokers would be more than happy to help
---
ADD SMA, pretty sure we killed them
---
Back in the days of captain's quarters there was a door you couldn't open.
---
#1 Not enought fuel, JF'd more in.
---
#2 Ops not enought cynos, Burnt Ceptors
---
#3 Cyno @300 instead of 150 off the dreads, still unsure how that one happened
---
#4 Atleast we got the wreck.... ye was a nicly fucked up op for sure but was some fun.
---
Agreed. Am steam player, only play a few weeks out every year. Just can't log in to the same game every day, dont know how to do it.
---
REEEEEEEE, are you enjoying the blackout though?
---
I sometimes SRP goon VNIs and noctis(s? nocti? Noctises?). 
---
I also wonder if I'm helping or just giving them another ship for me to blow up a few hours later. Though in all honesty the second result is just as desirable as the first....
---
ohhhhhhhh when incarna was still a thing. god that was years ago.
---
lmao
---
It’s just thousands of bots not onlining. 
---
Which means 253 Chinese and a few dozen Russians are working like mad to code new bot behavior.
---
thats a big yikes
---
Clearly he meant gyrostabs.
---
Heeeey I saw your rorqual xD
---
that's.....an interesting story you tell there

---
It's not exactly good game play having to spam a key. It adds nothing of value to the experience. It doesn't increase the skill cap, it doesn't add depth to the game. It's cool you don't mind but for me it's a huge QoL hit in a game that already suffers from a huge lack of QoL when it comes to UI decisions.
---
Hey call Shoot First. We personally already scared Snuff off our structures, we'll kick their ass somemore if we have to
---
Yall are praising this but my last fleet was 3.5 hrs of cycling links on a gate with 500 other bros playing chicken with the other 500 bads on the other side. No fight. We couldn't entosis for shit cause we couldn't tell who was anywhere which was made worse by the already shit cyno jammer issue. Only thing that happened was our tackle kept getting chemoed. This is going to make attacking with real numbers a bigger pain. It just means that I am going to need a fleet to match a defending fleet at every hub I toast.
---
As stated earlier, if you can't be happy by the small things, I'm not sure what will. I like seeing the emotion around situations, imagine being that fleet, you might say "oh thats boring as shit" but you just connected with the story. You would know how it feels, that is why these POV videos, that don't edit out comms or remove all of the good stuff are pretty cool.

&gt; SuperTwinky S2N #10
---
HIM? that guy was a moron and super racist. unless there are multiple supertwinkys.
---
What are warp core stabs?
---
It was funny, it was like a 11 man fleet and it turned quickly into 40+ kikis but with so many faxes.... hehehe and rorquals, it was a lot of damage to take in, then smartbomb legions came in xDD right on top of our kikis
---
What FC from Shootfirst? I would love some name so I can hit em up when it starts to escalate.
---
Admiral Darkhammer, he is the main FC for Shoot First. and the AntiSnuff coalition
---
Ooof
---
It's not paranoid if it's true ;-)
---
ur dum
---
perfectly balanced.
---
Thank you very much, added him to my contacts! Fly dangerously!
---
Maybe we should all undock in corvettes with no guns to fight back, no warp stabs to counter warp scrams, hell we won’t even d-scan so you can get all the e-z noob kills you want. 
---
I really don’t get you guys sometimes. Like if you don’t shatter someone’s entire month of EVE work  every day do you go and like kick your dog or something?
---
Same to you my friend, always remember fuck snuff
---
LUL
---
It's not overly difficult to counter them either. The ship with stabs loses more for fitting them than an attacking ship loses fitting extra points.
---
Just my opinion.
---
Feel free to contact Newteonomonics in waffles. He is our main FC
---
If this is true, it sounds like CCP is on a fuck all of Eve rampage. I hope it is true. CCP should changes all sec status, rules. 
---
Why stop with Nul? 
---
Nul - No local, no Intel 
---
Low - No gate guns/Bubbles allowed 
---
High - No Concord
---
Go team CCP!
---
It matters more what class of site each of your members can handle. If you are all actually solo accounts, a C3 might be a bit much unless you guys get together and sync your schedules. If you all run dual or +2 accounts then the c3 is a much nicer looking home. IF you all sync your play time and run more then one account each, then a c4 and 5 is livable. 
---
C1 and 2 can be run in solo ships, its of course easier and faster not to, but they can be. C3 is tough, not all sites are cheaply run, making your isk exposure that much greater for a solo player. 
---
I would definitely choose a 1-3 based on who my corp members actually are, what they like to do and how much time they are willing to put into it. Single account players will find it rough in the higher level wh, while higher skilled players might find it boring to live in a low class wh. 
---
Oh side note, WH are boring. Sometimes your exit hole is in a bad area (20 jumps from everything) and there isnt anything to do. other times there is a cloaky tengu somewhere being spooky. that you watched come in on your wh entrance alt. 
---
C2 wh are desired because of their connections, A c2 with a hisec and c3 is nice for groups like yours (and for people who hunt groups like your) while a c1 -&gt; Hs and C1 is nice for miners and single account people. 
---
C3 is usually pretty quiet but it does depend on who you actually have playing with you. C4 is quite fun but you all need to have more then one fighting account.
---
I used to fly a coercer with no prop mod or propulsion disruption on it in nullsec.
---
It still got kills, heh.
---
Thanks! hopefully blackout lasts a good while and we keep getting content like this! added him to contacts. Fly dangerously!
---
&gt;they lived on the South/West of the map
---
You mean South-East? They held [Wicked Creek](http://www.verite.space/maps/influence/20100211.png) et al. Although there was another alliance called Atlas. \[which was probably an attempt at the old glory of Atlas Alliance?\] that held some territory in the s-e. More Atlas history here - [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/3m9dpc/eve\_history\_who\_was\_atlas\_and\_what\_happened\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/3m9dpc/eve_history_who_was_atlas_and_what_happened_to/)
---
SOLAR Fleet split off from Red Alliance along with Legion of xxDeathxx after some typical internal Russian drama and made a little home nearby. 
---
Nulli Secunda were Band of Brothers pets that decided not to join the GBC \[Greater Bob Community\] in going down with the ship after Goons and co burned them and so decided to go elsewhere.
---
This is not a new thing in general but it's cool people are picking it up. A lot of people encourage it because a lot of times people don't realize they're not tackled in the heat of small ship pvp so it can do some serious work. But people have been doing this and talking about it for a long time :p
---
So where do you get dedicated players, if not the one program 99% of pc players have installed? CCP still needs to expose new players and there is nothing better than Steam for that.
---
So much promise. 
---
I miss the times but they weren't without issues as well.
---
Can we add drag bubbles and static ones and bumping to that sentence
---
ohh fuck i misread it haha
---
Not yet, shield slaves have been "coming soon" for years

how

Use the refer a friend option. And then buy the new starter pack that's gives new players 1mil sps.  That's should make a new character far better.

Are the c2 nulls 3bil? Because if they Are, and all you care about is roaming why not grab a c3?
---
Have you tried  bubbles in lowsec?
---
As all things should be
---
You can solo c3 sites in a myrm my dude
---
I’d say weaken the cloaking mechanic based on the SOV and activity of the system. 
---
If it’s active and at the highest level, certain modules in the Alliance Keepstar  or  another structure (required to possess this ability) project waves of cloak-nullifying goodness, limiting your camping to no more than two hours. You would also be visible to combat probes. 
---
The less active a system, the longer you can stay cloaked and remain invisible to combat probes (detectable only at highest level). 
---
I would also ask CCP to include an automatic mechanic that blows up your ship and instawarps your corpse to the nearest Jove observatory for an extended Drifter anal party if you insist on being a douchebag camper more than 24 hours a week in a particular system.
---
But then you lose to someone who didn't waste fitting on stabs or extra points.  Hence, the problem with the design.
---
can confirm
---
In Eve it's all about your standings with either Empire and you want to keep them all good pair because there's going to come a time when you want to do the Epic arcs for each individual Empire. This speaking for a guy who came back to playing the game after 5 years to find out that whenever I entered minmatar space I was fired upon. LOL I have since brought my standings up with them substantially in a good way to do it is by finding out where the career agents are and doing all the level 1 missions for the different Empires. It's a great way to relearn the game and strengthen your knowledge
---
make Niarja, Uedama, Balle all 0.4
---
remove them
---
gg
---
Thats funny since they were still having events at the Harpa for the months of April, May and June, check their event schedule because CCP smells like bullshit as usual.
---
Lol yes please do contact darkhammer with all your anti-snuff memes.
---
It's actually the opposite, since you just started you have little in the way of standings with any faction and so can travel to any of the four empires that you wish. As for ships none of them require standings or anything like that, you just have to pick up and train the specific skills necessary to fly one which can for the most part be found at any number of stations around space.
---
That's an isk sink to no end.
---
Your starting race literally does not matter. The roleplay scene died a decade ago and you're not going to be shot on sight in Gallente space just because you're a Caldari.
---
For all the great lore EVE has, virtually none of it translates to actual in-game mechanics.
---
Interesting thank you
---
Why is changing WCS necessary? Same stupid answer applies to both. Removing stabs but keep webs?
---
have ccp delay killmails by an hour gg
---
Maybe I’ll set the autopilot on my Condor and kick back, relax, and wander to Amarr. Thanks for the information.
---
you mean you recommend i delete this create a fresh one  ?  
---
also what is a starter pack   ?
---
Since the blackout.  Many many of my friends in eve have not left a pvp ship.  On the same note many won’t be plexing their accounts next month either because the income isn’t there.   The pvp accounts will stay active but the Indy accounts that can’t supplement the price of subbing are disappearing to alpha.  It will be interesting to see what happens in the economy.   If plex drops as well as the flow of raw materials prices are gonna skyrocket.  Where the scales end up tilting will be an interesting thing to speculate on.
---
warp core stabs need to be limited to types of vessels.
---
industrial family of ships, along with capitals (basically makes it a tad harder to harass caps on a move op)
---
don't forget the route between Amarr/Rens if you are cutting off the empires with 0.4's
---
Flying in Horde and spamming local was one of my funnest moments in Eve. Guess we cant sound the Horde horn anymore :(
---
Looks like Kia just reformed
---
Ah, I was just more concerned about automated style defenses. Turret platforms and whatnot. Duly noted.
---
Since blackout iv killed 2 dreads, a carrier, a drekevac, wyvern, and assorted other shit. Before blackout I was going to stop playing... please God make this permanent.

No, don't be ridiculous. They do not exist in Low. But I would like them too!
---
bUt HoW cAn YoU bE sUrE? 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
---
Cool story bro.
---
Ayyy
---
&gt;The game just needs more things worth fighting over.
---
Agreed.
---
Eve's PVP always appealed to me because it was (or at least was supposed to be) about more than JUST the PVP. You can get your PVP jollies anywhere: most MMOs, MOBAs, FPSs. But PVP there is usually just about having fun while you win points that reset at the end of the match/season. Yippe? 
---
Too much of Eve PVP is like that now. You have fun while you are in a fleet pewing, or roaming, or dropping, or poking around someone else's wormhole, or whatever... then you check your and your team's points on zkill... then you go to bed and repeat the next day. Sometimes there are big objectives a coalition is working on, but the individual fights are often so far removed from those big objectives and everything's opsec and line members don't even know what they're fighting for. Sometimes there's medium objectives like a WH group trying to evict or avoid eviction, but those aren't too common. Usually it's just 1-X people looking for a GF before they get podded home.
---
That's lame PVP. That's the kind of PVP that if I wanted it, I'd play league or some shit where I can PVP without all the "overhead" that Eve requires of you.
---
We need more small objectives to fight over. Like old POS fights, or stuff like Shadowbane's mine fights, or more structures that are more expensive and drop more loot to incentivize both attacking and defending them, or something.
---
not uncommon for older players to gift new players a bit of isk.  10m gets a new player a few fit destroyers, cruiser, or 10 exploration/mining ships
---
10m is a rounding error for many vets.
---
wats ur favorite anime

Ooh, fun name. I had a character named Iratus Sol in Shadowbane back in the day.

After losing one or two Keepstars when [skill urself](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/99007379) kicked the DRF out of the drone regions, they are now residing in Tenerifis and are nothing more than renters these days, just watching dust collect on old glories made by others.
---
Thank you very much!
---
What?
---
A module that makes it harder for people to stop you from warping away.
---
Thanks ;)
---
I'm pretty inexperienced in the game but I enjoy it very much as long as they do not kill me :(
---
I don't think stabs are a bad idea in and of themselves. They're bad when you have auto aggro drones cause then bots stab up and rat while even less catchable than before. They're bad when you have FW mechanics that reward unfit, stabbed ships for doing nothing. Etc. Maybe they could use some worse drawbacks... like fitting a WCS messes with your ship's engineering and applies a significant percentage reduction to your ship's CPU and PG or something. 
---
But they don't need to be removed so much as the broken mechanics that happen around WCSs need fixing.
---
Not a bad idea tbh
---
&gt;Why is changing WCS necessary? Same stupid answer applies to both. Removing stabs but keep the other?
---
Did you even look at the OP?
---
You have a tweet of the literal CEO of CCP saying WCS are shit. You might be new here, but /r/Eve has been saying WCS are shit for *years*. 
---
It's not whether changing WCS is necessary. It's whether changing them is beneficial. No change is ever necessary. But sometimes maintaining the status quo is dumb as fuck. I claim that this is one such case. 
---
You may claim that the specifics of my proposed change are bad -- I even encourage you give a step-by-step explanation of why they're bad.
---
I don't think worst necessarily means most cancerous. But least interesting.
---
Because nullification isn't shitty enough. HERE, ALLOW ME TO TRAIPSE THROUGH 0.0 WITH ZERO REPERCUSSIONS.
---
Well there's no real reason to do anything in EVE. That's the point of the sandbox, it's a toolset not a theme park.
---
We killed it.
---
It's almost as if the choice you make for fitting your ship is important. This is a user problem, not a design problem.
---
If he's talking about warp core stabs, then I think I am going to have to disagree. They are virtually worthless in every ship. I mean, unless you fit 3+ stabs, a single module will lock you down, and who wants to fit 3 lows when almost literally anything else would be better?
---
But that isn't really an issue with WCSs so much as an issue with drones. If drones behaved like any other weapon system by requiring targetting before they will engage, then the penalty on WCS would stop drone ratters from using them (or more than 1, anyway)... besides addressing other issues.
---
Spoken like a true middle-aged gamer
---
I think this deserves an appl... I mean a like.
---
No but seriously, I don't know if I like the blackout. It sounds cool, but it is nowhere near enough from CCP to convince me they're going to make the right design decisions to spice the whole game back up... so I'm still not playing.
---
Are CCP growing a pair or is PA threatening them?
---
Its not the mechanics, people are risk averse. They dont want to take a fight they can lose. I see kitchen sink fleets all the time but it doesnt matter if they chose not to engage.
---
People have just forgotten to have fun you know.
---
Go for a whole new account. Keep the old one around, just don't touch it.
---
All the while screaming "Give me my eyeholes!"
---
Maybe they'll give it the ECM treatment. It adds +1 wcs against every ship but the one that is disrupting you.
---
what would i do with the old one then  ?
---
Needs more polarized
---
It's hard to choose just one. Can I pick all of them?
---
Stabs are extremely relevant.
---
It adds a dynamic. More stabs hurts your effectiveness. Pvpers might have dual scram fits.
---
It adds depth to the game. Totally worth.
---
Question, for real. Isn't the whole point of EVE risk/reward, and counters? So like I'm going to risk a shitty tank, but I'm not going to be able to be pointed. And from the counter, a gate camper could fit for alpha DPS, with no point, since he is gambling he may run into someone fit with a stab.
---
I thought that was the whole point? Otherwise scrams could be viewed as an inverse problem for logistics. 
---
I donno, maybe I'm too carebear but I honestly thought counter play was a huge part of this game. It's why blockade runners suck in null, but DSTs are somewhat usable (depending).
---
UUUUUUGH F'in Hilmar again.
---
No, it's not the stabs. It's the fact that "warp scrambling" is shit.
---
You *should* have counterplay to warp scrambling.
---
"Warping" *shouldn't* be a bool you flip on or off.
---
Maybe the concept of a rookie frigate being able to keep any size of ship from warping is what's wrong.
---
Maybe they should think of something better as a system, rather than blaming a part of it?
---
I like zkill. A lot. Making that isk destroyed total goes up is why I do this. It makes me happy.
---
I want it delayed 12 hours. Squizz can't do it. You can.
---
It's a new version of Hilmar. I like it.
---
Uhhh how do you get a hic in a small or novice?
---
The concern isn't balance. Having a module in the game that lets you ignore a pvp encounter is bad design. Same goes for interdiction nullification.
---
It's already hard enough to find someone to kill without mechanics that let you opt out of pvp.
---
Just went Omega haven't played in forever I want Dat eve again
---
How do you get a hic in a small or a novice?
---
Not quite goons yet i guess
---
Idk, the usual way?
---
Could you share your elite PVP condor fit?
---
Everything needs a counter, and warp core stabs were a counter, even if they were shitty. To me, Hilmar saying this sounds like pandering to the minority who believe that, no matter how much prepping and planning the victim put into action, the aggressor should always get a kill. Not very Eve-like, if you ask me. Eve should be hard, no matter who you are.
---
In principle, I agree, but it's going to be hard to find a warp disruption mechanism that isn't Boolean when warping itself is also Boolean.
---
I was more a fan of the dual rep fit one
---
Attacks and defense. Warp disruptors,webs,scrams ruins low sec. Not the counter measures.
---
&gt; angsty teenager
---
FTFY.
---
I feel like I am being trolled but incase you legit dunno then I will explain
---
A novice is locked to anything other than t1 and faction frigs
---
A small is locked to anything other t1, t2 frogs and I think t2 dessies (lowsec bros correct me if I am wrong?)
---
You can only warp a hic into a medium using the gate (might be wrong) or a large which doesn't have a gate and carries can warp there
---
That's not true. Align time is based on reaching 3/4s of your max velocity. Being webbed before you start your warp has 0 effect on align time.
---
For the time being, leave it idle. 
---
You will *know* when you need it again.
---
I've noticed a lot less gate camps since I returned with the blackout.  Are others finding this? 
---
The "entry points" into null seem much safer now, while the camps have withdrawn to be closer to the territorial centers of the different pc alliances.
---
Then I go and sell mine at that price. Nice! Thanks goons!
---
I am Taco
---
The reason you had all of that dropped on you is because they know there isn't anyone coming to help...
---
The bots name will be visible yes but unless zkill has been provided with the bots key the bot won’t have a „profile“ to look up.
---
PvP = player versus player (humans, even if multiboxing)
---
They are 2bil. The reason being is you can find a highsec down the C5/C6 static you have so if you die you don't have to fly all the way to null.
---
C3 would be better if your just aiming to whale people in null since it's ns would be a 3bil hole.
---
The counterplay to warp scrambling is to either brawl down what scrams you or kite outside the scrams short range.
---
Not if I wait a few months and make 1b more isk from it it’s worth waiting for the price to rebound
---
&gt;who wants to fit 3 lows when almost literally anything else would be better?
---
FW bots, possibly the largest consumer of wcs
---
I've always wanted to see pirate stations in lowsec.  
---
Maybe the future will hold npc run citadels instead.  Heck, maybe even diamond or triglavian behavior will become the norm for all npc assets.  I wouldn't hold my breath though.
---
Idk, FW is strange. Almost as strange as j space.
---
Only have to worry about it once it gets negative. You can see your standings in your char screen.
---
Alternately, have stabilizers counter bubbles, but not fitted points.
---
Then you only need one.
---
My personal issues with the current implementation of WCS are;
---
* The drawbacks (scan-res and target-range) are largely irrelevant,
---
* There's no in-space player action required to benefit from them. 
---
I think there should be *some* form of WCS mechanic in Eve. But definitely not the one we have today.
---
Acemac
---
Just keep going back and keep doing this for the next year or so.
---
CCP will need time to investigate.
---
Yes I'll agree with that 100%. But it's not a bad design, it just needs balancing.
---
^^^WHEN I WAS

If you engage a small group of triglavian ships during an invasion, others will often warp to their aid to fuck up your day.
---
Almost as bad an idea as letting capitals warp into anoms.
---
Oh god thats hot
---
&gt; To be fair, he's been getting fed BS intel for years. 
---
To be fair, it shouldn't even be possible to feed the lead game designer "BS intel"
---
But Hilmar is not the lead designer, he's the CEO. EVE has no one in charge of it pretty much
---
[removed]
---
so by shit ton of faxes you mean 3? and look at the kill mails rorqs SB'ed you guys lol did you forget to add that you had 100+test bombers lol
---
It makes sense as a design concept for such a module to exist. Now, the mechanics it introduces are a bit of a different thing, but they still can be understood. Every mechanic in the game should have a counter. That's a key aspect of any game. 
---
The impact it has on a ship is pretty substantial in terms of CPU and low slot use if we talk about small vessels. The same can be said about the attacking ship which has to fit more modules for warp scramble strength in mid to catch the fleeting one. 
---
It doesn't let you "ignore" PvP encounter. It's just a mechanic that makes both sides be more prepared. As a result, both sides sacrifice more for their objective - which is more major for the stabilizers than for the scramblers, because a ship with stabilizers has a different objective (stabs are for security), when a scrambler has to have them either way.
---
Also, the usual encounter where this matters is the big ship catching a smaller ship one, which is only advantageous for the bigger ship even in this regard a bit, as it tends to have more resources and firepower, and is the one planning the attack.
---
I don't think the aggressor should always get a kill. 
---
I just don't like how the defender gets shift all piloting responsibility to using the Fitting Window, *once*, before undocking and never has to bother with it again. 
---
Compare that to the aggressor who has to;
---
1. get on-grid before the target warps off, 
---
2. burn into point range before the target warps off, 
---
3. lock-up the target before said target warps off, 
---
4. stay within point range the entire time,
---
5. not cap-out,
---
6. not get jammed-out by ECM drones or a Burst Jammer.
---
Yes, WCS are a counter to Warp Disruption. But does it feel proportional?
---
You live on a shirt?
---
Or the other option is rather than trying to shoot at snuff you could just go join a group that's blue to them? Seems to work for some people.
---
Elaborate?
---
but when i will need it the character will still have only 120k SP :s feels like im missing something
---
aka: -a-
---
Nothing like bridging 10 3x ORE expanded freighters and using less fuel than ~6 jump freighters.
---
It's totally not broken
---
This is how I feel. This, or just make it so that ships that equip them can’t fire weapons or use drones. Not sure how this could be explained in terms of lore but CCP always seems to be clever in that regard.
---
This is literally a post of twitch clips
---
Please refrain from posting again, OP
---
MrVee is mostly inactive he shows up from time to time 
---
i really miss him :(
---
&gt;The impact it has on a ship is pretty substantial in terms of CPU and low slot use if we talk about small vessels. 
---
Bullshit. 
---
A WCS has the same (lower for a BCS) fitting requirements as a T2 damage mod.
---
Agreed. The draw here is a full-loot pvp persistent universe. Avoiding fights should not be trivial.
---
Imagine an EVE where trade routes matter.
---
I mean brave refuses to undock half the time, and the other half is dropping supers on frigates. I wouldnt act like you are the paragon on pvp
---
NO MOM, ITS NOT JUST A PHASE
---
considering there seemed to be about 10% less people online this weekend, i don't think we could call it a success, really.
---
gyros and istabs tbh
---
The thing you are missing is lived experience. You're just going to have to trust here. 
---
Alt accounts are a big thing in Eve -- for a huge number of different reasons. What reason you will eventually have? I don't know. But when the time comes, you'll know. 
---
Or, you could just delete the account and make another alt later on. That works. 
---
In any case, you can't recycle character names in Eve.
---
The use of "#1" doesn't sound hopeful.
---
you can set the training on it, even as an alpha. just sign in every few days, set the queue, then log into your other character/account
---
Happy cake day!
---
Seems like his posting is all about twitch clips tbqh lol
---
I predict an initial spike in ship kills as those who are not up to speed are are never in coms die.
---
Eventually the people who are never in coms and are ratting/mining/running anoms in anything less than a Rorq or a Super will be wiped out.  
---
So the end results will be even less kills because good luck killing a Rorq or a Super that is in coms under a super cap umbrella, and anything less than that will basically cease to exist in null.
---
As for the botters, they will probably just make some characters to watch gates and run locater agents as needed to get the same functional results as having local.
---
If you love the name just alpha train it while you make another account and character.
---
Provi had a flurry of activity the 1st day and then it steadily declined after that, as a short weekend event every now and then it could work, as a permanent thing it would be fatal to the long term health of the game.  The only logical move would be to join a larger bloc, either leave provi for goons or legacy and provi blue up.  Which isn't the outcome people are looking for here, there's no way smaller groups can hold sov like this, it's all risk and no reward right now.
---
The longer this drags on the less active things will be, something to think about.
---
You're still arguing balance. My stance is it doesn't matter how effective it is. This module a step in the wrong direction and you're just telling me it's not a big step.
---
It's still in the wrong direction.
---
Ehm... Yeah, buy I don't see how this relates.
---
A T2 damage mod (I believe you mean Damage Control II primarily) has a different intention. Like, a WCS is fitted so you get out in case you get caught (while doing other stuff, like relics or whatever) - so it's fitted for security while doing main objective, sacrificing in process some stuff you could otherwise put in. A T2 damage mod is fitted so you can survive more in engagements, which are kinda part of the objective if you fitted it in the first place. I don't see how your comparison relates.
---
Stabs should reduce DPS/mining yield, would keep their legitimate purpose of being a travel aid device to get thru lowsec gatecamps, would stop them being used on afk VNIs/Ishtars (expect to see this a lot on Ishtars after VNI changes)
---
hmm?             
---
I don't care about killmails.            
---
But you cannot deny it that lack of access to them changed how the people do stuff around eve - and this was positive change.
---
i am not keeping him for the name 
---
the reason i want to keep it is that he looks exactly like i want him to look 
---
as a side question tho is it not posssible to biomass him to get the name to be available
---
So, whats your character name buddy?
---
i  never wrote anything about wanting to keep the name in my post  ?  its not the reason i want to keep the toon
---
Want to look them up on zkill... oh wait.
---
Rip.
---
Maximum warp range is limited by capacitor battery. Suppose that warp scrambling didn't use "points", but instead modified the distance-to-capacitor ratio so that the target could still warp, but the maximum range was measured in KM instead of AU.
---
"I could have taken the titan"  
---
lmao that dude haha
---
Wrong. It all comes down to mining. You can mine ore, ice, gas, salvage, exotic tech, blueprints, modules, ships, ISK, salt, and tears.
---
T2 pulses have the best tracking so that's what you want at least from my experience of getting under coercer guns with frigates.
---
Just drives people under the umbrella even more. Will be good fights for a bit but as soon as people get a taste for the safety under an umbrella, they won't go back.
---
Has horde even lost a rorq during blackout yet? Guess we will see money *shrug*
---
I wasn't arguing balance. I was arguing the design concept standpoint. That's what the initial tweet was about, as well as your initial response. 
---
Simply said: It's not bad design because it serves as a counter to another mechanic in the game. Same as auto-decloak if you're too near of an object, coupled with the limited actions a cloaked ship can do.
---
&gt; more uncertainty leads to more risk being taken
---
I think you'll find the reverse is true in most cases. Uncertainty breeds risk aversion lol.
---
This one knows what's up. Imagine coordinating an attack on a certain trade route, like train raids in western movies.
---
Just waiting for the cynos to go up for the goo feast
---
Whenever I happen to be in a rookie training system, either farming free ships and easy rep or delivering needed goods to market, I like to remind them to use whatever free frigate they like the least for the advanced military suicide missions, strip any modules they're not ready to lose, and drop a platinum insurance policy on it before undocking for some extra ISK. Always commit insurance fraud on suicide runs.
---
great post, thanks for sharing!
---
I would agree if you could know if the guy had stabs fit to begin before the engagement. Something like a visual effect around ships with stabs.
---
Being webbed doesn't improve your ships agility. It will take as long to get to 3/4 of your speed webbed or not. 
---
The reason why you can be webbed into warp quicker than you could otherwise get into warp is because you can accelerate then get webbed reducing your top speed (and thus what 3/4 your top speed is) so if you are going to be webbed by a 50% web, if you reach 37.5% of your max velocity before you get webbed after being webbed you will already be at 75% of your maximum velocity. Assuming you are aligned you will be able to get into warp at that point after only around 1/3 of the acceleration time it should have taken you to get into warp.
---
But if you are webbed before you start moving you don't get that bonus acceleration at the start. You will take the full time to get into warp.
---
You literally described wh-ns roaming as it has always existed.
---
This problem is symptomatic of the larger failures in EVE's design philosophy. The creators wanted to give players ever more powerful and expensive ships to skill into so they made Jump Freighters. Now everyone that wants to move anything in null uses jump freighters or jump capable ships because using anything else is insanely more risky. It would require you to coordinate a defense fleet and put yourself in a vulnerable position. You know, things that might create content in the form of non-consensual PvP. 
---
WoW went through a similar thing. Devs added comfort feature after comfort feature that were popular QoL improvement until they more or less killed core mechanics that made the game enjoyable, and now everyone wants classic back. Yes, freighter pilots should have gotten something to skill into, but should not have been teleportation because gates and routes were a key gameplay element.
---
What a qtpie
---
No, but they'll have a kill profile if everyone who killed them registered their APIs on zkill
---
Lol, the reference is to Braves fun/hour motto.
---
I'd like to see them changed to an industrial restricted module. Possibly turning them into an active module like the ADC where they have a long cooldown (5 minutes) or burnout after use but grants scram immunity for a short duration.
---
Alternatively, maybe it's time to relook at the stats of industrials as whole after such a change and see what areas need some love as these are the only hulls I see with a legit use for WCS given their actual designed role in the game.
---
Second alternative, maybe they could look into the binary system that is scrams/points. The longer it's cycling on you the stronger the point becomes? Throw multiple points on a target or just use a single HIC and the additive strength will keep them tackled. Could work to give more usefulness to fielding HICs as they will get the tackle immediately once the target is locked vs the current system of insta-lock ceptors. Two birds, one stone.
---
Regardless, WCSs are a cancer in all other aspects and should be removed.
---
Haha sorry its secret but all i can say: everything is t1, no rigs but scram web and longpoint - completely selfbuild.
---
&gt;as a side question tho is it not posssible to biomass him to get the name to be available
---
Officially, no. 
---
Unofficially, you can submit a petition to the GM team. They have the technical power to do it, but are also under strict rules on what to do/not do. 
---
Alternatively, you might be able to sweet-talk the GM team into making your second account look like your first. 
---
Honestly, this is territory I am rather unfamiliar with.
---
Someone manages to hunt you down and land a tackle.  And you warp off.  Because you equipped a warp stab.  And that warp stab carries penalties that do not affect your drone boat, so it's a win-win for you and a lose-lose for the guy who just spent a good deal of time looking for a target.
---
If you get caught with your pants down, you shouldn't have a "get out of jail free card".
---
This is not good gameplay.
---
WCS have their purpose on Epithals and other non-combat capable ships. I would make them fittable on Freighters as well. That leaves Ventures as the only problem, though only because they are so cheap. If someone wants to farm FW plexes with a DST, they should be free to do it. There are also stabbed Asteros running relic sites that are hard to catch solo, can't think of a good counter for them.
---
If you touch the PLEX market too much, CCP will ask you to stop
---
I'm retarded how do I add picture to post?
---
It's better to just remove API. It will solve a lot of problems including big coalitions. They're work only because there is a way to automate it. Without automation they'll be limited by how many people one person can manage and will require more people on leadership positions. So more ambitions, internal conflicts and less blue dounts.
---
~~shield~~ shit super
---
Idk, I'm just gonna post about it anyway cause I'm braindead
---
&gt; a lot of times people don't realize they're not tackled in the heat of small ship pvp
---
While true overall if you already fit stabs all you do is try to warp out anyways.

Chas alert
---
Exactly as the name suggests. “Warp core stabilisers” 
---
They will do their job, but to do so they require power diverted from other functions of the ship to operate.
---
I fully expect people to be mad over this post so please don't hold back. I wont report anyone for things they may say.
---
Sorry for the late reply, I'm now also facing these issues, but only when running 64 Bit with dx11. The problem might be game related. https://forums.eveonline.com/t/framerate-regression-when-the-ui-is-enabled/173571/2
---
You having to explain that shows how few people have to web Orcas or capitals into warp nowadays.
---
Where is the punishment? The fleeing ship gets a safe spot in this case.
---
Its not in protest of said Nullsec Blackout but in favour of. Zkill is still operating in the background and will be back up and running Monday to my knowledge.
---
Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
---
Our roam into PH space kinda got shot down by Horde dropping 4 carriers, 3 HAW dreads and a Rorqual on our 11 frigates.  
---
Was an awesome experience for our new guys, esp the ones who went on their PvP fleet ever.  
---
I have to admit, herding new players in null got a bit more difficult, since you have no idea how many of your guys followed your "jump" command until you decloak. Maybe CCP can improve the local by at least showing fleet members.  
---
11/11 would roam again
---
Let´s not let him off the hook so fast. There were numerous reports of him and the EA guy stopping Seagull from implementing changes. While we can guess where skillinjectors came from.
---
Sure, some of us are irritated but it'll be back up Monday.
---
&gt; But does it feel proportional?
---
Yes. Because a hauler never wanted to be part of that equation. A hauler (t1) is slow and immobile enough for it to be bumped out of alignment easily too. Also piloting responsibility doesnt end in the fitting screen for a hauler. He has to weigh the risk of his route, not use the autopilot and in the end take a risk facing a ship that will obliterate him within 15 seconds.
---
the GM team are very friendly indeed but i dont know if they would do that :o 
---
anyway ill make another toon while i consider what will happen this perfect RP candidate 
---
ty for your help :D
---
&gt;It's CCP's job to create an environment that creates PVP.
---
No, it's CCPs job to create an environment that enables players to do what they like, to have fun. The game you want is a seal-clubbing paradise.
---
Sounds like the default position on a claw
---
&gt;I know its in protest to the black out in null but do you really think this is a good thing?
---
It's not in protest, it's in support. It's a tongue-in-cheek way of going along with it. Squizz made a whole post talking about it. It's still doing backend stuff and it's going to be back up tomorrow, it's only down for the weekend.
---
&gt;First doesn't zkill have sponsors that advertise I know I donated isk to block the adds.
---
Man, you're a hell of a sucker.
---
&gt;If I'd payed to put an add on the site I'd want my money back right about now. also I'd sew.
---
Not sure what using string to attach two pieces of fabric together is going to do about getting Zkill up sooner than planned.
---
I was thinking like 20km and an empty battery. So they could be re-tackled by some attackers, but could escape other attackers.
---
I'll be excited once trigshit gets the nerfhammer
---
Quick question, what do you think the best frigs to run in null are? Trying to get back into eve
---
PogU
---
Where do you draw the lines for "casual mining"?
---
He just joined the blackout for a little bit. Said it would be running again today at 1100
---
then why do you comment on things you don't understand?
---
First the comments about mapper apps has nothing to do with zkill and is unnecessary in the point you are attempting to make.
---
Second, maybe you should have read the post from Squizz that it will be up Monday after DT, which should be in a few hours.
---
Lastly what are you going to sew? A sweater maybe or a pillow case?
---
&gt;Yes. Because a hauler never wanted to be part of that equation.
---
Who said anything about haulers?
---
Welcome new bro.
---
what's the difference between killing undefended structures and undefended rorquals?
---
there is none. Both are worthless and not worth talking about.
---
He donated isk to block the adds and that's what he got. No adds on zkill during the entire weekend
---
Pearl abyss replaced him with a posting bot
---
i'm amazed by the never-ending mid-sections in this video saying 'grr goons' 'panfam is better than everyone else' and 'imperium left empty handed', Tribute was glassed just as it was announced - OP success?

&gt; Not sure what using string to attach two pieces of fabric together is going to do about getting Zkill up sooner than planned.

Its almost like roaming gangs are fine fighting each other. My corp was in catch yesterday and brave wouldnt undock at all, we ended up fighting a goon raven gang that was messing around in ge as well
---
Love it.  Also love the thoughts on delayed kill mails.  I wonder if it would condense a lot of alliances to just a few systems.  Basically if your not active you don't get Intel.
---
Also it's harder to multibox PvP boats

That's correct! Eve shows are available at 20% off.

I managed to find the [amazon prime master list](https://tricksdrop.com/best-prime-day-deals-2019/) which has a ton of deals across multiple categories. Worth checking out at least once.

Woah what. Where and how do I get this?

I've run a no-point T1 DD in lowsec as my 'null retreat' for awhile now, It reaps great results, is cheap enough to 'fuck it' whelp to whatever a bait-frigate is bringing in, and a ton of fun to fly when you want something, more point and click to take your mind of things?
---
The coercer is nice because it can hit out to range too.
---
I've seen two neutral battleships just randomly in delve this weekend, I never saw that before, I expect once the hype dies pvp may level out again and maybe fall off as people learn how to stay safe, but I think this weekend it will be up, but just judging will probably not be that indicative.

Well if you have Prime just go to Amazon and search for "EVE Online starter"

Why forcing WH playstyle on NS.  
---
If I want ot have WH playstyle I would go to WH and enjoy it there like I did at the start of Apocrypha I think the WHs were introduced.  
---
But I really do not like this make NS as WH.   
---
If they are going to keep this change ,athan balance it for the hunted guys too.  Now it is a big buff for cloacky hunters.
---
Because a hauler is prime user of stabs and nerfing or removing them wont hurt most pvp ships but industrial ships.
---
I was memeing somewhat because who the hell wants to read a comment on reddit that goes through all the details of the causes of the Fountain war? You could launch an unsuccessful kickstarter to write a book about that...
---
So, in short, two points to make:
---
1) Mittens has said since that he had been promised Period Basis by BoodaBooda and then Booda gave it to Tribe. That led to a lack of trust which then prevented any negotiation on buying/renting moons and forced an invasion. Obviously there were other factors too.
---
2) A lot of key figures left TEST either during or immediately after Fountain because of reasons. DurrHurrDurr deserves a lot more credit for keeping TEST from dying than he gets.
---
would it bug you to know I'm not a goon, but I am one of your blues..
---
Warp core stabs NEED to stay or else solo wormhole pve is dead. Get tackled by an interceptor? Well fuck you. With stabs you can deploy a depot, refit and warp off
---
Fair point but I believe Mittens has said a fair few times since that Booda breaking his promise over Period Basis and giving it to Tribe instead of Goons removed any diplomatic option to the moon goo changes.
---
I web orcas when moving them around just so I don't have to wait around for the damn thing to get there on its own.  Avoiding ganking is just a bonus.  Transit time is the real bad guy.

I don't know but I had tons of fun, In total I managed to point and kill 2 VNI and 1 Ishtar this week end (and got wrecked by 10+ caracal), before the blackout I never got a single one. Also, I live in a null sec static so now I have access to infinite pvp content so I really hope the blackout stay !
---
Did some \*\*math on Exhumers to show how negligible the current WCS penalties are: 
---
|Ship w/o Links/Implants|Max-Skill Mining Range|Max-Skill Target Range w/ 2x WCS II|Range Difference|
---
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
---
|Venture|12,000m|11,250m (1x WCS II)|\-6.3%|
---
|Procurer|15,000m|13,500m|\-10%|
---
|Retriever|15,000m|13,500m|\-10%|
---
|Covetor|18,750m|18,000m|\-4%|
---
|Skiff|15,000m|15,750m|\+5%|
---
|Mackinaw|15,000m|15,750m|\+5%|
---
|Hulk|18,750m|20,250m|\+10.8%|
---
You can throw two WCS on any Exhumer and *still* mine at full range. If you mine in a T1 barge, at worst, you lose the outermost 10% of your range. Mining Laser Upgrades have a higher fitting cost than WCS.

I’d suggest a Rait or preferably an Astra in a c3, you probably won’t be bothered, lots of isk to make and only one static for the 3 of you to worry about. If you can find a less “desirable” c2 then that could be ok. 
---
POS really isn’t worth it anymore, if you planned to make it home it would cost you a lot more to setup and then run, and citadels give you that sweet tether repair )
---
Cyno's ruin far more PVP then warp stabs

&gt;uy one of those $499.99 every single month until (1) Alphas aka "screw you long time Omegas"; and (2) Captain's Quarters disappeared (I dropped almost $10k so far in Star Citizen to reclaim the walk-around ability, worth every penny). I need that, so I pay for it.

&gt;Sometimes the 15,400 Plex were on sale. The 25% off ones were the most appreciated. I would buy 2 or 3 of those during the sale. I never bought from a 3rd party (like MarqueeDragon), I always bought directly from CCP website.

While I agree with this generally, I think that less information over all contributes to a more dangerous "feeling" Eve.  When you have less sources of information you feel like you have less control over things.  So while some information my contribute to more fights I think less information will result in a more dangerous feeling Eve overall.

I’m the eyehole man!
---
&gt; With stabs you can deploy a depot, refit and warp off
---
Is this a thing? This process takes a minute+, can't imagine backup being so far away.
---
I'm not going to lie, I really missed zkill this weekend. You see I like to see my kills and deaths, but because of the way in-game killmails work, there's a lot which I won't receive simply by not being the final blow. This is where zkill comes in (for me).
---
Now, if the in-game kills were sent to every participant, instead of just the one person with the killing blow, then I would be perfectly happy without a killboard altogether!
---
PS: Logi on killmails plz!
---
Yeah agree with you there, there should be WCS, but the current drawbacks are irrelevant, the risk/reward is far to strong on the reward side.
---
If the bonuses were kept the same, but WCS gimped tank (-25% shield, armor, hull per WCS), there would be real consequences to fitting them, risks that match the rewards.
---
If you haven’t figure out yet grath, that account is a new one just being used to stir up shit on every blackout post. Best to ignore him
---
It's far from optimal but it's the only way to escape an inty (now that I think of it you could refit to ecm...)
---
nonsense. 
---
you can still say hello whenever you want.
---
it is. that doesn't mean new players know that and report the people doing it
---
Exactly my point so I’m cashing in my nyx sell the mofo and go t3 in c3 wh space still be doing 200 to 300 mil a hr while risking only a fraction of isk.
---
Exactly!
---
Yep, everyone knows the only source for isk in eve is either super ratting or rorq mining
---
PL used to have a "private" killboard that had the location listed as "classified" for the first few hours after a kill happened
---
I think that's the ideal solution and I don't think it would be that hard to implement considering it's been done before
---
ECM doesn't disrupt targeting the ECM ship anymore. The only thing that works reliably anymore is a heavy neut.
---
more hands cut off!
---
I think he wanted to say that new generation mostly uses phone games and PlayStation.
---
What I do know is that my 13yo daughter have never mentioned anyone from her friends to even have PC. It is parents PC in case they need to print something. And when they play something it is mostly phone games.
---
Caps don't need wcs
---
Hilmar is drunk and expressing how he feels
---
Huh, did they give any reason to why the Drifters would just stop suddenly because Concord decided to divert bandwidth to other parts of space?
---
It kind of has additional drawbacks by taking up lowslots and a decent amount of CPU. It's really hard to fit armor tank alongside core stabs, and you lose dps/speed on shield tanks.
---
Not that core stabs are a perfect mechanic, but the fact that they don't see much use even on krab fits should say something.
---
First of all, FW pilots would like to have a word with you.
---
Secondly, everything you said about routes, autopilot, and getting obliterated is _equally applicable_ to the aggressor. I think your argument there holds no water. 
---
Finally, making WCS an active module doesn't hurt Industrial ships. It only hurts AFK pilots. I don't mind hurting those people.
---
LMAO man I do love goons.   
---
Aryth seems the last ecenomically savvy person who frequents CCP HQ. Doing a price spike to crash it later to liberate moonmats from their owners to control matket further.   
---
Noice.
---
Let's just put it this way, if you double it you might get your 2 cents worth!
---
but he has a podcast!
---
&gt; The drawbacks (scan-res and target-range) are largely irrelevant
---
They were relevant at the time they were introduced, where they were extremely common on sniper fits (there used to be no drawbacks).
---
Oh right yeah... Maxbe sensor damps, will check when I get my hands on pyfa. Heavy neuts are kinda suboptimal for BC/T3Cs ya know :(
---
&gt; The coercer is nice because it can hit out to range too.
---
Don't all of the turret DD's have a range bonus? I've only seen railguns and artillery on Cormorants and Thrashers, though? but back in my newbro days a few months ago, a beam Coercer was my PVE ship of choice until I could fly cruisers. And I still made plenty of good use out of it. It's still sitting where I last left it, with two tractor beams, four salvagers, and an MTU in the cargo hold.
---
If you still interested in doing those just get in touch through PMs.   
---
I can give you a hand with party runs using frigs if needed.
---
No Hilmar, gatecamps are the most boring thing in EVE.
---
&gt;Raiden
---
I've seen some activity out of x13 in the past couple of months, not sure what they're up to but apparently making moves again so that's something
---
I am interested and have the will!! I'd like a few more zeroes on the end of that, though!
---
Warp core stabs should be an indy ship only mod
---
Good luck!
---
Thats true. But the Dual-web coercer preforms great at both ranges. Gleam, the beam-lasers close range Xtal has lovely tracking, combined with the dual webs your preferred tactic is to sit at face-melting range and burn down the targets in a DPS race (or, mine was)
---
But the beams can reach out and touch those kiting Tristans and Condors, especially the keep-at-range kiters!
---
Same for dualweb Incursus ;)
---
I think stabs are more of a nullsec problem. 
---
Especifically ratting drone boat problem.
---
&gt;  legacy and provi blue up
---
they already are strategically blue. just like test and imperium. you're kidding yourself if you think otherwise.
---
Eh, I think stabs do have a place, BUT they need a rework in context of ratting drone boats, which basically suffer from no real penalties for fitting them.
---
I've seen a rising number of stabbed vnis in nullsec
---
shit.. i mean, you saw nothing, we were never here!
---
I'll argue with anybody really.
---
Yeah sure they could be more balanced, but I still think Skill Injectors hold the no.1 worst design concept in eve place
---
How many of these ways are useful for industrial ship? And what can use battleship which is not fitted to deal with frigate?
---
nopoor
---
I don't know man, nullsec was fucking empty.
---
I like how people believe this will bring content to small gang and allow small alliance to take space. Oh my sweet summer children..
---
They're pretty vulnerable to dictors inside the blackout and are trading quite a lot of dps for those stabs. If they're shield tanked, they have to use lows for cap, which means fewer slots for ddas and such.
---
It's still not perfect, but they're trading quite a lot of isk for some extra protection that only works while they pay attention to grid/dscan.
---
Source: Ratted with 1-2 core stabs on an Ishtar for several months earlier this year. Still died sometimes, lot of isk I didn't make due to fit gimping.
---
And here i dident realise we paid rent to anyone, i better tell our renters that the rent they pay us are going to pay rent to... eh. someone i guess?
---
As was said somewhere above, esi killmail fetch delay will prevent checking the systems by zkb(other 3rd parties) for gatecamps or other recent activities anywhere in eve.
---
I'm sure vily and the mittani would like to help next time
---
ccp can split the day for 6 hour periods and provide such info during this time. or they can somehow stick it to everyday downtime.
---
Ah well I'm a new player too. So I don't have much isk like u XD
---
No, a damage mod for your guns. How on earth did you think I was talking about a DC?
---
Have you never fitted a Heat Sink, MFS, Gyro, DDA, or BCS before?
---
hisec wardecs hi-end content
---
If ore price goes up, so does the price of everything. Which mean your ore is not more valuable if you use it to get assets.
---
Sure, to fill your wallet with useless isk it would work.
---
&gt; Tuskers flair
---
By reputation, you guys probably know more than I do. Especially Kelon. I hadn't really thought much of doing it in an Incursus because I have lower Gallente skills and I'd rather go into a small plex and not have to worry that any faction ship (especially Comet) or pirate ship would make short work of my ship. That does sound like a good idea, if I was going to do an Incursus (Amarr ships are also so my better-looking than Gallente).
---
No BR? No KB link? Get out!... oh wait
---
Having the big bling kinda feels hollow for me anyway.
---
But that's for a different reason.
---
Because the game is so focused around emergent gameplay, I don't really feel compelled to get more than the basic stuff.
---
Make them usable only by certain ships.
---
Neither do you. You can buy ships because someone mined and produced it. Gosh, are people that retarded ?
---
But you are both right. If the webs are applied while you are still at 0 velocity, they don't affect your align time. And if the webs are applied when you are already part-way aligned, they make you warp faster. They never make you warp slower. Even /u/redpandaeater is right - if they start aligning as soon as they land, they will have gained some velocity by the time you can lock them up and webs land, so they should warp out almost immediately.
---
Love how you are bringing up other peoples play styles yet you felt the need to role a reddit alt and distance your shit stirring on reddit from your main in game
---
This is a nice idea. Maybe implement them like the capital hull energiszisers and have them use 30% cap per 10 seconds? That way most ships can gave 1 strength for 30 seconds. 2 for 10 and 3 for 10. But again low power active mod?
---
You can't seriously be saying hunted with gain something by losing local and spamming d-scan ? I mean that would retarded, local is perfect intel regions away.
---
The only thing this blackout is doing is allowing small gangs to find "content" and then get fucking hammered to oblivion by 50 titans, like before. And it also cause rorquals to lose 500m drones to a retarded 3 cloaky loki gang in perfect safety. How the tables have turned.
---
Okay but what actually happened here what died
---
I mean once zkills up i can link you a few brs if you want
---
Fair enough, my sample size is definitely too low to have any statistically relevant conclusions - this was pre blackout too
---
Dualweb 3mid frigs are quite popular. Beam tormentor, blaster incursus or comet. Really nasty. They trade the pointing power in order to plug in their greatest weakness (range control, especially vs 4 mid slot ships).
---
This way they can effectively take fights which they otherwise wouldn´t be able to take (incursus vs arti firetail, tormentor vs dramiel or breacher, just for example)
---
Especially the Incursus can pull off quite some stunts, since people don´t really expect the 2 webs. 85 percent of the time they die before they realize they are not pointed.
---
Dont they just camp the rancer pipe?
---
Don't confuse Reddit with the playerbase.
---
Reddit is full of bittervets crying because rorquals are unkillable and nullsec is to safe while being unsubbed for more than 2 years.
---
Go roam in space, find no one, and come back. That's this weekend status. Sure, more people went and formed gang because they were hoping to find something. By the end of the weekend, if not before, this will die down, because ultimately roaming 60 jumps with or without local will probably not give you the content you're expecting.
---
Or make the ship align slower. (or both)
---
I don't think I'd go set out to PK others. I'd just go after what I set my mind on and avoid run-ins with others.
---
But isn't one of the biggest use of wcs defensive plexing in fw?     
---
You don't need guns or drones there.
---
I know it. I'm just not sure if I can really get into the game.
---
Just make an account and get in touch with people in hisec that do the triglavian invasion stuff. Ahould be right up your alley!
---
I'd say close to the same amount but less of the "empire builders" VNI/carrier who are to scared to undock and more PVP entities who have been on the prowl.
---
I always think of FW first when it comes to wcs. Or drone ship ratting. Both aren't affected by the drawbacks, the former doesn't even care about the low slots.       
---
We don't need a module protecting FW bots and Ratting bots.
---
I just answered your question in your original post. You never mentioned any possible reworks, just wrote what is bad about it. 
---
Also if you think afk pilots are safer with stabs you are mistaken.
---
Considering god kills a kitten and a puppy every time you fit one, yes they are bad modules.
---
I'd like to have the numbers for this, though I'm sure we lost quite a few people in space this weekend.
---
Don't think they have the 5 buck one I'm looking for (it gives 1mil sp) sadly ;(
---
OK. So the conclusion would be:  
---
This game is old.  Implementing such a thing is probably near impossible right now or would actually stress the servers because the game engine doesn't allow such features to be implemented without a cost.  
---
People will still defend CCP for not implementing the automatic dscan because they are just used to pressing the button and they think that it gives them some kind of edge.  
---
    
---
It's all clear now. Thanks for the responses :)
---
Maybe he played the game for a change
---
Clearly, their diplos talked and they sorted their respective areas.
---
I think there was some pod/cloaky thingy using screenscrapping on stream to alert when someone entered local shown on Reddit months ago.
---
Just be sure it will happen very quickly if the blackout is here to stay.
---
Newbies don't get nearly as much out of intel as old players. 
---
So it makes them safer, because it hides them form old players.
---
That's if you hack it but yes
---
Why on earth would you want a C2 with static C3, that way you are stuck with a shitty HS as second static and a good chance of a HS or LS static in the C3. Talk about meh.
---
It is not like it is hard to fins a HS down our C5 chain. We get good logistics holes pretty damn often. And the C5 chain gives better access to wormholers.
---
This logic really only applies when predation is necessary for survival. 
---
Hunting for the thrill of it is an entirely different matter.
---
&gt; Go roam in space, find no one, and come back. That's this weekend status. Sure, more people went and formed gang because they were hoping to find something. By the end of the weekend, if not before, this will die down, because ultimately roaming 60 jumps with or without local will probably not give you the content you're expecting.
---
Totally agree. People doesn't unterstand that it's very bad for roaming (perhaps not in the beginning, but it's obvious).
---
An embargo on exporting ore/materials out of Delve is probably less policed/enforced than the no exporting Titans/Supers out of Delve.
---
And its not exactly a secret that people move those from Delve for profit/personal use.
---
22nd best indy fc in the imperium
---
I don't get it. 
---
Is this a 'shop of something?
---
Off the hook? Hilmar shouldn't be in charge of a fruit stand, much less a company.
---
Shit true enough lol
---
While I really like the *concept* of freighter convoys on paper, no jump freighting would essentially kill some very fun playstyles.
---
If you're a large bloc you can secure your space well enough to gate freighters around. But if you're a small group or if you're trying to deploy to hostile space you're fucked.
---
We need him drunk more often.
---
eve is mostly good with newbros, if you get killed mail the person that did the killing and ask what you can do to not die,   
---
mostly you will be pleasantly surprised with good tips and even isk....mostly.  
---
get an idea of what you want to do in eve and set out to do it. stay away from hisec mining tho that is soul crushing 
---
few quick tips  
---
contracts in jita are mostly scams double check everything  
---
never undock a ship you can't afford to lose, when you undock you consent to losing that ship no matter what part of space your in  
---
solo is a viable playstyle but you need to know what your doing, joining a corp early on can give you a huge leg up in the game.
---
Two people receive the killmail. The victim and the one with the final blow. If one of them or their corp has an active API on zkill then the kill will show up. 
---
^\(BTW ^I ^don't ^know ^how/if ^it ^works ^for ^alliances.)
---
For a small group c2 static 3 is best.. Unless youve got the hardware to run nags in c5 space.. Keeping control of the hs is super easy.. Just crit it and almost no one will dare enter.
---
C3 pve is the best for solo - small groups again if you cant run nags in c5.
---
Going straight c3 is dumb cuz you want sites so cycling the statis is how you get more.
---
So if he was a large group or has been in whs for a while I would agree with you but hes small time which means losing a solo nag wont be.. Fun for him. Lol
---
I personally recall a Querious campaign where his "Gorilla" tactics came within an ace of toppling an alliance. That was possibly two years before the Casino/WWB war.
---
Why would anyone want to stop shooting at Snuff though?
---
Avoid autopilot. It's a 1 way trip to death
---
Not data/relics.. Basic sites absolutely right the fort I believe is great for lower class ships
---
Data/relics can kill tengus soo no a myrm wont survive in them top one of 4 bs spawn afaik? Like 2-4 k dps its a bit silly for 100m.
---
I mean it used to be a thing, if it had kept being a thing people would be so sick of it now though. Also it was a thing back when it was much MUCH safer to do it. Now with bombers/T3CS/Titans/Supers etc it would be insanely difficult to actually survive it.
---
What Squizz did was that he stopped showing who gave him the API to pull killmails. He didn't stop pulling them.
---
Krabbing, of course that is all people do. But I still disagree. I've done my share of C3 site and the money you and one buddy can make of a C5 site is way better.
---
"Alive"
---
One corp recently refounded the alliance. That's a small stretch on alive.
---
I have 3 stabs on my PI Hauler, and they work a treat
---
Training new pilots to use warp core stabs?  You sir, are a moron.
---
i can't believe they haven't fixed this nearly two years after the fact
---
Tbf, there’s so much to be fixed lol
---
God damn Hilmar's about to get his ass ate I swear.
---
Like
---
Your loss, the real profit is in the reactions. Thats free isk youre giving away!
---
&gt; Increases required align-speed from 75.0% -&gt; 87.5% (and so-on for stacking multiple modules).
---
This would be super clunky and not good game design in my opinion.
---
You can achieve the same effect if you said it increases mass or inertia without making it weird.
---
It is an easy fix - Just add a check that if you are in a ship with wcs fitted all incoming isk is rejected from your wallet. 
---
So if you sell something on the market while in a wcs  fitted ship you pay the taxes etc but get nothing.
---
All LP should be discarded too.
---
That balances the risk/reward. No risk = No rewards.
---
I probably should look up what that triglavian invasion is to make a decision about it.
---
You just posted your comment five times
---
We're still on Chapter 1. Give it time.
---
The attitude needs fixing here. You don't "ask for help", you "invite friends to get free frags".
---
Cool.
---
You don't like that nullsec is hard.
---
Good for you.
---
That doesn't make the changes bullshit.
---
Well ofc, everyone should feel the *vern*
---
They sit in large fw plexes and tick down the timers.
---
this
---
Shoot me a  mail ingame
---
&gt;You can achieve the same effect if you said it increases mass or inertia without making it weird.
---
That would affect non-warp characteristics of the ship. I was hoping to avoid that. I basically wanted to double the align-time without affecting anything else. 
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but to double the align-time, you'd have to double the mass (or equivalently change the inertia modifier). That might make a WCS ship unnaturally *good at bumping*. Oh. I get it now, hahaha.
---
so you didn't think it rhoug
---
No harm in trying dude. If it's not for you you're not losing anything by not playing.
---
Zoomers is the nickname for Gen Z, I.e young as fuck nerds like me.
---
I wonder if it was Falcon who told him to say it, or did they just do a frequency analysis of complaints and chose one at random.
---
Also with dual mag stabs, I think you can get close to 300 dps hot with void.  Which is entirely unexpected from a T1 frigate.
---
Dictors exist. Git gud.
---
But I want all my content NOW! I'm unsubbing my 69 accounts because clearly CCP doesn't want to do anything good with their shit game!
---
Drifter invasion was just a lore excuse for the blackout.
---
Triglavian invasion is just a lame PvE event.
---
Sansha invasion is just another forgotten mechanic.
---
Sorry to burst your bubble but Occam's razor and all.
---
TBH not a bad minor change. I'm surprised mining ships are allowed in FW plexes in the first place.
---
PCU was pretty flat. Maybe the worst this year. Hopefully CCP will stick to guns and see this through. It will climb again as people realize this is the new normal and adapt.
---
go to highsec then?
---
I'm wondering what could be a good alternative for high skill "late-game" freighters. 
---
A flying fortress style freighter that can keep moving while taking a beating and firing back (weakly)?  
---
A freighter that can send holographic decoys to warp to other gates/stations/citadels when the real one warps?  
---
A fast freighter that can drag a convoy into warp with it even before the other members of the convoy align and charge warp?  
---
A freighter with a defensive module that depletes the capacitor of the first (or first few) attacker to aggress?
---
Yes and no.         
---
From my perspective stabs are good ... if they are limited to a specific group of ships.           
---
Basically warp stabs need to be adjusted so they can be only mounted on subcapital "industrial ships".             
---
So all haulers, all minig ships , stuff like noctis.             
---
When i say subcapital i exclude stuff like orca, bowhead or rorqual.
---
As official spokesman for /r/eve I can confirm that everything you read on reddit is 100% true
---
In FW, they don't
---
not surprised. the most used mining ship in the game is suited well to tank and withstand the pve and pvp environment
---
The interesting thing about that, was that it wasn't ess drink, better, or more drink better.  There was a sweet spot.  It's the same point of the evening where you know the lyrics for every song ever written.
---
Well if thats the merits of what makes a good FC I can think of a half of dozen who would make this list ahead of Asher still. Guys who actually did break Alliance with gorilla wars, not almost or nearly.
---
Under Ashers command the CFC war machine got meme'd by Lowsec groups. Hardly the hallmark of a good FC/Campaign leader when your 30K+ member organization gets dunked on by groups a fraction your size.
---
Triglavians invade lowsec as well.
---
There is no such thing as alliance ESI permissions for killmails.
---
Autopilot can be a useful tool, but it's pretty slow. It only warps you to 15km from each stargate, and then "slowboats" to it before it jumps you to the next system.
---
Conversely, if you manually warp, you can land directly on the stargate and jump immediately.
---
It's pretty important to check your route, to ensure you don't inadvertently enter any low security systems 0.4 or lower, because you will be shot and killed by other players.
---
Of course if/when you want to do some pvp, lowsec is a good place to go!
---
Welcome to New Eden! :D
---
From my perspective stabs are good ... if they are limited to a specific group of ships.

---
People in those ships usually have no way to defend them self and the only thing they can do is run.          
---
People can bring more scrams or faction bubbles, use hics or bubbles if this is null.                   
---
But general idea is that no combat ship should be able to fit stabs.
---
No i dont read reddit, i just shitpost here
---
I really agree
---
I really hope we get a Devblog with some nice graphs showing destruction, ratting/mining, size of ships used, etc.
---
lol I never had this many fights in my eve career. can't even keep up with the content. been solo roaming all weekend, don't know what you are talking about.
---
Basically what enzo said briefly summarizes the major things that went wrong. The initial plan was pretty simple, we had seen them RF it the day before (right before we intended to run it no less) so we decided to wait until the volta dreads had almost finished it, then come in with tackle &amp; LR dreads shooting into their resist hole (they require significant Kin/Therm resist to survive the rats, leaving a pretty gaping explosive hole, something Naglfars are quite good at shooting) then kill them and try to either snipe the loot or kill their DST and try to take it from him.
---
In addition to the fuckups Enzo listed, there were no cap booster 3200s for sale in the system where we fit our dreads, nor was there any Titanium Sabot XL, and we oopsed that one when acquiring the fits from hisec. After we didn't have enough cynos the first time, we had 1 blops cyno in system and were able to blops bridge in my 2nd regular cyno while the ceptors were burning to desto. However I had to light immediately to bring in more dictors, as we had run out. And in doing so we lost both our blops cyno in (thx evictus) and our only regular cyno in (again). And somehow we died 300km from the dreads, I'm not exactly sure how he got us there (thx evictus again ;) ) and when our next cyno came into system we had him go to the wrecks at 300, not realizing we were 300 off (all 3 of us trying to organize and lead this fleet were dead with the toons we had in system), and the dreads came in wayyyyy too far away.
---
It was a total unbelievable shitshow, but it gave us a good laugh and we did manage somehow through all of the catastrophic failures to kill their DST, so half of the objective was completed lol
---
My favorite place to be.
---
You don't have spies in Goons, only your krab alts
---
Them being bought doesn't mean the company made money.
---
The prior owners made money.
---
the price of trit surely is not increasing
---
Does this mean we can pass past the intel if we burn in a small ship?
---
What did you get? Grilled stuff burrito?
---
no one knows
---
NO ONE CARES ABOUT A SINGLE VIOLIN

&gt;Friendly reminder to all **nullsec ratters**

Hard candy T2 freighters.

Guns, huge tank, scram range bonus. 
---
Just because you can catch it doesn't mean you can kill it.
---
Want a hand?
---
Fw bots, vni bots, real players ratting in drone boats, list goes on
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
go to highsec? you know, the area where people can avoid pvp.
---
&gt;I just answered your question in your original post. 
---
You answered conditionally on the defender being a T1 Industrial. Drone boats and FW plexers are also two common places to find WCS fitted. 
---
If you said "WCS is fine because haulers can use the MWD Trick", you'd have shut me up. It involves active effort from the defending pilot. It even has the benefit of scaling against an infinite number of warp disruptors. 
---
&gt; You \[...\] just wrote what is bad about it. 
---
And your response was basically "If a person doesn't want to PVP, they should just check a box to exempt themselves." Not wanting 'to be part of that equation' is not justification for avoiding PVP without putting in the work when the time comes.
---
the data shows us that players want to mine in FW. ccp should go with the flow and add veld to plexs.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/7kF6mqc.png](https://i.imgur.com/7kF6mqc.png)
---
Are you assuming that WCS stay mechanically the same? As in; a passive module, fit to ship and gain +1 warp strength.
---
Realy liked the Dragon gank :) keep it comin'
---
Add drone bandwidth nerf to stabs. 25% per stab. Will solve the VNI afk ratter issue.

probably the same, because he was. But he was also a really good FC when it came down to it, probably the best FC to come out of S2N...although I personally hated being in his fleets because he was a complete cunt.

---
Wait, you're not /u/stainguy
---
honestly this list was just off the top of my head, there are several that I would add to it after having more time to think, especially from back in the old days from groups like Moo, -5-, Curse Alliance.
---
&gt;I only bought one of those this year, I might buy another not sure yet.
---
&gt;I used to buy one of those $499.99 every single month
---
&gt;(I dropped almost $10k so far in Star Citizen to reclaim the walk-around ability, worth every penny). I need that, so I pay for it.
---
&gt;I still loyally spend almost $2,000/yr in subs. Yes, I could PLEX my account with ISK but free Alphas do NOT pay CCP's bills, I'm not stupid. I almost cut my subs in half this year then Null Blackout happened, lol. LOVE IT! I'll cut them if/when it ends.
---
Mate spending 10k on scam citizen and £500 per month on a game that costs £10 a month to get everything out of it isn't normal. Please go outside and re-evaluate your choices. 
---
Also how could you possibly burn through that much ISK, are you losing blinged titans once a month, and carriers every other day?
---
Lol. I saw a new guy on Twitch get gifted 100 million and he used it on a mission running Griffin Navy Issue with Shadow Serpentis 150mm rail guns.
---
Now you can fully expand the DScan window to replace local :D
---
You can still use local, it just only shows your name in the list if you talk
---
But surely the local blackout has crippled Goons already! All those dead Rorquals we were promised.
---
No? O well.
---
To be honest, this is the perfect example of goon mentality. Goon fucks up, blames CCP for their fuck, activates impotent ragequit thinking it will force CCP's hand and make them change the system back in their favour.
---
The truth is that this pvp happens just because people expect pvp to happen. Therefore many undock.
---
If you were to blame local for "no pvp content", it would be only at a 10% level at best.
---
90% of the pvp doesn't happen because *you* decide not to pvp.  Blackout is nothing but a date.
---
It's not possible to effect align time without effecting mass or inertia. When a ship has a movement vector in the right direction and it's speed is 75% or more of top speed it can enter warp. This is why you can warp instantly if you pre align.
---
Yeah take a good change and ruin it. No wonder Eve has evolved into a shit game.
---
People who trust it's safe, have been mining. Not in any big block, and dieing in an absolute fire. Many dead rorquals over the weekend. How long till they join goons
---
I would hope they actually got metrics instead of half-assed assumptions. They should know exactly how many people download the game and pay their subscriptions through Steam.
---
Steam might not be the place to recruit fanatic new players (one game every day all year) but dedicated players (subscribed throughout the year with at least one account) is more than possible, especially with the reach Steam has. Point in fact, I came to EVE through a Steam sale.
---
As much as I suspect your main point is correct, your example is bad.
---
Gate camps are excellent. Most of my best 1 vs many fights have been me getting something disgustingly blingly “accidentally” caught in a badly thought out gate camp and then murdering everything not smart enough to warp off.
---
refer a new account from this one, use that one and keep this one asn an alt

Please tell me what the game is about enlightened one
---
Woohoo. 1 out of 271 chat windows can be close. Progress! :P
---
Just give warp core stabs the same penalty as polarised weapons as well as the scan/lock nerf.  Would also mean once you fit them you might as well polarise fit too I suppose.

&gt;It's not possible to effect align time without effecting mass or inertia. When a ship has a movement vector in the right direction and it's speed is 75% or more of top speed it can enter warp. This is why you can warp instantly if you pre align.
---
That's only true because CCP *chose* 75%. CCP can choose any percentage they like -- it's not something that just magically pops out from the mathematics every single time.   
---
I'm proposing that this 75% dividing line change to a different percentage when a WCS is fitted.
---
If they will be limited to like those ships then yes.             
---
Why not. 
---
You have no idea how many T1 industrials managed to get away from me only because they had more stabs that i points.              
---
This is valid counterplay for those ship types (aka they have no other) if they are perma tackled they just die.
---
I'm hoping for something like this, too,
---
It needs to be a CCP thing, too since anyone with a little knowledge can set up a killboard. Maybe CCP can generate the mail immediately but not make the KM link available for a few hours.
---
Same thing with out of game map statistics. ESI data can be a few hours behind.
---
its not a mining ship, its a frigate.  Look at the skill required to fly it.
---
They would have to move it from the frigate catagory and into another catagory
---
Probably because of the blackout

---
I know that feel comrade
---
Fine by me! If they warp before the point lands, they didn't need the WCS. If they don't warp away, then they're vulnerable to being bumped off alignment.
---
Actually. They can make you warp slower. If your align point is not in the direction of your warp point and you get webbed it will take you longer to turn to the new align point. Because you're moving faster then your max speed.
---
&gt;I was spammed today by a ~~botter~~ totally real and legit player to tell if I was online or not.
---
Is this another case of "Everyone I don't like is a botter."?
---
I used to do this all the time in wormhole space to check if people logged off in my home or if people who *did* log off in my home were logged in.
---
That doesn't make me a botter.
---
Sorry, but every 5 minute intervals to the second doesn’t exactly sound like human input lmbo
---
If you PVP, you have to dscan few times while warping to see if there is ships in system.
---
If you PVE, yes, you have to often check your dscan for incoming threats. dscan delay is 1sec, so you can type V every second.
---
You are not forced to type V everytime, at your own risk.
---
I think you made this post because you lived too long with the local security. Space is wild and dangerous 
---
As a wormholer, i really like this directional scanner mechanic.
---
scan-res/target range nerf might have come from the old days of meta dual 100mn torp ravens (burn eden elite pvp) and also to nerf those 200KM gate snipers.
---
CCP kind of forgot they nerfed torps to shit
---
Can't speak from experience but I'd be very surprised if they could run them, I think they'd lack both the tank and dps. But you could always try them on the test server I could be wrong
---
Was thinking that, but then that just invites if you fit 1 you fit 8.
---
By making the penalty worse for each stab you fit, you still make it a fitting choice to fit 1 or several, and if you go past 3 you're much worse off, than if the penalty was just the same as polarized ones.

Gate camps are interesting for the person who gets caught in them if they're in something that won't get insta-blapped, but they're deathly boring for the people actually doing the camping unless it's a high-traffic gate.
---
It's a mining frigate, where else do you want it?
---
D-scan should definitely not be automated. If you don't want to have to use d scan then live in high sec.
---
And anyway after getting uses to pressing V every two seconds I do it as muscle memory without even thinking anymore. Leads to a few moments of excitement then disappointment when I forget I'm in high sec and see some marauders on scan
---
how often did you try? you will die alot and i mean a loooooooooooooot before you get a grasp about how to dodge, run through or break camps. most people you see do these things have been playing for a decade. can't learn that in a few months.

You may want to opt for a 13 inch Windows laptop from Asus, Lenovo or HP. I see it as an optimal compromise between mobility and performance. 300 dollars won't buy you a very powerful one, but any computer that isn't complete garbage can run at least one EVE client. The entire rig (laptop + charger + mouse) weights less than 2 kilos and fits into a courier bag.
---
I have to disagree - while it's true shutting down zkillboard and dotlan changed a lot, I don't believe it's a healthy change for the game overall. Contrary to CCP part of blackout (local chat change) that removed the instant effortless passive way of gathering intel, removing external/3rd party tools providing data that can be utilized as intel will arguably hurt variety and quality (subjective, will elaborate on it later) of pvp content, while also disproportionately benefitting powerblocs.
---
Disclaimer: this is partially from hunters perspective - I tend to extensively use both ingame and out of game tools for most of my pvp activity (and basically everything I do solo), and all that is with some degree of understanding how valuable this kind of intel can be when used correctly, but still having in mind drawbacks and potential issues related to it.
---
1) As it is now, all intel present on zkillboard is willingly shared by someone who wanted to share intel with all of EVE community - be it aggressor or victim. While the intention could be different (like some groups requiring killmail link to apply for SRP, wanting to brag about nice kill, having ESI added to not have to manually post all kills for whatever you use zkill for etc.), I assume virtually everyone using zkill is at least somewhat aware it can serve as intel tool. If you don't want to give others free intel, don't put your ESI in zkill and don't post killmails until you think it's safe, but at the same time realize that if other side wants to share with all of community info about that kill, there's nothing you can do to stop them. From my perspective that's fair - it's a secret shared between two players until either of them wants to share it with others. If anything, I'd delay killmails pulled from ESI while still leaving the ability to manually get and access direct killmail link when taken from ingame killmail - that way lazy approach of just providing ESI wouldn't mean killmails are realtime intel, but it still keeps all the benefits of being able to post it manually whenever you might want it posted.
---
2) Out of game and 3rd party tools are active way of intel gathering that is restricted in usefulness by several factors - mainly tedium (the more detailed info you want, the more you need to dig in), skill/experience in data crawling (it takes time to learn how to recognize what kind of pilot you're up against and what to expect), time (checking 3rd party tools takes time) and the data being potentially incomplete or imprecise. Note this point applies equally to using ingame map info, which shares a lot of similarities in terms of usecases with zkill/dotlan. And while effective use of all available info can give you immense advantage, it comes at a cost of time and effort, so most often the actual case is how much data you get before you say "screw it, I know all I want to know" instead of how much data you could potentially get given near-infinite time. Quoting from [8 Golden Rules for EVE Online](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/8-golden-rules-for-eve-online/3973):
---
&gt; Somebody, somewhere has better skills than you, more experience than you, is smarter than you, has more friends than you and can stay online longer than you. Just pray he’s not out to get you.
---
In my perspective, it applies very well to use of 3rd party tools. Someone out there will know how to use those tools better, will check them faster, will check things you wouldn't think of checking and it gives that person an advantage - which is a part of being overall better player. Taking away those tools takes away one part of possible skill reflection on outcome of pvp engagement.
---
3) Publicly available intel sources equalize playing field. This is something I noticed clearly during the blackout, when lack of zkill virtually killed all the hype and possibility for me going for solo blopsing in a way that wouldn't be basically suicide. Without public 3rd party tools like zkill/dotlan to be able to make **informed** decision about level of risk you're about to take you basically need coallition-level resources, including spies, multiple scouts, intel gathered about known players, player alts, multiple running locator agents etc. Again, this puts big organized groups at huge advantage in relation to solo, smallgang or (relatively) independent players - virtually killing several pvp/ganking options completely due to sheer risk of getting baited into hard to comeback from loss that's impossible to mitigate with limited resources. With zkillboard, dotlan etc. as they are you reduce the gap of available intel between random solo/smallgang pilot and leadership member of coallition/powerbloc. This is assuming said person wants to and can use available information, which might not be the case, because #2 - people sometimes don't find it necessary or worth the effort.
---
4) It creates significant way of obtaining advantage in combat by skills that are not only limited to knowing how to doubleclick in space and what buttons to push in what moment. It adds another layer to pvp - from casual roams to bloc-level warfare - that is an option available to be utilized. More different ways of finding advantageous fights and getting upper hand means both more options to one up your opponent and more areas where you can mess up and make costly mistake, therefore enriching pvp environment as a whole. Using available tools is fully optional and there are skilled pilots that can go out based only on general knowledge about certain regions/places and still be successful in whatever they do, not using all available tools doesn't automatically make you unable to achieve anything, it only shifts your chances depending if/how you use them - and for more casual content not by a large margin.
---
**TL;DR:** 3rd party tools providing intel are good for variety and quality of pvp: they're equally available to everyone, optional to use and participate in, allow skill expression, provide incomplete/imprecise data and are limited by effort and experience needed to use them correctly. As-is they work well and only changes I'd like to see would be to limit the passive part of using said tools (autosharing kills, webhook) for intel while keeping active intel gathering as is (with maybe some QoL changes, like more powerful complex search for zkill).
---
Funny. I spent two years in a WH and never thought to put on stabs when I did any PVE. Maybe you should just HTFU and lose a ship from time to time?
---
Wow this guy is precise to the second even in getting killed, the second timestamp (:32) on ALL pod losses is the same ....
---
lol what? have never been busier in regards to fighting people (mind: actually fighting pvp'ers instead of krabs). i can't keep with all the content so i reactivated a second pvp alt so i can solo with 2 chars
---
If they can prevent a ship with a certain module to take the gate they surely can prevent a specifc ship to do so.
---
But hey, if they added enemy NPCs to defensive plexing and made all plexing work as offensive the problem would be solved.
---
Aren't they all fighting in some hisec system? Seem to recall reading about an RP group losing a citadel in a caldari or gallente hisec system.

Stabs are used on a pve ship. I thought we were trying to enhance the pvp experience and not just make it easy to kill ratters.

Do you have proof to back that claim??

&gt; If you don't want to have to use d scan then live in high sec
---
and get ganked in no time. you need d-scan in highsec as much as you need it anywhere else
---
Wait... for real? I mean, what you have said about second day?
---
Gesundheit
---
This seems like great solution - still allows you to get the info about involved parties whereabouts using locator agents, but doesn't provide it instantly to everyone by just looking at the kill; puts additional step for gathering detailed intel without completely cutting interested party from ability to get that data.
---
Next up CCP deletes Inertia Stabs instead of Warp Stabs .
---
This question has been discussed several times on RU forums. Overall answer is:  
---
1. Country (and thus the payment currency) is tied to the account when it is created.
---
2. Theoretically the payment currency can be later changed via support if one f.e. has move to Russia (and his IP confirms that)
---
3. It is quite possible that using VPN to mess with support can result in some sanctions as you'll tell support that you live in Russia while you'll log in into a game using some other's country IP
---
Stabs do two things:
---
1) They make your ship weaker
---
2) They make you less likely to be caught
---
Both things reduce amount of interaction between you and the rest of players community. Thus stabs are bad
---
I mean, if you wanna get technical its an LEDC masquerading as an MEDC in its western cities...
---
Dont waste your time you'll die.  Just follow the preferred ships and fits that are tried and tested.
---
The other options are likely to get you banned.
---
&gt; cause a hauler is prime user of stabs and nerfing or removing them wont hurt
---
I bet haulers use less stabe relative to ratters/ FW pilots. Haulers need lowslots to haul. They have to balance the risk/reward where a stabbed ratting VNI only reduces risk without losing bounty reward.
---
This. Very much this. Although stabs are a terrible module I can counter them - jump gates especially with them being on grid with keepstars  is just anti-content
---
Looking at eve  forums there is a lot of salt...my guess is bot owners  and afk farmers crying a river...ccp dont bend the knee
---
&gt;69
---
Nice.
---
Only if you're in a blingy ship or mining and keeping am eye out for catalysts but even then you can see who is in local which go as better Intel anyway.
---
You do not need to use d scan in high in the same way you do in low null or j-space
---
While i can see your point I still think it is somehow weird that to make the game funnier carebears have to play blindfolded and hunters need some “free intel”. And it’s carebears who receive “low level” and all these names.
---
sorry but no
---
Re-energized? Because perhaps up to about 500 people write on reddit? Saying how glorious the blackout is?
---
&gt; gate camper could fit for alpha DPS, with no point
---
That might work on slow warping ships but CCP decided to nerf lock speeds years ago and pretty much did away with bug zappers (cruisers with nearly insta lock times and absolutely no tank).
---
There's some considerable archeological evidence, yes.
---
I typed a long reply but realised you're just a salty guy and the most joy I could get was just imagining you sitting there upset that other people are enjoying the new content, so I deleted it and gave you this instead.

Well that and all the free shit you can find, like half of the ~20-30 Geckos I've scooped so far were in Hisec.
---
never had so much fun doing solo BS roams since 2011. thx ccp
---
Imagine need to play the game. To relay on Intel from actual players and not for an app telling you that there is a "not blue dude" 6 jumps away. Horror!!!!
---
Imagine that you can use bubbles on Low SEC and people start to cry that they can't play that way and will not log on until bubbles remove from LS. Well, that absurd is how you look right now.
---
It's funny how the nullsec dudes talk themselves like the alpha males and shittalk abouy LS and HS about content and "real pvp" but know that they have to be on the game and not watching Netflix as multiboxin 3 rorq, cry like a raped nun. "I will not log on until change back" "we can't play this way" "gg, unsub"
---
Don't you were so proud about your +100m tickets? Your fleets and strengh? What stops you about ratting in your own space? Because your umbrela is still there, you know?" 
---
Man. Rly. Shut up. Man up.
---
Does it matter if it was a bot or not?  
---
It doesn´t 
---
It´s a shit mechanic that needs to go.
---
Baiting is essentially **the** intel pvp - entire pvp occurs before both sides see each other on the grid, actual fight or standing down is just checking which side won. Great example of baiting done right is Fredrick Vonhole, and seeing how effective he is at that means it is entirely possible to bait even with all public info available - and public killboards etc. actually add to it because they allow both sides to play around that info instead of making baits extremely easy to setup and execute if other side doesn't have active spy in baiting group (which, for solo pilots or small groups is virtually impossible to achieve).
---
&gt; fight more easily with the knowledge that first capital kill that will show on zkill will bring people from half of eve to your fight
---
You can always (try to) enforce on your group being quiet about what you're doing and not post kills/not have ESI on zkill; you can't stop other side from sharing the intel with rest of the game one way or another - it's up to them regardless if there are public tools or not.
---

Hi, just FYI there is an option to block incoming invites. It’s not ideal as sometimes you want to receive a fleet invite but it is a sort of workaround for fleet spam or chat spam

Don't: Bring Stabs

the fleet invite issue is super rare tho i think

You have used this word to give your story special color. Why did you do that if it was insignificant?

Good luck catching stabbed VNIs in a dictor.

---
Can't you just create a new account through a Russian VPN, buy PLEX through that account and then send that PLEX to your original character? I assume that's how all the bot wranglers do this anyway.
---
What about Bob?

Reeeeee nullsec end game content is no longer 100% safe!!!!  Unsubbing all 20 of my botting Nyxes now.  Thanks CCP.  How will I feed my family now, without my RMT empire?  Had to sell my PC, posting this from the Job Centre.
---
&gt; I think stabs are more of a nullsec problem.
---
Try telling that to all the people who've caught my ships that I'm moving through lowsec, only to warp off because I load the lows with WCS and inertias for moving. Stabs are an even bigger problem in lowsec since you can't bubble, so you have to have more points, or a fast locking hictor.
---
CCP itself advises to transfer characters to the steam (with russian store).
---
EvE should encourage interaction between players, stubs make the opposite
---
It depends on how often you want to look at it. I've started doing PI this month and decided to go with a super lazy PI &gt; P2 setup which needs supervision only once per week. Not sure what the profit will be yet.  
---
So on each planet I got  2 x Extractor(4 heads each) -&gt; 2x storage (one per extractor) from there, there are links to 2 x P1 factories per storage (4 x P1 in total). P1 factories give materials to 2x P2 factories which route output to the Launchpad.   
---
In total 2x Extractor, 2x Storage, 4x P1, 2x P2, 1x Launchpad per planet. Got that on all 3 chars.    
---
If you are interested I could show you a screenshot when I'm back home.
---
&gt; The drawbacks (scan-res and target-range) are largely irrelevant,
---
I strongly disagree here. These are crippling drawbacks in pvp, that prevent people from making use of warp core stabs to pvp with, which would be cancerous.
---
Pretty sure the Plex price in rub is still more expensive than a direct pay subscription in USD
---
Move to lowsec then.
---
This 15 year open beta can be ended eh

you had my vote for a lowsec gate to stain.. then you make this post :\... too much spod make brain bad.

Don't be silly.
---
I was already pretty sure we were past the bargaining stage of grief
---
Throw a few fits at me. The only ship I can think of that would get positively fucked by fitting a WCS is a Garmur. 
---
And to be fair, if I could fit WCS to a Garmur and have no downsides, I'd bloody do it!
---
Agree CCP should spawn Drifters on FW gates to prevent minor ships enter sites.
---
Ganking people on stream just to watch them die on stream is a low moment rather than a top one
---
&gt; Forcing someone to press the button every 2 seconds is not a valid game functionality
---
It's completely retarded, yes.  It's not "fun and engaging gameplay".  Some kind of radar that pings automatically is needed.  Its display should be related to overview settings but also player skill and a new kind of boost a player's ship can fit.  It should be enhanced for all players by fleet membership (fleet boost).
---
There are lots of ways of playing with this so it's kind-of fun to use.
---
I think it is possible that it was just a lore event for the blackout, and possibly an AI test. 
---
I find PvE uninteresting but seems it is somehow necessary. I would much prefer an experiment on completely free market type interaction in this game with serious promo and incentive around player interaction only, but that's just me.

Warp core stabs are fine and just need tweaking for FW.  They are another module option in an array of options and do help out industry types.  Removing them is honestly just removing more sand from the sandbox imo.

It is opt in right now - kill information is available to two parties - the side that got killing blow and side that got the lossmail, it's up to either of those to post the kill, either automatically using ESI or manually. If neither decides to share the kill info, it stays secret known only to CCP and involved parties (including whoever gets access to their ESI) forever.
---
Yeah. I had a something went wrong error and pressed the button five times. As the something went wrong error implies that it wasn't posted. And I still can't see them under my comments like they aren't  linked to my account....
---
&gt; At the beginning, millions is huge.
---
I actually managed to skip that part of the game. I was doing exploration in highsec and scanned down a combat site. Really struggled to do it, had to borrow some isk for a drake or something if I remember correctly to finish it.
---
I don't remember the specifics anymore because none of these things meant anything to me, but it dropped some deadspace module and some other loot worth almost a billion total. That was in my second week of playing. Never had to worry about isk afterwards.
---
just give them stronger penalties for fitting them and the problem should solve itself, i.e. reduced damage/application/resists/etc
---
"Waaah...  Why wont the PvE players play the game the way I want?  They should just let me blow them up over and over because that's what's fun for *me*."
---
It is but let's not get carried away by lauding the fun and engaging gameplay that is hitting dscan every two seconds.
---
Do you think they would be willing to change it even though I am not from Russia.
---
Excellent idea, just a comment tho : Shall we keep WHS not blacked out ? Zkill is somekind of crutial to gather up intell within WHS.  
---
Even if we can play without it, it was a pain to setup some response fleet this week end :)
---
Factor in rorqual boosts. That's adds quite a lot of range. Over 150% if I remember correctly
---
Try a maulus navy with a faction scram. Mni gets +2 scram strength and a range bonus for scrams. With a pub fleet scram you can have a 5 strength scram that does its job out to 20km. Makes the mwd kitey cunts scream in horror. Not to mention ventures need to double stab to prevent being held by it.
---
He prolly ventured into the fun and engaging lifestyle of a high sec suicide camper and got fed up with every industrial being stabbed and him not getting dank kills.
---
At the moment its awesome for pvp. But i would never undock in a miner or ratter - and im a active crab
---
deep space transports to lowsec!
---
ccp must change name to 2slowplease games
---
U need to dscan every 2 seconds and if u get something on dscan u have 4 secs to warp off or u probably die. Most of the time its a friendly ships but u dont know. So its nearly impossible to rat or mine.
---
First, this is literally impossible to do, if anything like that was about to happen, I'd make sure to mirror all available kill information for purpose of having access to it later on. In that case it'd make a lot of sense to keep said info non-public, therefore making it my own advantage over people who didn't do it or joined the game later on. Great way to make the game even more biased towards older players.
---
Second, using this exact method you can also intentionally mislead people who check your history. This "guys who just runs with militia" might as well be an alt that was doing random lowsec stuff and building history so he could be used to tackle your moving titan the moment you least expect it, or the "seemingly snuff cyno alt" might be pvper that got a friend in snuff to let him be bait 2-3 times so people who check zkill would leave him alone when he's running lowsec missions. Feeding false information via available channels is big part of intel gameplay and metagame, and it makes this part of EVE more interesting and engaging.
---
Nobody forces you to "press button additional button every 2 seconds and as often hear the dscan sound".
---
Nobody forced you to use Near2 or other tools either.
---
Pressing that dscan button as much as possible also will not do anything against cloaked ships (these will also not show up on that new scan you)
---
TL;DR: Nobody needs dscan for krabbing, if you don't like isk/death ratio, you might want to shift your ship/fit a bit more towards PvP.
---
Why not all of the above?
---
Because i consider clicking button every 2 second annoying?        
---
Like i stated Null != WH.
---
Well okay, Moscow city is second world, the rest of Russia is third world.
---
No gate!
---
that was the Russians who said that about BoB to Mittani (pbuh)
---
How many years am I gonna have to tell you fucking retards to use the God damn maulus navy because it has range and strength bonus to scrams so even stapped ventures cant run away? Are you people fucking stupid or do you just hate being told you're wrong?
---
I only came here to upvote this. Because that is deserved here.
---
If you wanted this shit, i heard theres a place called wormhole space.
---
Or fix the fucking gates because they clearly shouldn't be in there. But yeah, I'm retarded. You got me, dude.
---
and to do that you got to die a lot, I know. I just lack patience. Well I guess eve will teach me that :d
---
Horde doesn't (members shouldn't) drop in geminate. TKE on the other hand is their new blob heaven.
---
My point here.          
---
Dscan don't work well in a nullsec that have some active population.       
---
You have to ignore it totally ...               
---
This is not a WH with 5 people online and on comms, but place that have constantly people moving in and out in various ships with different names.
---
no very often, I don't really have time to run around all day :/ But yeah, I will try harder
---
Nah man I actually am happy to see him speaking up on this topic. Same happened not so long ago about nullsec local, we can all see the result. Himlar, if you are actually trying to understand how your game works now - Bob bless and best of luck

Now we just need to wait for all the killmails to be parsed  [https://zkillboard.com/ztop/](https://zkillboard.com/ztop/)

DUDE, LOGGED ON CHARACTERS ARE NOT THE SAME AS PLAYERS DOING STUFF. STOP CONFLATING CHARACTERS WITH ACTIVITY.  We could have lost 10k bots and gained 5k humans and the stats would show minus 5k. PCU is a terrible metric to solely be using

Give back crimea and we will talk :D
---
Correct.  But we still need a radar that's more than a c# ListView control with a bunch of shitty records in it.  I mean really, what we've got now is not very imaginative is it.
---
You say that because you don't use dscan properly. This game can't be designed always by the will of the nullsec alliances. All of us play this game, but everytime that a change is made in the game and this change doesn't gives you more advantage upon other players, you begin crying, unsubbing and shitposting. A lot of changes have to be done to improve playability in this game. But automated dscan will be another advantage to nullsec alliances, and a disadvantage to wormhole players like me. Adapt, play, and stop crying. o7

Was 100% my fault for getting baited on a free hawk kill :)

Technically first/second/third world is about political alignment during the cold war. NATO and allies were first world, Soviet bloc and allies second, rest third world. Originally had nothing to do with how developed or wealthy the nations were. So Russia is second world, Switzerland is third world.
---
If you want an auto-dscan it should be an active module that gimps you in someway like stabs do.

EVE community does not hate new players. We hope u will stay and get fat ... so we can shoot u in a meaningfull way later.

It's an improvement after catering to vocal wh groups with 100 cloaky alts.

I want a fine balance struck between PvE and PvP. CCP has made it clear their priority is PvE, not PvP. What else can you possibly call a year+ of expansions focuses on instanced PvE? Lol. And no, 1v1 instanced PvP doesn't count.

Did you want to ask for the Nergal maybe?

Tell me how often you have 2 or 3 groups without standings living next to each other in the same WH space? (excluding Thera )

Wile in Sov space this don't happen, it is something normal in NPC nullspace.

Please don't compare then mechanics that work for WH space to totally different area.

Lets be honest if the change with local go live (and i hope it will, i actually like it) wormhole space will be now a "carebear space"       
---
(prove me wrong) You can control who gets in, can close the doors are excluded from the cyno drops .... protected like carebears }:&gt;

You are misrepresenting and wrong, these ships cannot get into novices, also, the comet that killed me was abyssal and linked. But whatever dude enjoy being toxic.

He suggested if you have stabs fitted or if you're in a venture I suppose you don't tick up the timer.
---
Stabbed ships aren't going to be able to tick down the timers in large plexes. But seeing as they can't get in any other size Plex, this only fixes one fifth of the problem, the other four fifths of it is ventures with their built in stabs.

---
Because Nullsec is not WH space.           
---
Most of the ships people fly here don't utilize cloacks, we cannot close the doors like WH carebears can( aka roll holes, and crit statics).         
---
At any point in time someone can light this cyno and 255 man fleet lands on you.                 
---
If you are in your WH then then those  5 guys from your corp are on comms with you probably in same fleet.            
---
You don't have 2 other neutral groups living at the same time with you in the same system.

In NPC nullsec this is normal, you don't see 200+ 'neutrals' a day moving by your wormhole mining their business - but this is normal thing for a nullsec.

Simply mechanics are different in WH space, something that was working in WH space will not work in Nullsec.

There are huge differences between Nullsec and carebear WH space now ;)
---
Yeah, but there are a lot of people on Zkill, so unless another bot or a noob kills them, it'll show up.

I always thought a natural drawback would be agility. Like okay, it's harder to stop you from warping, but it also takes you way longer to warp.
---
Ja echt he hahaha   precies dat
---
It was not about it, so i removed this.         
---
TBH i am happy that it was reduced just by so small number.

For most of the cases it was not players but alts for ratting/mining - and not "primary alt" but the 3rd or 6th one.

CCplz usually in the system that i live i have 5 other people not blue to me from 3 different groups.         
---
There is like 10 people per hour moving ... because there are gates and this is NPC space.                   
---
I cannot lock all the doors like WH can also i have cyno that i need to think about.          
---
CCP please acknowledge now that Nullsec != WH and not after 5 years notice that some areas of game died.
---
You clearly haven’t lived in wormholes
---
You're right, but part of the problem is if you fit them to a ship you don't intend to take fights in, there's little drawback at all.
---
These fw farmers don't intend to ever lock anything. Or look at industrials, or exploration ships. Getting neutered in PVP doesn't matter much because they won't fight or even lock back in most cases, just slam the warp button.
---
A penalty like agility would be relevant to both PVP ships and to zero fight ships.
---
As someone else said, a c2 with a C3 and either a high sec or low sec static (low sec are less in demand) is a good choice by the sounds of it. C3s are great isk for solo/small groups and the k-space static makes logistics easier.

I asked Hillmar about cynos in response to this on Twitter

Is there a discount for moving in to a hole that already has a WDS scout alt in it?

It is pointed out because China's government tries to hide mention of it as it would threaten their hold on power if people learnt the truth.

---
No. If you don’t feel safe in nullsec move to high sec.
---
First of all the discussion of the thread was about FW farming not hauling.
---
Second, hauling just shows how irrelevant the locking penalties of a WCS are. It should be an agility penalty.

On pvp ships agreed. On transport and industry  ships vital

No because after we sell the location and the buyer is in all wingspan alts and toons MUST evacuate the chain and then there is an period of 48hrs of safety, any agents violating that will be severely fined and reprimanded, if this ever happens contact Nikki Ikala, Zeratul Sheppard, Mei Long, or Magnu Stormhawk in game and it will be dealt with

I am also annoyed by the fact that you can add someone to your buddy and, if they haven't reciprocated, they will appear as offline even if you're both docked in the same station.

Elsewhere in the thread I have listed a way to do this without actually hurting agility.

Why would you to give up mining? People mine on WH just  fine. It's the local what they take away, not the moons, you know?

A nice gradual change in mechancis from high to wormhole.
---
Tbh, i quite like it being manual - and i say this as a noob. if you get distracted, or if you forget for a bit, you can get surprised. anyway, from a noobs perspective, the blackout has changed quite a bit - every single gate warp is much riskier, you have to pay much more attention to how you are travelling and the geography of a system you are transitting (ie, is outgate &gt;14.3au away, ok find a celestial that lets me get closer so that i can scan and check the gate is clear). having it do an auto dscan every 30 seconds wouldnt be too terrible i guess, but I quite like that you need to pay attention. to use an FPS comparison, its a bit like checking your corners.
---
it no big deal but its interesting that the site stopped ingesting data as well stopped displaying it. I am fully sympathetic to legacy code issues etc but it would have been really neat to not have to catch up on a few days of data at the end.

They have to add you back familam

Congrats!

...no? it has been pretty in contrast to the weeks prior and being in summer timer.

CCP should also send a guy to fuck your mom. She gets the dick the whole time.
---
3 max scorch bombs kills them. So, someone like me using 6 bombers means you need 4 defenders per rorqual. So your 100m an hour rorqual requires 10b a month in plexed accounts and AI level response time. Does that sound legit to you?
---
Not completely stuiped be better then just siting wait. Maybe add some rats you need to clear every now and then.
---
I don't understand why people move large amounts of Plex.
---
go to highsec
---
...the exact opposite is true
---
In love with the blackout but gotta disagree on this one here. He probably tried to solo and got fed up. I've had quite a few industrials and barges lost to gangs in low sec even with stabs fitted on. Wouldn't be balanced at all, after ECM got nerfed stabs were the only thing that gave an industrialist any chance of escaping. As if being in a pvp fit engaging a ship without guns wasn't easy enough as it is. 
---
One way around it would be to put far heavier target locking penalties and increasing align time if you fit stabs on combat ships compared to industrials.
---
Some guy tried to run them on stream yesterday and his turret went offline because he OHed his armor hardeners and it burnt out his Reactor module, so he didn't have the PG for all his modules. It was funny watching him call for people on stream to come and save him. Somebody actually did and sadly he didn't die
---
Can someone really be that stupid or is it someone trying to fuq with the market?  Asking for a friend
---
Also delete nanofibre bulkheads and other super kitey/slippery modules, buff brawling and hulltanking so everyone can fight like real men instead of in super speedy low risk kitey BS.
---
Well you're also dropping a low slot, do there's an effective yield penalty too
---
Now all I can picture is a drifter be at a papers plz stand yelling. " Detained! " every time a venture shows up.
---
The main issues with WCS now are cases where the pilot never intends to fight at all. In those cases the current drawbacks do nothing. There should be a major agility penalty.
---
Hint how you can manage your danger ... pre seed ships in all systems you want to operate and travel between them in something small and fast.

My old mission running featured rattle/gila/domi/tanked dictor (for some missions, fast T2 resists) in every system i could get a mission.

Thanks to this my last PVE loss is like 4-5 years old.
---
Permeant blackout local isn't fine without more changes to make null actually dangerous
---
&gt;I would agree if you could know if the guy had stabs fit to begin before the engagement. Something like a visual effect around ships with stabs.
---
This is ridiculous, and should absolutely never happen.
---
That would make no sense in this context. If steam is a stupid place to try to get new players..... mobile and console are even worse since the game isn't exactly available there. Just sounds like some edgy kid that thinks calling someone middle aged is funny.

you want to join a corp because NPC corp will be seen as enemy faction alt corp mostly (because its true)  but you can do it solo its just boring

Or employ electronic warfare

Welcome to the game. Just do what you want, everything have pro and cons. I would suggest joining a h.sec corp that can teach you the beginning things you need to know. Then you would have more info to decide what you want to do. Playing solo is doable but a corp is the best way to learn and starting to enjoy the game

Because Null security means Null. Duh.

You CAN make it safe. By Intel gathered for actual players, being active on front of the monitor. You can rat, mine, etc all you want. But you have to do it on the game.

TIL. Yet, not out of trolling, but technically country Russia did not existed during cold war, so you could say it is amongst "rest" and thus third world anyway.
---
While I did like that change, the excitement of seeing notification spam when some group logged in their super fleets was great.
---
Honestly though, with capitals and supers being so commom these days, probably would be constant spam of logins if you had known supers and probably hard to tell if an actual drop was about to happen.

This is only true if you destroy the PLEX after redeeming

Yeah it's all pretty antiquated/irrelevant now and why people just use them to describe rich/poor/so-so countries
---
Maybe Squizz used the opportunity to do some cleanup over the weekend as well and stopped the data processing.
---
Falcon in the same thread said he would straight up delete staba if he could.
---
&gt;Maybe the concept of a rookie frigate being able to keep any size of ship from warping is what's wrong.
---
I agree with this. 
---
A frig being able to stop a carrier from warping makes no sense to me personally.
---
I'd prefer a numbers based system. Eg. A carrier has a core strength (insert number here) at 100%, a pointing frig should do a percentage of that, increasing time taken to get to warp, but not stopping it. This percentage should be bonuses by hulls and skills. Maybe proximity should be a factor too.
---
If your opponent has the relevant skills and is flying a core strengthened ship, you should need to be high skill/flying a bonuses ship to be able to catch them. An increase in time taken to get to warp would mean you have a chance to kill the guy you tackled before you escape, but there's still a risk he may escape. 
---
Also it should take a significant amount of frigs to keep a cap from warping completely, and fewer cruisers, or 1-2 battleships. Maybe we should have more battleships with limited weapons but high survivability, designed to tackle capitals, just like the leshak is designed to shred them.
---
Both Tornado Chars are the usual undock Jita suspects, so people that are dayly out there to pop close to everything that has no instadock spot. Usually I would have said this is RMT, but from the  ganking chars I would say these are two 23/7 undock gankers that just caught an absolute dumbo ....

Everyday.
---
Sure WH and Nullsec are different mechanics.
---
During local blackout you are living in nullsec space, i'm just sayin that the dscan mechanic is the same as it is in wormhole : Hit V or you dont see them coming.
---
(prove you wrong) anomaly dont infinite spawn in WHspace, and there are too many PvP hole roller to safely "carebear" in wormhole space.

Space is dangerous, deal with it.

i prefer to hold em until the  stronger ones come to rescue, then fight something that fights back.

Well if you're not busy I have one for each of you
---
Nope, this sub doesn't give a fuck about PvP. 
---
They care about easy kills Vs people in ships that aren't kitted out to fight back.
---
People always dock when they see me pop up in local. Not because I'm this epic pvp player, but because I'm -10 and red. This change helps me as a solo player for sure. I've been tired of these wuss pilots in null since 2003. I welcome the change.
---
IMO the penalty makes no sense on haulers though
---
Stick to T1 frigates and destroyers.
---
Join an FW corp as soon as.
---
Shameless self promotion here: https://www.reddit.com/r/evejobs/comments/cbdtk5/the_mjolnir_bloc_enlist_now/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Or maybe ECM burst? Or did that also change?
---
Remove logi as well, since it has a huge impact on ships not dying !   
---
j/k but srsly, they need to be nerfed, not removed - my industrials use them all the time and it saved my bacon more than once.
---
But according to this sub, playing Eve in a way they personally don't like is wrong, and should be nerfed to the ground.
---
You shouldn't be able to rat or mine at all. If you do these things to pay for your sub, you're killing the game etc
---
Your posting is shit
---
Because I live in the past, so its new to me
---
remove fixed mass of wormholes ... done
---
I think it's silly that the argument in favour of "D-scan should definitely not be automated" is "getting uses to pressing V every two seconds I do it as muscle memory".
---
I swear some people are completely and utterly against any change whatsoever, unless it's change to somebody else's gameplay that they can take advantage of.
---
Spamming D-Scan is a fucking retarded game mechanic.
---
Move Stabs to mid slot, must be activated, moderate cap cost
---
If you wanna be a complete cunt, make it so in a draw the aggressor wins.
---
Ok so it was definitely a frequency analysis of common complaints.
---
The max a data/relic site will give you in a C3  (unless you spawn the wave early) is 1400 dps. If you have enough of a buffer, you only need to rep somewhere around 1000ehp/s to survive the wave. Most other sites max out at 1000dps. Heck, you can even do some C4 data/relic sites solo, although they're pretty hard.

RIP battle venture
---
Yeah why don't you try these on Pvp/PvE ships, instead of complaining you can't get easy kills Vs miners, who literally cannot fight back.
---
Does it really seem like the correct ships have nullification available to them?
---
Or he can find a way to pay less, like players from many other third world countries already can with Eve. 
---
It’s not that he’s poor, it’s that he’s paying a relatively much higher percentage of his didposable income than other players.
---
But the solution might not be found here, but maybe by talking to CCP through a support ticket.
---
Icelandic players had this problem for a long time after the 2008 financial crisis, but CCP eventually introduced icelandic-only gamecards that made a big difference while the economy was recovering.
---
I guess it's a good thing I didn't say either of those things 😆 I just pointed out that SF decided to pay 12 digit amounts to be safe from someone they declared war on 😎
---
Naw. Just add the ability to cyno in wormholes. It'll be fun to see who adapts or dies.
---
Stories like this were more common before the blackout because the bots were logged in.
---
Transform wormholes into novice plexes.
---
Imagine roaming holes in a dread/carrier collapsing shit as you move through... fuckin' a.
---
If you're 20 jumps out from something, just roll the hole. Only need to roll it 2-3 times before you usually get an entrance that is less than 5-10 jumps to Jita. Or, you know, if you don't want to bother rolling your static, you can actually use your hole for something. Krab, search the chain for krabs to hunt, search the chain for a nullsec exit and roam nullsec; there are tons of things you can do in wormhole space, don't really need kspace unless your fueling or bringing ships in.
---
Ccp cant solve the financial situation around the world. Thats how our system works, you win or loose depending on exchange values and to what kind of goods and services we are talking about.
---
CCP should just remove the granular data from kill mails, hide polot name and fitting and loot, provide only ship type and estimated value so people and skill can still track kills and losses but remove the actual Intel parts.
---
It's not an argument in favour of it, it's just saying if you're not lazy and don't expect easy instant Intel and info it's not hard to get used to d scan. If it was automated I wouldn't mind, I'm just saying it's not like you have to be in the top 1% of elite players to use it well now
---
I have another question;
---
When should I upgrade ships? 
---
I've done the tutorial, and some of the contact missions, and I'm still in the first ship.. 
---
When is a good time to upgrade?
---
I used to be part of the Mostly Intoxicated Alliance, which was under Nulli's Umbrella for a short time. Alot of our corpmates just drifted from the game. I kind of miss the game, but then again, I haven't had much time to play anymore and no friends to play with.
---
Win win
---
Please remove your posting
---
that's not how you write tone deaf...
---
There's no extra cost for issuing another copy of a skin to the store, so there's not much difference in profit department.
---
But my battle venture roams
---
lol. Cry more.
---
Looks like all of July 13 is missing right now :(
---
Would need to blow up a lot more to influence the market.

I'm asking you to broaden your mind somewhat and imagine a "dscan" that wasn't a dscan but a kind-of radar, that pinged automatically, that looked like a radar, with zoom and so on, that showed markers for different ship types, etc. and where the strength of any given signal was related to player skill, boosts, active range and so on.
---
I feel bad for the ones who stick to hs and become bitter in the span of a month but whole heartedly agree with you both.
---
Auto dscan for bots....fuck off no
---
1. Anomaly value in wh space != anomaly value in normal space                
---
2. You can roll in to some other WH prep it for PVE and do the sites there               
---
3. Population in wh space &lt;&lt;&lt; population in null space            
---
4. Wormholers utilizing additional alts in nullsec / lowsec for isk generation while most of null people live only in null                
---
Prove me wrong ... but we are both correct.                    
---
Don't get me wrong.         
---
Observatory arrays will be a thing - sov nullsec will recover some local or maybe all. Who knows maybe the visibility of 'observatory based local will be ACL based' ( lol )  ... but the NPC nullsec will be again hit hard and CCP will ignore fact that it is existing .
---
To be fair supertwinkey only called people the N word with the hard R on days ending in y.
---
Make WH constellations in cyno range of eachother
---
We love new players! As a new character, you don't actually have any significant standings, you can fly into gallente space with no issues. If you get negative standings with a faction, the ships you see on the gates will try kill you. But until then, you're all good.
---
Then you get blapped by the large fleet
---
Sorry I didn't mean to imply that they are bad currently. I was trying more to say that the balance between those ships and a jump freighter needs to be readdressed
---
Like WTF i did not expect this from you.             
---
**Bots will literately auto dscan any way  ....  like this is just piece of code that you can code auto dscan using few additional rows of code .... ****
---
I have a steam account, but I didn't get Eve off steam. Got it directly off ccp website. Can I still pay for sub via steam, how will that work if I don't have the game on steam?
---
No BoB in your list? I'm offended
---
Yep.
---
A lot of people in this thread seem to agree that they are fine on Industrial ships, but keep trying to invent penalties for combat ships. Why not just make them so they can only be fit to Industrial ships? Do we really want combat ships 2 be able to work off without consequence, or with penalties so massive no one would ever use the module?
---
Just because a change is good for you does not mean it's good change.  It's a fine balancing act of getting it right for all affected parties (or as near as you can).
---
At this point just taking out local gives hunters a massive advantage and makes industrial activity in null sec significantly harder, especially if you're not covered by an umbrella.  It seems to be great for PvPers after a couple of days so I'm not saying it's total failure (but I'm curious to see if it's sustainable).
---
That all being said, you have to give something to help the industrialists survive, as nullsec is (or was) being pushed by CCP to be fairly self sufficient.
---
i just started eve too and i am having lots of fun in the Kamela area woth frigates and destroyers
---
Not really, only if the lowsec is withing 2 jumps of the central invasion system.
---
Yup, only one way to find out.
---
Probably lost to FOB rats.
---
I'm not crying, I'm asking you to use anything other than a very skewed sample of non-combat ships when you bitch about the penalties of WCS. 
---
The penalties are designed to be more severe on combat ships, not industrials, and even then you lose a fair amount of mining yield by fitting stabs in lows. A barge, orca or venture has no way to defend itself from an attacker apart from getting out of there. If it can't do that, it will die. 
---
Your post is essentially you complaining that defenceless ships are not even more defenceless, and thus offers nothing of substance. Be better.
---
You understand that it's not the combat abilities of the venture that is the problem, right? FW mechanics mean they can run plexes without being caught. And unless everyone is flying that previously mentioned maulus Navy (and they're not) it's broken as fuck
---
Well it all came down to the final blow on a station, I might be wrong but I seem to recall that it was an SMA guy that had it, had the station flipped to the then CFC it would have been a totally different ending to a incredibly successful campaign and one that you are attempting to besmirch.
---
I don\`t recall them being meme'd by Lowsec groups, are you referring to the Bhargest dunk?  If so that fleet attracted a LOT of attention and so never had that much of a shelf life to begin with.
---
Asher, whether or not you agree, is a superb FC so let us both just agree to disagree.
---
A YOUNG MEERKAT
---
If be against d scan showing different things based on skill points, the type of hull maybe (could give combat ceptors a use). I'm not strongly against something automated I just think even if it was automated some people wouldn't use it.
---
I think the devs have said previously it would not be automated though I could be wrong about that
---
Its a feature I would like and would use but not willing to pay money for it
---
I didn't see the venture part of that in the tweet posted.
---
No idea. Kinda defeats the purpose. Ventures are cheap
---
I ask because I think the have built in stab to
---
I dont see the point with directional scanner or the thread.
---
I, for sure, dont want to get you wrong, so if it can make youa little happy : you are right.
---
But some of the four point you mentioned right here are not true.
---
I honestly don't remember but if they both do you'd still be selling yourself short by not going with the cheaper option.
---
Waiting for the fit !
---
You can still fight in it, it just shouldn't be able to go in the Plex
---
For me it looks that way, yes.
---
Good point. I agree, best way to go about it.
---
Garmur for all team burners, fits on a forum thread. Just don't switch from orbit to keep at range, unless you're very far out. I lost one doing that.
---
Also for team burners, it's slow, but you can use a Griffin with 3 ecm's to almost permanently jam one repair frig and slowly kill the other, then warp out and come back in a kestrel or something better to finish off the other repair frig and the target.
---
These ships are cheap af, so losing them won't set your bank back as much as a garmur would. 
---
Also watch out for the jaguar team burner. It can hit a very rare wrecking shot that will put you in hull immediately
---
Oh yeah but the endurance is much more tough. Only one turret but shield resit bonus and double neut.
---
Idk, only been on 2 roams so far since I resubed the other day.  Maybe I will find things different after some more time in the void.
---
Both times I was able to plot an initial course for entry into nullsec that was devoid of camps.  I did find camps further in, easily spotted by avg players in space and deaths in system spiking.   Used too when they saw you pop in local everyone went in high alert.  I wonder how tiresome it is now.  Interdiction nullified ships have got to be even more impossible to catch. 
---
I've also found a lot more relic sights.  As I have been testing the waters in my exploration fit.  Risk has driven away a lot of null sec explorers it seems.  It's like WH space out there, smashing V as you hack.
---
True, but it still would have gone to something. At this point, that kill just donated $1k to CCP for nothing.
---
34500 to be parsed atm ... parsing around 4/second so it should finish in around 2h 30min after my post.
---
Warp enyo fleet to ceptor tackler. During warp, pre-engage guns, scram, web on all enyos. Lead enyo pilot (squad command), upon landing, approaches target and the regroup fleet command is used. Tab through all accounts and click on the target. You'll see similar damage because it just takes 2-3 ticks to start firing on a target with this method. Some of the enyos did shit because they got neuted. But most were allowed to fire around the same time unabated.
---
Yeah but you're not using it to fight.
---
Secret t1 frigate fit, nice

Strat: https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ccwfvg/multiboxing_reaching_a_new_level_with_the_blackout/etts064/
---
There's a difference between cache and delay.
---
If it's cached for 1hr, and a killmail comes in 3 seconds before I call the endpoint, I have that kill 3 seconds after it happened. If another kill happens 3 seconds _after_ I call the endpoint, I will get it 59m 57s later.
---
Delay is just "this kill won't appear until in the endpoint until its x amount of time old".
---
Yup, and I'm rusty af so you probably saw this over 5-7 seconds. Strat here: 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ccwfvg/multiboxing_reaching_a_new_level_with_the_blackout/etts064/
---
I do it for the memes (but not in those quantities)
---
The penalty should be to agility so you are trading one kind of safety for another kind of safety.
---
Oh, right, but don't know if the range reaches long/faction points.
---
FROM A POOR FAMILY
---
Hilmar is a God for making this decision. He basically told the entire Eve community to "get gud scrub" and we love him for it.
---
Just remembered there is one niche use for having stabs on combat ships. Transporting them! So you only fit to combat ships when you gotta move them around, in which case people wouldn't mind the massive penalties. For the broke plebs (like me) that don't own a JF ofc.
---
Induce warp delay in FW sites or allow bubbles in FW Sites
---
Stabs are a solution to a problem caused by several prior fuck ups . . .
---
The counter is warping off before you get tackled, not waiting to get tackled then warping off.
---
So without stabs i have to die to every fucking camp ? Or maybe scout with mandatory covertops alt every jump? Or have cyno with superblob? How am i suppose to move without bunch of alts covering me?
---
Isn't he talking about the procurer?
---
Legacy? [zk github](https://github.com/zKillboard/zKillboard) was updated 3 days ago.
---
because it wasn't good gameplay and just a lore event to introduce the local change and create a bit of chaos
---
They have lock range penalty already
---
That's the part I'm 'supposing'
---
I know. I live there. Shhh... don't tell anyone I am a goon. It's a secret.
---
&gt; Eve has great PvE content
---
Are you serious?
---
Eve's PVE is among the worst of any MMO that's still popular.
---
To be fair, it was a RedSwarm operative, so more RA than Goons.
---
Nice that he thinks the only counter-play to warp disruption is tone def and boring.......
---
the thing is, alliances and corps in null spread over multiple system. In wh there is a name for it "hole control" you defend your own wh-system by rolling statics and random wh going to your home base...ones there no one can slip through and cyno a fleet in. Either they are there or they don't keep shooting their scanners in your wh and you are safe. I acknowledge that you have to roll a static to find some ratting space...but again limited amount of engagement there are plenty system to roll to, not every C4 or higher has some baddies living in it.
---
how the f\*\*\* do you wanna engage "system control" in null? cynojam them - done, keeping an eye on the gates to this system...k, we can do that. Roll spawning wh and guarding spawned ones - quite possible. As soon as a single covert cyno goes up, you have unlimited number of neutrals on you. And that in every system in region. The highest amount you can earn with 1 character is about 250 mil/hr...what was it in wh? Twice at least? So you earn your plex in a single session? So you tell me that null is as much dangerous as previous one and as much as profitable. It much riskier than before, and less rewarding.
---
D-Scan doesn't save you from covert ops. System control in null is impossible. No one does that. Not for a whole region.
---
I'd like to see some combination of D-Scan and build-in automatic Radar for like in film Aliens. The target is in warp or you are in warp you see it as a moving dot. You land or the target lands on any grid it disappear from Radar entirely  and can only be seen on D-Scan. Keep the current ships and equipment excepting you from D-Scan, remove local if you wish so, but compensate it with something practical for null.
---
Fuck I hate warp stabs, I've been solo roaming Scalding Pass and every fucking vni/ishtar/etc bot is stabbed.
---
&gt; Personally, when it comes to WiS, I hold Torvi to blame for a lot of it
---
Your "blame" is entirely misplaced.
---
Also, "blaming" people does nothing but form a culture where thinking outside the box never happens and progress is heavily stunted.
---
Accountability is everything and learning from mistakes is key, but **blaming** people and chastising them for trying something new is a decent way to kill a project.
---
Spicy. Let's see what time period we broke the kills/hr record for! Here's hoping for all time!
---
You speak as though every WH'r stops crabbing to close every hole all the time, every time.
---
You CAN do it, just like a null'r CAN dscan constantly. But most wont and learn to live with a modecrum of risk in their activity.
---
WH has greater reward for the risk. The ability to drop a save fleet still makes null a safer bet in most cases.
---
Keep WH and null different!
---
Please? I don't understand why they can enter plexes.
---
I'd love it if there was a spool up timer on jump drives so that it took longer to drop on people. 15-30 seconds would be good.
---
Oh also, no more supers in lowsec... and only covert cynos. 
---
If people want to field regular caps in lowsec, make them use gates to move them around.
---
This is why I'm not a Game Designer ;)
---
Yes, I've had bots do that all weekend. We were killing a shitload of them in Wicked Creek, they ran out of ships, and they just kept trying to rat in pods. Pop the pod, more come.
---
Warp into the site cloaked at 100 in a ceptor or astero with MWD. From there burn away into one direction straight until you are like 300km away from the gate center. Make bookmarks like every 100km.
---
After that, you warp back to the gas site and do the same into the exact opposite direction. In total you should have 7 bookmarks. 3 on each site, 1 center.
---
You will use a raven fitted with enough sebos to lock up to 300km and enough missile computers to have cruise missiles reach out for at least 250km (the more the better). So the raven will be cruise missile fit. Full DPS-mods in lows and a 500MN MWD. Use the rest of your slots to have something for cap (it increases your runs before warping).
---
Now if the rats spawn, you warp in your raven to one of the bookmarks so you can lock and hit the sleepers. If they start locking you and burning towards you, you burn away from them in the straight lines of the bookmarks you made ... You will get a feeling, when you're too fast, so you turn off your MWD for one run ... when you're far enough away and they are like 150km away from you, you simply turn and warp to one of the bookmarks on the other site, optimally so you can directly start shooting after you landed ... then you burn into the other direction, they will follow you again ...
---
So at the end, you will kill them one by one and always warp if necessary and burn as long as you like or can ... so they will always turn come for you and turn back and come for you again. I guess you get the point. :)
---
As I said in previous posts, above, I'm against that. That's literally the point of my posts ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
&gt; Killed In Action
---
Killerz In Action ;)
---
There were a few people in KIA who used to go mental when I got this wrong and used Killed In Action to troll them :D
---
how about this: wormholes get local, but it's jita local only. this way you're in constant danger of getting cancer and/or aids on top of that of having your ship blown up.
---
Step 1 - Move to Russia.
---
Guess so
---
;'D
---
A dumbo who probably just RMTed the plex.
---
an epithal doesnt use his cargohold and can't expand the PI cargo hold with low slots for example.
---
On one hand you're complaining about stabbed ships, on the other you seem hostile the idea of such a ship being used as bait and actually fighting with it. :P
---
Been trying to 'splain that to people but they just do not get it.
---
Neither does CCP apparently. 
---
Each and every time you frick over peoples preferred play style while you might get some initial benefit including free pub/buzz, you will also lose a certain amount of people and even those you don't lose immediately are one step closer to the door.
---
Each and every time you frick over peoples preferred ship/fitting, ESPECIALLY if its something they put a good deal of time and ISK into,  while you might get some initial benefit including free pub/buzz, you will also lose a certain amount of people and even those you don't lose immediately are one step closer to the door.
---
Sure you get an ego boost and free pub/buzz and fan boys who know NOTHING about business.
---
But mark my words...EVERY nerf, EVERY stunt, EVERYthing that doesn't retain customers you already have means you will have to spend more the replace the ones you lose.
---
You think it's some kind of joke that people call quitting EVE "Winning EVE?".
---
Just
---
You
---
Wait.
---
how about fix wormholes not populating on the other side unless u warp to it
---
remove c4 space
---
disband tdsin and pospy
---
make being in a site perma scram as long as rats around (fuck mjd rattles)
---
nevertheless, nerfing one module that is accessible for all ships might solve one of the FW's problem but create new one for other activities.
---
Your surrender is accepted.
---
My kill marks and loss mails say otherwise.
---
Chance for CSM
---
CCPlease turn off the dscan in WH.
---
With keepstars those characters are logged in all the time now.
---
We had a delivery of about 600 gallons of danger from Lazerhawks and Tuskers all weekend, just get in on it. 10/10 would lose fight to Tuskers again.
---
no. the nergal is good for some of them. in particular for the blood raider burner, maybe the serpentis one too. but the damavik is pretty bad.
---
While it is helpful to try and keep people from dying...
---
it's kind of sad that a lot of gameplay in eve comes down to "don't experiment or innovate, just use premade lists of things to fly". I saw one of the recent eveNorth talks on youtube about the guy using his megathron in all kinds of fleets and fitting accordingly to "fit in". Not optimal, but if it works, and the player enjoys it, that sort of shenanigans should be encouraged.
---
Sadly, i haven't even touched any of the triglavian ships so i'm terrible on giving actual advice on how one could fit a damavik well for this.
---
I expect if you looked at the metrics you will see less people, on average, undocking.  People that PvE as a main part of their game in Null will either not log in and even if they do will be less engaged with the game.  
---
In the short term Rorquals will not undock in high numbers and if they do, it will be under a cap umbrella more often than not.  
---
If this goes long, a good number will just unsubscribe and/or extract the mining accounts.  The ones that keep at it will shift away from excavators to miner II.  They may or may not extract the Rorquals and inject barges if they really love mining.  That said, most people love the money and low APM game play more than mining.  
---
People that are hunting will find, after the stupid and the careless PvE people stop logging in or move to high sec (give it a few weeks) that all there will be in Null are supers and Rorquals under a cap umbrella and a lot of people watching Netflix in their Titans and supers waiting for a cyno to go up. Pretty much as it was before ‘blackout’ but will less people as targets and a larger percentage of them more prepared.  
---
Small groups without a cap umbrella will ship down into disposable PvE ships I expect.  
---
I of course could be totally wrong, but we will know in a few weeks once things settle out.
---
&gt; making mining and ratting even less fun.
---
after half a decade of buffs to mining and ratting...
---
I'm unwilling to throw Ravens at the scrams, at least Ravens blingy enough to take 1900 dps. I'm still thinking about kiting. From [here](http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=30196) I learned that attack range is 75k. Can someone confirm that this applies to all weapons, especially the neuts? If that's true, should be easy to kite with a couple of destroyers or smth.
---
Garmur, arty Wolf, jaguar, beam retribution
---
That should've been a reply...
---
Talking shit is easy. Better be ignored.
---
L2dscan nullbear
---
While refreshing to have it down. It's nice to have it back as an out of game experience where I can check up on what my guys have been up. I hope ccp does visit this and implement some sort of delay so we can get the best of both non-instant intel and qually AAR.
---
Are they exempting themselves from PvP, or are they forcing potential attackers to make a choice between an optimized fitting for general PvP, or a weaker fitting designed to catch stabbers?
---
I thought the point of EVE was each alliance chest beating on reddit.
---
Well kiting in Cruise Ravens is the answer apparently...
---
lol idiot!
---
Add scrams to battleships in C5/C6 sites 🙃
---
Zkill just provides a crazy amount of information not available. Imo it was perfect to have it disappear with local.
---
First one will only be a real option if they rebuff ISK from sites so that it’s profitable to run sites as a Corp again.
---
My experience hasn't been as good as yours, but it's been better than usual. I think it will improve once Frat gets bored of 23/7 redlight, no bots, comms discipline, lockdown where they can only enter 4 systems.
---
I am starting to wish I wasn't in Test, however, as shooting test seems to be the #1 content generator of the weekend, and for once it was fun. :)
---
I bagged a sabre, couple cynos, vni, and not much else solo, everything was either docked up or stabbed. Need to go somewhere else.
---
nope, RMT happens on safespots, not on the most populated (and loot botted) undock in New Eden ...
---
Can confirm, I daily undo the work of the other militia using my army of Ventures. I lose the occasional one to a dedicated fit or a bling scram but they cost a couple of mil each with a tank.
---
What about disable dscan in wh space? :3
---
Yeah, I think they need to make the cost appropriate to nullsec income if they're going to do that. Like, we're talking a trillion isk structure.
---
Of you do NPC missions, it's best to avoid those against an opposing empire faction, because you lose standing with them. Most of the time you are offered missions against pirates, which is what you want.   
---
Pay attention to the mission description and you'll be fine.
---
It would be nice if Bridging could be on something less expensive than a multi 10s of billions of isk Titan. I know there are BLOPS but only covert ops capable and equipped ships can use that.
---
ya dun goofed
---
They can 100% block ventures from entering. They even said when they made the change to block stabbed ships entering that they would be closely monitoring how much use the venture then received as a deplexing ship. Which is a lot.
---
Lot players face these issues in 3rd world countries. Steam had regional pricing system that ccp can take advantage of. But sadly they don’t and thus lose good chunk of players...
---
Yeah, that actually says a lot about the "elite pvp hunters". Removing local is not enough, now they need to remove stabs as well because they still suck too much to catch their targets. How about another patch, that instantly sets the speed of all ships in anoms to zero and disables their warp drives for ten minutes when the "elite pvp hunter" enters the system. Maybe then you'd be able to actually catch something.
---
Facwar pvp is very regimented and ordered. Nullsec pvp, you never REALLY know if you're hunting or being hunted, but it's very rarely "gud fites" if you're solo. It's submarine warfare.
---
I've personally gotten more fights on null in the past 2 days than the past two months.
---
Man between this and the drifters ots almost sounding like I should come back
---
No you cant pay for account which is not made via steam.
---
Thank you for an excellent reply! This sounds like a fun thing to try.
---
Please don't hurt my heart like this
---
Step 2 give regional pricing on steam.
---
Explain your situation, be nice about it. Maybe.
---
Why
---
even if it's a high-traffic gate is boring, F1 monkeys at least get to warp around the system and anchor up. Gate campers just straight up F1
---
Way longer...it's parsing around 7k an hour and it has a backlog of like 28k. Considering how quickly kills are happening it will take a long time to catch up.
---
For reference: It's been parsing kills the entire time, I believe...it just wasn't displaying them. It's literally backlogged because of how many kills have been happening.
---
Any time capital class ships move at the same agility on to the field of combat, you've got a broken mechanic that removes all need for actual strategy and being able to pin and hold combatants down long enough for the reinforcements to arrive (rather than just charge in with a cheap fast ship, drop the light and blob someone).
---
My three step plan for fixing this would be.
---
1. Significantly increase the cost of any ship capable of deploying a cyno and make it a meaningful loss if it's caught.
---
2. Limit the deployment of cyno to "off field" - i.e not within 250KM of any ship that isn't within your fleet.
---
3. Temporarily off-line all weapons and active modules for say 45 seconds post cyno jump
---
Any one of those three would create enough change to make an impact, but all three would bring back tactics to the way cynos are used,  rather than just the boring "oh shit, its a roaming fleet of enyos, drop the caps" button they've become....
---
Example fit according to specs provided by /u/Pinkylein .

**!CAUTION!** I didn't test it but it shoots 840DPS to 297km and locks to 300km (assuming All v which you clearly won't have...)

Thats still the best way to buy omega    i just buy a whole year of omega   and yesterday i bought 2860 plex to sell for isk
---
I'll be honest I'd be more afraid of assault frigs than T3Ds, as your rapid lights will have more trouble applying to an mwding retri than to a T3 with its prop off. Armor svipuls maybe notwithstanding, but they're made of paper so who cares?
---
Get some friends to scout for you in this multiplayer game.
---
I saw a LOT more ratters out around 0300 last night than for the rest of the weekend, and a ton of bots. They're coming back out of their holes.
---
I also bought 100 euros worth of plex yesterday and sold it for 10 billion isk
---
Who rats in a wolf?
---
Yup. I wanted to hit frat space and fight some defense fleets, but they locked everything down all weekend, so we ended up spending most of it fighting Tuskers.
---
Took like 3 days!
---
Ok please go use .completely useless ship that isnt for burner missions
---
Have you been done burner missions?
---
Wait that enyo gang was a multiboxer? Damn, it would have been a lot easier to kill him knowing that.
---
Roamed scalding last night, bots are back
---
Why on earth would they choose the acronym "KIA" if they didn't want people to call them "Killed In Action"? lol
---
and now you are focusing on the color of the post instead of its core.
---
fucking racist.
---
Good fights.
---
Says the guy who go with a cloaky nullified tengu and only engages when it's safe to do.  Also, there isn't such thing as "ratters". People in nullsec rat to finance their pvp, it's an additional activity for most of them. It's the way to earn cash in nullsec, and you're demonizing it as if it were "playing wrong". Is Industry also "playing wrong"? is Commerce and Hauling also "playing wrong"? Eve is not an arcade fighting game only.
---
This... start anchor at 4:00 eve time.
---
It makes the game fun, you can now spend your isk on having fun and not scrounging for existence.
---
Whose dick do I have to suck to make this a reality
---
This would be memes but it would destroy the economy in wh space quite well since you could not roll your static to make isk.
---
Plexing bots can't stab anymore (except to d-plex larges) so they switched to ventures.
---
CCP laughing all the way to the bank
---
Yep. As a PvPer I hate stabs. But they have their uses. I have no problem when they are fit to an Industrial ships that can't fight. Or in the hold for refitting if you are rolled out.
---
One of the best hunts I ever had was a Rattlesnake that was trying to escape through our holes chain after he was rolled into it. He had a full rack of stabs and the ensuing hunt was brilliant.
---
Just bring a HIC. 100% of my lowsec industrial lossmails have HICs on them.
---
I replied asking him if he could delete cynos and he liked the tweet so...
---
That's why I trust Smith and Wesson to respond in time and appropriate numbers.
---
Sorry, no cargo on board of freighter or indy can make it economically profitable to scout ahead using live players, those players can make more isk farming green.
---
I like the blackout, it makes pilots bond together.
---
You could.
---
He's not saying remove mass limits, he's saying remove FIXED mass limits.
---
Meaning a c4-c5 wormhole could spawn with any amount of mass, not a strictly defined small deviation.
---
That legacy wyvern should have had a better owner.
---
&gt;For context as to why, I am from a third world country,
---
Whenever I left j space it would annoy me that I had to make room for a local chat window.
---
oh yes, a little code fix makes legacy code vanish.?  
---
Eve (or any mmorpg I guess) is updated daily but are still full of legacy code.....
---
Aw so cute. Can we keep him ??
---
I do not know, but I will be sharing the load with you.

&gt;Also watch out for the jaguar team burner. It can hit a very rare wrecking shot that will put you in hull immediately
---
anyone can. Just so unlikely on anything  other than jaguar that you statically need several universe to be shot.
---
I orbit the jaguar at max range (30km) and got shot only once in years. Still very scary.
---
Consider joining RvB.  We're in FW now on the Caldari side and we welcome all newbros.

Here's our recruitment FAQ:

---
It answers your ship type question and a lot more.
---
There's a lot of narrative in that list lol.
---
Falcon discovering his old VETO soul ... what a time to be subbed
---
Make jumping a wormhole a spooling action that takes 30 seconds. That will stop the wangspin nerds from orbiting B274 amirite
---
I agree with this. I for one, would like to experiment with stabbed PVP fits for fighting outnumbered and getting out if successful.
---
NOT IF I CATCH HIS LOAD FIRST
---
150% increase to align time per stab. Quadruple stabbed? You'll probably die before entering warp.
---
Wolfsdragoon used to be a great FC, I flew under him in galmil and respected him. Then he turned into this wackjob who just ran bots and shat up local, he's completely lost it. The list of places his small remaining entourage has been kicked from is growing very, very fast lol.
---
Why not just dissallow ships fit with WCS to enter FW complexes. Hey presto, problem solved. They have their uses elsewhere...
---
If you hover over it it will tell you.
---
It generally means there is no way to complete that order. If it's sell immediate, then it means nobody is willing to pay the price you listed.
---
Whaaaaat this is awesome
---
True that
---
Not uncommon for travel fits if you're gonna be stuck using a kickout or some such.
---
This is drifting towards reverse-bukkake.
---
Thanks
---
Why you gotta go shaking up our doctrine like that??
---
Yes and yes.
---
It's hard to tell if we're talking about good FCs or narratively influential FCs. If the former, Elo, Vee, PGL, Travis, and maybe a couple others have no business on that list. If the latter, I think the only ones I would strongly contest are Vily and Twinky. It's really hard to read a list of the greatest FCs in eve without Patriot.
---
And then? Those PLEX aren't "gone" yet, they just went to that other guy. Now he can use them to sub or buy Skins or something. At which point, then they will have gone towards something on CCP's end.
---
When they disappear in a kill, they go to CCP w/o any return for the players.
---
Which bots? Plexes don't let stabs in except larges. That's why venture  are so fucking ubiquitous.
---
Wait what? The ability to avoid bubbling is bad?
---
EvE players seem to follow the "stuff I struggle with is a bad design" creedo a bit too much
---
Welcome back! hope you'll also play a bit!
---
Nullsec is now really fun to roam through (it even was without zkill and dotlan)
---
This is bait.
---
0/99
---
He is mine
---
Yeah, like that doesnt get old real fast. After rolling a wh 500 times it just gets to be a chore rather the fun game play. add in c1 static max mass and thats a real fun time. 
---
&gt;Look at all these fun things to do! 
---
Like the hole hasnt been emptied of anoms and sigs for the last few days and you arent fueled for the next two months and rolling holes is all you have been doing for the last hour.  Wh gets boring. At least there is the option to mine more often now.
---
This just one of those things that happens, Wh will get boring by itself, you will get yourself podded out , or the wh wh will roll on you, so you need a scout alt to get you back in. You may have an unknown number of minutes left on your statics so you are waiting for it to roll. You may be linked to someone largers staging wh so you are waiting for them to roll it. Anoms may take a while to respawn so you are waiting for that. All four may happen. Wh can get boring.
---
So you mean you could go through C4 to C4 with carrier? Holy shit that would be some dank memes and make c4 isk actually decent.
---
Fake?
---
It is seriously the best change in years
---
Whenever you have the isk to replace what is lost in comparison with the risk/reward
---
:smilingdrifterface:
---
My favorite destroyer.
---
Bad bot
---
Not sold on putting it in empire space. I'm not even sold on putting it in NPC space period. No local in facwar would just lead to even more boring recon camps and neutral tackle alt shenanigans, and make it very difficult to find fights. It's a very different environment from null, and I think it needs to stay that way.
---
Tell the dispatcher that you think theres someone trying to break in and the a cop will be there in 2-5 minutes.
---
Tell the dispatcher that you just shot the guy who tried to break in and half the cops in town will be at you door in 30-45 seconds.
---
Remove statics all wormholes now have 3 random wandering connections
---
yea definitely. Are combat recons viable now?
---
Madness this would make rattlesnakes die
---
Move to null-sec...
---
lol
---
It doesn't. It's only like 6,000m range unless you're in a Scorpion.
---
Nah most of them rat to fill bars, I keep having to roam our own space to "recruit" people in my own damn corp. Now I don't have local so I can't even do that.
---
Yeah even in a stab Plex free world larges are still absolutely packed with ship with stabs. Even some real players will farm plexes with them because it's so low risk.
---
it was drekavac
---
You can make some of them work. Would still definitely prefer stratios or t3c. Especially loki is very powerful
---
screenshots or it didnt happen
---
You're picking nits. I'm saying the number of ratters and FW people are a relatively high percentage of stab users.
---
The bigger problem is the 100mn fit almost every ratting VNI uses. Running dual scram or scram longpoint takes away room for webs, and frankly if an AFK ratter or bot cannot be solo killed there's a serious balance problem.
---
Then there's the VNIs that are built to fight back, which is backing up something I've been saying for years, that hull is COMPLETELY BUSTED...but hey. They're changing it at least, and we'll see where it sits on the balance chart after that. It seems to be the new VNI is a very abusive ship for its niche, but its niche (drone supported medium blaster brawling) is very weak right now due to the AF meta.
---
wait, we have to read?
---
Have a repair laser for ventures... why not
---
0010101101011102
---
This would be neat but, you know that the null empires might take wh space as a highway for force projection though.
---
Reads like trump tweet
---
Because a lot of people are risk averse and absolutely terrified of being called out on it.
---
you sound new...
---
Well that's part of the game and in end I did find RAZOR.
---
Usually titles are not worth the read or bait, that's why I stopped reading them
---
Yes this would be ideal.
---
How about dscan makes you a warpable object in the overview if they are in range, cloak or no. Like a sonar ping giving away location
---
Mr. Mossberg sits right behind the front door. He has a 500 point safety check for everyone that rings the bell.
---
Looks like even hillmar can say something smart once in a while.
---
On the other hand, a stopped clock shows good time twice a day, so it doesn't have to mean anything.
---
&gt; Why not just make them so they can only be fit to Industrial ships?
---
Exactly right.
---
Add some randomness, yes the holes are you get are random, but once mapped it's easy to move around. A fewer things that would shake it up:          
---
Make 1-way wormholes, this property is undetected until you go through it.         
---
Hydra-holes, which can have more than 2 points in space randomly exit picked.        
---
Remove fixed mass limits, give every hole the same random range.
---
Whoever was asking for delayed killboard stats, your wish appears to have been temporarily granted.
---
yea i mean the curse is good but little low dps but since the announcement of the blackout the price spiked kinda hard. so not that viable.
---
Or just don't give a damn and go for anything (PVP 100mn VNI is pretty fun :) ) cause hitting V appears to be very hard for the average 0.0 citizen. And you could also hide with naming your ship RandomDudeWhoIsInAlliance's Vexor Navy Issue
---
As a daoc player, we played daoc with the pvp statistic broken during 10 years. Most important is fun IG, not a killboard.
---
I have lots more bad suggestions of how I'd like to see EVE.
---
I'll let you rest for now though! ;)
---
Well you shouldn't have.
---
Make it so only the real heroes play in WH space ... DSCAN can only arc to 5 degrees.
---
don't know about putting it in low sec. Maybe we could have it delayed (as in literally, 60 second delay or something) , but having full blackout will:
---
- Make low sec feel even deader than it is
---
- increase blobbing shenanigans in FW (anti-fun for solos/duos/trios, FW being the only place we can actually enjoy the game this way now)
---
- be practically un-counterable as we can't drop bubbles to defend gates/increase reaction time
---
the only benefit it has is it would make hunting a little bit easier but honestly low sec is so dead that it won't matter much, and I worry it will scare away the targets i'd hunt anyway.
---
For the record I am a solo low sec PVP player.
---
Nice to see that despite Null being loads of fun again. Reddit is still as cancerous as ever.
---
He means the total mass before collapse dingus
---
Well you choose the wrong hole if you're in a C1. There's a reason it's even bad for solo corps. Timezone tanked C3 is probably just as safe with much more isk and action.
---
It's only boring if your goal is only krabbing (like it sounds like you are). Your better off in null if you want krabbing (especially in a C1, god, do you hate yourself?). There's always action if you go down your chain, if you go roam in nullsec through the chain. Most wormholers do a healthy mix of pvp and pve. If you're there just for the pve, then I can understand why you are so bored.
---
And?
---
You act as if it is no big deal to fetch and parse thousands of kills lol, it has nothing to do with legacy code
---

---
&gt; Are you assuming that WCS stay mechanically the same?
---
I'd leave them as is and restrict ship type (Indy, Barges, Porp). The existing penalties would apply to miners and indys who use tractors to hoover cans.
---
Fatal Ascension died to Fountain, so did Li3 Federation. 
---
With our job complete, Sorry we are in your space EH faded into the Abyss as well.
---
Good Times.
---
no what i wanted to say was more that actually you can calculate almost exactly how much you get through till it collapse. not having fixed total mass for c1-c6 would it make more of a surpise if you get all your ships through or not ... or if you get stuck by rolling the static. Of course you would need to get rid of the info massages, like half mass or verge of collapse, too.
---
The only one increasing net cancer is you. We know the blackout is here and its great you can stop spamming now.
---
Many of us have specialized venture hunting fits... Typically Maulus navy with a T2 / abyssal / faction scram and a scan res &gt; 1200.
---
If people used endurance, we'd just do it in gang rather then solo / pairs.
---
Most of the ventures are near AFK alts or bots. Like there's a new wave of minmatar venture bots that are plexing amarr novices right now and they are the stupidest bot I've seen yet. As soon as someone lands on the gate of their plex they warp to the sun at 0.
---
remember when the jita monument was for Burn Eden solving a riddle and the introduction on t2 warp core stabilizers
---
I say keep it in null but I don't know about extending it to low sec. Low sec already has enough trouble attracting people. Maybe it can be incentive for people who want local. High sec is..well...high sec.
---
Why you so salty dude? Did someone kill your krab ship?
---
Ahh, yeah
---
Give it a try. I mean: lowsec is (outside of a frigate complex) not rly better than null was before the blackout....
---
just let the highsec carebears and newbros sit in their 'local bubble' and make eve dangerous (again) outside of the concord umbrella
---
Dotlan and zkill help new players learn the game through fits and the active intel they can acquire. I believe removing/nerfing these only helps the large power blocs who can assemble their own intel within their regions of control. Slowing down the updates to zkill means I can't vicariously partake in some epic nullsec battle seeing the live kill reports come in. It wouild ruin the little spectator aspect that exists in eve beside watching my favorite Jebi go non-stop jumping point to point through empty FW zones. 
---
Further more, Im not sure how ESI works in the guts of it but if its at fault for the many issues I have with tripwire tracking on a day to day basis I'd like to see that fixed before any major changes.
---
Holy crap, we need a visualization for just around the blackout period too.
---
You could just leave a sbing be on the sun in them case's lol.
---
I don't have any problem with stabbed ships. Well ok maybe a little, but my only real opposition is them being able to capture plexes. Werebear fleets are fun.
---
Yea     i needed the isk   but for me it doesnt matter better buy plex to get some extra isk then the whole skill injector/extractor thing that ruines the skills
---
oh im retarded F. That would be way too weak tho. If we going the route making things HC in wh might as go all the way.
---
Until CCP releases the Drifters in wormholes that find you everywhere you are and that turn you into minced meat every unless you’re in a ship with the most expensive fit being repped by a fleet of rappers and then only harvest mediocre loot when you finally, after a 7 hour fight, manage to kill the Drifter.
---
Then you’re going to whine about it being too dangerous.
---
lol it's cool. It's been a long time since many of those existed, so its easy to forget. May was 12 years since I started EVE, so I'm sure I'm forgetting some myself.
---
I do want to give a special shout to my favorite FC though, Scooter1. That man led us into so many fights when we were outnumbered massively and still came out ahead in the end. I'm sure any -A- guys who are here remember him very well lol. Miss ya buddy wherever you are.
---
They're all still salty
---
This is how offensive plexing works.
---
Yeeeeeees
---
The behavior of reduced mining will always lead to a reduction of mined ore.  There’s literally no way to reduce mining and increase mined ore.  
---
Mined ore will be down because players are using lesser efficient mining equipment AND are spending less time in the belts.  In a general sense.  Yes some of the big guys will continue to mine with excavators under the Titan umbrella.  Outside that you’ll see a lot of skiffs.  
---
Like to the point if you see a rorq out anywhere remotely risky just assume it’s bait.
---
I would agree that an actual timed delay would be ideal -- instant if you post in local, or get flagged/do something to take a sec hit  (which, for bonus points, even fits in cannon/lore, since CONCORD still tracks security standings in Low Sec, it would make sense this would be done through the 'fluid routers' that support local)
---
Yeah I mean on the defence. Having hostile rat warp in
---
I say try it in one or two lowsec regions, see what happens.
---
PLEX price in RUB there is about the same as the plex price in USD for EU/US. They have a huge discount only for the direct subscription payments.
---
Falcon never lost his VETO ways tbh. He's always said if he was in charge of EVE, it'd be a deadly hellscape of fuck you, and I'm honestly kind of down for that as long as it's well thought out.
---
https://i.imgur.com/5ZIPK.gif
---
This would only lead to rolling static with bs having 0 fit in it.
---
For sure dude.
---
Some guy caught a bot!  That never happened before blackout, there were no tutorials describing how to easily catch them.
---
Hell yes.  I'm enjoying EVE so much more with the blackout. I like that feeling of you never know who's in the system with you.  I hope it stays this way for good.
---
Weird. The solution is simple - there should be no feedback from the game saying if the player is or isn't online. "Invite sent" is all you see. If you were offline, once you log in, you get the message saying "xxxx invited you to the fleet (hh.mm dd.mm.yyyy)." or something like that.
---
&gt; Spoken like a true middle-aged gamer 
---
No shit.  
---
You thought the target audience for potential new players on EvE were 12yo playing Fortnite and shitty mobile games all day?
---
Steam playerbase is probably their best fishing spot after consedering all their options.
---
Local chat is more for fun in low sec tbh.
---
Loli like how you twist words. You should join the goons.
---
Because there are a lot of risk averse people reading this thread and shitting themselves at the thought their "combat" ships can't moonwalk away from hostiles.
---
I never thought I would agree with hilmar
---
Please dear baby jesus yes.
---
666 upvotes, a message has been sent!
---
If the blackout is the only way to find bot activity, how did we know they existed in first place?
---
&gt; a deadly hellscape of fuck you
---
truck yeah
---
So the problem is that the venture doesn't have a stab fitted. It's a built in bonus. It's why they can still take acceleration gates. Ships with stab modules fitted already can't get in. Except the larges. No gate.
---
I put mine in a tabbed window with dscan, then made dscan even bigger than it was.
---
It was glorious.
---
That won't make eve dangerous, it will just make nobody bother going to facwar, because the balance of information warfare already favours the ganker too heavily. If it becomes "null but safer for ganking", they'll just all move to null.
---
Having local chat on-screen with about seventy percent of the window being basically null and unused always bothered me. It always looked so ugly too. Glad I won't have to worry too much about having a seperate window for local.
---
Make dscan not work in w space. That would be comical
---
This doesn't seem right. Maybe /u/squizz could explain more?
---
Yer gonna want some istabs, warp stabs, stabbers, and at least one backstab just to be safe.
---
warp with zero capacitor in a path that crosses the deadspace pocket and run out of cap in the area you want?
---
Burn from the edge of the deadspace pocket to the warpin?
---
If these are not it, please tell me how.
---
Here's a cookie for you Sir
---
o7
---
Ah, a capsuleer of culture I see.
---
There are multiple reasons for safety, stabs might be one of them but not the sole reason. 
---
I don't know the symptoms FW has but hammering on a module that is used in other parts of the sandbox as well doesn't make any sense at all.
---
Shift+drag unpinned window above overview and you can create a tab without using anymore screenspace.
---
Quite sure the answer will be "NO". They have their own rules regarding this.
---
Which is different from the current state of facwar... how?
---
To stop it being abused by botters?
---
Yeah, ban them.
---
Nothing to grand just something to shoot.
---
Can't see lowsec without local tbh it would probably ruin it
---
The fact that so much of EVEs "high end" pve content is routinely botted is a damning testament to its shallowness and simplicity.
---

Amen
---
Been looking for a solid fit. What do you use?
---
I used to farm FW this way last year. It's so boring and disappointing. But if it isn't the venture it'll be another cheap frigate fit unfortunately.
---
I noticed some back to but they died 👍
---
just remove all POS, spawn more drifters and polarize for 10 minutes everytime you jump through a WH... remove D-scan in high tier WH´s and add a new anti cloak effect to some of the usual WH effects.
---
Local blackout won't be the best until throw in the other needed mechanics that'll really make it unsafe
---
Sounds like a you problem.  Have you tried not being a little bitch all the time?
---
What other mechanic changes would you suggest? Ide love to see things get even more dangerous.
---
i do love no local in null but i think that low should be less hardcore than null, and jspace should be more hardcore than null. i think that low should keep local and the blackout in null should be permanent. 
---
funfact: excavators had halved in price and curses have doubled.
---
Give it the unicorn sparkle vomit paintjob that that megathron had.
---
Having the watchlist show if someone was online actually was pretty fun for hisec wardeccers. You actually hunted the target corp instead of simply camping Jita.
---
Is this the thread where I as affected Lowsec Citizen have to cry now that I cannot do my PvE anymore without being on my "dscan"-heels every second? What if I told you that it was this way also with local anyway ?
---
Right.  So it makes sense to you that pilots can enter a warp gate on one side and exit on the other side totally undetected by the owner.  OMFG you can not even do that on a toll road with Earth’s troglodyte (by comparison) camera technology today, never mind the super advanced fictional tech in eve.
---
I usually orbit at 25, so that likely affected it. 
---
And yeah that's a good point regarding signature radius.
---
Yeah ikr, killing newbro retards is always such a great past time
---
Only if you go to frat space it's good to keep it open. Or did they stop using it as an Intel channel?
---
Is there a way to compare PvP activity pre vs post the black out? Maybe like some line-graphs and other such charts? Number of ship kills, number of solo/small group fights, isk destroyed, etc. That'd be really cool.
---
u/Squizz I realize, you're probably busy... Is this already available somewhere?
---
More reasons to blob? Why not.
---
Why counter bots when they could be removed completely? Oh wait, CCP wants the bots to stay.
---
Could be interesting but put a restriction of only like .8 to .5 systems. This will allow the very new bros  some safety.
---
Just blackout the whole game. If it were possible, make pilots show up in local if you were to D-scan or probe find or if you can see them click on them.
---
Lol I like how you twist words. You should join the goons.
---
posting in local when you land to not take a sec hit sounds kinda annoying. maybe have a ship option that allows you to join local without delay to avoid a sec hit. 
---
i also think the sec hits would be kinda annoying because it would mean people who live in low will have to deal with being more vulnerable or eventually not be able to go to high. people that live in high but go to low will have to krab just for sec and nullsec players will install ESS just for the sec gain it give you. (at lest i think it gives you sec gains)
---
&gt;What if I told you that it was this way also with local anyway ?
---
then this change should not bother you at all :)
---
You as a random passerby come dump a huge load of shit right on the doorstep. Someone gets mad at you and calls you out for it and you go "its just a little bit of shit it's no big deal stop being a little bitch." And what you didn't see is that the people who live in the area have had to deal with passersby dumping huge loads of shit every few hours for a week.
---
What's VETO? Like "presidential veto powers" or something else entirely?
---
Back then, there was a lot of legit highsec corps and some would even fight back, especially mission runners since they had the skills. You wouldn't go for newbros in ventures and barges because who cares about those, you'd go after expensive missions runners.
---
It was a much more dynamic meta than "oh no, I can't go in Jita for a week anymore".
---
You get what you pay for
---
And you don't think ccp will be able to track accounts that hit dscan every two seconds for hours?
---
Anom changes that'll make them spread out more so big groups are effected and then rework cynos in a way that super umbrellas are nerf hammered
---
are you gatekeeping r/eve? go back to wow. its clearly where you belong.
---
Something would need to be done about the umbrella.
---
He’s saying ‘you appear when you post in local AND/OR take a sec hit you automatically appear in local.’ Not that posting in local causes a sec hit
---
This would kill WH space, with all those great contracts being offered in jita chat no one would do anything ;)
---
It was CCP Falcon's corp/alliance back when he was Verone, a well-known lowsec pirate.
---
And if you look at my other comments, you will see I'm actually not against them being on industrials or miners, where they make sense. Stabs are flat out broken when allowed on ships designed for danger.
---
This is the real answer to making WH space more dangerous --- punish all them subcap farmers.  Gotta make them real scrams, though, so ratters can't just MJD outta there the moment a sig spawns.
---
...or else the dude just bought plex for $, warped to the safe spot, the RMTrader jettisoned the plex, he scooped it and then merrily warped back to 0 to jita 4-4...
---
I've been shouting that in each Null-Sec system that I visited this weekend;
---
Thats the point ... I just wanted to compare attitudes of players from different sec stats ...
---
Scraping the bottom of the barrel is a good look too.
---
Very common among super hunters
---
Yeah. Last time I ran one of these, I got a few kills, went down to a Condor. Was using long-range T2 pulse ammo and it still didn't get there. Beam, I might have had it.
---
CCP: OK, *removes fleets*
---
I heard he likes Coke over Pepsi
---
I mean, you'd have to package it as part of a suite of changes to make lowsec more viable though, right?
---
It's great to make things more unpredictable, but you've got to put the carrot on the end of the stick to get people out there.
---
Ore re-balance to bring some profit to lowsec mining, improvements to FW and rewards, maybe some low to mid end moon mining in lowsec and a pass on loot drops and NPC spawns in lowsec, maybe some nice anomolies too. Maybe making some resources unique to lowsec would be interesting too.
---
Of course, if it was up to me I'd also ban supers from lowsec and only allow covert cynos, forcing regular capitals to use stargates if they wanted to move around. They're big and tough, why not make them a little more vulnerable?
---
It'd screw logistics a little and gimp jump freighters, so I'd look at giving JFs the ability to travel via covert cyno, and probably investigate what impact allowing them to use a covert ops cloak would have, although that might end up being a bad idea haha
---
Hotdropping and the fact that every man and his dog in lowsec (including those in FW) started fielding cap fleets effectively killed lowsec piracy and small gang pvp. I witnessed this myself - I gave up on lowsec piracy the day that MC dropped five motherships on me while I was soloing in a Bhaalgorn in Molden Heath. If I remember, that was in 2010/2011 - I hung my eyepatch up after that and ended up joining CCP haha.
---
Of course, all the Game Design talk in this post is pure hyperbole and just personal opinion - I don't work in development and it'd be a terrible idea for me to go anywhere near it because EVE would be a place that would make people cry.
---
Legacy means it's code that hasn't been changed in a while, because when you work on software you don't typically change the whole code every time, only a small part of it. Some parts of the code just don't change as much and these parts tend to accumulate changes and sometimes starts resembling a Rube Goldberg machine that can break very easily. That code is usually referred to as legacy code.
---
VETO was the definition of the Lowsec boogeyman back in the days and Falcons corp/alliance.
---
No that was before I started playing. What happened exactly?
---
&gt; No local in facwar would just lead to even more boring recon camps and neutral tackle alt shenanigans
---
He already answered that question. It's be how it is now, but worse.
---
People of a huge number of loyalties congregate in very small areas in lowsec seeking good fights. There's already more than enough smartbomb camps and bait frigates with t3c cloaked and whatever as is, stifling "real" (I don't say that entirely seriously) PVP.
---
No local in null is ok because it gives the advantage to the attacker in hostile space, which is what is desperately needed. No local in low is bad because it gives the advantage to the people who are already at an enormous advantage. Fucking most people looking for "legitimate" PvP would talk in local every system anyway in hopes of being seen by other folks wanting a gf.
---
One idea ive heard and really liked was that anomaly spawns would decrease as military index goes up.  Would be a \[theoretically\] pretty easy change which would force people to spread out futher.
---
Stabs don't protect you from bubbles. Not sure what you're getting at.
---
I think that was his point.
---
Nice
---
WHs are not spooky and mysterious enough. Perhaps we need something like WHs have a chance to just outright close on every jump,  or maybe they change their destination at a whim. Nothing will make wormholers feel at home like always being lost and needing probes.
---
Like he would play thr game. Or maybe he started to play and now realise that ehat players eho actually play thr gamr shouldbe listened?
---
I think most of this would be viable assuming you dropped the training requirements for Cov Cyno's a touch.
---
Blackout or limited blackout in LS would have to come with a rebalance of income sources. LS should be more than FW, but some of the activities, such as clone tags, would be absurd to do in blackout. LS outside FW is already irrelevant and a waste of time. Blackout would make it extremely dangerous for little benefit.
---
Eve also encourages critical thinking, preparation, and execution. Interaction is not limited to creating artificial nebula in space, there is also Eve Mail and private chat as well. :)
---
Why clear them when you can use the force? https://youtu.be/LYx7uXS4n8Q
---
Based Falcon
---
It makes everything bad about it worse, without making anything better?
---
That's true, it's taking me back to my wormhole days. We were mining the other day with cloaked eyes for 2 systems out. We didn't even have to worry about an EOL collapsing behind us!
---
Has one PvP kill ever in the game.
---
It's a solo Imp kill.
---
&gt; will anyone summarize everything that happened during the blackout? 
---
PvP
---
I am still hoping one day he quits CCP and brings Veto. Back
---
Some of my best memories of EVE
---
dotlan info is good for hunters to know what systems to hit but the near instantaneous nature of the data is too much. dotlan should update only 1-2 times a day at most. zkb should be on a delay if possible.
---
Very cool!
---
What? This is silly.
---
The back stab is the most important stab to get through a gatecamp. While their FC is asking why that "blue to our allies" guy is dropping haw dreads on them, you leave.
---
Give Jita a one-way nullsec static.
---
&gt; make pilots show up in local if you were to D-scan or probe find or if
---
If local HAS to exist, it should truly be delayed in all areas of space (including empire).
---
Give a timer to all pilots at session change. For five minutes after entering, you can not read or write to local. You are hidden but you'll need to rely on probes or dscan for that time. After five minutes (or other appropriate time), you write to (appear in) local but are now able to read local for other pilots who have timed out. 
---
If you move through a system before expiration, you neither read local or appear in it at all.
---
The blindness is temporary but goes in both directions.
---
I have too much shit, you want it?
---
That's why NPSI &gt; ALL
---
Well shit, while we're at it, let's put restrictor plates on all ships so everyone is equal........
---
I had some trouble killing the new ones. They use dscan and have warp stabs, and I was in a retribution. Need to figure out if they're running 2 stabs or 1 and what to shit on them with next.
---
It becomes a little spoopy because of how OP dual rep neuting VNIs are in 1v1s where you're literally forced into scram range to tackle a potential bot.
---
Is it time for the triple longpoint armor rook?
---
Dude I hope this thread is RP, else get therapy ... seems like something in your life is making you really bitter
---
1. They do not seem to be limited to constellations/regions
---
2. You can't remove them in 24 hours
---
The triglavian surely have an impact in high sec loginsThe problem is more complex. As example i have not problem with a bad internet connection in travle niarja or uedama, 10 sec of vulnerability in my freighter (less is weebed ) but with manual piloting you can be podded for a bad internet connection in a chain of three to seven invaded systems. My game is very affected now for the chained invasion systems, and need to pay redfrog to move in high sec , reducing my margins.
---
Good idea if you want to close Eve
---
apparently i am illiterate, but im going to keep the comment up because i still want to explore the idea of trading sec for not being in local even though most/all implementations would be a terrible idea.
---
I’m ok with this
---
&gt;Not wanting 'to be part of that equation' is not justification for avoiding PVP without putting in the work when the time comes. 
---
Oh, just drop the bullshit already and just say that you want your stupid KM guaranted each time you get a point because how dare people have a counter to avoid getting pinned down.
---
Lowsec isn't ruined by local. It's hurt by there being basically no transition from hisec to lowsec to null other than bubbles.
---
Maybe ban supers or ban cynos so the transition from hisec to null is more pronounced in how capitals can be used.
---
RP? Not really more like trolling. If hes going to come at my "please don't spam" with "fuck you" i'm going to say fuck you back.
---
i do
---
yissss please. already no-lifing eve
---
ok, thats fine on r/eve then :)
---
Random rnd = new Random();                  
---
int randomtime = rnd.Next(20, 50);                
---
DateTime DscanOnNewTime = DateTime.Now.AddMilliseconds(randomtime * 100);           
---
Assuming the auto dscan function is called on the DscanOnNewTime , each time will be random between 2-5 seconds, using the 100ms variable.               
---
Try to detect this ;)
---
No.
---
Local is bad in null because it gives the defender an even bigger advantage than he had already by being on his home turf.
---
Local is good in low because it warms "legitimate" PVPers of known baiters and blobbers and SB campers and such, let's then know when the ship in a plex is just a farmer who isn't worth trying to catch, and helps people just seeking a GF to find each other.
---
Ls and fw need changes, but delayed local would only hurt things.
---
same argument against the null blackout which, as turns out, arent' true
---
Do it
---
Why not?
---
same tbh
---
&gt; as long as it's well thought out.
---
that made me chuckle a bit. we are way past having a plan.
---
those search results....
---
Goddam that google doc is funny as hell.
---
Your "bad" ideas probably stem from playing the game as much as you have. From what I gather most bittervets feel the same way about making the game difficult and dangerous.
---
I'll ship you as much salt liquorice, midget porn and heroin as you need to get this done.
---
jettison is not used afaik, as it can be tracked quite easily as a handover
---
Exactly! Don't penalise people for trying different fits. Stop the timer for stabbed shuos maybe, don't ban the Venture.
---
Except for larges... it has stopped you from using the acceleration gate to slide in for a while if you have stabs equipped *shrug*
---
That was a shock when I started FW, since I assumed being able to run from a loss would be reasonable. Guess they didn't want people to just run at the start either.
---
I started moving to ventures because... *shrugs* The gankers are usually sitting on more sp and 100s of millions of isk more in shippo than my alt at the time.
---
&gt; nobody bother going to facwar
---
lol you serious?
---
Yes but then I cannot (couldn't) see local and dscan together.  I used to keep all my ducks in a row like that.
---
We, I believe, we specifically talking about TOTAL mass limits, not individual jump limits.
---
They don't
---
you still speak of monitors ? O.O
---
Highly recommend the Nergal instead, its the T2 version of the damavik and can dish an upwards of 700dps.
---
Endurance doesn't have built-in stabs, neither does the Prospect, only the Venture has built-in stabs.
---
&gt;It's great to make things more unpredictable, but you've got to put the carrot on the end of the stick to get people out there.
---
Why was this sort of perspective completely ignored with Blackout? I can understand the desire to see more destruction, but I can't welcome it when the change is so clearly biased in favor of hunters. Especially when we've seen an almost continuous stream of nerfs to ratting/mining in the last year.
---
Well you will have to use a procurer better tank and dps I guess
---
I mean, hes approving your point, just get into standing fleet and cyno in your backup. If you dont have a standing fleet with caps on standby, get into an alliance whicht provides it. Thats what pretty much is happening in long term, people will get drawn to the big alliances becaus: **scary nullsec**
---
Still kind of too early to tell. It's still parsing kills from over the weekend.
---
Ha nice. Falcon the Boogeyman!
---
Mmh yeah i guess so as it has the enhanced normal cloak.
---
Mind = blown !
---
As a mostly solo pilot tht operates in lowsec i would prefer to keep local chat. This way i can see the scumtard instaloki faglord is out there prowling the novice site on gate and i can then move on looking for actual content. People advocating no local are mostly cloaky t3c small baller cucks.
---
I might re-sub, just because of this...
---
...I will if it's permanent!
---
Well, I didn't think so. The thought of working to see who was in local would be fun.
---
I reread your post and the one above it twice, hoping you where the one who had a stroke, as I had no idea what you where on about. Lol
---
Cry more.
---
You do realize that's a line from a show that was written to be intentionally bad French, right?  Correcting it ruins it.
---
Realised it was impacting his pocketbook.
---
?
---
Best ever.
---
I hate liquorice - it makes me chuck haha &lt;3
---
Harbo Starmix is awesome though! :D
---
Interesting idea. EVE without capitals
---
ccp had some galactic scavenger hunt riddle and burn eden won, they got a monument in jita and some t2 wcs as they were released into the game for invention iirc
---
Why does this exist?!
---
Well said
---
Genius! I wonder why nobody in the gaming industry - all of which suffers from botting to some degree - has ever thought of that.
---
You, sir, have solved this problem with just one sentence. Great job!
---
Isn't that all mostly the same arguments nullbears used about the current blackout?
---
Bunch of super pilots hid their supers xD
---
Keep at it though. All feedback is valuable. Even if its a bad idea, it could create dialogue towards a good idea.
---
no ccp you don't need to do shit. leave it
---
&gt; It'd screw logistics a little and gimp jump freighters, so I'd look at giving JFs the ability to travel via covert cyno, and probably investigate what impact allowing them to use a covert ops cloak would have, although that might end up being a bad idea haha
---
It would almost immediately make it more viable to live deeper in space without having a long network of friendly citadels between low and wherever you were.
---
This is the main thing that pushed me and my alliance out of nullsec, getting cut off from logistics routes when standings were reset. If we were able to run covert jump freighters back and forth through potentially hostile or neutral space, that would have been a game changer.
---
Doesn't even have to be a full on jump freighter. Something with ~100k m3 would have been more than ample.
---
Hello brother
---
Blackout in LS would suck for solo PVP.
---
Hello friend. Welcome back
---
&gt; restore local service to their space
---
You are absolutely right.  I don't want this thing *at all*.  It's just more crap for alliances to anchor.  I'd much rather have a radar system that replaces DScan, with some snazzy new graphics, skill-based + boost charges + whatever; something with which the player has to interact (perhaps tuning it in/out to frequency to get a signal on certain classes of ship for a while, before it tunes out and needs to be retuned, etc.).  
---
I'm still working out the details.
---
I'd love to see rotating mining resources based on average system population. The more empty space is the larger caches of better resources it gets and vice versa.
---
Make our believed super corps spread out and roam for their resources.
---
Would be a ton more realistic than it is currently and would create a ton of content!
---
After years of buffs. At this rate it will still take years to level out.
---
A shitpost? Hi Stainguy
---
For a lot of people, there is a happy medium. The more expensive upgrades do improve the ship after all.
---
Or just download jeveasset or something.
---
I cant tell if this dudes serious or not.... why you so angry? why you so salty? WHO HURT YOU AS A CHILD SO BAD YOU ATTACK RANDOM OPINIONS YOU AGREE WITH???
---
Even with recent nerfs, nullsec income is still massively overpowered compared to the risk experienced with pre-blackout intel.
---
Well, you should have specified. Simply saying "t2 damage mod" can be interpreted in a bunch of ways.
---
Anyway how does that relate then? I fail to see your point. Usually ships that fit WCS aren't interested in fighting. Do you mean to say that the fitting requirements don't have a big impact? Like maybe people know much more, but from my experience, mostly yoinking ships (usually cheap and small) have fitted WCS, so that they yoink and get out with the loot. Haven't yet met a Vedmak with WCS lol but what do I know?
---
Does "Stabs" not mean warp core stabilizers which counteract interdiction aka warp scram?
---
That middle one is the best solution possible.
---
Sorry not really available anywhere but you can use zkill's API to generate the information you seek
---
Have you **SEEN** the ISK faucets in the MER? The carrot on the end of the stick is the size of the fucking Titanic.
---
Damn right the blackout is biased toward the hunters for once. 
---
People who live in nullsec always talk about risk versus reward, and while there's risk in taking sov and defending space, it's far too easy to sit in nullsec, get fat and complacent, all the while making ISK and getting rich with little to no risk.
---
Yes, it's not the only solution and the ISK faucets need some work, but (at least in my opinion) it's a good start.
---
The blackout also kicks botters in the balls too, which I'm more than happy about.
---
I like it. Great idea.
---
From what I understand having a real time constant sonar like dscan would wreck the server with everyone’s ships constantly pulling pings all at once. Personally I’d love it as well tbh
---
Just had to wait for it to catch up
---
Wouldn't a better option be to nullify the warp stab effect of the Venture if entering a plex, similar to how higgs on a yacht nullified that one?
---
You wouldn't get gems like this if they couldn't gate [https://zkillboard.com/kill/54856648/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/54856648/)
---
Oh shit, Falcon is Verone? That makes so much sense, I never knew.
---
Stabilizers are a must have for entry level haulers who haven't skilled into jump freighters yet and removing them would gatekeep people from moving bulk with anything less than the sp-intensive options. I can agree to making them non-viable for combat boats but don't punish rookie truckers.
---
Yep. If Nullsec gets no local, then lowsec definitely needs no local too.
---
Is this new? looks like ccp selling SP for cash again...
---
Deal checks out, £1.06 for 1 purchase, max is once per amazon account. Max number of total purchase is 2 but 2nd one is £4/no extra saving. Appears to be once per eve account like other dlc options.
---
If this is a 2nd go around for ccp to sell Sp its more limited than last time but I'm not convinced its good as it goes against what they said in a dev blog a few weeks back.
---
So the code that runs local chat is going to break and not be fixable and they need a "reason" to not have to fix it. CCPThings.
---
Bubbles are different to Warp Disruption, which is also different to Warp Scrambling.
---
Best to get your terminology right before you progress any further.
---
&gt; I'd also ban supers from lowsec
---
My body is ready. Do me.
---
&lt;insert cyno&gt; OR they cant move a whole fleet around to blap you all
---
Sounds similar to my situation at that age almost two decades ago. Consoles are less likely to have something fuck up about them so for younger players they make more sense. Usually cost less as well. 
---
That said, all you've got is anecdotal evidence that means nothing.
---
Nonsense
---
Sure. If your idea is to replace the throwaway Myrm you were ratting with. 
---
If you're trying to actually save for a super/titan/rorq and you don't already have one? good luck doing that with ratting
---
Bunch of super pilots also flew their supers
---
But but... Red Vines!
---
You need to find better friends. I'd have no problem going and scouting for a corpmate if they asked me for a hand.
---
Make it effect low, but make it unreliable. Make ghosts appear in the chat, make it kinda haunted-like.
---
RNJesus said no.
---
Yeah, I'd love the idea of covert logistics runs - shit, that'd make flying a jump freighter super fun tbh :D
---
Awsomesauce !
---
It wasn't about being properly used.. it is that proper use of D-scan is akin to playing WoW and that's your primary lineup on rotation. Every few seconds all day long, smash V. That's not a game I want to play. I don't play a bard in EQ. I don't play WoW anymore. I'm not going to do activity that requires mandatory button mashing all day long when I play. That isn't fun, dynamic or engaging.
---
&gt; First of all, FW pilots would like to have a word with you.
---
Both of them?
---
Fun while it lasted.
---
Best comment so far
---
Like Steam pack
---
Jump bridges, and covert cynos. Tfym?
---
Seems like spamming d-scan is just like local, but without name tags. It's too much intel. Plz nerf.
---
So you want to say: if i live in nullsec i have to deal with similar stuff and im forced to change my playstyle in order to maintain my mainsource of income or just to defend my stuff. But with lesser intel on both sides for FW (i think both sides can use the missing intel) its getting worse? I mean, take away the local, limit plex entrance harder and you can still get your fights. If you are just a random guy seeking pvp fights (for real: there is no real fair fight...not in null and not in low) without dealing with big null blocs; just do it, with or without local: campers, baits and so on will still be there.... the only difference i see is: if you manage to get the better intel you can manage to kill all those fuckers that are ruining your day (and ruined my day the last few years). Is it more effort? Of course. Do you need more guys? For sure. But that seems to be the path CCP want us to play in the future. We all cried for more content... they delivered. But i think it is just fair to force all guys the same way to adapt. I dont say no local fixes FW, but the camper swill be there anyways. Try to find you way to let them pay as long as they dont know you are there.
---
The notion of it making lowsec "feel even deader than it is" is worth mention. I have no strong opinion on blackout so far it seems fine but it does give the impression of Eve being very empty and I wonder how that plays in the long term. If you dont pass someone on a gate or in warp they are simply not there and that can lead to massive strings of jumps where its you and you alone out there which typically isnt a great look in an online multiplayer game.
---
Holy shit... WHERE DID HILMAR AND FALCON GO!
---
Last night when I did more roaming I learned that lesson lol. I attacked a nergal on gate in a busy system and got ganged up on by 8 other small ships, and although the nergal wasnt being an issue for most of it, once I broke its armor tank it used the ADC that I didnt know even existed in the game, so I was essentially forced to sit there and watch my shields get massacred while a nergal was taking almost no damage.
---
This should have been done over 12/13+ish years ago when the first public vote given to us.
---
Believe it or not, not everyone is supposed to easily acquire a super, titan, and rorq.  Definitely not at the speed that they currently do so.  I had someone in my corp go from newbro to Komodo in less than a year.  
---
In comparison, it took me from 2011 until maybe 2015 before I got my first capital.
---
at 25km I was shit like once every 10 missions.
---
at 30km it's like once every 1000 missions. No kidding !
---
ok so my garmur is 3820 m/s (actually more like 3000 because it keeps changin direction), 176m signature, 25km means my evasion due to angular is 40000 \* 3500 / 25000 / 176 = 27
---
The burner has 1.5 tracking,.
---
its chance to hit from evasion only is thus 0.5\^((247/1.5)²) = &lt;1 chance out of 10\^98 shots lol.
---
(it's 1 / 2\^(27²/1.5²) ). the funny part is thatit seems to happen actually a lot. So either the shots appear on igher probabilities, or there is some granularity issue with eve.
---
What do we needa do to get this threw? Low sec piracy is all I've ever enjoyed and it's become so stagnant and empty that I've resorted to high sec ganking...uhhg...
---
what about a passive moon mining module (make it a faction one that drops from mordus rats or something, idk) for lowsec athanors only that scoops like 55% of the ore passively but removes the armor  and hull timer of the athanors?
---
Stabs are the backbone of lowsec FW botters. Fuck stabs
---
Damn! Also, did you forget to switch accounts?
---
Damn!
---
Still here, been here all the long.
---
Please don't change. So many good ideas and basic truths in this post. The rebalance of resources to make low sec a profitable place to live and worth defending would be an amazing pass. Maybe make the resources in non-fw areas to give the truly dead areas of low sec a reason to exist. 
---
Instead of changing the current jump freighters, add a line of new tech 2 freighters thst have less other stats to make up for the covert cloak. You could use these new freighters for shipping to null, but still use the current jump freighters in null sec. Maybe a cargo capacity reduction or something. This would be very similar to the tech 2 industrial ships. One can use cloak but has less capacity, the other has more capacity and tank but can't cloak.
---
Accepting that they only way for CCP to deal with bots is removing chat channels isn't a win though is it? Let as all imagine if Microsoft's way to deal with computer viruses was them removing the ability to connect to internet with Windows... boom headshot fantastic it's not a bug or incompetence it's a feature !!!
---
I miss lowsec piracy so much.
---
Nobody, and it doesnt take 1 look at the killmail to see it clearly wasnt ratting, atleast not there, cuz its resist holes were patched for the ship’s resist holes not what local rats did.
---
if it was lowsec how would the gate campers in Rancer et al know when to activate their smartbombs??  D:
---
Nope, I'm all good, just talking shop and having fun :)
---
Well I could had sworn you were already in CCP back in 2007 (trinity) when I joined the game.
---
Or maybe I'm just so used to seeing you around all these years.
---
PLEASE!
---
Amen. You can move through systems so much *faster* if you limit your search to what you see on dscan and don't spend time on chasing some ghosts in local.
---
I imagine it would in huge fleet battles, but turning it off in a constellation because (insert lore here) could be part of node reinforcement.
---
For everyday use by everyone in space, all the time, I'm guessing most of these things are already done by the server and pinged up to the client, just in a different form.
---
Lowsec could be constellation chat. Enough for FW banter, but not small enough to derive actionable Intel from.
---
Amazon is weird sometimes. Seems either you see the discount and can't buy it, or you don't see the discount and can. Sorry for getting hopes up.
---
And thats why falcon is t a game  designer
---
I can confirm that wingspan did not leave any boogeymen in the hole they found for me and my buddy.
---
They are running a legitimate service and they were very fast in finding the type of hole we wanted.
---
https://zkillboard.com/character/90519767/ but this man?
---
&gt;I mean, you'd have to package it as part of a suite of changes to make lowsec more viable though, right?
---
yeah but ccp has shown zero interest in that and they havent meaningfully revisited lowsec for so long that im not sure theyd be able to make a good change
---
Make blackout permanent, please.
---
No one in lows or near-lows-nulls knowing if we are on, or where, or docked or logged or moved... ooooooooooooh yes please!
---
Do it, do it, do it all night long.
---
This is how you get me to resub. Eve should never feel safe, bring on the danger for all levels of play.
---
still updating afaik but we had very good weekeend. probably corps with more than 40 humans did a lot better but oh well, good content and we where able to extend our dives for a lot longer until the unengageable big fleets came.  [https://zkillboard.com/corporation/306830202/](https://zkillboard.com/corporation/306830202/)   
---
the avg NS skill lvl will probably go up if this last 1 month or 2 which is always nice, not that much fun to kill newbies that follow orders :(
---
Holy shit you fucking mong. He gives up 100 or more dps with multiple WCS. The pilot has shitty scanres and shitty lock range. There are clear downsides to using wcs. Absolute fucking retards on this sub. Keep yourself safe.
---
Nah, I joned in late 2012 - October 15th was my first day on the job and Retribution was my first expansion with CCP :)
---
I think you misunderstand slightly. Wormholes of the same class have constellations and regions just like K-space systems. Each region has half a dozen systems and so if they were cyno capable to eachother, you could conceivably evict someone by seeding caps into another hole and then jumping. Or escalating on their ratting fleets. It would make for some game breaking stuff, would get some massive dread brawls though.
---
Dont forget how you're unsubbing your 420 accounts until CCP personally mails you a handwritten apology
---
I have been told im quite cute, thank you.
---
Oh yes please! Do it! My body and soul are ready!
---
I think only people you are affiliated with via fleet corp ally should be seen in local if you wanna get tonit inwould wipe local out every where
---
IMO no local in Null is the best thing that has happened to this game in my nine years of playing. I’d be gutted if they bring it back, Null space feels far more spooky now as it should be.
---
EVE has lasted as long as it has largely due to the fact that its a good balance between full loot pvp and safety/pve. A lot of MMOs have tried to be too hardcore and then only people that want to pvp play them so there aren't any targets
---
Still leagues ahead of camping rancer with t2 fit gnosis
---
There's only so many hands that we have to work on things, and you gotta set priorities man.
---
I'm right with you on lowsec, it needs some serious love to bring back the yarr-harr-fiddle-de-dee but there's been other stuff to work on.
---
Thank you for the warm welcome! Yes, I generally only auto pilot in Hi sec systems, I read some about the issues of death before. Gives me time to take in the sights to some good music!
---
AMEN.
---
Just saying that gathering players on Steam is a trash idea
---
Word, Preach it.
---
Who do we have to... ehm... "persuade"... yes, lets go with that... to get at least half of that implemented?
---
:driftdab:
---
Im dabbling between mining and military style atm, both seem to have their advantages. Thanks for the tips about corps, if I can only find people willing to talk in game, that would be nice as well. Most systems ive visited have been quiet as a church.
---
I'd never do it with lowsec meta this way it is right now, the corp wouldn't be able to function and would die in a matter of months.
---
Hi :D
---
Your playstyle is like hitting dogs missing a leg. Mission runners cannot protect themselves from 3 bil isk proteus and the neutral logi you had. Your scourge is the reason why so many people quit Eve before they really start and I hope CCP keep making your lifestyle harder and harder.
---
hi, i'm fairly new to the game and ran into some ganks while wh exploring in my Astero. Would be nice if someone could explain to me how to handle the following situations.
---
\- Sabre &amp; Co bubble camp at the wh entrance / exit:
---
  a) can i just jump back through the wh or will a warp scram prevent this? is this my best option?
---
  b) next best option (?) mwd-cloak out of the bubble and hope they won't de-cloack me?
---
  c) will a gate/wh cloak prevent a de-cloak from their site?
---
  d) are there any other options?
---
\- Hacate &amp; Nemesis relic site camp:
---
  didn't know what to do at all. reacted reasonably fast but got scrambled anyway. dropped ecm drones but that didn't   
---
  help at all. i could fit some warp stabs but i want to avoid that.
---
  \- a) are 2 warp stabs enough to counter a single warp scram or do i need 3?
---
  \-b) is it better to orbit the site or to get close and align to some celestial?
---
  \-c) can someone explain how ecm drones work? is it a random/fixed % based chance?
---
Ouch, well I hope I stare my killers im the eyes when they come for me, see you on the battlefield if it comes to that. Thanks for the info.
---
No Balls
---
Stay Frosty is recruiting! We still manage to find good solo fights in Lowsec somehow, so you are more than welcome to drop an alt and join discord with whatever random identity you choose, noone is gonna notice you amongst all the spies.
---
Thanks, thats all I was worried about. Cheerio!
---
Met falcon in Vegas, he's a good man
---
Hahahaha!!
---
I understand, the cyno capability paired with multiple static Null systems would allow for massive fleets to enter wh space rage roll those static systems to an optimal region and insert dozens of capitals within a few jumps of one another and allow near instantaneous travel from wh space to anywhere on the map a force projection that would make wh space important for the null blocs to colonize quickly and effectively. Say goodbye to wh space.
---
I clear them solo in a tornado (Naga, Oracle. Raven. Ferox also work)
---
Have to be able to go 1100m/s near cap stable and shoot past 150km (the battleships weapon range)
---
Your tank is kiting. I usually make a warp in point. Align out to a safe and shoot from 150km+. Can warp off to the safe if theres trouble. Takes about 35-40minutes solo but can be easily multiboxed or bring friends to speed it up.
---
I don't have the fit on hand but 1400mm arty and lots of tracking computers/targeting range rigs)
---
People shot people, shit died, noone not involved found out about it.
---
I'd probably keep local delayed, go regional in lowsec and keep highsec as it is now.
---
I'd like to make highsec constellation chat, but we need to be mindful of new players and allowing them to talk a little bit of shop, see activity around them, and have a low as possible bar of entry to be able to engage with other players.
---
If they see an empty chat channel, it makes the New Eden feel less alive.
---
Conversely, in low and null, it's just more scary, which is a good thing.
---
It's all about finding a balance right?
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.
---
Also theres no instrumentals in a c4 unless it's shattered. Won't work for vitals. Tornado won't work for magentar but I believe Oracle and Naga will.
---
I like the way your brain works.
---
How about Sugar Free Harbo Gummy Bears, 5 lb container?
---
NO PLEASE NO
---
sticky this on pl discord
---
That latter part only applies to low-class space. C5 and C6 wormholes allow capitals to pass through, sd a high-class capital isn't stuck in its system.
---
@CCP_Falcon. Why not you say?! 
---
Well I will tell you why not. Bcs we already has simmilar feature in game and it is called - WH... 
---
Why forcing this feature on null...
---
ADCs and especially the microscopic sig of assault frigates makes them insanely overpowered in most situations. That's the big reason why the ones with the best average resists lack mid slots. The ones with the mid slots either lack damage (Hawk, Vengeance, Harpy) or are very weak to the minmatar drones that can easily track them (Enyo, Ishkur)
---
It's true :|
---
friendly reminder that a lot of "wormholer btw" are equal if not worse than null-bear.
---
To this day not convinced they weren't trolling. KIA = killed in action. Period. They had picked that name, and in my mind any attempts to play on words is trolling =\]
---
It doesn't really work to be honest, it's just a mess of random shit that sometimes comes out in the right order.
---
The only variable that the WCS affects is the
---
&gt; lock-up the target before said target warps off
---
the rest is on the aggressor. To be fair, the target, if they're smart, will set up a warp point during low activity or even do their business during times when there are no campers.  If you stumble blindly into a camp without taking any measures to protect yourself, you deserve to have your ship blown out from under you. WCS is not even a guaranteed Get out of Camp card. Having been a part of both low and nulsec camps, I've seen ships swarmed before ever getting a chance to even align to their next waypoint. Yes, a solo camper is going to have to work harder, and he isn't always going to get his prey, but to lay that on one module is rather silly, you know?
---
Looks like the old starter pack description. If someone purchased it let us know.
---
15:11 Monday afternoon/morning:  19k accounts logged in.  
---
Is that more or less for a Monday at this time?
---
Amen &lt;3
---
Good - Black it out.  Make you actually have to experiment and lose shit in space to find out what works. 
---
Fucking carebear.
---
Well, CCP simply forgot to raise the amount of minerals needed to build ships, structures and modules - lorewise this should have happend with every balancing patch by 20-25% for every blueprint.
---
This would have changed a lot - capital proliferation, mineral and ore prices as well as the price for ships and modules.
---
What's your point?
---
When accepting missions for an agent , take a good look at who is the enemy you will fight. If you fight pirate faction (gurista, sansha, bloodraiders, angel etc.) you will not have standing problems in the region you are currently in. AVOID accepting missions vs gallente or minmatar or else you could eventually have issues when roaming their space. I ran so many missins with caldari that I can barely enter gallente space now, knowing this at your stage of the game, I would of declined those missions vs gallente.
---
It has consequences for equipping. They are removing all balance and bowing to the 'elite pvp' gankers. Who will pay the bills at CCP when there are no more sheep for the 'wolves' to feed on? They sure as shit won't be targeting other combat ships, ie eachother.
---
That's also a good alternative.
---
wew, truthbomb, there is a reason even Lowsec groups ball up in bigger groups today ....
---
Botting down the warzone just burns out everyone.
---
RIP VETO
---
RIP DE
---
Lots of fond memories being terrified of you guys.
---
Man, so much salt. Show me on the shiny Machariel where the Proteus touched you. I never hunted newbros, only shiny ships (why hunt newbros for like 10 mil in loot, not worth my time). If they can't replace what I killed (mainly shiny mission runners filled with green and blue mods), then they just didn't follow Eve's golden rule to only fly what you're ready to lose.
---
I'm not currently in test, lol, still contemplating what direction I want to go
---
or just don't be poor and have at least 3 monitor
---
/signed
---
you and your crab friends its not a lot of people
---
Dont forget the 3 and 6 month gametime packages that are 20% off.
---
While we're just spitballing, it occurred to me that covert jump freighters might open up another option, although it being much more complex than a few attribute changes - actual escorts.
---
For a small alliance like mine, living in deepish nullsec (Cache), a JF run would be 5 or 6 jumps, and after a couple of them, the JF would be 15 to 20 lightyears away from our home. If it ever got tackled, that was it, there was no prospect of getting any help to it.
---
There was no point sending carriers along either, their range was comparatively so short the JF would take double the jumps, and fatigue would grind the entire operation to a halt half way through.
---
Instead, imagine if you will, a black ops freighter capable of dragging other covert ops support ships along with it. Like a black ops portal generator, but only capable of going where the freighter itself is going (i.e. it can't be used as a remote bridge, it *has* to jump through to drag other ships behind it).
---
Think command dessy generators, but with actual jumps and cynos. Those other ships would then inherit the JF's range and fatigue bonuses.
---
Suddenly, logistics runs are a group activity. It's not one guy on his own running his freighter and cynos, now there's incentive for his fellow players to move with him in a small gang of bombers, recons and T3s (maybe even the odd blops).
---
Especially for small groups, chances are they've all got stuff inside the JF they don't want to lose. Why wouldn't they want to ride shotgun to make sure it gets to its destination safely?
---
I think black ops freighters have an enormous amount of potential for making logistics work a better and more group-based experience.
---
Entropy is always at the wheel. No matter what we tell ourselves.
---
They'll want a nerf to cynos too, eventually.  I don't warp around so much anymore.  I just cannon my ships around the region with a blops and/or Titan.
---
But, there is no bridging titans, so only caps can go, and there are no cap capable static holes, so no reliability!
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/77831469/
---
I'll just leave this here
---
Not available in the US.
---
correcting it corrects it. By definition.
---
No way, they fight back now? That was not part of the deal. I wanted to go there, get dank PvP killz, and feel good about myself, not have an opponent that can fight back. REEEEEEEEEEE, CCP NERF PLZ!
---
French people never surrender ! They reach a fleeing agreement :=}
---
BTW who is it up to? asking for a friend
---
Whenever someone who's less than 6 months old wanders into j space, I typically remburse them four or five times what their ship is worth if they chat. Spend time giving newbros advice and how not to get popped next time.
---
I like to think it's the equivilant of throwing the small ones back, and dashing the invasive species of crap players against the rocks.
---
Noticed the Imp kill was not registered on zkill this morning so I went ahead and uploaded it myself from the in game api link. That’s one expensive kill mark on that rattlesnake.
---
Shut up, why did I vote for you?
---
Falcon please become the hero of fixing lowsec we all need.
---
Thumb Up!
---
If you live in the arse-end of, for example, Tenal, then a neutral in Local is either there to drop on your ratters or is there to run your Relic sites. They're certainly not setting up PI chains.
---
This isn't necessarily true for lowsec. And that's why Local is fine in lowsec. There is freedom of movement, and plenty of different reasons to be there.
---
Meh, there is industrial ships that can get the job done. Never see enough of these in action and would make for some nice diet whale hunting in low sec.
---
aLL tHe bOtS ArE GoNe
---
Banning cynos would be interesting. You could still user caps/supers you'd just need to gate them. Hmm...
---
MAY AS WELL ADD HS TO THAT TOO. HELP LIVEN UP WARDECS.
---
&gt; At any point in time someone can light this cyno and 255 man fleet lands on you.
---
Thats my point... why do I need to D-scan when I can just go about my ratting or spod brain ways when I just have a high slot module that calls in a 255-man fleet.
---
Not any worse than every ratter mashing the dscan key every few seconds.
---
correcting (the grammar) ruins (the joke).  Do I really need to spell that out for you?
---
Yeah, screw that, we were always independent and damn proud of it.
---
I remember feeling bad when the list of corps on our blue list got higher than 5.
---
There was a reset shortly after.
---
Hell put in high sec too
---
Yeah I really don't want to see a local observatory thing that provides the current local functionality. Now, if it provides an anti-camping functionality, for example pulsing local every, say, 20 minutes? That could have some validity. Or hell, what if it's not a structure that observes local at all, but a structure that lets you dscan from inside a citadel?
---
If they ever fix tethering mechanics to not be aids, that coudl be important!
---
That's why I said wormhole space and not wormhole system
---
These all sound like good ideas though. Can I mention here that I really want my captains quarters back?
---
Confusion
---
Pretty interesting for sure, but I'd rather just have smaller hulls be more capable escort vessels rather than having some form of wake that they get caught in.
---
Yup, or if you're just racing shotguns, you move a lot slower, giving defenders some reaction time should you get spotted. Or you can just gate-anom-gate, land in a bubble and get bombed. That also is a thing.
---
i remember when zkill was like 500k kills behind, took a week. Just be patient, it will catch it when it can.
---
You can still chat....
---
show us on the puppet where the nasty loki touched you
---
True, blockade runners are a thing, but it's all about capacity when you're trying to keep a small alliance fed.
---
A convoy of Cranes or Bustards ain't gonna keep the kids fed.
---
Did you have to go and dent my cynicism like that?
---
That and having an alt cloaked 100kms of the gate to your ded site to ensure you don't get cursed to death, all pretty much requirements in lowsec pve activities with other people in local.
---
Yessssss
---
I mean, it is terribly difficult to light covert cyno for 30 seconds during a random time of the day and dock up and change ships. Right? Better be watching that corp tab 24/7 spam refreshing, that sounds like fun and dynamic gameplay!
---
omg again few people circlejerk how bad local is...  look how ADM fall everywhere, null activity drop hard
---
It seems everyone in this thread generally agrees stabs are fair on haulers. It's the FW plexing and other "technically PVP avoidance" uses that irk people (including the CEO apparently).
---
How the fuck is an automated system ever going to "kind-of fun to use"
---
Please stop, i can only get so hard
---
It would like the D-scan system now.
---
Since you wrote it, you literally spelt it.
---
Do I need to teach you what to spell means ?
---
How do you think I feel, this is just a small portion of what's in my head on a daily basis haha &lt;3
---
I'm not seeing any discounts for the US.
---
also remove local in j-space for good - like, there's no local chat window, or there is but you can' type in it :)
---
Just do it like WTF, why this stuff is not implemented ?
---
Welcome back.
---
Your cup is in the mail.
---
Doing so in a hotdropping fleet of titans isn't what anyone was talking about.
---
Warp core stabilizers give you +1 point of warp core stability. They counteract warp disruptors and (with enough stabs) scramblers. Some ships have an innate bonus to warp core strength.
---
A bubble has basically infinite interdiction strength. You need warp core interdiction nullification (only available on a few ships) to counteract it. No amount of stabs will let you get through a bubble.
---
&gt; Dscan don't work well in a nullsec that have some active population.
---
You have to ignore it totally ...
---
If you D-scan, you'll see whats the there. I highly doubt you'll have active sabers and interceptors in D-scan range when you turn on filters.
---
(Maybe I don't like that warping is boolean either)
---
But there is a lot you can do. For example time-to-warp is constant (for a fitted ship). That doesn't have to be the case. Also the speed limit you need to cross is set to 75% of max speed, which is why webbing a friendly that has initiated warp is a good idea when you're not engaged. That also doesn't have to be the case.
---
You could also tier "warp" into different speeds and warp scrambling frigates ships could follow you into your warp channel and prevent you from going beyond X Au/s. Changing "you can't warp" into "you can escape *some* ships".
---
For example, you're in an industrial, jump into a gate camp consisting of two frigs, a destroyer, a cruiser and a battleship. Maybe unlikely but let's suppose it for the sake of the argument. You warp while the frigs scramble you. You enter warp first, but the frigs and the destroyer can follow you in. The Cruiser can go slightly faster than you because you're scrambled, but can't follow you in and you *can* shake the battleship.
---
Transforming a "gg you lose" into a chase.
---
*I* would find that interesting.
---
The queue goes up and down...it can only parse a handful a second, and if there are a ton of kills happening it'll take awhile to parse. He can only send so many API requests at a time, and each kill has to be obtained separately (it's the way the ESI killmail hash works).
---
What do you mean by "nullbear"? Just curious of your particular definition for this meme.
---
I have always otherwise ignored the term, as it reeks of the standard "I hate people different than me / I'm better than" that exists in human nature.
---
only for new accounts or?
---
Oh I know lol I was trying to explain to others. It's normal.
---
Thanks for your reply :) 
---
I suppose the existance of bots is the main obstacle to RMT being illegal in game? If bot accounts were impossible, then even the cheapest jobs that still need to be done by the in game economy would become more valuable as there would be a demand for an actual human to sit and do them. 
---
I would ask another question: in EVE do players work for eachother, or is this a figure for one individual's work? If you own multiple ships, do you need a human player to operate each ship, or are they automated by the game?
---
Ah. 
---
Yeah I’m just coming to the conclusion this is a shit game man.
---
You are great. I'm a fan.
---
Use a maulus navy issue then... Problem solved
---
It is a different spelling and variation of a holebear, but with a little more danger and less likely to hide in a cave to bear.
---
https://puu.sh/DT7AU/87966f08c7.png
---
Looks like it's £1.06 for all that, limited to one pack per Eve account. You can buy each pack individually to get multiple discounts, but still needs you to redeem the code on your Eve account management page, restricting the number you can easily use
---
This program made searching stuff so much easier! Been using it fit a while, and it's one of the few ways to let you search fitted modules as well
---
Like you can introduce a covert ops mini JF now.    
---
Give it 100k m3 when fully ore expanded and you are fine :D
---
Without cynos in lowsec, I'd guess capitals would be a strategic asset only. They would be valuable for localized warfare, defense, and slowly pushing territory. Subcaps would de facto be the meta for skirmishes, roams, and jumping on stuff.
---
Hell, allow covert cynos to stay. Just no regular cynos.
---
You are denser than a neutron star
---
My understanding was those were intended mainly originally to be corporate/alliance assets rather than individual purchase
---
Nothing is "kind-of fun to use" after the first 100,000 times you've used it, so your question is kind-of moot.
---
Twiddling dials, tuning, listening or something may be interesting for some players. You know, like the sonar guy in a sub.  He always get a scene in the movie, right?
---
It feels really spooky and like anything can happen. I hope they dont bring it back in form of a dumb module which would only cause tedious fueling on null logistics.
---
Small correction. 
---
IRC were Goon's pets/renters until they decided to answer Red Alliance's agression (according to them) / attack RA (according to RA), who were Goons old allies becoming pets. I've been in every fight of those early weeks of the conflict, no one had any idea what was going on, later it did look like someone triyed to frame both alliances by dropped poses, weird kills, random fleets etc. IRC tried to contact Mitts beforehand to secure "neutrality" from the rest of the coalition (which they supported - a few weeks previously being in the same fleets), citing "this is a war between two of your allies, those who will win will support you" sort of deal. Mitts laughed at them, saying RA will murder IRC in weeks and was just mitts - rude, naive, condencending prick, same as always. IRC decided to fight. It was actually fun, Oldma gave up military leadership to an FC junta, who made all non-industry decisions and most corps who were in IRC back then - loved what followed.
---
In the following 3 months of seemingly winning RA had bankrupted themselves and effectively disbanded almost every ally they had involved in the war. Arguably caused a split between XIX (who were under instruction from Goons not to interfere until told to) and SOLAR (who had a long grudge against the old NC and supported IRC/ED when NC got themselves involved). Lost every region they had to Atlas after their sorry state was leaked to Atlas by IRC, who in turn were sold the financial docs (yours truly was involved in translating and verifying of that). And then their leadership tried to sell the alliance's name to some NPC-null residents to try to get at least something out of it, which resulted in the leadership collapse, a coup and a peace-deal with IRC, according to which RA would surrender and be given free pass of the only territory they had left - the constellation they captured from ED during all this time. The legendary Red Alliance was killed off by IRC, and every undead incarnation of them since - has very little to do with the old alliance, and never ever recovered in either numbers, skills or ambitions. 
---
Goons didn't want IRC back though. They sent PL, their then military wing after IRC, and gave XIX the blue light to attack. They declared war along the lines "we will attack on monday", then started anchoring attack POS' all over drone-regs - without the claim on - on Saturday. IRC attempted to remove those, XIX called the classic "we were attacked without declaration of war by evil IRC" and attacked in full force. IRC didn't even try to fight after that - evacuationg everything. Only two corporations stayed in IRC after that - AWE and a tiny mining corp of half a dozen members or so. 
---
And after that they had joined anyone who would sell them space and were abysmally poor at PvP. Legendarily so, for years. I had lost track of them a few years back though.
---
Priorities man. 
---
It's super easy to spitball ideas on Reddit - we can talk shop all day. That's the easy part.
---
It's WAY HARDER to actually implement them. There's so much work that has to be done and only so many people working on EVE!
---
Funny, how I [suggested that months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/boh4x7/preempting_2_weeks_of_badposting/enh2mzh/), wasn't taken that well... StainGuy posts it, gets 2x gilded...
---
Right back at ya.
---
I'm a fan of everyone who plays EVE.
---
&lt;3
---
Oh, god, here come the strategic ratting fleets again.
---
Damn, I really like this idea!
---
That good balance is responsible for nullsec (the supposed dangerous space) being safer than high sec (the stated safer space) :thinking:
---
I've been winning EVE for four years but this blackout AKA "goon salt mine" is beautiful.
---
I am truly struggling to remember the last time I've seen so much butthurt
---
&gt;Maybe ban supers or ban cynos
---
-Some- cynos, but yeah I think that would make a huge difference. Industrials (jump freighters etc) need to be able to operate but other than that-
---
There's a ton of stuff neither I would do solo or small gang, that's not just a non-starter. I have to choose to be willing to loose (with certainty) a t3 plus subsytem lvl before I engage anyone with my loki/tengu team, and most often it's simply not worth it even if I stood a good chance of winning.
---
Chance of backup showing up, willing to chance it. Chance of cyno/blob, not willing. Once cyno goes up only reason not to get up and walk away from the damned keyboard is to maybe eject and get pod out.
---
Please for the love of EVE. 
---
**PLEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASE**
---
Read between the lines - it's not up to him, it's not permanent, just a marketing department trick to lure in some morons for multi-month subs with an event lasting less than half of a month...
---
people need cyno to JF null-HS
---
Please, please, please extend it to everywhere but high sec. It's the best thing to happen to PvP in a long time.
---
K346 N432 ? S199 would these work? Or are they roaming from null side?
---
Showing as unavailable for me currently, UK btw
---
Just resubbed myself too!
---
I’m jealous of those at CCP who are getting to see the data on things so far. I know from my very limited time to play this weekend, it is a dramatic shift in how I do play. I will say the thrill of the unknown and adventure is back. It’s fantastic!
---
if you want to get into indy thats cool and can really pay well if you want to invest the time and like spreadsheets and such, i dabbled still do sometimes but its just a way to pay for the pew pew  
---
mining as a new player tho, eeesh i really dont recommend maybe ninja gas huffing untill you get on your feet.  
---
but the time you spend mining minerals vs the isk you could be making in the same time and then buying the minerals just doesn't make sense, easily 3x4 times more efficient to buy.
---
Itsatrap.jpeg
---
It's as if living in a different doesn't make you better at the game by default
---
The downward spiral.....
---
The MER? really? I get it, there are people out there who are absolutely willing to abuse everything wrong in null-sec. That is not me, and I will not be held to account for the abuses you allow to exist.
---
Personally I find ratting so mind-numbing I can't even force myself to login to do it. I rat as little as possible and only when forced to. I preferred running incursions, and where they were sporadic before, they are dead now.
---
So now I'm left with ratting to make money, and here's my take-away from all of this. A 100mil doctrine ship used to take 5 ticks at 20mil/tick to replace. that's \~1.5 hrs. If I now have to replace a 60mil myrm every time I go out as well, that's now \~2.5 hrs. God help me if I want to fly something more expensive in pvp. 
---
So here's my reality with blackout: every loss is going to cost me more time to replace, and that's not going to make me want to play \*more\*
---
&gt;The blackout also kicks botters in the balls too, which I'm more than happy about.
---
We can all agree about that, botters can burn in special hell.
---
Imagine if CCP actually banned ventures from going into plexes without fanfare. Now think of all them botters trying to do there thing.
---
One can only dream.....
---
&gt;\-Some- cynos, but yeah I think that would make a huge difference. Industrials (jump freighters etc) need to be able to operate but other than that-
---
Screw it, make people use Blockade Runners. Take the covert cyno bridge.
---
One of the greatest expansions, what a time!
---
Time to register more reddit accounts so I can upvote this more.
---
TIL...   yeah I remember hating to see VETO show up in system.   :)
---
I think I had the same problem:  all my chars were there but they wouldn't refresh skills.  I found that re-authenticating via SSO solved the problem.
---
A bit racist tho
---
You're a good man Falcon
---
They usually seem to be in withdrawal phase by 48 hours due to players already.
---
Have you ever even done one OP?
---
what Lore are you referring to?
---
I can't promise anything, but maybe we can show off some of the data and how it changed at some point.
---
Not confirming anything, but we'll see :)
---
I just don't get how no local limits you from going to entosis systems. Especially when you have so many F1ers ready to go. They could use all the above things with local before.
---
Hard to implement in a way that things just go broken or just paper work?
---
Build and sell locally
---
You're an idiot.
---
Anyone that does, will skew the results to their way of thinking.  
---
80% of all statistics are made up.
---
what's the rest of it
---
The issue here is that the invasions function as a training ground for newer fleets if you remove all that, you simply make the space low/null, which would be counter to the point of getting people out there and learning in a relatively controlled environment.
---
I guess that in your blind rage to prove me wrong with math, you missed this part:
---
&gt; Yes, it's not the only solution and the ISK faucets need some work, but (at least in my opinion) it's a good start.
---
I'm not saying it's an endgame solution, I'm saying it's a test for part of a solution and we're watching metrics and activity.
---
Why fit cap batteries when you can just die instead?
---
Dude, I could talk for hours on things I'd love to do to EVE... but it's all horrible :)
---
Sucks to create content right?
---
Nah, fuck em. If they need the resources that badly they can escort a fleet
---
Arnold says stop Channing you baby! Get to the choppers! This black out is fantastic and to say there is no reason to play is a temper tantrum. Go ahead unsub your accounts ccp will really learn their lesson then. You showed them! They’re probably reading your comment and shaking in their Icelandic fortress
---
DO IT!
---
Is there any way we can get a an update on your updates webpage? Even something as vague as "Dec 2019 Lowsec Revamp" if it's one of the larger updates would be nice. I love EVE, but feel our community is in the dark compared to other games. I have some ideas on how to resolve that as well, have a Reddit post I was going to make here soon regarding that.
---
Fuck em. They can form a fleet and escort if they need to get things to and from nulsec
---
you simply can not use CCP and "I can't believe they haven't fixed" in one sentence...
---
It worked fine for me, I bought 2 at £1 each only 30 mins ago.
---
Lol that blackout is already a good nerf to ratting isnt it.
---
I think it's a lot of things to be honest, there's some serious process that goes on during game design that I won't pretend to full understand.
---
Then there's the actual work of design, programming, quality assurance and everything related to making things ship.
---
It's an incredible machine, and I've got endless respect for our guys and girls who do it :)
---
literal definition: carebear who lives in null
---
someone who wants all the benefits associated with living in null, but doesn't want to see other players. 
---
sov null is arguably safer than hs and definitely safer than low sec or npc null due to home defense fleets, defensive gate camps, and player owned stations leading to it being pretty much dead. 
---
nullbear gameplay is low risk high reward, it's why plexing for a single month costs 2.1 bil, and supers are everywhere. the money and minerals flow far too freely now that you can just inject into a rorqual.
---
&gt; forcing regular capitals to use stargates
---
Give freighters proper fitting options, and we might have a deal
---
&gt;paid 240 times in kills
---
So what, like 80 mil?
---
You mean like when you bring legions to fight their bc fleets?
---
I'm not handling EVE Updates any more since the end of Q1 this year, but I'll pass this on to the team that take care of it now and see what we can do for sure :)
---
no it isnt
---
As a goon who has had constant content this past weekend the blackout was amazing.  I have to ask that you guys update the default overview to help newer players and maybe even include a "how to dscan" part of the new player experience.  This would go a long way to making people understand that just because there isn't anyone in local the solar systems they're in are full of potential targets/hostiles.
---
hell yeah
---
Probably salty that they had to move a bunch of caps to Malpais yesterday to defend the Brothers of Tangra mongs that were out in supers and rorqs during the blackout.  NC was probably also wondering why no one was taking any of the obvious bait with the NC caps and supers in clear view on the keepstar undock.... geeee.... I wonder....
---
They have an option to block invites, they could however make one that blocks invites for everyone outside of your corp/alliance or for people in your contact list with positive standing?
---
I'll leave this suggestion here only to have the exact same thing posted later by someone else and gilded...
---
&gt; Of course, if it was up to me I'd also ban supers from lowsec and only allow covert cynos, forcing regular capitals to use stargates if they wanted to move around. They're big and tough, why not make them a little more vulnerable?
---
How many alcohols do you need? I'll spare no expense.
---
These are the same Items that were in the controversial 1 mill SP packs. Either they just nerfed the packs or this is an additional starter pack.
---
Much appreciated!
---
Jesus why all the hate and jelly for super ratters ? 
---
If it comes to the point that it makes no sense to own one we simply will only use it for pvp or sell it and find other way to make isk , you will never stop people from making isk unless you just shut eve down , so your jellyniss won’t go away with this blackout or with the anoms sites , nerf or with the disappearance of supers or rorq,s we will still find a way to make isk !!!! 
---
Where there’s a will there’s way man.
---
And using the hate for super ratters , rorq miners and anyone who figures out a way to make isk for your laziness or entitlement for working towards a goal like skilling up or learning how to be better pilot is just pathetic on your self really , you know who you are always whining about being broke and shit.
---
It's actually quite a bit worse. The way D-Scan is currently implemented it is a huge load on the server to have a continuous scan cycle going. It's also limited to every 2 seconds to alleviate some of that crunch. 
---
Somebody in another thread suggested it should theoretically be possible, according to their expertise, to rewrite the system to not be as process intensive. I don't see them doing a complete rewrite of the D-Scan system though without a really compelling reason. Making D-Scan EZ mode so people don't have to push a button doesn't seem that compelling.
---
lol rofl, that kind fleet is fun only once, then it is so fucking boring... most of indexes are maintain because ratting semiafk VNI alts or so.
---
You guys were badass!
---
no u!
---
I feel you, our corp has a long history of moving to NPC-Null pockets alone as corp to smallscale or founding small PvP-Alliances (with max. 500 members) without blues. Last stance was Aridia where we formed an Alliance with 2 smaller corps having something about 250 members. LSH could not kick us, we got friends with InfernalOctopus CEO and finally got our own pocket there from where we liked to take Nullsec-WHs to escalate homdefenses. Our income was from R64 moons mostly taken from big alliances that could not defend them after Phoebe when staging on the other side of the map. After Lifeblood our SRP Income went to zero basically as nobody of us mines rocks.
---
They were out ratting, too
---
Too much cloaking already. I think the combat recon model is superior to the current "giant ship completely invisible, 2500km away from you" cloak model. It works for fiction as a plot device, not so much in game.
---
Honestly I don’t have the numbers, but CCP could add specialized cargo holds (like on the T1 industrials) for the blockade runners for minerals/ammo/ect. That way you get to enjoy the no cynos in low sec, but increase the amount of packed lunches you can move with blockade runners. Or something like that. Again, I don’t have the numbers and maybe misinterpreting what you are talking about.
---
Dare I say infinite possibilities to skin this cat.
---
Are there still people who use stock assets window for more than just lols?
---
Hello friends. 
---
You should boycott Amazon on prime day to protest against their working conditions.
---
Have a nice day.
---
liquorice here almost certainly meaning traditional black liquorice, not sweetened red 'liquorice' like red vines
---
Yeah, I've got nothing for US customers.
---
UK has a lot of good Prime deals the US doesn't have today.
---
Make it look like a gate on overview too. Just change 1 letter Perimeter is Piremiter then next day Sobaseki is Saboseki.
---
Depends on where your 10M is but a pair of tinker snakes with decent bling will more than easily clean that site up in 15 minutes
---
Nope, different skins
---
Or you could use the in game fitting tool?
---
&gt; There are lots of ways of playing with this so it's kind-of fun to use.
---
&gt; Nothing is "kind-of fun to use" after the first 100,000 times you've used it, so your question is kind-of moot.
---
So your idea is moot too.
---
lol No I move up to a million m3 at a time.  BR isn't happening.
---
I don’t really dislike banning supers/normal cyno in LS.  As long as you had the ability to use JF via a covert cyno in LS to be able to supply people.  Blops play could be supported by using a covert ops cyno. 
---
I think most people see LS as a roaming small gang centric play style or FW (such as it is).  Small to medium sized groups, not tied to SOV, roaming around trying to make trouble.  You don’t need super capitals for that.  
---
NS should be large groups fighting large groups with large fleets and the biggest toys. It should be centered around building, protecting and adding value to your SOV and destroying others.  
---
Things should feel ‘big’ with a real difference in the scale, infrastructure and motivations of the fighting when moving between LS and Null.  Small groups can come into Null, but they should expect to be out gunned and out manned and have to adjust tactics accordingly.  
---
I am probably just rehashing the Eve of days gone by though, but I just wanted to throw out my wish list along with everyone else.
---
You know this game community loves data.
---
I'm solo player who enjoys wh relic exploration. Currently in Astero. Is it good idea to invest time for skills in Stratios? Will this really expand my possibilities? How expesnisve is fitting some useful Stratios?
---
Did you revoke first?
---
it's as if you forgot a noun...
---
I'm actually not really drinking much these days to be perfectly honest, just the odd bit of scotch here and there haha :)
---
I happen to participate in WWB on the goon side , and from personal experience I can tell you we got dunked hard at least 3 times by SNUFF .
---
No, I just re-logged each account in.
---
So, "no local" is the new fix for every bad mechanic/system in the game? 
---
0.0 gameplay stagnant, activate "no local", 0.0 fixed! Lowsec gameplay stagnant too, activate "no local", lowsec fixed too! Those fucking highsec carebears, activate "no local" there too, that will show them and fix highsec instantly! 
---
Thats really sad CCP, you dont even try anymore... :(
---
The dumbest post in the thread.
---
reduce the local availability of ressources. increase site yield by 100 but multiply its cooldown/respawn window by 1000. 
---
suddenly there aint enough space in delve and you have to move out in order to fulfill your ressources needsmaking it harder to keep up a good umbrella while also forcing our rorqualpilots to frequently change systems.
---
yep exactly, these whiny people just have to "git gud" XD
---
Strange that is exactly what miners told me when i was moaning about Lifeblood patch ....
---
yup!
---
Don't be put off by the sometimes apparent toxicity of this sub. Some ppl here like a robust discussion as CCP_Bartender phrased it recently. It's up to you to participate in this reddit PvP meta. So far I've not seen a honest question treated with disregard.
---
The issue is that you have like 6 toasters spread across the constellation and 1 main response fleet to kill defenders. When I see a local spike while I am toasting, I can alert main fleet about the enemy being in system and they can star moving to me or to the gate to catch them on their way out. Now, without local, I won't know where they are till they land. The whole issue is that it takes and extra 2-5 minutes per system to scout for enemy toasters and respond to enemies in local, and we have no idea where they are unles we place 20-30 pilots on gates. Even then, we don't know if they use a covert cyno or were already in system. Bridges are sketchy too.
---
To be fair that's not _really_ the fault of local primarily - I'd put the blame of that on the oppressive nature of the Supercapital vs Subcapital match-up, and the steady push by CCP towards Capitals being the best PvE platforms all around, with pretty much no negatives associated with them.
---
You could accomplish many of those goals by combining a large DST and a Blockade Runner.
---
Currently for some tasks in sov null, a BLOPs with a Blockade Runner is highly flexible for short range, sneaky staging of small things, and secure transport roles. If you want an escort, bridge T3s or bomber or recons.
---
For 99% of the player-base, each player makes their own money, and they can only pilot one of their ships at a time. There are very few exceptions. To list a few of them:
---
1.) Corporations can (and do) tax their members, usually it's a flat 5 or 10% of each individual's income. For the most part, that money goes back to the corporation in the form of physical infrastructure (citadels), insurance (SRP), corporate fleets or campaign financing. However, the CEO or other directors can, in theory, use the money for themselves. The lines get a little blury in cases such as alliances subsidizing the personal ships of their key members (FCs, for example), in order to help them win fights, etc. People in control of corporate cash reserves do sometimes steal them, and this is perfectly legal in the game. 
---
2.) Systems can be rented to weaker groups, that income is then collected by the corporation and is used in much the same way as taxes
---
3.) There are certain activities which require a group of players to complete. Some PvE examples include frigate abyssal runs, Sansha incursions, Triglavian invasions, but there are also group financial ventures based around PvP, such as evicting hostile wormholes. If you can destroy someone's structures in a wormhole, you get whatever they had stored in there, and may end up with a massive profit. The loot from any of these activities is usually divided equally, or according to some other scheme the players agree between each other. 
---
Even in the case of simple money-making, such as ratting (killing NPCs for money), or mining, you require some abstract degree of cooperation. You need an alliance to protect you and build infrastructure, organize the export, import and/or sale of your product and so on. But on a basic, straight-forward level, you are making money in isolation from other players. When ratting, you usually do it alone, and the money goes straight into your pocket. 
---
&gt;I suppose the existance of bots is the main obstacle to RMT being illegal in game?
---
I'm not exactly sure what you mean by this, but even without bots, RMT would almost certainly be strictly illegal in terms of the EULA. Very, very few games out there permit trading in-game items or currency for real money, with the exception of paying the game company itself for items. 
---
&gt;If bot accounts were impossible, then even the cheapest jobs that still need to be done by the in game economy would become more valuable as there would be a demand for an actual human to sit and do them.
---
This is almost certainly true - bots make up a significant portion of the influx of money into the game (a.k.a. an ISK 'faucet'), so removing that would deflate the currency (increase the value of ISK).
---
gardze wami smiecie z kazdym dniem bardziej. i tak to przetrwam i tak nie zmienie do was podejscia bo wasze wobec mnie jest tylko coraz gorsze. pluje wam na mordy chore pojeby
---
People aren't angry that players make ISK with those ships. The issue is with the amount of safety they bring. Remove the ability of caps being able to fit cynos would be a start.
---
Get a cloak, get to the site you want (if battle make sure you're well away from the actual fleets) then use the freecam.

---
do we all get a welcome back cup after subbing for a certain amount of time? i have like 11 accounts i kinda want to reactivate after a 14 month break, just not entirely convined yet...?
---
I assume its easier to implement new things than rework old ones due to being tied to many things. It would be nice to see some rebalance to lowclass WH space ratting at some point. Mainly adjust the sites / spawns a bit to make all the sites worth it.
---
Still not correct, sorry. It's pretty common to bring in Caps from Low / Null and to drop them out of wandering Low / Null connections.
---
This gif is simultaneously the best and worst thing ever.
---
Local and perfect Intel kill more content than anything
---
:) No worries. I reactivated my 50 account swarm thanks to Blackout. Hopefully that puts a nice offset to the carebear/bot crybabies that unsubbed and sends a message that these changes are what we need for continued health and fun of the game.
---
It's definitely not. I bought two 1 mill SP packs and these are the skins I received. I'm not able to login at the moment but I could confirm later as one character still hasn't used them.
---
Hmm tried that it 
---
Everybody shows up under SSO character management but don't appear on the right hand dropdown menu.
---
I'd be all for a covops cloaked JF. You still have to deal with glacial align times, so the cloak doesn't make them OP when going gate to gate.
---
And you could always introduce a penalty to a cloak fitted JF, like a cargo space hit, or slower align.
---
Public jump beacon for JFs only

Remove the Venture's stab bonus if it goes into a plex at least....

They are different skins, the 1m one came with incursus sukevestra, and Merlin Matagu seabeast. Don't remember other 2 but they weren't those 2.

:)  /r/whydoesthisexist/
---
People ain’t going to just give you a 20 bn well fitted super  ship easily, it’s supposed to be hard to catch or it makes no sense to own one drop the cost of a super to 500 million and sure we will feed to you as much as you want.
---
Not sure why you're being a prick about it.  Something up your bum?
---
What about a T3 industrial hull, with subsystems geared for cloak, speed, cargo size etc.
---
Man those guys were bad. One of the worst groups I've ever seen lol. They used to just feed Sabres to me when I solo roamed their space.
---
I...I dont see the cap batteries :"(
---
Just to be clear about my intent. I'm not raging, I'm hurting.
---
I brought math into it was to give you a clear example of how I'm being hurt, because 'feelings' should never be acted on.
---
At the end of the day I'm not asking for local to be returned, nor am I crying about losing ships. I'm giving you a reasoned argument about how &amp; who this change hurts so that you see that there is actually another side to this discussion other than the incessant furor on this sub about how this is the best thing ever

So by your definition:

a) Low chance they would care/understand

b) Low chance they would be on /r/eve.

Thank you!

Dont tell me! I didn't get whooshed did i?
---
Seems a bit desperate, but hey.

or maybe constellation of regional chat instead of local, make locals do some work for intel

I don't know, I've never used it before. I imagine it's probably like any other software?

Also, how do I roll a null gate to keep people away from my secret cave like bearholers?

But you all want big greedy kills 20 bn supers 100 bn titans on your kill boards , just as greedy as the person who worked for it but less honorable because you want to kill these ships easily , and cry and whine because it ain’t easy to kill them ! Drop the price of a super or titan to the price of an Frigate and everybody will be pvping in supers and titans , and game will get boring again , these ships ARE NOT Supposed to be easy catch 🤔
---
they get me every time
---
I have the same issue.
---
This, this is the real information we need to know.
---
But do YOU have the evidences?
---
Low Sec is hurt by Null Sec being so empty and organized into a few wagon wheels.  Why settle for Low Sec when I can set up in Goons,Legacy, Panfam, and etc. or semi dead area.  Margins are worth it.   You can't nerf good organization.  Or stay in High Sec and when you want content go with a NPSI group.
---
This would go a long way to make Eve fun to play again.  I always loved low sec especially the fw brawls for system control.  Small gang fleet fights were epic too.  Null sec and tidi blob warfare always ruined the game for me.
---
CCP Used to charge a smaller monthly fee for steam users but no longer, they ended up upping the price.
---
I quote a mail some time ago...
---
&gt;CCP is adjusting some EVE Online pricing on Steam. It is very important to CCP that players in the same region pay the same price and therefore the   
---
&gt;Omega pricing is being adjusted for a limited number of players. Your EVE Online: Omega subscription price will change and the new price will be R 202.00.
---
Was about a 70% price increase.
---
That would be $%&amp;#ing awesome. Regular convoys becoming necessary and having to be planned for and defended, either well or poorly. 
---
The possibilities.
---
Can only upvote once. Sadly.
---
Make EVE into your hellscape vision of yours please falcon.
---
Make it permanent /u/CCP_Falcon - please! We believe!
---
because its gay
---
That’s a lot more work compared to adding a special cargo hold to an existing ship.
---
I wonder how many bots are out of work now that there is no need for them to sit AFK and report when a non-blue enters the regional "entry" system.
---
Exactly what I was wondering, thanks for the info!
---
&gt; If this is a 2nd go around for ccp to sell Sp its more limited than last time but I'm not convinced its good as it goes against what they said in a dev blog a few weeks back.
---
They've been selling this bundle on Steam for a while now as well.
---
"I am a really ballsy pilot because I rat under the Goon umbrella even when there is no local!"

3months mct? that's cool but I think it's just one month of multiple character training
---
You can view kill mails in the Corp menu in game.
---
Was this a public tourney?
---
This is  sign of hard work and  choosing right products and sell it to right audience
---
while trying to make extra income from home can be a big issue;
---
It is should not be tasking to  do, it is about learning and choosing [the right product](http://www.kemisalami.com)
---
So basically wcs aren't ruining pvp, they are just making it so hunters have to work harder to gank?
---
Ban anything above dreadnoughts.
---
I don't know enough to be sure but that sounds harder to code than just putting the ship on a no entry list.
---
FUCK YOU
---
Got a lot of kills over the weekend. While I think the black out was nice I think it a bit to over powered.
---
As a more middle ground between perfect intel and black out I think a delayed local based off the ADM would be more of a balanced mechanic. With a 0 ADM having a max time of 10 minutes and max ADM of 1 minute delayed.
---
If balanced along this line though Excavators as they are very vulnerable to bombs and booshing would need to be re-looked at. Since I'm not a balance expert I will leave this as is.
---
Talk dirty to me
---
The Evanova cell app's "assets" function will also allow you to view the contents of the asset safety canisters.
---
haha, got'em
---
actually not that bad considering 3 months of MCT basically equals about 13 injectors which after the cost of extractors comes in around 6.5B.
---
&gt;I'd probably keep local delayed, go regional in lowsec and keep highsec as it is now
---
This.
---
It's tiered, it's in escalating level of hardship, and it reflects the idea that the more you go into lower sec the less infrastructure is there for you to make your life easy.
---
Ugh, you're one of these idiots that conflates any notice of difference as 'hate' eh? "Oh they're poking fun and being a little mean, they must be filled with hate." Eve is a mean place, no one cares enough about you to hate you, get over yourself carebear.
---
Bots don't use Local to talk, they watch Local and instantly try to run and hide when they see a scary face appear.
---
The increased risk in WHs is the inability to hotdrop a thousand Titans.
---
They aren't taking away Local completely, just the way your name immediately appears when you enter system. You can still chat (as if there are oh so many people chatting in Null Local)
---
There do appear to be new Citadel modules relating to Local comms. So they may be leaving it off, unless the residents turn it back on themselves.
---
Have you gotten to roam during Blackout any with your undercover Non-CCP account? Shit is cash money my dude
---
Better to just remove stab's from Venture's all together and replace it with a weight reduction bonus to be able to align faster and mwd faster out of enemy bubble with the chance to warp off if the gate camp is sleeping or burnt out of point range.
---
im a new player , i’ll take your stuff off your hands for free
---
we're now offering pilots the chance to grab three months of Multiple Character Training for just $1 / €1 / £1 / RUB 29 when you buy 3 months of omega time
---
Do you want three players online, because that's how you get three players online :D
---
I don't log in everyday, hence why I said out of game experience.
---
Plus zkill aggregates and visualizes the data a lot better. Prices are localized to jita, top character rankings as well.
---
Hilmar , really dude, before write think to ALL impact of you're sentence. Not only of " ho yea remove it to kill people in FW".
---
These are wandering holes, as opposed to statics, which can be rolled. [http://anoik.is/systems](http://anoik.is/systems) Have a play with that, it shows the region and constellation too
---
Yeah I am pretty sure that is who they are talking about.
---
Ok awesome. Now.. what to do with that. My alts aready have cyno and PI skills lol
---
Delete them!
---
Well, the Vargur certainly didn't.
---
Falcon for Emperor of CCP!
---
I agree that there's another side to this, not denying that at all.
---
I just don't believe that ISK should come so easy in nullsec, and that the ISK faucets need to be hammered into the ground.
---
That said, I also think I'd take a serious look at the amount of ISK made from highsec incursions too.
---
Nullsec isn't the only issue.
---
i posted above, but just train to extract the skills.  3months ends up being around 6.5B isk at current rates.
---
God yes. So much this.
---
Lmao at least think a little bit about your suggestion.
---
You wouldn't ever be able to escalate with this. No dreadbombs, no bringing in a fax to support a fleet, no cap fights at all.
---
You wouldn't be able to jf at all since people would just sit on lowsec undock in bricktanked ships blocking jf cynos.
---
This is just some brain dead "I want my playstyle to be the best" shit.
---
They don't *need* to, it just makes their life easier.
---
What a great arguement...
---
If it wasn't for killboards a huge amount of historical informations about pilots wouldn't be available for free. If you had never interacted with that pilot it would be a new experience instead of already having a decent idea of what they fly and who might be with them.
---
Your cynicism is healthy, and warranted.  The EVE universe can be quite harsh! 
---
That being said, a deal is a deal. We have a lot of people doing good work finding places for people. o7
---
Was this when they where trying to kill the Titan.
---
This would be for one additional characters training per month right, not 2?
---
It’s 3months +90 day mct (NOT 3 mct) 90 days auto scriver for account
---
Doesn't matter who's fault it is lets just remove them from game :D &lt;3
---
Yes and I'd like it to stay that way.

Stop asking for everything to be handed to you on a platter.

just sub 3k more accounts to compensate the loss ....
---
MCT  not equal to MLTC.
---
One is training, the other is tradeable certificate.
---
Manfred, Progod, Vily are in TEST. 
---
SuperTwinky69 hasn't played in years from what I remember. 
---
Vince FC's once in a blue moon and Travis very occasionally shows up to do a thing. 
---
ELO is still active FC in his corp Origin. (currently in Fraternity. alliance).
---
In current EVE any fleet with  "big name" FC's in will have so many support FCs and other roles in it that you don't really "See them in action" like you used to , at least not in the vein of the time period talked about by the OP.
---
If you agree with what ccp said a while ago and that local is intended for local communication but NOT an intelligence tool, then having it behave like wormholes is the best solution. It should be like that for all secs
---
CSM Guy! Congrats.
---
Can we just do it every weekend instead? I think it's a fair compromise.
---
I can neither confirm nor deny whether I've been shooting the shit out of people in nullsec.
---
Falcon you my friend are an idol and hero to the vets of old. 2006-2016 here been gone since. Came back as soon as I herd about blackout. Thank you with all of my gamer love for leading the charge fixing Eve. If Bob wills it.
---
There's a ton of information already out there about BoB . These groups I did not knew so much about them or didn't knew anything at all.
---
And of course I resubbed for 3 months last week xD  Story of my life I tell you
---
Have my children thanks
---
Can we get the imp price updated to like 300+ bil? 120 bil is embarrassing.
---
Make the FW complex take twice as long to capture if anyone there has stabs fitted
---
nice way to train multiple rorqual alts on the same account for quick, easy and safe multi-region mining.
---
you trying to kill him O.o
---
So Amarr once again is the victor. The Minmatar guys need a new plan I think.
---
it is turning out to be ok,  still to much free intel in eve
---
This would have the opposite effect, IMO. Fewer but more valuable anoms means krabbing would be focused and more easy to defend. 
---
I'd make it so that indexes work the other way around. Instead of improving the more you farm a system, it should make it worse. Tie the rate of "replenishing" to better truesec, to keep some systems more valuable than others. This would force people to spread, as the more easily defended systems would be more likely to be overfarmed.
---
As an autistic jf pilot I think they're overpowered as fuck
---
alliance wide t1 hauler ops when?
---
Confucius.
---
1.
---
a) Scram doesn't prevent you from jumping in a wormhole or a gate, only warping off. It might be a good option, but depending on how they're organized, they might already have a sabre cloaked on the other side or people ready to jump as soon as they see you head towards it.
---
b) It's also an alright option, but they might have something that can travel much faster than you and decloak you that way. If you start moving in a direction and then abruptly switch directions you'll have a better chance
---
c) Gate cloak makes you completely invulnerable, so they can't even hit you with smartbombs or decloak you. You should probably act fast because you might just be able to move before they wake up.
---
d) Overheat everything, burn out of the bubble, launch ecm drones and try to fight them off and then die in a blazing fire dedicated to Bob. Praise Bob.
---
2.
---
a) You need 2 stabs to counter a single scram. Basically, if your warp strength is equal or less than 0, you can warp.
---
b) Hang around 3000m-5000m off the can and pay attention to the overview while hacking. As soon as you see a ship in the overview, cloak up and the can won't decloak you, then warp off. If you do it fast enough, you might have enough time to cloak before they target you. Orbiting is useless. If you can hack a can while aligning, that might work, but you're probably going to pass the can before you're done hacking. 
---
You could try pre-aligning and stopping the ship so all your ship needs to do is to accelerate to warp, but it's a bit finicky to stay that close to the can while aligning, so you're better off minimizing the time you spend decloaked, and lessen the chance that someone sees you and sets a trap for you in the next site/wormhole. 
---
c) Jamming someone follows this formula:  
---
chance to jam = 1 - (1 - (ECM strength/sensor strength))^(number of drones)
---
Sensor strength depends on the ship you are targeting and ECM strength is fixed for drones (1 for light, 1.5 for medium and 2 for heavy). Bigger ships have more sensor strength, so usually target the smaller ship, but that's not always true (as we'll see here). The Hecate has 14 sensor strength, so with Hornet EC-300, you have 30.9% chance every drone cycle (20 secs) to jam it. The Nemesis has even more strength (20), so you only have a 22.6% chance to jam it every cycle. It's really a measure of last resort, the chances for them to work are pretty small.
---
? I kinda do not get this.
---
Mother Amamake approves.
---
I haven't played the game in years but trust me that no matter when the web is applied it at worst has no affect on how fast you warp.  I used to web down my own orcas and freighters all the time to get to places faster.  Once incursions were a thing I did that pretty commonly for months since I had probably a good 15-20 bil hidden in my corp hangar on the orca.
---
It is a nerf to the relative saftey of ratting in nullsec.  however this additional change would further force people to spread out more, ideally forcing people far enough that cap umbrellas cannot cover everyone
---
wow youre so brave
---
SuperTwinky69 is one of my all time favorite FC's. He was super abrasive in possibly every way you can be, but out of the hundreds and hundreds of fleets I have been in, his were the most overall fun and overall most intense I've ever had. 
---
The most fun/intense of all his fleets was one night we stayed up into the Russian TZ to see if they were going to attack one of our Tech moon towers in Geminate back when they were printing pure gold. 
---
So as the fleet started he was like lets go all in and we dropped a US tz super fleet in Russian prime time and fought their supers over a POS. I do not remember how it turned out at all but it was fun and exciting and totally worth staying up that late. I will see if I can find the BR but it was years and years ago. 
---
\#EVEfcstories
---
 Should people have no way what so ever to counter disruptors? What's the point of even playing then if every hauler and miner is just 100% at the mercy of every hunter out there?
---
I'm new here so I don't know if there's another counter to scrams and disruptors but if there were absolutely no way what so ever to counter them, and I was just forced to be destroyed in my miner or hauler every time a player decides it's time to destroy me then I probably wouldn't play because then the game would be fully tilted towards hunters with no balance what so ever.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but are warp cores stabs not the only defence to disruptors other than just being a high sec carebare?
---
Yo, nice AAR!
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
From our POV we jumped into Isbrabata to see some Minmatar aligned battleships looking very exposed and off gate, FC decided to let them go to ensure there actually was a fight to 3rd party, they were already totally outnumbered...and he didn't want to be late for the rumble.
---
We land on grid and DHSJ Gilas are at a nice range for us, so we plink a few before we got to work on the Amarr Abaddons whilst deleting the 44th Recons Griffin wing.  The Abaddons were constantly getting booshed off their FAX so we switched to the Gilas we could shoot in the CALSF lead fleet which caused a bit of controversy.  They got safe, so we switched to the Two Maidens One Chalice Cerbs, who as usual were at max coward range.  Volleyed them with aurora much to the fleets delight until they also got safe.
---
You boys land back on your FAX to push us off and we start to clear Abaddons again, this time under reps.  The blue portion of the CALSF Gila fleet pulls an aggressive warp in so we switch to them.  Was enough to see the caps escape.  We clap the remaining small stuff off grid and get looting.
---
I had a massive hangover throughout that thing, hardly said a word on comms lol
---
Was fun, GF!
---
I know of at least four players who would play it that way so your logic is invalid!
---
I'm all for no local in lowsec, we operate 100% with enemies/neutrals in local and are used to perma d-scanning.
---
If nullsec players complain and quit the game then give them their local and safety back but then reduce the rewards for nullsec.
---
\-swap nullsec moons with low sec moon's 
---
\-swap lowsec anom's/ded/scanned sites with null sec ones.
---
and then remove local from low sec :\], none of us low sec guys would complain we are made of man steel.
---
Then progression would be high sec -&gt; null sec -&gt; low sec -&gt; Wormholes in order of risk/reward and all will be good in the world.
---
Even if its less (i dont know) that doesnt necessarily mean a drop in sub numbers. Before, 10 bots would be on 23/7, but 15 players may be on 4/5, resulting in a situation where it appears there are 1) less subs, and 2) less actual PEOPLE in space, where neither may be true.
---
Only CCP can know the true numbers.
---
Ratting and mining on WH and Low:
---
Mining on low: pre ping for mining OP. Probers scan sistems up and down. Get every WH. 
---
Rollers close that WHs
---
Gate camps are set on strategic bottlenecks
---
Finaly, rorqs undock. Haulers works FAF.
---
Everyone is on the keyboard, everyone is on coms. We talk, laught, we spend time as a corp/alliance of Friends.
---
From time to time. Someone falls on the gatecamps. Time to time someone try to break the gate camps. Nice brawls are fought.
---
Also, new wh apears. Sometimes even people with bad intentions about our rorqs come from it.
---
See? This can be done in nullsec. It means PLAYING THE GAME. People who complains is or worry about his bots, or just wanna multibox 10 rorq as he watch Netflix.
---
How about shitching the way indexes work? Instead of a system improving if you farm it, make it so it becomes "depleted". THis would force people to spread out. Tie the replenishing to truesec, so some sytems remain more valuable than others.
---
My dad would absolutely use a full rack of stabs on his agility fit mammoth, wouldn't he? Dad?
---
His corpmate loved the handling when he borrowed it to haul fuel into their C2, despite the rather limited cargo capacity. 
---
Ofc both were rather young at the time, and that ship never encountered any opposition.
---
Oh Jesus fucking Christ, just to get a quick idea on the mammoth slot layout I googled it.
---
Ok I used "eve mammoth fitting" as search term.  
---
This is the first Google hit I got:

Isn't it horrible?
---
Eve has a community full of programmers and IT professionals. Communities do some crazy things when they work together.
---
Adding a 1 to 5 minute delay, based on upgrades to a structure would pretty much mean all bots die as well. If you can't probe down and catch a bot in that 1 minute (or 5 if they aren't fueling an entire region and let us say it's part of the ihub you could entosis to take down a whole constellation).
---
Because carebears don't know how to reddit?

Well, they won their objective but the bad guys made them pay for it

This is a windows 10 desktop manager issue.  There is no simple solution for eve.

Interval One - Irrelevant here  
---
Update - Irrelevant  
---
Game Mode - Somewhat Relevant
---
There are 3 known factors for eve, and if you get them all you can get the inactive windows to do around 110-120 fps on a 144 hz screen (while the main window is 144hz).  
---
Game Mode Off  
---
FullScreen Optimizations Off  
---
One other thing I will try to find and reply/edit with  
---
The 2/3 here should get you to 80/90 ish fps on inactive windows.
---
True.
---
Hi! I always enjoyed seeing you on the forums in the old (old, old) days. I don't think we ever interacted in game, though. CCP should listen to your grizzled old pirate self.
---
^^Senpai ^^^noticed ^^^^me!
---
Why are you so angry? 
---
I’m not a super pilot, I just saw someone being sarcastic about how a lot of them aren’t flying because of the blackout so I was sarcastic back.
---
awesome, thanks. 
---
Where can I find the FullScreen Optimization? Is it a EVE or Windows feature?
---
Yeah. Not once but twice did I have to read your nonsense.
---
What? Is that projection or transference? Can you show me on this nullbear where the mean SJW touched you?
---
this was actually proposed by someone at the WH roundtable in 2017. It was  also not the dumbest thing brought up there.
---
Look man, all you have to do is read the bio carefully and send exactly the right amount of isk.  No refunds.  Not my fault if you didnt play by the rules.

&gt;As long as its well thought out

As much as people are clamoring for the return of arrr pirate way of life. This would advocate to get rid of the shifty-loner black market type. Which also has it's place in most games.

Botcheck this retard pls?
---
Sorry, but from a roaming cruiser balance perspective, the VNI has been extremely strong. The fact that you can effectively rat in a pvp fit and still get better ticks than most DEDICATED RATTING PLATFORMS is absurd, and the fact that it can 1v1 just about anything that can catch it, up to and including T3Cs...
---
Seriously have you been staying up too long talking to your bots?
---
the one and only time i experienced him was when he got into tri somehow, he asked for double bubble dictors like a year after they stopped existed, spewed some racist shit, and that was the first and last time i ever flew with him.
---
They would care and understand that now null is more dangerous. What does trying to make risk-free isk in null have to do with using reddit or not?
---
I like the idea. Not sure I can gimmick tank it against explosive hard enough, but if I can, it's a great idea.
---
Seems like a good reason to have a third kind of cyno broken out for supers only.
---
Leave LS alone, but forbid the new 'super' cyno, restrict it to NS only. Requires substantially more fuel 1km3 or so, and pair it with a BS cargo buff.
---
Yeah, were much more lively and less generic
---
Breath of fresh air! Thank you!
---
Of course it should be hard to kill, that's why it has 20 warp core strength, a strong armament of fighters, and the capability to tank. What was inevitable and CCP did a poor job of planning for was everyone owning one now, and certain groups packing into one area and meaning they are unkillable if in said area (the umbrella). They are completely safe when in the umbrella, and there is no counter play to that. 
---
That's the issue.
---
Bruh if null activity drops that hard because you "might" get blown up rather than having a definite get out of jail free card in a game like EVE...maybe null activity needs to drop hard.
---
bruh 🤣🙌😎💪💪
---
HAWS were a mistake
---
Make fighters able to die more than 1 a time
---
Nerf support fighters
---
K thx
---
Nope. It's cheap stuff for me
---
Highsec Incursions have needed the nerf bat forever.
---
Are there metrics about what type of ship people are using to rat? I think it would be really interesting to know if the reason bounties are so incredibly out of hand is because supers/titans are viable and extremely efficient for ratting, or if its the thousands of VNIs that are responsible for the majority of the faucet.
---
And I'm curious, if you got your wish, and the ISK faucets in null dissapear, what do you envision would be the allure of null? I imagine there's some magic number(25% better than low, 30%, etc) where people would live there anyways, but is that known?
---
CCP fixing lowsec confirmed??? :-D
---
I overstated, just checked we were never more than 250 chars. Usual "Fleetsize" was 2-10, maybe 20-25 on "CTA", usually than already multiboxing heavily. 
---
Our opponents at that time were f.e. FA with CFC backup on timers (2.5k + 40k) or for R64 moons NC., DARKNESS, Kadeshi, PL and so on ...
---
yep, loved his fleets.
---
im a new bro and i say fuck safety!
---
Go do soe arc and cosmos instead perhaps. Not sure if cosmos shares epic arc does share.
---
I'd build and run Sarum skin t3 Providence freighters with titan level tanks and 1k dps. Would be hilarious. It would still die to a group of 4-5 dudes unsupported.. but in a convoy it could take a real beating.
---
&gt; It feels really spooky and like anything can happen.
---
ok but has anything actually happened?
---
im holding out until they include 1 mil sp for the pack also
---
I would come back to EVE if CCP actually made changes like this. 
---
The game died for me when incursions were introduced and everyone left nullsec
---
"pls sub so the nr of subs dont drop whit the blackout" -ccp
---
Eve is not a safe space. You aren’t supposed to be safe. If you get tackled bring in the fleet.
---
For an MMO... that’s small
---
They can send you across constellation borders on rare occasions, but iirc they wont send you across region borders.  If your mission hub lies near a lowsec system in the same region/constellation, you could be sent there regularly.  You can always skip it.  If the LS system comes up more than once every four hours you can decide to take the standings hit or just move to a different agent for a bit.
---
That's reasonable. Yeah, I have trouble with similar. I tend to have my overview pretty wide too.
---
No they're not.  They cost so much more for a reason.  They hold less than Freighter for a reason.
---
It's not for you, it's for bribing the devs with!
---
In the past, I've successfully petitioned CCP when this has happened.  I think my situation was closer in time (within a day or two), but they gave me the deal anyways.  Worth a shot.
---
This would be amazing. 
---
Great example would be last night, my small Corp with 2 people was successfully defending a poco from 10. After they ran and hid they called the bat phone cyno to take the poco. 
---
No cyno lowsec would let you try different ways to defend, like on gates before they moved in for the timer. The inevitable escalation would happen too late to RF or require more planning/staging.
---
This guy goons.
---
maaan forget that noise, throw people into the frey! 
---
Eve is great when its chaos, i jumped into eve and went straight to the danger zone and am loving it 🥰
---
this is unironically a good thing. make resources scarce again
---
&gt;HAWS were a mistake
---
Don't forget Bosons!
---
&gt;Nerf fighter speed
---
Fighter speed isn't as much of a problem as support fighters. Why do carriers get swappable infinite range web or point?
---
&gt; quality over quantity content. Space already feels emptier, and may yet become even more empty, but when encounters happen, at least for me so far, they have been far more meaningful and memorable… because they’re not flown by fucking scripts
---
Finally, because there is less noise, roams have the potential to be chill again. I’d take 15 empty systems in the new format over 5 empty systems and 10 VNIs in the old… because in the old format I *had* to waste my time chasing them down on the off chance one was a fuck-up. Fewer or no bots cleans this up nicely. You can have a 3 hour empty handed roam and even feel a little good about it… sometimes it’s relaxing to just boat around EVE with the music on, and not have to do case-work on every bot you come across.
---
so you would rather have nothing to hunt than fail at hunting bots?
---
Lies and slander.. I reactivated as well after 3 years, and I don't see any cups!
---
I have seen several JFs die on the the cyno beacons on grid with keepstars. Just a matter of patience.
---
Yeah
---
&gt; Highsec Incursions have needed the nerf bat forever.
---
Yup.
---
&gt; Are there metrics about what type of ship people are using to rat? I think it would be really interesting to know if the reason bounties are so incredibly out of hand is because supers/titans are viable and extremely efficient for ratting, or if its the thousands of VNIs that are responsible for the majority of the faucet.
---
Yep, we have a lot of data to hand, and it's obscene how safe cap ratting is in null. It's not even funny, it's just depressing and needs to be fixed in my opinion.
---
&gt; And I'm curious, if you got your wish, and the ISK faucets in null dissapear, what do you envision would be the allure of null? I imagine there's some magic number(25% better than low, 30%, etc) where people would live there anyways, but is that known?
---
I'm not advocating for them to dissapear, or for them to necessarily change that much. I'm advocating for people to actually have to work to get the ISK that they're raking in.
---
Being able to literally just go AFK while you're ratting in null, or sitting AFK ratting in a cap/super/titan isn't okay in my book.
---
yeah and what you pay for with that software is a whole swath of other stuff which I don't need and don't want.
---
Im mean if only you knew someone who works at CCP that would listen to your ideas... we live in hope. Hope and dreams
---
unfortunately they did'nt create one, but as an explanation why the balancing/upgrade of the ships now needs more ressources to build them it would have been ok
---
Super interesting thread. I remember hearing about Verone getting a job w/ CCP, but did not realize he was Falcon.
---
I remember hanging out in their channel back in the day, flying with several of them. Probably could have joined if not for ending up CEO of my own pirate corp. VETO was a great group of pirates.
---
This certainly changes my view of CCP, I did not realize any of them had done piracy or played the game beyond the most casual high sec carebearing or null sec line member crap.
---
Certainly most of the changes over the past 15 years had the effect of making new eden more safe and combat less likely to ever occur. Please reverse that.
---
Damn, math has foiled me again.
---
Capitals were fine when their entire role was being anti-structure/anti-capital ships. 
---
I will never understand why titans/supers/dreads were ever allowed to punch down at anything smaller than a battleship
---
Requiring a fleet every activity in this game will cause burn out and more wagon wheeling.
---
Have that toon in it's own fleet (if you dont want it in one of the adverted ones)? this is my own version of auto-reject as you don't have to reset the settings later.
---
This is the kind of shit that'd make me re-sub after 3 years....the black out has made it tempting as hell already...no...stop never mind I enjoy having life again too much...
---
RIP your free MCTs bro
---
Idk man. 
---
Gonna wait it out here and see what shakes out.
---
Have a look on oNodrak's answer, this finally worked out for me
---
nice, this was way more than i expected. thank you for taking your time.  i'll try option 1-d one of these days, sounds like fun.
---
No balls
---
Hi, Verone this is Mutnin I didn't know you were out of the closet now.. lol but I always knew it was you "because of falcon".. Anyway can you please fix this game so small groups can play again.. It's just lame all the blue shit and bigger and bigger groups..
---
Also can we just have the drifters delete all titans &amp; super carriers? End that whole bit of nonsense...
---
You know how spooked I would be when logging in my super and seeing spammed previous fleet invites...
---
SJW? Eh, no this is an eve thing and I'll thank you to not try to roll it up in whatever worldview you have.
---
Orcas also have larger drone bays than they used to.  So they can rock a proper variety of drones for fightingor jamming off small attackers.
---
And yeah theres a very very large difference in ehp between a full booster/mining orca and a tanked orca.
---
Some what retarded when it comes to stuff like this are these all ingame options or hidden within the OS drivers?
---
In all seriousness falcon lowsec needs revitalization. I used to play in lowsec but had to move to Jspace to find suitable small gang content. A local delay or a regional local for lowsec would be an amazing idea please pass it onto the dev team.
---
Gotta be careful with the truesec bit, as I've always heard npc null is treated (mechanics wise) as -1.0. Would hate to see the big blocs just shift over to dominating all the pirate nulls. If that isn't the case, disregard. 
---
Otherwise I agree with the diminishing return based on farm rate.
---
LOL... this was my first thought when i saw his statement. i don't the module itself is all that bad as in most situations it is definitely a trade off for that low slot. The use of the stab in FW is indeed worrisome, however, if the warp stab is eliminated  don't we just end up with insta warpers in fw sites? seems the interaction within the site is the biggest issue.
---
Blow up starry eyed new players.
---
You live your best life man.
---
Maybe normal local on HS. 5 to 30 seg of delay on LS. Opt in (current WH and NS) in NS.
---
That makes that being in a 0.1 is more dangerous than a 0.4. for example.
---
Edit: the hunter do not only not show up in local, but he can't see who is in it eighter. You are able to see it as soon you pop up in it. Otherwise, the hunter has too much adv over the minner/ratter and make it more dangerous than null.
---
Howmany kilos you want. We have a harbo shop down the road. If you can get the implemented i will send it to you.
---
Thats how eve is ment to be played    on comms laughing    spend time as a corp and alliance
---
CCPlease!
---
Lmao
---
eve is real, I was there!
---
It just seems not worth the potential of getting destroyed everytime when trying to do some money making in null.  Like with the amount you are probably going to lose ships versus what you make just seems like you are either going to be making a loss or you will be gett less than you could elsewhere in game.
---
So much yes.
---
Blackout forever!
---
Make JF able to jump to cov cynos, job done?
---
&gt;Because carebears don't know how to reddit?
---
I think last time we had a poll the bias was heavily favored towards nullsec.
---
I just found out that it still struggles when I have 3 Clients running instead of 2. 
---
But its an improvment. 
---
Game mode and FullScreen Optimizations are Windows "features" . 
---
Just google them, there are many explanations on where to find those options
---
How about we first remove infinite ISK and mineral supply from the game, so actual trade and industry have meaning again? Then you pesky kids can have your fun campy pvp back.
---
You do understand that both having those ideas and realizing they might go too far is what makes you perfect for the job, right?
---

To be fair, how we would move super caps/titans in Lowsec without who is there?
---
I love this idea, but to move these through lowsec, i NEVER jump into a system that i dont know about EVERY pilot that is there (afk, in station or whatever).
---
Its just impossible to me, i dont know.
---
In my opinion, the best way for it all, is to delay the local chat in 15 second for every 0.1 security status. Instant for a 1.0 system and 300 seconds delay for a -1.0 system.
---
It would not fuck the game, as intel would take a "long time" and we would be good to "deal" with cloak campers.
---
Cloak camp still there, stronger than ever now.
---
Those are some interesting figures, I'd not seen a breakdown of the stats before.
---
I'll make sure to stick to 30km in future, only ever lost the one Garmur, but I've done less than 100 burners so that's  probably why
---
There are dozens of us!
---
You can always just sub for another 3 months and it adds the time to the end. So you will be good for 6 months
---
What about gimping/removing JFs and adding DST style freighters with "defense only" guns, unique EWAR, etc. We'd actually have "trade routes" in the game that people would fight over.
---
 [http://evenews24.com/2018/08/19/remove-jump-freighters-introduce-force-freighters/](http://evenews24.com/2018/08/19/remove-jump-freighters-introduce-force-freighters/)
---
A)  presumes someone min-maxing on that level actually pays for a sub.
---
B) If A is in fact true - then that means some SP onto the market at below market cost.  This is good on a personal level for those who buy SP.  
---
It is bad on a game level in the same way injectors are bad.  Were SP not tradeable I would have zero issue with this promotion.
---
Low-sec piracy has been eating a dick for as long as there has been no reason to be in low-sec.
---
if there was a reason to be out in space in low-sec, piracy would be back properly, but atm there's 2 reasons to be in low-sec, farm for VNIs and roleplaying.
---
#If it were up to him the effect would be permanent
---
So he's just confirmed it's not. 
---
Salty tears in 3
---
Yes all of this yes.
---
Not really complicated tbh.
---
The ships stab strength will be defined as a variable somewhere.
---
They could just use an IF statement to set a small collision function to test for for proximity to the plex beacon.  If it returns true set the variable that defines stab strength to zero.
---
When the ship leaves the proximity of the beacon, return stab value to 2.
---
Wouldnt take but a few lines of code.
---
I wasn't angry when I wrote it.  So I am wondering what personal issues you have that you read it in such a way.
---
They have all been reeeee purposed
---
&gt;Yep, we have a lot of data to hand, and it's obscene how safe cap ratting is in null. It's not even funny, it's just depressing and needs to be fixed in my opinion.
---
That would be really cool to see a visualization of, bounties earned by ship type. 
---
&gt;Being able to literally just go AFK while you're ratting in null, or sitting AFK ratting in a cap/super/titan isn't okay in my book.
---
So I can't speak for super/titan ratting, having never done it. But I know the incursions I've done in a carrier is just about the most hectic PvE I've ever done, its hardly an AFK activity. 
---
That said, I don't actually like supercaps being PvE ships at all. And my gut feeling is that making super/titan ratting nonviable would do a lot to bring the bounties back to sanity
---
risk and reward, why should I take out ishtar or expensive gila into anomaly for 10-20m TIK, when I have no control about losing it? I can go for hisec, just refit for fof raven/rattle/bargh and get same income on lvl4 (and it is much more easy with potency boosters) on max safety...   
---
just week and your enthusianism go down. if ppl want fly without local, they already do it in WH and as you can see WH is shit for most of eve ppl. and as well no local is shit for casual players much more than others
---
&gt; GET FREE SKILL POINTS TO FIGHT THE INVASION

Free?

sounds like you need a lowsec stream show/podcast
---
Happy little features
---
Yeah. We get deplexing bots.
---
Can't give that secret to a bearholer or they wouldn't be able to claim to live the hardest life in EVE. Aye?
---
Yup. Force them to move, making offensive interdiction more valuable. With ansiblexes added, offensive gate camping is REALLY weak at the moment, worse than any other point in the game's history. That's not good for content. Offensive gate camps were generally easy to break up anyway, and could generate fights when attacked.
---
NPC null has truesec values
---
He uses only Ventures to PVP and does a pretty good job at it
---
This. Fix fucking fighter application.
---
I figured you must be angry about something, otherwise why take it upon yourself to mock super pilots for undocking their 15+B ships with no local? 
---
But since you asked, I was having car issues and they cost me money I didn’t want to spend.
---
Instead of giving a cloak that can last indefinitely, could we explore a timed cloak for JFs? ie the ship is so big and not meant to carry one, so it will only last for a minute or two and then has a cooldown period? Just an idea, probably a bad one.
---
I live in lowsec, you missed the point.
---
I would like to subscribe to your brain
---
I also left in 2016 and am temptes to come back now. Didn't realize Falcon ran Veto. I remember those dudes.
---
Holy shit dude it's been so long - you should speak to Demetri and join us on the Veto veterans discord we have going :D 
---
Super nice to hear from you man, hope you're well &lt;3
---
huh? you are buying 3 months of omega.  you are clearly paying for a sub. 
---
6B is 12 injectors - extractors.  The price difference sits around 500M so 12X500.  Just simple math?
---
Serious reply: This would make those HS -&gt; 0.0 systems MUCH more valuable on a strategic level for logistics. You could also always jump your JF to a LS -&gt; null system and then gate your JF through lowsec.
---
Or you can even take Falcon's suggestion to allow JFs to use covert cynos.
---
haha not my call :D

Small remember: warp time wont take that much of time for all those clicks.

I multibox in eve since my second day, that is not doable. Check hsec gankers that DO NOT multibox and see their damage. After that, check the ones that multibox and try to see the pattern.
---
Then you will understand that guy is inputting.
---
lol good joke :-D there is low numbers mining in WH and close to zero mining in lowsec. just try it and during few minutes snuff titans break you mining op or so...just look at economic reports dumb...    
---
in WH you have mass tanking, just makes your static critical and you are safe on same level with local null sec. in null you had local and now, why should you undock when do not even know when there is small gang, blob or blob on bridge, supercap blob etc...  
---
do not tell ppl how they can play eve. if you like undock only with corpmates to play F1, it is your choice, others like something else...
---
If you quadrupled the price of a JF I doubt anything would change. They're insanely powerful compared to any freight alternative.
---
Falcon has something like eight pages of "fuck you" changes he'd make if given the chance. No local is one of them. 
---

I usually would, but this is an *electronic* item. It requires 0 humans to slave away for it. So u can shove a bologna sandwich up ur cute little face and let me have my crack.

I had zero clue you were that guy haha. I remember watching a q &amp; a at a eve fest and it seemed like every dude who got up was in your corp. 
---
Good to see ccp is still using some vet players over there.
---
Banning supers from lowsec would be a very interesting way to show the transition from low to null. There would be definite repercussions for navigation though, but even those might be desirable. If you had to move your super fleet through nullsec only, there'd be new choke points, and it would be even harder to 3rd party on fights on the opposite side of the universe.
---
You can use electronic warfare like sensor dampeners, ECM burst, or ECM drones to break a lock and warp out.

The guy I killed directly mentioned seeing the damage come online progressively and not at once. Your argument is invalid. :)
---
* How do you define defense only?
---
* What is unique EWAR?
---
* What class are these?
---
* What niche do they fill?
---
* How do we balance them?
---
* Are we prepared to wait a substantial amount of time for new ship designs?
---
These are just a few questions that come to mind in like 10 seconds of thinking - this is why it's often best to look at what you already have and iterate, change things up, work with what's already there.
---
Dumping new ship classes into the game shouldn't be something we just "do". There's enough ship classes right now that are struggling to find their roles. 
---
We should use them.
---
Apart from FAX, which I'd just delete if it was my call, lol.

Faction warfare L4 missions are bar-none the fastest way to rank up faction standing I've tried.

I ran out of shit from Fanfest months ago and it's just not the same here. If my kidneys are still working and I can feel my tongue, I might as well be eating twizzlers.
---
We do not speak of those left behind...
---
Its why they farm Provi instead of organizing to go after the umbrellas and big blocs.
---
You need 2 MCT to train all three characters on an account though right? How does that work in this case?
---
Yasssss
---
My alt is starting from zero, and the second account he'd be fleeted with isn't going to join FW, unfortunately.
---
How long before the turbo-krabs start crying that the event is unfair because they can't log in to claim rewards without local? 🤔🤔🤔
---
Imagine playing eve without 3rd party tools doing all the heavy lifting...
---
Wait, didn't the goons just have a meta show about this.  
---
Funny.
---
Would that of been in the Hurricane, Jackdaw or even, heaven forbid, the Claw fleets?
---
I genuinely do not recall being dunked by Snuff on three separate occasions during an Asher fleet. Not saying it never happened as I am Eu/tz and would often alarm clock for his shenanigans but even if it did it would not change anything regarding who is a good Fc and who is not, particularly when you look at the Casino/WWB war and the dynamics of what was actually happening at the time.
---
Oh fuck you're super right
---
Faction warfare is, correct me if I'm wrong, intended to be a cool place for small fights. Not a place for bots to farm. Fitting a ship exclusively to run away is what hurts PVP. When ships are fit this way, the only option left is to gank them.
---
And that's awesome. What does it have to do with them getting in plexes?
---
Maybe supers aren't designed to be moved easily and alone
---
I did in fact confuse east and west.  They're on the lower right side of the map, EZPZ
---
If you stop ventures from entering plexes you would be removing a valuable chunk of entertaining gameplay!!
---
&gt;And of course I resubbed for 3 months last week xD  Story of my life I tell you

Try opening a petition, CCP might be able to help you out.

---
That's what all the pod people say.
---
Don't you already have to d-scan your pvp area zones to not get jebaited?
---
The first one was ironically a change that was intended to buff hunters so that the prey don't see the k162 before the hunter can get into hole. 
---
Also it only.spawns when you jump the hole, not when you warp to it
---
Wherever trig incursions are taking place:
---

OMG yesssssss, cry harder.

The tears give me life.
---
I think it's more that the CFC needed a campaign close to home and manufactured a reason to go after them.  TEST being TEST made it super easy once they pulled the WE ARE THE REBEL ALLIANCE card.  
---
They came out of it way stronger in the long run tho
---
Yea will have to look for it, is it one I can just search for or do I need some super secret password
---
I  completely agree with the OP.  The fog of war needs to be real if this is to be a real sandbox.  Intelligence tools needs to come from within the game, not from outside the game, IMHO.
---
I think most ppl whos telling that blackout is good are just trying to get content in 0.0 but without local keeping healthy borders/sov protection is needed. Im not telling that local in this form(chat with all ppl) but maybe ship which have special scanner for system or something.  
---
No local in 0.0 changing this game completly to something different, and as we see, theres no significant increase in fights or super loses as it was intended.  
---
More likely will be no local in low sec as its is "pirate" space for players, and it suposed to be random and dangerous. 0.0 was intended to be dangerous but also to be tamed and holded by alliances
---
&gt; To be fair, how we would move super caps/titans in Lowsec without who is there?
---
You don't. If it were up to me I'd ban supers from lowsec. As for regular caps, HTFU, grow some balls, and roll the dice like everyone else - or have a friend scout for you, it's not rocket surgery. There's two Ms in MMORPG for a reason, use them.
---
&gt; I love this idea, but to move these through lowsec, i NEVER jump into a system that i dont know about EVERY pilot that is there (afk, in station or whatever).
---
Then you're highly risk averse, and part of the problem.
---
&gt; Its just impossible to me, i dont know.
---
It's not impossible, you just want a safety blanket. That's fine, but if changes like that were made you'd want to consider flying something else.
---
&gt; In my opinion, the best way for it all, is to delay the local chat in 15 second for every 0.1 security status. Instant for a 1.0 system and 300 seconds delay for a -1.0 system.
---
15 seconds is nothing, unless you're flying a Diemos, then it's basically the entire engagement. Space needs to be scary. I can remember jumping from highsec to lowsec and lowsec to nullsec back in the day. It was shit scary, even when you had a scout. EVE needs that adrenaline fuel back.
---
&gt; It would not fuck the game, as intel would take a "long time" and we would be good to "deal" with cloak campers.
---
No, it wouldn't, because it's not enough.
---
&gt; Cloak camp still there, stronger than ever now.
---
AFK cloakers are only a problem for people who are risk averse. Yes, it's a shit mechanic that people can just sit AFK in a system all day but cloaking has nothing to do with it. People shouldn't blame it on EVE if they don't have the balls to undock because someone's in the same system as them. They should grow a spine and play the game.
---
&gt; o7
---
Exploration ships have to spend more time on grid locking. Miners have to hug rocks and not take full advantage of range boost and higgs rig.
---
Probably because HS is supposed to be (mostly) safe and without good rewards so new players and more casual ones can get their feet wet; WH is already a dangerous place; and CCP doesn't actually know that LS exists.
---
The change to NS is mainly because it has become the safest are of the game while giving the biggest rewards, and it has been like that for years, so it's the ideal place to start. So stop crying about it like a little bitch.
---
For the record, I think most LS players would welcome any kind of change that makes the place more dangerous. (#)FuckLocal
---
Gate jf through lowsec, call me when you are doing it lol :D
---
I think that most PVPers would agree that an increase in nullsec ticks is a very fair trade for keeping blackout in place.
---
I personally stipulate that NS would be a pretty terrible place to live for MOST people if it were preserved as it is today...
---
But better ticks to bring it closer to WH ticks would be completely fair
---
There are many ways to make this livable for NS bears that don't include adding local back
---
&gt;The blackout forces good faith krabbers to actually think about what they're doing for a change
---
Lmao no, I just put out Miner IIs and go completely afk
---
Lol
---
link system, thx
---
Ratters who fit a WCS are mostly going to double up just for this reason.
---
WCS have been broken for a very long time, regardless of the state of local.
---
Sent you a DM! :D
---
Can't say I agree 100% with that, but I personally like the thought process behind falcon's actions here... EVE NEEDS A HARD SHAKE UP!
---
haha, the more you know!
---
What makes you think it was a bot?
---
TIL we have rorq bots. Diplos have been notified.
---
Tbh I wouldn't even be mad if that happened to titan and blops bridges too. Maybe a short spoolup time to check what's in range for the portal and calculate the required fuel - if there wasn't enough, it'd fail but still consume stront and even have a cool down.
---
I believe we call that "bloops".
---
Cynos still work. They're still incredibly safe if you light them in tether of a friendly structure. It's certainly not impossible to light one without local.
---
Maybe you're too afraid to risk your ship, in which case don't fly what you can't afford to lose.
---
Yeah, we held the record for the longest time of the most people from a corp at Fanfest. 
---
I still have the t-shirts, it was insane haha.
---
I think we got to the point where we had more than 50% of our active members at Fanfest one year.
---
"We want to see if blacking out local affects logins, so we are going to run these login promotions during the blackout"
---
I was going to say it was just an afk rorqual using mining drones, but the ore mined 216 is exactly a max skilled single cycle from an excavator.
---
This means this rorq, pulled drones, didn't compress ore, stacked ore, didn't move HW to the Fuel Bay, and didn't get help.
---
10000% bot lol.
---
I didnt told about being easy, i told about being ABLE to move it.
---
I cant see how i would be able to move it without knowing about local. Its easy when you are close to a umbrella, but  undoable in lowsec i think.
---
Delve
---
PBUH all the way bro
---
&gt; its a good balance between full loot pvp and safety/pve
---
Same and I move back to Steam due how easy it Valve makes it to play EVE Online on Linux where CCP doesnt do shit.
---
THERE ARE NO BOTS IN OUR ALLIANCE, ALL THIS IS PANFAM/IMPERIUM/WINTER/GOTG PROPAGANDA
---
that 10 cents a day subscription to innerspace is really painful... not.
---
It's not only the fault of local, but local was certainly a big part of the problem.
---
The other two big ones are
---
- Application of capital ships to subcaps. HAW shouldn't be a thing, nor should tackle fighters, light fighters are way too strong still.
---
- The ability to move capitals into (or out of, in a non-bubble scenario) a fight instantly with no counter. Cynos need some real hard looking at.
---
What gave you the idea that I was complaining? I like the changes and I think a shake up would be good for everyone. Wormholes are just as safe as null and people make ridiculous amounts of isk in j space so a shake up would be fun. As far as high sec it's been well noted that Concord is there to punish not protect and that philosophy would still stand but would motivate people to learn more of the game mechanics and wake up a bit.
---
I like blackout as well (been so long since I lived in WH space that I forgot how to d-scan) but I'd kinda like to see it act "intermittently" to go along with the lore of the shortage of whatchmacallit that makes the comm system work.  LIke maybe 1 hour of  local a day, randomly set.  Just to shitpost and mix things up a bit.
---
That doesn't sound like afk...
---
I bet he runs a male and female prostitution ring in Syndicate with his pimp headquarters in Poitot and a direct line to all the biggest gangsters in Jita. Then he uses the cash to bling out his rifters and paint them gold and pink.
---
No you can fight anywhere in a venture. Bring able to deplex a system with a day one alt with essential impunity is straight bullshit lol. 
---
It defeats the purpose of plexes, an area that draws combat ready ships toward each other with a goal to get them there. If this wasn't CCP's intention they wouldn't have banned warp core stabs from 4/5 of the plexes (with larges being the exception because they have no gates.)
---
I'm not saying they're infinitely effective, but he said he's a new player and I'm trying to answer the question honestly.
---
&gt; I have way too many bad ideas for EVE :D
---
Or great ones
---
Hell you can be poor and still have multiple displays, goodwill is a thing
---
Should add pirate faction to fw. Remember you guys mentioned adding a pirate faction back at pax east think that was 2012 sad it never got added
---
Same! You can even rotate the map in 3D!
---
Brb, spending an hour watching the kills roll in...
---
Nope.
---
&gt; Low-sec piracy has been eating a dick for as long as there has been no reason to be in low-sec.
---
To fix this you need to require nullsec alliances to gate transport ships through lowsec. At the moment they can just jump them onto a friendly tether on the highsec gate grid, so there is never anything to attack.
---
Except you will just get him killed.
---
Electronic warfare is only single target.
---
Warp stabs are the only thing that can save your freighter from gate camps.
---
Just keep the gates scouted and scan your sigs then? 
---
Most wormholers don't lock all the doors unless they are krabbing their hh, which as most of us that are enjoying blackout are in c2-5/ns that doesn't usually happen. We just keep our entrances scouted and pay attention to hole activations.
---
I mean not like you have to worry about people rolling in anyway, Stain's so dead it isn't worth roaming.
---
You did give that impression, since your sole argument is basically "I want everywhere to be the same" (which is pretty stupid), I thought you were a nullbear venting his frustration.
---
My previous argument (minus the now scratched part) stands. Some places need more attention or reworks than others, and often what works in one place won't do so in other.
---
where's the problem?
---
sure they can login and grab most of the SPs - to get them you only need to start the charakter screen. No need to start the game during the login events.
---
And for the Triglavian kills - ever heard of clones in hisec?
---
how dare you accuse ccp of changing something and making it worse
---
Seems like you are baiting
---
That is at least a buffer fit Proteus
---
Notwithstanding the fact it isn't nonsense, nobody's forcing you to read anything.  For example, I don't have to read your crap because I can just block you.
---
Good fight :)

I tabbed over and saw 2 sins 50km from me, 2 sets of heavy drones flying at me, and a sliver of cap left over. I didnt know the proteus was even there till I docked up. 20 minutes later I thought my notification was another athanor moon mining fleet invite from my corp
---
He never lost it.
---
&gt; male and female ~~prostitution ring~~ exotic dancer service thank you very much
---
Banning cynos would hurt moving them way too hard, not to mention impossible to do logistics. But if the weapon systems on them would be banned, for instance titans only able to do dread levels of damage and no superweapons and supers only being able to use 3 sets of fighters and no heavy ones would work. 
---
Then it would basically be tankier dreads and carriers in lowsec which would make them irrelevant.
---
Not sure why someone would even use a t3c to hunt anymore... they are literally garbage
---
they never said they were only looking at logins lol fuckin nullbabbys
---
I mean that's absolutely fine. As long as the thing can't eat up every timer while some dude in Moscow/Beijing/Houston multiboxes 30 toons and just warps out once he gets engaged. 
---
Also hi cutie
---
https://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility
---
Oh, that makes sense!
---
Great job to the VNI crew then, they deserve some more tank on the fit as a recognition for their efforts while their pilot wasn't giving a fuck about them.
---
Thanks fam

Gods bless Falcon.
---
No they don't. You could
---
- Gate ships through lowsec
---
- Transfer stuff to a safer ship (DSTs?) and gate them through lowsec
---
- Contract the stuff to local groups in the LS area to gate them
---
- Make stuff locally
---
- Own the NS-HS gate systems (oh, what's that, having systems with strategic value gives people something to fight over?)
---
JF logistics are way too easy and completely remove any kind of siege or highway banditry playstyles from the game, because valuable stuff is never gated through LS.
---
This is a great list. As you use, there should be a progression. And lowsec people should stop crying over the fact that they will be outgunned and outmanned in NS.
---
But groups having supers/titans should either have to choose between playing with their big toys and having to progress or not using them and staying put. Right now the bigger groups in LS can slaughter the smaller ones breaking what would be a natural progression.
---
That would make them overpowered when used offensively.
---
Idk how to i get a module that allows an infinite number of ships to teleport to my location incase i get tackled?
---
I've had some nice conversations in local thank you
---
I’d only recommend a stratios if you’re gonna do pvp as well as hacking. Astero is way faster, aligns quicker and is cheaper than stratios, the big thing is the strat is tankier and deals more damage, which you don’t need for explo. I think a decent stratios fit would be between 300-350 mil.
---
why
---
Jep:)
---
What exactly do you want to do for wormholes to be more dangerous? Just make drifters attack structures? We already lack asset safety and local. When done properly it's difficult to defend against evictions based on wormhole mechanics.
---
Null is a great starting point for CCP to test this stuff out, that's why it's only happening there.
---
Side note, i'd be totally fine with drifters attacking wormhole structures.
---
RZR GLORY !   
---
.KSerenity
---
So if Local was not blacked out, you would have seen the big mean fleets coming and docked up regardless instead of whelping your gate camp? Why are you gate camping without scouts?
---
As i said in the topic, i have no idea how to extract/export those numbers. That is right on my face and i cant see it?
---
Game balance &gt; lore
---
brags about super umbrella, still too afraid to link exact system
---
OMEGALUL
---
Dear CCP my very small alliance, and several other small alliances we work with have been getting many a kills and enjoying the excitement and spookiness of "did that Prospect leave local, is he still watching? Spooky!"
---
Blackout is baller
---
Thank You,
---
A very small alliance member

99% of hole rolling is done to find PVP since running the sites is not worth it. Like for example running best C2 sites is like \~100m hour  minus scanning and rolling ofc. so mby 30m/h. But since you rarely get even enough sites to run for an hour + scanning and rolling its better to just run highsec incursions.
---
Hi, I’m in a small null sec alliance. We have been fine. Tell your guys to stop being bitches.
---
Compared to similar MMOs? Yeah.
---
It would make it extremely hard to do offensive warfare, would create even more stagnation. They should always be able to move through lowsec but without their capacity to do dmg or something. I.e., dont mess with movement, just with the reason to keep them in LS.
---
Here's the problem - you're thinking about this in a logical manner.
---
Have you seen the forum threadnaught? Pretty sure half of those posters would claim its anti-pve to require them to JC into highsec
---
Its been pretty goddamn great. Not gonna lie.
---
This is a quick route to karma here, but actually, I disagree. Stabs are frustrating when you catch something and it warps off, sure, but they're balanced with a big negative already - the sensor strength and lock range penalty make them pretty non-viable on a combat ship. Maybe give them an agility penalty or something if they need nerfing more.
---
nice bait, you almost had me at the gatecamping part
---
Some of the best duders and dudets to fly.
---
You are literally asking CCP to punish people for playing the game.
---
Eh, I'd far rather go a completely different route if it was up to me.
---
* Split FW into a four way war with each empire considering the other three enemies.
---
* Split empire into four seperate highsec islands with a band of lowsec that separates them all.
---
* Collapse CONCORD and make the Genesis constellation a lowsec landmark.
---
* Have the faction navies take on CONCORD's role in their respective areas of space (with the power of current CONCORD).
---
* Have militia NPCs act as faction police and customs (with the power of current faction police and customs).
---
* Have each empire at odds with its traditional pirate enemy.
---
* Both PvP and PvE focused content for FW so that you can focus on either, or a combo if you want.
---
* I'd also heavily intertwine the NPE with factional identity in EVE to give people a feeling that their starter empire is "home", and get rid of the current NPC starter corps, everyone would go into one per faction so that there were more options for engagement.
---
I kinda love FW, but I think everyone agrees that it could use some love.
---
The only real impact of the Drifter invasion in null and the blackout was to solidify the Blue Donut.   Being part of said donut I think this is working out well.
---
There are lots of roamers getting kills from the dumber null bears and having tons of fun.   That's fine, but they're just dancing on the deck of the Titanic.   Enjoy the music.
---
Let the downvotes commence!
---
Are you retarded?
---
The problem here is that drones shouldn't auto-engage stuff outside your lock range (which, with 3 WCS, is like 10km or something).
---
Yeah, cause this is temporary.
---
People moving to lowsec is bad because?
---
This is class, awesome to see some informed opinion on the game mechanics from someone at CCP.  VETO were indeed a scary group to run into.
---
Worst part is I dont know when the moon mining fleet is now
---
So whats the carrot for NS and the current no local?:)
---
The awesome thing about doing this in High sec, is that every time I'm in Jita, I can select all local and block them. Cut the amount of spam by 90%
---
It's sad to see PL try to be relevant 😔
---
I want to resub soon. Can you tell me what's the best way. 1-3 month sub probably
---
Why did Matthew Dust, aka shameless mission-loving LP predator, fail to see that protecting the free speech of other LP predators is oppressive in its very nature to the pro-PVP community?  Did he just hate the vast superiority of my proposals for faction warfare?
---
YISSSSS DO IT! BURNINATE ALL THE THINGS!
---
Don't want to spoil this to you but based on stuff that CCP Falcon posted in other topic, it looks like perma change.
---
You mean the Unspoke alliance that is working with goons....alliance might be small but your friends aint.
---
WTF? This is a way to implement EXP to Eve...  
---
Kill NPC to get more skillpoints... So unique way to train your char is dying
---
Oh, I don't know, people don't seem to mind their PI planet resources waxing and waning over time.  This would just be a version of that scaled up to the galaxy.
---
 27 man gate camp 
---
"small alliance"
---
You don´t belong in null m8
---
Sounds really cool, but that's how you end up with cloaked bots on every gate.
---
Your active pilots are pussies. Find a better corp
---
Tipping the balance more toward blowing shit up than making risk free ISK under your super umbrella all day.
---
I could not have chosen a better man to sign my shit
---
What small alliance are you in?
---
Blackout will clear at least one group of players. Gankers got all intel from in game mechanics, raters have nothing they are just free kills now.
---
Who cares if they push players to never log back or to join huge alliannces where u are just a pawn. Its good as long as there will be someone ratting, we will see after  few moths how many people left. 
---
Right now building little empires is limited to wormhole.
---
Oh you guys have room for my krab alt?
---
How do I prevent a module from allowing an infinite number of ships to escalate to my location incase I get tackled?
---
5. Sub at least 4 accounts to act as scouts on gates for a single carrier or barge to rat in relative safety (of course CCP would love this, but it wont happen) 
---
If your happy to pay subs on accounts just to sit on gates then youve got too much money my friend
---
Industry/PVE players who live in null and resent all PVP and risk aspect of the game. That's perhaps the most canonical definition.
---
You live in low sec.....
---
&gt; This, or just make it so that ships that equip them can’t fire weapons or use drones
---
You already get a big combat penalty with the sensor strength and lock range penalty. This should also affect drones though. And of course you're sacrificing a low slot to fit one so that's tank or DPS that takes a hit.
---
Just multiply by two anoms respawn and moon extractions time.
---
Slowclap.gif
---
Do it in lowsec too!
---
The new metric for Eve wars is baked potatoes. I baked 3 potatoes waiting for fights that never came.
---
GOtcha aye, well maybe, im generally not happy about isk faucets but maybe yeah.  WE'll see how it flushes out now I spose.
---
Idk how do i stop a ship with 5m ehp and 3000 dps that applies perfectly to cruisers and above from teleporting in?
---
They've done this before. It's no different than getting free SP, but this time you gotta hit that undock button.
---
by that logic, the idea that asteroid belts can be mined out is also CCP punishing miners for playing the game
---
Out of your entire fleet, not one person has an alt that can sit on the other side of the fucking gate?
---
My small alliance and our small alliance friends have been loving the hell out of it.
---
Just admit you’re shit and have overly relied on local to dock up and never actually learned how to play the game.
---
No we don’t. We live in sov null sec
---
Loooool, not to be overly dramatic but every genocide that started had someone like you on the other side saying the exact same things. "Oohh dont worry, its not hate, they are just making fun."
---
Its very basic psychology dude. Its human nature, Eve doesnt trump reality.
---
So much spinning I’m dizzy.
---
p.s. it’s hard to be affected by the drifters when you don’t have any structures for them to attack
---
You have control about losing it, ratters and miners escape all the time. It is called scouts...intel...playing the freaking game mang. Yes it is always risk reward in nulls sec, but everyone seems to get bent out of shape when CCP keeps trying to actually implement the Risk aspect of that system.
---
I don't think I, or anyone else, has said "no bots". We keep tighter controls on botting. Everything else about that is opsec.
---
Could be a DC during a power outage or something while already tackled, who knows. Our diplos have a very massive hate boner for bots, so I would expect him to get rubber gloved in ways nobody wants to be.
---
Stop being such a bitch and use a scout next time.
---
Now NYC is having Blackouts...damn copycats
---
they just want to camp the nourv gate in peace
---
this is good for small alliances though.
---
I do it every week. If you aren't dumb its easy.
---
Durring the local debacle a while back, our home system's local got replaced by a weird mix of Amarr and an incursion system.
---
We fought you enough times Lord. Till you got outnumbered and ran away to the spire
---
Applies perfectly? Are we in 2016? Wew you discovered time travel! Also, I agree with you. Cynos in wormholes next patch.
---
I"m curious are you blacked out of your alliance/corp in local? That would be an interesting twist if you could see people with standings only, adds some spy game potential to it I think. Might be good to leave well enough alone tho.
---
I don't understand something, when I did the last mission in "balancing the books", it tasked me to produce 10 infrared S ammo. 
---
So I calculated that it would take 3 mexallion per Ammo, which is 3 times 10 = 30
---
Yet the game showed that I only needed 29 mexallion, and not 30.
---
That doesn't make sense at all! 
---
Why is that?
---
So, you and your people knew changes were coming. You and your people did 0 things different when the changes came. It is now CCPs fault that you and your people didnt prepare properly? Our Corp had gate camps of 10-15 out all weekend with scouts on gates. We got so many fights and kills and then we retreated from a huge goon frig fleet. When they saw they outnumbered us so badly and we were docked they left and we continued. Like wormhole people and small corps came for gudfights and we got lots. Our krabs got to krab because we were close by and could save them if they got tackled. We had 2 carriers tackled in the same system because a guy was multi boxing for the first time and shit the bed, but we formed up like 15 people and saved him. Volta came through and we fought them. Lazerchickens dropped 20 legions on a rorq and we saved him too. It sounds like your alliance is treating nullsec like highsec.
---
Read that out loud , but slowly this time
---
Idk how do i get a ship with 10m ehp and an aoe delete button in my wormhole?
---
Is there an "idealized plan" for what to train up if you land this, to maximize extractable SP? Or is it just "find any skill(s) with your maxed attributes, train that"?
---
You still get rewarded for running the sites. All this is, is a change to resource distribution. Mining and wormholes already work this way.
---
Wrong we kill plenty of supers within frt goons nc and pn space while covered in there umbrella 100 men bombers do a super in quickly and in test we loose plenty of rorq s and supers to these fleets but you expect to kill a super or a rorq in your small gang and think you should have 1 hr to chip at a super or rorq tank and not get countered.
---
You're just helping the bots...
---
There were alts sat on 2 gates ahead and behind. Not much you can do when people sit in system for a bit before you man the gates then feed you until the rest of their fleet can pounce on you
---
&gt;you gotta hit that undock button
---
Unless Triglavians suddenly start spawning en masse in low/nullsec people are still gonna stay docked.
---
Oh my good you actually grew a pair and took sov?
---
&gt; Cynos still work. They're still incredibly safe if you light them in tether of a friendly structure
---
is he wrong? yes, but oh boy so are you. Actually no, you're right, please do light that cyno on tether ))))
---
Nice to see you here. Yeah this is some next level multi boxing. I saw that avatar group as well and thought I was jumping into a gate camp. Then you come along lol. If only I could have tracked you better I might have had a chance. Good kill though.
---
Make DSTs the covert jump drive ship. Don't give them CovOps cloaks, but the bonus to other cloaks like BLOPs have.
---
Or add a 3rd Transport class that's like a DST except it needs Cloaking IV and jump drive skills. Because can't take away a toy that somebody already uses. (Though, does anybody actually *use* DSTs? Except people hauling small batches of freshly-built cruisers to Jita?)
---
A blockade runner that can haul 60K m^3 of stuff sounds OP to me.
---
Dont you see!!! You need us dumbfucks in Nullsec to kill.....the way its going us dumbfucks wont play anymore.....no more kills
---
How about you grow a pair and let me know what alliance you are so we can come put the nail in your coffin too.
---
Uuuuh! Even better!
---
Honestly yeah I would. Hunting bots is never fun, no interaction just a dead ship and no good encounter/chase/fight. Coming across 1 damn good fight always beats blowing up 5 bots. The later is just KB padding the first is why I enjoy EVE pvp so much.
---
It's not permanent? Shit
---
mad cuz bad

---
See the Eve player base, yeah those guys, fuck em all! -CCP_falconi
---
That's not a scam, but it's a worthwhile clarification.
---
How about making it viable for us to actually fight wars easier and letting us blow shit up that way? And if it was risk free shit wouldnt die on a daily basis. And the recent nerfs to supers have made the super umbrella alot weaker than it was right?
---
Except for perhaps in Delve but we cant base everything on what goons can and cannot do.
---
I read this and think "coming soon to a low sex near you"
---
&gt; 
---
in the chokepoints hunters have toons logged in from dowtine to downtime almost, if you couldn't move your supers without them being in local you will never get thru those chokes regardless. You can do it in dt too with pretty much zero risk
---
find a long skill train (like BS V) and buy implants / map your skills to the two attributes that matter.  
---
Or yea if you dont' want to remap, just find a skill with your maxed attributes.  there may be a few skills you can't extract?  but i've never run into that problem.
---
Everytime you jump a wormhole add a small chance your ship SDs.
---
Which means it'll never happen. ;)
---
XD
---
Dual boxing astero is probably more effective  than a bomber against vni
---
Nice hunting anyway
---
since ur diplos have a hate boner for bots, go to fake eso on a neutral toon and look around
---
You look familiar...
---
After being tight wads for over a year, CCP really opens the flood gates.
---
Really not a fan of these login events, they're metric chasing ('look at our high unique login numbers') without actually achieving anything, since you don't even need to log in a character, never mind actually undock.
---
Also not a fan of daily shoot-a-rat missions.
---
This all feels very Pearl Abyss, even if CCP has dabbled in this area before.
---
Attacking structures and ships like they do in null right now. J space is both dangerous and safe because you normally can't have massive fleet battles or cap escalations but you lack sov amenities.
---
They'll just tz tank
---
Blackout brought me back to the game, fixes soooo many long running issues. I hope it is permanent.
---
I agree with you and that was the point I was trying to make (albeit in ironic manner.)
---
This doesnt stop you from making your own killboard and feeding imperium related killmails through it. If you have line members giving their ESI tokens to Squizz, thats not his fault, is it?
---
Makes sense. They want to prevent the “summer slump”
---
that's a valid point.
---
What actually making me to login and play the game and even giving me rewards for doing so. What is this?  
---
Bittervets be bittervet.
---
Lol, I know you dont live in NS since you are being this ignorant. How many 10 rorq multiboxers do you think there are? Every critique towards NS is the same, based on a rarity.
---
Goons made a single jump through lowsec on deployment to KQK... from Delve all the way to the back end of Tribute. I think you're dramatically overestimating the impact on navigation
---
real man feed 2b lokis while killing vnis
---
Thanks for putting in the time to write this.  There are many of us that share your perspective.  I hope CCP listens.  +1
---
Honestly, people are stupid.
---
Maybe not lowsec, but null sec, I don't see why not. You wanna live outside the bubble go right ahead, with all that comes with it, much like WH space.
---
If you think TZ tanking can stop our autism you’re mistaken. Also I saw y’alls drake navy fleet the other day in branch or something. Respect it
---
&gt;Electronic warfare is only single target.
---
And a stab isn't? If you're tackled by 4 ships, neither is going to get you out. Except maybe an insanely lucky ECM burst?
---
Anything to get people to quit mining and start buying their isk, amIright?
---
Absolutely.  
---
While NS could sure use some room for improvement and freshening of the meta, the bigger problem is that because LS is so broken people that enjoy that style of play have no place to go.  They can go to HS and farm tears playing around with HS war dec (awful game play against the most vulnerable players) or come up to NS and get dunked by 250 man fleets and super capitals.  That in and of itself does not mean that NS or capitals are broken, but that small groups are being forced to fight against them.  
---
Making room in the progression from HS to NS for more granular play is the key, not changing trying to change NS be more like LS or making LS into a crappy version of NS.  
---
Once they fix HS war dec mechanics, I really hope they focus on LS and bring back a place for nice small group sub capital PvP.
---
Again BB and inner hell and all major alliances have plenty of super and rorq kills within supers umbrellas but some of you want to kill supers in 5 men small gangs and have a 1 hr to chip at there tank without a save response, and cry weeeeeeeee supers are to hard to kill weeeee rorq s are to hard to kill weeee , get gud and organize the right  bombers fleet allong with a good fc and you will get the supers and rorq kills.
---
If you want to stick to small gang fleet that’s fine but be content with domi, and vni.
---
It's already not fixed, it's ±10% or thereabouts.
---
Anchoring damaviks hav hard scrams. Just copy pasta to the pointing rats in sleeper sites
---
Ya why not have drifters warp around and attack things, it is their home space? CCP seemed content to force nullsec into a defensive posture with drifters, why not expand this risk to what is supposed to be the riskiest space.
---
The idea of these events is to shake up the game and get people away from what they have been mindlessly doing for years. These are mechanics that I'm suggesting that run along these premises. Is null getting too safe? Yes. But high sec is just utterly sleepy with no events or fights and is just being overrun with citadel spam so it needs just as much of a shake as null does.
---
This!! Have an upvote.
---
Couldn't tell you, I read the title and blacked out
---
How do you define the safest space? I am almost certain more ships die in nullsec than every other area, yet some how people constantly claim its safe.
---
I really like the Legion for it, though I'm not using traditional super tanked fits anymore, they're way too slow and the tank is unnecessary. Can share the fit if you're interested
---
You can't compare Eve to other MMO's that easily. The hardcore elements keep Eve economy going. Minerals worth mining. Ships worth building. Game worth playing.
---
And how about the nullsec combat sites that are by far the biggest ISK fountain?
---
Yet again, goons goons goons. Not everything is about goons, they own how many regions now? Ofc they prefer to use the safer route to them but this isnt the case with every other group man.
---
Maybe a workaround would be to disallow regular cynos in faction warfare space specifically, rather than the entirety of lowsec as a whole?
---
I definitely agree with the covert cynos and JFs! Would make logistics a whole lot easier in "unsafe" regions, but I don't agree with going a bit absurd and letting them cloak.
---
Anyways I'm really enjoying the blackout so far! Keep up the shakeups, they're fun!
---
&gt; If it were up to me I'd ban supers from lowsec.
---
supers aren't a problem in lowsec specifically, they're a problem in every area of the game, and that is due to the balancing of said supers being off, and a lot of engagements being forced onto structure grids. The reason its so much worse in ls is that there is not even a chance at contesting the current super snuff superiority, not without pretty much giving up the ls lifestyle of most alliances.
---
its not a lowsec mechanics problem, its a super/structure balance problem
---
Interesting you throw risk in there with pvp. I have yet to come across IN GAME many who were not risk adverse. PVPer, mission runner, or miner. Must be a high/low sec thing?
---
Food for thought, thank you.
---
Thanks for your answer :) 
---
When you say "almost nothing" can you put a number to that? According to u/vaminos 's answer, top tier play would be worth over 1 billion ISK, but what would bottom tier play be worth would you say? I am trying to get a sense of the disparity of the game economy.
---
I'm sure all the skill farmers will do a great job goosing the DAU count with their six month skill queues or whatever.
---
I am part of a small alliance and we really enjoying the Blackout. You don't represent all of us at all. 
---
Just adapt or " die " .
---
I think im missing something... no one here has been hating on super ratting? No ones asking for easier killmails.... Im simply excited us hunters have much better chances of catching krabbers now that they cant dock up the second 1 neutral enters local.

Zkill blackout made space much more dangerous. Without zkill you didnt know if that person normally fits a cyno and is bait or if they are running a combat fit, or if they usually run with friends. You have to treat every fight as a new experience without using zkill to give you free information.
---
Fit some faction scram then... Jeez.
---
They are loosing their low slots for WCS. They loose or armor tank, or drone dps, or some extra speed from nanos for the WCS. Then you must secrifice something too. Run a pimp scram or 2 scrams. But, man up.
---
I use Faction Scram to catch gas venture and relic site explorers.
---
People should try to play the game besides crying on Reddit
---
Ye very true.
---
Definitely for VNI’s, having 1k dps for bigger stuff is pretty nice tho!
---
We didnt have 100 test bombers, we had 40 kikis, some harpies, ishtars and guardians. There was 11 faxes, I counted them and i gave a dscan info link into bombers bars, i dont know why do you feel that way you do. Perhaps dont drop as many faxes next time? XD
---
&gt;fight the Triglavians by gaining as many Skill Points as you can
---
That sound you just heard is the crashing price of skill injectors.
---
Oh I disagree. That's annoying as hell but at least I don't have to undock, or move everything to a new planet / system every time.
---
Definitely me in a past life
---
That's quite a brutal hit at nullsec logistics tho. Most of the stuff moved out of null is cyno'ed in 1 jump from high.
---
That single change would make big parts of null borderline uninhabitable for all but few biggest coalitions.
---
This is a game..
---
Git gud scrubs lol
---
A bot would have hit the shield rep. 
---
When i was in tapi we had this one guy in corp that lost 6 rorqs by falling asleep at the key board. 
---
This is nothing new
---
There was around 119 people in local, thats both fleets, you had plenty of pilots and so did we, but not as many as you are putting it. wouldve been great if Bomber's bar hadnt chickened out.
---
I hope that CCP knows they've made a decision they can't reverse. If they do revert back to a normal local, it's going to enrage every single person who came back specifically for the black out, and enrage the players that have been around for the past year or two playing through the demoralizing player vs bot gameplay. If that does happen, those players will never again trust CCP, they'll unsubscribe, and never look back, no matter what bone CCP throws them. Bringing back local to the way it was may very well be the final nail in the coffin for eve.
---
u/CCP_Falcon please read this.
---
There's never enough salty tears.
---
Git Gud.
---
What is this miserable fit?
---
Same way people used to do it, set up a structure chain
---
How about WSpace? should be really fun with your numbers :)
---
terrible ... I know
---
Yea I remember seeing nsh guy in bkg/z-k area. Nobody wants to fight Drake's too spooky for крабит
---
At least somebody isnt as closed minded as the rest of you lot.

The problem is too many people have their heads up their asses to look at the bigger picture.
---
Say 10,000 people stop playing eve because of this. Thats 10,000 less people building ships and modules and stocking markets. PRICES WILL RISE
---
Its 10,000 less people for you 'elite' pvpers to kill. YOU ALL WILL START GETTING BORED
---
Its 10,000 less subs for CCP to make isk out of. LESS MONEY TO SPEND IMPROVING AND MAINTAINING THE GAME.
---
Nobody sees that point only trolling on the fact that some people are not 15 year old vets like them and yes we are still learning the game. You were probably just as shit as us at one point. Or you joined a big alliance and hid behind 200 man fleets.
---
To all of you who don't see this point come speak to me in a few months time when your game is boring, ship prices are through the roof and the game is dead.
---
You can easily distinguish between friends or foes by just looking at local; anyone not on your team is an enemy. That doesn't happen in any other place.
---
The big alliances intel tools (like Near2) are so robust that you don't even need to be near your computer to know some enemy is coming. 
---
And in case you disregard those two things, and somehow still manage to get caught, you have from standing fleets to massive capital umbrellas that can be used almost completely safe (because of intel and local) to save your ass.
---
So unless you lose a war and get evicted, there is no safest place to be. And even then you have assets safety.
---
Most ships die there because fleet fights involve from hundreada to thousands of players, so even border skirmishes ammount for a lot of killed ships.
---
No ballz. Bet you won't!
---
Spent the whole weekend in small gang fights against random lowsec and wormhole groups, a few goon fleets, and even frat undocked once
---
I just want to say thanks. You've taken my love of the memories of this game and made me feel like I love this game again.
---
I too can claimed that I have undock and fight peoples in space. It is written on the internet ; it is always the Truth.
---
'My small alliance and other small alliances were working with' Not so small then are you lol
---
Good move. As a new/returning player it feels like a good time to be around!
---
The guy comparing apples and oranges without even having seen an orange is saying this?
---
Nullsec is dangerous place for newer player. Train some pvp skills for a moment and then go back there when you are more ready!
---
This is a terrible idea.  Clearing gas sites isn't a great way to make isk in WH space, but it is good if you want almost fully afk farming.  This ain't it.
---
Real way -- Barghest, FoF missiles, fit to hit 405km+ (drugs help if skills are lacking).  Make pings so you're 401km+ away when you warp to it.  Warp to site at ~60km, align to nearby celestial, let rats aggress you (you'll lose ~90% of your shield), warp out.  If your skills suck (missiles only out to ~410km), let rats move back to initial spawn.  Warp to 400km+ bookmark, turn on FoF launchers, afk.  Rats won't come for you because you're past their aggro range and will ignore you even as you kill them.  Keep an on your d-scan and MJD the moment you see combats, you are now utterly safe.  May have been fixed but I doubt it, haven't done for a long time.
---
Do it in C5/C6 space if you actually want any reasonable amount of money.  It takes fucking forever though.
---
Can you send me the fit? I’ve finally gotten around to training for the legion and was looking for fits.
---
Let's think this through.
---
The Large Nullsec Coalitions, which have huge nullbear populations, deplete their local systems.   Where to they go next?     Not to take space away from other big alliances -- they're depleted, too.
---
No, they roflstomp the little alliances and take their space.
---
Folks, the problem isn't that the null alliances are too dense.   The problem is that there's compelling reason for the nullsec alliances to fight each other.   THAT'S what you want to happen in nullsec; it keeps the blobs away from home and it keeps attention off the little guys.
---
So. He lose some low slots for WCS, but you don't want to lose a mid one?
---
Run Faction Scram then. 
---
He is giving up tank, speed or drone DPS for the stabs. Plus the drawback from it. But you don't wanna have to give anything in exchange?
---
And, you only want to hunt ships that can't shoot back. Because actually have to fight something to kill it isnt your thing huh?
---
PS: stop calling people retard. Shut up. Man up.
---
So how and when did your drones kill the Proteus exactly?
---
I was pretty lucky for them to get under your guns. One of em was definitely on the ropes but at 500-1000m good luck hitting anything small with BC guns. You were definitely going down (2600 dps with those skills), it was more a matter of whether you'd take a ship or two with you.
---
Its less. A lot less. Since local turned off on Friday, at all hours of the day between 2000-4000 less players have been logged in.
---
&gt; or JF will be useless.
---
good, you force people to actually move their stuff thru space and with that one simple change you just made pirating a viable thing again. JFs should have never existed tbh
---
I've done gating moveops with caps, with all those slots you end up going faster than mainline battleships
---
Ok now make this post relevant since we just lost local.
---
Pls make it so!
---
good luck with overextending, good luck having multiple umbrellas, even goons would have issue with more than 2 umbrellas
---
Ye, every change will cause reactions and if the change itself doesnt bring in more players than the game loses it becomes a net loss. Hopefully they will realise this fast cause its a shame, Eve is a great game.
---
It is all preference. When you join Eve Online because of the promise of 'playing how you want', then come across others who want to force you into their style, the game will suffer.
---
This PVP OR GTFO mindset is childish and eventually all of the 'elite pvpers' will have no more indy pvers to gank. They will be left with the option of going after each other.. which won't happen because 'elite pvpers' rarely go after armed combat ships...
---
&gt;(I dropped almost $10k so far in Star Citizen to reclaim the walk-around ability, worth every penny).
---
What do you mean by "reclaim the walk around ability"? Want that one of the major selling point of sc? That you could do from flying to free walking seamlessly? So what do you mean by reclaim?
---
This is a forum. To participate in a forum you typically have to read things. You're pretty dense, no wonder you want an automated feature to D-scan for you.
---
Dunno about that either like I said earlier I never needed a CCP blackout excuse to get my hunting in and pvp kills matter fact there is less prey and just more hunters now , 
---
I solo hunt in astero, stratios, Loki, and Tengu all cloacky,solo roam in my space in a wolf ,harpy , broadsword, munnin and eagle
---
The Code Always Wins!
---
it's just that it's easier against dinobrain.
---
I've been wondering lately if a player's online status couldn't be an addition to locator agents. It would be a buff to a feature that has seen several unintentional nerfs over the years and isn't spammable due to built in cool downs.
---
But yes, fleet invites seem to be the last viable way to test online status since the chat rework patched a bug a handful of us knew about last year.
---
From July 1... Timely info there Nina.
---
Polo! Shit!
---
This was Like 15 days ago though nina....
---
Sounds like someone wants their game made easier.
---
Hmm from a quick glance that fit looks cap stable.
---
How many small aliiances need to die before you got nothing left to kill though?
---
Are Unspoken really gonna go up against Panfam again because theres nobody smaller to pick on?
---
Last time that happened 500 Panfam to your 18 Cerbs.......YOU DOCKED AND DIDNT BOTHER
---
adapt or die.
---
Remove the safety from running bearholes so people have to defend and contest to retain their income.
---
&lt;3 black out
---
The Salt.....
---
yeah and he was a TRI fc originally
---
He died on stargate?
---
Who would actually gate with a Vendetta, especially during these turbulent localless times?
---
Also, dat fit. Ratter, propably. They never learn.
---
he needs to be on the list
---
Holy shit, please!
---
7. Make friends
---
8. HTFU
---
If they can't handle it let em go and recruit those who want to enjoy the new emergent gameplay.
---
Resub, thats the only way CCP can see they did good with the change, reddit posts and upvotes are free and in a couple minutes u can have many. But the fact of resubbing will make them happy and continue this road, please do it, its very important. Spread the word to other bittervets too. Thanks!
---
fuck jfs, if you ban jfs from lowsec and force people to actually, *gasp* , move their shit in space and not teleport it, you just made pirating a viable role in the game (again?) and just made ls that much more valuable
---
It could be argued the the only "Real" pvp players were RvB and everyone else is just managing risk and won't jump into a fight they can't automatic win.  Maybe we should invent a new term for PvP players who won't take engagement that are not overwhelming in there favor.
---
PS:. And Brave Newbies back when they were welping fleets of talwars on anything they could find.
---
It seems to me that it would be a bigger deal to stop the  processing and then catch up than to have left it processing the whole time  --- The part about legacy code is I assume that "Blackout mode" isn't a pre-built feature in zKill and so the old code has to learn a new trick.  Its prob the case that its easier to just make all requests return the blackout page rather than figure out which codepaths can run during the blackout and which ones can't.  Might have even just done it at the router/load-balancer rather than deal with the code at all.  
---
and fetching and parsing thousands of anything with a modern computer ought not be a big deal.
---
As an Icelander, you should be deported for not liking liquorice! As an EVE player black it out bae!
---
I don't think you read what he said bud
---
That was Hateless Gaming. He's a really good guy and made some of the better guides on how to do burners. 
---
Tbf he was never in any danger of dying, he could perma tank the mission.
---
Limit size of corporations and alliances, pretty soon you will see drama unfold.
---
Consider never posting again
---
Thats - as with ECM - the only sensible way to do it. Apply to CCP immediatly!
---
Some point before I tabbed back over and saw the sins.
---
I know, I was there.
---
We needed the supertits to glass a region.   I'm not sure we'll try to do that again (god I hope not ....) so I'm expecting a larger proportion of the umbrella to stay home next time.
---
Disclaimer:  I'm just an F1 monkey so what do I know?
---
I don’t want the cloak hauler to be doing that. I’m talking about the one with native warp core stabs.
---
Your argument is asinine. Different areas kf eve are different areas of eve. It makes perfect sense that different areas have different residents wanting different things, needing different mechanics, etc.
---
Eve didn't need nullsec being as safe as it was while being as rewarding ad it was.
---
I mean it's provi, the carebeariest of carebears.
---
Unless you're flairbaiting.
---
Asset Safety is a good ISK sink.
---
CCP decided that we needed regionalized moongoo.  So, can't.  Unless you're expecting the alliance to only fly T1 ships.
---
Not sure how black out made him gate a faction super, don’t get me wrong a good cockride is the shit but how’s not the time
---
Well, atleast it wont be as many or with supers as people keep complaining about.
---
/u/CCP_Falcon When can we expect a CCP conclusion about the blackout?
---
you need to work on your shit-posting. 
---
This post is bad and you should feel bad.
---
And we still have fucked their shits for months anyways. 
---
Stop crying man.
---
Raise a spine and adapt. Otherwise your alliance will be erase from the map very soon like all the other who have cry before when facing adversity.
---
Stop acting like a piteful victim.
---
Miss you Nyjil, come pew squids with us.
---
Imagine tho, delayed local in lowsec too, but going suspect or criminal immediately adds you to local list until it expires. 
---
Lorewise, Concord is like Santa and knows when you've been naughty, even if they don't apprehend you in lowsec. They can, however, give fair warning to other capsuleers....
---
In game wise, let's you know there's nerds out there actively agressing stuff, so there's content to be hunt or avoid...
---
Yes. You get it. It's only that the game and idea is so great that they survived this long. They are TERRIBLE business people. They are gamers with a business, not business people with a game.
---
i dont think they should be removed but it should be really hard to fit a combat ship with warp stabs. i think it would be pretty hard on new indy guys who dont have an orca/freighter if they were to lose stabs on indy cruisers
---
disclaimer: im speaking in my own self interest as someone getting into indy.
---
This is just stupid even if local was up.  And this was a system with a safe cyno in it.
---
Could also tie it into sec status, or if they ever think about revamping it *gasp*, the bounty system?
---
Oh come on, there is plenty to say about the idea, but this is just not true. Unless you think "I have to take a few gate jumps instead of ratting almost on grid with my citadels" as "punishing".
---
We fight Panfam, Frat all the time check the killboard. Drop those Nyx on us, please. It is funny how large alliances who only care about rocks and rats don't get we just want to farm them and now we can hide our fleets because spod brains can't dscan.
---
Are you that retarded? I explained why I think NS was safer than other parts of the galaxy, and why it needed a drastic change implemented before other areas that, in my opinion, are dangerous enough and could use the Dev time dedicated to them to rework old mechanics and things like that.
---
Is that more clear? Do you need me to draw a picture for you?
---
Nope. I regressed from WHBTW to TAPI to INIT to -7-, mostly due to lack of time to login and play. But still recognize good changes when they occur.
---
My bad for omitting a 100 man stealth bomber fleet. Didn't realize I was talking to a null bloc blue doughnut blobber.
---
I totally want to and think my 5 man micro gang of Orthrus and Retributions should kill a super /s
---
You've never been insta-locked before, have you? ;)
---
This sounds like a great idea. It'll need to be made in a way that prevents bots from easily automating it. Something like a several minute long cool down, or some sort of mini game like the tuning mechanic you mentioned.
---
Looks to me like a drive by hel. Like the guy with the nyx in losec
---
?????????????????????????????????????????
---
he was gate camping with it.  
---
black out gives you infinitely more set up time
---
Yes and all dreads got killed also :)
---
[insert joke about you not undocking anyway here]
---
Nom nom... :3
---
He was gate camping in a ratting fit Vendetta?
---
:(
---
You are not allowed to complain that EVE subs are down at monday just to turn around complaining about events that try counter that effect on tuesday. 
---
What the fuck is wrong with your brain? If u cant adapt go play Hello Kitty online
---
Nice catch!
---
Dude... You rly need to play the game. Are you trying to tell me how we do things. Because, it's how we do it. As i wrote, its how we do it in LS. Not a few mins. But we usually eat the moons in one all in OP of several hours.
---
In WH is Even safer, you wh prove/control then roll them to full carehole. (For ratting too)
---
What i see is that you maybe are too used to external Intel apps, 20 jumps Intel. Multiboxin as meanwhile in Netflix, Fornite, or whatever.
---
You had Intel. But the Intel is a Scout, a actual human being active, on coms and alert. Not 40 pods along the space posting names on a channel for an external app tell you to pause your movie.
---
yup. with a few subs and other supers. Im not sure if its ratting fit or just TNT fit. VoV
---
he does solo drop with his super
---
Well it is not the only way, I was playing with a capsule for some time, after this image, I popped out Combat Scanners, and it immediately went to warp to forti to tether. Then I pulled them and it took him about a minute or so to get back to site. And I have found 2x VNis travelling in a group to a system, so whenever I decloaked next to them, they would shit out drones and move to next system, then again and again. Welll my cargo hold is only so big, so I scooped the Berserkers.
---
a nullbear is just a wormholer that hasnt moved to jspace to crab in true safety yet
---
I highly doubt it makes much difference to them at all. They just change activities or move them to other places. Look at it like this, imagine you are the bot handler. Your work is to run bots in Eve and thats your irl living. You wont stop going to work because of some event creating traffic on your route to work right? You just find an alternate route.
---
The reason that Im pointing it out is because a lot of people are saying that the player count drop is due to bots, I dont really believe it since I saw bots starting to adapt since the drifters became a thing. They had time to start all their new alpha accounts and do other activities. I highly doubt that we have many less bots today than we did last thursday which means that the player count drop is real players/alts.
---
But it definitely hurts them the no-local. So they dont warp immediately to Forti, you actually have time and you do not need fast ceptor in front of you that have crazy leet skills with dscan. :))
---
All work as predicted. CCP don't trust player who predict that. 
---
Let the retention number and small entitity burn.  When Eve will near to die, see if hilmar kik all dev who make the change, and dismiss.
---
Even if he don't, I'm pretty sure a spai dictor will point him
---
Just like the first one
---
I’m in a small lowsec/nullsec alliance and all has gone well. We mainly do roams in nullsec, none of which have gotten shredded by dozens of men fleets. I personally have roamed a lot and despite what people say I actually see LESS large fleets roaming and gatecampers camping around nullsec.
---
Malcanis law, man. Everything you do benefits the big fish, as they will always be in a better position. 
---
This change is aimed at somewhat countering the super umbrellas in a way that creates more opportunities for PVP, not a "nerf goons" proposal.
---
Top tier gameplay makes hundreds of millions or billions of isk per hour depending on what someone does. Some people grind wormhole/DES sites or carrier rat, which can give hundreds of millions per hour. Rorqual mining can make about that much as well. Some high-level players have niche activities, like the guy who started the previous Perimeter trading hub, and they make way more than other players, at many billions per day from fees due to market transactions. It’s pretty difficult to say what a lot of top-tier players make in terms of isk because most of them find their own special, creative, super-profitable way to make isk. That’s not easily done and that’s why they’re top-tier.
---
With players that’ve just started playing the game it’s difficult to make isk because you don’t have isk built up, you don’t have a lot of expensive money-making equipment (like a 2 bil blinged DED-running rattlesnake) that a lot of experienced players use on a daily basis, and you don’t have the skills to fly a lot of ships. That limits you to activities that don’t have up-front cost, such as running low-level combat missions or mining in a venture, both of which probably make a few million isk per hour. 
---
There are a few ways to make a lot of isk as a new player, such as nullsec exploration in an Astero (50-100 mil per hour) or gas harvesting, but they all involve some form of risk. They’re profitable because most other new players won’t do them.
---
Should also put BLack legion, The culture, Escalating Entropy, CO2, FCON, SMA (the first time not when NSH raped them two weeks ago) just to name a few.
---
I really enjoy these :) OP, are you the creator?
---
Please provide an AAR
---
Quite rare for someone to enter your site/plex and instalock you lol
---
Kindly re-read my post. I have two alts specialised in logi and dps.
---
Pathetic Legion.
---
Oh no trading dreads for a faction super :((
---
I mean, Leviathan is the worst HAW Titan, but it already has a torpedo range bonus
---
&gt; It's hurt by there being basically no transition from hisec to lowsec to null other than bubbles.
---
that's why i think highsec should get covert cynos.
---
A mix of b-types and faction mods on a Vendetta is TNT fit.
---
Lol ye, and they fail at gaming as well:)
---
Your account name didn't age well :D
---
I just don't follow how you people seem to think it was so safe, even ignoring the fleet fights you could still find people getting ganked daily. What ships were being lost in wspace or lowsec that made those areas more dangerous? Just because massive groups of players work together to protect each other, you think they should be nerfed and solo hunting should be buffed? Why shouldnt these groups be able to more easily protect the space they lived in and developed. What is the point of owning or improving space if we have to be vulnerable to solos?
---
Definitely be careful with any sort of wake jump drive. Otherwise you will see cloaked titans jumping enemy fleets into a bubbled keepstar that turns on pds. On the other hand, having a titan and black ops also jump at the end of a bridge would shake things up even more.
---
1. In a game as large as eve the options are not as binary as "Be in Test/Goons/PanFam or die"
---
2. People moving to lowsec is a good thing. It's an area of space that desperately needs attention and people living in it.
---
3. Try learning from the mistakes made that led to you dying. Adjust your habits. Doing the same thing over and over and somehow expecting a different result is the definition of insanity. Also, I refuse to believe people who spend time krabbing can't afford to lose a few ships. I never PvE. Ever. Yet I still manage to fund my PvP. My wallet sits around the 5b-ish mark. I'm sure a lot of your members crying about lack of funds have a lot more than 5b.
---
4. I agree staying docked shouldn't be an option. Try a different strategy.
---
5. I dislike the requirement for alts. However, you mention having a fleet of nearly 30 people. That's 10x the size of the "fleets" I'm usually flying in, yet I still manage to do okay and have fun. Try using some of those people in a more active capacity.
---
6. Can I have your stuff?
---
It is bad but I'm not quite sure you understand why it's bad mister goonswarm man
---
Poor fit super
---
You get the point. 10 or 1 is the same here. Thing is if you gather intel with real scouts (active player on keybord) is one thing. But people is crying about losing their Intel of 4000 pods that post names on a channel to an external app warns AFK people.
---
It not ruins anybody game because, they are not realy playing it. Being on LoL, Fornite or Netflix as you mine/rat is the only thing Lost here, along the bots.
---
I'm a dancer that animates sister ?  
---
Sure mate, keep insults it sure gives credit to your arguments.
---
We already time our moons to the maximum time. Doubling the maximum lifespan will allow us to exploit twice as many moons as we do now.
---
Ouch, stop hurting me. Loool
---
&gt; they can escort a fleet
---
 this kills the eve.
---
I'm not Icelandic ;)
---
I'm hoping that's not the case. In it's current iteration combined with cloaks, the only option that makes sense is to afk in rorquals with t2 drones or rat in a super with a fleet tank. There is no in between.  
---
For all of the hurf and blurf here, I'll just liquidate the bulk of the accounts by extraction and shut down and give the main/titan the 3-4 years of plex time and call it a day. That would turn me into a ping warrior, having zero assets in space to hunt or kill unless you are waiting for the large fleet fights.
---
Hover over the transaction. It should say something like "X deposited cash in \[your\] account"
---
I never said any of that, just that with all those tools it was safer than anywhere else and that it needed to be made dangerous again (specially considering the rewards).
---
Any semi-competent group should be able to easily defend themselves from solo players or small gangs, specially if they are strong enough to hold sov. Nothing wrong with that.
---
But from that to "free isk farming in absolute safety unless you completely fuck up" there is a really big fucking step.
---
The figure is that you should theoretically never get hit if you go always 3000m/s within 25km. In practice, you get hit. This mean that the theory is wrong.
---
Never enough &lt;3 for the bad old days!
---
We said this was temporary in our messaging, and we said this was a test.
---
If people want to get assmad about that, it's on them.
---
Personally, I hope that at some point after the test it becomes permanent, with other changes for nullsec local too, but we'll see.
---
You don't need trillions of isk in infrastructure to exploit PI, though.
---
So new character but old player returning with an alpha account. Is this the best deal currently? Should I just sell the multiple character trainer if I am not interested in handling multiple characters?
---
Post killboard please.
---
ACLs and standings exist. CCP can't remove standings without giving us a huge advantage when we bring the portrait pack back online.
---
i think you should move to whs. there your numbers would be sufficient and you could earn more
---
I for one play much rather PvE and avoid contact with other players as much as possible.
---
Okay, you have smaller corps and alliances ... but the operative entity in NS is the coalition which is an out-of-game thing.    You'd just end up with coalitions made up of more, smaller alliances.    That won't do anything to the coalition.   As far as I can see the size of corps and alliances is irrelevant.
---
What am I missing?
---
+1. And, carebears multiboxin rorq/ratting Carriers are afk on game as they are in Reddit laughting on HS/LS people about how poor they are. Or how hardcore are the people on Null. Elite PvP. Etc.
---
Some of the more Legendary chat warriors, are the more care bears on game and risk adverse.
---
Stick with the Astero. A Stratios just makes you slower and a bigger target.
---
At this point I'm just going to assume English is not your primary language so you just don't understand idioms and analogies in it.
---
I was only pointing out his want for it. Gatecamps are fun at times, especially when you dont HAVE to do it. It should be your choice, not some stupid mechanic that forces you to sit on gates for hours on end watching paint dry.
---
Cause the other side of the argument is that people dont roam enough. They like to talk shit but outside of this event, people rarely roam which makes gatecamping suuuper boring over time. Its a give and take thing, if people roamed more gatecamping would be needed more which in turn would lead to more roams and so on.
---
And honestly, I PvE so I dont have to resort to spinshipping. If CCP would actually make it viable to fight wars without a trillion different timers I would gladly fight all day instead. But right now wars are even worse than gatecamps which says alot.
---
Vince FCs regularly Travis has been MIA for about 2 years at this point but good for you to claim what people do :p
---
So as a really new player on an alpha account (~2 million skill points) how do I make the most of this for my one character? I am only really interested in having one rather than alts. I used to play back in 2007ish - before all of the skill injectors/and whatnots.
---
Ramifications on no JFs in lowsec would be... interesting.
---
Yes!! Thanks. Glad you enjoy.
---
At this point you can go fuck yourself.
---
Kindly :)
---
Where was this absolute safety is what I am saying. Your implication with that is that literally no one ever died making isk in nullsec which is wrong. I am saying more pve players died in nullsec than any other space and to imply that nullsec was safer despite this case is nuts.
---
Hello everyone.          
---
Ive bookmarked every gate in providance and cash so far to avoid gate camps. I also wanted to bookmark a few more systems. but is this useful later in the game? do older players/experianced players use this type of bookmarks?
---
&gt; There's only so many hands that we have to work on things, and you gotta set priorities man.
---
you're not wrong, but then again when the priorities seem to skewer towards:
---
- making an entire line of instanced pve content with unfinished modules multipliers(*still* no mkt integration) and 
---
- adding a whole new race of ships with unique designs in the game where you yourself rightly said we have too many with no roles already
---
its kinda hard to eat up the priorities talk, *especially* coming from a ls background. Yeah I know its not your call on what priorities they take but come on.
---
Did you know Poitot is the only named system in syndicate?
---
Please get rid of warp to 0. Maybe a random occurance or timer in random null or lowsec systems at random times. And players would have no idea when it happens. 
---
Omfg that would be dope. That would be fun. Or possibly a wormhole effect.
---
i bet I pvp more then you nullbear scrub and im 5days old !
---
10 years of playing EVE, perhaps? 
---
Smaller alliances tend to have more drama, this tends to lead them to self-destruction and create power vacuum ... and more drama, that leads to conflict
---
Imagine complaining that a Titan is bad at engaging subcaps after nullbears complained for years that Titans could engage perma mwd 4 LSE drakes

Usually when I get something bigger, better and more costly in a game I play, it's mainly for progression in the game's story. But this game has no story to follow which doesn't give me an incentive to get some bigger stuff when the cheaper and more basic stuff does the job just fine.

They won by throwing stations at the GSF until the goons tired themselves out and went away. Wait, that's not how winning works xD
---
Is there any chance for a new player to kill Triglavians without a fleet? Is it possible to find a fleet to do an event like this?
---
Gitgud or gitfked
---
But if you want super safe. So safe that you can go afk. Then go to HS. Not Null.
---
Still, you can have Intel. But you have to get it from actual players being on screen. Working as scouts. Being on comms. And playing the game.
---
The only thing Lost with local is the 40 sistems intel with 40 pods docked and posting names on a channel to an external app tell you to pause Netflix and, actually play the game, as you mine/rat...
---
...and bots.
---
Stop afk ratting or afk minening. Make active minning OP/ratting. Be on comms, be on the game... Er... Playing it.
---
blackout just makes awox cynos redudant really
---
delve back at it again
---
I believe that is kind of the point OP.  Null Sec is supposed to be dangerous, it is supposed to be a challenge for even the most experienced players.   Although results may vary, it is not meant for just anyone to go out and find success.  Experience should be required.  That's why there are beginner and intermediate game activities in empire and low security space, it's meant to be a stepping stone.
---
Thats why they farm Provi vs. organizing against Goons or other umbrellas.
---
Honestly would love this miss the days of all the small gangs roaming through lowsec in things bigger than destroyers if people were motivated to live in low again
---
Now see I'm actually curious have you never heard of the expression "spell it out" or were you being as I had originally assumed intentionally taking everything very literally.
---
I gated past him looking for cute bois to date, figured id scan him on the off chance he was dumbo fit.
---
He was in fact dumbo fit.
---
I said, Hey penif this guys retarded lets kill him
---
Penif said, jeez wizz, he must be retarded, we should kill him
---
So we swiped through grindr for a few minutes till we found enough cute bois
---
Warp a dictor to him, tackled him, lit the cyno and shot him till his ehp reached zero.
---
After this, we all died to DD's while singing along to Bad Guy by Billy Eilish
---
It uses cronjobs to keep things up-to-date, he could've disabled the views and that'd be it. And it's doing a whole lot more than simply checking some values in a JSON response. 
---
There is a reason he is using a 100Gb in memory and 12Gb in Redis cache. Plus he has a bunch of other popular services aswell which are connected to zKillboard and need more info, like the after action report sites.
---
Stop making all these random assumptions, it doesn't look good on you
---
Calm down, you are starting to go full retarded.
---
Let's see: I never talked in absoultes, of course people doing PVE died because it happens everywhere, but most NS deads can be explained by "not paying attention" or "doing something really stupid". And there are lots of deads because there are lots of people there, way more than in LS and WH together. 
---
Just in case, to prevent another stupid argument, I've been ratting in NS for the past 4 years.
---
And to your last argument (if one can even call it that), WH are dangerous for FAR MORE reasons than just not having local chat. I won't explain this because it's so obvious it's almost painful.
---
You got me, I'm 2 years short.
---
Okay, you have more drama in 20%\* of the nullsec population.    What problem was solved?
---
\* I made this statistic up based on my unproven belief that the majority of NS population is in aforementioned large coalitions.
---
No one uses those anymore, every gate has a station near it to feather to and see if clear
---
I feel that scrambling should work like jamming which inflicts a chance of warp loss. I'd even be fine with scramblers causing a delayed warp based on scramblers vs stabs. This all or nothing scrambling is garbage. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy being hunted and hunting but catching a ship or taking a bridge into a camp shouldn't be a gaurunteed death sentence.
---
Well, you havn't played the game yet. There are pretty good incentives to upgrade your ships.
---
through that wormhole 4 jumps outside of jita
---
Yess lol
---
Well, that guy deserved it, so......
---
And not the proliferation of caps, SP or braindead PvE? No local is a bandaid fix and not a silver bullet imo, without adjusting the null sandbox this isn't going to fix everything for a long period of time
---
Honestly wouldnt get much. Larger corps would become alliances with the same structure and alts holding CEO positions. Alliances turn into coalitions with alliances having alts as execs with the same people in the same positions. Some new blood may rise up during the transition period which will be nice and cause a little drama but all in all it wont be much of change.
---
A+ dude
---
I dont want to do that,can we just do a station trade?
---
Oh for sure. If u had switched to hammerheads or Vespas ecs, I might have had chance. Either way, good kill and happy hunting.
---
Upboot
---
it should be illegal to drop blops on vnis, the poor fuel deserves better
---
Dude probably fell asleep. Happens all the time with spod brain
---
Everyone I know is max gimping. I bought meta so I can fit more T2 tank.  In Provi atm you getting Porpoise boost or no boost.  Any barge that is not a Proc or Skiff is supposedly banned. Gimp fit Proc does slightly out mine max Expedition Frig.  I been using Expedition frigs and mostly been ignored.  Instead of boost I use 3rd toon to undock VNI pop rats pop wrecks. Dock up.  When something pops up on the D. Cloak up the Frigs.
---
Your bet is lost.
---
That's not the safer route, its the fastest route, i.e. the one anyone would have taken when trying to 3rd party a fight.
---
I can assure you Hi-Sec is very dangerous. But I see your point. I will adjust accordingly, but I do not see myself doing missions.
---
This, buff Caldari supers. Caldari are victims of discrimination. 25% of all supers should be Caldari. This is injustice.
---
I enjoy the blackout, and I'm fine with mid warp bubbles existing. Just gate camping needs fixing. It's extremely low effort for the hunter.
---
That would have been my dream for my corp. Alas it never was ment to be.
---
They seemed good at what they did but without being toxic elitests like some other groups.
---
If I have a good freighter to haul my cargo, I don't feel the need to get more picey one - at least that's my train of thought right now. Bigger and more pricey ships are just attracting pirates and gankers who smell profit and I'd like to avoid run-ins with PK-ers. Not to mention that it doesn't matter if I do the same random stuff in a big or a small ship, it's still random stuff without much meaning.
---
&gt;But from that to "free isk farming in absolute safety unless you completely fuck up" there is a really big fucking step.
---
&gt;Let's see: I never talked in absoultes, of course people doing PVE died because it happens everywhere, but most NS deads can be explained by "not paying attention" or "doing something really stupid". And there are lots of deads because there are lots of people there, way more than in LS and WH together. 
---
Made sure to quote your absolutes for you. 
---
&gt;And to your last argument (if one can even call it that), WH are dangerous for FAR MORE reasons than just not having local chat. I won't explain this because it's so obvious it's almost painful. 
---
Ya cynos and static gates and Titan bridges sure make wormhole space more dangerous, I don't know how you handle the ability for an entire fleet to appear on grid with you.
---
Could you elaborate on what makes wormhole space more dangerous?
---
Every aspect of this great came involves risk.  However, I don't think it was meant for new players to come in and make billions of ISK doing high end content in a protected pocket of nullsec space.  There are great ways to make ISK without being in nullsec.  The games interface guides you if you know where to look.
---
As a PVPer on different levels (solo, small gang, large fleets cap and subcap) I can´t say I agree with the changes. But we will just have to wait for ppl to figure out things on the long run.
---
 So what's wrong with stabilizers then? 
---
They seem pretty reasonable to me considering you have to give up more than one cargo slot as a hauler if you really want to have a chance at countering any tackles since most people have more than one disruptor anyway, and don't scrams take 3 stabs to counter?
---
Average fleet size in a "healthy" alliance is going to be around \~5-10% of total characters in alliance. and thats going to include some multi-boxers.
---
HTP with 212 members atm can do fleets of \~10 dudes unless there is a pre-pinged objective.
---
I bet you there's already at least one bot for Wormholes that checks D-Scan. It's not perfect, but it'll probably be good enough. Plus you can always just stuff a scout 1-2 gates out cloaked doing the same thing and watching the gate.  
---
It won't protect against everything, but there have already been ways to ambush bots before. This makes it a bit easier, but I doubt it'll completely end botting, just make certain forms of it unprofitable.
---
Is this serious? Phoenix is insanely strong as a HAW Dread.
---
This has to be bait, right? 
---
And it's a TEST member, too. What the fuck.
---
This is so good I'm surprised it hasn't been done before

We've broken login records over the weekend, CCP wants to throw an extra promotion in, goonthink is "THE GAME IS DYING THEY'RE PAYING PEOPLE TO LOG IN".
---
Frat think is "PLAYERS ARE ONLY OUT HUNTING BOTS THEY DONT WANT TO FIGHT THINGS THAT SHOOT BACK"
---
Meanwhile I'm sitting in staging fighting an endless stream of fuckin wormhole gangs, gfs boys.
---
You need to grast the concept of exageration as an linguistic resource and seriously improve your reading comprehension. Quoting my sarcastic comment to try and prove you are right doesn't help your argument, just makes you look stupid.
---
And no, go read a wiki or something, I'm done trying to get an idea (that you are welcome not to share, but not understanding the argument...) through your thick skull.
---
That's a pretty terrible fit. No wonder he died.
---
Yeah that's what I'm doing now. I bought 3 month sub on Saturday. Hoping they will extend me this offer. Would be cool.
---
Agree that Null is ment to be dangerous. But when those "beginner" activities in High Sec (and soon wormholes that will also be safer than Null) yeld more ISK than what you can produce in a dangerous environment I would say something went wrong.  
---
Example: a good High Sec incursion group can make 100-200 mil/h with minimal skills and danger
---
Yeah I had nothing bad to say, it was just funny.
---
Who?
---
Maybe don't fleet with guys who camp your blue supers? Just a thought.
---
Train skills on your second character then extract them and sell the skill injectors for ISK. Free money for your main. Or you can inject the skills into your main and all it will cost you is skill extractors which are cheaper then skill injectors.

---
Seems pretty active in pvp in a range of different styles too, so not sure what youre getting at really mate?
---
Yes I did escalations: very good source of isk. Exploration also renders income. There are other things I would like to check out in the future.
---
I just finished Caldari Navy to 10 on an alt by doing T3 Distribution missions. Doing the special 16th mission also got me to 9.85 Caldari State.  With max social skills it took me roughly 10 weeks of passively doing distribution missions. If I had to do it again, I'd suggest a 5 second alignn, 9 AU warp speed crane and researching the book that gives you more loyalty points for distribution missions. If you have any questions feel free to ask me.
---
It's OK to be Caldari.
---
There are a whole lot of people that will want to bash this response, but it's accurate.   
---
&amp;nbsp;  
---
I'm a great example of this. I have a large amount of space assets. I haven't really ratted or mined for more than maybe 10-20 hours in the last 12-18 months, but I do enjoy it.  I've spent almost the entirety of the last two years doing exclusively pvp by choice.  I'm not active daily in terms of pvp, I log on to chat, but I try to make it on 2-3 a week and sometimes more.  
---
But in the current iteration of blackout + cloak, I see very little reason to use my "relaxing" hours in a super (with a fleet tank and cyno) ratting which is tedious or in a fleet of rorquals with t2 drones (which would truly be afk mining now, just light a perma cyno and wait to drop titans).  I'm at a point where my PI can cover all of the accounts, but is that the extent of content someone wants? When the best option is to kill epithals? Woo!  
---
Running anything smaller than super/titan/rorq is asking to die very painfully with the level of aggression and dps that can be put on field hastily now, I've seen a fully tanked carrier that was ratting melt in 30 seconds.  I wouldn't wish that on anyone wanting to get in 20-40 minutes of npc shooting.  
---
I'm in a position where I can choose to liquidate a large amount of accounts (I pay in cash around 700-1000 a year to CCP for subs). There would be very little need to keep those accounts active if I won't be using them. Odds are, I'd keep three actually. Main / titan / fax. I have enough assets and SP to extract to play all three accounts on someone else's dime for 3-4 years plus spending money.  
---
I guess that's alright, but it would mean that I am now just a ping warrior. I'll only be on for the pinged fleets (the big ones) and that the chance for me to be out in space and be content for someone becomes zero; unless the content you wanted was a super fleet- which based on the small gang hoo-rah here, it's not.  
---
In the past, I have been caught or engaged in active fleet defense because I was online and active. One of the biggest "oh shit" moments was when a VOLTA crew came in with 150~ nagas and stuff and I was in belt with four rorquals. They came right into system through a rolled WH. In the end, they got one to about 5 % hull before they had to leave. They killed a number of medium and small ships, a carrier on the wormhole and some other things. They lost less than they killed. It was disappointing when VOLTA stopped being the boogeyman and then when they returned to their ways.. a year ago? It was a nice thing to see them back doing their shtick. They are good boogeymen. I had a reason to be active in the pocket and keep up with people and activities. Ultimately, if I have no reason to be out in space except for a large alliance fleet; that would lead to me being less content for other people.  That's not a net positive, at least I don't think it is.  
---
Ultimately CCP will do what they deem best and a person that has owned a business and run several others, I find no fault in that.  As someone that plays the game? I would see no desirable place on the PVE spectrum in null. PVP looks great, sure. But I wouldn't willingly participate in PVE in null in total blackout. Cloaked ships in blackout combined with a cyno results in too fine an edge on that blade from the PVE aspect and I would find myself only wanting to do the PVP portion while it is balanced in the attacker's favor so heavily.   
---
It's not a matter of "can we survive" or whatever. This is just an honest assessment of the situation. I wouldn't find PVE worth the time anymore.
---
I don’t get it or understand what you want out of eve you want small gang pvp ? Tournament? You don’t like big alliances community because you choose to want to be solo ? And hate everybody else that isn’t ? Uhm what do you want brah ?
---
Kinda like you're salty about getting spanked by the renters?
---
Now is actually a great time because of the sale, and if you follow the golden 14 guide you cant do anything wrong. Also if you play on steam there is from time to time a sale on the packs.
---
You're an alliance of 400 and you can put scouts on gates or a few jumps out? Are you actually kidding me...? This is either really good bait or absolute stupidity...
---
Oh look, another idea on how to add local back to Null
---
You're an alliance of 400 and you can't put scouts on gates or a few jumps out? Are you actually kidding me...? This is either really good bait or absolute stupidity...
---
Should have taken those 27 dudes and had some fun then instead of crying into your cups about how hard it is in space.
---
Get more gamers and less fat idiot crabs. You built your small alliance wrong.
---
Also if they crying it's because you cultivated a culture of pussies. Thats on you.
---
Vert... I don't think no blackout would have made a difference, how long had you been hunting this dude? 10 months? Well done.
---
The weird thing was that I have no clue who's portraits to put there, so i just used some GSF dudes and PGL cause he showed up when googling spodbrain. Also, googling all those names only showed zkill portrait, except for xenuria, who's face was blasting through my eyes and burnt itself straight into my (spod)brain.
---
The stats don't really reflect that. The stats for the last few days are down a little, but not much, and its within the variance of the last few months. Saturday is basically average, and Sunday is the lowest it's been in at least 3 months, but that's not that weird since June into July tends to be the start of the summer slump anyway, and that's existed as a visible trend since at least 2009.
---
I get the critique, I do. But one afk Rorq makes about 80m/hour. Its hardly gamebreaking and its not that totally afk, you still have to do things. You have to remember that its a ship that costs alot plus has high SP reqs. And the isk made is a means to an end, that isk hopefully gets used to do something actively. These uberkrabs that people keep talking about, those that only krab, dont really exist in that sense. Most are regular players that need to make isk to feed their other habits in Eve. Without it, what do you suggest they do for isk? If all of NS stopped krabbing then NS dies because no one will have an income.
---
Im all for nerfing the Rorq, which it just recently got. The best way would be to actually up their income but make the drones behave as fighters which means less afking. 
---
But, no local makes it extremely risky to use that ship because the excavators can die without any real risk to the other side. This is an argument that people conveniently miss, whats the risk for a 5 man bomber crew that uses covert cynos to move through systems and no local to give warning to get in range of your 3b drones and press 2 buttons and warp off? People have been doing this for a while and then it was, "the rorq pilot knew that neuts were in system yet kept his excavs out".
---
Now its, well you just got raped without any chance of seeing it happen and no way of doing anything about it. So in this scenario you have 300m worth of ships, killing 3b with zero risk or notice. 
---
This isnt fair man, you have to see that. If no local is a thing then cloaks should be removed and also recons have to lose their d-scan immunity. You cant just remove the only counter against certain things and play it off as a good mechanic. Not unless you want to lose players.
---
It is kinda stupid when you think about it, hide quietly in deep space behind a moon holding in farts and peops can still find you cause you poping up on schindler's list
---
What's your take on the responses so far? It was always clear this is a dividing issue, but has the amount of joy vs outrage surprised you?
---
Just use the map bro
---
On the whole, this is just a first person assessment that could and will be bashed by the small group of people that see things only from one perspective of this game.  I think it’s an honest statement and when someone is being honest, it doesn’t help to say “no, you are wrong and you suck get out”.  
---
I'm a great example of this. I have a large amount of space assets. I haven't really ratted or mined for more than maybe 10-20 hours in the last 12-18 months, but I do enjoy it.  I've spent almost the entirety of the last two years doing exclusively pvp by choice.  I'm not active daily in terms of pvp, I log on to chat, but I try to make it on 2-3 a week and sometimes more.   
---
&gt; ...I'd also ban supers from lowsec and only allow covert cynos, forcing regular capitals to use stargates if they wanted to move around...
---
&gt; ...I'd look at giving JFs the ability to travel via covert cyno, and probably investigate what impact allowing them to use a covert ops cloak would have...
---
Those are legitimately great ideas, and now that no local has been sorted I'm adding them to my priority list to rant about on r/eve
---
If you do ALL the career agent missions for the faction, it bumps you high enough to immediately to T3 distribution missions for any faction.
---
That would involve still playing :)
---
Like I said, most players find a happy medium for risk vs reward. This majority isn't doing it for nothing. There are reasons to have ship upgrades. Ganking isn't as common as you think it is either. Many people follow the guidelines I posted above and that allows them to stick whatever they want on their ships without risk of being ganked. I honestly suggest playing the game before forming opinions. Your opinions that may not be entirely true can have an effect of your gameplay experience. There is quite a bit you can do with a free account.
---
Currently EVE suffers from lack of conflict and sov is rather static... 
---
Conflict draws in new players looking for PVP.
---
Current state of EVE is stale like 3 week old doughnut!
---
You've never jumped into a C5 where someone triggered a bunch of drifters and then weren't able to clear them have you?
---
They're really not. Loki, Legion and Tengu are still very nice ships to play with.
---
Font size is obnoxious but point is valid
---
salvaging, subcap ratting or even mercoxit mining are all dead.  
---
just get in a super and get in fleet and on coms.
---

This guy was so brazen all weekend.
---
good stuff
---
&gt;Any tips on where I should go to find more fights like this?
---
go to faction warfare space in Heimatar (less populated but more likely for a 1v1) or black rise (more populated but more more likely to get into outnumbered fights)
---
&gt;Also some youtubers or twitch streamers would be cool to know too.
---
suitonia is pretty legit but is mostly hunting ratters these days, his videos are still a gold mine, https://www.youtube.com/user/KnightSmiley96   not as experienced as suitonia but goes into his mistakes a lot so a great learning tool
---
&gt;How do you go about coming up with your own fits? 
---
It usually comes naturally as you understand the game more and more, I would not worry about it too much rn and get fits from reputable people, 
---
Also highly recommend training tech 2 autocannons, your damage output goes up by a mile.
---
COAD of '09 want's their meme back.

Just as an FYI, "the guy in the tweet" is the CEO of CCP Games.

Thank you for your reply. I am honest in my post. Will adjust my game-play and money I put in the game accordingly :)

someone please meme mittens as godfather horse head in producers bed meme :P
---
The stickied "no dumb questions" thread here on /r/eve is a good place to ask any question you might have that you cant get answered in the in game help channel.
---
My view (and of course it's fine to disagree) is that the Triglavian hulls fill a need for something completely different in terms of weapon/remote rep mechanics that give a boost to the meta and a little more variation that a re-balance of a ship class wouldn't.
---
When we're talking about adding industrial hulls that already have their roles specifically filled then there's not much point and it feels like a different kettle of fish to me, personally at least.
---
I'm from an LS background too, it's where my heart was from release right through to when I came to CCP in 2012.
---
It's all about give and take in terms of prioritising things :)
---
How about a high slot module that ties in with D-scan, but which adds:
---
* Automated scanning, starting at 5 second intervals at level I, to 3 seconds at level V
---
* Identification of the pilot, starting at 3AU distance at level I, to 11AU distance at level V
---
How bad IS the application of a bomber on a 100mn vni? I'm guessing pretty awful?
---
I dunno, but whatever has been occupying their skin suits is doing a great job.
---
Upvote for the wholesome post. Keep up the good work, man!
---
Nah, I was pretty confident that it was going to be super polarising - it's always been a subject that's brought really raw emotions from both sides of the fence.
---
Indeed, working slowly towards those skills.
---
Luckily, this is not down to Falcon.
---
I mean you don't like liquorice, was there ever any doubt :P &lt;3
---
Congrats man!
---
For the fits, the advice I usually see is to check killboard, you can search to only have the kills involving a specific ship and see how they are fit. I would also advice to take time to "play" with the fit simulation or a fitting program, personally I find it quite useful.
---
I also advice you to see the "Punisher Plan", a serie of articles about a newbro who bought 20 punishers and then loose them in pvp and learn from it. It's really a good read ! ==&gt;http://flight-of-dragons.blogspot.com/2011/02/plan-or-how-to-learn-to-solo-pvp-in-new.html?m=1
---
LMAO Triple membrane, will this actually break a vni?
---
Sounds like you've got some decisions to make then
---
Pretty much this. It's a sloppy attempt to fix issues which need far more investment from CCP.

---
I mean, what's wrong with extending it to highsec too? It's not as though local is really all that much of a benefit in high.
---
I been playing EVE on and off since 2005 and they have talked about for about that long.
---
This wouldn't be an issue if speed-to-win wasn't current meta. 
---
What happened to brawling?
---
Allow them to use covert-cynos?
---
Yea, I posted a much longer response somewhere else. Ideally, I'd prefer to see something like a 1 to 10 minute delay on local. More than enough to catch anyone at all but not so long that someone can indefinitely cloaky camp. That's my  primary item that I see as OP.
---
Is it better now? I saw it on my phone and did multiple edits.
---
Somebody give this man a job.

Also that Hilmar comment about WCS had me so hard.

Grats dude! Daw the T1 newbro v newbro fit.

Facwar space is a good place to find these kind of 1v1 frigate fights. Take a look at some of the t1 frigate commentary from Blight's Wretch, Lasker Emmanuel, and Suitonia for ideas of what to fly. Personally I like to jank it up against the meta and see what I can get away with so I fly arty rifters, but good ships will serve you better lol.
---
Brawl rifter's not that bad.
---
That's the DST, which already has a 50K m^3 fleet hangar. But they still die to anything that has scram+point. Need to make those more survivable somehow, preferably without making them covops-capable.
---
So resub one account.
---
If you feel you need a second (cyno, scout, whatevs) sell some assets and PLEX for a month. 
---
Or PLEX the accounts you feel you need for a month and buy the subs a few days from now because a new CCP with balls rocks!
---
(if you weren't coming back you wouldn't have needed those assets anyway...  in which case I will add the expected.... 
---
Can I has you stuffs?!)
---
Here is a 5th, Me.
---
Only worth it on Scorpion.  A decently skilled Scorpion pilot.  Probably more.
---
But it was through friendly space wasnt it? Fastest route and safer route are not mutually exclusive. But it doesnt matter, check the map yourself to see what would happen if north goes to war with the south, or east to west. Chances for non goons to be able to just use NS for movement without it becoming a clusterfuck of epic proportions is not high. 
---
But by all means, go with your idea. Wont take long for such a change to get removed because alliances wont move their supers in the same way. And they most likely wont ever fight far away wars because of increased risk.
---
I'm reminded of Chessur's old blog, where he talked at length about how certain wormholers believed that living in a wormhole entitled them to the gameplay of having one's own private EVE server.

CCP is announcing things through lore again?!  
---
WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH THE CCP OF INCARNA AND GREED IS GOOD?!?!
---
Oh Lord send in backup, they just dropped three Anshars and a Rhea on us!
---
he was gatecamping.
---
it's almost like he plays a range of different styles and isn't solely pvp, shock horror
---
I had added a triple dash somewhere to hold a thought, forgot about it. The whole thing went nuts. Oh well! Cheers.
---
You can get torps to hit cruisers pretty well with specialized fit. Its slowing down the vni enough for torps to apply well enough that's the hard part
---
Did the same. Now I regret it. Damn you CCP!
---
Praise be
---
I cancelled my sub till it's over. This is not an improvement for null sec exploration/hacking and I won't pay to be someone else's content. This turned one of the things I enjoy about the game into a stress filled endeavor. I don't pay to be stressed. Before, there was a constant fear of getting ganked but at least if I did and lost my ship it was because I was greedy and tried to finish hacking a site when I saw the red/kos enter the system. Now I can't see them enter the system and I have to sit there hacking a site wondering when the gank is gonna hit. I tried it for a few hours the other night and didn't lose a ship but it was stressful AF. I hope it is only temporary. I will come back. For now I am voting with my wallet and I hope everyone else is too.

**ITS HAPPENING

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

I like the idea that after CCP released the locations of all unknown signatures that with local out WH people got that buff back. I have been enjoying running around null doing exploration much easier.
---
Sexiest lore I've ever read

Gotta game those metrics to tell a story.  This is CCP \*360M Ticks\* Games.

If that's the case then I don't think the Blackout had anything to do with it. You guys are pretty bad by any standard
---
Only 800mm plate. No wonder he died

But there will be structures to reinstall local or some other type of intel.

Intaki Syndicate to Hold Summit Meeting Discussing Nullsec FTL Comms with ORE, Thukker Tribe and "Strategic Partners"
---
Keep going, don't stop now.
---
That's super helpful, thanks.  I'm not looking to grind for perfect standings for the market alt, but I'm at zero and paying those feeds every transaction offends my sense of capitalism.  I saw your other comment regarding the Crane - will check that out as well.
---
Lol, talking about dropping structures.
---
If you don't think Elo, Vee, PGL or Travis were/are good FCs you are delusional. 
---
If you don't think Vily and Twinky were influential FCs...you are retarded.
---
That sounds fucking amazing.

EVE is Living !

Found one in the wild!
---
Oh, amazing info on the guns.. I'll do that now.. my skill queue is just sort of random atm. I've only been back a short time and wasn't sure what to train yet. I think I'm not far from that Heimatar area so maybe I'll head there. Gonna log in now and check! I was maybe going for Assault Frigates next but I guess I should upgrade guns first?
---
Thanks for the tips! really appreciate it
---
Hey thanks!
---
I fail to see the problem here.
---
You crit the hole.
---
We're mostly in agreement.   I think fostering conflict between large null sov holders will bring back more players than anything one can do for small alliances.  (Remember the jumps in subs after each of the big, famous null battles.)   
---
Right now CCP is focusing on bringing back roamers.   However, it's arguable that the more attractive draw is actually nullsec empire warfare.
---
We have the same goal, just different ideas on how to get there.
---
Sorry i wasn't aware you wanted to solo a vni... We usually get them with small gangs. Tackle jumps in, warps in, tackle, and then holds him while the rest of us pile in for dank bot km's
---
Not anymore
---
Thanks! I have no idea what half these modules or whatever do right now.. but I will try my own ideas out eventually I think too
---
Obervatory is coming agree with lore.
---
well, i know that greed is one of the major driving forces of mankind. That's why some players will logon, no matter if they drive the login count up this way.
---
My 12 accounts will stay in stasis - and if i ever will reactivate them does'nt depend on some rebates or gifts, i'm rich enough, all chars have more than sufficient skills, i could even rip 200M skill points out of them without loosing much.
---
There are so many games i own which i never startet to play, now's the time for those.
---
I feel you need to see who is in low-sec local so you know who to troll. It would be no fun in FW if you don't know there is anyone to taunt. 
---
Plus it is still Empire space.
---
Dude, the reason why this happened is because you failed as a leader and allowed your members to become turbokrabs.

yes if you go through the catalog and scrutinize every little bit of his project you will find something that is by definition legacy, but most of his code looks fine to my eyes.
---
I would be it was shut down for being about as shit as your posting.
---
Awesome, thank you for the guide! I do play with the fitting system in game a bit and I know about that pytha one, but it's been hard for me to digest so far. I might just keep losing fights and figure it out that way.
---
 Yes, sir. PYFA says its something like around 120dps with painter and rigs

Bob bless CCP for this great change
---
Sorry to hear about your losses. I'm in small alliance and we faired very well. Not one negative nanny among us during the blackout.
---
&gt;Not sure why someone would even use a t3c to hunt anymore... they are literally garbage
---
They will still generally shit all over a VNI/ other unprepared ratters or miners.
---
cant wait til classic comes out woo boy
---
asher and jay do NOT deserve the title of a spodbrain! Yes, they're goonie goons, but they are extremely good pilots and fc's that put up with a lot of REAL spodbrain.. Spod bless those boys.
---
How small is your corp? It's pretty hard to gank a blob of procs/skiffs. Miners can be pretty dangerous unless you want to drop T3s+ on them. Beware the drop, but those 3 guys in hecates really aren't dangerous to a group of skiffs/orcas/rorqs.
---
Also they haze bombers REALLY fast, so while you might take some losses (note: refit for remote shield boosters on your orca/rorq/depots to take fights!) you're going to kill a fuckton of bombers and get a good fight out of it.
---
Appropriate.
---
That's not hard, dude. That's really not hard.
---
I have an idea.
---
- you ready up in a ship
---
- The system finds 14 other people also in similar ships and forms a fleet.
---
- Your fleet and another similar fleet is teleported into a random wormhole
---
- The fleet with the last ship standing or the first to hack a module wins. Both sides get some isk and free SP, the winners get more.
---
- Your ship is then teleported back to station so you can PVP again.
---
Blows my mind kekes like op exist.
---
Bring back Jovian hulls even if its just for an event. 
---
But mostly my main desire is to see how supercapital proliferation and citadel proliferation can be combated. Titan fleets aren't really the intended vision of CCP are they really?

#2019YEAROFTHEIMPERIUM
---
PBUH BROTHER, ROCK ON
---
I like trains!
---
How is no local connected to big alliances stomping smaller ones? They can do that with local chat also, maybe even better?
---
More and more...If Star Citizen ever gets their shit together...really gets their shit together its...well..for EVE...game over man...game over!
---
Well there are these things called corporations.  It’s a strange group of people who all play together and if you’re lucky may help you scout any systems you travel through
---
It's quite amazing you wrote a page long rant within a such short span of time
---
hear! hear!
---
Yep. Desperate times call for...
---
I personally always preferred wormhole exploration to nullsec exploration partially because of the lack of local. Keeps things interesting and exciting, and it's not just free isk anymore; gotta put at least some effort in!
---
What I meant was double the time it takes for extractions without increasing the size of the chunk
---
Is that filthy frank aka Joji? He makes music now and its actually good.
---
I want the old EVE back that had small, medium, and large alliances occupying null who didn't instantly light a cyno the moment anything is tackled. Or groups who didn't instantly warp a super to a gate because you're roaming their space with 5 guys. I want the EVE back that was actually hard for everyone, hunters and the null dwellers alike. 
---
Null has very little risk anymore, it used to, and I want that back. Null has become way too safe, in fact I'd argue safer than highsec at this point. I am going to assume you didn't play during the era I am thinking of, but it was before the massive capital proliferation that we see today. Capitals used to require subcaps to supplement them as they weren't the swiss army knife of today. I don't mind blobs, I have been fighting those the majority of my time in this game. What I do mind is cynos, and capitals being spammed everywhere.
---
Keep covert cynos though
---
Because you can view Reddit but can’t google eve dev blogs?
---
Don't let the goonthink ruin your experience. Salvaging can be done aligned, so you're more or less universally safe. If you're slow on the warp you MIGHT get caught by a bomber, but you can always fit stabs. Salvage in something very fast warping if you're really lazy.
---
Subcap ratting - afk ratting is risk/reward, active ratting just rat aligned out and you're a huge pain in the ass to gank. They might get a bubble on your warpout if they're good and you're slow, but again it's not "dead" or "unviable". You just have to not be a complete spodbrain. You can also rat in things that are dangerous to gank, like vnis that drop a little bit of ratting dps for combat power. Dual rep cap boosted VNIs are a great way to haze a t3c gang, it's hilarious.
---
Mercoxit mining, as I said in my other post, is alive and well. There are a lot of things that really don't want to gank a bunch of skiffs. You can be aligned, and you can also have enough people around to take the fight and kill tackle/bombers. Refit for remote reps to help allies or smartbombs to kill bubbles, and you can fight your way to safety or even make your attackers regret going anywhere near you.
---
&gt;words
---
No. Null sec should be local chat free. The players have proven anything else gets intel exploited.
---
Yeah, you can do fine. You're just letting other people's fear fuck with you. You're not as bad off without local as you think, wangspin didn't destroy wormhole space.
---
Instead of blackout though wouldn't resource redistribution be a better future for Eve?
---
Shouldn't mining a resource deplete it?
---
Wouldn't this help with those massive empires of Ever corporations owning entire sections of the map?
---
Anyone have any thoughts on this?
---
" I hope that at some point after the test it becomes permanent " That's exactly why i decided to unsub
---
YOU FUCKS LITERALLY WHINED PEOPLE OWNED TO MUCH SPACE SO FUCKING ENJOY US BEING BALLED UP LIKE YOU FUCKING ASKED FOR REPEATEDLY UNTIL IT FUCKING HAPPENED.
---
Yes! Holy shit dude... Poe's law
---
You're a fucking monkey. In null you have a super umbrella to protect the ungodly amount of Rorqs out AFK mining 23/7. Mining happens in low and / WH space all the time you just can't get the same number of people mining in Rorqs to match goons numbers because there's no protection for them. As for critting a WH. Do you know just how large a fleet you can get through a crit wormhole? Because it's definitely enough confessors to break a Rorq. If intelligent people mine in wormholes they close their holes and leave them unwarped which gives you about an hour of peace before you need to do it again and even though you need to keep your eyes open for new sigs.
---
I acctualy agree if we get more isk or loot for local it would make null true end game content with no local + cynos and caps
---
Dude's in goons and complaining about a lack of allies? I need a drink
---
Man I’d love to fit one of those for burners 😳 I had a search but I dunno if anyone has a fit out there for burners
---
We can agree to disagree about Asher. 
---
But how do you not remember Lowsec Voltron memeing CFC outnumbered 3:1 for like a month before WWB even broke out.  
---
Shit the only reason WWB took place is because LSV was curbstomping bees all over the place.
---
these are beautiful ideas
---
I don’t think the opinion of someone who subs for 6 months out of 9 years to play the hacking mini game should really be on the list of valued opinions when it comes to development.
---
[Are you sure?](https://gfycat.com/quickhealthygoldenmantledgroundsquirrel)
---
Yet another aspect of wormhole space that's good for the rest of Eve. Kudos
---
Who the fuck still rats after getting a faction super. Like really.
---
Dont worry, subbing extra acount when i get back from my fishing trip.
---
Omg, definitely stealing this
---
oh goody, daily quests.
---
i was totally missing playing WoW since that's what we seem to fucking well be now.
---
all that's missing is a rep grind to go along with it.
---
There's always Risk thresholds.
---
I'm in FW where we routinely whelp whole fleets knowing that it'll die when we undock. Mostly it's cheap ish stuff (frigs, dessies, AF, T1 cruiser, faction frig/cruiser, BC, T1 BS...) and we'll take on pretty much anything where there's chance of a good fight (i.e.: not a 20 man Drek fleet, links, a few t3c tackle and a whole guardian wing.) And typically we all (both sides) warp off in pods spamming gf in local.
---
I'll punch into pretty much any plex I could possibly fight with t1 frigs/dessies even though it means starting at a disadvantage...
---
I won't undock my caps unless I'm pretty darn confident I will make it back. I can't afford to replace them more then once every 6 months. I can't afford to fly expensive doctrines like Leshak, Nightmares, or Machariel but I can afford to lose 2-3 guardians a month. Again it's FW so for the most part, you buy your own ships.
---
No they flew primarily Machs and hazed the shit out of CFC fleets....and were pretty much the sole reason that everyone in EVE piled in. LSV showed that CFC were just a paper tiger.
---
But what does that have to do with the question?
---
Well, if you aren’t flying gate to gate, they don’t know you are there either. WH hop like a good explorer.
---
Oof, that's fucking awful.
---
Good kill!
---
It's dreadful but alot of the Ishtars I have come across have had no prop mod, Torps have been super good vs those.
---
must be happy to know that local blackout is staying indefinitely then &lt;3
---
Wasn't my idea. All I said was that there would be impacts to navigation (such as routes being cut off) and they **may** be desirable.   
---
Why should the north be able to go to war with the south without the consent of anyone in between? It's like suggesting Poland should be able to invade Greece without asking anyone in between. 
---
My entire point is that EVE **might** be better off with more meaningful borders **if** they can drive conflict.
---
yay!
---
HE DID IT!
---
This hilmar character sounds like a salty winging moron to me. There is a counter tactic for every tactic in eve. I've been popped with a hull full of stabs.
---
I would like to have a hydra wh - easily identifiable, can lead to a random set of one class type (c5s only, c4s only, etc). You jump through it as a fleet and can land together in a random wh.
---
Make those end wormholes the kind where there has been recent ship losses or lots of recent pve.
---
Basically a content driver. Will definitely make wh space spookier.
---
Yeah there would be several issues that would take a while to figure out. Seems like an interesting idea though
---
Presumably if/when CCP gives us structures to build in nullsec that will bring back local, they'll be fuelled by Helium-4. Wonder if players will have to mount assaults on highsec DED stockpiles of He-4 to get that fuel? Destroy the alliance's standings with the DED in exchange for local in null?
---
Others in this thread talked about allowed JFs to take covert cynos.
---
Most likely.
---
failing to see where theres complaints of "lack of allies"
---
So you make an statement and I refute it and then you play puppet master. How about you actually try making and defend a point instead of using hyperbole.
---
And you say go read a wiki but here I am giving points that support what I'm saying and again all you have is no response?
---
I will ask again what danger does wormhole space have that nullsec doesn't have. And when you make that list how do those compare to cover cynos and bridges and static gates that you can't close?
---
Probably, yeah, but my knowledge of knowledgeable EVE personalities is limited.
---
&gt;How do they grow supers and titans to make a shield and venture into null without aligning themselfs current major powers.
---
ezpz just remov supers/titans' offensive abilities in lowsec (so bridging is still g2g, and they can travel thru too)
---
Nice, thanks CCP.
---
Fuck you falcon.
---
If I put money where my mouth is ...
---
well fuck the other side of the fence,
---
theres a hotkey for dscan.
---
Can you ban capitals and WCSs in FW space :(
---
Exploration in a Strat is dumb, no advantage over a Astero and slow as hell to warp.
---
As someone who makes half my isk with jspace relic/data, your doing it wrong, HTFU.
---
dude just play the game and that stress goes away. 
---
they just removed your crutch. you can still learn to walk without it.
---
Yeah, but everything goes in that direction: Mining to afk mining, ratting to afk ratting, FW to no implants, no fight semi afk style. We eventually get ground down by grindy things and find afk ways to play.
---
This whole local think seems like a clever way to breath a bit of life back into the game. I am glad they did  something like this and hope more ideas come out too.
---
Blackout now temporary until new structures. Check test server. Or don't.
---
Still supports the company though
---
Same here. Cheers to forward progress.
---
Recommended EVE resources for solo exploration player? Websites, android apps?
---
Its alright to be bad, its wanting to improve that matters.
---
dear ccp
---
don't do this ever 
---
thanks
---
you just caused me physical pain
---
Do they attack citadels? Do they move to other anomalies and attack you there? And even if they do those things, as you pointed out someone had to trigger them. In nullsec they spawned without wanting, first repeatedly and then in literally every system. How would wspace resident react if every wormhole system was attacked by drifters who attacked structures? Probably not kindly but instead of agreeing with nullsec players everyone just enjoyed their misery and hoped ccp would attack them harder.
---
These are the kind of quality replies I am looking for *rolls eyes*. I would think any company would value everyone equally. Especially one that has dropped money on their product.
---
This deserved to die.
---
Your fun doesn't matter, just the fun of others. 
---
Love, eve reddit. You're all bastards.
---
Read this in Meeseeks voice. Did not disappoint.
---
Routes being cut off means no means of getting there. Like at all. Which means no wars could ever be prosecuted.
---
Was happen on a daily basis without the involvement of countries in between. But I get your point and can only say that this happens on a daily basis. But sometimes you cant negotiate and that will stop your entire war effort.
---
Thats something else entirely than supers not being used in LS because of them being used to destroy competition. I still dont think no supers in LS would work to promote your idea but it is most def interesting is some mechanic could be used for that. Might still create more stagnation since people will blue everyone up but might create conflict over groups fighting to gain key systems.
---
Pls no new structure
---
Much more people will say goodbye to eve, trust me, and I don't care if people think they're krabs or nullbears, they're a consistent part of Eve population (maybe the major part), and without them the game will close.
---
Maybe it will continue for a few months, maybe a year or two but it will became a desert and no one will be interested in Eve anymore.
---
We can love or hate null blocks but they are the only reason this game is famous, without them Eve will be nothing and totally unknown to everyone.
---
As I said, I adjust my gameplay and how I use my money depending on the tune ccp chooses to play. My post is neutral.
---
what thing has fozzie ever done to foster any hope within you that he could do this
---
That’s your problem, your perceived value far outweighs your actual value as a customer.
---
Why is that a scam? (Not trying to be combative, just curious).
---
CCP used to these all the time back in the day.  It's been a couple years since the last one; so I could get 'confusing' maybe.  But I don't really think scam here???
---
Nice!
---
Semi-useful response. I can get my warp align to less than 3 sec on strat. Less than 2 on astero. Is it that big of a difference really? So how would you fit your astero? Instawarp and just hope you see them warp in and can warp out before you get targeted/scrammed?  Or is there some magic astero build I am not aware of?
---
Just alts
---
best AAR of 2019 right here
---
Yes, of course, worst design ever.
---
Gameplay features that enable people to play EVE in a way inconsistent with the way you think they should is TERRIBLE for the game.
---
Why, can you IMAGINE how terrible the game would be if there were more features like this? You'd have SO many people enjoying EVE in a manner that you don't approve of, all the while paying you money for the privilege! Everyone knows that the ratio of ship losses to pilots online determines how successful EVE is; people who are paying to play EVE but not constantly killing or being killed are RUINING the game! EVE is much better off when those players take their business elsewhere and don't skew our precious kills : online metric.
---
It's VITAL to the health, stability, and future of EVE that we crack down on such nefarious activities as soon as possible, before they taint our Killmail Farmville server even further with their unclean funds.
---
Assault frigates are a bad bet for FW, you won't find many fights in those.
---
You can roam nullsec with them tho.
---
Got some context for those stats?
---
Make sure you have probes listed on your D-Scan filter. If they show up, warp off and safe. You are now perfectly safe.
---
Alternatively just use a standard dual web neut rack stratios and change one of the webs for a Zeguma or Ligature analyzer. Or just carry a mobile depot with a relic/data in your hold and refit as needed. Same as wormholers.
---
Get in the habit of pressing V often and you're pretty much safe as long as you aren't idling at a warpable anomaly.
---
How have you done exploration all this time and not been in a wormhole? It's really not that bad if you're smart. Are you uhhh, smart?
---
There will always be "pets" to fill space in.
---
Because there isn't a dev blog for this. Only 'news' not posted by a dev.
---
They were literally always able to punch down and were very good at it (far better in the case of supers and dreads) long before the citadel patch, this is a dumb meme, please put it to rest.
---
I am not the only one who has unsubbed. Some with multiple accounts. Go read the actual forum posts. There are plenty of people not happy with the change. Some are voting with their wallets the same way I am.
---
You didn't refute it, you are just really stupid.
---
It’s as if thousands of bots cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced
---
I'm all for this outside of new bro systems. There needs to be some safety net for newer players.
---
Can I had your stuffz?
---
Supers can take gates. Every system in null can be reached from any other system in null if you take enough gates. There's no route that's impossible, unless your requirement is that capitals never take gates which is risk-averse. 
---
Moving supers should always be risky, forcing supers to move through null only would increase that risk, and imo that's a good thing
---
Then I think Cyno,s is more your problem then the blackout, blackout just makes the major umbrellas even more on the ball , don’t think blackout fixes your issue since this is what this discussion is about turning off local doesn’t get rid of Cyno saves, 
---
Besides if you want to kill supers and rorq s more often , fine make them more affordable like 500 mil to bn then everybody can fly em and make easier to kill but that won’t satisfy you because in all honesty your just as greedy as the pveers, you want 20 bn supers and 100bn titans on that killboard , that’s what it boils down to just the same greed but less honorable because you want it easier. 
---
A 20 bn ship isn’t supposed to be easy to kill , lower the cost of them to 20 million and people’s will feed them all day long but that wouldn’t be the same now would it ? Greedy.
---
The Heimatar and Old Man Star regions are good. You can also often get good fights roaming through Brave/Pandemic Horde space.
---
Yeah,we just checked online for the peak time at sunday. It was around 19:28 ET.
---
super umbrella cannot save all and is pinpointed to some systems. 95% nullsec space is without proper supercap umbrella. Mining do not happen in low sec, because shit ore, small rocks and it so risky, even because station where everyone can dock everywhere...
---
I fell asleep at my desk shit faced. Woke up floating in my pod next to my dead rorq. Checked the loss mails and from the time my last excavator died then the rorq was 4 hours. 4 hours of NPCs shooting me. Haha. Could only laugh it off at that point.
---
You can churn out all the arbitrary numbers you want, but turning off local has done more to promote spontaneous pvp in the wild more than anything else I can think of. If you're having a bad time that sucks, I hope you can dry your tears long enough to figure out why you are playing this very difficult and unforgiving game.
---
Learn to play the game, a covops hacking ship shouldn't get ganked even without local. Source: play in wormholes and explore a lot
---
Fine.  We'll get our own local, with Blackjack and hookers.
---
I feel the exact opposite.  Exploration becomes more fun when I have to evade enemies.  You're not someone else's content; it's your content too! I guess I just can't relate to grinding through relic sites and hope I don't encounter any real challenges.
---
As to your last point, people are voting with their wallets.  Resubbing their accounts that they cancelled long ago.  They didn't want to play a game with no excitement.
---
CCP please DO NOT make an Upwell Structure that puts local back. Suitonia had a great suggestion about local number being available, but not who is in local. I think this is a nice middle ground, but going back to full local would be highly disappointing.
---
NUT
---
No I'm sure there are plenty of other cry babies unsubbing.
---
Make sure you train the golden 15 skills first - they give you a lot more flexibility in fitting your ships. Ask some of the more experienced members of your corp or people you know for a skill plan - most of us bittervets will be more than happy to give direction.
---
Then why do we still use Freighters in NullSec?  JFs have their place and Freighters have theirs.
---
I am literally crying right now
---
That's all that needs to be said really.
---
Yeah,you are playing very difficult game in Imperium. I can feel it. 50 Titan ready to jump in every second. Go make coalition for 50k people?
---
yes only worth what can be mine in low sec is r64 moon. thats all. All other ore is just shit, not worth to mine with huge risk.
---
Forever dark
---
I want local forever dark
---
I really want it dark forever
---
Forever, and ever
---
Someone's salty cause he's bad at fitting?
---
That makes sense. I think I have them turned off. As long as I'm spamming dscan while hacking they have to be close enough to me to find me and will show up quickly right. I have a safe spot set up for each system I frequent. I have hacking and archaeology V. Is the zeugma better than the frostline? That is what i was using. I have heard the zeugma with blackglass implant trivializes hacking.
---
It was worded as if it's not certificates, so I assumed it's direct multi-train addition, but thanks for confirmation.
---
Redeemed this on one new account that already had ‘DLC’ the starter pack and on an old account from 2006. Worked on both. One caveat is I had to place two separate orders on Amazon as the discount only get applied once at checkout so beware!
---
yes, probably.
---
Quality reply, +5 internet points!
---
YES
---
BOB ANSWERS PRAYERS
---
can't they just add the trigs to Null? i won't be able to do this event for killing shit for SP, i don't go to high as i have too many things i need to stay in null for, and i can't go to highsec every day since it'd take me forever to get back home, atleast have some less rewarding even for people in null with situations like there.
---
bots dont count as players.
---
i think everyone who's been logging in has had more fun than they have in a long time. I know i have.
---
Just make them them fucking expensive and eat fuel by the billion, plus a day to online and offline.
---
**yes lowsec do it. Just do it Falcon.**
---
Well, myself and a number of other players along with some Devs it seems believe Null is in a much better place without local. Sorry to see you go
---
We were outnumbering them and still couldn't kill a single SNUFF Mach (I remember once we managed to kill 2-3 of their Nestors instead)  , regardless what we flew , but I guess it was no surprise there when you fly cheap fits and with no implants. Also SNUFF had way more experienced and disciplined pilots to begin with . 
---
We got dunked in Machs, T3 Proteuses, Hurricanes, etc. to the point where CFC FCs would just simply choose not to take a fight with them.
---
thank god it isnt that dumb isd annoucing this dumb lore stuff
---
Oh shit boys, I'm getting so fucking rich off this shit and your telling me it's not gonna stop? I made a billion in a few hours just last night and with the drop in supply and increase in demand I'll be able to afford space hookers forever.
---
Right, and I am sure if those accounts has subbed for 9 years out of 9 years CCP will take that into consideration, but those unsubscribes don’t add anything to your pedigree as a customer.
---
BUT STRUCTURE SPAM
---
&gt; I did in fact confuse east and west. 
---
Me too, I said Atlas. \[not Atlas Alliance basically Atlas Alliance 2\] was in the s-e, but they held Querious which is in the s-w.
---
instant free perfect intel on top of 7 minute invulnerability buttons with unstoppable cynos and infinite local escalation with supers says fuck you, it wasn't fair before, and now you're crying because it's being made more fair than it used to be at your expense
---
when a thing is announced as a test, players will react differently than they will to a new way of things being for the foreseeable future. so your entire pcu argument can be thrown in the trash
---
all your last points are made irrelevant by cyno jammers and the very cynos you're crying about. wormholes don't have supers that teleport to you instantly when you get tackled by an interceptor. 
---
 you get to choose if the frigates that tackled you get to bring friends or not and there's virtually nothing they can do about it 
---
harden the fuck up. glad you're leaving. if you disagree with the points above contract your stuff to Risc Brubal for the Null Supremacy fund
---
THIS IS STICKIED NOW, DISCUSS.
---
Plenty of people were claiming to resub.
---
This kids is what inhaling spod fumes does to pilots.
---
"Can I please have a ship that allows me to hack while cloaked, so I don't get ganked."
---
If you don't like the risk, you don't get the rewards. There are plenty of other games available where you can grind in safety.
---
#We need a lowsec gate to Stain to properly celebrate this!
---
Zeugma and Ligature are basically combo analyzers that do both with the trade off of being less potent than the T1 and T2 versions respectively. They're typically a bit cheaper than the frostline, but yeah with the implant hacking becomes brain dead. Rule of 6's is a good one to learn.
---
In a stratios if they show up within 2.5 AU of you, they'll have you probed down for combat probes. For normal probes depends on site. I suggest using the Sarashawa Overview pack and having your dscan set to "Normal PVP" or "Normal PVP Tidy" - "Ships only" for if you're hunting but since you mentioned not being a pvp pilot that likely won't be a huge concern. Pandemic Horde has a good youtube video on how to set up your overview - but I'm at work so can't link it right now.
---
tech 1 vs tech 1 IN 9UY??? party like its 2007 baybeeeeee
---
I won eve a few months ago, I still get the odd ping and follow reddit as most of us do, I might come back one day but not yet.
---
Blackout isn't enough to make me resub, instead the null blocs need to be absolutely shattered which at this stage is impossible. Huge entities (eg Legacy, PanFam, goons etc) have stagnated eve and suffocated it. I'd be more inclined to resub to fly in lowsec than mull.
---
Blackout is a good idea, but I'd probably prefer delayed local. Local is a great source of Intel both critical and just 'fun'. Stalking Corp mates or even hunters, it's just fun and in Fleet fights its essential. A 5 minute delay would solve both sides of the equation in my opinion.
---
As a method to prevent botting it would be lazy but it does seem to have the potential to stimulate content, facilitate hunting and give a bit more suspense to travelling null and securing it.
---
Tldr, blackout salt is good salt but there's some good criticism, it's a step in the right direction but not enough to get eve back to what we all want it to be, that moment has passed.
---
Pretty easy: If you can't surive in your space you are in the wrong space.
---
Maybe allow blockade runners to jump but only through covert cynos.
---
Now with 500% more structure timers
---
I think the only way to do this is if you remove jumping from that gate.
---
I think some of us know what you mean ;-)
---
YES, lowsec needs it too.
---
I'll hold on to your isk for you,  since the blackout is staying.
---
Just looking at concurrent players, ESPECIALLY in the first few days is a very poor metric though.
---
Many people that will adapt in time may simply not be playing in the hopes it will go away before they come back.
---
Additionally, is concurrent players in the short term more important than engaging content in the long term?
---
CCP has decided trillions of ISK in infrastructure is a thing.  Imagine if it wasn't...  they can build it and they can tear it down.
---
Tbf who are "the little guys" in null which aren't connect to one big bloc anyway?
---
This is the general consensus I have seen outside of the obvious care bear areas
---
Yes, less than 2sec align on the Astero, orbit at 2100-2200m and cloak and warp off the moment you see something on grid or dscan.
---
You can beat the lock delay of other SOE ships and t3c.
---
OOOOMMMMGGGGG LS no Local, permanent! PVP paradise!!
---
&gt;makes a statement
---
&gt;claim I never said that
---
&gt;someone else points out I said it
---
&gt;puppet master
---
&gt; And EVE had just set an all time concurrent login record of 32911
---
Uhm...
---
Well, remember the last time he played the game.  1,000 clicks into the old PI, he said F-this and had the whole thing re-built.  (His story spin 9000 and all).  Maybe he logged in and tried to tackle a quad stabbed ratting Raven or something.
---
Truth is that You don’t want your mind changed so I won’t even try and debate you.
---
It's funny to see Snuff still operates on the same side with Imperium from time to time, and yet they dunk Imperium crabs :)
---
As long as they keep the glitch when if you get shot while the system is recalculating resistances you instajib.
---
&gt; I would think any company would value everyone equally. 
---
Not how anything works
---
I can dig it amigo, I'm not going to be up in arms and want to burn the world down. I just won't want to be on the receiving end of the current equation, would you? Fun factor that is. Fun factor in the equation is entirely on the shark side, I would make 100 % of my game time the shark in this iteration.
---
For starters they do attack ships in wormholes if you are on grid with them. 
---
Have you spent much time in wormholes? It just doesn't seem like you are extremely familiar.
---
Your lifetime value is $90
---
My lifetime value has been north of $600
---
We aren't equal in terms of money spent.
---
Fuck off already, you keep trying to force your argument with no avail, just showing instead a massive lack of comprehension on several areas.
---
I'm even starting to feel guilty about arguing with someone actually retarded.
---
I'm done, keep trying to feel clever on your own.
---
Hope you get better o7
---
Pls no. Giving local back to blocs will only make every local-related problem worse than it was before.
---
Expensive to fuel and no RF cycle. If you can't defend it once you dont deserve it.
---
This is really premature.  The eve meta always freaks out at first.  
---
They are threads from a couple years ago with people saying mining rorqs with panic would never catch on and it’s going to ruin the availability of minerals. 
---
Give the galaxy a few weeks to adjust.  New normal is right around the corner.
---
And there are people resubbing.
---
But also, wouldn't we like a world where game companies made decisions off of what was best for making the game fun and not just best for making a buck?
---
Gotta grinde them A-Types
---
Please for the love of God, do not make structures that bring local back. Just delete local forever and ever.
---
So all the indy guys will quit because their spaceships blow up, hmm?  
---
If you are an indy dude yourself you can't be very good at your job, because more ships blowing up = more profit.  
---
And apparently indy players quitting is bad but when "elite pvpers" do it is acceptable? Come on buddy.
---
Let me make the rebuttal clear. CONCURRENT CHARACTER COUNT IS NOT THE SAME AS PLAYERS, ITS NOT A PROXY, ITS NOT CAUSAL, IT DOESNT TELL YOU FUCKING SHIT ALL ABOUT HOW ACTICE AND ALIVE THE GAME IS. The only place you  can actually have a proxy for activity is zkill. Where we have seen a surge in kills last week and players participating in pvp. Activity and pvp is up, krabbing is down, bots are down. EVE just took her first breath after her long coma, shes ripping out the life support and coming back to life. Praise be to CCP, delivering in her hour of need, amen.
---
Very Nice Indeed
---
That would mess with moon goo supply, which would not be the effect that you want
---
&gt; Without cynos in lowsec, I'd guess capitals would be a strategic asset only.
---
So low class wormhole "ship in a bottle" style?
---
But a cheaper ship explore in a Helios or buzzard they cost like 40m fitted
---
&gt; Less than 2 on astero. Is it that big of a difference really?
---
That's actually a HUGE difference.
---
Sub 2 makes you literally uncatchable. Sub 3 means lots of things can catch you.
---
It takes 2 tickets to lock and scram someone, so 2 seconds. Your warp initialization would happen before their tackle activates. 
---
But if you are only sub 3 warp, then anything with a sub second lock time will catch you.
---
This is of course mechanically, ignoring actual human response times.
---
If observatories are added or any local functionality I will be unsubbing all 69 of my accounts Hilmer.
---
Once triggered if they're not dealt with they will warp around the site to different Anoms and kill people. I'm not sure if they actually reinforce structures but they need go be dealt with to resume business as usual. Frankly I'd welcome more of them.
---
So ccp lied from the beginning. They never intended to see how it played out, they had already decided what they were going to do. If they were basing their decision on a weekend worth of activity they would have back pedaled so fast when they lost 2k concurrent users the entire duration.
---
Oh yeah, 1 painter and a propless cruiser is dead meat. WTF tho. All the ones I find are 100mn, good luck hitting that with torps.
---
Yeah okay, my bar napkin math was a little lower but that's still bad.
---
- Defense only means you can only shoot back if someone is aggressed on you. This would be due to the Force Freighter's local rep ability combined with it's respectable fire power. This way it wouldn't be useful as an offensive target.
---
- Unique EWAR I meant was say someone attacks a Gallente Force Freighter, the FF would automatically apply a sensor damp like effect on the attacking ship. The Amarr one a TD one, the Minmatar a Web effect. For the Caldari FF since ECM is different now it'd have to be a lock break that could cycle every few seconds.
---
- Would be T2 class.
---
- They would replace/compete with JFs to transport things through low/null. The goal would be to establish more instances where people transport their things through space and people try to stop them. The current "cyno on a station" mechanic is pretty meh unless someone royally screws up.
---
- Balance them by adjusting hauling capability, tank, defensive DPS.
---
- NO I WANT NEW SHIP NOW WAHHHH WAHHH RIGHT NOW REEEEE
---
You're right regarding the time/cost/benefit etc of adding a new ship. We could just as easily provide modules to make the existing JFs into this. Say a low slot module that takes away the jump capability, but increases tank, hauling capability, and allows you to fight dps/mid slots as needed.
---
I don't know probably won't go anywhere but I appreciate the back and forth. Also whoever made blackout permanent give them a deep kiss...with tongue. Say "Seraph loves you."
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but can't botters just install cloaky alts at gates and nullsec is the same botridden hellhole as before?
---
This entire thing has only strengthened the large blocs and made it harder for people in smaller ships to engage with content in subcaps. Without local, every foray into a hostile bloc's space will now risk hotdrops and bosons.
---
This is the future you chose.
---
Now they have about 50 vexors on the gate...a little late for that lol
---
O M E G A P O G G E R S
---
Are all moons in the game exploited ? It could make LS moons a bit more worth it too
---
Well yeah and you had wh's to do that...
---
Glad your having fun. Of course people with Omega will tell you that alpha sucks, but it really doesn’t. You can still be an important role in PvP fleets, you could still do FW one on one stuff, you can do just about anything, just at a slower training rate and less expensive higher level ships that you don’t need need to have fun.
---
One tip: at 5million skillpoints you’ll stop being able to train and at that point can only inject more SP up to 20 or something or go Omega. I have an alpha I made a little too jack of all trades that I wish I would have specialized more. So maybe learn the game on one character then once you find what you like then start a new character that focuses just on that. Then you’ll be effective on your desired play-style and can stay alpha if money is an issue.
---
Well, I don't see a reason why a decently fit pvp ship can't solo a vni. For antitackle they're overtuned as shit right now, but they're getting slower, so we'll see where they sit after the changes.
---
Small gangs have no problem, even bait vnis have trouble as you can trade tank drones, hold point from 20, etc.
---
\*Sigh\*, well, it was good while it lasted
---
agree with all of this
---
Look at the damage taken
---
Now look at the plate,
---
Now look at me, moon walking away
---
OldSpice.jpg
---
Start with learning with standard fits, and you'll get there quickly. Everything you learn in t1 frig pvp applies everywhere else.
---
Yup, poor wording.  I'll edit the post to make that sentence more clear.  EVE had set an all time record *up to that point.*
---
how solve it with local?  
---
1) you should be invisible on local 30sec after jump in system - it is enought for  
---
2) more mobile structures - system wide cynoinhib, mobile local jamming unit, mobile personal jump gate  
---
3) make inhibitors scoopable, with less HP and with 0 anchoring time
---
The delve killboard disagrees with you
---
You are exactly the kind of person who shouldn't be playing eve, let alone in nullsec, so it's probably for the best.
---
You keep saying things as if you are the irrefutable judge, you say wormhole space is more dangerous but won't back it up, you say people got risk free isk but won't back it up, when I engage and ask for information to support this you only respond with insults, so which of us is arguing in good faith and which isn't?
---
I suspect, it's not long before I can swipe my plastic to buy SP.
---
So reading the responses, defender missiles, scouts, a gate camp and hopefully nobody already cloaked in the system with a covert cyno. So either make my own alt army, or form up my entire corp/alliance to go and mine and probably still get drones bombed...
---
If launched correctly form a group of bombers (like olmeca or others) there is very little time to react. I hit shift-r as soon as the bombers decloaked as I never not mine afk, and still lost 3 out of 5, in the large anom. Would've been 5 out of 5 in enorm or colossal.
---
I am all for the tactic, not saying it needs to be nerfed into oblivion or extremely easy to counter. All I am saying is it's not balanced currently, and anyone with a brain will not be using excavators where there is focused efforts by guys like olmeca.
---
It could refer to local coming back to NPC null as all three of those groups hold null systems
---
Wouldn't work that way anymore anyway because of keepstars. Lots of people keep their super alts logged in by default or use them for other stuff now.
---
But I agree, having that "shit's about to go down" feeling when supers were logging in was pretty cool.
---
We must secure the existence of black out and a future for space children.
---
I too have never heard of the MWD cloak trick
---
I  unsubbed my accounts due to everyone docking up in null soon as I entered.
---
PvP is null became incredibly boring... killing AFK or botting VNI's is not fun.
---
If the black out continues I will probably come back to the game... so I will be replacing your solo experience of the sand box; with my pvp orientated play style.
---
Please keep in mind when buying that these are not certificates you can sell for isk and are tied to the account omega is purchased on.
---
Why tho? If you want a wh playstyle and wh ticks, go to a wh. Null was and should be something different.
---
&gt;it has become extremely dangerous to earn isk through salvaging
---
are you seriously afraid to lose your 2 mil salvage dessy while you have to be combat probed down to get caught??
---
This is awesome
---
You are dumb as fuck because the killboards came back up today and showed you to be a fucking retard.
---
Nothing of value was lost
---
Actually in terms of lore this actually kinda makes sense.
---
In any low sec system with "empire interests" (NPC stations, FW sites) local is as current, as they have more resources to put into a communications system. Otherwise empty low sec systems have delayed/blacked out local.
---
Disclaimer: I have no idea how many low sec systems are free of both NPC stations and FW sites.
---
 You could just take over the constellation and suitcase all your subs around.
---
I’m not the one bitching that his hacking tool, botting program even, wasn’t working
---
That's true, but I also feel that it's probably beneficial to the game in the long run to make exploration a bit less of an easy isk faucet.
---
/u/ccp_falcon
---
What happened to monitoring the situation? There is no way you can make an educated decision in less than a week worth of data. It was very clearly a decision made and claiming to care what about was lip service to the players. I'm sure 2k less concurrent users would have been some useful info if you actually was trying to look at what happened.
---
Just because something has a counter tactic, doesn't mean the tactic is desirable. For a long time the counter tactic to roaming has been "to dock up and deny content." Great!
---
&gt;So safe that you can go afk. Then go to HS
---
Yup. Nobody ever ganks AFKs in HS
---
They already risked hotdrops and bosons?
---
Come to faction warfare. This is no better place for frig PvP, period. A lot of other PVP is available but small/novice plex really help even the field for frigs.
---
Didn't notice initially, very nice
---
Because that is not the topic of this thread?
---
What ?  i get fights daily in my jag/hawk.
---
#FUCK, YES!
---
His monthly subscription is the same dollar value as yours, that's the language of business.
---
This has to be the way to go
---
If a hauler I socks, he is part of the equation
---
You guys really do bitch about fucking everything
---
This event seems really great for the active userbase imo. However, null is currently adjusting to recent local changes and now the all you can eat sp triglaivian buffet is seemingly not for the nullies also...Heck local can stay gone but who doesn't want more sp CCP!?
---
Join the Winmatar side in Faction Warfare, we could always use more T1 frig pilots :D
---
i think everyone who hasn't been logging in has had more fun than they have in a long time. I know i have.
---
Funny thing, QEHe4 in-game is stored and traded as PLEX~
---
Ah yeah. RIP. 
---
Still a fun feeling back in the day. Even was used to troll other alliances or Flex at people if they were doing stuff with supers. 
---
Ah well. Sacrifices gladly accepted for the limiting of free intel.
---
This is better than the Myrmidon meme kills
---
Wtf did I just read.
---
When someone says you've been hunting them for 10 months but you've barely been hunting them for 10 minutes :thinking:

Someone know if it is offcial?

---
To be fair it's also in the midst of a "walkout" by players to try to protest the changes. It will end how most do though with everyone coming back in to sit at their desk and do their work.
---
I never said anything about killing the bombers themselves.
---
I am curious about the game and there are some interesting stories around it. But there are some things that make me hesitant, some things about the game's core.
---
If bots didn't so heavily depend on local i would be more annoyed with this black out. I've been trying to think of a way to balance this to much vs not enough information scale and think maybe only having constellation chat. It would stop the use of complete information and would add another layer of topology to the map for consideration on how people take and hold space. If someone shows up in local you would only know they are near and not which system they entered from (even if the constellation only has one entrance gate they could enter through whs). This probably still lets bots run as they don't care about being interrupted but now they have to run whenever anyone enters one of a number of systems.
---

---
War decs in high sec would be extremely brutal if you couldn't filter out if any of the huge amount of people in system were hostile or not.
---
I was just discussing this with a friend of mine with regards to low sec. In null sec and wormholes, the space is generally controlled by a single entity. This means they have shared intelligence and have a better handle on who is there and who is not. Not foolproof, but reasonable. In low sec, it would be utter chaos. You often have opposing groups living in the same systems, you have randomers coming through constantly, it would be something that I am not personally against but it would need to be considered carefully imo before a blackout was brought to low sec, especially to FW space.
---
High sec.... there's too much traffic imo that it would be impractical to be able to detect if there were war targets/gankers in system or not. It would also be brutal for new players that are just learning the ropes and game mechanics. That's my personal opinion anyway.
---
I've always said I want to see "salvage exploration" as a legitimate type of exploration. Imagine finding a warzone where 2 massive NPC fleets destroyed each other and you get to salvage it
---
The NPC fleets would travel through wormholes, critting and collapsing them seemingly at random.
---
Wait, are you telling CCP how to interpret their own data that they exclusively have? Or do you know something that we all don't know?
---
turn it off in low sec make all WH shattered so WHer's am forced out of there holes don't just stop with null, you have put your first finger in mite as well go for the fist.
---
PLEX-fuelled structures sound... interesting
---
Only $5 and you can fuel your observatory for a month! Wow!
---
Explore in lowsec/hs then.
---
I don't think you're prepared to accept the answer to "why"
---
enjoy those dank tech 2 mining drone ticks
---
So what you're saying is this: "I should be allowed free intel to hide and make lots of ISK without interference, because I don't want to PvP..."
---
I'm not going to argue and try and change your mind because you've already made your mind up over the whole thing.
---
only if the level of risk is accurately known. no local obscures risk as much as it obscures. there could be 100 sabres cloaked on this gate... but there's probably no sabres, right?
---
people aren't perfect risk calculators. they just act on hunches and instinct most of the time, especially in what is ultimately a video game. what better intel does is make apparent the degree of risk. sure, in theory no local should make you even more uncertain, but in fact most of the risk is obscured in the moment.
---
The real problem with this kind of "evidence" is that they proof nothing really. There is a chance that it is a living person just fucking with you and the system. And CCP will ban him based on that evidence.
---
Adding some type of cyno mechanic would actually be a bit of fun.  
---
Some variety of cyno that would let you set up tunnels into a WH (and out of it) that would open up movement into and out of Null and between WHs.  This tunnel could be mass limited if you want, to limit projection of supers and capitals.  Maybe only in high class WH, where people should be set up to deal with a little ‘shake up’.   
---
It would sure as hell shake up things in NS, but also in WHs.  
---
It would give a lot of power to WH to project into a random system, but it would also make them very vulnerable to projection into them.
---
Honestly, I've never played as much as the last few days. If this gets reverted I'll be out again. Content has been up for both defenders and offenders. All these "-10% OF PLAYER NUMBERS" posts are rumor mongering at best.
---
FYI the 90 days alt-training activates immediately after purchase. and it's not MCT certificate
---
Regarding DOTLAN and ESI internals I would like to make it a bit more clear and transparent.
---
The kills/jumps data is not instantaneous: by far! I collect the data every hour (because the cache timer). There’s no indication when the snapshot has been pulled from the solar system node by the esi server node. It might be 1 minute ago or 59minutes. No one knows.
---
Then the time of your visit of my site (dotlan) or your favorite internal alliance intel tool comes into play.

And 3rd: kills can happen at any time during that 1h cache timer. Right before the cache expires or just when the cache cleared.
---
In the best case your the stats you’ll see is less then a few minutes old (just just happend, then the esi cache expired and Dotlan updated right after.
---
In the worst case (kill happened right after a new cache has been generated, 59minutes after the cache generation dotlan pulls up the stats and 59 minutes after the cache has been pulled you visit dotlan)
---
As you can see: the difference between best and worst case is around 3h. Just because you saw some ship or npc kills on dotlan doesn’t mean it happens right away. It can differ up to 3h. The ingame map is far mor up to date because it directly talks with the solar system node and ignores the ESI Cache and the DOTLAN Cache timers.
---
Would I would appreciate is that if ccp decides to make the blackout a recurring event that maybe some stats data is taken of the api during that time period. You can even create a story around it (like star gate info network crash). You can even make regional events like incursions where parts of the space are knocked out of communication. But keep it in sync with ingame tools, stats, maps, etc. Don’t just kill the api, hide the information als from the ingame map and make the (partial and time limited) blackout even more mysterious.
---
Whilst I agree that null had it way to easy to make money and I could live with (and think it's a good idea) making rorqs a boost only ship again but no local fundamentally charges null's playstyle in a way I don't see myself playing. (I've been on Holliday since this happened so haven't actually played with it)
---
The problem is, that with those conditions, every Trig invasion will end up in the wh/null state OP mentioned.
---
on't like it move out of the euro zone or just us a vpn
---
&gt;theres no significant increase in fights or super loses
---
14 supercarriers and 1 titan have died in the 3 days since the blackout, many of them ratting. The two things I logged in to do this weekend would have been 100% impossible before local was removed and been no-fight situations that resulted in two very fun experiences for me and my 20+ fleet mates each time. My very brief experience so far has been a resoundingly positive one from the perspective of a purely pvp-focused player, pretty much every non-krab I've spoken with about it has had nothing but good things to say. I play in a sov-holding nullsec alliance. Nullsec *should* carry the most risk, given the scale of the groups that live there, 10,000+ man alliances should not need to be babied and handheld with free access to perfect intel to keep them safer than their 9999 closest friends already can.
---
That could be pretty neat.
---
This is not really related to the OP at all?

The more I see this shit the more I don’t wanna be a part of it anymore
---
I still think that having local would be fine but it needs to be tied to the stargates.  The stargates should register people coming in but only after they decloak and not before.  They should also not register WH travel.  So WH=Scary
---
If CCP wants to make observation structures then they can be what pings local and tells you about WH traffic but like its been mentioned they should cost a large amount of fuel to run so even the largest blocks cant just spam them in all there space.  
---
I think this would make an even trade for hunters.. if your quick on dscan they cant be on you super fast, and if your whaling then you scan into a system

Sounds like you'd be happier in a single player game.
---
You missed the entire point of my post.  I apologize that I can't seem to communicate it.
---
 "The only place you can actually have a proxy for activity is zkill " No, that's the only place we have a proxy for PvP activity.  To copy your language, it has fuck-all to do with overall participation in the game, it could mean that there are more active wars going on or less, or it could mean there's more PvP activity in general (probably the case).  But if kills go up and PCU goes down, then we have more PvP activity but fewer people active in the game.  Which is exactly what I'd expect to see with what's happened.
---
Zkill is not the ONLY proxy for activity, either.  The monthly economic report will tell the story, as will whether the PCU continues to drop, stays at this level, or increases.
---
Sounds more like a change to NPC null to have local enabled in those regions. The Thukker Tribe, ORE, and Intaki are the “legal” Bullard NPC factions, while the “strategic partners” likely refer to the other pirate factions that have null sov
---
&gt; I thought I'd have a last word 
---
looks like you found a couple more...
---
Good for you, keep it up.
---
Removing local from null is a huge change to the way EVE works, but I think it's also a bit closer to the spirit of eve in a way. Null should be dangerous. You shouldn't necessarily know what's around the next corner. Null should be a place where players need to work together to survive, and I think gathering intel on surrounding space should be a part of that. Fog of war and all that.
---
You can feed yourself. Find someone else.
---
What I find very interesting is that you can very easily see a correlation between ship kills and NPC kills prior to May of 2016. Afterwards, ship kills go onto a downward trend overtime and it seems like they no longer have correlation what-so-ever with NPCs killed anymore.
---
Tbf the rewards of a nullsec explo site suck so much ass I can’t believe he wasn’t deterred by that earlier.
---
What caused the drops from this jan?
---
Maybe if you are bereft of speech
---
&gt;This probably does not mean jack shit to any of you all
---
Sure we do. It's a rite of passage. Congrats!
---
A deadly hellscape of fuck you lol. Reminds me of the famous description of Eve pretutorial: here's a Corvette. Fuck you.
---
You don't always come through a gate and you can set up a logoff trap much easier
---
Sorry hard
---
No one will miss the bots.
---
what is with your pcu boner
---
it's literally a useless metric lol
---
The link is to the news article on CCPs website. How much more official do you need it?
---
Null was more active. Sure ratting was down, but the game is/was infested with bots.
---
I am saying you can't make an educated decision on this level on extremely limited data. The fact the rest of this is already planned out signals to me there was never a chance for it to not happen and they already made their minds up.
---
You are wrong
---
What I find very interesting, is that prior to May of 2016. You can very easily see a correlation between PVP kills and PVE kills in the data, with spikes in PVP kills directly relating to despikes in PVE kills. After May of 2016, PVP kills generally go on a downward trend (with a small spike around January of 2017 with TEST etc. moving down south), and PVE kills seem to no longer have any correlation with PVP kills anymore.
---
While we are at it can we end the discrimination against angel caps
---
Does ESI have some historical data endpoints I didn't notice?  Just wondering where the source data is from/if it's available.
---
&gt;I don't work in development
---
Tell your cowerkers who do to come look at this thread, not specifically for the ideas, but with a more expansive viewpoint, to see how *excited* people are about the game again.  Since when do you see people with playful jokes and not shitting all over other people's ideas on an /r/Eve thread?  It's been years for me.
---
You guys did this, and it's _AWESOME_.  You should be proud.
---
I don't care about bots, I care about ccp pretending they actually monitored what happened. You can't make an educated decision like this off extremely limited data. They have 14 years worth of data on how it works with local and 5 days of no local and thats apparently enough to claim they actually gave a shit.
---
whats that in delve time units?
---
The number of "I'm resubbing for the first time since..." posts I've seen will counter out your sub cancellation, sorry. If you aren't satisified, you can voice your opinion with your wallet in this instance and state it on the forums/Reddit.  
---
People either love this change or hate it. Can't please everyone. 
---
Sounds like this is here to indefinitely.
---
Personally I resubbed, did some explo and felt no stress at all vOv. Instead of worrying about who popped up in local I just reacted to what was in space with me.
---
YES!
---
I think the amarr butcher's bill was cheaper this time around. Lost more BS but no caps. Last time we lost 2 faxes. The BS are a lot more insurable.
---
Dunno what we're gonna do about the nightmares though, we can't fund handing out ships that expensive. Especially when a lot of our guys have to offline a gun due to fitting. I don't even what to know how many flew Baddons' with Amarr BS 1 and no armor comp skills or even offline hardeners.
---
I agree... But then I dont think a navy maulus fits the bill... I see it as a dedicated fleet tackler
---
 I don't think any dread should be able to survive against 7 dreks and 4 bhaalgorns
---
That's an in character news piece, no one has released any information saying this would be forever.
---
It's a test, we're still collecting data, and it's far too early to say if this is going to be permanent.
---
Might want to unrustle your jimmies for a while there bud.
---
Delayed chat. You don't show up for 1-10 minutes based on whatever they choose. In 1 minute of me not showing up in local, I for sure can catch a bot.
---
from  [http://evemaps.dotlan.net/stats](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/stats)
---
Or... the data was so staggeringly evident that they unanimously decided to implement it immediately?
---
What's wrong with free stuff?

Totally not who people were complaining much about.

You hunt explorers and miners... and are telling me to man up. nice. :)

Eve is long past the point where sp is a limiting factor. The faster newbies can catch up the better.

there used to be a time that 1 euro 1.40 pounds, and that translated 29 pounds = 39 euro, but for some reason either ccp forgot to scale up or scale down the prices. also what are you doing in /r/eve if you dont like bitching
---
Alt account proliferation, botting, and the efficiency of goons.  Should overlay major battles on this too.  
---
Also were you on the CSM when that happened?
---
Play and find out. It's possible that you may never experience the things that make you hesitant. It's also possible that you may enjoy the things that make you hesitant.
---
So tell me who will warp indefinetely to site and do the same move pattern as before ? I dont know about you, but I do think it is a bot :)))
---
and what effects does that hole have? ships and weapons behave very differently depending on the WH effect
---
Thejoke.png
---
Ya 2000 less online for the entire duration, I am sure that data looks great.
---
You've hit it exactly on the nail. I don't mind risk. I do mind that a few bombers can blow up a multitude in value with no possible counter.
---
No local makes some playstyle to easy and make it nearly risk free which is never good for any game. 
---
Don't get me wrong, the risk/reward in null was completely wrong pre blackout, but this isn't the solution.

Ahh, thanks!

You spend a lot of time traveling, so warp speed rigs and the istab are a huge improvement - both for quality of life and for warping around to get warpins, cyno spots, probing, etc. The tank is enough with heat to last long enough, in my experience, but somewhat light.

/r/titlegore
---
How does on get the BPC for such a ship?
---
This is a good idea. Not the WH part cause fkem:)
---
But most def, this is something that I doubt anyone would argue against.
---
I mean that is great and all but you can't have game changing mechanics every single time. 
---
But I will say next step. Remove asset safety from null. Loot drops if citadel is killed. EASILY written into the lore as it being to unsafe for these operations to be taking place in null sec regions.
---
yeah but they *didn't want those structures* anyways, remember?
---
rip my subs, i guess
---
&gt;Not leaving local open so you can enjoy the salt and shitpost in local 
---
You're a very kind soul
---
A damage mod is not considered a large fitting burden, even on a frigate. The claim that WCS are balanced by being hard to fit is absolute crap.
---
Keep blackout forever.  NO LOCAL EVER.
---
That's precisely why they are doing what they are doing. Because they give a shit. Nullbears and bots easy isk farming driving the game right in the ground. If you need local that bad, you still got it in low-sec and high-sec.
---
Your flair played it too straight for me.
---
if you really had that many accounts you would prove it by sending 1.1B isk to me
---
This honestly gave me a feeling Ive not felt in EVE since 2005. Fear and uncertainty. When you jump through a gate, come out the other side and hear that gate jump sound. OH FUCK IT BETTER BE FRIENDLY! WARP YOU PIECE OF SHIT WARRRP!!
---
I think it is too early to really tell but I do agree that reddit seems to be amplifying those who are in favor of it. 
---
Based on reddit posts, i am in the minority: a pvp player who does NOT like the change. I am open minded enough that I am still giving it a chance but the first couple days haven't been very exciting. The fleets I've been in got no content, but based on zkill that may have been just bad luck. 
---
I learned how to fly in low sec, and then null sec, where actions were based on a combination of intel from local and dscan, so i feel kind of blind looking for content. 
---
I like the idea of wormholes having no local, it makes going there a novelty, so I don't think it should spread to other places. I also think it works better on a smaller scale, like in wormholes - so maybe if it was just restricted to certain constellations like where drifters are attacking.
---
bitching about people bitching, what else?
---
CCP please stop with this drip feed of lore news for a major change, its pissing off a lot of people.
---
Not saying we need every detail but some indication of the final state would be nice.
---
Just might do that, so far I've spent on mining, frigate, destroyer, and drones.
---
Well the radio silence on two massive nullsec changes it not very community friendly, and how else are players supposed to take this announcement? Now with your post we can glean some information, but by reading this thread you can tell everyone assumed this was an official update.
---
I'd like to point out that cyno jammers now are more difficult for the residents than they are for the attacking force, since it's easily countered by the 40+ Loki+bombers and recons fleet, and then the cyno jammer only impedes the response fleet.
---
I'm sorry that I didn't get my point across better.  I could have embraced a change like this if I had been given a chance to be invested in it, and if the "free intel" board was going to be wiped clean.  Instead I feel like I got a big "f\*ck you welcome to your new life as a victim".
---
I could have literally joined almost any nullsec entity in the game.  I could have been an F1 pusher in a big null block blue donut with a supercap umbrella, if I chose to.  I don't like that game play, I agree that dropping an overpowered response capital fleet on anything that moves is not good mechanics and I'm not defending that at all.  On the other side of that coin, Inner Hell, TISHU, Skil Urself, and other similar groups bringing lots of heat and/or fishing for escalations is who taught null entities to group up under umbrellas.  This change will only hasten that.   I preferred to be in a small active alliance and I see no place for me in this new system.
---
Losing all your shit is an even bigger sink.
---
That's not really what I've been pushing, though. IMO asset safety should be changed to
---
1. Never ever be an NPC hauling fairy. No voluntary safety to lowsec, ever.
---
2. When a structure is destroyed, each item should be given a 20% change to go into a loot bin. Once there, the loot goes through the normal drop/destroyed process. People who kill structures get something for the week+ it takes to kill them leading to fewer structures overall (I hope).
---
Right now, you can asset safety your moon goo or exploration drops to lowsec. You don't have to worry about dying to gatecamps and hauling in lowsec is laughably safe for anyone who learns to do it right. You can even use asset safety to kill someone in null and use THEIR structure to move the booty you picked from their wreck.
---
I prefer to have some risk in the dangerous parts of space instead of having everything 100% protected.
---
If the MER shows a drop then that will be great for the game. A drop in production alongside less ratting isk being generated will push us finally into a deflationary economy which will be amazing, especially with the increased destruction happening. What nullbears don't realise is this kind of economy makes all human PVE activity in null increase in value. To give an example, when i first started playing a plex was 300m, and haven ratting was worth the same as it is now. That means it only took 3 and a bit hours of afk ratting to make a months plex. Now it takes about 30 hours. If we move to a lower MER then we will enter a deflationary economy and start moving back to 300m plex
---
Read the prior sentence.
---
Yes yes and yes. Since bots dont care about human needs they will always scan reliably and it will be worse than before. And logoff traps only works if they dont constantly use the bots, which they will and do. Bots dont have human needs like sleeping.
---
But people dont care about these things.
---
You’re right that one solo kill is nbd, but that doesn’t mean we’ve forgotten our first one. It’s a big milestone. Congrats!
---
Looking at one weekend and judge the whole event is retarded. 
---
People are careful when new stuff is added, just give it a few days and people will log in their alts and go back to mining. Everyone knew everyone would be out hunting this weekend, thats not a good time to turbokrab
---
By the looks of it it's obvious there's going to be some upwell local chat structures. What I would like to see is a deployable object that can jam those structures (along the line of a cyno inhib or anchorable bubble).
---
Yea but then the caps are vulnerable while moving
---
\#facepalm
---
I'll google that.. is it a common terminology for the golden 15?
---
You are correct, but there's more value in it than just making botting harder.
---
By the account of you? Where are you pulling this data from?
---
Maybe the majority of that was alt accounts but unique accounts were up? I don't know, but I know you sure as hell don't either.
---
balcans pay with euro whether they are in the eurozone or not
---
Seriously. That’s bigger news than the permanent blackout.
---
It's pretty idiotic.
---
The biggest issues with the game:
---
1. Lack of content.
---
2. Structure spamming.
---
3. Capital proliferation.
---
.. which one of those things does the blackout fix? It's definitely not 2 or 3. Does it really fix 1 though?
---
I'd wager it doesn't. I'm part of a small gang that roams NPC null. We haven't seen an uptick in content. It's business as usual at best.
---
I'd argue a small, but vocal minority loves this change, but most people don't. Most people want to play safe. It's why we stopped having content before -- not because of local.
---
People check local, zkill, dotlan, etc.. before doing anything. Getting rid of those tools isn't going to make people start playing more. It's going to make them play less. If people wanted to play dangerously, they'd have moved to WHs years ago instead of staying in null.
---
if my quick on dscan what?
---
Please tell that you are considering delaying the killmails on ESI and removing most of the informations from there like public timers and system informations. 
---
Thx.
---
I wonder what happened in April-May 2016??  (J/K, I know it was WWB.)
---
Then there was the drop off in the last few months.  Goon moving to take on NC.?  bot bans?  Both?
---
Too Bad July isn't over.  I think the WWB curve will be the same,. 
---
 For the last few days for sure.
---
But wouldn't that still provide the intel? If the person is offline you still get that 'offline pilot' window, whereas an auto-reject wouldn't create it.
---
Ehhh no RF is pretty brutal. Give it a single timer but make it non functional while it’s reinforced, like other current structures
---
polo
---
Worse, I see a steady downwards trend.  And no war spikes.
---
bye
---
remove local forever thanks in advance
---
We were spitballing in another thread that you may or may not have seen after suitonia suggested 5m cyno cycles.  What if we attacked the cyno itself and not the effect?  Oppressive fitting requirements or fit cyno == polarized resists and/or fit cyno == disables jump drive on jump capable ships?
---
And no supers in low would be incredible as well as covert JF, think of the opportunities to go live in those currently uninhabited corners!
---
This is the response needed in every “blackout is dumb, I’m unsubbing X accounts” shitposts that are plaguing this sub right now
---
lmao adapt or die
---
YAASSSS!!
---
Goons deployed in May, which made Delve far less secure to super/carrier rat in, and their deployment into Tribute also prevented NC. and their renters from super ratting around Tribute area too most likely.
---
&gt; the rest is on the aggressor.  
---
Pretty much my point. Everything is on the aggressor. Yes, WCS isn't a perfect get-out-of-gaol-free card, I'm not claiming it is. Bubbles and HICs always win over them. But in situations where a WCS does win, it does the winning all by itself without any effort from the pilot. 
---
That's what makes them poorly designed from a gameplay perspective.
---
My point which I think I failed to communicate very well, was that this change could have been embraced by all sides if it had been sold better, and was a little bit more fair.  I tried to point out that just popping it out there with literally one week notice, not a word from the CSM (for all we know they didn't even have any input on this, if they had I would have hoped *somebody* would have raised the issues from my point #3) makes it feel like one part of the community is being preferred over another part, and that's going to create hard feelings.  Instead of trading player count for better content, I would have said "let's engage the community to participate in and be invested in this change, and have both."
---
on the top of my head the only thing I can find is killing the people who don't bot, making them wish they did :S
---
Oh dear god. With CCPs track record they will be uber OP.
---
I know reddit will make you think otherwise, but most players aren't actually in null sec, and most people who are in null sec aren't bots. 
---
Blaming this pretty significant drop on bots is stupid as fuck.
---
I think you should take a breath, its a change in the game like it or not your not the one running it.
---
welcome to the darkside =\] gj tho man, ive been playing this game for a long long looooooong time, but solo is where its sat. nothing compares to the excitement of killing someone else alone without backup.
---
He was actually trying to PVP with a fit like that? 
---
Wow.

---
His subscription wouldn't have been mentioned if he hadn't tried to use it to lend weight to his argument. If he wants to use his 6 months of subscription over a 9 year period as part of his argument the scope of his sub is open to scrutiny.
---
Just no.  You want lots of little resourec faucets teasing things out slowly if you want them to spreadout.  If the Yield grows and respawn even more so, you will only get things like Locust fleet, but magnified exponentially.
---
The Umbrella can move more easily than it can grow.  (Though some wizards at CCP have fucked with that as well with no-fatigue jump bridges.)
---
Where did you get the info for ship kill? Zkill or you use the true sourth of truth ?
---
Didi you take the quality of ship to and average number of years of player in game (that important). 
---
And average 0.0 population ?
---
What records have we broken mate; logins at peak over this weekend were 2.5k average lower than the weekend before.
---
it's OK you can tell us it'll be forever and that the observatories will only give you count, not member list
---
You need low sec for jf routes. I like banning supers in low. I'd be all over that.
---
They've been on a downward trend since the start of 2017, with not as much fluctuation as previously was seen.
---
&gt;then come across others who want to force you into their style...  
---
&gt;  ...'elite pvpers' rarely go after armed combat ships... 
---
I take it while you disapprove of telling others how to play, you are happy to make wildly sweeping inaccurate statements. Bias such as yours is what gives nullbears a bad name.
---
It will offset the cancelation of my alt 👍
---
I'd find that interesting too. It's quite a departure from the status quo. 
---
But so is Blackout.
---
Risk vs reward remember. Where is the reward with equal risk towards wormhole? Might aswell abandon null all together and move wormhole space where rewards are far greater for equal the risk.
---
Yes, because this is currently still an 'event'. It's literally been out for 3 days and every post on reddit is screaming to make it permanent. It may be fun now, but it's because everyone is trying it. I'm a lowsec noon pvper and I'm still trying to find fights despite sucking. Remember how everyone hailed Warlords of Draenor the best expansion ever and in a month everyone despised it? Try​ to think about who this blackout affects and the long term effects.
---
You're dumb.
---
I'm just reading, "You need to release patch notes first, otherwise our theorycrafters can't figure out how to minmax the situation for our own gain"
---
Do month, see how it goes. Evaluate your estimated interest period, sub for that amount.
---
That's my bet. \*Waits for Null Intel array structures\*
---
To be fair changing local has been discussed to death since 2003 and "engaging the community" would have stirred up the same arguments on both sides that we've all heard a thousand times before. I don't think there's any other change in the history of the game that's been argued about as much as removing local.
---
If you need 2.9 mexallon to produce something and you only produce one you need 3. The game rounds up to full numbers in this case. This makes kinda sense if you think about it. If you now produce 10 you indeed need the 2.9 mexalllon per ammo which leads to 29 overall. you can play around with that stuff on https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/blueprint/?typeid=241
---
You cannot use less than one unit of something per one thing you produce though. Let's assume you needed 0.9 mexallon each. Then you'd still need 10 mexallon to produce 10 end items.
---
Null sand castle builders have gotten literally nothing but buffs for the last 4 years. The game was choking to death from the stagnant air and CCp have finally had their hand forced to make a change. Rorqs, citidels, the capital buff, adms, fatigue, literally every change has buffed nullbears who drop supers on roaming solo frigs, never go on comms, krab all day and inject rorqs, breathe through their mouths and drag their knuckles. Theres so many other places you can go play with local. Why not move there? Chat channels should not act as the most vital perfect intel in the game
---
A short term drop in players was expected.  Only the stupid rorquals and ratters are out right now.
---
That's why the "indefinitely" thing is important.  It tells the rorquals they can't just wait it out.
---
Also "indefinitely" and "forever" mean slightly different things.
---
I have to wonder what the re-sub numbers are once this change came in. How many people actually wanted to see this to make things more of a challenger for hunters and targets.
---
This man gets it.

---
I predict a lot of alphas in the near future. I’m not one of those. However I would like to see some middle grounds considered. Like the idea of how many people are in local, just not who or the ability to see a person’s Corp ticker on dscan. Structures seem....to defeat the purpose to black out in the first place.
---
Its content man. Ask everyone else but the guy with the Vendetta if they had fun.
---
Then go out on a roam and see what it's like for yourself mate. The bots have little to do with it, they're just temporarily inconvenienced. 
---
The fun is in everyone having imperfect intel, roaming through systems, checking to see if that ship on d-scan is friend or foe, committing to a fight even when you don't know exactly what system that gang you passed 5 minutes ago is in, because they likely don't know where you are either. 
---
It's not easy to boil down and explain, but it adds a lot to the game and I haven't had this much fun playing in ages. 
---
We're even ratting and mining, few dudes on standby incase someone comes in for a gank and getting fun that way while still making a profit.
---
I like this one.
---
Numbers would be fine but hide the pilot names. Just up the paranoia factor a little bit more.
---
A short term drop in players is expected. This is a long term decision for the health of the game.  Only the stupid rorquals and ratters are out right now.
---
That's why the "indefinitely" thing is important. It tells the rorquals they can't just wait it out.
---
Do you have proof it was more active?
---
&gt; Instead I feel like I got a big "f*ck you welcome to your new life as a victim".
---
As a small gang dude who hunts in null, this has been the past 4+ years of changes from CCP. Welcome to our world.
---
\^\^ this sums it up perfectly, same deal here 90% of my in game activity is small gang roaming, and all it is now is wasting more time than its worth looking through empty systems just in case there is something there and more often than not its just pos'd up supers
---
That's not a middle ground.  If local spikes, you react.
---
We'll see how things go in a month of this.
---
Blackout prob makes a difference but I doubt he was impossible to catch before. Not the first time a Vendetta has gatecamped in Delve.
---
You're dumb, and bitter.
---
why would you cancel your minimum 30 day subscription for a weekend event?
---
 [http://evemaps.dotlan.net/stats](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/stats)   
---
The figures are from the historical stats from Dotlan. 
---
[https://i.imgur.com/YaizM59.png](https://i.imgur.com/YaizM59.png) Here is another one with jumps included. I think jumps is a good metric to show nullsec population and traffic throughout nullsec. As you can see, Jumps is directly correlated to PVP, where as PVE becomes uncorrelated to both jumps and PVP after may of 2016.
---
As a wormholer; WH space is just too predictable; static wormholes are predictable, the maximum mass is predictable, EOL timers are predictable, sleepers are predictable, even PvP activity can be predicted fairly accurately based on the amount of open connections of the WH system. This means that when your corp is using something like pathfinder or tripwire properly, there are almost never any real suprises.
---
I've only been playing Eve for 1,5 months, and living in WH space for only 2 weeks. I remember thinking Jspace was this crazy dangerous place, but in reality its just a chill safe space away from the nullbears, with occasional fun small scale PvP.
---
The solution is pretty clear though, and not nearly as extreme as all the stuf posted so far, just change some of the numbers. Make the EOL timers a bit more random, or the mass limits a bit more random, or reduce the amount of statics while increasing the roaming WH's. Small step by step changes could be made to make Jspace really fucking cool, because the core concept of how it works is dope AF already, it just need a bit more tuning.
---
Embrace your Thanos moment, in-character.
---
You should really consider making a safe spot that's out of alignment with any planet. Otherwise, if I'm camping the wormhole and I see where you have warped out to, all I need to do is to place a bubble in-between your path and the wormhole and it becomes very easy for me to catch you. See [this](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Safe_spots#How_to_create_a_static_safe_spot). It makes it easier to find you if you're uncloaked for some reason (such as when using a mobile depot)
---
For the 2 stabs, it can be a good idea, but you're dropping a lot of tank or agility for this. It pretty much eliminates in Astero v Astero pvp you might want to do. It's also vulnerable against dual-scram (which I personally run a lot to catch people who think they are safe with warp core stabs). But I guess you would've been toast if I caught you anyways. If you want, you could carry a mobile depot and your normal lows. If you spot an Astero, you could go in the next system over, drop a mobile depot and refit into pvp gear.
---
Pretty much to escape bubble camps, although I'm pretty sure you won't see a hs bubble camp though, unless they've got an overwhelming force that can blap you off instantly.
---
Of course not, only CCP does. But as someone who has been roaming null for over a decade, this weekend was one of the most active times  since the ~2016 era where small gang died.
---
I don't care about the change, while I do think it's awful that's not the point of that post. The point is CCP pretended they would evaluate the situation and then made a decision after 5 days. That's not nearly enough time to make that size of a choice. And now we see they had lore events ready to go supporting making the change permanent which further implies they didn't care what the results were and intended to move forward. It wasnt until I literally called out falcon that we learned that this wasn't actually forever, but just worded in such a way that implied it.
---
Sounds like only npc null. All of those groups control regions of nullsec (ORE is owned by the serpentis)
---
Guess how many of the logged off were bots
---
If you know that its “not actually forever” than why continue to argue?
---
I roamed null in small-medium fleets quite a bit on the weekend.  We got some good kills, and it certainly makes null more exciting, placing great emphasis in quality scouting.  But it was also noticeable how certain tracts of space were a bit quieter than usual.  That might be partially down to the "summer lull", as well as the grand experiment.   And  (via a friend), Sunday afternoon in Period Basis, there was very little activity at all, but it's pretty carebear down there a lot of the time.

zkill
---
https://eve-offline.net/?server=Tranquility see for yourself.
---
&gt; What records
---
lowest concurrent login count on Sunday since December 31st 2006
---
In fact dotlan data ar enot the best data. 
---
Every month during MER CCP release raw data of the previous month. If you want go deep in analysis it's a lot more better than dotlan/zkill.
---
My play style is the same as yours, yet I think the blackout is great. I feel local damages the game experience, in what other sci-Fi universe would a little pop up window with the names and faces of the people flying incredibly advanced machinery not seem silly? Could you imagine if captain kirk arrived in a solar system and, for what is essentially Facebook messenger in space, to see a little box fill up with the names and faces of a few hundred Klingons?
---
If you’re finding it stressful, my guess is that you can’t afford to lose your stratios, When I first bought an astero I became really risk averse as I was unable to replace it. I docked up and went back to flying t1 frigates for a few months. When I had a bit more experience/isk I switched back.
---
Even without local I feel incredibly safe, CovOps cloak, low align time and warp core stabilisers means I can survive fairly easily.  Ive been chased by hunters twice in the past two weeks and survived both encounters by being prepared. I simply used the advice of more experienced players, such as the mwd cloak trick. 
---
Also there are a lot of players in eve with different play styles, just because no local isn’t what you want, doesn’t make it a bad game decision. Null is meant to be dangerous and the designers have to look at the bigger picture.
---
Why didn't you adapt or die before this change?
---
Reeee im away those days
---
feels bad man
---
I agree that the economy is all screwed up, but your example of time spent vs plex cost is probably one of the worst oversimplifications of a complex issue that I've ever seen.  There are a ton of factors impacting the cost of plex, not the least of which is CCP making them into a currency that can buy more than just game time.  I'm also sure that declining player participation has something to do with a decrease in the supply of plex in the game, as fewer people are willing to shell out cash for in game currency.
---
The game is only inflationary right now when it comes to a few very narrow categories like plex.  The cost of T1 ship hulls, including all capitals, is down across the board due to a fall in mineral prices.  I was working on an analysis of why capital prices have fallen so much, and what I discovered is that mining enormous anoms to completion over and over with masses of afk Rorquals (the popular scapegoat) is likely NOT the culprit.  Almost all of the decrease in the cost of building T1 ships has been the absolute crash in the prices of megacyte and zydrine, and I'm absolutely *sure* that has nothing at all to do with all the ABC ore sources that CCP introduced into the game with the moon mining change. (/s)
---
Or how about if you are going to make drastic changes maybe inform the community. Nah I'm sure trolling nullsec with drifters is much better.
---
only if rfing takes 10 minutes and they can't be in gun range of cities
---
Which doesnt work for all shiptypes? Listen, the other side of the fence can agree to changes, but remove cloaks and d-scan immunity. Are you willing to do that?
---
We're talking about someone who has spent 6 months of their 9 year eve existence (if we can call it that) in relative safety.
---
Nothing surprises me anymore.
---
You have a serious lack of information with dotlan.
---
What about become more serious and use raw data for this period (we have they). I think we could launch an analysis in principal component and try to find to who is correllated this uncorellation :p
---
Because until then that was all we had. Why the hell did it take me saying that for them to actually announce their intentions. Everyone assumed this meant it was forever.
---
Maybe because no one asked?
---
Show your work.
---
Indefinitely =/= forever
---
&gt; theres no significant increase in fights
---
I am the CEO of Brand Newbros.  We have pure PvP'ers, we have pure Krabs, and we have the majority that do a bit of both.  We live in our space.  Our corp has been non stop PvP'ing since blackout started.  Our krabs are baiting, our roamers are roaming and actually getting fights, and our comms are alive.
---
The corp had more fun this weekend than typical.  People logged on that I have not seen in months.  More people were on comms and more people were in space PvP'ing.  More people were having fun.  Less people were in the other games channel (0 at the time of my screenshot), more people were in fleet comems.  I even took a screenshot of mumble and saved it.
---
This guy should have listened to Rhiload, he said that dual rep incursus is useless.
---
&gt; rumor mongering 
---
it is true just look at eve-offline, the question is whether or not it actually means anything
---
Fking people and downvoting opinions that isnt in line with their. You bring up an excellent point, the paranoia will burn people out really really fast.
---
This so much, CCP you haven't told us anything.  The initial announcement was through the in game news, so you cant expect us to just ignore a new article that says its an indefinite.
---
Nope I think they are a good company. Have a shit job? Should have done better in school.
---
and local
---
Could it simply be that players were driven to buy super caps and Titans as requirements from their alliance leaders? 
---
I win = more caps. This is a result of the players need and greed.
---
At the moment it’s new and most people are pretty hyped. I think if it had happened say 3/4 years ago before super umberellas and the huge mega coalitions of today got organised it would be less warmly received. 
---
Ultimately for me it’s just a distraction and doesn’t change that the game is massively broken and my playstyle is dead, so I’ll not be resubbing once my accounts run out this year.
---
&gt; Blackout has been a big success

---
As a Lowseccer, I completely and 100% support blackout coming to lowsec.
---
He is free and can say whatever he wants, the damage distribution between those alts are telling me other thing. 
---
If you dont input, ALL of your alts will form a "ladder" in terms of damage. Every (N+1) alt will do a small damage above the N-th alt.
---
The top 3 damage dealers varied less than 0.5% in the damage. (These were probably inputed at the same tick). The top 5 damage variation is lower than 1.5% in average. I bet this is an input.
---
This will NEVER happen in a KM with low hp (a small ship). Things like this happen if you ARE NOT inputting but bashing a structure, maybe, even a titan (even this can be hard to do that very single vartion, since a very small well applied hit or a miss can do a massive difference for something with a Titan EHP).
---
it is an input.
---
It's a fitting tool you goddamn moron

 **"Maintained Indefinitely"**

Do you need a dictionary?  I think you do.

I'll take whaling t3cs for 500 Alex.
---
Just go to wormhole space why would this be the catalyst that makes you quit lol
---
Here Here Good Sir !!
---
In theory sure, but day to day living with it will make it a chore, not a game. People will simply stop doing it and when a large chunk of the game dies then it no longer matters what the spirit of eve was.
---
next big change should be limiting the posting abilities of some people
---
Everyone crying they will quit if local comes back should explore wormhole space.   Spoiler: no local
---
But they gave the other side an ever bigger crutch? No thoughts or complaints about that?
---
Good job space cowboy
---
we need more of this
---
&gt;instant free perfect intel
---
**Some** instant, free, perfect intel.  You're not at all upset about other sources of instant, free, perfect intel that remain.
---
Asset safety should never be removed ever.  It was one of the best things CCP did.  People playing for years losing years of assets was pretty terrible.  Never again
---
Let's see a reasoned argument that PCU has nothing to do with player participation.   Saying "it's literally a useless metric" is NOT a logical construct, by the way.  That's called that an "unsupported statement".
---
zKill, MER, etc are useful for seeing what kinds of activities are being done.  I see no way to separate PCU from player participation in the game.  Lower numbers mean fewer accounts are logging in which means fewer players in the game.  That's a drop in participation.
---
In reality i think after this date PVE and PVP stay correllated , but with a different factor.  We need go deeper in analysis than just said "its X or Y fault".
---
We did and now it's the krabs turn.
---
I don't buy your spiel about logoff traps. What is the bot gonna do, warp off &amp; dockup every time something appears on scan? If so, that's a huge nerf for bots. And if a bot goes back to ratting while you're in system watching the structure they're docked in, that is an unfathomably large nerf to bots.
---
It creates an incentive to be in smaller groups that aren't as noticeable at the same time. It forces larger alliances to spread out as you can keep track of local in small groups, but not when you have large amounts of people in local. At the same time, it gives some intel, but requires communication and coordination which are core fundamentals of an MMO. I'd call that middle ground.
---
This makes sense. It also leaves CCP the option for new structures since ORE is a member of Upwell anyway.
---
The list of blue corps in The Establishment remains... zero :D
---
It's not forever. Check falcon's comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cdm73l/blackout_now_forever/etv0aph/).
---
Reddit votes mean jackshit in the real world. Logins have dropped since black out and it's just hard fact. These losers only have reddit to circlejerk off in.
---
Thanks for these AAR's - enjoyable reading.
---
It's awesome to see U'K still active after all these years. I've flown alongside them on-and-off since 2006 and help them successfully defend, lose, re-take, and lose again 9UY.  Good memories. Your AAR's have made me think that perhaps it's time to join the fight for freedom once again!

---
And hands out puppies and hand jobs and gives killmarks on all my ships and super green killboards and gives me a warpin on all krabs in system when I hack it. 
---
Actually, that last one might have some merit.
---
&gt; This entire thing has only strengthened the large blocs and made it harder for people in smaller ships to engage with content in subcaps.
---
That doesn't seem to be my experience with it. I know it's just anecdotal, but we took out a small gang roam for about 5 hours on Friday night. Started in NSI, went down through Brave/test space and over to provi. Ran into multiple other groups, had 3 good brawls, ran from a bigger kiki fleet, and finally got bosoned in Delve after getting a few more frags.
---
All in all I saw a bunch of groups across all the regions we went through and it was one of the best roams we've had in ages.
---
You did realize that this wont solve any bot related issue right?
---
In fact this made the game 100% more secure for bots cause they are gone before you even knew they were there.
---
Do you have a data analyst in CCP office ? FOR REAL ?
---
Price has not been changed since Uk pound droped in value. your mate is getting a good deal. The only thing this post will do is fuck your mate over. CCP need to up his price.
---
P.s Shut your fucking mouth before you cost me an extra £5 &lt;3
---
You can fly incursions and earn over 100mil ISK/h as an sufficiently trained alpha, alternatively do wh / nullsec exploration
---
Thats gotta be the least thought through roleplay news article in CCPs history
---
It would make stuff quite a bit more expensive when using throwaway cynos as you do, but not the end of the world I guess. 
---
Especially if local stays as it is now allowing CCP to boost nullsec pve rewards due to it not longer being a risk-free activity.
---
The current CSM might not have any input, but the previous CSM probably did. As u/kristallnachte said, we'll have to see how it affects player numbers longer term. How active will Eve be in a month? If we're still breaking "low player count" numbers, then you may be right. This weekend (and maybe next weekend) is probably going to be the biggest hunting weekend in forever so it makes a lot of sense for farmers not to log in. If the blackout is here to stay, though, people will adapt, sunk cost fallacy and all that.
---
We'll see how this plays out in a month, it will be the big decider.
---
&lt;3 Carebears. Never change please, the salt is tasty.
---
Lol, whos gonna populate NS when all your theoretical bs kills off the existing playerbase? Do you even know how much work alliances put into sov stuff? And you think it should be more hardcore. Lool loool loool.
---
Congratulations, the first solo kill is an experience to remember. There are many things to say about the experience, but Jebi said it better.

Ooooor i can also pay 30 euro per account and i spend 150 instead of 200 \0/
---
Great responses, even though i dont agree with a few of them.
---
Thank you for your interest of trying to making eve better every day.
---
We wont forget it!
---
ps: remove rorquals tomorrow, please! :D
---
I don't see that, it might be a regional thing.
---
Which is a whole 'nother load of BS in and of itself.
---
Well we have asked about drifters but who knows if those will start randomly killing supers. It would be nice to know these things without having to call out falcon and being told I'm mad.
---
won't be missed
---
Is there any way for a US customer to redeem this?
---
Whoa. Is there a limit on how much can be farmed from the trigs? That seems... fucking crazy if not
---
You're so dense you don't see the irony in those two sentences.
---
How about you stop moving the goal posts?
---
yeah there are lotso stuff to do for ultimate maemaes
---
My prediction is basically a spike in activity, and then people will learn to use run anoms in tanked supers while in coms.  Alternatively mine in Rorqs while in coms.  The ones who do not will be farmed to death.  
---
Any fleet big enough in jump range to seriously threaten a super under a super umbrella will be known thanks to spies regardless of local.
---
The ones who can't fly a Super or Rorq need to do something other than rat or mine to make isk in null, like buy plex and boosters to get into a super or rorq, or better yet go do wormholes with a competent group.  Wormholes which are basically safer than null if the hole is properly ragerolled as there is no hot drop threat while making quite a few times the isk.
---
The end result will be good luck trying to kill a properly fit super or rorq that is in coms, in an alliance with a semi decent spy network, and is under a friendly super umbrella.
---
As you can see in this thread I am getting roasted for wanting that.
---
/r/agedlikemilk
---
"give me karma"
---
But jf you did, then people wouldn't have been mad there was local, you would have adapted and used it.
---
For once I agree with the man. Never change
---
\*Laughs\*
---
I love the news being issued via lore. THIS IS GREAT! Please keep it coming CCP!
---
Wtf is that?!?!
---
I don't see PvP kills on a downward trend.  The trend looks pretty flat to me.  The other thing is true though.  Definitely lost any correlation with PvE.
---
Ya I haven't killed an NPC for 7 years or mined a rock for 3 so not sure how that makes me a carebear.
---
And while I'm annoyed with the local change my point in my post wasn't about the change. My point was ccp pretending to actually care about how the test went and as if they didn't already have their mind made up.
---
Use teamviewer from your phone.
---
Verone!  I had no idea this was you!  I was in Veto for a short time when when you were mercs.  What a great time! Do you still have the flaming toboggan?
---
Have you ever heard of jump cloning to hisec?
---
I straight up love the fact that ccp is making announcements and teasing features through the lore. The build up to the invasion expansion has been the best thing CCP have done lore-wise since I started playing. Long may it continue.
---
Black out protest. Look at the killing blow pilot.
---
I mean, define "vulnerable". They're as vulnerable as a cap ball can be, which is: not very.
---
A corpie of mine just pointed out, how it's the factions of NPC null space that are talking about the predicted observatories. Is it possible NPC Null will have local? (Yet sov null remains local-less)
---
The blackout being good/bad is entirely subjective. I assure you that for douchebags who can never find ganking indys and carrier ratters easy enough, they like it. 
---
I know it's difficult for you assholes to accept the fact that not everyone wants to play in your world of 'elite pvpers vs people who want to just pve' but the majority of players are against the blackout. 
---
Who are you going to pick on once you drive the pve'ers away? You sure as shit won't fight each other, being both combat fit.
---
&gt;Besides the fact that was half of my ISK, what did I do wrong and what should I be doing?
---
That's your main issue. Rule #1 of EVE is that you do not fly what you cannot afford to lose. Getting good at PvP takes a lot of time, effort, practice, and losing ships.
---
Every solar system in the game gets a star in the skybox. The direction of the stars in the skybox always correspond to their location on the map.
---
Stargates point in the direction of their destination as seen in the skybox and jump animations from jump drives and bridges are visibly pointed towards their destination star as well. Scouts will often cross reference the direction with a map of active cynos to determine where a hostile fleet has jumped to.
---
Nebulae are actually dynamic objects as well. They have fixed positions on the star map and as you move closer they start appearing in the distance, getting bigger and bigger until they surround you.
---
What I'm saying is that the skybox is actually way cooler than most people know.
---
Chockepoints are not a problem to me. I Have 30+ spread neutral cyno alts in lowsec (where i live) and the null borders of those lowsec.
---
The problem is that i will never now which of those alts are my exit route because, well, could be a 50+ gang on that system and i have no idea.
---
I am already risking big shit by doing this, every time i undock. Now, it will be a total madness to do this. I just dont want to lose this ship for a fleet of F1 monkeys with their dreads/super blob. Kill it by doing better stuff than i could do, not by just a bunch of F1 monkeys.
---
This would give some kind of RNG to the game, its not about player skills anymore.
---
And no, i dont want to join another group of 3k+ members to keep living there. This kind of meta that took eve a few years ago is literally killing it, by making only major nullblocs living out of hsec.
---
This defender advantage timer warfare garbage needs to die in a fire. It needs to be "hey we're shooting your shit, put up or shut up" for these auxiliary structures. Keep timers for the things you actually live out of. The "nice to have, but not necessary" things need to be single cycle kill mail generators. 
---
Lower the damage cap so they are harder to kill and the defender has time to form for it. But the defender shouldn't have 24-36 hours to form up and drive 2 regions over to defend a structure that is "nice to have"
---
I would love to hear the story behind the madness that led to these specific modules being fit on this space vessel.
---
Combat recons are going to be very scary for the bots if you think dscan will solve the absence of local.
---
The main problem I'm seeing in the future is the smaller ships gradually thinning out in Nullsec. People start moving into Carriers and Supercaps.
---
And then the point of entry for Nullsec will become 'can you sit in a capital ship?' because the hassle of supporting a subcap pilot with a supercap umbrella is simply not feasable.
---
Why does he have tracking computers in the mids??
---
How many kills?
---
Would you like the game to come with a leash to walk you around and tell you everything or would you like some unknown parts about the game and some actual risk every now and than?
---
If you leave EVE and keep all your stuff in Upwell structures instead of just moving them out, you deserve to lose your shit.
---
Ships fitted with stabs have no intention of fighting anyway so the current penalties mean nothing.
---
Well, once again the thoughts of a wormholer. I wont even respond to most of what youve written but I will take the time to adress your bait-tanked VNI in Insmother. That isnt no local, thats TESTs war against FRT. Those have been around for a while and if you actually tried to hunt instead of bitch about how hunts are hard, you would have known this.
---
I would also like to mention that theres barely anything to hunt in those regions since the blackout which has made it immensely boring, much much worse than before.
---
So it might be great for a visitor, but for the people actually living in these areas its become suuuuper boring.
---
This post was made by capitalism gang.
---
Wow, great strategy.
---
Let me spam 10 structures in this region TO ME because i fuckni want to move a super.
---
Yeah, eve is great with that. We already dont have a structure spam anyway.
---
Great solution.
---
ELI5 how it died to 12 damage...
---
Eh it's not about people leaving at all..this was about when hundreds of players lost all their shit when people used to lose stations and when idiots flipped over sov. That's wasnt right not fair
---
Or someone with a brain. Can’t tell the two apart.
---
self destructed
---
Call me crazy, but if your hauling something, why not have some Corp members come with you and have them as your counter
---
God bless Hilmar.
---
Damn what a tease...
---
I dont think it's a bad thing and hell, I'm a Goon.
---
What is a bad thing is how mindblowing this has been for so many people. In reality this is not a large change but we are so starved for new content for so long this was enough to blow our socks off.
---
I think that's the real issue.
---
I volunteer as tribute
---
I suspect that was mostly caused by legacy vs winterco (and friends both sides) war. It was reported that winterco alone had \~1600 players on field, legacy wasnt far off.
---
In terms of future money gained though we are entirely equal. Next month they stand to gain the same amount from both of us. They have already spent your $600 and my $90 lol.
---
You seem to have put a lot of effort and time into your thorough explanation, and it is laudable that you've given such a fleshed out description of your perspective, but I really could not disagree with you more.

The question of whether nullsec is more or less dangerous than j-space is neither here nor there. Deep null is too safe, period.  Its destroying the economy of the game and encouraging botting at an unprecedented scale. You seem to be familiar with statements made by devs and community leaders about this change, and why it is good for the pvp oriented playerbase of the game, which was dying a slow death through tedious unsatisfying boredom.  If your involvement in your pvp alliance was really as multifacted as you have described, you should understand this too.  
---
If this change is just too damaging to your playstyle for you to enjoy the game, then leave and play something more forgiving.
---
Otherwise, it really is actually time to harden the fuck up.
---
PvE-oriented players in null really are going to have to make an effort _adapt_ to these changes to avoid feeding.  
---
No one owes you an apology for this.  The pvpers that remain in eve stayed through the introduction of skill injectors, PANIC modules, upwell cyno jammers, and much, much more. They stuck it out and dealt with it. If you want to keep playing the game, you're going to need to deal with this new challenge, just like they did.
---
When the big, powerful ships are more mobile than the small, faster ships, the latter become obsolete.
---
Removing jump drives from combat capitals would make employing them require a larger time investment and a larger degree of risk, which seems appropriate for the level of power they bring to the field.
---
If you want to strike fast and nowhere without warning, your best option shouldn't be the biggest ships in your arsenal.
---
....biggest ships in your arse....
---
Hi, my name is Galactus, and that Avatar pilot stole my buttplug. CCP halp
---
No but visual you rocket brain.
---
Ho and have a Look at various other mmos and how bots there operate by sight in order to perform dodge patterns and youll learn something
---
These bots ( if written properly) are 10 steps ahead of you
---
One giant ass protest. Warp core stabs and a final blow pilot called skrew DaBlackout
---
If I remember correctly your static being crit isn’t an exact science, although pretty accurate. You still have somewhat of rng for the mass, yes it will be within 100k or so which could be life or death. A few destroyers and some frigs can boosh your tinker rattles and defang you surprisingly quick. 
---
    ALWAYS, ALWAYS!! Have a scout on the crit and always spam D-scan.
---
you mean the pcu that's been inflated with bots dropped off as soon as 90% of bots became unviable overnight?
---
oh nooooooo
---
Ya, it was one of the best times ive had in LS, to your guys credit for a while y'all just kept coming back, and after each brawl more LS groups threw in. It was a lot of fun.
---
Trust me, i have lost plenty of ships even with the intel. I mean I'm not bleeding isk but it does happen from time to time. I don't mind the occasional gank, it happens. It just seems to me like they are taking away my tools leaving the experienced pvp'ers with the advantage here.
---
Took the coward's way out, eh?
---
Pussy.
---
Dibs on your stuff
---
The first ones the best! Now enjoy your addiction and descent into needing more :)
---
Yeah the vocal minority always win sadly.
---
The stupid thing is, I think it could be a great change but its impossible to tell with so little info.
---
&gt;They are threads from a couple years ago with people saying mining rorqs with panic would never catch on
---
there are significantly more relevant individuals predicting the current status quo accurately
---
reddit is full of thousands of people, each with their opinion. saying 'x said y and z' doesn't really matter if you're looking at the whole group, since every opinion is said
---
As a long time player and video creator of Eve (youtube: Toddfa), I support the idea to remove local indefinitely. I haven't had this much fun in Eve in a very long time and I hope it stays this way moving into the future. Please stand strong and call the bluff on those who wish otherwise. As you're well aware, those on "activity strike" are merely trying to wait you out. Their inaction in itself is toxic to Eve and is why we're in the situation we are now. The toxic minority scream the loudest with threats. Good day!
---
BB is public you know?
---
And it really does feel like you are mad that your small gang cant kill supers/titans. You were never supposed to do it without caps and some setup. 
---
Plus the latest tracking nerf makes the umbrella rather weak against subs. And its a hugely different thing to fix 2 shiptypes (which imo have already been fixed) than to fuck over entire NS.
---
This is actually a good idea. Put a min 60 minutes delay on the killmails. So it would obfuscate the tools that could power intel bots logging deaths on an ESI scope.
---
I am sure there are plenty of people on both sides of this coin. Those unsubbing and those subbing. It would be interesting if they would release those numbers after the test.
---
While we are at it let's make Wormholes not have the ability to anchor structures at all. They dont have local. They don't need customs offices. So to make it riskier than null sec, let's make it it on where you cant anchor anything.
---
The assets weren't lost, they were just trapped.
---
My crabs are gone till stuff goes back to normal. That's a dozen fewer rorqs, a couple smartbombing battleship fleets docked, a fleet of ded running blops ships retired, and a couple supers fewer to shoot at. I enjoyed varying my crabbing as much as i enjoy different levels of pvp. Theres something fun about producing or being able to produce nearly everything you use in pve and pvp.  Skill queues are loaded and I frankly don't care if subs run out on the crabs. I still have 4 to 6 accounts ill use occasionally when i have time to commit to pvp, but the various types of null crabbing were about half the game for me and something i could do on my own schedule. I'm trash at solo stuff, and ive tried, and failed alot. Camping, Small gangs, blops, and big block fleets are all my pvp now, which rely on other people or significant time to set up or travel to and from.  Nice thing about crabbing is i can dock up in 5 mins tops if i need to go. I suppose i can still super rat, but way to go ccp on making umbrella super ratting the only viable source of income and screwing any sort of sub cap crab action. I got a new guy to start playing and he's tried doing pve since this shit started and gotten nuked by drifters and blops groups a few times. I told him to dock up and i gave him isk to refund him and so he could go on alliance and corp fleets. He's defenceless against drifters and without local and doesn't have the resources to do anything outside his one subcal pilot. I lived in wormhole space and played with that no local autistic d scan spamming stress and risk for 6 years. Wasn't fun anymore so i moved to null. The changes also mean that i have fewer targets to shoot at with the accounts I'll bother to keep subbed... for a while. If blackout and drifter shit stays the same, well, my budget for CCP went from about $3,300 USD to $800 USD a year so I guess I should thank them for the extra $2,500 a year to invest, put towards that hellcat, or just go camping with. Thanks for finally trying to ween me off of an 11 year long addiction. I think this is probably the closest I've ever come to winning EVE.
---
Hopefully they'll say local is removed indefinitely. This way the cowards can nut up.
---
The autistic noise makers sure like it... at least according to their CTA forum and reddit posts..
---
Alex says JUMP!
---
RREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Loooooool. Dude. "No ones asking for easier killmails" Next sentence, "Im simply excited us hunters have much better chances of catching krabbers..."
---
Duuuuuuuuuuude, atleast hide your lies a bit. You contradict yourself within 2 consecutive sentences. Duuude.
---
I think what you are failing to understand is this. There is no point in having 30k players online, when none of them will interact with hostiles whereas its better to have 15k players when all of those interact with hostiles. Its almost like the entirety of null was instanced and seperate servers from tranquility, kinda like wow has multiple servers, without local with the little data we have we have seen more active defense fleets, bait ratters more roams more blopsing, more activity in general, thats what you should count and not a dead cold number that 100% includes shitloads of botters and people that are way too risk averse.
---
Facts don't care about your feelings
---
Join a new bro focused group that can SRP your losses and help teach you.    Brave. Horde, karma, etc...
---
just cause its easier to catch them doesnt mean its easier to kill them. Did supers get nerfed? no. Just their abilty to run and hide
---
Well, if you watch your footage back, you actually volley me to 20% shield.  Your problem was application, maybe instead of those Griffins that were kinda useless, maybe those boys should have been helping you apply better?
---
It's like you don't even read what I say so I can go step by step.
---
CCP announces controversial change, and will monitor the situation.
---
5 days later ccp makes an announcement that implies the change is permenant.
---
I post that ccp couldn't have made an educated decision in 5 days, and to act like they did is a lie.
---
Falcon replies shocked that people took their post to mean it was a permanent change.
---
Everyone begins acting like it should have been obvious and I am an idiot for not loving these changes or wanting ccp to actually communicate changes or not pretend to keep a promise.
---
Omg are they that bad that they made you think about joining min Mil??? 😲
---
Really big noob here returning to EVE after a few years away from mining, What's the most used/easiest missile to manafacture and how do i go about learning the skills to do so. Starting a fresh account and putting the data into EVEmon so i can get a defined path, TIA
---
You wrongfully assume that there is a solution in regards to any pvp activity that will satisfy all parties.
---
Every change will make things better for someone, and worse for someone else.
---
And the short notice honestly made it better than a long drawn out plan.
---
&gt; could have been embraced by all sides if it had been sold better
---
Based on the post made here, nothing would have been satisfactory except making things safer.
---
Not that hard to cloak and scan the system before starting. Once you know it's empty, keep checking dscan to ensure no one is probing you or your site. If so back off and cloak up, or warp out. 
---
It adds excitement. You don't know they are there, but on the flip side they also don't know your there either.
---
Yeah I used that overview pack. I need to set the dscan to show probes. I will look up the pandemic video. Gives me something to do at work here haha.
---
I'm one (20 some targets) fewer actualy player out there because of this. I've done nothing but pvp since. It was fun for a little while then all the targets docked up.
---
Very well said sir! And it describes perfectly how I feel aswell. Nullsec now has to be all about the PvP.... Well if all these hardass PvP godlike entities in this forum, looks themselves in the eye, and ask themselves how much PvP they actually did before blackout, they would come up with a minimal amount of their playingtime. That just proves that EvE is so much more the PvP.
---
Haven't logged in with any of my 6 accounts since blackout started, and they will remain logged off, if this stupidity will become permenant
---
I see you can call names to attempt to make your weak point. A combat also sit in a site waiting for a bot to land. You can use a cloaky to see the site it's in and what range it warps to sites before setting up a trap. 
---
Before Dotlan went dark this last weekend, you could see not much ratting going on in null where you'd normally see a great deal. Bots have definitely taken a hit with no local.
---
Sounds like it fits with the rest of the unfun and totally dynamic gameplay we already have.
---
&gt; In terms of future money gained though we are entirely equal.
---
Are you so sure?
---
I have 4 accounts. You imply you have 1.
---
The ramblings about local before were nowhere near the outpourings of salt we're seeing after it was announced.
---
Art, you read art
---
Psh, this is one more reason to go back to high sec.
---
please spend the next two years collecting data.
---
you know. to be thorough.
---
CCP Guard would have never let this be this messy
---
I know but still. The fking world has gone to shit honestly. You cant even have a discourse without people having the need to silence each other. Its the best metric to measure peoples ignorance and its honestly bothering me a lot. Just present your ideas, listen to other people talking and perhaps a concensus can be reached.
---
This way is so childish and moronic.
---
&gt; Please tell that you are considering delaying the killmails on ESI and removing most of the informations from there like public timers and system informations. Thx. 
---
try asking on tweetfleet or reading any of bartenders comments on the subject.
---
As an old bitter vet, this is bullshit and devalues my years of playing and training skills.
---
Luckily, the current sociopolitical trend is to embrace companies making decisions that benefit the game and not decisions that benefit the companies wallet.
---
When people make 100b per year and lose 1 maybe 2 ratting ships per year thats fucking dumb and broken.
---
Or maybe the botters just didnt log in to manipulate the data in their favour?
---
Like no point you could bring up would turn this in your favour.
---
I have seen bots operating on visual and used em for diablo 3 cause fuck key grinding and they in reality work pretty Well
---
I'd like to see caps and sub-caps separated completely. Caps should be a warship for declared wars, structures, and sov. Something needs to be done to change the mechanics.
---
&gt; ban supers in lowsec  
---
but Pornmaker...
---
Oh I will!
---
Duuuuuuuuuuuude, if u catch a PvE ship in a PvP ship its already over (reasonable shiptypes). 
---
Yes they actually did. Instead of constantly bitching about supers, check the fking patch notes.
---
I feel you.
---
Then move out of Europe or just vpn do a different country like the Russians do
---
They're mostly just fitting &amp; quality of life terms, it's slang so it might not show up on google. If nobody from your group can walk you through them, shoot me a mail in game(Exterminatus Illexis) and I'll help you.
---
The solution is that supers arent meant to be moved solo and by 1 person
---
Yeah there's about a zero percent chance of this one happening.
---
So your an expert botter. Ok. Well maybe you have some experience in EVE too.
---
Thank you mate. I was initially under the impression we would get certificates when reading the title.
---
"Normal PVP" overview mode shows probes by default if you haven't changed anything. But yeah, Pandemic Horde actually has a lot of publicly available training videos ranging from the basics up to being an FC.
---
And neither should you be able to tell when I'm mining a moon on the other side of the EVE universe. You should have to physically come to the system to see what the ADM levels are, if they are going up or down, and all the statistics that CCP killed for wormholes need to be killed for null systems as well. That was the main point I was trying to make, and it seems to have been missed.
---
1. New Character.
---
2. Flying a Kestrel. Therefore, probably Caldari.
---
3. Just entered a FW system. Therefore, on a highsec gate.
---
It was probably Tama. 
---
Tama is one of the most dangerous systems in all of Eve. It's the closest lowsec system to the biggest trade hub in game. Because of this, it's *always* camped by people. 
---
Find a different path into lowsec. You'll have better luck there.
---
&gt;Getting free vni kills is killing the game
---
It's not killing *the* game. It's just killing *your* game.
---
Dscan is a thing that exists.
---
Paint with a broad brush much? No ones talking about supers except the people telling people to stop bitching about supers...... and maybe you give up and die when you get caught krabbing but some people do this thing where they arent useless and fight back... sometimes they even win/escape
---
"lots of applause posting going on"
---
just people pushing their agenda, nothing else
---
Why is everything salt? Why aren't people allowed to disagree with a change. Every person here who doesn't like the change is either salty or botting and no one who supports this will think otherwise. How about you take a moment to actually consider people can have a different opinion and see why they have that instead of using hyperbole the entire time.
---
No, hauling needs to be fixed such that JF isnt the only thing to do.
---
Wouldnt vpn be against eula? There are other cheap ways as well but i like my accounts and i rather not lose em
---
How about you fit for pvp instead? Alternatively you can go to high sec and do some missions where the bogeymen won't hurt you often.
---
Risk-averse means not being stupid? Gotcha. 
---
Well, we wont reach an agreement. I doubt it will work, simply put.
---
You’re not wrong. But that meme’s pretty dead.
---
&gt;Dscan is a thing that exists.
---
And suppose someone utilises a certain class of ship that cannot be d-scanned?
---
Actually i didnt Look up bots in eve cause i do care about my accs here
---
All i wanna say you and every other "hurf blurf this hurra botters duuuuuh"  guy is use your brain and actually take a Look into the stuff youre tryin to talk about cause you all seem to forget that there is still a human behind the bot makigg login decisions etc
---
did you really just suggest that in order to play in null sec if you cant already fly supers and the like get the credit card out or fuck off? holy shit
---
It was perfectly fair. You chose to stash your assets in a station which could permanently lock you out, and you need to accept the consequences that you could very well permanently lose your stuff.
---
Wormholes have that mechanic, and don't have NPC stations as a get-out-of-losing-shit-free card, and you don't hear anyone bitching about losing shit in wormholes.
---
Christ, EVE players have become so spoiled on mechanics that remove risk from the game. Maybe the drop in player numbers is a good thing after all.
---
I think regular freighters are just awful ny comparison. I did the math once and youd need 2400 successful contract jumps to pay off a freighter. Thats abysmal.
---
hmm i dont want to, but he is kinda right. it does make sense
---
Nothing wrong with being salty friend. I'm still salty about rorquals.
---
I'm just disappointed I didn't get to whore on it
---
I think you are on to something.  EO must support many gamestyles to survive.   At least with Rorquals the carebears were lured out of highsec into nullsec where they could become content generators.  Big fat slow targets make content.  And they tend to have lots of accounts.  
---
I think CCP screwed the poodle on this one.  One person leaves and they take the concurrent login count down by 4, 6, 10 at at time.  
---
Goodnite, New Eden.
---
I'm ambiguous to it;
---
It certainly raised the stakes for going out in null. And it's out of question player controlled nullsec has been too safe for too long. However, this only makes people flock to the big blocs even more, as these can provide a level of security where local is basically negligible. At some point nullblocs will just boson or dreadbomb everything by default (if they didn't already) just to produce content denial whenever possible. This takes the whole idea behind the blackout back to square one.
---
I also think botters will just adapt. As it's "just a few lines" to have an overview bot that sits cloaked next to the gates and provides intel based on the overview.
---
I love this. We used to mine in mining cruisers in decent sized fleets and we had a CAP wing trying to keep the bad guys under control.
---
So what you are saying is you want local ship register not stargate, rn its stargate register cause once u jump u show up on local
---
make everyone probe them down works for me
---
This is a good post.  What is it doing here?
---
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/indefinite
---
Do you not know what "indefinite" means? Because it doesn't mean infinite.
---
Ahahahahahahahahaahaha
---
Hahahahahahahaha xD
---
You serious?
---
then they're stuck with dogshit ships
---
 https://www.twitch.tv/videos/453265556?t=20m39s

ninja salvagers everywhere
---
This is a good idea because cynos are what break Eve.
---
They should be removed from the game and caps should be forced to jump to celestials.
---
Congrats kid, now don’t get cocky.
---
\&gt;reading old logs in jabber
---
You talked about it. You asked, "Did supers get nerfed? no.". And no you are saying no one is talking about supers. Wtf dude, are you delusional? You just didnt like the response you got, totally foregoing the fact that supers have been nerfed. No one is talking about it, but everybody is complaining about supers.
---
And looooool. Dude, you are just out of it.
---
Curses are actually pretty good. Not dog shit at all when done right.
---
Balancing the game around people who aren’t playing sounds great.
---
Except my whole point in this thread isnt about being salty about the change. It's CCP pretending like they care how the game reacted to their change. They appeared to have their mind made up and are loving forward regardless of how the community reacted.
---
this is amazing hahaha
---
unfortunately you're cursed with a bad opinion
---
Whenyou jump into a system from a gate you appear in local when you break cloak.  If you come in from a WH you do not appear in local until you get on grid with a gate or structure uncloaked.  If you want full time local you need a structure that costs a shitload to keep online that "pings" the system like radar to show who is in local and pickup the WH traffic.
---
olololololoolol
---
lolololoool
---
lolollloolll 
---
I am
---
"Before, when I lost my ship, it is because I took risks. Now after this poopy blackout people can find me in zero security space and get me and I can't just decide to avoid other players like before and that makes me mad and grumpy."
---
So do we have any numbers for how many subbed and how many unsubbed for blackout? Betting on "Login Event" 2nd number probably is bigger.
---
Serpentis LP store.  
---
Run missions in Curse or Fountain. A lot of missions.
---
&gt;Otherwise, it really is actually time to harden the fuck up
---
Did you take a moment to think about what this actually looks like?  'Cause what it looks like is "let's drive everyone into supers".  Because apparently eve didn't already have a problem with capital proliferation.
---
Just so everyone knows - you are a huge goon try hard fanboi that will spend hours on end camping NPC Delve.  Your opinions are always extremely biased.
---
With that said; I obviously disagree with you.  The blackout has led to a huge spike in Delve gatecamps to deal with all the roamers running through their systems.  If it wasnt for this change he would been nestled away safely in his Keepstar and not out in the open.
---
there not your accounts there ccps they can take them away anytime, and you can use vpns as much as you like just dont be silly and don't try the vpn+steam that will get your banned.
---
plus on a side note vpns am pretty much the norm now
---
Is it just 1 extra training slot or can you train all 3 at the same time? Either way $1 is a great deal.
---
I was a bit surprised that wasn't the case to start with... I'm not exactly a lore junkie but it wouldn't have been beyond reason for those factions to have their own secure FTL comm-thingie.
---
It's still not wrong, and pretty applicable to the nullsex idiots bitching about how **teh whole gaem** is **litterally ruined!!!!1111ONE!111!** because their one specific zero-skill AFK no-effort playstyle is *slightly* more difficult now.
---
Please make it permanent, i've almost managed to convince my old mate i used to play eve with to come back. It depends on if this is permanent, he left due to bots, eve infested with bots, mining bots, hauling bots, ratting bots, trading bots and he thought what's the point...., this i think kills the null sec ones, a huge step in the right direction.
---
Post-leadership Grath is definitely the most enjoyable Reddit version of Grath.
---
I smell pussy
---
You may be willing to sit and wait indefinitely but I am not. I stopped payment on my accounts I was still subbing and started liquidating assets. Your last 2 "Tests" were about as smart as the walking in stations brain fart you guys cooked up.
---
Fuck HAW caps and anyone who likes them.
---
Even a bot will get tired of spamming dscan
---
$600 whole dollars? Easy there big money
---
Ok ty
---
I'm not in a corp atm but I think I found a link on Eve university or something
---
Your laziness is no-one's problem but your own.
---
Ok now I’m glad I just did one month sub.
---
Let's accept that this is true for argument sake. Then how would making d-scan automatic change any of this?
---
what if theres 500 of shit ships
---
its a fish
---
So bots cant have an alt on gates monitoring incoming ships? A bot that doesnt care one bit about how many times it d-scans, that doesnt tire, that doesnt lose focus.
---
And all this talk about nerfs to bots, do you really belive it yourself? That the bot handlers that make an irl living running bots are suddenly going to stop eating irl because of no local? Worst case, they cant rat. But guess what, theres plenty of other ways for bots. 
---
No local, will have a marginal effect on bots yet its being used as one of the main arguments for it. Its weak man and not one bit realistic.
---
A bot not logging into the game is a good thing. We'll see how well bots will adapt. Sure not all bots are the same. I hope CCP makes it more effort than what's if worth for all those shitbags.
---
This is an idiotic metric, please dont bring it up. The game needs active people, active attackers active defenders people that are in space and stay in space, bots and people that dock up 10j before a hostile arrives in the system will not be missed cause they simply didnt exist to interact with in the first place, they were playing in their own little server ignoring the rest of eve cause local allowed them to
---
I think people are just excited that CCP is trying to shake things up, especially after such long stagnation.
---
Is the blackout the holy grail? not really, tbh I feel pretty much meh about it and all I have done for the past 5 years is PVP. But it is a step in the right direction especially against botting and inflation which lets face it is ruining the game.
---
I do agree however that there are much deeper issues in this game that needs to be addressed, the blackout as bludgeoning of an effect it had, it was very easy to implement. What is not gonna be easy for them is fixing the real issues:
---
&gt; Capital umbrellas without fucking super pilots in the butthole.
---
&gt; Structure proliferation which is literally cancer.
---
&gt; Prevening TQ from becoming Serenity ala goons and legacy.
---
&gt; Skynet CTAs being what qualifies as a B-5RB now.
---
Among many issues that drive a lot of the usd plexers which CCP cares about the most.
---
Waiting for those changes since began playing the game 10 years ago. Saw the discussions on forums about these suggestions often, especially the split in seperate highsec islands thing I remember years ago. The suggestion about an expansion called "Outlaw" in 2008 by players to buff lowsec, too.
---
Everybody seems to know, that mechanics have to buff and to be improved.
---
Why are these things not gonna happen before without the game dying nearly and ccp sold to new owners? :(  
---
btw just disallowing cynos in ls could change alot, isn't it just a change of one db entry?
---
Dude... that was back in April.... try to keep up. And if you wanna get technical. YES I said the word supers. I said it in the context of responding to someone who brought up supers.  My response was meant to convey the fact that this post was not about supers.  Its about the lack of local being great.  Im not sure how you misconstrued that to mean were all talking about supers...
---
Its fucking great.
---
I have an Elo Knight corpse if anyone wants to buy it.
---
soo with Panfam turtle we can expect another spike in NPC kill, super umbrella is a problem for the economy
---
the blackout began when people were too lazy to hunt with tiny intel counter
---
"I've known about EVE for almost a decade but played for just a little over 5% of the time I've had an account. Please listen to my opinion."
---
&gt;How about you fit for pvp instead?
---
This assumes he has one attacker. That's often not the case. 
---
And that he doesn't dish out rat specific damage that a ganker would know to resist, thus nerfing his ticks.
---
He could use warp stabs, but then there was a thread crying about them earlier, and saying they should be removed. 
---
Basically he has a point. People crying about too much intel for ratters and miners don't give a shit about the high level of intel they get for free. I think the hunter should have to actually hunt, instead of being able to warp to 0 and guarantee themself a barge/orca/ratting ship kill. Mining ships in particular are fucked even if they see someone on d-scan.
---
Thats the problem if it is actually Well written you almost cant find it from the devs side of Things
---
&gt;Hotdropping and the fact that every man and his dog in lowsec (including those in FW) started fielding cap fleets effectively killed lowsec piracy and small gang pvp. I witnessed this myself - I gave up on lowsec piracy the day that MC dropped five motherships on me while I was soloing in a Bhaalgorn in Molden Heath. If I remember, that was in 2010/2011 - I hung my eyepatch up after that and ended up joining CCP haha.
---
BOOM
---
There it is. Hotdropping kills the game. 
---
All of Eves problems with people not undocking, not leaving safety can be traced back to the fact that there is an unknowable force multplier of austistic proportions that can on grid you instantly if your exposed.
---
Make caps jump to Celestials then warp to grid. That delay makes the skirmish possible. Subcaps will fight either to apply or escape the tackle and have a chance at settling things before the blob can mobilize. Additionally caps are now less safe because they cant jump on a station.
---
Also get rid of asset protection for caps. This game needs more dead caps.
---
&gt;Shedding 10 krabs for 1 such plex buyer is a good financial move for ccp
---
depends on if those 10 krabs also bought plex from ccp or not
---
No, it began because instantly-updating unlimited free intel allowed rampant botting activity.
---
use a PvP fit, get 3% lower ticks, PvP shit that tries to PvP you.
---
you know how to PvP, right?
---
I wasn't saying I've spent a lot.
---
(It's probably more but I aint about to do math to make a simple point).
---
My point is that, financially, we aren't equal.
---
But also, the financial argument is a dumb one on a per-account basis
---
it did ruin the availability of minerals though
---
This should be forever. In the 13 years I've played this game I haven't seen this much positive feedback since Trinity when the graphics went into 21st century. Everyone fucking loves it except people who don't like the game and just want to play single player in the middle of zero security space when high sec is readily available for that kind of gameplay.
---
Yeah piggybacking on what /u/Leonard-MeadowLion said, don't let people discourage you from having fun as an alpha. I was for a long time and thoroughly enjoyed it. Keep having fun and flying smart.
---
Not being able to warp away was the same patch, which you mentioned. But you havent mentioned the previous nerfs to anoms which is also a nerf to superratting. Neither have you mentioned that they really cant track all that well anymore meaning the thing everybody keeps talking about, supers popping frigs, isnt really viable anymore.
---
I read what you wrote. And responded. Because the supercap umbrella is the number one complaint of people on this subreddit. And im saying, its kinda dead so supers shouldnt be bitched about as much.
---
disgusting
---
How would this benefit me? Lol
---
&gt; This PVP OR GTFO mindset is ...
---
... a straw man.
---
You are welcome to PVE. But you shouldn't be able to PVE with essentially zero risk for no effort. Local has effectively removed roaming and small gang PVP from the game, and it's great that they're back - as *options*, not something you have to do.
---
Remember when they proposed removing fleet warp?
---
Im not really sure what your point is. Seems like your just arguing for augment sake.  Stand down
---
Hakonen... so thats where all the build stuff ended up...
---
Thanks Havoc
---
Also WTS minerals and cap parts.
---
Okey dude. Im quite done.
---
I know, thats why I said you’re not wrong.
---
I for one am happy. Everyone is content going to 0.0 so there’s noway TDSIN would ever find out I’m taking all their sites.
---
Please dont speak about stuff you arent aware, eve bots are dumb AF and keep warping to anoms with pods, if youve never used or hunted a bot in eve your opinion is completely useless and uniformed there is not a single bot out there that works on visuals in fact 99% of the bots work with the map open so random missclicks(yes they happen when the ui has countless buttons plus a single click can do more things than one, see how command window with approach orbit etc works) dont get them to wander in space or break their align or orbit. Also they do not use dscan cause that would be counter productive cause even blues csn throw you off so PLEASE learn how they work first, give us your opinion later.
---
Help, I think he has an aneurism.
---
This is exactly how I feel. Amen.
---
Great now guess why these are the only bots you see ffs Do i really need to get a dev over here just to prove you wrong?
---
Not with that attitude
---
There a story here?
---
It is only stupid because it doesn't support you, 2000 accounts is 2000 accounts. If their abscense didn't affect your ability to have fun what is wrong with them existing. And you can't say they are all bots because you can't prove that and no one is defending botters.

(BTW we need the ability to warp through the interstellar space to travel without stargates. Then we could start destroying stargates!)
---
Is that sexual? If so, sign me up
---
To bad he had to be literally called out to get real information from ccp.
---
The different kinds of space should follow some kind of risk vs reward progression, which clearly wasn’t in balance and is getting better thanks to the blackout. If you want nearly risk free gameplay you need to accept lower rewards. Highsec and lowsec both still have local, just sayin.
---
just 1 extra
---
Stop being such an easy kill?
---
Ah yes, I’m retard(ed) too
---
More importantly, what is TTT drama?
---
You're going to have to connect the dots a bit for me regarding this relationship between null blackout and super proliferation, because it is not a self-evident relationship, at least not to me.  I suspect I'm not the only one.  
---
If anything I would think that super proliferation might be actually be _retarded_ by the change.  Yes, capital response fleets will be more important than ever, as ratters and miners won't always be able to dock up to avoid hunters without local based intel.  On the other hand, the increased strain on PvE as a result of this new danger is likely to retard the acquisition of liquid isk (ticks) and minerals (rorqs dying), which seems necessary for most players to afford supers and titans. Feel free to correct me if I've missed something here though.
---
Leave me and 30 toons gam... wait. Yes, I agree!
---

---
Mate it’s true. Worst weekend for a month for raw numbers. What’s important is whether the trend continues or whether that is just a coincidence. After a few more weeks it will be clear I’m sure whether this had a positive, negative or net zero affect on the raw player numbers. 
---
All the really important activity figures are locked away in CCP’s vault to be analysed by the data goblins for insights. We will never really know.
---
No.  Even goons have standards.
---
Congratulations, I've gone back in time and implemented your ask. You can already get loot for shooting structures in k-space. Go now. Go shoot them. Get loot. There are refineries in Delve worth trillions of ISK, as an extreme example.
---
&gt;instead of being able to warp to 0 and guarantee themself a barge/orca/ratting ship ki
---
Well, first off, don't be at 0, and 2, noting about that is guaranteed.
---
Moving ore between your fortizars? Because they're big af and you're 100% safe. If you're using one to bring stuff from hisec please let me know I provide great security services, as I'm pretty sure you're the only person in the market for those services.
---
It would make sense if he said "make all anoms have to be probed down by everyone".
---
But but, MORE RATTERS MEANS MORE PVP!!!
---
so any way we can get CCP to test the removal of all free intel in game or via esi?
---
Band of Brothers
---
They're called Shattered Wormholes and they are more dangerous and more lucrative
---
The wrong with them existing is that they require a server-tick-perfect intel from 20j away using things like intel channels and even worse near2 or xyz. Them requiring that perfect intel makes the rest thousands of us that logged in these few days to not have fun, so if you care about the 2000 accounts that didnt play throw some care about the rest 30k people that logged in this weekend to play and actually had a blast
---
Yeah but you run the risk of being that one guy that gets caught.  Most don't take the risk and those that do accept the risk of being fined or blacklisted.
---
Warping to 0 is the low effort method of warping to something, that was my point. Turning up in system and clicking an anom isn't hard.
---
Not that you genuinely are more likely to find someone at 0.

---
No idea. Haven’t had time yet to compare this weeekend killmails to previous weekends. 
---
Though I would say, killmails don’t consume plex.
---
What a bunch of bullshit. I bought this and it's not a token. It's always a token. What the hell?
---
Asking for my money back. I buy 1 years subs, this is false advertising.
---
I feel you, industry guy here. I sub three accounts year at a time and mostly do industry/pve and fleets for paps. Just keeping my stuff docked and not really logging in. Drifters where ridiculous and I lost a few subcaps to instalock death. Don’t really want to deal with this insanity, I lived in a worm hole for years and moved to null so I could stop mashing d scan.
---
Arh  Verone, never knew you were Falcon 👍 I fondly remember the Celestial Apocalypses days, chasing pirates around, joined Veto for a while too 😎
---
Talking of bad, where’s Otsdarva?
---
As per goons, is it Tnt, Bastion or that Chinese corp which is the worst alliance imperium?
---
But isn't that exactly your argument?
---
If I warp to zero and am not in point range, then the target has had plenty of time to get out from dscan and seeing me on grid.
---
So your argument is inherently terrible.
---
Warp to 0 never guarantees a kill.
---
Has there been any thought to having a POS/Station mod that auto scans the system every 10 min \[even every 30 min would be ok in my book\] and broadcasts to all in that system an updated local list?
---
Then its kind of best of both worlds no? anyone roaming about can have up to 10 min \[or what ever\] before they are picked up by the scanner... but its shows if someone is camping the system 24/7.
---
I just think that with the drive to be more accommodating to new players that having a full blackout in my view would drive me away from null.
---
Tfw hillmar logging into the game has been good for us

Go into lowsec. Die. Talk to killers.

99% of eve bots rat with map open, 99% of eve bots are so sensitive to changes that require specific layouts and themes and if ccp changes the font just a little bit or how big headers are or the spacing between letters the bot stops calibrating correctly. Get a dev get whoever you want you have absolutely no freaking idea what you talk about.
---
Well if they plan to rework the factionnal (and they do) why they don't change the reward (bounty + LP ?) and make the plex an Arena, when you warp in you can't warp off until someone capture the plex, add a "combat zone" like the abyssal arena this and a "frontline" could be interesting &lt;3  
---
this way you can farm in PvP \\o/
---
Thank you for your work.
---
Is that like getting Donkey Punched?
---
Compared to the risk, there are just not enough ingame incentives that reward PvP. Can't buy a new ship with a killmail.
---
another kind of autism
---
Couldt have said it better
---
Right and you got a reply from a dev telling you to stop getting your panties in a twist so what's your point now?
---
You know, your comments reek of disdain for NS. Like they are subhumans with only one thing on their mind, making isk. You totally fail to see that they, as normal Eve players, suffer the boredom and stagnation that exists in the current meta. And you know who the biggest critics are? Its NS, not you. So saying that they want things to be made safer is such an utterly shitty remark to make and tells everyone, or should atleast, that you dont even wanna consider other opinions. Because NS are trash in your eyes.
---
And this is why any change saluted by people like you will make the game worse, not better.

I'm so glad I only visited your coun... Game.
---
Not really. Good to stop vnis and other ratters.
---
The problem is your wording, the system right now is stargate register you jump you show up and you want it you decloak you show up, the action that makes you show in local is the activation of gate or wh. The thing you want is the activation of movement of your ship to show up
---
Need to need their viability for making isk then.
---
He could hardly apply damage on after burner fit battle cruisers. The haw phoenix isn't the best dread out there.

other ships are better

Also once you enter a shattered you can never leave. This should make them dangerous enough.

The funny thing about this whole thing is these anecdotes about roaming gangs finding each other and fighting being this novel thing that happens because there's no local. It is like, motherfuckers, you could have been doing this for years. Local had nothing to do with it.

Dude, this sub requires you to leave logic behind. Same people that are hailing the blackout are the same people saying the login number drop doesnt matter due to not having enough data. Yet they are adamant that their anecdotal data gathering of 3 days is enough.
---
They havent even considered the long term effects and refuse to do so. Like dogs chasing cars.
---
A hearty yeet to you good sir.
---
As a nullsec bloc member i hate it, but as an eve player i love it, so pls do some very long and extensive data collection :P
---
I like blackout but I do think it will really hurt smaller pvp alliances (the few that exist)
---
How pray tell do you get the loot out?
---
As a ganker, this is great...but as a miner....this sucks.
---
Nooo. Leave lowsec alone. I mine there.
---
How would one make a movement cause you to appear in local.  When you jump you have a 30 second cloak that stays applied until you move.  The idea is that you can dscan and hunt for 30 seconds without alerting the crabs.  Or if you break your gate cloak boom you appear.  Regardless of how you over analyze it the idea is the same.  Structures report you to the local chat system.  Unless you enter via a structure ( Stargate ) you do not appear in local until a structure sees you.
---
I quit. I'm never subbing again ever. Simply because they treat this game as some test box. Like some sort of sandbox game and play with my emotions.
---
What are you basing these numbers on? And is it relevant? I know market people that prob make much much more than that without losing a single ship. Are you gonna wage a war against them next?
---
Good :)
---
It should trigger after X time (a month?) of not logging into the account, not be there to save your ass if you don't feel like defending or evaccing your shit.
---
aka. Darkfail.
---
My stiletto got two shot by a carrier today at fullspeed max transversal with Templars. He was max tracking fit but still
---
Which is weird when modern companies generally care only about the next quarter and not for two years down the road.
---
I do agree the Phoenix needs a buff, I'm just saying that dreads should not be able to handle 10+ BCs and BSs
---
That's an awful lot of words to use to cry about losing the free, perfect, immediate intel that made it impossible to hunt anything.
---
Player count is down for the moment because the bots and near-AFK VNI alts aren't logging in. This is not a problem. And although krabs will hide in station for a few days, at some point they'll need to come out and make ISK again - the first few days of the blackout aren't representative of anything.
---
&gt; I thought that EVE was a big enough umbrella that there was room for multiple playstyles
---
Not with local - because when the locals can dock up before you even load system, any hunting playstyle is completely non-viable. If you really think that nullsec ratting, with local, provided a fair level of risk/reward, then you have been doing it for too long to have any sense of balance left.
---
&gt; you can't do anything to a stargate to deny a hostile entity the use of it
---
fc what is deployable bubble (or gate camp)
---
&gt; No cynos in wormholes
---
Yes, you shouldn't be able to instantly decloak and cyno in a fleet. But really, how much is that going to happen with no local, when the ships coming through that cyno don't know what the defenders have?
---
&gt; I can see pilots in space, NPC kills, jumps, ship kills, pod kills. I can see even more statistics on Dotlan (especially NPC kills delta).
---
None of those are immediate. I do agree that some should be delayed further, but they are all refreshed hourly or after 15 mins, which is quite different from seeing when someone enters system to the second.
---
&gt;But isn't that exactly your argument?
---
It appears you didn't understand.
---
My argument is that it's very possible to do the default low effort mode and still be successful, especially when hunting certain ships. There's very little difficulty involved for the ganker. 
---
&gt;If I warp to zero and am not in point range, then the target has had plenty of time to get out from dscan and seeing me on grid.
---
Most mining vessels will not. 
---
&gt;So your argument is inherently terrible
---
Read it slowly and maybe you'll understand. 
---
&gt;Warp to 0 never guarantees a kill.
---
You've missed the point.
---
Dude, surge? Its been up for a day and its not even caught up. What you are saying is even worse than the other side. Has anyone even compiled numbers from zkill yet? To actually see if there is an uptick in kills?
---
Highly doubt it so maybe not pass judgment this fast?
---
How would you rate Bad Guy as a fleet-sing-along song? We've been looking for new ones and nobody is taking my Paramore suggestions seriously.
---
Good idea, I was especially curious about those free MCT
---
God fucking dammit, I'm gonna miss the login event again.
---
Or three months
---
People have been getting Boson'd for quite some time, mainly in Delve but not exclusively, so it's hardly worth posting anymore... I seriously miss the point you are trying to make here.
---
As another bitter vet, can we get rid of half the skills already? We need more people losing shiny ships, not less.
---
I understand where you are coming from it is hard to go most places now with out being on a camera.  
---
That said as ccp has done the black out why should hunters get the intel on where people are undocked in system plus how many npc kills in the last hour or 24 hours or if there is a cyno in system. 
---
All i want is there to be no free intel for both sides.  You want to find a target you have to travel there and look and see if you can find anyone. 
---
Not just open map click a botton and hey people are killing npc here and here there is 70 people and low npc kills i might avoid said system.
---
Well, closest since skill injectors came out. I was heated then too.
---
Like what?
---
he isn't wrong really, its the way to do it to remain safe.
---
Nullsec is supposed to be dangerous. It shouldn’t feel safe at all.
---
Ok, let's walk through this.
---
Blackout means subcap ratting is much, much, much, much, much more dangerous, and you're gonna die before any response fleet can come save you.  It's just not possible to tank a subcap sufficiently while still killing the rats at any sort of speed.
---
So, what ship can they rat in that won't immediately die, so that they can actually cyno in a response fleet?  It's going to require at least a carrier.  A super would be way, way safer and as an added bonus make more money.
---
Also, a lot of ratters were multi-boxing VNIs/Domis/whatever because of the low effort required.  Blackout means they have to dscan and otherwise pay active attention to the game.  Which means they can't AFK rat anymore.  Which means the main drawback of carriers/supers for ratting is gone.
---
So the people who multi-VNI'ed are now going to switch to carriers, and probably supers.  Making capital proliferation worse.
---
The people who only had one account for ratting in a subcap?  Well, they're fucked.
---
Also fucked are bots, but only temporarily.  They'll be updated soon to park intel bots around their ratting area.  And no, there are not all that many wormholes you can use to sneak in (plus those show up on the probe scanner anyway, so the bot can be programmed to dock in that system and you trigger the gate watchers when you roam to other systems.)
---
Lastly, you forgot one other thing:  Manning that super umbrella isn't all that fun on its own.  Dropping is.  If you're right and there's more small fleets roaming around, then there's more drops.  And since this change pushes ratters into carriers and supers, there's even more capitals to drop (they won't always be ratting with those hulls.)
---
&gt;and minerals (rorqs dying)
---
Rorqs are not all that affected.  Yes, the extreme end of risk aversion docked up, but there's not *that* many such people.  Besides, indy core meant they couldn't just go dock on every red that entered the region, and still doesn't.  And then there's PANIC for when they do get caught.
---
So, rorqs are not all that hurt, and minerals will still flow just fine.
---
only thought about d-scan and combat probing, you are probably right. time to create at least one deep safe again in addition to relic site warp-in BM's. not to much effort in between scanning and i'll benefit with none covert-ops ships from it, later on.
---
true as well, i probably can't / won't engage in Astero vs Astero pvp anymore if i decide to run  2 stabs. only had 2 fights vs Asteros in a month time anyway. at the same time, was only attacked once by stealth bombers. dk, don't like the idea of being completely helpless vs bombers but don't want to give up on astero pvp as well. i'll try a mobile depot and hope it's not too much effort, thx for the suggestion.
---
the bubble wasn't in HS (don't think that's even possible, only null-sec and j-space, right?), it was in the WH that connects to HS (at least last time).
---
Throw the whole game into chaos.. null, low and hisec. Everything besides rookie systems in hisec.
---
Oh, huh. They should update the description of the outer ring region, then
---
Most fucking def. It literally does nothing concerning the real issues Eve is facing and on top of those its added the fun aspect of people not being able to really conduct war since everyone has to defend against these roamers that once every 6 months decide to resub and then have a tantrum and quit again.
---
so you're encouraging pay to win mechanics?
---
I was using my sub length to explain how much experience i had in the game, not lend weight to my argument. Perhaps I should have worded it differently. But still, my sub is just as valuable as any other. They have already spent your money and mine but next month we are worth exactly the same dollar amount (not taking into account extra spending habits like selling plex to get isk etc).
---
What if the structure had 3 requirements?
---
1.  Adjacent system must have local (could chain them).
---
2. Must not be low power.
---
3. Doesn't work if more than 3 structures anchored in system (interfears with transmission or whatever).
---
 Hell make it  so it is destroyable (no reinf timer?) and if you kill the right one/two can break the chained connections.
---
So gives everyone counter play, strategic targets, and cuts into structure spam.
---
Not sure what is required from a fit for burner missions but I can say I have 39 kills with my Nergal this weekend and it was unbelievably overpowered in a small gang.
---
Afk vni ratting is just as low effort.
---
Oh look, another post about bringing local back to Nullsec
---
You consent to pvp the moment you undock.
---
&gt;"let's drive everyone into supers"
---
 
---
Let's not pretend that this isn't already the case.
---
Status quo is already "supers or bust", it literally cannot get any worse.
---
You would be correct there.
---
If your krab accounts still have omega time, petition CCP to freeze them. If things change, if and when you decide to unfreeze them, it's a lot easier to spoil back up when they all have omega without having to pay or plex them all. It also sends a message that you didn't just walk away from the game forever, you took the time to preserve the accounts future viability.
---
Well, I can see where people are mining and ratting thanks to the Eve map showing me where the indy and military indexes are going up.  There's also all the data on npc and ship kills.  There's also the ESI endpoints feeding sites like zKill and dotlan.
---
Then there's in-game features like locator agents and fleet invites if you're after a particular whale.
---
True
---
Not to be that guy but I’ll take some donations before you totally quit. Help a brother out!
---
Scam is a very loaded word. I'm leaning towards this being *not scam*, but only just. The wording of these sales is often suspiciously easy to misinterpret.
---

---
&gt;*goon tryhard fanboi that will spend hours on end camping NPC Delve.* 
---
lol as long as you keep believing this I'm ok with it
---
ORE logos are on all the system gates and top left system info. Serpentis are the npc pirates of that space.
---
But how am I supposed to talk to cute bois in my system without local?
---
Enlist into factional warfare. There are complexes that only allow frigs so you can get decent fights there and you will get money by taking over complexes as well!
---
I thought they stopped the drifters?
---
That's very interesting. Would they do that?
---
Holy shit yes yes yes!!!
---
I saw the sun! And birds, and heard laughter. I now get why people say the blackout has made life more spooky!
---
Dude, if you think the blackout is going to last forever, I’d like a couple ounces of what your smoking. This is a temporary deal. Enjoy it while we can. But understand ccp WILL be bringing local back to ns.

That it shouldn't have been needed in the first place and that people act like I was wrong for making the same assumption they did except not being happy with it. No one should be happy that it took someone mad to get the actual story of what's going on.

Couldn't do it when you know where everything is instantly 10 jumps out. Now you actually have to hunt and you can evade.
---
She went home angry, I went to bed embarrassed. Never again I say!
---
press v
---
Super ratting was much more of a pain in the butt than running several VNIs/Domis/Ishtars/etc.  So plenty of people who had a super still ratted in subcaps because of the level of effort.
---
Now that subcaps require close attention, and can't live long enough to cyno in a response fleet anyway, might as well rat in the super 'cause it can live long enough to cyno in the cavalry.
---
So yes, it can get worse.  And it just did.
---
I haven't seen them since thursday or friday, but who knows what the fuck ccp is thinking since free login candy sp events, poorly executed drifter shit, and turning null into wormhole space? People can go play in wormholes if they like this shit so much. It gets old. They might bring back drifters for shits and giggles.
---
All of these things currently exist. The only ones youre fking over are newer players. You really think this is the way to go? To force more people to live under umbrellas and mine in Rorqs and rat in supers?
---
You know what, props to that guy.
---
What part of people have multiple accounts do you refuse to understand?
---
Fewer accounts logged in does not mean fewer players, at all.
---
PvP is a lot harder to multibox than PvE, this makes it a better measure of actual asses-in-seats participation in the game.
---
I made 100Mn ISK from winning a bet on r/eve.

CCP made shitty decisions and players optimized their play style around those mechanics. When ccp realized there are huge issues, instead of fixing the underlying mechanics which are still broken, they throw away local and basically say FU to the people that embraced their dev's choices. Noting is fixed, it's just a typical ccp move to take something from completely broken one direction and then go 200% the other direction after years of complaints. I figure with ccp, null won't be re-buffed for krabs until somewhere around 2023.

I answer questions in chat and issue invoices for administrative services. Some times people pay

Why not? Just fly towards the other roaming gang. Hell, it makes it easier.
---
Except small gangs fight other small gangs all the time lmao. This last weekend my corp ended up roaming in catch a couple times. 
---
First roam brave wouldnt undock at all so we ended up shooting a goon raven gang that was there https://br.inyour.space/?s=1162&amp;b=8695020&amp;e=90&amp;t=yf

Haha this guy. PVP ain't for everyone. One day I may just fit geckos/neuts/drone damage amps and stop being a "little pussy". And one day you may forget you are not on the internet and talk to someone like that in RL haha. Wish I could be there for that day lol. Anyways, PVP is just not something I have really been interested in trying. One day maybe. I moved into a Stratios because I thought I could fit it to be somewhat good at both or fit it to be tanky AF and still hack but it doesn't seem to be the case. I may move back to an astero at this point.
---
Yep. I mean might as well get paid for it...Genius.
---
Um the triglavian invasions are in hi and low sec space so local is still there.
---
Yes. But he works as a janitor.

The main thing core stabs help you with are the longpoint solo fits, like retributions, a lone ceptor holding you while his friends come in, or something like a covert cyno hunter. With a 100mn there's still plenty of play/counterplay since you have to align out which takes eons even when cycling off so there's time to land secondary tackle. Also that ceptor can come in and scram you which makes him more vulnerable but will keep you held if you don't have more stabs. Again, play/counterplay.
---
In the case of the cyno, since it stops their movement you can burn out of scram range and bail since the longpoint can't hold you, but the same thing applies where you need forever to align out and they can still get secondary.
---
I didn't know you could speak for literally every player logged in. You have no idea how everyone else felt about the game and reddit is always the vocal minority. 
---
And you don't seem to get what I'm saying. What is the difference between those players docking and not being online in your world? You weren't able to hunt them either way. All we have is you think your play style should be given extra consideration over those players.
---
Tranquility trading tower - station owned by test, ph, goons, and maybe someone else. They raised the tax on it, and caused a bunch of drama.
---
Nice man, best part about eve is 1st, 10th, or 100th all get the blood pumping. Shit never gets old
---
There is risk on that too, one extra or less 9 and down goes a lot of isk. And yes war will be waged to ultra safe endgame iskmaking, when you could make easily much more with incursions whs or lvl5s that actually required some effort and not just log super in see wallet go up. You cant be easy and safe.
---
Dont think he realised that his playstyle needs to harden the fuck up aswell and stop bitching about null all the time. Maybe even force his band of NS haters to actually take ingame action towards all those filthy NS dwellers instead of reddit posting about how others should stop playing the game.
---
Is this accounting for the price of the ship at all? There was a massive spike in supercap ratting recently, but if 1 supercap loss only counts as 1 ship loss, it's not really surprising it looks like this.
---
&gt; EO must support many gamestyles to survive.
---
But it didn't, until this change.
---
I agree Eve is dying, yesterday (Sunday) Eve was at 14k during us prime time! Lol!
---
But...but....then their killboard might have red on it!!!!
---
However when I did use a VNI to rat, I never did it AFK. It's weird to just assume all ratting is AFK. 
---
A mining orca may or may not be afk, but it makes little difference since it can't escape even if it sees an attacker on d scan.
---
 So just no solo hauling at all instead? Call me crazy but I dont see why hunters need that much of an advantage to what they are already capeable of. Hauling in mildly active areas with a stab or 2 is still super dangeorus as is.
---
Good
---
Except they had to immediately wall it back.
---
Quick, announce a free SP login event!
---
Please give me a screenshot of 500 of these ships going after a single vni. I'll wait.
---
Stop being so scared of nonsensical "whatifs" and grow a fucking spine for once in your life
---
I'm trying to now but I don't have the reputation or something
---
Eve is better off dying the game it was meant to be than living as the perverse farmville you want it to be.
---
I got mine recently too. And a few more beyond that.
---
For good fights, head on up to Black Rise where I roam. And if you can't find any fights roaming in Black Rise, that's when you go to Tama.
---
of course, but my experience in FW is that they just hide in a citadel or off-scan and warp in the second they tackle you - thus you gotta have their corp "redlisted" so they stand out in local.
---
I'm talking about the people who bring 7-10+ cruisers/battlecruisers to kill a solo cruiser/battlecruiser.
---
you're a dumb duck
---
They should delete the Cyno, and make people jump to a celestial then, warp to grid.
---
The cyno was a horrible idea.
---
Based on what? Do you have any shred of evidence that botting actually went down? And I hear HS has the highest concentration of bots, no evidence to back that up but its as viable as your no evidence. But I can tell you this, bots started changing when the drifters showed up. Im fairly certain most have already transitioned into other activities.
---
Nullsec should be dangerous. The higher the risk the higher the reward. The economy is probably going yo get better now that more ships are dying and it’s more dangerous to be out there. 
---
Honestly, if you want a risk-free activity, move to highsec or lowsec.
---
Back in tdsin, we paid a dude a few billion isk to dip his testicles in ghost chili salsa. I think he dropped the tip in it too. Put dresser and bed in front of door because was in college but still lived at home with mom and dad in extremely fundamentalist christian household. He scrambled to pull bed and dresser out of the way while pantless and fanning his junk and trying to not scream or cry while his mom asked him what was going on. Was on video. Was worth every isk.
---
Nope...  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cdm73l/blackout\_now\_forever/etv0aph/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cdm73l/blackout_now_forever/etv0aph/)

Who told you that?
---
You should self destruct a super to show CCP just how SUPER DUPER SERIAL you are.
---
Cant wait, will resub if they bring more balance to this.
---
I like local, but i dont... thats why i think they need a halfway option. If i had the choice of local or no local i would chose local though. Wh space is for total blackout in my view, but null does need to be more risky.
---
who wouldve thought making the game worse for the majority of players would cause a decline in playercount
---
No, just delete cynos. They were a bad idea.
---
Make caps jump to celestials.

What happened in April of this year to make npc kills drop off so hard?

Oh god no. The only thing they could do to make eve player's balls any bluer is giving free Viagra bottles with Plex packages.

While a noble idea in spirit, this would have essentially no impact on Amazon's bottom line.

Gotta save those for the end of the fiscal quarter.

Most people dont care if there 3 week old Bastion/TNT/Lawn alt gets kicked really.
---
Like eve?
---
Sorry but if your interpretation of -2000 accounts is look ccp you lost 2000 accounts my interpretation is look ccp a big percentage still logs in and plays and much more at that. Their need of local is crippling for the rest of us, noone stops them from logging in and doing their thing but essentially you stop me with local cause unless i find a super lucky wormhole that they dont roll there is no way for me to get close without being seen.
---
Thaaank you. This is what people have been saying but no one seems to listen. Long term it will do much more dmg than it will fix. The game needs to go in the opposite direction to ensure that smaller corps can thrive and rise up to challenge the existing blocs, not wipe them out.
---
Pretty much.
---
None of those are 'instant, free, perfect'.
---
The stats are all delayed, so they're not instant. None of them show you pilot names, so none of them are perfect, except kill feeds, which are hugely imperfect because you don't show up if you don't kill anything.
---
Locator agents are not instant, and they are not free - it's significant effort to keep track of individuals with them.
---
The fleet invite online check is dumb and should be patched, but that is far from perfect too, since it doesn't tell you where they are.
---
I autistically spammed d scan for 6 years in wormholes. That was enough.
---
Haulers are in a shit place anyway. They need to have their defense buffed and/or cost reduced
---
JF is the only viable hauler life and its hellah involved.
---
i don't think so since inviting someone to fleet to see if hes online can potentially give it away (if hes not in fleet)
---
i think there's a difference in that null sec is known to have players, where as low sec outside of FW is kind of a ghost town. I've done a bit of exploring, and outside of 3-4 systems in Aridia and 2 in Placid I really haven't found anything interesting in low sec.
---
A key insight from this is the fact that all the activity i found is in Aridia (where LSH live) and to a lesser extend in the 2 mission hubs in Placid, is that these are areas where you would *expect* to find players, much like you would expect to find players in player-owned null sec - in other words it's not as "ghost town" as low sec, but also not as "wild west" as wormholes (because of gates, less persistent players as of now).
---
I also think it would be a good idea to keep the "null sec pvp experience" and the "low sec pvp experience" separate is a good idea since it promotes diversity, not everyone wants the sneaky covops pvp experience.
---
I don't know if bosons were a mistake but what they were added to deal with was removed cause ccp.....

---
Funny point, awfully made
---
I'll take a lower population count that has more real human players with a spine than an inflated one filled with risk averse bots and krabs.
---
Yeah, this is a pretty tedious explanation. That's going to be a :bigdoubt: from me concerning the notion that people were simply _choosing_ to rat in subs rather than caps.  I think the primary reason people rat in subs is SP on the account.  You can afk bot in carriers and even supers just as easily as you can in a VNI. I kinda doubt that anyone who's tasted carrier / super ticks would relegate the usage of the account to a domi or vni.  
---
And with rorq's we'll see.  Yeah, you're right that they'll still be able to PANIC and light cynos and bring in super response fleets. I can tell you though - that this is exactly what a lot of fcs _want_ to happen.  The main difference now is that this will happen more often (because rorqs will have more difficulty knowing if someone has eyes on them), and you're going to be a little more in the dark when you bring that super response fleet in.  All it takes is one well-orchestrated SD cyno in a deep safe within range (and subsequent immediate logoff of a few dozen dreads) for a hastily assembled rorq saving super fleet to become big wrecks in space.
---
I havent

Why is it worse?

So will a prospect and those things are 40m

Its pretty good, challenging but enjoyable. I much preferred our rendition of the Titanic Theme Tune. Really allows a vocalist to express their range.

I mean, they don't look great, but they also don't look like the OP unless you make sure to cut off the chart right at monday's downtime.
---
No one should have teleportation.
---
But then freighters will all needs buffs and lower costs.
---
That's fine. It's when you start going cross-racial, multiple turrets types along with missiles AND drones is when you start to stretch your 5M skill points too thin. Also consider starting multiple accounts, you can even use the same email address. All your accounts show up on the launcher so it's easy to switch, and you can have one character per account training skills at a time. So you can specialize a bit as an Alpha but still get to check out all the races and different kinds of weapons.
---
Market traders don't create ISK, it's a completely invalid comparison for any sort of ISK or resource creating activity.

Nice post, thank you for presenting your views and sad to see you go.

This makes the assumption that carebears in general have the testicular fortitude to drop a super in a site if they can't read the screen scrapes from Near2 every 30 seconds.

You could always let people have their cake and eat it too in a manner of speaking.   Introduce an upwell structure that functions in a similar matter to Ansiblex Gates, perhaps with one caveat that it could not be anchored within range of a Keepstar's DD.   A Communications Node if you will.   When online local functionality in a given system works the way it used to.  When reinforced or destroyed it takes out local in a given system.
---
Yeah, go to the eveonline account page, log in, and put in a petition under 'billing' I think. It usually takes 24-72 hours. You don't have to give a reason, just say I want account2, account4, account5, and accountx frozen. If your accounts aren't linked, you have to do them individually.
---
He wasnt talking about the creation of isk, but income (make), so your comment is completely invalid.
---
oh no, less bots
---
I thought we did that one already.
---
Again, I'm not eloquent enough for my task.
---
I called this change unfair without making adjustments elsewhere, Then I enumerated the things that stayed the same that I thought should have changed to make things *more fair.*  That would have been a change that while making it more dangerous to PvE I could have understood and even supported.  What we got was all one way, and I don't think it needed to be to accomplish the intended goal.  So based on the attitude I see coming from devs posting on this very forum, either they intended this to be "all one way" or they just didn't care enough to make the effort.  And it really doesn't matter which way it was, because either way is bad enough for me to say I'm done.
---
Awesome. Thanks!
---
&gt;Nullsec should be dangerous
---
&gt;The higher the risk the higher the reward.
---
Rewards are trash unless you're flying something better than a VNI though. Consider being from a small corp and not having a capital fleet to save you. Why would you bother ratting or mining when you'll just feed kills to the 100 man Kiki fleets or cloaky campers. 
---
&gt;The economy is probably going yo get better now that more ships are dying and it’s more dangerous to be out there. 
---
Perhaps. If it does, maybe risk/reward will be balanced. Currently it's not. 
---
&gt;Honestly, if you want a risk-free activity, move to highsec or lowsec.
---
I never said I did. I am of the opinion it's slightly unbalanced at the moment though. That's why I'd welcome attackers having to scan anoms down. That doesn't make it risk free for miners or ratters.
---
Go to Kalevala, Horde is forbidden from dropping on people.
---
Well it is true isnt it? All you "hard" PvPers are the ones bitching on reddit right? Like its literally all you guys do. Yet have the nerve to say "harden the fuck up" to others. 
---
Come on man. Atleast dont be openly hypocritical, hide it. Like politicians.
---
You will die alot, so expect it. People fly expensive ships with blinged out pods, so that they never have a red on their killboard. Just keep trying, join a FW corp to fund you some ships.
---
Another cry for attention :boom:
---
Except local didn't stop you from logging in. What we can probably both agree on is that is was more likely something like -4000 and +2000 and the question is, is that worth it. This heralds back to my original point of, there is no way CCP could make an informed decision with 5 days of data. How long are those 2000 going to stay, how long are those 4000 going to stay away. CCP has no way of knowing that and making a decision of this level requires more data. But apparently saying 'musn't be to hasty' is blasphemy to people who insist local must die.
---
I would think you would have to add a fourth main problem: the astronomical amount of isk generated in NS through PvE activities that have remained unchecked for years...until recently. Too much success by players, too little planning by CCP has made this part of the problem so critical.
---
Ohh nooooeees, nooo red!
---
probably the banning of bots and making it more difficult to VNI afk rat thx to nerfs
---
DED sites - I think that’s what you are looking for.
---
You're correct about bubbles only in null and jspace, I was thinking that it was a bit weird to bubble camp the hs exit. If you want to exit the wormhole, just warp in at range (like 100km) and you won't get dragged in the bubble. You can see the gatecamp, so just go watch Netflix for a while and come back when the bubble camp is gone. If people are bubbling the hs for people that come in the wormhole, I find that a bit weird since they pretty much have to alpha you off the field. I mean, it'll happen for explorers and maybe asteros, but it won't work on anything bigger.
---
 There is no point in having 30k players online, when none of them will interact with hostiles whereas its better to have 15k players when all of those interact with hostiles " if my preferred activity in EVE is small gang roaming to blow shit up and that's all I care about.
---
There, fixed it for you.
---
If only we could spread the glorious embrace of WH space even further.
---
Goons deployed to Pure Blind, panfam went on the defensive.
---
And you consent to having a cap dropped on you whenever you undock.

You're still allowed to complain though aren't you.
---
Cant already sold my nyx and avatar.
---
I don’t. :)
---
Nice video, Nice to see creative players
---
I love this astero fit :)
---
Nope already gave a fair amount of shit to corp mates.
---
If you think ratting in wormholes is perfectly safe, then i have some news for you...
---
Absolutely. If you just took off local, it would just kind of... gimp it.
---
One of the biggest gripes (the only gripe, really) I have with the blackout is that people who live in that null space have no real way to counter the blackout outside of hardcore 24/7 intelligence (which as my experience with the eve community would tell me, means "bots" more than "hard work"). 
---
Whether this is a good thing ultimately and it should not have a counter is frankly beyond me, I'm not a null-sec player, I don't think I can really give a hard opinion on it.
---
I disagree with "unpredictable". Some things are good because they are a bit more predictable, like FW warfare, and I think a good increase in LS content alone would make people slowly move to low sec. IMO, a new player should be first pushed towards low sec, not null sec, where they get burned out F1ing and ~~vexor~~ myrmidon ratting.
---
&gt;Ore re-balance to bring some profit to lowsec mining, improvements to FW and rewards, maybe some low to mid end moon mining in lowsec and a pass on loot drops and NPC spawns in lowsec, maybe some nice anomolies too. Maybe making some resources unique to lowsec would be interesting too.
---
yes please! pls pls pls. As of now the only real things to do in low sec is make space drugs for fun, hunt mordus, clone soldiers and level 5s/fw missions (which in their own right are extremely lucrative, but lvl 5s will be nerfed very hard after the impetus glamourex boosters expire).
---
&gt; ban supers from lowsec and only allow covert cynos, forcing regular capitals to use stargates
---
This could be cool, but like you said, please don't kill jump freighters. Think of the solos. That said I support not being able to cyno combat capitals, at least in FW space. This would make moving capitals hell though, which could be a good thing.
---
Regarding supers - I don't have enough knowledge on them to really comment.
---
&gt;MC dropped five motherships ...
---
F.
---
Has CCP even given a clear answer about what they're trying to accomplish, aside from just throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks?
---
I imagine it will be a quest/challenge to complete that will award the SP, so it'll be doable once a day.
---
I haven't had my cloaky camping alt logged in either.  Instead of leaving him logged in 23 hours a day I can just log it on when I actually want to do something with it.
---
If I can't afk mine on 12 rorquals with my dick in one hand and a big gulp in the other why should i even log in?
---
I would highly recommend flying with a fleet as it is far more fun and you never know what friends you will make.
---
Honestly the whole thing is dumb you can see the average number of players over a 30 min period in the map. Local showed both names and number of players in the system at anyone time a better system was local only counts number of stargate jumps to determine a current number of players. If you log in system or use a wormhole or a ship mounted  jumpdrive/bridge the number does not update. A structure with a like the jump bridges that provide more accurate numbers could then be implemented with a separate one that just looks at the names of people in space that has to be paired with the former.
---
Well the rest of this place does, so consider it a generalisation.
---
One dude said he was going to unsubscribe his 47 accounts. How many of these were logged in at the same time? How many multiboxers are currently not playing? I bet the number of actual players is actually higher.
---
I think you have acdentally posted on the Eve reddit - COD is that way ----&gt;
---
Speaking purely of data it’s pretty dodgy that CCP is polluting the dataset during the blackout with the specials and stuff that’s going on.  
---
I’d rather a true unpolluted dataset for a real comparison.   Putting things like this 3 months omega and 3 MTV’s for $1 thing are going to push up the subs during the period and make that data worthless to compare
---
Sure is. But you understand why I present it right? Many Eve trillionaires made their isk out of game, casinos, injectors, character sales and so on. Totally safe. Which means that income to risk isnt always an easy equation.
---
None of the activities you have presented are hard man. Superratting isnt rorq mining, it requires actual effort.
---
You could just rat in a PvP fit. I used to run ded sites in a PvP fit macharial, a Corp mate does them in a PvP fit rattlesnake. I’ve died to PvP fit vexor navy’s running anoms so it can be done.
---
Lol:)
---
ah well it's always worth a shot. enjoy your increased amount of free time now that you left eve!
---
Why did you choose to win eve?  Just over the blackout?
---
On first point, yeah if it's a roaming gang a d-scan bot on gate will save a bot, but we're talking about logoff trap. If you're watching super/carrier/juicy target ratting and cloak up and wait for bot to return to krabbing, sending tackle and cynos to its site while it's midwarp, that bot is fucked. You don't need to go to the autistic levels AUTZ crew/DPCI crew have gone to in the last few years to catch it, it's a joke.
---
And for second point, I don't really have a strong opinion/care about the impact this will have on bots. If it hinders the ability to bot, that's great, but i'm overall happy with a generic shake-up to null gameplay, because it has been fucked for last 2~ years and will get even worse if nothing is done.
---
Yeah, the cloaky camping alt I used to have logged in 23 hours a day.  Now I only have it logged in when I'm *interacting* with other players.
---
Is that difference hurting the game?  Because it's hurting the concurrent player count.
---
I mean for this entire thread to be my EVE epitaph.  I want to feel  like my 14 years playing this game wasn't a wasted investment, that at least I might be able to stir the brainstorming enough that there are real ideas that bring improvement.  I also wanted to at least try to make people think about whether a few extra spaceship explosions is worth alienating what may be a substantial group of players, because to my mind when you start excluding groups from the table on any basis at all something gets lost.
---
I'm not here to tear down.  I'm here to build, both individually and in a larger sense, and I think that attitude more than anything else defines the main disconnect between players in the game right now.
---
I'll take 10k total people active out in space doing stuff than 30k, when 25k of those are bots or dock up the second anyone comes within 30 jumps.
---
but but but...muh pvp
---
Yea, let's blame the people and ignore the huge wealth disparity that exists in this country. It's THEIR fault they can't just "pull themselves up by their bootstraps" and get a jobby-job off the jobby-job tree. 
---
Why is it crazy to demand reasonable working conditions for all workers? 
---
What do you like about Amazon? What makes them a "good" company to you?
---
I only use Eve preview, I've dumped all the other 3rd party stuff after they finally made an ingame fitting tool, been comfortable with the ingame map for a while, ect.
---
Also i use that asset window constantly
---
lol the current stats in eve-offline don't look anything like this screenshot :D
---
nice spin.
---
BoB will go down some day.  I bet goons can take them.  And maybe someday PL won't be able to drop supers on anything halfway across the galaxy with a jump drive.
---
I heard some people actually do missions, to me this is bizzare as all fuck
---
&gt;the carebeariest of carebears.
---
Except, they're not, really.  
---
They purposefully live in an easily accessible region, in jump range of large swaths of lowsec, where everyone else comes to roam when they can't find anything going on anywhere else, where the buff guys on the beach regularly roll by to knock over their sandcastles and kick sand on them while their poor g/f watches in distress, all while adhering to a system of PvP where they can't shoot unless shot at first, and on top of all of that, welcome in strangers, so you can't really tell who is someone just doing their own thing, or is out hunting you.  
---
There is no super umbrella, so if you want to do something like rorqual mine, you're taking a pretty large risk, large enough of a risk that most Eve players will just call you "stupid" for doing so.  
---
I haven't been in Provi for about a year now, but I can't even imagine how the bears that do live there are handling having no local, because there's so many people there doing their own thing, so seeing some rando ship on dscan is a regular occurrence, and there almost never is going to be someone coming in time to save your ass if you get tackled in an anom.  
---
Not saying that they're a bunch of l33t PvPers, but if you live there, you pretty much have to PvP on a daily basis, and much of it is surprise PvP.
---
My original comment was about how long you’ve played and what you listed as your activities during that time and your response to it was:
---
&gt; I would think any company would value everyone equally. Especially one that has dropped money on their product.
---
Don’t be disingenuous.
---
Per zkill, losses of mining rorquals have fallen during the blackout.
---
Ratting Nyx's are being lost at a lower level as well.
---
Whatever floats your boat man, i died to a vni trap, i killed others, died to a gatecamp on the outgate cause i wasnt aware other people where there had a sudden escalation in detorid where a bjorn fleet ganked our retris. But i had fun. As many others did, plus zkill stats are on the roof after the km pull which supports my view. We want a vibrant space where unexpected things happen and people fight you in every corner if others just want to make isk with 0.5sec perfect intel then too bad for them, i hope ccp doesnt fuck it up with observatories.
---
I never said that I thought no change was necessary.  I was trying to point out that the current implementation wasn't fair and try to enumerate additional changes that could make this idea more fair but also leave null more dangerous.
---
Lack of local isn't why I'm winning EVE.  The attitude from the devs and the community about this one sided change when it literally will make the problems with null sec engagement worse not better is why I'm calling it done.
---
You’re not required to mash dscan.
---
We do all the time. In fact many of us are counting on it.
---
Bye
---
Ventures aren't really the problem here, dplexing is the problem. You should have to shoot something to deplex, or alternatively deplexing should be completely passive and not a source of LP.
---
Comparing the sort of mildly offensive ribbing that happens in this video game forum to the sociocultural shifts that incite a people to genocide is a little more than 'overly dramatic'. It's absurd on a level that should seriously concern you.
---
More time to hit the gym bro.
---
I used to be one of those people that ratted with subcaps because I hate ratting with caps. With no local, I have decided to refit my supers and have one ratting super. Subcaps can't last long enough on grid to survive a cyno cycle. I also am subbing a rorqual pilot, I fucking hate mining, but if the content in eve is going to be reactionary, I may as well mine some ore while I wait for these  pvpers to eat shit but a blob of supers.
---
No way he’s a bitter using outside programs and even ccp disabled it.
---
By coward you mean that guys hunting down unarmed ships?
---
catfishing
---
As a nullsec bloc member you should love it too - makes it easier to get kills in enemy space as well as form response fleets to gangs roaming about in Legacy space. I thought I would hate it too but it's given the game the meaning that it originally had
---
It amazes me that people do not realize gate cloak holds for 1 FULL 60 second period.
---
Oof, your faction standing might be too low.
---
Join whichever faction you have over 0 standing w/ then :)
---
I'm not a "hard" PvPer.  Like most pvpers, I spend a good bit of time in eve doing other things as well, like industry and killing NPCs.  And yes, I absolutely feel entitled / justified / correct, when I tell sobbing null pve-focused players to harden the fuck up.  Changes to eve over the last few years that have worked in favor of pve centric null groups have lead to the stagnation of the game and shrinkage of the playerbase. Even in light of these generally accepted observations, many nullbears seem content, giddy even, about contributing to the death of the game. 
---
 The typical response from the community regarding this change seems pretty positive, and has brought some long-afk pvpers back to the game. That excites me.  If I'm not going to apologize for that.  If that's what you're waiting for, you're setting yourself up for disappointment.
---
Yeah, that would have been total BS.
---
He is not encouraging it. CCP are. He just called it out.
---
How stupid do you have to be to think that the removal of automatic instantaneous alerts of enemy presence is a crutch to the people that have to actively hunt you
---
The game was doing something for you without any effort on your part. It was a crutch for lazy people who want easy-mode gameplay. 
---
There are still many ways for you to avoid ganks. You just have to play the game
---
anyone surprised? i mean when even big blocks tell their members to not rat/do not undock big toys... thats whats happening
---
Seems normal to me?
---
Tell me about effort when you haul your billions to jita, or you have to convert stuff by giving the agent other stuff that you need to make a faction module, when lp prices fluctuate that hard that in 3 days the isk you could have potentially make is halfed in value. And perhaps easy is a wrong word, lets use the word convenient, its convenient to convert hours to direct isk, convenient to have a super umbrella protecting you and convenient to have massive coalition wide out of game tools that report a hostile 3 regions out. Man its broken let em fix it
---
Why did the wormholer cross the road?
---
To tell the guy on the other side that he's a wormholer
---
I wouldn't because I rely on those 'spineless' people for my content, so lower player-count means less content for me.
---
In a perfect world, not having local is healthier for the game but given the game's mechanics and how risk averse the community is, null regions other than those belonging to large blocs are completely dead now.
---
News flash, companies do not lower prices to match other countries. They up the price of the countries that are out of line. As I said bitching about it will only help fuck over your mate, you are gaining zero from this post.
---
Online concurrent players is the shittiest metric to judge success by because people can no longer safely 50 box rorquals all day. I fully expected there to be a drop both from the krabbing and Botting playerbase.
---
It’s over man.  Basically at this point if we’re gonna expend this effort we might as well go into wormholes.
---
Human psychology doesnt really give a shit about where its done. And it always starts the same way, like you are doing right now. Brushing it of as "mildly offensive ribbing". Think the ribbing part is always there, bullies in school just casually "ribbing" the nerds and so on.
---
But considering "Burn NS" has been in action for few days now, is it really that farstretched? People being "mildly offensive" which then escalates to the wish to destroy all that is something? Telling krabbers to leave the game which is the for the game as dying irl, you stop to exist in that place.
---
You should read some books, can recommend some. It will perhaps make you see things you didnt before.
---
Hey I don't know if you're (still?) a community manager but this is the best community interaction I've seen between a game company and their community. Keep up the good work.
---
Get out of here with your *logic*
---
Lol, dude, you are ignorant for reals.
---
I can’t tell what you’re trying to say and doing think you can either.
---
Yes. But the description of the region says that serpentis still own ORE
---
For you I'd suggest joining EVE-Scout/Signal Cartel. This game is a lot better with people to play with, otherwise it's kinda just like playing Windows 95 as a game.
---
As a doornail
---
And I could have gotten on board with it, if the "blackout" had killed viewing ADM levels and activity, pilots in space, NPC kills, jumps, ship kills, and all kinds of other statistics from being viewed in the game or on third party websites.  You know, make it more like an actual wormhole except with persistent connections and cynos.  Still would have a distinct flavor, more dangerous, more explosions, but more *fair*.
---
IDK why I ever post anything in this sub reddit.. LOL its all trolls and nerds who would over analyze your grammer and word usage insted of read something and offer an intelligent reply..
---
Aaaaagh fuckin tease
---
I bet Falcon still plays on alts. Roaming lowsec ganking the gankers and smartbombers.
---
"The prophet still walks among us, with names we will never know."
---
 - Church of Falcon.
---
All hail Falcon.
---
&gt;And I hear HS has the highest concentration of bots
---
Based on what? Do you have any shred of evidence that botting actually went down?
---
&gt;But I can tell you this, bots started changing when the drifters showed up.
---
&gt; Im fairly certain most have already transitioned into other activities.
---
&gt;* Capital umbrellas without fucking super pilots in the butthole.
---
Increase fighter MWD cooldown to 4 minutes.  Now supers are still strong but subcaps have easy counterplay.
---
Significantly increase the sig radius of all capitals and reduce tracking of capital guns.
---
&gt;* Structure proliferation which is literally cancer.
---
Yeah.  Can't just reduce the number because industry and moon mining require a lot of structures.  It'd be nice if there were a way to kill more than one at a time though.
---
&gt;* Prevening TQ from becoming Serenity ala goons and legacy.
---
Never seems to last. Two years ago it was goons and PLNC. Why does NC. have the dot?  What happened to BoB?  Where's PL?
---
&gt;* Skynet CTAs being what qualifies as a B-5RB now.
---
I don't know what this means.
---
&gt;Among many issues that drives away a lot of the usd plexers which CCP cares about the most.
---
If they make the game fun it will draw in more players than they lose in botting income. It may take some time.
---
I honestly don't see a trend. What conclusion are you making and why not try to eloborate on your post a little?
---
Jeez
---
odd for them to do this during the nullsec blackout, seems like it might fudge the numbers on how successful that is.
---
Oh scoots.  Stop projecting
---
I would actually suggest joining a reputable one. Corporations often throw quite a lot of free stuff the way of new players to get them started.
---
I think it is positive for both new and old players. They need more events and give people incentive to go out and take risks.
---
This is probably the worst advice in the current age of difficult null sec life
---
I'm dead serious. D-scan is trivial as fuck to use, you shouldn't be able to get basic immunity to everything from it. As long as you use all your other 'best practices' (staying aligned and whatnot) you still have a ton of opportunity to get away.
---
Hi sec doesn’t mean you can’t be blown up, it just means whoever did it is also all but guaranteed to get blown up by CONCORD as well.
---
It’s not called suicide ganking for no reason.
---
&gt;ones who can't fly a Super or Rorq need to do something other than rat or mine to make isk in null, like buy plex and boosters to get into a super or rorq
---
Maybe this was the real intention? /tinfoilhat
---
But the bot on the gate has already registered you coming in. Is it really farfetched that it will send commands to stop all activity until its spotted the neut leaving?
---
It was never hard to catch a bot with logoff traps, not even real people. Thats the main way of doing it isnt it?
---
On that we agree, but no local isnt the fix. Tons of other shit needs to be fixed but no local wont have the long term effect people think it will. It wouldnt make sense if it did.
---
A gate rat shit out 400k just now
---
I dont think you know what words mean
---
Nope, lots of great people in nullsec.
---
This is carebear complaints that want things as easy as possible regardless of what it means for the game.
---
Go read the OP again.
---
Yes, perfect intel is *terrible* for small active alliances. /s
---
As someone who was part of VETO, I would resub in an instant if Falcon got any sort of executive control over EVE's design.
---
Some more explanation of your thoughts would be great. And why you chose downtime today would be worth some words, too. 
---
Numbers look lower than in a year to year comparison but let’s wait how the current game changes impact player retention and return of players. Especially after the summer.
---
I talked about our ideals for companies, not necessarily the reality.
---
But modern cpanies absolutely care about 2 years. Lots of modern companies engage in loss-leading activities because it's made up in the long term.
---
shout out to this man right here.
---
Why do you need to get loot out? Didnt you hear, you should only be pvping
---
Well... to be fair...
---
It’s playing this game while mashing a keybind as if it’s wow.  
---
But thanks for playing
---
Already replaced....
---
Yes, people that aren't paying attention will get caught even by bad "gankers".
---
But people that are paying attention are very difficult to catch. Before the black out even barely paying attention was enough to be extremely difficult to catch.
---
Now it's actually a game of cat and mouse.
---
♥
---
If you hit -5 reputation with an empire their Navy will start trying to hit you, but the faction navy’s aren’t CONCORD so it’s not a guaranteed/quick death.
---
Train diplomacy to soften negative faction hits, and repair your standings before effective hits -5 if you want to waltz through empire space without worrying about getting shot at.
---
There is the Sisters of Eve epic arc you can run every 3 months to get a decent standing gain with one of the four empires of your choosing, so if you ever need a (fairly) quick way to repair standing then run it and choose the empire you need an increase from on the last mission of the arc. If you every get REALLY fucked up just look up The Plan for a guide on repairing standings.
---
Staying aligned in a Rorq? Or like anything but a carrier/super? Its simply not viable man. Best practices has always been "watch local". For rorqs and excavators its been the only practice. So remove cloaks and d-scan immunity and there is atleast one counter. Right now, there is zero to those. And keep in mind, WHs dont have cynos. You cant just jump in a ton of dreads ontop of you without any warning right?
---
&gt; not a good time to turbokrab
---
HOW DARE YOU
---
I remember the reset the blues post on the internal boards. Those were good times.
---
Yup, still the Senior Community Manager for CCP :)
---
It was clearly not a token. They always list the token or other items directly.
---
Yes, this change in itself is unfair because it is making an effort to correct an unfair balance in the initial case.
---
You don't need net zero changes when the problem is a current imbalance.
---
Holy shit Mutnin, I remember you man. I only lurk these days, EVE is not my game anymore. But it's super cool to see some of the other guys are still lurking around here!
---
That's the plan! &lt;3
---
Exactly.
---
Ratting super losses are normal, too.
---
Even with blackout, you are quite happy being in a super making supers in an umbrella made out of supers.
---
We're seeing a lot of hurf-blurf by small gang types, who are still useless against supercap proliferation in blocs that drives supercap proliferation by blocs.
---
You should throw that my way so I can snag Mooya and Alvey for it too.
---
I miss Celestial Apocalypse - some great times sparring with you boys!
---
Wait I thought CCP fired their community team. Did /r/eve lie to me?
---
Ya think...  
---
A lot of the metrics use the concurrent logged on which I’m not sure if that means characters passed the selection screen or if at the selection screen.  
---
Either way just log on collect reward then that gives you the ability then to click the little thumbs down on your wait out 👌👍
---
No regrets running Gallente Navy missions against the Amarr, those slavers can rot and I have no need to piss about in their space.
---
Newbros would be wise to keep Caldari standings above -5 if they don’t want to blockade run every time they visit Jita though.
---
Ive already answered that. As much as you do.
---
Thats anecdotal and the third one is as well. But you presented your statement as fact, I presented mine as what Ive seen. See the workaround:)
---
Ye, cause bot handlers just decided to quit their daytime jobs, which is bot handling because of an event. Does that sound reasonable to you?
---
....there's no point in having a more successful game with more active players if those players aren't playing the way YOU think they should?
---
Spoiler alert: a game with 30k players who each "interact" with you half as often is a far more successful game, with a much brighter future, than a game with 15k players who play the way YOU think they should.
---
Also, people in favor of shoving imbalanced pvp down everyone's throat keep throwing that word "interact" around; it doesn't mean what you think it does. There are many, many forms of interaction other than getting to faceroll someone to death in a one-sided fight because real life distracted him or her for a few seconds.
---
It makes most sense to do it like this.
---
The factions relief on Concord for this
---
Like I said, any opinion saluted by people like you will make the game worse, not better.
---
Like any of us know what to do with a vagina.
---
How is that different?
---
How are horde and bosons made worse by no local?
---
Nah, just have it limited to fleet members within &lt;x&gt; meters.
---
The benefit of a wake portal is as the ships wouldn't be using their own jump drives, you could apply the same range / fatigue stats as the main ship.
---
JF's get a fatigue reduction. If you had an escort fleet following them through via normal means (covert jump bridge + blops bridge) the escort would very quickly hit fatigue limits, even though the JF was fine.
---
With rorqs ? Yeah, you can. Just swap out the excavators for miner 2s.
---
at least i dont have to wait pings to have good killmails.
---
*mashing that keybind for years.*
---
Damn... how much?
---
Most stupid thing Ive ever read
---
Ahh, a bot-aspirant.
---
What if I say the same about you?
---
Make actual arguments please.
---
So you really think that not having scanner arrays tracking every single grain of asteroid dust is smart from any perspective?
---
Sounds like it's not just good for the game, but good for you too.
---
It's highly controversial, but in all honestly I'd probably kill asset safety completely or heavily gimp it if it was up to me. I'd also cap the amount of storage space that's in each type of structure, with standup modules to give more hangar space.
---
I'd also get rid of tethering for anything smaller than a supercap, and have tethering become mooring for supers. Only XL structures would have mooring space, and it'd be limited to a certain number at a time per structure, with the ships visibly in gravdock outside so they were visible.
---
Yes, it'd mean a lot of nullsec entities would flood back to living from NPC stations, but then I'd probably look to make changes to those too and how they work, like capping their capacity for storing stuff too.
---
Again, all savage and terrible ideas.
---
None of this will prove itself out till we’re a few weeks in (and passed this shit SP event they just announced).  Way to put your finger on the scale ccp.
---
Nah man, I sold it at the Fanfest 2011 Charity Auction... it made a few hundred bucks for charity!
---
Not bad for a $5 beanie :D
---
Man you're sense but it's ok bigblocs don't attract the brightest
---
We have several.
---
Yes, it's for a second training queue.  As always, you can pause one character and start training another.
---
As it should be - I miss flying alongside EST.
---
I'll pass your feedback on.
---
There's a strong argument that most fights, especially those which aren't arranged, are often won or lost when the forces on each side undock.  When you know in local how many people are there, everyone can do the math, and one side or the other may just leave.  Without local, you're hiding a little more information, and it's more likely that both sides will think they  have a hidden asset to turn the fight.
---
One thing I will admit is more than a little unfair, however much I have enjoyed it, though, is covert ops cynos: you're no longer betrayed by the entry spike, so you can silently bridge an entire fleet in to surprise people.  There isn't an increase in jumps, nobody's even running any gatecamps except for the initial entry that's probably a nullified T3, and you can move in, strike, fade into the night and come back for more in 5 or 10 minutes if you see another enticing target.
---
If I had to bet, we'll see a new anchorable structure, fuelled by something that's primarily bought with plex, that provides a local-equivalent.
---
Oh, and more effort by blocs to get people into supers and rorquals (as of now, an entry-level rorq is 2 months worth of Plex, yeah ?).
---
Seriously dude that’s awesome keep it up. I remember my first solo kill vs a falcon. Good times
---
At least find a new (if possible not so fucking stupid) argument to bitch about it.
---
I also got my lazy ass afk ratting ruined. It was about fucking time.
---
That's CCP's MO, alright. Throw in one big feature to solve a problem caused by players using some previous feature in a way they didn't expect. Then, let it fester (and be abused) until they finally debut another feature that they hope will solve the new problem. It rarely does. The next time CCP figures out how to predict the consequences of changes before they make them will be the first. Remember when nullsec anomalies became an endless stream of ore and rat bounties? They wanted to make it so that powerful alliances didn't have to conquer half a dozen regions to earn money. They figured that, once the big boys pulled back, there'd be room for new players in null and content would happen. Instead, rich and powerful alliances became obscenely rich and their 'old' space just got handed over to their pals so they could get obscenely rich, too.  Meanwhile, the primary driver of nullsec conquest (taking more space) became pointless at the same time that actually taking that space became harder and harder.
---
To be fair, I don't know what CCP's actually trying to accomplish with the blackout, so it's hard to judge how effective it is. Everybody has been content to see their own agendas in the change, but CCP has not - to my knowledge - ever said what they're trying to accomplish. Falcon doesn't count; he's just a mouthpiece, not a decision maker. However, with the benefit of 13+ years of experience in nearly every aspect of the game, I can bet that I know what this WILL do: Large, organized and established alliances will experience a modest but temporary dip in income. Then someone will figure out a new paradigm to minimize risk and maximize reward and the spice will flow once again. Sure, we'll lose idiots here and there; but idiots have always died like idiots. As long as they're losing their own personal shit, the alliance isn't out anything but one more supercap (that probably didn't even x up for fleets anyway). If someone quits because his Titan got killed after he couldn't see a cyno recon before it it was too late, it's no skin off our back; plenty more where he came from. In a smaller alliance, that Titan would be sorely missed and much more difficult to replace. 
---
I expect that the new nullsec paradigm will be to "go heavy," consolidating into large mining ops (probably moon mining ops guarded by supercaps,) which will be a massive barrier to entry for smaller alliances that want to break into nullsec. Alliances that are powerful enough to adapt to the new changes (as we have already done for the most part) will both protect their own members ***and prey on those who don't***. The powerful will get more powerful; everyone else will get devoured. "So sorry that your dinky alliance can't protect your Rorqual, but at least Karmafleet is recruiting. Did you know that most of ***our*** hunters are getting strat op SRP? It's true!" 
---
Unless CCP does more than just blackout out local, I don't think this will a change that is bad for ***our*** game; I think it'll be bad for ***the*** game. If all of those free-intel services went offline with local, that would be a big improvement; but it wouldn't do a thing to prevent big and powerful alliances from becoming bigger and more powerful. It's just going to hurt individuals and alliances that can't afford to adjust. I've long been an advocate for cutting off the infinite spawning of both mining an ratting anomalies. Then alliances will have an incentive to take more space to make more isk. With a bit of luck, they'll even have the incentive to take more space than they can defend and - gods be praised - content will happen.
---
that's great advice, great post there buddy.   Keep it up !
---
I'm at least reasonably well read, but thanks. Pretending that someone who disagrees with you is just less educated isn't very enlightened though. My entire point is that there are gradients of hostility. While they, of course, exist on a continuum without real divisions, we can quite clearly make distinctions between gradients. Aggressiveness is even somewhat healthy in the right context and through the right mediums of expression. This mild ribbing will always stay at that level without other factors or catalysts. Burn null is definitely a sentiment, quite mirrored by the goon burn HS. Since these aggressive, hostile, attitudes are being expressed in a game, a place designed for escapism and to let people blow off the steam and pressure that builds up in real life, I think they are quite appropriately expressed in this environment.
---
Personally, I'd remove the ability for the rorqual to mine at all. I'd also completely delete the panic button too, I don't like it personally.
---
I'd then beef up the rorqual to be a lot tougher, and to serve as a mining foreman platform and a mobile refinery. It'd basically be an ore refining and ore/mineral compression platform for use in the field that gave mining bonuses to barges.
---
Then of course, people would start mining in Orcas, so I'd remove their ability to mine too, and make them a dedicated compressed ore and mineral hauler with bonuses to carrying compressed resources.
---
I'd rather see a world where barges are the ships that are doing the actual mining, and there's a few support hulls needed to get max yield out of them - promotes engagement between people and larger groups collaborating.
---
Good thing y'all aren't wormholers then right?
---
~~please don't send mei~~
---
Oh, yeah. Definitely, and it's something that enabled all the other problems to get as bad as they currently are.
---
大丈夫？
---
Is the dip actually at April 2016 essentially WWB?  for a conflict that was essentially over after M-O, its weird to see how major a spike in ship kills were concurrent with that event.
---
Yes. I’ve been yelling this for months. Removr asset recovery from nullsec. Magical teleportation of assets should not be a game mechanic. Nullsec should be dangerous. Nullbears get mad whenever i bring this up.
---
Personally, I was expecting an initial drop in both CCU and DAU, whether that translates into a significant drop in our MAU is still to be determined, not sure if people coming back will balance it out over time.
---
It's going to be interesting to see how it plays out for sure :)
---
should have waited a day.  2 toons would be training.
---
Kek
---
Very. 
---
Don't listen to the forum shitposters.
---
I used Eve University a lot when I was starting out: [Exploration 101](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Exploration_101).
---
I can't trust you. If it s the case they must take a lot of drug to resist to the commit hommicid each time you make a change who burn all model they make. 
---
No more seriously, i really want to see what they are doing with the ammount of data we generate (and do'nt said MER i will laught, the mer raw data contains a shitons of information, we could litterraly make a dashboard of eve activity ship by ship with that, and i'm sure you have a lot more granularity in information.)
---
Do you have simulation of eve  universe with player behaviour, make some data about kind of player and isolate some interesting group (i have see some video of a fabnfest with some video about player activity, but i mean go deeper in the analysis). 
---
I know some people (beacause it's reddit) will think i flame CCP , not the case i really want to know what they are doinf, at witch point you could use data actually. Beacause it's intersting for people who love manage play with data.
---
but muh yield
---
Have you ever in your life seen CCP being good at planning ahead? Honest question.
---
You see, in this world there's two kinds of people, my friend: Those with loaded guns and those who dig. You dig.
---
&gt;Super ratting was much more of a pain in the butt than running several VNIs/Domis/Ishtars/etc. So plenty of people who had a super still ratted in subcaps because of the level of effort.
---
Yeah right, that's why Super ratting  has been [out of order](https://forums-archive.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;m=6968205) for way over 2 years now.
---
"Super ticks are fine guys, everyone's ~~botting~~ using VNIs anyway!" /s
---
&gt; So yes, it can get worse. And it just did.
---
Did it though? You could maybe tell in a few months if blackout stayed as is, but certainly not now.
---
Nice concern trolling though. I recommend increasing the koolaid dose even further until the last braincell is properly soaked.
---
Our own version of Data is Beautiful, really tells a story.
---
Jesus, RIP jump frieghters then
---
Done!
---
Correct. You get one that lasts three months. If you want another you have to acquire it separately.
---
Putting words in my mouth.  Blocking the other statistics and removing local wouldn't be "net zero" and I never attempted to indicate that it would be.
---
I don't see how anybody could even begin to argue that removing the statistics like they did for wormholes, and universally available ADM info, along with local chat, is a "net zero".  Null still gets more dangerous, significantly so.  But in that case the hunters actually have to put some effort into it.  That might have been a set of changes the community could have accepted as a whole.
---
A couple of us made it through the cull of '17.
---
We're in the process of bringing a third on board at present.
---
You can dscan from gate cloak without appearing in local until you break gate cloak.
---
you're actually going with the assumption that every person in null is using a bot which isn't true...
---
on the other hand i doubt anyone can convince you of that fact :D
---
They've somehow had a successful MMO for 16 years.
---
So clearly they aren't that shit at it.
---
I wanted the old killmails back, the ones which only showed you half the fit. Put a delay on them. Also blackout lowsec. But make the delay shorter. Maybe local on a timer?
---
Yeah, agreed on the covert cynos. There's not a lot of counterplay involved with them right now; the primary counterplay in question being "just be in a capital ship lol."
---
Bots arent success, neither are isk inflators. You can always fight back thats what 00 is about free unlimited pvp, lawless space etc plus the mechanics are made to help the defender, bait them kill them camp them show them that in your space they will have a hard time. If you dont like danger highsec is that way where good opd concord will at least avenge you, plus if you dont own structures you cant be wardecked
---
20k less bots is good.
---
Cool bye
---
Boy, someone *really* hasn't been watching EvE unfold in the last decade.
---
You are very conveniently forgetting 2 things. One, NS has been complaining far more than you. CSM is mostly NS you know. CCP hasnt given a shit. Most of the NS people I talk have been complaining, CCP hasnt given a shit. And now you are presenting it as if we wanted the rorquals, we wanted fozzie sov, we wanted triple cyno jammers, we wanted a million fking citadels that cost nothing. Thats fking bullshit.
---
Second aspect is you think we want it safer. We dont mind risk, u know why? Cause we are not risk averse PvPers with no isk to lose. For us, losing isk means nothing as long as there is content. Cause its fking boooooring. The boredom in deep null is mindnumbing. So much so that I randomly suicide ships just so I can feel something.

We want changes, but not moronic ones. The game revolves around checks and balances. For every action a reaction is possible. You dont wanna get wardecced, stay in NPC corp (used to be), you dont wanna get ganked in your hauler on your way to jita, lower the cargo and bla bla, you dont wanna lose your excavators pull then in when neuts are in system and bla bla bla.
---
Action, reaction. If you play it right you can protect yourself. This went all ways, for all things. Except for 1, cloaky camping. No recourse for that which makes it a shit mechanic. You cant, with no amount of skill/effort find a cloaky camper. 2, no local. People say d-scan but forget that certain shiptypes dont show up. Also here, no amount of skill/effort will save help you.
---
I truly despise everything in which my personal knowledge, skill and effort is irrelevant. And if you are a true Eve player you will get what Im talking about and accept that things that fall into that category goes against the spirit of what Eve is. One person, one capsuleer, in a dark and complicated universe making their own journey. With time, skill and effort you will become better and better.
---
I will never ask anyone for an apology for having an opinion, but I will always ask people to be open-minded and try to put themselves in other peoples shoes.
---
Honestly I and most of my friends gave up roaming null because it was a complete waste of time. everyone docked up instantly or had un-engagable fleets waiting in advance for you.
---
Last couple of days have been much more fun, catching a couple of people, running into gate camps, being able to avoid or escape other gangs.
---
Thats what CCP do by encouraging roaming
---
&gt; Blocking the other statistics and removing local wouldn't be "net zero" and I never attempted to indicate that it would be.
---
But you said this:
---
&gt; I called this change unfair without making adjustments elsewhere
---
Which is the same thing.
---
Girls lie, but zkill doesn't
---
You can train your other two character slots into Planetary Interaction or ratting alts.
---
It can be nice to have your main always ready for combat after a relog.
---
You are absolutely correct, though I don't see how this is going to change that for the alliances that are making most of that money now. it really just gives us incentive to mess with everyone else's income.
---
Lol the first comment was a super cap FC from goons crying about it. haha
---
So... have people that can support your Rorq if you get jumped? Any other ratting ship, yeah, that's completely viable with. Or, you know... watch your gates, too.
---
Nothing will ever be foolproof and it shouldn't be, sometimes shit should just happen and ships should just die.
---
They asked a question? I answered based on my knowledge. And if Vince is FCing regularly recently then thats cool, but toward the beginning of the year he wasn't that active. And Travis has shown up, as i stated, occasionally, and done a thing. He is not active by any means.
---
That's not a yes.
---
You mean the Alliance Tournament?
---
Try Ushra’khan (Minmatar), Local is Primary (Amarr) or any FW corps. They will help you with cheap ships and best way to learn (and get a kill or two) is definitely in fleets. 
---
In meantime try and watch EVELOG (Jebi Vjetar) or Blights Wretch on twitch/YouTube. Solo pvp’ers and good helpful guys.
---
Hunt people ratting in bling smartbombing Machs. Kill them and scoop loot.
---
You could actually look at the numbers and zkill in the non-bot regions, or I guess you can just throw out anecdotes about your explo corp mate lol.
---
&gt; I can't trust you. If it s the case they must take a lot of drug to resist to the commit hommicid each time you make a change who burn all model they make.
---
​Believe it or not, we tend to make data driven decisions with input from our data team, so they're usually fine with it.
---
&gt; No more seriously, i really want to see what they are doing with the ammount of data we generate (and do'nt said MER i will laught, the mer raw data contains a shitons of information, we could litterraly make a dashboard of eve activity ship by ship with that, and i'm sure you have a lot more granularity in information.)
---
We have literally hundreds of internal dashboards that we use to monitor TQ, the community and the health of the game. If someone wants a specific one, all we do is ask, or ask for a pool of data, and we can get it. Sharing is pretty liberal internally, and it's awesome to get whatever you need.
---
​
---
&gt; Do you have simulation of eve universe with player behaviour, make some data about kind of player and isolate some interesting group (i have see some video of a fabnfest with some video about player activity, but i mean go deeper in the analysis).
---
Simulations rarely take into account how insanely randomly you guys behave. We can predict what's going to happen with reasonable accuracy, but you guys usually screw that up for us and throw a curve ball. :P
---
&gt; I know some people (beacause it's reddit) will think i flame CCP , not the case i really want to know what they are doing, at witch point you could use data actually. Beacause it's intersting for people who love manage play with data.
---
Our data team are super visible and super busy most of the time internally - they're doing everything from assisting executive management with data requests down to helping community out with stuff too :)
---
Sounds like your defenseless friend is just too young for nullsec.  You ever heard of "endgame content?"
---
Dissertation-level meta gaming. I always like to think back to Aryth &amp; team’s Forex manip: 
---
“If you’re holding Mechanical Engineering or Minmatar Starship Engineering datacores, you have our condolences as we roll around in literal Scrooge McDuck towers full of your isk.”

Banning cynos in low-sec would destroy the economy... No one would gate a freighter anymore, and everything qould have to be moved by something like a DST or smaller outside of High-Sec. Null corps (which make up a vast majority of players) would throw a shit fit.
---
bruh no local = can't hold sov? lmao Yes I know exactly what goes into holding sov and not having local will literally affect it none. It affects afk krabbers and bots.
---
I think removing asset recovery will make the game better. Make nullsec dangerous again. I hate the “i want to leave the game for 6 months and still keep all my stuff” 
---
Don’t go to nullsec if you’re gonna fucking leave the game for 6 fucking months.
---
No thats were we will never agree. Skill, knowledge and effort has always mattered in Eve. Always. It was never about luck. Sure, you fk up you might lose a ship. But not if you do everything right.
---
And for Rorqs, the problem is excavators. They cost more than the hull and can now be blown to shit without any warning or protection. Thats moronic man, how can you not see how fked up that is.
---
I’m pretty sure CCP would rather have a couple dozen players paying a small amount compared to one player with the same number of accounts subscribed. I can also so the game is better off with more players.
---
I mean, I'm of the opinion the Rorqual buff was a mistake and am generally in camp "death to all supers." EVE was a better game without mass capital proliferation.
---
The issue here is the perception that Null is the only place to live.  It isn't.  It is supposed to be extreme end-game content for larger groups, experienced players, high-SP high-isk characters.  Right now, there are a lot of people living in Null who shouldn't be there, and only were because Null fell short of its original conception as a scary wilderness.  Resetting Null to what it should be is going to make some growing pains as people move around, but as long as they follow up with help for Lowsec, all we're experiencing now is a sort of forest fire that is making room for new wood.
---
Thank you friend :)
---
Yikes...
---
If you can't trust a guy named fuckfacemcpewbastard to frame a screenshot honestly, who can you trust?
---
If you share the ended dashboard you remove all the taste to prepare data. But yes if you give us raw data you can't imagine what some people will be abble to do with it.
---
Interesting exemple : Suitonia make a graph who said PVE and PVP become uncorellated since 2016 ( i thnk it's more PVP and PVE are correllated with a new factor).
---
Do you have a principal component analysis  to explain to what PVE activity is correllated ? (exemple the 2 more important factor are age of character and alliance). I don't want the result it must stay secret (i think) i just want to know if CCP have take an eyes on that for exemple before decide some recent change.
---
Sounds like you got hooked on eating paint chips
---
What you are saying is totally different from what we were discussing. I agree tho. But we were talking about how an us and them are created and in the next step use of offensive language starts being used and in time can be escalated to really really horrific things.
---
So mild ribbing as you say is one thing, but if you really grade whats being said on this subforum as mild ribbing then idk man. There is waaaay too much hate here and waaaay too much us and them. We are all eve players, if the game dies, we have all lost.
---
Except the are the same amount of bots, been out checking on them, only the bots seem to be doing anything.
---
I guess Delve is the only Region where nobody gives a fuck about the blackout. At least not the big guys.
---
Lots of bitching and flaming of course but in the end Supers still keep ratting and Rorquals are mining 24/7. Removing local is not going to remove the Umbrella and the Capital Umbrella is what made Delve safe in the first place.
---
Aside from all the bitching and whining you won't hit the big null blocks with a Blackout! Sure subcaps are now even more in danger then before but they died way too easy before and that won't change now because you couldn't safe them before and now you won't even bother.
---
So all that blackout does is hitting the little guys or smaller alliances without Umbrella.
---
In Delve you we're ratting with hostile fleets in local before too, there is a saying that whats not on grid shouldn't bother you so ...
---
Sorry guys I don't see a blackout changing anything for the upper 1% tbh - we need something to fuck their day up not just some little dudes.
---
Funny enough, I do plan to starting next year : )
---
true
---
Mate, one part of the community should be living in null.  Another shouldn't.  I'm really sorry if people want to krab all day in total peace in what should be a scary place... but they shouldn't be able to unless they have friends, bubbles on their gates, cynos, backup, etc.
---
Also, regarding you point 3. -- dotlan and zkill are tools krabs can use too!  They just have to look at their screen and that pisses them off.  I run 3 rorqs and if I see a spike coming down the pipe I have plenty of time to cycle down and dock.  If you want to talk about unfair, how about the fact that pre-blackout hunters had to basically just get lucky even if they were doing EVERYTHING right?
---
In the entire time I've played this game there has always been an attitude like this coming from a small but very vocal part of the community.  They think that EVE exists for one purpose and one purpose only, for people to fly around in groups of spaceships, and get into fights, and cause explosions.  They would be just as happy if the entire industry system of EVE was removed from the game, and you simply bought replacement whatever from the local station with isk, kind of like the test server.  They do, in fact, look down upon anybody who doesn't agree with their view of the game as an open spaceship combat arena, and don't miss the chance to denigrate players who like to do different things in the game than undock and provide easy kills for pilots that are better skilled and more experienced flying ships that are difficult to counter without special purpose hulls.
---
While CCP Seagull was in charge I really had hope that EVE was becoming more of a big umbrella, making a place for all play styles to live and work together in null space.  But now she's gone and one of the old "hardcore" guys is in charge so it's a return to "f\*ck carebears (the new word is krabs), HTFU."
---
and taint my other 1,500 corpses? ok tree fiddy and we have a deal
---
Tikk is freighting service still available? I may vacation in Ama for a couple months try some low sec out.
---
A single super ratting makes about 80-90mill per tick. Thats 240-270 mill an hour. You make 45-60 mill an hour ratting in an Ishtar/VNI/Domi. 5-10 subcaps you don't have to pay attention to makes that same amount of isk and can also be farmed for SP. Every 30 minutes you have to look at a screen for 45 seconds with subcaps. To be as active as a super you have to have 40 sub caps running. That is one 1.8-2.4 billion an hour.  Yes, people are choosing to farm in subcaps.
---
At least I don’t measure my worth in pixels
---
Thats another question man. I really dislike the Rorq meta, its fking destroyed so many good parts about the game. But, we are here now. We cant say we dislike something so they should get bent. There needs to be a counter to getting your excavs blown up and if they still do, then the pilot wasnt d-scanning, its on him.
---
But fair has to be fair. Which brings us back to no cloak and d-scan immunity. If one side gets an advantage then the other side should gain a counter, otherwise it would be OP.
---
Thanks I will
---
If you have a keepstar, you can dock your super/titan and switch ships/clones. Before keepstars, you needed a dedicated super pilot or at least a 2nd account that could sit in it. Keepstars made supers viable for everyone. Injectors made that new demand almost instantaneous. Rorq buffs made it easy to meet that demand. Proliferation of those supers to umbrella with and the faxes to keep them alive long enough to not lose any made it viable to go full Red Lobster.
---
Well you're certainly correct, that if the game dies, we all lose. I think *most* of what I've seen is the sort of ribbing you see between opposing teams playing a game (oh yeah you blue dudes are terrible, red is the best etc). There's definitely some guys that take those attitudes too far, but I really do believe they're the outliers.   
---
I think going to one of the eve meetups is a good indication that we're not really ready to go at each other's throat. Met a lot of folk at Eve Vegas, including dudes I had fought before, and really didn't like in-game. We got on fine, drank and laughed and all went back home none the worse.
---
I agree with what you are saying. I don't think ccp will give up the money from 47 accounts to have 3-10 more account run actually played by real people.
---
I first read that as "why does this sexist" and was really confused.
---
I don't fly with the blob, little bitch. Cry more.
