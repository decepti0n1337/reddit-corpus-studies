Surely somebody will do the song!

So you thought "he must be looking for juicy abyssal runners to gank", but despite being a juicy abyssal runner, you still decided to  run the site in Jita?
---
I ran into the same problem. Playing this afternoon

---
Sounds like B0T is very salty.
---
Lol, ratting is for suckers.
---
They are goon renter, not goon. It s the same rhat saying bot or wermt = Nc.
---
And yeah renters bot a lot. Everywhere.
---
NDA
---
One of the people that runs the bots to get supers/titans/rmt notices you are killing bots.
---
Probably watched the HBO miniseries Chernobyl.
---
Ah shit, here we go again
---
&gt; It s the same rhat saying bot or wermt = Nc.
---
If you read the tweet chain that's exactly what Mittens was saying:
---
https://twitter.com/TheMittani/status/1126593231951728643
---
My personal opinion is that if you provide protection to bot alliances, it's safe to say you are "harboring" them.
---
Looks like it got assimilated.
---
First carrier and dread are very different in SP point of view. One need fighter and drone sp the other gun and siege.
---
Chimeria is ugly and bad (carrier caldari player here :D)
---
There's gonna be alot of coping with not wanting to get rid of their precious little botters 
---
It'll be easier to rid themselves of botters if the tards just make a pact to kick their renters out
---
Just checked, no issues here
---
This is pretty much exactly right, most of my best Eve memories are with close friends in lowsec. It holds a special place in my heart.
---
Back when I was a CEO, we would take the corpses of our podded wartargets and contract them back to the enemy corp's CEO, along with messages like "This person trusted you."
---
Hard to recall how often now, but I know that resulted in at least one surrender message.
---
Bunch of Aussies were having that issue.
---
The whole feature is just a joke.
---
    
---
Ninja looters, missing stages, Different text on UI than in the Agency when the invasion is coming to an end.
---
We are still waiting for that 8-15 people content.
---
The night before the invasion launch, CCP triples the tracking speed of Leshak, added new missile launcher.
---
2 Days after the Launch, CCP added a new set of NPC rat.
---
It is obvious CCP did not have time to finish making this invasion.
---
Is it possible to learn this life experience?
---
Did you honk?

Chimera is sexy AF. We can't be friends...

Well fucking switch it back! 😆

Renters bot.

He apparently forgot the spire as well which was lost in all of what. A week?
---
&gt;entosis link can be fit to most of s
---
I was screaming toast delve because i know how broken the mechanic is, something has to be done for CCP to take a look at how it works now. Because right now its literally impossible to defend against it, and there is no pvp involved, just T1 frigates and haulers. I strongly doubt CCP planned sov "warfare" to be about T1 frigates and haulers running around.
---
"Children of Light" have grown up and taken LSD
---
Does concord even fight the trig rats?????
---
What's a nag?
---
Wait you can kill the storage without killing the pos? I thought all the pos crap is inside the shield, and you have to kill the whole pos to get to that stuff.
---
You don't know what they are attacking with until you get there. And you don't know if they are still on the ihub/tcu or if they have burned off at 4000 ms the whole time. So they can make you run around like 6 hours a day every day for all eternity.
---
maybe we're stuck in phase 1 because eager capsuleers beat back the invasion too quickly. turn the sansha invasion mechanic on its head. even players start an invasion by anchoring bases, they don't just forward deploy all their supers without an exit strategy.
---
I see this as a feature.
---
Death to all bots! No matter the alliance!
---
Press V
---
Now maybe I'm misunderstanding something but you are saying that your game doesnt close properly.
---
Are you sure that you mean the game and not the launcher?
---
Asking because apparently this exact issue was fixed for the launcher in the current beta build.
---

Most of the discarded Pos in wh space are left from whne someone moved out of a wormhole. They took all the stuff but the tower with them.
---
1. if you have renters, you have bots  
---
2. peligro's chart meant fuck all because it was a record of all-time perma bans for ANY offence, but ccp didn't permaban for for first-time botters until really recently, and certainly didn't just permaban for botting  
---
tl;dr: peligro is a rabble-rousing batman-wannabe who should concentrate on actually doing his job rather than patting himself for doing things he is paid, by us, to do

"One rule for thee, another for me."

---
a lot of renters are just terminal spodbrain actual human players tbh
---
while botting is definitely more prevalent in renter alliances, I wouldn't say it's the norm, for any renter alliance - wermt, b0t, pibc, memed, or pblrd
---
a lot like falcon with his smug one liners tbh

By stepping back and remembering that all the time i spend playing games on my computer is technically wasted and not worrying about if i'm wasting it in some nebulously more or less manner.
---
The way I see it? Null-sec is the daycare for buff special ed kids that mostly stay in their own world of krabbing under the supervision of their guardians/cap umbrella, high-sec is the decrepit bar down the road where the failures go daily, wormhole space is the mental asylum for criminals unfit for a normal jail and low-sec is like mad-max but now with 50% more subcaps.

You don't need injectors seeded to test things. With seeded plex you can get extractors to rearrange your existing SP for testing which is good enough.
---
If you have a lot of sp already...
---
if only there were ships that can go faster than 4000m/s!!!!! if you actually did any offensive sov war against anyone competent you would realise how retarded the changes you are suggesting are, nevermind that sov war is intended to scale, and actually does that pretty well, nevermind that you can do the exact same thing with citadels, and you could do it with POSes too.  
---
what you are ignoring is that there is perfect symmetry of effort here - if someone is actually willing to autism troll you, then to stop it you will have to engage in similar aids yourself. alternatively, let them make the timer and then defend it with the innumerable advantages a sov holder has. the choice is yours, welcome to the sandbox.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
btw, you know what kills a 4k m/s entosis atron? any t3d or boosher. jackdaws, rail hecates, beam fessors and magus are all especially effective, you're welcome. imagine moaning about getting free kills
---
But, uh, sleep,
---
the cost is that they are spending the exact same amount of time doing it as you. the 'mechanic' you're complaining about is autism
---
O.o
---
Every time you take a salient point and wrap it in this much grrgoons you erode the strength and validity of your position
---
You only need around 10-15mil for anything subcap. And +5 learning implants are seeded as well.
---
But its sooo muuuch mooooree awsome :p
---
I mean, yeah you can kinda make it work. I just don’t understand why they aren’t seeded.
---
Can't stand the jerk.
---
"your point is correct and argument cannot be debated so I'll say I don't like your tone in order to dismiss you anyway"
---
lol unreal
---
I literally said this a year ago where the entosis module should only be allowed to be fitted to capital ships, marauders, command ships....and was shunned by your people. Who would have thought that allowing the module to be fit to a t1 frigate worth 300,000 isk was a bad idea? Oh...wait the majority of nullsec players who are actually involved in the game and theory crafting. But everyone wanted the "little guy" to be able to hurt big bad goonswarm.  
---
The good news is, because Goons are doing it now CCP might change it in about six months. Too bad your region will be glassed over by then.  
---
Here's how you fix Eve 0.0:  
---
\-Only allow command ships, marauders, and caps to entosis (or very valuable ships that can't just kite away). Force fights...stop with the caring about the little guy  
---
\-Remove the rorqs ability to mine, turn it back to a booster  
---
\-Make any structure that is in low power have no damage cap  
---
\-Remove the TZ tank and create a greater variance in exit timers
---
Minmatar dreadnought. Dreads are the go to in c5/6 sites
---
Holy shit you need a capital to run sites? This game never stops blowing my mind
---
I've seen less padding in a push up bra....
---
No you either need multiple battleships or a capital
---
It's more like I don't filter my salient points for optimal upvotes and not offending anyone.
---
There being bots in Period Basis is a salient point. So is the fact that Mittens talked down on others for renting to botters while he is doing the same. 
---
Now I won't not talk about the latter truth, just because you/they like to imagine me as a grrgoons conspiracy theorist.
---
Anyway to spawn Concord and see if trig rats engage?
---
Why are you playing a game where you feel bored? There are tons a great games out there. You won't like all of them. 
---
Do yourself a favor and stick to the ones where you don't need to ask questions like this.
---
ITT: A lot of people don't get how delivery hangars plus structures in wormholes work
---
Hahahahaha no, too busy trying how to figure out how I want to make isk the right way.
---
[remember when mittani literally talked about it on the meta show, 3 weeks ago?](https://clips.twitch.tv/ObedientBlindingWheelRlyTho)
---
Haha, Minmatar mafia tactics
---
b..b...but VNIs!!!!
---
I think the sandbox is an important concept not only in the usual sense where we say you can do whatever you want, make of it what you will. But also, imagine sitting in a sandbox. Depending on the person it could be really boring or they could have a lot of fun digging holes or drawing in the sand. Then imagine a friend gets in and now you could either sit there writing your name and being bored, or you could be burying each other in sand or something fun.
---
EVE doesn’t entertain you, and it’s goal isn’t necessarily to. Just like a box full of sand isn’t intrinsically entertaining. It’s up to you as the player to make it fun. And it’s easier to do that with other people too just like in a sandbox.
---
Go directly answer your question: The real fun of eve for me is fleet PVP. I live in wormholes and our average fleet size is 30ish people. This is very fun to me, and having the desire to do that makes the ratting tolerable because I know I’m making isk to buy another guardian or better implants etc. I think the key is finding that one thing you really enjoy and then looking at everything else as a means to that end. But that being said you’ll still never have fun if your not self motivated and you don’t create your own fun. The game doesn’t give much to you on its own.
---
I don't follow that channel but tell me the reasoning behind how he can point at NCPL renters while exonerating his alliance from the same guilt because "they aren't touching the dirty ISK"? 
---
As far as I know, the monetary relationship in both cases is the same: "Pay rent for protection".
---
We're reaching autism levels hat shouldn't be possible

My super toon that is almost done training has 20m SP, just need fighters V and Gal Carrier V and it’ll be good, but it has all the supporting skills to V (except jump fuel cal) incl armour comp etc and just a normal carrier doesn’t need fighters V right away.
---
For a dread it’s probably another 5+m SP on top of that for all the gunnery skills/t2 siege and t2 weapons I’d say , maybe a bit more. T2 triage would be another few mill SP
---
All in all for a very good toon with t2 triage siege guns fighters id say about 30m
---
I play it as a very long term resource management game, with other people, people that want to shoot things together, there are explosions and it's in space and that does it for me.
---
Also you didn't list that you tried wormhole corps, that's probably your problem.
---
Must have meant 25M.
---
Look at FCON, it doesn’t work you need the unity and efficiency of a dictatorship

Never made the second claim mate. I only ever said they are unrewarding to catch.

You have to fit it and go out and shoot something to see if it works, remember Venture have +2 warp strength built in.

Combat probes and Interdictors exist you know.
---
Yeah, shoot the ninja looters that show up.   
---
It's almost too stupid to comprehend.
---
You are not going to be as successful as a player with loads of xp and skill points, but since a Merlin is low cost you could at least have some fun  and learn something maybe
---
It's refreshing to see you making threads to improve the game itself, rather than shit on Goons/Imperium exclusively. This ticks both boxes, and I am supportive.
---
Kick the fucking botters. Kill them all. Steal their assets.
---
Oh wow. You truly are that clueless?
---
Would it be more efficient to go for Carrier/Fax rather than Carrier/Dread?
---
it could be a groundhog day time loop.
---
Instead of seeing it as a killboard pad, it is more like an attempt to shit up the killboard of corps that care.
---
AND I LOVE IT  :D
---
Enlighten me. I'm not a metagamer. I don't care much about the specifics of your political relations.
---
Still low. But if there have been lots of big gaps in training time it makes sense.
---
In my experience, the other 1% is one sitting on a belt somewhere in Verge Vendor / Placid, with a cloacked Hyena nearby waiting for you to be curious.
---
Bless EC-300s and Arty.
---
This needs to form part of your CSM campaign, somehow.
---
Our renters pay a 1 time fee to apply to the alliance, they don't get taxed. Any isk they earn doesn't go to us (if they're botting, it's dirty isk). That is different than NCPL who collect the botting ISK, and end up getting negwalleted because of it.
---
Lmao at vily getting dumpstered by a CSM candidate that actually knows what he’s talking about and deserves to be on the CSM
---
/u/Vily_R you know what the counter is to cloaky camping? Defending yourself against what they drop on your like should be the counter for every kindof hunter instead of docking up when they’re 5j away (perhaps with your cancerous super umbrella). Btw Legacy members don’t count as small alliances so you can stop pretending to care about actual small entities as a means to push your shitty pro-megablob ideas.
---
b..b...but my moral!!!
---
Bow down before the Kings of lowsec, and now wormholes. Snuff #1.
---
It's not total exoneration as he correctly points out the banned botters in PBLRD. His main points from the tweet were the simple facts that renting groups directly linked to the Imperium made up 5%  of all bans while directly linked Panfam groups made up 16%. I also feel like for him it was even more important that GSF proper wasnt even on the chart despite being the largest or one of the largest alliances for literally a decade.
---
Maybe this is not a game for you?
---
This is so old how is this even news?
---
Can somebody tell me what the fuck I'm looking at here?  
---
What purpose does this serve? Besides killmarks maybe.
---
Check out the channel t1m0, i just made it but it will be thriving in the next few weeks. It should help you get a foot in the door with frigate pvp.
---
Dems alota blackbirds.
---
Yeah cus FAX are the same skills as carriers (racially) eg archon and apostle use the same skills to sit in, and I think it’s probably easier to use the mods and train the support skills for a fax rather than a dread.
---
But I’d recommend training all of them, probably dread first, then fax, then carrier in order of usefulness to me. But maybe you wanna rat then you’d just train it however you’d like. 
---
The optimal character layout for nullsec (imo) is:
---
1. Main
---
2. Cap alt (dread/fax/carrier)
---
3. Super alt
---
4. Titan alt
---
All on different accounts, for you I’d definitely recommend training all non-super caps on a “cap alt”
---
Stupidity, you are looking at stupidity.
---
This is a different one. Does anyone have that diagram of the rabbit hole of the levels of gaming, with eve at the bottom?

Deliver packaged ship to people you 'dislike' (read have a reddish for). Wait for cit to unanchor or be exploded. Ships drop in can. When ships drop, and get exploded - results.

Ive hunted bots since 2011 and ill tell you right here a vni a gila or a super bot is nearly impossible to catch but some smuck working in a office running 5 vnis in the backround is easy as shit.
---
The point of the imgmacro is to say that mass killing vnis is not a good indicator of botting at all. Most of the time its actually the opposite.
---
what the fuCK
---
It's not the Mach that scares me.
---
It's the random frigs.  No probes, not probes, no probes, ASSHOLE ON GRID!

No - he's pissed that 200 bombers couldn't nuke even 1 out of 15 rorqs.
---
This ought to be an interview style for the next CSM.
---
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
---
I'll probably go for the Carrier/Fax first, then. Seems more sensible for defending a WH (this coming from a total WH noob).
---
200 bombers turned up. Zero rorqs lost. Something's borked.

So, he's angry he didn't get a free kill. Got it.

We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things.

I thought today we would do a happy little picture. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. Let's do it again then, what the heck. I get carried away with this brush cleaning.
---
We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. You can get away with a lot. Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too.
---
Just beat the devil out of it. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature.
---
Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. Play with the angles. Imagination is the key to painting. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path.
---
I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. I like to beat the brush. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow.
---
Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us.

My Corp. even if I’m literally doing nothing, or god forbid trying to make a spreadsheet, if I’m shitting around on comms with my Corp it’s immediately 100% more fun. Get yourself a good Corp, not one of the big ones that you’re just another linemember
---
yes, they are. they got delivered. ejected out of a container and after that killed.
---
Yeah in my limited experience (I’ve had 2 C5 farm holes but am not part of a PVP WH group) FAX and Dreads are the goto for WH PvP, carriers not so much as they’re best in a blob.
---
Apostle + Vindi w/ 3 fed navy webs + cap gun dread is a very nasty combo
---
Carrier would be for sleeper sites, then.
---
I’ve not tried it but I’ve heard they’re bad for sites as the rats kill your fighters very quickly
---
Because people are bored, figure “hey I should be able to do it with this many nados let’s give it a shot” and warp to an abyss site, wait till they exit, and blap blap collect shiny mods

So if I rent a house I own for 49 years for a one time fee, the dudes turn out to be meth cooks, I knowingly gave them shelter. But just because I am not renting monthly, my house stops being a meth house.

I could go on mate. All you've done is finding a workaround to getting your ISK confiscated mate. The fact that you are harboring and protecting botters doesn't change. Don't rationalize.
---
Fuck Snuff
---
Hmm. Guy in the hole I live in runs sites in a thanny and cleans them up pretty easily. I'll have to ask him about fighter aggro. It's a C3, for what it's worth.
---
Faxes are desired everywhere but take into account what your use case is and how your home holes weather effects the ship you wish to fly.
---
For examples carriers really have no place for effective wormhole krabing (barring clearing home sites in lowclass holes but for real just use snakes for that) but are excellent home defence tools given you have a good group to fight with it and your holes weather effects don't ruin the application more than it already does (lookin at you wolf rayets)
---
The phoenix (again assuming a neutral or favourable wh effect) is an excellent HAW platform but is debatable worse than the naglfar and revelation for ratting in high-class space.
---
Yeah might be different in a c3 I don’t really know

WH is a C3 with no weather effects.

PS: The point of this post wasn't so much that a greater majority of past botting happened in Goonlands, but the current botting activity is becoming rampant and comparable to other botting regions.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bw4k9j/cringe_zkb_padder_spotted/
---
do you even look before you post
---
So the same fit but cheaper would work as well if OP is wondering
---
30m is overkill. A purely specialised ratting dread pilot can have good support skills and T2 guns and siege at 15m sp. 20m sp basically gives you perfect support skills and room to skill into rolling ships and other useful wh stuff. Add a couple mil sp if you actually give a shit about jump skills.

They are on the list mate. What else do you want. Goons used the same list to criticize other alliances.
---
Shall we completely stop talking about botting because nobody can confirm it ever to suit your perfectionist standards? If that's the case we shouldn't have spoken about it at all.
---
It always has been
---
Yup, that's about it.
---
So fax and carrier are priority trains. Bear in mind that you can NOT traverse a capital ship between wormholes linking to low class space (c1 through C4). Capitals can only travel via Very Large wormholes which are only found connecting C5/c6/kspace to other C5/c6/kspace. So any capitals you want in your hole have to be built in-home and will be there until they either die or get looted during an eviction.

Didn’t init DD their own titans?
---
Still funny tho tapi retards
---
Looks like a legion battleship from WoW
---
Not from a Jedi
---
Ruins people’s killboard stats, and is something CCP should change.
---
(Inb4 WhO cArEs AbOuT kIlLbOaRdS)
---
EANMs require more CPU, but provide more resist.
---
ANMs require no CPU, and give less resist.
---
Depends on fit, and what you are trying to accomplish.  Do you have the CPU?  Do you spare the CPU and are able to cover the slight loss in resists?  How shiney do you want to be?
---
Yup. This is part of the reason I put down with this group in the C3.
---
Wormhole space.
---
Good unbiased answer. Lol. Jokes aside, any tips for wh space?
---
The plating still boosts resists. There is the option of upgrading it to faction or deadspace even for similar fitting cost. It really depends on the ship.
---
Balancing tank, dps, utility and cost is part of fitting. It's kind of addicting to play with fits. And nano platings definitely have a solid spot in optimizing fits.
---
That’s only required for people that don’t understand sarcasm well
---
Titans going 200 m/s...
---
Time played having fun is not wasted. Time played grinding is not fun and that is wasted. I try not to do the latter as much.
---
Who was FC?
---
awh, How cute
---
Picture of kill marks before down time or it never happened.
---
I guess just be aware of when you use caps inside your hole. Blobbing with them or regularly "showing them off" on killmails is a great way to get tagged as a group that needs to be kicked into place. In lowclass space you'll honestly rarely have use for them in everyday wh life.
---
Agreed
---
Learn to dscan and probe quickly , always bookmark the hole you pop out of, move around a lot, scan down a chain and then come back through looking for targets, there is no hostility timer on holes, so pay attention to polarization.
---
A non cloaky frig is going to have a limited engagement profile, you are up agent, Asteros, Ventures, and exploration frigs that might be your targets, just being quick and paying attention to what is dscanible will let you catch the slow and inexperienced.
---
I would still advise against using steam, downloading the launcher is very easy and much better IMO
---
I think at this point it's safe to say Zkill is kill.
---
&gt;Ill delete this once I get my answer.
---
Don't, this is one of the worst things you can do.
---
And from my understanding if you purchase through steam all account services must be purchased through steam. So you won't get in on plex sales through CCP and character services and support through CCPs website. Also afaik the current referrals work differently on steam and have different lesser rewards.
---
mate, none of Olmecas points were good, I just realized i was trying to explain things to a someone who doesnt get it and i shouldn't fall to their level ;p
---
I started playing on Steam because I didn't know about any drawbacks. You can just convert your Steam account to a normal one in the account management though and then use both steam payment options and outside-of-steam payment options (I bought gametime via Amazon and via CCP directly for my Steam account succefully).  
---
So it doesn't really matter, you're not forever bound to use Steam and can switch to standalone whenever you want.
---
Don't do it. Just don't.
---
Did I say they weren't bots.... No
---
Did I say they weren't humans.... No
---
The only thing I said was your indicators are a poor metric, And that ccp are the only people with the tools to determine who are and arnt bots.
---
Clearly me distrusting you is an indicator that I am a bot.
---

---
I got this like a month ago back on the 32bit client
---
Praise the Omnissah, our archeo-tech have awaken yet another Necrontyr tomb.
---
You can fit dual scram to catch Ventures, even if they put in Warp Core Stabilizers.
---
Just download the client from CCP, having to wait for steam to connect and update it's own software before you launch a game is slightly annoying and unnecessary.
---
You don't get killmarks for unboarded ships.
---
It looks like he had it done to him a couple months back ( https://zkillboard.com/related/31002098/201904201900/ ), and a number of the targets are the people who did it to him, so it's just good old fashioned revenge. And then also some FCs/big names from NCPL for the hell of it, I guess.
---
Yeah, don't. If you made a steam account, just convert it to a normal account, much less of a hassle.
---
If you decide to mine rocks in high sec, make sure you buy a mining permit from an authorized dealer.
---
Revenge. Most of these people did it to him a couple of months ago: https://zkillboard.com/related/31002098/201904201900/

And then there's also a bunch of NCPL fcs for the hell of it, I guess.

My indicators are the same indicators anybody has ever used to talk about bots. Clearly nobody cares about your higher standards, as lots of people talked about bots before.
---
Dreddit is recruiting.

You’re fucking retarded
---
Well that's just not very *polite*
---
Shooting polite fish in a barrel.
---
Judging from your post history, i dont think eve is your cup of tea
---
Your indicators that indicated all goons in delve were botters? because the chart proved that to be wrong.
---
Just using the launcher tends to be better, but its not really a big deal anymore.  In the past a steam account couldn't use  certain offers/etc that normal accounts could, but you can assign a CCP ID to a steam account now so for all intents and purposes they don't really have a penalty anymore.

Go play galaxy on roblox, it’s what sparked my interest into eve

&gt; I'm not saying Goons are botters and the Northern renters are innocent or making a comparison. What I'm saying is that not a lot of mega alliances with a rental program are pure and innocent to point fingers at each other. Clean your home first. Claim moral high ground later. But please do try to clean your home.

Find another alliance, then, instead of making everything about yourself and trying to change everything to suit you.
---
I have heard ppl scanning the structure for the fits to check for pds what do you use to scan for the timer?
---
Your alliance sucks.
---
Join another one.

Either you or the other party have to allow zKill to fetch kills/losses from your ESI. If neither have it allowed (or the corp or alliance of either pilot), then the kills will not automatically get pulled to zKill.

As said already, you can manually post kills using  [https://zkillboard.com/post/](https://zkillboard.com/post/)

That kind of people is just gay.

Sure, there are days where you look back and think "Damn, what a waste of time." And then there are the days that you look back and think "Holy shit. I can't believe we just did that," and those make up for all the rest.
---
A)leave. Most corps won’t allow that shit, find one of them. I know for a fact anything like that would get you kicked from PH in a matter of hours, and I assume it’s the same way in the other major new player friendly alliances. Hard to call yourself friendly to anything if you let those people in. 
---
B)name them, I’m sure at least a few people here will spend some time making those people’s Eve live’s miserable. At the very least it’ll warn other people not to bother joining
---
Well, the kill wouldn't show up if both of the killer and the victim haven't shared their personal esi or Corp esi to zkill
---
That guy has a Medal of Alpha Male

And a Hydra

So I wouldn't disagree with him

---
It is worth noting that if you give ZKB your ESI access it will post all the kills for you automatically, which in some cases you may not want, since it provides instant intel that things are dying.
---
Like, say, you and a few friends have a carrier tackled. The moment that first fighter wing dies, everyone can see that a carrier is in a fight through zkill. So while 90% of the time it doesn't matter, there can be cases like that where you don't want to give away a fight in progress.
---
They represent the views of the vast majority of humanity. Don't travel outside of safe spaces, find group that suits you.
---
That's Steele. He is a live pilot, with an absurd amount of accounts. Dont believe me? Tackle one of them and see all of his alts in system drop right on top of you in a swarm of drones.
---
Why stay in that group?
---
As long as I'm having fun playing Eve, I'm not wasting my time. 
---
When I realize, I'm just staring at my ship in station, I quit and do something else and come back when I feel like it.
---
glooby..
---
I stopped hunting bots when the black screen on character login would keep fucking me over. Appearing in local for 10 seconds before my client even finishes loading meant that I'd keep warping on grid and seeing VNIs just warping off.
---
If CCP would fucking fix that shit (or make it so you only appear in local after your client has finished loading) I'd be out there hunting every single VNI and Domi because they're the dumbest and most predictable bots I've ever seen in my life.
---

Cool, what are we looking at here?
---
Famous for one month
---
How much ISK can you make running these c5/c6 sites? I assume you have to "move" into WH space to do so, correct? Would I need to learn how to set up an up well structure?

You're fully entitled to you're own opinion dude. We paid out tonight actually payout pool came out to around 8b. Everyone got their own fair shair. Logi got 1.5 shares per fleet, DPS got 1 and FC got 1.5

My favorite is when people use insta-warp ceptors fitted with ECM to break your jams... I sat on the same node hacking away for two hours once due to just one of them bouncing from ping into jam range long enough to try to get one cycle of ECM. Then bouncing back to ping again and repeating until my soul left my body to never return..... Those were fun times.   
---
Fuck Fozzie Sov
---
I usually have at least 200 days if train on my toons and have them subbed, in case I go long time afk. This might change this summer, though and I will just let some of them lapse into expiration. Because CCP's decissions really hurt the game this time around and made nullsec and sov warfare so dull. I had enough if of shitadels and Fozzie's bullshit.
---
God yes! Looking at the old propaganda posters and the Youtube videos is fantastic. The current stuff is drivel comparatively. I suppose that's because there aren't that many actual enemies and the real aversion to loss of isk. The current mechanics don't seem to help this much in any positive way. 
---
Because of this, intel gathering is pretty boring stuff.

---
Sorry if this is a stupid question, but what is wormholing? I’ve looked on the wiki and can find stuff on wormholes but not wormholing.
---
You can just tell from the downvotes we still enjoy it.
---
Theres actually a second class of ship which uses platings: freighters.
---
Now I don't fly freighters, but there was a time when a-type platings were used. Maybe its fallen out of favor for being too gankable vs a full bulkhead fit, I don't know.
---
You can deliver items to anyone, anywhere as long as you're in system to deliver them. This guy delivered 12k ships to Rive in a wormhole. You cannot move anything from delivery without being in system, so Rive acquired 12k ships he had no way of ever moving (unless he found the wormhole and was allowed to dock in the citadel). Then the citadel was unanchored, and in J (wormhole) space everything drops when a citadel is killed or unanchored.   
---
So all the ships in delivery dropped, and then Ektallion was able to blow them all up. It's blatant exploitation of the delivery system and J space mechanics.
---
it shows how stupid the zkb point system is
---
I wouldn't call it the worst change, bit it is a dumb one for sure.
---
For some of us not giving a fuck about highsec, ot is completely useless and we do not need it. Has to be toggleable. CCP won't make me participate in this crap they call wars that way...

Still on the fence, but I don't have a reason to say no if I go through with it.

Plus... Whelping capitals is a good isk sink.
---
Gate camping lowsec takes your ability to think, so here we are.
---
Resist amounts is the key diff. Why most go for energized instead. Besides the cpu req. Plating have less overall resists than energized of the same level.

So in short use energized if you can.

Yeaaa but bulkheads have always been better..

What does reddit complain about in PVE? Infinitely farmable, predictable, isk faucets that offer no counter play for others to interfere and take the spoils.

Anyway to answer your question straightforward (I was in a rush when I posted my first comment here but its still a channel/community you should check out.)

Factional warfare low sec is a good place to learn solo frigate pvp. There are arenas with ship restrictions to keep the bigger stuff from bothering you. You'll get owned at first but it will teach you over time.

There are many streamers that focus on FW solo pvp so check out streaming sites. They are great to chat with and can usually give you some good advice.

Some groups prefer to verbally call targets instead of broadcasting as it's harder to relay from a spy perspective. Hearing "Lock up the tengu of MAC" is a lot harder to relay as a spy than looking at a broadcast window and calling out names as they're broadcast.

13 or 14 years ago I spent some time with a very dear friend and some special people he met.  Ham Cake, Egg Land, Swiss Cheese and... oh there was Auga too.  It was a confluence of other low sec space.  This was a place where there be pirates.  I have not seen any still active in a long long time.  Ben Booly stopped by for a moment or two on coms.  I do not know if he was just a friend or if he was in the corp.  I never was either.  I had to learn how to fight in a ship I was not used to in a way I was not used to.  I had to learn how to actually fly a ship.  I got to use my megathron in a fight.  I got to use some cruisers in a meaningful manner.  I learned that remote reps could be used and how not to shoot my new buddies with them locked for reps.  It was the place that I really found my blood thirst. One of the guys went through a tough spot but could get on from time to time if something was happening.  his carrier was called upon in a 1-800-hot-drop fashion.  We had some good ganks because of a very good prober.  We got into some good brawls.  
---
After drifting for a bit we moved to NPC 0.0 and it was fun, but lacked the spark.  Much later, maybe 9 years ago I found more cool people for myself and my close friends to fight along side in ishomilken.  I think it was Garmen's alt, some Monte Christo guy helped me bomb around in frigates all over the place.  More fighting in cheaper ships.  Losing some of the more expensive ones too.  Kill2 killed me in my vexor or maybe it was a Lachesis.  I did not know at the time that these guys were to become somewhat legendary.  I ended up losing point on the Rocket Wizardry or was it Rocket Witchcraft flick when we almost had the guy.  Of course I would make a video fucking up because I got scared of a gate gun.  I probably would have been cut if he had been killed.   There were fights with on again off again Burn Eden guys who I hope are still active because we got into brawls there.  We got into brawls that meant something because there were only 3-6 of us on grid against groups that should have beat us if they could fly their ships well.  There was room to get dirty close with lasers and blasters.  Ham drakes were so much fun.  Strategy on a micro scale was important.  It was important for me to make strategy and to execute strategy.  I was not a ship of the line.  I was my own pilot and making my mistakes would cost others their ships.  I would make my own mistakes and lose my hard earned ships.  Selling my nos Domi made me sad because it had been nerfed into the ground and I had barely scratched the paint.  
---
Low sec was the epitome of emotion in EVE.  It was not like flying in Period Basis Nulli or Black Legion.  It was not, "Stay Frosty Boys."  It was not, "get ready nerds."  It was not, "EVERYONE, TAKE YOUR DRUGS AND GET ON THE TITAN NOW!"
---
Lowsec was the death on the spike at the end of the learning cliff XKCD(or whoever made it) comic.  It was the eve that I had experienced when I was getting splatted by Noobjuice down the Misaba Pipe to get my first glimpse of 0.0 in R3-K7K.  His name still sits with me because of how it felt and his name was awesome.   My forays into lowsec was the dragon I chased when in 0.0 but barely found again except in some great little fights in NPC null.  That dragon is what kept me playing for the 10 years I played nearly consecutively.  In hindsight I should have given factional warfare a better shake and I should have gone to J-space when I thought it was a good idea.  I know you talked me out of it Argus because you liked me even when I was being a bit of a cunt.  I liked playing with your corp too so I stayed.  
---
I didn't go to lowsec because I was frightened of the Vindication encounter that could have been.  I didn't know hot to make money beyond shooting red crosses.  I thought gate guns were the worst and didn't think there were counters to them.  I obviously learned better.  
---
I know most of those characters have gone as inactive as I did long before I did.  I learned that reading about the game can be just as fun as playing it.  the call of low sec and how it felt is what keeps me wanting to play again.  The story of 0.0 is what keeps me engaged and reading about the game instead.  That and the time sink that the game is even in lowsec space where the little fights can be more frequent.  Eve is a game that is made worth the wait because of the payoff.  I do not have the free time to do it anymore.
---
You tend to find people like that everywhere you go, but it is not the norm. There are alliances who will be friendly to you, just gotta find one.   
---
But I would ask, don't go naming and shaming, not because they are wrong, or bigots, etc. But because EVE is a game and I want to keep IRL politics out of it. There is enough shit flinging every day as it is.
---
.
---
its pretty much everyone in this alliance [https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99006371/](https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99006371/)
---
Looks like a Monster Energy Gate. punching through space.
---
ohh man these comments are amazing. Which one was right OP?
---
In a safe look what i wrote
---
I see WH corps are affected in a similar way due to lack of people actually undocked in null sec space.
---
Fuck those fuckers and the rotting undead zombie horse they rode in on. You're in a shit corp of a shit alliance.
---
Come to the Imperium--I mean, I fancy goons, but you do you, we have a lot of corps and a lot of alliances. 
---
I founded our queerswarm, I'm in charge of our sirenswarm. 
---
One of the members of both is a transfemale retired Marine. 
---
You like space priesting? Yeah. Come to repswarm. 
---
Space trucking? You've literally never had it on our scale. Once we know you're no more than the usual amount of spy, come see our GoonSwarm Offensive Logistics.
---
Enjoy Pride Month a gorillion percent better by coming to an alliance that's not shit.
---
I've largely won eve, but I remain on our jabber, and those I've fostered continue my work. Get into Karmafleet; they'll set you right.
---
Thank you and spodbless.
---
it is a down who is a little cold.
---
Idiots gonna idiot I Guess, as well as "Reading is hard".
---
Godspeed to your continued work against the bot menace, wish you the best of Luck.
---
Technically you can remote-trash ships iirc.
---
There are people who overreach a bit, but the stuff OP was talking about is unacceptable.
---
Not everyone who calls out a asshole is a “SJW”.
---
i don't really know since i've never done it, but generally:
---
You need multiple dreads obviously (to run the site, 2 or 3). They're like 2.5-3b each. Then you want a pos, probably medium or large, which is like 200-500m? A citadel is optional, but expensive. The smallest citadels, raitaru and astrahus, cost 400 and 800m respectively, but don't let capitals dock. For capitals, you need a fortizar (8B!!!).
---
Setting up an upwell citadel is really easy, you just make a "safe spot" (i.e save a location between celestials) and right click -&gt; anchor. then you wait 24 hours for it to anchor, and its up. then you fit a service to it ("assume control" --&gt; open fittings), throw fuel in it's fuel bay and online the service to "high power" the citadel, which gives it an extra reinforcement cycle (making it much less appealing to attack).
---
setting up a pos is a bit different; it anchors MUCH faster but is more of an effort to do since you need to power and anchor every little "structure" inside it (ship maintenance arrays, corp hangar, shield hardeners, guns etc), and **you need to fuel it with strontium, too** if you want to have a reinforcement cycle (highly recommend since it lets you evac ships).
---
Yes yes there are loads of issue the current PVE in EVE suffers, however forcing players ignoring a PVE and wait until it progress and have better PVE return is not solving any of the problem you listed, and that does not make it not a bad design neither. It is still infinitely farmable as it generates everyday. It is not any less predictable than sansha incursions. Weather it is a ISK faucets and have counter play or not is not decided by how it progress into next stage.
---
If you pay attention to the weather effect there is clearly a progression in how intense the Triglavian weather with the time passed. That means progression happens but no stage change was there. They do not even have a status line that states the world ark never appeared (they only have the line that says world ark is no longer detected)
---
I believe this could be done with 2 accounts fairly comfortable if you use Leshaks for DPS.
---
Lowsec, faction warfare systems.
---
Context is needed but it means going into a wormhole. Could mean living in one, day tripping or exploring.
---
Ok, I’ve just seen people on the subreddit saying they are wormholers or like wormholing.
---
Only reason I can think of for why you are still playing with said group is that you are intentionally staying to hear what they are saying so you can come complain about it on reddit. Even animals know it's time to move on when they are not comfortable.
---
The commenter I replied to wasn’t just calling people out, he was suggestion to go much further than that lol
---
This happens in linux too
---
I approve this service, would dunk those that shall not undock again 10/10
---
It included DT into the equation.      
---
If it is longer than possible game uptime ... it is stable.
---
Telling other people about why is saying what about who? That’s not going very far.
---
“I’m sure at least a few people here will spend time making their Eve lives miserable”
---
^ suggesting that people do that
---
But Reddit karma
---
Nice avoiding the the question there, looks like you are cut out for a life of politics
---
You are retarded go back to mining that sweet mineral.
---
 The vast majority of service personnel, current and former, are decent people and don't even remotely behave as you describe. If your Corp sucks than your Corp sucks find a new one. To make broad sweeping generalize against the military en masse is just as bigoted and just as hateful as the nonsense you say is targeted at you.
---
I guess i, personally, just like games where i can set my own goals. Just lark about. Do whatever feels right. I HATE corridor shooters and on-rail games that just push you along towards some defined objective. Eve is the exact opposite of that. It's just the definitive sandbox in what you can express yourself however you damn well please. And that just does it for me really
---
We have pyfa for that
---
lmfao looks like my github commits
---
Why do you think CCP should care about zkillboard padding? You must be the only person in eve that thinks there is nothing better they could be doing.
---
Follow up question: when you are in the csm, will you continue to call the people you will have to represent stupid?
---
I’ve lived in lowsec for around 7 years (while I have dabbled elsewhere) and there’s nothing quite like it.
---
I’d like to draw on my experience roaming null to explain why I love lowsec. In null you rarely get the feeling of a true good fight, it’s usually catching someone who doesn’t want to fight or fighting a response fleet that just wants to continue ratting.
---
In lowsec we are all brothers in the pursuit of blowing shit up. Despite the most heinous smack talk you can imagine, I have always had respect for my my lowsec brothers because I know that when they fight me, it is truly for the love of the game and PvP and nothing else. No sov, no isk to be made, no objective, no politics. Just guns blazing and glory in fire.
---
I’ve lost literal billions to the same guys who have blobbed the shit out of me countless times over actual years and I still like them. Show me any space where someone can say that with a smile.
---
CCP_Round(-0.1) = 0
---
By outsourcing the tedious parts to other people.
---
Most of my income generation is from passive sources, and I pretty much just log in for pings.
---
So, I don't feeling I'm wasting my time grinding for money, or wasting my time searching for content.
---
Is this a playstyle for everyone? Absolutely not. But if you just want to log in, shoot a few spaceships, and not worry about replacing any ships you lose, then you could do a lot worse.
---
In short, I'm faceless line member 27431. I'm fine with that, eve is just a game. I can do be a big fish in a small pond in other places. 
---
Having said that, you don't need to be the mittani, or sort dragon, or vily, or some big personality to be a big fish. There are so many important actors behind the curtain that are essential to keeping things running for their respective groups who do not desire or actively shun the line light.
---
Corps vary. You probably want to leave the one you're currently in. Some of the other comments here have suggested large newbie corps that have a better culture than what you've described. If you're looking for a smaller group, I'd suggest looking at the ads in r/evejobs. Ask questions in people's threads. Talk to recruiters.
---
This is the kind of thing where you will be given every opportunity to settle for a "good enough" fit. I 100% guarantee there are corps out there whose cultures match what you're looking for. The trick will be to find them.
---
Renters bot, and water is wet.
---
Eyyy I think you linked this in fleet like 2hrs ago? 😎😎 I c u
---
I have been in two corps with women in high positions of power, CEO in one case, and they were great. People that think alike will get together and play. If you don't think like your corpmates go find new ones. A bit of advise though: nobody likes social justice activists, I even think it is the case for other social justice activists.
---
Thank your current alliance for having had you and go find yourself a group that you are happy to call friends.
---
You'll never agree with everybody you meet and play with, and some people will be bullies no matter what. Don't take insults from anyone, but don't make a personal attack out of someone's obnoxious opinion. People often have cringeworthy ideas about things and and express them. Sometimes you can disagree openly, but often it won't be a hill you will want to die on.
---
/u/Olmeca_Gold poke for visibility to you
---
Definitely not normal.
---
Get out, the grass is definitely greener else where.
---
The only change that will reduce botting is by giving team security more resources.
---
Killing a few vnis doesn't stop botting, if anything It just means they have to make MORE bots to account for the downtime between replacing vnis.
---
It would of been more interesting if you, Stainguy ran for CSM 😆
---
I'm just a boring regular line member so I've no idea exactly what caused the drama.  My best guess is that he either got annoyed at his lack of progression with in the FC team.  Or came up with a bunch of weird and wonderful ideas which were shot down, probably in a fairly harsh fashion.  In my 13 years experience of eve, that sort of harsh dismissive attitude is endemic across the game.
---
That'd be the first option then. They are people who live in wormholes. Depending on who you ask, who "counts" as a wormholer will vary a bit, but it'll be some combination of having your stuff stored in wormholes, spending time flying in wormholes, or doing PVP in wormholes.
---
probably already said but, go ask FCON about that
---
remove local
---
Trick question. CSM doesn't lobby anything.
---
&gt;There are so many important actors behind the curtain 
---
Sp00ky, where's my tinfoil?
---
I don't say CCP should care about zkillboard padding. Sad people will pad regardless and that's fine, zkillboard detects (most) of it.
---
I say CCP should have fixed the "deliver ship to x in WH structure, blow up structure, give x 1000+ losses" because by not fixing it, they have given people who care too much about these things an outlet for their stupidity. 
---
If it had been fixed, none of this would have happened.
---
Ye accept they have had minimal recruits from B0t. After Sadus, the manager of PB and goons latest rental initiative, was on TiS. He talked about how the 600 bots banned in Peligro’s first disclosure, were bots ‘stolen’ from B0t and exposed due to goons more ‘tribe’ based business model. So I went through Dotlan and evewho for all the corps in PBLRD and check where they came from. There was one small Corp that had been in B0t, the largest Corp was an alt/bot-farm Corp called PLA Associates. It doesn’t take a genius to work out who PBLRD now serves as a botting haven providing plausible deniability for the wizard hat.
---
Ektallion is a meme in eve RU community. This man fits his dread with a cloak instead of siege and always aligns out when dreadbombing.
---
Actually, losing 0.1 Gj/s means it'll run out in 41,500 seconds, which works out to just over 11 and a half hours. So it's conceivably possible for this fit to run out of cap before DT, especially since cap regeneration is nonlinear.
---
It might be rounded up though.
---
Nope. Like i am to old for this.     
---
While i am tempted to visit Iceland ... i prefer to do it as a tourist rather than sit in CCP office.     
---
Also lets be honest here i am not good person for CSM as my idea how the game should work is very specific and unappealing to most of the players.            
---
For example - for me capital ships should be truly a capital ships that need you need to grind down before you can take them down.     
---
Multiple weapon emplacement to fight off smaller targets. (lets be honest PVE in capitals should not exist from my perspective)         
---
Mining should be totally reworked as passive activity - people should move around New Eden as this is "content and generate content" in opposite to sitting on a belt for hours and hours.                 
---
Most of the space should be NPC with **small pockets of sov space**.               
---
So each region is 80% NPC ... and 20% of it (at most) is small sov pockets. (look at fountain ... and reverse NPC /SOV space to have idea what i am talking about.              
---
There should be no CYNO in lowsec ...                 
---
So yes i am not a good CSM candidate.
---
I subbed for years and years and did nothing but log in every so often to update my skill queue. Now I have a lot of SP and the few places I've tried to get into a corp I'm looked at as a spai lol.
---
CSM cannot assign budget to any team within CCP.       
---
Olmeca is a CSM candidate so i simply want to know what he want to do and how he want to lobby for the change.
---
you know that will disagree with this
---
I insure my Gnosis for the full 1.4 isk every time.
---
They can't assign devs to work on things either.
---
I bet it is rounded up, and while it display **-0.1%** it is much much lower value.
---
Wait you actually have to go sit in an office in Iceland if you are elected for CSM? Didn’t know that.
---
I think you’re wrong, disregarding all the trolling and shitposting that you might come up once in a while, I actually agree with everything you stated plus I’m sure that I’m not the only one that thinks so.
---
Olmeca gold is goning hate it locked in a office focusing on stuff that ccp wan'ts to work on and then not being able to talk about it for 5-7 years.
---
If this year they am not going to focus on botting then hes out of luck
---
Acceleration (in absolute, meters/s² terms) is proportional to max speed in eve, so speed buffs don't affect align times. Simulate an overdrive and check.
---
I think probably games hone a mental skill or fulfill a psychological need that is not being addressed by other activities. That's why the game pulls you in. Perhaps you need to become more patient. EVE is fundamentally a waiting simulator, so you'll learn that for sure. Or maybe you want to became more persevering, or consistent, or organised. I am quite convinced games play a psychological role, training the mind for things, although this is just speculation. What do you think? Does it make you feel less guilty?
---
Couple things.
---
1-- Multi-boxing is not outlawed. *Input broadcasting* is outlawed, and *multiboxing alpha accounts* is outlawed. Since alphas can't fly barges anyway, you'll be fine as long as you don't input broadcast or otherwise bot.
---
2-- Plenty of folks multibox miners. In terms of feasibility, ask yourself how you plan to plex the accounts involved. If you're paying with $$, then anything is feasible and you should really just be asking yourself what you enjoy. If you're hoping to plex with earned isk, I think you're going to have some trouble. The numbers I've heard recently for Rorqual mining are \~100m isk/hr. You need about 2b isk/month to plex an account (and I would plan for that number continuing to rise). A barge is a lower isk and sp investment than a Rorqual. It has a lower earning potential, but let's be generous and stick with the current numbers. This means your first \~20 hours of mining per month are devoted to maintaining your accounts. If you aren't planning to do at least this much mining, I would advise you not to go the mining fleet route.
---
3-- Personal opinion here: Only do forms of isk-making that you enjoy. It sounds like you don't really like mining, and are hoping that multiboxing it will make it more interactive. You're not wrong, but you might want to consider Abyssal filaments--a new form that has good single-box isk making potential. If you hate "shooting red boxes" (as a corpmate of mine describes ratting), jump freightering for Pandemic Horde also appears to be pretty lucrative right now as I gather they're more-or-less deployed across New Eden at the moment.
---
He goes to whatever fight is going on around in ecm ceptors. He is 100% killboard whore
---
That is misinformation by CCP, the REAL best ship is championship. But they have been trying to hide it for years.
---
Don't get dizzy ....
---
I keep my main account subscribed all the time, even if I only log in casually to join some NPSI fleets.
---
The other replies are correct that you want Drones V, but it's probably important to say why:
---
Many ships that are not "drone boats" nevertheless have a drone bay, and the ability to field a full complement of 5 drones matters a ton to all of those ships. If you're sticking to frigates and destroyers, there are quite a few with no drone bay, or which only field a single drone, and so you can neglect drone skills with no (or manageable, in the case of 1-drone ships) impact. Once you get up to cruisers, you're looking at the non-drone-boats being able to field 3-5 drones... and then you really want those drone skills.
---
&gt;whore
---
Oh okay. I cant believe someone is that much of a kb whore  xD
---
LOL..
---
Snowflake man up
---
Yeah I'm sure Volta and Tuskers take brand new players who haven't tried the game...?
---
You are "visiting" iceland for summits not sitting in the office.
---
Oh right, had no clue. 
---
It does seem tedious tho if you have a lot of responsibilities and a career..
---
Sorry to hear. Sucks when anything fails in a PC. Pita
---
Name and shame them, grab whatever you can and change corps.
---
Hopefully by telling ccp to give team security more resources, as they are the only one capable of dealing with bots.
---
Except they’re not being assholes unless it’s all directed at her (which OP didn’t say it was) they’re just talking about politics
---
How quickly do you need your items? If you put up buy orders at Jita sell+30%, I'm confident people will fill those orders. I bet if you put up buy orders at Jita sell+10%, they'd fill.
---
Yeah, oh well, new Super Flower 1600W 80Plus titanium coming today so should be back shooting shit this evening :)
---
No one wants to be a part of my blue donut fc what do
---
It is nice to get new shiny stuff... Especially if it gets you back gaming
---
Yeah, it sets me up for my next major upgrades too so it's not all bad news, I just wish my hardware problems would time themselves for months when I havent already spent a fortune. :D
---
This is wrong. 
---
B0t haven't been owned by panfam since its beginning 
---
Also PBLRD has less years renting, and less renters, which means the scale of botting must be higher to even make the chart.
---
hi i'm test. kill all botters you find. blue, green, purple, whatever color works for me as long as they end up dead.
---
"Its okay to bot as long as your alliance doesn't make money from it"
---
Kewl
---
Try a Spacemouse, CCP implemented them a few month ago: https://www.3dconnexion.com/products/spacemouse.html
---
we are still waiting for discount codes, if i get them ill post them on reddit.
---
Yeah i get that too. My GPU decided it had enough RIGHT after i bought an oculus rift... So i had to fork out for a replacement at the same time.
---
Why has this only just become an issue to you since they moved to period basis.
---
Ouch, in my case I just paid for a vacation with my nieces so yeah, similar pain.
---
Yep but if you are going to CSM you want to achieve something.     
---
So you need to have goals and ideas how to achieve them.
---
You cant do that, Dave. I think.
---
Oh well at least you get a holiday out of it ;)
---
Thats why Champion Ship is 10 mil in Jita and Friend Ship only 2 mil.
---
Rgr! Thanks!
---
Good alliances/corps dont give a shit. If anything, they will make fun of you like the guys. As long as you are not an attention seeker, no issues. Additionally, good leadership will also deal with the random creepers that will appear as well. Had to deal with a few of those before, but they are typically rare.
---
Never experienced anything like that on coms for as long I've played eve, on my 8th year atm.
---
Name and shame is in order.
---
Also, join horde, only got one rule. Don't be a dick.
---
I am not drunk (atm)        
---
Simply we have WH space with minimal population and K space where most players live.       
---
If you ask people why they don't want to live in WH space -&gt; most of them will tell you "because there is no local".             
---
**Based on this you can safely assume that with removal of local eve can lose a lot of players and we cannot afford this**          
---
What more eve should be about multiple mechanics and play styles not about single one.         
---
Least but not least ... we are getting older. Lets face it. Work a bit on getting some kids and you will see how useful local is when you need to go away from your PC 6 times per hour.
---
It'll only go up in price now they have stopped them.
---
Why tho
---
My toons are subbed but between work and life i havent actually played in a few months. Log in at most once a week, roam for an hour, rinse and repeat.
---
Merlin is perfect, neutron blasters, medium shield extender, 2x mag stab and a damage control.
---
Man up pussy
---
and then what?
---
Despite what Olmeca is doing is God's work
---
I'm not sure most EVE players have 70+ alts sitting around and **actively doing stuff**
---
100% free camera movement. Any direction, no zoom restriction, not tied to your own ship. Some very cool effects can be achieved with it. If you want to do alliance propaganda or similar, you can use the mouse to its full extent. But has no advantage for normal players in  game
---
Not if the CItadel is in final timer.
---
You can still deliver things but they can't trash it
---
They get people to test (in part at least) by giving free sisi SP.
---
It's a $300+ dollar mouse designed for CAD and other similar programs. If you're buying this to make eve propaganda you're a moron
---
Well, in that case winning the lottery could also be a goal you want to achieve. You have slightly worse chances of achieving your goal in the lottery than in the CSM, but the mechanics are the same. Someone else decides if you achieve your goal or not.
---
What?
---
Look at all of the times he's donated to zkill, clearly they're allowing it XD
---
Technically yes, but it depends on when they set their structure timer. The structure timer always occurs on the day and time of the defender's choosing. You can do it with 2 leshaks, but not if they're actually around to defend the structure, and it's fit the right way (subcapital weapons, ECM mids)
---
Legit bullying Mr Rive, wtf
---
Awww, I didn't make it in.
---
Openly declaring your intent to violate the NDA is a good way to get CCP to invalidate your candidacy. I suggest thinking before karma chasing.
---
424 pages if anyone was wondering
---
#nopoors, the SpaceMouse Compact is ~150 euro.
---
But we got the SpaceMouse Pro (~350 euro) for free. :D
---
Yeah you need to know your thousands from your millions if you want the time you spend playing Eve not to be a waste
---
Come to Goons...we have Queerswarm and that kind of bullshit is not tolerated at all!
---
Yeah, the corpmates going "why the fuck are all movie about girl power" or whatever, that's just talking about it. If they are going "fuck all LGBT people, hope they die" that's them being an assholes in general.
---
I.e put a pause in for every ship you can eject, similar to cargo cans.
---
PL the only Alliance who can read a post and show up at the right time, what a world.
---
Grrr Goonies
---
&gt; B0t haven't been owned by panfam since its beginning 
---
founded as joint venture by PL and XiX in 2013, sold to NCdot in 2014
---
I do and i don't even have many useful skills to train anymore.
---
I don't think any of the CSM member could affect CCP's development plan much
---
Just enjoy a good Icelandic dinner and probably get ganked in a pillow fight by the rest 9 CSM members from goons
---
That answer on alliance bookmarks was great, it sucks we dont have them but its obviously a bigger issue than anyone other than an advanced coder/developer would understand.
---
They want, we want it, but re-writing that shit obviously isnt easy or it'd be done by now.
---
Don't think this works anymore after the PG nerf last week. Can be solved by using a Veles gun, though. 
---
Also dronebay got removed.
---
Actual good music on a PvP video, the rarest of the rare
---
Also, a command to GET timers.
---
If you have a decent fit and manage to catch interceptors (lots of them in nullsec) you can easily win the fight as well. They are very weak at actual combat.  Other possible targets are haulers doing PI.
---
meh, NC/PL always played the +1 supercap game (in particular versus weaker groups). 
---
Guess Goons now beat em at both
---
Also got that dude to self destruct trying to get 1 second on his abort timer. Op success!
---
Legacy code in its natural habitat
---
Since the owner changes on delivery, can this be abused to cause sp loss with t3cs? (They still cause sp loss if you arent inside them right?)
---
It's probably a pain in the ass to fix because deliveries are designed to be impossible to reject and instantly included in your assets once delivered. That doesn't make it okay that it's possible, though.
---
Until they figure out a fix they could block ship deliveries in WHs. Contracts would still serve that purpose.
---
 No elite stuff. just little bit of my story 
---
also big shout out to my corp mate, sniper bro15
---
who first soloed ikitursa without using ikitursa
---
 [https://zkillboard.com/kill/77056098/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77056098/)
---
I dont care about what Mittens is saying. It s obviously wrong.
---
But this need to be compensate by the fact that WERMT / BOT was full of NC / PL pve alt because killboard warrior....
---
Shitty alliance, run away and never look back.
---
That was extremely satisfying to watch.
---
Shitty alliance, shitty people.
---
There's much nicer places in EvE - I myself am part of a group that memes actively but despite that is very accepting of everyone - and I'm sure there's many more people like that.
---
Gatefire Skins incomming!
---
Idk the way I read it she wasn’t quoting them there, she seemed to be embellishing
---
I myself was in the same position - but I made an effort to find a group of people that make me feel like I belong.
---
Besides being a nice bunch, they also have a list of tasks that need doing - so I help along.
---
That helps keep me busy, entertained - and along the way I set myself some goals of my own.
---
IMO it's really important to have a goal and manage your actions towards said goal.
---
process pi? i used to adjust my plants PI setup all the time docked in the station.
---
I've lived in lowsec since 2006, so before FW and Black Rise existed. 
---
For me history wise, #burnhuola in the summer of 2014 was a huge event in Lowsec.  A battle that raged for (iirc) the first two weeks in July.  Amarr and friends had finally joined forces and were coming to dethrone the Huola contingent of Minmil.  Predominantly made up Iron Oxide and Late Night Alliance and friends.
---
I think we saw over **15k** ships exploded in those couple of weeks just in and around the area.  It was attracting attention from far and wide and many groups came to visit, but for the most part got dunked by either of or both militias.

Ultimately Minmil were victorious, but one FC in particular stood out - Major Trant had already lost one home to the same group of Amarr in their push for Arzad.  He refused to let this one go, in a 24 hour period he FC'd the relentless grind that is FW plex warfare with hardly a break and his push broke the back of the aggressors logistical capability - they simply ran out of ships and numbers to contest us on the field.
---
The fight has kinda been forgotten, and doesn't have the glitz or glamour of the nullsec cap fights.  However this was an extremely dynamic environment and specialist wings developed new tactics within this engagement.  
---
There was too much going on to write down here, and my view as a minor Minmil FC is reasonably one sided, the war of words on the eve-o forums is just a story in itself.  And many pilots made a name for themselves in this battle.
---
But our victory was ultimately bitter sweet. We won on the field, but were burnt out, we couldn't do it again at such a scale and the Huola Cartel (as we were dubbed) ended up dissolving and going our separate ways with many leaving the game for good.
---
For me, that one fight showcased lowsec at it's best.  It's a shame it's mostly forgotten.
---
Same thing happens on the 32 bit client also
---
yes? So what i said was true
---
you should see the shit goons say, shouting 'NCdock' while they run from our undocked fleets,
---
or yesturday while they memed NCdock while we camped theyre battleship fleet, in thier own space, in a citadel, bubble fucked it to hell, they all spawned rookie ships and took the cowards way out xD (to be fair it was pretty funny to watch every goon running for thier escape xD)
---
they scream tht they are winning this 'war' when panfam are heavily outnumbered in all aspects, at every engagement, yet NC. have killed almost 100bill more than Goons have thus far. even with all the shit they structure bash, and slowly gain ground at extreamly high cost, with no huge strategical placements yet.
---
this, this is why panfam, nc. are laughing at goons, because anything a goon member says, is incorrect or weak, just like thier FC's skill
---
Me too (3-&gt;93-&gt;95)! Currently in a silver Volvo xc70 - no Eve stickers yet, but I do have one that's the insignia of the First Order ;)
---
Good omens
---
it's funny as hell and besides, who unironically cares about killboards?
---
Why don't you just leave?
---
This has cost me more kills than I can count.
---
Simply remove deliveries. They were introduced when contracts(or was it direct trade?) didn't work on citadels, nowadays we don't need them anymore.
---
Contracts might require a few more clicks to set up but are the superior system anyways, especially considering that items from the deliveries hangar can not be contracted/passed on remotely, and have to be taken out of that hangar manually.

You assume the CSM can make changes

Olmeca just think : 2% goon bots is way less than 16% of your pimp masters nc bots. That was the main reason why Tribute and Venal are gone now!

Also don't buy Moloks from PenifSmash if you want to be on the csm for long...

you said that it was NOT owned by PanFam since beginning, so no, not true, as at all times one of the later PanFam members was owner ...
---
Pathetic

&gt;you're a moron

Or you have enough money that $300 is "spend on a whim" money. If so, I will take one for the team and switch places with that person.
---
i mean, stop shooting cyno jammers and fights like this will go on endlessly xD
---
yeh doubleing your enemys numbers in both sub cap and caps is definatly when not to jump in lol
---
&gt;Based on this you can safely assume that with removal of local eve can lose a lot of players and we cannot afford this
---
incorrect assumption
---
well ... I guess if you do not call this quibbling, you are right ...
---
No. Even if you eject from your T3C right before it dies you wont lose any SP
---
To paraphrase Mittens:
---
The grrr goons community have made out that Delve is full of dirty cheating botters, including Elo Knight who tried to make it his platform for the CSM election. That chart of shame proved that GSF has among the lowest count of botting bans in the game and that the grr goons community were full of shit. Elo has abruptly went silent given that the chart proves that Fraternity has among the highest percentage of botters in the game, the very people he was going to rely on for votes.
---
The Greater Western Co-Prosperity sphere is a rental organisation whose members have largely been poached from NC.'s renter alliance. Surprise, surprise, they're full of botters as is typical for rental alliances. GSF does not have responsibility for policing them, if you see a bot, kill it and report it, then kill it again for good measure, go nuts, we don't give a crap.
---
Olmeca have you even thought through that being on the CSM will require? Do you have a history of getting along with people? You are aware that most of the CSM members take around a $1500USD loss in expenses when attending the summit aren't you? It's not a free holiday to Iceland, it's a week of meetings where you work for free. That plus weekly conference calls which you also don't get paid for.
---
you realise you can just pod yourself in any of the many ways to do so.... takes a few seconds
---
It’s not about BIG meaningful fights, it’s about small meaningful fights. The ones where you get a ping from your old corporation asking you to lend a hand and defend an Astra.
---
The ones where you and your 4-5 man gang tackle a Snuff cyno dread just for shits and giggles. And where your HIC pilots forgets to bring it.
---
Its when you get home from Jita after asking 20+ times if anyone wants anything and then just as you dock up someone says “Can you bring me X” and you go back anyways.
---
It’s someone giving you some extra cash for bringing their stuff down from jita and you just buying more. Causing the weirdest passive aggressive fight you’ve ever been in (I’m looking at you Elliot)
---
It’s when you undock your first Bhaalghorn and nearly shit yourself when you see that +1, cause you have no idea who they are.
---
Because while the war that is “WWB” or “Blue doughnut” are meaningful, nobody remembers the person on the KM, no one remembers the dictor pilot... Sorry 100+ dictor pilots. They remember the event. So null sec is meaningful but the people are meaningless. And low sec, well that’s just the opposite. Meaningless content (in terms of no titans or 300 man fleet fights), but meaningful in people. And that’s why it’s so special.

  Lol "force"

Sorry to ask but how can i do burner missions?  Articles on this subject ate 6 years old.

I do but only because I really don't want people to see the embarrassments I call fits

hi judy

Delete killboard.

No killboard free intel, no padding, better way of life :=)

Is this real? lol

Peace and friendship is not why anybody ever played this game
---
That's really not normal, I would haul my ass out of there as soon as possible and join someone else.
---
Did I get it right, you guys do not like that I tanked them?
---
Well, I have like a lot of videos when I did not. It's not so interesting since they're short, but I guess you suggest that it's better?
---
Not at all dude, I do exactly the same.
---
Good work.

Im going to get a ice cream

floating point precision everyone!

I really would love some cool cinematic screen-in-screen, with one being first person and the other being some dramatic 3rd person angle stuff going on. Nothing functional but would look nice on videos (marketing perspective) and during play, rather than just the overview and zoomed out stuff. I think CCP really underestimates the potential there
---
Could also make the argument for Init. because they joined the cfc in 2012-2013 while their renter alliance was created in 2009.
---
Northern Associates also has 6% while not even having any sov and effectively being shutdown since early 2016 which ameks their scale look bad aswell.
---
Okay, but my "math" was pretty simple, I saw that I can tank 4 Brutix + Retrib and I hoped that I'll be able to deal with anything they'd add.
---
It did not feel like I knew they could not kill me at all.
---
As has been mentioned, this is a known defect from a while ago that can occur randomly when graphics drivers are out of date and updating drivers has fixed this in all known previous encounters with this bug :)
---
We have that aswell to some extend, not so extreme but it exists.
---
Sov defence happens multiple times a week, but usally not in those sizes like other nullsec alliances - more like 300-350 people at maximum.
---
Auth systems like SEAT are used by my alliance for sure, easier to keep track of people and maybe get rid of *some* spais.
---
Additional there are some 3rd party tools like intel readers to display them on a map (Spyglass), but they are not a have must.. some people use them, some don't.
---
It's called key binds, google it, it's awesome.
---
Can I join you guys?"

Could be, hoping she didnt claim  corp mates said things they didnt say.

yes.

I personally would like them to get rid of bounty pay outs and introduce dog tags that you have to take to highsec to hand in. It won't solve botting problem but will make it more difficult for them and introduce some sort of risk factor as they might got caught on the way
---
That's accurate in today's meta, historically there have been big FW pushes for home systems.  All in cruiser hulls and down that have involved a reasonably high percentage of LS dwellers, whether they've been in FW or not.
---
It's always been the place to get small gang content, where both sides are willing participants (unlike NS) but there are points in time where things have escalated into a proper ding dong which were somewhat meaningful and did shift the landscape.  Granted for someone undocking for instant solo action it might go unnoticed, but certainly in the past it was there.
---
Isn't that a potential bot behavior?
---
Thanks for your response, I actually updated my drivers little over a week ago so I’d be surprised if that’s the case but I’ll definitely have a look into it. :)
---
i know what it is but it looks a bit to simular in this video.
---
that you dont see that is not impressive.
---
It was a pleasant surprise that it's not most for wormholes.
---
There's some corps that will guarantee blob you, but lots of people just fly whatever they like. That is why I like wh-space, many people is okay with not guaranteed win.

i dont mind your calling out hypocrites, but when its so obvious that theres an anti-goon agenda in every single thing you post, one must consider the actual severity of the problem
---
not sure about this
---
I hear there's this new thing called "timezones", and that it's possible to set your stuff to a "timezone" that your alliance is strong in. That way the single pissant frigate can't do anything because you have a bunch of friends who kill him long before he even starts to hack your sov.
---
I also understand that the more popular "timezones" are good times to get fights, so you don't have to complain about people not fighting you anymore!
---
Well I meant more the smaller neut corp/alliances that go around in provi.

If you- or someone- who is experiencing this issue submit a bug report from the client, and maybe along with SystemOutPrintIn's instructions to create a dump and attach it to your ticket. File your ticket under graphics, and mention CCP\_Nocturne in the title of your bug report. I will get the ticket and be able to investigate the issue properly, as I have not been able to reproduce this issue yet. I will keep trying in the meantime :)

Lowsec is where I go to make that dank isk. Nullseccer btw

agreed.

Yes good but what if you like boys? Can you make a slideshow for that?

Almost who reply just let them hatred flow out.

Every one must be fair with the others even against them self.

The thing that going on is keep what inside the game inside the game

without getting to real live stuff.

if you want to harm some one keep it inside the game via PVP or war.

Otherwise do not mention stuff you think you harm them with it inside the game

only but that actually will harm them in RL.

This is what happens when PL don't have P3AK to hold their hand and lead them through entosis ops....

Best to do it on final timer then the person cannot trash.

Hoe long did it take PL to tackle their botting problem? Oh wait it was ongoing. Give us the same time frame pls :)

People deliver stuff to someone in a citadel in a WH, unanchor or kill the citadel, and then a bunch of ships come out in cargo containers which you jettison and then kill

Sort of like how if you offload your keepstar to a neutral corp they aren't *your* keepstars any more?

I'm not saying something like that couldn't be programmed into a bot, but it's not typical bot behavior I've ever seen. All the bots I've encountered break once they cant warp back to the safe area. They dont typically blob on the person attacking one of their fellow bot slaves.

And I know clever bot and certain other AI programs can hold a conversation with a live person but I dont think ratting bot programers are gonna go that far.

Remember when the honeybadger coalition turned up on our doorstep with the whole of Eve and we were told to just deal with it.

What is a good price to sell PLEX
---
The last one I was involved in directly was the Galmil assault on the Calmil staging system of Okkamon in 2016 (I think?!), post introduction of Citadels.  With unlimited storage capacity and JFs pulling in thousands of ships there was no home system advantage for the Caldari.  I think we broke them in a day, my corp at the time decided to quit FW as a result and just 3rd party as pirates.  The challenge had gone, it looked like FW was on it's last legs so we jumped ship.  It felt like a lot of others started to do the same; FW as a whole lost a lot of it's invested FCs.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
I know there were other system pushes since then, Eha was one, but the scale had declined and the pirate alliances would ultimately get the final say, as they had the power to remove the structures and the militias could no longer compete.
---
I think it's useful to look back and understand how game mechanics have had an impact upon Lowsec.  Taking Militia staging or home systems were a huge achievement for us, that gave us a sense of success and we were able to plan future objectives based around this.
---

CCP obviously meant to introduce more Precursor factions, and none of the Triglavian ships use missiles. Someone at CCP probably accidentally submitted this update without realising that everyone would see it before the "official" Scope annoucement.

tell that to the, i dunno. 50goons that all undocked from a raitaru while we camped them just to run from us.

is why goons, no matter thier numbers STILL havent just moved in and swept away NC.

because how you guys think its works, it doesnt.

Snakes in a black hole wormhole are one hell of a drug

I wont deny that if the fight seems unwinnable that more times than not we flee, but are you telling me that our enemies dont do the same?
---
In last 3 years I just said there is as much botting in goon lands as anywhere else. Your leaders interpret it the way you said because they use fodder personalities to hate against to unite your alliance behind.
---
The list doesn't mean much. It doesn't show people who don't get reported, who get temp banned, or who don't get permabanned. I roam in your space and specifically kill your botter supers. And then I come here argue with the zealous goon metagamer who never undocks in delve to check what's going on in his space.
---
That was with it.

Good find buddy i dont know how i overlooked this.... Also dont the Liminals already have a ridiculous amount of disintegration?

The launcher is 32 bit either way

maybe a bit less, your were just being homophomic in local

I see quite a variety of colors and ships here, nice shot!
---
I agree with the other precursors due to the new skills not being called Triglavian, as well as market subcatagories for Precursor stuff.
---
50 vs 80..... those kind of odds, in all the actual fights so far have been exactly that. but to goons favour. panfam takes those fights were they can and wins the isk war.
---
goon never stop memeing about nc running and docking. when they do the same yet worse.
---
hence me saying, its funny to see it happen again. and goon leadership just makes the call, keel over and die, leave your ships there. spawn a rookie ship and undock
---
&gt; I wont deny that if the fight seems unwinnable that more times than not we flee.
---
Difference being unwinnable for one group is being out numbered &gt;2:1, for the other it's being blobbed 1:1.
---
yes me a gay talking to my other gay corp mate about gay things is homophobia got it
---
Not to spit goon propaganda at you, but the isk war means jack to the Imperium. They are burning NC's backyard because they can, and so far NC.  is doing a pretty crap job of stopping them. Heck. A keepstar was openly attacked eariler and NC didnt even form.
---
someone used "bored" corvette
---
Oh your point that it wasn't owned by panfam from the beginning is wrong. PL ran it and then "sold" it when fozzie sov hit. After that NC ran it but paid a cut to PL and later on even horde.

No offense to my alliance, but I think if you pit 100 goons vs 100 pan fam guys in 100 1v1s. Panfam will win 85-90% of them. Simply put. They have better pilots who know their ships and game mechanics well. Goons strategy revolves around outnumbering their opponate with lesser skilled pilots. You turn that 1v1 into 2v1 in favor of goons. I would say 85-90% in goons favor.
---
not to spit NC. Properganda in response, but the structures and territory taken or killed so far means even less to NC. at least thats what im told.
---
there are important structures. ie Keepstars but they are yet to be fought over yet.
---
maybe the citadel system is new to you. but on first attack generally the attacker does it in thier own favoured TZ, the defender, sets his timer to either suit thier TZ or to be as far away from the enemy TZ as possable.
---
which means more early EU, late late US/ AUTZ fights, that so far NC. havent been doing to bad at, only outnumbered by like 3;1 or so. much easier odds.
---
im not 100% certain goons will make it as far as the line members think they will on this deployment. not without truely proving they care not for isk and whelp supers like theyre nothing to gain proper ground.
---
but im pretty sure goons clearing tribute completly of panfam, if it happens wont be a shock to panfam, goon numbers just cant quite cut the insane numbers gap at full forms. theyre beter, but theres limits.
---
o7
---
My point was that there have been more owners than PANFAM. It was founded by pl and xix.
---
i never said it wasn't their renters.
---
Yeah I bet there are about 240 honest real people like you that collectively lose 500 VNIs each month.
---
Leave this crap asap! 
---
Like war irl are. Like people that fight in these wars.
---
Where did my anti bot post touch you? You seem overly hostile against a post merely against botting.
---
What you do is grab fistfull of sand and push it in the other kids eyes and underwear then stand point a finger and laugh.
---
Olmeca doesn't have plans. He doesn't even understand the part of the game he does play, much less any other part.
---
Remember when excavator drone sizes were increased so that you could not just throw them all into a Wetu? He fought against that because he believed it gave miners MORE safety. In reality it just meant that his way of ISK generation was being nerfed, just like the Rorqual was being nerfed, which is something he has lobbied for for quite some time. Basically, he cannot see how the two activities are tied together, so REEEES about it on Reddit instead.
---
yeh, loosing an interceptor hurts somone.
---
but astrahus's, ihub's, maybe a fort, some cyno jammers. 
---
yeh that shit real hurts these multi trillion isk owning blocs
---
You mean your blank google doc? Yes, we all saw it.
---
Wasnt actually asking to join a corp just wanted to say hi and talk to people bout the game...
---
god damn n+1 pillow fight mechanics
---
Hopefully this is a joke, this issue is present regardless of which client you use since the update. It creates and doesn't close a large number of redundant launcher processes and you have to manually kill them in task manager.
---
Fozziesov mechanics are great. The only people who hate them are alliances that hold way more space then they actually use. I mean if you lived and used a system and a sov trolling frigate turns  up you could easily drive him off grid within a minute or two and it would take them ages to actually successfully entosis an objective, What you are probably whining about is the fact you have to jump 10 systems to try and defend an unused system with an ADM of 1.
---
if/when goons delve and entire area gets Rf'd destroyed, so many timers even goons cant make them all,
---
loosing faction structures, keepstars and all the others shit left and right,
---
what would goons say, meh, we got more, meh, we dont care we will hold the line somewhere just you wait.
---
the leadership will have all the irreplaceable faction citadels they really want un-anchored.
---
So my idea about EVE is very simple.     
---
Let multiple gameplay styles coexist.       
---
Lack of cyno (even in the FW systems only) leads to situation where ... **you cannot be hot dropped**    
---
So this means that :              
---
* You can take fights without of fear that the moment you engage cyno will be light and you are dealing with carriers and supers       
---
* No bridging means you need to move around before you can do something, so gate control starts to be quite important         
---
* If you gate capital in the area - no way to get instant fax support but at the same time no way to extract safely fast from many places.               
---
* But also what is quite important lowsec will be place where small people can develop without fear of constant drops from groups like Snuff.              
---
Different mechanics will lead to different play style.
---
legion of Death and solar mostly banned by rmt not by botting
---
I see the issue : forums.eveonline.com
---
the efforts to harrass delve were ended conveniently the day after welp squad was deployed to defend, and not because Panfam was running away and abandoning the narrative of burning delve while we were gone, or not because they cared about those neutral structures they dropped for the games benefit, nah becuase they were called back to defend home right...
---
But look seriously if the game decides to evict goons np, structure bashing tribute is bad, i'd hate to be in the alliance that decides structure bashing delve is a good idea have you actually been for a trip there recently?
---
You can.
---
Source : i did it during 2 years.
---
Try getting pure -10 not -9.9999 without bursting or smartbombing.        
---
Getting out of -10 is quite easy, just use tags.       
---
From -10 to 0 is like 100-120 mil in tags.
---
It's also on my csm candidacy page
---
I doubt it's about being a spy as it is about being useful. Since you do not lots of experience flying the stuff you trained for you really don't have those skills.
---
care to link?
---
Exactly. This guy is just whining because low index systems nobody uses in the arse end of Malpais/The Spire keep getting attacked and if any is successful then they have to attend a CTA a few days later to make sure nobody actually follows through with the attack, which stops their krabbing for an hour. Just let them entosis the shit systems - 95% of the time nobody actually follows through with an attack anyway.
---
Nothing to do with botting you just come across extremely annoying
---
Thats brilliant
---
https://community.eveonline.com/community/csm/candidate?id=4484146
---
god, can you imagine the onslaught, non stop war, non stop content, non stop goon super kills (and im sure attacking side loss too)
---
GODDAMN i hope that all the blocs left turn and fight goons, it would be EPIC
---
i could laugh at goons for staying docked until CTA's or staying docked incase flashforms. bashing all the keepsand worthwhile shit all in one system held. time after timer.
---
man i think i got a semi just thinking of attacking goons and wiping the floor with mittanis ego xD
---
Sorry if I annoyed you with my anti bot stance
---
I asked some Corp mates earlier if it was possible (since I’m pretty new and didn’t know if it actually is) and they confirmed it. But only in a couple ships if you wanna do it with a ship like a rattle because it’s so large
---
They forgot to shut off the bit coin miner on close...oops.
---
Every goon propaganda post that exists is related to massive losses, as we can see in this equation: 
---
    (goon killmail) = (feelings)*propaganda^2
---
Doesnt the cap recharge rate peak around 25%? That drain is probably not enough to climb over that
---
Giving it -50 points and -100 mil isk per kill would even better 😉
---
 /o\ community.eveonline.com
---
You mean you took what Mitten said seriously in the first place? It seemed just a propaganda piece to me.
---
Renters are good money, it was obvious that this war was to provide both content to line members under the guise of "kill the evil bot protectors' and cause B0T to lack stability and therefore move customers to PBLRD. Its a clever move, provides content, war against their ancient enemy and helps secure goons more income.
---
i dont think you've had the pleasure of enjoying a good structure bashing, you might have a semi for the 1st 12 hours, but the follow 800 hours might not be so fun
---
But you will never understand that in goons there is so many new players who start from bottom with VNI and lost them on daily basis... am not covering them, there it must be some botter but not all 500... am saying from perspective where i used to play in goons from my very first days to almost super, and only god and zkillboard know how many VNIs i lost ...
---
"Intruders" this mentality is why all wormholes should be blazed and the carebears in them evicted.
---
How is that in any way relevant? Is it ok to bot as long as an active alliance is benefiting from it and willing to defend sov?
---
but it would be so many entitys, numerous fleets all hitting different structures and hitting timers. fight for a system, then bash the keepstar or whatever but instead of one theres 2.
---
would be years before content dried up
---
Hey how about you start cleaning from TAPI space, it won't take much time to identify the bots
---
again, it just screams to me that you've never done it and dont understand it, so im going to leave this conversation here and you enjoy that dream
---
It's not your stance on botting that annoys everyone, it's you blindness to any botting groups other than goons, who by all rights dont seem to bot as much as other groups.
---
I don't really think you have an issue with botters. I think you have a personal issue with Mittanni. What is it between you two?
---
&gt; I was both and neither.
---
So backseat driving, I see.
---
Join Horde. The corp for spais that have been rejected by all the other corps.
---
You can't physically defend a keepstar against critical mass of titans, there's no concievable way to clear DPS in 30 minutes. It's simply common sense to unanchor them and throw them back down in a month or two, and if you're unironially upset that someone would dare do such a thing maybe you should have done something about it.
---
nice to hear the crys of i presume a goon about structure bashing.
---
yes ive done it, yes i hate it.
---
but when it comes with destroying goons, the biggest issue and threat to the game right now i would step up.
---
like now in the fight against goons my activity has quadrupled. i just cant get enough of shooting at goons.
---
Faction warfare and lurk in bsb chat.
---
Have you ever wanted your ship to look like actual, genuine space garbage? Tired of your ship being shiny and looking like it's ready for flight?
---
Looking for something that says "I haven't serviced this thing in years"?

---
* We're kidding, please be aware that the Triglavian collective is still going to shoot you in the face regardless of what SKIN your're wearing!
---
im unsure where you are seeing upset? an explosion is an explosion regardless of the corp its transfered too/ how many timers it took to get there/ and the act of picking up structures costs isk rigs are not free :)
---
Maybe this "war" is such a yawner, the best thing they have to make videos about is about a dumb Nyx pilot.
---
Wtf is this about?
---
His facial hair. That's it. That's enough.
---
Also citadel mechanics, we can't just dickswing our supers as it used to be because with current structure bashing mechanics, it is completely pointless to use anything bigger than a cruiser/battleship.
---
Try getting out of - 10 without tags.
---
See how easy it is to add arbitrary rules to your statements :)
---
Empty as a mango between your ears.
---
I think its getting serious, mittens mentioned olmeca fort the first time in fireside
---
but at the cruiser gangs standing between you and your main objective?
---
As some on trying to become more versed in combat, these are really nice. Totally my play style as well!
---
Not sure it's our skull that's cracked at the mi jte bro, but thanks for your concern.
---
the biggest issue and threat? until very recently that title was firmly in the hands of panfam, but they threw it away through egos and dirty dealings, infact right now most of the game is screaming revenge from the other side while shooting at you, TEST - fucked over by panfam, Sort dragon - fucked over by Panfam, how many smaller alliance have been flexed on and bullied by panfam? who knows they are all right now screaming revenge and taking their stabs
---
Did you not see olemca's response on his myspace blog? Yeah you didn't you lazy cunt.
---
dead falcon=best falcon
---
&gt; annoys everyone
---
I like the when people who drink the Goon koolaid speak in the name of everyone.
---
Do you want gates to stop working and wormholes to stop spawning? Because this is how you do it.
---
/s
---
I think you'll be hard pressed to find someone you don't annoy
---
PLA associates is commonly used by PLA/PIBC alts, same as COINS is heavily used by Frat. bots. That'd be as dumb as saying nobody in Frat. bots because their alts are in COINS.
---
But but but chinise dont bot
---
Never heard that one before, but I begrudgingly approve.
---
Smart move Stainliner
---
Is this a bromance blooming before our eyes?
---
/u/ashterothi can correct me but I don't think that anybody ended up figuring it out.
---
the best place to do that is in game :) do what you do and find like minded people who want to do the same thing
---
They always needed punching bag personalities to direct hate. That's their issue with me.
---
My issue is just looking at active regions nearby for whaling targets, seeing so many kills in PB, going there and realizing its all bots.
---
Indeed
---
We quarantined bots into an area where an alliance doesnt benefits of them (how generous) and went off to war against those would prefer benefiting from botting renters.
---
Keepstar rigs are relatively cheap considering you aren't investing in T2 production rigs. Unanchoring excess keepstars is simply a no brainer.
---
Post of the year?
---
PB "renters" dont pay rent tho
---
If you drink the Goon koolaid about me [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bslyuz/the_whaler_an_eve_documentary/) must have eaten you inside out.
---
That's a good point!  It's like they put special emphasis on making local an intel tool and are now saying they never wanted it to be an intel tool...
---
Rail atrons are interesting. I still like the null scram kiter for lowsec, but I can't deny the effectiveness of this version.
---
So how do I join it?
---
Do I just tick the 64 bit box in the preferences?
---
But mostly low sec is very very empty.
---
&gt; 2019-05-28
---
If they are bots, thanks for doing gods work o7. I don't care which bloc they are in.
---
習近平小熊維尼
---
Emperor and the smoothbrain, in theaters soon!
---
If that was true, you would be following the botting reports by CCP. I think this is a more personal issue. Would you be interested in being a guest on the Meta Show and declare your love/hatred for Mittani?
---
not sure why you dont think that with the heavyier isk losses.
---
 like, think about what your saying, read back. 
---
were doing ok.
---
the only way your doing ok is that you dont care about the isk loss in exchange for some useless ground.
---
meaning goons lost more than panfam in total, even now, which in my opinion would make it the goons who are beaten and bruised.
---
Lowsec space has meaning to me, despite currently being in Dreddit, because it's always been the home to great small gang and solo pvp. It bred legendary pirates and corps. Solo players flying reasonably cheap can be completely self sufficient (clone tags, mordus bps, fw lp) and get pvp WHILE they make isk. That's the big thing I love about lowsec: everything you do is pvp.
---
Nice video! I'll definitely try out Atrons now, just have to find a decent alpha fit haha
---
A love so forbidden, so scandalous, as to not be viewed by mere human eyes.
---
This is right to me too. I still jumpclone over once in a while to get some solo action that isn't going to pull a guaranteed 100 man blob or force me to try to arty kite RLML caracals in a fucking frigate hoping they have the wrong number of flight time rigs because it's the only fight I'm going to get. Throw in a C2 superhighway to get me anywhere I might need to be in eve, and that's why I've called Black Rise, Bleak Lands, Placid, and even Solitude homes in the past. :)
---
Botting is botting. The percentages shouldn't fucking matter. So GSF haf a lower percentage then the Northern dudes but that means jack shit. Could be they haven't been caught yet or are better at hiding. Instead of bitching and whining and calling each other names we should all work together to try and find a solution to the problem. 
---
But I guess that is too much to ask.
---
Olmeca4CSM !
---
Not everyone who disagrees with you is "drinking the goon koolaid" some people are capable of making their own opinions about how you come across
---
"all in cruiser hulls and down" you don't remember galmil very well do you, during the numbers days of Brave in Cal? They'd have 300-400 dudes for an ihub and we'd be like "okay, break out the slowcats" and away we go.
---
Citadels and the overall changes of that update did more damage to the game than anything I can remember in its history beyond POSSIBLY monoclegate.
---
Only 10? I'd take that.
---
&gt; Not everyone who disagrees with you is "drinking the goon koolaid" 
---
Yes but you are. Particularly when you are projecting opinions of your social bubble to everyone else.
---
The bait tanked pod condom with a scram always wins
---
This is why I both love and hate lowsec. These days even it's become very risk averse, and I can go on a 2 hour roam of black rise and only find an afk baiter so I try rifter vs talwar hoping he's slow on the reps. Was close at least.
---
Null needs to go back to being more like that. Remember 2014 Catch? That is what Null should be like. That's what Eve should be like.
---
&gt;It's the most obvious one, what is the good audio settings to have
---
Just turn off everything except "jump activation". It's the same in k-space imo.
---
&gt;How to proper use the scout toons ? Right now I'm 150km+ off the WH, looking at the WH while cloaked. 
---
Range doesn't really matter, you can sit at 20km and the chance that you'll be decloaked by chance is close to 0. I usually stay within 20km so I can jump the hole quickly if I need to.
---
Anyway, if you're running PVE sites you'll want to close the holes anyway, that way you won't have to worry about "intruders" too much.
---
Old Catch, the good days of Querious Fight Club, and wormhole space. Don't get me wrong, I love lowsec, but there are places where lowsec spirit leaks into the rest of the game, and I think the game needs more of that EVERYWHERE.
---
&gt; you would be following the botting reports by CCP
---
I am following them. I have wide discussions about how they don't mean much if you're interested.
---
https://twitter.com/GoldOlmeca/status/1126748306065899522

You folks just selectively focus on one piece of evidence that works best for you. All the Goon or ex-Goon capitals being teleported to hisec, [the botting corps](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/avofad/tnt_kicks_botting_corporation_thering_out_of/) we got kicked from Delve, 
---
I am the one on the field killing your bots. You are the one metagaming on reddit, irrationally cheering for your space cult no matter who's right. Even if you undock right now in 7UTB or C6Y pockets you'll see lots of VNI bots.
---
It's the only thing I can play, even now when it's doomed with all the neglect over the last 4-5-6 years or more.
---
It's true highlight of EVE play for me.
---
Mid-size corp where you can always get in group up with 4-5 drunken/stoned like minded pilots, get into cruisers, destroyers, battleships - cause some havoc, wreck shit, have a blast in a challenging fight, and get wrecked - feel that loss, meditate over it, get your shit up again.
---
Space for free-roaming people and fighter pilots. Independent entities not serving anyone but themselves or that small group they are flying with. 
---
Post-WWBee blue doughnut and everything that happened after VOLTRON has this thing ruined :(
---
It feels like EVE is nowadays missing out on drug dealing, smuggling, piracy, exploration/hunting/stick-up ops, and other kinds of small-scale cunning, dangerous criminal behavior.
---
I didn't tasted WH life, will have to do that before quitting EVE one day eventually - but still I feel and live my EVE life as lowsec solo pilot. Still....
---
Once upon a time I was flying with coolest people on earth.
---
I am forever in their debt for the good times, for the crazy times - probably why I am still loyal to this "low-sec-thing".
---
I tried null-sec big fights, it's just not cutting it, there's no adrenaline there for me.
---
Sadly that's what I see running small gang out of null right now. I'm here cos I have more friends currently playing in Dreddit than anywhere in lowsec. All my galmil bros joined Test, all my jspace bros either quit or are just too hardcore for my time to play right now.
---
Also hisec is hilarious. All pvp there is done through shenanigans and trickery and you have to respect that as any kind of pirate. It's not my place, but I believe we need to make hisec income great again and spread the carebears out.
---
Like im gonna stay neutral but can someone translate this garbage?
---
you can scan structures - had no idea!
---
I mean I already claim it's a race to the bottom for most alliances and their logic is "everyone else is doing it so we should too". But if you want to go that route you can't say "others are botting and we are not", which is why I referred to Mittens' tweet.
---
click goonswarm &gt; click active wars &gt; click war between Northern Coalition. and Goonswarm &gt; look at isk killed by both sides.
---
What are you doin to make dank isk in low? The usual deds/mordus/clones cleanup? Kill the odd blingy ded runner? I miss doin that.
---
re-rolling DCU seems like a pointless endeavour as only the hull stats change
---
Skill injectors and skill extractors were introduced to the game a few years back. These allow you to extract sp then inject it into a different toon and can be found on the market.
---
There are some drawbacks to it, but you can quickly inject sp these days to skill up faster. Your jf pilot should already have a lot of rorq skills, minimising the amount you need to train to get it up an running.
---
With this kind of industrial plan you have, you should have no issue finding a good indy null corp.
---
Check /r evejobs or the eve forums, avoid the default/in-game recruiting applications.
---
If you ask for the"sarashawa" overview in the in game help channel someone should be able to link it for you. If not I'll be home in a few hours and can pass it on.
---
It wasn't founded by XIX though PL did take the renterspace is some deal with death. I'm almost certain that deal did not include bot isk going to XIX, if anything death probably paid PL on top of harbouring their renteres.
---
After some time CCP Fozzie told us that in fact there was a random component that was sufficient to make it so that we couldn't figure out an exact cause. 
---
Mark 726 has never been the same...
---
I ~~run a small~~ ~~mafia~~ ~~cartel~~ n do stuff in New Joisey so if your near that area msg me in-game.  I'll only ~~try to rob~~ ~~shake you up~~ be really nice to you.  i promise.  srlsy
---
So in advanced audio settings you can tweak it to turn down specific noises and turn others up. Not at my client atm, but there's a slider you can turn up to make hole flashes louder. Also setting up inactive client muting so that you only hear hole flashes from a scout alt's client is super nice.
---
We literally don't. Have you seen the MER for the last year? We can lose 10x what the next big alliance does and barely feel it. Killboard stats are meaningless when the economy is so utterly buttfucked.
---
Sure, how many do you need. Going to need 70% payment up front
---
Oh perfect thanks! Ill be on later so will ask around for it. Maybe my corp has link.
---
Thank you.
---
Wut
---
Is wormhole space busier with traveling frigs and huffers these days? When I hunted C2 chains solo I rarely found anything.
---
&gt;I'd talk to CCP about if elected.
---
We need someone who's going to get things done for the game, not sperg out and cry in local when picked on.
---
Most eve related one I have seen on here in a while, so it may well be.
---
Ahahahahahahaha “corpse regurgitation from a spaceship” simulator 2019

---
A newbro will have a hard time taking down anything that looks like a hunting astero before burning down. Maybe the super bait triple rep heron could kill all an astero's drones before it goes down if the astero player's drone management is awful? I still wouldn't go for this.
---
Now, if you gank an exploration fit astero in a site, you'll probably be rewarded.
---
Solo ganking, or solo 1v1 in fac war? Ventures are annoying to kill because of inherent stabs, you'll need two scramblers. If you see em in lowsec, though, it's always fair to refit for dual scram and splat them. You'll want a microwarp.
---
Merlins are good faction war boats. Try a dual web armor merlin, though T2 guns for Null ammo is really necessary for that to fight other blaster brawlers. With meta guns and only navy antimatter, take fights with projectile/laser/missile boats, heat AB and go for 0. Mids should be scram/2 webs/1mn, low should have a small ancil repper.
---
I'm sure someone will give you a full fit for both of these jobs.
---
240 people losing 500 VNI's is only about 2 VNI's a person. Nothing that really screams bots.
---
I bet the idea of creating a new account as a solution to someone's problem to get back into the game after keeping the old account for years on end is off-putting, to say the least.
---
Am i though? i don't think Goons in their current form are good for the game, nor do i think the way TEST leadership is pushing the alliance is good for the game. I can however recognise the sheer brilliance of goons to get this far under your skin that you can't seem to go a single day without posting some half baked shitpost crying because goons are better at the game than you.
---
Lol
---
Just some fun advice...  Merlins are fine... Atrons too.  but  I'd spend the same ISK on the cheap dessie t1s &amp; slam MWD Nuetron Blaster (Blap) Catalysts and similar Arty-web Thrasher (Trashers) into everything you can find and enjoy.  You'll lose a bunch, but you'll get some kills that will probably drop more ISK in loot than you'll lose, sell it.  Rinse and repeat until satisfied.
---
It was sarcasm mate.
---
https://i.imgur.com/7j15tXU.jpg
---
how can we judge who is winning? who killed more ships? who can form more dudes? who kills more isk?
---
who fights the best, forgetting true outcome?
---
It may be awesome, but I feel like $300 on a mouse just to take pretty pictures of a game may be a little... frivolous.
---
whats the market system in Period Basis ? I see a nice market opportunity there
---
Who loses the most infrastructure is the main 'who wins' in a territory war IMO.

A wild member of Code appears! Bullies welcome! If you get fun out of being mean then that’s part of the sandbox :)

---
who's deciding this is a territory war?
---
why is that what matters?
---
if everyone has lots of isk, enough to last,
---
basicly what im getting in response feels like there is nothing to class as winning.
---
why is isk killed, meaning one side was better than the other side in space in the actual fights itself not all that matters?
---
surely this GAME of internet spaceships and pew pew matters only which side destroyed more stuff (the fun stuff not structures) xD
---
although structures can be used as a viable argument ie: we lost X but we killed the objective or citadel worth X amount.
---
Some people I know do X.
---
Does everybody do X??
---
Still offensively priced.
---
So that's all goons out...
---
oh sorry, I wasnt aware of this problem. I'm running the beta 64bit client and didnt notice that issue yet
---
Very satisfying, thanks
---
Bunch of bigoted crazies that probably have a bullseye on their heads in every state that isn't third world wacky land.
---
Go find people who don't suck. DREDDIT IS RECRUITING.
---
Sounds like a toxic normie hating community.
---
Loved to hear this dreaded. I remember that battle so well because it was so fun just hurling thousands of ships at our long time enemies. 
---
There was so few fc's on our side, it really took a toll on our guys leading. I know i was having waking dreams about playing eve that was around the end of the 2 week mark and was like yeah.... time to stop playing eve for a while.
---
I wouldnt say the battle has been forgotten, it is still remembered and celebrated in our militia.
---
I remember one time someone said "omg a girl say something sexy" in our comms. The resultant hazing of that guy lasted like three months. I'm sure her response was the closest thing to sex that guy'd ever gotten lol.
---
hai im baltrom. i used to run a small pirate roleplay alliance in lowsec.  
---
to me , lowsec is the place where you form a band of brothers and go out there to play eve for that one reason many of us got hooked to eve in the first place . interesting combat. its not about politics or goals , campaigns or evictions , for me it was allways ever only about that one fight , where you sit together the next day after and talk about how close it was .   
---
when we would spot a fleet we would sit down and discuss what ships to get into to present a fair and interesting fight for both parties and then try win that fight. it wasnt about the kills or higher goals but about the fight beeing enjoyable. if you have a long list of blues that count on your aid in protecting their assets or you have your own endless list of inspace assets you cant really do that because you have to win .  
---
to me , lowsec is the place that allows us to fight for the sake of fighting and enjoying the rush of it.  
---
idk , im not very good at english and/or formatting. sry ;)  
---
\#noblues
---
I suggest it after finding out if a noob corp is the way.  He hasn't really experienced the best parts of eve imho
---
Uhhh...Horde is about as far from SJWs as you get. Do you KNOW who their leadership is?
---
Wait what? You guys purged the gays three years ago and you're claiming...nice.
---
This is bait.
---
"Remember how there were no bots in Goonlands?"
---
nobody ever claimed that our renters were free from botters. but now you're reduced to a pathetic strawman to keep up the grrgoons.
---
I am as well and get this about 75% of the time. It'll make an instance for each client you started, since I don't multibox I only get one stuck launcher.
---
I only collect when system is empty.
---
There is no risk.
---
It's so easy to tell who's running bots on this sub now

I think you should put that through Google translate might come out better next time.
---
Unlikely. Sleepers also use specific missiles they don't even drop.
---
What? You think the only wormhole corps that use scouts are carebears? LOL. Everyone in jspace does PvE, often in their home hole, and wants to know when somebody's scouting them so they can form up for the fight instead of just eating shit in their miners and rattles lol.
---
English is an international language, Chinese isnt.
---
F
---
&gt;most of them will tell you "because there is no local".
---
You will definitely have to back that up with some numbers. 
---
There are many factors that makes moving into a wh a big step, no local is probably the least of peoples concerns. No asset safety, difficult logistics, other ways to make isk(from what you already know), you need scanner alts, preferably all the time, you never know where your exit is going to take you etc.
---
IGN same as youtube name ?
---
The amount of Disintegrators on 'Liminal' ships is a graphic bug. However, their description say they are fitted toward damage application.

Conclusive hard data from CCP doesn't mean much? Get the popcorn ready boiz. This is gonna be a good one.
---
What is Upwell?
---
People seem to forget how good neuts are in frig 1v1s.
---
Well, rats have been able to fit Missile launchers on hulls that normally don’t have any Launcher hard points, like the Sansha’s Nation Battlecruiser that is basically a Phantasm with way more turret and a HML strapped on it.
---
Can you please get Mittanni to send an autographed picture to Olmeca. I think he has one of those love/hate/infatuation things going on.
---
Hard data about what mate. The data is about who is permabanned. You are the one stretching it to "no bots in goonlands".
---
Check task manager and see if it's already running the background. 
---
Haven't had the issue with EVE specifically, but sounds familiar to other program issues. 
---
Could be wrong though.
---
Falcon gets tackled, everyone immediately warps away
---
space is scary when people can shoot back, isn't it
---
I get an all white Launcher now and then.
---
Just x out and reopen.
---
I see. I also dont multibox but didnt notice any problems with the luncher yet. I will keep an eye on it
---
I live in Low Sec currently and having a blast.  Get small fights and big fights.  Iron and Snuff bringing big fortizar fights.  I like low sec fights alot, usually never any supers showing up just people wanting to fightwith regular capitals and below.  Lots blowing up.  No bubbles, fun with Gate Guns, Sec Status.  Just alot of fun in general right now.
---
Germany is not like the UK, the minimum age to buy beer/wine/cider is 16, it’s only 18 for spirits.

I'll counter, 50% payment up front.
---
Good luck man. This game has a learning curve, you'll get there. Unfuck your overview, the default overview will get you killed. Z-S or Sarashawa's overview packs are a good starting point. Watch out for scams. Learn the game before you go jump into a big nullsec group (as many newbies like to do). You'll be happier that way. :)
---
Let me first stipulate the following as given, so I don't get straw manned to death:
---
1) Botters destroy MMO games
---
2) EVE has a bot problem
---
Now that is out of the way, I feel compelled to point out a few things after I've read some of the comments here.
---
First, the VNI (and to a lesser extent the Ishtar) is the most popular nullsec PVE ship.   There are many reasons for this, but it basically boils down to min/max-ing, that is, input vs output.  The point is that its widely used and jumping into a system and seeing multiple VNI on scan is not in itself an indication of botting activity.  Real humans rat in VNIs.  A lot.
---
Second, if you are a neutral or hostile entity to the owners of said system and all of these ratting ships dock up because you are in local, this also does not indicate botting activity because it's the exact behavior of real human players.
---
If we expect CCP to take our grievances about botting seriously they must not take on the flavor of a witch hunt. "OMG multiple VNI on scan BOTS!" is not helpful.  Even "knowing" (which is vastly different from "suspecting") that a player runs 10 accounts of ratting VNI is not evidence of anything except broken gameplay, which I hope to address in a series of posts soon.
---
Now, if said suspected botters are always online, in the same system, and that system shows a remarkably even level of NPC kills 23.5/7, NOW we might have some useful indications, and some righteous rage because such activity is stupid easy for CCP to catch with all the data available from their side.
---
Be smart. Be specific. Back up assertions with facts.
---
Yep that’s a spiffing picture for sure. I’m a bit of a screenshot junkie too
---
I agree, and some skins are barely touched and look more like someone opened the original skinfiles, selected brownish orange color and held the spraytool on the skin for a couple seconds.
---
I mean it's up to you what 'matters' to you in this game. But when someone says 'I'm going to invade and take your space away from you' I'd 100% say actually taking that space cou ts as a win for them. Maybe 'having fun and winning fights' cou ts as a win for you even if you lose the space. Whatever.
---
i dont think theyre 'taking the space'
---
knocking everything down. whatever, but at the end. i dont see goons expanding to tribute xD
---
i'll try it with an alpha as well but a bait probe can tank a non-dda astero  indefinitely while using ac and its own drones to defang it. 
---
The astero hunters are not all the sharpest of tools either and not maxed in skills etc. I would welcome a change, like an exploration ship fighting back tbh (and taking the opportunity to learn some micro) instead of waiting to just die in the cheapest possible fit (and simply learning about isk efficiency)
---
dont answer this, it will be used to social engineer you and steal your eve account

Pretty sure Fozzie was just trolling people.
---
&gt;The Greater Western Co-Prosperity sphere is a rental organisation whose members have largely been poached from NC.'s renter alliance.
---
How about you go on dotlan yourself and check out the alliance histories of the corps in Greater Western Co-Prosperity Sphere? It's really not that hard, unless you want to claim that dotlan is panfam aligned or some shit.
---
Because warping to Top Belt and look at your opponent in the eyes is the real Eve's end game.
---
the fun part is that panfam have been winning majority of fights taken, outnumbered 2:1 or worse 3:1
---
theres bad pilot in all alliances. i can assure you NC. and PL has thiers,
---
but the lowest skills pilots in PL and NC. would proberly pass and mid tier pilots in goons and test
---
Yep basically all what you stated, but it is always about how much work need to be put in living in WH space.       
---
But for most of the people that i ever spoken with about it - the lack of local was almost always the first thing they stated.
---
Tomorrow there will be too many Ospreys for sale at 1 isk
---
But why ?     
---
So much crabbing for having just sec stat boost?       
---
Sec stat is like zkill stats- no one cares about it much.
---
Oh ffs not you again. 
---
Make/Model/Color of the vehicle you were driving - I was clinging to your trailer.
---
What highway we were on originally - I’d never met you before how the hell should I know. 
---
What was on the back of my vehicle that you asked about - My wife’s dead body. What the fuck man, you got her the first time did you have to reverse ?
---
What direction were we heading on Route 93 - Forwards, I couldn’t keep track with all the blood in my eyes. 
---
What EVE-related sticker did I have on my vehicle - "Something something autothysian lancer something"
---
Were you the passenger or the driver - I was one of the pedestrians you hit, why are you playing the innocent ?
---
That's entrapment!
---
General advice about video-editing and effects:  
---
Less is usually better. Just have one consistent intro so people can recognize "oh that is a video from this guy" and then keep the editing to a minimum - if you don't want to stylize it real hard and the editing is a key factor of the video of course. 
---
Also just show the fit for a few seconds, not a whole video. People can just pause it and then have a full-resolution fight afterwards.
---
Is it me or has your EVE no sound? The "boing" when you get a killmail is still a nice touch and easy to add. ;) 
---
Want music? Enable it in the client. 
---
Cheers o7
---
Goddamnit im supposed to hate goons. Stop making it harder.
---

True

Of of the devs mentioned a week or two ago that they were completely redoing the advert mechanism, which is why weve been seeing that stupid glasses ad on a loop for the last three months.
---
However, if the ad really *really* bothers you, there is a way to disable it on a session by session basis.
---
1) Open your graphics option menu
---
2) Set shader mode to low. This temporarily turns off the scope adverts as they are only loaded into the game on medium or high shader settings.  However if you were to go back to a higher shader setting at this point, you will find the ADs re-enabled as they are still loaded into memory when the client started.
---
3) While in the low shader mode, close your client and log back in.  When the client loads in low shader mode, it does not load the scope advertisements into memory.  Now you can set your client shader back to high and all you will see on the screens is a static "Scope" logo.
---
the lag must have wreaked the server
---
Sometimes pressing f5 refreshes apps like this, I'd have to test on the eve launcher to make sure, but it might fix this without quitting it.
---
If you send me one I'll double it for you.
---
Hey did you worry about the plus one when you guys would go around dropping 50 supers on a minning barge?
---
&gt; I'm not saying Goons are botters 
---
I will, fuck em. 
---
&gt; and the Northern renters are innocent
---
lmao not those botting fucks. 
---
   
---
SPOILER --- all big alliances have and support their own botters.
---
Why care about -10. Its literally the same thing.
---
Out of curiosity, would you mind giving me your Loki fit?
---
We're not taking it sure, but taking it from Panfam - absolutely. If we install someone new or just leave it so they can move back in when we're done remains to be seen I guess, but I also doubt we'll keep it ourselves.
---
well. goons will get there. eventually.
---
but where are the days where being a good pilot meant somthing to yourselfs. rather than, i joined the winning side, therfore i am better. lol
---
winning fights, making judgements to follow the better FC's. 
---
goon even with thier supremem numbers and income. still cant say theyre not asking for help from non goons.
---
whereas panfam are one entity, weather people say it is or it isnt, they are one.
---
Just to clarify you do mean 7PM eve time on the server right?
---
The only reason I ask this is because for your dread event you said 7PM GMT but undocked at like 6PM server time (7PM UK time).
---
UK doesn't observe GMT currently as it's BST
---
50 v 80 with you guys having another fleet on standby ready to go.
---
We saw what you had and decided we didnt want to play. 
---
Doesnt help our caps didnt bring their HAW refits.
---
&gt;wanting to have a chance to fight instead of just getting ganked in their expensive pve ships
---
So carebear, such risk aversion, wow!
---
Capacitors and Batteries don't recharge at a linear rate my dude.  As they decrease in stored charge they replenish faster.  
---
You ever notice it takes no time to charge your phone to 20%, but forever to go from 95-100%
---
tenants should be fined -100kkk in the wallet, because they allow bot
---
We love you m8 o7
---
I’ll counter 49.9% payment up front.
---
Wait, what's this bait probe fit that can tank indefinitely?
---
It has to perform worse than existing free software though, just so we know CCP was involved in the development.
---
what did we have on standby that needed you to have HAW refits?
---
Actually I would wager hisec is worse than null.  It's easier to hide.
---
I'll counter, 49.8% payment up front.
---
Oh no, you might have to wait five whole minutes while we figure out what you've got and give you a good fight
---
lmao DAE hate JavaScript xD
---
I’ll counter, 49.79% payment up front.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/76346882/ 
---
maybe t2 guns too. It s great for baiting asteros but I think it can also kill some of the not fully skilled ones, that are not careful with their drones, dont have both frig skills to 5, poor drone skills etc. 
---
It's going to take until they run out of cap, though, i think :)
---
I'll counter, 49.789% payment out back.

Your response makes me think you belong here lol. Welcome to Eve. I'm sorry but you can never leave now, it's stuck in your head.

Legit only osprey doubling service I use
---
Whoever runs out of cap first loses, yeah. Okay, so my standard fit would be fine since I run neuts, platings, no DDAs. I was curious what the heck you were up to, I like this. I'm guessing this kills bombers pretty good too, though rocket bombers would probably blap you.
---
What skills does this need for cap stable reps? This doesn't look cap stable on newbro skills. You put very little damage pressure on the astero itself, so I don't exactly see myself at risk of capping out before you.
---
Uh huh. OK dude, I guess you win the culture war or something. Grats.
---
This.
---
and i guess your taking the high horse out.
---
off ya trot :D
---
IT IS a waste of time. Just don't waste all your time on it, try to diversify or wasting of time.
---
Riding this baby all the way to front page
---
were you smugposting when we lost the sh1 fight?  As soon as we stood our supers and titans down then nc/pl logged theirs in to finish off the Baltec fleet.  So you either fight outnumbered with no advantages or you dont pick one.
---
Can confirm, queerswarm is one of the most active and accepting social SIGs in goons. Lots of friendly people, that are even accepting plain old white cis males like me.
---
This seems counterfeit and cis-phobic. I am offended.
---
10/10 content, beats the shit out of the recent gons vs ncpl slapfight threads  
---
Somebody get this man his goddamn ospreys
---
we were already logged in, and scouted by goons, and our smaller cap fleet didnt want to be first in, nono no it didnt. however the double size goon one if they had the balls they say they have, and the 'we dont car about what isk loss we get goons are saying' shouldve just gone in with the supers.
---
it was a who goes first thing, goons bailed. so we meme dropped cos there was no reason not to lol.
---
Doing good! Yourself?
---
Tbh if you don’t know how to fit it yourself you probably shouldn’t be flying a T3C for pvp.
---
Can't afford a printscreen either? :(
---
Is this really something to bitch about?
---
Considering the closing wormholes, do you have a go-to fit to do this easily ? I've read a bit about it but it takes specific rolling battleship and HIC to finish the collapsing. There are a "first-time, budget, skill friendly" ships that we can use to roll WH ?
---
Everything I know considering rolling WH come from this site :  [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Wormhole\_Campus\_Static\_Rolling\_Guide](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Wormhole_Campus_Static_Rolling_Guide) so can I lean on this ?
---
dont forget to strap in, safety first and all
---
yea really low cap skills can be a problem. reasonable skills though it permatanks 100 something dps an astero puts out. Which is already a good advantage vs a dual rep cap boosted astero. 
---
If you use a neut on your astero i guess you dont solo hunt in whs which puts you out of the target group, hehe. 
---
Bombers just melt, even rocket ones if your reactive picks up (overheat it at start). 
---
I think at the very least you can have him run away if you "accidentally' lose tackle since most solo hunters will suspect bait and will try to disengage. 
---
Magnate can do even better and safer, issue being it cant reliably fake running sites too.
---
Fuck i laughed so hard at that I woke everyone up and now they’re mad at me
---
Sure I'll find one in a data core one day :D
---
Nope, I grew up in Provi in the 18xa ring, was in MENTL, the only reason I'm in RZR now is that when I stopped playing a lot of people I played with moved over there. RZR and CVA are on pretty decent terms, a month ago we even fought together against the purple helmets.
---
So no, I really like provibros, I just call out BS when I see it.

---
It takes literally 1 minute to DScan a new system and find if anyones in it. 
---
No Local isnt the reason people dont join Whs, its the fuckign logistics. 
---
Now, i dont think removing local is the right idea but at least be right about why.
---
I read this title as "girls are scary" ...
---
Indeed, lets not ever try to learn something new or ask questions about anything we don't know.  That's how we progress.
---
Very cringe
---
ok then dont be a bitch and complain about blobbing.  Man up and get over it, take your wins and accept your losses.
---
I do solo hunt in whs sometimes. I often refit to take my target. Scan down all the sites in the system, unfit your probes in the depot, then wait. Mobile depots are amazing things.
---
Huh. These are pretty neat. I like this fit, I may have to take these out to look for trouble in jspace. In kspace I think more explorers at this point die to sabres with or without probes than anything else.
---
The Caldari State told me I would have released sensible information to the Gallente Federation if I did so :D

Since you're posting this onto reddit, I'm sure 50m is a lot to you. Good job! No, really. It's a decent income when you're just starting out. Not really when you're looking to get into a soup or tit, but that'll come with time..
---
BUT FOR THE LOVE OF GOD USE PRINTSCREEN! It's 2019 i can't believe people still take screenshots of their monitors with their phones
---
For small/solo there are no standard fits, the fleet standard is with Heavy-Beam-Lasers, AB propped with 1 variable ECM-Mid and Lowslots bricktanked with passive Deadspace Membranes and Faction 1600mm plates (usually in Slave-Clones when not in bubbly land)
---
whos complaining about blobbing.
---
my complaints are goons gotta big mouth for a group as weak as they are, who hypocritically do everything they get mouthy about lol.
---
blob as much as you have been doing, weve been winning fights. its been fun for all. but dont blob then say, thing like, goons are finding it easy to take out panfam out of tribute and the like.

because it hasnt been, and it hasnt been only goons

---
Jesus christ the fov on that thing
---
What??
---
Good fight and good music. Have my upvote!
---
no you cant. And since yxou dont have a clue about 0.0 space and probably havn't heared yet you cant defend a Keepstar with Supers vs other Supers.
---
I takes 6 Titans to shoot at sayed structure to kill it or keep it paused. So means when we just calculate even and serious numbers as example. Lets say we and goons have 300 Titans both and 250 Supers both and one Subcapfleet both. The keepstar still wouldnt have a chance to stay alive. Cause you never break up 300 Titans in Time the structure dies. We once where able to save a keepstar vs. Goons and friends. Was a PH keepstar and we where just lucky that goons just used 1000 Carriers or maybe some more i dunno. It was a 6h fight with constant killing Fighters and burstjam stuff to get the time window closed. But you cant kill enough titans in that time. Keepstar will 100% Die.
---
When Goons want to kill Keepstars and have Superaccess to the system it is DEAD. Only chance we have is try to keep supers out and fight under heavy tactical advantadge. When the door is open once we dont need to undock anymore since we dont save a structure no matter what we do. So basicly we lose the strategic objective for sure and can only chosse what else we wanna do.
---
And no Alliance is going to waste all their Supers just for lol's
---
0% payment up front. How many do you need. I'll list them at 40% over Jita.
---
They are botting, most likely, Yes.
---
Howerver, NC. renters pay monthly and consistently where as PB renters only need to make a one-time payment. Hope the PB botters get purged soon, otherwise have at it.
---
It's a double-edged sword in the aspect of who it really gives the advantage, e.g. the alliance that profits from it.
---
Guess the plethora of options is my issue here. I'm a fan of hit and run. High pace. I like the cloaky style as well.

he teleported a titan banned for ‘previous eula violations’ and said it was botting in an attempt to role play as batman. you can’t trust him to be able to make an actual chart that displays anything meaningful

Honeybadger coalition never did that to you. In fact, you invaded what was left of the Honeybadger coalition after they had their internal struggles post taking all of the south.
---
Wait, you mean to tell us that a Russian player is cheating in EVE Online to get ahead in some way? Hold on, let me go grab a cup of coffee so we can talk about how surprising this is. 
---
I don’t care that much about killboards, but doing this kind of shit is super lame. In any leaderboard, there’s going to be a ton of cheating though. Like, most of the guys at the top of the PUBG Xbox leaderboard use that packet sniffing RADAR program, M&amp;K adapters, or scripts - or some combination of all of them. 
---
Gaming just isn’t honest anymore :c

Kill was at 18:40 server time which equates to 18:40 GMT v0v
---
I just wanted to make sure the time is right so people don't miss out
---
Was not in it three years ago, I can only speak about the here and now.
---
I really like the quality of posting recently.
---
Boo comma decimal separator. Booooo.
---
He just confrimed what he sayed yesterday evening in TIS just for your information. Not saying he didnt say otherwise but i dont think so since he is pretty aware of the fight's.. he may stated we will not lose but this means to understand what losing is. For killah loosing is in the courent Situation he gets his fleet destroyed. Your goal on the other side is not kill a NC. Fleet it is basicly burn their stuff... 
---
So there will never be a Situation where we both say one lost one won. Except the SH1 Fight some days ago. And even then yesterday someone from Bastion kind a negliated that. He stated after you realised you cant save the timer anymore you jump in anyways and its for the GF's.

Got bored in lowsec the other day. Spent like an hour taking screen shots in front of suns.

For fast paced hit and run seriously get a Loki. Armor ships are bad for that kind of play...
---
I'm done with eve. Take all my ospreys in this 1 million isk contract. (Its actually 1 billion)
---
yeah but this was just a memething. The fight was there already over. I was able to Shoot on three Targets in my avatar cause this was all what was left when we landed. Fair Point Super where in maybe 2 mins earlier so they had maybe a better chance to get frags. But still where you fleets already trying to gtfo.
---
Did you guys fuck?
---
“Anchor up FOR THE ALLIANCE” was the funniest thing I heard all night
---
Yes
---
He asked what the difference was between the two and how we weren't "touching the dirty isk". I gave the answer as to the differences. If you watched the rest of that meta show, the general consensus was that renters are going to bot, and that renting should be removed from the game if people are so anti-botting like they claim.

I’m sure that’s exactly what’s happening
---
You can't remove renting, thats like removing coalitions, it isn't a game mechanic. 
---
No one cares about the consensus on the meta show lmao, its a bunch of retards trying to spread their narrative.
---
Added contact with excellent standing so I'm gonna say... yes
---
TOGETHER OUR VALUES MAKE US DIFFERENT
---
Making fits and flying them well are two separate skill sets.  They often overlap, but they don't have to.
---
while i appreciate you post it depends on which type of goons you have to fight there. Like you dont know how often we got mopped up but gangs from MisterVee when he still was active. Or a lot of other's.   
---
I can remember a fleet where we wanted to kill a POS some years ago. we had our 50 man subcvapfleet some logis and 15 dreads and some carriers tackle and worthless other crap. Vee bridged in with 30 - 40 Taloses with some logi and tackle. 
---
We didnt where able to Kill a single ship and lost basicly all dreads and more stuff. so basicly they where outnumbered and outgunned but raped us. So maybe our FC made some mistakes or what else but saying goons in even numbers are crap is at least depending...
---
Come join us at in-game Channel “ChemK Pub”. We have fun.
---
he’s saying if u don’t understand how to fit a ship (you clearly don’t) then you have no business flying it. 
---
practice making a not shit fit for a Merlin or something
---
Didn't say its ok to bot. However if you think someone is botting, report them to CCP.
---
Also, did you even see the the piechart of shame?
---
If they'd just killed the warewolf in book 1 and ended it there, it would have been pretty good. That whiny bitch is what ruined the story.
---
says who? ... 
---
There are 6 official languages for the United Nations (including Mandarin) ... other than that, the only thing making English international is the internet ... starting out in the English speaking USA, based in the English speaking Silicon Valley, expanded by English speaking companies having English speaking customers ... establishing a foothold before anyone else got to build any relevant presence.
---
So what we're talking here is nothing other than keeping English because of convenience ... it's convenient for mostly Americans who had become the main presence on the internet in the west. It wouldn't make sense using some other language in the west because companies, including game companies, would start losing money ... so instead, if everyone else wants to participate on the internet in the west they have to learn English ... 
---
Anyway, I just had to comment about the:
---
&gt; Otherwise there will be bunch of people running around in Slavic, French, Portuguese letters in their name 
---
As if this would be a bad thing ...
---
He's not shitting on you. You *are* going to feed if we just give you a fit and general advice on how to use it and that's all. The trial and error way is great with many cheap ships. A T3C is *not* what you want to fly that way.
---
If you collapse a non static wormhole it should not reappear in your system
---
What is the ratio?
---
This explains pretty much everything that's happened to the game in the last few years.

Is it not the same way in 0.0? Hostiles/neutrals show up in your space trying to shoot your rorquals you just let them stay?
---
There was a massive DDOS attack that hit a lot of internet service providers yesterday. (The ISP I work for in Canada was also hit; I was playing EVE at the time as well, luckily had just docked up to go make supper.)
---
Now kiss.
---
If you don't already have enough experience to know what will work fit-wise, you will just feed SP when you inevitably die the first time you undock it.
---
Was posted in our corp slack, wihthout looking thought I'd whore on some karma. I was wrong :D
---
Hope I didn't come off as not understanding what he was trying to tell me. I very much taste the salt and bitterness. And I also hope you understood the underlining sarcasm in my reply. 
---
Why the hell would I ever want to practice fitting a Merlin? I understand how to fit this ship. However, I've never flown it before. Hence asking for advice. Since you are all so experienced and elite that you can fit ships out of thin air the first time you're flying something new without asking for advice, I was hoping to tap into some of that knowledge. That was apparently a mistake.
---
Fucking Merlins...lol

go back to first grade and learn to read idiot

Addressing in reverse order:
---
If it's a static, the new one appears in exactly 1 minute. If it's not a static, nothing new will appear in your system.
---
That guide looks fine. Every corp uses slightly different terminology, so keep that in mind when drawing from multiple sources. Also note that the eveuni guide you linked has some information that appears to be specific to their statics (2kkg size). You'll need to modify the procedure slightly if your statics are different.
---
A first time budget and skill friendly roller is a battleship with a probe launcher and prototype cloak in the highs (and probes!), dual or ideally triple prop in the mids (100mn, 500mn, micro jump), a higgs rig, and lows full of some combination of istabs, dcus, bulkheads, and the module that makes you go faster (not nanofibers--the other one. Sorry I'm forgetting its name!) Any battleship will do, in theory. To make your life easier, you want one whose "hot" (prop on) mass is close to but not over 300kg. Common choices include the Megathron, Tempest, and Raven. Praxis might work, but I don't think I've seen one of those, so I'm guessing it's either less agile or has awkward mass. A budget/skill friendly version of a HIC is an overprop'd cruiser or Sigil, which you put minimal fittings on and plan to self-destruct when you inevitably roll yourself out using it.
---
goons had double the subs/caps as panfam. i'm saying it was the right thing to not jump in panfam supers until after it was a decided win for panfam. jumping in pre-maturely and losing subcap superiority would have resulted in a lot of dead panfam supers.
---
Leave the strong independent PanFam pet alone!

---
Read subsystem bonuses and use ur fuckin brain if you know how to fit ships then lmfao
---
Thanks, I was basing income numbers off of what I was told years ago. I did my research and At 100m isk/hr and 8bill per rorqual it would basically be nowhere near what I thought it would be.
---
Idk. I like the game but I can never find the drive to play a game if it becomes a job. Guess I'll skip it again.
---
Best donut is a CFC one.
---
But by this logic I would never be able to undock any new ship? Or I'll end up undocking and possibly making an obvious mistake, that has been made a 100 times before, while trying to fit it myself. It is a complex ship. How did you ever learn to fly a t3c? The point in asking is to reduce the chance of feeding, even tho I have budgeted enough billions loose a few in this endeavour...
---
To give some context. I've played this game since 2009. It's not like I don't understand where you guys are coming from here.
---
Thanks for all the info.
---
I did a bit of reading and it seems instead of hulks, nowadays people mine in rorquals for about 100m isk/hr. That's way less money than time I can reliably devote to an eve job.
---
Back to the drawing board I guess.
---
I’m NC.  This is pretty good shitposting.
---
Proof that the whole SKIN idea was cool.
---
We need some shots of the point where the Leshaks started shooting that Vendetta.
---
basically there is one viable fit simulating an Omen Navy Issue with 100MN AB i know of
---
Still accurate.
---
Here we see the fundamental stupidity of the damage cap/repair timer system.  The defender cannot influence the structure, they can only play the world's worst tower defense game.  Imagine if keeps at least could receive reps.  It would kill the stupid 300km meta of just barely staying in range of the edge of the giant keep model if I could put a wad of FAXes on the far side that you can't touch from 300km off the far side.

10/10 haiku well done
---
You're thinking of the Money Badger Coalition, which was many of the same groups, hence the name take-off, but in very different circumstances and at a different time.
---
Sweet Jesus this thread is awesome haha
---
Meh the real alliance members are in deployment. Have these sloppy seconds.
---
&gt; But by this logic I would never be able to undock any new ship ?
---
&gt;  The trial and error way is great with many cheap ships.
---
I very much doubt you've undocked with every T1 subcap.
---
&gt; How did you ever learn to fly a t3c?
---
I never did, it's just the obvious answer. I've never flawn cloaky solo and the thing is, since you loose SP and generally some isky flying cloaky solo T3C, I would rather advise you to go for a cloaky recon ship and get the hang of flying cloaky cruisers, maybe weaker than a T3C but with less options in fitting (thus less mistakes), and get an idea of what you need to catch targets, what can counter you, what you can engage etc.
---
If you want to fly a loki sure go ahead. But crashing down burning is often more frustrating than fun, even trying to learn.
---
100mn RLML + 2 bling neuts and 100mn beams are the better small gang fits. There are also some 50mn RLML + bling neut fits, which are still great.
---
People use those ships becuase the math on them cold and hot is nice. 200 and 300. Learn the hole number limits, most are either 2b for lowclass wormholes or 3b for a low to highclass. These all vary though. Hics are nice because they can make themselves very small and then very big. But they are exspensive and take the skills to fly a hic. Sigils are nice because they are cheap! And can be used very easily. They are small to begin with, then can make themselves very large. Alternatly, if you jump out on what shouldbe your last pass, and it's not critical, do a pass with a battlecruiser before bringing the battle ship back thru
---
“let me leech money pls”
---
yes
---
You also can’t remote trash things in wormhole citadels, iirc
---
yeah, same thing happened here [https://zkillboard.com/related/30001160/201905290100/](https://zkillboard.com/related/30001160/201905290100/) minus all the terrible piloting. falcon enters structure, everyone started to run from the single frig xD
---
Oh, this again lol
---
Not sure how participating in a public fleet is leeching, but whatever.
---
an update and a thank you for the replies.
---
after downtime it now works
---
thank you all
---
How cap hungry are the beams?  I see a lot of the fits on zkill beeing missile based, I would guess it's because cap is life?
---
Is it possible to remove these kills? pretty retarded
---
Jump activation max
---
Eve doesn’t have any other sounds worth hearing, except maybe Dscan so you don’t feel so alone
---
https://getsharex.com/

B E A utiful
---
You mentioned hit and run, you go to Neut sub, HAMS, cloak, scram, brick tank. Although TBH the loki does that better and gets nice long webs too
---
And for those of us perpetually "at war"?
---
Imagine being this retarded.
---
Did the conversation go like this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn3YjQSvDzA
---
Atfer 6 month of carrier ratying , me too i will never undock a carrier for pve..
---
Nothing keeping you there but yourself. If you don’t like it leave. Good luck finding a better home, makes eve way better
---
This but unironically.
---
It's the war of attrition in the gated plexes I always enjoyed the most. I was in galmil for some super fun fights under Jules and Wolfs tho.  I do remember Brave when they staged in Isho, Bengal Bob set up in Aki because he thought it shameful that they set up in high sec.  I think him and his instalock Svipul gave them ptsd.
---
&gt; I very much doubt you've undocked with every T1 subcap. 
---
Actually went to the ship tree and started to count :)
---
Never flown: Scorpion, Corax, Exequror, Talwar and Bellicose
---
I get where you're coming from there. Don't get me wrong. But I wanted to give the Legion a go today. I have flown cloaky many hours of my EVE-life. It's not like I'm a fresh Omega clone injecting to buy a Black ops BS so I can move around high sec faster. Just wanted to see if anyone could offer some advice. And some have.
---
Why did you just Dm the guy? Or read his forum post?
---
I ONLY PLAY EVE FOR 5 HOURS A DAY AFTER MY HOMEWORK IS DONE MOM
---
Yeah, but for that purpose you may as well use the Nomen.
---
Why stop at fax? Make it your goal to get a blue everything
---
There are definitely corps that welcome social justice activists.  That said, this is a game, and just about no one seriously thinks social justice should be the, or even a, focus of their time playing it.
---
been going on for a while, so probably not a mistake.  courier bots maybe?
---
Three months actually seems about right for something simultaneously that irritating and that stupid.
---
Yea, now compare the numbers on both sides at that time and now. Goons had shitty fleet numbers but were not that badly outnumbered.
---
It was much less funny. We chatted about how our days had gone, where each of the holes we came through led, and how good the loot had been so far.
---
Just a good ol' friendly sharing of intel between strangers via d-scan
---
mite be meta, but looks shit next to the legion for the 0.1% that use ships for how they look lol HAM Legion ftw
---
im so proud my coalition is shooting structures and doing entosis shit.
---
i waited and krabbed 1 year for this....
---
Not.
---
You must construct additional pylons
---
Im so glad i dont have enough experience with the new sov mechanics to understand what any of this means.
---
Post was edited on both sites EVE and Reddit before event, announcement was given out up to 48 hours before the event both in local, on stream and in message, once I realised my mistake sorry.
---
On paper the numbers were pretty even but we had a LOT of non active u purged players. In reality it was nothing like an even fight.
---
Sooo duh loki is better.. But if you must fly a legion use missiles.. Dear god use missiles the lazer version has no drones there for no reliable way of dealing with small ships. For some fucking reason.. Thanks again CCP... 
---
That being said you should have an idea what to fit if your flying a ship of that caliber.. But there is a lot of options so flavor it.. Do you like buffer? Do you want super reps? There are only so many ways to fit a ship.. 
---
Short list of what you would want tho
---
100mn ab.. Missiles and tank.  Type of tank is up to you but it has to be armor.. Its a legion duh. Neuts and nos is a good choice but unless your solo I find a whole rack to be appropriate lol. But thats also a goto wh comp.
---
Anyways not trying to be rude but you should have some idea before you fly it. And if you dont.. Maybe you should learn fittings first.. What stuff does so you know how to do it. This knowledge helps you in combat also as you can way more accurately "guess" as to your opponents fit. 
---
Fly safe
---
"Hey while theyre killing stuff, ima go salvage.  Im sure they wont mind." - 75% of the people in publig trig fleets

I literally know nothing about trig fleets. I was hoping they'd be like incursions and have high end sites that make good money clearing with a fleet.
---
Not sure why, but the Legion is the best looking ship in the game for me.
---
Its PPS not PSPS you scrub.
---
:)
---
you mad lad you!
---
Kinda, it has the advantage of being hard to tackle. Much tankier as well.
---
People also know exactly what to expect from a Nomen.
---
Triglav defense is doing it. Didn't have the time to check if it was good yet but I don't know any other
---
Yep there is no denying that the scram kite fit is very solid. Personally I lose more blaster fit atrons than rails but maybe that says more about my skill as a pilot than the fit haha!
---
Thanks you for your reply. I guess i come off as a complete noob in my post here. My bad. What you mention here is some off the stuff I was after. I was in doubt about the lasers, this adds more to that.
---
Thank you for being the only useful person here. Lol
---
Yeah, I personally miss the golden era in Minmatarr/Amarr that occurred right after the last major FW rebalance and the ship tiericide that followed shortly after (6-7 years ago?).  There was a period where there were 30-50 v 30-50 fights in medium plexes in Huola and environs almost every week.  Maller and Naug gangs vs. SFI and VNI gangs, with both sides having about equal tank/dps, sometimes the fights would last an hour thanks to heavy tanks and reshipping, despite the tiny numbers.
---
you will make more if you put up sell orders instead of selling to buy orders
---
Thanks for the compliment I guess ^^
---
IMHO, the sole purpose of phase 1 of the expansion is to release the new ships and seed the market for trig  components
---
You gave pretty much the exact answer i was looming for, so thank you.
---
Oh god the lazers are terrible and honestly in my opinion destroy the hulls usefulness. Its an amarr boat with lazers but no drones.. Like who thought that was a good idea.. And whats worse is the FUCKING MISSILES GET THEM... like 100% backwards.. 
---
I love the legion.. But ccp made it usless unless its a neut boat.. Just use a loki.. :( makes me sad.. And angry.   Lol
---
what ship was that at the beginning?
---
It was pretty funny, she found the result pretty funny too. Turns out when you're not a room full of creepy shitters, girls don't mind attention. They also don't mind people flailing around impotently at them, because when they feel safe it's really just funny.
---
Now this is the real gold.
---
Oh yeah I remember the start of it when Brave thought they could stage out of hisec with basically two gates to play around.
---
Those gates were 23/7 hellcamped for months
---
Dunno. Whatever fit works for you. Do you ever try to crash plexes against things in rail atrons?
---
3.50
---
Does this happen on mac?
---
The best bit about it was the build up to it.  Your Arzad victory, the Minmil civil war, the negative view the rest of minmil had towards the guys in Huola meant there was a lot an animosity.  
---
Then you guys announce on the forums in advance that you were taking our home, we were pretty riled up and ready for the fight.  It had loads of drama, was a good story!
---
No, killmails are never deleted from zkillboard. The killmails exist in game, are available via api, and regardless of the method of obtaining the killmails they should still be reported.
---
How would you like it if I started deleting your killmails because someone else didn't like how you obtained them? It just wouldn't work. 
---
*API verified killmails will not be deleted from zkillboard.*
---
As someone who was in I.Law at the time and served as a minor Amarr FC in the Burn Huola campaign, I can say that I have just as fond memories of it as you do.
---
Seriously, I think the six months on either side of that event were the best time I ever spent in EVE.
---
I'd have bought 5 of them, but skins I'll rarely see just aren't worth $10+   
---
I guess people mine enough plex not to care.
---
Is this what happens when IT workers go senile?
---
how do you know he just didnt bomb a structure that dropped a bunch of ships?
---
One of those fart dragon's bots
---
same lol l know theres better but l just wish it had the rest of the amarr skins
---
We set up a POS in Aki for reships and sat in there for a year, was great!
---
I like fast money thou :D
---
ooh 1 million!!! ACCEPT!!!
---
Sorry, my bad, I lost my intelligence and memory implants during the last pod kill and so I didn't think neither remember about that. But now, with some ISK in my pocket, I may buy some more XD

Good shit. Glad you’re still blogging about wormhole space TBH.

But you’ll go mad if you do all the hauling.
---
Thanks for the reply.
---
All very good points and something for me to think about this week. 
---
In regards to the music I am in two minds as how to approach it. I do not use in game music and I am usually zoomed out from the action to capture any of the ongoing sound effects. I do agree though that it needs something. Not sure whether to add commentary rather than captions to break the silence or perhaps just a simple sound track with some fun little sounds added in. 
---
Hopefully I will find a happy medium as the videos evolve.
---
L1 couriers?  Yacht is limited to 30m3 space.   I don't see any cargo on any of the KM's
---
in the Huola fight I remember the Amarrs letting their reships bump out of their POS, had free Coercers for daaaayz
---
Bring 30 and shoot a fortizar in the north. No one shows up.
---
hmm. don't know then.  i don't do couriers so i have no idea how they work or how they are botted.  
---
but for it to be a mistake, you'd have to buy all the yahcts and fit them out and then acidentally send them on their way?  and then repeat it over and over and over again over several weeks?  
---
there has to be a purpose, but i can't figure it out.
---
**Don't join any public fleets**

Most people in them are just warping around and ninja looting/salvaging

---
just be careful, no idea if the guy that runs it has got his shit straight but the other day a bunch of awoxers were using their discord server to lure people in to low sec and kill them. (the incursion spawned within range of low sec, so you had low sec systems affected by the incursion)
---
all the money comes from salvage.
---
That's kinda lame.
---
Beams and missiles are just different fits. The cap is very cosy on both.
---
It’s important when im logging in my krab naglfar and have to wait 10 seconds to cloak.
---
Yeah please bring a plated legion into nullsec and die to the first vni with a scram.
---
Yeah it's probably my blinkered view from being on one side of the fence quite firmly.  I guess we speculated that was the case because reships stopping coming from the 5/6 POS Amarr had anchored in the system.
---
lmao what if every expansion that has come out has just been last minute ideas since no one was able to solve the puzzle. Imagine if it adds a warp gate to jove space after all this time.
---
Fitting tool now predicts the lifespan of our shit fits and takes that into account. If cap life is enough to last until death, it's considered stable.
---
Signal Cartel will be there. We will blot out the sun! (With snowballs)
---
I know, I love the stories in eve. And yeah the build up to it was the greatest. The minmatar civil war, we got half of the minmatar to join amarr then help us 'attack huola' it was perfect. 
---
It was our last large campaign, we all knew it was the last, everybody from our side emptied our wallets for thousands of coercers and punishers. Most of the old amarr guard went in knowing that win or loose this would break the old minmatar through sheer exhaustion of constant pvp then no pvp to be found anywhere else (seemingly). Eve is great the stories are awesome

Dave is this you or you gave somebody your reddit account?  You were gonna be a priest  ( back when we may have met if this is you on 2012 or so)
---
Yeah :( 
---
It is the last space in eve for legacy pvp I think :/ I went to null sec in a garmur the other night, FRT dropped a Nyx on me.
---
So here's what's happening:
---
* Ektallion was proud of his elite killboard
---
* Someone trashed it using this method
---
* Ektallion complained to CCP and zKill
---
* They said FU LOL
---
* Ektallion is now using the same method to trash the killboards of anyone and everyone he thinks will complain about it in an effort to force CCP to change the system and delete the killmails, redeeming his trashed killboard
---
That part's definitely true.  I think my memories are just fuzzy and I'd forgotten we started out with reships in-system.  By the end we still had plenty of ships, but not the logistical capacity to get them into the best possible position, so the reshipping distance started to kill our morale.
---
Just as an FYI from the future, burning all the stuff is meant to burn every last keepstar so that supers and titans cannot dock and will burn in space.
---
Hmm... Okay here it goes.
---
Edit: wow! Thank you, two Ospreys. I wish I'd sent more!
---
All courier missions are is:  take this random crap (marines, garbage, water etc) and deliver it to this other station.   The m3 goes up the higher the missions level.
---
Just a second, are you telling me that \*checks notes\*  cxzqeqw Talvanen is not a real player?
---
i am SHOCKED
---
They would be 10x better with at least particle effects.  These are literal garbage compared to some other skins.
---
Ohh god I felt bad for you until I looked at that kill mail. You should not have that ship anywhere near jita ever. If I were you that ship would be docked deep in a lonley system and all logistics would be done with other ships.
---
One random streamer obviously speaks from a position of authority for an entire alliance. Can confirm. /s
---
A new low in posting was achieved today.
---
ShareX is a great app that you might enjoy.
---
I'm gonna vote for the dude just so everyone in that room at the CSM summit has to listen to his nasally-pinched self important squawking. Worth all of my votes right there.
---
Lol your killboard looks like a jita for dummies handbook. How can that many people be that dumb? Lol good shit. Please don’t blow me up o7
---
I'm gonna have a look at it. Maybe I will. I'm thinking about posting something about New Eden's exploration :D
---
I have always been Quebber and I was never going to be a priest lol.
---
Wow you're really scratching the bottom of the barrel for insults huh. Are you trying to say "because a gsf member didn't jump up for joy when losing a ship, they are obviously butt hurt?"
---
this is a weird one
---
i was thinking that maybe they found the safe of a cloaky camper/intel bot, but there are angel rats on half the kills... don't have an explanation for that
---
Ektallion has been doing this since last night in an effort to force CCP to patch this sht and has 20,000+ kills 
---

I run 9 clients at times. In potato mode I would see 1-2 crashes across all 9 accounts in 1-2 hours. Currently I am seeing 1-2 crashes across all 9 accounts every 5 minutes. I've tried both 32 and 64 bit. Something is definitely different in the cpu usage department.
---
Hey friend.
---
I'll gladly welp my second carrier ever at your side ! 
---
it Was already a pleasure to welp my first one at your side. But why would i stop at one ?
---
Hugs mate
---
Lol I must be playing this game wrong lol you lost a ship worth 350billion? How can that even make sense to fly? How much are you making on those site to even make this worth while?
---
salty 'elite pvpers' came in and dumped downvotes on me rip
---
Free cam can give some amazing shots if you have the time to get it into that just right position
---
what alliance is this and are they taking applications? XD
---
Some do go all rorqs, yes. But you don't have to. There are still people who run a bunch of subcap miners w/ one rorq in null because it has advantages, startup cost being one of them.
---
I started out with 1 rorq and 2 hulk miners and made plenty of isk, was eventually able to have 3 rorqs. Even then I still ran a single rorq with 2 hulks for ice mining where boosted hulks shine.
---
Start small if you like, get a feel for where you are comfortable with the APM, and its not a job.
---
Also, if you do step up more subcap miners you will want to use macks as their larger ore hold gives you time to cycle through them all and dump into the rorq before they fill up.
---
you could look at the oicx/eha siege not a that long ago for one, NER had a few pieces on it, those were the numbers for it in the end:
---
Combined Stats:
---
    Average Pilots Involved Daily: 299
---
    Average Ships Lost Daily: 460
---
    Total Ships Lost: 6444
---
    Average ISK Lost Daily: 12.7 bil
---
    Total ISK Lost: 177.7 bil
---
Sorry bro, rorq Mining in delve is offiline
---
It was pretty obvious panfam wouldn't be contesting M-O once the keepstar was transferred.
---
Congrats though I guess?
---
Nah it'd be a lowsec gate to stain.
---
get deadspace room you crazy kids
---
We had some great fights; imo the best thing about SWEG were the boys - Lowsec meant that we didn't need to grow to a massive size and that meant the no-one was an anonymous pleb.  We got to know all of them and it didn't matter if they had a outrageous French accent, or stoic German we knew (for the most part) each and everyone by the sound of their voice.  Always meant our comms were funny as hell.  I don't think we could have had such a tight knit group in null and it wouldn't have been as much fun as it was.  Should probably reform soon, eh?
---
I always knew you were Team Edward
---
Not for you
---
#thereisnowar
---
Hello
---
I want to ask you about your Corp history. In your platform, you bill yourself as a wormhole candidate. However, I do not recognize any of the corps in your EveWho history as notable wormhole corps that would have developed an understanding of high level PvE, or wormhole PvP like evictions. Instead, the majority of your Corp history is ingrained within Hog Collective, a HS war coalition of questionable repute [see this post for details about some of their wars](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bl4ioo/highsec_elite_coalition_realises_they_are_getting/).
---
 Additionally, you have not been playing for long or very often, which makes you appear very inexperienced. Why are you billing yourself as a WH candidate? Do you have alt characters that partake in activities or corporations that is not evident from your CSM platform? Do you really have the prerequisite knowledge that you’d need to convince people that you’d be a worthwhile CSM?
---
Warp To Me has an Invasion channel too. Warp To Me Invasions.
---
Also good to know. Thanks.
---
Not naming the corp/alliance makes me question the believability of the OP.
---
It's ok. NCPL will go blop some noob alliance in provi to make themselves feel elite again.
---
Guess this guy should be getting a direct invite to NCPL soon?
---
Right? Who tf would name their ship as cheating in 2 languages. You've been had.
---
Is there a problem with osprey's with Jita? I feel like a meme is flying over my head at mach speed.
---
That was a show of force by GalMil, that had been fucking around NS while allowing CalMil to gain control of the warzone to drive up Gallente LP prices and cash out.
---
I mean, it surely was awesomely fun and a lot of exploding happened, but it didn't imply a significant change in LS at all, just another change of tides in the LP farming side of things by a group that had shown absolute superiority over their rivals for quite a few years before that siege.
---
I just made 8 more of them . I mine the ore , I grind the ore , I process the ore , and make new and shiny new bird to fly away and die a miserable horrible death ... The End  ;)
---
gesundheit.
---
in all seriousness, is that one of the new-ish triglavian ships?
---
Let's hope your partner doesn't find out!
---
You had me at uncontrolled erection
---
I really like this. Anti imperium propaganda is this ? Seems ccp being honest about botters and showing the pie chart of shame took the wind out of the other side
---
It's the triglaivian battlecruisers. It has really good range and top of the line dps while having a brick tank. If you search for flower fallen, escape from hell, he has a video with a dual rep drek that murders pmuch any gatecamp lol. 
---
Bonus, the drek can yeah destroyers relatively easy and with good transversal management, most frigs.
---
inb4hestealsallyourcorpsisk
---
Damn it eve onion. I got excited for a second.
---
Going over you kills: 
---
you have like less then 30 kills in wormhole space and 3 losses, you have no corp can known lives in wormhole space in your history. 
---
So i honestly question what gives you any experience in wormhole space ?
---
Bless
---
I think I'll reinstall the client and poke around the industry side of things, perhaps I can get hooked. I don't know next to anything about it so at least it will be new.
---
Eve is something I can't really stay away from, I love the community and the game itself is rad. 
---
Reading around, it seems an indy char combined with a smaller mining group (10+ is a bit excessive to start) would be the way to go.  The inflation of isk has really taken off so everything is even more expensive.
---
Sure is! I haven't personally flown one but they are a pain to kill
---
0700 eve time or 1900 eve time. 7PM eve time is a little confusing.
---
You forgot the /s
---
Immortal and bloodthirsty. Just felt right.
---
Yeah. Though we're kinda low on girls in Dreddit. The only one I know seriously knows how to handle a dic tho.
---
LOL yeah, I was in DnG for one big Huola fight and nobody cared what was flying out of the pos, it was hilarious. Also someone streaming the op and showing exactly where our bridging titan pos was. That was an amazing idea too. About two minutes later we get the reinforced message.
---
Since this is EVE there was probably a third cloaked ship just refreshing dscan and eavesdropping on your conversation.
---
I wouldn't brag about drinking period blood tho
---
Here comes the most over priced Osprey's in the history of EvE.
---
Definitely say no to lasers. That's a shit fit legion. Either hams or rlmls only. You can get an insane amount of ehp on some fits, but they will be slow. Or go an active armor rep tank and be kinda fast but fucked if someone scrams you.
---
True, one doesn't face social justice issues irl and then pick up EVE to fix them.
---
But creating a social environment where others aren't demeaned, so they can enjoy something you love? That's worth whatever amount of work you're willing to put into it.
---
First person is a great way to get a feel of the scale when you fly near Titans :)
---
There's a lot of ways to fit a decent legion, but for pvp small gang/ solo almost always fit hams or rlmls depending on what your targets are. Personally I go cloaky so I can choose. I do either insane ehp buffer tank of up to 300k without cloak or 200k with cloak (but that's a rather blingy fit), of kitey active repper with mwd. 
---
The fit is totally dependent on your target profile. If you get caught by a scram in the mwd option and they neut you, big problems. The high ehp fit is slow as fuck but insanely tanky.
---
Well sure but you still did it in Jita, where there are combat probes up 24/7. You probably even warped straight to your safe from the station.
---
why does that matter
---
A great victory indeed.
---
Same. What am i missing?
---
LOL so true :), NC and PL "Elites" like to beat on the weak yet they can't run fast enough when anyone with the same size shows up, as i said "Elite alliances"...
---
So they only Pick fights they Can win, they dont  diserve any null space anyway. Burn it all.
---
You could get more money tho
---
500 vni’s lost in may ? , 
---
Assuming you are correct would you keep running a bot if it died that much ??
---
Cause you're clearly dumb
---
I am guessing you’re the guy that sells osprey BPCs? :P
---
Can someone direct me to where I can learn about obtaining blueprints?
---
My understanding is unless I have a super-ultra-rare original, I have to buy them?
---
You gonna post some kind of proof on that claim?
---
I enjoyed reading EvE Onion when they had ideas somewhat grounded in reality.
---
Bringing back a core feature such as the Jukebox is simply not feasible. Considering the tech woes throughout the last year, I think its a safe bet to say that the jukebox will break something like Damage Application or Tracking.
---
Trying to keep my hand in yeah! Things slowed down for a while, but we've got some interesting plans!
---
Fair enough dude, do you have the char Quebber?
---
Here's a first person view of bombing some goon Moas
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jCSo6-z5T4
---
It's great for ships that don't need a lot of interaction like an MJD dessie in a stuka fleet because you generally fly towards shit. Unfortunately the FOV isn't any good for other type of anchoring as you rarely point forward.
---
Nothing. Just a silly post that's not the usual silly posts so it's being upvoted.
---
Just abuse the extractors and then /copyskills 
---
CCP don't like this one weird trick though
---
shit post have a down vote!
---
Keep up the grinding Goons. I'm sure it will be worth all the effort when you move back to delve and NC/PL move right back in.
---
The most dangerous game 💀
---
I have not played for very long, that is true. The 2nd player corp on my corp history is the wormhole corp I was referring to, they have since moved to null and I am with HC learning to FC and holding over till I find a good wormhole group to move to, I spend most of my time in their wormhole.
---
I often participate in bomber's bar and spend a great deal of time in the eve-scout channel chatting with newbros.
---
I'm fairly sure that isn't true, there's a timer whereby it still counts as a 'real' loss and you still take the SP penalty. But you are correct to say T3Cs in a delivery hangar won't give one.
---
He overheated his drones
---
Spicy sidepedling there, the logs say otherwise
---
I've had a couple of questions as to my wormhole history,  [Phoenix Federation of Planets](https://evewho.com/corp/Phoenix+Federation+of+Planets), is the corp that I was referring to when I talked about my wormhole experience, as for my current corp and history of corps, I have been in HC for a little bit spending most of my time solo in wormhole space. 
---
as for my Killboard history on wormhole space, I have not done too much in the way of wormhole PVP, most notably welping a [fortizar anchor due to poor hole control](https://zkillboard.com/related/31000376/201805200700/)
---
it's fair, you guys are doing what you said you'd do, we're doing what we said we'd do.  
---
the numbers are what they are. Im having a good time.
---
&gt;So they only Pick fights they Can win,
---
heh, TBF we pick the fights we think we have a chance of winning.
---
Wouldn't this be a good thing for Goons?  ncpl will rebuild and next year Goons come back again, with or without lube, and we collectively laugh at ncpl.
---
[I just posted a comment here to answer your question](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bwbbhu/its_campaign_time_hope_im_not_too_late/epwt89n?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) due to having had this asked a couple of times
---
post logs, im fairly sure i asked him to eat my ass
---
DAMN EVEONION! you had me all excited for a moment
---
Actually it can be combat mission "deliver cargo", L4 is 10 m\^3. With 75 booster you can just reject combat missions till you get deliver cargo. Also, for instalockers its easier to kill ship on undock rather then dock which could result in only empy ships get killed.
---
oooh, sounds awesome!
---
You enjoy hunting what is essentially NPC ships?
---
At the very least use Snipping Tool!
---
I wish this was real. I'd totally give up watching the tournament to have the old jukebox back.
---
No, you don't understand. If someone says congrats in a sarcastic way and doesn't defend their space, it means you didn't actually win.
---
Why skip?  If there are parts of the game you enjoy then just pay to sub one account with real $$.  You can make enough here and there to pay for the ships you need.  And if that isn't enough you can join a group that hands cheap ones out free, or fly Logi, where usually your losses are paid for, or you could buy a PLEX from CCP and sell it in-game to fund quite a lot of pvp ships.
---
Oh i see.
---
nice work... keep it up!
---
You are being blobbed, and you blob other people when given the chance.  It is an accepted part of the game, no reason for anyone to ever complain about it.
---
What's amazing is that nobody cares.
---
Wait is jita lacking on those hmm
---
Give this man an osprey
---
and this "weird trick" does not work. After using an extractor, one gets a 14d cooldown for using /copyskills.
---
You'd think, but the carebears and botters are always looking for someone to shit on these days.
---
It just shows how many bots are being run there simultaneously that it can lose 500 and still be worth it.
---
All good points. I personally favor the Tempest for rolling most holes, as its mass (*very* close to 200 cold and 300 hot) makes rage-rolling much less likely to require a HIC pass at the end. I'll use a Megathron for rolling 3.3kkg holes like the H296, since it can safely go out hot through a reduced but not crit wormhole due to its lower mass.
---
"youre cheating me with EVE again, ARENT YOU!" -basically 90% of everyone's SOs here at some point.
---
She plays WoW, so she should be used to being cheated by now, so I don't think she would make such a big deal about it.
---
For some reason I thought blops fleet fit not solo 
---
OP don’t do the brawl with a plate solo, you will die to anyone with a brain.
---
Yeah im happy to throw them into most situations as I am are usually faster than anything I choose to engage. If I land on something at 0-10km I will apply the web, overload the AB and pull range to about 20km asap. 
---
At this point I can assess their speed and weapon range. If I cannot tank the incoming dps or they have an mwd fitted (which is pretty rare in my experience) I can usually just sling shot them and warp out.
---
Doesnt always work as some people fit mwd's and duel webs but its not often that I cannot dictate range.
---
Another video about to go live of me using it to catch pilots within plexs. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huH40eg9HaI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huH40eg9HaI)
---
Not from your delivery hangar, to move stuff from there to the item hangar (where it appears on your Personal Assets and you can contract/trash/etc) you need to be docked.
---
What's an Osprey?
---
you do realize that nc/pl are transferring stations that goons bash to neutral alt corps right? that means that killed structures wont be shown in the war.
---
&gt; I like the game 
---
&gt; I can never find the drive to play a game if it becomes a job 
---
Right. So the trick here is to not do the things that make it a job. Figure out why you like the game, and do *that* thing. From your initial post, it sounds like you enjoyed being in a nullsec corp. What were you doing in that corp that you enjoyed? You mentioned an interest in trying out industry. It's entirely possible (in fact, recommended) to do that without engaging in vertical integration. That is, try your industry without mining.
---
&gt;didnt want that system anway
---
I wish I had the money to just raise issues like that.
---
I like playing the game. If I was to do this I'd be subbing with real $ because it's both feasible and removes the "need to play" feeling.
---
I don't want to be buying plex to fund in-game activities, though. I've done that in the past, and I don't know how to really describe it but it's like stuff in the game loses its worth and it doesn't matter if I die or throw it all away anymore. 
---
Ultimately what drives me away is the large downtime between things happening: I need a certain level of stimulus or I just get bored. The manufacturing and industry side of things has the possibility of giving me something fun to do between throwing my ship at whatever I can find.  It'd be cool to work with a group of dudes to get things moving and help build alliance ships or manufacture for a purpose. Moon mining also really intrigues me. I like the idea of gathering materials, putting it all together, and creating something that goes somewhere and furthers something. 
---
I'm on the fence between Eve and X4: X4 lets me make my own empire but it's got no gravitas, eve lets me help in an empire and is a fully dynamic experience with the chaos of other humans: Eve would be much more rewarding, but is a commitment and I am trying to figure out if it'd be worth it.
---
My previous Eve attempts normally end up with me trying to fill those large downtime gaps with something, historically solo pvp, and eventually losing interest. Eve PvP is large gaps of nothing happening with moments of insane adrenaline, and while I like it, it's not something to fill a game experience on its own.  Shooting NPCs is boring, I don't like having to commit to a specific schedule for WH life, so industry and makin' stuff seems like a good activity to fill the gaps.
---
So only goons can have space i guess
---
First thing to do is to try and isolate it. First thing to try: replicate the dc steps on another account. Then attempt to replicate after reinstalling the game. Then try and replicate on another computer entirely. Finally try and replicate connected to the internet from a completely different location.
---
[Windows snipping tool](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13776/windows-use-snipping-tool-to-capture-screenshots) is excellent for basic captures off your screen.

Make/Model/Color of the vehicle you were driving: 1986 Plymouth Reliant
---
What highway we were on originally: US Route 80
---
What was on the back of my vehicle that you asked about: A bumper sticker that said "Made in Detorid" 
---
What direction were we heading on Route 93: Towards the Drone Lands
---
What EVE-related sticker did I have on my vehicle: A Viator sticker that said "Put one in me" 
---
Were you the passenger or the driver: Neither
---
Is this just a recent thing? Did you switch to the 64bit client?
---
Maybe if you give a little more info either about your computer specs, and the settings you are using, someone may have encountered a similar problem and can provide a fix.
---
Phoenix Federation of Planets, that should mean something to me well let's look into the corp then just for humor. 
---
recruitment aid says "laid-back hybrid wormhole/hisec corporation"
---
let's find there home J160941 seems like a good bet c2 &gt; c3/HS.
---
So we have a HS corp with less then 60 members, how to explain this without being to dickish, let's start this out with making it absolutely clear i love new people in wormhole space, more corps should move there it's fun and you get fights etc. 
---
Having said all that like you have a sample size of 1 rather small entity in wormhole space that really doesn't make your experience representative for how the majority of wormhole space operates.
---
that only works if youre a goon
---
Very different circumstances? (...starting from when I came back to the game)    
---
Story 1:  Brave Newbies gets farmed for content by NC who's leadership smugged on a podcast, at the time, that Brave didn't deserve their space as a newbie corp and NC would farm them into the ground.  Brave did so well, in fact, that NC/PL had to stop using subcaps and pay Black Legion to not help us THEN drop supers all over the place culminating in the HED-GP super/titan fight.    
---
Story 2:  Goons living pretty chill in Deklein/North get rolled up by the whole game and the leadership of the group aggressing Goons states, "I hope they never log in again." ...again, on a podcast...            
---
Story 3:  Test, while setting up anew in the south, gets NC/PL at their front door attempting to evict them from their SOV.  Test wins thanks to Goon presence and NC/PL cries that Goons showed up.    
---
Story 4: NC/PL poops all over Provi folks and Test assists Provi folks in recovering Provi space from NC/PL.    
---
Story 5:  NC/PL, present day, get shit on by Goons and cry about it, change all timers to avoid as much conflict as possible (fair), and attempt to avoid any fight which they can't win unlike Goons.
---
Init is about the same size. Did they run when init solo deployed to hakonen or was it a miserable failure for init?
---
Well if u cant even defend your own space, then u don’t diserve it. Try takeing delve.... trust me it will be defended.
---
w2s super fleet for good posts
---
Just to be clear, Fozzie said it was an item and not a status effect, or something similar?
---
It's just like in AA: It only works if you work it.
---
Windows? Can I implant it or it is a ship rig? Sorry but I only hack data or relic cores... Can I find this "Windows" in them?
---
Sounds like a trashy alliance. Get a new one. You'll always find socially challenged people, however.
---
That is actually weird I didn't see a scram on you, so he should have booshed you. Maybe you had already clicked wormhole activation and it ticked before the MJFG. That's the only reason I can think of (other then it's a bug).
---
That's gold :D
---
What Is Your Biggest Turn Off In A Crush?
---
I am noone, but wholey agree with this statement. Sorry won't be making it only my WH ticket fammo. ExooKiz has my slot so far...
---
I used to have a random  disconnect issue a while back, was either some windows or BIOS update that enabled a rather aggressive power saving mode, so the game was ok until it needed to load something in from disk, but because it had been put to sleep and didn't respond straight away the game would crash.

Just a friendly piece of advice there. I didn't get you to do a thing, and I wouldn't try to either.

I don't oppose your candidacy because I think you care about the game. I mean I disagree with some of your perceptions, but that's OK. It's good to have a spectrum of perspectives on the CSM.

Have you seen Jay? He's amazing.

Imagine not giving a shit.

who said you were 143rd best? lol

First of all typing the title in caps, doesn't make your shitpost any more relevant.

It's obvious for all to see that NCPL don't care about the region and nobody really cares that Imperium is grinding all these abandoned and undefended structures.
---
I hate to break it to you and not sure if you missed the memo but over 30 keepstars and hundreds of forts have been killed and what your doing is in no way unique, special or elite.
---
Only on days that end with Y.
---
I assume you're flairbaiting, however, the reason we're so gangsta my dude is because we followed the same concept of the USA during and post WWII.  Lots of industry and self-sustainability.  Lots of folks to help with all the things including war.

Glad I got here early.

I think this is going to be good.

---
Who the fuck are you? What did you do? Why did you do it? Is racial discrimination against black people related to them having (in general) bigger dongs and better rythm than white people?
---
Huh, that's pretty good, I guess you really only hard lose to point kiters and dual webs, drone dps, and maybe javelin rockets? So I guess you avoid kestrels, hookbills, slicers, firetails, tristans, and maybe tormentors since they can damage race you at range? How's it fair sliding into a comet, can you get range before he kills you? Do you go for breachers since dual web is just a worse kestrel and they don't get played much?

I'm Redline XIII. I led fleets for the Imperium because it was fun. Yes, it is. Having large genitals and good rhythm is a good thing however discrimination is not always negative.
---
I hope so. After you fired me from the Tosche Station I was left out on my own. I need somewhere to shitpost.
---
What major cultural differences between GSF and NC have you found? I appreciate your opinion at the moment may be a little coloured but being strictly objective.
---
LowSec is where I learned to initially PvP. It's also where i got blowed up the first time. I left because people started to avoid me like the plague and the area was a different time zone. Had some great fights there though like that time a half a dozen from a WH came through and two of us fought them off and killed them all. I was a stratios and corp mate in an apocalpyse i think. Was the most profitable fight I'd ever had until that point. Walked away with 3b in loot.
---
I spend free time hunting random people regularly...give me a reason to hunt someone all the better....calm your tits and quit white knighting spaceship incels
---
I really don't see a problem, someone can pay for a bunch of ships to blow in you name.
---
I HOPE someone does this to me/my corp so looking up intel on us via zkill is one step more, and I can stop hearing "my kill board is so red" from a few on the new guys.
---
outnumbers more than 4/1. is surprised when they dont defend their space...
---
Why are u such a drama queen
---
I would say it definitely increased. Shelby Watkins Powerranger forbade me from posting on reddit. But now he's not my dad anymore. I don't think it's gotten better. My posts are still terrible.
---
Yes that is who I do this as :)
---
In the last 2 weeks goons are so far in the negative there's no way it can be good for them.
---
64bit client is a pretty boring for me, just works, no glitches, no crashes
---
Then maby they can take and hold a nice calm lowsec system. Don’t take what u can’t defend.
---
When I stopped learning from the fleet engagements I got myself involved in. You can really only run Feroxs and Baltecs so much before you run out of new situations to put yourself in. Once I started putting myself in the driver's seat of more advanced doctrines (namely Stukas) and put myself in terrible situations (being camped in by Titans, etc) people gave me shit for it instead of understanding that's where my growth was going to come from. Whenever I wanted to run HACs that were better than Cerbs I was basically told to just know my place. That's when I started realizing I was in the wrong place.
---
That was kind of my point...
---
How would a capital strip miner change this? Unless it had no option of auto repeating the cycle, isn’t it the same as assigning your drones to a new rock when it’s depleted? Click strip miner, afk until rock is depleted.
---
Why leave Goons ?
---
Why join NC ?
---
How do you play boring timer warfare without wanting to kill yourself ?
---
Who are the CSM candidate you look toward ?
---
My dream is that for every region that gets glassed, the attackers drop 5-10 Freeport asshouses in every system on the way out.
---
Have fun grinding to get your regions back.
---
Can you detail the circumstances of your demotion within the fc team and the subsequant circumstances that made you leave. Also how do you find flying in nc compared to imperium.
---
Do you eat ass ?
---
Will this post satisfy your need for attention?
---
Being strictly objective, I really like that the FC team is an actual team instead of just a handful of FCs that pretend like they're the best thing since sliced bread. That's something I never really got to see happen in GSF. In addition, I enjoy the light ribbing that gets given to people for silly things, like getting a Muninn fleet bosoned, and that it doesn't contain slurs that describe the mentally challenged.
---
People within the crew that I associate myself with most often are very nice.
---
People don't use a Praxis because it's so slow that burning back to hole with a Higgs Praxis would be a huge pain.
---
&gt; the module that makes you go faster
---
Overdrive
---
I typically fit my rolling ship with a normal combat fit plus a Higgs, tbh. It's nice to be able to shoot back and neut off hard tackle.
---
They were my favorite fleet doctrine for a while. But it's a Monday. Isn't it nice to have something to do?
---
Ask seddows mom

Fly apron

Fly atron!!!!
---
I'll need to watch some guides, to my present understanding mining is basically step 1. This is due to the fact that any level of manufacturing requires blueprints, which must be purchased or made and thus require an initial investment. 
---
The attraction of mining is as a stepping stone to provide the means to embark upon the rest. Without it, I would need a corp trusting enough to let some random use all their fancy equipment so I can make spreadsheets and giggle at how big my numbers are going to get.
---
I do not. The strategy makers did not send me to NC. Please don't blow my cover, TIA.
---
next thing youre telling me is 1+1=2... only goons are complaining. because their ''war'' turned into mindless structure bashes and not the promised fights and easy kills...
---
i was doing you a favor tbh
---
Happily engage kestrels, tormentors and hookbills. Most people don't bring long range ammo and even if they do you can just overload AB and warp out. 
---
Tristans and slicers are usually a no. If you can be certain that they are close range DPS with an AB then you can try comets and firetails but get it wrong and the atron evaporates pretty quick. Ideally you want to engage these outside plexs or have them come to you.
---
As always this is Eve so there is a counter argument to everything.
---
What is he doing? Joining a corp/alliance with an alt and stat padding it?
---
I left Goons to blaze my own trail in space. I realized it wasn't a place I wanted to be in and I didn't really feel like spending my life krabbing only to blob the next enemy I saw. I wanted to be in a more skilled environment. So far, I'm learning a lot and it's been all great. I also had disagreements with some of the key policies within GSF regarding FCing that I could not get over.
---
Brothuhbob offered me another chance to FC in nullsec for real and I decided that I'd take him up on it.  Only being out of nullsec for a week, I really missed it and the idea of a war that I wouldn't win by default really enticed me.
---
I don't play boring timer warfare. I play when I want, doing what I want, how I want. I'm under no obligation to participate in anything that I don't want to because there are plenty of talented FCs here.
---
I like Dunk Dinkle because I know he knows what the CSM is about. He doesn't pretend like he's going to join the CSM and change the game overnight. He embraces what the position actually is and I admire that.
---
God I hope so.
---
I just started playing again for the first time since 2011.. I wish I would have trained for two years of that :)
---
Hold up..what?
---
Because she's queen in the north?
---
Mini monolith &gt; Reprocess &gt; Handful of tiny stars &gt; go to the gate.... and then fund out Fozzie dumped lore and deleted the mechanics.
---
Who is the CSM candidate you want to see nake it most?
---
You're safe now... On this doll point to where they touched you...
---
well in that case everything I own should be cap stable
---
For as much shit talking as you do on here...I'd work on your grammar. This is brutal to read, and even worse to try and comprehend.
---
No one is talking about you.
---
Source: Am new 143rd best FC
---
Well, yes but actually no. -0.1 is in it's peak cap regen.
---
The details are scarce to me, unfortunately, as no one ever really told me why I was demoted from anything. Not even Kendarr knew right away.
---
&gt; (6:15:55 PM) **Kendarr:** I know  
---
 (6:15:59 PM) **Kendarr:** your being removed from ops too  
---
 (10:23:56 PM) **Redline XIII:** why?   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; (3:41:58 AM) **Kendarr:** I honestly don't know  
---
 (3:42:11 AM) **Kendarr:** You've done something to piss off the wrong people 
---
As far as I was told later, it had something to do with either the way I was FCing on stream or something I said on one of my fleets. I saw people say it was due to "repeated fuck ups" but those were very few and far between as my position as an operations FC was typically just bashing uncontested structures and I very rarely saw real combat.
---
I enjoy flying in NC. immensely. One of the biggest things that I hated about being in Goons was being restricted to flying T1 ships and just bringing more dudes than the enemies. I wanted to fly more HAC doctrines and actually get experience with them. I'm happy to see they've shifted from Cerbs to Eagles as the meta dictated.
---
"Oh no I have to defend my shit against my enemies, why can't it be boring to attack like other structures in the game"
---
The world needs to know
---
\*points to head\* I'm all messed up, sarge.
---
I'm not sure whether the question is which candidate I want to see "make it" or "naked" so I'm going to answer both with the same name: Dunk Dunkle.
---
I'm being oppressed.
---
A better question is why citadels have 2 timers.
---
I agree, no love for botters.
---
The thread though is very much about Goonswarm, its specifically focused on stats to try to portray goonswarm as somehow "dodged" the boting list unfairly, "here is the proof!" Its a fairly common "statistical" practice, take numbers and make them show what you want to in "Opposition" to something else. In this case the OP has looked specifically at Goon renters, come up with some numbers that points towards botting (and I’m not actually questioning if they are correct or not, i wouldn’t be surprised of there were) 
---
To make this a valid point though he would have had to do the same thing for every other alliance. 
---
As of right now the only fact that exists are
---
* 1.Goons have a relative low number of botters connected to them, looking at the side of the Goonswarm main and how much of crabs they are (the public image) its actually very low. The only proof here are the numbers provided by CCP
---
* 2.There are a X number of potentially bots in Goon renter alliances but that has not been competed to anything else so the number is pointless
---
because 3timers for 500m structures arent aids enough, lets put 3timers onto 100m structures.. right?
---
how about ''fuck off''?
---
Love this fucking ship, looking forward to watching when I get home.
---
The ping from Atrum said that Asher was the new 143rd best FC.
---
The following ping from Pittsburgh/Brown Star was talking about the "mean things" I said on reddit.
---
During the Fireside, I was important enough to be called bitter as I left Goons and the Mittani (PBUH) explained that they #didntwantallthosebattleships anyway.
---
Following, he said I was a cool dude on the Meta Show because of the work I do for INN (which I greatly appreciated).
---
Every time I share local with Goons, I am a topic of conversation.
---
Care to retract your statement?
---
Wow
---
they should have a damage cap too
---
sniper bro15 is a good dude.
---
at least back then game was more funny than today
---
Listen, Bunny, you know you're number one on my ballot. But NO ONE else has the dual effect.
---
Wait till you meet me, I’m sure I’ll change your mind 😉
---
I would never...
---
I need the name of the song please.
---
There is no moral high ground in this game...just propaganda and nerds screeching about things that aren’t going their way.  You being Chief Screecher.  Attributing Mittani’s comments to all goons, stereotyping, and drawing simple conclusions based on clearly thin data are the attributes of an individual that has an obvious obsession.  Mittani is not innocent in making the same mistake regarding essentially one data point that a lot of people, including you and the knuckleheads on both sides, have.
---
Individual capsuleers are not responsible for the (botting) actions of others.  You want to call an individual out, fine, just stop it with the grr goons bullshit.
---
I like to watch
---
No rISK, no ISK :D
---
So far my personal ticket looks like: 
---
ExookiZ
---
Compayn
---
Anveri Vestigo
---
teddy Gbyc
---
Styxx
---
Blood Ruin
---
Stitch Kaneland
---
Fiedan
---
I would advice you to vote for more then 1 person, just so if your primary choice get eliminated your secondary choice might make it in. 
---
Most of these folks i feel have a decent claim to being wormholers.
---
:smugdon:
---
So traditionally there was only 1 reinforcement timer which was the case with the POS and POCOs.
---
 I can't remember exactly if the outposts had 3 timers (I seem to recall they did, with the ownership flip at the end) but it's been some time since I've seen those mechanics in action so cannot say for sure.
---
Anyway, then citadels came along and started the 3 RF cycle trend, but POCOs and POS were not changed at the time, so that resulted in the current disparity.
---
Some of the newer structures like the cynojammers/jumpbridges still operate a single timer, but preserve some of the citadel mechanics like damage cap, etc, so you are right, there is some inconsistency with the system.
---
Interesting. You don't find the kestrels and hookbills just web you down? I don't run either without two webs. Same with firetails being either dual web or dual prop 100% of the time?
---
Cross-game integration was part of the origonal plan, along with a deeper cross-integration with Dust.  They spent so much money on that idea for Dust and it bombed so hard, though, that I'd be highly shocked if they were willing to chase that wisp a second time.
---
Must be a goon too. Look at how happy he is about it.
---
No, I clicked wh activation only when I saw that I did not get booshed.
---
Maybe my overview had delayed update on range...?
---
POCOs predate Upwell by several years.  They are more similar to starbases.
---
Also, people don't live out of POCOs.
---
Not roleplaying is technically roleplaying since we (capsuleers) are immortal egotistical psychopaths that see the universe as our playground.    
---
As if it were all just a game.
---
Ingame is canon
---
Oh we have a full ticket, sadly the top part was taken by game stability and shit and the bottom part is loyalty/empire building :(. Middle part we got the Wher along with a pirate and some guy that I srsly hope I get CSM audio of them telling him to shit the fuck up(no disrespect to him, I enjoyed his campaigning)
---
What's it like being in Original Sinners?  I heard their commies or something.
---
There are quite a few groups of roleplayers in EVE. I have an alt account - a bunch of us are alpha pilots that have a role play event weekly.
---
Nice, could you introduce me to this kind of experience, I would acyually love it!
---
In the Twilight series, the main vampire guy, Edward, drinks the main protagonist, Bella's period blood to quench his blood lust but not harm her since he loves her.
---
Spoiler there is no way to check how you voted for, so you don't have to vote corp/alliance/coalition ticket.
---
They're great dudes, man. First night I was in we went out in Drekavacs (I got one from Bob for free) and fought the blob. It was a blast. And they're also very supportive of eachother and I feel like I fit in with them pretty well.
---
Outposts did have 3 timers.
---
Sometimes. If the pilot is on the ball and I land at 0km then sure they have a good chance to stop me but I find that they are often slow to lock or fail to overload their webs giving me enough time to pull range. I'll yolo into some and try to get some footage.
---
Once upon a time, CVA was all lolplayer corps.  I don't know if that's still the case or not, though.
---
Well, there was some two major role-playing groups in Eve.  That was a while back.
---
It is also hard to grow a role-playing-only corp.  That tends to lead to a demise, either by attrition or diffusion.
---
Fozzie said it used old trigger mechanics from PVE. From the triggers I know the short list would be approaching a thing or having something in your cargo when activating the gate, maybe a combination of the two.
---
Then in addition to that Fozzie said the settings for the lights had an unintentional randomness. I don't recall exactly what was said, but I would read that as saying the trigger doesn't always trigger, so just test anything you're trying multiple times. Of course, maybe its something stupid like how [orbital planes used to use velocity](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/53iig6/ccpls_let_me_pick_the_angle_of_orbit/d7uvdy5/) to determine their inclination... so good luck if thats the case.
---
Oh I'm aware, I just plan on being there for the next year so I would like to be in the employee break room for once. Sorry man I know, I know...
---
I do understand this, but I was thinking that we usually do metagame. What was I thinking is a little more immersive. So for example you would have a behavior similar to that we see on CCP vids.
---
Welp. I asked.
---
I see, people get bored and start meta-gaming. As in Dnd sometimes.
---
Lmao
---
Once upon a time in Eve term could mean 2010, I was 10 at the time XD.
---
Why roleplay with the universe when player conflicts allow you to be a lot more involved and concerned than any of random bullshit which you have no power over.
---
&gt;print screen
---
Snipping tool is where it's at
---
Like goon supers in 93pi?
---
Tbf, the kind of assholes capsuleers are, it's almost harder to break character than to be in it.
---
I don't mean role-playing as if you couldn't change the universe you were in, and I would rather stick with what the game is right now than get people obliged to role-play.
---
Man I really want a feature like that to come to EVE. Maybe I'm too casual but dang that's my dream of the way I want to experience EVE Online.
---
If there is no reason or even a reference whatsover, then it just looks like peak EVE autism to me...
---
Calm down seddows dont use so many words at once.  Your smooth brain can barely handle target calling.
---
Now you're getting it!
---
tbf everyone who leaves Goons that isn't generic f1 is branded "bitter, didn't want them anyway, mentally unstable" etc.
---
I see, so Eve is where you could show your darkest side and be appreciated for that, a psychiatrist would actually love it, wouldn't he?
---
Then you were 6 when I was last aware of CVA being a roleplay alliance.
---
So they're free basically? /s
---
I'm not saying forcing anyone, but why even roleplay at all. The Eve universe story is stuck behind what the devs want to makes of it and although they like to make puzzle about trigs and all, it's not really heavy on.
---
Why even bother with roleplay when your IG actions already have meaning and consequences and all.
---
It won't happen.  Valkyrie is already a largely dead IP.  They have no motivation to drop that kind of money and time into trying to strap its corpse to Eve.
---
That's not kb padding. That's their primary way of earning isk. People ignore the warnings about that entrance and fly around with [juicy cargo](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77080109/). I get new players not understanding, but you see 1+year characters jumping right from high-sec into their bubble traps. I mean...imagine jumping into a system like SV5 with [this](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77049208/) and filling your pod with [this](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77049213/).
---
Do you have virgin broadband and a super hub 2 by any chance?
---
i just hope PL does not come and bring 120 muninns again, killing and podding every single subcap pilot on grid for cheap kills
---
Keep it up, leave no poco untouched. 
---
Meanwhile I have having the time of my life killing everything that thinks about mining/ratting in delve.
---
For a moment I had hopes that you guys were actually looking at buffing the tempest/autocannons....  
---
Ah well, back to my misery
---
 For a moment I had hopes that you guys were actually looking at buffing the tempest/autocannons....  
---
How did they lose a trillion isk in delve?
---
"biology"  videos!  That was a nice touch
---
Hahahahahhahahahhaha
---
You can't see my face, but my jaw is dropping in horror right now.
---
Mining is not step one. You are correct that an initial investment is required, but mining is just about the worst way possible to make that initial investment. Not only is mining terrible isk/hr for a new player, the skills you need to get better at it barely overlap with the skills you need for industry at all.
---
Plenty of corps are trusting enough to let non-members use their fancy equipment. You can find those all over highsec. You'll need to source your own blueprints, but a starter set of a couple unresearched (for example) T1 rig blueprints are very affordable. Shoot me a dm. I might be willing to help out with the initial investment problem. More people playing this game is a thing I care about, and if you go with your mining plan all I see in your future is burnout and quitting again.
---
I am actually philophically thinking about the extraordinary feat CCP was able to make. Eve online is probably th only game I am playing that is made in a year I can't actually remember nothing about it :D
---
Shhh they dont understand this part yet....they just figure out how jammers work.
---
No, deliver ships to player in a structure in wormhole, delete structure, kill contents. Because they're now owned by the delivered-to player, their name is on the kill mail. You have no way to reject deliveries, and, obviously, no sane way of obtaining the delivered assets.
---
Sorry, I assumed they had more than 6m SP
---
200-300 mil/hour, sometimes more if I'm lucky
---
utterly satisfying. the moment sabres collapsed out and let you go for that cheeky falcon is gold.
---
Then I knew the guy that owned that char before you in Cursed Souls and Shadow Incursion. GL with everything bud I live near Gehi so I may whore :)
---
Frantically tabbing through accounts when you hear a wormhole activation only to later see your corpmate pop up on screen so you yell at him on comms that he should announce his jumps.
---
&gt;attempt to avoid any fight which they can't win unlike Goons.
---
So the famed FABIAN STRATEGY never occurred?
---
I don't think so. The 'Liminal' triglavian ships use missile launchers with Mjolnir or Kinetic damage (at the moment) presumably to stop people from cheesing them with full anti thermal/explosive tanks and to mess up reactive hardeners. Kind of like how in Incursions Sansha deal EM/Thermal with their primary laser weapon and then Kinetic/Explosive with Missiles, I think Drifters and Sleepers function similarly.
---
I think you do not only deserve an upvote, I'm giving you a point in what you are saying, it makes absolute sense, and it's the reason most of us here, I think, love and play Eve :D
---
PS:If only I weren't drunk I could have written this without the auto-correct XD
---
"Winning" doesn't mean much when you can just redefine what it means to win to fit your current situation.
---
&gt;I know EVE to be a haven of former military men who feel like they've been treated unfairly
---
You "know". Well, at least you don't equivocate.
---
I'm sorry but this sounds like bullshit. I've been in a few alliances with a number of fellow vets (Yes, I'm one of the bad guys) and we didn't regularly trash women, gays (hard to believe but most of us gave no shit about the guys we *knew* were gay in our commands), or believed we were treated unfairly, whatever that means.
---
You may very well be in a shitty alliance with guys who mostly received BCD or OTH discharges but I kinda doubt it. 
---
Your post seems more like a caricature of military guys written by someone who dislikes the guys willing to get dirty to keep their society safe.
---
Before you go off the deep end accusing me of homophobia or of having a case of toxic masculinity, I'll just say that's not the case. You certainly don't have to believe me but it's true. The fact that you hid their name as well as your own leads me to believe you're just shit-stirring on Reddit. That's cool; I do that too, sometimes.
---
Lots of rorqs and supers and other shit are dying.
---
Why was it almost a Test diplo incident when we popped your monitor in GE a couple weeks ago? Spai?
---
You know how trump got the troll vote in the US Election?
---
Well you're my troll vote. I'd love to see you in the CSM. Love to watch you squirm.
---
It'd be funny
---
would you say that slurs are not tolerated in nc
---
Don't get too excited. Most people in this sub have socks that were made in a year you can't remember.
---
Ok that makes sense, I actually like the idea of that
---
Check out /r/evejobs!
---
Come to Provi
---
Your jest would be indicative the this time around you would advocate the goons not make the same mistake and elect to finish NC off rather than let them retreat.
---
scarebears for life.
---
We were running an arranged fleet fight vs. TEST. We were asked to come into Immensea (which I protested) and upon our first jump into system met part of the Brave super fleet. As penance, the TEST FC said he would make sure my Monitor lived since we lost the fight handily due to being gibbed by supers.
---
After the loss, they SRP'd it for me.
---
I don't know that I would say that, but I haven't seen anyone throwing slurs around. I'm sure there are some circles (as there is everywhere) that have them.
---
Well, I think I could make more than thank you all for the support you gave to such a wonderful game!
---
Scarebears for my fucking life duder.
---
?
---
Thanks for the advice. I plan to when I’m looking to join another corps! I kind of just wanna fly around solo for a week though to re-familiarize myself with the game
---
&gt;I see, so Eve is where you could show your darkest side and be appreciated for that
---
Not only that, but you are expected to be ruthless, because that's the only way to make it out there.
---
It accepts web assembly, so you can compile from quite a few other languages ([go nuts](https://github.com/appcypher/awesome-wasm-langs)). [This explains](https://docs.screeps.com/modules.html#Binary-modules) how to actually use the binary mods. Additionally, even without asm, you can write in elm, clojurescript, and typescript or go nuts with one of the [transpilers](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/wiki/List-of-languages-that-compile-to-JS).
---
New Eden is the place where psychopaths meet their counterparts
---
Interesting. That Test FC probably should have shared that information with Catch standing fleet lol. Sorry fam.
---
By the way spammer, I went ahead and reported this to humble bundle! Promoting on reddit is a violation of their ToS. Knowledge is power! I've also taken the liberty of reporting your awful subreddit + spamming tactics to various MMO subreddits as well as the reddit admins. They don't take kindly to spam.

If you want to fly around solo and get better at PVP, you should go do some faction warfare. You can go to small sites and fight frigate vs frigate. Super engaging and the ships you lose are only worth like 1m.
---
I don't really recommend ratting in hisec or lowsec. You make very little ISK and it's very easy to hunt you down. You should roam nullsec and do exploration. Or hop into a wormhole!
---
Have you tried using a VPN? I had the strangest disconnects for a long time before getting one. If I disco now, 9 times out of 10 there's an EVE DED post on reddit.
---
It was all good, my dude. I was just frustrated because of the messy engagement.
---
We'll be lucky if Nova releases, and doubly lucky if it integrates with EVE. Valkyrie is dead unfortunately, but that's primarily due to CCP choosing (again) platform exclusivity at launch for no reason whatsoever.
---
I dont even log in anymore. :p so not even able to mine or f1 buddy.
---
WINGSPAN says hi!
---
Exploration does seem to be the money maker nowadays, I have an alt that I trained to do some exploration so maybe I’ll hit that up. I was ratting in Null back in the day but that’s not a solo activity and risky to do without a corps for support.
---
A.I. show me information on WINGSPAN

It took this comment for me to add two and two together.

Real talk redline, why did you leave GSF?
---
&gt;with the new jammers for defense...   could be outnumbered 1/6 and still come out ahead easily.
---
Is there like a downvote not or something? I don't want to live in a world where Jin'taan posts sit at 0

no
---
Who?
---
How do you get to the belt if you can't warp?
---
Don't do that... don't give me hope
---
Team 10 or 20?
---
Totally agree that exploration and facwar are the go-tos for the solo newbro. Learn to handle yourself navigating space and in different kinds of fights! :D
---
Not winning on my terms is not winning.
---
I don't pretend like that doesn't happen. Goons have been calling out PanFam for renting to botters and that's 100% valid. But Goons then pretending like they themselves don't then rent to botters is hypocrisy.
---
When someone else does it, they're responsible for the actions of who they rent to. When they do it, it's only the renters botting and not them so they're good. That's hypocrisy.
---
I think it’s because you have a module that uses lots of cap with a high cycle time/cool down time. For example is the MJD and some of the bursts.
---
Hope it helps
---
For what it's worth, your Monitor lives on as the first killmark on my Vindi.
---
The ships drop in cans though. So you have to actually launch them into space first
---
Why are a bunch of you guys firesaling your stuff in Delve?  Giving up already?
---
xd
---
newbro here why does local suck that’s where i make all my friends
---
There still are roleplayers in the game, check out the backstage forums  [http://backstage.eve-inspiracy.com/](http://backstage.eve-inspiracy.com/) . There still also are a lot of lore nerds in the game like /u/ashterothi. I'm sure if you're interested you can probably find eve players to roleplay in the community at backstage. 
---
I feel like roleplaying has taken a back-seat from about 2009, it used to be a lot more common and even alliances in nullsec used to engage in light roleplaying on the forums when it came to things like declarations of war and statements on CAOD. What changed to make roleplaying take more of a backseat is hard to say, maybe a combination of multiple factors, less of a focus on eve lore/story driven elements, from Dominion onwards it's played much less of an important role, players becoming more competitive and playing the game in a more focused min/max way? Killboards? easier access to tools that share information on the game and easier access to communication tools like Ventrilo/Teamspeak, minimisation of RPG elements in the game like the removal of bloodline and racial attribute differences, normalisation of roles across racial ships, players getting older and leaving the game and younger aged players not being as interested in roleplaying... All of these probably had some impact
---
They're aids enough with 1 timer
---
and guided void bombs
---
Who are the other talented FCs in NC besides yourself?
---
Think ur mixing up fanfic and cannon again.
---
It’s always good to have ambition, but your background and experiences won’t garner the respect of actual wormholers at all. It’s a very dynamic environment that needs a lot of experience in different fields of Eve in order to represent adequately.
---
tacos or burritos ??
---
Think we found the problem
---
It's EVE tinder ..
---
I see, thank you very much for the information. Hava safe flight fellow capsuleer and remember, beware more of friends than enemies since as ancient romans said: "Keep the friends close, but the enemies closer"~Terran anecdote
---
What hurts the alliance more?  Having to replace billions in sov structures that directly affect industry and take weeks to months to recover from or replacing ships that have literally already been replaced?   You guys keep doing what you’re doing and keep falling further and further behind,
---
that is about what I was expecting to be honest, no harm in trying and it only gets my name out there so in the future I can improve my resume and hopefully get a better bid latter on.
---
If people wish to vote for me then so be it. If not, I can only hope that they will instead vote for a candidate like Exooki or olmeca, both are runners that I am planning to vote for with my alt accounts. About the last thing I want to see is another CSM that treats wormholes as a last thought like the last few have.
---
Hop on Sisi and see if it happens there
---
how did they like it when u welped the fleets for them
---
An important aspect of wormholes is stealth. When you're in a wormhole, local chat is effectively disabled. Nobody shows up in local *unless they send a message*. Chatting in local reveals to everyone in the system that you're there, and that can be bad!
---
They actually removed me from that squad. When I tried to find out why, Chiimera told me that he "trusted the other leaders to make decisions while he was away" and everyone else just told me to think really hard about it.
---
I left GSF because I was tired of being held down and restricted. I was tired of people treating me like I wasn't worth a damn because I valued fights over structure bashing and I wanted to actually have to try instead of playing EVE on easy.
---
Enlighten me, cause I am positive it was canon. I hope I'm wrong and Stephanie Meyer isn't more twisted than Eli Roth.
---
Why are you so desperate for attention? Like I didn’t even know who you were / heard of you till you started being a shitter on me Reddit’s.
---
Team 10.
---
You are in a shitty alliance. You will most likely jump from place to place before you find a home. It can take awhile to find something just right for you. Keep moving around till you find something that you like. I know there are a lot of women in Imperium. I have never heard anyone treat them with disrespect in my alliance or in my coalition squads. Not to say that those people do not exist within the coalition but I am fairly certain if they were vocal about it they would get destroyed.
---
As long as someone had some fun with it.
---
Have you seen our killboard?  We take alot more fights than we don't.  "Official" wars are way more Fabian oriented then peacetime.
---
They do have some good mind bleach going on.
---
God that's such a loaded question. I love soft tacos, which means I basically love unrolled burritos. I also love burritos.
---
Yickes
---
Wasn't looking to fly anything other than a frigate to start. It's not like I was looking to fly a Titan the first week. I'll just sit on the character. Not going to suck out 125m SP and reinject and lose the SP via doing it. Oh well.
---
Ugh, it's borderline but I'll allow it
---
Agreed, we need more consitent timer, Upwell structures should have the same timers as POCOs.
---
Mind you, being on dscan is also revealing to everyone that you are there. Maybe it doesn't give the exact character name but for a random daytripper that isn't really important.
---
You cared enough to reply.
---
Who would win in wrestling match? Lemmy or God?
---
O, I don’t really care, if someone is stupid enough to fly around in their capital ship in delve, they deserve whatever’s coming to them.
---
I’m in goons and we are constantly told not to fly anything expensive in delve. It’s always at the top of TNT alliance chat and plastered all over the forum.
---
That... doesn't make any sense as a reply to what I said.  
---
If you stick to hardcore NPSI and shoot at everyone who isn't in your fleet, then that forces you to play Eve every hour of the day? Say what?  
---
Maybe it's changed since I was an active player, but don't you guys form up in "safe" places where everyone can dock, so people from any group can join up without too much hassle. You fly somewhere together, and shoot at everything that isn't in your fleet. Then you all get podded or fly back and the fleet is over. People go back to their corps/alliances until next time.  
---
Rinse and repeat.  
---
That's the simplicity that makes NPSI so attractive. Only two "sides", your fleet vs everyone else, no politics, no bullshit.  
---
You start inserting yourself on one side of a long running war where there's bad blood, then you're not NPSI any more, and you lose the very thing that makes people from all over join up in the first place.  
---
FWIW, I left Provi last year, because I was tired of their bullshit, so by all means, have fun killing them. But kill everyone who lives there, CVA, HTP, whomever.  
---
At least any of them that aren't in your fleet. :-)
---
gaming on wifi or lan connection? If you are on wifi, are you in a congested area with a lot of other wifi connections like an apt building? If so, use an app to look at wifi channels and see which ones are less congested with better signal strength and switch your routers wifi channel manually to one of those channels. A lot of ISP provided modems/routers on wireless G will only use 3 of the 11 channels available by default so you end up with everyone in an apt building all on channels 1, 6, or 11. Better yet, get a power line ethernet adapter and use that to get a LAN connection if running wires is not feasible.
---
Ran malwarebytes (https://www.malwarebytes.com/) and cleaned pc? 
---
Installed Leatrix Latency Fix (http://www.leatrix.com/leatrix-latency-fix)? (this one was originally for wow but it does solve a lot of latency issues with a lot of multiplayer games)
---
Defrag hard drive? Also, made sure you have plenty of free space?
---
Thats all I can think of for now.
---
It will.  It will take months for your industry to recover, for example it takes weeks to get a full moon frack.  In the meantime goons return home to an untouched infrastructure and start selling moon goo that has spiked since your industry is in flames.  Wash, Rinse, Repeat.
---
Something important about d-scan though is that not everyone shows up on it (cloaky boys and black-ops ships are invisible), and it also has a limited range. Showing up on d-scan is, relatively speaking, safer than showing up in local.
---
I've seen a lot of toxicity like this in EVE in general. It's definitely not everywhere though. I assume you're in nullsec now? If you're ever looking to try out wormholes and want a friendlier environment then come join us over at ['Forced Content'](https://www.reddit.com/r/evejobs/comments/bruklx/c4_35farcy_forced_content_not_forced_ops/) we're pretty laid back and we don't support toxic environments like this.
---
REALLY quickly!
---
Some of the ones that come to mind are Brothuhbob, BlazingBunny, Admiral Wheeler, Zeroniss, Korvin, Killah, among others.
---
I didn't actually hear Matterall's comments on Gold Ammo. But if they were anything other than "Fuck that shit straight to hell and far enough away that it never comes back to mind" then I disagree with him.
---
The thing that drives me to be an FC is that I feel like I'm actually a pretty competent leader and having people trusting me to lead them makes me feel good. It's one of the most challenging things one can do in EVE Online because not only do you need to fly your ship but you're basically flying everyone else's.
---
Also, I owe this all to you. If you hadn't invited me to CAISH's group, I probably would've been just another footnote on the "could've been an FC encyclopedia".
---
Everyone role plays, if only that they're good at EVE.
---
Nice. I’d post a bottle of TAPI’s favorite wine, but they only sell it in boxes. :D
---
Your house is so much nicer than mine.
---
Shattered is that you?
---
you are gay.
---
Presumably the following happens:
---
warp to grid/dc/emergency warp 1million km off/relog/land on original destination
---
Waaaait… what in the lowsec gate to Stain is going on here?
---
I didn't welp anywhere near as many fleets as you, my friend. Please come up with another way to throw shade at me. I never announced before my fleet "Okay, let's go die!" or anything of the sort.
---
But as far as I'm aware, my fleets were immensely popular.
---
That sounds familiar
---
&gt; that pretend like they're the best thing since sliced bread.
---
I always sed i was shit.
---
Then I guess you're not the target audience for this AMA. And that's fine with me.
---
Lemmy, obviously.
---
Sorry, I don't know which is which.
---
Hahhahahahahahahahahaha
---
Why would I look at your killboard? They don't matter, as we've been informed time and again, since it's one of the goon talking points you all have to follow.
---
&gt; that public fleets aren't allowed to work with others
---
If you join one side in a now ongoing conflict and have decided to not shoot that side during fleets, it's by **definition** not NPSI. It's still a public fleet. No one is saying it's not a public fleet or that public fleets "aren't allowed to work with others". It's just literally not **Not Purple Shoot It**. That's the objection. It's not even third partying, as the fleets are actually, effectively, a member of one of the two parties in the battle.
---
i’m sure we could work something out, how many do you want
---
[Here's what I found on Google about WINGSPAN Delivery Services](https://www.torpedodelivery.com).
---
WINGSPAN Delivery Services is a covert-ops focused organization in the sci-fi MMORPG EVE Online. With more than 400 pilots, WINGSPAN is the largest corporation of its kind in the game, specializing in unrequested munitions delivery to capsuleer customers throughout wormhole space.

when ccp gona get courier missions out of game?same shit i see in stain ,1 guy with 9 yacht botting all day
---
quafe ultra mission dude
---
u dont need space
---
I didn't give you permission to share that motherfucker¬
---
I cant speak to that? because im not doing that?  
---
On the contrary, was about to setup some alts out there to participate in some of the entertainment.
---
A.I. What is this "Goolgle", aren't you using Terran technology again, are you?
---
My bad, my A.I. was hit by a Plutonium Charge and went crazy from then on.
---
Fellow capsuleer, since you introduced me to this, WINGSPAN, I am gonna take a look at it.
---
That's not how it works.  Guess we were going to have this talk eventually.  You see, when a mommy osprey and a daddy osprey love each other very much...
---
I'm just curious - why is the automatic/emergency warp different, do you think?
---
From someone who roams a lot of fucking null through a nullsec static:
---
FRT has bots that rent, but the alliance itself isn't bad bot-wise. Roaming FRT space you see a lot of Rorquals, semi-afk Ishtar/VNIs (that you can kill) and very active defense fleets. I am sure some of them use their own renter alliances for their bots, though. FRT Treasury is infested with bots.
---
TEST does not have many bots under their own alliance name either, but they do rent out to a metric fuckton of groups that love botting. Feythabolis? Parts of Paragon Soul? Omist (with Army of Mango)? TEST has botting all over them, don't kid yourself. 
---
So, all in all, stones, glass houses...
---
You just \*know\* she dances naked on mailboxes.  Why else would anyone play current-state WOW?
---
I am merely middle management, I don't have a say in hiring and firing.
---
Would it give you hope? I mean, as someone who played in 2005-2010, technically speaking, the client we have now is absolutely goddamn amazing, both visually and in functionality. Wouldn't trade it for the world for the old version (Static overview? Weapons that cant be grouped? wtf)
---
While CCP can be blamed for the mess that is Upwell, the players are to blame as well, forming these stupidly massive coalitions that utterly wreck anything else but other coalitions.
---
They absolutely do.
---
Still a ton of shit dying. It's amazing.
---
Our killboard tells a story of taking more fights than your group does.  That is all...we truly don't care about our killboard in favor of the endgoal of dominating you entirely.  This game, you have to agree, is a testbed for various types of military and industry strategy. We're clearly winning regardless of the political drivel you guys attempt on reddit.  It may take us a minute because we're a majority of F1 button smashers but we'll get it in the end.
---
The space Pope?
---
Having made the drive from Londonderry to Boston a few times, I just want to say I approve of more New Englanders playing EVE. Hope the dude finds you!
---
Back when I was winning everyone had fun. Right.
---
Glad to be of service. As the corporation CEO, I'd be glad to answer any questions you have. o7
---
EVEsdropping\*
---
I hit a personal high score on a single can yesterday. Opened it up and had 100 million ISK worth of intact plates. :D
---
Yay null sec! lol
---
You absolutely can get kills.  
---
I have a video showcasing a Merlin fit that is about ganking in nullsec if you're interested. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLYl39hWUfY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLYl39hWUfY) you can gank some lesser tanked miners and industrial traffic, as well as enemy PVP frigate hulls and some long range weapon destroyers that will struggle with your superior stats at close range. My fit listed there is a little more SP intensive though, you can drop the Tech 2 medium extender for an Azetropic Restrained one and it should fit with reasonable skills.
---
It's...one region. You're gonna be at this for 6 months if you want to burn absolutely everything.
---
iv said it before and ill say it again, this game will die a slow death that people like jester predict. Iv seen it and lots see it now. The only thing that would save it is a full rewrite of the games code from scratch, no frakenstien bullshit. But the problem is how do people wait for that, thats not a fast or easy task. And will everything transfer? will people follow a blank slate.
---
Eve as it is the frankestien of code that is 10+ years old will not survive, they can only patch and patch and patch the corpse so long.
---
I dont think you understand how Eve industry works. Let alone how the imperium works. Everyone losing things are doing so at their own risk. Literally no one cares about it. Maybe some who cant replace their losses care but thats about it. Every time the Imperium deploys this is all their opposition can do....thats why i am laughing at you.
---
He needs to join Goons and do it, only way to get it changed :)
---
You were the best thing about GSF.
---
Probably because POS only have one timer.
---
shuttleboy no longer numba one, rip in peppers roni
---
this is nc winning the war
---
I know how it works.
---
Nobody in NC cares about losing tribute either. And that's why we're laughing at you.
---
It was valuable CONTEXT! I have more logs, but I'll conceal yours from now on. &lt;3
---
Dont quit your day job.
---
Trick question, Lemmy is god.
---
This is a good post
---
Okay, just to be clear. I own the structure. I deliver the items, in my own structure, to my enemy. I delete MY structure, and the items, in delivery to my enemy just float in space. I kill them and ruin a targeted users stats? If that is true, that is really unfortunate zkillboard won't adjust those.
---
This is hilarious. Every FC is an attention seeker but by FAR Seddow, are you the least qualified to call someone else out on it 🤣
---
There is some good and bad advice in this thread so be careful. First solo and small gang are very different for the legion. If you go solo in null then the legion is really best at 100mn laser. It has the dps, the speed, the damage mitigation and is unscramable which is what you need to survive solo in null. It’s one of the strongest solo ships out there but very demanding piloting wise. Lots of people have good videos showing how to use it. You used to go pulses but now beams are even better if you can pilot well enough to use them. Beware of long webs that will delete your speed and sig tanking, multiple ramjags with webs that will nag your lasers with crazy em/therm resists and god modules and the trig stuff that doesn’t give a shit about tracking. Other possible fits are kitey 50mn neut rapid lights (good for killing small stuff but you need to use all your rigs to get your missiles to a decent speed/range and you have shit sustained dps despite your strong neutes so by the time you kill anything you’re getting blobed). Kitey mwd laser fits are just way to susceptible to ramjags and the like. Missile cov ops + neut fits are great for ganking pve targets but will easily get baited and destroyed. In small gang take the same 100mn legion until your tank can’t hold what your own gang will trigger as response. Then at this point you will mainly use the legion as logi+links for an armor gang (trig stuff mainly - it competes with the loki in that role), anti-tackle (but you could use a zealot instead) or dps+neut combo (mostly ham+2 neutes - trig stuff does it just as well now but it can’t be cov ops or refit to travel).
---
I dont make a post on reddit begging for people to ask me questions. I just do it in local :p
---
Not caring would be not showing up to SH1 but ok, keep telling yourself that. Dont drink the koolaid blindly.
---
Hey Red,
---
Always enjoyed the scarebear fleets, was bummed when they pushed you deeper into autz and out of ghost time zone for us nightshift folks. 
---
How would you recommend I cope with the new GTZ reality of  John Whittaker &gt; Redlinexiii?
---
John is a great guy and fc , but I kinda burned that bridge. Put myself in a rough spot.
---
Thanks for continuing to be a great source of content for eve, in fleets and in drama!
---
 [https://zkillboard.com/br/109732/](https://zkillboard.com/br/109732/)  this is why we didn't like you fcing hacs
---
what is there not to be sure about? I had that happen to me aswell perhaps the number of T3D undocks necessary is indeed exaggerated but it is an actual bug
---
Is it true that the Imperium has a philosphy of not fighting unless they significantly outnumber their enemy? Or is it just coincidence because they have more people in general?
---
Have you tried joining a corp yet?  One big enough to have someone on an most given times you play?   A good corp will make this game truly great for you, and a bad one will make it horrible.  If you ask here about any of them you will probably get a range of accurate to semi-accurate answers.
---
You can fight with them, make money with them, just hang out on comms with them.  Just make sure they are a good fit with your own personality.
---
In other games, I like resource harvesting, and turning it into stuff, hence why mining is where my thoughts focused. I figured with a bunch of alts it could be something worthwhile but I guess not. Ultimately this just highlights my unfamiliarity with this aspect of Eve.
---
I can throw a plex at it for the initial investment, the problem is finding the fun to keep playing.
---
if you want to start solo pvp with little experience camping relic sites and ganking hunters is pretty fun
---
Why don't you have a Titan?
---
That's true but if you were having a conversation over dscan, you were obviously visible on it.
---
Stop complaining about how CSM doesn’t do anything. If you keeps saying it people might actually believe you and stop voting.
---
There are actually several medium size corps/alliances that would identify as lite to heavy roleplay. It is not particularly hard to find us either, just look at who is posting in the IGS.
---
We could leave and I wouldn't give a fuck. The nomadic way of life was more fun.
---
It's not at all the way you suggested, is it.  Goons are having fun calling out others when the evidence was produced *only because* they've been continually called out for it, unjustly it turned out.  Notwithstanding the fact that the PB botters rented PB a few months ago after having been elsewhere in the galaxy for years - and that did not concern you one tiny bit.
---
Last saw they were 15 mil in Jita.
---
Sp farm is the best passive income in the game! Idk why more people don't do it
---
Remember that most combat oriented players still do something to make some game money.  
---
If you find one that is indy focused, it might be hard to get them to undock for a fight.  
---
If you find a combat focused group, most of the members probably fund their combat with something in-game and will be able to teach you the ins and outs of each choice.
---
How did you manage to make yourself look like a cunt by joining ncdot...?
---
Counter point. Just do both. If you like roleplaying in any other medium why not also do it while doing all the other thing you find fun in Eve.
---
You underestimate the levels of autism that goons have.
---
&gt;le Reddit's
---
9GAG in 2019 😂
---
Joining a corp is my first action every time. I just get bored easily so I want something i can do 24/7 as a downtime filler.
---
Not every medium is good for roleplaying ?
---
Soon TM i guess
---
you are jumping between two extremes, the game existed in between the Upwell nightmare and the old classic with nano multiprop BS and ungroupable guns, somewhere around that time EvE was great...
---
Real question: why do you need to compete with skill farms? What metric are you comparing against with them?
---
I need to find that something myself, which is what started this "maybe i should try industy" thought. 
---
I play for the PvP, but it tends to be moments of adrenaline with long periods of downtime. I'm hoping that by filling the downtime with economic activity I can prevent my own loss of interest.
---
John is a great dude and a great FC. Trust him to take care of you.
---
The OP is a complete fucking idiot.  Nobody said Goon "renters" aren't botting.  They were on the fucking graph.  It's just that he's got a reddit hardon for botters associated with Goons specifically.  He doesn't post about others.  Now you see that Goons proper - that is to say Delve non-renter Goons, aren't even on the graph in terms of ban frequency *despite being the largest player group in the game by far*.
---
No, if she wasn't such a pussy and decided to actually let the Voltari have their war happen it would've been pretty good.  As it stands, it's was ok in book form and terrible in movie form.  If Meyer decided to make the war that was being built up for so long actually happen, it could've possibly gone in to the 'amazing' realm.  Suddenly you have this 'teenage love story' that turned in to a supernatural war with this ridiculously old vampire governing body on one side and a brand new werewolf pack and the Cullens on the other.  Instead, we get a complete dispersal of any and all hostility and the story ends.  Fuck off, Meyer.
---
I wasn't FCing that fleet, friend. I was just a happy member that didn't have to burn 50 jumps home lol. Good to know that the only reason is because every so often you warp into cyno being lit with Titans coming in with full-on lances aimed at your face.
---
It's not "unjustly" that they're being called out for harboring botters, several of the alliances on the pie chart of doom were Goon renters.
---
Get your facts straight next time.
---
You said you wanted a challenge but you left one N+1 nulblob for another N+1 nullblob. Why not try for a smaller group like Fweddit, NSH, Rote Kapelle, or Pinecone?
---
These are all good points. I would add that for a time the rp scene seemed to canabalize itself during the Tony G era. This most recent set of expansions though especially with Citadels and various forms of highsec pve content have sort of revitalized a kind of world building that synergizes well with rp. We have been seeing some serious (well for us small fry) moves being made in our slice of the pond.
---
Are you a PVP Corp?
---
You can bet on that!
---
To my knowledge, yes. There have been times when I have had a perfectly capable fleet totally ready to engage an enemy that we would've traded evenly in while most likely winning an objective and was asked to stand down entirely.
---
There was also a time when we weren't "officially" forming for a fleet, but a friend and I had gathered some friends and decided to go contest what they were doing. We were greeting by coordinators joining our command channel telling us to "Get your fucking fleet out of there."
---
The primary strategy that I noticed within GSF was that if you can't win you don't fight. I never really like that strategy especially when we constantly assaulted our enemies with "Why won't you undock?" in local as we outnumbered them massively.
---
I am not a krab. And the krab life is not my life. I haven't played long enough to think a Titan is in my wheelhouse. I'd probably lose it to a bait cyno beacon.
---
So why don't you concentrate on where the problem is greatest, i.e. NCPL renters, instead of continuing this retarded campaign against Goons?
---
That's right, it's because this isn't really about botting at all is it.  It's about you having an extremely unhealthy dislike of a group of people in a video game.
---
Not sure, dude. This all started when the members of Goonswarm constantly attacked me in local chat, causing my reaction and escalation. :L
---
why do LP Citadels have 3?
---
Always loved your fleets! And i wish you the best in eve! Everyone switches paths in eve somehow or sometime &lt;3
---
Plex price? it could stand to go up another mil per plex. SP farms? hate those fuckers, they let the price drift up when plex goes up and if plex goes down they hold their stocks so that the price doesn't drift back down.
---
Why did you try to steal money from the Australian goon sig that was trying to support you and give you a place to fc?
---
You forgot to replicate with a different ISP
---
I don't see NC. as a N+1 nullblob when compared to GSF. Compared to other groups, absolutely. Consider we have 1/10th the membership of Goons, a fact that is very well known among New Eden's residence. Initially, I was going to create my own smaller group but decided to scale down rather than jump down to immediately being in the smallest group I've ever been in.
---
They're not the biggest slice of the pie chart of doom, so why isn't the focus on the others? 
---
I think we know why.  So stop lying.
---
Don't threaten me with a good time.
---
CCP spent no money on dust Sony did
---
No I don't. I've seen it. They've done that shit before. In bombers. In dominion sov. Unless I'm thinking of a different group, but I don't think so.
---
If that's their idea of fun gameplay more power to them.
---
Eve classic. - sigh - I would so jump on that band wagon.
---
If they had released Valkyrie on PC with no trendy VR crap, it'd probably still exist. I was excited about it until they said it was VR only.
---
Let's be real we are Eve players we don't have SOs. Our SO is the computer, keyboard, and mouse
---
xD
---
Actually as someone who is a bit higher up in TEST and has seen some of the inner workings I dare to respectfully disagree.
---
We go to great extent to purge bots. We caught a Nyx ratter recently and went to great lengths to confirm he is one.
---
Also we had lengthy talks with AoM in terms of botting. Their leadership is serious about it and will purge them.
---
Now on a personal level there will be bots ofc.
---
But I don’t think there will be more bots than any of the Null alliances, hell even skillu have botters
---
I didn't try to steal money from anyone. Chiimera had paid me for the first month that I was leading the squad and I took payment for the months he missed. I don't have the logs from the conversation with Brodog but I actually gave him more assets than he initially requested. Pretty shitty thievery if you ask me lol.
---
Right, I'm not comparing NC's size relative to GSF, I'm asking why you switched flavors of kool aid when there are actual small to mid sized groups that punch up rather than down, based on your claim of looking for a challenge. Going to NC is not a challenge unless you plan on fighting the Imperium for the rest of your EVE days.
---
that's some controversial thing to say for a goon...
---
Thanks, man. Appreciate the kind words.
---
I guess I feel disadvantaged more so then I feel I need to compete. I am not currently active but I used to Rat and make a lot of capitals for my alliance. Ratting I would run 2 carriers while my 3rd account would sit on my ESS. If I was running SP farms you bet I would have had scouts in the neighboring systems. 
---
Manufacturing having access to unlimited build slots kind of speaks for itself. I made a sotiyo at one point and I certainly ran out of slots and even denied some capital orders. Also I generally would scout on one account and cyno and on the other for my JF again being able to just log in an extra web/scout/cyno or even leave a cyno pilot in all my frequented systems would be just be super convenient. SP farms would also open up getting another JF/jf pilot to reduce the amount of trips I take.
---
just out of interest how do you prove you never botted, lets say your ship gets teleported and you are accused of botting, what can u fucking do? nothing...
---
Skill farms are fine because multi-boxing is crucial and the game blows without it and there is no reason anyone should have to pay 200+/month for a game's sub. There is a very significant trade-off in place; you choose whether you want to train or whether you want to pay and that balances it out.
---
What isn't fine is that skill farms enable scalable farming at an industrial level (Rorquals, botting and similar) with almost no diminishing returns. So instead of addressing skill farms, simply addressing stupid levels of scaling would be a great start to deflate plex in a fair way that doesn't hurt the legitimate multi-boxing crowd.
---
I'll agree it feels like a semi-lateral move. It's mostly the culture and that I may not actually be ready for a challenge of that magnitude. Right now, I'm being challenged to FC doctrines I've never led before and fight a defensive war when all of my campaigns have been offensive.

Pairs well with salty stir-fry from the Wicked Creek region. The taste clashes with Esoterian dinosaur meat, especially when braised.

Can someone tell me how I can donate ships to aid his awareness of the issue.

This is a quote from Stephanie Meyer: “Several girls wanted to know if Edward would have a more difficult time being around Bella when she’s having her period. Answer: Yes, a little bit, but he would never say anything about it – much too much of a gentleman. And Bella would be way to embarrassed to ask. (It’s not the same as a cut, though. It’s sort of "dead" blood, if you get my meaning).”

All of that just reads as "other people doing this makes my accomplishments smaller, and while I could do the same thing they are doing, I would rather they just stopped so my accomplishment won't be comparatively small anymore."
---
I'm ok with plex prices. They're at a price I'd actually be motivated to purchase plex with irl isk.
---
I'm ok with SP farms. Previous to SP farms people would train and sell characters on the character bazaar. It's just a longer term proposition.
---
The existence of injectors in general is a problem though. I feel like there should be a harder cap on injectors (like 7mil SP or something then you get nothing). That would allow a new player to take advantage of it but older players would still have to spend time to train into caps.

You sound like you're the one suffering from this disease mate. All I do is whaling in Delve, arguing for game balance, and arguing against bots. Goon leadership is the one painting me as their conspirator arch enemy.

Keep trying, champ. Just down vote the facts away...
---
Specifically not being able to fly doctrines that were more skill-based than F1 monkey smashing. Also, every time I tried to branch out and do my own thing someone higher than me would try to shit on me for it. It got really exhausting.

---
So, you've gotten some answers about being "helpful" without being on fleets.....you can also be helpful-focused on fleets or fleet activities.
---
Logistics ships (there's a name overload here with space trucking) are about repairing the other ships in the fleet.  It's vaguely like being a healer in other MMOs.
---
Exploration - find wormholes and other interesting things for your friends to use to surprise people far away.
---
Spying - Someone has to figure out where the bad guys are and what they are doing.  This can be as simple as parking a cloaked ship near their space station and reporting what you see to as complex as a long-term deep-cover alt in their alliance hierarchy.
---
And this doesn't get into any of the metagaming, which doesn't involve ships at all.
---
As for your actual question:
---
&gt;If I upgrade the Science attribute, will I be able to be more of a support-oriented player for my allies?
---
It isn't an attribute.  It's a skill.  Skills form a gigantic and complex tree in the game, and you need a particular level of a skill (1-5) to do something.
---
For a simple example, Drones level 1 lets you fly one drone.  Drones level 5 lets you fly five drones.
---
Science primarily exists as a prerequisite for other skills.  So depending on what you end up doing, you'll level it up in order to get the other skills you need.  But you should start to figure out that destination before leveling it  up - if you end up being a space trucker and miner than it's not helpful.
---
hokay dude  
---
i guess if you transfer your keepstars losing your sov doesn't count
---
TL;DR: Grr goons, goons bad, goons bot, grr grr grr.
---
You cared enough to tell everyone you dont care
---
I don't really care what people accomplish. My issue is that there is no reason not to have SP farms once you get to certain point, no drawback or cost associated with them. As more and more people realize this it will become more of a problem as plex supply will continue to not meet demand and will keep inflating making ISK even more trivial than it already is.
---
I know, I'm not a very good artist but I like it
---
Ooooohhhhh man you must be new around here.

If you dock at any station there's a button that says board my Corvette. Using this will give you a rookie ship with a turret on it.

---
i glossed over a lot of details because otherwise people won't even try.
---
headed to J5A right now

if you aren't skill farming on slot 2 and 3 on your account then you are really missing out.

Can someone eli5- how do skill farms affect Plex price?
---
Please don't give me a thesis. Would appreciate a a basic explanation.
---
Yee
---
Ushra Khan role plays. Everyone thinks they're kinda cute.
---
why do you think goons started a rental scheme at the same time they started a campaign against NC's rental scheme, weeks before an invasion of NC space?
---
you need plex/mtc to skill on multiple characters on the one account
---
&gt;Upwells have no clone swap timers
---
All stations have no timer if you are changing to a clone in that station.  The timer only kicks in if the clone is in a different station.
---
You are missing the Slot 6 NN-60X Speed Implants as Snake Omega replacements.  
---
There is also a Slot 6 implant for Local Armor Rep, however it boosts rep cycle time, not rep amount so it might not be worth including.
---

Cry bot and let slip the input broadcasting of Mar5hy and his mouth piece Olmeca.

Yes - you cannot eject if you are lighting a cyno beacon.
---
This particular wormhole was very large, max range dscan barely covered any of it, and we were out in deep space. It's a miracle we even ran into each other, really!
---
Each farm character that wouldn't otherwise be subbed adds demand for 500(or 450 for MCT) more plex each month. This extra demand causes the plex price to go up which cause the farms to just the sell the injectors for more. Most players that buy injectors are buying plex with cash to get them anyway so prices will always be closely linked.
---
rest in pieces, space pinata
---
The only person I seem to have seen talk about you, is you.  Why is that?
---
I'm consious of this, but as the "grade" Implants are very similar treated in my sheet, it was easier to copy+paste and adjust. For hardwirings i first want to spend time thinking of combinations that make sense to add which will take a bit of time

There's idiots everywhere, dude. Generalising one person to "the EVE Online playerbase" is childish.
---
&gt;I feel like I'm actually a pretty competent leader
---
One of the fun parts of leadership is this tends to be a self-fulfilling thing. Confidence is half the battle.
---
I've explained it in other comments, but it's an actual FC team. We have people that work together to achieve the goal. An instance of this was during the fight at SH1. Initially, Bob was going to anchor and I was going to call targets for him while another FC managed the HAW dreads. Because of his disconnection, I took over anchoring and target calling (what I consider being "FC" is doing either of these roles).
---
There have been other fleets where I anchored, but I think it was just the one where we lost a handful of Scimis and then pestered CAISH's Harpy fleet. And I initiated the hunting of some Rorquals in Delve last week that led to their demise. This fleet last night Bob just told me to either fly this free Lachesis or be an F1 monkey. I had no role other than being a member.
---
best advice take fleets out welp them and learn from your mistakes
---
The issue is that Goons are pretending as though you're totally innocent when you're not. HTFU
---
Just something else to ignore. It is cool to be able to see all the groups that have decced you in one place without having to click a dozen times.
---
I have to be physically present at the station though?
---
I think you can deliver to remotely. you certainly need assets in the station (must be ships to show up)
---
No one cares; fuck off
---
Except that's not what you said. You've only talked about being "disadvantaged" or being "unable to compete," giving a long, unsolicited, rambling list of things you used to do and how people using skill farm can do it better than you did.
---
I think your original posts were much closer to the truth of why this bothers you then this comment is.
---
They shot the raitaru to death?
---
You're the most incredible liar.
---
If you're in Goons, join more fleets or turn on jabber.

If you're not in Goons, you probably don't know who I am or why this thread exists, and that's fine. You'd be one of the ones I said wouldn't care.

A lot of my content has been getting downvoted lately, but I just assume that's Reddit not liking/being interested in it, especially WRT the CSM interviews.
---
Upvote
---
Points for trying. I could see someone arguing "but what if they just want us to *think* we can't stay?"
---
Well the ban reason wasn't botting and he didn't bot so...?
---
Well, Goons are innocent.  They're not even on the graph.  Goon renters, who aren't Goons btw, aren't innocent.  That much was clear.   Goon renters aren't even the top botting alliance.  
---
It's pretty obvious that this is more about Goon envy than Goon botting.
---
Yes. This behavior has become the default/norm for any online game that has a free option. 
---
Though, to be fair, it was the default/norm in Eve before they added that option.
---
Don't be a coward, press send.
---
You say a lot and do very little.
---
I'm sure AOM pay 500b a month to TEST with their newbie income...
---
Answered concisely, thank you.  For the record, I'm not a goon.
---
Not even a knowledgeable player.  Just one of those one's that often confused by the grandstanding and self importance found in this sub.  Even if it does make the game a little more amusing.
---
it's also the main drive of plex prices going up. thousands of sp farms chars that never undock consume plex for injectors and ppl who play for fun and barely afford to plex due to limited game time are leaving the game. gg. lets all plex farm.
---
They literally paid you a few hundred billion a month and then you evicted them because "they didn't pay".
---
Additionally, after you board the Corvette, right click and exit it again. Right click and repackage it. Right click and destroy the repackage ship. Then click board my Corvette again. You can now remove the mining laser from the new Corvette and add the turret from the old one.
---
By that logic, PanFam is innocent as well, because it's PanFam renters doing the botting and not PanFam itself.
---
Strange, it has never happened before.
---
Fucking brilliant.
---
Should get 500m just for the answer
---
Unfortunately the eve droid app wont send due to connection errors.
---
Don’t forget about egos.
---
This was stupid and you should feel as such.
---
This is a single real Eve Online player yes. Not everyone is this toxic though.
---
Mind sharing the story that brought you such high-quality tears?
---
It'll be really hard to balance because of the meta some stuff will be more valuable cause it goes into the right ships / mods. 
---
The other thing is that it opens up the game even further to manipulation and speculation which in turn will make everything more expensive. Fine for some, gamebreaking for others.
---
Well first I would hope the balance it better than the drones. The rorq shouldnt mine 2 to 3 times a hulk.. Hulks should have highest yield simple as that. The only thing the drones bring is emergent boosh theft game play.. Which is cool but why does the rorq cost 5-10b anyways.  Its not worth that much in my eyes. Panic is the only reason they SHOULD be that expencive.. But that isnt even hard to get really.
---
Currently you can assign drones to individual rocks making your potential afk time much greater. As your yield per rock is like what 1k m3? I also believe it should come with an adjustment to its ore hold. I would like to see that space used for fleet hanger to some extent instead. Yes its just moving some rocks around but its inputs you need to be there to do.  With its current ore bay its can afk basicly forever.
---
Beyond this im not sure how we can make the rorq mine without it being the best.. Because the problem is it is the best of the best of the best there is literally no reason to mine in anything else..  I also think they should only be able to have ONE sieged on grid. But I realize the pain in the ass this provides so its extremely unrealistic to se it implemented.
---
How else can we make the rorqual balanced keep nerfing panic and yield? .. Dosent deal with the infinite afk issue.. 
---
VNI afk isnt as big an issue simply because they dont make anywhere near as much but its also a seperate issue VNIs and Gilas are dumbass strong. Like what other cruiser gets 700 dps easy and super afk.. I just get the feeling CCP dosent see the forest for the trees.
---
To sum up the rorq shouldnt be the best at everything.. Like it currently is. It should be fleet booster and logi type support for the fleet. Maybe get a bit of mining done cuz boosters dont get paid. But point there is BIT of mining.. Not 3 fucking times a hulk.. If not more.
---
Man that boat turned around in 1 comment HAHA!
---
Oh I see.  This isn't really about "personal growth", it's about your being butthurt about demotion for being a bit of a prick.
---
Glad that's clear.
---
Did they get removed? I thought there was considerable regional variation in moon mineral distribution.
---
Also exactly what benefit do you think that this brings to the game? Surpluses are traded via hisec, so regional moon minerals just mean that 0.0 players have to import from each other.
---
It sounds to me like other people thought you were a bit of a jerk.
---
In fact they didn’t pay we even evicted them earlier from Feyth just because they paid their past rent doesn’t meant they won’t get evicted when they don’t pay the current one :D
---
The right answer is to create specific resource scarcity, and for the resources that fulfill that scarcity to migrate slowly.
---
Love the downvotes guys. Just reaffirms my opinion.
---
As long as the people who are responsible for the alliance don't promote it, it's fine. It is the responsibility of CCP to ban the botters.
---
No, most of EVE's playerbase don't use that app
---
Dude, not gonna lie, the other comments also helped me a lot, but this one REALLY sparked my interest. Specially the spying part. I mean, I heard about some great feats on EVE that were made possible by a very good spy, but I didn't know if it was just gibberish to make you join the game! Definitelly gonna consider that, as soon as I have a little bit more XP in how the game works overall and such.
---
Thank u guys for the help, already loving this community &lt;3
---
Free PI...  Geez, I do 50 planets at the moment (just 4 accts not farms).  PI costs at least one human soul per acct.
---
Even industry takes time and spreadsheets which makes it far from free.
---
I am be more enamoured with people who have one serious account for lots of fun play (PVP, PVE, PVSpreadsheets, whatever) rather than 10s or 100s of toons that require zombie-like mgmt.
---
Yes, except Goons don't need renters for income.  They rented out PB, for example, to take renters from others to stop their income.
---
never get used to it
---
Redline, I agree that you're a competent leader and a very good FC.  Good times on NPSI fleets.
---
I'm starting to see why
---
Get used to players using bots and violating the EULA? I refuse to accept this.
---
&gt;&gt;  I was tired of people treating me like I wasn't worth a damn because I valued fights over structure bashing &lt;&lt;
---
And this is exactly the problem in that case. We were given a task by the alliance leadership. But in place of doing the work that included structure bashing and some sov warfare you decided your own needs were more important than the alliance. 
---
IMHO why it didn't work out with you in GSF is that you don't play well with others and don't want to do the work that's needed so that we all can have nice things ;)
---
zkillboard won't touch killmails. They're just a repository of killmails. If CCP doesn't want it to work like this, it'd be up to them to change the way the killmails work. I'm pretty sure this guy, at least in part, is doing this out of revenge because a few people specifically went after his board. 
---
I do agree with you that it's unfortunate. It would make me frustrated if someone did that to me because my killboard helps me remember all the fun fleets I've been on (I tend to die on most of them, and I fly logi/links/sabre so I rarely have any green anyway).
---
Try repackaging your capsule

You don't make isk on skill farms atm

---
The point was more you're not paying to plex or sub them. Also there's plenty of value in unoptimized PI with long cycles/silos especially if you have a ton of free accounts.
---
Though I actually didn't decide that my needs were more important than the alliance's. I did the work and would've continued to do it. Just because I would've RATHER done something else and was vocal about it didn't mean that I was prepared to stop doing it. The things I wanted, more than most, was to be useful to the alliance. I also wanted to make sure the dudes were having fun since no one else was doing anything with them.
---
Thanks, man. I appreciate it.
---
Higher plex prices are fine because if you buy up plex it'll keep going up, and once it's sufficiently high you can sell it for a profit. It also is enticing for people who buy plex from ccp, and of course ccp wants to keep their paying customers happy. In fact, the only people that would ever complain about high plex prices are the ones that didn't invest in plex and currently rely on plexing each month. Sucks to be those people I guess
---
Yes, one player represents the entire EVE community.
---
Or, and this is just a suggestion, put both mining lasers on the new Corvette ...!

how have i been in gsf for only 4 months and can see that it is far more layered than that very surface level of sig fc's/leadership you are describing and all the opportunities you have stated you're seeking are actually there if you are willing to look outside the entry level nonsense?
---
I know right, its sad
---
Some people might have. I'd hope that most thought I wasn't given how many people showed up on my fleets day in and day out for more than just PAPs. But I've learned recently that people that I thought were my friends may not have been.
---
You are incorrect. This, specifically, is about making sure that people know the real things that happend and not just what they're being told by other FCs and GSF leadership.
---
But Goons don't care about KBs?
---
o7, just another shitposter having a fun time.
---
To add on to this, have you tried it with other programs not running? There could be some sort of interaction between like mumble or discord or chrome or whatever the fuck and eve causing a problem. Like, does it happen when it's JUST eve running? If no, then you could add one program at a time to try to find out the problem.
---
Not for lack of trying (at least in GSF). But now I'm waiting for the smoke to settle on what my new schedule is going to look like for work. I'll see you soon, Harley.

Fortnite ship skins
---
Your comment is exactly what is right with this idea. If the metal shifts and a material that was previously not valued becomes valuable, this will become a driver of conflict. It will force organizations that previously had no reason to talk, fight, or negotiate, to do so.
---
See, when everything is spread out fairly evenly, each group basically shoes who its friends and enemies are. But what happens when your allies, who previously supplied you with everything you need for your main line flea, are suddenly worthless from a trade perspective? Or their space becomes more valuable than yours, and soon your previously Equitable partnership starts feeling lopsided?
---
You renegotiate. You backstab. You fight. You got inventive with your fittings and resources. You start a trade War. You find and make new friends.
---
In other words, you create content.
---
So yeah, bring it on. It doesn't have to be completely balanced, it doesn't have to be completely Fair. Because that feeling of imbalance, that feeling like someone out there deserves more than they're getting, is what drives conflict. And conflict is what drives Eve online.
---
Holy shit this is hilarious.
---
As much as technetium moons were a valuable thing to fight over, the rebalance of moon materials and their scattering across the galaxy was done to prevent any bottlenecks that bad from ever developing again. I don't think CCP will ever walk that back at all unfortunately.
---
I think a lot of capsuleers get the wrong idea. Just because we brought them to pitos they didn't ask for, and just because their ship blew up, doesn't mean there is any hostility here. We are just simple delivery agents serving our customers the only way we know how.
---

Takes money to make money. Eve is a phenomenal, well developed game, and though I’ve been involved since 2005, I won’t pretend to have the solutions to accomplish the above goal. I do think, though, that the community as a whole is capable of this. And I’d bet the above million on it.
---
Entosis ops are even better; FC will let be bring my Drake!
---
i added a few sensible combinations now, can you tell me about morei i may have not covered?
---
The pink Power Ranger from the original episodes is my favorite because she was :fire_emoji:
---
I have questions...
---
HI!
---
Injectors can only exist if players are extracting, it's just part of the economy. You can argue that maybe they shouldn't exist but I think if they are going to exist I can't imagine a better way to do it. I haven't gone through the numbers recently but the market actually does a pretty good job of flattening things out
---
&gt; Have you seen our killboard? We take alot more fights than we don't.
---
This means absolutely nothing.
---
&gt; Our killboard tells a story of taking more fights than your group does. That is all...we truly don't care about our killboard in favor of the endgoal of dominating you entirely. This game, you have to agree, is a testbed for various types of military and industry strategy. We're clearly winning regardless of the political drivel you guys attempt on reddit. It may take us a minute because we're a majority of F1 button smashers but we'll get it in the end.
---
Cringe
---
yes, a vni can be fit to carry 2000 m3 (with room to spare)
---
Market should flood with ospreys now. Let’s pump those numbers up!
---
Take the cyno!
---
STOP! YOU VIOLATED THE LAW! PAY THE COURT A FINE OR SERVE YOUR SENTENCE, YOUR STOLEN GOODS ARE NOW FORFEIT.﻿
---
And how will that solve your issue? you've just edited the price and stuck for 30 minutes, the competitor edits and he is below your price for 30 minutes.
---
I see.... But I am having this strange feeling of... Low-security around you guys :D
---
Its not about the killboard its the derpy circumstances.
---
&gt; NC has always been the cancer that is killing Eve. Their elitist playstyle pushes an elitist agenda of "hell dunks or blue balls". Now most of them are playing PUBG, or whatever, because they can't be the bully on the block because Goons are.
---
What is the "elitist agenda" (LMFAO) and "elitist playstyle?"
---
Hmm...
---
Honestly just find a new corp. Why bother making a reddit post about it?
---
https://secure.eveonline.com/Activation/
---
Nice try Hilmar, posting from a new account, we see right through your sham.
---
From a DEV perspective it’s really hard to accept the fact that you are a master of how it should run and the end user is the true expert at how it really work.
---
TIL. also TIL that towers give killmails if you launch them without anchoring i guess?
---
Whose complaining?  We're celebrating.
---
LoL, Init deployed to Hak against both NC and PL, we faced the supers and didn't complain about it :D , infact in some cases we faced Hord,PL and NC....
---
It was broken as fuck. Not saying it is that great today. Plenty of stuff to overhaul, ccps needs to be faster and more rigorous
---
The fucking logic.
---
Except that that won't happen. Diplomacy will make sure of that. 
---
The groups that bring something to table will make a deal and all the little guys get fucked over. Just look at what happend to the perimeter keepstar and the content that was there. All dried up cause diplomacy.
---
CCP would have to actually place stuff on the map instead of doing it randomly. And favour smaller groups with the good stuff at the risk of them losing all their shit when a bigger groups decides they want their stuff. 
---
And if they make it so that you need something from all 4 corners we can pretty much put a halt on whatever construction requires the recourses that were spread out. Alliance stockpiles would probably keep us going longer. 
---
Legacy has no option of "backstabbing" us as they can't take us and I doubt they'd want to end up in bed with panfam again. 
---
So we'd be good for everything spawning from deklein (Sort really doesn't want to deal with us again) to immensea.
---
I get why it sounds appealing but I think it would put us in an even better position than we already are. 
---
And if it's moon goo you want to redistribute the people in high sec who depend on mission running / mining won't be able to pay for ships anymore. 
---
Obviously I can't predict what'll happen but looking at the history I don't think it's a good idea.
---
To be fair Paedron Niall was a cunt in the books too, this guy is just accurately depicting him for the video game adaptation.
---
lol what a cunt
---
Triglavians invade our space... We invade theirs.
---
At least you got the chromosome count right.
---
We only have one side of this story, so no, it's not about that is it.
---
Other than making the game completely free, as previously noted, I don't think one year is a reasonable goal for this.
---
Unironically, I think if CCP had really pursued walking in stations gameplay there would be a very real chance for significantly higher numbers in the game. You would attract additional player personas who are slightly less interested in blowing up spaceships directly, but still interested in the interpersonal intrigue and market dynamics of Eve online.
---
With walking in stations gameplay, you could credibly create and release a mobile version of the game that would never have performance problems if you limited it exclusively to station gameplay. That would open you up to the entire Global Market. You could potentially feasibly release a console client as well.
---
I think people look back at walking in stations or Dust 514 as some kind of mistake, when in reality people need to accept that a subscription-based highly technical sci-fi MMORPG with constant PVP is it extremely Niche game. The idea of adding entirely different gameplay mechanics that would feed into, and expand, the Eve online experience in a shared universe, is a very smart one. It still bothers me to this day how poorly both of these were managed, but even more so how poorly the community received them.
---
The way I see it you have 3 ways of paying for the game: 
---
Skill Farms: trade SP for plex, use plex; character doesnt advance, no doing PVE and no cash spent
---
Plex: trade ISK for PLEX, use plex; keep skills &amp; cash, spend time doing PVE
---
Cash: trade cash for game time; keep skills and avoid PVE, spend RL $$
---
Two of those activities consume plex, and the other really has no impact on the plex market. So if you have more skill farms, that should result in higher plex prices and lower injector prices. If you have more PVEers that would also increase the price of plex. 
---
I think the only thing that can really bring the price of plex down is a sale on plex
---
The other side of the story is in various threads and comments on reddit and in audio/video recordings that you are more than welcome to find for yourself. I only made this thread for those who knew that side of the story to come to know mine.
---
You're welcome to find another thread to populate with your comments if this one is not relevant to you.
---
Not one single thing in that list would increase the player base.  The "problem" is more to do with the complexity of the game and how hard it is to learn.  Absolutely \*\*\*\* all to do with medium ac.
---
Please, I'm already poor as fuck.
---
"Every nullsec alliance" didn't rack up as many botting bans in a short amount of time like FRT did.
---
I guess the blacklist was too scary.
---
Slither on duder.
---
Roll back to 2009
---
Hire back Soundwave
---
Fire Fozzie and Falcon
---
To be fair, that could just be someone else actually trading as well. When I'm trading I'll babysit my orders as well, especially on high-profit items.
---
I'm confused why you don't have all 6^4 cases for each implant set. Why assume I'm going to have a Alpha implant if I also have a Beta?
---
If you've got to eliminate one case just out of common sense, drop the "only have omega implant" cases.
---
Stating truth isn't trolling.  Every imaginable solution has been suggested, petitioned, lobbied, argued at round tables, rallied for by CSM, and ignored by CCP.
---
If you want to just roleplay outraged housewife on the forums, go nuts - but "Get used to it or move on" is the realist answer.
---
&gt; The farms respond by just selling the injectors for more
---
that's not how economics works. Theoretically more farms should drive injector prices down. I have been hearing that skill farms don't pay out as well anymore which would seem to be evidence that is happening. TBH i havent actually looked at the data
---
Not as many, you're not denying that there was botting.
---
I checked and point conceded. The aim was to take renters away from NC. doesn't look like that was successful. Perhaps blowing up their stuff and camping their space didn't endear us as future landlords lol.
---
I have had a similar issue, but only in 1 of my 4  accounts (also recently my main is acting in a similar manner), my computer completely freezes, I can't open the task manager to finish the program, but I can switch between programs, when the task manager is open I can't force the close, when I try to restart or power off my laptop it freezes on a black screen with the loading mouse icon and I can't move it, so I have to force the shutdown. Plz help.
---
why buy off them when you can just buy plex off ccp, hope you dont get banned for it buddy
---
I only like Dragon Ball. So I guess Team 20 then.
---
My dude, Bob got Redline, but I’m adamant about bringing you aboard though. Come hang
---
So it didn't work and he decided to just pop his own structure?
---
Considering I was on my way out the door with no intention of coming back, I couldn't have cared less. I just didn't want shitheads going around saying I was a thief.
---
Open 10+ more alts
---
Yeah if It’s outside of Jita it’s bots. If its in Jita, it’s definitely just saturated.
---
1 button press vs opening an app, sometimes it's just easier.
---
Love this, thank you !
---
Wow thats genius.
---
But anybody who wants to hunt you knows you have to go to the poco at some point. People must not be willing to hunt for people donig PI that much. And there is no risk for anything when a system is empty. All you are asking for is less risk. The fist thing i can think of is lowering the of m3 on a POCO so you would have to go to it more often.
---
Honestly that doesn't sound that bad
---
I'd add two ship skin customizations:
---
1. Cat ears
---
2. Space dicks
---
Boom! 50k
---
I swear, every single change ever proposed is immediately countered with the idea that it would benefit goons the most. Is there any goddamn idea that doesn't theoretically benefit goons the most?
---
My advice would be start up the agency finder and find the nearest career agents - These Agents will provide you ships, and their initial missions can be done easily in a corvette. You will receive a free ship and standings bonus with your faction on completing each Career Agent mission chain
---
Isn't that the purpose of user stories ?
---
Just keep the same path they going! Bot count will reach that level by a years time.
---
If you build it they will come!
---
Can't speak for *Twilight* but it's not a new idea; it was done in one of the earlier Anne Rice books. Somewhere between *Interview with the Vampire* and *Queen of the Damned* I think.
---
Lmao so salty you’re linking another alliances loss mail to try to prove a point.
---
Suicide is no laughing matter sir. What that person said is inexcusable
---
Hello!
---
I’m role playing that I’m aiming my autocannons at your post.
---
You don't have to be in Jita to modify a order.
---
5x med neut curse beats a badly fit iki
---
color me surprised
---
BroSnake sends his regards
---
May not be botting.
---
No but al lot of those things lead us to leaking players.
---
Easy.
---
Allow bots and broadcasting.
---
Better chance when you edit that undercutters will have to wait longer. I thought that was obvious.
---
It's what killed the whole fun of this event for me. I hoped a nice brawl would ensue everyone fighting each other and the dread. But it ended up just PL killing everyone they saw. And when they got notice that a force was heading their way (a wormhole coalition) that could do something. They quickly blew up the dread to claim the plex.
---
Release EVE 2 so "legacy code" is no longer an impediment. Focusing on user stories from a variety of positions that sandbox players implemented and have them be actual pillars of the game design from the get-go instead of a happy little accident. Take "Content creation" (pvp) and ensure EVERY expansion does something to provide more "content" - Complete update and rework the entire PVE experience. It needs to be completely thrown out and started over from scratch in my opinion. EVE PVE is embarrassing for a modern game.
---
Going to pedantic with a correction, but this **is** /r/Eve...
---
Black Ops can't warp cloaked. You might be thinking of the Combat Recon ships that specifically do not show up on DScan.
---
Dust was an awesome idea. 
---
Ruined by the fact most Eve players couldnt play it.
---
any chances goons get smacked in a face by panfam? tbh i don't like both parties but first one is just disgusting.
---
Oops, yeah that's the one!
---
10/10 funny. I pissed myself laughing at this.
---
idk I use lightshot. Once I tried it, nothing even compares, not even sharex. Try it.
---
Here's some truth... it's far worse now than ever before.  So shouldn't that make a difference? It's much better than you're refusal to do anything which is ignorant and obsurd.
---
Are you a spy? and for which side please XD
---
I mean like anything like this your milage may vary. I would argue though that EVE is one of the few MMORPGs where the medium does suit roleplaying. Most are designed in the theme park WOW way wherein everyone is the main character and the storyline is a set construct. In EVE you are just one capsuleer of tens of thousands and what you choose to do with your story is about as free as it gets. In addition I would point out that there are numerous instances of player actions being enshrined not just in the player lore but as actual canon incidents.
---
It’s not cheating until you make your ship name “8=====D”
---
low sec gate to stain
---
New player focus. Gonna piss off all the vets but...face it. Newbros dont wanna play the game. Things need to be implemented for new players.
---
4^6 cases irc. =/- for awkward sets such as ascendacy
---
i covered what i felt would allow for a even spread of % gains
---
whelping capitals is a *capital sink*, not an *isk sink*
---
in fackchually, capital losses *inject* isk into the economy through *insurance*
---
people will never get tired of mistaking ship losses for isk sinks and i will never get tired of correcting them, but ccfuckingpls include that shit in the tutorial already
---
Nah. This was quite obvious.
---
Their flow will align to ours
---
Upvote!
---
This thread / line of questioning should become canon lore.
---
Just keep redefining winning as the circumstances change, and you can't ever lose!
---
this is the caliber of intellect that plays the market
---
/u/hignenaaaaa for CSM?
---
Anything not done randomly or universe wide? 
---
It's basically malcanis law for alliances. 
---
CCP would basically have to balance against whoever is on top.
---
In our case that would be nerfing anom respawns to such a degree that we'd actually have to populate fountain. 
---
Eve is incredibly hard to balance against human instinct. We just naturally try to get a leg up without conflict if possible.
---
I've thought and talked a lot about changes to Eve to increase fights and it's really hard to come up with things that can't be made irrelevant through diplomacy. 
---
Just look at things like OTEC and b0tlord.
---
So the question really is whether CCP should be favour the underdog.
---
No u are quite obvious.
---
&gt; It will take months for your industry to recover
---
We don't have any industry remember? We've spent the last X years belittling industrialists and that's why we are in the position we are. It takes zero time to recover something that apparently never existed.
---
Introduce a mechanic that randomly logs on people from server-side, then logs them off after a minute. If they are docked, they stay docked. If they are in space, they appear in space.
---
Blame the triglavians because lore is good.
---
Yes.
---
I am a spy for Legacy coalition. First, I was to give them information about how Goons operated so they could copy it. Now, I am to give them information about how to defend their space from an invading party.
---
This is all true.
---
The point is Jita has hundreds of traders in it. If you place an order in an even semi popular item odds are you’re competing with three or four active people who will move one of their multiple orders to .01 isk below yours as soon as they see it. Some people even use ESI scripts to notify them when they’re undercut (this is 100% legal) and also copy a value slightly below the competitor to the clipboard, so all you have to do is open the “modify order” and click paste when you get a notification about being undercut
---
Fair enough, I suppose.
---
Yah lol, I’ve enjoyed it so far... hopefully we Will Keep on going at it.
---
There are entire games that are not as entertaining as this one thread is :-)
---
Don't be retarded. Most of Jita traders are just no lifers updating their orders every 5 minutes on the dot. 
---
You are not the first to think everyone is a bot, and you won't be the last. 
---
But bring some legitimate proof next time you come here accusing us no lifers of being bots.
---
Pretty sure our stated goals haven't changed for several years now.
---
I'm more inclined to think a bot since just about every post 1-3 hours old end up with 0 karma. Like majority of the second page of r/eve are posts with 0
---
I think walking in stations was/is the key.  Eve's skill system encouraged Eve Offline.  Large swathes of time I simple was not logged in, playing something else while skills trained.  Eventually that other game I was playing while waiting on some timer became my main game.  Hell, the corp I was in played Vanguard as a secondary game.  Which eventually became the primary game because we felt like we were actually in the same game world together.
---
I'd shoot Brodog in game if the fucker ever logged in.
---
The only problem with Dust 514, aside from the technical issues, was that it was exclusive to a certain console. If D514 had been multi-platform or even just a PC exclusive it would have had phenomenal success even to this day. I can kinda understand why it was made console exclusive, in the era of "PC is dying", but at the same time that would have been a small perceived benefit in a sea of drawbacks.
---
EVE started dying when D514 died.
---
rank them: beef, chicken, pork
---
Agreed. Source: I make excellent fits and then still feed like a noob.
---
The npc sotiyos don’t. Goons have bottled themselves up in a fairly small area despite their large influence so they still don’t get as many Sotiyos as some other alliances
---
Are you blind?
---
It's not that we "refuse to do anything", it's simply that nothing can be done.
---
I don't know, WH- was a dream fight by all appearances. I think they would have shown up to that one for the fun of the fight as opposed to any relevance of the timer. How often do you get a chance to chew up a BS fleet with haw dreads like that?
---
Cloaky dual rep legion Heavy assault missiles is what u are looking for then.
---
There will be times when Goons bring out their fleets and we beat them. At the end of the day, it's going to come down to who's willing to put more of their dick on the table until one side runs out of dick or confidence.
---
No one., calls me a pinot gringo!
---
Awesome.  So everybody is happy and is getting what they want.  High fives all around.
---
Beef, steak, burger.
---
There's no room in my life for inferior meats.
---
Problem is that goons have so many people that nobody can effectively compete. And there's really no way of limiting the number of people that can band together in a single entity to prevent content.
---
that blue gimp needs a ball gag.
---
G2A isn't on their list of authorized resellers, so I wouldn't.
---
That's unfortunate :(
---
So you mean that if this change were implemented there'd be an increase in freighter traffic throughout EVE as large alliances moved surplus materials to and from the market, creating opportunities to attack your enemy's economy by spying on them and hitting their ore convoys?
---
And this is a *bad thing*?
---
&gt;  If the metal shifts and a material that was previously not valued becomes valuable, this will become a driver of conflict. It will force organizations that previously had no reason to talk, fight, or negotiate, to do so.
---
yeah that sounds fucking awesome
---
Amazing.  
---
From the chart, seems like MG snakes + MG omega is worse than MG snakes + 605 (but still cheaper)?
---
&gt;pirate version of the Marshal
---
Ooh. Yes, take it one more step, instead of all Concord manufacturers, make a class of ship that mirrors the Concord one from each of the pirate factions
---
Yup
---
4^6 youre right.
---
I guess some of the low grade sets don't give bonuses the same way as the mid/high so you'd have to adjust the sheet depending on which set it is.
---
I just think that doing the sheet to completeness wouldn't be too much extra effort.
---
That's not even an argument. That's just a shitty attempt at a justification for why it's somehow good when Goons do it and bad when everyone else does it.
---
So basically you're saying it's okay to bot and violate the EULA because nothing can be done? Wow... and I'm blind?
---
Agreed.
---
There was an item that had a decent margin. I didn't want to sell an item to a buy order and lose a few mil each, but also didn't want to .01 someone, so I split the difference. I watched about a dozen order .01 me and for the entire day I watched the price drop.
---
Weird.
---
I know many players in this game. Played since release. Never met a market trader that updates orders every 5 minutes.
---
who's to say it didn't anchor? A small tower takes 7.5 minutes to anchor (I think it used to take 30 minutes, but its been too long for me to remember)
---
So now I can duct tape a Thorax to my Avatar? Nice!
---
Many also use bots to do that. So?
---
remember when rattlesnakes were oneshotting ppl with geckos?
---
Many also use bots to do that? That okay?
---
I've been reading Eve reddit for a couple of years and we've had anti-Goon botting posts on an almost daily basis.  Yet when evidence that Goons themselves don't even register on the banned chart causes Goons to express pleasure in that, for some reason the narrative switches.
---
Whatever the data, whatever the facts, you just have to bash Goons, regardless of whether or not Goons are the biggest offenders here (hint: they aren't).
---
Wow thanks
---
I should have specified that it was TACO meat rankings but surprisingly this is still the correct answer so good job.
---
POS require a moon to anchor.
---
any skin, goes onto any ship.
---
custom skins 1 billion isk each
---
2500 player limit on corp size
---
players can join concord and any other NPC if they meet the standings
---
dynamic "lore" wars,  instead of FW ship spinning.
---
&gt; This game, you have to agree, is a testbed for various types of military and industry strategy.
---
m8 it's a video game. Ease down turbo.
---
Lol thanks dude and I'm honoured
---
Mkay.  I'll look forwards to the great results from your extra-special and completely new take that will lead to huge and important changes.
---
I came to say Cat Ears for the toon and the ships
---
&gt; I also want to point out the junior FC did a great job under pressure
---
He literally didn't know how to broadcast targets. Why was he given the keys to Harbs for Spectre's first real chance under the spotlight?
---
I love Spectre but that was a bad look. Own it.
---
You're an idiot.
---
It's not okay to do it, and if anyone is caught doing it they should be banned, sure.
---
But there's nothing we can do to prevent it, more than we have done already.
---
Just hook Pewdiepie on it and the kids will follow.
---
I'm not even bashing Goons. I'm just trying to get you to admit that Goons aren't innocent. Which is what the Mittani said. And is wrong about.
---
Docking request accepted
---
&gt; Its questionable if it was close enough to a moon, but who knows.
---
I'm aware of how POSes work. I don't spend a lot of time in abyssal space, so maybe there are moons. I don't know.
---
Stay off 93. Signed, Medford.
---
Not medfa. Medfid, kid.
---
"No I am cheating on EVE with you."
---
It is hard to catch them since they are busy with updating their orders.
---
I refuse to believe nothing can be done. For one, letting people know who they are buying from could benefit. Secondly, disallow multiple orders of the same item at the same station from the same person or corp.
---
brodog is a lot of things, but he is probably one of the most active players I know.  
---
nice straw grasp though.
---
Goons are innocent.  They're not botting are they.  The guilty ones are renters.
---
Hilmar was misinformed -- no regional resources have been removed. The only regional resources are racial isotopes and R32s and R8s. Rat loot too, I guess, but these are largely irrelevant. These are still largely focused in the same regions they were (with a few exceptions.) True, there is a nonzero chance for any region to spawn a foreign R32 or R8, but for R8s, they're the bitch of moongoo so it doesn't matter, and for foreign R32s, the chance is so low that you'll never get enough of the thing to do anything useful.
---
Piracy
---
Introduce as many mechanics as possible for solo or small groups to attack large corporations, and for those actions to be profitable.
---
* remove null sec chat
---
* add ways for newbies to 'steal' wealth from big corporations (high risk, high reward).
---
* make it harder to gate-camp or otherwise block incursions into alliance controlled null sec.
---
* create scarcity of materials and make more available only in null sec.
---
* create low-skill, low price POS that do not appear map but can be scanned. Allow new players to set up cheap semi-permanent bases in Null Sec in empty space far outside of systems.
---
There. Now new players can feel like they are ripping off the older players and "winning", and null sec alliances can hunt/kill newbies in null sec whenever they log in. Cat and mouse piracy games for everyone!
---
I had a very similar thing for about 4 months last year. I was getting a much higher rate of disconnects and whenever they did strike it was 9/10 times when FC warped fleet.  Nothing I could do helped, I tried many similar things as those suggested in this thread.
---
It just stopped happening. I have no idea why.
---
I don’t believe there are. Even if there were, they seem to be all shattered.
---
im still going to add more reasonable/odd cases but it's not as important to me as adding more implant sets to give a complete overview.
---
i wouldn't underestimate the effort needed for 4k rows per implant )))
---
I will agree afk leadership is a big issue in gsf. Alot of dudes struggle to let go of the reins once they have them. It's one reason why once I was done, I was done and the reins where gone.
---
If you really think they’re bots, buy one item from them to get their name and report them as a bot in game
---
massive and sustained advertising + deals for new players
---
You tried to pay yourself severance for being fired... https://i.imgur.com/6QZGAZy.png
---
Not to mention that donated fort you tried running off with. Hope the blacklist was worth it, slither on.
---
True sansha large deathstar setup or GTFB2WOW
---
1. Remove the silly 3 year time wall to fly good ships. 
---
2. Add a skill system that is based on usage not time. ( use a middle launcher get middle skills) 
---
3. Add about 2000 new ship equipment items 
---
4. Make good loot randomly drop from all rats 
---
5. Add a item crafting system that allows players to use junk loot to upgrade other mods
---
6. Revamp the pve system so all content can scale for solo / small gang / fleet (want to jump a tier 5 abyss with 200? It scales up automatically) 
---
7. Re work mining to actually once in a while give you a shot of dopamine. (Think items uncovered or rare ore extracted) 
---
8. Add a huge npc war to null sec that burns stations and kills players in huge numbers (what invasion should have been) 
---
9. Add material value to the tool tip of all items so it’s easy to see easy images value to produce. 
---
10. Add 10-20 ship types with new ability’s (logi for weapon damage etc) 
---
11. Etc etc
---
There are ways to limit the effect of N + 1 but CCP can't or has not been interested in implementing them.
---
Whaaat. Was that a recent change? :o
---
Manual piloting.
---
This right here!  I wish a lot more people would understand this.  I still have old discord server for a Corp that disbanded in 2016, a few people still kicking around and on occasion chat about the good old days. One of the conversation we had a few weeks ago, basically came down to one of the guys confessing how he lurks around on eve forums/reddit/media outlets looking for a reason to come back and yet he can't find one. Really puts in to perspective the state of the game
---
I was with you up until the CSM comment
---
(Short version: people buy codes from authorized resellers, with stolen card numbers. They then sell these on G2A.)
---
yes. a bug with it's own popup and text.
---
You've jumped to a conclusion that its a bot though. Do you have any proof that isn't speculation?
---
So you are running for CSM right?
---
oof
---
I'm gay.
---
I believe that was sarcasm

Tell me about you history with 401K

###Introducing Patch: MEGA - MAKE EVE GREAT AGAIN
---
Step 1: Advertise everywhere.  Hire more people to market.  
---
&amp;nbsp;  
---
Step 2: Enhance to NPE to encompass a good 30 days of content.  
---
Step 3: Provide incentive for some players to keep characters in the new player corporations and run fleets and provide helpful answers. (Free t1 frigates and destroyers for the commander to hand out for the fleets).  
---
Step 4: Provide engaging PVE content that feels like fleet actions, has story lines and makes a player feel a part of something great and big.  
---
Step 5: Put important new assets in low sec in gravity clouds that cannot be entered by capitals and prevents a cyno from opening.  (Also, remove gate guns - they are stupid).  
---
Step 6: PUT AN IN GAME RECRUITING TOOL such as a meet and greet universal chat room, including tabs or info links for each corporation and pretty colors and direct eve mail connects to each corporations recruiter for contact. Each info tab would include basic details like population, activities in the last 72 hours and top 5 ships used, total online players in the last 72 hours and time zone they play. DIRECT NEW PLAYERS TO USE THIS OPTION.  DIRECT PEOPLE THAT HAVE LIVED IN HIGH SEC EXCLUSIVELY TO THIS OPTION.  
---
Step 7: Retention emails - offer anyone that has not played in 12 months or longer a chance to come back for 1 month of Omega for free and half priced Omega purchase for up to 3 months of Omega.  
---
Step 8: Retention advertisements - same as above, with help to recovery your account.  
---
Step 9: Hard cap some things from being injectable. Rorquals / titans / supers / capitals (all of the ship and gun/fighter skills) &amp; t3c ship and part skills.  
---
Step 10: ADD A COMBAT TIMER TO SHOOTING RATS.  Even if your a bot, 60 seconds of shooting a rat means you can't dock. (Also make combat timer prevent entry into a pos).  
---
Step 11: Reduce damage cap on structures by 10 and 5 minutes on Shield and Armor. If the previous timer was not paused for more than 5 minutes, reduce the next timer by that time - stackable.  
---
Step 12:  Change vulnerability window to 24 hours on shield every day / 12 hours on armor 24 hours later / 6 hours on hull 48 -or- 72 hours later, 48 for anything not large like a sotiyo/ks/tatara and 72 for large.  
---
&amp;nbsp;    
---
Step 13: Black Ops carriers / Bowheads to re-supply new ships after losses.  
---
Step 14: Mineral sink - introduce hull upgrades for t1 ships that increase XYZ stat by 5 % (dps / speed / hp) at double the mineral cost per stat increase (up to 3 increases at 5x the hull cost).  Make the ore a single person mines worth more by draining it from the system to help the newer player.  
---
Step 15: Solicit stories of adventure and fun from the player base in written format of NEW players less than a year and publish those stories on the forums and press them in the launcher tool. Also include them IN YOUR ADVERTISEMENTS. Get some writing talent to help here.  
---
PS - I'm not moving to Iceland, but I'd do half of the above remotely from the US.
---
Give this man the keys.
---
People who get fired get unemployment. Especially for wrongful termination.
---
If you use it like ebay, you're safe. Go for the guys who have thousands of transactions and sell for a logical price, and not for the dude that has 5 sells and sells it for 5€
---
Again, by that logic PanFam is innocent because the guilty ones are the renters, not PanFam.
---
I'm not sold on this part Red every fleet is a lesson even when you've ran feroxs or baltecs 100s of times. I always found that FCs that believe they knew everything about a doctrine and had every experience in it. That's when they became a trash tier because they refuse to learn anymore.
---
You must have huge brass balls
---
Plenty more can be done.
---
I didn't say it was good or bad. I asked the question. I could, with equally loaded language ask if you think that it's a *good thing"* that 0.0 be forced to depend on hisec.
---
Do you?
---
Do you have any examples? I'm curious to see what ways the community has come up with.
---
Make each Planet, Moon, Station a place where you can go and shoot the shit out of NPC, other players to get resources.  Imagine having something like Counter-Strike and Halo in Eve and to do it you have to live in this f*ing big space sandbox.  Imagine the numer of kids on streams doing a aliance takedown by shooting on station/space maps other players. This Game can be made to never end. You can be a veteran from the Battle of Jita from 2020 and teaching kids in 2035 how hard was the battle on the traing camps of Thera . I still can't belive how the fuck the owners still don't make this game big and with the story in tv shows/ movies.
---
Not really, no. It's nearly impossible to tell the difference between a market bot and a particularly diligent human and there's no changes to the trading system you can make that will affect bots but not humans.
---
This is true.  We joke about the learning curve but it really is steep.  If you hang out on the rookie chat (new alt for example), for about half the tutorial is too slow and they mess up by trying to guess the next step and do it too soon which locks up the tutorial.  For others it does not hold their hands long enough for them to have any idea what they are doing. 
---
I hate to say it like this but Eve needs like an apprenticeship program.  When in rookie chat you can pick up on some that almost get it but need some extra help.  I’ve fleeted up with some doing the career missions and walked them step by step in space with them scanning with screenshots to clarify confusing bits.  Guarded them doing level 1 missions or mining.  The ones I hand held have stayed playing the game and are in corps all over New Eden.
---
So suggestion is donate some time to actually befriend  a few rookies.  Talk to them.  Add as contacts and keep checking in on them for a while.  This also helps refire my love of Eve.
---
This is rather tame compared to some of what i have experienced. Yes suicide is not a joke but these are the same folks who say the “N” word incessantly among other horrible things. Most Eve players are of a higher caliber, however they are more quiet. The loudest voices are the most ignorant. You will find real life is much the same... this is the human condition.
---
Most of the leadership in the coalition is relatively inactive. That's a big difference between PanFam and Imperium. I like it that my alliance leaders are also leading fleets and fighting alongside the line members.
---
Background: I have done sales, marketing and recruiting professionally for 15 years with a history of success at the million dollar+ level and I'm not speaking out of my ass or blowing smoke up my own ass. I'm just sharing what things would in my personal opinion drive more content, drive more people to the game, keep people playing the game. Retention is as important as driving in new players. You have to keep what you catch.
---
Yes. Yes, I do. Because it makes capital and super production more vulnerable by relying on shipments of materials from long distances away. It makes it easier for alliances to wage economic warfare and fight asymmetrically. It also makes it easier to overcome overwhelming economic advantage, making large alliances such as Goons, TEST, PL, etc. weaker. 
---
It creates more content and makes the game more dynamic.
---
Here's the bottom line. Proof or not CCP if a player has half of their 20 orders undercut within a minute there's a problem.
---
Erm alot of the coalition leadership can be afk and only step in when needed. It's more within squads and SIGs I am talking
---
The only time it felt like I was learning was when I was fighting and, in operations, the fights were a rarity. You can only bash an uncontested structure one way.
---
i like this one
---
I hope someone comes to counter it and we all end up with glorious stories to tell. plus some chicken soup would be nice.
---
And wait for nothing to ever happen.
---
A lot of null corps, Eve  Uni, Brave, etc.  have free blue print programs. Maybe join one of them so you can focus on manufacturing more easily? Null corps appreciate it too.
---
And wait for nothing to ever happen
---
Make 0.01 isking impossible, instead When you modify an order make it mandatory at least 0.1% Lower or higher from the previous price.
---
would be nice if ccp fixed this for sure.
---
Is that a chameleon in the aquarium?
---
It’s a parrot and that’s his cage :D
---
Already determining activity based on killboard stats... Holy shit you were made for NC.
---
rEaD bOoK oR yU R DuMb 2019
---
Salvage is also regionalised. Neither rat salvage nor relic site salvage in Delve has (for example) Enhanced Ward Consoles, which is a required item for making Core Defense Field Extender 2s...
---
\- basically 90% of everyone here to former SO's ...at some point.
---
Miss Soundwave :(
---
go to wormholes
---
Well sir, you have bested me in Twilight knowledge.
---
This was brought up recently here
---
https://youtu.be/Kr3JwrR7GBs
---
TIL some people have never heard of a time gated expansion.
---
Considering I said I would shoot you in-game if you logged in I see no other way to show how often you log in other than how UNOFTEN you participate in in-game activities like 1) bashing structures 2) fighting enemy fleets or 3) anything within the last week.
---
Delayed local for tackle ships  INCLUDING t1 frigs. Give a real cause to have t1 frigs in the group.
---
Also fix PANIC so that it cant be chained by multiple rorquals.
---
Agreed. Even when Dust was dying it still had thousands of concurrent players. Would've been at least 5x more on PC, or multiplatform ideally.
---
Jesus if they release Nova and fuck this up  I'm gonna cry.
---
How is that going to help?
---
what changes would you make for wormhole timers
---
hint: leave it alone
---
&gt; ppl who play for fun and barely afford to plex due to limited game time are leaving the game. 
---
If you can't afford $15/month in your entertaiment budget, you *should* be setting aside games to unfuck your life.
---
You have me curious now ... what kind of agreement do they have?
---
It wouldn't work well with CCP's current shit sov/citadel mechanics though.  Whichever alliance currently holds whatever area spawns the "good shit" would be incredibly powerful and hard to remove, because current mechanics so heavily favor the defender, on top of having much more resources because of the resource balance.
---
how would it be at all different from the current jump freighter shipping?
---
I meant that the csm knows more about eve than ccp does, not the playerbase
---
What region specific resource got removed?
---
Salvage, isotopes, meta modules and some moongoo are regional.
---
Shift + C will fix it
---
I am not versed enough in wormholes to suggest changes without soliciting advice from those actually living in them.
---
Exactly! You dock up sometimes and play something else or Netflix to burn time, but if Eve had some bar simulator or gambling or hell KILLING in stations it would be the perfect between-activities activity.
---
There are market bots, but assuming you where in Jita, those might be actual players constanly refreshing their orders; it's called market PVP for a reason.
---
What? You thought you were alone there? You didn't see local?
---
A very good point. My instinct is usually to discount salvage, but you're right in that it's very much an important thing. One of the few things Delve is trash at is salvage, for instance.
---
I role play as a space anarchist fighting against voluntary Space Feudalism.
---
Awesome, it worked. Thanks! Just out of curiosity, what does Shift+C do?
---
You already know who you are buying from/selling to. 
---
Secondly, guess whether bots or players are more likely to just multi box alphas with a VM to circumvent rules restricting the quantity of orders buy that much
---
Beg developers with talent to come back and get rid of Hilmar.  If those two don't happen, any other efforts are pretty fruitless.
---
How is it obv its a bot? Only way you could even tell is log the order wait 5 mins log it again and see. But as another mentioned they could just be an avg trader that afk watches orders 
---
This is exactly what I do.. Leave the market alt up and timer for 5 mins if ive got a lot of isk in market.
---
I agree market bots are an issue but I really doubt its easy to tell in anyway.
---
You forget yourself, I was on a fleet with you just the other night, pretty sure it got stood down...
---
fix faction warfare
---
remove incursions
---
make mining low-sec good
---
add low-sec gate to stain
---
There actually are several groups that are deeply entrenched in the ongoing story. On the Amarr side you have PIE who are loyalists to the Empress. Arataka Research Consortium  (ARC) are more neutral and focused on the ongoing Emergent Threats. 
---
Both groups and others are engaged with CCP frequently. I suspect CCP wants to respect people who don't want PvE interfering with their game, so they tend to only interact with those who have demonstrated a desire to interact back.

I try my best to put EVE into context for others via streaming, podcasting and on Twitter. [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/ashterothi) [EVE Universe Podcast](https://www.talkinginstations.com/category/stream-podcast/eve-universe/) [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Ashterothi)
---
As it has been said by others, everyone is roleplaying. We are inhuman monsters disconnected from the affairs of petty baseliners. Only those who _want_ to care need to.
---
I hope this helps!
---
toggle between ''tracking camera'' and ''orbit camera''
---
Its really sad that pretty much the only recognizable devs left are the ones that should have been the first to go.
---
You have to be close enough even max skills is only region wide. A LOT of people hangout in caldari space...
---
Just drop your price to.01 cent above build and buy everything.
---
Then you dont talk to many traders my friend..
---
Wise words
---
For the memes.
---
Nullsec cant meme like low.
---

Cool. Thanks!
---
Not really so surprising, consider the niche of workstation software, you are paid to write it, but they are paid to use it, every day.
---
Your font choices is interesting
---
It's a one-time 1b isk per corp if my memory doesn't fail me.
---
The sole purpose of the operation is to damage rental empires by providing a solution so cheap you can't compete with it, without completely killing your own rental income.
---
Higher chance of something happening than whining on reddit
---
You got me there, fammo. Good one.
---
Probably killed his empty iteron V lol
---
I would make systems of security 0.9 and higher a safe heaven from ganking and war dec for players having less than X billion in assets AND played the game for less than Y hours. (X and Y to be defined).
---
Of course, there should be a way to opt out for those who want the whole Eve experience. 
---
When I started the game, ganking was pissing me off. I wasn’t understanding it and seemed unfair.
---
Jump gates are actually all rail guns confirmed. They shoot ships AND at ships.
---
I'm fairly certain the "legacy code" excuse is just a bad excuse for the current devs' lack of talent.  The completely new stuff they make that should be detached from legacy code is just as buggy/broken, if not more so, than the 20 year old stuff.
---
"defect" :(
---
It's pretty.
---
Interestingly I've set up some tractors in there and they never actually died after i left them.
---
I wonder where they go, a lot.
---
Its almost like they designed the game to be spread out over various systems and not congested at a single point??
---
Start by hiring and KEEPING a community team.
---
So the philosophy so many have speculated on is true. It's a decent strategy from a high level. Just not as fun IMO. Would you say this is met with disappointment by line members? Or are they mostly in agreement with the strategy? I know I'd be livid if one of my FCs did that, but maybe its a culture thing.
---
The problem with this, and one of the main failures of DUST, is that nobody that actually plays EVE wants their assets to be in the hands of some random FPS kiddies that have no real dedication or effort into their game.  If a bunch of DUST bunnies can kill your supercarrier by playing teabag online, nobody is going to fly a supercarrier.  For all their faults, at least CCP seems to have understood this, as any connection between DUST/EVE was mostly superficial.  REAL connection where the bunnies could actually affect EVE in a meaningful way could very easily damage the game beyond repair.
---
I think its an actual limitation that would require an engine rework to correct.
---
Make free?
---
As someone who works on a business-to-business app -- the reality is that _nobody_ knows how anything works. Not I, but especially not the end user.
---
Fun is what its all suppose to be about. Thats why i took a long break.
---
Well, he's a douchebag in the books so it's not surprising that the person using his name is a douchebag in real life.
---
People are not talking about you on fleets or jabber. They're laughing at you.
---
It was frustrating to me. It is what leads to dozens of fleets to bash structures without any resistance. The second anyone tries to ping a fleet to respond to the Goon aggression and gets a fleet that can match their numbers, they ping for additional fleet support which, in most cases, leads to the defender not bothering to contest at all. Thus creating an endless cycle of boring warfare in EVE Online 2019. Scary to be on either side of, if you ask me.
---
How the fuck is purposely targeting people who possibly maybe made some girl upset by what they said on comms not white knighting? 🤔
---
Fair point.
---
Okay.
---
That’s what starting systems are for, they just need to make this more overt
---
The folks at CODE and Wingspan are roleplayers. The people at the receiving end of their roleplaying are too happy.
---
you forgot no citadels facwar
---
Toffee?! O.o
---
You still have 5 seconds in these systems before concord arrives. 
---
For the new players, I wouldn’t change the concord rule. Instead, the damages from the ganker wouldn’t apply.
---
Must be roleplaying this character
---
Do Heavy Drones apply well enough on Cruisers? What about Frigates? Or should you generally use the frigates appropriate for the size of the enemy because of the maximum speed they can reach? Allowing a fast frigate/cruiser to outrun heavy drones, but not light/medium drones?
---
I’d add some form of solo content that doesn’t carry the risk of being ganked into oblivion after an hour of jumping through star gates
---
I'm unsure on how I have wronged them. Will need to check when I log in.
---
Margin trade in Amarr or Rens/Ichoryia. Jita is saturated.
---
Delete the game
---
Just had a conversation with one of your boys, it was pretty fun, we both were cloaked, stranded in a null-sec system in the middle of your federation... It really had been funny hahahahah
---
[https://forums-archive.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;t=352629](https://forums-archive.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;t=352629) read this. I think you'll find so much perspective and amazing video logs + forum logs over 4-6 years of faction warfare from the amarr perspective.
---
This is great.  Unrelated, have you won Eve?
---
&gt; Do Heavy Drones apply well enough on Cruisers?
---
&gt;  What about Frigates?
---
depends on how dumb they are, don't count on it
---
&gt;  Or should you generally use the frigates appropriate for the size of the enemy because of the maximum speed they can reach? Allowing a fast frigate/cruiser to outrun heavy drones, but not light/medium drones?
---
idk can you rephrase this question better
---
I  add 15 new regions and on of them has Earth in it. Everyone will fight over that thing.
---
Yeah but the EULA covers them, you can be scolded by GMs and eventually banned for fucking with newbros there
---
&gt;When will CCP resolve this
---
HA
---
a lot of people I know started their solo career hunting explorers. You should try that, fit an astero and watch some tutorials. Easy, fulfilling and fun as fuck. You will get the adrenaline shakes the first 3-4 times.
---
T1 Blueprints are plentiful and are seeded by NPCs, so all the blueprints are available. Note that they have 0% speed and efficiency, so you might want to research them up to 20% if you ever want to make a profit with them. T2 blueprint originals are unique and are essentially priceless. You can invent T2 blueprints copies, which are limited-run of T2 items.
---
Also, you're going to have a lot of trouble making any money manufacturing and selling items. If you are a miner, you are often better simply selling your ore instead of manufacturing it into an item.
---
The CSM only puts forth ideas that benefit their shit blobs . So might wanna rethink that
---
Hey if you want to chat with me on discord about that - I'd love the perspective from the other side
---
Salvage and PI. PI is a bit of a strange one though, as it's not "region-specific" in the same way as other resources (i.e. it's not linked to the dominant faction in that map-quarter) but is purely down to the planet distribution from the original universe seed.
---
More specifically, when using Tactical Mode, tracking an object is almost exactly the same as looking at it (except for some cinematic stuff). When you switch to Orbit Mode, tracking an object will look towards it while keeping your ship in view.
---
Make eve2 server which is just eve from 2003 without micro transactions
---
It's a hotkey for enabling focus view. More or less.
---
Cut down and merge skills. The bloat is real. We don't need a "magic 14" to create an artificial road block. Remember learning skills and how horrible those were? Lets prune or adjust the "intro skills" and make it up at the back end "late game" towards the capital end of things.  Getting a new audience is going to be hard with attention spans becoming shorter and shorter. Instant gratification at the beginning to keep them hooked. Get them in more ships earlier to make the player feel like he/she is accomplishing something/leveling/getting better.  
---
While not a sandbox, look how games like World of Warcraft  Constantly holds a new players hand to get them where they need to be before setting them free. A little more of that wouldn't be such a bad thing at the start for new players.
---
True as well.
---
Yeah can't believe alliances would be so big and take over null! Oh wait nvm that's happened several times in the past there was even briefly a giant blue donut in the hands of bob
---
That relies on CCP having good product owners, which they clearly do not
---
Because half the shit on g2a is purchased fraudulently  :-(
---
I’m currently setting up a gila what dps should I be aiming for?
---
Maybe if you enter the abyss just close enough to a moon in k-space, the POS won't notice...
---
Downs Syndrome clone? Need to get you a refund..
---
Its impossible to cheat on a significant other by playing Eve since Eve IS you significant other.
---
This is correct it doesn’t need to be anchored, in fact it will still give notifications if attacked in non anchored state.
---
this is the internet. expecting other people to share the same values as you is an exercise in futility. block them if their words offend you. no one says you have to sit there and take it. on the second point that you made, when you step outside of the echochamber you are accustomed to you tend to drown out all the people that agree with you and instead pay more attention to the things you disagree with. grow some thick skin and become a tougher person rather than crying on the internet that you got trolled successfully.
---
Did it at least taste decent?
---
I give an A+ for this attempt. Judging from recent tapi posts this is indeed an up and coming academic candidate. Keep up the good work! And ensure you post progress updates for later attempts at whatever you draw! In future projects inject some memes, try and not just stick to the presidential style pictures!

Extractors cost plex. Game time costs plex. And multi training cost again plex..more sp farming means higher plex.
