Runescape is leaking
---
Or just leave the omg must get Mac ticks to the hyper rigged supers an rorqauls, and build a worthwhile thing for people that just want a cool mining thing to do.
---
There wasnt a 1 week cool down when a war just ends, before this change. 
---

---
Cool downs have only ever applied to surrender situations.
---
Say what you will about Doom, but it's not like is IRL persona is exactly a tightly held secret... He goes to LOTS of eve meetups. He's not *quite* the most doxable person in the game, but he's close.
---
Defenders can't just make it mutual anymore.
---
That's how I interpreted it too lol
---
They aren't exploiting anything. The mechanics are CCP's doing, not PIRATs. 
---
They are just using them as developed.
---
He even has a Nestor in his SMB but has no refits...
---
Have you ever been in lowsec for more than 5 mins? I got 6 T1 frig vs T1 frig in 2 nights. If you yourself fly a faction/pirate frig, you can get even more fights. And you can avoid smartbombing battleships if you have half a neuron.
---
If you have ever hung out with Ch3ss then you would know why those names are perfect.
---
Just fit up a (cloaky-nullified) exploration tengu with a mobile depot and refits, goto wormholes and deep reaches of nullsec. Run relic sites, ghost sites, superior sleeper cache sites and scanned down DED sites. Come back home with 10x the value of your ship.
---
I don't think they sold thousand dollar supporter packs for nova tho
---
&gt;You're arguing against my use of the term opportunity cost and not the actual subject at hand. 
---
That's not what a strawman is.  A strawman is when you set up an argument no one is making and knock it down to score rhetorical points.
---
&gt;Ironically, you trying to chastise me in hopes of moving the topic to something else because you won't admit your idea is stupid just proves my point more. 
---
I'm chastising you because you started this entire discussion with a comment that was both incredibly condescending and nonsensical.  I've never had any interest in engaging with you on the issues until you demonstrated some ability to do anything other than self-righteously defend am entrenched position, for example by admitting you'd made a mistake and apologizing.
---
&gt;Let me know when you're ready to discuss  how making the new top tier ship in the game even more accessible and cheaper improves the meta despite making subs even more useless.
---
You have to realize that your characterization here assumes a great number of arguable points come out your way (for example that carriers would get cheaper when more people wanted them).
---
–î–∞, –æ–Ω –≥–ª—É–ø—ã–π
---
If you havent realized there is something really wrong with the way the game is going, well your just ignorant.
---
I been looking for a video as well. It was this old tutorial video that looked like a briefing session straight out of a very old wing commander game. Talked about sec status, sentry guns, and some other stuff. Looked for hours and couldn‚Äôt find it
---
Meh should've made it so war HQ doesn't have reinf or treating dropping war from not paying bill as a lose with 2 weeks of cooldown before they can dec again.
---
The main trade hub is in Jita, it is also the most dangerous system in eve. Never assume no-one will attack you. Don't be afraid to try new things and talk to people. Always keep a nice rainy day fund in your wallet.
---
Pretty sure program is no longer being supported and it is no longer updated.
---
\&gt; a few hours learning how to play craps with Elise
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Wait.... is that where shoot the shit came from
---
I did. I can't speak for the other nerds .
---
Or burn low / null mission's. Blitzing lvl 5 in carriers
---
If I die and lose my ship do I lose the credits in my wallet?
---
Why not use autopilot?
---
Pic of a recent commission work done. Heron in Raata Sunset livery. This beautiful Caldari tuning fork is the love of explorers everywhere.
---
The commissioner appears to have gone missing though, so if it's yours--please contact me!
---
No, you keep the credit. You can also buy insurance on your ship to get a payout when your ship goes boom.
---
Grab a  bunch of frigs, head strait to low sec and get them blown up till it doesn‚Äôt bother you anymore. 
---
Then you can start to play the game
---
Autopilot puts you 15 km from the gate and you slowboat the rest of the way. It's very obvious if someone is using autopilot and it makes you vulnerable to cankers.
---
Are there starter systems I should try and make my way to or should I just start making a career in the system I started in?
---
My only experience with an MMO was World of Warcraft and I know the two are extremely different
---
Because sooner or later you will get suicide ganked, I thought it‚Äôd never happen because I didn‚Äôt make it worth the cost to them, turns out they totally do it for fun and salt.
---
As other people have said, finish the new pilot mission line first. It'll give you an intro to what the different careers in New Eden are like and teach you some pilot skills. After that, there's the blood Stained Stars which is more combat focused but has some good lore and nets decent isk for a new player.
---
In that scenario, I might actually still be playing
---
I‚Äôm looking to do more solo work, I guess with Exploration and eventually Hauling
---
Please be bait
---
If they don‚Äôt contact you, lmk the commissioned price and I will take it probably. Heron hull was the first hull I fell in love with.
---
They were not as bad as goons in some ways but also way worse because this was pre-Phoebe when literally any use of capitals would have PL drop on you. You absolutely could not use more than one carrier and even that was a risk. Jump changes were a direct nerf to PL and BL and they were 100% necessary.
---
Oops, voted.
---
-2.5billion
---
&gt;That was a supporting quote? How so? How does that relate to whatever the hell problem you think exists?
---
Yes. Because it establishes the problem. Because it relates to injectors.
---
&gt;Player one has 5 minute delay, and player 2 doesn't? Rather obvious here, dude.
---
Why would player two not have a delay? A cyno activation would be on a 5 min delay.
---
&gt;So your issue is people being too rich, and NOT what they can do with that money? Then why are you made about injectors?
---
The problem is the imbalance and what CCP pointed out. Because injectors help to quickly get into those ships.
---
&gt;Citation needed.
---
Wrong. I know this for a fact because I have seen it many times.
---
How does one detect when that is the case?
---
They‚Äôll never officially announce that they killed it but it‚Äôs dead AF.
---
If you want to do missions you can follow your available agents through the agency, I advise agents that have you attack another empire faction, especially Caldari.
---
Sisters of eve, and CDB where the ones I cycled between when I ran missions. Learn to use the loyalty point store, that‚Äôs where a lot of the isk comes from, not just the mission payout and bounties.
---
Both are just codenames for the Dust Successor.
---
The game needs more advantage to attackers not defenders.
---
So you are one of those "solo pvpers"?
---
Better yet, put the agency and antipharmakon boosters in the resource wars LP stores. DB7 at 36m a pop makes for sad faces.
---
&gt;They did eventually get dropped, but thats the life of a marauder.
---
No. Thats a broken game.
---
&gt;What i learned from losing a couple golems is to use zkill as my "alt" and religiously check every person to make sure they arent a cyno alt.
---
Good game relying on free intel!
---
While I understand the utility of multiboxing (I have 3 accounts), I really enjoy just single account stuff. Although let's be real here, imagine being the person who has to sit there for like 10 minutes with a cyno up while you see all your capital buddies get some action while you sit back and watch, unable to do anything.
---
I don't have to explain why it would be bad to you. You have to explain why it's good to me first. It's called burden of proof.
---
Basically dead these days. Maybe BR in certain systems, but otherwise not really.
---
Have you ever moved stuff with a JF?
---
[removed]
---
Can confirm as i have toons there who help eerrr "Scout" üòè
---
Multiple (utility) alts are very important to blops/covops. It's not that they couldn't be done with a 1:1 rule, but that they wouldn't be done. Mostly because they're mind numbingly boring and could be fairly described as "sit here for an hour and don't move, then click a few buttons for a minute, then go back to sitting for a couple more hours until the fleet is ready to go home."
---
They were jever there to keep them?
---
Hes correct. LS is pretty dead for solo these days.
---
...Too easy mate. Try again
---
I know it seems crazy to you - working as the station night manager of Eve‚Äôs eclectic Tosche Station - but no, this is not bait. This is a genuine question based on my current place in life.
---
You ever kill your alt out of adrenaline and the shakes of excitement?........
---
OP is a retard who have never owned a cap ship.  
---
  
---
Move along, guys.
---
Pretty much this, if i want PVP i log in, go to amamake and warp to ANY plex.
---
I have this haha, its funny for blaping/gtfo
---
I still get fights every night I go, I don't know what you're talking about,
---
How do you delete someone else post
---
Solo pvp alone takes 2-3 alts.
---
&gt;This would bring more employment and therefore more retention to the game.
---
[Citation needed]
---
If FC's couldn't have multiple accounts, 90% (maybe more) of content in this game would die. A lot of people are F1 warriors and a lot of the really good FCs are multitasking doing an insane amount of things on different alts to make those fleets happen.
---
That's just the tip of the iceberg though. There's a lot of reasons that most people end up with multiple alts. I cut down from 7 to 3 accounts, but I would probably just quit playing if they made that change.
---
dawww, youuuu
---
I want to clear up a misconception. Nova is not cancelled and it is still in full development.
---
oh, i think i should return to eve just to be able to fly corvetes in tournaments,
---
Burn straight for the exit and overheat like hell.
---
Isn't the point of this that when you have space that is "depleted" by the time you log in to pve, then you make the effort to acquire more space?  Isn't that the whole point of the idea?
---
Christ you sperg lords are as good as your propaganda
---
Best reason to log in is to log out.
---
Jump changes.
---
And? Surely coordination between players would be better. 
---
Would lead to more healthy markets around instead of just jumping to jita with 4 cyno alts.
---
&gt;I find it hard to believe that the people of New Eden don't ponder where an AU comes from.
---
I‚Äôm sure they wonder about these questions. New Eden likely has even more historians and archaeologists than we have ever had on Earth. 
---
&gt;I'm a resident of Earth and one of the first things I did when I started playing EVE was look up where an AU comes from. 
---
Fair enough, but imagine thousands of years and at least one catastrophic societal collapse between yourself and the last time the answer to that question really mattered to enough people. Add some human error and forgetfulness into the mix and you have an excellent recipe for losing that info. Especially when a large portion of that time was spent having no use for that information.
---
&gt;if AUs and Gs are in fact used by the people of New Eden, it serves as evidence of the existence of Earth.
---
If you knew where an AU or G came from, yes that would be evidence of Earth in some form. However it appears that the residents of new Eden didn‚Äôt even know about things like the Eve gate collapse until they rediscovered it:
---
&gt;Now, every indication points to this being the gate that our forefathers used to enter this world, but despite massive studies on the gate and the EVE system in whole, we still haven‚Äôt uncovered what happened to the gate all these millenniums ago.
---
If some event as important as that can get lost, who knows what else humans of New Eden have forgotten.
---
Also, I will point out that like you and myself, things like AU‚Äôs and G‚Äôs likely aren‚Äôt a part of everyday life. I don‚Äôt think that the vast majority of humans in New Eden use these measurements, if they even know of them. Just like I may have little understanding of the kinds of measurements a jeweler might use for his work, most people who aren‚Äôt directly involved or specifically taught this information will not know, and less even likely care. New Eden is a grim-dark dystopia after all.
---
Still worth it to do the intro missions for a bunch of reasons. You might find you like other careers, they may be useful to make isk on the side, and it'll give you better piloting skills if you ever end up in PvP. People like to pop explorers, especially in low sec.
---
It's beneficial to have common units.  
---
It makes communication easier.  
---
Isaac Azimov touched this subject in "Foundation's Edge".
---
... I mean, a few of my guys shot two of them this morning, and then they hilariously nearly third-partied a fight we had with Buccaneers, but I don't think that really counts as hanging out...
---
They were a new player so I didnt charge them anything really. Just whatever it would cost for me to ship it to them.
---
Thanks for the offer though!
---
That‚Äôs not eve.
---
Yeah, but what kind of fights?
---
It's not possible to implement this in a way the Eve players couldn't easily bypass.
---
I guess what I find unsatisfying is that as far as I can tell this has never been addressed by the lore. 
---
&gt; Also, I will point out that like you and myself, things like AU‚Äôs and G‚Äôs likely aren‚Äôt a part of everyday life.

---
To address this point, there are factions that would certainly use these units and don't seem to care. The Sisters of Eve and Society of Conscious thought are two that come to mind. The Sister's of Eve have an entire corp dedicated to scientific research.
---
why pay when comms are open for free?
---
What I don‚Äôt get about the EVE spinoffs is that they don‚Äôt really look ‚ÄúEVE.‚Äù They‚Äôre sci fi but take Valkyrie‚Äî none of the ships look like EVE ships, or even similar to the empire styling we‚Äôre used to. It looks cool and all, but I wanna fly an *Amarri* fighter, not some generic sci fi fighter.
---
TD fit firetails and hookbills would have you for breakfast. Some pirate frigs as well.
---
im sure those 4 guys would have alot of fun flying to 4 different systems, open a cyno, wait for 10mins and fly back. very fun gameplay!
---
I get tons of good solo fights still.  Come to BR.
---
I do agree.  Kind of why I would be fine with not doing #1 and #3.  Truthfully, I think #4 is more likely to help the attackers and I would be fine if that and #2 are the only ones.  Maybe my order should have been 4, 2, 3, 1.  
---
This is more of trying to get some actual ideas out that could actually be implemented instead of just bitching about Eve being dead. None of this does anything to help reduce the blue doughnut issue.  In some ways, I'm afraid that making it too easy to attack would also have negative unintended consequences.  I don't even know if there is a sweet spot where things could work.  
---
Cyno jammers, citadels and jump gates are OP mechanics that have to be nerfed. But I'm unsure where to start with that other than trying to kill some time zone tanking in null via sov mechanics.
---
1v1 frigates, mostly faction/pirate but some T1 mixed in. All pretty quick fun fights. Some busy nights there are a few gangs which make 1v1 harder, some bigger ships camping the plex (in which case, just need to bring a big ship too). Lowsec in mostly empty, but the pockets of activity are there and they are fun.
---
Who the fuck cares what Doom has to say anymore? Hasn't he said hes quitting like 5 times now?
---
I didn't try out Alb until well after SI and I think even the terribleness of ToA.  Necromancer was far worse for RvR though it was so easy to powerlevel with.  Didn't try Mid until after warlocks came out (because I still had a grudge against doublefrost zerkers,) and those and bonedancers were quite amusing and I actually found what powerleveling actually was.  Fucking Modernagrav was such better leveling with redcaps than anything Alb and Hib got and healers having aoe stun was so nice.  Mid RvR was probably the most interesting because of that though, since one of your two healers was also your CC.  I usually was a CCer as I started with bard and later with sorcerer, but never did pac healer.
---
thanks, we are
---
&gt;That's not what a strawman is.
---
Yes, it is.
---
&gt;What I'm doing is called deflecting.
---
They're not mutually exclusive.
---
&gt; Stop using terms for which you don't know the meaning, and especially stop being condescending about your incorrect usage. 
---
I've been, by definition, correct with everything I used. I can just see right through you and we both know that so you have to spew diarrhea of the mouth rather than just admit you're wrong.
---
&gt;you could admit you made a mistake and apologize.
---
None to be made, see above.
---
&gt;You have to realize that your characterization here assumes a great number of arguable points come out your way (for example that carriers would get cheaper when more people wanted them).
---
You need to work on your reading comprehension, friend. I never said that carriers would get cheaper when more people wanted them. I said if we got rid of supers and titans (14b, ~60b respectively) the "new" top tier ships would be at a dirt cheap 800b-2b. Even for accounting the loss rorqs, more people would put all their efforts into normal caps so they wouldn't dramatically spike to super pricing.
---
&gt;What you've done here, by the way, is set up a textbook strawman.
---
Actually no, this is us getting back on the topic. See, doesn't it feel good to actually discuss what the original point was rather than throwing a temper tantrum? Reply with something relevant or don't, I actually don't care anymore. I'm just happy you now realize that your original idea was so bad you're not even willing to defend it.
---
Darks with garmurs works well. higest level, however, is level 5 darks with hawks.
---
People are way too upset over star citizens development time. Because it is pretty nornal to work 8 years or more on a project of its scale. Especially when you cant reuse assets like most games do nowadays.
---
Um, I solo pvp with just one account... 
---
Unless I missed your point?
---
What other personalities threatened RL harm, solicited doxxing material, and then repeated it all over again hours later in a discord server... or did anything even remotely on that level? Cause they can get fucked to, I don't care how much "content" they create.
---
Thats fine art, needs framing. Woukd like to hang in house with charcuterie and wine. Then discuss its origin.
---
In general people in high sec are bored to death doing PvE which is not great in Eve. Pirat gives people the opportunity to do some PvP when they are passing through high sec and these ungrateful bastards still wants to shoot their structure.
---
I said scram kite ships. Obviously a brawl/mwd ship will lose to a scram/ab fit
---
The Mittani doxxed a player at fan fest and told him to go kill himself yet hes still around.
---
Well as an example if I only can use 1 account I move all my assets from 15 accounts to the one. Nuke the billion or so SP down and then basically never need to pay CCP a penny ever again. I would also never actually need to login for anything outside of fleets which means I would probably just stop playing all together finally.
---
Arguing about if it is good or bad is irrelevant. CCP is a company, and they will never make a move like that where they lose many subscriptions because having alts is no longer possible.
---
no but i have sicked logi drones on an enemy ship, luckily nobody noticed
---
Why stop there, force players to train only one skill, and operate only the module associated with said skill. Chose a passive mod, too fucking bad, you‚Äôre now a Capacitor Power Relay.
---
He didn't doxx him. He didn't threaten him. 
---
It was bad, he was punished. Acting like it was anywhere on the same level of inappropriate is silly.
---
Yeah, there are some systems, like Kamela, Nen, etc, but otherwise its dead.
---
Pretty sure John should have some close friends in SMA lol
---
Hey op, I too am, fucking retard||ed||
---
I agree with ^
---
You're (the OP) ideas don't help solve the game for newer players at all and I'd seriously question the balance in the games you make.
---
it takes 2-3 account to be a risk averse child is what he means
---
Ah pre-pubescent boys are so cute when they get excited. It sounds like Christmas in the Valley in like 1980 in this video. All we needed was a "gag me with a spoon" and it would have been perfect.
---
I honestly don't see the difference. Telling a man to kill himself in person or telling someone you'll chop off their hands through a stream. Not sure how they aren't the exact same.
---
Ok, I actually laughed out loud.
---
They know where they come from, just not many details.
---
Absolutely
---
Masterwork.
---
"I only have one account. CCP please nerf everyone down to my level."
---
Bots.
---
Also bots.
---
An orca is a great highsec caravan. For nullsec I would probably use a rorqual. It can jump as far as a freighter, can haul a fair amount and can fit industrial ships in it. Just my 2 cents.
---
Lol Analzar Athanor
---
Are you new here or something lol
---
Sansha has needed skins forever.  Too bad they're ugly as fuck and probably more expensive than my car.
---
Yeah, yeah, EVE is dying, we know.
---
A VR battle royale with EVE-like macrotransactions.  Exclusive to Google Cardboard only.  NOW we're talking something CCP may actually release.
---
This is a weak attempt at a political analogy. Stick to EVE, bro.
---
You have not lived til you dual box logi for small gang.....That is the eve equivalent of snatching the pebble from my hand.
---
The mighty SMA.
---
At some point a guy memed them all by himself for three days straight.
---
They got so traumatized that all SMA would dock up when even a shuttle entered their systems.
---
They showed some of Nova (same thing, effectively) at the last fanfest or some other event. They somehow managed to completely fuck up the animations and make everything generally just *off.* They took the feedback and basically said they're shelving it.
---
Stage 2 was a broken shitfest in normal CCP fashion to the point they had to skip it.  Maybe the reward structure is broken too.  I mean, its kinda a 50/50 if CCP is just that incompetent, or if its intended to be shit.
---
One thing, if your navigation skills are low buy a 1% agility implant to get the ship under 2 second align in prop mode. That helps a ton
---
sry i single box while roaming cuz im not a bad
---
Being a post-it note, it would be an interesting framing indeed. I'd love to see it.
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Without quoting CCP profits or "muh ticks" tell me why this would be a bad thing for the game?
---
Considering CCP would lose 2/3 of their shitty revenue so there's a negative chance of this happening, I don't see any purpose in debating it if we aren't including profits.
---
lol
---
because flying 1 button ships is not fun?
---
I only have one account, and a single character at that, and even I find this idea laughably terrible.
---
Pirat isn't that sexy
---
I ran some because some newbies mentioned in a chat channel that they wanted to do/try them. I'd toss a pair of ventures with fits into a blockade runner and zip to wherever they were at. I've only done the first 2 tiers of them. I've got half the jackets. I need to do a couple more to get the Amarr &amp; Caldari jackets. Space Barbie always needs more clothes.
---
&gt;Agreed, you can find a shitton of bots  since Frat is helping them push into the area.
---
Fudge. I better finish up getting a set of jackets for my characters before they took them away. I only got one Sister of Eve Analysts Coats before they took away the stuff that gave the AK needed to buy them, and they broke something in the database so that you cannot buy or sell them any more (used to be on contracts).
---
You know you can play EVE without dedicating hours every night to it, right?
---
They are still around. But you have to be in-system and have beacons on overview to see them. If you're looking for lesser/minor ones, you may have to jump a few systems. When they were in the Agency, it was trivial to find the nearest one that y'all could do together.
---
Honestly, I'm disappointed. ProviBloc had been pinging this Eagle fleet for days promising content. Got what I hear was a depressingly poor turnout and just ran from us as soon as we entered system. One of our tackle caught Arkados monitor because he warped the rest of his fleet away from us. But then he MJD'd out and got away.
---
We obviously hoped they might try to come back and try to do anything, and were a little surprised they ran off outnumbering us 2:1. Not sure if Provibloc just wanted to posture and show their friends how elite they were, maybe didn't want to fight without their friends on field? Even though when they were on field, they didn't even fight anything.
---
I dunno. Seemed a weird move to me. Left us without a fight though. Provibloc apparently tried to reform for a bit, we stayed in their space for a while to encourage them to come and play and were briefly joined there by a small TRC Gila fleet. But no fight from Provibloc :(
---
Feeling pretty cute, may drop later idk
---
&gt; *Faction Mining laser upgrades, requiring 10-20% less CPU requiring t1/t2 versions as input*  
---
The Frostline ones are close - they can do both ice/asteroids for the same stats as a T2. 
---
&gt; *Faction Mining ships and barges*  
---
I'd be OK with skins for existing mining ships. Resource Wars has the first "volatile" skins - the skin lasts until the ship is repackaged or blown up.
---
When we were kicked out of the north goons said your #1 should be changed.   We were told no it wasnt a problem we just needed to "get gud".  I still see it as a problem, the rest of your ideas are making defense even stronger and no defense needs no help, eliminating timezone tanking would go a long ways to generating more fights.
---
"The lady insists!"
---
Done and done.  I hope they do get in touch though. Anyone who loves the heron is good in my book.
---
I think this could actually work with a few caveats:
---
1. Fitting this "Mass Deviation Wormhole Stabilizer" (henceforth referred to as MDWS) disables ALL stealth modules from being activated and prevents despawn on log out (you are basically treated as a capital in this respect, needing to be docked or tethered). 
---
2. Stabilizing a wormhole with your MDWS takes time (say 1-5 minutes range, based on the remaining mass/time on the wormhole), requires you to stay in a close proximity to the wormhole (say 10km or 15km), and increases both your ship and the wormholes scan signature to the size of a "capital" wormhole making you easier to scan down until deactivated.
---
3. Capital ships can only pass through large enough wormholes while a ship is actively using a MDWS on it, both in AND out.
---
4. Repeated use of the MDWS causes fluctuations in J-Space and will eventually draw the attention of powerful lootless NPC's (I am thinking drifter battleships with their nasty DD's), each use in a single day increases the chances of an ambush during stabilization and each use on the same wormhole increases it further.
---
I think these are reasonable limits and introduce reasonable risk, without being too overbearing either. Giving the MDWS drawbacks that increases it's vulnerability and forces it to either commit and stay with the Capital in a proper fleet, or hide outside the hole leaving the Capital itself more vulnerable. Restrictions on range, making it active use only, and increasing your scan signature means getting in and out requires commitment and a vulnerable period, once again rewarding coordination and good fleet management (whether a full on invasion fleet or small gang) and punishing the stupid and the careless. Last of all the chance to spawn worthless NPC's capable of one shotting a large ship or handful of small ships per wave that only increases the more you use it in a single op incentivizes short routes over long ones and/or coordinating jump swaps between multiple ships in a fleet (I am thinking by your 3rd or 4th jump the NPC's should have shown up once, and will show up almost every jump, and in ever greater numbers each time). 
---
Akin to Hannibal's famous crossing of the alps at great cost, taking a Capital shortcut through J-Space should be risky and bold requiring vulnerability and slowly bleeding the fleet as they wander farther in. This should allow daring sneak attacks into the heart of enemy territory, but ONLY if properly planned and competently led.
---
KM is exactly 6min after statement
---
" tell me why this would be a bad thing for the game?"   
---
You'd be cutting CCP's profit margins massively if the reports about how many accounts are alts is correct, they already have enough issues generating revenue and retaining paying accounts, they don't need to create another.
---
It took a bit chunk his cap :P
---
This is the life of an incursion runner. In High Sec if you have multiple ships, you can load into a Bowhead and avoid the know Gank systems while also watching Eve Gate Check and your Map with various highlighting functions.
---

If you don't have a lot of ships, then you travel fit your ship and head to the next focus.
---
If you have a lot of bling, often the bling goes into a cloaky fast hauler and you sprint them to the new location where you either meet your Bowhead or have a group of hulls in various regions that you can then fit.
---
Now that CCP has nerfed the High Sec Incursion spawns, this is less about moving to the next focus fast and more about moving safely.

Interesting AAR Fun Facts:
---
1) TAPI had a muninn fleet nearly 2x the size of the NC muninn fleet. They simply didn't fight. After initially settting up to camp us out of 9UY, TAPI pinged to 300km off and watched as the Provi muninn fleet was swarmed. Great allies
---
2) The battle report does not accurately reflect how swoll the INIT/TAPI/Provi ranks were. Only a portion of their fleet shows up on zkill because all they really killed were a few dictors and booshers.  
---
3) NC lost 1 muninn and Horde lost 3 eagles in high sec. Rats outperforming Provi tonight.
---
if you have an interceptor with &lt;2s align you cant get caught in bubbles and its impossible to catch you on a gate 99% of the time, only thing you have to worry about is 3+ smartbombing battleships which is pretty rare

In wormhole space, say I complete a Data/Relic site (sleeper one, not pirate). I only killed the sleepers for the blue loot, and didnt hack the cans because they have so little in them it's actually pathetic.

Site doesn't despawn immediately because it's not completed, but it has been warped to and rats killed.

Quick, off the top of your head, how did 1 meter originally become that specific length? How did 1 pound become that specific weight? If you know those, how about 1 line(length), 1 section(area), or 1 troy ounce(weight)?

The answer is that people don't commonly know the origins behind the units of measurement. This is especially true for those units that aren't commonly used by most people.

The Loki is currently broken for solo, it has everything. Cov cloak, long webs to pin anything down or disengage if needed, high alpha, good dps, damage selection, decent speed, high scan res, combat probes, yadda yadda and it's way too cheap for what it does.
---
You can always choose when to fight with it, and with that much versatility if you engage you'll likely win unless they have their own cloaked counter. It works even better if you have someone baiting for you.

How is that betraying friends, people can be in different alliances and still talk to each other. Surely you must understand that, ohh wait how could you when no one trust you and the alliance full of your "friends" you backstabbed.
---
It wasn't just the threat, it was the attempt to follow up on it, the attempt to get RL info to pursue it. 
---
One was a joke that crossed the line.
---
The other was a legitimate threat with action after the fact to follow up on it.
---
One is going to far in the vein of the game (over the top briefing)... the other one is a legal liability for CCP and a line that we legitimately can not tolerate any crossing with the things allowed in game.
---
Short of actual violence, Gigx committed the highest sin of any digital community. Mittens did an edgy presentation in persona that went to far. Would I argue against CCP banning them both? No, but for sure Gigx was vastly worse.

I know someone who spends a week ratting just to blow it all on terrorising a random region for a weekend with a frig.
---
What a time to be alive.
---
Yeah I can go with that. I tend to stick to CCP's use of the word exploit, as it has a meaning within the rules of the game.
---
In the broader use of the term, they are exploting the mechanics to their advantage, although I think for a group like PIRAT, there isn't that much advantage as they can't drop all wars.
---
For smaller groups that only dec 2-3 at a time, this is totally explotiable perfectly within the way it's been developed.
---
Point to me on the ship where the bad man multiboxer touched you
---
I like the idea of using corvettes and making it open to low SP people, but that might be too limiting - and boring.  
---
What if you just stuck with Jovian only ships and kept the rest of the rules, they are meant for low SP people. They are also very versatile to fit so you'll get more fun combos.  
---
Just be sure to use a point system so that you don't just get everyone flying a bunch of praxi.
---
Well you see surely the Judge knows a thing or two about backstabbing )))
---
It is surprising that people have a salt for fun. I was even more surprised when my empty hauler for 2,5mil ISK was ganked by slasher and vexor simultaneously in lowsec (0.4) empty region. Why? For what purpose? They even tried to kill the pod, unsuccessfully.

i have 8 omegas with 2-3toons each on them... even with all those chars it can be a pain in the ass to organize stuff for myself or my corp.. beeing restricted to 1char, this game would be a pain. not even talking about pvp only beeing restricted to press f1 and nothing else... 
---
naaah fuck that
---
&gt; Ultimately, the expectation that every one has to multibox is unhealthy for the game in my view.
---
i mean..  there is nothing more boring than singleboxing pvp. (except you solo roam)

i like to challenge myself to triple/quadbox in fleets/pvp. i dont even want to imagine beeing restricted to a single toon with your only job beeing pressing f1.

DUST 514 was an awesome game let down by the hardware. For some reason they got right up releasing gameplay of Project Nova but turned it in to some weird COD wannabe. If they had just taken DUST off the PS3 and ported it to PC, Project Nova could have had a following like Planetside or Arma. Even if the contract they signed with sony prevented them from  porting it, they could have copied it under a different name and done it. It was a huge waste of potential.
---
:swoon:
---
There is a lot about the Caldari ships I wish they would update cosmetically, but the Heron was my first love as well and I hope it never changes.
---
and pressing f1 4 times is more fun?

---
Basicly they made a slow paced fps for the current age range of eve online ( 25-40 year olds)... then the younger people that actually play that kind of game. hated it cuz it was slow and the fight was decided by who had the better gun not with skill.
---
tldr They Made a game for an age group that dont play that kind of game. and was shocked when younger people hated it cuz it was slow paced for that type of game
---
I don't know about pounds because imperial is stupid, but a gram was originally defined as 1cm¬≥ of water. A meter was previously based on the the distance between the north pole and the equator. And yes I knew those off the top of my head. 
---
Neither of these standards are in use today because they aren't precise enough and they both relied on a reference object. The SI has redefined them based on physical constants like the speed of light or moles of a certain element, I forget which one. 
---
So we can accept that maybe, just maybe, New Eden is using the version of these measurements based on physical constants. That still doesn't explain where an AU came from.

flying important roles, logi/dps and tackle is way more fun yes...

Pretty sure if Eve players were playing dust on PC instead of Eve they would still have a mining fleet or VNI ratters in orbit on alt+tab... lol
---
I wish I knew why this was funny??
---
nobody owes you a fair fight, and even fewer people have an incentive to give you one.
---
where did i say that?
---
Fair Fights are a rarity.
---
if you don't need multiple accounts to do it - why are you replying in a thread explicitly about multiple accounts?
---
What you mean dropping dreads on a t1 exploration frigate isn't fair?
---
Ah ok. Then correction I'm just looking for a fight.
---
Try places in FW space like Amamake for lowsec,
---
 if you are cloaky hunting wormholes it can be hit or miss., may have to travel thru several but there is potential for valuable targets.
---
If you wanna start a fight in nullsec go drop a mobile warp disruptor on a gate in  busy sov space and wait for people to land in it. Or entosis their infrastructure and wait for the inevitable response.
---
A civilisation which develops space flight must also have certain scale terms in order to describe the physics involved in their science. They would have to measure time, length, weigth, and different forces. If we made contact to aliens, we'd probably easy, but tricky answers to question like "How far is your home planet from your sun?"
---
So it's safe to say the empires all developed their own measuring system for exactly the same things with similar subdivisions before they met each other. My guess is; 1 AU has, like many scales in Eve, been standardised by Concord, as 1 AU by Caldari standards would probably vary from a Matari AU. However this 1 AU by Eve standards is probably not an AU in the real world. Same with the G-force.
---
In historical real world context; the most common scale of an inch converted to metric is 25.4 mm, which is the British inch (which became a standard because the British used to have this massive trade empire). There were, however, other countries which also measured in inches also. A Prussian for example inch was 24.01 mm converted to metric.
---
As fun as dying is no its not fair. I  think fair isn't what I meant. I would just like to fight. And can never find anyone.
---
&gt; the expectation that every one has to multibox is unhealthy for the game in my view
---
because ALOT of ppl dont think they have to multibox, they WANT to multibox because its fucking boring otherwise
---
 To be completely honest all these fucking crybabies over doom is actually funny, and probably made his day reading replies to this post.  
---
 Also there are guys that quit long before doom came around that were a lot more abrasive, and trolled much much harder than doom ever did. Only difference is eve isn't contained within its community anymore, and everything doom did was pretty much public (obviously not all), and well documented.   
---
 For example: doom never made a possible recruit jerk off onto a iPad that contained of a picture the ceo's avatar of said corp he was applying to, and post it to forums as a prerequisite to join.  That is just the tip of the iceberg ya fooken kneelers.
---
I only understand the words in half this post so I don't think I can do the last paragraph. I will try the hunting wormholes. Thank you
---
of course it's boring - because it has to be easily multiboxed, because the game has been designed around players owning multiple accounts.
---
which i literally pointed out as a problem in my very first post.
---
We are also disappointed in you. We the small line member. from #34547 to 47554.
---
Buddy, you really are bad at this.
---
of course it's fair, have you compared the price of xl ammo to a heron hull?
---
Just roam lowsec and nullsec, you'll find someone to jump eventually.
---
Yeah I'm pretty sure the heron pilot owes you money.
---
Amamake is a good place for finding low sec pvp.
---
You might want to try to join a corp in FW or that does a lot of small gang roams, you'll get a good understanding of how to find and start good fights and also avoid gank bait.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt matter because you have inherent warp core strength in a super

perhaps but corvettes can be pretty strong if you know how to fit them. Which makes it interesting to see what people will come up with. All in all its more a just for fun and figure out what we're doing type of deal. Once we get a feel for it and get our name out we will be starting up some different rule sets.

please dont let me GET the kill... this happened in an op i was running, was funny as hell cuz it was sleeper PVE, was me and 2 others and our FC was droneslave and he had us locked for spider tank reasons, cycled his guns on one of us and went "oops" swapped his guns off but his drones, and my drones didn't swap targets, was an interesting loss, thankfully if memory serves it was a vni or an ishtar so nothing actually valuable
---
Its been a while since I played eve, but I found the experience a bit lacking.  Sure its a big ship, but it ain't all that grand.  You also probably wont own it.  It will belong to your corp.  Dont think you can dock them either.  You sit on your butt except to gate in ships and then gate back out again.  Maube you doomsday once.  You miss a lot of action.  Most titan pilots are really alts.

Well, I don't see a reason why would a person attack a neutral target if it is pretty much empty. The only thing that attacker will gain is a bit of useless salvage.
---
Wouldn't even need to resub!

It would be extra funny if your own drones were one getting a kill on you from a dronebunny 'oops'

I wonder if your drones will attack you if you have them assisting somebody who attacks you

What can be seen from here:
---
- navy typhoon: killed 1 t1 industrial, 3 t1 frigates, 3 faction frigates, 2 ceptor, 1 AF, 2 t1 destroyers, 2 dictors, 2 t3d, 3 t1 cruisers, 1 faction cruiser, 3 pirate cruisers, 2 HACs, 4 t3c, 2 t1 BC, 1 navy BC, 4 t1 BS

---
- vindicator: 1 t1 frig, 1 ceptor, 1 t1 cruiser
---
- apocalypse: ceptor
---
- barghest: AF
---
- vargur: 1 t1 BS
---
While looking solid, only vargur and barghest qualify for the criteria i mentioned (being somewhat expensive, "1-2b+ cruiser/BC/BS"), and barghest barely makes it there due to being cheap-fit (+ i suppose most of these battleships have empty clones). That's 2 kills last year. Not that many, eh?
---
Drops are sure a problem, navigation is also a problem without an alt. When i sit in a 1b+ cruiser cruiser/BC/BS with HG pod true solo (i have only 1 account), i feel myself confused af as to whether should I jump each gate or not. It's a dice roll, and by jumping into unfavorable conditions you lose 5b easy without any chances without any cynos. With ceptor / CD alt, however, it's completely manageable.
---
Oh, and the only big ship I am not afraid of jumping in these conditions is dominix, which also costs 400m and is flown with empty pod - because I can tank that loss easily with my wallet. But I was not talking about wallet tanking in my post at all.

I am a simple man. I see Heron art, I upvote.
---
I was thinking more along the line of an active high slot that would let you shove a cap through a hole at a cost of wormhole duration. Obviously the hole would probably destab anyway. And rather than this NPC spawn I'd like to see the BlOps polarized on module use and cap polarized on single pass. I'd have a high spool up time on the module so if you hide your BlOps you cant get your cap out quickly. Risk.
---
I actually have no idea, i would assume no however there's only onee way to find out &gt;:D
---
lol, instant classic.
---
Y'all hurry this Eve dying along. Please.
---
Because the raging neckbeards will ddos the server if they can't have 93 alts
---
I find this version of the site easier than the other, though still difficult.
---
1. Drop drones immediately. They'll pull most aggro away from you.
---
2. Burn straight for the gate, and overheat your AB.
---
3. Overheat your shield booster as needed.
---
4. While burning away, shoot at the Blinding Leshaks - the other ships are bigger threats, but you won't be able to target them if the Blindings are still alive.
---
5. Keep an eye on your heat levels so that you don't burn out, and launch replacement drones if needed.
---
6. Pop the can on your way past, but if you're carrying an MTU don't worry about trying to grab the loot, just keep burning for the gate.
---
7. Orbit the gate at 500, or 1000, and launch the MTU if you have one - assess the situation, and orbit the MTU if things are 'fine'.
---
8. During this, your auto-aggro drones will have killed a large proportion of them - hopefully the most dangerous ones - but because of the Blindings, you may be unlucky.
---
9. As they come closer, continue to keep an eye on whether or not you need to/can risk overheating your tank as damage keeps ramping up.
---
10. Kill them all, after taking out the DPS enemies, or just empty the MTU and jump out the gate.
---
Keys to this:
---
1. Stay calm, and focus on getting to the gate.
---
2. Overheat - but don't get distracted, if you burn out your Mids, you're screwed.
---
3. Always have a large battery fitted, preferably a mutated one with good bonuses to capacity and neut resistance.
---
4. Don't try to save your drones, in this room they're disposable - it's that or your ship.
---
My results in this room, to date:
---
4x complete success
---
3x survival, but forced to leave without loot
---
1x death after burning-out my Mids half way to the gate (don't do T5s while sleepy...)
---
My results in the original version:
---
1x complete success
---
4x survival, but forced to leave without loot
---
Kiki should have range control, either the stabber dies due to damage ramp or the Kiki just fucks off and laughs...
---
Their range is still questionable (They are not good for WH eviction defence for example), though otherwise yeah, they are pretty damn good.
---
well yeah the range is not great but they are fast and agile so they can close that range fast,
---
That comment is a bit harsh. It's not just goons.
---
All of the alliances have special snowflakes who don't realise.... Its a fucking game. 
---
Regardless of the meta gaming that goes on. 
---
But people who make personal threats and telling people to kill themselves is completely wrong
---
Not really, a Mach fleet or Barghest fleet has no issues with range on them, they are great offensively, but pretty bad defensively (tbf so are the aforementioned Machs and Barghest comps).
---
Do eve players actually hate SC? I just thought it was all trolling lmao. There is more proof of how the develpment of SC is coming along than any other game ever made.
---
off the top of my head it is 10,000,000M between equator and poles. I am unsure about the other ones.
---
Caravaning through WHs, especially C5 shattereds, is pretty good, not so much in LS (in LS a Carrier is a much better choicee).
---
Most of the game is dead. Will be almost impossible to find fights outside of certain systems.
---
ive never actively had a fight with them yet so dont know that much about them, but that's at lest good to know they just seem like they don't really have any glaring weakness that makes there great bits balanced.  
---
the whole massive dps on full wind up always seem'd a bit to high for me, when they can tank just as well as a normal ship.
---
You didn't even change out the CNN logo, put some more effort into making a proper meme and it will go better next time.
---
Where did he claim people owe him a fair fight?
---
Im not wasting my time watching that but I can see the answer is yes. 
---
Dear Bob...
---
Did I say I disagree with the posts? No. I mean it's always the same posts with the same ideas everyday.
---
&gt;Try places in FW space like Amamake for lowsec,
---
He wanted at least a fight, not a gank.
---
Be in Horde  
---
Alt F5 Discord Pings
---
The other option is to fly out in a single ship and get blobbed 95 percent of the time
---
Be in NC  
---
Alt F5 for good pings all day and brag over good old times on TS2  
---
Finally, a fight promissed  
---
Undock the Keepstar  
---
Jump 40 gates  
---
No fight at all  
---
Dock u..... wait, Keepstar blown
---
No one is stealing this. No
---
My 2 cents... instead of buying a lot of ammo, buy an absolute shit ton of it. Pay a hauler to deliver it for cheap. Much easier and far less frustrating than building it yourself.
---
In fairness goons have their eyes square on NC and PL and not horde space, things can change of coarse
---
Best vid from the past :)
---
Enjoy

Low sec every single ship that is possible to be killed from pod/shuttle to titan and everything in between is fair game, also low sec isn't suicide ganging that is just pvp
---
It is not about fair game, it is about the purpose. People just popping easy and worthless targets as it was their main job. And there are no mentions of suicide ganking: just an overkill on the side of the aggressors.
---
take a ship - any kind of ship - you're willing to lose, set destination to delve, see how far you get. warp blindly onto cynos, take stupid fights, become a beautiful cloud of expanding pixels and make those you meet do the same as much as possible. have fun! do not be afraid of losing that ship. set out to come home via pod express, and aim to pull at least one stupid stunt on the roam. do not be afraid how your killboard looks, you are not your killboard. eve is not the killboard. eve is a game, and games are supposed to be fun, so go find your own fun ;)
---
you can't force the game (or other players) to act according to your expectations. you can however adjust your expectations to be more suitable to the environment you're in. or what meaning your experience has for you. for example, you can roam out and try to find something to kill, landing in a bubble and almost getting someone before his fleet warps in and blaps you. 
---
now, you can either see that as a loss, waste of time, the game is stupid - or, you can see it as: hot damn, i almost had something killed that's out of my league for this ship, and he had to bring in his fleet to save him! awesome!
---
This deserves more upvotes.
---
MSE is for frigs and dds.
---
Small shield extender is really rarely used outside of long range kite frig (ex : railgun harpy), which you really don‚Äôt have pg or cpu to fit proper tank module.
---
Maybe you don‚Äôt fly frig much I guess.
---
You haven't seen overkill yet üòÇüòÇ
---
Has anyone here tried to replicate the calculation of what you get when you reprocess ore?  I built a calculator based on information at [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Reprocessing](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Reprocessing) and [https://forums.eveonline.com/t/what-is-the-new-ore-refining-formula-for-athanor-and-tatara-citadels/38090/25](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/what-is-the-new-ore-refining-formula-for-athanor-and-tatara-citadels/38090/25) but it doesn't quite tie out with what I see in game and the results are bugging me. I get to the same station modifiers and so on, but the final outputs are sometimes a bit higher and sometimes a bit lower.
---
Titanomachy is the name of the battle site at B-R5RB.
---
Its 100% accurate though,  good marketing haha
---
I am aware of that, but a small overkill is still an overkill:)
---
I think I saw destroyer that was under DDs from two titans on the gate somewhere on Youtube.
---
Put it in a book, stick the book in a library, 100 years from now someone will find ‚Äòoriginal art created by one of the first generation EVE Online players‚Äô.

Sounds like something you'd see in delve during peace time

Why waste time playing some washed up wasted potential MMO when you can play better games and bitch on the sub at the same time

It is,  but they only have ustz I believe or it might be eu but outside that one tz it's a ghost town I think they recently joined fw

No one can resist mentioning, in any post here about any subject, that they no longer play the game. Its like some weird internet game voyuerism.
---
That‚Äôs what I was thinking.
---
Now you‚Äôre saying there‚Äôs something called ‚ÄòTheomachy‚Äô? I‚Äôm not saying there isn‚Äôt. I hadn‚Äôt heard about it. I‚Äôm terribly confused.
---
We had a good laugh about it.
---
That's "xXx MrCapacitorRelay xXx" to you
---
yep, that's why i love the drake: it's cheap, it can stand up a little bit under fire (read, it's forgiving to your own mistakes), and might take something with it. i don't expect to win many fights with it, but it's a fun cheap ship for me to fly... and occasionally, i get lucky and a fight (that i never expected to win but took anyway because it's hilarious) goes my way, and i end up with a shiny killmail to brag with on top of the fun :D
---
I am looking to give a try to nestor + astero as i mostly do scanning. It doesn‚Äôt involve big hauling so two ships might be enough.
---
I like how you think.
---
Where do you find people who lose Cruisers to Hecates?
---
If I look at Caldari Cruisers alone - The only one a Hecate could solo is a t1 Osprey (logi).
---
Caracal, Moa, Navy Osprey, Navy Caracal with basic cookie cutter fits all destroy Hecates easily.
---
The reason is your ship blowing up in a swarm of drones looks cool.
---
Everything in low-sec is red, they are either hunting and will attack, or they are avoiding you to do what they are doing.
---
It‚Äôs just about any ship can kill your hauler, so why wouldn‚Äôt they? You might drop something valuable.
---
What are you doing with the hauler? If you are moving your own stuff use courier contracts, I don‚Äôt move anything myself anymore in k-space, saves so much time.
---
A group called Digital Chess Sessions needs at least one citadel named [The Real Folk Blues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Real_Folk_Blues)

You forgot the Reddit alts squad to make sure the enemy's posts never make it past new.
---
No it's not you just have unreasonable expectations or fly unreasonable ships. I fly t1 frigates and get a dozen fights each night around amamake in EUTZ.
---
Thank you! Shame the guy maintaining it before gave up on it. Really nice thing for seeders
---
"but that's different"
---
Maybe we should redeploy to provi and help them.... ü§î
---
Just play eve for like an hour or two every other day or something. I am positive your life is not so busy you can‚Äôt squeeze in a few hours of gaming a week.
---
The Heron is a nice hull. I used to fly Buzzard a lot.
---
Just incorrect. Game is dead unless you go get blobbed in certain specific systems.
---
Raata Sunset is the best SKIN :)
---
God that last point 1000x. Happens in horde so often, it‚Äôs like ‚ÄúMAX MAX MAX DUDERS GET IN WHAT IS THIS A FLEET FOR ANTS????‚Äù and then we brawl goons for 15 minutes over an athanor then bridge home like ????
---
&gt; I mean all they would really have to change was make it so that either you cannot drop a war once your War headquarters has been reinforced
---
That's a solution, but it's not flawless. You could theoretically abuse this by reinforcing your own structure to get a free extra week of war without having to pay for it.
---
Honestly rolling a die to prevent your opponent from doing anything for x seconds should never have been a thing in solo pvp situations.
---
Write a petition to CCP and ask them to limit one client and on character one each computer. MMORPG games should never be multi boxing games
---
all im getting from this propaganda is that both sides are full of cowards
---
Lol if you don't help yourself nothing will happen for you in EVE. This isn't WoW where you can queue up for a dungeon although CCP is trying to appease even people like you with abyssal pvp arenas.
---
Can get officer mods
---
Not really ‚Äòyour‚Äô war when you have literally everyone else fighting it for you...
---
&gt; my empty hauler for 2,5mil ISK was ganked 
---
How would they know it was empty? A hauler is easy target and might be carrying nice amounts of loot.
---
ü¶Ä$11ü¶Ä
---
There are cargo scanners, so people can choose their targets to gain more profit from ganks. Some scanners are even don't alert the target. I guess they had a strategy of "shoot first think later"
---
‚Ä¶.and then there's me with 5 subs.
---
I am soloing a bit in the amarr/minmatar factional warzone, slowly grinding my secstatus through feeding to -5.0. 
---
There are only like 3 active systems and mostly everyone puts more money and brings more friends into the fights then i do. 
---
But sometimes its okay, getting a kill every two days or something.
---
Joining a active pvp corp should give better results, but i heard about small gang roams with content every 2 hours.
---
Maybe its better to join some blobbloc to have fun, i dont know.
---
CCP would never do it , because it would be them shooting themselves in the cock but it would totaly fix a assload of things.
---
Mass Rorq mining dies , mining fleets need to co-operate ( boosting/hauling/mining.) as well as the miner surplus atm
---
People would teach others what to build since their build slots would be limited.
---
Gankers would have to live with consequences of shit sec status and killrights instead of logging on a clean toon and not deal with it
---
Cloaky Camping disappears
---
War dec groups could actually hit nul sec in a meaningful way/nul sec would have to protect trade runs
---
Skill injectors become rare
---
Spyng takes some actual skill and social networking
---
Low sec pirates can't kill everything and need to make deals and have industrialist/miners/trades in their area
---
No more forum posting alts
---
Less scammer spammers in Jita
---
The bit where he expects to find one.
---
You seem to know who he is, so he kind of is....
---
Not true.. Because u can do stuff on other chars while ur cyno alt is sitting 10min on an undock..
---
Black Rise is usually pretty active, it's not easy finding a good fight though, especially if you're solo. There are a lot of small gangs around and of course there's some of us dropping on everything with a pulse. The Area around Oijanen and into BWF is also pretty active, the problem is kinda the same, not easy to find good solo fights. I liked to go to Providence but I haven't been there in a while and no idea how active it is. What you generally can do is look at the map and show "active pilots in space" and just go where lots of people are.
---
Where does he say that?
---
I just tried to do some trading. Following the major advice of "not flying everything that you can't afford to lose" I got industrial gallente ship (there are two, I took the second which is much longer). It had afterburner and cargo expansion in low slot, so the ship is basically a container with engines. I made a few runs through three neighboring regions with spirits and holo things, got a revenue twice as large as my investment + some more. I dumped my cargohold for the last time and headed for Juftvitte, as I suddenly bumped into slasher on the gate between low and highsec, then vexor jumped in and ended me. Boring and unexpectedly stupid course of events, I think.
---
Yea, pls explain to us normal people how that is.
---
Literally the op
---
Wow another amazingly bad idea from /r/eve
---
So so so glad CCP doesn‚Äôt ever listen to this sub
---
Argument against is that the time zones after dt have more anoms to rat than the later US and AU TZs.
---
Seems to be working out just fine.
---
Still filling fleets for structure bashes only?
---
Any FC worth their salt has at least a dual monitor setup.
---
isnt it like 8? i havent been in a null anom in a minute since im not a degenerate but is it unbelievable that there would be more than 8 scramming frigs?
---
Yeah and loving it. its like mining but structures.
---
That's all well and good, until you roam 2 hours and all you see is lp farmers or people baiting for their 10 man gang next door. And that's in the 5% of systems that actually have people in them.
---
I have been jumpcloning to Amamake every few days and have got plenty of 1v1 fights in novice plexes. The only time it wasn't 1v1 was when a guy I killed twice got salty and waited till I fought someone else before joining.
---
only bads cant find solo pvp with one toon. i do it. its great,
---
I unsubbed from eve a few months ago after 11 years of playing
---
Solo WH hunting need high knowkege and some pimp ship, T3c usualy or stratios (but you will miss combat probe).  
---
Try novice plex in FW or newbros friendly NPSI fleet  
---
if you realy want to hunt in WH (witch is the best imo) join un newbros friendly WH to learn the ropes and hunt as a small gang
---
I've gotten a few legit good fights, but I've literally been tackled by a jag at the entrance to a novice to have 2 carriers decloak on my dragoon.
---
Take a note: ‚Äúpvp‚Äù and ‚Äúfair fight‚Äù are very different things. Choose one and then you will have easier time find it.
---
JUST FINISH NOVA.
---
Is the exception the rule?
---
resubbed 3 accounts after hearing you unsubbed
---
Where does it say "owe"?
---
He didn't, I did.
---
Are you fucking illiterate?
---
Why would you assume that he thought he was "owed"?
---
Me too, I rely on others for my cyno.
---
I didn't, that was my very point. People don't owe him a fair fight. Fucking read the conversation.
---
You got killed because you flew a slow defenceless ship through lawless space, you may not get why people are going to shoot you, but they are, learn to fly safer, stick to hi-sec, or use a month to train blockade runners/DSTs.
---
the fact you didnt realise war durations, and structure RF timers, means you havent been wardecced enough. enjoy 6months of this until ccp make a statement about changes in the coming years
---
With the current meta and local, a person in a VNi that is actively playing, such as simply watching local has a pretty minimal chance of being caught. 
---
Throw in things like NEAR2 where they are warned of shit a few systems away and it's impossible to catch a competant VNI ratter.
---
try frigates and destroyers 
---
everything bigger tends to attract gangs and it allows you to run away from most bullshit instead of having to sit through it 
---
once you get a feeling for where you can find fights you can start upshipping but the bigger you go the more likely a gang forms up for it
---
Happy birthday Phear Vyna.
---
The majority of alt jobs are alt jobs because they need next to 0 attention. 
---
Like if we reduced this, like what newbro will take 5 billion to set in a wormhole logged off for the next 2 years? so that kills wormhole seeding as well as farm holes and well about 90% of wormhole space. ( let alone about 75% of characters in wormhole space ).
---
Nobody is gonna want to be an exit cyno for any drop because well you're looking at empty space well-tethered press a button once told, enjoy your gameplay experience. 
---
We need eyes on a gate well your in a frig so you go stay here and tell me if anything happens while the rest of the fleet gets to have fun etc etc.
---
And where did he imply they did?
---
So, when are our Jumpdrives given this kind of jump animation?
---
I want to see more Hulk and less rorqual when roaming in 0.0
---
Well, consider that under the hood, an AU is just a certain distance measured in meters.
---
If you consider the common origin theory, all ships passing the EVE Gates would have navigation systems calibrated based on their origin world, etc etc. Thus, they would have proper measurements in meters, AUs, etc etc
---
Even with the deeper meaning of the unit being lost, it is still a certain number of meters that can be measured.
---
This is what makes eve, eve. Without muti-boxing, the game would be dead to a lot of players.
---
Whats with your jita alt?
---
The bit where he expected to find a fair fight... which he says in the OP
---
We're going in circles here mate, all because you don't seem to be able to read.
---
Come to GE-8JV
---
Reach is coming thus year iirc
---
It's not about the citadel. It's the 2 week immunity for all the wardeced corps that are under that War HQ.
---
Or at least it should be about that but it's clearly broken mechanic and doesn't actually work.
---
Removing skill injectors would be easier, I don't think anyone will be able to farm plex for 100+ accounts without skill farms
---
Ccp isnt. Netease is
---
spicy.
---
I haven't yet unsubbed my accounts, but I'm planning to.
---
This. The nullbears will teach you to only fly in 100% safety and only use a ceptor but it is not good flying.
---
Just dont use alt at all. Lose your solo ship to blobs, gangs, cynos etc... you have to accept the fact that solo is dangerous because solo.
---
But the killmail doesnt lie. When you solo, you solo.
---
Before you didn't have to care about HS wars. They were just an annoyance.
---
I would say anything with a HS system nearby which is 18 to 20 safe jumps away from Jita and 5/6 jumps from Amamake area.
---
Norb's posts are good because they are meant to be funny, not smug. Without the humor it just makes you look like a dick.
---
Also I wouldn't smug post too much about batphone fights. Whatever happens during those fights, everybody knows you didn't *really* have anything to do with the outcome.
---
Reserve that kind of smug posting for when you do something yourself. Like when we took your monitor.
---
and now you do? whats made wardecs any more annoying to live with and just 'ignore'
---
Tama
---
&gt;I don't know about pounds because imperial is stupid
---
Until you realize metric is just as arbitrary as imperial units
---
please don't take away their 'fun' :)
---
how long does it take for a abttleship to get up to maximum warp speed? without implants and no, no a macherial.
---
double that time, and thats where frighters should be,
---
should there be pirate faction frieghters, like angel cartel that can offer warp acceleration bonuses. maybe, but then how usable are these thing your asking for against ganking, sounds like a waste of time as no one in hisec will be able to use them xD
---
Suffer. Think about 13 man gank going around and don't fly kronos in low
---
That was the initial fix of CCP to the R8/R16-slope, as they patched Moonmining to Hisec after Lifeblood when they saw that literally nobody was mining it. For those players in Hisec you are totally right, it would be enough to make it as rewarding as mining a Hisec moon and maybe spice it up with some interesting mechanics.
---
I'm actually kind of surprised TEST showed up for this fight at all, given that their AUZ TZ Legacy coalition mates are responsible for this forti existing in the first place. It's quite possible somebody realized after arriving that the fight was actually about a structure that would have caused some internal headaches if attacked by TEST. Could explain why they held off back from the fight.
---
So-Called-Miners RFed the So-Called-Elite(please)-PvPers WarHQ without PIRAT fleet on grid since they could not risk any of their blingy ships against T1 ships &amp; fleets. So any real fight between PIRAT and a real corp, PIRAT always doomed to lose. That was always the case, and it will be always the case.
---
Amamake
---
So basically you ask CCP to gank all coalition capital for you ?
---
I can‚Äôt say about the rats respawning, since I have no clue. But to my memory, if the site has at least one unhacked can, it won‚Äôt despawn, even after DT. I think it takes about three days for a site that was warped to by a non cloaky ship to actually despawn.
---
Yes, War HQ needed to be tied to a citadel service module and only one module can be online at any given time in entire alliance/corp. So they actually mean something.
---
Unironically this is exactly what happens at the moment. You have carrier blob A on their Keepstar and carrier blob B on the Fortizar, both sending fighters (minions)
---
i love the nestor and nothing to refit to lol
---
try more 25
---
Sakenta - RLCMAK &amp; Ono - RLCMAK. Their new HQs in addition to Piak one.  It is time for wardecced corporations to unite and punch back real hard by killing and RFing all of their HQs with a coalition fleet organized.
---
Didn't SMA disband years ago?
---
fact is, this would have taken at least an hour for rats to burn him down. like, its so oviously a bot here xD
---
Honestly releasing a fps right  now is probably a terrible idea. 
---
If they made Dust decent years back on PC they may have got some players still but now? Doubt it.. 
---
They would have to do something ground breaking to get attention now.
---
did ya record it?
---
Just giving my recent experience with pvp around amamake, didn't actually make any statement whatsoever, at least my comment provided something unlike yours.
---
You want to be close to action but have a good way to get ships there. The spots with more action move around a bit. I'm not familiar with FW to tell you what is going on atm but
---
http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Caldari_VS_Gallente#kills24
---
and
---
http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Amarr_VS_Minmatar#kills24
---
might be helpful.
---
Tama has the most action. But the gate to highsec is usually camped. You could use hauling services to get your stuff there though.Currently it seems that the area around Vlillirier has the most activity besides Tama. If you want to move your ships yourself I'd suggest you stage from highsec. Systems like Ichoriya and Orvolle are closish.
---
Summary:
---
Pleaze CCP make little "elit" pvp alliance a super gigantic tool to kill all titan and super of goons.  And pleaze send more NPC attack people.
---
No injector are not the issue, they have just accellerate the things, and make more newbro enjoy game.
---
Yes citadel mechanic suck ... Let's implement a no tethered for 5 minutes when you warp to a citadel (but you can dock). 
---
No it's notmal if a man with 5 alt in gila get attack by a massive fleet of super and titan he die. Remimber super are anti N+1 mechanic... But they become the N+1 super meta.
---
For PVE: If people want to make incurssion, abyssal it's already exist. Don"t make it mandatory for everyonne, beaca
---
Worst case you counter by cutting your losses and leaving the grid.
---
Yes, maybe everyone was hyped about killing that Keepstar, but to be honest, EVE could use some more factors that might change the outcome of a battle.
---
I am not saying those unpredictable fleets should occur often, but the current meta of "use x = win" is not good for game health in the long run.
---
CCP only needs to remove Skill Extractors. Injectors can stay.
---
I stopped continuing my subs last months after 5 years. Sole reason is a number of shitty design decisions by CCP
---
How do you want to limit that ? YOu already have a limit size in reallity. But you have thing call coalition. Guess what if people want to be friend, they could just create they're own tool .
---
Dunking pre-schools is most of NCPL‚Äôs trackrecord
---
"I don't want put effort to have money, pleaze bring back a mechanic who make isk with no risk for me and my friend". 
---
New moon make you are attackable when you make money. And it avoid a very little group control all moon with a gigantic passive income. 
---
The only PVP playstile eat shit ... and it's good for game. Beacause now you need to have people who farm, and when you farm you are a target and you create content.

And popcorn is not canceled! Many corps has still war against PIRAT and we can still use to bash their structure just to mess with their HQ diversification. PIRAT's motto is to pick people who cannot defend themselves or camping hubs for haulers/industrialists, if you bring fight to them they almost always dock up or escalate to OOC Logi support with T3Cs. So no longer OOC logi is there and hence we can punch their logi safely. And if HiSec corporations cannot unite against PIRAT, forgive me asking this, but what is the point of having corporation ? Stand up, unite against common enemies and punch back!  
---
(Before attacking me about me being sovnul miner, let me say that I spent 3 years in Hisec and I don't have anything against Hisec and still flying around, but I believe if you want to stay in Hisec as a corp you HAVE to learn how to defend yourself and how to cooperate)
---
What's that?
---
Limiting multiboxing in some way i do think needs doing. As it's pretty obscene someone can multibox 40/50 accounts and solo run highsec incursions with them. Same with the guy that has 100+ accounts and cloaky camps entire regions with them. That kind of capability should never be in the hands of single player. It should always take collaboration with real life players to be able to pull that sort of thing off.
---
I'm dev to . And it's mean everything and nothing. If you are only the people who write code to write code you're chief tell is not the same thing as be the guys who imagine mechanics. 
---
So it's why the " my dev point of view" make me laught.

At least this one has some tank ;)

Samanuni ichoriya 7 to 9 j from jita 2j into blackrise.
---
Super can't dock : to late to make the change now. Or you will need to reimbursse a shitons of thing to player. 
---
More over if you start fuck the titan/super you will blap the eve economy. Imagine you make they useless... people will use mineral prod to subcap, and you willl have a shitons of capital more , price will fall. So yes  people who do'nt want to farm will be happy a BS at 40 M will be great.
---
You got me good, there.
---
o/
---
Well, I think there is a thing with my mindset as I don't understand destructive urges of pvp players and looking forward to economy/industry aspect of the game instead of other "fun content" that is regularly mentioned by majority of community.
---
Blockade runners are alpha content (along with cyno and cloacks), and I don't have steady income yet, so I will remain on T1 for the time being. I am thinking about trying ninja wormhole harvesting or exploration with a separate clone. Kind of an alt nomad to fly through the w-space C1-3 and grabbing the fitting sites just to drop loot in k-space later.
---
Nobody will have an even playing field, because what kind of shitry Corp is going to tell their members"oh yea you cant come have fun because it'll be too many guys then".
---
t. Someone who was blapped by our nados
---
I do, and let me tell you, the invasion rats are terrifying. They warp in with upwards of 50 frigates and 20-30 destroyers and cruisers. You need a good fleet to actually hunt them.
---
I play solo..... on no, wait, I do have an alt.
---
Thx ! indeed i was missing this one... however i'll need 43 days of learning for the pre-requiste (reprocessing efficiency and metallurgy). I wonder if it is worthy.
---
Yes.
---
in fairness fromwhat ive seen, goons win the war due to numbers and supers. old news.
---
BUT in each battle, pandemic horde line members have shown more ability and knowledge than the goon fleets lol. literally PURE super Numbers is winning the war for goons. nothing else. 
---
if everything stay as it was, but capitals were removed, goons would be fucked xD
---
at least it's not ruptures with energy neutralizing drones any more
---
yes they am lol, if you have 5-6 then you will not even notice the nerf.
---
The nerf only hurts pp with 1 rorq
---
That's great if that's what you want to do, just don't be upset for others doing what they do.
---
Venture ninja mining and relic frigs can make a lot with a lot of effort, good luck.
---
thx, will probably do that, or find someone in my corp who craft amo and find some arrangement with him
---
Do you know who this was? I'm hoping it was me. I put a lot of effort into shitting up WIX local for like a week.
---
If you can do your own logistics:
---
- Tama, if you can deal with multiple opponents and/or 300+mil frigs
---
- Okkamon if you're more interested in "fair" t1 1v1s
---
If you can't do your own logistics:
---
- Ichoria (used to have a decent pvp market, not sure if that's still there)
---
- Jita, if you're feelig lucky. The tama camp us just 3 jumps out
---
Depends on who you ask. According to CCP, as it turns out, Rorquals are worth more than just about anything. The economy, null-sec power balance, PLEX prices, actual human subscribers... the list goes on. Rorquals are worth more than all of them.
---
/u/ means user
---
  /r/ means sub
---
So they're missing 100k players?
---
Dang
---
I unsubbed 50 accounts after 30 years of playing. Listen to my demands CCP.
---
I honestly couldn't give a fuck about how it integrates into EVE and the idea of space battles being decided by FPS players was always retarded.
---
I just wanted another BF2142. The whole buying/losing gear thing was fresh too.
---
&gt; ast I checked, CCP Dopamine came out explicitly stating that Nova was not cancelled
---
I mean, when everyone considers your game to be cancelled and you have to "explicitly state" it's not then...
---
No smoke without a fire.
---
Wtf kind of logic is just looking at caldari, the faction with the most rlml cancer?
---
And if you had one look at zkill you'd see that the hecate vs t1 cruiser matchup is heavily in favor of the hecate.
---
More importantly, that put all the "ads" in the Captain's Quarters where you couldn't see them.
---
First thing after removing CQ? Fucking gigantic billboards in your hangar advertising cash shops and cringeworthy corp ads.
---
Multiple fleets.  It's glorious.
---
Honestly with all the money they burned on WoD alone they could have rewritten the entire game from zero
---
I'll bite the bullet and throw the hail mary  /u/CCP_Fozzie  \^\^ This
---
Well CCP is paying for it
---
And every time I say EVE should enforce one character per player I get downvoted
---
Maybe we should reduce cyno time then
---
I'm personally more surprised that cva is still trying to remove it after feeding nearly a third of a trillion isk into it so far.
---
Well thank god that you know at least that much.
---
IF you have an umbrella to cover you, hell yes.
---
one is nice to cupp, one is nice to succ
---
Aah, but you have heard of us!
---
Yes you can still kill the citadel but it doesn't stop the wars or give immunity to most of the groups.
---
For one week i went "solo" in a low class shattered my set up was the following
---
1) Alt in an orca ; used to store ships (couple of T3c, sabre, astero,) ammo and so one; always cloaked in a safe
---
2) Scout in a combat T3c; no backup ship for this toon
---
3) Main in another TT3c
---
The difficult part is to find the proper hole :)
---
Now you could kill the cits, end the war and gain 2 week immunity for all the corps that are under that war hq. If it would work like intended of course.
---
I mean trial periods are pretty commonplace even in more casual MMOs. API vetting is what sets EVE apart IMO.
---
Lets be honest i am not a miner - but from what i heard over the years none of those suggested boost will harm the game in any way while providing incentive for people do use them.       
---
Boosting mining barges ORE bay when people are mining in Rorquals in nullsec and orcas in higsec.            
---
Range boost ? Need to rewarp less - lets be honest... who cares except for miners.              
---
Less CPU for mining upgrades? Like ... fit bit more tank - add 1-2 catalysts if you want to gank this guy.               
---
This is not for us, but for people in higsec that are actually into mining and don't want to move to null/low ever.           
---
15% freighter warp speed?      
---
Bulk haulers will upgrade instantly ...  other people as they see the need or opportunity, but overall it will not affect any mechanic.
---
But don't you dare to bring a kite fit, you have to sit still on the gate so they can lock you ...
---
That's why you don't roam in lowsec. Just go to Amamake and other active FW systems, plenty of fights to be had.
---
Guys, a bit offtopic here, but is there any ingame channels regarding nomad lifestyle exists?
---
Just go to those systems then! Plenty of fights to be had. Imo not having to roam is a benefit right now.
---
You are right, they did a full Saranen.
---
Remote armor repairing vexors. Vexors are beasts. They are hands down the strongest tanking, highest DPS t1 cruiser in the game. I personally like to fly them suicide fit. Blasters, light shield tank, warp scram, a damage control and 4 damage mods in the lows. The high DPS tends to catch people off guard.
---
Happy Cake Day!

It was Aryth rubbing his belly, and maybe below ...

Gotchu homes!
---
First off, ever fly buy a mining anom, or money moon pop to see 18 rorqs mining? All with variations of the same name mayhaps? Wonder how much ore is mined by multiboxing several rorqs?  It's a fuck ton, and much of that ore is made into supers, that are quad or quint boxed. 
---
Cut down on amount of clients people can use at once, cut down on the super and titan proliferation. 
---
Cutting those down cuts down on the "need" for skill injectors, and I believe all those being cut back is healthy.
---
It is a relief valve so PanFam doesnt all biomass and leave the game, we wanted them to get a few victories against CVA under their belt.
---
See, things aren't so bad :D
---
inb4 your nados have proteus warped right ontop of them and you lose the lot with no kills
---
Exactly, at current state it will be TQ =  Serenity end of 2020.
---
I mean Goons will still cyclejerk in their patched victory, the rest will have quit long time ago just poking the r/eve saltmines when bored in office ...
---
Nah. Netease paid for the lisence
---
srsly who doesnt test have blued.. or ready to blue at the drop of a hat?
---
Only if you have a super cap umbrella / capital priority so you cant be dunked.  
---
In this case, yes, they are fucking worth it and can pay for themselves really quick... but where is the fun, it's actually worst than winning EvE for me.
---
Outside of T1 frigates (which includes pirate frigs if you want to risk around 100mil with a little bling) and ganking explorers/VNI, there's no easy solo pvp (and even at the height of lowsec, there never really was). Frigates will give you the "fairest" 1v1 experience.
---
You can certainly go in bigger things if you're ready to fight outnumbered. That's a good reason to join lowsec corps and fly/fight other small gangs with them. Much better than F1 monkeying around for a big nullsec corp.
---
Frigate fights are just the easiest way to fight 1v1 where you actually have a good chance of winning. Anything bigger, you'll have to fight frigate/destroyer/cruiser small gangs. Which can certainly be done, you just need very specialized solo fits. Or your own gang.
---
That's the only reason I comment on reddit... its a self fulfilling salt prophecy
---
Hey it is 2019 NCPL found again worthy opponent.      
---
With some bathphones they are KINGS of Providence now!
---
Some stuff I could get behind.
---
wonder what other alliances do that...
---
Yes, you can. I do, and nearly 50 M SP on my main. but if you actually enjoy mining you will enjoy playing with at least one alt. That alt can be usefull once you will reach capital ships, but that's probably in at least 10 months :p
---
I've never played, not even once. I subbed to try and gain a slight understanding of the game before getting into it but the fuck if I know what y'all are going on about.
---
I awoxed one of my own covetors when boosting shields by sending praetors before switching targets. Fight ends, I hear alarm and am frantically trying to find anything hostile so long it dies. Look at km to find out wtf, and saw it was me.
---
Link is in my bio to remind me not to do that again.
---
I did that at one point; it was fun :)
---
Are T5 sites profitable enough to outweigh the chnaces of getting killed and losing a ship/pod. Die once and you're a billion down. How much is the average isk/hour with abyss t5?
---
I did t3s for a little bit and it was more interesting PvE than missions or anoms but just sort of...stopped doing them. Not sure why
---
How would they warp right on top of your nados if they're already all fighting at zero on a gate and you're 70 off?
---
The Agency has is actually useful here! Open your agency window, set your destination to a contested system. Once there, open your probe scanner window and warp to a complex and see what you can find! You'll want to start fighting in a frigate in Novice Complexes (they allow only frigates). Start fighting there and see if you can win!
---
Into the shield super you go, would have lived if it was a bin.
---
That is why Hisec corps should organize and attack all of PIRAT's HQs to give max. damage.
---
never heard of one but maybe we can make something all together
---
First up to be aware this data is trimmed by CCP. On occasion quite heavily.
---
Average - Not sure between the average price of all transactions or the average price of all units. My assumption would be of all units.  
---
Highest/Lowest - The highest and lowest price recorded for that day.
---
Order count - Unsure on this one, I believe it is the number of completed orders during that day.
---
Volume - The number of units transacted during the day.
---
I think the best person to hit up would be Ethan02 from   [https://www.adam4eve.eu](https://www.adam4eve.eu/) 
---
He knows the data from CCP better than anyone I've come across so far. Usually better than CCP I bet.
---
So long as an answer doesn‚Äôt include the name of group in eve then it is the correct answer :).
---
Amamake for sure. There is a public JF service and a decently seeded market.
---
The reason you want to keep some spare cash around is so you can replace the ship you lost.
---
The things EVE politics wins in over real politics is it's nowhere near as dishonest or deceitful and the participants are nowhere near as self interested and are generally way less toxic and much nicer folks.
---
I think there is a decent variety of viable fittings when it comes to Corvettes.
---
The VNI is at just as little risk if he's paying as much attention as a mission runner has to.
---
Wat
---
Same idea, since it quite uniq playstyle and more and more people starting looking into it  
---
Created one: Nomad veche
---
Let it be starting point
---
eve players with a complete lack of irony
---
Ok my assumption is simple 15% warp speed that i am suggesting will have no impact on ANY current mechanic except that will actually reduce your freighter travel time from point A to point B.           
---
My assumption is also that cost of getting such upgrade is below 500mil when you include LP and the LP store fee.         
---
Even more , optimal upgrade should be around 300mil in total - as we want constant demand for this upgrades so higsec people have work.               
---
Lets remember that this content / reward is for higsec dwellers.
---
will join tonight and spread the word.
---
Well i seen one recently in jita, but CCP stated it will be removed as almost no one is running those.
---
... and next NC sotiyo died.            
---
You see what you did!
---
what a joke tama is shit between the near 24/7 gatecamp and often cloaky camped plexs the only reason you'd ever tell a newbro to go there is because you're one of the retards gatecamping/cloaky camping it. (and since you're RDRAW you probably are).
---
Or you know, you can play other games as well? Watch netflix? Admit it, anything is fun but doing these in eve. Ccp is just suckering your wallet and you are okay with it, which begs the question, are you incapable of playing other games or just not bright enough to see what is going on here? You are trying to play an MMO all by yourself. Luckly most people see the wrongness in this and already left. Numbers do not lie. Even a generous 2 account per people would make this game only 15k pcu. We already know it is much lower than that. Pretty sad. Amusing for me to watch though.
---
Does MWD bloom/painters count towards capital neut application?
---
CONDORD LP was a mistake, or should i say ability to exchange it for other LP.
---
You say it like that's some devastating amount of ISK lol
---
At the end of the day we just want to get fights out of these things. Nobody really cares about losing ships as long as we get some action out of it.
---
+1 on everything you said. In Brave myself but have been in Karmafleet as well. Both are great corps to join for newbros.
---
Hi Hilmar, no we are not interested in playing on phones.
---
Same pb here, i lost a lot of pod because my computer lag when the ship explodes
---
I think he's saying that he saw that ad on this sub
---
I do not recommend using rorq with your pp... just sayin
---
it s not for the asset it s the shame to lose their HQ... But it wont happen because they candelled all the war. that is also a shame for them BTW.
---
Not rorquals, alt accounts.
---
PP ? as long as you have an umbrella you am fine, the nerf only hurts if you use 1 rorq once you get 2+ you am printing isk
---
You and me both man, EVEn when I took a year off playing left the subs going for skills xD
---
So hierarchies are good you say? I just skip them and do radiances and independences, much faster.
---
The quote never mentioned a problem, just that the economy and game design are complicated. Which I f\*cking well hope so.
---
In the case of a 5 min activation delay, I'll just leave my cyno burning while I'm out.
---
&gt;Wrong. I know this for a fact because I have seen it many times.
---
Not evidence, citation needed.
---
Fair enough, though I think your losses are getting close to 2.5trillion in total shooting structures since the beginning of the year with pretty much goose egg to show for it.  I do admire the tenacity though.
---
You're right, Tama is probably not a good system for a solo newbro, which I tried to make very clear.
---
What makes you think OP is a newbro, though? If you know what you're doing and have a way to get around the camp, I think you can have a lot if fun in and around Tama, even if you're not in WANGS/SNUFF.
---
Wait, are you advocating for removing jump fatigue again?
---
Thanks! Could you elaborate on trimming, please. Is it just cutting from the beginning or something else? I‚Äôll keep eyes open for missing data.
---
Provi / germinate / Delve / Catch , you will find fair and unfair fight, but you will find a fight for sure.
---
Lmao, Eve has become so disappointing.
---
"being on r/eve to understand the game before going into it"
---
this sub is a trash where blobers and big alliances expose their caps and propaganda through various autistic ways. at least its creative...
---
but i recommand to go on youtube if you want to understand the game...
---
If you run away we just assume you don't want to fight.
---
CNN IS FAKE NEWS
---
It's not as if your side doesn't take losses as well. I have no idea what the numbers actually are, but our fights are rarely overly one-sided in either direction.
---
All these structure bashes are, in the end, about getting content. So whether or not we actually manage to kill whatever random structure we are hitting this time is secondary at best. There's always another structure to take it's place.
---
Only my main is subbed right now. Can't really put the time into the game anymore.
---
No-one likes you.
---
I use to place, but have been winning EVE for three and a half years now.
---
This.  Thinking anyone is irreplaceable in a game is just comical.
---
A 16 year old game isn't going to start growing again because people stop making realistic posts about the game in reddit.   Eve is what it is, and a lot of people have played it over the 16 year history, and there isn't some huge untapped pool of new players that haven't heard of Eve.
---
As older people get tired of waiting for CCP to get their act together, the playerbase is going to dwindle.  Let's face it, MMOs with monthly fees already have strikes against them in this F2P environment, and CCPs history of game management isn't helping things.  If you think the primary problem is "negative attitudes" on reddit, you are sorely mistaken.
---
Nisuwa
---
actually the opposite, it decreased the mass
---
...and link KM after upgrade !
---
That cut deep
---
If you can use a DST you can easily stage in Huola, it‚Äôs like 5 jumps from Amarr and the gate in isn‚Äôt often camped, even if it is Huola has a perk of having a different route than the fastest one that‚Äôs only a couple extra jumps. Also mwd+cloaky and extra stabs will make your dst very hard to catch. 
---
If you don‚Äôt have a DST and can‚Äôt do your own logistics you can stage literally anywhere you want since you‚Äôll likely be using a JF service. In this case I would recommend Amamake or Tama since this is where the action is concentrated for Amarr/Min and Cal/Gal.
---
Be a man. Relog.
---
You relog, tell me how it goes.
---
For solo pvp your best bet would be to join Amarr (highest tier at the moment) so you can support yourself then you go to Cal/Gal WZ and pvp because then you can shoot both sides. Allied Militias have been broken forever it's time someone abuses it so ccp finally fix something.
---
 Amarr also doesn't lock you out of Jita.
---
Yeah that's the entire point of dropping them in the first place, it's been really good for the region; great fun.
---
NO!  YOU relog!  lol  
---
I did and it cleared it on the accounts affected.
---
I tried that first it looks...there's lots of dots and then something large explodes and this makes the dots happy?
---
amarr, come back when your sec status drops below -5
---
Odd, didn't do anything for me on all accounts, even had some corp members try and it didn't fix chat for them either
---
I would recomand apoc with 8 named miner 1 :) way better. after all we are back to 2012
---
Spod; not even once!
---
Carrier / supercarrier is pretty decent to live out of since you have a ship maintenance bay that you can use to store your ships in
---
Haha yes I introduced my son to Eve, he‚Äôs 11, and said let‚Äôs go on a tour of Black Rise. We were in 2 Fed Navy Comets. I told him we might not last long.
---
Boy was I wrong, we roamed for an hour round and round Black Rise and the only ‚Äòfight‚Äô we got was with a bot gating an unfitted condor.
---
Too bad most of those roaming content gets cut off in 9KOE.
---
Half my accounts did not get local. It did take one local with 28 characters logged in a while to load but it did eventually after I relogged. I have noticed a number of things being noticeably slower in-game lately.
---
Practice with t1 cruisers first before you go pirate and then go t2. Imo, t2 isn't as effective as say t1 pirate cruisers. Since it's only the two of you I assume you might want to go with kity stuff like the cynabal. Some honorable mentions include the omen navy issue, the Nosprey, the scythe fleet, the orthrus, .etc.
---
How do cynos work exactly? Let's say I light a cyno, who can jump to it? Could an hostile fleet jump on a cyno?
---
A lot of people commented on my video that it's not 'true solo'.
---
I can do true solo, but not with a ship that valuable and slow.
---
Just one ship can add so much survivability, but at the point where you can afford to fly fits worth multiple billions you can probably afford to plex an alt and train him into a stiletto. I also doubt many people jump into solo PvP with ships that expensive.
---
I don't really like flying true solo, but that doesn't mean it's unfeasible... I think Nightmare is best for solo with an alt, but you can do Barghest full solo if you feel like it due to the ability to screen tackle and point people at range. I certainly have a larger proportion of solo killmails with the barghest because there was no need to tackle it with an alt.
---
tldr: not needed for cheap stuff, but if you fly expensive you probably want to look into an alt
---
Why do people go to the zoo
---
Your corp is not immune for 2 weeks. They dropped war so even the structure is destroyed they can re-dec your corp immediatly tying the war to another structure. And if you cannot band / unite against  PIRAT, they will just continue harrasing your members and your corporations stop functioning w/o members and eventually they will be closed (as it should be if they cannot protect themselves) . Your best bet is to cooperate with other corproations and really hit them hard. But that is the choice of each individual corp to give. Good luck.

Depending on the fit. I had one just like that one, ie, drop right in the middle of the Leshaks. I find it is easier because you can kill one of the Starvings and then kill all the Blinding. I was running firestorm T5 so all the Leshaks had 50% more armor. Had to pop in my blue pill and hardshell though. I had no prop mod 2x large cap batt gila
---
Chringe
---
Yeah, the pve is what matters these days!
---
I did exactly that and did not find a single person throughout the entirety of delve. Every time i entered a system, the ratting vnis/ishtars would warp to their dock. I landed on a few athanors where the miners would be midwarp between the moon rocks and their safe athanor (a mere 200km away). Eventually, I killed some guy who was afk in his travel interceptor. When I left the pocket I found him in, I was greeted with around 20 people camping me in ready to kill my destroyer.

wrong game

&gt;Such as players buying supercapitals and the skills and then it being nerfed for the sake of a healthier game.
---
How is it not a problem?
---
&gt;In the case of a 5 min activation delay, I'll just leave my cyno burning while I'm out.
---
How do you drop on people instantly with a 5 min delay?
---
&gt;Not evidence, citation needed.

I'm the source. There are other post pointing out the same thing.
---
Keep up the good work!
---
Thats funny. Dead game is an advantage now!
---
Eve nullsec needs a fucking big shake up and this would be included in sed shake up.
---
As far as i know you can find good dread fits at 800/900M
---
And a good carrier fit at 1.5b
---
You said what you said. You can go to goon space and get dropped on as well. Not really "content", but you do get a "fight".
---
Then you haven't been trying to engage something. I roam black rise primarily and get lots of fights.
---
&gt;anything more than a minor change is going to require pulling the feature entirely
---
which, if CCP gave a fuck, would be exactly what they should do.
---
just imagine being your corps cyno bitch.
---
Looks amazing. Do you know where I can get the black variant? I've been trying to spice up the sex life for a while.
---
strange, i always found content - though i usually found enough of it on the way to delve; the one time i actually got there, we had a nice little 3-way fight on a gate
---
Oh god, the OPs statement are just so flawed...
---
1) "Our current numbers are based on superflous alts, so it makes no difference to gameplay if they go." - just lol, probably most (not all though) alts are either subscribed or plexed. Especially if you live in nullsec there is no point in having alts if you can't log them in at the same time.
---
2) "Yes every cap pilot needs an alt. But do they?" - OP probably doesn't use caps often. Cap warfare is mostly being logged off and waiting for the login call or just sitting in a fortizar and waiting for the undock call. Guess what - the call to do it often doesn't come at all. So if you have only 1 pilot and you choose to be a cap pilot your playing experience can be summed up as - i'm just waiting around for something to happen.
---
3) "This would bring more employment and therefore more retention to the game." - no, its the exact opposite. There will be less characters online and probably less people online too.
---
Eve in its core is built to be multiboxed in most respects of the game. E.g. skills - wanna train both subcap doctrines, capital doctrines AND a titan? lol, see ya in 10 years. Most capital doctrines take like 1.5-2 years of training time, titans will be more. Even subcap doctrines can take months. What if you want to do some industry in the mix? Also fleet roles - I already mentioned capitals just sitting and waiting, but its true for other things as well. For example cynos, scouts, cloaky campers, trading alts, JF alts etc.
---
RvB is getting new people daily and isn't a ghost town anymore for americans. from 4:00pm - 2am daily there's at least a small fleet.
---
WOAH :O
---
It's not dead, just go to the couple of lowsec systems that are active and you'll find fights. There's no superpower that's going to drop caps on your little frigate, you can roam the system and fight whatever you want and often get 1v1 fights. You don't have to roam 30+ systems in null to maybe find a fight, or get supers dropped on you.
---
Nice butt plug breh
---
Its fucking dead, mate. You can self-destruct and get a better fight.
---
&gt;How is it not a problem?
---
That's your opinion, nothing in that quote says CCP thought the same.
---
&gt;How do you drop on people instantly with a 5 min delay?
---
I'm confused, you want to give the hunters a 5 min delay?
---
&gt;I'm the source. There are other post pointing out the same thing.
---
Still not evidence, that's called an anecdote. And as we all know the plural of anecdote isn't evidence.
---
Keep the meme alive and you may yet kill this game.
---
Yes, eve is dead, congrats
---
&gt;That's your opinion, nothing in that quote says CCP thought the same.
---
That is a quote from CCP. Explain how it is not a problem.
---
&gt;I'm confused, you want to give the hunters a 5 min delay?
---
When activated, it takes 5 minutes for anybody to jump to it.
---
&gt;Still not evidence, that's called an anecdote. And as we all know the plural of anecdote isn't evidence.
---
So when you see something all the time, it is not actually there? Other players see the same thing, but its not happening?
---
What evidence beyond that do you think you can get?
---
No one is paying attention to the wording of the post, "Free new expansion" really sounds like paid DLCs are right around the corner...
---
All time low since last summer?
---
Most systems are empty, so people will quit.
---
Could you imagine something as cool as vtm:b-meets-eve?
---
:(
---
Tbh create an alpha and try it... Little dots is only one view that most people use because it provides the most tactical information, EVE is much more than only that
---
Yeah, these idiots actually believe getting blobbed to fuck is something one would go back to again and again.
---
I used to play but I gave my account to my wife's son.
---
You know what, I'm going to, as soon as I get bored of Hell Let Loose.
---
Until you realize that 90% of the world is using metric and only a few countries won't adapt
---
&gt;If you know what you're doing and have a way to get around the camp
---
How is that gonna happen? He wont even know if there is a camp. Its a fucking gamble.
---
What system you start from doesn't really matter for exploration as you will be moving around a lot. You can do this in a nomadic way quite well. For the start learn the hacking game until it does not require all your attention, then move to LowSec for a bit better loot and lern to avoid being ganked. After that its wormholes or Null.
---
If you are interested in exploration and don't mind not being allowed to initiate PVP, have a look at [Signal Cartel](https://www.signalcartel.com/).     
---
EveUni is still a thing and just like with every university the bureaucracy takes its time. Last time I was in Solitude (Nov '18) the campus [looked quite alive](https://i.imgur.com/4Py2Kng.png).

---
I never heard anyone bring ANY change (new stuff) that brought more positive feedback than abyssal stuff
---
god damnit I was hovering over the Avatar's name during screen shot, now there is an annoying "*Detail for nnnn...*" in my snapshot, I'm so triggered by my own post now.
---
Bad dragon my friend the spikes add spice üëåüèº
---
So who cares about most systems? The FW warfare ones like Amamake are still alive and kicking. Saying it's dead implies that nobody is there and that's simply wrong.
---
You should take that chance to delete it and never post again.
---
So telling others to go kill themselves in front of a huge audience is okay now?
---
Alright, please go kill yourself.
---
so you saying the nerf gets less with more rorqs mining? Teach me how 20% less income with 1 alt is less hurtfull then 20% less income with 5 alts, master
---
you realized he asked about "resource wars", so he clearly was after PVE.
---
and abyssal PVP is not really a PVE thing. 
---
Honestly, I don't do abyssal PVP either, for one main reason: there are few guys that sit in their ultrablinged ship that you might defeat with a perfect countere every 10-20 times (not ultrablinged). I ain't got no time for this. But who made it like this? The players with these blinged 2bn ships. Could CCP do it differently? Yes, but then once again, they would "destroy the open world sandbox"... And all PIRATE-like idiots are crying why there is no content...
---
Enjoy the better game!
---
I‚Äôve found plenty of genuine solo kills in Tama.
---
Same but I‚Äôm not new to solo PvP and I actually know what to look out for, punisher in the medium hard pass. But someone new to it will not (and if he‚Äôs not got a JF or scout alt will probably die passing thru from nourv)
---
wow very cool!!!!!
---
How do russians talk about ISK amounts?
---
well when l'm on my laptop and l mine with 1 rorq its a bit sad, but when l mine with my 11 rorqs l kinda don't see the nerf to much. but that's me when not at war l'm printing isk even when l'm only flying 1 rorq ;)
---
And i thought Goons are losing :(
---
&gt;if you try and avoid blobbed we just assume you dont want to fight.
---
ftfy
---
In rubles
---
I dont think you understand..... dude
---
This would be a serious nerf to cloaky hunters in null sec.
---
One sys gets stale. Always fighting the same blob/bullshit is boring.
---
This is honestly not bad, I just wish there was another way to modify the fittings that doesn't need to use EFT. A drag and drop tool, or something like pyfa.
---
Cynosure fields are a highslot module that have a long cycle time, and require Liquid Ozone to be light up. For an incoming capital vessel to jump on your cyno, it forcibly NEED to be in the same fleet as you, which mean hostiles cannot jump on your cyno, and vice-versa.
---
It's unlikely nullsec ratters will suddenly start running lvl4's. You can't run as many concurrently as you can semi afk vni rat
---
If you "orbit" or "Keep at range", you are by definition technically not running away, no matter the orbit/keep-at-range-distance.
---
Just because dunk is a fun dude it does not make anything he says about kiting true ...
---
They should just make a Battle Royale in Eve Online already :P :P
---
Nah they've been using that for a while, I always assumed it was a dig at WoW and EQ's $50 content upgrades after you bought the original game. Pretty sure they've been hyping free expansions since launch practically.
---
what is this utter tripe?
---
Jumping on a cyno can only be done with a cap (or Cov Ops Battleship with a covert cyno that creates a jump portal)? I know that cynos show up in system on the overview, so can you jump on them in system even if you're not in fleet?
---
1) Literally the economy would crash. 
---
2) Anyone who builds anything of value would quit
---
3) Game would turn into T1 online. No more T2 stuff
---
Everyday at downtime, player count is super low.
---
only people in your fleet can jump to it. I believe there is an exception with cyno tower (don't remember the name) that are deployable, but I don't know enougth about that
---
time to go to Branch
---
I know right, like imagine an artist doing his job and making skins instead of like, doing a developer's job and trying to make fixes. It's weird that those two things can't happen at the same time lol!
---
yikes someone is salty
---
If only we could inject this shit direct into veins by pressing f
---
what am i salty at?
---
When they do it, you'll have to plex them as moon skins. Maybe you'll get lucky and get an exoplanet hunter moon texture pack that's the old pepsi logo.

online posts
---
this could have been a decent post but your misplaced anger soured it
---
also well done on reading the entire post and forming an opinion in &lt;10 seconds, you must have a high iq
---
If he did dc, does CCP srp supers through tickets?
---
Yes, every Capital ship (with the exception of T1 freighter) have a Jump drive that can lock on cynosural fields light up by a fleet mate. I don‚Äôt know how Black Ops jump drives work, however.
---
Also, you can‚Äôt jump to a cyno in the same system as you are.
---
Theyl still be draged into fights
---
This just gave me an idea. I have no kills on my killboard after a few years of playing. Maybe I should just create an alt and kill it to get something on there.
---
Remember kids, killboard stats don't matter unless it fits your narrative.
---
But how bad player could spin they looze beacause they do'nt have golden ammo if they can't make an eve is dead post ?
---
Goons still heavly out number they can just chuck and everyone in a frigate and *swarm* (pun intended)
---
&gt;also well done on reading the entire post and forming an opinion in &lt;10 seconds, you must have a high iq
---
You really think such a simple plost requires &gt; 10 seconds to form an opinion on?
---
Stockin is gay.
---
this guy is 100% not allied or in Pandemic Horde.
---
Miss you bby
---
unfortunatly. they cant.
---
because when they do sub cap vs sub cap. they loose TERRABLY
---
through the entire ongoing fighting, everytime NC. and Panfm could attack without being directly droppable immediatly they fought, and won with outstanding isk efficiancy. countless times i would personally join ALL timezone fights in my eagle/dictro/munin/bomber/ferox and absolutly wipe the floor with goon subs. they use subs purly to feed until capital assistance arrives. and if its a cyno jammed system. they failed everytime. or did not push into one until ncpl basicly wasnt there
---
Already on v3 mate v4 will vibrate and spin
---
correct. i am in NC.
---
less than 10 seconds after the post was submitted, he read the entire thing, then typed up a response and then clicked save, that is very impressive!
---
Heh heh, I'm skiving from work and browsing reddit in the smoking hut :3
---
This is healthy for the game. They need to do this with all content in eve. Sure you need a small amount of solo content, but people quit eve because it's a horrible game to experience alone placing other players into contact with each other is exactly how CCP can build and retain a customer base larger than the existing one.
---
haven't played in years, but I guess enjoy the inevitable goon hugs
---
I wonder if it will come to a point where the Triglavians will start launching absolutely massive invasion fleets that would require entire coalitions to work together to defeat.
---
That would be amazing I think.
---
Smelt like you are salty beacause you was preparing an eve is dead post and he play "coutnerpost" before
---
Eh i just woke and im still not complete so ill take your judgment but what about init they managed to fuck hardknocks out of theyr hole
---
im proud to be in NC. and i laugh at you for being in goons.
---
all my eve life ive wanted to fight not blob :D so for the war who did i join? not goons, i didnt stay in lowsec trolling the locals. i joined the loosing side. because i got balls :)
---
You can kite them fairly easy.
---
Boson lubricant as well.
---
&gt;since op has no independent thought
---
Ironic.
---
ffs int midsummer, who is staying home and sit by the computer on midsummer??????
---
Can confirm this. Fleets in the general range of 5 to 15. Typically cruisers down. Fleet comps are loose in most cases. Newbie friendly.
---
Almost always good content every fleet.
---
hard who?
---
sorry is innit goons? i actually have a small amount of respect for innit, i was in innit once, didnt like it completly myself. but i respect the fact that once every few months they have a good plan or idea. moreso than just a small tactical choice.
---
however they let themselfs down by being pets of goons. and not freestanding and doing the honorabru thing and join the underdog side in all cases. :D if a group does that non stop. id join them
---
For example?
---
last summer average was 30k so around twice what we have last couple days
---
i don't understand why it's hard to grasp that i can read that post within the 60 seconds of you posting it
---
maybe... Faction Excavators? xD
---
&gt;and i am aware this thread is against the norm and this is reddit
---
You're not going against the norm like you think you are. There's a lot of retards here that genuinely think the game is fine and people just choose to play in boring ways.
---
Hard knocks the guys who had fortnox init planned that and theyr in imperium so basically goons
---
jUsT MaKe tHe BiG bOoM maKe bAd cApiTaL go BoOm

Orvolle is solid. And you occasionally get good fights in PF.
---
im sad the rorq didn't get the final blow
---
BLOPS work the same way as any other jump capable vessel, and their 'covert portal generator', or bridge, works the same way as a titan bridge, meaning they can jump or bridge to any fleet cyno within their range, which is 8ly at JDC V. The important distinction is that they can *additionally* jump to covert cynos, unlike other ships. Covert cynos are different in that they last 1 minute instead of 10 minutes, and they can't be seen on overview throughout the system, so enemies don't automatically get a convenient warp point.

I‚Äôm telling you what happened. Not what you think happened. And this was 2 months ago.

XD i need more sleep
---
For Vlillirier (which does always seem to be insanely busy) Orvolle isn't far away. Not a bad market and 7 jumps from Dodixie.
---
this is funny because I was actually part of a large NC ally with LAWN and some others up north, but then one day we got merged into a new Goon-backed alliance. I got access to Better Jita and kinda just stayed in WHs.
---
to be honest, i saw your bee flair, and thought about a new shitpost.
---
then i read it.
---
see ? it only took one second to know what its about
---
The current ansiblec cynosural generators work using an access control list (or ACL). Player structures work the same way - the owner of the structure can create a list of all entities they would like to be able to dock there. So with a cyno generator, you can select which entities can use that cyno. As long as you're on the ACL for that generator, you will always be able to jump to it if you're within range, regardless of which fleet you are in.
---
&gt; less than 10 seconds after the post was submitted, he read the entire thing, then typed up a response and then clicked save, that is very impressive!
---
You think thats impressive... wow.
---
sorry, i was referring them to nobodys. i was full aware they were someone once. rulers of the 'im a wormholer btw' no ones who never come out to play in the real mechanics.
---
goodnight
---
A lot of my recent KB stats are small gang. I have videos of most of my solo battleship fights.
---
Typhoon FI (these were all around 800m in their armor versions): 
---
https://youtu.be/uaNXlbCblgg
---
RNI video which at the time were around 500m just for the hull. Total fit was 600-700m:
---
https://youtu.be/w4BeyL-7kR0
---
Golem (1.9b iirc): 
---
https://youtu.be/tifGqFZJ_9M
---
All of my torpedo ships and breakdowns of fits (~200m to 1b):
---
https://youtu.be/q51vswj18f0
---
On navy BS, its the same payout as t1 insurance. So on the tyfi for example, i was not breaking even in the slightest after insurance or "wallet tanking". And if you consider 800m wallet tanking, and 1b not, 200m is a pittance in comparison.
---
Anyway, not everyone needs to fly a 5b ship on every roam. Im talking about players that see solo videos or talk about solo and people pipe up saying you need alts to fly around in a hyperion or other cheap-ish ships. 
---
Sure, in extreme cases where youre flying around in a 5b ship and 1.5b pod, it makes sense, but that is an outlier and not everyone is talking about solo involving 5b ships. Most normal solo in battleships/BCs and cruisers does not *need* an alt.
---
no because eve is ded post is like supers, cant be coutner
---
Shhhhit...oh well...
---
Who cares?

Man that would be the dream. I still hope high sec is the test bed. Then they push to 0.0 with real invasion. Shit that will actually threaten fortizars... require caps...etc. what drifters should have been

those titan fits you used are not slaved/linked/pheon'd

sry did read this before posting my own comment above

you should change ur flair to bee

it makes reddit a lot more fun

Hmm it would be be interesting to put in PI calculations

it was literally 10 seconds

you got me there hue hue

i dont have to

i want to
---
Maybe, if we get the mechanics right, we can have huge quantities of them live in close proximity in one small area with no need of the rest of the map.
---
For 5-20 minutes every day eve has no players on it, it's the end of the game panic!
---
Paint it!
---
!RemindMe 8 days
---
Great work best of luck
---
I need advanced level of games workshop level nerd to paint it as other times have failed horribly ..
---
Keep looking.  There are always good groups out there.  Some might be smaller than others.
---
If you really want to find a fight, skill up anchoring so you can anchor mobile warp disruptors (bubble). Look at the map and find a hot spot for Jumps in the last hour. 
---
Anchor a bubble 100km in front or behind the line straight between two gates and wait nearby. Someone will land in the bubble. Engage. Maybe profit, probably lose. Try again. 
---
I gate camped PF for quite some time and it was my initiation into non-consensual pvp the other way, rather than being the one getting shot at first. 
---
Other than that, lowsec Vlillirier is almost always busy with frigate fights. Probably the best place to go to almost guarantee an engagement.

|-|-|-|-|-|-|
---
Ok, just to recap.
---
You said injectors are a problem for cap proliferation. With a quote from CCP as 'evidence'.
---
Problem is that in that quote CCP doesn't call it a problem. They mention it's complicated, which it is. Nowhere does it say they consider this a problem.
---
You suggested making a 5 min delay before you can jump to a cyno. Why I'm not sure and you seem to be inconsistent in the implementation. Would that only be for the 'defender' or also for the 'hunters'? Also if I keep my cyno permanently cycling people could continuously jump to me or would you also want a re-activation delay?
---
On the issue of auto-banning bots you mentioned anecdotal 'evidence'. Things you see might not be there but that's something you should discuss with a professional. 
---
&gt;So when you see something all the time, it is not actually there? Other players see the same thing, but its not happening?
---
But let's assume what you see is there. What exactly do you see? 'Bot-like' behaviour isn't botting. Many people seeing something and believing something about that doesn't make it true. As I said, the plural of anecdote isn't evidence.
---
&gt;What evidence beyond that do you think you can get?
---
As has been discussed and admitted by hunters on this subreddit many times before it's impossible to determine the difference between a bot and just a stupid player.
---
So I would want hard proof, probably CCP would be the only one that can supply that, that someone is actually a bot. If he/she is ban them, if not let them go.
---
All of us?
---
Or you engage a dude 1v1 and the cloaky mother fucker waiting nearby pops you.
---
I mean you almost lost your hands.
---
Oh, I don't think so...
---
This sounds to me like the same shit they did as you activated the gate to get out with 15s left and then you died during warp Tunnel... Then a few month later they changed this because so many people told them this is bullshit... In your case i would tell them to forward the Ticket direct to another GM and if you get the same answer then please next GM, only this way you can bring this into discuss from them.
---
Very cool post!
---
&lt;3
---
haha yes literally, definitely!
---
Ah come on now, we're passed the gay jokes, it's all about his massive forehead now
---
Forcing group content for pve activity would basically end eve.  Antisocial pve nerds comprise a very significant part of the games playerbase.
---
I would argue that toxic people like him drove more people away so i disagree. I know a fair few alliance members quit cause certain individuals killed the joy for them over time.
---
He will not be missed.
---
havent played in well over a year,  ever since i fooled myself that the game would be fun last time around :&gt;
---
I have been thinking about that too. Triglavian ships seem pretty nice and cheaper than T2 logi. What are their advantages? DPS and neuts?
---
yes, that's what I was talking about, thank you ! So it works with a whitelist then. Good to know
---
thanks provibloc for the good fites over the last few weeks, hope to see you bare your teeth at some point and congrats on the new keepstar
---
Yeah i have been seeing a lot of suggestions for pirate ships. I fit a Vigilant in pyfa and it has more tank and dps than the sacrilege, though not nearly as much range. I hear the rail Vigilant is pretty good as well
---
Second timenthis was suggested. I will check it out. I watched a video of a guy in null with rails equipped. Looked awesome.
---
&gt;You said injectors are a problem for cap proliferation. With a quote from CCP as 'evidence'.
---
Doubt I used that word. People injecting caps is a problem. The CCP quote was to reinforce the obvious.
---
&gt;Nowhere does it say they consider this a problem.
---
&gt;Such as players buying supercapitals and the skills and then **it being nerfed for the sake of a healthier game**.
---
If its not a problem, why do they have to be nerfed for "the sake of a healthier game"? Do you agree the health of the game is important? So when something fucks with it, there is a problem, right?
---
&gt;You suggested making a 5 min delay before you can jump to a cyno. Why I'm not sure and you seem to be inconsistent in the implementation. 
---
No inconsistency. There is a 5 min delay before it can be used. Can you tell me how you would circumvent this?
---
&gt;But let's assume what you see is there. What exactly do you see? 'Bot-like' behaviour isn't botting. Many people seeing something and believing something about that doesn't make it true. As I said, the plural of anecdote isn't evidence.
---
I see the same toons doing the same thing for long periods of time. This is what other players also see. Bot-like behavior is botting 9/10.
---
&gt;Many people seeing something and believing something about that doesn't make it true. As I said, the plural of anecdote isn't evidence.
---
Given some time, its easy to spot a bot.
---
&gt;As has been discussed and admitted by hunters on this subreddit many times before it's impossible to determine the difference between a bot and just a stupid player.
---
The consensus is that it is easy and that is correct. No human is capable of not sleeping for months at a time.
---
What evidence do you think is available that would convince you?
---
I've played when peak was 3000 players. Get over your self.
---
i am returning the thanks. most of the fights between us have been fun so far. eve would be boring without you in it.
---
Happy Birthday Phear!
---
Almost 44k people it seems
---
Do you fit them with cap transfer mods? I saw a fit like that but didnt see the point since the vexor doesnt have transfer bonuses.
---
Ok, so I am currently considering returning with my main (I resub and alt account to try and fail station trading), and I was thinking about about the new trig invasion mechanics :
---
- how does it work exactly ? like incursions ? Are there currently any organized  group running those ? 
---
- is it only in hsec ?
---
- I heard the rewards were shit ( no bounties or lp) and there is only salvage and loot. Am I better off trying to ninja salvage/loot the invasion runners ? ( that is incidentally what I was doing when I started the game with hsec missions runners. And I loved it. Not many isk, but the salt was flowing :p )
---
Since 2013 at least.
---
Cuz on rorq alts you not onlz mine but also extract anz additional skill points.
---
Yep. Pretty much, though the dots are in fact little squares, and there can be as few as one of them.
---
I see, must have been a rich experience.
---
New alliances never owned the old moons either. The current way atleast allows local groups to own their nearby high value moons or camp/ninja mine hostile moons. The old passive way created far less content as it didn't require people to be out in space actively mining at all.
---
What has nothing to do with the Mining nerf
---
Imagine making a new account just to post such a retarded comment - found the Wyvern pilot?
---
Not to mention the fact that eve is more than flying from station to station!
---
Fly to Geminate, you will find a fight,if not, fly to BWF, harass people on Oijananen gate, you will find a fight, may or may not be fair tho or just join The Pandemic Horde
---
IIRC Blackrise area is a good space for your pvp/small scale fleets.
---
I think it would be a great change or at least some sort of delay, perhaps when you decloak you show in local? Never going to happen though :( Thinking about moving into a WH
---
Obviously navy ships would win. And a Caracal or rail moa would not win if the fight started at 0.
---
The current number of anoms generated per upgrade level is ridiculously strong. It should be 1 anom per level with truesec having a much greater impact on what quality of anoms you get. Or keep the current number and just add longer respawn timers.
---
Good luck for the future mate !
---
&gt;Doubt I used that word. People injecting caps is a problem. The CCP quote was to reinforce the obvious.
---
And we're back at your opinion.
---
&gt;If its not a problem, why do they have to be nerfed for "the sake of a healthier game"? Do you agree the health of the game is important? So when something fucks with it, there is a problem, right?
---
I do agree the health of the game is important but how to make it 'healthier' we might disagree on.
---
&gt;No inconsistency. There is a 5 min delay before it can be used. Can you tell me how you would circumvent this?
---
Literally answered in the post you responded to:
---
&gt;if I keep my cyno permanently cycling people could continuously jump to me or would you also want a re-activation delay?
---
&gt;I see the same toons doing the same thing for long periods of time. This is what other players also see. Bot-like behavior is botting 9/10.
---
AFK VNI ratting while paying attention to local is nearly indistinguishable from botting. Does that mean we should make ratting more involved, sure. Although bots will find a way to bot that quickly. 
---
Also cool, get back to me when you are the 1 in 10.
---
&gt;The consensus is that it is easy and that is correct. No human is capable of not sleeping for months at a time.  
---
&gt;What evidence do you think is available that would convince you?
---
The consensus is that it's nearly impossible. And unless you also didn't sleep for months it's impossible to know they are out there for months 23,5/7, btw which if acted on will only lead to the bots randomizing their 'up-time'.
---
Evidence is extremely difficult since I guess even CCP would have trouble 100% proving someone is a bot purely based on their 'up-time' ratting. They can however see into where the gained ISK is going and I think based on that you can make a much more grounded assumption about some VNI being a bot or a player.
---
before all these citadels I used an orca in wh for my pve.   
---
you could (if in nullsec) get a carrier with your pvp ships, and go out on hunting. or scan a WH to hunt on other side of the galaxy
---
:justpost:
---
Excavators are Faction. 
---
Maybe T1
---
Evernus is dead
---
Yeah, but it‚Äôs not foolproof. I died to a dualprop stork, which is normally a fight I‚Äôd win easily, and that‚Äôs why I included it
---
i think only if it's a server problem, i.e not beacuse of his internet. Worth trying though, worst comes they say no.
---
wow thats so cheap i'd consider soloing in one, wherea re you getting em?
---
No. You take the peak one time and the lows of another time. The average of last summer (around the same time) of the year was 22k, now its 20k. Thats a decline of not even 10%, far away from 50%.
---
Key word being piracy.
---
Not really like what is being desceibed here.
---
Get into TEST or Goon buy it cheap then leave :p
---
oh so it's per level.. okay nevermind
---
For most those are probably too dangerous.
---
remove local
---
A super titan with a built in gate it looks like.
---
Oh, you Mean the cyno takes 5 minutes to start?
---
That hurts hunters more than it hurts the supercap fleets.
---
Hate? It's one of the biggest jokes we know. Remember that the game was supposed to be released 5 years ago?
---
But that's still player made security, not game enforced security.
---
Whew. Brutal.
---
yeah they really stepped up, declared a big initiative by surprise and just tore them a new one. crazy, I wonder if they will go attack imperium the same way
---
It's was actually pretty awesome.
---
Ok
---
I do know that the highs and lows are trimmed to exclude extreme values (people who sell Plex for 1 isk or buy for 3 billion for instance), however I don't think it's done live (as in the extremes might be shown for a few hours, but then be excluded).
---
Nothing to see here, just a garbage post
---
Didn't skillu self destruct all their Sov structures?
---
it doesn't matter how much people hate on ccp or eve, i still personally love the game and it's still the best space game i have ever played in my life.
---
(‚óï‚Äø‚óï‚úø)
---
D: I just thought it was cool to see a battle venture group take out something relatively expensive
---
meh
---
It's true. I unsubbed in 2012 and I'm still here.
---
‚äÇ(„ÉªÔπè„Éª‚äÇ)
---
Probably way too much credit
---
Never ever ever never autopilot any ship you don't want blown up.  Even in high sec.
---
This is a great thread. Bravo.
---
It wasn't, he was punished... but you're conflating a mistake of judgment within the context of a joke of a presentation and an actual legitimate crime that went well past the moment of rage.   
---
One is bad, the other is objectively worse.  Ethically, morally, and legally.
---
Maybe you should waste your time, it actually doesn't even look bad this time (at least lightyears better than the cancer that was War of Ascension)
---
They declared their world ark as their HQ instead. They don't even have to bother timezone tanking their HQ, just teleport it out each time.
---
See, something like this might actually get me to log in again.
---
I don't have time to sit around for 2 hours hoping for a fight only to get blue balled because the fight never happens.
---
Yes. The intention is to get rid of drops.
---
Wrong. Pure propaganda-filth. The Skillu fleets were obliterated with the full force of the Huang He and providence behind the shining imperial fleet. The American cannot rebel against the river flow of history, laowai.
---
thanks goons for doing our spring cleaning for us! tribute and vale are looking a lot tidier now!
---
Oh, you working at CCP?
---
This isnt expensive
---
&gt; and i am aware this thread is against the norm and this is reddit (which is a terrible platform for useful discussion) so it will be downvoted and forgotten, or possibly removed by mods, who really knows. 
---
r/notlikeothergirls
---
Forehead for days.
---
Come back when the battle venture fleet murders an aeon for the MEMES.
---
You would have to be producing a lot of ammo for that investment to pay for itself.  Just consider the sp needed in terms of injectors and isk.  Then consider how much ammo you would been to produce in order to recoup that loss.
---
Sp needed for skill = x amount of injectors = y amount of isk.
---
Judging from that grammar, FW is indeed dead
---
it's a popular gameplay at the moment, NCPL are embracing it as much as they can.
---
I love that every day is phear vyna's birthday.
---
Yes, eventually that problem will be fixed and you know it.
---
I stopped playing 2016 or so after playing 13 years. I play other MMOs and have much more fun. But because of my history in Eve I still stay in this sub - as Eve was my first MMORPG and one of the most played ones, not to mention working with CCP Games was amazing (never seen so funny, awesome and passionate people working for gaming industry as were those people there). I will forever love Eve Online and CCP Games.
---
Man, these threads are getting old soooooooo quick.
---
intellectuals HATE him
---
wait so RvB doesn't fight eachother anymore?
---
also 1 oldschool BS fight doesn't mean the game is in a good place lmao, but I'm glad you had fun
---
Ditto. But not playing Eve tho
---
It‚Äôs kinda expensive for a new player and relative to the cost of the fleet
---
I wouldnt play this game if i were forcibly limited to one account.  I imagine a lot of other people feel the same.
---
On the other hand, i could finally win eve.  So maybe its not all that bad an idea after all.
---
All good bois, nothing to see here it's *only 13%*
---
They are still at war with each other but both in caldari FW. It makes overview settings really weird.
---
Sure, the game was doing fine way back then. I remember 8k people being online being this huge thing. And I'm not gonna say that there were no bots back then, inflating the numbers, *buuuuuuuuuuut*...
---
tl;dr - eve is ded
---
Wait so you're complaining about goons blobbing on a post where your group is bragging about beating provi outnumbered...
---
To have monkeys throw shit at them?
---
There is such a thing as cancerous, necrotic exploits and some others that benefit the game.
---
It's nice to see a few more fighty groups get into the warzone. Now I just wish the game was a little more reliable. Four fights last night I got rubberband scrammed from 15+km out.
---
Is it just brawl or be brawled in ccp.newMath()?
---
Updooted for posting against the meta to farm karma
---
Which gate to camp? Probably Ichoriya or the pipe from Rens into amarr fw
---
honestly im like 90% ur entire account is bait but its very masterful, good job
---
Wait there's a public JF service into amamake? What's the price and who do I contract?
---
This is my experience in facwar. Oh, and when you do get a 1v1 the server decides to choke on its own dick and rubberband you 20km into the guy's cloaky alt's scram.
---
Only solo roaming content, gangs tend to make the population dock (enough structures they have XD)
---
Right, but has there been a World War Flee in the real world, which is in any way similar to grr goons in Tribute. I think not.
---
You are silly.   There is no 26th month in a year.
---
game is perfectly fine btw
---
why cant my retri solo a vni????
---
Nobody cares about tribute. It doesn't count.
---
"They need to do this with all content in eve"
---
"Sure you need a small amount of solo content"
---
Nothing in here is saying that ALL solo pve activities would be ENDED.  Right now, there are no group activities that equally reward a small gang fleet for participating and accomplishing an objective in normal space.  We need more of this content, as soon as possible, particularly so that small gangs can hunt other small gangs instead of small gangs hunting a solo AFK VNI.  
---
Some examples could be NPC anomalies that require ~5 fleet members; ~10 members, ~20 members; they dont reward bounties, have ship restrictions, but they do have an isk payout structure similar to incursions and can be run in your own space without all the incursion nonsense.  Same concept for some higher rarity ore sites, that would have a large juicy asteroid at the end that can be mined out in around 20 minutes with a maximum number of mining fleet members, but you have to be able to survive the ever increasing difficulty of waves that come in while you mine it, which will take the same number of fleet members to survive through.  
---
These concepts help to build community cohesion and teach game mechanics and fleet tactics, and are sorely missing in this game.
---
nice try, but it is well known what really happened
---
There you mix up things, the Hyperspatials are in the Super ... mkay ?
---
I last mined about 6 weeks ago, I have 3 rorquals, one maxed out, one decent with t2 core, and one that can barely fly it. 
---
If memory serves it printed  me about 270-320 mil per hour mining the +10% sites.
---
NO U, my flair is more stronk than yours ..
---
They're fast, their dps is nasty, they're tough, and they have tons of utility via all those extra bonused utility highs.
---
Killboards worshipping goons... Classic.
---
https://discord.gg/Yyyffu6 shamelessly plugging the 3d printing eve discord!
---
are goons allowing you to share your childporn collection on their discord?
---
&gt;And we're back at your opinion.
---
Your opinion.
---
&gt;I do agree the health of the game is important but how to make it 'healthier' we might disagree on.
---
Why do you disagree injectors are a problem when they adversely affect the health of the game?
---
So you added functionality to the cyno to be able to circumvent the prevention. Why would I allow that?
---
&gt;And would it be the same for everyone? Defenders and hunters alike?
---
Yes. How you use it doesnt matter. The goal is to prevent instant drops.
---
&gt;AFK VNI ratting while paying attention to local is nearly indistinguishable from botting. Does that mean we should make ratting more involved, sure. Although bots will find a way to bot that quickly.
---
No. When it has been running for 23/7 for 3 months, it is a known bot. These are common.
---
&gt;The consensus is that it's nearly impossible. And unless you also didn't sleep for months it's impossible to know they are out there for months 23,5/7, btw which if acted on will only lead to the bots randomizing their 'up-time'.
---
No. The consensus is that there are thousands of bots running at all times and CCP does nothing. People can communicate and not everyone plays in the same tz.
---
&gt;btw which if acted on will only lead to the bots randomizing their 'up-time'.
---
So now you are moving to "but it wont work anyway". If CCP werent retarded, they would be checking a ton of variables by now. Ultimately, if bots dont run as long, they generate less isk, which is the point.
---
&gt;Evidence is extremely difficult since I guess even CCP would have trouble 100% proving someone is a bot purely based on their 'up-time' ratting. They can however see into where the gained ISK is going and I think based on that you can make a much more grounded assumption about some VNI being a bot or a player.
---
No i don't, look at the chart carefully and see lows were 27/28k last summer in july, now open the 1 month chart.
---
(‚úø‚ó†‚Äø‚ó†)
---
London meet up this weekend, time to see two of my favourite spaceship nerds, and many more besides.
---
Oh look, yet another person complaining about eve is dying even though it isn't, and there's no in-game experience that they're referring to but to an abstract number.... And without understanding averages. 
---
Sigh.
---
this isnt an anti-anti-ccp'ers thread, this is an anti-anti-ccp'ers bandwagoners thread.
---
you appear to be an anti-anti-anti-ccp'er
---
meta level 450 btw

maybe my post is really dumb
---
or

im playing chess in the past against myself
---
I'll send 50m ISK to the first newbro who can identify at least two logical fallacies in this statement.
---
thanks ccp for being awesome (‚óï‚Äø‚óï‚úø)(‚óï‚Äø‚óï‚úø

That used to work and after testing it a few weeks ago appears to have been patched.
---
you mango, open the chart and try to find 1 day below 25k online during last summer.

**Deployment and New Arena**
---
Currently we are deployed to the high sec system of Samanuni in Black Rise.  This is not much of a change for us, as many of our Black Rise roams form in Samanuni or two jumps away in Ichoriya.  The only real change is we will be creating a new arena in Samanuni with two opposing off-grid Astrahuses facing a center arena with a much tighter, faster format than our current Liekuri/Jos/Otela model, for our Eternal War and event purposes.  This deployment will allow us to consolidate all of our ships into one system and eliminate the need to keep ships in The Forge.  It will also make high sec Eternal War content more convenient for those already deployed to Black Rise.
---
Logistically, what does this mean for RvB members?  We already have a seeded market in Samanuni.  Samanuni is 9 jumps from Jita through relatively safe high sec space.  Freighter/bowhead service will be available on a limited basis for corp members without their own logistics (see Nitro and Bobert).   Please move or fit enough ships to reship for Eternal War events and fitted ships for low sec roams using our usual comps.  Feel free to compete in and stock the market in Samanuni as well.  
---
**PvP Content while Deployed in Samanuni**
---
* RvB Events, Training, &amp; spontaneous RvB combat in Samanuni at the new arena
---
* Red and Blue has joined Caldari FW (experimental stage)
---
* Black Rise low sec roams from Samanuni, some w/cap support
---
* Hunting in ‚Äòbot‚Äô space in Null Sec w/Lurker ZX
---
* Thera-based Null Sec roams w/Carlos Pedersoli
---
* High sec wardecs w/third parties (maybe)
---
**RvB in Faction Warfare**
---
We are experimenting with the Faction Warfare system by joining both Red and Blue Alliances into the Caldari side of the Caldari vs Gallente faction war.  While joined, Red and Blue members will be able to engage Gallente and Minmatar FW members in low sec and high sec space.  We will also be able to farm Caldari FW loyalty points by running Caldari FW L4 missions and offensive plexing in Black Rise during the event.  Red and Blue will be able to continue to shoot each other as usual without standing loss or sec status penalty.  We will be able to travel freely in Jita and Amarr because Jita is Caldari space and Amarr is an ally of Caldari in the FW system.  The down side is that Caldari and Amarr FW members will be off limits to shoot during the event.  Also, we will be ‚Äúshoot on sight‚Äù in Gallente and Minmatar high sec space to the faction police NPCs as well as FW members, and everyone needs to keep an eye on their individual Gallente and Minmatar faction standing.

Still subbed on my accounts, haven't logged in since last Oct other than to manage training queues, claim rewards, etc.
---
Why you print out items of a dead game?
---
&gt;Your opinion.
---
Nope, that's just a fact.
---
&gt;Why do you disagree injectors are a problem when they adversely affect the health of the game?
---
Again, that's your opinion. I'd say it gives new players a possibility of being able to catch up SP-wise to a character that's been around for 10 years.
---
&gt;So you added functionality to the cyno to be able to circumvent the prevention. Why would I allow that?  
---
&gt;Yes. How you use it doesnt matter. The goal is to prevent instant drops.
---
Ok, so you would like a 5 min activation delay and a 5 min re-activation delay. I'm curious how the rest of Eve feels about that.
---
&gt;No. The consensus is that there are thousands of bots running at all times and CCP does nothing. People can communicate and not everyone plays in the same tz.
---
Again, consensus of opinions doesn't make something a fact.
---
&gt;So now you are moving to "but it wont work anyway". If CCP werent retarded, they would be checking a ton of variables by now. Ultimately, if bots dont run as long, they generate less isk, which is the point.
---
Nope, just leads to more VNI alts.
---
No need to convince me. CCP needs to be convinced someone is a bot based on data, not opinion. That's the whole point, perception and opinions don't mean something is the truth.
---
Sadly not as had to buy one for my son too and a ton of fishing gear, roof bars, j bars, fish finders etc.. so a little out of budget. I got 2 x BKC RA220's in desert camo.
---
Looks like skillu got skill extracted
---
???
---
How much time do you end up investing into getting these fights/highlights out of curiosity?
---
The damn rorqs gon wild PandaFam
---
I don't even play anymore so fuck knows
---
So the real enemy is actually CONCORD, who doesn't control what ships the Triglavians bring into High Sec, but sure as hell blocks players from matching size for size and bringing in capitals.
---
High Sec will burn.
---
Humiliating a player in front of a live audience at the developers office, telling him to kill himself, and then getting away without a permaban. That could definitely be implied as a threat the same way Gigx threatened TheJudge. Gigx never followed up on his threats either yet he got far worse punishment. I would be fine with it if both got the permaban they deserved it its obvious CCP caters to certain personalities more than others.
---
That's what I've been yelling this whole time: that the blocs have so much power, and with this, we have the potential to actually give them all a run for their money. Better yet, a bloc dealing with an invasion is also a chance for someone else to make a push against their sov at the same time. It's the rare Good Dilemma.
---
Thnks to FRT i have a superb and splendid killboard. Never give up never surrender, keep my board green! 
---
Cheers from a Test bro
---
It's dying to risk aversion and players not doing anything. It certainly FEELS dead when I go roam facwar or try to get small fights in null. It feels like the last days of DAoC when the big blocs were fighting around a bot driven economy and nobody else played.
---
Calculate the schwarzschild radius of a banana please.

So much hype for so little pay dirt.

&gt; Logical Fallacies
---
Oh wait, what you gonna do next, preach me about the Spaghetti Monster?!
---
Well that was the way it used to be and we got the N3 vs CFC blob war, and people said that that exact thing was the problem with the game, lmao.
---
This community could turn 10/15 of FW systems into basically "get easy cheap fight dome" if corp and alliance would all have a jump clone there, a few T1 cruisers / destroyers doctrines supplied and roam around a bit. WH already do it to get armor brawl, except they can easily reship from what every hunting doctrine they are to armor brawl one. Live near an action area and people will bring ships and create fights. Who care about their purpose.
---
Most people in Eve play a game where they either hope someone will defend/attack something in order to get a fight, or bring in a kitting kitchen sink in order to not get turbo stomped by response fleet.
---
People need to learn the value of bringing engageable ships if they want fight. Fights is what is fun in this game. If you like structure bashing or entosis you're sure are a specimen. If you want to have fun and have easy action shooting spaceships, get where people are bringing ships to get fights.
---
That's how we could have fun in this game. Easily.
---
i wanna thank ccp for making pve i can casually enjoy. also want to thank anyone who has posted pvp videos on here, i really appreciate the entertainment
---
yes because what we need is npc's dictating sov in an mmo sandbox that is meant to be player driven
---
Jesus fucking Christ it's so true.
---
i got dead in the actual post right.

thats 5/10 good enough for RvB Propaganda

Khanid or Imperial skin now and it'll be perfect ! Painting this correctly will be a challenge tho :) !!
---
put it near texas for more appropriate scaling pls tyvm
---
same. k, m, b
---
Negative. Wingspan b274 @0 combat corp...sometimes a n110.
---
&gt;Nope, that's just a fact.
---
Based on what?
---
&gt;Again, that's your opinion. I'd say it gives new players a possibility of being able to catch up SP-wise to a character that's been around for 10 years.
---
So now you dont think the health of the game is important. Your opinion shifts with every post! Whatever is convenient, right?
---
&gt;Ok, so you would like a 5 min activation delay and a 5 min re-activation delay. I'm curious how the rest of Eve feels about that.
---
No. It needs to take 5 minutes for stuff to be able jump to a cyno. While you wait, you cant move. If there are any holes to circumvent it, they will be plugged until correctness and balance have been achieved.
---
&gt;Again, consensus of opinions doesn't make something a fact.
---
It is a fact that the consensus isnt what you think. But whether it was a fact was not the issue.
---
&gt;Nope, just leads to more VNI alts.
---
More bans. Where are they connecting from?
---
&gt;No need to convince me. CCP needs to be convinced someone is a bot based on data, not opinion.
---
Yeah, you barely have an opinion, but what evidence would convince you? We need to know if you ask for impossible things.
---
&gt;That's the whole point, perception and opinions don't mean something is the truth.
---
You think the "opinion" that there are thousands of bots is just an opinion with no basis whatsoever?
---
TBH I don't know why we didn't fight on the 4B- gate, I had the whole mach fleet and triage dragged 140km off where you guys warped on us and if I suicided the dictor I could have probably kept them there for a while. I guess rahvin was probably feeling rusty and didn't want to go for it.
---
holy shit Im out!!
---
I propose we build a big beautiful wall
---
Been having that problem myself. Went roaming around in a Svipul that could have easily been taken down by even a couple t1 frigs. 5 man frig gangs wouldn't fight me, pirate frigs wouldn't fight me, after I ganked a slicer I got karma to the face when a brutix 100 off rubberbanded into me for the scram lol.
---
Is Black Rise less dead now? A month ago it was completely dead
---
This. Eve is gank warfare.
---
In the UK it goes Day/Month/Year
---
This sounds remarkably un-freedom of you, brother.
---
Can I have your dead stuff?
---
Yo my dude, I did a basic tutorial on how I do this personally in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IVK0fMumg8) - I absolutely suggest FW for the low-comittment PvP it offers. Take a cheap frigate, watch your D-Scan, and see what happens. You may find - like I did - fights that aren't in your favour, but if you want quick content it's the best place to go!
---
I find plenty of things to shoot at during EU prime
---
Higher level pve would be a good thing. Null is too stagnate so this would be a good addition. All it would have to be is a constellation at a time for two weeks like incursions... but actually a threat.
---
You're retarded if you think this is anything but a joke.
---
multiboxing has been an effective thing since literally day one so no, most activities aren't designed around boxing. its just that the game is designed around a few pretty long cycle times and scale way too linearly.
---
Good luck man. You were dealt a shitty hand but I hope you make it through
---
Fights are a good thing.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/77394122/ sometimes we get confused though
---
Cool. I might check it out once i can make some isk. Thinking of joining a WH corp. Seems very challenging.
---
You're just retarded
---
Its payday, I've got the day off and just fit my Astero with covert cloak. Its gonna be great weekend for exploring!
---
Doing world arks with 3 logi and 3 dps while one guy is triple boxing and one of the dps also salvages.
---
I admit though, back when the fleets warped around systems and everyone scanned down the zoryas we once had 7 fleets at once, that was scary.
---
World Ark needs to be a Titan killer and invade high-pop nullsec, ccplease.
---
Delve would stop being so boring if this thing just showed up and nuked a Titan right in front of me.
---
EUTZ seems to have about 3/4 of the playerbase these days.
---
Hey look, another goon smugpost about their killboards!
---
no u
---
Most activities are nothing like they were on day one, mostly because of Multi boxing not in spite of it.
---
So you want to get rid of the main weapon used against large alliances?
---
Story Time:
---
Hunter spots a Rorqual and Super in a Belt. Super is 500km off of Rorqual with fighters on Rorqual. Hunter pings around to get warp in on Super. Super 100% knew we were hunting but miscalculated we would go for Rorqual. On jump in Rorqual immediately jumps out. Supers fighters never even made it back to him...
---
All that serves is to point out people made statements without any analysis? Why is that so interesting?
---
On the other hand, the developer sold itself to a gambling company. But that's probably not even worth discussing /s
---
Then maybe you'll love Black Desert?
---
so i can't solo them... damn it
---
Got to love the summer time.

---
Feeding into Goon. Bad idea bud.
---
Space is never short on miners, and 2 yeah newer alliances did grab moons, they started with small ones and as they grew they fought over better moons.
---
The point was that I can look at the game and separate reality from fantasy. Balance changes that are reactive generally do not look as good on paper as proactive balance changes, however they succeed or fail in a different way. Most people not in the industry see everything as a proactive change or balance, hence why most ideas on this sub would never work no matter how good they sound.
---
But people have been killing miners for years, moons did not change that. What moons did change is that there are no major new alliances in eve because new alliances do not have a major income source.
---
Something very important you would do well to understand: economy/industry IS pvp.
---
You are competing for resources. You are competing for market opportunities. You are competing to survive and not get blown up. 
---
At every level, this game is about competition in a harsh and unforgiving environment. The sooner you come to appreciate and enjoy that, the sooner you will have more fun (even when you lose). If that will never be fun for you, you‚Äôre playing the wrong game.
---
Welcome to Eve.
---
For pounds, all we know is that the Romans had a unit of weight they called libra pondo (literally translates to "a pound by weight"), and that is likely where we get the name. The actual weight of a roman pound was probably 0.725 modern pounds, but a series of changes in coinage seem to have changed it to our modern definition.
---
Rome only started existing roughly 3000 years ago. The EVE gate seems to have been constructed roughly 15000 years ago in eve time. Isn't it reasonable to assume that the historical definition behind 1 AU might have been lost to history?
---
Furthermore, imo 1 AU is much more similar to the imperial measurement than the metric system. 149,597,870,700 isn't a nicely divisible number.
---
What'd they do, hack skillu's bots again lol
---
Oof. Yikes!
---
It's NetEase so your phone is going to get hijacked. Use a burner for this if you're gonna play, same as FGO and Azur Lane.
---
Are they fighting this decade?
---
I want to protect small gang and solo pvp. Dropping carriers or 20 blops on a couple of cruisers is fucked up.
---
Solo, new and looking for a fair fight is a wish and a dream.
---
About the only time you'll get a fair fight is when you surprise someone and their boob doesn't get to you in time. 
---
Every now and then you'll run into another solo pvp'er that isn't in a 2B T3C, but those times will be few and far between.
---
That being said, look on the in game map for players in space in the last 30 minutes, and number of players killed in the last hour.
---
Then use a combination of zkillboard and dotlan to try to figure out if the activity is a gate camp, and if it is whether or not you want to try to take it on.
---
Fly something cheap. Have fun!
---
These days people want guaranteed wins above all. Eagability is a secondary concern (if at all)
---
A cardboard cutout colored with crayons to look like a gold is still a worthy achievement.
---
How much for you to print me one =p I enjoy the ships of the dead game.
---
It looks good so far, but you were definitely going to paint it, right? If you don't trust your brushwork, a simple coat of metallic gold and a brown acrylic wash will make it look decadent.
---
They could have hired some asian kid to recode it for them over the weekend.
---
Is that a shout to call snuff for a visit ?
---
After Serenity came over @\_@
---
I just go back and forth from Hek to Huola and find more than enough fights for a nooblet t1 frig-destroyer like myself.
---
That‚Äôs awesome to hear, Black Rise #1
---
Tempted to take it to the games workshop for a project for someone... Ain't sure what I'm going to do with it yet! But my painting sucks, I ruined a 5 hour print of a leshak and rev before so to do it on a large avatar print scares me.
---
Did you just say you want group based Incursion-like isk without any of the incursion logistics and effort?
---
Flair checks out.
---
They are still trying to look like a solid purchase to PA, they dont want any open associations with with cancelled projects.  Nova will sit on the white board until sometime next year then quietly taken out back and sacrificed to the icelandic volcano gods.
---
oh dear
---
No, don't shame Krojew! He clearly put lots of love and effort into Evernus. Hell, I wanted to keep the name because the old tool was so good. I just hope REvernus is eventually as good as Evernus was.
---
If you're interested in exploration and hauling as a career, consider talking to Signal Cartel, though Eve Uni is also pretty good for this stuff.
---
I definitely wouldn't autopilot lol. Even in Solitude that's a death sentence. Autopilot = death, in general.
---
I'm legit not getting a single one of your sentences..
---
I like Okkamon / Asakai
---
&gt;You need a good fleet to actually hunt them.
---
In the eve I want to play NPCs hunt *you*.
---
This is the last place a new solo pvp player should go.
---
Brave is for new players yes, but it's for new blobbers, not new solo / small gang players.
---
Not only is brave a blob corps that heavily camps their region (while complaining about simple farmers), they are in such a huge blue donut that you would have to roam for forever to find someone not blue to you.
---
I look forward to checking this out
---
It's dandylion, he's just a toxic shit hole.
---
Skill injections are the problem I think
---
Go one better...  the more a region is used the greater the PVE invasion force is....  AND NO RETURN FROM IT  (not big isk, not big drops, etc.)   Just that the more you "stress" the regions resources (maybe beyond some acceptable minimum?) the more you have to do to keep the place safe to stress its resources.
---
IOW, if you shoot the rats (or rocks) too much, they actually do start to "shoot back" in some way.  It too would force a spread.
---
but dropping 20 blops on ratting carriers and rorquals is pretty good right?
---
To be fair, netease is primarily concerned with the asian mobile market, which is huge.  If one of their games catches some western customers - great.  But the US/Europe are not their targeted audience.
---
Was he ratting in IGE...
---
Not really. It is less of a problem because of counter-drop, but its basically an overpowered mechanic "countering" itself.
---
Can someone please transpose?
---
Well this is exciting.
---
If they still come here they haven't really quit eve.  They just quit eve as it is.  They are monitoring changes.  If they find a reason then they will be back.  That reason could be different for different people.
---
During WWB they came back because the 2 years prior were all about "grrr goons" and all wanted in on the invasion (or to protect it, or to 3rd party it, or to make isk on the industry, etc.).  
---
I think people still love this game.  But they come into the sandbox when the right kids are in it or the games being played are the ones they want to play.  Reddit is a good place to monitor that.
---
Sounds like fun.  I hope you can revive the warzone.  I'd even consider coming back for that.  FW was the funnest part of Eve because of all the actual fighting.
---
I hear ccp may actually try to fix the handful of well identified bad mechanics, but then i remembered its ccp, so they will probably try to change it all completely and actually make it worse, so enjoy it while you can.
---
after two years solo pvping i'm as clueless as you tbh  
---
the reason i'm dropping this comment is that there are currently 69 and someone's going to ruin it eventually
---
did you log in?
---
I see what you did there! ü§î

RVB. I'll give 5 Billion ISK to whoever clicks the 'disband' button on any parties involved.

Hey! Always great to see another scaper.

Or, just train towards it, no need to involve injectors.

---
Detorid, is that a WoW Classic server? Because isn't that where Skill urself is playing?
---
Thank you for the advice:)
---
The only thing that bothers me is unhealthy thirst to be a "predator" of sorts, like the CODE folks, I suppose. It is even appears to me to be the core of universal hostility, but this is not the correct way to describe player driven system.
---
Market relationships and competition are complicated activities that take a lot of effort to get hold on, and I love complicated stuff, so the "wrong game" part is not the case. 
---
Well, I'll still have to deal with logistics being intercepted by these uncultured pirates because of poor management.
---
there you go
---
I think you mean transcribe.
---
RvB is teh cats pajamas. #logibros #ospreydoctrineplz
---
&gt;An 'Attributes' tab has been added to the show info window for NPCs. This tab will list their damage resistances as well as showing what damage types they deal.
---
Praise Bob it's about time. Hopefully it's specific to the NPC and not generic to the faction as sometimes NPCs do different damage than expected.
---
So nothing ok lmbo
---
Then don't read it!
---
I know about the effects that the Trig invasion has on drones but was their aggro increased when you're not in an invasion area also? I am losing drones on normal missions where I never had an issue before. What's up with that?
---
Numbers don‚Äôt lie. Take a look over at eve offline and u can see that the game has been shedding players since January. Folk are just not logging in.  Basically the game is at 2007 numbers and this is with new content having just been added.  Normally new content spikes players getting online as folk come back to see what is new. Unfortunately it seems that more pve and a high sec safer from wars does not drive the eve players to come back.
---
Note: When people recommend low sec or FW, they usually mean going into faction warfare complexes. If you're flying a frigate and *don't* go into complexes, you aren't going to get fights because of gate guns.
---
I expect this is the case. It was previewed by Karkur on twitter a few weeks ago: https://twitter.com/CCP_karkur/status/1137079694065635328
---
&gt;These days
---
These days when? In 2006? 2012? People have always wanted guaranteed wins, in EVE, because winning is winning, and losing is being fresh out of your hard-earned ship. The glory of complete victory, the misery of utter defeat, that's what makes this game different and special. 
---
Asymmetrical warfare is a core concept of this game, and the need for "gudfites" is a product of player stagnation and poor game design choices. People didn't have "fun brawls" in 2010. They stacked the odds in any way they could, they won, they lost, and all throughout, it was fun, because the fights were smaller, the groups more numerous and less skilled, and overall, the political landscape was more fragmented. 
---
500-pilot alliances brought their A-game as much as the current blobs do. It's just that their A-game wasn't as overwhelming.
---
Its funny tho. When it was passive people were crying passive income op!!! Now its boring...
---
Where was that stated?
---
Do what jintan said and go to fw best place for noons.
---
1:1 is to much. Maybe a 1:3-4 ratio could work we need alts for some tasks like cynos boosting and hauling.
---
But we do need to kill off the 30+ man alt armies that are running around.
---
Well, if there's anything about July 4th I know, it's explosions.
---
Let's go blow shit up
---
skynet
---
That was what I suspected with the Kiki, was that it would just kite and let the damage ramp up at a range I couldn't catch it, much less engage it.  I avoided it for that reason.
---
Deltole Deltole Deltole. Blap the Otuni. All dps on the Vylade, all dps on the Vylade.
---
I don't find any reason why having multiple accounts is bad for the game. It's as if they all were individual players.
---
How many pieces did you have to print?
---
Since when?
---
Could have done it in just two but I did it in 4
---
I am pretty sure you are wrong but I left my future prediction powers in my other jacket.
---
Good on Provi, Finally realizing the inevitable.
---
Thank you I will try this!
---
id be worried too
---
Ah the lesser known Minmatar Battleship, the Hurricane, is finally getting some love, after living in the shadows of the much loved battlecruiser sharing the same name.
---
got em!
---
Thank you I will take a look at this when I get home.
---
Apparently you forgot to do your homework. Everytime CVA drops capitals to engage the fight becomes very one sided for some odd reason.
---
Hey OP, three things: 1.your not some genius who has found the cure for eve 2.your idea will not be implemented into the game 3. stop being thirsty for karma
---
still playing this since 03. still crap at it. but i love it. always gud fights to be had. see you tonight in the dronelands.
---
that us much too violent, should just throw some tea out in the ice asteroid belt instead.
---
I'll gank you for that tea
---
Memes are automatically removed.  Please submit to /r/evememes instead.
---
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Eve) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
I wanna see more PVE Raid like content where corps/groups can work together to make isk or gain some awesome components, ship bp's, or other rewards but something big and hard to handle thats actually worth the time invested.
---
PS: Gigity
---
As usual just a bit of fun, more of a response to Redline's post :D
---
Is WoW classic literally better than EVE at this point?
---
Discuss
---
This guy is trolling you pretty hard with the meta bombs hes rich af but not dumb if you knew him and saw how he rolls and how many eyes/cynos he has you wouldn't even try but keep it up I bet 5b no one catches him and his bling fit marshal there is a reason you use meta bombs and its not always about range and damage but no one can think outside the spectrum of zkill...also the reason you use blops is to be able to pod two ppl in two different regions within the same minute to confuse the zkill stalkers. gl
---
sure
---
He was protecting his rorqual
---
Thanks fam
---
I would love to see the Triglavians burn down Delve.
---
You're welcome ;)
---
You have no Kiln, go kick a tree in the balls
---
They need links and a good reason to be in the belt unfortunately or were going back to pre rework rorq numbers.
---
The solution is buffing barges to be meaning full or remove mining from the rorq. Beyond that rorq is fine. Panic is a hot button tho.
---
Oh they'd love to know exactly what you're bringing and where you're going so that they can deliver any extra torpedoes or drones you might be missing.
---
Don‚Äôt fly a 1.5 bil battleship, for starters.
---
I have that same mousepad!
---
i love these pvp changes!
---
[Providence high command discuss their victory](https://youtu.be/uLvbUEKpu3U)
---
Getting robbed and awoxed sounds great.
---
Its great to see a few people getting hyped for this skin. I had the pleasure of making this a few months back and its great to see it come out for you guys to enjoy. I'm not sure if its been communicated yet, but I also set the skin up to react to state changes, such as colour changing when warping. Its a little extra thing, but I'm hoping that some of the tech we use for VFX can start to find its way into skin creation for future skins.
---
But salvage
---
There would be too much bitching and whining if that happened
---
About #1, I'm pretty sure it was the other way around :p
---
I found a screenshot of Providence morale boosting
---
We are vicious small bitey puppies that will piss on your living room :D
---
Disclaimer: Theoretical knowledge only; I have not run any abyssal sites.
---
Triglav invasion and abyssal sites are vaguely similar to Incursions, but only for 1 T1 or T2 Cruiser (or up to 3 Frigates in a fleet). I've hardly heard of anyone actually 3-manning them in frigs.
---
I believe that the Triglavians are currently only invading Empire Space, but I could be wrong.
---
Regarding rewards, salvage being relevant could not be further from the truth. You go into an abyssal site, kill the rats, kill the structure "Bioadaptive Cache", and obtain loot from that. Enemies do not drop loot. It is foolish and suicidal to try and salvage them, because once in an Abyssal site you have precisely 20 minutes to kill all ships inside all 3 rooms and get out. If you do not do that in time, the gravitational well of deadspace collapses and you immediately lose your ship and capsule. Because you're locked in this deadspace, it's also physically impossible to ninja salvage.
---
That said, while the risk is extreme and loot hauls can be variable, I hear that it can make good money. Even the Tier 3s make 100m/hr or so, and the Tier 4s and 5s make ludicrous amounts (but require ludicrously expensive fits or a high chance of failure).
---
there are so many ways to curb and confuse the bots out there... CCP just doesn't care to. 
---
Honestly you should be tackled for most of the havens and sanctums. They are supposed level 9/10 right... It would get me roaming null sec more often to kill krabs. Currently you can go for hours and only get 1-2 broken bots or people asleep at the keyboard. You jump in and see 4-5 VNIs on scan warpping to station. It's crap.
---
The counter would be REAL people running defense fleets for ratters in smaller faster ships, T3Ds and such to cover a few ratting systems. Creating conflict instead of burning people. 
---
Make drone not auto agress like fighters and guns.... and everything else in the damn game....
---
If it was 2012, this game would not be shit anymore..
---
We're also going to build a wall and have them pay for it?
---
owo
---
Horde already is doing that for Delve. Or do you not keep up with the only reliable news source in New Eden, The Onion?
---
&gt;Clicking the "Clean Ship" button in the fitting window will now immediately clean your ship while docked.
---
Don't even have to read past that. I love this patch already.
---
So they steamrolled small, easy, targets and lost to larger ones.
---
I fail to see how the current malaise is somehow preferable to a system where PL was already losing.
---
The game is even worse for ‚Äúsmall groups‚Äù to the point of killing them off existentially rather than their ships.
---
:nevernot:
---
Provi: Wow it's so lame that RC did a batphone.  
---
Also Provi: At least Test showed up with good numbers to help us.
---
The new Bot programs out are for Trig sites.. Those running Anom bots still be changing over time. 
---
Much more profit in running 8 x T3 Filaments per hour in relative safety.
---
Always good fun bud, love em :D
---
They never were.
---
I like your spin, but that's hardly the issue
---
Well, the previous poster just said "go to any novice" more or less, which is fairly different from "go to these 2-3 systems where you might actually get lucky and have some fun". I haven't been to amamake, but even Tama was pretty dead a couple months ago on a few Fridays and weekends.
---
isnt that everyone in eve?
---
:clickclack:
---
Yes it does? They engaged in a war with their ‚Äúoverwhelming‚Äù super fleet and lost hard. Even in later dominion sov you could clearly see that PL were hardly untouchable. 
---
Every poster in this sub trying to spin the death of an entire swath of gameplay as a comeuppance for PL is simply being disingenuous - PL was already losing in 2014
---
Yup. 100% bot.
---
The first official day of summer is......today. Who needs to worry about pesky facts though when they obviously go against the argument you need to make with yourself to avoid the truth.
---
Hell yeah dude
---
Can‚Äôt really argue it‚Äôs a sandbox if half the sand got dumped into the trash
---
It's cus they all use alts lmao
---
Have fun explaining this to your non-EVE playing friends...
---
Implying I have friends
---
Game literally changed to make building supers and titans the easiest thing under the sun
---
OP got roasted!
---
&gt;added in new idle animations which make the characters seem more lifelike.
---
IB4 I go to take a portrait shot and my character won‚Äôt stop picking his nose
---
Hey look we (GoG) getting some reddit love (in the BR)... Keep bringing it RVB.. Cheers for the GFs
---
I've just rejoined, super friendly guild found me and liking the new intro guidance :)
---
I think of it as keeping my toe in the pool. At some point I‚Äôll decide the water is nice and jump in again.
---
No, but as someone who is in the Dust Vets discord daily, we are up on the latest, and often first to hear it.  It is one of the places where CCP Dopamine was clear that articles referencing Nova's cancellation are flat wrong.  I believe it was also stated in one of the threads here on the topic.
---
A shit tier FC, one of many, he just has a big mouth.
---
So your solution makes the big alliances more powerful?
---
We don't
---
\^ underrated poster! 
---
Made me laugh my ass off.
---
Tried to look it up but it seems the page on CCPs website that describes how  it works is apparently down. Par for course at this point I guess. 
---
I mean, why bother having any information at all on how your game works so that people that want to try it can understand the mechanics?
---
I like this, but there's one small problem with it. Typically, when an attacker enters a site, the rats will often change aggression to the attacker.
---
I'm not saying this can't or shouldn't be changed, but it's a small hurdle that would need to be overcome before your plan would work properly.
---
where is the sound?
---
And one that wouldn't solve anything. The bot programmers would just adjust how they program their bots. There is no simple solution to this complicated issue. EVE is a game that requires very little user input and it is extremely easy to make a bot look like a human. 
---
This whole notion that every VNI ratter who pulls drones and docks up every time a neut enters system is a bot is also extremely flawed. Every guide, every video, and every corp teaches their players to do the exact same thing. 
---
Tackling the ratter isn't going to stop bots, it's just going to cause the bot to attack the tackling ships first, which - I know this is going to blow your mind - a player would also do! 
---
As a long-time botter of many different throwaway games, I have yet to see a single, effective proposed solution to wipe out all the bots in EVE.
---
Wait, you guys are actively blue balling GSF, but then you bitch because C Team Provibloc blue balled you? Oh the irony.
---
So when people have to say EVE isn't dead, does that mean it IS dead?
---
Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh &gt;:(
---
I don't think that happens as much anymore. Fwiw I believe the rat agro is still the same AI from 2003 so it could just be anecdote.
---
Impressive.
---
With this most recent achievement, fate has in a single stroke, marked the decline of the west and spelled a new era of wondrous prosperity and peaceful global dominance for the Chinese dragon, which promises to firmly stand in sharp contrast to the historically blobby ascent of western powers and the cruel subjugation it brought to the humbler alliances of new Eden. With the blessings of Chinese quantum direct-current botting algorithms, quantum near200 applications and quantum enhanced Huawei 5G surveillance will be the instruments with which Fraternity affirms its noble stewardship of 2019 new Eden politics and offers non-pvp alliances a different option; an humanist alternative to the depredations of Western leadership and the opportunity for a more equitable and dignified multilateralism.
---
Maybe you should involve him in a hobby that he'll be able to do long term
---
The portrait screen hasn't changed.  You'll see the new idle animations only on the sculpting/dressing screen, the character sheet header, and the full-body 3D preview.
---
Solo WH Pvp question, i've been trying to roam more to do some solo/duo pvp, however every fight i've found with my bomber i can't seem to crack, i can kill explo, i can kill indy (obviously) but i can't even crack the tank of a null ratting VNI when i apply 700 dps under 2 painters, so really my question is, what is the single best solo gank ship for wh space? i have 3 toons so i can also do a small gang, is it still Stratios?
---
fun night for my first real fleet up ever lol
---
Eh, people want guaranteed wins when their expensive stuff is on the line. Shiney ships, capital, supers. I think EVE online was at its best when people were throwing T1 BS/BC gangs at each other. ISK killed was lower, but the amount of fights was crazy.
---
Providence is good but only in EUTZ, not much content as you get later in USTZ.
---
Do you have any proof what so ever of your claims?
---
No worries, hope it helps!
---
&gt; Make drone not auto agress like fighters and guns.... and everything else in the damn game.... 
---
The only thing that would solve is people AFK ratting. Why do you think the bot couldn't just be reprogrammed to actually target and press "F"? That shit would be patched by bot writers in less than 10 minutes.
---
I stared at it for 2 seconds and it didn't erupt in flames. Is it running some weird bait fit?
---
Anytime mate
---
It was a mistake to add regular  minerals to moon goo.  Made it so that only roq mining mattered. Combined with the roq changes - all you have to do is mine moon goo and  you get enough regular minerals to build anything.
---
I mean, I don‚Äôt want to just say leave your Corp, but if it has no way to get you into pvp with a small group or anything, you should probably leave your Corp.
---
if you are going to rat in low, keep an eye on local and dscan, you are not safe, that isn't how it works. if you want to be a bit more safe go to high sec, or go to a null alliance that has a massive umbrella, dont fly shit you don't want to loose in space where anyone can freely attack you.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt bother with Nisuwa at the moment, you got a couple of guys who spend hours camping the complex gates with cloaked Loki‚Äôs
---
Bots and spodbrains
---
How about remove local.
---
10/10

This made me laugh. Got to hand it to them. They do know how to turn a frown upside down. 
---
Everyone: The forest is on fire guys.....
---
Provi: that‚Äôs not fire, that‚Äôs rain.
---
Remove you instead?
---
If I can blast a mach in a gank talos or a couple alts in vexors, or polarized coercers for amarr missions or w/e, and get paid 200-400m in faction / deadspace mods, sure. :D
---
&gt;Remove you instead?
---
Found the bot.
---
See how easy that was.
---
That would lead to more bots getting killed, but it wouldn't stop botting. A VNI ratter pays for its fit in 2 hours. Unless every botter dies more than once every two hours, it changes nothing and costs ... local, the primary content generator in NS.
---
They honestly should be harder too... a 100mn vni shouldnt be able to run them. They should need at least a battleship. This would make hunting them more profitable and they can still be paid for in 3-4 hours by the ratter. 
---
They could aggro/web drones much more frequently, instead they nerfed the VNI which did nothing. Killing drones would stop the bots from running for hours since their drones would be gone.
---
We should remove the distance barrier between lowsec and Stain imo
---
Earlier that day Provi had a fleet hitting a TRC Sotiyo in Y-M, pussied out and ran off when a fleet showed up to defend it.
---
RC fleet was smaller than Provis, but apparently since we had the friendly structure that was too big a risk and they wimped out...which makes me wonder:
---
Dear Provi FCs, how many more ships does having a structure nearby add to a fleets effective size? Is one Stiletto undocking from a keepstar enough to scare off a dozen Jackdaws?
---
The hierarchies have better escalations
---
What do you mean exactly by abuse ?
---
So let me get this straight.
---
PvP guys would have a field day killing bots. But this won't help because they would just replace them?
---
We could just keep killing them I guess. But wheres the fun in that.
---
:ConfusedFace:
---
You are going after specific escalations to stack and blitz.  Only Radiance and Hierarchy yield these.
---
I just joined my corp. They seem decent. And theres been lots of small groups running missions and I'm sure we can organize pvp roams.
---
I just waa was looking for something fun solo where I didn't need to log into comms.
---
You show up as purple for Caldari and most people don't show that on their overview so you can shoot them freely
---
Goddamn, do NC. really have to copy PL in everything? This need to follow the same path into irrelevance is mind boggling, I guess vince wants to go down on the same ship.
---
It does happen. All the time. I've lost two VNI's that would be dead but they got away because of stupid Guristas rats jamming me. When I enter the site and point a VNI most of the rats switch to me. Another one of CCP's brilliant changes years ago that has lead us to where we are at today.
---
I stopped pooping to read this.
---
Spawn sizes are different. it would add another level of complexity to the bot to lock the correct number of targets and press F at the correct time to switch targets as the last one dies. It would slow them down making them less profitable and more time in the site scramed. The further complexity adds another chance for the bot to break and get caught. 
---
So yes they may get around it but if it slows them down 20%, that is 20% less botting isk in the economy... probably trillions worth. Additionally, thats 20% more time they are in the site tackled, providing more opportunities for people to hunt them.
---
Ice belt.
---
No, it will only help you kill more bots. It won't help remove bots from the game. Removing bots from the game is sort of the point of this whole discussion, is it not?
---
But people haven't stopped going out in BC/BS fleets because they're risk-averse. They've stopped because the state of the game is such that those comps are not practical in the current ecosystem. You went out in 2012, you got bridged onto by another BS/BC/HAC fleet. Now you get dropped onto by supers with FAX support, which can only be countered by... supers with FAX support.
---
Speaking of pesky facts, don‚Äôt tell our au/nz eve players that it‚Äôs summer.
---
kamela/amamake
---
Big bad kill urself alliance, those 10 people taking them money and getting fat irl, nobody could stop them. Good they are dead
---
&gt;This whole notion that every VNI ratter who pulls drones and docks up every time a neut enters system is a bot is also extremely flawed.
---
*"Anyone who runs is a ~~VC~~ bot. Anyone who stands still is a ~~well-disciplined VC~~ broken bot!"*
---
&gt;Removing bots from the game is sort of the point of this whole discussion, is it not?
---
You said yourself there is no effective way to do this. So let's farm the bots. I'd be happy collecting isk from them.
---
still no fix for the broken "show on map" for the old map..
---
maybe after the summer they will fix it
---
&gt; facwar or try to get small fights in null.
---
waaah why wont everyone play the same way I do wahh
---
waah why wont everyone feed me content waaaaaah
---
Fuck Snuff
---
Take an English class then.
---
Honestly if we just made PVE more fun I can guarantee the ratio would begin to shift to more players doing it.
---
Where'd you get that XL mouse pad? I like it.
---
Take a look at this simple video. Its not my cup of tea gameplay but it might help new players get into pvp and score some kills.
---
https://youtu.be/LJxrlEg-pXY
---
Come in through Kari &lt;=&gt; Y-M.  You'll find more action on that side in most time zones aside from EU prime.
---
Let‚Äôs even go back further.
---
Is eve better then the original Everquest?
---
I don‚Äôt think so at this point, but I am working hard to change that.
---
none of those corps are FW.... are you retarded?
---
Think it was Amazon my GF brought it as a birthday gift so not entirely sure
---
So what about a player group that is focused on invading high population nullsec as a whole?
---
I'm with meha\_tar. I tried FW and flew punishers and tormentors around the Bleak Lands for months. Nobody EVER ran away from me, and most of the bait frigates just fought me 1v1 since I was (almost) not worth dropping Dreads on. Though I agree about skipping that punisher sitting in a medium.
---
Given you drop dreads consistently along with other caps inside ge- like you could fool me in that you clearly just want killmails and not a fight.
---
Love this mean-spirited post giving it to those fucking Newbros.
---
says the nub who want fly without 4 alts behind him...
---
If you're being hunted by so few players these days that you feel the need for NPCs to play that role, then EVE is truly dead.
---
It would be interesting too.
---
It‚Äôd give targets in space to hit for combat raiders/wormholers, it‚Äôd give humans a reason to counter invade, it‚Äôd give good overall content for those there in the form of over/pvp.
---
I also agree with the poster above you, that I think this is fundamentally moving away from what eve should be, and is just painting a sinking titanic rather then fix the holes.
---
This is what I don‚Äôt get.
---
Why isn‚Äôt concord shooting them?
---
Killing more bots makes the fit more expensive making botting less profitable.  More demand for a limited supply of VNIs.   
---
\-Example: Mr. Botter makes 60 mil an hour in a VNI (being generous) for 16 hours (24 would get caught easily I hope) for a profit of  960mil a day.... 
---
\-Lose a VNI a day. -120mil 
---
\-Loses time to come back to their computer and reship and restart, lets say 1 hour -60m.... 
---
Thats 180mil less a day or basically a 19% decrease in revenue. Pretty substantial by just adding  scrams to the site. 
---
Additionally VNIs would increase in price as more and more die. More reason to keep GALMIL FW at t1.
---
How much isk are you making doing that?
---
It is definitely risk aversion to an extent but as far as big alliances are concerned there's not really any reason to take any risks i.e. go to war. Structure spam has obviously made it far too tedious as well even if a group does have a reason to start a war
---
The normal price is 1-2M. Someone buys one for 300M, it *might* appear in the price history data, but at some point it is removed and the highest price still shows 2,780,000.43 because that one purchase is an obvious outlier.
---
One thing I want to do is pack a carrier with one ship for abyssal sites (income), some ships for roaming, and maybe a cheap fit for solo dropping said carrier, and just stage out of npc nullsec/lowsec near null
---
broken bot?
---
Sorry, I don't count gate camping as "hunting". Maybe fishing.
---
Same.
---
Thanks, friendo.
---
From what I've seen they are profitable if you can get failure rate to near 0... that means spending 10+ billion on pod + ship
---
Try multiboxing ratting supers or something. It scales better than any other high income activity. It's not the alts that's the issue, it's the low input requirements of rorq mining
---
The way CCP combat botting is to introduce new lucrative pve contents that bots cannot run, like hightier abyss and invasion stuff
---
If you can make enough money to afford Plex and PvP stuff, then why even care about vni bots? bounty generated by them aren't remotely comparable with ratting carriers.
---
My OV says otherwise.
---
If the only players you can mentally associate with hunting other players are gatecampers, then EVE is truly dead.
---
I'll be there again friend. Even know we were shredded by Snuff, we enjoyed coming back in rookie ships and shooting at your Nyx!

can‚Äôt wait for the cope posting
---
But we where sitting next  to your raitaru, but you didn't want to fight there?  
---
So you tell me why you dont fight next to a friendly structure ?
---
&gt;Personally I've been working on some test automation
---
This is good to hear.
---
Decent bait, 2/5
---
What happens's to your State Pro standings when you shoot each other?
---
My favorite part about last night was watching Test sit a 300KM while CVA got pummeled by RC and friends.
---
Welcome to eve.  You must be new here.
---
Game mechanics say NOPE!
---
im sure we will get an announcement tomorrow at eve north
---
Elaborate?
---
*laughs in Thera*
---
If we had moved over to the Raitaru you would have gone all the way back to the gate.
---
I know this must be a weird concept for Provi, but we had to satisfy ourselves with an objective victory rather than also getting kills.
---
Hilarious because that is verbatim from Arkadios
---
Good luck friendo
---
Repair Services will now be available at all high sec station - nice
---
is there a way to transfer ISK, ships, etc to an alt WITHOUT anyone ever finding out, including corps checking through API?
---
is there a way to hire a hit man? i know you can place a bounty, but how would you specifically target another player? just find a corp or service?
---
I'm happy you had a good time whichever side of the fight you were on. First fleet is a big deal!
---
Unfair advantage
---
Really? From what kinds of mobs?
---
This game, and this sub, would be a much better place if all the "Eve is dead" morons biomassed and followed doomchinchilla to Albion online.
---
Please do.
---
Why are you showing us your mums dildo?
---
I would blame the devs on all 3 of your examples.
---
LoL is a shameless MOBA ripoff that didn't innovate past DOTA enough to actually be fun.
---
Overwatch is just a team fortress ripoff.
---
Fortnight was a DayZ ripoff that had the Battle Royale fad hit it and uproot the original spirit of the game and derail it into another stupid battle royale game.
---
The terrible community most likely contributed to the downfall of your provided examples, however, I feel it solidifies my original point of: Devs have failed.
---
yes, I ran some abyssal pockets back when they were introduced. So you're saying invasions work the same ? the fleet is in a deadspace pocket with a timer ? 
---
What about those trig running free in the system ?
---
Will you pay $75,000?
---
look at the posters in the thread now type their name in zkill and see how many still actually play üò≠
---
Agree 100%
---
Gave me an idea....   What if once in a while Thera spawned a hole into null that allowed unlimited mass?
---
Nevermind - hole would go both ways and would mean Goons would just go and control Thera.
---
Are caps even allowed in Thera?  So much about WHs I still don't know.
---
If youre roaming around Oicx/Eha/Kinakka then you are guaranteed to find something. 
---
UnitedFleet(=read russian Karmafleet) always brings frigs n dessies to overwhelm, but can occassionally bring out BS to have big brawl between the locals.
---
Overall, Black rise is alive and well! Atleast in the Eastern part.  
---
Nennamaila has fights for the type of people that love getting outshipped and countered immediately. Only go here if you know what you're doing and expect to leave in a pod.   
---
Also Lowsec Pirate group Kinakka. is recruiting!
---
Because your mom's would scare the innocent children in this group
---
Grats on the job!
---
&gt; would mean Goons would just go and control Thera.
---
Hahahaha, You mean it'd be one of the most epic target rich environments of all time?  "Control Thera" Is VERY difficult to do.
---
&gt;Are caps even allowed in Thera?
---
No, neither are citadels.
---
Besides T1 Logi, what kind of support ships would you usually find in a 20-40 T1 cruiser gang?
---
And they say Sov warfare is hard and slow grind in its current iteration.
---
Yeah, fuck those blobbing bastards
---
Big if true
---
Now that lp aren't worth anything anymore not that much. But I'm not responsible or care enough about selling the salvage. I'm just in it for challenging content.
---
Or would we ? 
---
Now you will never know
---
?? well this is new for r/eve
---
I misunderstood your question, my apologies. I don't know the answer
---
&gt;This places the new cap at 12600 members, which should last the Brave Newbies at least another week or two.
---
Wow, the times have certainly changed.
---
This is awful for the game. You got these rats that require a fleet to go against that barely give any isk reward and then you got the Salvage mechanics where some dude in his hecate walks up to your fleet and steals your shit. Not even suicide gankers could even out the isk cost cause the thieves don't even have much in their loot. This whole thing is an event with no rewards. CMM
---
Nice.
---
Press F to gank
---
Well, it's not just wars, I don't really care personally about big bloc warfare. I like to run small gang, and I'm in Dreddit for friends and the infrastructure that supports us. Even in this, people have become so much more risk averse.
---
They don't have to understand it for it to actually happen.
---
Is akidagi alive again? Did fw on an alt out of ichoriya a while ago
---
Ehm, but if you had killed Provi fleet at Raitaru, wouldnt you have been able to accomplish objective victory aswell?
---
Different length graphs use different stats.
---
Thanks to the people who are trying to shoot the Invading Precursor Entities in the Verge Vendor.    It is a tough fight.  I would help but I don't have a battleship.  I just started the Sisters of Eve Arc.
---
Eve Online might be the most fun PVP game I've played.  First persons shooter games are so repetitive and unfair.  Battle arena type games are too stressful.  People nitpick my playstyle on coop vs A.I.  I tried PVP in World of Warcraft once.  Some high level character killed my character in one hit then flew away. lol
---
community is nicer too.  Hardly any trash talk or negative words in local chat unlike other PVP games I've played.
---
guess I'll wait for the invasion to end before I sell my ores in Jita.  I don't see many good buy orders in Verge Vendor.
---
[preparations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)) are being made against a worst-case scenario
---
There are way better ways to make money. As a "veteran" you should know this.
---
Flair is relevant
---
Try out eha vill and oix this systems are pretty active
---
Having options for group pve content would basically save eve. It puts people out in space, it gets players to play, and it gives hunters something to do besides shitpost on reddit, but they aren't even that good at doing that.
---
Kamil Rojewski, the author of Evernus, stopped maintaining the program since July of last year.  It has retained some functionality since then, but with every update CCP releases it becomes less so.
---
/u/ASK_IF_IM_GANDHI in a recent [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c34xko/revernus_evernus_rewritten_a_soontobe_market_tool/) stated he is attempting to rebuild Evernus in C#.  It is still in very early development with no public release yet.
---
the issue is anything can be made automated in eve online. It's only a matter of time before bots come out that can do abyssal sites 24/7 non stop. What would that be like 2 billion a day? just on T3 abyssal sites. T4 and T5 are harder to do but not impossible then it goes to what 4 - 9 billion a day?
---
Then you can automate c5 and c6 wormholes with a dreadnought. that's uh... billions an hour x 24 hours a day. 
---
I suppose simple ratting is the easiest to automate, with mining bots being the most simple to make (mining is pretty static and boring not much going on)
---
Looks cool, do you have a link for it?
---
So anyone with an opposing voice shouldn't say something that isn't in line with with what you think? Gotcha, will do kiddo. 
---
You want people to talk and read? Try removing downvoting. It won't get removed though, because without downvotes, you fools can't control the message.
---
11/10 for the streams will be there again to shoot, keep up the good work!
---
But people haven't stopped going out in BC/BS fleets because they're risk-averse. They've stopped because...

Quit trying dood. You are so bad. Shouldn't you be begging test to do more of your dirty work üòâ
---
it really isn't that fun to kill bots.  the first one, sure, the second through tenth, yup.  the 100th one.  fuck that.  at some point you turn pvp into pve.  IF the goddamn bot programs would just add a bit more salt into their programs, it would be great.

Let's not forget Provi can't even contain their own Sov... Come on Niding, I expect more from you. Balder would be soooo disappointed.

Cheers from Anchauttes
---
As always guys, if you think I missed something, or got something wrong, let me know!
---
Pve players getting shit on for months at a time, patch after patch and unchecked player activities causing players to take a break/abandon the game? 
---
No, there couldn't be any correlation. The downvotes tell me so.
---
Well, it was a obvious reply mate. And Balder owes me forever, after I repped his tank nonstop in BF.
---
Altho, he will never catch up to my rank there.
---
&gt;what is the single best solo gank ship for wh space?
---
There's no answer to this broad a question, especially since you seem to be hunting in nullsec as well as j-space. 
---
A bomber will have lots of difficulty engaging a VNI - it will apply poorly and its tank is mostly imaginary. For instance, a double paint bomber will apply less than 10% of its damage to a 100MN VNI going full speed. 
---
The Stratios is an excellent option for j-space encounters - it's affordable, covert, dishes out tons of damage and has a strong armor tank in both an active and buffer configuration. On top of that, it lets you fit in tons of utility in the mids and highs. The following T2 fit is what I would consider an excellent all-rounder:
---
    [Stratios, Solo armor double web]
---
    
---
    Energized Adaptive Nano Membrane II
---
    Damage Control II
---
    Drone Damage Amplifier II
---
    1600mm Rolled Tungsten Compact Plates
---
    Warp Scrambler II
---
    Medium Electrochemical Capacitor Booster I, Navy Cap Booster 800
---
    50MN Quad LiF Restrained Microwarpdrive
---
    Stasis Webifier II
---
    Small Energy Neutralizer II
---
    Core Probe Launcher II
---
    Covert Ops Cloaking Device II
---
    Medium Infectious Scoped Energy Neutralizer
---
    Medium Trimark Armor Pump I
---
    Hammerhead II x5
---
    Infiltrator II x5
---
    Infiltrator II x3
---
    Infiltrator II x2
---
    Ogre II x4
---
    Praetor II x3
---
    Vespa EC-600 x5
---
    Warrior II x5
---
    Navy Cap Booster 800 x16
---
    Nanite Repair Paste x200
---
    Sisters Core Scanner Probe x16
---
Other (covert) options mostly come down to strategic cruisers or a PvP Astero. 
---
As for nullsec, you don't really get much use out of the cloak as you show up in local anyway, so you might as well focus on combat performance. In that case, some excellent cruisers to try out are Osprey Navy Issue, Omen Navy Issue, the Gila, or you could try to brawl with a Thorax, Vigilant or your own VNI. Mind you, none of these (other than the Gila maybe) will guarantee you kill the VNI. Those things are mean as hell, deal massive damage and don't have to waste mids on tackle like you do. 
---
As for frigates, my personal favorite is the Retribution, although I've seen Wolves, Jags, Fed Navy Comets and others flown to great effect. 
---
If you want to take advantage of your alts, maybe try putting one in an interceptor and upgrading your main to a battlecruiser like a Brutix or Hurricane.
---
o7
---
Well, they buffed Nestor multiple times
---
5 alts = 100%
---
5 alts after nerf = 80%
---
5 alts after nerf + 5 new alts after nerf = moar profit.
---
You never feel the pain if you just add more bots.
---
what did i say i think?

all ive said in this thread is that people posting retarded suggestions just because they are riding the bandwagon is dumb, and hoping for any meaningful discussion on reddit is pointless.

Yes, you got the name 'Sotiyo' wrong. You called it a 'Soitoio' in the video.
---
Hey! Glad to know it's going forward!
---
How your finals goes? :D
---
How your carebearing going? Still warping vni to sun first :D
---
I disagree, in order to keep people in a game it has to be fun, and contrary to what some people think playing an mmo with other people is much more fun. So if you give people, who would never leave highsec, the opportunity to do stuff as a group they‚Äôll be introduced to more people and new gameplay styles, this in turn makes much better pilots who will have a better chance of finding something they enjoy in eve. Ignoring highsec just makes the issue of player retention even worse, but if you can engage new players in a way unique to eve then we can have a whole new healthy generation of eve players.
---
And I‚Äôm not just talking out my ass, I see this first hand in the corp I‚Äôm apart of, we‚Äôre a highsec corp based simply on enjoying and introducing people to all the stuff we can do together in highsec. With all these recent additions to content in highsec we‚Äôve seen a large spike in the number of new people wanting to join and do this stuff together, and these people are making out to be a fine next generation, which is what this game desperately needs.
---
Hey man any mention of Balder gives me a good chuckle. Glad to have brightened your day!
---
Yeah I can't pronounce anything in EVE, sorry about that.
---
Thanks for covering the lowsec conflicts. They're been fun so far.
---
Ready to send it off to the Bad Dragon Labs.
---
Thats me!
---
Sorry, move what fleet? And if you actually had fleet, suppose better let us reinforce?
---
Well, for starters, we stopped calling it "eve-o"
---
(If anyone ever did)
---
Nah they just put the neut drones in caracals now.
---
I dont beg, I just manipulate üòé

The irony is you post a new thread every day, sometimes twice a day, and you do not offer any new thought either.

Thats Evernus trying to look for a static data export to do things with. But it cant download anything because the SSL certificate is dead or something, so you're probably SOL. I can quick check if my Evernus has a SDE for you...

R/eve is a fun game on it's own.

Bots got that covered.

I mean, I don't do any PvE, so I guess it is a Reddit bot?

Let's all be satisfied hes banned

Can't wait to see the released version!

Only 1 corporation is over that, so not really.
---
don't get popped (‚ó°‚Äø‚ó°‚úø)
---
I read that as ‚Äúit is a shame‚Äù not ‚Äúshame on him‚Äù
---
ahh so theres more than just tornados your fielding then? so what, your probably fielding a heavy armour doctrine to pin them to the gate with at least the same numbers and then you warp the tornados in because... because the 15 extra guys wouldnt have been better suited in the armor comp somehow in bhaalghorns or dps..
---
Yeah, you got the low sec conflict wrong. It's not a war, it's a peasant's riot. But dont worry, Snuffed Out SWAT team has been dispatched with Pen Is Out providing overhead support. We'll release a press statement once we have brought peace to the region.
---
CCP: this appears to be a great, totally real, paying customer.
---
That's a big....
---
It's just the same ship but with a 1600mm plate gaffer taped to the outside

&gt; all kinds of possibilities for the future

WALKING IN STATIONS 2.0 CONFIRMED HYPE HYPE
---
Is intel on a Nyx even a big deal anymore now that everyone owns at least one?
---
better than what we got now :)
---
This isn't really an anti-bot suggestion but it's a good suggestion to increase the risk of running sites, which is way too low at the moment.
---
Oooooooffffffffff
---
Sooo shield slaves when? looks like they got delayed another few years lol
---
No worries! Thank all the people who told me I missed it last time, I‚Äôd love to keep up on the smaller conflicts which make up the fabric of the game outside of the big blocs, but it‚Äôs so rare I can actually find out enough details!
---
Go to your local Card/comic book store, they have "Playmats" for Magic usually, which are just large mousepads. On the other hand, best buy now carries large branded mouse pads but they are usually plaine(just black) and cost about the same as the play mats.
---
As a member of GSF I'll just say that posting a Thanatos mail is fucking stupid.
---
Don't you guys have an actual war on where people are shooting your structures?
---
It's quite a ballsy move to run a 'lol no undock' propaganda piece from that position, to be fair.
---
Did you just ask to have the entire Galaxy redrawn and call it a small project?
---
Yeah, it's pretty low :(
---
Yup. I'm unsubbed on my 2 accounts and just waiting for CCP to make the game more interesting (Man, that Walking in Stations‚Ñ¢ everyone wanted in the game, like an alliance HQ/bar people could hang out in.....WTF CCP?) and the state the nullsec is in right now to die out and becomes more stable and a living breathing society of countless smaller alliances. Because right now it's just filled with afk roquals, supers, vni's, bots and protection under a super umbrella.
---
Me too

mfw  when you are to shit as a hunter, you had to use an awox-tackler to get a single carrier kill and even decide to brag about on reddit...

Definitely. It was a dumb idea because we would all be playing both... Like what? EvE players play NO other game? Cmon. Like i wouldnt have my supers in orbit on one VM while my box fleet is mining away in another set and i'm racking up the kills in an FPS set in my favorite linked universe...
---
How the fuck am i not paying into all of these and enjoying them together?
---
Literally what the actual fuck CCP.
---
kill a carrier. "better post to reddit!"

No CCP I'm not giving you anymore money . Good day sir!
---
We had like a handful of Machs and apparently that was enough to scare you off. I'm genuinely curious to see what Provi's formula is for determining when it is and is not okay for them to ~~feed~~ fight RC.
---
&gt; including dropping the ad homs (though I'll point out that you started it)
---
I literally haven't insulted your character once. That's all you, bud.
---
 &gt;Try reading what you've written from a neutral position, rather than assuming your reader can read your mind, and you'll see why more people agreed with my interpretation of "opportunity cost" than your idiosyncratic usage.
---
Hey, funny, you just did it again.
---
&gt;You can keep calling me a coward all you want
---
Literally never said this.
---
&gt; I seriously consider that I might be wrong when presented I'm with cogent and persuasive arguments, but I also expect my opponents to do the same.
---
The hypocrisy is amazing. This started as talking about your terrible idea and turned into you trying to use strawmans and "extend an olive branch" because you just won't admit your idea is bad. This is just getting sad now.
---
&gt; Your usage of the term "opportunity cost" was either totally incorrect or simply confused and unnecessary
---
No, it's actually pretty dead on, like by definition (https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/OpportunityCost.html). I'm actually genuinely surprised you're still arguing this. People would shift their opportunity cost and work on the next best thing if supers were gone. Honestly, I'm starting to feel like you're just projecting.
---
&gt;and you are absolutely, no-doubt-about-it wrong in your use of "strawman."
---
I'm genuinely not sure if you're stupid or just fucking with me at this point. You are literally building the argument that I don't know what opportunity cost is (you're wrong) or a strawman (you're wrong) to tear it down rather than discuss the original point about Eve. This is ,once again, dead on the definition of a strawman. (https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/straw%20man)
---
&gt; I'm not getting into that if you are what you seem, which is someone totally incapable of admitting defeat.
---
Okaaay, now you're definitely projecting. I get that you think you're clever trying to worm your way out of this conversation, but all it takes is an "I don't know better" or "maybe I'm wrong." You haven't once even made the attempt to disagree with my points I brought up, you just flailed around like a little kid throwing a temper. I'll be here, sitting smug, waiting for your next feeble attempt at trying to feel superior on the internet.
---

You ever flown a jump freighter?   Do you know how many accounts and characters it takes to run cynos for you to get anywhere?

Without that you're stuck with depending on other people (*shudder*) to be available to light cynos for you to your next jump.

Faction Warfare is usually the best shot at "fair" pvp for new players. You can just join the faction Warfare Corp for your preferred faction and start running plexes. They're basically sites you warp to and have to hold for x amount of time, with rewards increasing as time to capture increases.  You get isk and loyalty points (which can be used to buy faction modules &amp; ships, etc) for completing them.  Once you're inside you're forced to just sit and wait, but often enough there will be other solo players trying to do the same thing. That's where you'll get your good fights - just make sure you're scanning d scan all the time so you catch people on the gate to your Plex and don't get surprised.

Yes, the context of you running around with an uninformed opinion and spouting it like it's an infallible argument. I really hope you learned something about yourself from this thread.

Welcome to the rice fields?
---
As long as we are having fun with it. Radioactive said I was being smug (I wasn't). I'll have a response for you tonight.
---
&gt;NVM Nova was cancelled too, it's like they don't want to make money.
---
It wasn't a case of CCP not wanting to make money, the entire reason why they are so desperately trying to create a new IP is for the purpose of making their company more money.
---
The issue with Nova was pretty simple really, it was going to be shit.
---
I don't care what anyone says about "it was only an alpha" that thing looked garbage enough that no Publisher would greenlight it in the current gaming market. It looked like it was going to be a pretty generic fps, even more so than Dust was, and the one thing that could potentially make Nova slightly more interesting (a real and meaningful eve connection) just didn't looked to be on the actual roadmap for that game.
---
The reception was about what anyone with a few brain cells would expect from such a shitty game. That game looked so dull that one could actually believe that it was designed by some no name indie developer using a free version of Unity with assets bought straight from the unit store.
---
Honestly i think CCP knew that the reaction was going to be overwhelmingly negative before they even showed us the footage of it, which means that they were just looking for an excuse to pull the plug on that game.
---
Living in sov space should be a struggle every day, defending what you have against people who'd take it from you. However, it should be a FUN struggle.

Yup, that's a winner right here.

Because all you PamFam nerds can do and win is fighting Proviblock. And I always gives me a smile to see when Provi wins a fight against the red half of the nullsec donut. You been bullying Provi for countless years either kicking them out or 24/7 harassing them in form of "third party/NPSI" alliances/corporations. 
---
Actually.... go ahead just claim all their sov again. Then what's left for you to fight, eh? Goons, legacy? That's gonna give you a huge dent in your killboard.

I do, and outside of EU time there is usually nothing there. In EU you just shoot the HTP/TRC bubbles and content pops out.

I think reminding people that Eve is not just nullsec politics is good for the health of the game! It's amazing that you add coverage to other areas of the game!

How bad do you have to be to think that Provi is a good place to attack?

posting about saving a freeport with hundreds of pilots involved and having gf's is definetly more postworthy than posting about a single awox-carrier kill of which a fuckton die every day..

But before they biomass, they should send me all their ISK. :^)

You mean like incursions and wormholes?

Eve is a better place without him
---
Well tell NC. to undock then.

thx ccp, that patch fixed eve for the 0.001% of us

I disagree but you do you. I was there for that fight and it wasn't much of a fight more than it was a bunch of fleets dancing around each other.

When is horde going to learn being nice to new players isnt yolo swag
---
Wait a minute. Let me get this straight. If you're in an Amarrian FW corp, you show up as purple (in fleet) to Cal FW corps AND also do not receive faction penalties for shooting them, so you aren't locked out of Amarr and Jita?

Bots only use heavy drones right ? If the frigate has decent enough stats, bots will take quite some time to kill it, whereas real players will switch to light drones. I've no idea if bots can actually 'recognize' a tackle frig and switch drones. They would def need a more complex script than warp to site &gt; drop drones &gt; orbit though, which is good.
---
fekin Citedels
---
It's impossible to balance game mechanics and the economy if CCP can't control simultaneous account usage. Balancing requires placing lower and upper boundaries on what is acceptable. The N+1 mechanics inherent in multiboxing allows players to blow past those boundaries. You can't effectively balance the game when a person could be using 1 or 20 accounts. Multiboxing (in conjunction with botting) has destroyed the Eve economy and is ruining the game.

---
I just want to piggyback on this. It takes me ten Cyno jumps in jump freighter to go from jita to my home. Then ten jumps back. It is unfair to ask ten different people to be on my time zone to light cyno. Sometimes I use jump freighter many hours continuously in a day or over several days. It is not practical for me to ask people to do a very boring job of lighting a cyno and then wait for even a tenth of the time I spent moving JF. 
---
Never mind trust or money issue. It is hard enough to find dedicated JF pilots who jump multiple hours a day and enjoy. It must be harder to find 10 people to actually enjoy in a mundane job of lighting cyno for JF for hours on end.
---
If that was meant to be some sort of burn, you'll need to elaborate.
---
You're incorrect in any case. Provi drops caps quite frequently these days, and we're getting pretty good at it. Obviously not every drop is a win for us, but then nobody is successful every time.
---
Awesome, evernus source is available on github though, so you can just keep up the pull requests?

They went great last semester! I was very nervous but I did well.

Hi, im a new player, literally, i have less than 4h experience, and i am hoping for a semi-cancer free time with all of yall!

Evernus is on Bitbucket, and I'm assuming Krojew would accept pull requests, but I don't really work with C++ and because I am a CS student, I figured I would make a project of my own for experience :)
---
That being said, I don't mind accepting pull requests after I get a release out
---
That is absolutely AMAZING! Please post pics once its painted. Would love to see it.
---
I'll take a post from someone wanting to make Eve better and enjoying the game even somewhat over some bitter/salty internet troll anyday.
---
&gt;I'm genuinely not sure if you're stupid or just fucking with me at this point. You are literally building the argument that I don't know what opportunity cost is (you're wrong) or a strawman (you're wrong) to tear it down rather than discuss the original point about Eve. This is ,once again, dead on the definition of a strawman. (https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/straw%20man)
---
Okay, so you've finally internalized what a strawman is:  Namely building up an argument that the other side isn't making, pretending that they're making that argument, and then defeating the argument you just built up to score points.
---
But obviously that's not what I've done here.  Your attempt to explain how that's what I've done here is obviously nonsensical.  Let's dissect the sentence that is the meat of this paragraph, namely "You are literally building the argument that I don't know what opportunity cost is (you're wrong) or a strawman (you're wrong) to tear it down rather than discuss the original point about Eve."
---
You say that I am building up the argument that you don't know what a strawman (limiting ourselves to that dispute for the moment) is.  Yes, yes I am.  You also say that I'm doing it in order to tear "it" (antecedent unclear, but the only antecedent that seems to make sense is "the argument that I don't know what [x] is") down.  Obviously I'm not building up the argument that you don't know what a strawman is in order to tear that same argument down (which is the only way what I'm doing would be a strawman).  I'm affirmatively arguing that you misused the term, not trying to tear down an artificial argument I created.
---
Saying "You're an idiot because you support [thing you didn't say]" is using a strawman.  Saying "you misused a term when you said [thing you did say]" isn't using a strawman.
---
I'd think you're trolling, but you finally got me annoyed enough to look at your posting history enough to see that you misused strawman in an argument with someone else barely a week ago, so I'm going to assume you honestly just don't understand the distinction.
---
Haha haven't worked out what I'm doing with it yet
---
It isn't healthy. The whole design is shit. You can't point anything tacking it, you can't solo camp em, and if a Gunner is online you can't really interact with it.
---
My best advice is being cloaky. Bring smth cheap so it doesn't matter if the DD fires, as that will also kill whatever ship you tackled.
---
Unfortunately I don't think I'm up for the task of painting. I'm still not sure what I'm going to do with it yet !

Suddenly, the small poor corps aren't able to anchor medium structures due to costs
---
The whole idea of citadels is terrible, it removed the idea of knocking on people's undocks to get fights. Notice what happened to the dedicated small gang population after that? They all fuckin quit.
---
if you can't afford a billion isk to anchor an astrahaus then maybe you should not have an astrahaus.
---
I play just not as much as I used to
---
i mean... we could ask further....
---
why should you be able to jump through while tackled?
---
why should you be able to use the gates without fatigue?
---
why should... nah fuck it. ccp apparently doesnt care what happens with their game... so why should i?
---
its kinda sad but not caring about the shit ccp implements is easier and makes the game alot more ''fun'' than complaining and trying to explain ccp why stuff is bad...
---
I was not allowed to join ur corp when i applied.
---
you failed to address my question and point and just started attacking me, thats a very low form of argument.
---
&gt;You have no value in this medium
---
https://imgur.com/a/wNEOTWw  theres my value
---
&gt;therefore you splatter it with your expression in search of community or validation or something else.
---
All i want is to say how dumb all these "ccp should totally do this and that", its been said before, its gonna be said again and ccp wont do anything. I dont want to feel 'accepted' or 'valid', i dont care. 
---
&gt;In turn, creating less value for others
---
If i have no value, then how can i affect others?  
---
This is your contribution.
---
if i can contribute something then that means i have value, whats your contribution to the medium?
---
A true capital umbrella for a rainy day.
---
Your little SWAT team can't handle it alone so you batphoned Pen Is Out?

How do you know their bots? looked more like afk ratters to me
---
&gt;ahh so theres more than just tornados your fielding then
---
Not really. You have the tornados and a sigil. Jast a sigil. A really tanky sigil.
---
Can you tell me why everytime I have my character sheet open and I try moving windows around, eve tells my GTX 2080Ti to drop my framerate from 200fps to 30?
---
What is usually the requirement to set up nullsec JF buyback service? like what skills are bare minimum and how much isk for starters do I need?
---
Also,how profitable, if at all, is it
---
What are you making this in?
---
You must not know me. Move on mate.

They can absolutely read memory and deploy the correct drones for specific scenarios.

You're essentially asking CCP to introduce regulated distribution of wealth, in a sandbox game, all by "simply" doubling the cost of a citadel...

You must be from Russia

question what you about so
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
The short version is that moving windows around is not a thing we've optimized for maximum performance.
---
Fair nuff!
---
Shot a gate couple of weeks ago to get some content.. Got deleted by a keepstar after 10 mins.. It's fun I tell'ya!
---
if you dont care why are you going through the effort to make a reddit post?
---
Pahahahahahahahaa üòÇüòÇ
---
definetely RMT with NPC
---
Why is it exactly that people believe they should be able to do everything in the game with a small gang? This is a vast sandbox multiplayer game which fields thousands of ships during large scale combat on grid with these keepstars, and you are on here whining about not being able to hold grid with ur 20 man t1 cruiser gang. It‚Äôs not designed for you to be able to, that‚Äôs the whole point. It‚Äôs an alliance level investment to defend on an alliance battle level, not your random Friday night fun roam. It‚Äôs this same thinking that has dumbed down and ruined so many other games. If they bow to u and ur 20man gang next the solonerds will speak up about how they can‚Äôt hold grid against the most expensive structure in the game. But ccp why shouldn‚Äôt my 20 man gang be able to camp the keepstar of a 1000 man alliance it‚Äôs just not fair...
---
Sounds like a good way to launder RMT isk
---
I hope you continue your brief adventure into npc pve
---
you want to launder RMT Isk through 3 timers over the course of a week+ not to mention the hours of shooting? Seems like there are easier ways to launder isk
---
What are the pros and cons of each dreadnought?
---
At first glance the tracking on the three turret hulls are abysmall, and the phoenix's large explosion radius is trivial by comparison.
---
Basically I'm set to start training a dread soon and what to decide which to go for. I'm primarily gallente but since you can't receive remote reps in seige the armour/shield decision shouldn't make too much difference I think?
---
I like how you did this
---
If CCP wanted to get rid of bots completely, they would have.
---
lol wat?
---
You seem rather upset.
---
[baby eagle](https://i.imgur.com/A7b2gI0.png)

So exciting, a structure bash
---
Because Concord's sole job is to keep capsuleers from getting too powerful.

Because Concord is just a game mechanic for controlling / limiting PVP.  Same reason why Stormwind guards didn't fight that dragon.

Lol is this that rumored really rare never been seen Himalayan salt?  Because this is a new one.
---
When you kill a couple and come back to the system and see pods warping to/from the sites you know for sure you have a bot.   In one system we killed the same pods a few times before just laughing and moving on.
---
A keepstar isn‚Äôt an alliance level asset? Cause that‚Äôs what the main complaint is here that he can‚Äôt hold grid against a keepstar. Honestly these are the same sort of complaints that drove games like wow to dumb down the talent tree and make content more accessible that now they are currently walking back as they realized it was the wrong choice. Honestly you arguing against it makes u sound more like a developer from 5 years ago since that‚Äôs exactly what they did 5 years ago and now they are walking it back in so many other games. Games are NOT fun when you can solo the top level content, and that‚Äôs the scaling we are talking about in this situation.

Yeah how dare the idea of owning and building stations be a thing!

That would be an interesting idea, mobile FOBs. Small structures that can jump to cynos but can't otherwise move.
---
It would make the Thukker-style nomadic lifestyle more viable.
---
wtf
---
I honestly don't think the botting problem is as big a problem as people make it out to be tbh. It does happen and good on you for dealing with it, however just don't think its as wide spread as people make it out to be.

Hey, I'd just about gotten out of Pre-school by the time they attacked us in 2018.

Should make an FTL mod or something with these ships.
---
What the fuck is a "puzzed"
---
They apparently thrive on salt water.
---
Id prefer pre rework numbers over current any day, but imo panic should ensure that an organised mining fleet has one of them. And more shouldn't be there.
---
A keepstar should be an alliance asset level. But it is not anymore.. There is to many keepstars ingame. If you join a big alliance, the corp you join probably have their own keepstar in the alliance. Hell, I'm a regular scrub and I used to own a keepstar bpo..
---
Iir i get u the nyx kill can i join corp even if i dont have an alt with thr skills u require?

They're actually decently good in wormholes, esp. Pulsars. You can run C5 sites in them if you fit them properly and you can get nearly dread-level tank.
---
&gt;We have a war that I missed in my previous update
---
Np for telling you hurrdurr
---
&gt; Notice what happened to the dedicated small gang population after that? They all fuckin quit.
---
Eh, we're still here.

CCP has a history of flop projects, thats a fact. And you can be in any discord you like, you will not get more or different information than anyone else, that's not how it works. You do not know more than others and as such your opinion on it's status isn't any more true than the opinion of other people.
---
Oh wow so excited for thisnpatch, I can fknally repair in highsec AND knstantly clean my ship! Fuck yes, this is the patch I was waiting for, thanks CCP! I resubbed all 223 of my accounts for this

While I agree there are quite a few keepstars in game they are no where near the proliferation that you describe here. In most cases there isn‚Äôt even a Keepstar on either side of a jb and if there is on one side there is not on the other. Maybe instead of whining about not being able to hold this one particular grid the op should idk look at the name of the jb and see where it goes and shut it off on that side and then gate camp. The whole point of playing these games is to face a challenge and over come it, not to achieve a win automatically by showing up. Honestly with having tools like bombs, bubbles, cloaks and mjds if u can‚Äôt come up with a creative solution to deal with a keepstar idk what to tell you.
---
Lol hull pen does no solo pvp. All gate camping
---
Then immediately use the same bat phone to get init over. Also when can we expect the NER report from your "reporter" over there about that subcap fight you lost yesterday over our forts armor timer...or does he only write about them when you win?
---
try not being in a super blobby alliance?
---
&gt;but where is the fun, it's actually worst than winning EvE for me.
---
Not gonna argue the merits of Mining gameplay, but you basically either scale up your operation so that you‚Äôre always busy, or you do something else while you mine. It‚Äôs especially easy with an umbrella. I used to even run fleets while I had mine out. The irony being that someone would come tell me to stop bearing and get in said fleet...
---
How long have you been playing eve? 
---
I'm wondering this because eve has been going truth a dumb down cycle for the last 5/6 years.
---
You guys getting fights?
---
You doing good, keep it coming :)
---
Coming from test thats amusing; i mean considering you guys start bluing up allsorts of other people when even remotely threatened.
---
good luck! don't forget to ask for help if you get stuck. (‚Ä¢‚Äø‚Ä¢)
---
When are you going to fix the Industry window so it's actually functional instead of making the game chug while loading anything and occasionally just not loading info at all until the game is restarted?
---
i play now for like 3 years.
---
a Veteran suggested me this fit called Bring back the hellcat.
---
Well, JF skills obviously, a JF, cyno alt(s) and 2-3 be is enough to start.
---
I fear the day when they remove the old map altogether.
---
&gt;Why not at least make it worth our time to kill these things.
---
This isn‚Äôt aimed at you specifically, but I hear this a lot and it doesn‚Äôt really jive much with me. Plenty of structures have worthwhile values of goodies that drop in them and they remain untouched. Of the trillions of isk in materials produced each month, the extreme majority of it is done in structures. 
---
I doubt that adding more value to a structure is going to increase their death nearly as much as just making them less of a pain to deal with. Honestly I‚Äôd prefer that method over anything else.
---
I don't have an autistic, but now I want an autistic
---
Are you dense? You're that guy who keeps losing caps on an almost daily basis and goes from one corp without standards to another corp without standards, yet you fail at not even suiting the non-existant standards, because NOBODY in their right mind wants to have someone in their corporation who's losing his caps left and right! After you were kicked from IA you were accepted into Intrepid Crossing where your attempt at awoxing someone backfired on you.
---
People like you genuinely entertain me. You're like the ingame version of a cartoon supervillain who plots and schemes, but ultimately falls victim to his own hubris.
---
For posteriority, entertainment and most of all memes, the link to your killboard:  [https://zkillboard.com/character/2114564181/](https://zkillboard.com/character/2114564181/)
---
&gt; But obviously that's not what I've done here.
---
Yes, yes it is.
---
&gt; "You're an idiot because you support [thing you didn't say]"
---
No, this is ad hominem. There's not even an argument being made with this statement lmfao.
---
&gt;Saying "you misused a term when you said [thing you did say]" isn't using a strawman.
---
when you use this to distract from the original argument, which you're doing right now.
---
&gt;I'd think you're trolling, but you finally got me annoyed enough to look at your posting history enough to see that you misused strawman in an argument with someone else barely a week ago, so I'm going to assume you honestly just don't understand the distinction.
---
Lmfao. You're adorable. Let me know when you actually want to talk about the original topic. I'm getting pretty tired explaining why you're wrong here and I'd be more than happy to explain why you're wrong about Eve
---
Or you can keep typing walls of text. I like it when they get huffy and puffy ;)
---
Screenshot or didnt happen
---
get glassed m8 lol
---
The disintegrator modules, just look on the market
---
If I remember correctly you should contract to Oblivion Watch. Last time I checked the fee was about 70 mil.
---
There should be a can off one of the gates with more info.
---
Lets just put them back on deathstar poses and call it a day
---
I was just saying it‚Äôs a shame he stopped, not shame as in a command to shame him lol
---
AH! My bad, no matter how many times I looked it over, it caught me out, sorry about that mistake
---
&gt;No, this is ad hominem. There's not even an argument being made with this statement lmfao.
---
No, actually it's not an ad hom.  It's an insult.  An ad hom is when you say "you're an idiot and therefore you must be wrong," not just, "you're an idiot."
---
Besides which, as you so kindly pointed out, you can have multiple fallacies in one statement.
---
&gt;when you use this to distract from the original argument, which you're doing right now just to tear it down in order to seem smart, it most certainly is.
---
What on god's green earth is the "it" I'm trying to tear down here?  Your original argument?  I'm not even engaging with that original argument at this point, as you've acknowledged repeatedly.  I'm arguing about a side point.  That's deflecting, not strawmanning.
---
&gt;Or you can keep typing walls of text. I like it when they get huffy and puffy ;)
---
Pot meet kettle.
---
Me reads the patch notes in my deep sonorous voice....
---
There you go sir.
---
At least it wasn't an 8b Carrier.
---
I never said that.
---
That is exactly my point. Previously a jb sat on a deathstar pos with automated guns which no t1 cruiser gang had any business being on grid with. Now the jbs need someone to be there to defend it and the keepstar has a like 25s lock time on cruisers with sub 10 second align times. The op is arguing that it should be easier then they already made it. Honestly how much easier do you want this game to get? Why should it be even easier to camp a jb then it previously was because right now it‚Äôs pretty easy.
---
Warp to the dumpster.
---
They shouldn't. It's dumb. CCP is insane in the membrane.
---
&gt;We've found that people just do not fight for them at all. All that happens is a director alt for the alliance will login to the gunner seat or a travel malediction will arrive not soon after, and they will just point our FC or the most expensive ship and then use the chain doomsday
---
Fun and exciting gameplay.
---
Bout time they tried an event again. Better not fuck it up *too badly* this time.
---
You mean you whelp dreads as fast as you can build the cache. Got it. I have yet to see a battle report where it was a capital fight where you all living in Providence didnt get a serious beating.
---
Death to PVP, you go tell em brave linemember.
---
What's the point in lighting a cyno if you don't have friends to take it?
---
Those structures that are worthwhile to kill are in wormholes with their "loot pinatas" and there are groups that go around bashing them to collect the payment. A mechanic like this would encourage similar groups to spring up in Null Sec and bash structures in order to get that payday. Hell I would love to see the wormhole loot pinata mechanic come to Null Sec as well but we all know CCP would never do it. This is the next best thing and honestly dragging the care bears away from the anoms, even if its just for a bit, is exactly what we should be looking to do.
---
Only Delve? Let them burn everything. Twice.
---
At least you could defang those. And if the defender wanted to repair them, they had to physically drag their asses on grid and actually repair the modules. This would create another opportunity for a fight.
---
Owning and building stations was a thing before citadels, and it wasn't nearly as bad as this garbage.
---
I used to hate station games. I never thought I would miss them.
---
Haven‚Äôt logged in for over a year, that KB makes me think I was quite good at this game. Wtf.
---
\&gt;Refactored Character shadows to make them more performant. Refactored the character animation system, and added in new idle animations which make the characters seem more lifelike.
---
I don't see why CCP would actually invest dev time into these unless Captain's Quarters (or something similar) is coming back...?
---
Moby
---
Very possible, will you have fun? No one can answer that. Plenty of things to do, make an account and give it a try, costs nothing but a little time
---
yes

You probably were better at this game than you thought.

You'll most likely want to pay for the game at some point. If you are enterprising enough, you can buy a subscription with in game currency.

Can't hurt to try it.
---
10/10 Cyno
---
lol mate. You seem to be sadly misinformed about the goings on in Provi. Not even RC's biggest trolls would attempt to make a claim this ridiculous. You'd have to be actively ignoring most BRs to come to this conclusion.
---
Just to set your mind at ease: we've got very good capital production going on now. We put a lot of effort into that after the 2018 PL invasion, since it exposed that as a major weak point back then. We're now more than able to maintain our cap fleet.
---
occasionally they try and defend it.
---
oof. Got sand in the wrong place, mate?
---
NC is shit too.
---
Not likely lol. Napdizzle BernieBrewer was mine. Haven‚Äôt looked in ages but I know there‚Äôs no cap Welps on it ha
---
In hindsight, if you but only ship modules, you might get by without a JF until you get one, just have at least a Blockade runner and balls.
---
Pre-rework they practically didnt exist. Barely used at best, no that wont work.
---
Rorqs arent so much an issue as the ubiquity of ore as a whole. Dont get me wrong the fact you can basicly forget about them baring rats is hilariously broken but there is a cost to it with excavs being so expensive. Skill injectors made it to easy to just get a new rorq alt. And barges are so hilariously usless by comparison whats the point of mining iin anything BUT a rorq. Nvm barges and crystals is a while other set of skills usless to the rorq.. All mining is busted honestly. But when you make the skill path as streamlined as the rorqs whats the point to train anything else.
---
I would like to see a rework of anoms and barges/crystals before they nerf anymore mining. The ore is the problem not so much the way to get it.
---
Until you get out there and actually look. There are constellations filled with 3-4 bots a system grinding away.
---
Time to invest in apparels market boys
---
Yes. And we've been in steady growth since we switched modus operandi to "roam erryday, limit overhead".
---
Removed Darkness smoke effect on the Minmatar Battleship Hurricane (Regular and Fleet Issue) Minmatar Rust SKIN.
---
TIL Hurricane is now a battleship.
---
Better than lurking tbqh
---
like goons did in WWB?
---
So if you are seeing these "Botters" are they being reported? or just podded so they can get a new ship and continue to bot? 
---
If no one is reporting them after seeing them then one could assume that these people are just adding to the problem of botting by not reporting them? I see plenty of people complaining but it appears that CCP are only dealing with a couple of botters every so often.
---
bash em all you want for running, but they undocked.
---
I don‚Äôt have much knowledge, but I‚Äôll give it a shot, and probably learn a few things when the bitter vets will come to correct me.
---
Revelation has the longest range with short range gun, Scorch hitting out to ~60km with HAW guns. It also have a nice tank, because of the biggest capacitor (by quite a lot too) and armor resistance bonus that come with every level of Amarr Dreadnought.
---
Moros is quite special, as it get the best tracking out of every Dread, and the bonus to Repairer cycle time mean your reps land sooner, but it also mean you‚Äôll burn through your capacitor faster. It also has the shortest range of all HAW dread, so kitty ships like AB Moa can be troublesome to deal with.
---
Naglfar is generally your best choice to train in, as you can hardly go wrong with a Nagl. It get nice DPS from autocannons (although half of your range is still in your falloff range). Also, the tanking bonus can be used to better extent, with the use of Ancillary booster that won‚Äôt weight at all on the capacitor (but since only one CASB can be fitted at a time, you‚Äôd still need a second booster).
---
Finally, Phoenix is a good choice with HAW launchers too, since they have fantastic application for battleship sized weapons. However, you still have the long reload time of rapid launchers.
---
 I feel bad for people that read a shitty r /eve post and take it as the whole truth.
---
Not knowing what a ghost site was in an astero I got from mining and selling ores in high sec for hours lmao.
---
This week on "Haha made you form"...
---
&gt; Previously a jb sat on a deathstar pos with automated guns which no t1 cruiser gang had any business being on grid with. Now the jbs need someone to be there to defend it and the keepstar has a like 25s lock time on cruisers with sub 10 second align times. The op is arguing that it should be easier then they already made it.
---
You're fkn crazy.
---
Buy me a tractor!!!
---
Bots use supercarriers and asteroes. They manually target and attack all rats in sites with a VNI. They aren‚Äôt going to even be slowed down by changes like this, even if the anom rats could keep up with a overprop VNI (they can‚Äôt)
---
&gt; Nennamaila has fights for the type of people that love getting outshipped and countered immediately. Only go here if you know what you're doing and expect to leave in a pod.
---
I feel personally attacked by this comment.................. We do our best to kill the pods too.
---
I mean is this a couple?  https://twitter.com/CCP\_Peligro/status/1125796764148224001 All of which used their rmt money to inject new bots to repeat the cycle of bot isk, rmt the isk, get banned, make new alts. Skim the excess money off the top. Its a whole industry.
---
Wow
---
If you can‚Äôt fly doctrine ships, or at least the main DPS, EWAR is always a nice thing as it‚Äôs less skill intensive compared to logistics, where you‚Äôll find yourself starving for Capacitor quickly without decent skills.
---
On the other hand, ships like the Maulus or the Vigil have been great as force multipliers for beginners, in different kind of fleets. And they generally have the range to match cruisers attack range, IIRC.
---
&gt;An 'Attributes' tab has been added to the show info window for NPCs.  This tab will list their damage resistances as well as showing what  damage types they deal. 
---
Totally against that, it make the game even easier about NPC farming than the others MMOs...
---
It's reddit, do i need to have proof?
---
If you have a bug report number I can check on the status of it.  PM me.
---
tbh that number isn't a surprise, but based on the splurge coming from some, every second account is botting.
---
Iirc it‚Äôs because rats are ‚Äúsmart‚Äù and prioritze ewar. They can‚Äôt tell who the ewar is being used on, though, and since a point is technically classified as ewar if you‚Äôre pointing a ratting VNI then you are probably going to draw aggro
---
The NER reporter you're referring to is Salivan Harddin, a member of Snuffed Out, and he's only written up one fight which was a loss for Shoot First &amp; co.
---
EVE changed to beeing ''dangerous'' to a safe haven for all the retards because of gamechanges.. NS was never safer before...
---
How about in the age of stale EVE with lesser and lesser content, lesser and lesser different entities(corps/alliances), lesser and lesser relevant ships, lesser and lesser viable playtypes (blops/smallgang etc.) bigger and bigger blue donuts, we PUSH for stuff that actually encourages fighting ?
---
Like JB‚Äôs beeing able to get camped and thus forcing the other forces to undock and fight instead of just logging in, pressing a single DD button ?!
---
if you are seriously pushing for ''stop making eve easier'' where were you with all the bs that made EVE as safe as it is now within the last 3 years?
---
When articles site something as being officially cancelled, when it has not been, is not an opinion, it is a fact.
---
You can choose to believe it has essentially been cancelled, but spouting off an opinion as fact is disingenuous.  I get CCPs history, I have watched it first hand, but what I don't do is present opinion as fact.  The FACT is that the game has not been officially cancelled, regardless of what your opinion is.
---
You should post an AAR in the NER discord intel channel and then there's a chance that they'll cover it.
---
You realize it auto selects the targets in the order you locked them, right? So just pressing F every 5 seconds and spamming lock (which bots already do, because occasionally a npc doesn‚Äôt redbox) won‚Äôt slow them at all.
---
Why would you not use a Horde alt that gets accepted back next week
---
Technically, you can always warp your character and your alt to a safe spot in space in a quiet system, jettison everything you want to transfer and have the alt pick it up I a hauler. That way, the corporation won‚Äôt find it in the API. Concerning ISK, you can try to liquidate everything in low mass, high value items such as deadspace or faction modules, and drop them in space for your hauler to pick up, then sell it again to get the ISK back (although you‚Äôd lose a negligible amount with market fees).
---
Forgot combat interceptors are no longer nullified, warped right into a bubble. 1.3b deleted. https://zkillboard.com/kill/75502381/ 
---
Then this other time I did see a gang jump through gate, but I was feeling lucky, I mean, I'm cloaky, nullified, sub 4s align, literally can't die. Except they were wise enough to hold position, and I spawned 1k from the Orthrus. another 1.3b right there. https://zkillboard.com/kill/73975467/
---
Had bad sec status or faction standing, tried to warp off in my newly bought Prophecy from the Amarr trade hub undock.
---
Machariel bumped me out in my 4th attempt, 5 people locked me to watch my dying to NPCs 20km from the dock range.
---
Since EVE Online : Invasion came out, I‚Äôve been noticing that rats in Abyssal Deadspace tend to go after your drones more often. This might‚Äôve been exported to known space rats too.
---
Updooted for visibility. Also looking for an answer.
---
I'm not looking for ships to train into, I'm looking for ships to form my own fleet doctrine.
---
It definitely isnt, but it definitely shouldnt be downplayed as a non issue. CCP Peligro released the year to date ban charts. Theres thousands of bans just this year. Each one of those represents a bot/macro user of some kind. Imagine each of those is a vni. Tell me again how its over hyped.  https://twitter.com/CCP\_Peligro/status/1125826828306927616
---
That stops most pve besides abyssals, rorqual mining and explo. 
---
I‚Äôm fine with it as long as wormholes spawn in static (unrollable) gates to system that don‚Äôt need to be scanned every so often to make sure wormhole ratting is also dangerous. Got to make sure we go all the way if we‚Äôre going to kill off pve.
---
imagine how you'll feel when you find out that wasn't even a max dudes frogsiren kta
---
I lost a tackle Stilleto to a Venture... I had no guns lol
---
I Shot a wreck in HS and got Concorded.  
---
-wormholer btw
---
You should repost this in some other subs, ie cooking, gaming try and get as much self promo for your variety stream as possible. Best of luck with your appointment.
---
CCP really showing us great gang design here
---
Testing a smartbomb in highsec for the first time on my Corp mate. He wasn't expecting it. I certainly wasn't either.
---
Cant fool me. PL had at least 20 dudes there
---
why are u so upset yo
---
People ratting in UG- in a carrier know they are going to be awoxxed, they just don‚Äôt care.
---
Like most of the world. Mericans :d
---
internet connection was unstable and i disconnected a few times while combat probes from some tryhards were on d-scan
---
i switched to cellular internet to reconnect and secure the ship, the tryhards were already waiting for me at logoff spot though so the ship remains secure on zkillboard to this day
---
well if you want to stay T1, you can use a couple battlecruisers with command burst (but you won't be "cruisers and below" ). I would advise a meme drake be part of the fleet :D 
---
Otherwise yes, ewar can be a force multiplier. You can put dampeners or target painters
---
So where do I bring my gang if I want to shoot at you guys?
---
/u/aplulu ?
---
tbh its the first time I've seen that image. however if my math is correct its still only less than 10k accounts over a year being banned, out of how many actual accounts? Maybe I'm just not following the issue enough to see all the information, I don't know.
---
&gt; you would have to roam for forever to find someone not blue to you
---
Can confirm. That's why I usually just sit on a gate in GE- and fight whatever comes through lol.
---
Yes. I get caldari standings minus  only. But that wont kick me out of fw since I am amarr.
---
Also you can plex galente plexes but for amarr tier and lp
---
O√Ø ! I‚Äôll try to answer your questions regarding Triglavian Invasions :)
---
There‚Äôs been some organized groups that are running those Invasion sites, however I can‚Äôt come up with any names. Regarding of this content work : it‚Äôs a bit like Incursions, yes, but the rats are way more numerous on the gates, stations, citadels and even celestials like moons. They also put a bigger emphasis on RR their own ships.
---
As of now, Invasions central systems (called Foothold systems) can only spawn in 0.5 systems and higher, however, lowsec systems that are one jump (Adjacent systems) or two jumps (Perimeter systems) are still valid for Invasion, although I don‚Äôt think you get any bonus from fighting in Lowsec, and can still be freely engaged by any roaming capsuleer without CONCORD intervention.
---
IIRC, the rats still don‚Äôt give LP and don‚Äôt have bounties on their heads. However, the real money is in the loot and salvage (I racked up around 500 millions ISK by ninja stealing wrecks in a Catalyst in one afternoon lol, but it was at the very beginning, right after Triglavian salvage got their market value). 
---
Concerning the loot, I know they sometime drop the same blue loot as Abyssal Deadspace that can be turned in CONCORD stations, but it‚Äôs not really worth the risk of being caught with a Suspect timer in a salvaging destroyer. However, if you spot something like Triglavian Datacores, skillbooks (those are extremely expensive !) or those new Mutaplasmids for Assault and regular Damage Control, grab them and get out before you get tackled !
---
And yeah, I managed to harvest some tasteful salt with a Salvaging Catalyst by simply warping on an MTU surrounded by a battleship fleet that forgot to bring a Noctis :)
---
Neither should cynojammers imo. Upwell Structures are too oppressive for these two extremely powerful structures to allow to be defended by them.
---
Warping multiple times to ratting site while doing other stuff same timeand forgot that i warped to site.
---
Several ratting ship losses to rats..
---
Getting more than 5k away from a Ghost site can while hacking it in a Stratios. I had my MWD on and started hacking it before I slowed down enough. It counts as a failed hack :-(.
---
It will be one hell of a grind as a new player. I reccomend getting into exploration to start with planetary extraction on the side. Then work your way up to incursions.
---
A meme drake is absolutely planned. It's not required to be all T1 cruisers of course, but the dps ships will be.
---
I did see a couple gangs there a few days ago, hopefully they keep coming and keep feeding.
---
Even if we assume only 2k of those 10k assumed banned accounts are online botting concurrently. Thats still \~10% of the concurrent logged in player count. That isnt a shocking number to you? And that just the ones actually getting caught.
---
Make eve great again. Just make it hard!
---
nah its just not the same without boosts from head poster
---
smash the supplier 
---
multiple times.
---
Relying on my corpmates
---
We will get shield slaves when Star Citizen launches.
---
yeah fuck that h at the end of 9uy-4h  
---
9uy-4 is just that much better
---
Ah, my bad.
---
ECM, I‚Äôd say meh. You basically entice the entire enemy fleet to shoot at one particular ship (that is generally both expensive and squishy, if you use the Caldari Recons). It might be useful to break the enemy logi chain, however.
---
If you already know what composition you‚Äôll be facing, I don‚Äôt think WD would be very useful since there would be way too many ships to actually have an effect, unless you have a lot of disrupting ships on your side.
---
Warp prevention is always a good thing to have, so some Mordu‚Äôs Legion ships could be nice, if you want both extra DPS and long range tackle, or as a more specialized variant : the Gallente EWAR attack ship and Recons are great too, as they combine the very useful damps and long range disruption and scrambling.
---
Then, I suppose you could add Command Destroyers, as they provide both command bursts (to improve tackle, tank and agility of the whole fleet), and can also reposition everyone quickly with the MJFG.
---
Finally, I suppose energy disruption is also interesting.
---
Righto, thanks. Yea I did a test just now, took me 55 minutes to scan down, loot and salvage 4 Hierarchies netting me cool 240m loot + ~45m bounties, not bad at all. I seem to remember hierarchies taking much longer to do, but now I'm guessing I was doing them wrong or my ship was bad.
---
You keep saying "you". I do not think it means what I think it means.
---
Here is a hint, I don't have a reporter, I don't know what you are talking about.
---
Can you recommend an Alliance? I would do that. I've got like 50 bil so the loss doesn't bother me but I really just wanna play with my couple of friends.
---
Nope, I don't. Don't care either.
---
Correct, but that cost does not equal the cost of an injector.
---
That is FTL right there, well done.

EVE Classic confirmed?
---
Have lost many ship over the years.
---
But the lamest  one must be when i jumped trough a wh to HS with a expensive t3 with an alt.
---
Alt+Tab to a alt and did not know he had bad standings to the faction..
---
He was sitting at the wh in a pod :)
---
Hes had two articles regarding the area actually.  But I like your coverage better.
---
Why not must try it in game? Buy script, load in the bay, undock?
---
Man, I hunt them with blue spy alts in a few different areas and there really are tons of them. It‚Äôs often a handful of people that run them all but there‚Äôs spots in places like Wicked Creek where you can jump through a cluster of 3 or 4 systems and see upwards of 20-30 VNI bots all run by the same guy. You can tell because they‚Äôll all have the same fits, similar names, the same amount of days in corp, and they‚Äôll all have the same undock timers. I‚Äôve literally just padded my killboard from relentlessly farming them over the last month or so and at least in that area, there‚Äôs more bots than real players. The bots all pull their drones in the same server tick and undock from different stations in the same server tick. Those could be the result of input broadcasting in theory, but then they‚Äôll all simultaneously warp off to different sites, which you can‚Äôt do with input broadcasting.

You can absolutely have fun in EVE without paying. As a free player, you can fly everything from frigates to battleships - you're only locked out of T2/3 ships and capital ships. There's a lot to do, and even a newbie can both have fun and be helpful in a fleet fight! It'll be more difficult and time consuming to get money and train skills as a free player, but it's still very doable.
---
&gt;That is exactly my point. Previously a jb sat on a deathstar pos with automated guns which no t1 cruiser gang had any business being on grid with. 
---
Then your dumb, death star poses with a jump bridge are not all that effective at dealing with cruisers like you could RF the guns in like 5 minutes. ( it takes 60 minutes over like 8000 days to do that with a keep star ). 
---
like the idea that the game is being made harder on well anybody but people that want perfect safety is a freaking joke....
---
not anymore than panfam have.
---
We don't. We're too busy landing on the moon and inventing human flight.
---
You could defang and kill a JB tower with a gang like what the OP describes in the past though, having the JB took up resources from the tower and you would need at least 3-4 gunners who were all coordinating (to be able to focus multiple pos mods on the same person) in order to operate a deathstar POS effectively. 5 Augorors with 15 Vexors/Mallers could do it just fine without coordinated gunners since the weapons would just do fleet-wide damage that was easily manageable, the biggest risk was that multiple ships were pointed by the tower and you needed to rush to defang (1.5m HP each on standard points, 3m on the shadow serpentis ones) in order to be able to extract if needed, since you were committed on the field until it was killed. (Smart Gunners even if there was only 1 present would control the points and keep FC/expensive ships like CS/T2 logis pointed for your counter-gang) so was very risky, but it wasn't a guaranteed loss. 
---
A keepstar requires 1 person to login into the gunner seat with their alt and the aggressors literally cannot do anything except feed you their 3 most expensive ships each time they reinforce your JB at minimum even if you don't actually show up with anything. There is no way to mitigate damage from, avoid or defang the citadel DD and point so you cannot reinforce it with any real roaming gang looking for a fight.  
---
Also JBs gave you fatigue and you couldn't use them while bubbled/pointed. 
---
Generally speaking, Ansiblex are more manageable on Fort grids than old JB Towers, since you can honestly kill people on them with 3 AFs now (Whoever gets structure aggro just burns away and pings the missiles off), but Keeps are significantly worse since there is no way to avoid the Vorton Projector while within 100km of the Ansiblex. 
---
You need to take into account that the new jump-bridges are significantly more powerful than the old ones. No Fatigue and no way to AoE tackle people on them or to prevent them from taking them is a massive buff. 
---
I think it's pretty reasonable to make them L structure and below at maximum myself in exchange for that huge power.
---
Can you share your Hawk fits?
---
Shocking? no, concerning? yes. I like to see that 2k compared to how many accounts login in a 24 hr period to get a real picture. For me looking at it concurrently gives a artifically high percentage in my mind.
---
F2P in EVE is comparable to the World of Warcraft free to play model, where you are capped at level 20 and locked out of the majority of the game. You can play forever, but many activities and ship types will be unavailable or only available to you in a limited/suboptimal form.
---
Vertiso Ambralle
---
Are you reporting them though?
---
Every single one. (Usually after I kill them.)
---
Could just add Citadels to the bounty system at the alliance or corporation level for payouts Ie for Goons when a citadel of theirs is destroyed it pays out a percentage to either the individuals or corp or alliance that does it?
---
The billboards used to play player ads. I wish they brought those back, those were amazing.

Note: Propaganda is made for us to poke fun and get a laugh during wacky war time shenanigans. This is by no means a personal attack. If you're someone who gets easily tilted by internet spaceship propaganda, well, that's your problem.

Done in FireAlpaca using an Intuos Pro.
---
Its called a carrier and a small pos.
---
IMHO, my point still stands; lighting a cyno 24/7/365 as a main job is most likely more boring than bashing uncontested structures. The original idea was asking our opinion on playing on just one account in eve. 
---
At the very least, you get a killmail. 
---
But I‚Äôll admit in that, provided that you are standing tethered 24/7/365, then yes, that is most likely more boring than lighting a cyno. 
---
But to bring this back to the main point: It is not practical, or at least very difficult, to play eve on one account.
---
Can't PI as an alpha player anymore.

I tried to gank a Gila in Low-sec with my Statios, during the blood-raider event. Turns out, he had buddies, those buddies were Concord. Also turns out, I was not actually in Low-sec, that was my dumbest ship death.
---
Alphas can have fun, train your gunnery / missile skills up, including armor / shield and head out to null... plenty of ships to vapourise
---
eh the blitzing the burner's is not to much risk form what ive seen and a carrier is petty hard to catch, and not that costly any more.

SHAME!

Having just lost another citadel this week, I have to wonder if there really is need for an incentive to shoot citadels.
---
cant see why they cant add in sub system targeting for cit's it be interesting at lest and give them the ability  to be rep'd by defender's and now you have a reason why you cant just sit in tether while the structure  die's.
---
Best of luck my man, keep strong and keep smiling üëç
---
Unfortunately, it‚Äôs hard to do. Unless you physically see them in the act, it‚Äôs hard to determine whether or not they‚Äôre bots or just some guy turbo krabbing. And then when you ban them, they just make more alpha VNI accounts.
---
This made me laugh, very understandable lol
---
I once postured i was gonna gank a miner and they agressed me first, much to the same effect.
---
Momentarily forgot where I was and killed a pod, on a gate, in hi sec for no real reason.
---
I don‚Äôt think I even saw the pod explode.
---
You are a bit psychotic
---
A tiny shitfit T1 cruiser gang can ref a JB now and you complain about it?
---
Only enough to comment on me? Mk
---
Recently lost a 4b paladin. I undocked in amarr with a myrmidon to get the kill right timer, docked up and waited it out. 
---
I then flew to our entrance to W-Space, and right as I got to Niarja, P I R A T caught me, I managed to tank a good few proteuses, couldn't kill them but it was fun. 
---
in my defense I didn't know kill rights had to have a kill mail to expire.
---
articles? plural? i think the only ones who did that were pcgamer (as far as i'm aware), which is well... pcgamer. and they updated their article. others talk about the cancellation of the alpha which is defacto not wrong. so there is no official misrepresentation of it's state as opposed to your claim.
---
And if people say this on this sub then it's out of justified bitterness over the history you stated you know very well. things that are said here are opinions, not facts. neither what you say nor what i say has any relevancy to the actual state of that game.
---
&gt; It's dying of natural causes - a.k.a old age.
---
Though I'm sure that is a factor, I think mismanagement is a larger part.
---
Most systems you jump in that has Gemini Whale United in it likely has most of the characters less than 3 weeks old.  Names are usually random characters and we do report for bots.  Check out O1Y in Fade next time you have a chance.
---
Occasionally we'll find a random carrier that chooses to warp to an citadel in lieu of POS and start orbiting at 500. We just stay in system and we'll have someone reship into a macharial and then we bump them off  for an easy kill.
---
welcome to new eden, friend. (‚úø‚ó†‚Äø‚ó†)

PL: Papers pLease
---
Polarization when you jump through them. Reduce the spawn around range. Make them only anchorable 1000km off structures. 
---
This is what's gotta happen.
---
Seems like the right place. Thanks to all the people in game for being nice to a new bro. Even as a goon, most of the NCPL people I‚Äôve spoken to while hanging out in local in random fleets have been pretty friendly, if you don‚Äôt approach them with hostility. Same with the goons who are exceptionally helpful. It‚Äôs been a really pleasant experience from everyone involved
---
Also shoutout to brave / banderlogs / conifers to always being down to scrap when we roam up to your space in a small gang. There‚Äôs a ton of content right now, if you‚Äôre not afraid to welp your ship and it‚Äôs pretty great
---
Wild exaggeration is a good way to get your shitty point across I hear.
---
5 guys online. So unspoken max formed too.
---
I got a few, because I really want to get back into playing Eve here and there.
---
1. I was omega, and skilled a boat load of stuff, and pretty sure it covered all of the Alpha skills available. Is this character now kind of super alpha, and can use more skills than a regular alpha?
---
2. What is the best way for an alpha to make some money? I want to join a corp, but have no clue where to start, or who is the nicest to noobies
---
3. What is the best ship an alpha can fly for Ratting, Exploring, Mining and PvP? (I am really fond of Rifter, for PvP)
---
4. Is it even possible to play Eve casually?
---
Show me on this Doll where they touched you.

Apocalypse Now boasting over capital production yet cant claim their sov back from the neutral states. Yea. Come at me when you get your shit together. Dont make me go grab the last few whelps you all have had to out on display.
---
Seems like it would be pretty easy to identify then... the player hit F exactly every 5 secs for the last 10 hours. 
---
So back to my original comment, Ccp doesn‚Äôt care. Scramming would least let players police themselves.
---
Interesting stuff, ty for making the video!
---
*Giggle* wormholes, you really are a special lot :-).
---
*shaking with laughter*
---
Lets be honest here, what you are advocating for is for easier camping of a gate to hit some sort of loot pinata that comes through without knowing you are there. The forces coming out of a group that has a keepstar are going to be too big for some 15-20 man t1 cruiser gang to handle and is just going to end in a turkey shoot. It in no way encourages the type of fighting you are looking for. It is just going to end in you making some other post saying that you got blobbed just like  this "lesser and lesser viable playtypes (blops/smallgang etc.) bigger and bigger blue donuts." You are not even advocating for what you want in the end.  
---
As for where was I for the last 5 years, well i was running a mid sized alliance that had to deal with how to bring content to a 20-40 man gang on a daily basis and enjoyed the opportunity to be creative in the solutions we found. Then when I ran out of time to run the alliance we merged into TEST and now just run our creative 20-40 man content in corp such as taking a 'moreau' from the likes of frat and holding it until we could extract it. 25 successful defenses against larger forces before we could pull it. The only thing different for me now is that I don't have to stay up 20 hours a day worrying about my sov getting trucked by some larger entity. So yep certainly have no clue how to find content for said 15-20 man gang.
---
&gt; I was omega, and skilled a boat load of stuff, and pretty sure it covered all of the Alpha skills available. Is this character now kind of super alpha, and can use more skills than a regular alpha?
---
Nope, you will be locked out of Omega skills you have trained until you become Omega again.
---
&gt; What is the best way for an alpha to make some money? I want to join a corp, but have no clue where to start, or who is the nicest to noobies
---
Exploration is the general concensus for best isk for what an Alpha can fly.
---
&gt; What is the best ship an alpha can fly for Ratting, Exploring, Mining and PvP? (I am really fond of Rifter, for PvP)
---
In order, Vexor Navy, Astero, what the mining frigate is called, Any pirate T1 all the way up to Battleships.
---
&gt; Is it even possible to play Eve casually?
---
Very. Depends on your goals of course, but it's very easy to play casually.
---
It‚Äôs going to be almost 10 fucking years ago and I didn‚Äôt tell anyone then because it was so embarrassing and it‚Äôs still embarrassing so, it‚Äôs going to be my secret.
---
Hulk #4: I had a clear window to the celestial and the boat wouldn‚Äôt fucking align in the belt so because I couldn‚Äôt warp off I lost a ship for absolutely no good reason.
---
And: I was mining in a deadspace pocket and I fell asleep. Between the thing resetting and my snoring through that I lost my ship. How did I lose my ship? Fucked if I know. ‚ÄúBut why didn‚Äôt you petition CCP to get your boat back?‚Äù Because I‚Äôm not a little girl who goes crying to mommy when I fuck up. I get a new boat and I carry on. It‚Äôs EVE Online, it‚Äôs not My Friendly Pony land.

Remember, no dino.

Flying into your own smart bomb :-). Such a classic.

Hurricane on a long autopilot with two lowsec jumps.  Jump on youtube and start digging into cool music with every intention of coming back before autopilot hits lowsec.  Get distracted.  Come back to my hurricane getting gangbanged by 5 dudes and shields almost depleted.  
---
Just sat there and laughed as they finished it off, not much I could do.
---
It doesn't make sense though
---
when i still kind of new I lost a battleship being baited while doing a mission. "it's just a frigate" i thought. That was when I learned about tracking.
---
The Keres is a legit menace. It is a massive force multiplier for a fleet of almost any size.

*Ouch*

Better to get in a cheaper ship and have an alt or Corp mate kill you for it
---
Does it have a bunch of typos? Someone I used to share a desk with bought one and I hate it.
---
Okay.  But I want it to only appear during the time opposite all structure vulnerability timers.
---
Find someone willing to shoot the person you want dead and pay them. Do your best to vet to make sure you aren't paying that person to kill themselves.

Using an insta-align T3D to run escalations in lowsec, forgot to switch back to prop mod and jumped into a camp.

I was only saved from this by a yellow safety. It seems a bit weird that it's a criminal offence while salvaging a wreck isn't even suspect.

Some nice small QOL stuffs here :)

WTS LIMITED EDITION BOOTS JUST 2B

So you are saying we went from an Automated system that would pin down the fleet until they died or won, with 1.5m HP as a baseline to shit down 1 module.  The automated system would force off the uncoordinated and unorganized fleets with no logistics or poor fits.  
---
Now we have a tower that costs 100x times more, needs someone online to shoot it, kills 1 target ship, and 2 other soakers?  And it can do this once every 10 minutes...
---
So what you are saying is you want to reinforce a jump bridge on a gunned keepstar, that uses its doomsday, and not take any losses?
---
Try talking to bombers bar if they are still a thing, I imagine they would love that.
---
and now to paint it with golden color :)

Got caught in an old shitfit industrial ship in hisec by wardeccers. Saw I had a jammer fitted. Trying to escape I locked, hit the module and quickly got concorded.

I don't know exactly who you are trying to convince of this nonsense, mate. Everybody who cares already knows better.

As for the sov. If your flair is accurate, you should know better than anybody about TZ incompatibilities and why people aren't eager to go grind structures/sov outside their TZ.
---
Normaly they said July patch
---
If you mean the sign, it actually means "no dragons"
---
I'm sure you can figure that one out.
---
Doesn't matter, you didn't have to you could fight on the grid with it without having a 100% chance of one ship being insta deleted by the DD (or more) so your comparison doesn't line up.
---
JB's were a source of small gang content, CCP erased it.
---
lil ketchup, problem solved.
---
&gt; CCP ~~have~~ has realized that . . . .
---
CCP is one entity with many people.  But, it is treated in the singular.
---
A T1 cruiser gang could easily fight on a JB pos bud.
---
08:10 'ihub flipped to goonswarm federation'
---
makes it sound like it was stolen/transferred instead of destroyed and a new one put in its place.
---
I mean if I get why NC doesn‚Äôt want to fight goons.  What‚Äôs the point, it‚Äôs not realistically possible to win.
---
So, the actual weapon for reffing JBs isn't the high mass cruisers it's cruise ravens but besides that I agree completely: JBs in range of keepstars shuts down a lot of potential fun fights on the 20-30 person on each side scale since you just get DD'd whenever you shoot a small upwell structure. in the past my corp used to camp the jump bridge in SLVP on the regular and it lead to some fun fights but now there is a keepstar there so we can't bring fun stuff to shoot at it because it get's dd.
---
Hah, that reminded me of the time I was stealing shit in hisec, and some dude scrammed a wreck instead of suspect me. GG, I'm pretty sure it was something expensive too, but I didn't get to whore.
---
Lost a BR carrying ~ bil cargo in Rancer to smartbombing BS. The one goddamned time I forget to use my ping...

Lore wise Concord has moderately strong ships but not imba ships.  They are very strong against capsulers as they interfere with their ability to interface with their ships.  So your sp goes to 0

yep, that was joke...context based on 'Murican measurements
---
You simply can't wardec most of eve and not have this happen.
---
I cba to reply to this with any effort, and there's no point in arguing with someone who's incapable of thinking they can do any wrong or that there can be anything wrong with their 'group', or that their beloved leaders can do anything wrong.
---
I will say you should consider being more open minded, everyone and everything has it's flaws. If you honestly think Legacy has NOTHING wrong with it... Then you're legitimately just a posterchild for brainwashing and mob mentality. Everything has it's flaws, the difference is knowing them and accepting them.
---
And even though I don't play anymore, I can sure as hell say I know a lot more about what goes on than you do, since my only interest in EVE atm is to observe with an objective outlook and keep track of what goes on, to dig for every bit of information I can... Because watching real people make a story is way better than following some garbage, scripted TV show. And I still have friends that I talk to frequently that play, in every bloc, anyways.
---
Go educate yourself, because if you honestly have such a narrow worldview, where things are so black and white and the 'side your on' can do no wrong, and the people you fight against, in a VIDEO GAME no less, are horrible in every way... Then you're the kind of cancer that this planet is better off without. It honestly disturbs me that people like you have the right to vote.

Finally something my family could enjoy

The way I fly, I might as well have 0 SP.

I feel this in my soul.

&gt; Nope, you will be locked out of Omega skills you have trained until you become Omega again.
---
But lets say I trained 6 mil points, and alpha caps off at 5. If the other 1 mil were also in alpha available skills, would I be able to use that other 1 mil?
---
Gotcha. I saw I was able to get 15 days of omega from twitch prime. What are the skills I should target to work on during those days?
---
just because these are ''player made stargates'' doesnt mean they shouldnt be balanced.
---
Blops dropping is fairly rare now, but bridging for a fleet is still alive and well.

A dedicated small gang group would never run from an equal force.

You can't put a Citadel on a gate. So...

Good to hear you are getting the same results.  Have fun with this!  If you have any questions always feel free to message me in game.

You got to hand it to Pantsufan. His alliance Skeleton Crew are supposed to be clearing The Spire yet he keeps managing to get TRI/BOT/Slyce and PL to do the clearing! That's some top level diplo shit right there. Who'd have thought Tri and friends would end up as Pantsu-pets lol.
---
Oh heavens no. It's because Eve isn't hardcore enough and has become too soft. What we really need is to get rid of the crimewatch system and allow a complete free-for-all where people can get blapped at any time and in anyplace with no consequence. 
---
I'm sure new players won't quite after getting camped in to stations by groups of sperglords just out for the lulz. 
---
What about all of the emergent gameplay when players can't jump gates to get to a trade hub without there being a gate camp on the other side ready to instablap them?  
---
How about trying to run missions while there are groups of players camping stations for mission hubs waiting to gank anyone that undocks? 
---
Nah man, you don't understand, we're totally missing out.
---
At least they tried to fight. Probs for that. I expected them to bluebell.

The part where you can't anchor a keepstar in locking range of a Stargate, but you can anchor an ansiblex within locking range of a keepstar.

Why is wanting to be a good hunter unhealthy?
---
You have now left time and space . You have now just entered ,,,, CYBERSPACE .
---
and the structure was \~2.6b of the losses
---
With current war mechanics, it's not possible to repair between alliances in high sec ... so a normal fleet with logistics and a nice doctrine with several alliances  isn't possible.
---
Consequences at last, thank you CCP!
---
Good vid as ever Jin
---
I remember when they specifically changed bubble mechanics because they could pull people from gates into range of a citadel's weapons, which was deemed oppressive. There was also mechanics allowing you to chase targets through gates if you wished to catch them.
---
Maybe we should have consistency with these player built gates and allow anyone to jump through them, and for them to not be anchorable within the sphere of influence of a citadel. After all they are gates.
---
It's in colour, so that's good I suppose.
---
Two lines of thinking. One is going for the Big 14 or whatever we're calling them these days. Basically they're the fitting and support skills that benefit EVERY ship. The other is picking what you think you'll have the most fun doing and skilling into that.
---
So in other words SNUFF are running to the only combat they can handle- dropping supers on small groups.
---
Why would you need to switch to light drones when your VNIs already gets near perfect application even with Heavies?

PvP week in my first corp, friendly fire enabled for seven days, corpies were randomly assigned to each other as adversaries. The fights were announced on a short notice. I minded my own business, rocking the SoE epic arc when I saw a corpie in a Mega right in front of the Arnon undock. I immediately knew what was up, I jokingly told him to fuck off. We didn't point each other since we both had the mutual agreement of duking it out properly (running was no option because I didn't want to be "That guy" in corp). I managed to build distance and right when I hit the 30 km mark, the Mega exploded. I apologised for his loss, to him, the CEO and everyone else, hoping I wouldn't have to pay up for that loss, since a Mega would have totally blown my finances. However, after some investigations it turned out, my corpie dug his own hole as he fired up an ECM burst right at the undock which hit everything but me.

INIT. PoV AAR: I took out a small Ferox fleet to go whore on this Astrahus because reasons. We had a couple of complications on the first skirmish resulting in us losing a Ferox and two Basilisks. I was able to keep our distance from the fleet on the second try so we were able to focus on the objective. With the other fleets coming in for their slice of the cake the Astrahus went down pretty quickly. PIRAT's Cerbs fucked off pretty much as soon as the structure blew up. We then went home about a minute afterwards.

More resistance than the north is giving.

You know you can program in some variation and randomness to key presses...

He could save others from not noticing their unoriginality, but not himself
---
I've camped POS jump bridges with &lt;5 man groups before . . .
---
While they are ungunned, which you can easily see based on the lack of a AFK pod with corp title `super important POS man`, you weren't at any significant risk of dying to the POS guns if you played smart, and if you weren't some noname goonie chances are you were at least somewhat knowledgeable in the various methods of mitigating the shitty POS AI.

Ok, slight update: 1.your not some genius who has found the cure for r/eve 2.your idea will not be implemented into the sub 3. stop being thirsty for karma

Full BR, sorry about the shitty link
---
I uncloaked to launch probes in a data site that I was leaving. 
---
In a sleeper data site. 
---
They instalocked and instapoped me.
---
So serious thought. Why can we not invent off t1 bpos to get m3/m4 mod bpcs?
---
WOW IT'S FUCKING NOTHING.
---
What happened to the tiericide that was scheduled for this summer? Oh yeah, they silently pushed it back to September and hope everyone didn't notice.
---
Didn't notice I wasn't in prop mode until I'd already pressed warp and got tackled unfortunately. Good info though.
---
All good.  Fuck those guys.
---
Why not, I do it all the time (on Reddit that is) it's not stalking if it's public
---
Hey remember that time  you joined Unspoken claiming to be an FC and had no clue how to manual pilot, then went AFK and got booted? I remember. Glad you joined Tri though; I enjoy getting your killmail everytime you undock :D
---
cause its weird you nerd
---
Correct
---
Your art is shit and your thirst for fake internet points is too obvious tbh
---
I've been winning EVE for the last several years; is krabbing ratting? If so when and why did it change?
---
Love you too boo
---
The edgelord is strong with this one
---
Actually my intentions were not good, I was pointing out the, once again irony, of you doing exactly what you've been telling numerous people not to do.
---
Any recommendations on how to enjoy this game again as a PvPer?
---
I played a while ago (Stopped in ~2016) and I just find it hard to not be jaded with the game as it is right now. Sov Nullsec is just orbit-&gt;F1. NPC Null seems dead. Low seems dead, and WH seems like it requires you to have multiple omegas that are bathing in isk.
---
Was wondering if you guys had any recommendations for what a single account player might do for fun in regards to small/medium scale PvP these days? Besides solo PvP, because even though I enjoy it, playing EVE alone gets a little boring.
---
Umm, myself?
---
Yep, this is why I don't tell people. It's easier
---
I was WH spelunking the other day and popped out in an isolated 0.5 sec system, decided to scan down some sigs and found a combat site... warped in on it to find a Stratios had the same idea.  
---
So I go "fuck this guy" and point, start applying damage, and suddenly I am taking damage, then quickly in a pod....
---
Was p high at the time and I gave the guy a "gud fite" in local... a couple jumps later I realized what happened.
---
Yeah I don't really know how to fix it. I've asked EQ11 (Streamfleet's Audio/Visual) guy and he can't see anything wrong so I guess I'm just cursed with bad audio.
---
oof
---
part of me wants to ask what the fuck you're talking about but the majority of me doesn't give a rats ass so carry on
---
As if everybody didn't have it in their bio.
---
You could stuff the following into a hoarder's ammo compartment:
---
Ammo, cap boosters, drugs, mining crystals, command charges, bubbles, repair paste, probes and any script
---
They‚Äôre advertising rather aggressively. I see PLEX ads everywhere, and if I didn‚Äôt know what EVE was, I‚Äôd be turned off by them.
---
Depends on the situation really, but in your case probably not.
---
I was in a day old rattlesnake and jumped into a low sec system to go rat (first stupid thing). Tengu was there at the gate, and I just thought "meh". (2nd mistake.) I warped to an anom and watched the Tengu pass me in warp. I landed and was immediately pointed. Tengu's friends showed up and I was smartbombed out of my stupidity and close to 1b.
---
It's almost as if it was a bad thing that they are having fun.
---
Relatable. Right on spod!
---
Was a lot of fun, I guess it will happen all over again in 2-3 weeks?
---
Have you ever thought you're just bad at communication? My friends ask me for crazy EVE stories.
---
You can violence my spaceboat anytime, commander.
---
take my upvote SIR o7
---
I just don't tell people it was in a game, it's easier that way, and makes distant family members think I'm in the military sometimes
---
Shouldn‚Äôt be the case. Seems as if you are digitally amping a low gain sound signal so you end up with a terrible signal to noise ratio.
---
Samanuni and Ichoriya
---
Oof, a little tilted, are we? Lmao
---
&gt; Which part of "these are meant to be player made stargates and not pos jump bridges" is so difficult to understand?
---
"Can't ever nerf ansiblex gates for any reason whatsoever because otherwise they would be too much like pos jump bridges" weow what a dumb argument.
---
If thats the case, whats the range comparable to a gate that they jump through? Can I camp it with a handful of recons?
---

&gt; "roam erryday, limit overhead".
---
This is what we do as well, reduce costs and enjoy ourselves.
---
Don't need to fly 2b t3s.
---
I visited CODE site after I found mentions of them in rookie chat, where they have all the information, stumbled upon some texts like "why we gank" or the one about "lesser beings" who are highsec venture miners. Basically the text reminds me of some hardcore propaganda "why we are in charge and why is it important to shoot every wrongdoer". Even if it meant sarcastically, they do practice "ransoms" by threating various players to literally hunt them down repeteadedly if they refuse to pay "the bill".
---
This behaviour is unacceptable, I think. Even mercenaries and some outhright pirates have higher moral standarts and reasons to fight.
---
I see. Is there a 14 day skill that I can skill that I can still use as an alpha? I was essentially going to load up everything I could find while still in alpha mode and queue it up, then enable the twitch omega and just let it go
---
CCP smoothbrains
---
What does this mean, exactly? 
---
Can't they just drop another Citadel and keep doing what they've been doing?
---
We all are, we all have autism.
---
In seriousness, your friend sounds like a cool dude though, you should get him into it.
---
I miss my Beagle....
---
Ok... listen...When you say it like that it sounds like a much larger (but not like your mom large :p) project, lol.
---
Yes
---
Now if they could just spawn a gate to empire from stain
---
why did you think there has to be a THIRD post about the exact same thing?
---
&gt; Please tell me how many JB pos's you reinforced with a 15 man T1 cruiser gang, I will wait.
---
Confirmed that the loudest mf in this thread has no idea what he's talking about lmao
---
'goes really well?'
---
they went even when heavily outnumbered and that includes the structure loss lmfao
---
Yo momma so fat I had to "Right Click &gt; View in Planet Mode" just to look at her!
---
Yes, it will be absolutely possible to have fun.
---
Having fun while trying to grind several billion isk a month to pay for an account, while having a low-SP character that can't do (for example) 30 hours of Rorqual mining a month, or 20 hours of Incursions ? Much less fun.
---
Just play the game. You'll have a fair while before the FTP limitations are too oppressive, and by that time you'll have much better knowledge of how you'd go about funding plex.
---
And if you end up going to the limits of alpha and you're still having fun - well, it's about fun per hour, right ?
---
the corps that were dec'd from that structure will no longer be at war with them for 2 weeks
---
yay guys we did it we stopped the evil wardeccer
---
(anchors another 600mil structure)
---
excuse me its Jerome from NC not Jeronica kthx
---
Oh, it almost wasn't. I was painfully lazy with this. I usually do far more intricate things than this. Propaganda tomfoolery is a new thing for me.
---
puzzed
---
they did pretty well in a 1v5...
---
After doing who knows how many ghost sites properly, forgot to turn off the MWD while orbiting the can. 
---
Started the hack. Ended up in a pod a few seconds later as my Cheetah with ~500m in cargo slingshotted out of hack range.
---
All it means is, the wars that were attached to that structure (20 or so) end and pirat can't wardecc them for 2 weeks. They can still drop another HQ and put in 20 different wars though.
---
not really unless you wanna be in EveScout.
---
and takes another 3 days to grind it
---
no
---
ur boring and ur projecting
---
I feel personally attacked... mods?
---
3-2-1 Kenshin!
---
Oh noes, we are getting evicted again !1!1  
---
For the 45th time.
---
Okay, that's what I thought. 
---
So the burn OP saved them two weeks of losses.
---
The Charlie Kelly picture from It's Always Sunny with the bulletin board and conspiracy strings also fits really well.
---
Bombers Bar is a newbro-accessible entity doing meaningful PvP things out of Thera. It's not a corp. It's an NPSI. You can google.
---
lmao you have to explain yourself
---
Learn how to craft a story.  I've enraptured non players with Eve stories.  Don't use jargon.  Make the story about the people and motivations.
---
Did they fit the actual patch with a cloak?
