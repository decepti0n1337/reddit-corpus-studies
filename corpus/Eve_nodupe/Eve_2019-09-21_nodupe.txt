Hello Friend,
---

---
We have an entire subreddit dedicated to this that is quite active.
---
reddit.com/r/evejobs
---
There's also the recruitment channel on the r/eve discord if you wish to view adverts (and the occasional spat of drama).
---
https://discord.gg/nrvcbSD
---
You can just click the post and sort by new. This solves your problem. You run the exact same risk of running into memes, troll posts etc. with threads as you do with comments.
---
&gt; If they wanted to make it so r/Eve isnt a place where the developers will find ideas anymore, they probably accomplished their goal.
---
It could also be argued that we condensed them into one place - thus making them easier to read.
---
The rate of manufacturing has undeniably risen. Whereas it used to be bottlenecked by POS numbers and their defensability, citadels enabled supercap production on a much larger scale. Not only are citadels much harder to disrupt than POSes were, they also centralize what used to be several constellations worth of production.
---
The 3 years in question didn't "somehow" outproduce the previous decade. They did through a feedback loop of easier material acquisition and exponential scaleability, that went largely unchecked for a concerning period of time. 
---
And if you are counting, the number didn't double. It quadrupled. And that's not even counting all the ones that weren't in that battle. A good part of the supers of both sides were not fully commited since the result was so obvious. Going from a few dozen titans between the biggest entities, to close to a thousand for the biggest just cannot be ignored.
---
active paladin no, because bastion, buffer resist stronk paladin, maybe, but nestor spider might not be enough
---
Same thing would have happened on char bazaar.  People would have seen high demand for types of chars people were injecting (titans/supers/rorqs) and people would have purchased them from Bazaar.  It was the unchecked resource acquisition that made it easy.
---
That is what I said :D
---
I'm a couple of weeks in and got stuck on this too in my Cormorant. Local was no help. I just did something else for a day or two and got myself a totally basic Moa and it stomped him.
---

If only your posts would stop showing up as well
---
This is his alt account.
---
Sure thing. Sorry for posting in the wrong place. You‚Äôre welcome to close thread or I can delete it.
---
This is exactly what I want to make. How did you mate the stand with the ship?
---
Yep.
---
This guy gets it.  I'd say skill injectors are even healthier than character bazaar because there is actually loss of SP whenever someone re-injects.  It did take the character creation market a lot longer to shift, but really it would only be a 12 month delay whenever a meta switches and other character types start selling.  Super/Titan pilots were always being sold on bazaar, and Rorq pilots followed about a year later when everyone and their dog started rorqing.

Its called drive by management. Hilmar gets back from his Costa Rican mansion, drunk with young boy ghey love.

Yep we fight and lose things.

When you sell your ship, does it keep killmarks? Wp btw, never achieved more than 10..

if they want to fight inbetween with no objective behind it they can just do it at the sun, absolutely no need to involve a ks

Not typically a huge rap fan, generational thing, but hey Eve raps - even I can get into that lol..

No.  White Knights have repeatedly said this for 5+ years.  CCP keep ignoring legitimate problems, pushing awkward, bad solutions, and lost all of their good devs.

I'm shocked we haven't seen an injector sale and sp event announcement announced yet, gotta pump up those short term DAU numbers before payday.

Do they even have a balance team anymore? The last time we heard from them was last January when they fucked with ancillary shield booster limits on caps, since then nothing.

But on a more srs note: Just ask... Yeeeeah, EVE-players tend to be trolly and edgy and stuff, but for every 2 edgelords you ll find one really helpfull player that explains you stuff. He ll totall yshoot you if he gets a chance, but he ll explain. Eventually after he shot you ;)
---
before keepstars, people with supers and titans had alt characters trained to do nothing but sit in the ship and keep it safelogged at a POS. Most but probably not all supers and titans would go right back to safe logging like nothing happened.
---
Yeah CCP didn't lose enough of their revenue stream these last two months, their next target should be people having alts so they can really feel the financial pain.
---
What‚Äôs going on with Intaki Prime? I see a number of references, but I‚Äôm only lore-curious and am not sure what the situation is.

FFS Just a lil button that would bring up a JPG with the window you re on with added brief infos about what each button on the window does would already help newbros, I guess.

If you Repackage the ship, it loses its marks. If you transfer the ship via Deliver To or a Contract, it keeps them.

tbh, I liked NS-ratting and made comparably good ISK with it( for ratting just in a single acc, not stressing it, having lots of talks at the side and stuff).

Ratting as it is now is a nice, meditative no-brainer, lock, shoot, lock, shoot, oh cycle repper once, lock, shoot, OhlookthereisDaninlocal "Hi Dan o/", cycle repper 3 cycles, lock, shoot...

But, yeah, at times I wished there d be more fun and demanding PvE out there. And, I dunno, but that Trigs just dont interest me for I dunno what reason vOv

Hm, thinking bout it: I think I just dislike the "Ooooooh, the ultra-evil, world-destroying, star-eating, kittens-with-waterhoses-hitting villains of the universe need their beating. Again."-Approach.

I d love some sort of "zerging PvE".

Same could be said for your post quality. Both sad, really.

You should maybe link your stream?
---
Making combat sites in nullsec harder and more profitable, make it so even super/titan can't rageroll them and can die against them if not done properly by let's say a fresh injected guy who don't know how to use supers or a cute chinese bot. But like WH, if done properly =&gt; big reward

Try it out a few times before you commit all your assets.  And learn how to scan Wormhole routes - not ideal or safe, but it does work.

this is the third low quality rebuttal from you in the last 24 hours, someone is obsessed
---
I say that it is possible to make it interesting to non-eve players - the mechanics of cloning, jumping and podding are somewhat unique and are a background for a story that is at least a bit unlike others.
---
This is the third low quality account from you in the past whatever
---
I stopped playing in 2018. And I was in NC, PL, and yes TEST. Not only do I understand null sec. I was there to be a part of many events in the history of it. So I have a first hand experience in Bloc warfare. I don't know why people Max ree over a comment. Its pretty funny watching the led respond . üòÑ
---
Not allowing a million accounts to run on a single computer simultaneously would tone things down too.
---
Clearly not the Night King.

I think you can just form a fleet alone. That being said, spamming everyone in local with fleet invites shoudn't be allowed.

Outstanding..üëç
---
Build one out of foam board and stick some motors on it, if someone make a flying lawn mower you can do a Strat.
---
There have always been Skinner boxes in games, or did you never play any old school MMOs? It's just more obvious these days because video games themselves are more main-steam.
---
I mean, hell, EVE itself encourages you to grind to get the next upgrade / skill / new shiny ship, which makes up the majority of the high-sec, care bear, mission running riffraff.
---
&gt;  The number of pilots that can fly supers is irrelevant to the equation.
---
Are you fucking retarded?  You can build as many supers as you want BUT IF THERES NO FUCKING PILOT FOR THEM IT DOESN'T MATTER.
---
Like its super shocking you're this fucking stupid.
---
There were a handfull of rorq pilots in the game when the rorq change hit, even if there were 100,000 for sale, there were only maybe 100 active pilots in game.  Injectors allowed there to be enough pilots to fill all the empty rorqs.
---
If you're this fucking stupid though, you should probably just stay out of public discussions
---
Got this for 2 out of 3 accounts. Think it may be tied to email, so if all your accounts are on one email it may only give you the option for one account. 2 of the 3 accounts are on one email address, so only one of them got the email.

Problem is cloning takes away most of the.. agency? .. tention?.. if the main character gets into a fire fight we know it dosent matter if they die.. removes all dramatic tention from the scene. I'm 100% sure making capsules and clones the focus of the plot it will fail. Maybe the hiests between capsulears? Idk I just know watching eve version of starwars will be boring..
---
ARE YOU READY FOR A MIRACLE
---
The sub doesn't smell like salty sweat, tears, and shame anymore. More memes pls.
---
That is a strange assessment, as right up until the drifter attacks put every single war in Eve on hold overnight, GSF was waging a war against NC., also, GSF is large enough that a lot of their content comes not from large scale wars, but from Sigs and SquadsTM deployments.
---
You haven't played in a year and yet you spend all day every day barking orders about how to fix the game and doing some of your "uber sick just a troll post ya snowflake" posting in this sub. Which is exactly what's wrong with this sub and the ree squads saturating it.
---
Hold on, we're twice as smart as the people of shelbyville

few questions about sov warfare:
---
When is the vulnerability window for a system calculated? I've heard aguments it's downtime, and also that it's the middle of the window.
---
When an Ihub is destroyed, do the mil and strat indexes return to 0?
---
If a system is the first system of an alliance, is it automatically set to be the capital, and thus should start with a 3.0x index and window?
---
Pepperidge Farm remembers!
---
They do
---
 But your comment is hilariously full of hyperbole.
---
Yes because I have enough experience to see what's wrong with said game.

I started in 2006. I kept on saying ‚ÄúI‚Äùm just going to wait until I have this special skill set and THEN I will finally be ready‚Äù. It‚Äôs 13 years later I have 11 accounts over 200 million sp (earned the hard way!) and I feel like I missed out on a lot in the early days because I didnt jump right in.
---
Don‚Äôt make the mistake I did. Take whichever account you want to do ‚Äú X‚Äù with and do it now, don‚Äôt wait, there are plenty of newbie corps that will get you pointed in the right direction and get you into fleets TODAY. Hell, if you really want to be badass forget the newbie corps and forge your future by yourself, buy some cheap frigs and go get the ‚ÄúEve shakes‚Äù. No feeling quite like it.
---
TL/DR: don‚Äôt wait until you have ‚Äúx‚Äù skill trained to 5. Find what you like and jump in!

Imagine expecting a game to work best by having most people quit before they get to the broken content.

That's exactly what I knew you would say. You're so basic that you don't extend beyond "you mad, snowflake, troll, triggered". You're the equivalent of YouTube videos that end with some dork getting slapped while screaming it's just a prank.
---
You could have a model printed by a service like shapeways, unfortunately no one can print, finish, and paint models for sale, as that would be illegal, or at least have CCP sue you.
---
i really enjoy just being able to log in and putter around in eve.  I've been playing in and off since beta and decided recently to dump all my ISK over to an alt and fly my main out to Solitude with only 100k and start building up there from scratch.  It's fun to build back up from nothing in a new location like that.
---
As a direct example.. There's a scene where a guy dressed up like a nazi-scientist is doing an 'infomercial' on the best way to kill bugs with an assault rifle, immediately followed up with a bunch of kids killing bugs whilst a mother cheers them on gleefully...  with happy music in the background.
---
This scene is presented as if it's just 'everyday normal TV'.
---
The purpose of that scene (because it has no relation to the main 'plot' of the movie),  is to show how militarised the civilian populace has become, everything is done for the purpose of furthering the 'war machine' and the people are indoctrinated from childhood to hate the bugs...
---

If you can't see any other examples of humour/irony/exaggeration in the way the film presents things like propaganda, the government, etc...   and you disagree with the directors own words on what the message of the film is.   I'm afraid i can't help you.
---
Also you might want to look up what a the difference is between a farce,  irony and satire are.. Because you seem confused.  A film can be both an action film AND have a satirical subtext throughout.   See: Robocop  (the original, same director, lots of satire.. an action movie that takes its characters and threats seriously but still has 'satirical humour' throughout)
---
Except compared to most games you have to see quite a lot of effort to buy etc. those ships, and frankly that effort - grinding ISK - isn't particularly fun in itself. Why would I feed enemies ships I can't afford to easily replace just to satisfy their outlook on how the game should be played - especially as they're probably hypocrites who shy away themselves if they're the underdog anyway?
---
Amen.

Umm well, I don't know your wife so that is hard.  Start with what made her interested in it, I mean something grabbed her enough so start with that.  I'm guessing it's something you said or something she saw through your play so go there.  I'd personally be hesitant to get someone into a corp unless I knew the corp well, there are a lot of interesting personalities that play Eve so for a new player I'd probably just fly around with them and do things.  You could even do it with an Alt you only play together to keep it on level (or a jump clone in a nice quiet region)

Wait, how hot does it get?

Up until skill injectors there was very little grind just for the sake of progress. You advanced whether or not you even logged in. You did the grind to find your other activities. Sure you might grind to buy your first Tengu, but that wasn't the main thing gating your progress.

So everyone who owns supers owns enough omega alts to safe log all those supers right now? No i don't think they do because they don't have to they can store them in keepstars. A significant upkeep in the costs to keeping supers completely safe is a good thing in my eyes as well not a bad thing. If you had to log on a super get the alt out of it and get into it instead of just double clicking it in your hanger then undocking you might think a little harder about using it.
---
Because jumping into those threads is a minefield. Most of the devs that post here have no control over those issues. CCP is going to want to weigh the impact and decide as a company to endorse an idea, not just let devs make promises off the cuff.
---
explanation : there are many agents that were removed from the game. eg [http://evemaps.dotlan.net/agent/Siliker\_Svagnegnot](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/agent/Siliker_Svagnegnot) or concord agents.
---
However they were not terminated. They are just inaccessible, and not published. So they are returned by the search result, but can't be shown as they are not published.
---
Somehow, their ghost are still haunting us. Maybe they \*were\* actually terminated ?

I tried suggesting this multiple times over the last couple months.

POSes are still the only beachhead structure (anchor &amp; online under 24 hours) in the game. We can't really get rid of them until that role is filled, unless CCP decides that beachheads don't need to be in the game.
---
Ya, I was going to look one up. I found a site that had the majority of the tracks but some of the tracks aren't terribly great quality.

wait are there bcs other than feroxes? I asked all my closes 300 friends and they all don't know any

proud space violence member btw
---
The original idea i had for this was even more extreme than what i presented here. Having caps jumping instead coming out of jump in the closest system to where they are as they travel between systems instead of in the target system.
---
just leave it either in asset safety or somewhere like amamake if you'd prefer
---
Making nullsec less safe than highsec is such a retarded idea LMAOOOOO what were CCP thinking must‚Äôve been drunk

If you think of your ships like bullets (which you should), then buying 10 ships now will let you get blown up in 10 ships before you have to go back to the market. You can only fly them one at a time though.

Even if we could form people, hole control for the most part was on point, so getting anyone in was pretty tough.

nice writeup m8 i told all the hk/lzhx ppl on ts not to be retards/be smug so if anyone is an idiot i apologise, we blobbed you guys pretty hard and theres nothing to be smug over, shooting a keepstar with no guns fit is pretty close to the definition of an afk bash.
---
the main reason we came for you was because you planned to evict blue fire who i have known since 2013, before i even joined hk. blue fire/oruze/all out will always be the boys and good friends of mine, even if most of them have quit the game. any other reason you have heard for us coming for you isn't true.
---
as for working with inner hell, i've been talking pretty openly about wanting to revive the whole 2015 quaserknocks coalition for about 9 months now and have finally gotten around to doing it. like you said, inner hell are absolute champions and are very good, very precise. the amount of work they do is great and it feels so nice to have a talented ally that is willing to put in that sort of work. for hk and lzhx this is getting back together with someone that we have a 6 year history with, who has done so much for us in the past.

Anomaly scarcity. Rats and asteroid belts respawn at a slower rate. It makes both economic sense (law of scarcity) and lore sense (rats die alot, they leave or take awhile to come back completely; Instead of all belts respawning after down time, maybe have only one respawn per down time, helps to cut back on the infinite scalability of rorqs in null)

---
Why don't companies just not make money!!
---
they have shown and said they would take the hit to fix the game , not looking for  ccp to go bankrupt , but every single issue outside ship balance and sov mechanics is because of alts. Supercap umbrellas , mass mining fleets , structure spam , cloaky camping , suicide ganking , skill injectors , csm voting . Its all alts
---
a hollow shell to fit parts inside? difficult, depends on geometry - overhangs need support structure, which requires internal access to remove.
---
Otherwise you don't really need to empty it - 20% infill (usual standard) is pretty light as-is. 
---
But to print other external parts to mount quadrotor engines? yeah that's possible. You might even be able to print the ship in two halves (clamshell style) and fit the battery inside, that makes a lot more sense.
---
Probably also cause nullsec wars are an absolute shitshow these days it's better to just turboblob the fuck out of the opponent for it to be over faster.
---
And as far as Im concerned, Blue-Fire deserves a big dicking
---
And alts were around when the game was growing to its peak and they were part of the reason it got so big and did so well. Blaming alts is not the solution.

Quaserknocks was a force to be reckoned with, I tangled with you last time as part of No Holes Barred. This certainly isn't good news for wormhole space if you plan on what you did last time though. But its your fun and don't let anyone tell you how to play the game.  
---
We will still be here.
---
I thought there was a vast shift towards actual palatable and interesting content. Thanks mods!
---
i made it...wait wheres the keepstar......oh nvm look corpses nom nom nom
---
Yeah how many corpses did you lose when the Keep exploded?
---
I assume its a midway into the drones
---
If your serious convo me on discord
---
We are but a few less never hurts
---
i need a good price tho dude none of that 75% jita shit.

Lol how cute, that's like spring here

Don't threaten us with a good time!

Great post, hope you guys had fun and good luck in the future!

I dunno, I once suggested something that made sense on the features and ideas forum (my idea was for command destroyers) and I was mocked relentlessly for it by forum shitters, then 8 months later they implemented the idea and released command destroyers and never gave me any credit REEEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Even when all of eve banded together against them they were still responsible for the blue donut ;)
---
Did I miss the part where the post said anything about two evenly matched fleets?
---
Nano is boring to fight against unless you brought nano. If they don't have overwhelming numbers, either you sit there tanking everything they have while they stay at noncommittal ranges or you bring in something with long range webs and they immediately disengage and run. And truthfully, nano v nano is a rich man's game...the guys with the shiny implants usually get to dictate the fight.
---
Because you cant win them and give your x.i.x pets new space how time amirite?
---
wtf kinda noob you think i am..was the first thing i safed up
---
Introduce the Memetic-Reconstruction Device (aka Triglavian Offensive EWAR type adapted for capsuleer\`s use) : A high power slot device that allows  to fool enemy sensors:  
---
1) **T1 version fools only visuals on grid -** in other words it makes you look like another ship which you can choose (for example scorpion can cosplay as hyperion) until actual fight begins.  Limitation: Only allied (or somewhat related) empires can be taken (for example amarr ships can\`t look like minmatar and minmatar can\`t look like amarr). Cheap way to lure enemy into thinking that he doesn\`t want to those 20 caracals... while in reality they are 20 kestrels and their disguise broken by hitting them for any damage number.  
---
2) **T2 version fools Dscan too**  (for example scorpion is seen as abaddon on Dscan and has abaddon model). Only virtue set owners can break its disguise (that will be like scorpion with red letters on dscan).  A hound can "cosplay" as pink cynabal... or pink cynabal can cosplay as typhoon... luring potential afk-carebears and some FCs into long guessing periods of what they are fighting against. Disguise is broken by shooting at the target...  
---
3) **Deadspace/Faction/T3 version**: only usable by *Black ops BS/T3 information command linked cruisers/Dreadnoughts* and its main goal is to cosplay as a bigger ship: Naglfar can look and identify itself as if it is Ragnarok for example (ofc it will break to normal Nag when few enemy volleys are going to land on him), can\`t be detected by anything else on Dscan but black ops/EWAR vessel pilot with virtue set implants. Acquired with LP and as random loot pinata from those named NPCs.  
---
4) **Abyssal modified version of Deadspace/Faction/T3 version:**  Works only on T2 triglavian vessels or black ops battleships that will be capable of "cosplaying" as other triglavian vessels (blackops can only cosplay as another blackops until first enemy hit lands on its shield while triglavian ships will keep illusion until \~40% mark of their hull bar that will diminish provided buffs/debuffs by the device) and has its own unique effect: random  environmental  debuff that is in abyssal deadspace is applied to targeted ship in the area in form of 1/10th of its T5 abyssal power.  For example: *Electrical Abyssal Generator* with effect of ***penalty*** to *EM resists* (target recieves -2% to -7% EM resistance) and applies ***bonus*** (1-5%) to capacitor recharge time to the ship it is installed on.  It will be acquired by "mutating" Deadspace/faction/T3 version with triglavian unstable mutaplasmids and its environmental effect and amount of debuff and buff (as well as other numbers like CPU/PWG/CAP usage) will be randomly determined there.   
---
Goal of these first three devices is easy - mind games! They don\`t provide any numbers whatsoever but fool visual/Dscan appearance to scare potential attackers/defenders or catch them by surprise. Abyssal version provides decent amount of debuffs/buffs but will be relatively expensive to acquire and suffer from stacking penalties more heavily than other mods (so for example enemy won\`t bring 10 ships with 5% debuff to EM resists and turn target\`s EM resistance to 0). Yes, your Moros will be able to cosplay as Erebus on grid/Dscan and it will look good and apply skin Erebus\`s skin too (if you own one). Cheers.

Been AFG for the last couple years, but I remember playing with Mindful back in the talocan days.

^this. Find a Corp, they‚Äôll go out of their way to make sure you can get in on whatever they do at your current skill levels.

CCP could make a lot of money selling 3D printed models.

Dreads have very limited uses as is. Whats the use-case for a dread thats twice as expensive and takes 5mins to hit full deeps gonna be?
---
Daaamn you a salty bitch, everyone was right about this subreddit, more toxicity than motherfucking league.

Despite bowing to the second worst authoritarian dictatorship on Earth, Google somehow still doesn't have good translation support for their language.

Don't take too long.  We've been waiting for 3 months for you to gather the necessary intel to evict all three of us...well, maybe we can get five to login for our next eviction.  If you take too long we plan evict ourselves.

I modeled it in Fusion 360
---
This war is one of the only things keeping SovNull from being completely boring. Why would you bring it closer to an end? Even though structure-bashing is boring, it's less boring than peace.
---
In all honesty, I‚Äôd love to get an official response from CCP outlining their opinions on each suggestion and if they‚Äôre even workable or not.
---
How dare you, I would never spend money on this site.
---
I just evicted 100,000,000 little KC's just thinking about that deep dicking. Can this post count as me "logging in"?
---
What's the best way to send feedback to CCP?
---
What is this new bug that offlines ALL the modules in your ship? Is it caused by the new fitting assistance... how the fuck do I disable it?
---
Crabs are biological creatures.
---
By the way, you shouldn‚Äôt be giving advice to people if you fit a procurer up and it costs 126 mil
---
Zero surprises there :)
---
Because....?
---
One side of their office looks out on the Ocean, the other side looks out at a shipyard.
---
Its a really cool locale but i dont renember there being any billboards nearby
---
Fitting assistance doesn't affect modules.
---
It just gives you information.
---
"at this point" meaning what?
---
Yes, it's got good fights.
---
It‚Äôs really shitty that FRT would release an evac script For their super bots, before releasing one for their Myrm and Dominos bots, kinda seems unfair.

---
Did you just make a reddit account to say this?
---
what's ur new char name gonna be when you come back to eve?
---
I think the idea is that with it all together, there would be greater constant conflict and less control over it period. The reason the outer edges are held so tightly, is their distance from another group. There is fighting on borders and the occasional war that might push deep into territory, but the home systems and clusters are relatively safe until an alliance just dies from inactivity or inner struggle of some sort.
---
Instead of doing that, my idea would be to increase the connections between the outer areas and bring them closer together in that fashion. As well as tripling the avenues between them and going to/from LS/HS so as to cause more conflict during travel/ops. Maybe nerf the range of JFs, as they just hop over what used to be contested paths to LS and then HS, negating the reason for those pipes as choke points in the past.
---
you could print a set of hammerheads and attach them with thin pins.
---
What if I did?
---
Nice tips which i certainly appreciate, I never knew a lot of this ill definitely do that. will want to join some wars as well in the future but that trading routes i did not know. Much appreciated!
---
Structure trash removal. Nothing else justifies the spool up time.
---
damage caps
---
Its been a pretty long-term bluetral agreement between the two sides.  A few years now.  Its just unfortunate for the balance of null that Legacy+Imperium reached a tipping point on force.  It wasn't that way when we first started working together.

Our first nearly year in the south, goonswarm was a -10 entity to us.

But if that‚Äôs not the case, great.

Test would like this war to continue it is fun and challenging.

If this is true, here's hoping for any abandoned regions to turn out like Tribute/Vale. Megacoalitions should stay the fuck out if the space drops. You guys have enough.

Eh? What are those?

You've got any proof or are you just talking shit again?

yes it is flex

they are amazing btw

Good riddance.

God its beautiful

1-800-SWARMPOLICE and they will protect your space too

Finally some propaganda like in the good old days to break the enemies from the inside.

We need more of this
---
*laughs in phoenix*
---
no, cpp trying too hard to get those financial figures up.... just ignore them  this event folks
---
HTFU? Nobody uses this, what does this mean
---
Well, I suppose it's a good content war, and I think TEST would be overstretched if they tried to hold FRAT's space, even with daddy Goons I would guess it would be a nightmare.
---
I C what you did here :)

What steps are you taking, if any, to avoid Tranq becoming like Serenity?
---
&gt; This war is one of the only things keeping SovNull from being completely boring
---
This war is the reason why null is boring. Larger group bullying smaller one.
---
Please please please give me tips on how to print that. I've been struggling with the orientation and small details
---
WC/SP are already in flames thanks to a few smaller groups (and the incompetence of the residents), so this is probably a wise move - I reckon they should try and hold Insmother though.
---
too lazy to properly answer with explanation: 
---
\- no
---
Large group fighting smaller large group which can't possibly win. The dominance of four large groups more interested in krabbing than PVP is boring. Smaller groups like in Pure Blind and places like that are a lot more interesting. And smaller PVE SovNull groups are also more interesting (we call that ProviBloc).
---
This is the best suggestion ive seen on r/eve in a long time
---
That was a really great read, thanks for sharing!
---
Or, its just CCP Round again.

Too bad it's all going to legacy allies

You've been a country for the universal equivalent of a really pathetic fart. Get civilised you swine.

Oh man this is great, I bet you're the first person to ever make this joke
---
Yea that happened to me, but they offered on a account that has never been Omega, if I let a account go alpha before the offer is up will they let me get the 25% off my main?
---
I made it almost 9 months plexing two accounts from the star and meteor packs that went on sale for Xmas last year.
---
Life did some things to me and I got lazy in Eve and now I‚Äôm about to run out of isk and really don‚Äôt want to spend $30 to reactivate both accounts. I could sell a few farming ships and plex that way, but I don‚Äôt want to.
---
Yeap. Happened to me literally a week ago :)
---
If you can fly a Frig with an MWD and scram you can be useful to a combat fleet. You can burn and tackle down something for fleet to kill or even shutdown a boosher on top of your logi and save the day!
---
Going to fast for torps to hit, and if they do, raw speed mitigates explosion damage.
---
awesome!
---
you're the 2nd biggest entity in the game fighting the 3rd and 4th biggest entity with help from the biggest entity so no your expected to win.
---
it's like 50k vs 25k dudes.

Not killing structures fine.  I'm more on about the pilots camping the bubbles and no one killing the bubbles.

Predicted date of review of the CCP sale to PA contract.

The rumor is that if the company performed well, there would be bonuses involved. Said to be common thing in industry contracts.

A mark you get on your ship's hull when you land the killing blow with that ship. They're specific to each individual hull.

i got baited into this post by the title a.k.a best ship in game

nevertheless good shot

yes stratios  clamshell style to put all inside and quadrotor pylons... in 2-3 weeks buying 3d printer,i was thinking about printing huge archon in 3-4 separate sections  and 8 engine pylons,one section of archon could be clamshell so can put battery,electronics and maybe gopro mounting pylon aswell,oh wait printing few of these and  invite friends and make eve in real.
---
yes you can (i dont actually know but now it forces the open into a situation with mixed answers)
---
Missed the propaganda flair
---
well wormhole route im gonna use because safer than gatecampy gates but thinking where to settle for best profit...thinking molden heath but maybe should try something less obscure

no

Omg! How did you know!?
---
That is rather disappointing to hear. I remember sending out each of the in-game prizes as they were handled by myself however the CCP prizes were handled by CCP rather than myself. It is probably a bit late given the time that has passed however if any of these tournaments happen in the future make sure to let us know sooner and I can chase them up.
---
Sadly though the Poker tournament was not included this year due to the world tour however it may make a return in future years depending on the appetite for it.
---
Honestly, the lack of fights is generally a defenders choice once your space gets a reputation for not fighting the people that are looking for fights will tend to stay away, the people looking for just ganks will show up more there is a reason why the majority of non-bullshit fleet's in null still go to horde space.
---

Remove the isogen content of spodumain. Make dark ochre necessary.
---
Yeah those darn smaller groups of Goons and Tapi
---
Yeah I would think not. Alphas can only train anchoring to 1 which can't even place a small bubble...
---
Yeah that‚Äôs totally who I was referring to..
---
You have an Entosis link with you?
---
oh yeah real estate prices in detroid went down the shitter when the automobile industry left town. godspeed on rebuilding that shithole :D
---
Man that looks really awesome, you planning on making more?
---
Don't sweat is Sighs. It was a struggle to get people in. Shit, Inner Hell have got some serious grasp on hole control. They one pass a hole without critting, it's surgical precision. We managed to get some dudes in when HK and LZHKs took over and while the Keep was getting shot. Final timers are today at somepoint for the rest of the structures but I'm at work and cannot do much...
---
Was a great dude. And he loved wormhole space. He would've wanted to go out with a fight.
---
Yeah he was a long time wormholer. Love the playstyle massively...
---
i hear the aesop rock influence. neat.
---
1 dude soloed carriers in a BS some other nerd afk killed a nyx in his stratios.....things happen...
---
You want to say that from Serenity we got even bigger botters and RMTers than FRT?
---
You can place every Cit but the problem is the ships where you can put one in
---
muh he came up with an acronym i dont support...buhuuu. go back hide under your rock in space, mate.
---
reddit invented toxicity i think.

well u can get wardecced as alpha, so im pretty sure u can wardecc people too in return

Shit, operation fedo had leaked

black out is amazing and it will be a product of future eve structures.

u must have citadel to declare war,otherwise no
---
Yes you can. You can‚Äôt place a fortizar because you would need a bigger cargo than an alpha can achieve but you totally can put down an astrahus, a raitaru or an athanor
---
Sadly this subreddit is occupied by passionate, salty, and even vitriolic current and ex players. But that's probably because this game has the depth that few others have. 
---
I'm happy that you are enjoying the game. Next you should look into a corporation. I recommend Eve University. But there are others, and just because you join one corporation doesn't mean that you have to stay there.
---
Shoot me an evemail if you have questions or want to talk about your experiences.
---
What module do you use in-game to do that?
---
puts  c4 package on the door,so war can flow.
---
It's not just supers, rorqs are a massive issue.  Part of blackout was to deal with the huge amount of isk entering the game, Rorqs are part of that problem too.
---
Everything essentially boils down to the introduction of injectors.  They, in my opinion, need to be either removed or have a capped sp amount &amp; locked out from certain skills.
---
The root isn't and has never been alts.  If anything its skill injectors in their current form.  They should have been limited and aim at new players to get up a couple of rungs on the eve ladder, not let some climb to the very top.
---
I'm not sure what you are having trouble with exactly. How I did it is i sliced up the model in Meshmixer  and printed the parts vertically (engines down) separately.
---
We have more nukes than you. GG plebeian.
---
(I love how this statement is true for literally any country you could be from)
---
I would be up for it, not sure which ships though.
---
Okay metapod
---
Oofffff got me hard
---
I'm having so much fun in null. Had some kick ass small gang pvp last night. Even our first cap escalation of shitcyno it was a blast.
---
I started painting it the default white and red but there was a lot of paint bleed with the masking tape I was using.
---
Its sitting partially finished on my shelf.
---
What's your ign? I'll send you a credit.
---
Cheers dude. We were going to make a push for Hisec while you guys were preoccupied with Init. But RL circumstances led to that not happening...
---
Shit, we needed people in, no point fighting on the keep grid when we needed that hisec hole. I think a few of ours enjoyed that fight.
---
Imho you can play eve on the side with no problems. Of course you have to set your goals appropriate to that. Exploration is good for new players as it is good ingame, you learn something about the game mechanics in general on the side. Still, dont focus too much on a single activity as a new player. Also try some PvP. For new players with little time on your hand try some public fleets. They created some discord and website to give players a better overview over those (dont have a link at hand though).
---
Why go on an offensive war if you're going to start paying for stuff?
---
laffo
---
my dream is to have a small eve model one day, ideally of a classic eve model &lt;3
---
anchoring a citadel doesnt require any skill, not even anchoring lvl 1

You can fit an Astra in a T1 hauler, they're only 8000.

I'm not sure if the question is serious. I'll just treat it as a serious question for now.
---
I guess round tables at occasions like fanfest, eve vegas, etc would be the best way to give feedback. Besides that you can do bug reports and send support tickets (press F12 ingame). But this obviously only works for certain kind of feedback. Many people seem to consider CCPls posts here on reddit a great way for feedback (judging from their number). But I don't think so.

Planetary Production is due for another round of unfucking.

just fyi, printing a huge archon will be difficult, printing is a lot slower than you think. It's also pretty expensive - like 20-30 dollars per kilo of material.

Ty for the feedback. Is it actually possible to go for exploration as alpha clone? Wanna test my waters first, before I commit

It's quite likely there is a possibility of this being somewhat factual

Does this mean you'll consider challenging goonies finally now that literally nobody else in the game is a match for you nerds?

---
Great writeup man. Not a wormholer btw but that is exactly the way the game should be played and with a great attitude
---
If a citadel is unpowered for a while you should be able salvage them.
---
Also PvP and PvE fits should be more similar, this would give pve fit ships a reason to stay on the field as well as allowing players to learn pvp skills against AI

have stocked 30kg filament,perhaps will take few days but still i will be able to fly archon in real life...
---
 i saw flying heron couple days ago when was in london.this triggered me to buy good 3d printer and  lots of filament,my plan went into motion, bought 2.4ghz transmitter and reciever also 10 engines for quadrocopters and  two li-po battery packs 1200mah. im thinking  on small solar panels on top of hull so it could recharge when not in use.. i calculated the hull mass,gear mass and 10 engine setup will  take off.

I'm sure there will be, I'm just surprised they aren't hyping it already. I expected it to start this week end and run through the end of the month.
---
Perhaps they can't do two things at the same time. Disabling Blackout must have taken all their attention from making up new ways of forcing people to log into the game by any means possible...
---
Small group bots its way into titan equity and tries to bully larger one
---
Much like your FCing of B-R right?
---
There was an option to offline services on outposts and a player had to comeout and turn on the services . It would be really nice to add the same feature to citadels towards Tethering , Repair , clone services and superweapons like doomsday , PDS and bomb launcher. How to do it is up for debate . Entosis was a poor choice afaik.

Eve reddit is so sad these days the fuck are all these posts

Hard to understand you without punctuation.  Your point seems to be "why are they picking on the little guy instead of fighting each other" while ignoring the giant shiny loot pinata kill sitting there.  I could link you dozens of clips of gigantic brawls between the big groups in W space over the years, but I know you've got your mind made up that they're wrong and "risk averse" (I don't think that means what you think it means), so I won't bother.  You're still angry though.
---
okay you know what you're doing, don't forget to post pics here  when you're finished yeah? fly safe
---
that sounds great ÔΩ°‚óï‚Äø‚óïÔΩ°

Yeah

are you Iceland's community manager, too?

I'm furious dude :^)
---
Definitely not the fact that I've been playing since 2009 and seen HK/LZHX do the same thing for 7 years where they frequently blue each-other whenever there's the chance they might lose / have to take a risky fight over a big objective.
---
Nope, i'm just mad. haHAA

Honestly respect to Frat for holding out against massively overwhelming odds for this long (even with Pan Fam showing up at times). Pity the DRF needs to regain their botting and rmt space.

So that you have something to post about :)

I feel sorry for your wife.

Yip I got the same offer on the 4 unsubbed characters I have. As far as I am concerned it will take nothing short of Hilmar doing a live streamed lapdance at Fanfest to convince me to resub. 
---
Lets be honest the blackout in a limited fashion would of been ok to a point if they had thought about it , I mean even the lore they span essentially telling us the fuel pumps where empty was pathetic and they obviously put as much thought into the blackout as the excuse they used for it. Fact remains it effected 90% of everything else in the game . All the professions where shit on in favour this and that is what caused the exodus , poor planning , poor execution and piss poor manners for not having the balls to actually say hey guys we messed up hard . 
---
25% is tbh insulting they removed the content from many people who had already paid to play the game thus leaving them unable to play the game int hemanner they had paid for in the 1st place. CCP just took the cash and ran. Offering a customer they have lost 25% to resub when they already paid for a service they couldn't or wouldn't use for 1-2 mths just takes the piss. Id be more inclined to strip there SP and use the isk to run other chars for free , the last thing I intend doing is parting with more cash to a supplier who is at best dubious.

(Im part of a small corp that's not in an alliance and Its super easy to go find fights)
---
Are we the assholes? Yeah probably, we trolled them relentlessly for getting so mad about a low power raitaru. We probably made some bad taste jokes in the process.
---
We are hoping they still come to Evict us of course, we've been "preparing" for 3 months.

Yes. You can do that with an alpha clone. Use a heron you can find fits on https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Heron As an alpha your skills aren't as good though. Especially you cannot fit a cloak and can't use T2 hacking modules. Both make a difference. 
---
btw if you get a new character make sure to use the invite a friend thing. This gives your new character 1m unallocated SP for free. a very nice boost especially for alphas. If you already have an account you can invite yourself. CCP is ok with that. if not streamers usually put public links into their stream info.

The funny part is, no matter which country he's from, his country wouldn't need to do anything to wreck y'all. You're doing an absolutely mad job at it yourselves already.

&gt;bug report
---
 
---
1. Why the question would not be serious?
---
2. Bug report for feedback is at least counter-intuitive, bug report and feedback is not the same thing.
---
TIL Wingspan's wormhole finding service may be legitimate.
---
tosser
---
&gt;Why the question would not be serious?
---
Because some people might consider that CCP doesn't really considers feedback. Especially on /r/eve this is a common claim. Right now https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/d708de/ccp_and_sugestions/ is the top post on /r/eve.
---
&gt;Bug report for feedback is at least counter-intuitive, bug report and feedback is not the same thing.
---
Bug reports are of course feedback but a very specific form. You don't seem to be a native speaker (neither am I) check https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/feedback#Noun which says for feedback:
---
&gt;Critical assessment of a process or activity or of their results.
---
A bug report is exactly that but only is called so if the process/activity doesn't work as intended.
---
Hey that's Audaerne! What corp are you part of? SEADC lol?
---
when 1 side have full control to escalate on demand and refuse the other side the chance to escalate, then yes!
---
lmao
---
Does this fit work if my trig BC skill is only 4?
---
All these upset Americans crawling out of the woodwork... Just remember who your people elected as your leader. Fix that then we can talk.
---
&gt;As a direct example.. There's a scene where a guy dressed up like a nazi-scientist is doing an 'infomercial' on the best way to kill bugs with an assault rifle, immediately followed up with a bunch of kids killing bugs whilst a mother cheers them on gleefully...  with happy music in the background.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;This scene is presented as if it's just 'everyday normal TV'.
---
Except, it is not "everyday normal TV" but rather wartime TV, which is not exactly the same.
---
&gt;The purpose of that scene (because it has no relation to the main 'plot' of the movie),  is to show how militarised the civilian populace has become, everything is done for the purpose of furthering the 'war machine' and the people are indoctrinated from childhood to hate the bugs...
---
The civilian populace is clearly not militarized enough if they still have to run ads and only few students are willing to join the army - or even care about the citizenship.
---
&gt;\[  This is a direct example of 'satire' in the film..  On surface level it's there to 'world build', but it's also a criticism of their fascist society \]
---
I fail to see any criticism here.
---
&gt;If you can't see any other examples of humour/irony/exaggeration in the way the film presents things like propaganda, the government, etc...
---
Strawman attempt. I stated earlier that there are few such examples - just too few to consider it a satirical movie
---
&gt;   and you disagree with the directors own words on what the message of the film is.   I'm afraid i can't help you.
---
If that is the message that he tried to convey he clearly failed. 
---
&gt;Also you might want to look up what a the difference is between a farce,  irony and satire are.. Because you seem confused. 
---
Nah, I'm cool. I read "Gargantua and Pantagruel" when I was 5.  
---
&gt;A film can be both an action film AND have a satirical subtext throughout.   See: Robocop  (the original, same director, lots of satire.. an action movie that takes its characters and threats seriously but still has 'satirical humour' throughout)
---
sat¬∑ire /ÀàsaÀåtƒ´(…ô)r/ the use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues.

---
&gt;  They batphoned the universe, with The United Federation of Conifers, Unspoken Alliance, Wardec Mechanics, Pandemic Legion, Snuffed Out 
---
On the first fight we had earlier this week, you was the one who batphoned half of your numbers and we were fighting solo, we didn't complain about it on reddit then. But when we are the ones who batphone to even our numbers then WE are the baddies? That's pretty fucked up
---
\+ I know that  you are kinda angry but Snuffed started fighting with us since they landed on grid, so clearly we didn't call for them
---
(PL got there when fight was basically over and started shooting our guys as well :) )
---
Did you shoot it until it didn't have any hitpoints left?
---
Kudos on your attitude. The 'win first, fun second' folks who jump on the big side of an already bobbed fight is what makes eve boring.

Hope you guys are back doing crazy shit again soon.

All I know is I brought the wrong interceptor and was blapped out of the fight upon our entry into the WH.

Ah the classic ree null blocs post. This is fresh.
---
Are you a crying highsec bitch?
---
Serenity is his wet dream at this point.
---
enlighten us, what's actually happening?
---
Most of your popular upvoted suggestions are not worth the paper they‚Äôre not written on.
---
I only have one question, are you guys truly independent?
---
Haha. Brilliant
---
Well it's a good thing they're not written on paper then.
---
They aren‚Äôt.
---
you should try a bit better next time
---
How so?
---
The game allows you, unless affected by another player, station effect: to enter warp instantly, to jump instantly, to cloak instantly and other methods to escape a fight. 
---
There is no underlying mechanic that encourages or forces ships to stay on grid, it's just blob up and run away when the cyno is lit, the ships arrive on grid and so forth. 
---
If you want pvp, why not suggest reworks of mechanics to promote fights AND keep fights happening longer? Is it because so many low tier pvp players value their killboard above all else? That any loss on their side is 0 fun and should be avoided at all costs?
---
Gosh even I want to go blow up Blue Fire now.
---
&gt;Are you fucking retarded?  You can build as many supers as you want BUT IF THERES NO FUCKING PILOT FOR THEM IT DOESN'T MATTER.
---
What is stopping one character from using multiple titans? Skill injectors were introduced in 2016 yet there were plenty of titan pilots. Remember when CCP said titans would be rare because they could not be built in large quantities. They didn't say 'titans would be rare because there wouldn't be enough skilled pilots'. Skill injectors cut the time not the desire to fly rorquals and supers. 
---
&gt; Injectors allowed there to be enough pilots to fill all the empty rorqs. 
---
And there still wouldn't be enough pilots for Rorq's if Rorq's were not rebalanced. if there were no skill injectors are you saying people would not train for Rorq's and six moths down the line you wouldn't have the rorq alts with the same number as today?
---
PVP and dropping excavators are not the same. Go shoot something that can shoot back
---
Oh god all lowsec entities should go to their staging systems and form a lowseco coalition and go to war with highsec. This is unplayable ccp wtf.

lesson learned.
---
Nothing new, since TEST departed from CO2, they bend over for their pimp(mittani) or their "customers" AOM, and no i don't imply they are the new cheap whore of eve!

TEST reddit propaganda has seen better days - just sad.
---
Some killed a Keepstar without Weapobs with nearly 200 man ..
---
You must be in slyce
---
They weren't that bad. They make other problems with the game worse, but aren't a problem in and of themselves.
---
If rorqs didn't mine so much, so safely, with umbrellas over them, and fancy moon ores to eat up, while being easily multiboxed, etc., then they wouldn't have been injected into so hard.
---
If supers weren't able to enter anoms and be an end-all-be-all in such a wide range of fights, then they wouldn't have been injected into so hard.
---
If blobs werent totally dominant for every conflict, alts would be less meaningful and there wouldn't be as many getting injected.
---
Etc.
---
CCP built a game that had a lot of balance problems that shouldn't have been there in the first place, or that should have been fixed by now, and injectors just exacerbated those problems.
---
NC, PL, and co pulled out of the regions, they reside in the dronelands now, and most their former territories are inhabited with small alliances. This is Vale right now http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Vale_of_the_Silent
---
If only they had fueled that raitaru. Must not have been that important afterall.
---
Not that close. There are many good and some really bad ideas in that list. But it‚Äòs good that we have his ideas. CCP can work with it and I guess they will read it.

so what im taking from this is that you memed on some people mourning a lost friend, get shat on for 3 months by some randos, and then got bailed out by the WH CFC without actually doing jack shit. 
---
that¬¥s all fair game i guess. but why would you punch yourself in the face by actually telling everyone?
---
Lmao if only
---
That much I can tell, NC and PL have pulled out.  What I wonder is what are the politics like among the groups there.  allies with each other.  do they bat phone bigger entities, active pvp or industry, ect.
---
It‚Äôll be nice to see some scrappy small alliances populate everything around curse so curse becomes a healthy place again.

No point committing to eating eating shit if you change your mind halfway.

Did I make that argument? No? Then fuck off.

1. The Triglavian shipline is "new" (introduced last year) and features the disintegrators as a new weapon system with ramp-up damage.
---
2. PLEX for a month is around 2bil, you need 500 units for 30 days of Omega. But there was a decent inflation, too much ISK in the game etc et al
---
3. Yes?
---
4. Yes, you need to get Omega to use skills that are Omega-only. This affects ships as well as modules.
---
5. Plenty of people says it's dead. Not sure if I would choose the same words but it's definitely in a very sorry state and CCP yet didn't do anything about it EXCEPT banning plexing ventures. But you can get great fights in low and make some ISK on the side to finance your endeavours.
---
6. Sansha incursions are still the same but CCP reduced the number to one incursion in high, low and null each (I could be wrong about the exact number but the number of them in high was definitely reduced. If somebody from the incursion community knows more please let me know and I edit the correct info in) CCP added Triglavian incursions that work somewhat the same.
---
7. You need plex to buy a Multiple Training Certificate on market, with plex or real cash to enable training of multiple characters at the same time on the same account.
---
Welcome back to the game! :)
---
Yeah so totally unreasonable that a couple groups temp-blue to kill a keepstar in a wormhole.  Completely nuts.
---
Wow, even I'm not as big of a piece of shit as you guys
---
4. Lots of ships and modules are limited to Omega (paid or PLEXed) accounts. Alpha (free) accounts train at half speed, too.
---
Probably should at this point, the 3rd party sites would spend the money better than CCP
---
Because they are not Triglavian, but cheap copies by the empire factions. Check the lore. Everything is fine.

I mean, I'd trust them to find a HS near a trade hub. They're great at that.

So the leader of theran called me a friend... I told him he was invading the wrong space and he responded "fuck fe". I still said after that we would help them get into another pocket. Or if they really liked our pocket they could help out with the sov costs by paying rent.(the ihub costs etc.) But nope. So its friends off... and fight on. While I have heard they are actually renting from rote. So whatever. Believe which every side ya want but point being... they are the aggressors. And yes.. please.. look at every battle report cuz rote bat phones hard nearly everytime. We have FE and ECHO ONLY. Dvn showed up last night for the first time with decent numbers. And the odd friend from around the universe have access to join our fleets...Before it's been minimal. They brought in PL and outnumbered us by 50%. Not counting snuffed. Bless them. They can come third party anytime. I was there for a bit... it was fun.
---
They paid 400bn+ for Fade how much did they pay for Vale space?
---
Basically background information on the last 3 months and how it somehow ended up coming to this. We are comically incompetent.

&gt; it seems

&gt; its possible
---
Vily have you ever considered working for NYT?
---
Fantastic attitude. The game would be in a better place if more were like you dudes.  Fantastic achievement to build it, well done trying to defend it, and major props for taking it like a boss when it went down.  I know several people who want to join you guys because of this - I hope you come back stronger than ever!  o7o7o7
---
Thank you.
---
They might've ran off with the dudes paragraphs.
---
That battle report is fucked btw
---
A triglavian hull seems counterproductive when you have to kill a lot of small stuff.
---
So tapi complaining about bots are now sponsored by bots? Would have never thought vily would do such a thing!

&gt; hey, in my opinion, need to be either removed or have a capped sp amount &amp; locked out from certain skills.
---
That's not happening. Short term gains &gt; long term benefits we know this is how game companies operate.
---
Bahaha that was you... Awesome! We've all been there since that change...
---
They aren't renting from us. Also please stop saying mean things about me, it's not nice.
---
Never heard of anything like this happening are you sure you are not botting or something.
---
They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
---
What kind of freak would ban memes
---
Yep, that's pretty much it haha &lt;3 
---
Love living here too, it's amazing :D
---
if isk were acquired throught  RMT  then its legit for ccp to ban you and take your isk.
---
if you scammed someone in few cases ccp is dumb and return the scammed isk to owner.
---
if support tickets does not work  use  internal affairs,they will investigate your problems deeply.,but still........takes month or two.
---
if you  got isk legally by buying from ccp plexes and sold in game for isk and ccp nicked you but you used credit card to purchase plex from ccp,do chargeback.. you got notthing to lose if you are 100% sure u wont recover accounts,after chargeback you get your money but you will be blacklisted and ccp will never let you play again...
---
Have you tried not breaking the rules?
---
This was written by someone in rote. I think in our side we're all happy about the brawl. I know how to spell and write actually decent BRs lmao.

What's the point of having "content" if we can never win?

It‚Äôs the reddit propaganda war.
---
None of these things happened. 
---
I bought a character on character bazaar. A few months later it was taken away from me since apparently, that account was hacked. The problem is that I had 45 bil in assets on that character and CCP just took it away. 
---
I've submitted a support ticket within a few minutes of my account getting locked, saying that it must be a mistake (I obviously had no clue about the account hack that took place a few months earlier). It then took CCP over a month to resolve this. 
---
I have bought a LOT of characters on the bazaar, I know and follow the rules, never RMT'ed, scammed, botted or bought illicit ISK. 
---
If CCP wants to discuss this case in public, I am more than happy to.
---
What does it mean if the hostiles are spinning their own fort anchoring? We're all laughing at the idiot who posted this and enjoying the GF üòÇ

Nope, never did and never will.

Very easy way to tell that this post wasn't written by me. I can spell and format posts. ;)
---
Used to be more meme focused.  And cymek was fantastic.
---
We are, and we also don't write bad posts like this.
---
Agreed. I don't think I've ever seen anything this cringy.
---
Yeah, why should a guy in a pve ship be stupid and undock to fight some one in a ship custom built to kill him.. I mean come on.
---
I don't know if I could handle this much cringe again tbh. They could've at least learned to spell.
---
1. yes   triglavian ships from frigate to battleship we have praxis marshal molok vanquisher and many more
---
2. inflation causing plex prices to spike,people less buy for real mony,they farm in game currency and this drive plex prices up
---
3. skill injectors are same,there is now small and large injector and daily alpha injector 
---
4. well alpha clones can use all t1 ships from frigate to faction cruiser/battlecruiser/battleship. they can train some tech2  equipment..omega gives full privilleges to use other ships sush t2/t3 cruisers t2/t3 destroyers and t2 battleships and capital ships.
---
4. FW  changed a bit,no more venture  running complexes and nomore possible to enter fw complex with warp core stabilisers,there was cancer of punishers with 4-5 warp core stabilisers.
---
6. incursions same,dont see change
---
7. u can use multiple character training certificate. plex function.
---
\[deleted\]
---
Annnnddd ... it's gone ...
---
Nope. I was an indirect victim of an account hack (bought a character on character bazaar that apparently was sold by someone who hacked an account).
---
Having said that,  character bazzar scams used to be less common. In the last year I have experienced five scams where someone sold me a character and never delivered it. Two of these took place last month
---
Trig ships shoot the correct damage type, and has amazing tracking.
---
Talocan... there‚Äôs a word I haven‚Äôt seen in a while. Hope all is well irl man.

Please give us endlessly respawning anomalies and ore sites, it is definitely balanced.
---
except HE RHYMED RAIN CHECK..WITH RAIN CHECK
---
CCP  never discuss this public to prevent PR disaster.. contact internal affairs instead of playing cat and mouse
---
&gt;ole route im gonna use because safer than gatecampy gates but thinking where to settle for best profit...thinking molden heath but maybe should try something less obscure
---
Try ["Enka" constellation](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Devoid/Enka#sec) in Devoid Region.  I spent some time there setting up a little solo mining camp before I got bored and left.   Also, its not quiet, there are lots of people in there doing the same thing.
---
Our valued krabs
---
Their disgusting botters
---
Obviously not independent enough to write our own posts apparently. I think my eyes are bleeding.
---
Nor should we care. There is no guarantee CCP can catch the cheater and return your assets. It is a best effort task and it takes time to track down a cheater, given what you are saying is true.
---
I am sorry that happened, but it is your responsibility to protect your accounts and bot share them around.
---
Damn i need to change a corp if you can get full wallet access just for posting on reddit.
---
How do I contact internal affairs?
---
I've written 12 messages to the support team in the last month. None of them were answered. 
---
I've joined the in-game help channel and spoke to a GM. He said that it's an account security matter and he can't help, but will raise it with team security.
---
BRUH

thats where i am heading later,decided to travel to bleak lands.
---
No everyone is literally laughing at you.
---
TLDR. Nobody really cares.
---
Vily and principles. Give me a break.
---
I is breaking his promises faster than light.
---
So the largest botting group came to our server and TAPI just accepted them to fight the other botting group. Well fucking done.
---
Well, here's the twist.
---
It was CCP that took my assets. It wasn't my account that got hacked.
---
I got full wallet access just for not going crazy like past ops directors, so I mean....
---
Will do, I could have done a better job following up myself as well tbh.  Immediately after that FanFest I kinda just started winning Eve, so it wasn't a huge deal.  I still lurk /r/eve and keep in touch with corpies though.
---
Goons are many (negative) things, but botters is not one of them.
---
internal affair is somewhere on ccp main webpage  thinking its contact  menu if they have one
---
/r/whoosh
---
Thank you. I will look it up.
---
Goons are a very positive organization. They provide hunting content for many, and infrastructure for their members.
---
If you had any kind of interaction/transaction with a malicious character in-game they would ban you, even if it was 10 ISK.
---
 Very Dino brain logic, lets use bot to against bot (anyone who we fight must be bot)!
---
u got me. Post quality was authentically shit enough to ruse me :(

Yikes, are you even aware of how much was killed in 1DQ with that trick? There are idiots or missclickers everywhere.
---
Brah
---
You no longer get 1 free tritanium when you get a new rookie ship. So there goes my plan to farm free ships for enough tritanium to build a titan.
---
I don't pay much attention to the economy or to capitals - is that high or low? And how is either caused by injectors?
---
But they do rent to botters
---
I am very aware... The idiots aren't only on the east of new eden...
---
Not sure if you thought this sort of hyperbolic shaming would get you somewhere, or if you thought this was unique. But it won‚Äôt and it isn‚Äôt, and trying this isn‚Äôt likely to get you anywhere. 
---
Good luck sorting your shit out, but this type of behavior won‚Äôt likely get you any brownie points from this sub.
---
It's not. Reddit is just autistic. Some people want it dead so they tell everyone it already is.

 Really independent? This ping mentions you are allies of those ex BOT guys Reckless Contingency who have 1600 members . . . . .

 well guys we had a nice little fight tonight from our Deployment from blades has some fun with allies and even got to shoot blues (PL)  [https://br.inyour.space/?s=232&amp;b=8794200&amp;e=210&amp;t=rsfucaaq](https://br.inyour.space/?s=232&amp;b=8794200&amp;e=210&amp;t=rsfucaaq)  TLDR   Theran Alliance was anchoring a Fortizar in MY-T2P. Our Allies FE. and their little coalition was forming up to kill it. i was reminded of the fight 30 min before the fleet formation. (sorry for short notice) our guys Jump cloned down and picked up some ships. we bridged into MY-T2P at 20 km on the fort. Rote and Co (Rote Kapelle, Theran and thier allies) dropped into local 200 away from us as well as a haw phoenix. the phoenix warped to our fleet along with their lokis and the fight was on.   we were fragging lokis and support ships and really raping Rote Co. and then PL comes in on Rote Co. side and began shooting. (me and the PL Fc agreed we still love each other but we weere going to shoot each other) also Snuffed made a 3rd party appearance which ended up forcing us off the grid. we reformed with Reinforcements and went back in to take the fight with PL and Rote Co. but PL had to much for us to break and we ceded the field allowing the fortizar to online.   GFs were given and all had fun. should you wish to join this sig and participate Apply to the blades group in Services. we need more people to help our bros out. (they batphone everyone just like unspoken used to do to us)

&gt; What is stopping one character from using multiple titans? Skill injectors were introduced in 2016 yet there were plenty of titan pilots.
---
Honestly are you dumb?  One character in one titan is still only one titan, even if that guy owns 9 titans he can only fly one at once, considering it takes over 2 years to train into a Titan, pilots for them would remain rare.
---
&gt;If there were no skill injectors are you saying people would not train for Rorq's and six months down the line you wouldn't have the rorq alts with the same number as today?
---
Again, it takes longer than 6 months to train into a rorq, this is how badly skill injectors broke peoples brains.  you've no concept of how long skills take to train anymore.  You'd be a year out from one at the minimum and then you'd have trash ass skills.  
---
These ships were very skill intensive, and thats why nobody trained into one.  Injectors changed all that, and yes, even if they mined a fucking ton, if theres no way to accelerate several of the 1+month skills you need to train you're going to be there for a while waiting.
---
This doesn't even bring up the reduction in turbo crabbing from added supers that cushioned the cost of buying the skills and the ships and the fits.
---
Honestly bud, you're really really really wrong here and its astonishing that you manage to move about on a daily basis without getting killed irl you're so damn dumb.
---
This is what I came for. One of my favourite ships. Looks great and thanks for the link!
---
Simply not true, but apparently you do.
---
Sorry, but that can't work like this.
---
Go to  [https://forums.eveonline.com/c/marketplace/character-bazaar](https://forums.eveonline.com/c/marketplace/character-bazaar) and tell me which sales are malicious (scammers that won't  send you the character after you pay for it) and hacked (you will get the character, but you might find out a few months after that that account was hacked).
---
There might be warning signs, but you will never know for sure. That's why there are rules both for the game and the character bazaar. 
---
Example: rule D.4
---
*The ISK that a buyer sends when attempting to purchase a character is considered to belong to him until such a time as the character being purchased has been delivered to the account of his choosing. If the character sale is not completed, the ISK must be returned in full to the potential buyer.* 
---
I have bought two characters a month ago and they were never sent to me. I got my ISK back, but I've also got a feeling that these scams would not happen, if CCP acted faster and banned these scammers immediately.
---
Did you try vapor forming it first?
---
I have yet to see good translations from any software tbh. I'm not actively looking for one, so I could just be oblivious about it. 
---
But I would think that the global players had one, too if it was a possibility.
---
Get an engineering degree and the 3D printers just seem to spontaneously appear.
---
If you go there, I sell you what I have left :). Pm me
---
What other options do I have? Trying to contact eve support was a constant struggle. Even after one problem was partially resolved, another one came up immediately after.
---
I will likely quit this game anyway, sell all my characters on character bazaar and donate my ISK to my corp or something.
---
Amok is recruiting.
---
depends what you got.
---
why did you post this on your alts reddit account
---
why does your alt have a reddit account
---
on another note, i remember talking to you a lot around 8-10 years ago in eve, good to see you're still around

Thank you, completely forgot about all the alts with these

Cheap copies.... That still require triglavian materials as an input for the build job. Anything you put it should have a chance to drop.

" We also allowed most of our members to speak up if they wanted to give the DD a go "  
---
Today is a *good* day to die!
---
"it's not about good fights or winning, its about how frequently you *dont lose*" - Most of EVE, last 15 years.
---
&gt; There was a problem of new player retention. Alpha/omega clones were a good step to fix this. Skill injectors, in their current form, were not.
---
Anecdotal experience admittedly, but skill injectors are directly responsible for three of my friends sticking around. Being able to get into the ships they really wanted to fly quickly was one of the major reasons they stuck with it.
---
If they had been forced to wait months, they would almost absolutely have just stopped playing.
---
You mean the one who broke our game?
---
I'll say once again that I have no problem with the idea of skill injectors - just their current, extremely exploitable implementation.
---
People crave Lord's posts so much that when he doesn't post they make their own lol
---
How long until you lose it to some campers?
---
The comic is wonderful.
---
I would like to fight on the side of Winter Coalition. I am a new combat pilot.
---
So they can launch the Nestor and use it to refit their ship.  (It's like a mobile depot without the anchoring delay)
---
For refitting. You can eject it and instantly refit if you don‚Äôt have a combat timer.
---
Except that cyno jammers actually deny BOTH sides the option to escalate. Because the moment you drop the jammer both sides can drop. And this has indeed happened at times.

good content
---
also the reason its not fit is because without a pilot most of the fit modules would have no effect on the ship.
---
Poor goon all sweaty due to running from the majestic aircraft :(

You actually don't need to move the account at all. I can't remember how to do it exactly but you don't need to bend over backwards. You might find out more if you click on the little cog next to your "account" on the Eve launcher.
---

---
An emergency refitting tool. Pretty genius honestly.
---
Quite clearly someone from TEST, look at the fedora. Clearly a Redditor.
---
Yeah, that totally would have worked against 1000 INIT and 1000 goons. Good idea.
---
More like goon Titan coming to the aid of his spod brain brethren in terrible danger.
---
Because consistent coding is hard. Much easier to add an item to an existing loot table than to make an additional loot table.
---
Ca encouraged people to stay docked.  Even if it was perfect it needed to go.

Didnt really steal, but gave to Goons because they diddled his ego more than GigX did. While on CSM lmao

Begone troll, we honestly don't care how much you nut ride your own nation. Nationalism is a pathetic pursuit of small minded humans.
---
its rorqual trying to enter wormhole
---
Steam: you can buy unique DLC on the steam store such as Omega in 7-day increments, steam sales, etc
---
Eve launcher: ?? You can uninstall Steam if you want?
---
&gt;Your FCs intend on making the game unfun and unplayable for you.
---
This is the reason everyone should leave null alliances. Their strategic incentives involve making the game actively worse for *their own players*, and they prioritize "winning" (by their own head-in-the-clouds realpolitik definition) over creating an enjoyable game experience for their line members. 
---
Any alliance whose #1 purpose is not to enable its players to have fun is an alliance not worth supporting.
---
oh ok. ill just sell them to Noraus or something, idc
---
DO NOT CLICK CATPOO'S LINKS, NSFL

thx enjoy being inferior
---
3/10. Didn't even bother changing 51 to Delve. Shameless repost karma grab
---
I don't think 3 months of intel is enough to evict us. I think you probably need a good 6-8 months of watching us not log in to even begin to understand what you are dealing with.
---
Best of luck though. I hope your alliance doesn't fall apart if you fail to recruit enough competent people to help you get the job done.
---
This, reported both of those. Holy shit I didnt need to see either.
---
You can look into your steam account from the regular launcher. The account will look something like "steam::12367894"
---
He can't: they fact check.
---
If you‚Äôre bored, you‚Äôll go away and not come back. This makes the space safer and thus more useful.
---
No more kills!
---
Try not to be too jealous. It is a rough life figuring if we are actual wormholers or not, as your flair will suggest.
---
But you got me to reply, so take my upvote.
---
What?
---
Just use a Vindicator. This is slow af.
---
FWIW, I'll go on record as being the one N0MEX guy that doesn't really share Seraph's sentiments regarding this eviction. I'm not in in high spirits, and I am not going to cary on in game. Yeah, I know, it's not an airport I don't need to announce my departure, blah blah blah, but seriously, this isn't all fun for everyone involved. Wormhole space in general has been suffering for a while now, so there is no real reason to move back into one, and the rest of Eve, has always sucked, so, that's that. Think about it, back in the day there was a channel to help people locate the few vacant wormholes that existed... Yeah I can barely remember those days either.   
---
It's just a couple of almost 10 year old pilots leaving, and it WAS fun, mostly. I hope CCP can find a way to correct some of the absolutely retarded citadel mechanics, or something, I don't know, who cares. Fly safe y'all.
---
Because you didn't use a triglavian salvage module.
---
WTF?! Does it have Republic Fleet shield extenders? O.o
---
I wonder if we'll even get to use it, at least at first? CCP put the Angel capital ships on the back-burner because of capital proliferation, IIRC, so maybe this is going to be a ship that we won't get to fly until they fix that.
---
The Angel Cartel has ships (Ixion, Medusa, Swordspine, Fury, Lynx) that were part of the game since the very beginning, but we've never gotten to use them.
---
Man I triggered people with my comment that we are enjoying the war that they downvoted. Then Velonad comes at me whose accolades and accomplishments in EVE can be summed up by anchoring and pressing F1.  But I get it those that can't do are critics.
---
A few minor points:  
---
\*Ben Booley is the Sort Dragon of Rote Kapelle, Sven is just a nice old guy that organizes fun roams.   
---
\*Theran's several cynos and indy cynos brought Snuff to the fight, even I was comin to check it out cause those cynos were lit. 
---
\*Everyone knows PL is a small gang alliance and relatively irreverent.
---
GF though, always fun throwin down on friday
---
that's true it would've been much worse. lol
---
That's exactly what I was doing. (At least they didn't pod me...)
---
Bro sorry, not everyone is laughing at lords here.  If you look back through his posts, and think this is another one of his, you're the moron.
---
The test blue doughnut extends another region North.
---
*yawn*
---
because buy plex, that's why.
---
you're actually wrong.  Without PL the numbers were even, I can show you the BR.  Snuffed came in as a true third party and were even confused about why PL was there.  We have confirmation that PL used the MSHD ROTE titan to bridge, to double Rote/Theran numbers.  I mean we slaughtered Rote before PL came in, then everything went to hell lol.  But yes I believe it was still a good fight up until PL came in.
---
That video is A few days old, hasn‚Äôt stuff been nerfed and meta  changed since then?  :)

Balance and meta means nothing when you give elite pvp new shiny toys.

---
I think this was a good quality sh\*tpost (I'd love to know the author as this is StainGuy level) and the fact that no one can tell the difference between what you write in this (I'm surprised even you can) should tell you a lot.
---
Idk seddow with nightmares is a fucking baller time too
---
BRO, we had like 2-3 people come that are friends from separate alliances.  We have people who have flown SPECIFICALLY with those characters for years upon years, so yes you may call it a "batphone" and that we "batphoned" test, NC, and horde, but I doubt that 2 characters from each alliance are considered a batphone.  But, if it makes you sleep better at night, then be my guest.

WH eviction was by far the most boring fucking thing I ever did in EVE and that was back with only POS timers.  Kudos to people who can actually stay awake and be organized.
---
The year is 5011 and turrets can't aim perfectly?
---
And that we've seen both sides pre-stage caps under jammers?
---
Pls tapi is just gonna blue whoever moves in
---
There's a lot of stuff from that list I disagreed with, but I'd say that the game would still be massively improved if they implemented all of it. So many comments who criticized the list also mentioned that they'd rather have all of the changes than none of the changes.
---
That, alone, is really hard to do. Capsuleers rarely agree on anything.
---
I'm still kind of sad they never rolled out actual walking around the stations and meeting other people. Mainly because my alliance had a plan of slapping together a horde of improbably-breasted Gallente women to have a party in Jita on the first day of it.
---
Or, and hear me out on this one, you could leave highsec to participate in this content?

Hi there

Mechanics to promote fights? Already have those.. its called "reset standings"
---
No reps?
---
I really hope the default overview is on your list. Somewhere WAY up your list.
---
Where do i order one? :D
---
Its ok to bot under tapis wings. Just like it was for years. Only "enemy" botters are bad
---
The only promise vily broke is the Tranquility Trading Tower
---
Haha yeah, I was confused at first and then it hit me. Well lesson learned.
---
LMAO buddy that edge is mythical, you better be careful with it before you slay these comments like you must be slaying poon.
---
I must not slay poon like you do. Like the saying goes, you are what you eat. You blue waffle pussy!
---
so its serenity botters vs tranquility botters?
---
The 3 small bumps in the "neck" area would most likely not survive that process.
---
So good news is, your account is already a proper CCP account. If you download the official Eve Launcher you will have an option to log in and tie your steam account to it so you don't have to log into steam anymore to play. I have had to do the same thing.

"Loot tables? That's legacy code" - CCP, probably
---
Almost all of the answers you‚Äôll find are going to involve a ‚Äúthat depends on...‚Äù reply. 
---
If you‚Äôre planning on large fleets that support a missile ship doctrine, you‚Äôre fine just keeping what you have and pressing forward. 
---
If you want to stay semi-autonomous and grind out some ISK, incursions tend to prefer other weapon platforms and battleships.
---
Missiles have a place, like everything else, the key is to find something you enjoy and setting up your training to get better with that. 
---
That being said, extracting and re-injecting isn‚Äôt cheap, so for me I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it as a way to start.
---
Everybody knows TEST is BEST
---
Drop the MWD and cap battery. Add a 10mn AB and missile guidance computer. Get a mid grade asklepian set. Keep an exile booster in cargo for just in case. You perma-run the AB.
---
Wallymart strikes again lmao
---
What a brainlet
---
Oh yeah, just undock and get sniped from 250 by a jillion Ravens. So fun.
---
Was gonna say.  Get the resists up, maybe sacrifice one BCU for a rep at the very least.  The benefits of additional weapon mods drop off dramatically in the 2-3 range.  Experiment with 2 BCUs and use the extra low slots to complete your tank, then you can focus on DPS again..
---
fuckin lol
---
i dont know kinda sounds like you bent over backwards for nothing
---
What is a  mid grade asklepian set and the exile booster? i can not found it in the simulation.
---
because programming is hard for ccp
---
You can't really say that more than a couple dozen people at best "agree" with what you're saying right? Seems like a weird pool of data to be acting like everyone is in agreement
---
Circlejerk bait.
---
Jesus it's like being in Call of Duty lobby in high school all over again. You kiss my mother with that potty mouth!?
---
No, his lows are fine. It's his midslots that are wrong. He's probably not able to Premarin the MWD so he's getting blasted when he turns it off. Probably when he first turns it on and his dog blooms too.
---
Ugh, german windows ... :)
---
Imagine not having unique beat awards or top mod on a default rpopular sub smh, kids
---
And as if your word means anything anymore.... lol
---
Idk if you aimed this at russia or the us, but either way, I felt that... hard.
---
Because they added those ships before they introduced the salvage in Invasion, and forgot. Good suggestion (but are we still allowed to post suggestion threads?).
---
I can‚Äôt relate to another game where we have YOU people. Call of duty seems to be your thing. Do eve a favor and biomass. Go back to a brainless games like call of duty. It‚Äôs obvious that this game was never for you.
---
This kind of story is why I still read r/eve. Great writeup!
---
it won't, it will turn into anothe qfc at best, and probably not even that
---
Your father should have also pulled out... :-(
---
They're boosters
---
If you set an account name on ccp‚Äôs website you can still get the steam dlc while being able to take advantage of all the non-steam offers too. You can get double of every dlc pack.
---
You only look 10% as cool though :)
---
im not sure if this is a positive or negative comment
---
U wot m8
---
&gt;i need 2 missile guidance?
---
Is he kite tanking?
---
Fuckin love your vibes bro specially the trap ones
---
Thanks man
---
Mid grade asklepians are an implant set that boost armor rep amount. You don‚Äôt put them on your ship, they go in your head/pod.
---
You mean fights or do you mean ganks? If you wanted a fight, why do you warp away the instant it looks like you are outmatched?
---
I've been letting a few more through than normal given that we've got fewer idea threads so that it's not super bare. We'll see how it goes!
---
He has a repairer already
---
Good god my eyes
---
Stop defending CCPs lazy bullshit with quasi-reasoning.
---
You're on the PL downvote brigade train. Welcome to the club. And congrats, Manny. You've arrived.
---
Sure they can, but the targets can use sufficiently advanced magic to mess with the turrets.
---
Is it cap stable? My ‚Äúgoto‚Äù fit is usually a double repairer setup, with the rest a mix of resists and BCUs to taste... and I have everything else setup so that I can be cap stable while constantly running one of the repairers and an afterburner.  Then when shit gets real I can ‚Äúpulse‚Äù the second repairer a bit.  I sometimes fit a nos so I can fat orbit a battleship rat sucking a bit of cap so I can run both repairers for a while. 
---
To pull this off you‚Äôll likely need to sacrifice some rigs for capacitor regen. 
---
Warning: I‚Äôve never tried a 10/10 specifically, but I‚Äôve used this approach with some tough PVE, like hub sites in Lowsec, level 4 missions, Some WH siltes that I do solo, emerging conduits.
---
Get rid of skill training attributes and I'll resub my accounts that day.
---
(Actually, just waiting for a sale, but whatever... #AttributesMustGo)
---
why would you stay when you¬¥re outmatched? there is a reason why people who actually want fights lowball deliberately and try to look engagable. if you want kills noone keeps you from baiting people into staying on grid by bringing the right tool for the job. if you don¬¥t care then why bother when they run?
---
But it could lead to a 2/10 troll escalation, hang in there!!
---
This made me laugh out loud. I am pleased :)
---
He doesn‚Äôt have a wife, this I assure you.
---
Yeah and now instead of people staying docked and having a cool feature available to see their capsuleer interact with things, they stay docked and just stare at their ship. It really makes perfect sense.
---
Either you can't read or you are retarded :thinking:
---
I also find that fit wich tanks with shields but for me is over cpu and power, any way to fix that?

But the year is 5011, the turrets aren't sufficiently advanced?

I don't like the implication that Wrath wasn't peak WoW

It's literally built with Triglavian materials, though.

He should be. The DED medium armor rep with em and thermal hardeners should tank a 10/10 no problem. That 4th BCS does give extra DPS that is needed to keep the site time down. I use three faction BCS and a T2, because the difference in DPS on the 4th isn't worth another faction one.

Evidently not, and are there actually 5011 new eden years? or now+3k ?
---
well on the upside less time with wife means less breeding. im ok with this.
---
The weapons system is overpowered and stupid
---
lol CCP twisting reddit mods arms to keep bad press out of /r/eve.
---
GET REAL. Like we can't just keep spamming the fuck out of accounts and pictures...
---
Its still very early, give it time.  Human nature will win and nothing will have changed.

Never not fuck your interns

Right after tiercide

Don't worry, it's about to be filled with bots.  Funny how in 2 months of blackout killing FRT bots their morale and SRP went down the tank.
---
I guess your moms pussy was that good :)
---
Which is exactly why they are asleep.

Spent all night/morning docked in station because they couldn't get out and multi-box mine. So they spent all evening jacking it to weaboo trash managa or some shit and are now sleeping.

no matter how many ships you use to run them, they will all get the 4.5 million isk when its done. Only the lp gets split. So I use a max tracking dominix with ogres, a zarm for reps and more drones, and a noctis for salvage and even more drones, runs them in about 10 minutes or so.
---
 I just have a buncha dreads, idc who gets em

They should actually pay the owners not to have to blow up the structures.

I mean, technically they're both Serenity botters.  FRT was just the Serenity botters that lost the first time.

I'd swap to ab, you're blooming the fuck out of your sig. The speed tank lose is made up for the much much smaller sig. Worked for my 6/10 Loki at least and tanked a lot. These days I just ran in a leshak

When the pendulum has swung so far one way a compromise isn‚Äôt necessarily what‚Äôs needed
---
They already did that. 
---
Their official response was to silently strong arm the mods into deleting any meme generated against CCP, the development and course of the game and of course any slander what so ever against the great and holy hilmar. 
---
Just goes to show how out of touch they really are.
---
Hell this very meme has been deleted several times. But this is reddit. Just use a script to spin up a new account and post the picture automatically every hour. 
---
But hey... I wouldn't expect CCP to know a damned thing about smooth scripting.
---
A scared and out of touch gaming company watching subs plummet after the summer of scrubs push.

as i feel sorry for you for beeing lazy

Do you have proof for this accusation?

Oasa is too close to CODE sov.

Make the fitting and market search like pyfa, typing enam in pyfa gives you enams, typing it in game nothing. Similarity if you type ancil current in pyfa you get ancil current routers, ingame again nothing.

Kindof sad that pyfa devs are more competent at QoL stuff than CCP

Way too high effort to be me

fuck off you weeb

::Sad Mod Noises:: -- oooook

Even with an afterburner instead of the microwarpdrive? Change one or two of your rigs to capacitor rigs. Maybe add a capacitor implant. Once you have all of your capacitor skills trained to 5, you can switch them back to rigs that help with DPS and application.
---
If he's talking about titans and he hasn't started playing yet I was just assuming skill injectors out the ass lol

Human nature *always* wins, the point is for a period of time it's the kind of beautiful chaos Eve needs to not be a shit game.

I have eyes? Do you? For the last week we have been watching mods delete these threads left right and center. Banning accounts that post / re-post deleted memes.

I mean. Do you have any proof the sky is blue? Water is wet and you have some on the brain?
---
What possible reason could Reddit mods have to censor their community? You think they just woke up one morning, took the wooden dildos out of their asses and said "I'm going to defend the great and holy mount that is CCP -- They can do no wrong and all others will pay for saying ANYTHING against the greatest of all: -- [The greatest of maids.

If the attacker doesn‚Äôt have theirs in range and depending on cyno status now it‚Äôs still pretty much a one sided fight. The defenders can use beacons.  We‚Äôd have to get recons in and keep them up.

5 mins now is lightning quick when your cyno light only has 100k ehp.

Then let me add that yes trig ships should drop trig salvage.  Feel better?

r/eve is cancerous and toxic. CCP doesn't listen to people on their forums why would they listen to this sub?

Then all you had to say was:

"No, I don't have eyes"
---
At least now we're on the same page. You are perfect for the EvE of tomorrow. Day I say their prime demographic.

Awwww now I‚Äôm sad too. ‚òπÔ∏è
---
That‚Äôs debatable
---
Same...multi-Rorp miner/Indy here - slowly stopped logging into Corp Discord...checking in game mail...ditto have removed all bookmarks from bar...even a 75% discount on any amount of monthly subs wouldn't get me back...having a blast in classic WoW.
---
It‚Äôs not the anchoring skill it‚Äôs the Indy skill for a hauler to drop one.  Astra is med like raitaru and athanor I believe so you can use a trusty expanded itty5 or a similarly expanded tayra.  
---
Watch the gankers!   Sometimes you can buy one that‚Äôs already anchored in or close to where you wanna be.
---
You say that, but that's not how salvage works. We use minerals and moon goo to build all the other ships; yet salvaging any other player shipwreck returns neither minerals nor moongoo. Nor BPCs for that matter.
---
I know  :)

---
A charge to the rear
---
This is only true up to 3, after that it is split.
---
you're definitely in the wrong place.
---
1. Remove space aids.
---
2. Remove / replace Fozzie Sov.
---
3. Increase Jump Range for capitals to 20 LY.
---
4. Remove all old mission content replace with a modern system.
---
5. Make empire space 100% safe but scale down the entire size of empire space by 50%. Systems will be converted to Null Sec.
---
6. Remove Low sec turn all Low in Null sec.
---
7. Set all Null Sec to negative -1 true sec, the current system is overly complex for no additional game play.
---
8. Set all WH's to a maximum 30 day life span where they move to a new random location and force people to move relocate.
---
9. Remove Asset safety. 
---
10. Limit how many Citadels can be place per system based on either number of Moons so it returns to the same limit as the POS system.
---
11. Remove POS from the game.
---
12. Limit the amount of skill points given by injectors to 5 mil total.
---
13. Every region Null sec region has NPC stations to be used as a staging ground, mission running.
---
14. Increase the mineral cost of capital ships components, number parts required and production time.
---
15. Increase the mineral cost of Citadels and all items, production time.
---
16. Remove placement and all current Citadels from Empire space.
---
Yes, we have reverse-engineered their systems to use them on standard Empire/capsuleer technology (which is why T2 require Empire T2 shields and armor plates, as well as Radar sensors).  
---
The Zero-Point Condensate powers the Triglavian technology, and the Isogen-10 is a sound structure to build the light but strong Triglavian hulls with.
---
However, to upgrade you must salvage the actual componants of Trig tenchology (Lattis Laced Decaisogen, Zero-Point Field Manipulator, Radiation Absorption Thrusters, and Trinary State Processors). They use this to make the Empires fancy modified versions which are the T2
---
What is the scale of it?
---
Yes, both your corp and your enemies corp will require structures. All of this is possible on an Alpha.
---
They didnt even give it to the account i wanted to omega...
---
I didn‚Äôt say it was balanced just that people stoped doing it. You could increase the risk of any activity but if it drives people to stop doing it all together you have probably increased the risk too far. My main concern was subcap ratting as that was almost nonexistent

Tribute: Rote and Unspoken are friends. Trigger Happy and Toxic Co are friends. Centipede Caliphate has no blues within the region. Banderlogs wanted to take a krab pocket but Trigg and Toxic decided nah.
---
Vale: Reverberation Project and Forsaken Empire and friends. They also have positive standings with No Value, Divinity, and Scumlords.
---
NullSechnaya was recently crashing in JGAMP in Tribute but leadership went afk and so it fell apart with Drop the Soap going to PL.
---
Currently theres a war of sorts going on between Unspoken and Rote versus Reverb and FE. Both sides batphoned for some timers but Lords Servant (alliance head of FE) decided to be the next Jade Constantine and sperged out about it in grade A autism update posts. 
---
Recently Theran Alliance left GOTG and is seeking to place itself in Vale, in FE's advertised "rental area". Since LS' sperg and Rote's general dislike of a potential content area being farmed by renters, we are helping Theran establish themselves. Yesterday a great fight was had by even-sized fleets, and Theran was able to anchor and online a fortizar in FE's staging system, so thats cool I guess.
---
Its a great content area and unironically thanks to Imperium for glassing it from NCPL renters.

3D printing doesn't scale, each would take days to print, individually, let alone cleaning, assembly, paint.

Partial Tribute resident here, can confirm this is accurate. I believe there are more parties that are around, usually coming from Pure Blind - Project Gungnir and Cone/Fission occasionally drop by though I'm not sure who they're teamed with.

This fit is garbage. Why fly a cruiser that cost as much as a titan if you‚Äôre not going to bling it out.

Yeah, I hate plexing if I can avoid it, but if I have relatively passive income stream and can manage... then it lightens the load on the IRL wallet. Didn't get the offer on an account that I used to have a yearly sub on (along with the others), and all had lapsed to Alpha for years. All were last logged in on at the same interval, so I'm not sure what the reason is. Didn't get it on an old old old unused account on a different email either, so there's that.

They are actually bad, but you do you.
---
Any x-type mod gives a larger boost, and since its a capital you just refit in combat if they went all in on your lowest.
---
In that exact fit, a Reactive Armor Hardener gives like 50% more tank against 1 type, and 15% more tank against 2 types.

One result didn't feel so good in 2016.

Nah, he's right on point. Medium structures should all be good to anchor with just Anchoring 1 (or even no skill at all, I know it isn't listed on most of the Upwell Structures). Worked for me, at least.
---
Hey, are you the Paco from Knights Of The Posing Meat from back in 2011/2012?
---
Forgot the systems names, but the lowsec entrance from hisec is Atlar, then there is another lowsec or 2, then the island, but the island isn't the main pipe, just a small branch, usually this pipe wasn't camped by anyone other than myself and corpies but I've not lived there in years

It's been a long while since Relics have been way over Data in terms of ISK. But I honestly run both when I get the chance, even the lower tiers in nullsec. ISK is ISK.

Was already said thousand of times, and was already proven to be a very bad idea as many times.

Are they really spending that much effort avoiding people? Looking at local really doesn‚Äôt take much effort

Ok the one person Im more scared of that Freddy Van Holey is you. Except I'm scared of you in the irls.

So you put something in space you weren‚Äôt willing to lose and quit over it? Isn‚Äôt the first thing we tell noobs to not put something in space if they‚Äôre not willing to lose it, let alone defend it?
---
I have talked to many about this. It is really common to believe that, in a video game, it makes no sense to just play, even if you lose. I rather undock, try and lose than not undock and not even try.
---
I understand the argument that it takes time and effort to make ISK, but it's not really hard to make tons of ISK in a few hours and then welping the ships next time.
---
Those who refuse to fly "cheap" ships are just ruining it for themselves, I think, because in the end they're not having that much fun as compared to someone who flys "cheap" ships regularly.
---
Lots of reconnaissance and patience, and fresh bait alts every time.
---
Are people spending that much effort by opening a map and flying to the areas they already know where pve players are
---
And warping to anomalies they know they‚Äôre in
---
And shooting them already knowing they can‚Äôt beat the hunter?

It‚Äôs two sided

Hi /r/eve, I am corpmate of Zoxis, who, as you probably know lost his Fiend to a Gila and some Blops. I am bad storyteller, but pretty good at number crunching. As I found it hard to believe that afterburning Fiend could be caught by a Gila, I ran a quick analysis on the data available. Final result is that I strongly believe that the Fiend died due to some kind of bug which is connected to the failed attempt of ship to enter warp.

I heard a similar idea about citadels left unpowered for too long turning into derelict ruins that can be salvaged by player ships, much like Exploration sites. Interesting.
---
Concerning your idea on fits, nah. PVE ships hunt for money, PVP ships hunt for PVE ships because they're easy pickings, and often packed with expensive modules to max out their ticks.

I don't understand. He does not want people to play "his way", he wants people to play according to possibilities within the environment they choose to play in.
---
Your argument breaks apart when it is being used for other games. For some reason there are people who believe that "my way to play" somehow allows them to ignore that the ability to shoot down anyone anywhere exists because it is literally a part of the game and has nothing to do with what anyone wants, or doesn't want.
---
There is nothing toxic about asking people to play the game however they want, as long as they respect others for playing the game according to its possibilities. That's what's going on here.
---
You may wish not to PvP (generally speaking, not *you* specifically), but you simply have no right to ask others not to PvP you. There simply is no ground for that, because you're playing EVE ONLINE, where getting shot down is the norm.

well it gonna take weeks,because project is huge and evrything can happen,3d printers are not immune to malfunctions,i have read about 3d printing tons of websites and watched some videos too,problem with 3d printers is that they dont like printing objects that are empty inside.and before i load file to 3d printer i need modify it by adding  empty spaces for battery electronics and  engine pylons and top of hull will need to be perfectly flat because small solar panels would go up there

Same.

Just not feeling it I guess. I'm tired of logging in just to be aggravated with the state of the game. Just stopped being fun for me.

To be fair to Illy, he was against it from the start. He's left Eve, but he's still our mate and we will still be in touch and playing some other games. Even off for a meet up with him in early Oct.

Was bound to happen dude. Take a break, come back when you decide to. We're all still here and you know you got us on comms whenever you want.
---
Probably so people don't farm Triglav materials into excess. I saw a scorpion sit, tank and kill four fleets worth of those little baby Triglavian ships once.
---
Burgerman is still alive? I heard aw0xu is recruiting... stedic has some nice recruitment app
---
Be in your own standing fleet, you know, the right one and you won't get fleet invites ...
---
it's no rocket science ...
---
So you added your own salt to somehow enhance the already salty thread?
---
Very helpful.
---
I haven't played in a while, but the VNI was always good for a cheap ratting drone boat.
---
I kind of hope they do the same thing to TQ. Let's see who can shut this bitch down faster: CCP or the Chinese.
---
I disagree with your point of view of my point of view.
---
ü§´
---
That's very nice man. I want to just say what you probably already know but, as much as I'm sure he enjoyed the game, I guarantee that he loved spending time with you even more. Condolences.
---
You are free to disagree all you like. It doesn't change that you're not respecting the game for what it is and that you're trying to guilt trip others into playing how you want them to play, claiming they don't respect "your playstyle".
---
You would not play Rust asking people to "respect your playstyle" aka "I do not wish to get killed". Yet, in EVE ONLINE, you do.
---
I'm not falling for this playstyle-fallacy. In reality it is you who does not respect the game and also does not respect those who play the game how it is meant to be played. This goes beyond "playstyles".
---
Anyhow, besides all the above, I still wish you a nice day.
---
Sometimes he'll feed with a "miner" a few days in a row to the person he is targeting using a new account in a venture and then after a few times he decloaks a bomber for the instant scram and drops the blops ships on the target. It's seriously impressive how he often he pulls that stuff off
---
*you're

Oh same nyt that blamed planes for 9/11 yeah okay if you say so.

You better have visited the ice cream shop across the street.
---
It hella good
---
Oh trust me I know, it was just something that kinda drove me nuts at times, sitting at the keyboard with him looking in from the door lol.
---
I've a Prophecy that sometimes goes out hunting Trigs. What would he have named it?
---
Tru. 
---
But cloning is a privilege, not a right.

I went from dragoon to geddon with Rick's Rocket 1-4 lol. Fly them for missions now that I can without tearing up
---
Except, there's barely any in Starship Troopers.
---
If you want to read a proper satire book you might want to read "Gargantua and Pantagruel"
---
Also, you don't know what is my movie idea.
---
stfu pl scum
---
I'm developing a "fuck you" attitude. You must be a krab.
---
Ricks Rocket it is my friend. Both of you fly safe, whatever sky it is.
---
Which is why I said it should be focused on the empires as most of them *general population* don't have clones. A capsuleer would be a rare sight to an avg person.
---
I hate to be the bearer of bad news (nah I actually enjoy it) but Eve is fucked.
---
It really doesn't matter what CCP, Eve is dying and they know it
---
The population of Eve has sloy been falling year after year and reason is simply but impossible to change. 
---
The is the new generation of gamers simply are not interested in relics like Eve. The stats have provewthis time and again. Thousand of people are trying yet only a handful stay. 
---
Those few that do decide to stay is not enough to cover those who are losing. 
---
The Eve player base is aging. As time goes on, people get older, they aquire more responsibility and can no longer invest the amount of time needed. Others just fall out of love of the game.
---
CCP is and has been for a while now moving as much resource as possible on new projects in the vain hope of getting a new game whilst investing as little as they can in Eve. 
---
You can talk about new ideas as much as you like, christ you have been doing for years and guess what, nothing has changed. 
---
By all means keep at it but sooner or later even the most ardent Eve addicts will realise this is the case. 
---
My suggestion is to just to enjoy the game and ride it until the end. Stop worrying about what CCP might do or could do because it's a fruitless endeavour. 
---
Just enjoy it for what it is.
---
Salute to the passed away co-pilot. Those are rare these days and precious.

Memorial Service

Hello everyone,
---
As some may not be aware on September 20th at 4:40pm Central Time a member of our corporation  Big Country Boy  lost his Grandfather
---
He was 84 years old, Served in the Korean war and reffered to the game with his grandson as "That spaceship game"
---
This game and its community brought him interest and comfort 
---
I have been in communication with  Big Country Boy and with his permission I have began setting up a memorial service to take place for him on Thursday the 26th at 21:00 Eve Time
---
As it stands right now the memorial will be taking place in Oshaima at our HQ
---
Please give  Big Country Boy  your condolences during this hard time and I will keep everyone posted if anything changes with these plans.
---
Thank you,
---
   Ender
---
# Note: Big Country Boy is my in game name
---
Fair enough. I've been basing my assumptions on the number of upvotes and medals the post got, as well as it's like ratio. It would make sense that a lot of people who disagree simply ignore the post rather than downvote it.
---
Both might do the trick, but I know I'm not good enough to put them aligned like that.
---
Glue does seem to be a good workaround.
---
Thanks for the answers guys. Well I dont know. It seems quite entangling and all to be in a corp but ye know. I just want some solo action before I join a blob I might leave the next day. I dont know. Ill just leave it for now and see if after a month I am still in it. If yes, then lets go!
---
&gt;Yeah, that totally would have worked against 1000 INIT  
---
&gt;:eyeroll:
---
:thonkeyes: almost like I was there and saw (and made some of) the dscans
---
Finally hit the bottom of the barrel when u resort to grammar nazi. Snuff joke alliance. Too scared to throw fully into null

May he find eternal life behind the eve gate.

CONE are deep USTZ pureblind guys but we are friendly with them from other operations (Such as blopsing and dropping the shit out of GOTG space) and help each other mutually against larger numbers, such as when Lord's batphones NC or when CONE needs help against GOTG's F1 blob.
---
If everything in this game is calculated this way I am not sure I want to play it. Is it still a game? Forex Online? I joined EVE cause I love space. I love astrophysics. There is no other game that can give me that with some market stuff involved.
---
FE,making enemies all over The Vale. 
---
Reverb, time to think about how tight you are with these tools.

# Get wrecked

Wrong

My grandfather was an electronics geek who would scurry off to his ‚Äòradio room‚Äô after dinner to play with the ‚Äòinternet‚Äô and his H.A.M. radios back in the early 00‚Äôs.  He would have loved Eve if only I was into it back then.  I would have loved to have played ‚Äòthe spaceship game‚Äô with him.  
---
Wtf am I lookin at?
---
Till they reworked it recently. It's a blaster drone boat now. Only three heavies.
---
Exactly.  You wouldn‚Äôt play rust and say ‚Äúeveryone stand outside your bases so i can kill you easily or else the devs should nerf bases‚Äù
---
It‚Äôs a ludicrously entitled sentiment and you know it
---
yes
---
I‚Äôm assuming the inverse function of how more plex sells leads to less accounts, or the allegation thereof
---
F 07
---
I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs the reason people stayed docked
---
We have a streamlined recruitment process. As the introductory corp for Snuffed Out we aim to make the process as simple as possible.
---
No they usually spawn all kinds of sites tho usually c2-5 sites.
---
Red = Players, Blue = PLEX
---
When PLEX prices were low, there were lots of players. Now that PLEX prices are high, there are few players.
---
AT is a shitty meme and it's dead. Praise bob.
---
Can you post the data so I can figure out how bad the r^2 is
---
True... pm gypsy if your interested
---
C18?? C13 you mean? The c5 wolf ryets with small ents?
---
A graph of PLEX cost over time compared to a graph of peak concurrent players over time.
---
The implication is that the two are directly linked, and possibly that increased PLEX costs are the primary cause of lower player numbers, rather than the laundry list of boneheaded changes over time that have contributed to the decline from the 60k peaks.
---
Especially interesting once you consider the game is significantly more alt-heavy now than ever
---
pretty sure you wont know until development switches over to PA
---
More or less that. Just an observation.
---
Pretty simple really. If subs are harder to obtain, fewer people will sub. Who would have thought.
---
Sorry to hear about the loss of your grandfather. It's great to hear that you got to share an interest with him, and bond over the love of the game. Many people don't appreciate the opportunity of something like that until it's too late.
---
r^(2 =) 0.699 (obligatory *nice*)
---
But I wouldn't trust that. If you want real data for statistical analysis you'll want to export what you can from eve-marketdata and other sites. This isn't enough data points to do it properly. Historical EVE market data seems difficult to find since it goes back &gt;10 years. I used what I could from various sites to piece together historical prices but some of the day-by-day values will not be exact (e.g. where you see January 1st may be from Dec. 25th, for example, because it was the closest I could get). If I could find a source with exact day-by-day values that would be better but these will have some fluctuation.
---
Not enough AT ships are dying. Elite pvpers must double their efforts.
---
I love that you morons still have zero sense of humor. Don't ever change (just be like your underwear).
---
It's $45 for a signed photo. $30 if you provide your own photo.

here's your sick BR btw  [https://br.inyour.space/?s=232&amp;b=8794200&amp;e=210&amp;t=rsfugaaq](https://br.inyour.space/?s=232&amp;b=8794200&amp;e=210&amp;t=rsfugaaq)
---
I mean, or there is no reason to play because it isn‚Äôt fun for you or your playstyle
---
Which is a big thing in aged games where Vets minmax to fuck and stomp new players with malice
---
Alliance tournament was cancelled so CCP could focus on implementing changes and balance to the game. It should be out Summer 2019. Tiericide, shield slaves etc. 
---
Oh, wait.
---
o7 pilot.
---
Because doing otherwise would be losing a fight on purpose, and that's fucking dumb.
---
I know where you are coming from here, and I get it, but that's not really why I am quitting. I was willing to lose it, that's why I lived there, and that is why I "ctrl-a, right click, trash it" everything once it was clear that there was no way we were going to be able to repel them. I'm quitting the game because the content is no longer enjoyable for me. I decided that I would play until "this" happened and it happened, and I am done. It is really not that complicated or dramatic.   
---
Sure, I was hoping there would be some sort of fight to be had, but really it wasn't a fight and it was never going to be. HK and IH are meta min-maxers who play a "heads I win, tails you lose" lawyer ball, a part of Eve I never really cared for. There was never a chance that they would lose, or they wouldn't have come. Good for them, and good for my corp mates and all of those who came to help for engaging them if that is what they felt they needed to do. I felt my duty was to not hand any assets or content to them, a stance that is clearly not shared by anyone else in my corp, but hey, they don't pay my subscription, so. It is was it is and it was what it was, a fun run.
---
o7 sorry for your lost. 
---
*The cyno is now lit*
---
If there's data to show that then sure vOv This is a subreddit full of "vets" who post here but haven't actually logged in for years.
---
We won't blue them but we'll kill them if they try anything funny and if anyone trys to attack them we'll defend them. Not blue though.
---
Yeah man, can't wait! You're a good dude patting these dudes on the back... I don't know how you do it. :)
---
haha i think the first time he saw me doing it he was hooked on watching, but by then his fingers couldn't have moved well enough even if he could have remembered how to play, so he was more than happy to watch me make them dance. I did kind of realize though Amarr ships look a lot like old movie space ships, so I guess his inner sci fi nerd was showing.
---
The blob must be sig tanking !
---
Too lazy to Google but not lazy enough to post a Reddit thread about being lazy? Dafuq
---
Pretty simple logic really. If i buy plex.i domt need 15 alts to keep up with everyone
---
Make all ECMs work like burst jammers. Still RNG based, but when it works, you just have to relock your targets instead of being fucked for 20s. Most effective against battleships/capitals, and would make solo ECM viable-ish...
---
Well.  Try logging in and making a poll then, especially for alphas who quit .  
---
Arbitrary numbers of one change are part of the whole picture.  Changes in gank mechanics, new asset safety and cits, injectors, all these came to make it more Vet and endgame friendly
---
I know it's supposed to be a joke, but i can't help being disapointed by that one loss... like come on, so much for an esport ready game right?
---
the plan to divide humanity is progressing apace
---
man i miss you :(
---
**THE AT WAS ONLY INTERESTING WHEN I COULD BET A SHIT TON OF ISK ON THE ROUNDS**
---
I live for these
---
This graph is worthless without taking into account the price of other things in eve at the time. How much purchasing power there was for isk/how large the active isk supply was in 2009 as opposed to 2019. We know that there has been significant inflation in plex prices due to highly scalable multiboxing pve content. How are you accounting for that?
