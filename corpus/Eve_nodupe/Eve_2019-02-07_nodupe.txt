Well the ship balance is shit but at least we have some bland chinese server skins imported.

Google "Russian insults"
---
cool so I'm not the only one who came back to the game after the change and said WTF when seeing the new skill window.
---
cyka blyat
---
yeah, that will make it so much easier for new player don't you know, just fucking bury all the windows they need and shove the plex store in their face...
---
)))
---
From a wormhole?
---
I'm not in BSC nor do I have an alt in there. I have a friend in BSC  
---

---
BSC is pretty much a noob corp where the CEO runs all the 'services' and the members are newbies who mine ore in ventures for his bad buyback programs
---
you joke, but who knows what CCP's next brilliant idea will be?
---
Coca Cola. Disney land. 
---
No complaint there.
---
Wicked Creek
---
Was. Not anymore. Plus limited local would still show total number of people in local. Just not who.
---
By your standards (seeing how many of Mitten's loads you can catch between the dimples on your lower back) yes I'm terrible.
---
When you put it like that, it makes a lot of sense actually. I'm not exactly in the best financial position at the moment, hence why I'm trying to spend as little as possible, but if that changes after a few months of enjoyable play, I might consider getting a premium account.
---
It's my understanding it works as a subscription system type thing? So like a monthly payment or something? If I just buy the premium for one month, will I still be able to access/use everything I used when I had premium after it expires?
---
I've literally never done that. Shut up krab.
---
Hot take
---
Let’s post some solutions then for people who might be in this situation.
---
Where would you recommend they go?
---
Anywhere but BSC is not a great answer. Let’s be specific!
---
Implying krabs are "newbies." Oh yes that poor defenseless 80mil Rorqual pilot multiboxing 8 other rorqs is such a poor noob.
---
I'm pretty sure it rounds to the nearest interger?
---
Thanks for the reply. Yes, it would be a distinguishing feature of a newbie alliance to be able to hand out, say, cruisers, where most other alliance won't hand out anything larger than a frigate or destroyer. And you make a good point that it's not necessary to comb the killboard for losses, instead performing a payback check before handing out a second hull. You're probably getting most of your downvotes because you're criticizing the status quo and advocating a socialist practice. Don't be too discouraged.

eve is afk game, while you play something else on your main screen
---
I don't really know what much of that is, but if I understand correctly, he's fitted a ship/ships with $1.600 of upgrades(?) and dropped (and presumably lost) $1.040 of it?
---
If that's the case, yikes. I hope he didn't actually spend $1.6k.
---
"the glistening lasers splashing across the hulls of the enemy battle ships made my elf nipples erect like the very avatar I was piloting."

We'll keep getting downvoted but who cares. Glorious monochrome UI people, unite

Whatever you give me i double it and give it back
---
The mino clicked jump 10 seconds earlier than he should have and landed inside of the boson (not to mention the rng for him to land in the cone), that’s not due to confusion that’s a single guys mistake. 
---
Not to mention the fact that your comp had next to no logi and nothing for anti fighters meaning you guys couldn’t contest the field for a second as soon as the supers jumped, which is ultimately your fc’s fault.
---
That's not what he said. If you look at it as a free trial you won't be disappointed. What did you lose? It's free. You might find it restrictive and pay 5 hours in. You might play for a year for free before you decide to pay. You might play for a few weeks and get bored and wander off. Give it a go.
---
By putting a message out there and if someone wants to talk to them they can talk to you back?
---
Agreed. 
---
I'll admit that burying the Market or Wallet window is stupid, but... Am I really the only person who uses keyboard shortcuts instead? Alt-R: Market. Alt-W: Wallet. Alt-T: Assets. And so on...

Hell, I even bind extra shortcuts. Alt-Numpad+ : Calculator.

Almost like flooding the game with rorquals hurt the mineral prices or something.

hurrrrr teh salt must flow guys hahaha i wrote "salt" on reddit i r funneh :brainlet: ecks deeeee
---
You no own wrecks, you no own space.
---
I talked to the guy I mentioned in my original post about the game and he told me a bunch of stuff about plex and isck(?) and stuff like that, nothing I really comprehend yet, but he did explicitly say a number of times *'don't go into mining.'* Is that similar to high sec? Are these just boring ways of playing the game?
---
If your into it you will likely Wana pay for the sub. If not then you likely won't play. Eve for most people either grabs your or it doesn't. 
---
You want to REALLY piss them off? Tell them you think the Belsen school siege didn't go far enough. 
---
Are you getting hit by a lot of cloaky titans?
---
It is, because you know what a fair price would be, because people do research on input cost before they set prices for services.
---
You chose to go for an extortionate scheme, so approaching you in private would've just been ignored. I opted to shitpost and embarrass you because that is more likely to actually get you to change your prices, or lose potential recruits if you don't.
---
Maybe there shouldn't be "pve ships." they should all be pvp ready.
---
Okay activating a cloak shows you up in local. Problem solved.
---
100mn ab, large pb cap battery, cap recharger, drone nav in mids. Lows 4DDAs, medium armor rep, reactive armor hardener. High can do drone link and auto targeter. Rigs 2 cap rechargers 1 PG enhancer...forget the names, on my phone, but that fit works well in my experience. think at low ish sp you need the monopropellent 100mn to be cap stable
---
you can either asset safety it, or fire sale it remotely with contracts, and as to being in a  keepstar you don't belong to joining the locals is the customary way to return to nullsec life.
---
That sounds terrible. 
---
Nice.
---
I probably would have cut it before the cut to the chunk with text.
---
Yes, its a monthly subscription with options for longer subscriptions making it cheaper per month. When you go back to alpha state from omega, you will keep access to all skills that are available to alpha accounts, even if that means you break the 5 million SP cap that is in place for alpha AFAIK. However, you wont be able to make use of omega exclusive skills. Not having the money every month or even at all is obviously okay. 
---
80% Jita Buy Buyback is not reasonable. Goons are paid 89% Jita Buy for their ore, and they have a low rate because they have many many miners, and thus a huge glut of supply for ore, lowering the percentages. BSC has nowhere near Goon volume, yet they're offering less than goons?
---
To LSH: My knowledge, training, and experience is available for rent for 100b. I guarantee a supercap kill on the first fleet, or your money back. Please let me know. 
---
No certain skills and therefore ships are not unlocked for alpha even if you have them trained in omega and then dropped the sub for alpha.
---
A lot of alliances have Collateral fees. This doesn't seem too insane to me.
---
jump in carrier, launch hic from sma, jump in hic, tackle supers
---
So is the AAR rule not be enforced anymore or?
---
Dear LSH: My knowledge, training, and experience is available for 100b. I guarantee a supercap kill on the first fleet, or your money back. Let me know. 
---
This is to Wicked Creek, where they currently live.
---
Dont use it then. People who whine about having the shittiest part of the game done for them = actual shit.
---
Wasnt expecting it to be eve. 10/10 nice troll.
---
Alright sweet. I think after all this procrastination I'm just gonna hop in and give the game a go.
---
This is the correct answer
---
we had more than 1 titan for every dread lmao fucking idiots get fucked we're so good did anyone bat phone goons yet
---
There is a 'trick' to ACLs:  you can only block in the same ACL that you grant access.
---
Example:  if you allow everyone with 'public', you can still deny people/corps/alliances, but you must have the deny in the same ACL.
---

How much does it cost for the JF? How many light years? How many mids? What other overheads are involved? Oh, you don't know? Do you run a JF service? No? Ok.
---
wow this guy tries to steal wrecks from 9 day year old guy and comes here to play the victim
---
I'd agree with you, if it wasn't for the screenshot having nothing to do with Buybacks. 
---
If something says "No contracts over 2b" at the bottom of a post wholely dedicated to Freight, I'm assuming that it's about freight.
---
They're going to Wicked Creek, not Cobalt Edge, CE is where Roxxen claimed they're moving, to which I say, good luck.
---
Ah, so adding a rig that takes me from 2.49s to 2.01s is worthless? This would be great if it were true. I could use the extra rig slot lol
---
You find it hard to believe that a newer corporation, is not as competitive on buybacks as the biggest ones out there?  
---
80% might not be the best deal, though it is certainly not the worst I have seen.
---
Well someone does, because this same retarded shit from Roxxen now has BSC removed from Theran Alliance
---
Also Jesse messaged me asking me to take down the mail screenshots, because "Panfam got angry" lol
---
So it sounds like you care
---
Several choices.  
---
If you want to be unaligned, you go to Brave Newbies or Eve Uni  
---
If you like PanFam, Horde
---
If you like TEST, Dreddit  
---
If you like goons, Karmafleet
---
These are all excellent, tried and true corps for new players
---
DM me your in-game name once you're to that point and I'll gift you a month of omega that way your skills train at full speed (the ads say omega is 2x training speed but realistically alphas train at .5x).
---
No I'm pretty sure you're just fucking stupid and nobody said any of that.
---
Right, but your analogy is a bit messed up.  
---
Goons are the supermarket. They sell ore cheaper than anywhere. Yet they somehow still manage to pay their miners more for the ore than the corner store? That's a messed up corner store.

Do the tutorials, run the SOE epic arcs to get a feel of the game. After that apply to some null sec corporation to actually dive in. Try Pandemic Horde, maybe, they are the most uncomplicated to get into I think and definitely newbro friendly. Or go for Dreddit, which is part of my alliance. Being active on reddit is one way to join them, I think your account qualifies and its a little closer knit community than PH is, still a big alliance and corporation, tho.

No, just a member of the majority of the subreddit getting sick of INIT smugposting every time you blob something. Which has been going on since INIT's inception.

Would you not blob a dreadbomb?

I'd like to thank Nina and the entire Anchauttes pipe for this piece of useless knowledge that will take up space in my brain for the rest of my life.

They're afk ratting in a VNI, duh.
---
Not worthless, but align has got to be below 2s, due to the way the server ticks work, to be effective as instawarp.

---
He seems to want to set up PI on Mars.  Well got to fund his Titan somehow.
---
1300 to wc is still a fair price
---
Yeah its good that you gave them props, that is nice. However you changed the argument about fitting to location. The fit would still be gay if you used it in nullsec on a gate.
---
\&gt;that's a quotation, fucktard)
---
cool, come back when you can take critique without throwing a hissy fit
---
Why goon pets so salty today? Is it a biggest victory for init for all time? 
---
Dude this is basic economics..
---
&gt;It's not really relevant to EVE or CCP,
---
He worked for CCP, it's definitely relevant. It's not something anyone should hold against CCP though.
---
Looking at the kill board of some of these dread pilots it doesn't look like they abhorred unfair odds too much. 
---
Yes, it is basic economics. Large amount of supply = devalued. Ore is rarer anywhere else in the game compared to Goon space. Which means they should have a HIGHER % buyback than Goons. But they have  a lower buyback, significantly so.
---
If you know they are actually from the country of Russia... Call them Ukrainian. 
---
Eh is it?  He was a contractor for them and obviously it's his personal life. If it was stuff found on company computers or people groomed through EVE or something then that's definitely relevant. As it stands it's a guy with a tenuous link to the game that's done some messed up things.
---
If you buy the reaction outputs you don't have to mine.

If you consider [ building hundreds of T1 modules to get started, running dozens of invention jobs, hauling that materials to your production facility, submitting hundreds of 10-run jobs that take a few each hours to finish, hauling the products back to market, and then listing them ] to be passive then yes it's good money.
---
4th post with same BR and no content. 
---
Mods, do your thing.
---
The answer, as mentioned in that link is:
---
Align time ALWAYS rounds UP. So, a 2.01s align time will effectively warp the ship at 3s. Investing in align if you can’t get below the next integer is a waste, according to this article. 
---
Though I have to say, it feels like my frigate with a 2.01 align time gets into warp noticeably quicker than my cruiser with a 2.73s align time. 
---
As long as you consider [ building thousands of T1 modules to get started, running dozens of invention jobs, hauling that materials to your production facility, converting the mats into components, submitting hundreds of 10-run jobs that take a few each hours to finish, hauling the products back to market, and then listing them ] to be passive then yes it's good money.
---
Yeah that 30-dreadspawn wave was a bit excessive, at least he got 900m bounty (30ish dreads x 60m bounty) plus some dank loot.
---
Indeed. I've known some people to spend a weekend doing things they don't really enjoy like exploration or ratting just to pay for the 30day License Extension then enjoy doing what they like the rest of their time. Personally, I'd rather just pay the monthly fee and enjoy my ingame money for whatever. Everyone's situation is different though.

I would, but I wouldn't immediately go to reddit bragging about "annihilating the fleet." Who knows maybe you were seeding that molok in rock haven for a year and your planning finally paid off big time
---
&gt;Why the fuck should I wait a second
---
Yikes
---
Good responses, or you could also say. "Do you like Putin? Because I will be Putin my balls in your mouth" :)
---
Maybe if you mean rubbing salt in the wound. 
---
$5242 total cost. I bet he spent some IRL cash and a bunch of his in game ISK
---
ok, i laughed! I admit that!
---
What was the fateful bait?  That Molok?
---
Yup, it was me. Get unbanned after 3 months, lol.
---
I was just making a remark, besides, I ain't even rich enough to be in a molok, much less just go out and boson rat in it. I was sitting in my rorq just chewing on a rock and just de-seiged to warp off to go try to help and defend, by the time I started gating everything was dead already....
---
So the answer, according to this article is that:
---
Align time will always round UP. Investing in an align time that can’t be lowered past X.00 is effectively a waste. 
---
Though I have to say, my frigate with an align time of 2.01s seems to initiate warp noticeably quicker than my cruiser with an align time of 2.73s. Maybe it’s just my brain playing tricks on me?
---
"Everything is wrong! Your opinion is wrong! You're fun is wrong! Stop playing the game the way you want to play it and play it the way I want to play it! My way is the right way! The only way! Blah blah blah blah!" 
---
I'm just realizing how tiring this is after having 3 of my opinions voted down.
---
Ammo types and how they map back to your overall ehp.. ships and ammos and the relationships go how bonuses correlate. How to also look at likely ships on grid and guesstimate how you’re likely fit would stack against said opponent.. how does different ranges and angles etc affect your fits impact on offense strategies vs defense ..
---
How the different armor shield ratios stack and when they are optimal to be skewed in a particular direction or not?
---
That’s about 42 videos in itself but honestly this is the correct attitude to walk into an eve series with .. I look forward to your output as I’m a few years in on eve and wise enough to say I’m probably not far ahead of a newbro on this subject .. so you’ll get a sub / like from me once they’re done.
---
My main is headed for carrier so this might be the move for me. I've just got all my ships and have ye old afk vni (and closely stratios alt lmao) to tide me over
---
Lol
---
&gt;As it stands it's a guy with a tenuous link to the game that's done some messed up things.
---
I'm not saying it's more than that, just saying that it's relevant because he worked for them. Contracted or not, it's relevant to CCP the same way it's relevant to a sports team when a former athlete does something stupid.

\*\*Incoming wall of text warning \*\* I don't know how far you have looked into the game and to answer your question you need to have at least a basic understanding of the game as the anwser is not as simple as yes or no.
---
Highsec, Lowsec and nullsec are the 3 main areas of the game, there is also wormhole space and abysal space, but as an alpha and a new player, those two areas involve a level of complication that most find rather difficult until you have absorbed at least the basics of the game play and mechanics.   
---
Most games have a grouping functionality to allow players to work together, in Eve these are referred to as Corporations (groups of players) and Alliances (groups of corporations), now there are also groups of alliances called coalitions which you will hear refferred to in this sub all the time, but these are player made agreements only, there is no in game functionality to accommodate  that type of grouping together.  
---
Highsec  (1.0 to 0.5 security space) You are relatively safe here, players can kill you, but unless they are in a corporation that has declared war on the corporation you are a apart of the the NPC police ships will attack and kill them, though there is a delay to this function so don't fly around with valuable cargo unless you want someone to try and take it. the majority of mission agents and mission running players are located here as well as a large miner population, the payout for mining here is not as good as lowsec or nullsec. \*\*Capital ships can not enter highsec.
---
  
---
Lowsec  (0.4 to .01 security space) There is no NPC police ship here to protect you, but there are guns located on NPC stations and gates, if someone attacks you there the guns will fire on them but there is no garuntee they will kill the person attacking you before they kill you. Travel at your own risk here and preferably in a fast ship. Lowsec is where you will find faction warfare and pvpers who don't like the nullsec style of play. There are mission agents and missions to be run here but the risk is much higher here than in highsec. Mining in lowsec is not recommended because most lowsec player will kill a miner if they find them. \*\*Capital ships can be used here as can titans and supercarriers, but the titans main weapon AKA the Doomsday, can not be used in low sec, stealth bombers can not drop bombs in lowsec and warp disruption bubbles can not be used here. ( I know some of these terms may not make sense to you, but the eve uni wiki I linked above can explain them if you want to look them up)
---
Nullsec (0.0 security space) Anyone and sometimes everyone can and will kill you, there are no NPC police ships and there are no gate guns here, welcome to the wild west of eve. There are mission agents here but they are few and far between for the most part and the risk at running them in any territory you do not own is pretty high. Mining here has the highest payout as the most valuable ore types are found here both in regular asteroid belts and in moon mining. Running anomalies in a ship fit for PVE is much more viable here as the payout is a lot better than low sec or high sec. Exploring is also a much more viable way of making money in null than the other locations, but it would take me forever to explain that so here's a link where eve uni does it better than I can [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Exploration\_101](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Exploration_101)  Nullsec also is where you will find the player built empires the majority of stations in this part of the game are owned by the people who live here and you will most likely not be able to dock there unless you are a member of one of their corporations. \*\*Capitals(dreadnoughts, carriers and force auxiliaries) and super capitals (supercarriers and titans) can be used here as well as built here, the titan Doomsday weapon functions here, stealth bombers can drop bombs and warp disruption bubbles can be deployed here.  
---
Now to answer your question about fun, it strongly depends on your point of view and what you personally find fun. when I started playing years ago I was a highsec mission runner... for about a month and then I just couldn't take the repetition anymore. I had started playing the day after goonswarm had kicked Band of brothers out of Delve for the firsrt time and after reading about what was involved I decided nullsec was where I wanted to be. Being a relative new bro and having around a month and a half's worth of skills and no clue how to actually live in nullsec, I took the first offer I could get which ended up being from an empire industry corp moving out to Deklein ([http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Deklein](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Deklein)) to join a pet (an alliance not capable of holding its own space) of the old school Northern Coalition (not to be confused with NC.)   
---
I never intended to be a miner, primarily I wanted to pvp and rat for my isk. But while hanging out with them I decided to give it a shot and found it to be easy enough to do that I could mine while doing my college assignments, watching TV or reading a book. To be fair if you sit there and stare at your screen and watch the numbers in your ore hold go up you will be bored, but the majority of miners don't play that way and the ones that do are running so many accounts at one time that they don't have time to be bored. I know several people that would happily sit in a belt every minute of every day they are online mining so they can build more stuff because that is the part of the game they like. I also know more than a few people who would rather jump off a building than ever go mining even once. At this point in my eve career my main income is generated ratting in nullsec which while slightly repetitive is made more endurable with a coms channel full of people to talk with while playing, and there's always netflix. So without trying to sound like a cliche eve really is a sandbox, what I find fun or what the other person you talked to finds fun might not be what you like to do. This game is not like most MMO's you don't have to find a single thing  your character is good at and do only that. Check out the twitch streams for eve and you can see several different types of game play without needing to commit your characters training until you find something to build towards.
---
Right that's what I'm trying to do for sure. The corp mining ops payout differently, 85% to the miner, 5% to the corp, and 10% to the Orca, so I feel like everyone makes ok money that way, and the corp can use the 5% for getting structures up, and fueling them.
---
AAR: After a year of prep, the dreadbomb finally came. As we sat waiting on day 378 of our bait op ready to call it a day, we saw some neuts enter local and finally thought this could be it! Suddenly a cyno appears next to our bait Molok who was happily boson ratting (he upgraded from an Avatar around day 253 due to accumulating so much isk). We promptly cyno'd up and brought in our surprise party, all our patience had finally paid off! I'd like to thank all the guys who made it possible, some waiting 9hrs each day for this to happen. They really went above and beyond. gf LSH
---
is this just a safer way of traveling in a hic or catching people by surprise that you have a hic ready?
---
This is the eve that CCP created. The best strategy to survive (in nullsec at least) is to just blue up with the big dogs and turbokrab.
---
Everyone’s keen to punish the pilot .. I would have transferred 500m into his account and said “you could have gotten a billion tonight .. lesson of the day is in eve you always observe your enemy before you rush to conclusions .. watch their actions not what they say”
---
That alone will stay with him for quite a while as it demonstrates you’re firstly rich as fuck enough to not be haggling over a scrap pile .. it says you’re paying it forward and it will likely make him hesitate on similar activity in the future..
---
Beating him senseless just reinforces Eve is just a cruel wasteland in space, resulting in yet another new bro running back to wow ..

Neither. Titan bridge range is 6 ly at max skills. You can jump farther in a carrier. By ghost riding you are able to bring hics with you on ops that trans could not bridge to

The product in this case is not ore.  The product is buyback capacity: that is, they're "selling" liquidity.

We usually kill em.
---
So exicited opening r/eve and seeing 4 posts about INIT counter in their home with titans ppl that had more balls then them. 
---
PI is based off the type of planet of which is publically available information and is why you are able to search PI information. The exact composition of a moon does not relate to its type and there is no public dump of all this data made by CCP. You generally won't find information about moon compositions as it requires a lot of effort to scan every moon and alliances do not want to give out easy intel on where their most valuable moons are. 
---
right and all that is blocked by alpha clone ship and skill limits, so there are some things restricted but most new players don't realize they might want those ship until later.
---
memes come with wars.
---
what wars have we had? closest thing to a war was test driving there dreads into the grave.

and with citadels being so spammable (take longer to kill due to dmg cap and reinforce timers,  than it takes to build 3 new ones),  evicting isn't worth the effort.
---
excitement will come when it comes.
---
WHers gave enough of a shit to try and rage roll into rage as a community to defend the people who had been dicking them over for a long time.
---
You don't krab in WH while living in null, that's silly.
---
lol. Im actually the Fc of that fleet. It's not as easy as you think. Even if seems similar. Remember that anyone can join horde so if INIT was hunting with multiple spies in their fleet we would probably see different results. Also i'm fighting in delve . While you fight in Branch and Dekklein.  But you must be sour for this maybe? [https://zkillboard.com/related/30004579/201901271700/](https://zkillboard.com/related/30004579/201901271700/)

&gt;“It is worth repeating at this point the theories that Grath Telkin had come up with, on his first encounter with human beings, to account for their peculiar habit of continually stating and restating the very very obvious, as in "It's a nice day," or "You're very tall," or "So this is it, we're going to die."
---
&gt;His first theory was that if human beings didn't keep exercising their lips, their mouths probably shriveled up.
---
&gt;After a few months of observation he had come up with a second theory, which was this--"If human beings don't keep exercising their lips, their brains start working.” 
---
So they just provide botting ISK to legacy. Thanks for clearing that up.
---
Wouldn't be always in wormhole. Just maybe do a bit whenever a suitable hole pops up in system 
---
......... legacy in every *real* fight has had horrible FAX numbers.
---
we actually just evicted them from feyth for not paying their bills so they certainly aren't the botters you would think. 
---
&gt;r/
---
AAR:  A cyno went up next to the Molok.   The dreads came in.  Before the 5 minutes was up they all died.  RIP faxes that were lost.
---
Not that I'm paying attention to this thread but somehow every group has salty pilots after every op or fight whether or not their group was even involved
---
Nah, you actually do get into warp faster. The 1s tick interval just defines how frequently external effects can impact you.
---
I'd bet that lone rorq on the km with staggered escalation to bait out the full dreadbomb
---
and here I am just learning they exist
---
Most of the bots in game are still in Drone Regions and Winter Co. space. Go talk to skillu and FRT.

In which a brainless spodsucker actually believes what he reads on reddit.

I think their main bot maker quit. https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/8yipyt/confession_of_a_botmaker/

Are you going to continue to offer them protection in Omist?

You forgot northern tears rorq/carrier being too OP

All eve property belongs to you insofar as you are able to defend it
---
**General Q&amp;A stuff about this**
---
**This will just lead to 1000-man guardian fleets**
---
I haven’t run the numbers but I’d be OK with making supercaps immune to all remote reps, or having a 99% reduction in all incoming reps, etc. (Especially if you want to keep fax for subcap triage, although subcap/WH fax needs another balance pass as well.) In-combat reps on supercaps need to be removed from the game, but any implementation method works.
---
**Some alliances *do* use their supers in a risky fashion!**
---
You’ll notice these alliances are groups like Black Legion that aren’t trying to hold sov. Since they don’t have sov and keepstars to lose, they can function without their super fleet, meaning they can risk it. (My proposed solution tries to make it so every alliance can function without their super fleet, allowing them to risk it!) 
---
**Some people do solo/smallgang in supercaps!**
---
Some people are absolute ballers. It doesn’t mean the current meta isn’t ass. 
---
**What if everyone just grew some balls?**
---
Not realistic; not enough people will do it, and the people who don’t do it will end up running the game. It’s also not fair to ask people to put that much work in and then deliberately gimp their playstyle for the sake of ‘gudfites’, risking losing to paper-pushers who play optimally. 
---
**The current meta isn’t unfair**
---
You’re right, it’s not unfair. It just sucks ass. 
---
**You just want to nerf our ships because you aren’t willing to build or risk an opposing super fleet!** 
---
You aren’t willing to risk your supers either – that’s why you joined GSF/PL/Test, blued everyone within 5 regions of you, etc. 
---
And you’re right to not risk ‘em! Risking your supers as a sovnull alliance is a ***terrible***, self-destructive idea, because you can’t protect your space without them! That’s the whole point of this post. 
---
**What about X47**
---
There’s been a few legit super fights happen in the past year. Since a big part of my case is how the supercap meta makes it so we never get fights, I’ll take some time to talk about this.  
---
The biggest argument here is that there still aren’t *enough* super fights to provide a healthy level of content, and with supers in their current state, no non-super fights matter much. The “biggest war in Eve’s history” boiled down to 2 fights (one in the north, one in the south; most people were only in one of these). The entire northern war boiled down to the first X47 keepstar fight; if you were in goons, you spent like 2 years mining for that one nine-hour tidi fest. Nothing else mattered; that’s the only one you needed to show up for. That’s just not enough strategic conflict to keep the game alive. 
---
X47 ended the war in a way that was disappointing for a lot of people. There was no sense fighting over any of the keepstar losses, the biggest infrastructure losses in Eve’s history, because the north had lost the only fight that mattered. There’s a lot of fights we *could* have had that we *didn’t* get because the supercap meta made everything else irrelevant. 
---
The other line of argument here is to remember that just because super fights can happen now, doesn’t mean they *wouldn’t* happen if fax were removed. Supers would still be powerful, high-risk/high-reward tools in strategic fights. You’d be more likely to lose them, but the downsides of losing them would be much smaller, meaning you can still deploy them as needed. 
---
Finally, remember that supers+fax are too good at suppressing nonstrategic content. If fax were nerfed we’d have a lot more options in the smallgang/blops/whaling vein that would improve the game overall. 
---
**Won’t this end big fights?**
---
A max dread fleet from Imperium+test would be like 2500 dreads. Even with cheap fits/plat insurance that’s 2.5t in potential losses, before anyone reships. It’s pretty big – but it’s not the end of the world if you lose one of these. 
---
**Isn’t it against the spirit of Eve if people can’t risk everything in one fight?**
---
It’s not the option of it that I’m against, it’s the *requirement* that you risk everything if you want to matter in a fight. If the other side has supercaps, you either pack your own (and risk everything) or you don’t bother showing up; this is the single biggest content-suppression mechanic in the game atm. 
---
**If you remove the titan problem, it’ll just become a dread problem! Then a battleship problem!**
---
**I’m not proposing a solution to apex forces.** We’re probably never getting that (although dreads are far more balanced, since you can fight them with smaller ships, with longer-ranged ships, and with bigger ships if you’re willing to drop titans; titans can only be countered with titans). I’m proposing a solution to the apex force being something too expensive for an alliance to fight in. 
---
**People will still be risk averse**
---
Yes, but even risk-averse pilots will take more risks with cheaper ships. 
---
A lot of the risks in big fights are determined by alliance leaders and FCs, who may be willing to put a lot on the table (few bigtime bloc FCs get there without a few bigtime welps). These people might take risks with 500b that they wouldn’t with 20tril, because they know they can survive a 500b loss. 
---
There’s also other concerns that take over once the downside risk of losing a fight is mitigated. If you ask 1000 nerds to form up for your fleet, you might be willing to take a fight where you think you have a 50/50 chance of winning (and know you’ll get some good kills in if you lose), just because you don’t want to disappoint them and suffer a morale blow from retreating. But you probably wouldn’t take that fight if you knew that losing would cost you everything. 
---
It was too late right ? that was a gem, gems shouldnt be deleted.

That goofy cyberpunk shit is what makes eve awesome, and every time a stripper pole gets taken off a Minmatar station the game gets a little worse.

Can a highsec citadel fire on Concord ships?

given the companies he owns, he would clearly be running a jump freighter service with a few hundred PI alts on the side to produce his electric cars.

I ended up in a WH corp 15 days into playing the game. The learning curve was brutal.

Literally all of Omist docks up within 10 minutes of a neut hitting local in any any system, but sure Legacy totally isn't protecting botters. At least we kick ours.
---
Goodposting doesn’t pay my sub, okay? 
---
Wormhole groups aren't quite as big as nullblocks, doctrines tend to be a bit more specialized and a bit more blingy, and evicting someone's hole is somewhat of a campaign if they have multiple citadels, capital ships, and an active player base.
---
This is great
---
And people say r/eve is useless.
---
Fools.
---
Nope, gotta get out there and shoot survey probes yourself. 
---
Why would it? The quick bar is a thing. Whoever uses the neocom in full anyway? 
---
If supers can't get reps and die to a dread bomb, nobody will use them.
---
People will sell their supers and buy titans/carrier instead, and just never use supers for anything but ratting and bashing in extremely safe space.
---
You got one part wrong in your possible work-arounds.  There’s a high chance that the sell order in Jita is not the same character as the buy order in dodixie.  Assume everyone has more alts than you know of.
---
The scammer keeps that alt in dodixie with a Oisk balance to make this scam less risky for the scammer.  Buying/selling simultaneously won’t work in that example.
---
Trump needs to shut the government down again so I don’t miss this shit.

Omg yes !!! Cant wait but we should figure out cloning first 
---
5 star general for the space force 
---
I use supers to mean supercaps, including titans
---
but yes, that's sort of *the point* - this is a soft way to remove supers (removing them from their post at the top of the strategic meta, without going through the hoops of actually taking them out of the game). 
---
Not every post has to be personally interesting to you m9
---
Nice little side project for someone, I'm sure. Having said that: do people ever use the neocom in full instead of the quick access bar and key bindings? Surely not unless they need to access a feature they hardly ever use...? 
---
you literally expect anyone to believe that?
---
Proof? Why talk to FRT/Skillu. This thread is about KWG botting empire paying ISK which funds legacy coalition. Quality projection onto your enemies there.
---
Yeah I didn't think of that, makes sense.
---
It depends really, if you're day tripping and happen to stumble upon a c3 WH or one with a c3 static then yeah it's nice depending on the sites and the effect. 
---
It is really annoying seeing this scams pop up in my spreadsheets continually and is just cheating noobs of their money. There are definitely other ways to scam the market than this.
---
Lol nicely done!
---
There are. Are you going to cry about removing them too?
---
I don't think the prices of some random dude running a JF for some no name renter corp is personally interesting to anyone. 
---
this thread is now about skillu/FRT protecting botters who pay them. go make your own thread.

Its not like there isn't a thread at least once a month about botters in fountain where its pointed out we've kicked another botting corp.

Most smaller groups do struggle, but if you are up to it, join small and grow with them. Or sell out and join a larger group who does what you are asking anyways. You will find alot of a wormhole groups content comes from null, Hawks and HK are still very much wh corps. 
---
Thats fair.
---
No, but if you put a buy order in on margin in any other context and it was filled, you would owe money. You would have a negative balance in your account. Margin buying in EVE makes no practical sense if there isn't a concept of debt or negative balance.
---
Ghostriding is also totally useless, just use a rorq, you get an even higher range(not that it matters) and a fuckton more tank, on top of aids reductions and the ability to extract really easy. Ghostriding is just plain stupid.
---

---
I do however care more when someone doesn’t do ochre first .. that shit is my new trigger 😝
---
Show me on the puppet where the goon pets touched you.
---
I'm not making a case for it just explaining how it works. Before the rorq changes it had a place but after there is many situations where a ghost riding is better. I suppose the only time it would be better than a rorq would be trying to get tackle on a titan. A rorq cant fit enough points of scram to hold a titan down while a hic can.
---
How about you take a stand against botting within your regions?

I mean, back when moons were worth fighting over didn’t 90% of the game blue each other to make sure they could control the market for moon goo?

INIT caps can be baited out and killed but they respond fairly quickly even when unprepared so it’s a suicide op either way. I don’t think we’ve been ISK positive when going cap vs cap against them but it’s been fun nonetheless. Hopefully they enjoy it too.
---
If there continue to need to be posts about rampant botting in fountain, are you really succeeding?
---
Ive seen this scam on contracts with officer resist mods. Basically contract sells them at lower then the best buy orders, so naturally seems like a quick flip. 
---
Honestly, the only thing out of line here is the 5% of collateral.   1-2% is standard in every alliance I've been in, but it's not that big of a deal if there aren't a whole lot of JF pilots/don't have money to eat oopsies.  OT is retarded.

Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system.

---
This probably took one dev two days to implement and test, it's really not a big deal. Dev blogs come from marketing.
---
Almost like the state of the game is reflected by the media surrounding it.
---
You want interesting things to be talked about on reddit, well then there needs to be interesting things happening in game.
---
The current game environment/meta/whatever just doesn't promote exciting content.
---
Realistically 'end game' content lacks diversity and any kind of excitement. You've got: Rorq mine, super rat, jump titan into 95% and high isk market trading.
---
Maybe if small roaming gangs didn't get shat on by magically appearing caps there would be more fun. Unpopular opinion, I know.
---
This^
---
Only way to kind of get around it is to sell one by one until the money runs out. 
---
Buy order is for 13 @ 62m, only having to put 23% up, which is around 185 mil and change. 
---
So you could sell 3 at a time, and just kind of ruin his scam slowly. 
---
Wish I had read this before posting. I basically parroted you. A sad state that the game is in.
---
No.  Safety is permanently set to green.
---
I have fallen for this scam.
---
 Thankfully it was only like 100mil.
---
I evemailed the guy congratulating in good humor.
---
He took this message and gave me a "fuck you."
---
I thought it was hilarious when I fell for it... I'm sure he's used to people being super pissed and just sending angry evemails.
---
Tl:dr: took this scam in good humor, disappointed with the attitude of the scammer. 10/10 would fall for again if scammer had a good attitude.
---
Can i see the fit?
---
&gt; Supers are now the best answer to literally any problem you might encounter, except tidi fights, in which case you bring titans.

The interaction between supers and rorquals is what propels the "blue everyone and mine all day so you can win one titan brawl in 2024" meta.

---
My experience, which was in lowsec, right before they changed moons was fighting over them nearly every day. Either we or the peopl were were fighting would ref a couple moons to create timers for the weekend.

I'm sure that wasn't the case for everyone. Krabs will always find a reason to blue up everyone and their mother. But at least moons weren't cancer to fight over for those who actually wanted to fight.

This isn't fleecing. This isn't even close to fleecing. Not every small group in the game is going to have the Imperiums logistical power and/or infrastructure. The 5% only makes sense if it's for orders with collateral, even if it is a bit high. It's pretty obvious you've never ran any of these services or any kind of group before.

Margin trading scams have been around for ages, and in my opinion aren't that bad/broken. Just use common sense and look at the previous market history. From that it's quite easy to determine what is going on. Enjoy your new found knowledge of a common scam in eve :)
---
I'll rephrase: I believe dread is cheaper to lose because of insurance mechanics. Insurance payout is baced on cost of minerals required to build a ship. Marauders are T2 hulls and used minerals is just a small part of production cost, that's why insurance payout for them is relatively small. On the other hand, dreads are T1 hulls and built entirely from minerals, that's why insurance could bring you back major fraction of the hull cost.
---
It's always cost relative.  
---
You get a little improvement going Gecko or subverted but add rather a lot of exposure cost wise. If you are using T2 modules, stick with heavies - geckos cost more than your fit, and subverted drones cost more than your fit+ship.  
---
If you are using faction/deadspace/abyssal and regularly say things like #nopoors, well you are a already using the good stuff and don't need to ask r/eve.
---
Don't get links and routes mixed up.  Links are the roads.  Routes are the directions to move stuff from a to b.  You can have things all linked together but unless you give the drivers a route nothing moves.
---
I mean you're not wrong, this is pretty radical - but more than 30% of the playerbase thinks the current meta sucks, and a lot of titan pilots are disappointed because their titans already never get real content anyway. 
---
We literally just had one of the biggest wars in years last summer, wtf is this narrative.
---
The only problem with this is if they have the minimum buy order set to the total wanting to be bought. So if min is 13, you can't sell individually. Which, I would assume this guy did unless he's new to scamming.
---
Cry me a river mate
---
I disagree 
---
1. Assaults are subpar compared to heavies due to their application and short range, you'll waste a lot of time and tank on getting into range
---
2. you should be cloaky, T3Cs aren't that powerful compared to their costs and are a highly desired target. Swap the Amplif node with a Covert config. Put an extended probe launcher in the extra highslot, it will take almost no CPU due to ship bonus.
---
3. Fill the low with Ballistics, dragging out kill time per rat only puts you at a greater risk
---
4. Use Republic Fleet CB, it's cheaper. Abyssal shield boosters also can be cheaper than Deadspaces and oftentimes they provide enough tank
---
5. You will rather want 1 invuln and 1 EM shield resist. Get rid of your MSEs. This will leave you with 1 empty mid to use as a wildcard : Put an SBA for PvE, and a point / scram for PvP.
---
6. IMO CDFE and CCC doesn't really do much. Get another damage or application mod (Rigor II works well). You won't need a whole lot of cap since you will be pulsing your SB.
---
7. If you really need extra tank get 2 Invulns and a T2 EM rig
---

Yeah, re-entering null from highsec is a classic trap.  Stay in highsec and dock up (in the case of war targets) or re-enter null with help of a scout.  Better idea is to have a ratting ship in highsec and one in null and travel back and forth in a nullified insta-warp interceptor (with a little tank added for good measure).  Gl.

Now some advice, hams are the superior weapon. Keep some javelin for when you're closing but realistically with how close the spawns are you'll use rage most of the time. You can also drop the tp for a ballistic computer and get more range if you want that.
---
As for finding and running the sites, day tripping is fine. You'll have a rougher time finding c3s based out of null but they'll stioo exist. Might have to scan the chain some. Bring a depot and swap to cloaky nully when you're not in site. Never leave your depot up between refits. That's asking for someone to wait there for you.

Beyond that, prioritize neuts, crystals and blue pill might save you some grief, and keep that ab on at all times. 
---
Sinner's Trajectory! We are smaller compared to some of the bigger corps but we pack a punch and live in C5 space! hit us up Sinner's pub channel on eve.
---
If you want some quick excitement I have found going cloaky into wormholes for some solo pvp to be extremely fun. The sense of exploration and hunt for red October suspense is great. Try that out for a bit if null sec politics dont tickle your grundle 
---
I will type slow so you understand.
---
If you remove local, there will be no where to type.  Also, how would you know someone is there to talk to even if it were like WH space? 
---
I understand that you want the entire game to cater to your silly playstyle, but you are the extreme minority.  THAT is the reason why we should keep local.  For no other reason than we should not cater to whiny little kids who don't have a clue.
---
There's absolutely no reason to be cloaky in site. You will never tank with the cloaky sub. You need the active tank boost.
---
And heavies suck. Hams provide better application and damage. The tengu actually has excellent range when combined with javelin for when you're closing. Plus if you know the site you'll always be near the new wave spawn. 
---
amen
---
sharex or the likes will give you an imgur link and region capture
---
My offer is 100% legitimate. I'm getting sick and tired of LSH and BL thinking all they have to do is hit something with a big enough hammer rather than using some finesse. 
---
I had the same buy back when I ran a rental corp. Because i used the buyback to tax the minors at the same rate as the ratters.  It funded the 20b a month payment, and POS structures., fuel and give away ships. 
---
When i closed the corp i think i MAYBE  walked away with 5b. And had payed out over 120b to the rental allliance and bought moved snd shjped something close to a trillon isk worth. 
---
Join All-Out
---
You should probably keep that one to yourself next time. Just sayin'
---
I ran all C3s before and Cloaky subsystem provided enough tank.
---
Fury HM : 95m/s, 154m
---
Javenins have 39km range, almost half of Heavies, and actually has less dps compared to Furies.
---
idk you might be right, but HAMs dodn’t really provide a good result in my personal experience
---
I'm not sure what fit you were running but I've done hundreds of the fuckers and if I'd been cloaky I would have died.
---
Damage number doesn't matter if you don't consider application. Plus you'll be spending most of your time in rage missile range which both put damages and out applies to the sleepers. 
---
You mentioned Republic fleet security missions.  Are you a member of FW?
---
Looking at the photos I see what they are going for. Well at least the logic of trying to streamline it. I FUCKING HATE IT WITH A BURNING PASSION. But I can see how all the extra shit is confusing to new bros... really playing with their cards face up keeping the plex vault and new eden store separate though. Really need that on my bar opposed to my fucking wallet obviously ...
---
Did it twice last week and it was fine.  LML Crow.
---
We just had a galaxy wide war, a highsec brushfire war a few jumps from jita that changed the landscape of plexiglas and tax haven trading. Which is still going on btw. Eve events come in waves right now we are coming to the end of a down period.
---
I was in the same boat-ish but I have 2 new characters(one missile/one lasers).  I did some last hauls. I contracted my shit to Jita 4-4. Extracted my character (was 27mil sp). And sold all that sweet sp for massive isk on market. Now I'm space rich and I can buy whatevah I wahnt!
---
Can I see your fit?
---
Mine is : 
---
6x Heavies, 1x CovOps cloak, 1x extended probe
---
10mn AB II, Abyssal LSB, T2 Invuln, T2 EM, RF LCB, Glycerine SBA
---
3x BCS
---
ACR I, POU I, Rigor II
---
We're kind of in between shit right now, so it's relatively quiet. 
---
Ruskies don't have eyes apparently so their smiley is just a ), with more )))) denoting more...smileyness... Thus the answer is to just smile at them when they rage
---
I posted it in this thread. I think i see the difference, that being a rigor rig and the fact that you're running an abyssal large booster. My fit predates multiplasmids, and I'm not convinced by the cap stability here. Regardless while the cap lasts I can see why you'd tank. 
---
We do bro we really enjoy it. Init member btw!!
---
Before the Abyssals I used a Pith B-type.
---
I am cap stable in 28% but isn’t really important since I’m not just running my SB nonstop.
---
That wasn't WWB. WWB was Goons vs the rest of Eve.
---
This is useless to me, thank you. 
---
Rivalry?  ok, I'll touch on one that I am only slightly involved in at the group level.  Then I'll mention one that is personal.
---
WARNING: this post is more than 140 characters long, so the two whole paragraphs below constitute the text equivalent of the Great Wall of China.
---
Goons vs Circle of Two
---
Most of the drama that occurred happened before I knew Eve existed.  Each side has their own story, and disagree on most of the main points.  Short story long, Circle of Two (Co2) used to be part of Goons, they split during the Casino war (World War Bee to non Goons).  There was much in the way of ill will as a result of this and there was never a hope of reconciliation.  Fast forward to when I had been playing a bit, and the Judge (Co2 diplomat) awoxed Co2 as a whole, stole tons of stuff/isk.  The Co2 leader lost his cool, made physical threats of violence, and made attempts to track down the Judge IRL.  The Judge later joined Goons, and the "As the Spod Turns" soap opera continues.  Please note I have grossly over simplified these events, and skipped nearly all of the details.  I am also not impartial (Goon BTW) so take this with a grain of salt.  Doing your own research on these events would serve you best as a result.
---
Personal:
---
I'm going to start this out with a statement of fact.  If I ever meet this person in real life, I'm buying them a drink and shaking their hand.  This is in game only.  When I was more of a newb than I am now, Dartillius blew up my ship when I was trying PI.  Now, I was in an unarmed t1 industrial with crap tank and made a litany of mistakes too long to list.  He taught me a lot in that one kill, lessons that have saved countless ships.  Huge benefit to me in the long term, in the short term it was a financial hardship.  Now whenever I see him in my space I drop everything to hunt/harass him without mercy - as a professional courtesy.
---
TL;DR:
---
People play Eve, stuff happened.
---
Oh I misread LCB. Yeah that'd do it. I mean I still don't like the heavies, but I can see why the fit works. Trade offs and what have you. The beauty of eve I guess, multiple ways to accomplish a task even with the same hull. 
---
There was only one fight in it that mattered, wasn't very satisfying. 
---
LOL 
---
Contest the field?  
---
Their comp is clearly get in kill some shit move on. 
---
"Отдайте Крым Украине" = "return Crimea back to Ukraine"  
---
that's one blurry jpeg
---
It was already done :-)
---
not much of a war honestly....was mostly just waiting for timers.  or having one side dock when they didn't have an advantage
---
and "biggest"   in numbers maybe.  in total battles, fights, ferocity.  not even close. it was forgettable enough(both in what happened and end result) that honestly...nothing much changed unless your co2
---
I think the slow one is you. I've said time and time again I'm speaking of local that doesn't show who is in system. There is a number that shows total amounts of people but not who they are. You can still use local. It just doesn't show who is there unless they type.  
---
Do I need to get crayons and paper for you?
---
That’s literally what wars in EVE are. There’s a few major spikes, but otherwise it’s a lot of grinding and positioning to try and get that advantage. It is very notable that we had 3 major super fleet on super fleet fights with mass titan death, because it means that 3 times, both sides thought they had a fair shot at winning. That happens so very rarely it’s unbelievable. 
---
Tesla's old Death Ray retasked… Nobody would ever expect a super secret super-villian
---
What’s the advantage of having it 64bit?
---
This doesnt make a lot of sense in any way. Cobalt edge is dead end and no strategic value for pan fam. If anything i feel theran would be better in parts of kalevala. Also leaving Winter is questionable as they are a steadily growing coalition. Will be interesting if this is legit and see how it plays out

---
Yes, guy's, 2019, let's remove EVE Online end game it's the way to go
---
These dreads were prolly 500mil after insurance.  I would be more impressed if this was a fleet of caracals or another t1 cruiser comp, they're much more rare in 2019 eve than a bunch of dreads and titans.
---
Not your dreads though
---
I found the salt!
---
I mean the endgame is still there, it's just not invincible anymore; it's not great for titans to only be counterable by more titans
---
also a lot of people unironically stay in the game because of their daily t1 gatecamp frags, not because they got in one big fight in 2014 and another in 2019. I'm not really down for krabbing until 2022 for our next decent cap brawl. 
---
This is important.  It took me forever to get a Dodixie insta-undock BM that worked with all my ships. The center of the undock is always perpendicular to the plane of of the undock portal.  As mentioned above, 3rd person view will help a lot checking the BM.  Also, your ship will not bump until the 30 second undock invulnerability timer ends (unless you move/navigate, ie initiate warp) so if you undock something and see a mackariel on the undock just wait until your ship passes by to warp.  Just be sure not to exit the stations docking perimeter or you will not be able to re-dock immediately.  I know Amar, Jita and Dodixie are not "kickout" stations.  I am not sure about rens/hek/stacmon.  There are no NPC stations in Perimeter and no citadels have kick out undocks so you are safe from that there too.
---
k
---
Okay
---
&gt;What if everyone just grew some balls?
---
Not realistic; not enough people will do it, and the people who don’t do it will end up running the game. It’s also not fair to ask people to put that much work in and then deliberately gimp their playstyle for the sake of ‘gudfites’, risking losing to paper-pushers who play optimally.
---
Have you heard the story of that nullsec coalition who decide to attack another coalition with less titan/super/fax ? They deploy near their enemy space and start to target major assets, sadly they were dodging every fight by using cyno jammer, but at some point, a super/titan brawl happened, they were outnumber and fighting their enemy territory right on their own staging, after an easy win with the shield timer because the enemy did not ~~had balls~~ form up but the armor time was here, their enemy were ready to go all in, outnumber, the smaller coalition went balls deep, at the beginning they were losing but as the battle was kicking out spai report "This alliance is telling to their member to dock up they don't want to lose shit" some dank leaks even came to everyone heard "They just ask to hide the faction titan/supers".. After some hour of fight, the armor timer was won from the smaller coalition. I'm too tired to explain the hull timer, but the smaller coalition won again, losing only 1 titan this time.. Why ? Because this time the bigger coalition did not had enough balls to fully fight the smaller coalition.
---
This is the story of X47, the smaller coalition is The Imperium who fought the northern guys outnumber by 200 in their enemy territory they won because their enemy were coward. If you want to fight the imperium, stop trying to find pathetic hotfix who fix nothing and just fuck other people playstyle (hello wh guys). Next time The Imperium will deploy (because the other way will never happen the north don't have enough balls) stop hiding, stop tethering, stop docking, fight and fix the problem by playing the game, not shit talking on reddit 
---
That had been slowburning for almost a year beforehand...
---
wtf i love dinoposters now.
---
Rumours says they fucked up and had to leave.
---
what the christ
---
you know the imperium had like 150 more titans and gazillions more dudes in that fight right
---
It seems to me like your ACTUAL solution is just to "remove Supercaps and Titans from the game."   
---
You are just going the FAX route because you know you wouldn't get a single up vote otherwise.   
---
All your suggestion does is turn Titans into Bridge Machines and Supers into Turbo Krab Ratters.   
---
How about we just reduce the effective reps something receives based on its mass, reducing the amount of FAX you have to kill before you can start calling primaries on supers / carriers? Allowing fax to be useful for subs / normal caps while having reduce effect on big things.   
---
Too outnumbered. Did see that you still managed to lose 30bill in caps. gj

---
A lot of titan pilot stay in the game bashing T1 gatecamp because it's the only thing their enemy have to offer, and if we do so, it's because we wait the next big battle, why would you spend hundred hours of grinding if it's to never use the ship ? Nice you have it dock in a keepstar waiting for a big battle next ? Do you understand supercap brawl is a good material sink ? If super/titan were dying more often, we would see their price up and so, increasing their price, making them less accessible, instead you want to make them useless and removing one of the major material sink, check big battle economic report and a 10 guy in T1 frigate dying, one have a real impact in the game, the other one do nothing

Good thing you brought test to make it even huh
---
Somebody pooped on your desk.
---
It more or less breaks the laws of economics and finance, which I believe are a fundamental part of EVE (at least one of the reasons I got into EVE). Buying on margin is essentially borrowing money, and since there is no concept of borrowing or debt in EVE, I don't think it should be part of the game.
---
What if you could do this with courier contracts? You only have to put up 23% of the collateral when you're hauling and then empty your account. If you get ganked, oh well, then the person who put up the contract only gets 23% of the collateral they put. That's what margin is but for the market.
---
Depends on how stable your null home is.
---
Daytripping C3s can make 200-300m/hr if you base out of a lowsec system and have a few domi alts or a single passive rattle.

as if you guys do not call in allies?

---
OK pet.
---
did you forget how the last molok kill attempt went
---
It's the EVE that was always going to happen.
---
I haven't seen a competitive sandbox game yet where the optimal strategy wasn't N+1, and EVE wasn't the only one I've played.
---
Of course, just dont get butthurt that the north didnt fight into 2:1 odds when you bring half the map to RF 1 structure. You clearly had fun though judging by the PH level of your post.  
---
 ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

WHy didn't they jUst adaPt...
---
Lmao, implying you guys didn't have NC and PL along as well. They only brought along what, 100 or so caps and about as many eagles?
---
Juts type some or any of the following or alike in local chat:
---
"sorry guys, I don't speak or understand Chechnyan."
---
" lo siento, yo no habla aleman"
---
And if they write something in Russian to you, reply with the following:
---
" lo siento, no soy egypcio, no entiendo jeroglificos."
---
I'm sure they will appreciate all this very very much and have a better day because they will know you care.

where is that implied?
---
Good attempts
---
They not only empty their wallet, but also sell to their buy order to zero out the 23% of the ISK stuck in escrow. Check the market history for the item. What you see in the market is an empty shell of a buy order.

---
The date on that shows today. 
---
Pretty much. [(Except I would also disagree with removing supercaps outright, they're cool to have in game and some people make great use of them in smaller-scale scenarios.)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZv7Km-4N1w&amp;t=606s)
---
Making supers immune/highly resistant to reps is totally reasonable. It just has to be actual near-immunity, not the 10% reduction CCP will come back with in 9 months.
---
Fax are pretty badly balanced in the subcap game too, though, but with the right balance pass could provide a useful advantage to carrier/battleship fleets to reduce the primacy of dreads.

I think you misspelled "secondhand slaves".

ok, so i'm not reading OP's wall of text to see if it was addressed, but the smart way you margin trade scam is you run some other buy orders to eat up all the escrow so people cant actually sell a few units to your scam buy order.

Wicked Creek is a crazy long route, 1300/m3 is definitely competitive. When we were living there up to 2016 there was so little competition on the route because no one wanted to deal with all the cynos. I made a ton of money JFing then.

Mechanically, gameplay wise, Triglavian ships are most fun in the game. By huge leaps and bounds. they are ISK inefficient, not bets suited ofr a lot of stuff, but they are actually fun to fly and play with, unlike the efficient ships and fits.

You can run level 1 and 2 Abyss in VNI relatively easy. Level 3 Abyss in a full T2 well skilled VNI, level 4 Electrical and Fire in a blinged out fully trained VNI, but at that point you will already have better options then a VNI, but its perfectly doable for a decent farm and breaks the monotony a lot.
---
Train for Gila dude, VNI, Gila, then Rattlesnake, that's the PvE path. You can side train into a Tengu for some explo, scanning and various shenanigans. But in the meanwhile, with low SP unfortunately your options are limited. 
---
Maybe ask in your corp / alliance what are their doctrines for frigates for PvP. Frigates take a relatively short time to train into and if you can get decent at one type of them and be able to PvP in it since they are super cheap to lose, it will liven things up a bit. But ... caps .... 1 shot from any will kill you, at least until down theroad quite a bit until you know what you're doing and have the skills / fit for it.
---
 
---
like higher quality balls? are they shinier? 
---
I know the reddit narrative is to pretend since The Imperium have 1 major alliance : Goons with over 35k character we all pretend The Imperium is the biggest coalition with the most active people in eve, but truth is, it's not, yes The Imperium is big, but northern relationship is far bigger.

Eve's sandbox has some extra-special elements, though; the scale of the relevant N+1 (titans, which can take months to grind), plus persistent world and permadeath of ships. 
---
In any other MMO, if you're in an N+1 war and your N is about equal to the enemy N, you can take a fight on roughly even terms, and if you lose, you can come back next week for another round. This is content. It's fun. 
---
In Eve, you'd be coming back many months later, and the other side has been grinding the whole time too, so they're now far ahead of you. If you lose the fight, you risk a massive, permanent setback in a years-long arms race. It's possible you'll never recover. (Ask if GotG/NC/PL will ever have a supercap fleet to rival the Imperium's after X47; their only hope is to turtle up in the dronelands with a gigantic chinese botting empire for about a year.) 
---
This is the dark side of "real consequences for losing" - sometimes those consequences can be a little *too* severe.

---
Your idea functionally removes titans/supers from the end game meta. I don't think CCP would ever do that. I think that supers are horribly imbalanced but making them worthless is not the right option. The risk reward ratio needs to be adjusted though. 
---
CCP needs to do a real nerf to fax reps and an even stronger nerf to fax ehp. I think if a fax sieges with a 100 man cruiser fleet on grid it should be easily killable by said fleet, keep in mind these things are typically only a 2bil ship with  great insurance. To do this I would nerf localized reps by 1/3 and ehp by 1/2 and increase the siege cycle by a bit. 
---
By making fax still usable but far more killable supers and titans become slightly more engageable and killable. Also fuck Bosons that shit needs a big nerf or to betaken out of the game entirely, all it does is oppress smaller groups and eliminates good content from the game.  
---

I know some people in Test from wayyyyy back, so when i got back into the game I did my own thang for a year or two, then when I was ready to jump into the frey again I wanted to join Test cause they're the only group around that seems derpy enough for em and I wanted to derp with them.
---
But then that whole shit went down and they became goonpets or are on their way of doing so if not yet completely, and I just can't bring myself to this kinda shit. that is just too low even for me.

You get SRP'd in 3d printed turds?
---
If you have a decent amount of cash and want to get into missions/ratting, I would recommend leaving your stuff wherever it is at the moment and settling in a new home. Is there are particular corp/faction that you have higher standings with? If so, search for them on Dotlan, click on Agents, and then look at your options in terms of type of agent, level of agent, and area of space. If not, choose a corp to build standings with, and consider running distribution missions to grind that up.
---
There are areas of NPC nullsec that are quite good for both mission running and ratting, although the anomalies won't be as plentiful, and you need to be reasonably comfortable with operating there alone. Ratting in hisec/lowsec is going to feel like a serious downgrade for you in terms of ISK generation. If you're able to fly any type of incursion ship, you might want to try some Warp To Me (or any other incursion group) fleets for your ratting pleasure. Setup a jump clone back at whatever missioning base you choose for when the incursion fleets are down, and alternate between activities as you please. Keep in mind that if you create your own corporation, you can set the tax rate to 0% and keep more of your earnings.
---
I thought long and hard about whether to post this after those - after all, we're clearly still getting content in the age of super dominance, right?
---
The stuff in the Q&amp;A section about X47 pretty much still sums up my point. If you got into a titan in 2012, you've probably used it in 2 real titan vs. titan brawls - B-R and one of UALX, X47 or that thing with tri vs. the russians. 
---
That's just not a whole ton of content. It'd be one thing if we were getting loads of normal smallgang, large-fleet and capital content *in addition* to a big titan fight every year. But the mere existence of titans makes that much harder, because there's no point showing up in subcaps or capitals unless you're also ready to kick off the year's titan fight. So we don't get a whole lot of extra content, especially strategic content, except for these occasional big brawls. 
---
It's just not worth it - especially since we could probably get *more* big brawls if dreads were the main sovereignty powerhouse. 
---
Also, the 9-4 keepstar shitshow *proves* my point, and is one of the biggest reasons I wrote this mess. I'm still bitter about it - both sides formed up like 9000 nerds and maxhurfed the shit out of the op, but in the end, nobody committed. [We were all super bitter about it at the time](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/7sjple/nice_one_million_dollar_fight_ahahahaha/), and I'm still mad about it now. We could have had a good fight, we should have had a good brawl, but we didn't. Why? 
---
A bit part of the answer is that people won't commit on a 50% (or something like that) chance of winning a fight, because the downside risks are total and catastrophic. If the downside risks weren't so bad (like merely 2000 dreadnoughts) then we could commit to fights like that more often. 
---
shhh PL are dead.
---
No we didnt. NC, PL, horde, darkness, etc had more titans combined. The way their side played the diplomatic game and organized the coalition since they evicted is from the north lost them that fight along with how they fought it. Several of their allies droppes their titans out of range, they were spread out over several comm channels with bad coordination
---
yet here you are

That's how pretty much every other war in EVE history worked too.

What is FW space and what is a FAX?

If the Goons in this screenshot send me an in game mail, I'll reimburse the losses and please accept corp apologies. Sue sometimes thinks Eve is NPSI. He shoots corp when we're not in fleet, too. Apologies. 
---
Kill said structure and considering we brought 0 caps to that timer yeah
---
Lot of people in this thread talking about null sec rivalries, but there are some good ones in low. Perhaps the most notable was the Shadow Cartel Snuffed Out one. I saw was because although both groups still exist and hate each other there is not exactly a strength parity. In any case for a long while SC and SNUFF were roughly equal and the two largest groups in low, and constantly tried to one up the other. 
---
buy lo sell hi. The Chinese motto.
---
The other ones I played also had nasty consequences for slowing down and falling behind.
---
If the game were allowed to run long enough, I get this suspicion that, after it got really boring and Goons "won", the social orders of the game would break down as people went their separate ways, and instability would be reintroduced because the dominant players got bored of having nobody to fight.  Considering the sheer scale of Goons, though, that would take.... a while.
---
Other, more realistic (though maybe not fun) mechanics would be for everything existing to diminish in power/value over a half-life, so this unassailable wealth thing isn't forever.  This could be by massive resource inflation, or by a degradation mechanic where stuff just randomly needs ever more expensive repairs before it can be put into service, or reprocessing for materials, or just shrinking piles for raw materials.  That might be what they tried to do with Rorqals, injectors, and the insane anom fountains in null.  The other problem you run into with that is burnout, though: EVE's farming mechanics generate stuff roughly linearly for time and effort applied as long as there are resources, which is why grinding/botting 14+ hours/day is a thing.
---
Why do people still use this spamad ridden piece of garbage website
---
It's the only thing he's good at
---
Aside from botting osrs
---
&gt;at honestly...nothing much changed unless your co2
---
And will likely never happen again if the meta persists. Imperium/Test outproduce NC/PL by a factor of 10 and outnumber them 2 to 1. They will never again engage toe to toe on a fight of that scale. 
---
So if anyone wants a game worth playing a year from now something has to change. 
---
Also its sad if that's what you think wars in eve are and have to be. There were much more enjoyable wars that involved heavy day to day fighting using a mix of subcaps and caps like TRI vs XIX. But if you are part of a mega blob you will never have the chance to experience that. 
---
Have dead bees send me an in game mail and corp will reimburse. Sorry.
---
reddit doesn't require you to play the game
---
In theory a 50% nerf to fax rep output might suffice today, but in reality it'll just lead to people bringing twice as much fax tomorrow. (As long as the optimal strategy is to punch yourself in the balls to win, people will do it - and if you make the optimal strategy "punch yourself in the balls twice as much to win" people will *still do it*, they'll just bitch on reddit more about how much their balls ache.) 
---
The change has to be so severe that there's no *possible option* to use a modern-style "invincible titan apex force" fleet. A 95% nerf to reps on supers might do it, but that might also lead to alliances bringing fleets of 1k fax and 3,000 guardians to back up 300 titans. I'd prefer straight-up rep immunity to take options like that off the table.

1955 EVE: 317 Imperium titans vs 252 Northern titans on grid, following another wave of Imperium reinforcements as of 1952 EVE.

I was wrong, we only had like 60 more. Depends on when during the fight you pick, but the imperium did *not* win X47 with a weaker supercapital force.

sieg
---
The output matters less than their ehp imo though I am proposing to nerf both. Functionally most engagements will require the fax to die before going for titans/supers. By making the fax more vulnerable to the point sub caps can kill them in reasonable time you accomplish several things. 
---
1. Makes subcaps more useful. 
---
2. Makes it more costly for the super/titans in any engagement as they are more likely to lose their rep support. 
---
3. It makes dreads much more useful as fax killing machines in larger engagements. 
---

&gt; A lot of titan pilot stay in the game bashing T1 gatecamp because it's  the only thing their enemy have to offer, and if we do so, it's because  we wait the next big battle, why would you spend hundred hours of  grinding if it's to never use the ship ?   
---
\-Alternatively, why would someone offer to fight with a super or titan unless they're incredibly confident they can either A) escape or B) win. As you said, nobody wants to see their hundreds of hours of grinding go up in smoke or gather dust for no reason.
---
&gt;  
---
Do you understand supercap  brawl is a good material sink ? If super/titan were dying more often, we  would see their price up and so, increasing their price, making them  less accessible, instead you want to make them useless and removing one  of the major material sink, check big battle economic report and a 10  guy in T1 frigate dying, one have a real impact in the game, the other  one do nothing.  
---
\- If the only content people who bring small 10 man gangs to your space get is a super or BFG, you suddenly have little to no content. Then you get bored because of said content moving away. Super caps aren't everyone's endgame, and if everyone was in a super then they'd be worthless. So why bother spending the hundreds of hours grinding in the first place?   
---
Either way you look at it, the supercap is devalued as an asset, reward, and goal simultaneously.
---
You should of read all the mails, then you would know that they are actually leaving in good terms..

Great job disproving the TEST/Goons pets narrative, by the way.

yea my argument on this is the problem is superfleets are the only fleet that matters, and they're only good for 1 fight
---
if we did this all in dreads we could get 6-10 real good punchups in before someone went down for the count
---
I will check that sub out, thank you.
---
And everyone bitches about supers and titans like they forgot the days of supers and carriers dropping thousands of sentries and assigning them to a brick tanked T3 they were all pre-locking and repping while it just deleted entire sub cap fleets in the time it took to lock a ship and cycle the guns  or how much fun it was to be on grid in a subcap during the days of tracking titans. People are always going to bitch about everything they change.
---
So do you guys not have caps or something?
---
😂 I know this is what everyone would expect a spy to say, but I'm not a spy. I'm just a player who's had an unusual time with the game and now is pigeonholed literally on the other side of the planet.

---
People said the EXACT same thing about PL and company following the B-R fight and they cam back in months not years.
---
😂 made me laugh.

Quite the big cap fleet you guys have. What about the supers tits and carriers? They must have been busy to?

I guess it’s only viable for newbies lol. Wait, I knew Nigerian space prince was familiar, you fucked me up before, blew up my shit hahahahaha 💀
---
Disagree 
---
So they WERE actively protected botters.
---
It is still the dumbest idea ever.  If you want this type of thing, crawl back into your wormhole.  I'm sorry that you are so bad at Eve that getting rid of local is the only way that you can ever hope to get kills.  Because face it, that is what this boils down to. You want easy kills against PvE ships.  Because if anyone forms to fight you all you do is just run away.  So yeah, your opinion means jack shit.  Your idea is stupid on every front.  You have yet to say a reason that it is a good idea that does not involve you just wanting easy kills.  Therefore, it is a dumb idea.

No one gives a rats ass what a corp or alliance can give you until they understand the game and the politics behind it. There's a lot to be said by learning before jumping. Period. There's plenty for new players to do solo for 2 to 3 months before joining anyone. It also gived the players a sense of ownership and pride. Not just getting their hand held and entitlements without the appreciation of what it takes to get there.

Trial is not necessarily what I would call it.
---
Demo is more accurate as in a trial (imo) you get access to everything for a limited time~~~~
---
The f2p plays like a demo, you are limited by the skills you can train which translates into what you can fly, which in turn is supposed to translate into what you can do.
---
This does not mean that when flying a ship one day you will hit a wall saying "you cannot enter this fight for f2p reasons" but it does mean that you will be limited in your ceiling of effectiveness in the skills you can learn and retain.
---
Mining for instance, you can technically fit up the easiest to acquire mining ship and zap rocks, but you will never physically obtain the best rock munchery in the game.
---
If you're more interested in PVP the game is never technically p2w, but you will be limited in the respects of your skills meaning if you and a premium player both fit up the exact same ships and fly exactly the same, mathematically they should win depending on skills

I hear ya on the alt part. I discuss this a lot with my friends, I think CCP made the decision to allow/encourage/force alts in order to fix some inherent problems the game has.

Regarding Wingspan, funny thing is that a couple of weeks ago I watched a few of WINGSPANTT's videos and enjoyed it.

A FAX is a Force Auxiliary ship, a capital class logistics ship based on a carrier (and using the racial Carrier skills). They are extremely resilient healing ships, able to be fit either strong buffer or strong self-repair tanks and simultaneously (with either fitting) able to keep other capital ships or super-capital ships alive. They have minimal attack capabilities, usually limited to five sentry drones or the like and unlike other carriers do not use fighters.
---
FW space is low-sec space that sits between the four NPC empires (Amarr, Caldari, Gallente, Minmatar) that in EVE's lore, represents expansion space that the four empires are fighting over and trying to expand into. In game terms, they are areas of space where players can align themselves with one of the four factions which then sets them as permanent allies of two factions and permanent enemies of the other two. For instance, aligning yourself with the Caldari will make you allied with Amarr FW pilots but enemies of Gallente and Minmatar FW pilots.
---
The FW pilots then fight over these areas of space, earning loyalty points and promotions within the faction by either running missions or attacking enemy player ships. These player ships can be attacked without consequence wherever they appear including high-sec space, but of course that means that enemies of the faction you join can attack *you* in high-sec space too. If a faction captures enough enemy territory, the rewards granted to the entire faction go way, way up, and the loyalty points earned can be traded (along with ISK) for faction modules and ships which can then be sold for a significant profit.

---
Again, the 5% makes sense if you (the customer) are requiring the JF  pilot to pay collateral to move your stuff. That used to be super common in most alliances, though I think when all of the TEST guys were doing it they either didn't allow collateral or required 3%.
---

??? Its was very told and very vocal here, but by late 2015 got overshadowed by the events leading up to WWB  and then WWB itself.
---
I made a few billion ISK myself using this trick to sell overpriced Ammatar and Khanid faction modules that I built myself. It was great fun running around the different trade hubs, putting up more fake buy orders, watching the marks desperately try to sell their shiny new Ammatar armour hardeners that they had only bought because they thought they could flip them at a massive profit. Some people fell for the exact same trick several times over. I put up two different buy orders at each station, one the massively inflated margin-trading one, and another for a fraction the price that was actually going to succeed. Many times people sold to the second one (because they didn't realise it didn't sell the first time) and I just resold the module to another greedy customer. Incase you were thinking you could outsmart the scam by buying and selling simultaneously, it should be pretty obvious that my seller, margin trader buying, and genuine buying alts were three different people, and there was only a few seconds window when selling to the margin trader would succeed, before I safely emptied his wallet to another account.

TL;DR, this is classic EVE gameplay, instead of getting salty you should try it yourself.

&gt;80% Jita Buy Buyback is not reasonable. Goons are paid 89% Jita Buy for their ore, and they have a low rate because they have many many miners, and thus a huge glut of supply for ore, lowering the percentages. BSC has nowhere near Goon volume, yet they're offering less than goons?
---
I can't even imagine being this fucking dumb. That's not how that works at all. When an organization buys ore back it's because they're planning to invest it into something that they can monetize.  It's not fucking shocking that GSF, literally the largest alliance in the game with the highest production power, can't be matched by some small, no-name entity that's only going to be selling ratting carriers and Rorquals instead of dozens of dreads and carriers a day (at least). Your assertion seems to be that newer corporations, with probably no corp income and no massive production lines, should be offering much higher rates than established alliances like GSF. Which means you should probably just go back to mining your spod and forego trying to dump on other groups.

&gt;I would, but I wouldn't immediately go to reddit bragging about "annihilating the fleet."

Why don't you copy the goon model? Set a minimum fee regardless of weight. Set it so that you choose between either the fee or 1 or however much percentage of the collateral of the contract. So if minimum fee is 5m, the most collateral that can be had is 500m at 1% rate. You can increase that but the ADDED 5% including the weight charges is too much

Thank you for that comprehensive explanation. 
---
Will they be fed to HK or to HKASS? lol, i think THERAN won't be able to move against any of those parties, just by having a fast look for their killboard.
---
Vexor should be able to do L3s
---
you'll 100% get shit on in pvp though, the best you can hope for is noone showing up in the pvp pocket after 5 minutes and loot being up for grabs
---
T2 manufacturing is interesting and fun (for me), but it is by no means massive. It's a slog and involves pretty intricate and busy logistics.
---
So you can only shoot wartargets and Suspects?
---
I really wanna relate something IRL
---
But since my moral ambiguity chip got overloaded
---
I chose to talk some shit instead
---
what is happening to r/eve ?

Thanks, I'll give it a try, who knows, maybe I'm lucky and I meet someone else who counts on no bling ship showing up.
---
People always bring up slowcats for some reason. Yes we hate current supers but that doesnt mean we want to go back to slowcats...
---
Cal Mil / Gal mil between 2015/2018 in FW was a pretty big rivalry. 
---
- Sege of Okkamon
---
- Siege of Avionen
---
- The Eha offensive in 2016
---
And more.
---
It's just a shame FW is a shadow of its former self.
---
Ya tvoju mamku v kino vodil.
---
My guess would be: they did it for the insurance. Two big-ish unfit ships thrown into low-sec traps within hours of each other.
---
Wouldn't be surprised if it's an alt of one of the campers. Raising some quick liquid ISK by collecting on expiring insurance, and padding their killboard all in one go.
---
Well done
---
I do like Minmatar strippers.
---
I want some rainbow laser displays on the Falcon Heavy Rocket.
---
Thanks for fixing what wasnt broken i guess
---
I feel about 7x better about some of my derps now.  Thanks.
---
Well... if they try to invade CE, that would just confirm your statement.
---
Take my upvote. 
---
mate you cant heed any mind to what Valkorsia says. His mind is just gone with the fairies at this point.
---
*awful
---
had a decent brawl with them couple of days ago, was fun
---
I know, right. He mentioned TiDi without raging at CCP at all, and talked about capital battles and ratting without a single "balancing" suggestion. 
---
This is so confusing. It's almost as if he's... enjoying himself. It's just NOT RIGHT AT ALL!
---
Whenever I roam I like to start through the pipe that leads into the systems for the arc; usually ignore anything in the lowsec portions but once I'm in Curse itself it's open season. As far as camp severity it's basically none.
---
There was maybe two days where I ran into a guy bubblecamping with a Jag+Sabre alt on either the Utopia or Jorund gate in Doril (the two gates are less than 10,000 km away from each other), but sadly (for me) he doesn't seem to keep it up, or at least not in the TZ where I'd run into him.
---
Other than that there's been basically no bubble activity there, and no active camps. You might run into some dictors, but a lot of the AFs can bully dictors pretty decently. T3Ds can as well, depending on the fit/matchup.
---
As a general rule of thumb a nullified 'ceptor will get you through the entire trip with ease. Even then you'd probably be just as well off flying an AF or a T3D; there's very few bubbles that show up (and most of them are somewhat obvious gate-to-gate bubbles; IE, don't warp gate-to-gate, pick a celestial in d-scan range that's outside the "warp line" of a gate-to-gate warp, and then dscan the gate- make sure you have bubbles on your overview/dscan setting- and then if it looks safe go for it). Further flying an AF/T3D means that you can complete the missions faster, which if you're concerned about being killed in the process is ideal.
---
As an aside, most of the missions are gated- this is part of how it limits it to frigs/destroyers- so you do have a little extra time to try and blitz the mission objective and bail if combat probes show up on scan within \~1-2 AU.
---
It does somewhat depend on TZ but for the most part there's not a lot of people there and it's not really camped in.
---
I actually ran the Guristas arc maybe two weeks ago as well, though in that case it might just have been the time I was moving through, and the most activity I saw in Venal was that there was some kind of action going on in one of the systems I traveled through and there was also a pretty good chunk of burner blitzers (could probably have some fun trying to catch/kill them actually).
---
vnis are a decent ship to in the sub 100 mil mark. 
---
krab alliance leaves krab grounds due to looming war for more fertile krab grounds. such is migration in eve.
---
Nah, just scared what will happen when their lords and masters can't hide behind a NIP anymore....
---
I dunno that sounds like a good way to get your balls bitten off by an angry Russian.
---
Like it's clever wordplay and all but that sounds like it would actually just lead to you having no testicles and an angry Russian spitting your torn-off scrotum out and then screeching in angry superiority.
---
Nah loads of different use cases for it. Hull and armour tank is pretty common on frigates, even stuff like the Hecate can be fit with hull rigs and AAR, then their is the breacher of course. 
---
Breacher. 
---
Also it's weird that your trying to disagree with me but agree with me...
---
Theres a difference between: init kills dread bomb, was some good kills.
---
And: lol retards got rekt guess they didnt adapt fast enough to our titan blob, look at us reddit, we so elite yet?
---
Should on some hull, the breacher is a perfect example, where a shield booster, AAR and hull rigs can be use effectively together.
---
There used to be fights over them, at least.
---
To be fair though, I can't count the number of moneymoon fights that have happened since the changes on one hand, but that's only because there haven't been any.
---
Yeah there is not much we can do besides sitting here.
---
Hostile Dreadbombs are few and so content is to spin your camera around your ship at the undock because sadly Supers and Tits can't spin in Station (CCPls)...
---
So thats why everything in Delve gets directly blopped to shit, there is no war so we have nothing better to do.
---
Errr yeah that's what I said....
---
Desperation is a stinky cologne, as you an obvious bait poster why don’t you just biomass irl and go fuck yourself. 
---
Not 100% sure what you mean here, but abyssal modifications impact on fitting, so you might've rolled better fitting stats (cpu and powergrid) for your module and hence you can now use them because you're not over tour fitting limits.

Na = Sodium, K = potassium
---
Potassium and sodium together play a huge role in regulating blood pressure and some evidence shows both also play a large role in bone health. They regulate the passage of fluid across cell membranes, which is important for maintaining a state of fluid balance and for transporting nutrients and waste in and out of cells. Sodium is often consumed in excess, which can create an imbalance that can result in high blood pressure. Potassium can aid in the removal of excess sodium from the body, which can help lower blood pressure.

There a more than a handful of ships that you can add to a fleet to completely neutralize the treat of carriers, they brought none and paid the price.
---
&gt;This is the eve that CCP created. 
---
Because players whined and whined for it.
---
Turns out, farms and fields was only wanted if other people have to tend them, so now they're crying about getting Exactly what they asked for.
---
Why would players risk the supers without the fax support?
---
A post on r/eve complaining about the lack of memes and excitement which in itself contains zero memes or excitement...
---
Be the change that you wish to see in New Eden
---
Then maybe you should send all your evidence to ccp instead of crying on reddit?
---
Obviously #21 and #22 are the best ones there. Tough to choose between them.
---
Kek'd hard, thanks :D
---
actually, VNI is probably the best option
---
you might even kite out and ransom expensive ab-fit bricktanks for big monies, fit and piloting have to actually be non-shit though
---
So it's too hard to mine now?
---
Now that reply makes up a bit of lost ground for your thread, I can now say well played to you sir for that.   
---
Ehh, I had a fight over a POS yesterday for the first time in years. No rose-tinted glasses. It was far more fun than any citadel bash.
---

A new player is inspiring all the bitter vets to remember that, in spite of political affiliation, we are all playing a video game. Its beautiful.
---
You know the names of these characters &amp; the isk values of the ships lost, why does an in game mail have to perquisite good manners? The cost of the T1 ships is under 20 million Iskipoos!
---
Actually it was having one side login seconds before downtime in order to regain another percent of cap.
---
Hahah doubt it, I love the Ruskies they’re fun, sure they can take a joke. I remember accidentally warping into a Russian base, thankfully I had a cloak but i was stuck in the bubble.. eventually I got away but it was good fun chatting with them
---
No hard feelings, we’re all playing this to see shit blow up, right? 😂😂
---
Cyka blyat idi nahui means something like bich fak of I think , learned from cs go

To try and play Devils advocate, sometimes when explaining what an organization is currently doing or planning to do can be finicky because a) you don't want to give out *too* many details (for various reasons), b) don't want to over/under-sell to the public, and c) things look different from inside a company than outside of it.
---
So CCP Falcon *could* have been on the up and up with the fan base as best as he can given his position. Or he could just say whatever sounds good to CCP, or both.
---
Lmao, Horde and friends had 100+ caps ready and 2 subcap fleets to fight the timer. Get out of here with "we were blobbed" bullshit

Game is so trash at this point. It's carebear and blob heaven.
---
I don't understand. Title says KWG and Legacy, not skillu/FRT. OP wanted to talk about legacy bots and bots allied with legacy so why this unrelated topic?
---
Looks fun, but are the pixels intentionally like that?
---
hahahahah

Usually scams have workarounds though. And this isn't newfound :)
---
I was like wow this all makes an interesting amount of sense.
---
Then I was like wow this could even be a Stain-gate joke.
---
Then I read OP's name.
---
Now I'm not sure if I should be impressed at the level of shitpost this is, or impressed at the level of non-shitpost this is.
---
Help
---
I mean, people meme, but that is 90% of how a well-executed drop goes.  Lots of waiting around.
---
I love it when the old memes come back tbh.  Rather than tackle Rorq and tank the world, let's bring 2012 back.
---
No it's to easy. Now everybody can go rorq mining so it's not possible for a 2000 char alliance to keep up with a 20000 one. It used to be possible because getting the big money making options took commitment. 
---
yeah boys! the FFA the other night was really fun, we're waiting for the second round :) (let's hope this time snuff doesn't drop 4 titans and end our fun too soon though)
---
That PvP loot cache, what kind of loot does it have ISKwise? I know its random but rough estimate
---
That might have been intended :)
---
Some other methods to make money with low skillpoint requirement:
---
* Exploration (Relic/Datasites)
---
* DED sites - difficult with your low skills, take it as a challenge. Align out, kill elite frigates first and flee if you would die otherwise. "Independence" is probably the easiest combat site in Null to run, you should be able to do this in your VNI already.
---
* Belt ratting: Belt rats drop a lot of loot in general, most of it is only good for reprocessing, though. But you can find faction spawns and industrials full of minerals (even a Kryos sometimes can't loot them all in one go).
---
I would not recommend to go for battleships already. You need a lot of SPs to fly them really well. Improve your VNI skills, branch out into a Gila. And try to get into the doctrines of your alliance, do PvP. This is Eve, PvE alone IS boring.
---
This post is more retarded than the time Pandaboss Noraus tried to anchor a keepstar on an American bank holiday.  
---
Quite funny though. Also I heard that the ENG corps coming in only came because they were offered cheap plex and that they could bot 24/7 to help raise more funds for Noraus keepstar stock for when he needs to give test another one.....

Currently (with the input of the comments on this post) there are 16 Videos (4-15 minutes long) planned.  
---
I am planning on different things like exploiting gameplay mechanics to your advantage and other things like that.  
---
Also; I will post the videos in this ones they are released.
---
I can contribute with "на это сало я твою сальную мамку в кино поведу"

you could not be a retard and set it to like everyone else you racist prick
---
Amazing, won't risk 2 bil ship for that, maybe just for fun and opponent dropped loot.
---
Trying to turn r/eve in your personal. Army. Nice
---
Those are really good points!  
---
The first videos will only be showcasing gameplay mechanics and how in depth every module can effect your ship. How gun/missle mechanics work, etc..  
---
Later I am playing on going through bad fits I find on zKill or the new player channel, etc. and showcase how you can spot (with your previously acquired knowledge) where they have issues and how to correct them.
---
Thanks Arenta, seems like I've got a lot of catching up to do! Would be great if I somehow got to connect with these rivals.
---
Yeah Omist is fucking cancer. All the rattlesnake bots are now bubble-immune. I gave up hunting there after a domi kill took like 40 mins. Also had to take a regional gate with my sin because apparently you can't hit Omist from Feythabolis. 
---
A video is planned to talk about Tank/DPS ratios!
---
Hmm... almost like OP should have PRINTed what was on the SCREEN using some sort of special button on that large board of buttons that people connect to their computer.
---
If enough isk cam be made from running those sites to to replace lost VNIs that's a good idea for me.
---
I could imagine a newbie in a 70mil VNI being pretty happy after doing 3-4-5 of those pockets with noone showing up though.
---
Jackpot would be ransoming 1b+ from a dude who for whatever reason cant kill you
---
Other than that, yeah, abyss pvp pocket loot is a little something to pay expensive boosters etc. but its not much compared to isk at stake. 
---
Nice touch, but they wont listen :/
---
There were a lot of NIPs but nothing like it is today.
---
Yeah fuck hk noober dogs. Side note did he refer to himself in 3rd person about recruiting a corp?
---
Thank you for this info, a normal null ratting 100mn ab VNI fit with just the drones changed to adapt for the specific abyss should be good?
---
Grr Test, Hat Test
---
I dig what you mean and I've been thinking about that sort of concept (almost a convergence of how PushX and BF might price). My current inclination is that simplicity trumps a lot of that. I'm always looking at how this can be the most favorable to members, and love honest feedback, not this bad excuse of a shitpost, but hey, it's forum I guess.
---
In the meantime, I'll just keep flying with my space friends and trying to help people out.
---
More like 3.6M now.  Everyone is waiting for a PLEX sale.
---
Nope

Tier 3 abyss spawns are not super hard, but for sure non-trivial to deal with. You need to try it on SiSi or expect to lose 3-4-5 ships before you figure out what to do vs. all the different spawns.

---
Okay, so this stuff _isn't bad_ from what I can figure. Just some people are maximum salt with shitty pictures.
---
You pay collateral, you get it all back, so you are wanting an additional 5% for nothing. Again, you put your fee into the overall cost. That is what it is for. Especially if you have only a 2 bil limit.
---
F1-F8?
---
Who said I was immune to danger? I said I didn't get killed by hunters. That is because, as I stated, I very rarely krab. I do however see many many many krab deaths daily, so wondering how bad of a player you must be to need CCP to give you kills on a silver platter?
---
yepp....best trigger. Works the other way too.
---
imagine being retarded enough to post this
---
must be retarded
---
Dead on. The view I take is that any JF can get popped any time (obviously proper JF piloting, exercising care, etc. can avoid almost all incidents). Given this, I really, really don't want newbros to be in this situation where they've trusted someone to ship something and it never gets there, and I don't want it to be some awkward thing where the JF pilot can't cover the cost of what's lost.
---
It's a huge risk to JF that far (&gt; 40 LY), especially from the south. The goal was to operate thin on the margins but make sure the risk taking was acceptable to the JF pilots. As we grow and the corp can help every member more from a capital perspective, all this stuff improves.
---
Thanks for your perspective and bringing a little reason to this thread. There's a number of people commenting here who have literally no idea how EVE logistics works, and only so much attempted explanations my fingers are willing to type.
---
Thanks Olmeca, very interesting story you bring to the table. It made me wonder even more about the rivalry within EvE. Things seem to get even more heated within this community compared to other MMOs. Why do you think players of EvE are so 'hostile' to players from other alliances? Would it be the type of players playing this game or could it be the vast amounts of time invested in the game that make them so fanatic? Even going as far as DDOSing seems pretty radical if you ask me. 
---
you know Imperium can outform panfam alone right? 
---
Hold my beer! Invading CCP office ... at Fanfest!
---
since when does the art team do game balance? 
---
It's capable of using more RAM. There are situations (like some large fleet fights) where people have had client crashes, because the client attempted to use more RAM than was possible on a 32 bit process. 
---
It's relatively niche, but it's an important niche

#BRING BACK THE OLD SKILL QUEUE

If you've been crashing out, straight to desktop, then there's a fair to middling chance you've run into the memory issue.

Any other symptom, and it's less likely to be that. (socket closed, etc)
---
mad? lol
---
Dodixie is probably the closest trade hub. As for actually mining any quiet spots you find you would want to keep to yourself because CODE would come looking for you if they heard about it.
---
Hey at least you can do it as it relates to work!
---
So, your response is : "Why should I care about problems other people may have with such a change".   
---
Remind me again, why should I care about your problems - you know, the problems that you have because else, you wouldn't propose any change?   
---
Let's just assume I would be OK with "just make things a hell of a lot easier for the so called "Elitists" aka solo/small gang pilots so they can finally get their self-esteem fixed by getting kills very, very easily".   
---
What about the other problems I've mentioned. Do you need a day to think about them each time even though I've layed them all out for you? Do I need to ask you about them once per day so your brain doesn't become overwhelmed?  
---
I.e. How do you think having less people in space would be a good thing and how would 0.0 be balanced, RISK:REWARD wise when you remove a balancing factor for it's RISK:REWARD out of the game?   
---
Question: did you just see this comment? I posted it 15 hours ago, but I think it was bugged out for some reason.
---
As for your question, I don't think most players are hostile but some in particular alliances are, due to their culture. Also, it is not the time spent but fact that you can lose what you achieved with that time very fast. In other games when you die you  respawn, but losses in Eve are pretty unforgiving. This also means that Eve attracts a certain kind of person who likes making others miserable. And these people tend to dedicate their time more than others, and raise in high ranks in big alliances because they need such dedication. In return, when they lead their alliances they tend to create hostile cultures and promote a lack of empathy for other people's perspectives. Of course, majority of Eve players are people you would like to have a beer with, but statistically there is more of a certain kind of douchebag in Eve, and at higher ranks.
---
You're arguing in circles here. I'm telling you why it's like that for a lot of entities. Collateral is a service, not an entitlement. I, and most JF pilots I know of, don't typically allow collateral at a base rate. If you want me to insure your shit, you're paying extra.
---
When I came to this game back in 2013, as soon as my char got frigates and scanning to 3 I moved to sansha nullsec, hunting for those relic sites. Trial account, no cloak, no knowledge of d-scan... 
---
It was amazing. Adrenaline, fear, pride as I managed to get 800kk cargo into highsec through a wormhole chain and buying my first PLEX on the first week of playing. 
---
I've lost dozens of magnates, but it was worth it.
---
Yes it is worth, but to all who can't afford 15 bucks a month to spend on a game you probably will commit a fuckton of time on -&gt; rethink your monthly priorities in regards to money spending in RL, jesus christ
---
no offense, just this f2p-culture currently annoys me.
---
No problem. I've run a JF service for TEST, PYRE, and several other entities in between. I'm not picking sides here; I know nothing about your alliance, I just find this thread to be incredibly illogical. Fuel is expensive, running a small group is expensive. I've easily spent 200b in the last 5 years running small entities, and I would be very surprised if I made half of that back. People that shit on small entities because "lel these scrubs can't offer better prices than gsf lel xd" annoy the piss out of me. This subreddit has been invaded by dumb f1 monkeys that literally know nothing about how anything in this game is done besides how to fucking siege their rorqual and follow (somewhat) and FCs instructions.
---
I’m goons (honestly) send me 200 million 
---
It's amazing how slow that thing goes down under so many sieged dreads.
---
Thanks, 
---
One more thing, what ores should I be looking for the most and is there an easy way to check?
---
Also you can say "Слава Україні" (Glory to Ukraine) - this phrase always sets russian asses on fire.
---
And that is why I use better JF services than yours.
---
moloks are extremely fucking tanky lol
---
I didn't even take that into consideration... Thanks for the elaboration :) So in a sense, it is also caused by the type of player that seeks out the high-risk high reward type of games. And, on the other hand, there are players who thrive on seeing other people's progress fail... This of course very oversimplified     
---
well, you "evicted" the only guy that was camping you and now you whine that you don't have anything else to do, nice...
---
You clearly have delusions of grandeur. No decent WH corp lives in a C4.
---
I'd probably go the other way and kill them with kindness. As Oppenheimer said, "Confusion to our enemies!" And what's more confusing than to respond to being cussed out by complimenting the strength of their father and insisting that their sister is pure and unsullied?
---
Pretty sure this is on purpose to prevent people from reprocessing the pre built modules they loot into trig materials.
---
Pretty sure it´s "intended". Every hull has a hard coded signature. But the signature can be influenced by a lot of things. Weapon tracking takes this into accout but lock times not. I guess they were just not thinking about that variable or simply made it static so it´s easier to code and/or less expensive on the computing side. But since we are in 2019 it´s time to reconsider such changes. 
---
You're welcome to pretend to know what you're talking about, a brief jog through your comment history shows that you're not very good at it. Either way, I'm explaining to you why many alliances have done this, and now I'm done with this.
---
I had a guy get upset with me in Corp chat when asking what drones to use, and only said he would be shooting NPCs. Dude, what faction NPC? I need to know this so I can tell you the correct shit.
---
wtf is that thing
---
The only decent brawl POS party had in the last few days they got absolutely dumpstered by MCAV.
---
Damn still going strong, how's SPVG doing?
---
And I'm telling you that not a single JF that I have ever used added a premium based on collateral.  I'm sorry that you are in shit tier alliances, I really am.
---
usually when i lock a frigate in a bigger ship, where it takes a while, it almost always instalocks or atleast reduces the time to lock drasticly when the frig turns on its MWD 
---
So I'm reading a request for a gate from Stain to Omist ?
---
You only find faction modules they are always better to keep than reprocess.        
---
Guns can be only build. 
---
I’d assume this is a bug, as signature is supposed to influence lock time (and I have experienced and played around it quite a bit as well).
---
This war was garbage and a blueball fest on both sides.
---
You mean the world tour or whatever is called? 
---
You should be aware that (like he said) this guy is running his own personal hate campaign against Goons and pops up in every single thread mentioning us, writing these 6000 word essays about himself and insinuating that there's false narratives, cults and toxicity where there is little to none.
---
But yeah kicking down other people's sandcastles is a big thing in Eve; since this is a sandbox you gotta invent your own story in a sense and burning your enemies lands is an activity as old as the game itself.  
---
I came into a MTC hole the other day and all you cucks were too busy krabbing to fight our gang, way to throw shade
---
Guys got a point thats pretty virgin tier shit

Why not just remove supercaps, and caps.

Kick that stupid fucking retard

citadel bashes are so boring ammirite? a few solo kills and a quick way to end your participation in a fleet. *you're a god damn genius pte. Pyle!* Test are lucky to have such a critical thinker on the team.

And then broke jump immunity. Oops.

i do agree, the monochrome looks better, blends nicer into the rest of the UI and does not clash w/ other ui objects, whilst some might prefer the colored icons alá 2006, simply making a option in the settings to toggle between the 2 would be the simplest solution instead of forcing either one 
---
Serious question:
---
Why does the sub make fun of you so much? You seem pretty passionate about EvE, which is cool and all since we all here should like this game (since we play it and interact with the community here), but in a way you remind me of a poster on /r/EliteDangerous where their passion seems to come off a bit... obsessive?
---
Either way, I won't be helping you on your mission (since I'm far away and have no clue whats really going on) but I do wish you the best. Kick some ass.
---
Play as an alpha for awhile and see if you enjoy the game with the limitations it has. If you do, a yearly sub is $130ish which is like $11/month right, and gives you access to many more ships/skills. Compare that to the other forms of entertainment you spend money on...even if you only play EVE a few hours per month, it's worth it. If you're a hardcore no-lifer like many of us are, that $11/month is nothing.
---
The pay-to-win model applies for a lot of low engagement stuff like injecting into rorqs...if you want to actually fight other pilots in space, experience with flying/fitting will always be the biggest advantage, and to get that experience you need to die a lot, not buy a lot. Check zkill and you'll see young, injected toons dying in blingy ships all the time because the player doesn't know what they're doing.
---
Breaking news for you I guess but r/eve is shit since more solid year.
---
We all know Valk's retarded, the trick is to ignore him
---
I'm guessing you just mashed words on your screen without reading anything. Nice work chap.
---
this game's dead anyways, just go bot in Omist and RMT out.
---
Rivalries in Eve tend to begin with 2 groups competing for the same resources or having a war for whatever reason, and over time these groups tend to splinter up, with groups of players or corps usually sticking together or band together around their favored leader, but people tend to remember who kicked their group from their home region or betrayed them, so these rivalries really do last a long time.   
---
For example, a &lt;2 year long war between Stain Alliance and Curse Alliance in 2004-5, and the world dominance of Band of Brothers in 2005-6 is a big part of why I completely refuse the idea of joining Northern Coalition, which today is one of the more successful groups in the game and is partly made up of remnant members, leaders and corps from that olden time.  
---
But there's almost no rivalry in Eve so strong that ingame enemies wouldn't talk and laugh about it over beer IRL.
---
The competition for hisec ores is so high that the price is so close that it doesn't really matter in the end.
---
It's easy to evict KWG, the problem is Legacy will show up to stop any serious eviction attempt. 
---
Not necessarily.
---
When you initiate warp to a site, the site's timer starts ticking down. After 3 or 4 days the site will despawn.
---
So, if there are not many cosmic signatures, it's possible someone was there a few days prior and warped all of them, but it's also possible someone was there a few hours prior and actively ran the relic/data sites or what have you.
---
Look the system up on zkillboard to see if there as been any activity of the fiery kind in the system very recently, or whether there are repeat offenders IE. people that actually live in that particular system and will likely see you.
---
And where are you seeing the latter?
---
yes, they had to leave otherwise they would have been evicted. And their leader is blacklisted.
---
There were 3 massive titan fights that mattered, and on the eastern front at least there were dozens and dozens of subcap fights if you were there.
---
Just because GOTG and Goons stared at each other like brain dead coconuts for weeks because cyno jammers doesn't mean the rest of us weren't busy
---
V0lta, Tuskers &amp;, Minions T h e r a p y live in thera

Yeah is eve on fire daily of you know where to look.
---
All you have to do is go one jump out of jita to experience tidi
---
I was telling you to do something productive rather than your infantile mewling. 
---
Often mining ops with multiple people will use jet can mining and possibly a hauler. Yeah, they can fly to station and empty, but that's time that they aren't mining which is than less isk/hour or ore/hour.

Use Google translate. Paste in Shakespeare, Loren ipsum or whatever. It's not perfect, but it works well enough to annoy them.
---
Brave is part of Legacy, allied with Test.
---
I think most new players don't "like" anyone, alignment doesn't really matter. I would characterize the big four into 2 categories:
---
* Safe home, PvP is something you get on deployments/after traveling dozens of systems: Test, Goons
---
* Content home, life is more dangerous, many flashforms and fights out of standing fleet: Brave, Horde
---
BLYAT!
---
Last night while moving my cyno around I got scammed and webbed right before a mom uncloaked on a Lowe sec gate. Couldn't even burn back to gate in a legion. Can confirm that it hasn't changed at all &lt;3
---
What I did after I quit (Twice) was join a content heavy, active and easygoing corp (Mjolnir Bloc in Calmil first time, Pandemic Horde second time) and went off solo PVPing in cheap frigates and cruisers whenever there wasn't a fleet/gang going.
---
 That way I had minimal downtime and had constant content, and didn't have to worry about losing all my isk while brushing the rust off.
---
Uh, what?
---
You seem to have your wires crossed. I'll try help you out. 
---
This subreddit has many threads about KWG botting (there is a search function at the top of the page). 
---
If you read *this* thread you will see one of the (possibly former) Legacy diplos confirming they (KWG) pay rent/were paying rent and are +5 blue standings.
---
Hopefully that's enough for your evident mangobrain to understand. I also did not start this thread. I'm just reading reddit like everyone else. However I'm not a complete moron like you.
---
No one here is "mewling", the whole game is sick of bots you god damn retard.
---
C R A C K S    F O R M I N G
---
Nice logic. Except when bots get banned/suspended or have -100bil isk in wallet ofc they won't be able to pay the rent. And only then alliances give a shit and kick them. Sad but true...
---
Imagine being so retarded you can't even comprehend the NIP your daddy made for you

.....................
---
I know.      
---
But did you know that if you put camping chars in KWG space and start to hunt them - quite soon someone will come and offer ISK if you go away?                 
---
If KWG will be unable to operate - they will be gone - and even if this space will go to Fuel Blocks ... i prefer it 100% more than current situation ... **simply as we move from KWG are "independent" group that pay other alliances to Fuel Blocks that are strictly controlled by Test** aka it will be much easier to point and blame specific group.              
---
Still i hope someone other will move into Omist. 
---
OK, so I used this website to show the most profitable P2 to P4 products.
---
I appear to have sorted profit backwards and have ended up making P4 products that are worth less than half of the P2 products I bought!!!!
---
Well it's all a learning experience...............
---
Wow spod does something to people...
---
I'm a bit confused by the terms carrier, sub-cap, capital.
---
In terms of Amarr ships, which is which? I know it's a really simple question, but I'm trying to figure out where I can fit in or where I'd want to fit in. The frigate life ain't half bad, but I'm really tired of these tiny ships. I am digging the whole drone-boat thing for a cruiser.
---
NBSI, he probably thinks eve is NBSI. I get it might be confusing after even your FCs get unsure what exactly is "neutral", but you might want to double check with goons what your standings are, they see you as neutrals and they'd probably shoot him unless ordered by FC otherwise.
---
Sums it all up xD

Well, if this happens in the Local chat then the best approach would be (IMO) to write this:
---
Пожалуйста, прекрати, меня это обижает
---
(Please stop, this hurts me)
---
And if the shit stream doesn't stop (it won't stop with 99% probability) then just file a petition to support with the local chat logs. Some of the shit they write in the local deserves bans (the famous phrase about hands is nothing compared to the words some of them spit into the chat)
---
Ignorant of what?
---
 I know there are bots.
---
All the fucking crying is more annoying than the botting at this point. 
---
... Why would you need an RKK spy?
---
Thank u my dude!
---
itt
---
people hella mad about some frigates lmao.
---
oh no not the newbros
---
Listen dude I appreciate your enthusiasm on the topic, but you're a fucking moron if you think these social crusades bring down botters.
---
The root solution to botters is turning off the ability for people who control them to have access to the game. So gather your evidence, and report it to CCP.
---
Player intervention in remote as fuck areas like Omist will never be as effective; a bot can easily out wait a person and frankly, projecting sufficient firepower into the region for ganks isn't likely without WHs etc to bring dudes through.
---
&gt; **No one this subreddit doubts that this alliance is full of them** 
---
Stop with the lazy rhetoric; even if we did believe you, your post carries no weight without having evidence. So edit your OP when you have it if you actually want to motivate action, or shaming of the alliances that shelter them.
---
gotta risk it for the biscuit 
---
Its probably this.
---
I am just sad that I won't get to feast on them. You gotta give it to them tho: They are quite ballsy. Need more of that in Eve. Even though they are also quite annoying. 
---
It is not about putting botters down, but **about putting down the alliance that allows botting**         
---
There is a huge difference.          
---
Why even care about killing the alliance if this will not hurt botters much?             
---
Mostly because KWG is an "independent group" that pays any one - **so no one have to accept blame for KWG operation**           
---
Removing KWG will force someone to take the space after them thus forcing this group to accept the blame for botting and RMT.         
---
Before someone asks wtf about the fit and a noob bringing Orca to LS, he is probably trying to take the Orca (and Freighter) out from Asset Safety.
---
Thanks for the offer, I'm a loyal corp man to the end. Toe the company line, stay in my lane.... They say nine out of ten men follow the tenth man! A cog in the corporate machine
---
Kabbala confirmed
---
Yeh, pretty sure "no fax" given about that little hicc up. 
---
You know you've fucked up when THREE different fcs start screaming at you at the sametime. 
---
Your crusade is even more irrelevant then. You can set up new corporations and alliances overnight. Purging one alliance from a location just means another can fill the vacuum.
---
There are many, many places that offer a confortable ecosphere for botters to thrive.
---
And, even more so, if you want to shame the alliances, you have to provide the proof. No one takes up a social cause without evidence, dude.

Mine Blue Ice. Best ISk/h at high sec mining.

Yes
---
if you look closer then you might notice that a far few things killed are unrelated, unless the drifter NPC's are now a corp in horde.
---
The friendly fire mino can hardly be called a horde kill either.
---
https://ore.cerlestes.de/ore
---
Just see what you have in the belt, what is better prices on here, and mine away. o/
---
LZHX and HK are few but well off. An avarage form from them will be 15-30x blinged out slave leshaks + triage/nestors/guardians and a dread depending on mass.
---
NOVAC are also quite well off but may not have as many numbers. Their spread is good though and their heavy shield is flat and edgy.
---
TDSIN are probably the biggest group but are slightly more risk adverse and are in a long term relationship with Gilas. 
---
MCAV, POSPY and SOUND are slightly smaller but can punch above their weight, especially SOUND.
---
HK, NOVAC and LZHX hold sov and engage in NS warfare though this is a rather recent thing for them. Lack of WH targets for these groups and mismatching timezones means that C5 ragerolling is netting less and less fights. Organized warfare in WH's is pretty much just a Russian Wackamole as these corps work togather to keep them out of the C5-&gt;C6's.
---
In short, wormhole warfare is dead and we're all moving our stagings to C2's or nullpockets of interest in search of content.
---
Joining any of these groups save TDSIN or POSPY will require you to have a few accounts, 3-4 well skilled scanners, 2-3 decent to high SP subcap pilots and atleast 2 dreads unless your credit card is very familiar with plex.
---
Is this supposed to be like ironic or funny or interesting in any way
---
Yes, but it’s February outside already.
---
these is a wbesite that gives you the value of all the different ores against jita prices but i think the price will be the same in the other empires

No

@OP, check out www.reddit.com/r/evejobs/

i mean, long distance, also takes all the way into jita from wherever,
---
does it offer to take contracts with collateral?
---
and, of course people have choices to go and do it themselves and stop moaning about somone else doing nothing wrong, merely CLEARLY setting THIER price
---
Yes, please add more rocks for the mindless rock sucking junkies. God forbid you should add some interactive content that accidentally would make the game fun and engaging again.
---
How precise can anticapital Guns track a deployed structure like anchorable Warp Bubbles, Cyno Inhibs and Mobile Jump Arrays?
---
I was told Titans often use two anticapital Turrets to deal with those deployables, since they can "oneshot" them?
---
&gt; A rorq cant fit enough points of scram to hold a titan down while a hic can.
---
Yes You Can.
---
Awesome, we have some progress. 
---
Okay so you know there are bots in this game. If you have a spare few minutes you can read up on many threads about KWG botting (those guys are the topic of this thread, I also mentioned this already but you know :you_are_dense:).
---
Next read the top of *this* page where legacy "higher ups" confirm they (KWG) are THEIR RENTERS WITH BLUE STANDINGS.
---
I hope that clears things up. I have 0 evidence, as I did not say they were legacy renters. I also have 0 evidence myself of KWG botting as I READ ABOUT IT AND YOU CAN TOO.
---
Alright, have a good day and go fuck yourself idiot. I'm off to kill myself in-game.
---
says the rotated out Tethered Alliance Please Ignore
---
That is my understanding, yes.
---
if I was in stuck valkorsia's corp I would kill blue's out of pure cringe factor too 
---
I'm not sure what makes me want to scream the most in that video.
---
1- That retard ratting in a Molok.

2- Seing so much Titans drop like "yeah it's just a Titan let's lol it".

3- I'm French, but fuck that song, for real.

4- Blyat.

---
This quite literally proves that you have no idea what kind of dumb shit you're spouting.
---
FW is pretty dead nowadays. Most of the big fw alliances have either left fw or have interests outside of low sec. If you're resubbing for the old style plex warfare gameplay of 2 or 3 years ago (and before) then you're going to be disappointed. It's a shame too, I used to really enjoy that playstyle.
---
This is getting out of hand, as if B0T wasn't a hard enough foe, now there's two of them! 
---
After they just got evicted from wormholes they are being pushed out of the Drone Regions. NOVAC might have a couch for them in Fade but I wonder if HK will be comfortable with INIT so close or if LZHX can gate their supers all that way. This is a conundrum, what will BirdHorse do?
---
Why?
---
did i say anything about fitting undersized guns?? xD
---
show me a 'niche fit' that uses an undersized prop mod, civilian modules or that benefits from loading largest cap charges into a shield ancillary, and you sir, will become a billionaire IG :D
---
If you get ceptor with under 2s align time you are good, just pay attention to smartbombers, three smartbombing machs will obliterate your ship unless you go for some crazy tank, so bounce a lot and check out people's KB.
---
If you decide to do also the guristas one as well, make sure to check the route ahead, there is actually a guy in venal that has always two or three machariels smartbombing landing people on the way to HS (8k-ish dmg).
---
Also, make fucking insta-undock-warpout bms out of any station that you can for future use, there are quite few people that are obviously specializing in hunting arc runners.
---
He posts a bunch of ideas. Like, A LOT. About half of them are good to great. The other half are bad to fucking stupid. They are all more or less entertaining to debate. The loudest people in this sub are angry bitter assholes that focus on his shitposts. Everyone else just memes about him being a shitposter because of the loudmouths and act surprised when he goodposts. 
---
You sir are a scholar and a gentleman.
---
PI doesn't come from moons...
---
I like a lot of the old stuff better especially the weapon sounds.
---
I cri it used to be so fun and require no teamwork or schedule was really a golden age of solo casual pvp 
---
Wasnt always like that and that is what he meant
---
Sadly the effort it would take to come with something like that isn´t compensated by a billion ISK. Non the less, there are fits for "role players" which is civilian mods, I am sure. 
---
About undersized prop, no problem. Sometimes you fly a "whale" and no prop mod is worse than undersized, not saying it´s ideal though. 
---
Largest booster into shield ancillary I don´t know. Best thing I can come up with is "It´s a learning experience." Or maybe you are in one of these weird situations where you only have certain cap boosters left for whatever reason and it´s better to have the ancil filled than running it dry. So there are niche cases where this stuff comes handy. All of it together on one fit that makes sense, I barely doubt it. But maybe there is is this situation where all you have left is "scrap" so you tack something together to do whatever the hell you want to do. 
---
Assuming not a troll.  
---
KwG's are a PVE alliance living in Omist that are relatively neutral and don't belong to a coalition officially. Although they are pseudo-allied and dependents to legacy since they've paid them protection money and rented Feythabolis from them in the past, their survival depends entirely on a mutual relationship with a stable government like Legacy, since they lack any official political ties and their fleet numbers are abysmal for their size/age and scope, with most new nullsec alliances or typical lowsec alliances easily having more military power than them. They also cover the Eastern flank of Feythabolis and Paragon Soul (8 jumps through Feyth on the southern line), key rental territories for Legacy.  Given that KwG have almost no desire to aggressively expand, nor do they actively PVP outside of their own krabs defense, and even a Legacy renter could honestly beat them in a 1:1 clash. Legacy are fairly happy for them to sit on shit space and have a benign entity hold the space instead of a potential threat such as Winter Co.  
---
KwG's are disliked by the vast majority of non-legacy because they have had sustainstial leaks and have lots of evidence to suggest that are full of bots and illicit RMT activity. The most damning being 8 Nyx bots that were killed in a single night by a wormhole group, and an ex member revealing the details of which the leadership of KwG used bots and rented Feythabolis purely to fill it with Gilas/VNI bots, and how bots in KwG were used to fund highsec wardec alliance Pirat.  
---
They're still in the alliance tho?
---
We had more at the end because we never dock up, we never tether, we never ran away, we never ask to the ship who can tank waaaaaay more DD to dock up because zkillboard will be red  and isk war is a thing. The north was winning at the beginning, but because they are coward they lost that fight were they had more of everything, while The Imperium, describe on reddit as the biggest coalition, had less numbers and less titan on the grid but had way more balls, enough to told their member to hold the grid not secretly ping their member "Don't say anything, just tether we are not going to lose isk" 
---
I mean it makes perfect sense, both from a game perspective, and from a fantasy perspective.
---
We find and retrofit alien technology to interface with our machines and designs. But when we decide to junk them and break them down, they are made of the core minerals and elements that we already have. That probably just means they were built in the same universe as ours or some shit.
---
From a game perspective it's in line with CCPs general clamp down on building components for smaller storage space used to later reprocess for use - kind of like how things were done in the old days with mass manufacture of t1 guns to JF around then reprocess into minerals to build titans with.
---
yeah man haha some random off comment about brave means my screenshots mean nothing lmao ex dee
---
I only want more nebulas variety, they're boring right now. Also more space environment like twin star systems etc.
---
1 - he was bait?
---
we are but be aware that you have to make your own content at times in FW (its still great for solo but thats not for everyone) 
---
Those who take payments to protect them are *part* of the problem.  
---
**The people making these payments are the problem.**
---
Ultimately this is a CCP issue
---
are you new to how renting works?
---
if you want KWG gone, pay some merc to remove them.
---
if you really want to mine, dont do it in highsec. any nullsec alliance has access way better ore, and buyback programs to sell it to. 
---
Theran is an alliance.
---
More balance changes less fancy graffics plz
---
Never seen someone lose karma that fast 
---
since its mostly just a skybox wouldnt it be possible to add as a "legacy" feature in the settings? 
---
good chance im grossly simplifying it rn tho 
---
It's amazing isn't it :) 
---
I have no direct knowledge on the matter, but a thought comes to my mind: did you started locking &gt; have frigate light up mwd or did you have frigate light mwd &gt; then started locking? 
---
In the first case, based on no evidence whatsoever, I can see an argument being that the lock time is only calculated at the start of the lock, so turning mwd on after you started locking does not affect it. 
---
Agreed. I like the different colors that identify the empire space but for null it would be nice to see other colors besides yellow,green,blue and red.
---
No thanks. We used to have 5 or so different nebulas that were randomly assigned to systems. Now we have visual cues as to where we are in EVE and can even determine by looking at a wormhole where it leads.
---
The old ones are also ugly as shit in comparison. I don't remember anybody complaining when they were updated to the new ones.
---
No. The "green" sites are anomalies. You don't have to scan them. The unknown ones are signatures, you have to scan them, then they are known to you. If another player enters the hole, they are still unknown for him.
---
Seeing many anomalies in a wormhole is usually a good sign for you: The hole is not farmed, it seems nobody is living there.
---
If you're not Roxxen, you're a director. You have too mucb knowledge about BSC's operations to be F1
---
Sice different teams are working on each, you can have both at the same time. 
---
Whar else are you going to use a Titan for?
---
G A Y
---
I want the WH effects not just to be a sky box, but actually affect the star. Especially red giants etc.
---
I'm a senior year economics student, but sure, some random asshat in a video game knows more about it in his ancap fantasy land, lmao.
---
And here we have the one and only Suitonia. A person who loves the game. :) A true CSM representant of the community. Unlike half the csm who only represent themselfs.
---
I am not saying it should be just rolled back years, I am just saying the general look was nicer IMHO. A lot of great features today, just could be brighter, bit bigger and covering the stars. 
---
I quit EVE for a year, back then Brave was not aligned with TEST to my knowledge, nobody can keep up with everything and Brave's never really been something I paid attention to, besides knowing they're a good newbro corp.
---
Confusion vs mental retardation 🤔
---
&gt; Also i'm fighting in delve . While you fight in Branch and Dekklein. But you must be sour for this maybe?

Well, right now you are fighting in Init renter space : Fountain, but you are maybe too in denial to see it ?

"why are you providing facts while I'm trying to spin muuuuh must downvote"
---
I'll never get whats so cool about killing stuff that can't shoot back an then brag about how mean you are.... Thats a kill that happens 100 times a day in some form or shape and yeah cool, you are a Bada$$ guy in game, I get it... Well done👌
---
That's my best guess tbh, although I've noticed when ratting in sleeper sites that the lock time often from 10s to locked in a couple seconds when they start burning towards you.
---
wew nav still playing nice
---
i second this
---
Oh wow ok thanks I didn't know some anomalies were always revealed.  I'll keep this in mind.
---
Who cares about angry Russians? They’re just nerdy spaceship gamers like the rest of us.
---
That Vigilant Tryannos guy is pretty good, 7th corp and with no members! I wish I could join.
---
Here's one of Suitonia's [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEgThIUyfOA). 
---
Sorry, don't speak triangle!
---
vni is the best
---
Yikes that was pretty cringe to read.
---
I feel bad for the poor guy.
---
Even just grabbing 2 or 3 corpies, jumping into some t1 frigs or dessies and having a fight with some enemy militia that had taken over a plex in your system. Win or lose it was fun times :) 
---
You make some pretty dumb assumptions in his thread dude.
---
&gt; outproduce NC/PL by a factor of 10 and outnumber them 2 to 1.
---
&gt;something has to change.
---
Start with the obvious first, NC/PL Leadership have not adapted at all and are in danger of dying due to consistent mismanagement.
---
half the map yikes lmao, smoothbrain wins again
---
Memes are getting deleted by modzis, sorry bro
---
Br? 
---
of course we are, but it's only those who aren't completely idiotic, like you are. 
---
fucking 2019, when 3 paragraphs require tldr because a dumb shit doesn't see any pictures to help him understand without having to go through the "tough" process of reading. not to mention the title is self-explanatory. 
---
Ive been trying to get oue bots but its really hard when CCP doesnt ban them. They just skill extract and join a diffrent corp. So the present themselfs as just another new member to some corps. 
---
Players really shouldnt have to be the one policing the bots. 
---
Shits fucked but still gotta try
---
In this case, I am sorry to say it, but LSH are stupid, you should know that by 2k19 every Goon cap has a cyno and vomits every Titan/Super/FAX Delve has in stock. 
---
the memes died when i died friend
---
This but unironicaly 
---
Why not add a T3 Bomber class that is specifically tailored to kill supers and Titans? 
---
They need to be useless against anything below supers and titans. 
---
Im still stuck on the you saying goons dont use their super fleet. Its used everyday in delve, albeit delve is very safe. We used them continuly in the summer war. Panfam and gotg just wouldnt bother undocking to fight us. 
---
To me it just looks like one is in potato mode and the other has medium or higher graphics
---
yeah so thats a fucking lie
---
Lol theres the fucking wrinkle.
---
Well you should know me :P
---
roof roof
---
Fit in real well with pantsufan. 
---
Valk why you reimburseing ??? As far I understand I was the only one to try and  
---
## defend
---
in etehernity they bought veldspar as semi decent prices. SOmetimes i have some characters there if i dont want go to trade hubs.
---
And forgot to turn on its tank. Only 400k damage dealt
---
I sat and laughed about it... So I couldn't of took them seriously./
---
You spent this entire thread making personal attacks, and then finally answered his first question with
---
&gt; I also have 0 evidence myself of KWG botting as I READ ABOUT IT (AND YOU CAN TOO). 
---
Just lol.
---
Seems like it..
---
Dirt n Glitter for USTZ, TMOCC for mid scale EUTZ, Khanid Propulsion Systems or Space Brewery Association for small gang / solo EUTZ 
---
Goddamnit. I actually agree with this. I feel dirty.
---
I told da goons to shoot me.. Didn't see them blue so I went on killing round :)
---
use this: https://forpeetsakes.com/superrussian.html
---
He doesn’t need to provide proof to the community. We all know. It’s no secret
---
Blue who
---
Kick you
---
We are fine buddy.
---
It was issues here and there. We wont say anything about what it is but Theran has its right to say what they feel.
---
This, basically. This is a pretty good post. Others are such shit I hate my life for having read it. Still my favourite guy on reddit.
---
Get to null as soon as possible.
---
Hi-sec is for steers and queers. 
---
'сало уронили' works too
---
Hi, I posted the original screen. I removed it on Jesse's (Theran CEO) request because as of 2 days ago, BSC is kicked from Theran and apparently some info in the mail is thus now inaccurate.  
---
Apparently Roxxen is a mongoloid and this is not real. But take it with a grain of salt as to what you personally believe, and if you want to take his word for it. I took it down because the guy was getting a rash of shit for it and as someone who has had to deal with diplomacy and the consequences of babysitting a fool before, I can take some pity on the guy.
---
Oh look, that's my ass when I eat spicy food.
---
Who was that?
---
hi sharex friend how is u
---
no risk no gain, the last thing this game is people being too scared from even making an attempt
---
wasnt ironic
---
Why dont you report him?
---
I recommend looking into WWB/Casino War. The rivalries and shit-flinging in 2016 were unreal, and quite funny.
---
I see The Culture is still alive.
---
What a load of nonsense - the only existing evidence was in the form of someone ratting out about his own botting enterprise, and then leveling the blame at others - but the only evidence that guy gave was about his own bots.
---
Look I'm all for witchhunts, but we need to up the fucking quality of these. Otherwise the genuine causes get lost in the swarm of shitposts.
---
So what they going to leave the dark side of the Moon to the Chinese? What's the plan for that side?
---

---
Yea I don’t get it either.
---
Oh no!  Goons are in our comms!!
---
No that wasnt the retarded thing he slipped up on, it was the account sharing like a big dum dum. If he had RMT hed be banned on everything.
---
There it is
---
I really can't agree with you. I love the new visual effects and especially compared to the old dull ones.. jesus I can't even find words that stress that enough.
---
Got any proof or ?
---
What he said, although 'Сало уронили' is the proper spelling.
---
this is what happens when mummy never stopped reading you Mr.Men books
---
Sure. That's what *your* wars in EvE are.
---
And they're not going to change unless you want them too. EvE is pretty cool like that, now with how moon's don't scale like they used to, and large alliances can survive in a single constelation. Wars will be fought for other reasons.
---
Now is the best time in the game to have a war for the sake of *having a war*. With the huge build up of alliance isk. All it would take for the next great conflict is sticking to principles, forming up, and having fleet fights on the daily without the intervention of amassed supercap forces ploughing down onto every fight that can potentially be escalated into a supercap fight.
---
Perhaps we need a space-belgium. Or a Space-proxy-war where Capital wings are out-of-range and the forces deployed are a steady stream of subcaps into staging areas. 
---
**TL;DR**: EvE is what you make it to be. I personally think we're arriving into an age of player-driven content over game-driven content, and perspectives need to adjust for the overall health of the game. 
---
I can never get my toons to look like that. What are the settings?
---
JF is a real pain specially from the east, to be honest.
---
2019 eve is just noobs like yourself throwing shade over each others botting empires yikes
---
Check Time Gold member contracts especially those "2 frigate BPC for 8 bil"          
---
They just moved out of KWG as rats are fleeing from sinking ship - but you can find plenty more contracts like this in the current KWG corporations.         
---
Aka stuff like this : https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/292332328972189697/326374732448399360/2017-06-19_155628.png
---
Good job ;)
---
Try “Ебать-ка мой лысый череп блядь!»
---
Perhaps that's why the game is spiralling downwards.
---
Laziness, and a lack of drive to change the staus quo, Nobody left with the willingness to 'rock the boat'
---
So you are catching ratting / botting supers. Got it.
---
You were on that fraternity thread yesterday defending them? Political narrative much? I see no evidence provided by yourself
---
I believe we recently evicted them from Feyth, and I don't think they've been in Paragon Soul at all.
---
What if they're fitted though? I remember fitted tech 2 fitted frigates with rigs, and they would end up at 8m or so, venture even with meta modules can't be that far off like 2m.
---
I was agreeing with you...
---
The origins of the Goons and TAPI vs "everyone" war goes all the way back to TRI leaving the DRF, leading to a chain of wars for over a year before hand that ended in that conflict.
---
Gimme some purple 
---
Business is business 
---
Look where your most valuable pile of assets is. Check on dotlan, who lives there. Try to join them or one of their allies. Then you have access to this stuff again. Stay with the group for a little while to find out if you like them. If not - evacuate everything to HS and leave.
---
It's completely normal to have stuff in some weird places somewhere. Just ignore it, it's usually not worth to put a lot of effort into "rescuing" a few pennies.
---
Truth is, currently the game is dead with regards to wars.
---
It happens everytime there is a war, amazing memes, good fights. Then nothing until either CCP fucks up, Someone commits child assault or some other drama happens.
---
r/eve has cycles. But its still better than Failheap
---
No means no! Consent is important. 
---
Hiring/headcount decisions are real. They can spend the money on devs instead of artists. This is a stupid refrain. 
---
I just added some old screenshots from famous TIME GOLD corp doing a lot of shady stuff all the time.            
---
Hell i call it RMT officially.      
---
They just moved to Fuel Blocks ... and guess what now we can blame TEST for letting them do RMT stuff in their space.            
---
Sole reason why i want KWG to go away - **so people "protecting" them cannot constantly say "hey this is totally different alliance not us. Talk to their leadership!"**              
---
Roxxen isnt Theran diplo, so those informations cannot come from him, its too detailed to be just foolish words. Its clearly coming from alliance leadership.
---
btw BSC didnt leave they joined again.
---
Anyone knows what alliance he's talking about that is gonna merge tho ? 
---
Posted some evidence if you wish with explanation in some other post here why i want KWG gone.      
---
If you care to read. 
---
Renters feed a carrier and for some reason a dread to bombers which then get blapped by INIT. Why sour?
---
shame on you for killing a defensless player. Don't shoot him. Help him get his ship to safety.
---
wow rude
---
Included some screenshots that i had ... old as i cannot do more now, but at the same time it is good that they are old.       
---
Like for so long time no one cared in KWG about the issue.        
---
Now TEST will have to take responsibility for TIME GOLD actions ... and this is whole reason why i want this alliance to go.          
---
No more anonymous booting and RMT under KWG flag. 
---
Imagine sitting on a plane next to someone who doesn't stop talking. About 2 hours into it, you get a great movie recommendation, then it continues for the next 7 hours.
---
Have you cared to click links on the bottom of the topic ?           
---
Like what do you need more?          
---
Well it's all a learning experience. At least when you manage to do that kind of thing alone you get plenty of direct feedback. Make that mistake in a huge TiDi brawl and nobody will probably ever tell you what you did wrong.
---
Except this is Init. in fountain, not every goon super/titan in delve.
---
Yea, NCdock are such pussies they wont even welp their entire super fleet to us goons for life brother
---
Do I look like I know what a Jpeg is?
---
So what is better - uninterrupted operation or forcing them to move and restart operation ... and getting black listed by new groups as long as they hear you on the comms. 
---
as kingtuttutt would say, meh
---
Want some butter to clean it off? 
---
Make your own 
---
I often intentionally bad post to keep the flames burning for one half of the people and make other half laugh.         
---
Funny fact is that i don't talk much in RL.         
---
Guy that is codding for 12h without saying a word ... its me. 
---
Probably. The damage from a direct doomsday hits 9 seconds after the animation start though, so you should not activate energizer before the animation hits you
---
damn.. would've been nice kill.  
---
Cool vibrator 
---
More devs doesnt neccessarily mean faster development speed. But sure, there are more factors.
---
do tracking disruptors affect npcs? bout to run some missions in an arby with three equipped and dunno if im wasting my slots
---
Then it was awfully retarded for Panfam to pick a fight with TEST amirite?
---
yeah, why can't everyone be blue and mine
---
once in a lifetime ^^  catching a Mwd phantasm at zero..
---
Is that before or after weapon tiericide?
---
I've been posting some good memes but the nazi mods keep deleting my posts.
---
No ewar doesn't affect regular npcs, it only affects sleepers in WHs. 
---
Fair enough. 
---
We've fought you before, looking for more good fights in the future!
---
Imperium Legacy did it 
---
Kill goons. Good
---
&gt;Moons don't scale like they did before (unless you have eleventy billion krabs to mine them
---
Is there actually a lack of moon miners? Do nullsec alliances look for moon miners?
---
You are so bad at posting too
---
That's not unique. You will express yourself through different channels of communication in your daily life. This feels a socialization need that everyone has. This channel, the r/eve channel, is very comfortable for you.
---
U r a dumb
---
Sounds like there is room for a competing service to be set up.

I wish we could go back to stront fueled red timers.

What do you mean you're not happy making 50m per trip using 6 alts and a 10B capital?
---
&gt;It's the EVE that was always going to happen.
---
Dude there's a million things that CCP did that lead to this, and another million things CCP could do to prevent this. Current state of EVE is a result of the deliberate push for more money. Funny thing is, EVE was doing pretty splendid financially before CCP fucked it up with their greed. No idea how it's doing now tbh, but I wonder if Hilmar wishes he could go back to how things were.
---
Sometimes people don’t think it be how it do, but it do
---
I will pretend you didn't say that.
---
Yea the math on this gives ~15% bonus SP maximum for an x8 rank skill like BS, trained from 0.
---
or you could just not mine...
---
Shutup broski we were all there once

DOOOOOUUCCCCHHHEEEEBAAAAAGGGGGG

Do you want to start World War 3 is the real question here...
---
TBH this region could benefit from having a gate to Curse (i think it is more closer to this region) so hunters could move more easily in there.         
---
**But no i am not asking for this.**
---
Nope.
---
If he even does I wonder? 
---
I´ve moved stuff in larger quantities once in my eve career when the corp was relocating back from an "operation" so to say. 7 days, 11+ hours a day for pretty much zero reward. It was a pain in the ass and I swore myself to never do such horseshit again. 
---
I imagine flying logistics in the big alliances is somewhat chilled but moving stuff for smaller groups is not the nicest activity from my limited experience. Add on top, that those groups usually not live in the "best space" and don´t have any kind of logistics network like a "space interstate" made of upwell structures and voila, this whole post makes no sense. 
---
Neut/Nos works on some. Scrams also work on some (and are even required, like for npc haulers). AFAIK damps, disrupters, and ecm don’t, but I think they even might work on some of the new ones. 
---
You missed an opportunity to make him sing on comms.
---
Lmao this thread is me right now, I haven’t subbed yet just trying to get accustomed to the changes. I haven’t figured out how to adjust my probes yet.... it’s like 5 years ago I was drunk and logged off after some exploration. Now they’re stuck.
---
Feels bad I can’t fly some of my ships but it’s probably for the best since I have like 40mil isk to my name.
---
Shhh
---
Thinking about joining Odin's call to live the Wh life, any tips/advice?
---
they lost a frigate, stop getting your panties in a bunch over nothing.
---
we formed against you, even out numbered.   then you brought your pet.  and we go "ok we were ok fighting a bit outnumbered, but 3 to 1....."
---
if test wont even form when they outnumbered 1.5 to 1.  why should we form outnumbered 3 to 1.
---
tell ya what. come fight us when your outnumbered 3:1.  then you can cry on reddit when we don't.
---
btw, nice to see Test the "strong independent alliance who don't need no goon" wearing that goon pet collar with flashing LED lights.
---
spod bless
---
Looks like the transition occurred today and all of my accounts appear to have been migrated successfully. Woo! The only thing that's jarring is that less accounts appear at one time due to the smaller list but I will probably get used to that. 
---
Anyway, THANKS FOR MAKING THIS SEAMLESS! You (or whoever was the main developer for this) is entitled to One (1) beer or One (1) CAWFEE at this year's Eve North!
---
yeah, which is why this makes no sense....
---
everyone in general chat was confused what is going on last night. still waiting for an explanation.
---
150 more titans lmao
---
Except I said that from the very start?  If you have time to waste reading the garbage I wrote above. I really just said the same thing over and over to help old mate understand.  Have I found another dude who can't read? :non_shocker:

Gonna have to recommend POS Party. Great group of dudes and dudettes POS Party Time! Is their public channel I think 
---
Can i watch? :)
---
heads up for anyone doing Amarr FW: Navy Apocs and BPC are going for great prices for some reason right now.
---
like 600m for the hull and 440m for the BPC
---
\&gt; Fewer accounts, because smaller list
---
If you have the screen real-estate available, resizing to make the launcher taller will expand the user list along with it. :)
---
I really appreciate your posting here buddy, it's great not having to be the most retarded person in my thread &lt;3
---
Using prntsc should be a bannable offense
---
Fozzisov wouldn't be as bad if capitals could actually be used in conjunction with subcaps to clear citadel spam 
---
So saying botters are the problem and this is a CCP issue, is "throwing shade"? Outta here boy.
---
Didnt legacy just boot them out of feyth? Or what's going on down there?
---
a shit post yes but a welcome one 
---
Yup. I usually keep it small though. The launch groups should really mitigate all of that. Just set up a bunch and they appear to work fine!
---
poor Carlos :(

F!

think he’s referring to mr olmecagold himself 
---
just saying when you entertain it yourself its hypocritical as fuck and hilarious to watch
---
That's really great
---
I mean NC/PL doesn't have the toons to do the GSF model. 
---
The historically depended on being one of the few groups that used there supers, but given the mentality among super owners changed from i want to use it to i want to make more of them this model isn't providing the influx of members it used to without them having any adaptation path. 
---
Yeah, for sure you almost always hear it about undocking and not staying undocked. I don't suppose it comes up very often that someone acquires so much loot in one undocking that their ship and cargo is now costly enough for the rule to be relevant.
---
yay, here comes the 6-Officer-Scrams-Rorqual, totally reasonable fit
---
this ^^^^^ but you can ask your friendly local industrialist if they have a google sheet they'd share
---
Oh okay thanks
---
Scram is also required on the wh drifter
---
I can see you are man of culture as well.  
---
Why not.
---
Yes : apply 
---
I'm working on being able to build one cap a day
---
All actions in eve are based on 1 second server ticks for processing, ie if you lock say a cruiser not using it's mwd and he turns it on while you are locking, it will take until the next server tick for the sig bloom change to take effect. Sure you ain't confusing this for a bug?
---
Imagine being so bored of your alliances “bluetral” status with everyone that you shoot neutrals.... only to be screamed at by multiple FCs that you are shooting neutrals.... why not just join an alliance that has the fun you’re looking for without the red tape?
---
Hmmm, i think LSH is not the entity having problems with killing Supers. I am pretty sure that the monthly average super kills of LSH is higher than your total ...
---
&gt; Apparently Roxxen is a mongoloid
---
yes 
---
Nope, but the lp stuff sells nicely in Rens / Hek 👍
---
Oof. There will be someone in your pubbie alliance botting too. Come down from the high ground sir. Whatever you interpret is going on here doesn't change where the problem/blame is.
---
We all want this.
---
im pretty sure  locktime is "dynamic" because when i turn on my NSA halfway through locking frigates it usually goes from 14+ to sub 5 immediatly
---
You realise that 9% difference is practically nothing u less you are bringing in trillions of isk.they are being 'fleeced' about 90mil of every billion, and that's IF they sell to buyback. 
---
The issue is there is no insensitive anymore to leave the winning team, culturally the bears won in the past people logged in to fight, now day's people login to grind isk ( part of this is injectors because there is no longer a limit on the usefulness of isk ). 
---
I dont know abut you  but I am rating in 5 titans and have around 20 rorqual mining atm 
---
Isn't it the TEST blob who's backing them up now? PGL's botmoney fetish demands sacrifice.
---
Well, I guess it's better than the Fiverr incident
---
You sound like you’re in an abusive relationship with PGL/TEST. Kicking a larger Corp over one dude? Seems extreme. 
---
'Only literally the exact same amount as the largest most prosperous entity in the game and not a si gle 0.1isk lower' - This guy, probably. 
---
Mcav is recruiting for maximum nano memes
---
F literally unplayable
---
I wouldn't say there's a lack. What I mean by "they don't scale like they did before", is that there's a limit to how many moons an entity can hold before they're not producing any isk. 
---
A small entity may be able to consistently mine 5 moons (for instance), but if they have 20, they can't feasibly mine everything because they simply don't have enough people. And if you're a strictly PVP alliance, you probably don't have many members that *want* to mine the moons.
---
Before, all you needed was one guy with a JF to haul moon goo once a month or whatever. And your pvp alliance still has the alliance-level income to operate and offer things like SRP.
---
The point of all this is that it's more difficult than it used to be for small entities to make alliance-level money off of moons, which makes small entities harder to maintain. It's much easier to just join the big dogs.
---
Gimmie dat 4D flowchart-infographic pls
---
I strongly suggest to get familiar with filters. Not filtering your probe scan window will leave it as the bloated thing it is.
---
Lol at someone in the imperium.caring about newbros. 
---
Test is truly autistic all the way, lol.
---
He's updated OP with links now.
---
Thanks StainGuy - this is all I asked for. If you want to make allegations and lead a movement alleging things against people, you absolutely must provide evidence, otherwise people will just turn away immediately and it will put NO pressure on the alliance to do anything.
---
4 accounts $15 X 12 = $180year in subs not including plex 
---
everyone knows hk proper is just pl alts...
---
how dare he shoot something other than a structure
---
Larger alliances can afford to do things cheaper, news at 11.
---
4 accounts 15 x 12 = 720 a year not including plex
---
Name and price them, please. 
---
Don't kink shame me. 
---
Even CCP Falcon apparently doesnt give a ship about Omist botters. Cant deal with their main isk/sov holders without banhammer, but CCP just slightly touch their shoulders with N vni/gila bans twice a year.
---
HAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAH, a Volta guy saying we should pay more attention about the bots. F u, dude. Your entire rental empire is f\*cking full of them.
---
the killmails are like right there on the killboard, not like he awoxed a full fleet, its like 10 guys, why would u even need a game mail smh
---
Sorry, I don't speak rush B.
---
Don't take this as saying we're not big but HK is still only like 80-90 people counting afks. Our big posted in advance corp meeting about what we were doing next after getting evicted from Rage had about 50-55 people. Thats tiny by null standards and we're the second biggest corp in w-space.
---
Prob the "Not one of us mentality". People will stand by guys from their side saying the most retarded shit. But the second their FOTM enemy says it, it's bad bad bad from the ground up.
---
Have to laugh at the idea of you viewing him as obsessive when we are talking about EVE Online on Reddit of all places.
---
He often writes some real stupid things but in this case bots are bad. 
---
&gt;Maybe if small roaming gangs didn't get shat on by magically appearing caps there would be more fun.
---
People keep saying that but I have yet to actually see it happen.
---
Hello Friend,
---
Please take this one on over to r/evejobs 
---
We have an entire subreddit dedicated to this :)
---
Course I do. If newbros don't stick with the game, things get very boring for us a year from now.
---
Allow us to add notes to the accounts aswell please too many accounts to keep track of. Very confusing
---
Sorry if I missed the explanation before, but isn't sig only relevant when you orbit someone? I always thought that if you keep range your "transversal" will be shit and sig isn't much a factor.
---
I hate all these game launchers that are full of ads (especially ones with distracting animations). When I open a launcher I literally just want to launch the game, not see a bunch of bullshit. There's no reason for advertisements to be taking up 75% of the space.
---
I submitted a feedback thread back right when they released the new launcher and the adds were taking up 2/3 of the space: https://forums.eveonline.com/t/beta-launcher-feedback/134877
---
Looks like they've increased it to 3/4 now.
---
LMAO xDxD You know you can pick any flair you want on here right? 
---
Someone needs to do it good job blue donut to massive lol.
---
Oh wow look at that. Theran kicks BSC, begs me to take my stuff down, then immediately re-adds them

I honestly use Google sheets for this.

LOL. Here is your upvote
---
CCP: You will take your ads and you will like them!
---
I do too but I'd rather not have to look at sheets if I could just look at my launcher
---
It seems a lot of botters are russian, why is this? Is botting/rmt more accepted in Russia? Or are most not russian and I’m way off base.
---
This is obviously fake, there is no mention of Sue dropping Raitarus.

Goons are polarizing at best. Many hate us and some with good reason. I am not going to sugar coat it.  We relish the role of the bad guy.  To respond to Olmeca there (who I have no issue with BTW).  We really are not doing things that others cannot.  We can only have access to the same game mechanics, same ships and same items that everyone else does in the game.  There is a big difference to our internal focus - when you start in Goons there is a whole culture set up to make you successful, and wealthy in game - so as to get you into a super or titan.  Other groups have their own culture, and own focus.  This means that many have different approaches and ideas on how best to govern and guide their group as a whole.  Their level of success shows how well they have adapted to the current state of the game.  In earlier times we were the losers of a major war - the Casino war (WWB for everyone else).  We lost our home, many members, and were largely crushed.  Now we have Delve, Rorquals and Titans.  We adapted, survived, and overcame.  Where is their casino now?  
---
As for the balance suggestions, some are bad, some are slightly flawed, and some are actually reasonable.  Others specifically target Delve and thus Goons, and are explicitly designed to harm us specifically.  Its part of the hate all Goons thing.  Its pretty blatant at times, and I encourage you to look with a dispassionate, logical eye.  You will see what I mean.
---
In fairness to you, I must reiterate that I am far from impartial and am a Goon.  But my experience with toxic behavior has been limited to minor things like people insisting on ruining their steaks by cooking them FAR to long.  But then, as a Goon I am treated better than those who are not.
---
sounds like it.
---
It means you're not aware of the current state of play on the game, which also means your defi ition of what is 'fair' could he wrong too. 
---
If you don't know one thing, it means you don't know anything  
---
:thinking:
---
HAHAHAAAAAAAAAA
---
DnG has memes for days
---
Already dropped one :P
---
I do. Personally I wish we could all stop fostering botters and RMTers but calling out one alliance doesn't accomplish anything, esp if you seem to have something against said alliance. The incentive to move before their competitors do is exactly 0. So for the amount of shit posting about botters here on Reddit, the only thing we can do as a community is as a whole stop involving ourselves with bots.
---
Nope, we sat outside a station extensively testing lock times with mwd's on and then off. Same lock speed.
---
A anchor bubble to works pretty nicely if you're doing a shattered or wolf rayet
---
It should really wait for you to log in as an alpha before trying to get you to upgrade to omega, though. No point in advertising something I already have 
---
There is more than enough room for a convenient launching interface where you would have real reorderable and manageable groups, labels and notes for accounts and showing characters/ships/locations on moseover together with a lot of fancy adds. Really doesn’t take a genius to figure out what we need and doesn’t take a genius to code, it’s just a fucking webpage.
---
mining is so boring and less profit!
---
Don't get me wrong, I think the launcher is rubbish... If I get bored over lunch I'll show how it should be done. 
---
Here you go: https://i.imgur.com/aLAhxqj.png
---
Most chats add : after the name, hence the no need to add extra : there.
---
That's because you're in Horde (assuming no flairbait) and Horde actively outlaws anti-content cap dropping.  Other groups have no such conscientious objections.
---
Good question. The factor that affects tracking is the signature radius. 
---
Apocalypse: 380m (a battleship for comparison)  
---
Mobile Large Warp Disruptor II: 450m  
---
Mobile Cynosural Inhibitor: 400m  
---
Mobile Micro Jump Unit: 50m
---
HAW Titans have no trouble tracking a battleship, and since anchored bubbles and inhibs have similar sig radius and don't move, HAW Titans will be able to track them even better.
---
well, if there are 4/6 unknown signatures, the wormhole is almost clear of data/relic sites. most of unknown signatures are wormholes and gas sites, if you're lucky enough you can find a fresh site just spawned, odd but possible
---
cant wait to see theran get ripped into tiny pieces also,
---
Reason theran got in trouble with winterco was a corp left to join frat jesse Alliance xo decided to try bully them with 12 hr evac assets order then proceeded to Revoke All winterco docking at theran structures.
---
But on side not thank fuck i left that piece of shit alliance who thinks its more viable to buy ore form goons and transport to wicked instead of mining it on  the moon they already have.
---
Some people just want to blow up spaceships, and don't care for admin work.

Then you've got guys like me who remap to Charisma/Willpower and then start doing racial hulls. Some say it's because we play hard-mode, but really, we just want to watch the ~~world~~ star cluster burn

RDGR RDGR.
---
I'm balanced remap with a training clone due to not trusting myself to stick with a plan for a year
---
The problems with POSes were all backend.  They were AIDS to set up and maintain and gun, but as a content generator they were basically ideal.  The proper path for citadel combat mechanics was "POSes, but easier", not "space fortress with magical damage immunities".
---
I mean provide us with loads of freeport astrahus in the region for us ganker to stage out of and I'm sure Omist will just be , a few jump away :)
---
Oh wait whats that ?  You dont want to financially fund structures in that area so that we can easily gank them because they'd pew pew them and kill them , but you want us the wildlings to do the job for you ? 
---
Sorry , I'll harvest tears and kills in easier accessed area's then .

It would be cool to reorder the accounts after you pin them to the screen.

Sometime  ago i read a people saying the efective Yield of a fitted rorqual as  18400 m3 by minute.  Yesterday i catch a conversation in null about that  for a multiboxer saying the efective yield is around 13500 m3 per  minute, for him, when t2 is colocated and already kissing the rock.
---
Anyone can tell what is the real yield for a optimal and by a decent t2 rorqual non perfect ?
---

Interesting. TIL. Come to Geminate people, the content is fine.

Are you new to the concept how mercenaries work?

They are hired guns with questionable (at best) moral standards.

If you pay them and your opponent has more money than you have, guess what happens then? Seriously, think befor you comment. 
---
Grats on your undergraduate dreams. Maybe next semester prof will teach you about how a corner store can't operate on Wal-Mart's margins. You can come apologize here when they do, if you want.
---
But there was no damage cap, people had to keep them fueled or there was no "fuck you" reinforcement, the defenses were dynamic (spread out to make fleet positioning important, not just coming from a center point) and the number you could drop was limited by the number of moons in a system, giving some strategic texture to a region so that every system wasn't so identically defensible.  Oh, and you could bubble fuck and kill them if there was shit hiding inside.  They were infinitely better than citadels in their current state.
---
You were able to do this on the old launcher too. You had to click and hold at the bottom of the "account" bar than drag and drop to where you needed it. Just was a faff
---
It was a bait Titan? So... Uh... Bait?
---
That's not unheard of for corp level logistics.  It gives some buffer in case something screwy happens.  It's what we used to have people set it to in STK.  Most of the time it ended up being same day or next day completion.  Other times it might take a bit longer if there's a strat op, or not enough freight to justify the JF run, or someone camping a midpoint in a super.
---
Telling everyone set an arbitrary 30 day stopped people from putting in silly deadlines for their non-essential freight.  
---
Dealing with rectifying failed contracts is also a pain.
---
'Course they can't, and I don't expect them to. You're still gouging even after factoring for that.
---
VNIs are fine for most DED sites, too, if you pilot cautiously and clear web frigates and towers promptly.

The game can sense when you've finally found something worth doing, and responds accordingly.

There are several new player friendly corporations that take in alpha clones and show them the ropes.  I belong to one (Karmafleet) and we have fleet doctrines (official fleet builds detailing ships, modules, expendables etc) built around alpha clones to make them as useful and dangerous as possible.  Many of our other fleet concepts allow for alphas in a useful role as well.  It works for us in a couple of ways - free alpha clone alts for established members for specific purposes,  and to get new player members involved and having fun.
---
And as others have said, P2W is not really a thing.  Player knowledge and skill is more important.  I love it when a wallet warrior buys their way in to a big expensive ship, fits it in a retarded way because they don't know better and bet blown to bits.  We even recruited one of those a while back and started training them how to play.  $$ does not equal winning.  And there are kills of big expensive ships like super carriers by groups of small cheap alpha clone type ships like thrashers to prove it.
---
Kind of yes. Or it feels when you get to excited and decide to kill your confidence 
---
Goon ore is the cheapest in the universe though.

Fuck, this amount of multiaccounting going on really kills my iniciative to get to the game.

CCP is notoriously slow when it comes to authenticating access for people's accounts, iirc.

Not surprising, since what you did kind of fits the profile of what an account hacker would do - they're probably making sure they dot every i and cross every t before restoring access

I've been playing on/off for pretty much 10 years so don't feel worried.
---
Nothing wrong with starting with 1 account and sticking with it for a bit. I didn't get a 2nd/3rd until year 3.
---
Everyone starts somewhere. 
---
I think a similar thing happens when you turn on sensor boosters, but it's important to note that that's a stat change on your ship, not on the frigs turning on their MWDs, which may be the key difference.

I know i can play just with one acc (well, at least while i stay in Highces doing missions and stuff), but it really looks intimidating to a new player. Not that i was not aware before, but i thought most people have like 3, maybe max 6 accounts. This is just too much for me to bear. :)
---
Still bigger than the corp wallet :O
---
Big difference in blueing everyone and picking a two front war while outnumbered.
---
But whatever helps you swallow that terrible decision by PanFam.
---
Your logic is flawed.  The 2000 char alliance was only competetive because they had an SP and Asset advantage.  There is a reason why people call the low sec groups, 'bitter vets'.
---
Is this your 128th post?
---
Well it is a "separate alliance that just rents stuff from them".      
---
So they can wash their hands off from any operations they make.     
---
In terms of Fuel Blocks (where the TIME GOLD moved) is like ... you know you fucked up test and we will tell you on reddit 20times a day Test ... you know this.         
---
Aka they need to do something about it, like kick this corp out. 
---
Oh yeah, it's like I said, it definitely wasn't smart on my part. I just hoped it'd be handled in a timelier fashion, guess I'll be more patient. :)

why is it that every idiot thinks they have the perfect idea to fix the game with like 1 shitty idea is beyond me now every day on this sub reddit is just pure garbage and they miss super important factors and just begging for karma fixing this isnt simple its a long conversation not just nerf reps hurr durr delete supers hurr durr null blobs hurr durr its just getting silly now

Make Legacy/Test/Brave alts if you want to burn the region. Make it so the bots cannot trust their own.

Don't you tell me what to do with my Base 15 charisma pilot :P
---
Lol, GOONS sigs were up north for months dunking horde and gotg before the dec.
---
The first keepstar battle where goons tried to slowboat fighters from their supers on their citadel over to ref the KS happened before the war dec.
---
The Northern war heated up after the southern war dec because you split your forces between North and South allowing a major numbers advantage on both fronts.
---
Anyone saying PanFam going after TEST was the right move is an idiot.
---
I'm way too lazy to min max that shit. Until about a month ago I had never had any of my alts in training clones either.

Is it worth getting into now? I have always heard of this game and honestly it seems like a game I'd love. I'm just concerned because of how old it is, does it seem like it's on the decline?

always shoot, even when they think you're blue/light blue/was blue once/worked together one time or another or some shit. It's the snuff way.

I've found them to be pretty quick actually. I had an issue that my mail provider activated greylisting so all auth code mails would arrive with 15 minutes delay and I wouldn't be able to receive them. Got my first answer after less than an hour and the issue was resolved after 2-3 further mails within less than a day.
---
Why WR specifically? 
---
Er nope.
---
Cloaky camp and push them into smaller and smaller area. 
---
At some point they even start to pay you to leave them alone. 
---
When I have sigs running around my space dunking my allies, I go punch someone bigger than me in the mouth, because smart?
---
Also other than Sigs, the goons super fleet was deployed north before the southern war dec.
---
I have been playing Eve on and off for 10 years and for some reason when I apply to corps most people just never respond back! I would love to join an Amarr RP group but are those even a thing any more? Do you have any tips on how to join a corp?
---
Same is going to happen as long as it's Imperium, you know what I mean. 
---
It affects how fast you can travel. When you jump you get a Blue and a red timer. Red timer prevents you from jumping. And Blue timer makes you’re next red timer longer. Blue timer goes up every time you jump while it’s still active (there’s some nuance to this but let’s not worry about that now) and by jump I mean take a Titan/blops bridge. Or jump a capital. (So any time you jump WITHOUT using a Jump gate.
---
Exploring can be fun and quick way to make some decent isk, mostly from relic sites. I made about 500mil my first 3-4 days of casual play. Considering I did it mostly in null sec
---
Yeah, I *meant* to badpost!
---
This is a consequence of the 1hz tick + network code.  You can observe the effect with the NSA system on a carrier.
---
What is happening is that it takes the server over 1s to tell you that you are locking faster.  The steps are simple to reproduce.
---
**Slow Locking:**  
---
Start Locking Something  
---
Modify ScanRes:SigRadius ratio (on either end)  
---
Observe at least 2s+ lock time on any ship  
---
**Fast Locking:**  
---
Mofidy ScanRes:SigRaduis Ratio  
---
Start Locking  
---
Observe locking at least 1s faster  
---
I hate to ask the obvious stupid question, but you weren't testing against interceptors or HACs were you?
---
I am suggesting anyone who cares to do this. There are plenty of groups who will show up if you can tackle a super. 
---
Cool, everyday i learn something new. :) I'll look into it, thanks.
---
Agree exploring in Null or Wormhole space is a great way to make isk and learn some fundamentals. Then decide what you really want to do. I hear incursions are good too but I have no experience with that.
---
hello it's tomorrow and here I am; your booty looks good from this angle

T2 AB is 3 mil not 10 mil man.

injectors just suck
---
also, look into this: https://zkillboard.com/alliance/1614483120/reset/group/1250/losses/
---
If a system has few signatures (the ones that require scanning) then scan down the first wormhole and move on. Your most fertile ground for exploration sites are systems with many signatures. Some seem to tend toward predominantly gas sites; others mostly relic/data. 
---
\*popcorn.gif*

Nope. Testing on a shield dessy, then on a shield BS. Both times lock times didn't change.

Only one of those panels in the screenshot you've shared is an ad, the rest are news items and dev blogs that are pulled from eveonline.com/articles.
---
While the purpose of the launcher is to launch the game, it's also there to inform players of changes, upcoming features, downtime information and a whole host of other communication that we need as many people as possible to see.
---
The launcher is the primary way for us to make sure that information we want players to see is viewed by as many people as possible, as it's a gateway through which everyone (who isn't using third party launch applications) is accessing EVE.
---
I don't think you need to apologize - I was going to post the same video. OP tried a rapid light caracal but might not have flown it the way Suitonia did (kiting). I'm using this fit now and working my way up to T3s. You will have a hard time with the drifter battleship if you encounter it - suitonia says he dies 2/3rds of the time to it.
---
It's a good video, worth watching.
---
Im pretty sure lock times always were dynamic and changed based on the targets sig radius change. I believe this is broken atm.
---
According to IoI they can cover up 85% of the screen before inducing seizures so CCP is still good.
---
Sorry no.

This is something that's being considered by the launcher team, custom names for accounts so you can change the appearence of your account name in the launcher for better identification.

No ETA on release for it though.

Ignore defensive Citadels. Shoot defensive Fleets. Form engagable gangs.

Laziness is on both sides, each side has access to oppressive and unfun mechanics, like the afformentioned citadel spam. But I premote that if people want to actively change the current downwards trend of the game, you have to *trend-set.*

---
They mostly wouldn't, so no changes there. Players currently do not risk supers *with* fax support, because they use fax support to ensure they're playing in a no-risk situation. When they actually encounter a risky situation (dropping on even numbers of hostile supers/titans/fax) they usually stand down, because losing that fight would be catastrophic for a sovnull group. 
---
Fortunately, that's not the aim of this fix. There's probably nothing that will make people eager to risk assets they spent 100+ hours grinding for. 
---
The aim of this fix is to make it worth bothering to risk more affordable assets (dreads, carriers) in fights, because you're not running the risk of instantly getting hazed by a supercap fleet that you can't/won't fight with your own supers. 
---
People will always be super reluctant to actually *risk* supers - we need to change it so risking them isn't mandatory for content in sovnull. 
---
You are doing it wrong then...  I can make a video if you want...

Was bored over my lunch break and thought I'd take a crack at how I'd do the UI design on the launcher, and seeing as CCP seemingly has such a large amount of free space to put ads I thought I'd ponder how the space could be better used.
---
1 panel per account, icons to signify omega and multiple character state, I'd overlay how many days remaining on top of those icons at the top but that was too much effort for lunch. Buttons to launch the individual characters without going needing to go through the splash screen.
---
I'd probably put a notification bar under each character name showing an icon for mail, notifications, at war, but again, finding suitable icons was too much like hard work for the time I had available. 
---
All account / character names picked at random by grabbing random details off zKill. 
---
Without using a gate was the key I needed. Thanks!
---
Yup, someone hasn't been paying their rent
---
This makes too much sense. CCP would never do something like this.
---
God damn that hurts to watch
---
Well, that *and* a gate.
---
Sorry goons, I have just been told I might be getting blacklisted, just for killing you.  What will I do,, Is goons recruiting BTW?
---
yeah i came in here like ooh someone to shit on but this seems like a service that isn't super but is in bumfuck nowhere and is some guys trying to make it work - jfing is a monumental pain in the ass and they may not have the volume to make cheap JFing viable.
---
asking for 30d to complete is a bit much but the rest is like, if its that terrible someone else can start up their own once the first guy proves its viable
---
Anything related to a hacking/rmt case will probably take 3-6 months. It's cheaper to lose players than to pay enough support staff for complicated cases. 
---
They probably have. 
---
For worse. :)
---
Eh I just stick to per/will and don’t use a clone ‘Cause that’s shits too expensive to lose to forgetfulness. 
---
Incursions are an excellent way to make ISK as well,  but you’ll need to train into a battleship (which, on an alpha, would take about a month) and you need starting ISK.
---
So salvaging/exploration would be your best bets at first.
---
You mean new people to the game? 
---
Sorry, we did not know we were such a bother. Sorry for disturbing you that much, we will get better, i promise!
---
I mean they die allright. But on the other hand they always come back. So maybe it doesnt work after all.
---
Saw this and was wondering how you got this on launcher.I tried the new launcher and was not impressed went back to old launcher this is good.
---
I mean, for a few accounts, it's fine. But you get the nerds that have 10+ accounts, and then what?
---
You sure about that? I mean, a gate from Curse to Omist sure is something this community can get behind no problem!
---
You’re so dumb lmbo
---
Have you been watching Swampletics ?

Most public JF services and even some single-group services include collateral in their price calculation, mainly due to it being ISK frozen for JF pilot moving for sometimes several days (you have to keep quite solid liquid wallet to cover collateral), especially if you don't get enough contracts to make trips very often. 5% is a bit high, but not unreasonable.
---
F. That hurt.
---
Technically someone could just *make* a launcher like that. The API provides all the information and you can get a launch token for your accounts somehow. 
---
I don't know the specifics, but ISBoxer has a custom launcher that works, so it's possible.
---
If you are around this weekend, come fly with me. Showing is better than telling. 
---
Oh hey, its almost as if ccp were to look at what their customers need in a feature and build the feature with that in mind it would be much more useful to their customers. Instead they have a business or design team stepping out and producing garbage no one wants that's wasting everyone's time.
---
It's 3D printed with gross, but inexpensive and readily available, resin. Gives a whole new meaning to 'fine motor skills,' doesn't it?
---
&gt;There used to be fights over them, at least.
---
There are plenty of fights over citadels. 
---
Feels like it's missing the wallet, but other than that it has most of the important stuff. Seems people in this thread are whining about a whole lot of nothing.
---
A t1 ship is okay,
---
along with a billion isk worth of implants.
---
I constrained the width to have less empty space on the screenshot, full screen 1080p could easily accommodate 10 to 15 accounts :-)
---
F LOL was not expecting that.😂😂😂
---
Then think about hiring mercs with morals !  "Intro song"  The A-Team !!!!
---
Try it out for free using an alpha account, if it's not your thing or does decline you haven't lost anything
---
&gt; Injectors are the great equalizer, and modern eve reflects that.
---
And yet even is in arguably it's worst state in at least half a decade. Not only do injectors take away from supers being an accomplishment, but now that everyone has 3 of them, fighting usually ends up with someone dropping caps which forces the enemy to run away.
---
What will likely happen is that supers and titans are going to be nerfed into the ground (whenever CCP gets around to it), and then everyone is going to bitch about how their fancy supers are useless. And it's all because skill injectors made them far more prolific than CCP ever intended.
---
How tf are people taking this bait lol
---
Not everybody can.
---
With Rorquals CCP did work hard to cater rich elite high skill elite groups. You have to invest billions in ship and drones, it has relatively high skill requirements, much lower if you already have skills in capitals. It scales very well with multiboxing. Skills can be bought with injectors, but you have to be able to afford that beforehand. It's a big "fuck low skill casuals".
---
The problem of NC., PL&amp;Co is, that the gap in numbers became huge over time. They integrated so few new members, that they fell behind despite all the advantages they got from their high skills (both in SP and in player skill) and game mechanics, which highly reward these. If "n+1" becomes n*10 in characters and n*50 in real players - of course they can't be on top any more.
---
This is completely their own failure. And it's not irreversible. If they change their policies and start to build strength in numbers, too, they can turn this around. Would take several months, but not years. But I see no will to change, it seems they enjoy whining and playing the victim card.
---
I liked the clock on the launcher. Sometimes i ran it just to make sure i wasn't late for an op.   
---
I actually came here today to say that.  
---
Dunno if yours was different than mine, but mine already had ship skin/omega ads. I like it other than the clock. But i was using that, CCPls bring it back.
---
That's why he wants the clock back
---
Yeah, I literally hold them hostage you silly fuck
---
Remember that the belts re-spawn after downtime, so the closer you can get online and start mining after the restart, you'll have a better shot at the +10% ores.
---
If they care enough about this reytarded shit to send a mail, I'll reimburse. 
---
Wow sounds cool maybe the headquarters in Old Man Star system..
---
Getting out of your implants to pvp is annoying. 
---
Bingo, +5s and full accelerator time when they're available is enough for me
---
👀
---
Brave is with TEST/Legacy since at least early 2017, and nothing changed in that matter.
---
That's the equivalent of saying Detroit's airport is an international travel hub. While it's technically true, it's not like LAX or heathrow
---
LOOOL this is another Gem !
---
How am I supposed to keep track of how long I've been complaining for if I don't have a clock?
---
Make sure you're following whatever process the corp has for applying.
---
For example, Dreddit has a process you have to go through that is spelled out on the wiki.  The *last* step is applying in game.  If you don't do the earlier steps, the in-game application isn't going anywhere.
---
So, google the corp to see if they have a website/wiki that goes through their recruiting process.  Also, Show info on the corp and it may show their process or list a recruitment channel where you can ask what their process is.
---
So, to rephrase: just go to your nullsec megablob new player corp of choice to further fuel existing dual powerbloc null structure?
---
It's a good vid, thanks. My caracal was more tanky but no dps mods and that was probably the problem?
---
Is pretty pathetic how salty you guys are acting right now thanks for the laugh tho
---
if you eat enough taco bell, you might find some rare tri-stainium.
---
See, now you say that, but I find that hard to believe.
---
I was there last week with like 10 jackdaws and we had 2 haw revs dropped on us every time we tried to engage.
---
OMG ... and you actually believe that. I mean 6 assault frigs would spread havoc in theran, why would snuff care ?
---
The obvious solution is to have an arrow button to hide the news posts and make the actual launcher larger space.
---
LOL while it looks awesome, do you know how long it would probably take for the launcher to launch when it has to do ESI lookup on all those characters? You would click the launcher then 10 minutes later it would finally open. And half the characters would probably time out and not display updated information.
---
Usually joining a corp involves more than just sending the app in game if that’s what you mean by applying. 
---
Forums have a recruitment section and are probably your best bet as you can search for exactly what you’re looking for.
---
Most corps will have some sort of application process you’ll need to follow and usually involves some sort of interview and stuff before joining. 
---
You can't get the characters tied to a specific account nor gametime through any API. You'd have to enter all of that information manually.
---
&gt; Players really shouldnt have to be the one policing the bots. 
---
No, this creates a much bigger problem.
---
why are you and people like you so firmly against ccp hiring developers
---
the reason we don't have a balance team is because they don't have the personnel, like wtf
---
The game is "on the decline" in that it's a 15 year old game.  All 15 year old games are on the decline.
---
However, that doesn't mean it's empty or unplayable.  As long as "enough" people are playing, it's still a good game.  We are well above the threshold for "enough" and should stay there for the few years you are looking for.
---
Based on CCPs ability to add bulk operation API commands... I'd say... hmmm... maybe half a second to load 100+ accounts if calling the API asynchronously :-)
---
I'd recommend a smaller newbro corp over them if they could prove they offer similar levels of activity, resources, and staying power.  
---
However, I don't currently see any that do, and the idea of a new player joining a corp that doesn't help them much and then collapses a month later doesn't sound like it'd be a responsible recommendation on my end.
---
Don't we all just keep falling for same scams over and over again ?
---
Well I can't personally guarantee every roam good content, but the rules do exist.  They don't apply to PL or NC, though, and they're currently around our space a lot more than normal due to goon and TAPI deployments.
---
It's also possible you were inadvertently interfering with a strat op or something.  Or you're in Taperium, in which case all bets are off.  Or someone broke the rules. YMMV. \*shrug\*
---
I rest my case
---
I got yer eve memes right here bruv \[Yeah, sex is cool, but have you ever...\] ([https://imgur.com/toqLCai](https://imgur.com/toqLCai))
---
\&gt; 5 days ago ... right now
---
Indeed. And I would like to clarify that ads were in the launcher before we made this change today.
---
You’ve just described the highsec war that’s been going on, where it’s mechanically impossible to use caps. We’ve had some great fights almost every day up in Perimeter, it’s a fantastic source of content.
---
No, no you cannot with a usable fit. A titan gets a +10 warp strength per level bonus, meaning at level 5 you have 51 points of warp strength. A heavy warp scram II has 6 points of scram. A rorq has 7 mids, meaning that a rorq can apply 42 points of scram, assuming all mids are fit with scrams(which most super hunters dont do). This is below the titans warp strength. So no, a rorq could not hold a titan. Yes you could fit faction/officer points that would put the cost of your rorq up to ~40 billion, but literally no one does that(because having a rorq that costs as much as a super is stupid). Go look at any of Ivana's tackle rorq losses, and you will see that they use t2 scrams. 
---
how do you get the old launcher back?
---
Except for the three massive titan on titan conflicts, and all the various lesser battles.
---
Dont be too harsh on the lovely newbie in his titan.
---
Sorry, but that is the essence &amp; sole purpose of Imperium Homedef Umbrellas, denying content. So sad that it backfires, who would have thought ...
---
scroll? look on right side of your browser, most browser should have scroll bar here and i think it should not be hard adding  this to launcher 
---
I joined an awesome, smaller Null corp in a beast of an alliance and started krabbing and murdering things. A few really elite FCs make the search for content reliably productive.
---
If we had that kind of war every two months no one would be left playing, because leadership would all burn out or be curled up in a corner. It’s a lot of effort to prosecute a war in EVE.
---
uhm, i would like to create bingo-like game in eve... I always thought it will be a hole in the water
---
please get rid of the shitty launcher all together. 
---
I agree that maxing out attributes for a skill plan is still an important part of an EVE character's development from roughly 20 million SP to about 70 million SP or so, assuming that the character in question is intended to be balanced.
---
But outside those limits, at the low end there are significant downsides to shifting attributes -- in particular, if you have to shift training suddenly due to requirements of your alliance, for instance. And above the 70 million SP mark or so, being 100% efficient about attributes matters less and less as your capabilities increase.
---
The impact of learning implants becomes much greater than being efficient about attributes. And for unbalanced characters (dedicated supercap alts, dedicated industry characters, etc.), being efficient is either very difficult or doesn't add enough SP to be worth the trouble. For example, a dedicated super-carrier alt has to be able to switch between aggressive skills, support skills, drone skills, and possibly even leadership skills.
---
I really wish CCP would get off their asses and delete attributes from their game, convert learning implants to skill training accelerator implants, and give everyone a flat training speed. Attributes add literally nothing to game play except unneeded complexity. But that's a whole other story...
---
At this point I have all the skills and shit I want, so I just have flat attribute cause I don't care any more
---
I care
---
Wicked Creek is an equally terrible route.
---
It’s amazing how fundamentally you misunderstand basic game mechanics.
---
That's a really great print for something with that many curves
---
Take my upvote, you monster.
---
Just change back to release in settings https://www.eveonline.com/article/pm92cc/new-launcher-changes-coming
---
Murica numba wan?
---
Most groups do a percent of collateral because things like BPOs are worth a tremendous amount of money but take up no space. There’s a limited amount of isk JF pilots have to cover collateral, so if you drop 70-80b of it to cover a titan BPO, you have none left to cover anything else, and end up hauling a single 0.1m3 item in your 350ish k m3 ship.
---
The isk to real money ratio makes it more worth the trouble in Russia/China.
---
In America or Europe, the actual money made by botting would be so little that it’s not worth the trouble.
---
Ironic that “the people’s” regimes resulted in countries with people willing to bot for money decades later.
---
Literally glad I only have 9 and am not a nerd.
---
F. That made my dick hurt watching that, good on ya for having a sense of humor about it.
---
Lots of someones are going to die when they don't notice the change and don't see a cyno on overview that opens right next to them.
---
You could build in a scropll function. 
---
And then cap hits zero...
---
How to delete my eyes?
---
fucking so true though with all those titan pilots
---
not enough rorquals though
---
I started eve a few days ago and have been exploring some systems between security levels 0.3-0.8 with the Heron. I've looted some stuff that's worth a few million ISK but I can't sell it where I'm hoarding all that stuff.  
---
How and where should I sell it? Isn't it a big risk to put all my loot from the last days in my ship to fly it to the next grat trade hub? What's they 'usual' way?
---
Mine enough to afford a probing/hacking ship, train mediocre hacking and probing skills. Go to null sec do some googling and hack sites till you make enough money to inject enough SP to fly an exhumer. Join a null corp with a super umbrella or rent. Get an exhumer and mine until you have enough isk to inject skills for a rorqual or buy a rorqual alt. Join a super umbrella without renting. Get a rorqual. Use the rorqual's income to buy new rorqual characters until your computer cannot support more instances of EVE. Get a super alt and a super when you feel like spending a risky 1% of your total wealth. Laugh when people destroy a rorqual or excavator of yours thinking they impacted you even slightly. 
---

---
vs 
---
https://zkillboard.com/group/365/stats/
---
We can clearly see that even with the current tower losses the citadel + tower fights come now where close then the pre-citadel area tower fights. 
---
The idea that citadel fights replace tower fights is silly. 
---
I see you've got everything figured out.
---
 Huh 
---
The premice that ad space is "wasted space" is likely one that will fall on deff ears at ANY buisness. 
---
You also have no place for news and updates, update bar, version number, settings section, Account Management, pin vs no pin on accounts, or the ability to launch into Singularity.
---
Overall, I feel like this was made trough the sole lense of a player. 
---
Finally, I will also point out that the way the sign in process that EVE online uses works, this kind of launcher would be impossible. Maybe some day, but until that is announced, swapping toons without closing the client will remain as the longest asked for feature in New Eden. 
---
The folder icon, while understandable, is clunky. Why not simply add a right-facing carat or shaftless arrow to indicate an expanding menu? Similar to the Start Menu circa 1998?
---
Heh, I didn't even realise that. It was server-side rendered in PHP and for things like the skill training, its progress, their money etc I was just using RNG to either select from a list or pluck a number in a range... and it still gave half the characters Amarr Titan *boggle*.
---
I really like the approach of adding a placeholder group in the overview settings until the patch. I'm not certain it's a new thing, but I've never seen this happen before, so it's good to see
---
What is more exciting and profitable for a new player?
---
And the 10 minokawas each feeding at least one remote cap
---
This will still be ccp's fault though
---
rofl, omg, sorry, I think I cracked my ass laughing :D :D :D
---
Love you CAS guys, feel free to come by unannounced any day
---
It was only after we had gone off to do some small engagements did we realize he shot our only sabre 😭 we missed out on quite a bit of horde kills because of that. should reimburse us for the missed loot 
---
I can't wait to see Reddit flooded with salt posts complaining about cynos 
---
This would be perfect.
---
Downvoted for directly linking the CCP cancerforums.  
---
&gt; You also have no place for news and updates, update bar, version number, settings section, Account Management, pin vs no pin on accounts, or the ability to launch into Singularity.
---
Dude. Dinner only takes 20 minutes to cook. Heh. 
---
Lol when we do any partnered engagements and goons see you now. Fucking dead. 😂
---
You can assume Omega status by the skill that is in Training and if it isnt paused etc.
---
needs a way to change to sisi, duality and thunder
---
A lot less excited about this once i re-read the title and saw it said "overview" changes. Feb shaping up to be another patch with 0 promising updates. I guess the [https://updates.eveonline.com/coming/winter/](https://updates.eveonline.com/coming/winter/) site saying balance was happening in winter, actually meant spring/early summer.
---
I mean, we did inadvertently come during an op, but we weren't interfering with it. We were just fucking around with some battleships on a gate. I'm not trying to sound salty, but it was shitty, because it literally just denied content for both sides.
---
fuck everyone, tbqfh
---
Sure, but when you have people with a ton of accounts, this is going to be way more annoying to use, than just a list like we have now.

Yes. I've been through Perimeter, and was unable to not warp into the keepstar grid and appreciate the Ferrox on Ferrox violence without a HUD.
---
He is still camping. How can you even "evict" a camper lmao. 
---
I liked it for fleets too
---
Seriously man, back when the bug where a kill report wouldnt generate with gate guns i killed a brutix in a rupture and i never got a way to brag about it :(
---
Not as elite as solo play but there’s lots of opportunities for self-directed roles in fleet pvp. If you’re bored of smacking f1 on command try flying support stuff like tackle/dictor, ewar, or logi where you’re more on your own to react to the grid and think for yourself
---
Man its almost as if the players know what the players want and think it condescending to say "I know what you want better than you do."
---
Update bar and version # are literally a banner 15 pixels wide across the bottom.  Settings? A year wheel next to the close "x". And news? What a joke. If you think players care so much, leave a box for news the size of an account we can unpin immediately. 
---
That hurt so much, let out an audible “Ohhh...” on the bus haha
---
This is a pretty good shitpost.
---
Wait really? Your going to get black listed for shooting goons?
---
This goes back to the whole "adapt or die" thing. Sure, they failed to adapt. But perhaps that's because they never wanted to adapt. Not everyone wants to be a massive krabfest of an alliance. 
---
It's sad that being a skilled group of PVPers isn't viable anymore because who wins is decided by who has the biggest idiot cannon.
---
Yea I'm at a point where I just jump around skills training whatever random stuff is left to level 5. Getting sp a little faster isn't going to make a huge difference on my ability to fly anything at this point so why bother
---
I probably did have the ads before but they weren't in your face like they are now so I never noticed.
---
Oof.  Right in the gut
---
lol POS party is exactly what he is describing as what he does not like.
---
God bless
---
Test gone NRDS, don't you know?
---
It's more a ratio issue between the amount of people that want to mine moons and the number of moons, the reality is eve has to little players for the amount of moons it has. 
---
This means everyone that wants to mine a moon can have a moon to mine end result no conflict. 
---
LTPDS Question (Long Time Player Doing Squat):
---
What's up with the systems like  [**FDZ4-A**](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Geminate/FDZ4-A) where that "belong" to the Society of Conscious Thought? Are these systems like Syndicate, where Sov stuff doesn't apply?
---
I like the digital negative one best, great aesthetic. The synthwave one is pretty good but would never pass ccp. 
---
So the downfall and now death of Hotline is a long story with many different reasons and contributors. I will try to summarize but prepare for story time. 
---
When I first joined Hotline it was at it near pinnacle of existence, 20+ man 100mn tengu fleets flying against horrific numbers slaying caps and supers left and right. Led by the mighty Sten Taxi it seemed we were invincible and that the fun would never stop. Our videos were awesome and captured our aesthetic. 
---
Alas these golden times could not last, faxes were becoming spammed more and more, capitals were becoming plentiful. We started having to retreat from more fights, losing more ships, missing kills and ultimately being defeated more. This has a certain strain on the morale, maybe pride, of a corporation renowned for killing capitals and fighting against the blob. 
---
As a result, Sten decided to step down from ultimate leadership of Hotline and appoint O'nira and Thornir in his place. This gutted our fleet numbers as our heroic general was gone, O'nira is a great guy and I mean respect but he didn't FC like Sten. We went from a period of multiple cap kills daily, to maybe one a day then eventually to seeing them as a rarity. We simply didn't have enough people to break spammed faxes and survive carrier fighter spam. 
---
Activity was slow but constant, people plugged holes where was needed and kept the buzz alive in corp. Cap kills may not have been the plat de jour but we were finding more fun in smaller scale fights and limited roaming. Some internal drama emerged from people dogpiling vnis and killing fight potential and flying hyperspacial cynabals to whore on kills and being useless in subsequent fights but that is barely a factor. 
---
Then it happened. Sten and O'nira left for SkillU, taking a good handful of talented (Pikachu) and active players with them on the promise of capital and super kills. Many who did were rewarded with just (jfc Pikachu leave some for the rest of us) that but it was as if you had cut the head and heart out of Hotline in one blow. Many content creators had left and many of the founding members were gone. There was a certain sentiment of betrayal among some who saw venerable wormhole nanogangers folding and joining a dirty nullsec capital blob. 
---
Thornir stepped into ultimate command with Stephan as his director. He tried various things to get people engaged again but it was ultimately futile. Individual hunters and content creators were being leant on too heavily which led to a huge amount of burnout. Around the same time I was made a director too, a role I was probably unsuited for due to my time restrictions. 
---
Thornir eventually burnt out and, after much deliberation as to the continued life of the corp, gave leadership to Stephan. Again, Stephan made a valiant effort but the writing was on the wall by his point. My playtime had become next to nothing due to RL. 
---
Come the summer and I returned to the game to find an inactive corp, a frustrated group of close friends and a seemingly unclimbable hill to return Hotline to glory. It was at this point that my close friends and I decided to pull our assets out and leave finding some success in our own wormhole and then flying with friends but that's a different story. 
---
Now we venture into the realm of second hand information. With my close friends and I gone, others were forced to step up and be Hotlines content generators, roles some were uncomfortable in. I believe Stephan was a main contributor and made a valiant effort. They did some joint ops with sound and other groups but eventually Stephan made the decision to close it down. Assets were evacuated, Vice was sold on to sound and Hotline K162 was transferred to one of Thornir's holding toons.
---
Many EU pilots went to Kingless, many US went over to sound and SkillU and some I believe went to Volta. 
---
That's the story of the fall of Hotline K162. 
---
I personally hope it will rise again to its former heights but the realist in me doesn't see that possibility in the current nullsec climate. 
---
Long live the A E S T H E T I C .

I was in all 3 of them. all of them were horrible slugfests where nothing worked, mass dces occured and generally no fun is found. 
---
I know you are a koolaid drinking drooling dinobrain, cornak. Hopefully you are not comparing this "war" to any other war that we had before the fozziesov / citadel era. 
---
But it already is set to release version.
---
This game sucks.
---
So, by your logic, their bots are getting banned or suspended then and Legacy is giving a shit and kicking them out.
---
That and also moons aren't fun to fight over anymore, so that's not helping either.
---
It's only the launcher, lower right hand side next to the online player count. 
---
All of this is entirely correct and I'll add one element. Lots of people know instinctively that even the largest guns can hit a small target really hard with near maximum damage if the target is unmoving or has very little transversal. This is why things like Tornadoes work even against frigates and the like, and why capital ships can routinely hit and kill pods.
---
The *reason* this works is because of a little-understood element of EVE's [tracking mechanics and math](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Turret_mechanics). While damage can be reduced due to the signature difference between a weapon and its target, a much bigger factor in EVE's damage is the "to-hit" chance of the shot. If the "to-hit" chance is very high, the damage will tend to be very high and vice-versa.
---
The to-hit chance is based on a complicated formula that works out to 0.5 raised to the power of a calculation with two factors, once based on the tracking of the shot, the other based on the distance of the shot. If the target is within optimal range, the second factor drops to 0. If the target is unmoving (or otherwise has extremely low transversal), the first factor drops to 0.
---
0.5 raised to the 0th power is 1... a 100% chance to hit. This raises the damage done by the shot considerably, and is a big reason why titans can shoot down pods. Since the titan is barely moving and the pod will generally either be stationary or moving very slowly, the titan gets 100% of its enormous gun damage directed to the pod. Even after the modifier for the differences in signatures is applied, this is still usually more than enough for a titan to one-shot a pod.
---
Compared to this, a 50m signature radius on a MMJU that is guaranteed to be stationary makes it a very easy target.
---
&gt; Ignore defensive Citadels. Shoot defensive Fleets. Form engagable gangs. 
---
They will just blueball you. welcome to eve. 
---
You can understand the frustration your players are having with this layout being essentially nonfunctional, right? 
---
But where is the space for the plex and skin sales? 
---
That's a ton of effort for a mock-up, I figured this was just Photoshop or something lol
---
If you play it, the way you described - I agree
---
While this is good, let me say one thing CCP
---
If my accounts are already all omega, DON'T SHOW ME THE UPGRADE TO OMEGA AD ON THE LAUNCHER
---
Nobody cares how you spin things at this point, every change is MORE ADS!  MORE NEX STORE!  MORE MONAAAAY
---
Could easily just have a toggle for showing this view or list view, and could even load the same information in list view on mouse over or something.
---
So why no option for players in the know to have a functional launcher?
---
Or are players in the know intended to use said 3rd party launcher, since 3rd party has been better than ccp at pretty much everything they've done
---
To evac loot it's a good idea to use a different frigate with a stiff tank that's fit to instawarp. The main danger area is the gate connecting lowsec (≤0.4) and highsec (≥0.5). Be sure to scout the gate and never warp blind from gate-to-gate in case there are smartbombers waiting. Once into highsec, you can fly normally to a trade hub (do not autopilot). 
---
Alternatively, you can explore for a wormhole or chain of wormholes that lead straight into highsec, thus bypassing the LS&lt;-&gt;HS choke point.
---
The second danger area is docking at the trade hub. You will often land 2km outside of the docking radius and be vulnerable. It's a good idea to use an insta-dock bookmark well within the docking radius, or to warp in from a different angle where hunters are not positioned.
---
With multiboxing, it's more of space RTS than space RPG, game's still fun regardless.
---
No space for SKIN ads and advertising omega to omega-only customers - outlook not so good
---
1. technically you always risk losing your ship when you undock. It's part of the appeal.
---
2. a couple million of loot will generally not attract any unwanted interest.
---
3. The [biggest trade hub](https://eve-marketdata.com/rank/markethubs) in the game is 'Jita', some smaller regional ones are 'Amarr', 'Dodixie', 'Rens' and 'Hek'
---
4. Make sure you dock at the right station. All those systems usually only have one station on which all trading is done. E.g. 'Jita IV - Moon 4 - Caldari Navy Assembly Plant'
---
As soon as you can get your stuff to hisec - you are safe. Noone is going to shoot your Heron (assuming you are not auto-piloting it) with a few million ISK. There still is a probability someone will do it for gigs, but it is below the floor.
---
Also, try exploring in WHs, it is both higher risk and reward, but Risk/Reward ratio is still much better than doing it in LowSec.
---
The thing is you need a critical mass of players to achieve anything, you won't get that critical mass if you well can't get players to believe in your cool new plan. 
---
The secondary issue is the majority of players will ask you how much isk per hour this is gonna deliver.... 
---
i love this
---
The flairbait 
---
A komodi would have probably died there.
---
50 dreads sucking your cap gets you dry very fast.
---
And in that Situation triage took loads of time to get in. 
---
fuck snuff
---
I mean that doesn't help but people would form fleet's if the economics made sense ( and going from the mechanics for fighting are shit but where still trying to get the dam moon to it's fun is a shorter path then nobody cares about the moons anymore to fighting for moons ). 
---
Took less time to script it than it would have taken to photoshop tbh. I just defined some accounts / characters in JSON and then used a few loops to spit them out. Any changes can just be made in the source then F5'd vs having to change multiple layers each time in photoshop.
---
Of course, it's completely non-functional, and in reality it would be made in Javascript and load the DOM elements in dynamically, but I didn't want to burn that much time when I've got an actual working sign-in system I have to get back to and finish for work.
---
Was he really ratting in a haven? 
---
So YOU'RE the one who stole MyOtherAccount69! 
---
Wormhole relic sites :) just stay in c1, 2, or 3 space and only do the ones with pirate faction names ie. Guristas, sanshas, angels etc.
---
Seeing a show tonight. I may just try ordering one. Thanks!
---
I also don't want to see giant ads in the windows of fast food. I also don't want to see trailers for things other than movies when I go to the theater. 
---
Your right, those things are relatively small at the bottom, my point was leaving them out proves the design was not taking everything necessary into consideration. My point about arguing that ads are not valuable space falling on deaf ears is the main one. 
---
No. it meant winter.  It didn't say what year.  Are you unfamiliar with CCReeee's dev cycles?
---
Looking at it right now and see nothing time related. There's tranquility - online (player number) and that's it. Going into the server list doesn't have it either. 
---
?
---
What's your expectations/goals that you are trying to achieve by taking that shot?
---
Why change how cynos work when you can rework how they show up on the overview!
---
I think they're defaulted "on" so it *shouldn't* be an issue... 
---
&gt; it's just a fucking game
---
Keep this in mind and all is chill. Make money, lose money, build an Empire and see it crumble. Enjoy the ride :)
---
It looks like that's currently the case with the beta version but not the release version.
---
as is tradition
---
Why would you run it in a rattle when a non-pimped 450m tengu can get the job done in a 10/10 no time?
---
fite me you filthy subhuman https://imgur.com/a/WCL7alI
---
In a proper non-mock-up version you'd likely just add in the advert blocks between the characters, in the same style, although as the launcher is currently vertically challenged, i'd likely add a few hundred more pixels and put them at the top, if I wanted to be really obnoxious I'd likely do some kind of rotating banner at the top, maybe an MPEG stretched to fit the width with some kind of logo and link over the top. 
---
I mean he definitely shot "blues that arent set blue" so according to valks diploing, yes.
---
Try the beta!  
---
They were in before, however they are now in a more invasive area taking up real estate that used to allow all of my accounts to be listed without the need to scroll from the default launch size, which is no longer the case. This is a strictly worse launcher layout, which seems even performance wise takes more resources. :/
---
How do you find filaments on sisi? I can't find any to buy
---
Well no.  LSH set up a very good trap that almost killed a Molok.  
---
Oh, does your mother know about your sexual orientation?

&gt;erence between: init kills dread bomb, was some good kills.  
---
&gt;And: lol retards got rekt guess they didnt adapt fast enough to our titan blob, look at us reddit, we so elite yet?
---
I don't see that?
---
Please point it out.
---
Nothing but a big fat F!
---
Multi accounts basically come in when you're into caps at the latest. You can technically do one account with caps, but you're ham-stringed as hell. I'd say 3 accounts minimum to properly use caps. Even for properly pulling your weight in fleets you kind of need 2 accounts for eyes/dictor alts/etc. Just kinda how the game goes v0v
---
Does your mother know you are a little bitch?
---
There's a little highsec island pocket called "Actee" next to Heyd. This place is flooded with miners (mostly of blue ice I think) 23x7.
---
If I wanted to feel safe from pesky high sec annoyances and have an isolated pocket to play in thats where I would go. Also suppose having a pocket lowsec system off this would mean you could jump freighter ore/mins right to Dodixie or whatever trade hub suits best.
---
Haha next time FC says "We all know you wanna shoot PGL, even I want to do it, but he's temp blue, so dont do anything" I will  remember you Sue.
---
Well my friend I hope you enjoy your blacklist. 
---
And here I was excited to read shitposts about a cyno spool up or other bad ideas.  Alas no, just overview change.
---
"only" 
---
You're a beta 
---
I am glad you are true proponent for 3rd partying.
---
&gt; We were just fucking around wih some battleships on a gate
---
It’s almost like... horde uses... battleships... as one of... their mainline... doctrines...

Were they traveling to the strat op? Idk, I’ll let you put two and two together
---
You should recruit them, dense as hell but they get the job done.

Try scamming some isk out of matteral, i hear its good moneys.

You're not wrong. Its sad too.

Odins call is good.

So is tuskers (think you need a vouch tho so takes a lil bit of work).

MCAV take every and any fight which is rather respectable.
---
Suddenly content I think is on the precipice of becoming what you are talking about but they do take fights.
---
TDSIN stay away based on your post.

Sleeper dreams is respectable too (they are c4 shitters according to them :P nice guys)

POS party/embersands stay away based on your post.

Inner hell is actually still around but haven't seen much of them to give an honest opinion.

Grey eagles are decent, little blobby though.

The singularity is alright too, they take fights. 
---
Scary wormhole people stay away based on your post.
---
The buccaneers are pretty good, they take fights and win pretty often. 
---
Kronos ritual is good too. 
---
I wish they removed training implants and bumped every attribute up by 5 across the board.  I know implants are a valuable ISK sink for the faucet since they're seeded by NPCs, but I think QoL would go way up. 
---
Sandkrab vs. King Krabs

Oh, you determined its a blacklist all by your little self? Try harder. Go PM Dream on Discord again. Get fucked

They're annoying as fuck on my second monitor.
---
Also, every launcher developer should read about this problem: https://old.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/aj370h/windowed_mode_introduces_disproportional/
---
Basically, when anything animates on your second, lower FPS screen, you primary, higher FPS screen stutters due to a Windows(?) bug. Adds to the annoyance even more.
---
current state of eve
---
evemon has an eve time clock, i always keep that spot on an otherwise empty bit of the screen so i always have it handy
---
I agree with the TL;DR... the space visuals now are way too dark and cluttered. It makes it harder to pick out features (like bookmarks, planets, moons etc) in system from the background.
---
Ideally it would be a graphics settings option you could turn on or off.
---
Amen.
---
possible 
---
i was just giving an example where locktime is dynamic 
---
+2s are more expandable than t1 friagtes, dude. Especially if you only plug in 2 instead of all 5.
---
I've flown that fit a lot in 3's. The problem is, and suitonia even mentions, there is a specific spawn that will be very very hard to deal with and kill you about 50/50. I think a vexor may be a better way to go tbh.
---
Clearly you're making the best of it, lol but why not go somewhere where you can do that and not get "REEEEEEEEEEEE'd" at for it.
---
good point bro...thanks for correcting me
---
i wish we could wage war on ccp in the game somehow, now that's an entity I would gladly hate.
---
2 ads for SKINs, 2 ads for tickets?
---
Yeah definitely not bad. I think I'll stick with the old launcher for a bit longer though.
---
no, there were always constant local conflicts over r64s as "the little guy" could legitimately hold a couple versus a large spread out entity
---
see: PR- pizza moons vs TEST (1:50ish pilot ratio)
---
That isn't a launcher.  That is after you have logged in.   Or can I just pull all that data without having a login?  
---
I mean goons got xtra squishy kicked and blacklisted for putting a damp on a self destructing Rorqual, so I expect PGL is going to have to say Casino War a lot to appease the commissary. And I really doubt they care enough for a mouth breathing retard that used to have a mental breakdown in Hek local if you bumped his neutral guardian alt off the station undock when he was doing Highsec wardecs. 
---
He’s literally the “I have a great app idea I just need coders” guy
---
Dude, just play it as you like. I had one account/character between 2003-2015. I now have two. 
---
Some people take games way too serious. The moment a game feels like work, you're doing it wrong. Right? (:
---
It's a non-functional mockup only to show how I'd personally go about presenting information on the launcher. The current API does not provide all of the information shown here (such as omega status) but it's CCPs platform, and if they chose such a design for their launcher they could easily add it. 
---
don't know, but if you find out, post that all over the place.
---
screw that, give us a stable server at 50% tidi with 6k in local then we can talk about how to fix super capitals. 
---
faster to train into a Rattlesnake, faster to clear a 10/10 in a rattlesnake (Except Guristas). Otherwise sure why not, use a tengu.
---
use 3rd party launcher
---
looks better and better all the time

its right here?

it's perfect in pretty much every way

&gt; A supercap fleet (with proper fax support) is functionally invincible,  except against other supercap fleets. This makes a big supercap fleet  essential to any sov alliance, because it's the only deterrent against  hostile supercap fleets. 
---
supercap will be deserted for dreads fleet.
---
Relevant ad on reddit by the way.
---
it's more fun for Sue (and corp) to watch the responses, even from 'try hard' TEST dudes who take this game waaaaayyy too seriously sometimes. Plus, I'm also the only CEO ever to harness this stallion. None of you could handle Sue for a month, let alone over a year. He's one of many SPVG's silly assassins. 
---
I thought the same about 4 weeks ago and bought my first subscription yesterday...go figure ;)
---
Some shits in TEST are pushing Dran to blacklist him. Like all of a sudden, this is 'try hard' TEST.
---
I'm not a diplo, you fucking moron.

Thanks for the NSFW shit

then go take it from them

don't worry, at least you can now buy the new skin pack for 3500 PLEX with just a click! isn't that what you people want, right? the marketing department can't possibly be wrong!

so you just get some friends and toy with their sov or hunt their renters.

Legion: pre-patch I used one for 5-6 different roles without dying, and is still in my hangar, retired. And it looks fabulous.

Honorable mention for Onyx, which I like for solo gatecamping.

I've never tried... Does the game allow you to declare war on CCP Alliance?
---
You are tackled by a citadel long point (for 30 sec so) and fighter (siren + templar) are gonna it your ass. In what sub-cap do you prefer to be in these conditions?

---
Bragging about how much you mine in a video game
---
yes
---
this is a good post
---
they aren't to blame really, it's the game mechanics. If CCP kept moon mining passive in the game, people wont be in search of other passive methods to generate large income for alliance, you can't expect members to send 50% of the ISK they make in the small time they have to even come online just to fund the alliance, the passive ISK helped.
---
also, like, we`re all fairly responsible here for not wanting to expand or going to war and instead just consolidating in our castles we call goonswarm federation, test alliance, darkness or 'retiring' to old-age homes we call pandemic legion and northern coalition.
---
Don't you think if anyone really thought the space was worth the effort of taking and had the ability to do so they would have taken it already?
---
Working as intended
---
Don't forget to buy the upcoming skin pack for 4000 PLEX when you get unbanned to show your support of CCP great work!
---
I need 2 columns with account list ...... like why 75% of the space is wasted on this dumb shit. 
---
yeah probably. i cant figure out if a komodo in a tidi fuckfest would be good or bad. like anything below 150 titans targeting it simultaneously if its at the magic ehp number wont kill it plus it will get repped to full before the next volley. So either you have to ignore the komodo or you attack it praying that he burns out his invulns
---
But it's not ads, it's ""NEWS""! Don't you love seeing all this ""NEWS""?

I still love my Proteus. I don't care what anyone says about it.

another no-name PanFam retard. Hi Wood Vulcan

even if it does, it would be pretty pointless. By war I mean like a legit war, where we burn everything they have (give us access to jove!)

Yall blob lol. also don't delete a comment because it gets downvoted that's spineless shit.
---
Still doesn't include amount of time left on the subscription.
---
PvE plays pay PvP players to PvE in 'generally considered bad' region that other alliances don't really want. Not that surprising. If someone is willing to buy garbage you can sell them garbage.

That just gives me more reason to approve the thread.

Aren't TDSIN and Scary Wormhole People the same group?

Tristan. Its a cheap t1 gallente frig, with drones, that can  be pretty effective for its size and price.

it isn't even like this is abnormal or strange behavior

a group of good pvpers finding a way to make isk by doing what they're good at sounds exactly like emergent gameplay to me

Make CCP and do this

* Move buttons to the top

* Make sales/skins/plex as a scrolling banner across the bottom
---
* Hovering over account status items (Omega | MCT) will tell you the time remaining on that item.
---
Thanks man. I’m fine tuning my technique. 
---
yeah, but whats sad is that its a group which isn't supposed to be able to hold space so large judging by their alliance size to space, and any large competent group should be able to easily take a chunk of it away but nobody does, even if it can be kept as renter space because everyone is just too busy rorq mining and not having any motivation to do anything, it reflects a sad state of the game.
---
TIL a myrm is a battleship
---
The Megathron. The model of that ship is what made me want to play Eve.
---
You make me blush
---
Hey Grath I've done a lot in Eve but if you have time could you please call me a piece of shit so I can kick that off my bucket list. Please and thank you
---
In my text description I mentioned I'd probably overlay the days remaining as text over the graphics, although having thought about it, i'd also maybe do a very EVE-like cooldown timer and have a cooldown circle around them that showed roughly how long was left (based on subscription length) before renewal or expiry. 
---
ur dum
---
Renting (or vassalization) is one of the few ways PvP-focused groups can make alliance-level isk in the great age of rorquals. Conquest and diplomacy don't need nerfs, apostles do. 
---
I didn't say it was realistic 'at the moment' but I think there will be a turning point. 
---
Some people think that success in game is measured in isk, sure, and EvE allows you to set your own targets and goals. If people want to just see how much they can accumulate with no end goal then, by all means.
---
Critical mass, also, sure! For example, TEST and HORDE are currently reaching critical mass enough for Subcap pvp on a grand scale.
---
RvB reached critical mass quite early on for subcap pvp.
---
All it takes is a group to make the first move, set-a-trend for others to follow, sell it as fun.
---
You can only achieve something you want when you actually try to take steps towards it, rather than putting up barriers. You've got to start thinking in the mindset that it is achievable. Which is why I'm approaching it with positive attitude.
---
I just think change is possible, because
---
- People will gravitate towards the groups that align with their interests.
---
- Groups can specify who they want to take. You don't have to be the biggest to be the most interesting, the strongest or the most fun. 
---
- People can be influenced into trying new things.
---
Eve died the moment it allowed injectors and Plex. It brought in  the no lifer hordes. That didn't have to pay any RL money and could sit in Nana's basement and inject and plex 50 rorq alts. 
---
Who thought it was a smart idea to allow account names longer than the text box, and then not allow you to expand the window to read similarly named accounts.
---
being engageable is a hidden atribute
---
I love my Talos.

It's incredibly good-looking, and has a solid punch.

Honorable mention to the Oracle, AKA midget "Pride of Hiigara"

This gives me a major chubby. CCP needs to hire you.

Um no original removal == automod but that puts an entry in mod queue because we have it set to filter vs. remove (remove puts it in spam queue, filter sends it to mod queue where most of the work is done) - to clear that out of mod queue you have to hit approve or remove which shelby did several hours after the fact

There are websites that let you check this if you're really that bored

Seriously, great work, simple and intuitive UIs are the most difficult thing to accomplish these days. This blows that out of the water.
---
so when your computer makes an internet request like "pronhub.com", networks dont understand words. So it makes a lookup to a name server (like a phonebook) so pronhub.com becomes 72.123.whatever.whatever.
---
you basically edit a file called Hosts on your box (if you're using windows) just say "when you look up eveonline.com/articles, return a bad address". it basically blocks it like a blackhole.

The only mouth breathing retards are the idiots in TEST who are asking for Sue to be blacklisted.

Obviously a myrm is a BC, but that's not really the point. The myrm and the hype were just two ships that I specifically remember being there.

roblox oof.mp3

Personally, I think it's great that one small alliance owns so much sov and fills it with pve retards.

No autistic, oppressive, super umbrella - organic escalating fights against the local pver for the most part.

It's not really what you're stating, even before new Rorqual got introduced, having several bil ISK needed for one was hardly "high skill wealthy" level for most of nullsec. What CCP effectively did was reducing wealth generation disparity with actual skill (not SP) and understanding of the game - around 2012-2015 someone having good general understanding of the game, making correct time and ISK investments and just doing what was the best thing to do was able to generate order of magnitude more personal wealth than average person that just decided to stick with ratting/mining. This could lead to cases of single alliance member having more wealth than the rest combined (including all alliance-owned stuff), but overall meant that the better you were at the game, the more ahead the curve you moved.
---
We moved from best combat pve activity in null being DED sites that required players to actively watch escalation sales, setting up private agreements with ratters, having ships ready/capable of moving around, and taking relatively big risks (expensive ships needed to run DED, and all that during golden era of blops hunting) for extremely high average ISK/h to supercarrier/boson ratting, which is flat income scalable only with time spent online. Mining didn't change that much, but between exhumers fragility and being required to have decently sized mining alts amount (to compare with rattlesnake ratting, you were even at around 4-5 miners if you've got Rorqual boosts available) and benefitting heavily from having those alts planned and specced for other activities like manufacturing/research, keeping cyno chain alts on same account etc.; while now Rorqual income outweights any secondary income sources heavily while scaling directly with amount of accounts times hours spent online. Moon mining and reactions used to be relatively passive, requiring getting online only several times a month to move materials and check extraction/reactions; while now it's just like industry - amount of alts. Also, POS-based moongoo processing created inside competition due to amount of moons in any given area being hard limit of amount of POS towers that could be placed (in some groups even making POS assignments or moongoo access activity/pvp reward for corps or individuals).
---
I can't really say if direction of changes was overall good or bad, but - with all that in mind - I can see some people and groups being annoyed by direction those changes go, where skill and knowledge disparity can't counterweight numbers difference anymore. These are people who could afford flying slaved deadspace-fit Machariel or Proteus fleets and win despite being outnumbered 1:4 only because they were fighting players and groups that would see this kind of ship/fit being extremely expensive and at best to be considered for FC only (to prevent headshots). And since you mentioned NC. and PL - NC. is rumored to be the place where players with high indivual wealth commonly gravitated towards, while PL was well known for poaching skillful members of other groups, mainly FCs and capital pilots (back in the day when getting to afford and have a capital was non-trivial task), so - along with selective recruitment - created over time habit of expecting above average results from every single member.
---
TL;DR: negativity towards current state of income is mainly due to "just spam more VNIs/Rorquals and spend more time making isk" replacing "learn the game, learn how others play and find a way to abuse it for your own gain" as the best general way of getting ahead in wealth race.
---
&gt; I get this suspicion that, after it got really boring and Goons "won", the social orders of the game would break down as people went their separate ways, and instability would be reintroduced because the dominant players got bored of having nobody to fight. Considering the sheer scale of Goons, though, that would take.... a while.
---
You're probably right. The only issue with that is once you have a group that breaks off because they're bored, suddenly the dominant players have someone to shoot. The splinter group will be crushed before they ever get a chance.
---
What you described literally happened on Serenity, and it *literally* killed that server. Everyone ended up in PIBC and they crushed everyone that tried to oppose them.

Something with a low signature radius and an afterburner, to mitigate the damage of the incoming missiles.

I did, I’m saving it for summer. I started in spring and played an ass load over summer last year, but never made enough to plex. So now, I’m going to save up and plex my main for the whole summer, and not have to worry about constant grinding. 
---
There is nothing wrong with that. What would you want, that space to also be part of a super bloc that blues half the game to maintain their security ?
---
Choose another battle this one is stupid.
---
Aye, memes aside I like the new design. I am even willing to accept the fact that quite literally ~52% of the launcher now is ad space.
---
&gt; A komodi would have probably died there.
---
Keep in mind that this was a deliberate bait situation.  If there was a turbo tanked Komodo, the fax wouldn't have been far off.
---
Indeed. Worth watching and maybe even trying it. :)
---
The default launcher resolution takes up 6..96% less space on the desktop than before.  It's shorter &amp; fatter than the old layout, but you can shrink it down further to show one less news item if you prefer, or expand for more.  More importantly you can make it tall again if you want to show more accounts without scrolling, try dragging the edges and find a look you like!
---
Short answer - you don't shoot it.  You risk wasting far too large of a DD salvo to try to bring down a ship that can theoretically reach 200 mil EHP.
---
Because you touch yourself at night.
---
Cheers. 
---
looks like they are doing gods work to me
---
Ray Charles coulda seen that one coming.
---
The new launcher is 6.96% smaller than the old :D
---
If you want to see fewer news items, shrink the width, or go nuts and expand it to show more!  (Drag the edges of the window)
---
At the time of posting it, all content displayed next to the user list was only articles/blogs. Hence "right now". This remained the case until the ad service received appropriate assets earlier today, replacing one article with an ad carousel.
---
If you loose access to a player owned structure(citadel, refinery), how can you get your stuff back?
---
Stats should not even be a thing and implants should just give % of training speed.
---
Had corpmates tell me that they only inject so they dont accidentally lose their training head. Honestly I've had +4s for about 4 months now and never once screwed it up. Just jump out before fleets or pvp. If you get into the habit I find it really hard to mess up.
---
It's amazing how you're ignoring the 5% if collateral and how expensive that makes moving anything.  
---
Also, moving shit via JF to the ass end of fucking nowhere, where nobody lives, is not a basic game mechanic.
---
CCP's support has been stellar the last few issues I had. Got a response within 20min each time (this was not related to account bans)
---
I think a lot (I kid - I'm sure ALL) of legit banned people apeal the ban, with creative and plausible explanations. I think there is just so much BS to waddle through that it takes really long to discern the legit from the "unban my account - I did nothing wrong, I am an insomniac who mines 24/7" rage
---
Thanks CCP for being excellent at dealing with support issues (especially when it comes to harassment and similar issues) 
---
&gt; If CCP kept moon mining passive in the game, people wont be in search of other passive methods to generate large income for alliance
---
If we ignore the span of time between 2012ish and 2016, when two coalitions owned and rented out the entire map, while passive moon mining still existed.
---
There is no concept of "enough" for alliance income.

You do have beta turned on, OP doesn't seem to.

---
Not too pleased with the new launcher. Its primary purpose seems to be a billboard with the game launching function as an afterthought.
---
And in my opinion really goes in line with Eve appealing to different play styles. If you ask me we should all be in an uproar about the pure traders who just sit and market manipulate with vast amounts of isk but it's as valid as me wanting to shoot ships
---

Injectors alone didn't really change much - before carrier changes from May 2016 and Rorqual changes from October 2016 injectors had relatively small impact on individual wealth and power distribution, mainly because if you didn't have good way of making decent income, you couldn't afford injectors, and if you found some solution for catching up to the top, you would be able to afford character bazaar relatively quickly. The disparity between average and great income was still huge, and due to what was available as a method of getting far above average income had very finite capacity, competition there restricted overall average wealth grow quite hard and was mainly internal, so further introducing some sort of availability distribution and control. What in fact caused that rapid spiral of increasing average wealth and reducing meaningful wealth difference was lowering both ceiling (new fighter mechanics for carriers making it impossible to multibox and scale up with reinvesting) and barrier of entry (carrier skills and cheap single carrier are enough for income allowing one to keep farming for injectors with relative ease) to that self-sustaining wealth generation loop.
---
&gt; Ads were displayed in the launcher before we published this update. This is not a new feature.

What if we didn't like them before and now doubly don't like the new focus on them?

thanks for speaking up i respect that and you are right.

Stop being such a cuck. All he’s saying is there’s BOTs down there, and if you hate BOTs and want to kill them go there. He already said he doesn’t have time to run the campaign for you. Do you need someone to scan and call targets for you as well? I guess we have to buy you your ship to?
---
Max tank tackle jaguar. It’s always fun when someone tries to kill me and I just rank them for two minutes while backup arrives. 
---
The collateral % on there is due to the fact that high value low volume items exist, which means if you’re purely charging off m3, BPOs use up all your collateral immediately while paying out nothing because they have no volume. Not everyone has umpteen billion isk lying around.
---
Considering Test and Goons both live a similar distance from Jita, and represent half the game, it’s pretty basic.
---
The Algos. It was still brand new when i started playing i didn't like the Catalyst (still not it's biggest fan) and i wanted to fly drones. The algos is still my favorite ship and favorite destroyer. I am sad there is no T3D that runs drones.

Mouth Trumpet Cavalry [MCAV] (C5 wormhole corp)
---
**Who are we?**
---
Mouth Trumpet Cavalry is a PvP wormhole corporation that is dedicated to taking as many fights as we can. We are a group of tightly knit individuals that enjoy wormhole life and flying nanogang fleets. We take pride in our fast responses, and eagerness to rush into a fight repeatedly. Our philiosophy is that "fights are fun, so lets seek more fights". Manual piloting is an important part of how our fleets operate. If this is an area you are struggling in, we will teach you. We have many veteran pilots that are always sharing knowledge with our newer pilots. We are confident you will improve as a pilot here.
---
We predominantly fly nanogang, this is our first choice when responding to content. We maintain several other doctrines that allow us to deal with situations that would otherwise be unfightable for our nanogang. We stress being prepared so that we can be reshipping quickly, so that we can bring the right tools to hand to take an engagement.
---
Our pilots are very PvP minded. When someone says on coms that a ship is found in the chain, the best recruits are excited have another oppertunity to pvp. Every one of our pilots is driven to get fights and blow things up.
---
Outside of PvP, we have an excellent array of planets for setting up PI in our hole. We also provide the opportunity for players to do industry in the hole as well. As well as the usual suspects of PvE content, like running sites. Many of our pilots do these activities on the side. Affordable and fast logistics are also available for use, allowing our members to order whatever they want and get it promptly delivered in our home hole. We offer SRP in the form of free Logi And certain Alliance funded ships as well.

This "adapting" the people keep talking about means forcing alliances into a particular playstyle. It's not healthy to force everyone into a single play style. Back in the day, PLNC did their thing, goons did their thing, and they both were successful.
---
Those two different playstyles could exist in the same game. This is not the case anymore, and it's *not* a good thing.

Make it possible to collapse them?
---
It has nothing to do with Rorqs, that's the point. Rorquals are bad for small, causal miners, because the minerals mined with Ventures to Exhumers are worth less (moon mining helped them out, though). It's bad for small groups, which can't field and defend them. But they do not hurt PL&amp;Co at all.
---
On the contrary - they could help them to make their comeback. They "just" have to attract more players of a newer generation. Not necessarily totally new ones (Horde does a decent job here already), they don't have to copy Goons 1:1. If they manage to increase their number (without Horde) by 50-100% with a bit more casual and krabbing oriented players in the 50-100M SP range, they would still be much smaller than Test or Goons in numbers, but become incredibly strong. But at the moment they are not attractive for this kind of player.
---
I don't think there's 10 players out of everyone playing who wants **MORE** "news" (and ads)

I can help you find things that are much more fun and profitable than what you're currently doing, and give you general advice for the game. Message me here on Reddit and I'd be happy to help.

---
I don't know about TEST, but Goons don't charge a percentage of collateral at all. And a 2% fee would cover the instances you're talking about, because the volume of skillbooks is trivial. This thing you're pulling as the reasoning for the 5%, is true of everyone in the game, but these are the only people I've seen that charge both a high % and a high m3. I understand it's a harder route than normal, but it just seems like double dipping.

Gila is pretty versatile. Stratos if you want to do cloaky shit and exploration without immediately doing a T3 train.
---
Loki is a great goal for sure. But maybe push that back just a little for t2 frigs and dessys. T3ds are awesome.
---
They aren’t news items. If there were rotating links to SCOPE or INN articles, or TiS links then you could call it news. Opening up the launcher and being like “Oh shit, this happened and someone wrote a cool article” is news, an image enticing me to buy Omega status when my account has 4 months left of it is an advertisement. 
---
How is that a high m3? You keep saying these words, but I don’t think you really understand them. This is a very normal m3 considering current fuel prices and distance from Jita. I mean come on man.
---
yes but it gave breathing room to other groups who could not hold so much space, and that resulted in a growing potential capable of toppling these coalitions, as we saw with cfc starting with the lowsec Voltron.
---
That quote is pretty clear to be honest. Especially when you read first post of the linked thread and why it was closed.
---
I have nothing but complete love for CCPs GM and support team. I've made in-game errors and payment issues and had things resolved within 48hrs. When it comes to account access they are super careful and if you've legitimately made an error, you'll have to respect that it will take some time to resolve. Especially as mentioned previously in other comments with banned hackers trying to pull the same stunt. 
---
&gt;I like the old one MUCH more.
---
Well then we can all rejoice that you're not in charge
---
I am absolutely. Helldunk or Blueballs didn’t start with fozziesov. It’s been a doctrine for years and years and years. People just look back with rose tinted glasses and forget all the boredom that comes become the big fights. B-R wasn’t happening every day in those wars either, it happened once.

Oh come on, that's just being deliberately dense.  The user in question was not wanting ads in their launcher.  Your answer, while not outright saying it, suggests that Ads wouldn't be in the launcher.
---
Your userbase isn't comprised of astonishingly literate toddlers and you know that.  We aren't going to take that answer literally.  You knew what we would infer from your answer.
---
Not gonna argue because linked quote is self explanatory. OP tried to create\order creation of custom launcher, thread was closed with that specific reason.
---
Do you ever wonder *why* NCPL doesn't recruit krabs? It's not because they're stupid or think they know better than everyone else.
---
It's because that's not their play style. They recruit skilled PVPers because they want to do skilled pvp. They don't want to sit around babysitting krabs all day. They have no interest in it. They want to be the predators, not the prey.
---
So they had a choice to make. Either "adapt" and start recruiting krabs, or try to make their thing work. Unfortunately, eve is in a state where making their thing works is extremely difficult because the prey (or at least the high-value stuff) is essentially invincible if they aren't stupid.
---
I’ve almost got all the reqs for Gila, I’ve seen it mentioned quite a lot.. Also how is Astero compared to Stratios? Because I’ve got only astero unlocked as of now, or is it worth training up to the strat?

---
We just want a launcher on which 75% of the space is taken by tiles. We use the launcher to open our accounts, not see skins, omega ads, or unnecessarily large blocs showing the same text that can be consolidated in much lesser space and still be highlighted.
---
The problem is prior to the DRF falling apart noone else in eve wanted that space. Its not worth it as rental space generally because you have to be able to respond to real threats to it so someone like Goons owning it means they have to cross map deploy to protect it. Most of the major blocs right now own as much space as they can hold. The blocs in the last 2-3 years that have been killed have all moved into one of the current power blocs and have no interest in striking back out on their own. 
---
He never got banned. 
---
I’m sorry still not fully familiar with the Eve terms.. Basically you’re saying I should focus on t2 and what are dessy’s? Anything specific I should look into?
---
This is disgusting. They log in, activate rental mails and pocket it to their wallet  before they even materialise. Litteraly. There is just no time to do  anything else. Like how is this supposed to be fair. Meanwhile Falcon is  parading around saying that we should calm down and that everything is  fine. 
---
Install ad block for the eve launcher only 240 nuPLEX per month!
---
I mean I'm absolutely not the change i wanna see i just crawled into a hole for the limited amount of fun left in the game. ( plus i realistically would not have the time to make major changes in the eve meta ). 
---
so at this point for me it's a game of extracting enough fun to justify keeping playing until well i find something better to do with my time.
---
If you shrink your launcher it will use less memory. You don't have to have it fullscreen on your 4k monitor
---
there are some systems in a different region that can hit the good parts of omist :)
---
destroyers
---
Depends on where you live, muninns (minmatar HAC) are a perfect train, they are used in nearly every pvp alliance
---
Cynabal, not OP or even that good compared to other pirate cruisers but I love it. Not the worst ship, just lacking compared to other similar ships.
---
You should set the goal to find the right group to play with, grinding your way into new ships is boring and doesn't mean you are capable of using them.
---
Maybe try to master the Slicer, start with cheap shield Tristans or smth. Eventually you can upgrade to Retributions and Cruisers will be easy after that.
---
Love the Loki, because it is just so versatile both in tank and damage options
---
&gt; also, like, we`re all fairly responsible here for not wanting to expand
---
then maybe CCP need to give us a reason to do so. there's literally no incentive to go outside the home region other than to dick swing.
---
if you like dick swinging, that's fun. however to get me off my ass to do something, i need an actual reason not just 'because' or 'for the lulz'.

not in omist...

Strength is relative. HK &amp; LZHKs have good pilots and the best equipment but they are far from anything you run into in 0.0. Hell we were outnumbered so badly by Novac that we couldn’t even call targets and kite the field too well. Another time I ate all of them in an HFI. 
---
Wormhole corps are akin to space marine chapters from warhammer 40k. The better corps will be in the most expensive ships, with all of the implants, and all of the boosters, and really good propaganda.
---
They’re a lot rarer, and smaller than the story’s go. Yeah HK being the biggest got about 100 folks to log in during the eviction ping. Most of my experiences with them were skirmishes usually outnumbered 2:1 maybe a little less. MCAV has typically engaged them in the 5-30 range. They’re just dedicated to winning and take a lot of fights. We’re dedicated to taking fights but win a lot of fights.
---
MCAV ranges from being accused of blobbing in early USTZ to solo/duo memes in the EUTZ. I’d wager most corps do. Idk Novac/TDIN are big dick swingers RN. Ember Sands(Pospy) have a lot of members but they were scared to undock and fight us last week. So like, again. Eve is 80% psychology. You can start a wormhole corp and make it good by yourself if you’re dedicated to being good. Wormhole line members spread around like todays STDS so just look through peoples corp history’s for commonalities and hit those guys up. Most importantly just get into a wormhole. You’ll meet everyone eventually.
---
Won't work. You'd have to block eveonline.com and you'd need that to work for other things like API etc. If it was articles.eveonline.com you could block the subdomain though.

That said, blocking the thing from showing probably won't change anything, it would likely just be empty space afterwards.

It is high, but there's a reason for that, like you said, the high distance. But let's not honey words here, it's high, I pay 300.

Again, you don’t live in Wicked Creek. You’re ignoring the basic fact that as distance goes up, so does price. It costs nothing to go one jump from Jita, it costs a whole lot more to go across the entirety of EVE. Go do the actually math on fuel prices then come back here.
---
I don't get why CCP doesn't just follow these guys. They are long time repeated RMT botters which I am sure over the years have caused quite a lot of financial damage to CCP, and that is not even bringing up the damage they have caused to the game and its playersbase by the effect on economy etc. Its the same people doing same things over and over and over again and again.
---
what would this look like with dozens or hundreds of accounts?
---
First time I dropped somebody with five guys was the best experience I've ever had in Eve. It's a lot of work to maintain those accounts but the payoff is crazy. My APM when I'm dropping people is like playing StarCraft
---
Listen, I understand you guys gotta make that money.  I also understand that ads on your launcher can't be making that much money AND it's pissing off your already pissed off (generally) community. 
---
1000 toons. Jesus fuck.

I really don't think you can sue unless you can prove breach of contract, which is highly unlikely

Just saying 10b refinery means a lot more to horde than 30b in dreads means to us
---
The tristan. It's the only ship I could afford back when I played lol.
---
don't use steam
---
There is no recourse other than trying to appeal to CCP. They have the right to terminate your account at any time.
---
Yeah, I'd be flipping tables with nerd rage. That's one juicy solo kill he lost F.
---
Best tabs!
---
Out of interest what ads are people seeing?
---
I'm just seeing devblogs and 'upgrade to omega. Though I would like an option to remove them
---
I’m not gonna comment on the fits but C3 space anoms are 15min for 40mil. 
---
I never used the tengu due to ammo m3. But you can easily do it. Typically made half a bill before i got bored. Really safe disengage.
---
C6 sites in dreads are better. I highly encourage all null bears to take C6 farm from ppl who never log in anymore. Krab holes are lame.
---
i think the fear is "the ads people 'are going' to see".
---
It's the implication.
---
even if i have hard evidence that accusation which they made is not true?
---
This is the worst bait thread I've ever seen
---
Even if they aren't bots, if they're botlike enough then fuck em, they aren't actual players, therefore no loss. No proof required beyond basic observation.
---
I hope you're trolling and aren't really that out of touch with reality.  I really, really do.
---
nothing you can do after agreeing to the ToS. 
---
just get behind 7 proxies and DDoS TQ until they give you they unban you. 
---
Well please do tell what you are banned for and what your hard evidence is
---
&gt; now 
---
No for example the web doesnt require the propulsion jamming skill to be at level 4 but when I abyssal it i cant use it because it requires propulsion jamming skill to be at 4. Similar with the c3x bcu
---
EDIT..seems you can not go back to old launcher anymore..
---
FTFY: Where it belongs

Skills for example the web doesnt require the propulsion jamming skill to be at level 4 but when I abyssal it i cant use it because it requires propulsion jamming skill to be at 4. Similar with the c3x bcu

I bring my loot back to my corp's hub and then either make rigs out of it or get the corp to ship it to Jita for sale
---
My stepmother does, but that's only because of our sexual fetishes.
---
Sue yourself, for defamation of character.
---
You would win after this post.
---
It would be nice to see which accounts are omega or alpha in the launched and how much time is left. Also, make it togglable so people who want to see it can see it, not forced.
---
Combat fit kawaii Magnate or Probe \^\^
---
Hecate looks like a sword blade, dark and ruthless. 
---
Stabber and Vagabond are the great birds of prey, with their lovely neck feathers \^\^
---
And Cynabal and his elder brother Mach, that's right.
---
Let's see it.
---
Ccp has gotta be one of the only developers who keep removing good features from there games and continue to do so.
---
You whiley minx you, just grant me this one thing, pretty please
---
One of the times I tried getting into EVE I was given a Raven by a guy in our local language channel. Always loved the look of that ship! 
---
In projectile fit, it looks like a shotgun with a flashlight mounted under the barrel.
---
😂 bro don’t take that advice. I only had one t3cruiser in my eve wormhole career and it’s still alive. Only pve ship I never lost. It’s paid itself, all my pvp ships when i first moved to wormhole space, and a paladin.
---
Protip. Vast gas sites, bountiful gas sites, exceptional ore deposits, and Rarified ore deposits all payout about 20-30mil, can be done in c5 &amp;C6 wormholes. And are sub 10min completion time.
---
Chremoas! Good looking, strong, *and* fun! Can't ask for more.
---
yeah tenerifis that place i said skillu is harassing.
---
They live on our couch, so yeah, i know, u assumed wrong buddy ;)
---
The only way*
---
Don't forget. Circle of Hell is one of their spinoffs. All that renter money goes ^
---
Tabs with slef explaining names could be the solution to this problem
---
&gt; The launcher is the primary way for us to make sure that information we want players to see is viewed by as many people as possible, as it's a gateway through which everyone (who isn't using third party launch applications) is accessing EVE.
---
this is the part where your vision and the player use case differs to the detriment of the player experience
---
the primary objective for the launcher should be to efficiently launch the game, not deliver information. it is a launcher.
---
having news delivered in the launcher would be tolerable if you didn't monopolize screen space with news, again to the detriment of the user experience
---
i have no idea what's up with this wave of unintuitive and unuseful ux design in the last year or so but y'all gotta stop hiring vertical text enthusiasts and maybe focus group/beta test your ux changes a little bit before pushing them to live. "we want to change this for x reason" isn't enough justification to push to production, you have end users and their opinion *should* matter
---
then again, #ccp
---
Eve needs a 24 hr "purge" day. But honestly, wealth is so great now it's beyond comprehension. I remember when time and effort held value and now it's meaningless next to PLEX and skill injectors. I bought in again with a new alpha using the Galaxy Pack or something and after I sold the bonus items I already had 2 billion isk doing nothing. Battleships and below are the key to pumping this game back up. Capitals and their uses need to be changed drastically. Remove fighters and only let caps lock other caps. Revamp the market, let players only modify orders once a day. Let players see who they buy from. Implement stores and sales. Limit stores per station so we can actually utilize more than Jita 4-4. Have rent for stores. 
---
It's not hard to see the problems and just find new and interesting ways to change things. 
---
 “It depends on what the meaning of the word ‘is’ is.”
---
While it's good you've put it back, I don't understand how a useful feature like that gets removed in the first place.
---
I haven't updated my launcher yet so I still have it nice and big in the lower left.
---
CCPA should have thought about that before they spent a decade trying their best to run the damn game into the ground.
---
yeah, game is fucked. this is not the reason why. unless this is bad bait just go and take it from them, aye?!
---
Friendship is the best ship :)
---
CCP doesn't do multithreading/multiprocessing.
---
MODS please delete. Please ban.
---
Can we see the evidence?
---
I'm good with &gt;2000 SP/h
---
Favourite generic mapping:  23i 21m 21p 17w 17, I have a character that has used this since day one (179.4m SP).
---
My main and his 'shadow' are both currently mapped:  24i 24m 17p 17w 17c, training a mix of science, industry and misc. support skills (226.8m SP and 213.8m SP)
---
If you Google EVE Online and attributes, you will likely find a post by me.  I actually did the math long ago.
---
I bet you guys regret removing the IGB now, could've used it to inject ads to every page visited :thinking:
---
On the plus side, CCP pushed me to finally download a third party launcher that eliminates ads all together.  WOOO great job!
---
&gt;I'm interested what would you do and who to contact if you would like to sue the company?
---
there's a lawyer in texas that's on my speed dial just for situations like yours.
---
Methinks you're confusing client with API. 
---
If you commercialised your bot code you could fund your case.
---
Epithal and any blockade runner and JF 😉
---
I don't really want to criticise this because those guys are a cancer on the game and, if CCP isn't going to ban RMTers, it's good to at least spoil their day a bit.
---
But there is something not right about a Goon going on an anti-botting crusade. Has your alliance policy on not reporting suspected botters in Delve changed, then? Or is player suspicion fine for going after other groups but not for those sheltering under your umbrella?
---
can we please have omega status for the accounts
---
The Texas Hammer. Roflmao.
---
You guys know that pretty much all modern OS allow you to set up multiple clocks? I literally have an eve time clock right beside my local tz in windows 10.
---
It's literally half a page, if you can't be bothered to read that then why are you on a website which is about posting and sharing text?
---
Not til we have srp for titans and supers
---
Astero is good for killing exploration frigates and also exploring itself, quite a nice ship in its own right. Stratios is best used for cloaky combat and ganks, also pretty okay for running exploration combat sites but Astero or CovOps frigates are better for data/relic site hacking, mainly due to cost.
---
Both ships are gorgeous and great fun to fly in their own right, both can pvp in the right situations, but Stratios is definitely the jewel of the SoE shipline for its versatility.
---
Tapi would be a good alliance without you in it
---
Normal CCP lying.  Its like they don't realize that in the internet age, people can ACTUALLY go back and look at what they say in the past.

---
Thank you for the nicely put out info, I guess I’ll train into strat as well :)
---
3rd party launcher?
---
On what grounds would you sue ?
---
If you go to a restaurant for example, you see many signs that say: "This is a private establishment. We refuse to offer service to anyone for any reason." And it is perfectly legal. So what makes you think the same does not apply to a private game company, especially once you accepted TOS and EULA ?
---
If you bring up issue of paying for plex, or alike, I got news for you. CCP owns it. You do not. All Eve Online, the virtual currency, all items, etc. etc. are all CCP property, not yours. 
---
If you do have hard evidence as you claim, post it, along with all the details of your suspension or ban, make a big enough public stink and it will get looked into. 
---
Last but not least, your suspension is just that, a suspension, not a ban. And the results of the suspension are still up in the air. If your claims are true, your account will be restored, if they are false, it will be banned. Alternatively, you may get it back but stripped of items, currency (either ISK or Plex), if it is determined they were gotten in an illegitimate ways. Read some of the latest CCP security blogs. They can and will do that.
---
I mean the Leviathan is what most people say your first Titan should be. Can't beat the design of the Avatar though. I think as long as you don't fly an Erebus people won't make fun of you
---
Second this. Unless you REALLY like solo PvP finding a group and training their doctrines is going to be the most beneficial for you
---
Yeah okay. 
---
Like as in strap-on? 🙏
---
I wouldn't have it any other way =) 
---
I have flat attributes because I can't be bothered to work out what skills I need in what order, and stick to that. Sure, I'm not min-maxing my SP generation ... but it's a game, I'm here to have fun, and min-maxing skill queues is not fun for me.
---
I don't buy injectors and I do use accelerators during the events, and I have a +5 set of implants which I am in when not flying stuff that might die.
---
I took him into nullsec, gave him a hundred million and told him it wouldn't last as long as he thought.
---
Titan is literally named "Because of the Implication".
---
I mean, we already do.
---
Nothing of value was lost
---
Heaven forbid they actually own and exploit space themselves. You know, what we do.
---
as i said it was fun
---
Which raises the small question of "Why is the Paid Account Launcher Showing Me Ads?"
---
no but thats because you should pay strovolos a billion for his sparkling attitude 
---
Ark. Surely 
---
Yeah, you're still bitter about your blacklist. Get fucked yoyaz. PL lol. Go lose another region to CVA.

Don't make promises. That's like the first rule of basic sales, speaking of which where ARE CCP's outside sales people?
---
Rupture / Broadsword. Rusty cheese wedge of death (although a bit less wedgy after redesign).
---
Make sure they make the accusation while you're in texas so you can call upon TEXAS LAW.
---
Can I have the In-Game Browser back? I'll find a way to block the ads if they will just give me the damn IGB back. 
---
it didnt end it though! lol we kept rolling
---
Pretty much everything Amarr.
---
ya I’m really upset and salty that I invited alch directly into corp to wox a slyce carrier lmao
---
Happens F!
---
If the fleets are fighting at long ranges beyond capital neut barrage, then a Komodo isn't going to be primaried. If they are dropped at brawl range and can get hit by 50-100 cap neuts - Komodo dies. The apostles/minokawa argument is moot. Both sides shoot the fax speed bumps first anyway. The problem is two fold with tidi. Do your modules work for your active resists and do your missiles actually get there over instant hit weapons (which still take 5-6 minutes).
---
with your killboard, I'd do more than blush. 
---
This is the point. 
---
Alliances can actually afford to risk and lose dread fleets, meaning we'd get more than 0-1 meaningful battles per war. 
---
Dread fleets are also less good at suppressing smallgang/blops and reavers-style content, so we'd have more to do between wars. 
---
That's not quite it. The people who were asking for farms and fields genuinely thought that the only thing propping up Goonswarm Federation and its allies were moons. They wanted passive moon mining gone because they thought it would end us. They never had any intention of farming the fields themselves.
---
Unfortunately, the handsome and intelligent folks in the GSF Finance group spent years weaning us off of moongoo for alliance income, far ahead of when it was actually removed. Funny, that.
---
Here, I offer you 1/8 accounts (12.5%) and 7/8 (87.5%) news/promotions: https://i.imgur.com/nPOt39r.jpg 🤔😂
---
I think you should absolutely sue. Go out hire the best (or only) lawyer that will take your case. Spend as much money as possible. Or even better, fly to Iceland and go visit their office and attempt to explain in person. 
---
After you have spent this money and find yourself penniless or in locked up in a mental hospital update us how it all went.  
---
I'm going to take the bait here for a sec
---
That's not going to go the way you think it's going to go.
---
And the north almost won the last war.
---
well now I feel bad. 
---
The idea wasn't that Citadels replace PoS's. The Idea is that Citadels still are content drivers. 
---
PO's had 10 years of ship kills and they killed 300k Ships. That's 30k per year. 
---
Citadels have 4 years, and they've killed 70.000. That's about half of what PoS's did. Considering that Citadels are harder to kill, I would say the idea that Citadels are not a content driver is silly. 
---
Damage Control Tech 2 
---
you've always been a tool. you're own alliance knows it, too. 
---
Obviously we will see all caracals next time, impressing you on reddit number one priority!
---
What do you want to do the most in eve ?
---
PvE combat path is VNI &gt;&gt; Gila &gt;&gt; Rattlesnake &gt;&gt; Tengu &gt;&gt; Loki&gt;&gt; Marauder(s)&gt;&gt;Caps, you can switch the cruisers and the battleship around if its to your liking. Gila is the ship that will let you do the most different types of content, it is the most flexible and very widely used. Also if you train it to full, and then side train into a Loki, you  will be covered for quite a lot of PvP as well, different hulls and fits but same skills, opening up even more content for you, so its very much worth training into. Then just side train again into HACs for even more PvP options.
---
For PvP go with what your alliance flies / uses the most, ask and check for their doctrines.
---
Proteus is not worth it, it has very limited roles outside of some specific wormholes and is by far the worst of the T3Cs, really by far, CCP fucked it up pretty hard. If you specifically need an armor T3C go either Legion or even a armor fit Loki, both are better then Proteus.

Hey dude, I'm not sure what's going on with you but obviously something is really grating you the wrong way based on how hostile and upset you've become in any of your interactions with folks.

Don't hesitate to take time away from the keyboard for mental health, and talk to people if you need support IRL.

---
How the living fuck is mango=racism
---
Are you (re)tard?????
---
join a nullblock, mine the best ore, overprice it on market
---
This is emergent player based interaction based on control of resources. They are not making passive income for 'doing fuck all', they're doing it for being able to hold a large area of space and protect the renters from outside aggression.
---
If you don't like it, either take some space yourself and rent it out, or make the space less safe so SkillU can't rent it out for such a price.
---
PVP groups renting space to PVE groups makes perfect sense. PVEers don't want to be responsible for defending themselves in PVP, and PVPers don't want to have to grind PVE. In a larger sov holding coalition you effectively have the same deal within the coalition or alliance, maybe not through direct rent but mining and ratting taxes paying for SRP for the PVP groups is pretty much the same thing.
---
Everyone does
---
If you ever need to talk, I'm always willing to put EVE b.s. away and hear whatever is on your mind. Just hit me up on Discord.
---
listen to this smug bastard, I love it 
---
Do me a favor right now.  Log into your home router.  Look under security, disable DDOS protection.  When I had that enabled I got all kinds of random socket errors and glitches with pingplotter to CCP's servers.  Soon as I disabled it, never had another socket failure.
---
Push it to the limit.
---
everyone knows they are goon pets and pay fee to hold that sov
---
Quit crying 
---
The game would have to get pretty small before a group getting bored and breaking off would be a viable strategy.
---
The only way *that* would happen is if someone bought EVE (and preferably CCP with it) away from Pearl Abyss and paid for at least operating costs and token development over the years.
---
Who are we to judge other people's sick fetishes?
---
I dont think you guys really needed moon goo as an income source right around the time NC. lost tribute to the CFC. You were sitting on such a stockpile of tech that it could fund your current operations of the time quite easily. Fast forward to the Tech nerf and the conquest of Fountain/Delve and again goons were very flush with passive income for the next few years. Even when you guys decided to start rental groups you didnt need the income from either because you made good investments throughout that 3-6 year span. Couple that with very little serious investments. It wasnt until you lost all of Deklein that you had significant loss in infrastructure. Add in the passive tax most alliances are doing now and yes your very flush regardless of moon incomes.       
---
Dont take it as knocking you guys as Aryth always kept the isk tap flowing. Realistically though you havent directly needed moon goo for income since like 2013. 
---
Fucking test lmao
---
Shitty blobbers ruining the game.
---
Orthrus
---
For small ships the extra gain over simply giving people cheap ships is not worth the effort. For larger T1 ships they're probably only used on fleet ops anyway and traditional SRP - which is significantly easier to administer - will do almost the same thing.

---
... yes, which is what I said. My point was that the people clamoring for farms and fields believed that we needed moongoo, when we were actively transitioning away from it.
---
We have. You guys have dropped carriers and battleships on us after we destroyed your stabber fleet. We still brought a fight while out numbered. 
---
Toss up a br and aar

maybe skillitself has spent so long farming renters they have spodbrain by proxy

So can it now auto update on patch days without relaunch, or is the technology still not there?

Vexor Navy Issue. With T2 Armor fit and some faction DDAs and Augmented drones can easily do T3 and T4 electrical and fire filaments. T5s requires very heavy bling and can still die on unlucky spawns.

I, for one, am shocked. 
---
the spodbrain of willingly take fights with 1:3 numbers, real dangerous disease.
---
No, whenever we bring our numbers you guys either bail or bring in more numbers.
---
Feel free to link a br you fought outnumbered 3 to 1.
---
And no, running once your outnumbered isn’t fighting
---
Its also why allies would receive moons for good deployments and participation in campaigns because they were still very reliant on moon goo. FCON/RZR/SMA/FA/CO2 etc.
---
&gt;The idea wasn't that Citadels are as good as PoS's were. The Idea is that Citadels still are content drivers.
---
I mean my atron is a content driver if it dies, the idea is general how much content does it create, rather then 0 vs something. 
---
The counter is that Poses give about 2 times the fights that citadels give, you seem to agree with that notion given killmails. ( even known ships killed is a really bad metric, as poses didn't always have guns when fit in the meta ).
---
Now the thing is citadels have both half the kills and less then half the losses, it seems more like most people are not forming to kill citadels as they would form to kill poses ( aka there is less content in eve from the citadel introduction ). 
---

I’d suggest training for a little of remote shield boosters first, and fly some logi frigates, see if you like them. If you do, t2 logi frigates and cruisers are always wanted in any profession, and t3c logi is pretty dope too. FAXes are endgame logi, but that’s a long ass way off for you.
---
I'll jump in on the bait. What were you banned for?

That looks really fun.

&gt; This is the point.

---
&gt; Dread fleets are also less good at suppressing smallgang/blops and reavers-style content, so we'd have more to do between wars. 
---
There is no risk, losses will be inevitable for supercap, and use dreads will be largely profitable.
---
m8 i take fights on the daily 1:30, its called ratting sweetie look it up
---
Did you get paid to say it?
---
SkillU lost a battle, inb4 they reset their current allies and farm them for content to regrow their ego again :D
---
You cant sue them unless you live in an area where you cant sign your rights away. Also good luck in trying to sue them since I believe you would have to go to their country to do it since they don't have an office in the us anymore. 
---
Don't pay them.

If you have a script then you don't have a bubble, you have a targeted module - and you're not going to be able to grab a spearfisher with that because they're not going to be in targeting range for long enough to lock them.

You can use ISBoxers launcher for example.

---
(Not that i know how to do any of those shit myself)
---
Polarised Manticore, it's expensive but fun.
---
I'm glad the fight was much better than this most...
---
Those Mino's tanked really well o7 good job guys :)
---
Picks a fight with legacy, much larger than you
---
*we were blobbed*
---
are you retarded
---
For ratting/making isk depends. If you are in a null alliance/coalition then go for a battleship like a rattlesnake and run DEDs/afk farm. If you are in Low sec go for a Stratios and in High I would recommend Most faction frigs or an Assault frig. You could also train into a gun battleship or a t2 logi for incursions but I haven't done them in a long time so not sure if they are still worth it after alphas got access to BBs.
---
For solo pvp.. ehh... T3s imo don't work really good but add in a few friends or have a fleet and they start to behave. Other than that i would reocmmend the stratios. Easy to train up. Not very expensive and you can go lazors/drone or pure drone build both armor tanked. The gila is also good in pvp.
---
Just a reminder ISBoxer EVE Launcher is better in almost every way:
---
1.) Is Free
---
2.) Is Ad Free
---
3.) Will never lose your accounts
---
4.) Doesn’t require an ISBoxer subscription to use
---
You only need to open the EVE Launcher to download patches.

If one party confirms the lock times are not working as supposed to while another party confirms that they are, then perhaps the bug is hull or module specific ? Maybe post more details, especially ships and fits, this may make a difference.

Problem is it's usually bigger stuff or higher spec doctrines with possible cap support nowadays in FW space. It just doesn't seem as accessible in the way it used to be for newer players. FW used to be such a great way for a low SP player to get PvP experience in addition to provide a good learning environment for them. 
---
you seem to have issue with direct, to-the-point communication. I'm doing great, but words like 'fuck you' seems to bother you. Let me try this. Get fucked. Is that better? 
---
I thought they were leaving FW?
---
That is false. Faction guns drop in Abyss, you can find plenty of them on the market in Jita, some of which have been put on there by me.
---
Now, they're crap and not worth it, and anyone that actually buys them is a tool, but that is a different issue.
---
You didn't earn that 70 million until it's safely home in a station. Moving loot back to safety is as much part of earning it as hacking the cans. Don't think of anything in space as earnt, or a 'loss' when you get blown up - think of it as a job not properly completed.
---
Don't fly what you can't afford to lose applies to cargo too - and if your cargo value goes up you should re-evaluate whether you're still happy flying with it. If you were out for 3h you must have had plenty of opportunities to drop loot off in a safe place. When you have an amount that would be painful to fail to get home, leave the chain, drop it off in a station (preferably in highsec), and then re-enter the chain. This will cost you a few minutes and protect your cargo.

fucking blobbers ruining EVE :(

You make me wanna join :(
---
Typical Millennial. Either overdo or do nothing at all 
---
&gt; You can also anchor a secure can in a safe (without a mobile depot) and store your loot in there if you think you are being followed that way you can come back at a later time to retrieve it
---
You can even jetcan at a safe as long as you don't leave it for more than an hour. I used to do that when I was T1 exploring via daytripping if I'd done more than a couple of sites in a nice hole.
---
we have fun. Feel free. 
---
We're currently testing fluid user list (fills in the blank space currently created by resizing) on beta. The user list can take up to 50% of the launcher space that way (+ 2 tile items).

---
because i cant even plan what i'm going to have for lunch let alone what skill i'll need to train 3 months from now 
---
&gt; upd: hopefully, it does not have memory leaks =) 
---
You can alt tab and shut down the launcher completely once your client is running. I do this always as I like to have minimum bare necessary stuff running in the background when I play games. You only need it to initially start the game, if there are any issues with it they will stop once you shut it down.
---
We're farting around in small gangs of frigs/dessies/assault frigs just about every day, haven't been lacking for content at all. Sure DHSJ likes to bring snaked kitey pirate cruisers around now and then, but we've had plenty of good fights from the minmatar and other neutral parties jumping around. 
---
prove it ?
---
comparing kill counts isn't fair imo when citadels have AOE bombs, PDS, and much easier to use mods
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
But in all seriousness, godspeed, hope you get plenty more out of this game
---
This fight puts us 110b vs 438b lost on this campaign, keep up the good work legacy !

Funny that a feature that is present in the old launcher and now again in the new version is considered positive rather then basic and default

Well I hope it keeps improving. I would love both war zones to return to a decent level of activity. I really do miss the constant content I referred to previously and the mix of experienced and new players you used to get together with in ad hoc fleets. You've got me all nostalgic now lol

??????????????????????????????????????
---
no, and no.
---
Just wanted to add one more way:
---
If you get lucky and end up with something very expensive and don't want to risk hauling it yourself, you can create a courier contract for someone else to haul it for you.
---
You will be able to set a collateral for the contract.  If the hauler gets ganked or steals the stuff in the contract, you keep the collateral.  So once they accept the contract, you're getting paid for the stuff whether or not they get it to a trade hub.
---
You will have to include a payment for the hauling though.  A commonly-quoted rate is 1M per jump in highsec.  Local rates will vary based on your patience and the number of local haulers.
---
&gt; If they're going to check, it's usually afterward.
---
Yeah, as a J spacer, what I do if I find a ship is jump it, try to kill it and then if I get a killmail as a result, I'll look at the character and see if I should be nice to them.
---
I too enjoy clubbing seals. 
---
and here I was thinking about resubbing. Not now, thanks to you.  Great work, fucking marketer scum.
---
For most people, after you have X amount of wealth (high SP characters, super, titan, etc.) more ISK doesn't make a difference. But they still wonna play the videogame with their friends who are in the same situation, either quit the game or find an alliance level income for your group that can support it long term. This is what moons did, and renting out still does.
---
A 3rd option is funding the alliance out of old personal wealth from individuals within that group for as long as that is possible. (Mercenary contracts are a joke)
---
Unless eve spirals into a heat death where the only group left are giga alliances in mega giga coalitions. There will still be groups who wonna play eve online only for the pvp. And there will be people that started playing eve in these giga blobs who would want something different to go to, once they don't need to make any more ISK for the rest of their time playing the game.
---
&gt; in this day and age of instant skills by way of injectors the age of the character on the info page means absolutely nothing
---
I can't be the only one who has a problem with this.
---
This post aged really well 
---
which caps were those
---
Wow.  I would fully support this.  Evemon style launcher would be a real upgrade.  I have several accounts and frequently click the wrong account to what character is on the account.  
---
I already pay money per account to play your game, I do not want ads plastered everywhere on top that.
---
Did you post your thread too early?  It looks like your nightmares and minos got raped at the end there.  even properly sorting your battle report link (even though br.inyourspace is hilariously broken) shows you losing the isk war.

---
bruh ur coalition literally just blobs people as hard as possible. if that's not "clubbing seals" idk what is. 
---
They can batphone Goons also
---
&gt; It could be more profitable to shift your exploration from WH to Nullsec areas
---
I don't agree with this. I play predominantly in J space, and the home chain usually contains at least a few good sites. When we get a nullsec exit, I usually check it out for exploration, and you can easily go 10 jumps without seeing a relic site.
---
Nullsec exploration mostly seems to be over-saturated.
---
Yes, and they didn't drop corp, you can just easily check it.
---
Lol, keep taking that TEST flair off but it keeps coming back. 
---
I mostly like de-cloaking and laying down tackle and 1100 dps.
---
The one Mino that has not been in corp for two years.
---
Skill U doing 5d chess, dropping corp years in advance to protect their zkill stats.
---
&gt; Additionally a huge advantage in NS is that you can drop off your loot in NPC null stations before you return it to a market.
---
If you're in C1-3 wormholes you're going to have empire space exits everywhere you go, which are far easier to get loot to a hub from than nullsec is.
---
Not the launcher we have but the one we want !!! +1
---
It's still feeding when you willingly jump into the blob. 
---
Quickest dialers in the south.
---
Grrr Goons.  
---
Tbh that was my first socket close in my eve time who doesn't happens in tidi grind festival
---
I think it applies to both. If getting blown up with 500 mil in your cargo is going to hurt, you can't afford to lose it. Sure, you haven't completely collected that loot until it's home, but there's still a big effective loss when you fail to get it home.
---
If you buy a Gila and fit it out, your net worth doesn't change, and if you die, you're at -500m. If you are exploring and you die, your net worth doesn't change, but if you got the loot home, you'd be +500m. The difference in outcome and therefore the feeling of loss is similar.
---
There is no point flying an astero unless you can use covops cloak.
---
One of them was screeching in local yesterday about how they won the summer war because they killed 2 keepstars and went home to farm tri to death.  I was kind of astounded reading that, because we also killed two keepstars in the south in that war, after they all decided it was too haarrrdd and took their ball and went home to feed in the north, or farm tri, or pay a fortune for a 6 month nip.  That doesn't include all the keepstars that were killed in the north, only a couple of which we helped on to any great extent, it also doesn't include the gotg faction forts for peace payoff.
---
In short, that one statement showed me how far fragile egos will go to protect their perceived "eliteness".
---
guess they don't teach math in skillu
---
Oh no, we lost a fight when we were outnumbered 3 to 1. Bunch of beta pets, call goons next time
---

Russian omega accounts are cheaper than US/Western Europe, IIRC.  Cost of living is low enough that RMT can be a significant income.
---
Also a good number of underemployed computer-savvy professionals to operate the "hacking" side of the business.
---
Dual web 100nm talos :^)
---
I disagree with this, it's perfectly feasible to do exploration daytripping in wormholes as a new player. As long as the OP can be sensible about losses and about blowing up exploration cans from failing the hack, it's good ISK and more exciting than most other things you can do with those skills.
---
Can you tell your boss or whoever is in charge of putting these ads on the launcher that i personally told them to fuck off
---
Don't get baited by bad flair bait.
---
Yea, fuck those guys for trying to fight.

I followed the art of poor way to closely to have stuff of value ;).

( It's one of the things that absolutely saved eve as a game for me and likely why the current meta of space feudalism drives me nuts ) because i used to be that person ratting without really enjoying it just so i could see a int go up in CCP's database.

---
They don’t play the game anyway so...
---
Let's see... Minimal UI, still very functional.
---
Obviously, you wouldn't be able to apply to any modern programming school, and so in companies like CCP. You don't understand the actual paradigm of fancy over efficiency.
---
If CCP targeted one alliance beyond all others, then the humans behind the accounts will just create new ones in other alliances.
---
A whole lot of botting is not that easy to distinguish from "regular" gameplay.  It's not like someone ratting in a VNI at the keyboard looks all that different from a bot.  About the only easy-to-measure way to detect a bot is how many hours per week they play.  Which the botters can counter by only running each account 12h/day.
---
CCP's preferred tactic appears to be to let the botters bot fairly obviously so that it's easy to catch them RMT'ing (easy targets make good starting points for following the money).  At which point they ban the buyers too.

I don't like joining an anti-dev crusade, but c'mon man, how were people supposed to take that post apart from 'the launcher isn't sourcing ads'?
---
If there's a good business reason to shove ads in our face then fair enough, I suppose (and, indeed, the launcher has done it for a long time), but justify it, don't try to pretend it isn't happening.
---
I suppose, but you end up having the same problem as if you died with it in your cargo hold if you get killed scouting your exit and can't get back in before the hole closes or your can expires.
---
So when can we expect you to evict them?
---
Optimal yield for a Rorqual with Capital Industrial Ships, Tech II Industrial Core, Drone Interfacing, Mining Drone Operation and Mining Drone Specialisation V, plus 2 Capital Drone Mining Augmentor II and one Capital Drone Mining Augmentor I, is 2700 per drone per minute. You can't go above that. 
---
Nah fam, that's the new coalition Voltard, it's legacy without TAPI because they were so embarrassed of them
---
No because for the chat system stuff was promised. The decision was due end of January. Wondering when ccp will let us know what exactly the decision was and when it will be implemented ingame.
---
The launcher is just shit since ever.
---
Fuck you!
---
Stratios. For no particular reason. It's an okay ship, but I absolutely love it.
---
Yeah you're probably right. 
---
The 17% are the extra bits for the 64 bit client.
---
&gt; I feel like this was made trough the sole lense of a player
---
Well, uh. See, the thing is. The thing about a launcher. Is it's used to launch a game. A game is used by, uh, players.
---
The launcher *absolutely should be* designed from the perspective of a player.
---
Hmmm, maybe get a better bot next time? Just sayin'.
---
A launcher doesn't do either of those things. It gets an OAuth token from the appropriate endpoint (which I assume you're allowed to do) and starts the Eve client passing it as a command line argument.
---
If you give me 10 billion isk I’ll represent you! I’m an eve lawyer, I’ve lost all my cases but I know yours will be my first win.

I am almost entirely certain that you and Elo have basically nothing in common
---
If Eve was a game that you only played for the PVP, then it wouldn't have permanent loss. A permanent loss game necessarily involves PVE -- how else do you generate the ships to lose? Some folks have tricked themselves into thinking that Eve has no PVE, but it's simply not so.
---
Maybe, maybe not but I respect that man.

They were part of the invading coalition, even if they took their ball and went home at the first sign of resistance, leaving their allies asses hanging in the wind.  Besides, killed keepstars were the victory metric used, and in that total war it was something like 16-2 south over north+east.
---
Its like saying the ottoman empire won world war one because they didn't get bled out in the trenches and weren't significantly invaded.
---
Sounds more like MSNBC
---
The Nighthawk when it use to be the ferox hull.  Was like having a skin back in the day with the red 9n it.  Now it is the ugly drake...  
---
The Launcher has more use requirements than just launching the game. It is designed to be _useable_ by the player, but a big point of such a thing is to help keep players informed. Like it or not, the fact is the launcher is not just about launching the game. 
---
It seemed believably in character for a skillu member.
---
I love the Imperial Navy Slicer - both for enjoyment in flying and because it was clearly designed by the Sefrim.

My other favourite ship is the Guardian, because Sarum, and a fleet logistics formation in red and gold, burnished by a far roseate sun is pretty close to divine.

Battleship skills are more forgiving. They are there to tank. You want to get cruiser skills maxed because it opens the door yo fly the most used ships. A lot of the content in the game relies on cruiser sized hulls

Lets say you have 50b liquid isk to replace your fleet ship losses, it will takes you take you forever to use all that up even if your alliance was feeding a lot and you were one of the unlucky people who got primaried. This is also assuming the alliance doesn't have SRP.
---
Since January 2018 I have lost 2 Lokis, feroxes and some bombers on my alts. This is while being on countless fleets and was logi often, and got on 2414 kills over that time period. I have lost about 2b in ships and they were actually SRP'd. So I havent lost any isk while playing the game for over a year.
---
I have enough liquid isk to play the game with my alliance pretty much forever without having to make ISK ever again.
---
If I find a wormhole to that region, I will go hunt some bots.
---
I always enjoy and am amused at the journals the newer players that get into pvp write up. Reminds me of when I first started in FW. Thanks for the read and nostalgia!

This is patently false.  When I first launched the new launcher, it was LARGER than the old.  Then, I followed your advice and shrunk the width, bringing it barely smaller than the old launcher, but still had 2 ads on it.  You may call them "news items", but face it, it is ad space.  I was suggested to upgrade to Omega, buy PLEX, and buy skins all in a few seconds while I was trying to get it small enough to hide them AS YOU SUGGESTED.

You have a huge subset of the playerbase that goes out of their way to avoid PVE, and it's easy because they dont have to PVE at all after a point. Thats my point.
---
But it seems like you want all those players to quit the game.
---
it's to rep a pos... 
---
Normally I just shitpost on reddit.
---
That was worth reading,  thank you for shareing. 
---
Almost makes me wish I had given gw a shot.    Maybe one day an wyredalpha might make an appearance....
---
Well,   now I know what I'm doing tonight....

Who's down to recruit an obvious alpha alt fw with shit skills?    :) 
---
Well at 117% it must be half done.

I remember when the worst thing to read in Intel channels in null was that there was a roaming cyna. So damned agile. Form a fleet? He'll just warp around safes and log off for a bit 
---
Glad you’re having fun out there!
---
TNT is not a bad group at all, despite my occasional trash-talk about them. 😊
---
Not sure if thats a joke or not, theres a lot of junk around for the scooping and this is eve, where pilots never fail to amaze.
---
Huge subset? Got any numbers to back that up? That sounds like a total ass-pull.
---
Which is why they no longer communicate with the community unless it's a Spelling Error 'bugfix'. 
---
Or just don't be a salty fucker and be quiet instead.
---
We do recruit obvious alpha alts with rubbish skills :D
---
It probably doesn't help that banned bots and RMTers no doubt flood them with requests in the hopes of slipping through the cracks. (Because, why not try.)
---
I don't envy them having to sift through that shit looking for legit cases. 
---
I never noticed, always just logged on to alliance services for time conversions. I can see it being very useful if you have no IT nerds having fun.

Multiboxing, botting, injectors ..... Remapping, implants, all irrelevant.
---
Somewhere in the not too distant past, CCP said that they were or are thinking about getting rid of attribute system and the learning implants altogether and flattening out skill training rate, but I guess they never followed up on it or got around to it. And I don't remember where I saw it, but it is somewhere.
---
No chief CCP has the right to terminate accounts 
---
From a technical perspective, I get why they dropped the IGB.
---
Maintaining a separate browser entirely within the game adds both a massive vulnerability and a bunch of tech debt without a lot of benefit.
---
You should come post amarr victor in local :D
---
Its just to keep the inhib alive.
---
Bad fit: no remote SEBOs.

Don’t know about that.  I’ve only fought INIT in subs and they didn’t blob, just provided some good tough fights.

I can’t attest to 2019 INIT as I don’t have any newer experience with them.

If you read first post in linked thread (where OP is asking for custom game launcher creation service), the message from Falcon is pretty clear - custom launcher wasn't allowed.

I was really expecting a new cyno ~~skin~~ appearance
---
Panfam without horde, Snuffed Out, skillu, scourge, wormhole groups like HK, Lazerhawks and Inner Hell. Ofc you will find outliers that are getting isk on an alt, and NC. has become more of a krab alliance in recent years.
---
There are just a ton of people who dont need to PVE anymore because they got the ISK they needed and their alliances have good SRP.
---
False statement. 
---
Have you ever even tried it ? Go ahead and make a VNI on a fully skileld toon and do some L4s, full clears on the big ones, just for kicks and lulz. Just so you can see for yourself. You try to do that auto-orbit shit instead of manually piloting and watching your transversals you and your VNI will be very dead, very fast and killed by those mobs. Not to mention drone agro management to boot. Go ahead, test it.
---
You can distinguish such a pilot from a bot with extreme ease.
---
The only thing I can think of is that the NS anoms themselves are so incredibly fucked up that they are actually easier to do PvE wise then the L4s. This can of course be very easily changed by CCP, but that would require willingness on their part to do so, which they do not have.
---
They're a good corp, go for it! 
---
that was my first thought too lol. "then it'd stick onto my screen"
---
Fair enough.  
---
It just seemed to be a naff answer, you know?  It's not very substantive and doesn't even address the thrust of the user's question.

That’s not how that works but okay

---
&gt;Have you ever even tried it ? Go ahead and make a VNI on a fully skileld toon and do some L4s
---
That's totally the subject at hand when discussing botting in Omist.  :eyeroll:
---
Also, you appear to be unaware that a bot is being actively controlled by software.  It doesn't just orbit and launch drones.  That's what at-the-keyboard players do.  If you took a nanosecond to think about this you'd realize that orbit and launch drones wouldn't be a terribly effective Nyx bot.
---
L4 missions are not at all hard to bot.  No PvE in EVE is hard to bot.  No PvE in *any* game is hard to bot.  It's all a simple state machine, which you can easily counter with your own simple state machine.

Ok chief because another defector that left Horde with me in a fairly high spot told me, Hordes caps are deployed with PL and NC doing other stuff.

It's not his job, but a community manager isn't just a mouth piece. He should be advising them on communities needs and wants. Granted they don't have to listen to him but it's not just "repeat this shit to players and take the heat". Also Falcon probably wears more than just 1 hat. 
---

These guys are pretty cool ...and love gud fights !

Nope never mined once. Just saying game sucks cause this path is super accessible (pun intended) and makes the whole loss factor the game is built on irrelevant cause replacing anything has become pennies.
---
Get all racial frigates, destroyers and cruisers to level 4 (in whatever order ships are being used by your group), it's total of about 3 weeks of training and will allow you to join virtually any regular fleet of whatever group you're in. Then fly, fly, fly more, try fleets, small gang, solo, as much as you can and don't be afraid trying new things. From there, keep flying and see what you like the most, then focus accordingly.
---
If you like flying as logistics pilot: set your goal for logistic frigates and logistic cruisers, starting with Kirin and Deacon for frigates, Scimitar and Guardian for cruisers.
---
If you like flying tackle: Interceptors (Amarr/Minmatar &gt; Gallente &gt; Caldari), Interdictors (Minmatar &gt; Caldari &gt; Amarr), maybe even assault frigates (any is viable).
---
If you like being part of main fleet: focus on whatever your group uses, one ship at a time.
---
If you like solo or small gang - find a ship you feel comfortable with, then focus on it or its direct improvements. For potential new ships, Tech3 Destroyers, Assault Frigates, maybe Heavy Assault Cruisers, Loki, combat Battlecruisers might be good direction that's not covered by basic tech1 cruiser down hulls.
---
As general advice - focus on one ship at a time, and preferably prioritize by usage options, while still staying in what you like flying, that way you won't be stuck in a situation where you can fly several different ships on meh level and not being able to bring something you like and have great performance in. When you get to experience a bit more of what people fly and how various ships are used, you'll have much easier time setting up your goals.
---
Considered joining a corp with an athanor or two? 
---
I wonder if there still are people camping that hole, I cant even fly dreads lmao
---
For my daily driver, I prefer my Buzzard. My corp mates always try to talk me into an Astero, but I just love the Tech 2 covops too damn much.
---
see, like i said, works every time
---
don't be a cheap ass, and pay them enough
---
No, the job of this ship is to keep the cyno inhib alive. the inhib doesn't have enough armor or shield HP to stop it from being volleyed. So, you just rep all the flavors so your inhib stays up and enemy capitals can't come in at zero.
---

Dont throw isk at him either, wont know what to do with it... from someone that knew an eoh banker that would only help when necessary, 1mil when in frigs, 10 mil to take thedge off my first cruiser etc. It was harder, but way better learning.

Why was the color scheme changed from white (ready to start an account) and green (account is running) to blue and grey respectively?  Grey for a running account makes no sense to me at all.

Look dude , you turned against all just because some assholes, are you so limited ? There are a lot of good ppl in this game , even in TEST, you should of looked for another corp (fuck language barrier , i talked to ppl through google translator many times). I can bet you can join any other corp if you proove to be loyal. Doing all that camping and the killing of your ex-mates stuff won't improove your life anyway . And in the end pls camp the ones that done this to you not all of us, we are at fault for your situation.

Everything prior to 2016 when the first launcher was released that featured dedicated advertisment space did not include ads beyond a tiny text based notification.

Thank you
---
Their bot gilas are kinda meh but the rattles can drop half a bil.
---
Need: hyperspatial sabre, dps ship able to break active tank. EM/Thermal damage preferred.
---
Find the pos bot uses to warp to, log off sabre close to the shield, find out it's behavior (a couple logins to see how long the bot takes to go back to krabing), log in as the bot is in warp to new site, put bubbles around pos, wait for it to land, log in/ jump in the dps.
---
It's a bit sad it's near to impossible to catch those bots using in-game mechanics. You would need to jump into system, find out where he is and get tackle within 10 seconds.

---
Oh, it's... wait. Whatever my favourite ship is (previous include Tengu, Orthrus, Widow, Broadsword - in varying order) got nerfed into the ground in whatever aspect made them so fun for me. So yeah, I expect Marshal (at least they can't nerf SARO skin look) nerfs coming.

Loki is great for exploring, ratting and pvp. Vargur is also great if you're interested in high level pve. Other people mentioned muninns/HACs.

Great little read. Thanks!

Finally, a short stainguy shitpost.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/agks8j/any_good_botting_program/ so you posted asking for bot program 3 weeks ago, and now you got banned
---
Not to mention, lots of people pay for the game already.  Also, lots of ad networks don't really validate the ads they're showing and thus can show scammy or outright malicious ads.
---
The real question is why has CiX been sitting AFK on teamspeak for 5 months?

They used to use a launcher ~~years~~ a decade ago, pretty sure this was in 2007, note the whole picture is promotional content. http://i.imgur.com/gX9eRKk.jpg

&gt; good business reason to shove ads in our face
---
"We can make more money this way!"
---
Followed soon after by "Wow, let's add more ads!"
---
And then "...Why are our pageviews down?"
---
Tbf, the number of people who rage quit over this Vs the number who will click on the ads, buy the skins, buy the packs etc... There is no way to justify not doing it... Falcon wouldn't have had any way to fight it, these decisions are always data driven, and I'd be 100% sure the data supports putting ads there... Also every other game launcher does it... The old launcher did it... I don't know what all the drama is about... In fact here is a post from 2016 about ads in the launcher: https://forums-archive.eveonline.com/message/6447009/

You always have to choose quality vs. performance, unless you have a very high performing PC.

You can filter that shit out, it just needs more knowledge than installing your cookie-cutter adblocker or alike. You can strip down pretty much all of the "web" to 1998 times. Certain things wont work or outright break but that´s fine in my book. Haven´t looked into the launcher thingy but it should work.

Especially the south- and the northeastern nullsec regions really need more npc space, imo.

I like to go to [Zkill's Abyss PVP feed](https://zkillboard.com/kills/abyssalpvp) and think of it as "cruisers who have cleared a T3 at least once" as you have to finish a T3 site in order to enter the PvP arena to be killed by a player.

I eagerly logged in thinking this was the new launcher.  Thanks for the letdown, jerk.

I got a hard on for Loki's ATM.  Though for looks nothing beats a procurer.  Like a space hot rod.

This really isn't a good example, given that these promotional pictures did not display beyond this. I'd be 100% fine with the launcher if I didn't see the same promotional material everytime I launched it. 
---
They also eventually switched to the client login for a much longer time than that launcher was in use.

Megathron with neutron blaster cannons. The purest form of PVP is driving into someone and unloading Caldari Navy Antimatter L into them from 5km
---
Well first off maybe I'm not on reddit all day like you. So bitching about me not replying right away just makes you sound like a massive socially inept neckbeard. Secondly getting kills solo/small gang is a lot harder than whatever the hell you're doing AFK krabbing and mining. Thirdly this isn't some kind of negotiation. It's not like we're trying to negotiate a middle ground between the bumfuckery farmsville simulator you want to play, and the HTFU pvp centered Eve that we used to have.  
---
Honestly if you're so afraid of combat because perfect intel local isn't there to hold your baby dick when you take a piss, maybe you should crawl back to highsec. You have all the mechanical advantages being a krab in Eve: Local giving you perfect intel on who is where, citadels making it so you are safe in every system you krab, alliance only gates making it so you have pathways to avoid pipes where there could be camps, and lastly the super umbrella which has been proliferated to an insane extent.
---
Do the 4 and 5 filaments have a chance to drop from lvl3s? 
---
Remote Shield rep Loki's are god mode as well.  
---
Or just block the ad provider through your hosts file. 
---
Best launcher for me would be a simple elegant log in screen like it used to be in 2007......
---
"I see krabs die daily." What a genius reply here. Counter point: I don't think enough are dying. What now?  
---
Funny that considering krabs like you have local, citadels, alliance only gates and a super cap umbrella to make you safe, taking just ONE of those things away suddenly means I want CCP to hand me kills on a silver platter.
---
Likely based on the training times on the skill queues and whether some skills have a trained level greater than the active level. 
---
But what happens when a very skilled player uses his credit card? Player skill is not part of the pay to win equation. If player A has the same skill as player B, but player B uses his credit card for better ship fittings who wins? Player B has paid to win.
---
I think the words you should be looking for is "oh well that makes sense, thanks."
---
Theres nothing truly wrong with protection rackets in Eve. Nothing. If you dont like it, dont rent from them or fight them, your choice.
---
While slowcats were an issue for fleet fights, they were laughably easy to ignore in almost every other situation. They weren't the best ratting ship, they weren't the best subcap counter on their own. They were isolated in their OP in 1 specific part of fights/space.

This was when the previous iteration on the launcher left beta, it entered beta sometime in 2015. 
---
that I have no idea
---
If you have anything additional to offer besides three contextless contracts please feel free to DM me.  If not I'll follow up on what you have but let's be honest here it's not much to go on.  Best case scenario he cops to it when I hit him up but likely not.  If these alone were proof enough of RMT I'd suspect ccp would have done something by now
---
I can't go off the ramblings of the town crazy person alone, people deserve the benefit of the doubt.  If KWG were truly as full of botters and RMTers as everyone claims, they probably wouldn't be so broke so goddamned always and might have made rent on time once a year and not lose feythabolis.  Food for thought.
---
All you credit card warriors just don't like being told you are paying to win.
---
F.  That hurt to watch. 
---
.. and remaining omega time.
---
Dude I wasn't saying that thread was about this launcher, just that people have been worrying and complaining about launcher ads for a long time, so it's not a new problem and everyone should stop acting like CCP just shocked everyone with the move...
---
Any help how to fix?
---
Personally I have the most fun in scimitars or stilettos

---
Sauce for the tabs plz
---
Eh I don’t care all that much. I can fly all that I can afford to fly. 
---
To be honest it's not really the ads that are the issue to me it's the concern that these give me the impression of what's to come and will most likely become more of a trend of CCP. It shows details of the plan they may have ahead. I just really don't want it to get to the point where you can't do something unless you have watched an add.
---
Could you imagine it, click undock and... Oh wait here's a ten second add... Jump a gate.... Oh wait you have to watch this add during the transition...
---
I know that's a huge escalation to what it is currently, but the more these things slip In unnoticed, or undetested the more they will push the barrier of their money grabbing campaigns.

/thread

It was literally complaining just a little over 3 months from when the client login(where ads were not included beyond text across two lines above the login) was done away with in favour of the launcher that featured ads. 
---
No one was complaining about the text above the client login that was about promotional material because it wasn't obtrusive. It was 2 lines of text.

If you factor in drone travel time you'll be looking at between 2500 on a small rock. And 2000 on a big rock. Then repositioning from rock to rock. When 1 is mined up will take a good 5 min total aswel.

What the fuck is happening in this thread? Very lost lol
---
I swiped my credit card ones to fit up a quite blingy Golem once to run lvl 4 missions. That's been ages ago and I lost it to a tornado gank. Not worth it at all.
---
Love the Hype, problem is you have no chance of getting a fight in one. People know you will tank their entire gang so they either don’t engage or bring a Bhaalgorn. 
---
Technically untrue.   
---
They can terminate accounts; but terminating an account without any valid reasons doesn't work in real life.  
---
EULA != Law
---
Now with 20% more launcher free!
---
Name one pay to win game where player skill doesn't matter? I personally do not of any. Even in the most pay to win games you still need to know how to use what you buy. Where the problem lies is when skilled players use their credit cards for an advantage. If there are two players of equal skill but one has a credit advantage the one who pays wins.
---
Why do people keep thinking what is written in the EULA is always valid. 
---
You cannot terminate an account without a valid reason, else you'll get fucked in court over it. Ask Blizzard, they know.
---
This is actually a good post
---
Not pissed. Just sad. 
---
Try the cap battery permatank fit. Got fuckloads of kills in mine. It tanks over 1500dps with blue pill and mid grade crystals and it’s so engageable because people assume it’s the XLASB fit so they hang around thinking you have limited tank only to find out you can keep going till downtime. 
---
All my accounts are omega, yet I still get a big "upgrade" advertisement in the middle.  Apparently there's room for the ad, and room for 40% empty space, but not enough room to display my whole account name...
---
Is the answer because it was fun?
---
so what im suggesting is that you kind of work your way from frig up. start with one or 2 racial frigs get them to 5 and then work on supporting skills for t2 frigs that interest you. do the same for destroyers and at that point you should have a pretty good idea of what t2/t3 cruiser you wana work for.
---
This guy fucks 
---
Because I don't want you to freak out - Your character name and profile picture are public information. They're included in lots of locations of third party websites, such as zKill.
---
When I needed some example users to create the mock-up I just picked some characters off the latest-kills on zKillboard and copied and pasted their pictures and names. The screenshot you see your name on isn't a real launcher and it can't be used to log into your account, it's just an example of how it *could* look using the names / pictures of random users :-)
---
I got 17% less on mine. Fuck this! Fuck ccp!
---
Your example is kinda far fetched. A restaurant like that would go out of business in no time with these signs.
---
EULA and by extension any game TOS are just rules put in place by the publisher. If you break it, they will punish you, but if you abide by it, they cannot do anything.
---
Banning people for no reason is ground for a lawsuit, even if you are not a paying customer.  
---
But tbh, OP is probably bait or lying anyway.
---
I found setting a goal for a ship wasn't a good idea. Setting a goal for what you want to do and how efficiently you want to do it is much better.
---
I personally kept finding myself in a ship I wanted not enjoys what it was used for.
---

Internet issues in 2019\*

Pretty much this. At this point I've probably self destructed/death cloned enough learning/crystal/slave pods that it would have been more cost efficient to just buy injectors. I guess if nothing else me being dumb and lazy has helped contribute to the implant economy so that's nice.
---
That's pretty damn cool.
---
I'll take a gander that you'll never visit Iceland for Fanfest? 
---
&gt;Maybe if small roaming gangs didn't get shat on by magically appearing caps there would be more fun. 
---
More fun for who?
---
The people dropping supers on you do so because they don't want to fight you and they are superior enough to you that you can't do anything about it.
---
With a few hundred million, just fly to a system called Jita, and dock in the Jita 4 moon 4 station. That is the biggest trade hub in the game, and the buy orders there will be better than anywhere else.

He is actually correct, but the rules don't include goons/test and they have pretty much disappeared because they only applied to people in a certain group in horde and now that group is dead.
---
Tengu, Its so sleek and sexy, plus railguns are cool.
---
The Kikimora. It's very poweful for a t1 destroyer and i can be an absolute mongoloid with it and still have fun. Kinda pricey to fly through for a t1 ship.

3 toons doing avatar V, two doing gal frig V

Smh

F.
---
You. motherfucker...  I was so happy there for a second
---
community and customer is the same thing for eve ;p but regardless what people whine about people see new skins on the launcher some will probably bite
---
the omega thing I don't get though, people already know even if they didn't already shove it down your face :|
---
&gt;I'd be 100% fine with the launcher if I didn't see the same promotional material everytime I launched it.
---
I 100% agree,  just saying they've done that kinda thing before 
---
and I forget the exact log in mechanics over time, but it was just easier to use the exe file for a long time. 
---
I hope the logs show that they are fucking morrons when they petition their loss 
---
If they are the ads for omega and skins and such that i have seen i honestly do not see the big deal. The launcher has shown these ads since i've started playing at least just smaller on the side.
---
Practically every launcher for an MMO that i have played have had similar ads, especially f2p ones.
---
It is absurd to suggest that a little ad in the launcher is making or breaking your decision to play EVE.  
---
It was never needed before I think. 
---
And salvaging V?
---
I was told by some guys in theran that because a corp switched from theran to FRT and they wanted to lock the corp out of their assets in spite, they revoked FRT docking rights.. and it generally went sideways from there, if its true is hard to say.
---
I have pretty much given up trying to chase them, either they’re arty fit and you’re dead before you get close, or they’re AC fit and you’re dead as soon as you get close. Either way, you can’t tackle one in a frigate without some luck 
---
Need to use a logoff trap with dictor and find out bot settings by logging in a few times in various intervals. Best if you land on his pos and bubble as the bot is still in warp to new site.
---
Hecate. Fast, high DPS and decent survivability, as a bonus I can fit probes
---
You don't have to be upset just because Crimea chose freedom
---
T1 everything up to BC, then start over with T1 frigates from whichever race’s style you liked best from flying those. Midterm goal should be the assault frigate and interceptor for the race you pick. Long term, aim for the T2 cruiser for your favorite style. Pick up a bubble, boosh, HIC, T3C, and logi along the way, but don’t try to jump straight to those (bubble/Sabre being the only exception maybe). 
---
Daaaaum, dude. 
---
This is a good step but there needs to be more usable space on the launcher.  This is not negotiable.  The launcher exists to launch people into the game, the reduction in available real estate in the new launcher hinders this primary function.  While I will fully agree that it looks nice and slick and it may have been time to upgrade the launcher for one reason or another, reducing or impeding its primary functionality is a less than favorable design choice.
---
I do not have access to your dataset, but I consider myself a fairly average, low-key player.  As of this moment I have 7 accounts, most of which just exist to train towards something, I rarely login to them.  7 accounts may seem like a lot to some, and pitifully few to others, but the fact remains that with my somewhat reasonable number of 7 accounts, I cannot see all of them immediately when opening the new launcher.  I can, however, see a giant button that says "UPGRADE TO OMEGA!" even though all my accounts are already Omega.  I would have thought that someone spending $900+/yr whose current accounts have no further opportunity for monetization would not be shown something like this.
---
I see there's a mouse-over animation on the news items in the launcher.  Have you considered having a collapsed list without thumbnails that expand on mouseover, so as to present the same amount of information while making more space available to the account list?  I don't know how difficult that would be to implement but this is a QOL improvement that took me about 10 seconds to think of.
---
Final thought in this rambling post: I suspect this feedback would have been received sooner if it were easier to switch to the beta launcher.  I initially checked it out but decided against trying it when I realized I'd have to re-enter each account.  If you can figure out a way to get the beta launcher to carry over existing accounts, you'll likely have a much wider test and feedback base for future launcher updates.

Pipe it to a 2nd machine via display mirroring if you wanna go the ‘pro steamer’ route. That machine does the production/streaming work.  I’ve personally not had a huge issue just recording on a single machine, given local storage can save fast enough not to bog up your RAM with buffered video.  
---
I’d check to see if the target disk is stuck perpetually at 100% while recording. It really doesnt stress much else in the system.
---
Congratulations, assuming you're completely right about the predilections of every member of the groups you named, you've still only named a tiny percentage of Eve's playerbase. 
---
I wouldn't recommend it after this post:  https://forums.eveonline.com/t/wtb-software-dev-services-for-eve-launcher/130823/5

i got banned for more then 5 months ago, i have really good prove that ccp made a mistake.
---
bot program is one of the ways to pay them back. ofc im not stupid enough to run them from same pc.
---
im still looking for anyone that take this serious, i believe we can take them down. they deserve it
---
But that would make all POS attack targets regardless of standing.
---
Nyx.

Look at the battle report and count the number of titans each side brought. 
---
Wow, this launcher is a good vintage. 967872 is a little more than three years old. Provided you've been keeping it's vaccinations up to date you should be able to enroll your launcher in kindergarten this year.
---
For serious though, I'm not 100% sure because I haven't seen it for a very long time, but isn't this a screenshot of the [old launcher that was discontinued in early 2016](https://www.eveonline.com/article/changes-to-os-minimum-requirements)?
---
The solution is to use the currently supported launcher, which you can get here: https://www.eveonline.com/download
---
I've had omegas with 40m+ SP go alpha and it still changed, even when nothing is in skill queue
---
Got that reference. 
---
God I want HW3. 
---
at least you can now buy the new skin pack for 3500 PLEX with just a click! isn't that what you people want? the marketing department can't possibly be wrong!
---
That you mentioned race, I honestly haven’t flown many diff races, since I’ve been mostly exploring since I started. I’m wondering what should I be looking for in a race, I know they all specialize in different guns and playstyles, or do I just try each one of them 
---
apparently I typed that sentence wrong and just never looked back at it after posting.
---
January 2016 is when the previous launcher we were using left beta(it was available sometime in 2015), I found a screenshot of Dominion back from 2009, so at least 7 years of ad-free logins were available. 
---
The promotional material wasn't being shoved in anyone's face.

Hey, thanks for sharing.
---
I was an Eagle pilot in that fight and had a blast. 
---
to be honest a birth date for the character is much less useful than an SP count Someone who started a character 10 years ago and then took an 8 year break  and started playing 2 years back is just as misleading as an injector user.
---
this is awesome im stealing it
---
just like the chat system they fixed the launcher. soon the option to opt out will most likely be removed, and perhaps a few years later we will get the old launcher back...
---
I swear this community gets riled up over the stupidest of things.
---
But since im here.
---
Where the fuck are my shield slave implants?
---
pretty much.   although I've been per/wp mapped for years just training all the spaceship command and gunnery skills.  If I need it I'll throw an int/mem skill in the queue and just let it go whenever they come out.  the only way I'll go back to int/mem now is if I feel like doing all the science/industry skills, lets just say that wont happen unless I train literally everything else.
