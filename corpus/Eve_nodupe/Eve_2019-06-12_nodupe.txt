The best way to achieve that is to leave goons.
---
---
---
There was a few factors for this, caps weren't formed or logged in at the time, rage pinged.
---

---
Caps had no fleet and it was kinda confusing, we had to jump into the sub fleet and jump in.
---
&gt;“Dangerous Unknown” do not have non-combat data/relic sites, C1-C3 do and will have the “Unknown Space” in their info.
---
Does this mean for a C3+ wormhole, you'd need to have something like an Astero with weapons/drones or even a cloak to have a realistic chance of getting anything?
---
Utilising renters alone doesn't help. Xdeath tried that and look what happened to them. And you are very much laughing at you own members for dying.  
---
  
---
Conclusion: you have no idea what the successmodel of gsf is built on and youre just spilling koolaid out of your ass here.
---
oh yeah agree, if they toke you for a spin fuck em
---
original title was better
---
Goons do not lie. They are doing exactly what they said they would do to the North.
---
Any particular corp you'd suggest to look at within the alliance?  I like the idea of smaller.
---
That’s 300 more it should be worth
---
Was gonna "akchewally" re: dread insurance till I saw your ticker

Why you shouldn't post before re-reading your title
---
CCP has had years to deal with this problem, but they've plugged their fingers in their ears and thumbs up their asses going "la la la, Titans too expensive, no one can spam them" and now they need to deal with it. 
---
For all intents and purpose, this is the game that CCP envisioned, if out of sheer incompetence and inability or unwillingness to pay attention. They're so focused on making money and bringing in new players that end game content like Titans are just ignored.
---
CCP will probably just introduce some kind of super titan and try to kick the can down the road a couple more years, and we'll just have more of the same problem.
---
Goons are PIBCing the game. That was the plan with the viceroy shit, and thats the plan now. Look at the map. Two years ago you slowly began working your way, keepstar by keepstar from cloudring north. Then you got to GOTG and got them to roll over, negotiate terribly for peace, ultimately bend the knee. 
---
Now with M-O gone, things will work their way on over to Geminate/Horde space after the renter space falls.
---
I don’t blame the “entity” goons. What other gameplay could they possibly engage in? But I do blame the individual line member of goons who folds themself into this boring and game killing gameplay that CCP’s mechanics have permitted. 
---
Tl;dr leave goons. Join and corp where your individual contribution and presence makes a difference. The game will be more rewarding, I promise.
---

---
More like "Why you don't need to vote anyone"
---
Question, why would your distance to gate matter if the camp was on the other side?
---
Like some kind of cloaky ship, with a small mass, and a small sig.  It should also do high damage.  It would also be good if they had some kind of AoE damage, so they can fight a-symmetrically as well.
---
Destroying the game was literally their mission statement when they joined eve.
---
You will not kill any NPCs there with a Astero, the combat sites there are done by gangs in t3c, Rattlesnakes, and Nestors.
---
If you find a gas site there, and bring in a huffing Venture you can get a easy 20-50m isk before the sleepers come.
---
This genie your trying to fix, it’s out of the bottle
---
&gt;Regarding the difference between "emergent" and "exploitative", one is something that CCP is on record touting as a thing that makes EVE great
---
They apparently also think injectors are great, and we know they are reluctant when it comes to fixing things, so that statement means nothing.
---
&gt;So. I think understanding the difference between the two concepts is pretty important. 
---
The is no well defined universal difference. Its a matter of opinion and what reasons you have to back it up while taking into account intentions and what is objectively good.
---
&gt;Regarding NDAs, if you don't know and you look it up, mission fucking accomplished. So please do.
---
I do know what it is. What are the things currently in the game from a health standpoint that you think should have been under NDA?
---
and thats why people like you lose capital battles
---
You just said '1000 of x is fine because we can always upship'.
---
This is n+1 at its core.  Same ol 2004 argument.
---
please do!
---
Banning goons is silly. Making titans unable to project any damage on subcaps would be a good start.
---
If only there were some group in Eve that would be willing to fight against someone with overwhelming supercap supremacy.  If only such a group had ever existed.
---
Man, I don't even fly supers and that's sexy AF. Time to inject...
---
upvoted a brothabob post for honesty
---
Fellow PH here. Just form a fleet, go do the stuff you want to do. If you don't want to lead, ask someone to do it.
---
Yes. They primarily focus on logi.
---
Source. Dual boxed logi today and i waa always getting hit. Easy to rep dps ships when they aren't getting shot.
---
The thing is when you log in, you usually log in because you want to do something. A pop up at log in is an annoyance at worst, a distraction at best, either way it get's closed as soon as it appears  because it's in the way, like that annoying cobweb walking to your car
---
I know I’m going to draw a lot of fire here, but I only see eve surviving if they fire up a new server and fix the super proliferation (Mebbe at same time don’t have skill extractors?) 
---
Yes, I know folks will bitch about deciding the population, but anyone else have a better idea to the problem?
---
You're not wrong. I have a serious distaste for Omeca, still voted for him.
---
Test alliance best alliance
---
Lenny was selling isk, not buying it. All the isk he had he made legitimately, as the third party casinos were perfectly legal before his ban
---
How much?
---
\*can't\*
---
ouch
---
I took it , funny enough, I logged in, undocked and found content, had fun.
---
Who pays 20 bil for a super?
---
Jesus im a low sec shitlord and i can find plenty of better deals then that lol
---
RIP suspect
---
Can we stop trying to bring more burst damage into the game? I'm pretty sure a fledging alliance with their first dread fleet will love getting instantly deleted by a bombing run of blops by cap hunters.
---
Yes, lets turn 2020 eve into nano teleport gangs everywhere, blinking in and out of existence, invalidating missiles and drones as a weapon system.  Sounds fun.
---
I want period basis.
---
Conman would have saved it if he was still around :'(
---
The cycle is complete
---
Just able to train cruiser today. Feel like in actually getting somewhere. My gnosis can handle pretty much any anom/site I find in my .5 home. Can't wait to fly my first VNI
---
We sort out which corp you go to during the recruitment process.  Our Alliance doesn't really separate activities by corp very much.  We're one family.
---
I'll drop you a PM.
---
Good thing goons built all those Titans in secret. If people actually knew, they would have spent these years building up a counter fleet.
---
Lol ok then
---
Already done, there was only one titan confirmed in install from May 8th. The extra parts may likely be, oddly enough, undelivered but completed jobs from a dude or several people who afked, it’s hard to say exactly. However, only one titan was installed in the timeframe that would make it undeliverable. A week before the goons hit the services off, there was no major activity that would warrant the current killmail, leading to the AFK player theory. 
---
I posted a bunch of this in TiS discord with graphs. Also, while I won’t release the name for privacy’s sake, the titan builder was, as far as I can tell, unaffiliated with NC, PL, WERMT, HORDE and or any other Northern groups. I could look again, maybe I’m blind in the dudes activity.
---
Yes
---
No, no, no. Fixing titans and super by making....new titans and supers. I understands there idea of making something to kill the current ones but not by making a t2 version
---
Be like honest bob
---
Fucking. What.
---
A trillion isk isn't really all that much these days. There are hundreds of people with that kind of isk laying around.
---
No, but apparently you and Gobbins are the only people who actually believe Sort paying off Goons with the full knowledge of PANFAM leadership was a "backstab". Most of the coolaid swilling newbeans don't even believe it.
---
New feature: Mouse Cynos. There are certain areas of the screen that when the mouse enters them will automatically jump the mouse to the likely intended part of the screen.
---
Nice, Gnosis is very flexible, cruiser hulls are great, lot more tank and DPS than frigs, but they still don’t break the bank.
---
Just remember to have a goal, or you will get stuck train the next thing wondering what you are going to do with it.
---
3 years ago...
---
I’ve tried, but there’s a couple problems. Sunesis has good align, scanning and tank, but the speed is ass, and the extra time spent in a site means more Chance of getting ganked, plus the hacking is shit for an alpha.
---
I was more referring to the fact that at one time or another he's turned on who he was with to the point that at this point in time he's turned on everyone at least once.
---
I fully endorse this statement!
---
there are alternative ways to make isk, but not alternative ways to get cheap ore and easily convert it into titans.
---
In Nullsec I always found Tribute to be a very giving exploring region. Stain is also good. Otherwise go wormholes C1-C3.
---
nano kite/ewar has always been the answer to fighting a superior force unless you up ship. Also just drop sentry drones if you don't want to wait for them to fly all the way there just for the gang to leave hell it's pretty much what the ishtar meta was. I got nothing for you on missiles although i do think they need some re-tuning
---
whats old is new again
---
I disagree. 4 stabs increases lock-on time a huge amount increasing period of risk. Also created a false sense of security. Better to have inertia lows and a damage control.
---
Maybe there's more profit in edgelord'ing because this boy scout's wallet isn't that deep. I pay for my subs but no way can I throw $100's if not $1,000's toward pushing them into Titans.
---
Yeah when we ran them a week ago or so the logi was target pretty heavy. And jammed, neuted, etc.
---
1 conduit each time.
---
Keep this hard work CCP.
---
Seriously, who cares about kicking a sandcastle if you bring a zillion shovel trucks?  Especially when kicking sandcastles has basically devaluated into a game of whack-a-mole to begin with?
---
Nobody cares about ISK losses in a game where the economy has been completely messed up for years, unless there's actually a fun fight behind it. 
---
Get Panfam to fight you and win it, and NOW you might have actually something to brag about.
---
Weird flex but ok
---
I still want to see rorqs actually buffed, anoms nerfed, and some sort of weird system that only allows X number of active industrial cores per grid or per system. Put that at 5 say. No more than 5 active rorqs per system. But ofc the risk is a huge spread, but the more you spread out the harder they are to defend.   
---
But something like that. All the nerfs they did hit smaller people more while not impacting goons at all.
---

fuck me, i shoulda bought plex on that sale couple weeks ago

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_x1fYm-VBk
---
it has when it was in the patch notes, and I used it as an example because it's a great example it's a minor change for nullsec while making wormholes well worse for all the pvp groups. 
---
Now it was solved by wormhole outrage granted but it makes a nice example of a CSM failure because well the same issue was raised before during noobmans CSM and was rejected because he made absolutely clear, all of wormhole space will come to Iceland to burn the CCP office down if that go's truth. 
---
Now we have examples of asset safety and jump clones during the citadel introduction both would have been horrible as well.
---
Now, most of these were stopped at one point or another because wormhole space had representation until last year but when we compare that to FW how didn't have a CSM we can see the sorry state that space is in, let alone the rest of lowsec.
---

Need someone to go police up the missing 10,000 pounds of newbros before they start structure bashing people's houses in Montana.
---
There could always be a massive explosion of the EVE gate. Reset civilization once more. Everybody starts from scratch.Never reintroduce some of the things that created such massive imbalance in the first place.
---
Not if your newer the game. A momentary annoyance is worth the possibility a retaining players and helping them grow.
---
If it did not pop up automatically then someone would have to know it exists in order to access it. The check box is very clear to me, I'm just saying that maybe you should check out the feature before you complain about it. And no, I don't feel that you can properly look over the feature and not see the check box.
---
Dont know of any discussion regarding safety of wormholers.
---
&gt;Now, most of these were stopped at one point or another because wormhole space had representation until last year but when we compare that to FW how didn't have a CSM we can see the sorry state that space is in, let alone the rest of lowsec.
---
So they ignored the community, and the CSM made it easier to justify doing so. Not good.
---
If you think the CSM are the cause of "good", then they are surely responsible for a ton of shit and right now the game is mostly shit.
---
I hear sentry's can shoot 150km+...
---
What's "crashing a gate"?
---
lol, well played
---
Be careful wielding that almighty edge. Don't want the readers to cut themselves on it. 😬
---
It is when they AoE doomsday the entire grid for 150k damage against all hull sizes through a cyno.
---
Nah, perimeter was great. Make Perimeter a Warzone Again

---
Honestly, if anything I’ve heard people complain about PH being too “sjw”, I don’t think Ive ever heard someone call us racists before.
---
The hull has a pretty hefty bonus (37.5%) to probe strength as well as +10 data/relic strength. 
---
The Sunesis has the same bonus to probe strength. The T1 scanning frigates (Magnate, Heron, Imicus, Probe) have half the virus strength (+5) of the Astero. 
---
If you have trouble scanning down the sites, the hull bonus ought to be what you're looking for. You'd have to get Covert Ops skill to 4 to beat it. 
---
Personally, I use the Heron/Buzzard hull since I want the extra mid slot for scanning upgrades.
---
You mean like 1000 dps T1 destroyers and 2000 dps T2 Hacs?  Trigs are the new special snowflake powerceep metric, and CCP seems to have no plans on stopping soon.
---
thats coz ur a carebare
---
"hull breach noises"
---
Fam I'm floored. Best post.
---
Progressing is an odd term in Eve. It all depends on what you want to do and where you want to be. I've done it all, but I mainly do Level 4 missions right now for loyalty points. You can do this fairly quick in the game. Progressing to bigger ships is great if that's a goal you want. I can fly two Titans, but my favorite ship is a HAC... which may take an Omega account a few months to get into.  I always tell new players to stay solo a bit and get to know the avenues of the game. But to answer your question... yes... you can be casual and progress.
---
&gt; Gallente Sentry Gun  39.3%  
---
dude made a mistake
---
Honestly the more casual you take it the more you’ll enjoy it. Tiny always said the minimum to play eve was 2hrs. Any less and you wont be able to get anything done. So sounds like you have enough time. I haven’t logged in in a few weeks and as a bitter vet can plex my second account in about the same amount of time you have.
---
- As a noob your skills take a while to mature, but they do so Regardless of you being logged in or not. So you won’t be frustrated as much not being able to do something today.
---
- as a bitter vet you won’t burnout like people do.
---
Just don’t do VNI ratting or mining cause then you wont get anywhere. 
---
I’d recommend spoopy noobies. A wormhole noob corp.  because wormholes rule, and you’re into exploration.
---
Fit?
---
I endorse this endorsement, the endorsor and the endorsed.
---
Really? My house has a basement? Why wasn't I informed?

Thanks for the help 😀

Same experience as other commenters, logi got attacked probably the most in our fleet.
---
[oprah_bees.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/dcubXtnbck0RG/giphy.gif)
---
&gt; *around 5mil-10mil ISK per site* 
---
That sounds about what you would get in low-sec.
---
I mean sorta like the bring up patch notes with people elected to the CSM if they go all good or well no issue there rightfully gonna assume their representative of the community, CCP is not gonna personally check there patch notes with me because well I'm not that important, so the best way to prevent your space regardless of where you live from becoming a wasteland is to try and push somebody onto the CSM. 
---
Now you might say that's wrong in moral terms and i can't give a shit because my end goal isn't the moral high ground it's to have a less shit game.
---
Frigates that can fly a single dread gun and have a short time siege module.
---
Honestly I couldn’t tell you what happened.  I hit warp and dock on my citadel, saw my screen go black, and walked away. came back ~1h later, saw i was in station and proceeded to start talking on comms, etc.
---
Couple minutes into reminiscing about recent kills i hear “Ria (me) you lost your blops??” to which i immediately ask no, why did he ask?
---
One linked killmail later, and a quick look at the pod (not sin) in my hangar, and im in shock trying to figure out what happened.
---
I heard about bugs with a server desync or something like that, and since i know i didnt hit the undock, i assumed it was that, and filed a ticket. a few exchanges later, server logs showed i hit undock a few minutes after docking...
---
current theory is that the keyboard which i abruptly tossed onto my bed from my lap hit the hotkey (which happens to be close to the edge of the board) to undock... and i then drifted sloooowly out of teather range, after which a pair of opportunistic bombers saw me, and took their chance.
---

---
Do you ever use "keep at range 40k" etc commands to help keep a baseline distance? And is the only good way to manually pilot pan your camera and double click to start going in that direction? I think that's the part that makes me get disoriented the most frequently, even if I can quickly re-orient it's still kind of exhausting.  
---
Thanks for all the insights o7

Gate gun helped a lot gotta say
---
&gt;Plex 100 accounts for a year
---
heh...ok.
---
Zoolander lol?
---
Also whoever made this please keep em coming.
---
Its almost as if the full time economist left the company
---
alt corp most likely but I'm not gonna buy into the NC/PL titan build theory as they had their own structures and it would be beyond dumb for them to do so... Horde on the other hand...
---
I think you guys should coordinate better before you post. The first guy is saying we don't undock, and you're claiming we're killing women and children. I CAN'T KEEP UP WITH THE NARRATIVE SWITCHES!!
---
No you?
---
Which is all based on if Goons feel like moving 1000 titans...
---
Yeah, CCP removed AOE DD's
---
&gt;https://zkillboard.com/related/30003629/201906091800/
---
This is far more accurate, just from the last 7 days I reviewed in M-O I alone see approx 1.5tril lost. I see Panfam are transferring structures out of alliance to avoid the KM's...
---
That came later. At first, they just removed the ability to shoot your doomsday through a cyno. Before that you could sit comfortably inside your POS and destroy an entire fleet from behind enemy lines.
---
&gt; but what is CCP going to do, ban goons
---
  Remove all forms of standings, good and bad- Every alliance is independent.
---
Yeesh the VNI is the low SP faction version of the AFKtar originally used to farm ECM-heavy rats in Deklein. Its tank is transversal. It became the ratting ship because it could shred stealth bombers, then SBs got nerfed. Cloaky t3 is one of the few cloakies that can eat it quick enough to avoid response fleet and creep out alive.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Drone-eating rat AI as part of the war against AFK isk farming has hurt the VNI and nobody thinks drones are superior weapon system. People have three of em going full tilt while pvping on their main.
---
You guys spent the first couple weeks of this thing going on and on and on about how much fun you were having killing undefended krabs in delve and how you were running the isk war up one rorq at a time, ect ect.  Thats where the women and children reference comes from.  The doesn't undock bit is true for your homelands,  or if you are undocking up there the battlereports arent making reddit, and god knows if you ended up a nickle ahead in one your side would be crowing for days about it.
---
Although I do note that these lol delve burning stupid goonies posts have largely stopped as your infrastructure losses have far far outpaced the isk value of undefended krabs that you can kill.
---
&gt; imagine being in panfam and leadership refuses to do anything at all, even harass or meme
---
  Imagine Goons running to lowsec after losing one fight during WWB- Oh shit that actually happened.

---
I have no real solution to the challenge of the titan N+1000 issue as from all that I read, any significant nerf would have all sorts of repercussions. 
---
Having said that, I think it would be hilarious to have stealth bombers capable of firing a torpedo that would destroy a titan. Immediately, every titan would have to be escorted by a fleet of 50+ defender destroyers when deployed, and still there would be a chance they would get hit and deleted. Most would never undock again. 
---
It would speak to the vision of EvE where loss was meaningful and liable to bring on a blind, consuming rage/despair, as opposed to the current 'already replaced' meta.
---
Not unlike the strategic change that forced naval powers to stop building ever bigger battleships when the humble submarine was introduced.
---
I imagine there would be a lot of players that might rage-quit, but for a while, the salt would flow like Spice.
---
Not everyone likes the play style of blue as many people as possible, if you’re in goons you’re blutral to about 3/4 of the nullsec population (blutral because I’m counting Legacy).
---
That’s exactly what happened to serenity and look how that went, dead server, dead game.
---
My style is kinda casual right now, I have about as much time as you and I’m really out of sync with my corp.
---
But I still get on, do my PI, and run anoms and gas sites, maybe mine a bit, camp some relic sites, export and contract stuff to Jita.
---
Skills are training, assets are rising, few times a month I can get on with everyone else good times are had.

You're not getting it are you? Those are screen caps of the head of the coalition, Noraus, saying he is directing all the botting. are you blind? That's not isolated, it's systemic.... get a clue

Lol, you really are as dumb as I've figured.
---
Hes mocking you.  Mocking you for being to weak to defend your home.  Mocking you for only being able to kill some dumb krabs.
---
Jesus, can I make it any clearer here?
---
Perhaps with unguided bombs and a battleship-sized weapon system, like torpedoes... And no cloak locking delay to make hit and runs easier.

Let's sprinkle some crack on him and jump the fuck out of here.

there is nothing unethical in automating a mindbogglingly stupid process you'd undertake anyway, especially when it's something like VOTING which shouldn't be difficult at all

I have run the Eve great on a client’s laptop that had this same CPU/iGPU, it’s a whole other class above the junk iGPU on intel chips.
---
This is the one, THE ONE, game you can transition from playing a shit ton to just a little bit, play every minute to just playing once every other week.
---
Reinstall your drivers, what is the actual laptop model?
---
/u/merkelchen do you need a tow?
---
1. Remove Excavators. Buff Exhumers. Rebalance Rorquals to be Super Heavy Jump Freighter for Asteroid Ore/Moon Ore/Minerals transportation.
---
2. Reintroduce passive moon mining with a moon re-balance that places a more geographical approach to moon mineral availability instead of just random seed, then make these moon minerals cycle quarterly to encourage fighting over resources and mobility of blocs.
---
2. Remove Entosis. Place sovereignty mechanics into a citadel with 2 cycles (with no fittings for guns/PDS).
---
3. Remove time zone vulnerability. Revert back to strontium-based maximum vulnerability window after initial reinforce, with defenders having the ability to change the stront volume to dictate timers before the attackers fully reinforce.
---
4. Reintroduce the repair of structures with triage/logi with a logistics cap that matches the damage cap (so the amount of damage on the structure wouldnt move if both parties were equally holding grid).  This would make sure that if both parties respond to the fight in massive blobs, the structure cannot be destroyed without one side actually taking control of the grid.
---
The biggest issues with the game, and the reason for nullsec 'stagnation', is that everyone has to play on the defender's schedule (such as stupid time zone tanking at 4AM in the morning) and the fact that if someone shows up on your doorstep with 1,000 titans, even a Keepstar will die in exactly 30 minutes of shooting (or 6 hours in TIDI at maximum TIDI), and theres nothing you can do about it because you'll never kill all their titans off in time.  Its a big reason in what has caused this chaos to happen, and why Goonswarm (of which I am a member) is completely unstoppable.  Even if we lose 30 titans shooting at your Keepstar, it will die, no matter what you do, because you'll never kill every titan before the damage capped application of damage to the Keepstar kills the Keepstar eventually.
---
Some would consider 1-2 hours a day to be ultra hardcore nolifing as they lament the 20 minutes per week they have to play entitles them to everything the game has to offer.
---
You're comparing apple's to weeds. As a PL member, we don't want to mass recruit..... I advise to stop comparing 2 different play styles against one another like they're both the "same path". I would quit Eve if we (PL) tried to be like the goons. I'm happy with dominating the meta as-is; and I can assure you the meta for the most content per hour is not titans.
---
Tl;dr lol
---
Yes, just don't take the 'proving conduit' if it's up. 😅
---
Were you baiting him, or did he just tackle you and it went from there?
---
they are a very good anti capital platform.
---
Subs counter them pretty well, literally just need tracking disruptors and sit at range with any HAC, you win
---
Im not in Goons, im not in NS, which allows me to approach this with a complete open mind.
---
I see a lot of PanFam folks crying about not being able to fight back because Goons are blue to everyone, I get they didn't want blues, I get they like that, thats rad. But I am also observant, and pay attention, and can read.  
---
NCPL whine about not being able to contest Goons, When they had in their capacity to create something that could. So they pushed away all their neighbours whom are now with Goons, loosely or directly....and they have literally done fucking nothing in terms of combat since WWB....shit they didn't even try to take a shit on CVA since then.  
---
So forgive me if im wrong, but it seems like PanFam was just as content as Goons to sit back and jerk themselves off ratting/mining and collecting rents/tributes....but now when presented with combat are completely choked and butthurt that EVE has allowed Goons to become super strong again...well of course it has, Goons spent 2 years securing borders and limiting war, NCPL just didn't play. So ya...im not buying the "we don't want blues thing" I think NCPL caved because they don't have anyone left except talking heads....and their community, like I said, is responsible for that, not CCP, and certainly not Goons.

Sorry tikk, you are too critical on this man. The new Agency is REALLY fucking good.

Second option, you can have as many omegas and alphas as you like, but the alphas con only be the single client running.

Sorry mate. The meta for content is no longer titans. Mine all you want but they aren't the content factories like before.
---
I'm sure you can go find someone else to figure that out for you.
---
I've never flown a Titan before but isn't this why some people fit the Clone Vat Bay module and activate it so you can't accidently jump only bridge?
---
They are not at 100m yet are they? I bought 10 at about 20-30m before everyone figured out the bonuses. My Asteros run them with a Blackglass.
---
LOL
---
Ugh more mobile games
---
I would advise against that, since you’d slow down/stop and burn straight at them, which would be bad for transversal reasons.
---
No more than you are.
---
there are stockpiles of titan hulls with more being produced constantly much like dreads I would say that there is no one that is worse than the other
---
does this mean an eve player has known the touch of a woman?
---
every bridge titan should just fit clone bay, you can't accidentally jump while its cycling ;)
---
I looked at it again, and well, I shit you not, his recent activity points him to a friend of goons.

This makes me smile. Long live the Imperium and the Crusades.

Rechecking evepraisal tells me that the Frostline ones are up to around 80mil.  
---
That said though, Blackglasses have dropped all the way down to 40mil, which is rather impressive.
---
Yep, had 3 Hecates ambush my active shield Ham Loki and it was more of an execution than a fight. I felt like I was ratting considering how fast they popped.
---
It’s good that other Goons feed their shitfit arty Loki’s to roamers, makes it more likely they will have a swing at my 5B isk pvp monster.
---
Translation: "Boo hoo why can't I get infinite moon money anymore? Goons ruined the game by playing it as CCP intended. CCP please nerf people who adapted to the changing meta so I can still be competitive."
---
There is your problem, sorry buddy but you are never going to get a response.  
---
CCP generally doesnt respond to tickets concerning bans unless there is a massive outcry on reddit or you are a popular streamer or something.
---
It seems like its possible with the Universe/get\_universe\_structures\_structure\_id Returns information on requested structure if you are on the ACL Otherwise, returns “Forbidden” for all inputs. It just needs as I universe read structures.v1

* After piloting away, I use keep at range on anchor until the situation requires adjustment
---
* Don't focus on reps unless there is nothing else to do, appoint the back LC to call out for overheats and splits

Offline your guns, then put them back online before briging. You won't have the cap to accidentally jump
---
So lets go through this in the most objective way possible, using an advanced technique called the scientific method.
---
Player A and Player B are both equal, the variable we want to test is real life money helping you win/giving an advantage.
---
Player A buys plex and injects skills to get 5% more damage and buys better mods to get 10% more damage.
---
Player B has the base t2 mods and standard level 4 skills.
---
In a million fights, player A will have a distinct advantage, therefore paying more will make you win more.
---
watching this while into hour 6 of grinding undefended structures in shithole nc space really makes me ask WHY THE FUCK AM I GIVING THESE PEOPLE MONEY???
---
r/iamverysmart
---
holy fuck thank goodness that megathron isn't on that list. I'm still sitting on 4 of them letting them appreciate and was gonna be very sad if they re-released it
---
You ever get the feeling that CCP is really just a shit developer and EVE Online was a lucky fluke?
---
As though the Jestertrek AMA didn't make us all ask that anyways.
---
Seriously, when a developer starts thinking of the audience serving the developer and not the developer serving the audience, that's when you should start pulling out.
---
Hey. I let my omega account expire into alpha stage, for 200 days while I was busy. I then logged in, and my skill queue was all still there (but not training). I then moved one skill, and the whole fucking thing was wiped. No warning, no anything, just gone.
---
Is there a way to get it back? I remember putting lots of effort into that skill queue, and without it I'm probably just going to keep winning eve since the friction of getting back is great enough to make me throw my hands in the air and say "fuck it", since I was only a few months in.
---
Opened support ticket, response said GMs don't have the ability to get the whole skill queue... but often times they don't know the workarounds that players know... hoping someone knows!
---
&gt; Conversely, the person you replied to, who is whining about the 'power of these groups', also hides in an invincible nullsec station.
---
If the groups are OP level powerful, then it only makes sense for their small group enemies to operate in NPC stations, doesn't it? But fuck those stations for disrupting otherwise 99% safe krabbing, making it 97% safe, right?
---
&gt; 'Mega Empires' are the last bastion for the average player not wanting to hide in highsec/lowsec invincible stations.
---
Average players were operating in null before Goons went from 10k to 35k. They were losing a higher portion of their farm than the current 3%, but that's already what nullsec should look like. They moved under "mega empires" not because other space was unhabitable and unprofitable, but because of the sheer risk difference between the options. Ofc, they chose the safer but broken option.
---
Check that you have Amd Radeon Software installed, from there select the 535 as your primary adapter, then once in Eve open the esc menu and select the 535 over the Vega whatever that’s in your cpu.
---
Remove this
---
Pretty sure the scourge javelin HAMs against a hecate didn't help either
---
I used to fly with them back when they were in YF. This amount of smoothbrain is honestly not surprising.
---
Wait isn't that illegal!?!

Any updates? :)

Doing God's work.

Remove tethering on structures, you shouldn't be able to just sit safely on grid, there's not enough risk.
---
&gt; Nidia ... Gobbins' right hand man
---
lol nice try Nidia
---
I mean, half of the stuff CCRee introduces they will not let you turn off, so "knowing there should be one" is kind of a stretch.
---
I’ll just post the video to save the trouble of trying to explain what happened. Needless to say I completely forgot that Ololosha is a bad ass and is good at the ammo switching to mess with reactive armor hardeners (I’ve fought him a few times before). 
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/AdventurousHorribleScorpionSeemsGood
---
It was a fun, eye opening fight! I proceeded to fight him 4 more times and lost a Phantasm, Orthrus, and Vagabond (though the Vagabond was a stalemate - we both died). The Orthrus I lost because I’m a baddie, stopped paying attention after the loot/gate popped, and didn’t have my shield booster to auto repeat.
---
For beginner anchors, I usually give the advice of flying in a circle above or below the dps anchor in a [cone shape](https://i.imgur.com/fhAw53i.png). When you get more experienced, your goal is to move this cone to the opposite side of the enemy dps... this maximises your transversal velocity.
---
The numbers you give, are literally above what any c2 &gt; NS can have like that's not too high but on a corp level that's more among the impossible level ( keep in mind c2 &gt; NS groups can already not escalate to capitals ). 
---
let's do some math for a c2 null that's a 12.500.000 KG limit per ship assuming you all want to get back and it's a fresh hole ( I'm ignoring the 10% here ). so that's shield cruisers at best. 
---
for a C2 &gt; NS on a fresh hole and that ignores then 10% of mass you can't really use. 
---
Telling NS static groups to adapt to an 80 people barrier well isn't gonna happen and I suspect you're lowballing the barrier tbh.
---
I saved my pod due to Olo being an awesome man of his word, he said if I give him 250m he’ll let my 2b pod escape!
---
And Torv was sitting there like a clueless idiot having no clue what was happening until it was too late :P
---
No change to mining vessels has ever been needed, it's the anoms. 
---
Reduce spawn rate to the same refresh rate as asteroid belts. Force miners that mine excessively to spread out, increasing their danger.

The Mittani is the most powerful person in the game and he never even logs in
---
Weekly reminder people shouldn't be living in wormholes, but are allowed to because the rage posting would crash servers for days.
---
Titans, supers, dreads and carriers wouldn't be that scary if they couldn't cross the in game universe in 30 minutes.
---
I dont like it and I disagree.
---
Well considering that one side stopped jumping their titans in less than half way through the battle, and the otherside kept jumping them in all night, that's not really surprising.
---
If Goon and Friends really had double the titans of N3/PL the whole war then the war would have lasted like 2 weeks instead of 5 months.  We literally had titan fleets tackled by 1,000 Goon/rus subcaps every day for a month and they never once thought to drop until BR-5 because situations matter bro
---
I am lowballing the barrier and I'm not telling you to adapt I'm telling you it's a dumb meta and I don't like it.
---
I don't think a titan's the ship for you if you're fuzzing over 300 PLEX.
---
Tldw?
---
You've got to get rid of the Rorqual mineral printing at it's current volume per account. The sheer volume of mineral production capable has made building a Titan take 1/4th the time of previous exhumed maximum production speed.  
---
I think the largest concern with nerfing Rorqual output is the isk/hour argument for time investment.  You can separately address the isk/hour at maximum production volume to encourage industrialists to mine instead of rat by reintroducing NPC buy orders for minerals at a stable market floor to make sure that people can make a safe choice between either NPC ratting or mining for isk generation, and more steadily control the value of production and ship cost.
---
No it's not
---
The point is, Goons were still the dominant force in 2013 and not NCPL if you look at titans/supers.    PL had the reputation because they had a lot of excellent hunters, so every report you'd see a blob of supers/titan on a bait op or something like that.  B-R they lost over 50 titans in the end.
---
TEST needs to stop this "the world is against us" mentality to be honest - every post from ever TEST member seems to be "NCPL bad, they picked on us, wahhhhhh".  The fact is, even back in 2013, NCPL wasn't the biggest titan blob, they were even or less than Goons and friends.
---
As far as the war in the north, we're just acting like goons.  Have fun knocking down the sand castle while we play other games.   Eve 2019, the only winning move is not to play :)
---
Shield Stratios can eat VNIs quickly if it decloaks on top of them, but it's not quite as quick, no.
---
And when did FRT come to TQ. (hint, shortly after CCP said they were cutting Tiancity without stating they had a concrete backup behind it)
---
I ain't that smart, but I guess in comparison to yourself I deserve that call out.
---
You cannot balance around hurting goons, because no matter what you think it will do to us, it will do to you as well. That's not effective. Instead of creating entirely new rules and systems and mechanics, just get rid of the singular driving issue, rorqual mineral production, and balance around more easily destructible mining barges.
---
&gt;hour 6 of grinding undefended structures in shithole nc space
---
You could be having more fun in Eve right now. Cast off your shackles! Awox a rorqual today!
---
Yes, I hear comparing things to double range bonused hulls is fine.
---
Game is fucked
---
I've not experienced NER to be panfam aligned or hyper partisan. I think you're confusing them with matterall/TiS...
---
&gt; Average players were operating in way null before Goons went from 10k to 35k. They were losing a higher portion of their farm than the current 3%, but that's already what nullsec should look like.
---
What the fuck language is this?
---
Are you saying "While goons were loosing 3% of their farm they went from 10k to 35k"?  
---
Or are you saying "Average players were operating in null sec way before Goons became a mega empire"?
---
Both of those agree with my point and earlier post about power creep and reasons.  
---
Then you come and fail to character attack me again with a strawman argument.  I played eve true solo for longer than you have even played EvE.
---
Step 4b: Lose the said titan

The only thing that would be different is that panfam would still have the biggest super fleet.

N+1 titans is the end game of the arms race panfam had a major part in starting.
---
Your right "Elite PVP" is not an insult. But it was used to beat alot of the old player base to death and we were told to adapt or GTFO. I'm sorry the shoes on the other foot now. I do not disagree with alot of the problems pointed out on these very pages. I probably would agree with most reasonable solutions as well. I just get tired of hearing Grr Goons all the time. I live and function in NPC null and deal with both small gang and Cap drops and don't whine about it. So again how about maybe the "Elite PVP" groups adapt or GTFO. Sorry I have no sympathy for them anymore than they had for us back in the day that they Heli Capped any and everyone because they could and basically told us to piss off.
---
He’s imperium not horde. You need to work better on defining your target audience 😂
---
The game is in a poor state and the future is bleak

Are there no Dentists in Iceland? Surely the CEO of CCP games can afford to fix that mess.

With the Hawk I just sling Scourge as it gets a bonus, and it feels like that outweighs any holes you'll end up hitting.
---
Fleet T3 should be possible but if you get triple BS in a row you might have a bad time. Tempting fate. :)
---
We could also give them powerful anti-capacitor weapons, as large ships are especially vulnerable to 0-cap situations.
---
Hecates are fun to fly, my biggest problem with them is getting bored and taking fights I know I'll probably lose b/c its better than doing nothing, and then dying predictably
---
Try jumping a titan instead of bridging with it.
---
Stop right there, criminal scum!
---
Should whales have a larger say on the game? Or should it be per player?
---
That's the moral question that you would disagree with Fuzzmeister on.
---
this is really sad dude. no one is impressed with your google doc posting.
---
There is literally one typo in my previous post, and nothing you cant infer from context.
---
Average players were playing the null game profitably before you began recruiting everyone. Currently they are losing 3 percent of their farm to hunters. Previously this was a higher ratio, but not so high to prevent them from farming profitably.
---
We still had roaming supers, wormhole ragerollers and most other hunting methods before so no a few triglavian fleet comps didn't change much.
---
I didn't make a personal attack anywhere. Just pointed out how the official goon narrative on selectivity and eliteness would change overnight if some game mechanic balances happened.
---
Idk why you are mentioning your years in an attempt to claim expertise over me, particularly when you have nothing to show for these years compared to many of my well known activities.
---
Actually, if anything "awox a Rorqual" is even more of a good suggestion for an Imperium member...
---
What, don't you guys have smartphones?
---
No, no, imperium has a lot of heavily awoxable rorquals.

---
NO not NPC Delve but that's not the point I am making. I find it interesting that Certain people who claim to have no bias and yet have an Obvious one Don't get called on it. I agree that the issues of Caps being over populated and the end all of what to drop is a problem. I even agree that Rorqs and Skill injectors are a problem as well. But that's not a Goon issue that's a game mechanics issue just like when I played from 04 -10 and one group Heli Capping every one because they could was a problem. There answer then was adapt or GTFO and personally now that they have the other shoe dropped on them I find it funny to watch them whine instead of taking their own advice.
---
I thought that was a banana slug...
---
How did Lesharks lose to Apoc Navys? WTB AAR!

Ever hear the saying "Adapt or die."?   Goons adapted ...  I think everyone can take an educated guess what PL/NC is doing.
---
Full mining láser avatar. Next lvl spodbrain.
---
I am not advocating for any group past or current.
---
All I am saying is that a meaningful MMO should be grounded on a healthy skill*risk*grind = reward equation. A situation where hundreds of low skill players are stacked in a 0 risk situation farming trillions each month isn't defensible in the framework of any MMO worth to play. That just leaves grind in the equation.
---
When you're looking at a station's info on Dotlan.. Refinery (30%), Repair, Factory... Does Refinery (30%) mean what is taxed, or what is refined?
---
Like I said in my Post, I'd cimbine that with a Imitation of producton runs. 
---
As for right now Time is basically no longer afactor when it comes to building capitals (and other stuff aswell). Therefore, with the amount of isk everyone has, it does not hurt to lose them. (Already replaced!!!)
---
And one would need to reward smaller groups over big blocks. 
---
Like how about limit Space and citadels an alliance can hold and make using Space that is Controller by other alliances worse to farm in.
---
That would Force alliaces to split up Info smaller factions (yea blue standing etc). And those are more likely to get to unfriendly terms than a Single big alliance.
---
Only wark against people who warp a fleet to a gate or anchor on one ship... how will the bombs help with a thousand ships spread around a 50 or so km radius or warping in small groups of a hundred or so at a time?

I bet they would look *divine* all painted up
---
That's a dumb point, and literally already debunked by the post you are literally replying to.  I know that N3/PL (i'm starting to think you weren't actually playing back then) dominated with Titans for most of that war, because I was there FCing a good portion of the fleets at the beginning and end of the war (Canaris took over Nulli fleets for a lot of the middle of it while I was on break).
---
I'd be surprised if it was even that high a percentage!
---
**Reddit circa 2014 (might have been 15) when PL and NCdot was murdering Brave and Provi with infinity spider tanking Carriers supported by supers and Titans:** The elephant in the room is that goons are minding their own business in Deklein which is an insurmountable fortress. CCP plz fix
---
**Reddit today:** The largest supercap fleet in the game is attacking the home of the second largest supercap fleet in the game. CCP plz help us. Goons are using their supers to ruin the game for regular players who just want to be left alone and do small gang subcap pvp.
---
Wonder why he didn’t use it

You need to be +5 to the pirate factions in order for them to rep you (blue). Between 2.5-5 for them to be neutral, they won't shoot but won't rep either (white). Anything below that is red.

Pirate faction standings don't really correlate with corporation standings. It just means you can run higher level missions for them. [See here for a great guide to pirate standings.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12JEPqPPKv3jLG-x-NczEl_WPApLyJGGNe5ER7s8o9mI/edit)

You can also approach points in space. Easiest if you just do it in a 2d plain but also possible for 3d maneuvers.

Before rorqual farming became a thing (before 201), if you had enough initial capital to work with then industry was the most reliable way to get mega rich. Margins on anything with a jump drive (supers/regular caps/jump freighters) was large with a relatively small amount of effort. Building titans was a cash cow even after bro pricing to friends. Not sure how it is nowadays since I haven't built stuff in years.
---
But the trick is to do something that won't bore you to death or grinding yourself into quitting the game.  I generally can't stand pve so I've had constantly changing "hustles" over the years, some of which are not doable now.
---
When does controller support happen?

I am Dino? NO!

He probably did, large shield boosters are garbage. With sent dps on top of your's he just dies.

---

---
CCP clearly have no idea how to fix the mess from injectors so they're just throwing new skill trees in to make money off people injecting into all 5s on day 1 of the patch. If the game lasts long enough I'd love to see how broken their idea of a Trig titan is
---
I thought you guys liked grinding.
---
This isn't even close to being new news.
---
And, *shrug*, might mean more people joining us!
---
We do what we can
---
The CCP that made EVE is NOT the CCP we have today, or even years ago.
---
Exploration is great for low SP players and it's not a constant camp type deal. Come and go as you please.
---
Are they wanting us to fight them in rattlesnakes?
---
So, with 1-2 hours per night, you can progress just fine. It won’t happen quickly, but Eve is a very long term game.
---
If you join a corp or alliance that does SRP for combat fleets though, you can do PvP at very little cost, even as a new player. And you can rat, do invasions, or do incursions even as an alpha and make a lot of ISK with just a couple of hours a day.

That said, if you’d like help in that regard, send me a message. My Corp (Lockheart Trading Company) is very new player friendly. We love getting people into the game.
---
That's the price of doing business with PanFam

---
The biggest mistake new players make is treat everything the same. I would say most new players consider mining veldspar in high-sec the way to go (until they make it), it's not their fault really, the starter player experience some way or another suggests it. 
---
Eve is a game where not equally spent time where result in equally or relatively equally outcome. In fact the differences are insanely huge, the difference between a hulk mining veldspar in high-sec or a hulk mining loparite (expensive moon ore) in null sec is staying alpha money or subbing your account for the entire month in one evening.
---
Some argue you should also maximize your fun per hour, but to have fun (in progress) eventually you would need to fund yourself properly no matter what you end up doing.
---
tl;dr whatever you end up doing, you should be maximizing your isk + fun output per hour, because any other scenario will leave you stuck or burnt out after a while.
---
As for your "guild" question, and that's my personal opinion, not many might agree, while it is imperative that you join a corp once you understand a bit how the game works, I wouldn't (myself) as a starter join a container corp, while they are genuinely helpful, you will be a blip in the sea of line members. 
---
Try to find a group that is small enough that is fun and social but not insignificant enough that you end up doing nothing or menial things, that is the challenge.
---
I thought they bought the "idea" or the game in development early on. Guess I read that wrong.
---
Why no nyx :(
---
This isn't that tricky.
---
Just put a few things back to how they were when Eve was better.
---
Restore off grid Boosts (Restore the ability for small gangs to compete)
---
Restore ECM (ECM has a counter - HTFU and use it)
---
Remove all Jump Fatigue (More people left EVE when this was introduced then any other fuckup I can recall)
---
No Titans or Supers in Low sec (Remove the problem of Snuff style gameplay)
---
Longer timer after firing doomsday. (1 hour - If you wanna show off your cock - its gonna take time to put it back away)
---
Basically reverse all the changes that people claimed were ruining eve that in the end turned out to keep it balanced.
---
If these ideas sound bad to you and you are a care/null bear - It is because CCP listened to you that Eve got into this mess in the 1st place.
---
When he said "Bring eve's signature gameplay elements to mobile" all I could think of was the "this is really eve" video.

You made a post on r/eve, you're playing the game more than most of us right now.     
---
Jokes aside, to progress in the beginning you'll have to put a bit of time and effort into finding your niche. The niche of PvP that you enjoy and stream of income that you can tolerate. Some can find it on their first day, others take years, and most people switch it up frequently. Once you find that niche you can login however much or little as you want and still enjoy the game to its fullest and feel like you're progressing.
---
Not focusing on repping seems to be an important thing that's gonna take some willpower to get myself to do. It's just so ingrained at me. It's too much to try and juggle the two most complex micromanaging tasks in the game at the same time.
---
is that something new i havent seen it pop up when i log in?
---
Is it windows 10 you're using?
---
I've been to E3 many times and have quite a lot of experience parsing these kinds of announcements. This is bad. Pearl Abyss gives the CEO of their latest major acquisition (Hilmar) a three minute canned video in which the only significant announcement is that they are working with NetEase on a mobile Eve game, which will go into beta this year (notice that the UI is in Chinese). 
---
As significant: the only already-announced aspects of Eve development that he highlights are graphical improvements and Korean localization. Absolutely nothing about gameplay. 
---
This last bit is subjective, but it's pretty simple: Hilmar simply does not seem enthusiastic in this video. I'm not going to call it the "hostage reading a forced statement" look, but he just looks like he's going through the motions.
---
This is extremely disturbing. The big picture is that CCP simply cannot or will not do anything to improve Eve's gameplay that will in any way reduce or endanger the microtransaction-based business model they are so obviously committed to. That means skill extractors/injectors will never be nerfed.
---
And that means Eve as most of us have come to love it is really in trouble this time. 
---
CCP does not really provide "roadmaps" for Eve's future development, so this is largely what we have to go on. We can only hope that the company will amplify or expand upon this and explain to us, the players, what they really plan to do.
---
In case this isn’t a joke. Never. This game would be impossible to play with a controller.
---
Starting to wonder if they have a hard time recuiting people long term to Iceland. Fun to visit, or live for a short while but long term. I don't know.

---
*slowly raises pitchfork*
---
Holy shit, you obviously were too long in panfam.
---
It's not about blueing, and content creation, it's about farming.
---
TEST regularly roams imperium space for content (well less now with the current wars). While panfam farmed every other entity. And with farming, I mean pushing those alliances so long and so hard that they either had to move or collapse... And panfam did that with basically every entity around that did not belong to the core of panfam: GOTG, provi, TEST, brave etc.
---
Now, TEST allies in important fights with the one entity that never betrayed us. Is that honestly surprising? We constantly content, the largest "peacetime" was for about 2 month, before we deployed somewhere else. So I don't know what you are speaking about when you say "blue donut", killing content etc. 
---
The main difference is, that we attack our enemies, which are often hard to win against. While panfam attacks the "easy" targets that are close, and more often then not, were allies a few weeks ago...
---
Well, the fuck, panfam attacked and backstabbed GOTG which was the alliance bleeding at the front in the last big war. And panfam did that attack at a time, when they KNEW that they had to gather all forces to come by the goon menace... Still panfam decided to attack one of their last allies. That is not content creating, that is "kicking your own".
---
HAW guns on titans are already pretty much useless on titans after the balance pass they just received and doomsday’s are fine the way they are since they come down to situation and player skill.
---
Difference is EVE in 2003 was a passion project, what CCP does now is just business.
---
He tackled something else and didn’t care too much: https://zkillboard.com/kill/77234849/
---
It's been broken for the last 10 years....unless it's CCPs desire that everyone should own a Titan and the very last word in any nullsec escapade is their use.
---
troll someone else
---
Bah, fuck that. Flyable, jumping keepstars. You know that someone at CCP has that as a card on a scrum board.
---
And I agree with you. The problem is that you frame everything off of current Goons and do not address that all groups do/did it to some degree or another. And yes I have a bias against PanFam and NC Dot because their doings on ages ago and I find it amusing that they are the ones who whine the most about the adapt or die currently when that's the expression they used when a lot of us older players complained about their doings then. I honestly would rather see Rorqs go back to boosting only with compression than what we have now. Maybe boost Exhumers both in tank and and mining ability to compensate some. Skill injectors need to be limited somehow. So you cannot instantly boost to what ever flavor of the month is. Make training choices meaningful. Either limit them to a set amount a month/year or make them not apply at all for certain skills ( Caps come to mind). I do not even remotely claim to have enough knowledge about the mechanics of the game anymore. I left the game in 10 because of RL and I just came back about a year ago to so many changes. I do know that living in NPC null is hugely different than sov null and having to deal with both small gangs and Caps almost routinely makes the way I play different than null blocks and low sec. It is a weird amalgamation of both styles honestly. One thing I know I disagree with you on is cloaky camping. There is no counter to it other than take the risk. There is no risk for the camper ever. The camper can choose his fights or not without any risk. If he doesn't want to fight he stays cloaked, if he does he blops in the fleet gets his kill usually and then cloaks back up. Those of us who are camped have the risk of undocking and getting popped. True we don't know if he's there or afk but we don't know that he's not either. That puts all the risk on those camped.
---
:pray:
---
big if true, I had the impression that goons only shoot structures that the group with the biggest rental empire for the past 10 years can replace basically overnight ;-)
---
yep let's all crab and blue up, heard that already worked great on serenity
---
i dont get how the title and the image macro are related
---
Goons could exceed that for years, they just chose not to field them and boat probably wasn't allowed.  Now everyone has a Titan. They are no longer the prized military asset because they are as common as a Domi  from 5 years ago. 10 could be lost a week and no one would probably care.
---
lol @ krab not knowing how to fit a shield super

I've got SDE downloading working, and am currently working on getting some market access classes working, so yes progress is being made! That being said, I've just started getting into abyssal sites, and joined a WH corp recently, so that's been a lot of my time lol

So basically OP being salty for  losing a freighter to some gate camp but killed one of the camper so trying to call out the camping being shit on reddit ?
---
I mean after 14+ years of playing some of us know every detail of the activities described in it having a popup is just annoying - the people who wrote the information knows less about the mechanics then we do.
---
Nice bananas. You might want to wash your thumb, though. Don’t let it get infected.
---
Injectors are the problem. They have always been the problem since they were introduced. At this point it literally does not matter how you work with any other single issue in the game. As long as you can turn ISK into raw SP, things will not change. The scaleability of all capital ships is simply too overwhelming for any competing meta with the amount of SP being injected.  
---
It doesn't matter if you introduce a new "titan killer" module. The most effective farmers in the game laugh while they inject 10x the numbers of any adversary instantly.  
---
It doesn't matter if you introduce "scarcity". The best farmers in the game simply form a fleet of miners with fleet support, jump on over and mine out the next door belts in a few minutes. That might have worked years ago before proliferation was at its current point, but CCP's inaction has ruled that completely irrelevant as a meaningful change.
---
It doesn't matter if you limit alliance size. It doesn't matter if you change the meta. It doesn't matter if you change timezone tanking. All of the points about how the game can be improved are simply irrelevant when compared to the flaming dumpster fire that skill injectors are.
---
Made my night lol best comment!
---
Because CCP hopes that thousands of erebus skinns will be sold like Nyx one - for people wanting to cash out in a while.
---
Well no, but he is actually correct.      
---
You are paying like 15$ for a cosmetic.
---
Unless you have it saved externally through a program such as EVEMon, it is gone. Also, though I can understand the frustration of losing a skill plan you spend time to figure out, if you weren't training twords something specific it can't be terribly hard to just throw some engineering or tank skills in your que. They are ones you will want to train eventually, and the order isn't terribly important in many cases.
---
Character trades are arguably part of the problem but someone still had to train those characters straight up, and what was trained was trained. SP farms existed but in a much more limited fashion since characters were grown for specific purposes and required a lot more up front investment. It was just a different animal.

Absolutely, when noone cares about stuff any more, something is really broke. I only speak for the people that I speak to in my Corp, but they don't care about this invasion at all. To much isk around, everything so easy to replace etc etc. This should have mattered, this should have been big news.. But essentially, goons are just doing boring structure bashes while we take the fights we can. Ultimately nothing will change and I don't see any great super cap fight taking place. This isn't what both sides of this war want for Eve, surely? CCP?
---
You know what else is abusive? Bots that warp away the moment someone shows up in local. Intel software that pings you whenever there is a neutral 5 jumps away.
---
Intel automation and cloaky camping are two sides of the same coin. Both are equally retarded, but you can't fix one without the other if you don't want to send the balance further down the shitter.
---
Fleets are already capped at 256.
---
Limit per system is dumb as fuck. One side gets in early and puts in 75% of the limit. You really believe the other side will fight that with the 25% left for them?

Good stuff, I'll keep this in mind next time I see my daughter on r/Gonewild.

The problem with asking "whats the best way to make ISK" is based on how you end finding the game most enjoyable. There's some folk who will happily have a ship sitting in an Ice or Asteroid belt mining away while they chat in game or are semi-afk. Others will find it most enjoyable flying around from system to system hunting npc encounters or taking on missions for various NPC corporations, or lurking in low/null sec to jump others at random. making lots of ISK in EVE is all about doing something over and over, so you'll need to find out what you enjoy the most first. To be fair, you can make a good amount of coin with high level missions, though you'll need to make sure to pick a corp that has something quite valuable you can trade loyalty points in for to make the most of it.
---
Let them think that, me and orin literally agreed i'd stop going to lowsec. I got peer pressured into making a pvp alt, because they weren't comfortable with my lowsec pvp. In the end i stopped going to lowsec because no matter what I did sharo screeched at me, it got annoying.
---
Tldr no that's not why, I still don't fully understand why.
---

---
Buying ammo for my civilian gun in my corvette
---
Imagine caring what your members do in lowsec.
---
Hey, Jamico here. I'd like to clarify a few things from my perspective.
---
1) The clearing of the corp hangars of TMB is something I'm gonna regret for a while. It was a pretty ridiculous thing to do with some stupid motivations, and it was a pretty petty thing to do. I should have left quietly, and I fully admit I was in the wrong. If TMB and/or Orin wants an apology, here it is. I will say, though, that a good part of why I did it was because Apex convinced me it was a good idea. He had this whole grand plan laid out about wanting to quit TMB alongside me and awox them on the way out. Whether this was something he said just to gain my trust or a legitimate thing he wanted to do, only he knows.
---
2) Yes, I handed Apex of Arcadia CEO roles and walked away from the corp I tried to make. The reasons are a little deeper than "IRL stuff", though. I'd wanted to make my own corp for a while, and figured I could do a decent job of it due to having spent some time in leadership roles in other corps before. What I found was that my IRL situation was nowhere near stable enough for me to be able to put in the time and effort into running it, and I began to fall back on my friends (or people who I thought were my friends, anyways) to help manage it. As for the "IRL stuff", I hit a low point in my life, didn't broadcast in time, and did something incredibly stupid. This realigned a lot of my priorities and EVE was no longer all that important to me. I decided to hand my corp over to Apex figuring that if he genuinely wanted to run the corp that he could do a decent job from what I had seen, and if he just wanted to steal everything (as I suspected he did) then he wouldn't take anything that really mattered to me. I know the "I didn't want that anyways" defence is thick on the ground, but sometimes things you thought were important just aren't anymore.
---
Caring about what your members do in LS is honestly pants-on-head retarded...
---
That was one of my problems with TMB and a part of why I left. I don't agree with the mentality of "the KB is all that matters" that some groups, TMB included, have. What matters isn't your losses, what matters is that you took the risks and gained experience.
---
TLDR:
---
The Mighty Beans are idiots. 
---
Apex of Arcadia is an idiot too.
---
was this drawn/painted or made with 3d modelling?
---
I think the killboard focus is really toxic tbh. Enjoy the game. Pressuring people to do anything isn’t cool. Orin and others are good people, I just think they tend to focus on the wrong stuff. I think it was crizwoo that drove a lot of the killboard stuff, as I’ve had rough reactions about pvp losses before. If you’re gonna learn pvp, you’re gonna lose ships, and that shouldn’t be a problem tbh.
---
Same explanation for how you whelped two gank nyxs to goons the other day then? :P
---
It’s ok as according to the Titan pilot he ‘just need to refit’
---
Right? Idk if i just totally got wooshed on right here but it seems pretty insignificant to be caring so much about your killboards like that. Honestly if someone is getting tama to be one of your top systems and consistently holds as your top killer then i think you should probably be getting more WH kills....
---

---
The other issue is of course that it devalues the effect of reputation when you can simply reset your character at will, now without even having to wait for a good offer on the forums.
---
From what I've heard that's a real issue for CCP. Even as neat as Reykjavik is, not many want to live there.
---
Yeah. The problem is that while Criz and Sharon got on peoples' cases about losses, leadership generally backed them up. So you can't really say this is a case of individual members being dicks, I think this was a leadership push to say, "we can't stain our KB whatsoever, if you suck at PvP just don't practice". This seems in line with other decisions from leadership such as the five-hour mandatory "impress our friends" ops.
---
I don't think leadership was malicious, though. I think they genuinely wanted what was best for TMB and its members and genuinely were motivated to try and get that. I just think they went about it in the wrong way.
---
BTW, hit me up in DMs. I know my name is mud in TMB, but FWIW I'm trying to get better at finding friends to fly with, which I honestly don't have many of.
---
Thanks for your input, it is good to see another opinion regarding this.
---
Lmao
---
I think I know why the dinos went extinct...
---
Basically correct. It just wasn’t a gatecamp but a lucky catch of someone who feels scouts/webs are overrated for moving freighters in lowsec.
---
To clarify: Apex was kicked ultimately because of the constant fighting in corp comms as a final straw. He was told that when he returned to the mighty beans he would have a negative stigma due to him leaving to help Jamico (knowing he had stolen things) before talking to anyone. Feeding in LS was a problem, but not kick-worthy, not participating or helping corp because of being in LS was also a problem, but again not kick-worthy. Poking fun at corp mates is normal, especially in our corp. We have an atmosphere a bullshittery and shenanigans. When that fun poking and prodding crosses the line to  fighting is when things have to stop.
---
Ah. Now I remember you.
---
The professional shit-stirrer.
---
Good work. A+

---
In all seriousness, if you did somehow manage to make Tama their top system, then obviously they are a dead Corp and you should move on. If you don’t, then you should take your leet PvP skills and spend time trying to help generate content in chain.
---
You’re both wrong. You’re both dumbasses.

Hi-sec combat missions are fairly reliable, but not great ISK.

Exploration can be great ISK for a new player, but it swings a lot and you may end up dead to players a lot. Some links related to it:
---
&gt; Exploration is a great way to start out in EVE as a new player. You go all over the place and you get introduced to a lot of useful mechanics doing so. It also earns a nice amount of ISK without risking much. Some links to get started:

&gt;ky ship, with a small mass, and a small sig.  It should also do high damage.  It would also be good if they had some kind of AoE damage, so they can fight a-symmetrically as well.
---
yes, exactly. except that stealthbombers are meant for anti-BS; not anti cap.
---
Anti-cap bomber would need to be scaled up to BCs/BS. And with triglavians, they could actually make some kind of capital hunter T2 BS
---
I do think everything is done with good intentions. There will always be mistakes etc.
---
Ah yes the protection fleet while you slowboat from highsec to null :)
---
Toxic behaviour definitely shouldn’t be tolerated. If he was doing this, it was understandable to kick him. The ls thing shouldn’t be a factor in that though, in my opinion.
---
I would actually like to hear more about this C2-3/Hs eviction, if only because it sounds like an amusing tale of incompetence.
---
This ^
---
They didn't. It was Rokhs Vs Leshak+ Apoc Navy's.
---
Snuff just decided some of their own members get to die too
---
It wasn't really an eviction, TBH. I handed over CEO to Apex after stuff came up IRL, he transferred all the structures, and I took that as an excuse to essentially dissolve the corp and go do my own thing, which I'd honestly wanted to do for a while. Anything that happened after that I have only a vague understanding of, obviously.
---
Not necessarily. I started playing in 2009 and can count on one hand the active PL members from before my time. The beauty of older players quitting the game is that without char trades or injection it would represent a significant "SP sink" and effectively remove supers from the game.
---
This would allow younger, more actively recruiting alliances, to build up strength over time as the older powers naturally decay. Much like how it was before the introduction of injectors. Remember how Goons started in Rifters and eventually trained into Megas? Pepperidge farm does. They would probably still have made it into supers today, but not with dual 30 day old chars and attrition would have culled numbers at the top of the pyramid.
---
Hi 2016
---
It totally was, I was triple boxing on my shitty laptor, living out of a mobile depot and we never actually killed the astra that was in there because we had no reason. It was really stupid as a whole lmao.
---
Not as CEO. But being hired as a dev, you move there and it doesn't work out. You have to move a 1,000 miles or KM away to get the next job. Not like you can drive across town or something. I'm a business owner. The people that I pay to relocate here I have to have a contract I'll pay to move them back after 90 days if it doesn't work because we don't really have anyone else in our industry even being a top 10 populated city in the US.
---
Imagine running off to /r/eve to cry about Beans.
---
Any outsider reading this: Know that this is largely an angsty, e-peen measuring contest between the 14-year-old Apex and the 16-year-old Sharo (no hate Sharo, luv u bb). They fought non-stop in corp chat and now it's spilling over to this subreddit. It's basically just high-school drama but in eve form.
---
TBH it sounds like you'd be best off developing some passive income sources and then doing what you find fun. Train Interplanetary Consolidation and Planetary Upgrades to IV (should take 7-8 days total) and get some PI up and running. Train research and BP copying skills up, find some decently-traded BPOs on market and start running off 10/20 T1 or T2 BPCs.
---
Exploration can be good isk for a low SP player. "Can be" depends on how much effort you put into it.
---
We're all a bunch of degenerates, and our mommies are proud of it!
---
Good to hear the other side, I hope RL issues are stabilising.
---
Sssssshhhhhhhh
---
yea being in a wh corp and spending time in lowsec bullshit instead of canvassing the chain is downright inconsiderate and you should have been kicked the first time you weren't able to respond to a ping because you were in ls. 
---
I see no issue with people keeping alts wherever they fki g please but if you re going to live in a wh, you better have to be ready to grab that content otherwise your corp kb stat padding in tama is just dead weight.
---
They are, generally. I have one EVE/IRL friend that helped me get through that point in my life and helped me see that there were people that actually cared. My boyfriend cut me out of his life, which was actually good because it made me see how toxic that relationship was. And I finally broadcasted and got some support.
---
I'm mostly on hiatus training some skills so I can get back into a corp with a friend.
---

---
Can you give me gila passive and active tank fit for T3 abyssal sites. I am Alpha clone.
---
Get ahead with what?
---
A "sticky situation" *wink*
---
That wasn't necessarily the point. It was more that the mass super cap and blue donut meta was because it was the only defense from PL and friends dropping their super fleet on anything with a pulse.
---
they used to have satellite offices in atlanta and london
---
"Good", relative to what?
---
Did he tell you his main source of income was "stealing from noob corps"?
---
Being a JF bro for a decent sized alliance is very easy money, and generally pretty low risk. Seeding the market for your corp/alliance at a modest markup is good for you and your allies. It’s not exactly fun, but the demand is high and the isk rolls in.
---
Sorry, you didn't get your answer. Them comms can get loud with everyone added their two cents. 
---
So "best way to make isk us; because I want to save for omega?", lets have a look at your options as an alpha/ new omega.
---
Moon mining, super social includes some pvp great return on your investment when buying a ship. You got the tail end of that fleet, we had almost a hundred people in the fleet for a jackpot moon that was worth 50 mill an hour in a venture.
---
T3 Abyssal sites: less social no pvp, risks your ship and pod. Join the discord #abyssal-sites will hook you up with a free ship and some training this requires you to pay more attention then most krabbing.  Seen 66mill a hour bounced around but this is all rng, one hour you could make 500mill then the next could be 5 mill.
---
Ratting, 60 mill an hour. Honestly fuck this boring as shit but some people enjoy it.
---
You will then use some type of industry or trade to increase your reward from your krabing. Doing mining, grab to blueprints for super common items you can make and sell in our staging. Doing ratting do some trading with the loot instead of just selling to a buyback.
---
In my opinion, moon mining is the most stable and risk-free way of saving for omega but if you recognize my name you will know I am biased. I do urge you to try as many forms of krabing and make up your own mind.
---
Hope to see you in my fleet in the next few days and may be I can get you on the next 3 bill [proteus](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77240323/) kill us, miners get.

You could do Faction Warfare so that you can get isk and PvP content at the same time. I would imagine that its a lot more fun than mining or exploration.
---
To be fair, it's not like this content is any lower-quality than most of the rest of r/Eve. This subreddit is mostly e-peen measuring, dicks as far as the eye can see.
---
I full heartedly admit to arguing, but not in a toxic manner, and I think we can all agree that Sharo didn't just argue with me it was everyone. Doesn't it seem a little odd to blame the person arguing with Sharo, and not seeing the fact that he argues with literally everyone in the corp?

He is saddly alpha but this is just what you need once you get that first month of omega.

*thinks in siege module*
---
Good to hear, sometimes we gotta pause the game for a wee while, but it’ll still be here when you’re ready.
---
Aight lemme clarify, I didn't live in lowsec. I took daytrips, and i realised "hey, there will be times where if i keep this up i'm not gonna be able to get to the content". That's when i started just going out when there was an entrance near where i was roaming, or if it's 6 am and no one's on. The only time i went out was out of boredom for the most part.
---
Can you share some so I can whelp more?
---
dunno man. how many ccp e3 presentations have you watched?
---
hilmar has always been a detached robot, that's not new or different. he's also not been enthusiastic about eve for about 10-12 years. he thinks he's done with eve and wants to create the next successful project
---
the back story here is that ccp produced a board game ("danger game"), that made enough money to finance the initial development of eve, and hilmar's been ready for 10 years to springboard to the next successful project, but none of the ones they've tried have stuck
---
he's not here for the long haul, he wants to hop from project to project, grow them, and profit from them while building the next ones
---
and as ccp isn't publicly traded, they really only answer to pearl abyss, who would probably prefer they focus on eve and monetize it more than they have already
---
so yeah it's a bit upsetting but not because of hilmar or any new information the presentation provided, but just because it reaffirmed what we already should have known: the acquisition by PA brings ill tidings for the long term health of the game
---
I hope so, CCP's been making some...interesting decisions lately.
---
390? Aren't cap skins twice as expensive usually?
---
We killed that beacon last week.
---
3D-printing gets an automatic upvote :D
---
Catch enemy super fleet, cyno in own supers at safe, rape enemy supers, go have coffee.
---
As if that could stop a Gallente.
---
I was hoping you were trolling
---
We definitely didn't start that trend, though we did arguably abuse it. The difference was still that our numbers were always limited by the players we had that could have trained into those ships. People tend to vastly overstate what we were actually capable of doing when it was usually less than 100 real people in fleet.
---
Exploration is the sweet spot between making decent ISK and learning a lot about the game in the process.
---
one way to remove alot of supers and titans in this game, make peiople able to use them at all ranges, then other groups can too. imagine the death
---
I honestly miss the old version with the map that came between this and the previous agent finder. Thought it was cool to visualize where all the agents and activities were. Made the universe feel more real and dimensional. But I guess this is easier to use.
---
And not the other color so police think  
---
They have the authority to kill a minority
---
A Bumping group, two Gank Talos, and a 'Was-fit-with-the-following' Salvage-Raven.
---
I've been twice for fanfest.
---
The second year, after the event itself I didn't really feel like there was much left to do there that I hadn't done last year.
---
It's a beautiful place but not somewhere that has enough going on to keep you entertained for more than a week or two.
---
On the bright side they have a good gym there that would probably keep me sane if I ended up having to live there
---
Why would a friend of goons build a titan in ncpl space instead of in delve?
---
That doesn't surprise me, but I always expected the answer to be mom's credit card.
---
Nice story, at least you have learned few things :)
---
Because it was already on sale months ago, and looks mediocre compared to some of the existing options.
---
Ok, but why is my Ninazu a police officer instead of the Red Cross skin that the subcapital logi get, CCPlz
---
Several people learned several things, I'd wager.
---
When in lowsec, its not a gank, its pvp. Lowsec is a major small gang pvp area. It is not really a good place to rat. When checking routes you are not seeing kills in these systems because no one has been caught there yet. If you are looking for a way to earn money while you learn the game more and want to go into lowsec I would suggest joining FacWar there are some groups that will teach a new guy. In Eve no where is truly safe. Welcome to the game.
---
Who needs speed? Make a bookmark while you warp in, i never ever burn to the different cans these days
---
I think you're painting yourself in a positive light there. I went on countless bean fleets and I didn't see you in them a single time. Can you even fly the bean doctrine ships?
---
Ive killed explorers in a t2 explorer with literally one rack of rockets because the heron was defenseless. Always put some guns and such on it!

How many hours does it take?

I really can't bear to watch that ugly mug any more.

I'm not sure of what happened, can some explain me like i'm five please ?
---
Huh, that's an interesting turn of events.
---
But not right now, as they will probably give him a pat on the back for killing someone not deployed.
---
This entire thread is spine breakingly cringe
---
Honestly you can’t blame CCP for what we do. It’s the players that choose to form up in these massive gigantic blobs and crab. Imagine Eve if people were more risk averse and didn’t join the blob.
---
TBH I've never understood why the Goons of all people would bitch about not everyone being deployed. Their coalition, coalition affiliates, allied coalitions, and allied coalition affiliates make up \~50% of the playerbase. Surely they don't need *every* pilot in the war.
---
That TL;DR tho.
---
Now thats a nice plot twist. Well done OP.
---
&gt;  my IRL situation was nowhere near stable enough for me to be able to put in the time and effort into running it, and I began to fall back on my friends (or people who I thought were my friends, anyways) to help manage it.
---
effective leaders delegate. you shouldn't feel like you failed here. a lot of corps stand up and fall down because their leaders don't have the attention span and they don't find anyone they can trust to keep the wheels turning while they're afk
---
This story is so trash it hurts. You’re all idiots
---
that depends on how it's fit. even poor fit super is 15b or so, so 20 if you include clones are reasonable.
---
This. Horde JFs make a fucking killing.
---
Ahh but when you let people skip out then you get more and more asking themselves 'why the Hell should I be doing this when they get a free pass to make isk' 
---
It also lets everyone else see how big goons can be when the war horn is blown, so others don't goto war with them.
---
Thanks!! Look forward to that vid.
---
T3 Cruisers or very well fit HACs can do it.
---
Making use of T2 resists is the key. A loki is King of Sansha but the Tengu is slightly better at Guristas and Serp.
---
Don't remind me.  I still feel slutty for the Lavacore Revelation SKIN that I broke down and bought a couple of weeks ago...
---
mistakes is what made eve great, now everything is so perfect and 'its been done' 
---
thank god for skill injectors putting newbes into titans i guess
---
Log-in yo the game and ask Jita local chat.
---
I don't feel like I failed. I no longer cared about the corp, or about EVE in general, really, and figured I'd just wash my hands of the whole thing.
---
question is, do supers and titans NEED the tank and warp core stability they have?
---
the heavy fighter, 2 supports or DD's and bridging surely is enough. make them have MUCH less tank, would probably sort the game out.
---
Nobody's going to go to war with Goons anyways.
---
CCP working a mobile game ? This surely wasn't announced since a year.
---
Hold Q and double click mouse. Where ever your cursor is is where you move to.
---
To choose a point in 3D space- place cursor. Hold Q, click mouse, move cursor to select height. Click again.
---
Remember to select a new destination before you get there or the fleet grinds to a halt.
---
you field bombers vs 1000titans  see how that goes for ya
---
Look up "Broadcast For Reps" or "Broadcast4Reps". They have a Discord that you can talk in. They'll give you some useful info. They're literal lifesavers, they've helped me out of a bad spot personally.
---
Make them explode when fired and we are almost there
---
the hams are the highest dps format you can slap on a loki. autocannons are just that bad.
---
this fit is horrendous though.
---
As long as you are having fun, it doesn't matter what you are doing. You dont have to fly big shiny ships to have fun. Grinding for isk to fly big shiny ships is boring as fuck.
---
Buy plex with cash from CCP, sell plex for isk in Jita. Buy loads of cheap ships fitted for PvP and go blow shit up in lowsec. Enjoy PvP shakes.
---
Youtube channel 'Eve is easy' is Suitonias channel and a great place to start with cheap pvp.
---
I subbed only to vote for you, make blops great again, thanks!
---
or do
---
some activities are there where you can log in and get into the action right away, would fit you, other require lot of preparation so it might be annoying.
---
That's just bs...if farming SP is currently a net loss (and it is), then what you are doing with that is speculating on the rise of SP value in the future. Even at that point, it's cheaper per SP to just buy Skill Injectors or PLEX now and hord them, rather then "plexing 100 accounts for a year" and going through the hustle of extracting from all of them...
---
So you're basically saying that we shouldn't create content and do everything by the Emporium Playbook?
---
Yes, we're on the back-foot and can't do things like we used to. That's fine, we'll find some other way to be a pain in the ass for the rest of the server. :-)
---
Here, have an upvote, on me.
---
Yeahhh what a good idea. If you want a fight go find it / work for it. When you blob, you blob if you get blueballed then you should eat them and think why what you're doing is retarded if you seek for fights.
---
Imperium have been the blueballs Queen for years now. Then don't cry not having fights that's it.
---
"But FC we've only 3-5 times their numbers and they don't want to undock a fleet and warp at 0 on us while being heavily outnumbered and under supercap umbrella. I don't understand !"

Like holy molly ! Content is not comming by itself ... strange life in eve right ?! #spodbrain2019

I read the whole thing in his voice tbh

I dont particularly like nidia but I will defend him from your incorrect and libellous comments.

Next time can you preface with the universally accepted "wormholer(s) BTW".
---
lol you're such a trolling waste of time
---
What about anti capital golden ammunition. Surely that would solve this problem.
---
Why thank you
---
I tell you, the answer will be: **MORE** alts in **MORE** caps :D
---
Northern Salt is strong in this one
---
You just need nore HAW guns shooting the target. If you needed 30 titans previously, you now need 60 to break tje same target.
---
It's not like they tampered with their tracking...
---
is the issue skill injectors? or skill extractors? and the fact skill farmers (basicly BOT's in my eyes) are seeding the market so much that there is the skills to go around.
---
i really think everything in the game is fine, except the tank on supers and titans, why does a titan need 10x dread HP at this stage in the game, and dont give me it costs X amount, fuck man titans are so easy to get, remove the guns from a titan completly, or reduce thier tanks so subs can actually make a difference. like vs dread bombs.
---
titans value is still thier thanks to no siege but still dread DPS, DD's, bridging, and carry amount
---
wow that seemed hard
---
Lol lowsec is already dead enough without it being ship limited.
---
\#metoo
---
You are not wrong. But reducing the viability of condensing 50k people in one region would pretty much gobin that direction.       
---
I'd like to see smaller, more spaced out rocks in anoms. So rorquals have to move every 3 or 4 indu core cycles, while barges can munch away in a (almost) 50k radius.
---
I get the feeling that this video would be better if it was something actually exciting instead of a fat useless crab.
---
It might be time to let what is dead finally die.
---
wtf that is a golden post
---
Think this is something deep down we all knew was going to happen, but hoped would not. They will milk us for all the $$ they can get, we cannot expecting much in return. We are like the sporting goods store from Sopranos, where in the end we get shut down, sold off in pieces and filed for bankruptcy - while the owners took all the money and run.
---
This definietly isnt convoluted, complicated and boring
---
Someone else here pointed out, that you'd only have limited production capabilities in POS vs. sotiyos now.
---
People can also built an unlimited amount of titans simultaneously in sotiyos.       
---
That might have been the bottle neck hadn't we gotten injectors and sotiyos at roughly the same time.       
---
But we did, the damage is done.
---
ik nit spreeken dat

Have joined! Thanks!

 Fuck that shit, 'cause I ain't the one

What was the point of relying on massive battles breaking the game if CCP does not have the capacity to support them? Maybe it was worth focusing on subcapital ships and local conflicts?

What small alloances need to grow is called renting or vassalage.

Name an alliance that grew from being renters or someone's bitch into something people care about.

Its not worth a thing if they got it for free and it also paid for its cost.
---
No 500 plex 20$ now.

Hi,
---
This is my first Reddit post and the account was made to vent on this issue.
---
To be honest and to be short: 
---
I'm sending a big "F\*\*\* You" to the following:-
---
The whiners and crybabies that partly caused the nerf.
---
Those who implemented the nerf.
---
I agree with the OP, in particular paragraph 2, " these ships probably got nerfed to a point that we, small groups, won't be able to field any of these because the risk vs reward isn't relevant anymore. .....".
---
I find it more convenient to develop an alt in hi-sec., ice mining with a procurer. I have put my fully equipped ice/ore mining t2 Rorqual up for sale as a result of this nerf.
---
The problem won’t be solve with a new ship/gun as long as rorqs are in the game and people can buy a titan for 40b. Nowadays titans are just to easily to replace.
---
The solution would be a combination of removing rorqs and implement a titan killer ship.
---
Eve is really not a game "Player A versus player B"
---
Ok lets assume Player A won this time player B. 2 min after, Player A get fucked by Player C+D. Players C+D are very happy with the bling kill and the nice loot :D
---
15$ would be 500 plex not 350
---
Ah. Been awhile since I played eve.
---
what are the most profitable abyss weather types?
---
After reading a lot of stuff on this thread, the only clear thing I got out of it is that you had a serious RL issue that you are solving with the help of people that cares for you.
---
Glad to hear it! Keep it up!
---
P.S. The whole circle of people stealing from eachother and failing miserably in one way or another was also kind of amusing.
---
Try to get in contact with the leadership of panfam/imperium.
---
Goons
---
Cool stuff! How do you get the models of the ships straight from the game?
---
Whole reason for those "hatchery" pockets is to let people stand on their legs or die trying.
---
Honestly the idea is not too shit but it's design to fix an issue and not the other way around but :
---
- There are already way too many empty systems, so you would need to remove at least as many to not make NS crazy empty
---
- Sure it would be easy for small alliances/corps to get those pocket but what would they do except krab in them ? Only content that would be generated would be defense against roamers, but that's pretty meh. You don't get border frictions with other entities because, well, that's not really happening.
---
Basically why join this pocket and not a WH ?
---
No this is not a way that you can create any kind of alliance.       
---
Look where this assumption got us.
---
That just sounds like wormholes with extra steps
---
Only answer is: join null blob, your rorqual will be chewing again... It's the only thing we can do unfortunately
---
&gt; while into hour 6 of grinding undefended structures in shithole nc space
---
Why do you make it sound as you have no choice but participate to that grind? :thinking:
---
Lmao Goon shill my god its great.
---
Feel free to browse my post history..some of my best comments are all about shitting on goons and mittens.
---
Lol cuck.
---
They were only there for the last 4% or so this time, but we used them on a contested fight not too long ago. There was virtually no tidi on this one so we also made the second keepstar timer except for a few who were unlucky with align times.
---
That kind of sounds like wormholes with local and NS anoms...
---
Theres a tool for that. Triexporter.
---
Just google eve online 3d models

TBH, "what do you like?" isn't a bad starting place for figuring out how to make ISK. It's just a terrible end place. Thing is, if you don't answer "what do I like?" in at least the broad "PvP/PvE/Industry" terms, you'll never narrow it down.
---
I'm a bit like you, I like (or like the idea of) basically everything in Eve. But I don't necessarily like them all evenly - if forced to pick, I'd pick the mining/industrial/trade type stuff over the PvP content probably 19 days in 20, even if I'd rather be doing all of them.
---
Also, dependable is somewhat... unspecific. Mining in 0.9 hisec is dependable, but low profit/low risk. Other things can be high profit/high risk. TBH, that's probably a more important question than what do you like is what risk/reward balance can you accept. If you want safe and reliable, find somewhere safe to mine. It won't be fast, but it'll get you there pretty predictably. If you want crazy profits and will accept the risk, probably some of the higher level missions/exploration sites.
---
There are of course many ways, I just named the sov-null route.

Best way to do it is to have one toon mining away on one screen and then go play the game and enjoy yourself on another toon on the other screen.

20-90 new systems will not hurt any one.            
---
Funny fact people need space to "krab" ^(to make isk) and build a sense of small community within alliance ^(to have common objectives) ... in order for alliance to be truly created and people working together.            
---
What people will do there other than make isk?          
---
* fight roaming gangs           
---
* fight people trying to take their space         
---
* **GROW AND DEVELOP**               
---
* try to look for better grounds at some point as current pocket cannot feed the group any more            
---
But what if people will be just interested in krabbing there?             
---
* sooner or later someone interested in PVP will come and evict them                     
---
But what if people will don't want to go and contest space. They will just build a group that can hold this 3 system pocket, and can do like 50 man fleets with some caps.          
---
&gt;Well whole point of those are to get this kind of groups for every one content creation.                   
---
Why not WH?                      
---
Because WH is WH, you cannot call it home. It have multiple issues with local ^(anti newbie, or even most of new eden population), communication ^(again annoying to live in).           
---
What is most important ... a -0.3 system can currently feed a 20 people doing various tasks in a single TZ.         
---
Something that is not possible in a WH, unless it is a high end WH.

Our (TEST's) titan jumped to a cyno instead of bridging and wasn't fit properly so he got tackled and was unable to be saved from an enemy dread bomb. Although the fight was cleaned up by Legacy and the overall isk war was positive a titan was still lost in one of the funniest ways possible.
---
I think you need a history lesson, Mr. Know-it-all CSM Candidate, because your perspective on current realities is completely fucked.
---
Introducing Jump Fatigue and "Power Projection" changes.  This happened with Phoebe, and it essentially restricted capitals from jumping anywhere close to their original ranges, while restricting them on how many times they could jump, making them completely combat ineffective for controlling larger territories of space or intercepting enemy capital forces and interrupting fights.  Additionally, these changes applied to sub capitals, and it made taking jump bridges a punishing affair, which made a large number of pilots less than anxious to venture outside of their home to actually fight because otherwise they wouldn't be able to defend their own space because of jump fatigue.  This change by itself wholesale stopped capital hunting by NC./PL in an significant capacity.
---
Circa Oct-Dec 2014 Brave Newbies had an average of around 10,000 - 15,000 players under one massive cluster fuck of a corporation.  They were so large and they held so much sovereignty that Pandemic Legion and N3/Northern Coalition decided to casually farm the fucking piss out of them in Catch.  Why did NC./PL go after Brave Newbies?  Because the Phoebe changes had so dramatically dried up their original play style, they were bored out of their freaking minds and bleeding members faster than at any point in history due to the Phoebe changes.  NC./PL needed content for their members that was fun, but also had a low risk profile.
---
At this time, Brave Newbies had some very serious leadership issues.  They refused to partner with forces hostile against their aggressors and wanted to stay truly neutral. This caused several of the leaders inside Brave Newbies to split off from the organization after months of knuckle dragging fights against supers and titans, dragging the player-base loyal to these leaders with them to their new organizations.
---
Introducing Pandemic Horde and KarmaFleet, the current mega corporations that represent the primary player base behind both Goonswarm Federation and Panfam (NC./PL).  These giant corporations are literally the driving force behind all of the N+1 you see.  The other corporations that form up these large nullsec power blocs have a smaller number of active players today than they have had previously, and it shows.  GEWNS is a great example, as the core corporation of Goonswarm Federation, it barely puts even a single digit percentage of fleet composition on the field within Goonswarm Federation.
---
After these new player organizations grew and continued to grow to mega-bloc status in a short period of time after the relatively quick collapse of Brave Newbies, they were finally given something that allowed them some staying power, that being skill injectors to catch up in the meta of online spaceships.  When that happened, active new users exploded and the number of pilots capable of flying hard to fight doctrine ships and capitals equally exploded.  This sent elite bittervet organizations reeling on their heels because they couldn't rely on a skill point advantage or a combination of implants and heavy tank to take 5:1 odds fights (example here being Rooks and Kings), they couldnt project power with their capitals like they used to, and they couldnt hunt this new flock of capitals that continue to grow sight unseen within these new player organizations.
---
Introducing Entosis mechanics.  These mechanics simply broke nullsec on it's back after The Providence War started by Goonswarm Federation and The Casino War funded by the online casino moguls.  You now have ZERO ability to control large swathes of space through actually fighting aggressors in spaceships, and the only way to actually defend space is to tightly pack all your members in like sardines to maximize ADMs in each system and make sure your response time is as low as possible to counter frigates entosising your entire house for 18 hours a day.
---
Introducing Rorquals, with their excavators.  Now you have a way to print minerals at an alarming pace, taking the previous 1,200 hours of mining per titan with a single exhumer to 300 hours of mining per titan with a single rorqual.  You claim to have 80 something accounts that you multi-box with, so I'm sure you can understand how rapidly these Rorquals took industrial production completely into the field of "Haha, holy shit, this is broken."  
---
The only justification for the change to Rorquals that made them mining super forces was not because there was a need for a larger industrial vessel, it was literally an effort by CCP Fozzie and the PVP try-hards like yourself "The Whaler" to gank Rorquals.  You guys were so upset that a non-combat vessel was sitting in a POS boosting all day long and you couldn't kill it (almost like an AFK cloaky camper) that you pushed CCP to put these ships onto the grid and no one was willing to do it without a much better risk:reward scenario.  They got it, and it completely fucked over industry in the game.  All so you "whalers" could get some DANK PVP FRAGS on an otherwise completely defenseless industrial ship at the time.  The best part about all of this of course is, where were most of the Rorquals at the time before the change?  Oh right, they were in Goonswarm's space, in the North...
---
Introducing Citadels, with their time zone tanking and super capital docking.  Now you have successfully created a ceaseless industrial chain, everyone is densely packed into tight, low jump range space to preserve ADMs, increase entosis response time, combat jump fatigue interrupting travel and everyone is flying capitals that used to take years to get into on skill training alone.  How do you protect your new little nuggets of wealth? Well, you do what everyone does, and you drop ALL your titans and supers on it, over and over and over again until people give up trying to attack you.
---
The current state of the game is so fucked up not because of the player base, but because of mistakes made by CCP in their every single attempt to knock down Goonswarm Federation a peg and "make room for the little guy".  While there are some little guy organizations, that mindset died with Brave Newbies and B-R5RB.  The majority of new players that come to EVE want to be part of something big, they want to know the intrigue of these deeply advanced organizations and the wars they cause.  If you don't believe me, just ask yourself why KarmaFleet, Pandemic Horde and Brave Newbies continue to be the largest organizations?  They are in a bloc, they are new player friendly, and they let you participate in something huge.
---
Regarding CCP, every action they took after B-R5RB was designed to reduce the impact that large power blocs had on null sec.  Instead of allowing players to find a way to fight their battles and take on these organizations, they believed it was in the best interest of the game to introduce controls and measures to stop large organizations from dominating null sec.  In reality, the majority of their changes lost them a significant amount of their player base who enjoyed the rapid content that the older mechanics delivered.  Currently, EVE as a game is in a situation where the most boring of activities are essentially required in order to maintain and accumulate wealth in the game, as all manner of passive income generation out of PI (which you could argue is so low volume it requires active participation) has been removed.  With all of these changes, people stopped having to explore space and conquer outside their homes, because why would you even care to do that at all when you can stay home safe and sound and make all the money you can there in your little nugget, without jump fatigue, without travel time, with absolute safety and without anyone capable of projecting a capital force on top of you if you have sufficient buffer regions in place.
---
Now that we've taken a stroll down memory lane, from the series of horrible design decisions that took a 550k subscriber game down to somewhere in the 100-200k range, maybe you need to stop assuming that somehow Goonswarm Federation is horrible for what they've done and correctly address your attention to the fact that the developers took a lot of these actions to STOP Goonswarm and it just made them stronger and stronger.  If players want to band together, you cannot stop them.  If they want to create money regions and such, you cannot stop them.  There is no system you can create in EVE that is going to somehow break up something like Goonswarm while also not costing you the remainder of the player base because the restrictions would be so disabling to every small organization as well.
---
Good luck on your CSM run, but for the love of god learn something about what got us here and the motivations behind why changes were made and what the net outcome of those changes are.
---
It's also even funnier to note that the structure he was on wasn't even online yet so I think he panic warped there without knowing.
---
&gt; It sounds like wormhole without extra steps           
---
Fixed for you.
---
Even taking into account insurance and not counting looting, its still an over 50b differents. I would say thats a feed, not a giant feed though
---
Imagine getting a parking ticket for your rifter and the Police Erebus arrives to collect the fine...
---
Wormholes don't have static connections and can be always reachable.          
---
WH space have huge downsides when you compare them to K space.         
---
This space is to be highly available and reachable for new players, allow construction of supercapitals even if someone living in it decides that they are strong enough to protect this kind of structure.

"No dear, bees are bad. They could sting you and also they have hundreds of thousands of soulless turbonerds multiboxing rorquals 23/7 in their carebear shithole of delve while joining F1 pushing megablobs literally just to farm PAPs and yell dumb shit on comms while filling the GSM with their own damn mouthpieces"
---
Which ship is your fav?
---
papabless!
---
Needs more Poi
---
Yeah. XD It's like a comedy of errors.
---
I get it, its because goons are bees, good job there you Einstein
---
Everytime i hear "mobile market" these days i get in a bad mood... -.-
---
Nice man
---
&gt; \-No perma aligned super's/carrier isk machines. (when they used sentries and provoked fights when caught) 
---
Please remind me how a skynet super parked under a POS shield provoked fights back then.
---
Best answer right here, make the grind as little of a grind as possible by making it the activity you hate the LEAST to grind.
---
I haven't done any PVE in ages... but this looks exactly as mind numbing boring as I remember it. 
---
Is the new AI only used in new PVE content (burner/diamond/trig)? Is CCP keeping PVE "dump" because the need the 10+ accounts afk ratters money to survive? ...I seriously don't get it.
---
Watching PVE videos like this one in 2019... Well, if I'd be considering starting EVE, I'd quite likely never take another look at it ever again (and I'm not even a PVEer). 
---
(Sorry OP, don't mean to criticise your video. You made it as interesting as somehow possible)
---
what do u do with 90 acc?
---
Delve mostly 
---
Fite me
---
Do you hate money?
---
~ Synda ~
---
Alright, I don't get that attitude. I never liked grinding undefended structures or doing ops that aren't fun. So I just don't join those.
---
I still have lots of fun doing smaller fleets or joining fleets that have a high chance of a fight (the latter requires a bit of meta-knowledge and staying up do date).
---
If you don't like grinding undefended structures, why do you join those fleets? If your alliance requires "paps" don't you have a more fun way to get those?
---
im in their discord and i remember someone got banned from whelping more than once per day because he was fucking up the killboard so much, not sure if it was him
---
Cyno&gt;DD
---
You can only transfer so many things to an alt corp before they explode
---
Of which about 220 in a Titan.
---
Northing is broken here, everything is totally normal, nothing to see, just move on please.
---
[My side of the story ](https://youtu.be/EOcJR9vFqHw)

normally id agree, but if he's who im thinking of, he was responsible for like 60% of their losses lol. that's not great

A belt for the rorquals to mine in?
---
&gt; five-hour mandatory "impress our friends" ops.
---
do you mean "help our friends with important ops because they help us out with shit all the time"
---
This is most likely correct
---
I don't think either of those are focused on Eve development though. Not sure about London actually, but in the Atlanta office they mainly worked on that weird cancelled game I think.
---
Well, if you make regions of space that can only be reached through regional gates, for better or worse you know that gate is going to get camped like hell.
---
Thanks for the help
---
I was here!
---
Honestly if youre unsure you can make enough from explo to plex without too much difficulty, just dont plan on doing that many months inna row hecause you will surely burn out
---
Do it in a cloaked t1 explofrigate, and it is definitely worth the risk.
---
It will not be regions, but pockets.    
---
Imagine yourself lowsec constellation connected to a 1-3 systems of sov capturable space.    
---
You cannot go anywhere else after you go inside them, just turn back.          
---
Will those be camped - sure.     
---
But i guess whole point of eve is to create content for people.
---
3D Chess
---
Thanks for the reply. I’ll definitely be contacting you in game
---
Thanks dude!
---
Not really sure who is still in (or has come back to) the warzone, but Federation Uprising and Villore Accords used to be some of the big names in GalMil.
---
You can refer to the point I made up above.  The reason for having 35k-50k or whatever k the number is now, all shoved into Delve is because of a combination of Phoebe (jump fatigue), Entosis and Citadel availability.  People dont want to spread out anymore because Jump Fatigue is cancer. People dont want to spread out anymore because Entosis mechanics make it impossible to defend against some random nerd in a frigate versus a fighting force attacking your structures.  Currently Delve has been stockpiled with Citadels, so unless you change how many citadels can be deployed, theres no reason to go anywhere.
---
Honestly, if they want to restore the game to some of it's former glory, removing entosis and using a citadel for a singular sovereignty structure, removing jump fatigue and slightly increasing jump ranges (2-3 LY per ship), and getting rid of time zone tanking would do more than any other change.  It would allow an organization like Goonswarm to fan out again, and with increased jump ranges, become easier targets to go after.
---
More than anything it's the availability of unlimited ressources. It would be impossible to live that clumped up. Now it's just inconvenient to spread out.      
---
I'm not blaming anyone to play the game how the devs enable us to.       
---
But I desperately want the devs themselves to change something.
---
you actually made me laugh :D
---
you can play eve casually. but like many said in the thread you have to be able to play it in blocks of 1 - 2 hours. So if you can put a block in , in the weekends that is great. Just don't expect 20 mins Apex legends matches. Think more League of legends .  
---
Your character trains at the same speed offline and online so you don't lose any skillpoints compared to being active 24/7. So your progress on skill/ experience wise is the same.  
---
progress wealth wise depends completely on yourself.   
---
there are people that earn as much isk in an hour than others do in a week/ month
---
It will be very interesting what the other game developers come up with.
---
The current Auto Chess has an easy to learn hard to master concept that is pretty clean. I am not sure if the other game devopers can come up with mechanics that would be major improvements or if it will be just a reskin with the same mechanics, with other characters and looks.
---
EVE doesn't need an Autochess, we also do not need a Battle Royale, MOBA or trading card game.
---
What we need is more of EVE
---
Yeah, I think they can do something with mineral availability and restore it to how it use to be, where space usually had one of the A B C ores but not both. But even if they do that, an organization like goons will just move to where the best mineral composition is, even if it means straddling between two regions.
---
I’m going to do the same.. although I do hope to buy an Erebus one day
---
Thanks for the reply
---
Check out the "Invasions" Channel. Neugeniko listed all Triglavian Fleet Ops channels there plus some very useful info. I heard that "Public Invasions" had a armor rep fleet going. Have fun :)
---
When the Titan pilot wants to open a bridge (works like a temporary stargate) to the cyno for the subcaps around him, he right-clicks his own ship and clicks "Open bridge". Problem is, "Jump to cyno" is right next to "Open bridge", and so occasionally a titan will jump his own ship instead of bridging the subcaps.  
---
At that point, the titan is far away in hostile space, alone and with no backup. Fraternity dumps 90 dreadnoughts on top of him, and because he's a spodbrain, he forgot to fit his own cyno for friendlies to jump to.  
---
TEST sends in a tidal wave of caps and supercaps, doesn't manage to save titanbro, but do kill pretty much all the dreads.
---
very nice overlay and user experience, stil have grudges against that "Free Intel" Update that the number Signatures in a System are shown, what can be botted for Intel
---
It's not mine hands and it's actually the stuff that does the sanitizing. And quite hard to wash off if you spill it.
---
Damnit Sharo
---
You laugh but there are actually a few people doing this. No joke.
---
hey another stainguy idea that wont work
---
....like sov related PVP in NCPL
---
They are just regular bananas and the ship is 25 cm long oO May be you're just used to smaller bananas?
---
thanks to skill injectors
---
Thanks, but what "bridging" a cyno means? Was it a miss click ?
---

---
But as far i've understood, the best way isk/hr is to buy your omega time with $$$
---
Well, they can't, so I don't see your point.
---
Ah, such a one sided loss for Panfam so. I guess they weren't ~~good~~ goon enough.
---
This game is ill.
---
Villore Accords are good kissers.

---
Thanks for this perfect explanation!
---
these cryptic messages are so unecessarily cryptic its getting cringe
---
hilmar was an idiot who approve citadel expansion in 2016, thrid year we eating cactus.
---
If they didn't rmt all.the isk, NC should be able to rebuild
---
But it was not a pb when NC PL droppped super on everything some years ago.....
---
I'd really recommand against flying the Astero without a covops cloak. It's its main defense against bigger stuff when in dangerous space, and the hull is quite expansive *especially for an alpha* to not fit it correctly.
---
Nice shitpost Helo
---
this guy was jumping in his chair for sure
---
He actually couldn’t
---
You know that's how the Nazi party came to? iirc Instead of people focusing their votes they just spread out across candidates.
---
Removing titans and supers from the game (without the possibility to build them that is) would also be a decent start.
---
Anyone dedicated can get a titan within 12-18 months of slowtraining as well. Supers within 12. Or you can buy a toon from the character basaar. It's pretty straight forward to get supercapital pilots, even without injectors
---
Nice!
---
i liked it :( i was going to ask him who it was until i read this
---
Powercreep? Sure, remember though that they're shit at being alpha-fleet due to limited range and damage spool-up. Alpha fleets are the go-to concept in large fleets for how long now?
---
Police skins are only for gaylente ships?
---
Apex was the person who would pod out of the wormhole to pvp in lowsec, then cry because nobody wants to pause rage rolling to scan him an entrance. Tama was our top system once and that was at the beginning of the month when we dropped dreads on the Nourve gate.
---
You can't defend the north without undocking
---
just fit some civ guns to your high slots, youll hold the agro for your poor widdle drones i promise. afk isk farming fixed. cousin vni lives to see another day.
---
&gt;WH space have huge downsides
---
Half full vs. half empty, oversimplification.
---
&gt;  allow construction of supercapitals  
---
Thought you wanted to be small?
---
The only mobile game of CCP ill use, would be the one to check/update market orders...
---
Check the Delve killboard, pick a month- any month.  
---
Also this:  
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/73267902/
---
Dark if I'm not mistaken, as they give plasmids for tackle mods.
---
nb4 i had to leave horde cause i was allergic to bees
---
I recall running multiple practice ops as well as doing small gang roams out of the hole, but apex straight up refused to fly in fleets, so it’s kinda hard to cater to someone who doesn’t want to do 99% of the PvP your Corp does.
---
Oh yeah because their first dread totally wouldn't die in a fire the first time it was used currently.
---
Wormhole exploration in a cheap T1 frigate can net you plenty, and it's easier to do than getting to nullsec to do it, especially since alphas can't cloak
---
Nice?
---
Lies and propaganda! The true Conman died 6 months ago when he tried to lift the sun. That's merely a weather balloon.
---
No, I mean mandatory five-hour ops where the motivation *as stated by Orin Borider* is "to impress our friends".
---
Only 2 rorquals per anom IMO.
---
Nice...
---
Nice!?
---
It's also the best looking!
---
 Nobody has been kicked from the Mighty Beans for whelping stuff.
---
a Nestor in his hold would have saved him probably. At lest he would have refitted to a cyno.
---
You guys should have given him better justification for your being upset than "muh killboard", though. Complaining about "muh killboard" sounds tryhard-y. You always had plenty of legit criticisms, not joining fleets being one of them. Focusing so much on the killboard gave him justification to paint that as the *only* thing he was doing wrong.
---
Tldr please
---
I appreciate the attention to details : turning yellow and red according to their status !
---
Great work
---
Beat me to it.
---
In all fairness, though, if you're doing most of the PvP you're going to eat most of the losses. My experience was that Apex was responsible for most of the losses because nobody else in corp was nearly as willing to go out and roam for content.
---
We got on him for not coming on fleets all the time. I recall explaining to both you and him that we where a group and it’s sorta expected that when we are doing Corp ops you should be taking part not dying in lowsec
---
Part two is now posted. This won't be a daily thing, but I'll be making more.
---
It was tho
---
Missed a great analogy opportunity my dude. "this is so Rose colored you could replace a window at Notre Dame with it"
---
you can really feel his excitement talking about eve
---
Would especially be a good way to also remove a lot of players from the game.
---
You think ???
---
Oh damn sorry, just woke up.. missed the sarcasm
---
No
---
No, it's a subscription game with an unlimited time trial
---
np happen to the best of us
---
One step closer for SSO for all accounts. Not bad.
---
It's something I've been asking for, for a while now. 
---
I've seen people who don't want to use 2FA, because they have lots of accounts, and 2FA is just too much of a pain for that. And are complaining about it. So, this allows for better security than not using it, and reduces email reliance :)
---
I my self run without any stabs and instant warp with aligntime of 1,6 sec. but if u are new stabs are good until u know how not to get cought.
---
Villore accords (GMVA) and I Aim to Misbehave (GoG) are the two biggest alliances. GMVA is larger overall with a greater EU presence. GoG is smaller and occupies odd space. Note: I'm a GoG pilot.
---
Nice less clutter in my auth app \o/
---
Cans
---
No small alliances do not want to develop and grow that way, they want a safe space in which they can drop their infastructure with rigs and it wont die, they will join whichever coalition is closer or they have connections and they will do what every other alliance does, pve in safe space with intel channels spanning across regions and out of game infastructure that makes their game safer.
---
Station games on NPC stations, kinda cancerous.  Station games on SOV stations, particularly station systems, could be kind of amusing.
---
It is on the bottom.
---
What stops the big null secs just taking the pocket and controlling entry?
---
1. Well.. you can play for free up to a point. And at that point you can be useful in game, just dont expect to be big boss of fleet, mostly just logi. The f2p is like a demo for the subscrption.
---
2. 3-8 noobs in a fleet can be great if yall are coordinated and enjoy pirating
---
3. Idk, ask reddit
---
relative to the rest of the people on the csm obviously?!
---
No, make a DD that has an AOE range of - let's say - 500km. When fired it destroys the ship that fired it and deals - let's say - 1 000 000 000 (I could support increasing this amount) of omni-damage to everyone within range. You jump a thousand titans in a blob? All it takes is one shot and cancer is one step closer to being healed.
---
Outstanding!  Thanks for the channel and good wishes!
---
Fly safe!
---
Help organize the complete and total annihilation of an enemy territory to the point they risk being wiped from the histories of EVE.
---
And those small alliances will get picked on by a slightly larger one, so they ask the next group over for help, forming a coalition. And the smaller of the two groups does the same, and so on, and we are right back where we started.
---
It is not mechanics issue, it is a people issue. And the majority like to team up with friends. Proof? Most null sec players are in major alliances.
---
In terms of WH. 
---
Downsides of WH space :    
---
* You cannot do much if you are new player rats will eat you, same for cloacked ships          
---
* PVE content is limited in your WH, you need to move        
---
* Life is much more demanding - more alts, scouts probing, if you die you need to find your way back.               
---
* WH is not place to live if you have to many RL commitments       
---
In terms of supers:         
---
Lets be honest here. If a group want to contest any space outside this small pocket it need to have big toys.       
---
We don't have few titans or supers, we have thousands of them.       
---
Not giving ability to construct heavy stuff is actually a blocker for small group as its member will need to overpay for new supers and move it from delve instead of building them locally.          
---
The downside is that this space is easily accessible - so your structure can be abused, also by default, supercaps cannot enter or exit it in any other way than by using gate.
---
Very nice change.
---
Why not. They're flying titans? I don't want them in Eve.
---
This is the question - probably laundering ore?
---
all we ask is one account with many character slots and ability to log them all in
---
Before you go critiquing anybodies intelligence you should analyze your own postings first
---
1. Max 1 alpha character running per person. Running 2 alpha characters from 2 different PCs will work, but I think it's a breach of the EULA and probably a bannable offense.
---
2. About wormholes:
---
a. There are dozens of corporations that exist in that range and I simply don't know most of them. None of them have as much advertising and in-game power as Karmafleet and Brave. A lot of them also don't accept alpha characters, they tend to accept more experienced players because the fleets they run necessitate T2 or T3 cruisers/battlecruisers and Triglavian ships, none of which you can fly as an alpha and even with omega, they actually require a good amount of skillpoints to properly fly.
---
b. You can start daytripping in wormholes now pretty easily. That means living in hisec/lowsec/null and exploring the wormholes that randomly connect to you. Exploration is the best ISK/skill required activity you can do, just need to train all of the skills available in the Scanning section (takes about 3-4 days to get maximum skills in the ones available to alphas), get in a properly fitted Exploration T1 Frigate (Magnate, Heron, Imicus or Probe, choose the frigate skill that you have that is the best). Once you can properly fly Battlecruisers, you can also farm the low level combat anomalies (c1-c2) for also pretty decent isk. I think Brave or Karmafleet may also do a bit of daytripping in wormholes, you should look into that once you join the alliance.
---
To start living in a wormhole (or joining a corporation that lives in a wormhole), you kind of need to be an omega. There are corps that accept alphas, but they're usually smaller, newer corps. The big thing you're missing as an alpha is the cloak, you have bad scanning skills which makes scanning a bit of a pain, you can't fly a lot of the common wormhole ships since they're T2/T3 or based around the cloak. Since wormholes don't scale as well with more people (unlike other areas of space), most corporations are selective as to whom they include. Most doctrines focus on bringing a lot of firepower in expensive ships, something you can't always fly as an alpha.
---
There is one pretty big wormhole corporation that accepts most people: Signal Cartel. But this corporation focuses exclusively on exploration. They don't accept that you initiate aggression if you encounter someone in wormhole space. 
---
c. Wormholes have the most interesting combat in my opinion, but the most skill intensive requirements as well.
---
d. r/evejobs is one. [https://eve-corps.com](https://eve-corps.com/search) is a new website that has some corp ads. Omega is usually required for wormhole corps though and a high level of skillpoints is preferred (though not as much of a hard requirement as omega is).
---
e. Always bookmark the exit wormhole, otherwise you will have to scan your way out again. Learn to use the Directional Scanner and start spamming it. Properly used, it will tell you if anyone else is in system (that is not cloaked) and you can even figure out where someone is without them knowing you are there or that you are searching for them. Learn to use the bookmarking system to create safe spots in space (useful in all areas of space, but especially wormholes). These safe spots in space allow you to be sure that nobody is on grid with you. The only way someone can find you (if you are not cloaked) is to use combat probes, which you can detect with your dscan. If you see them, start warping to different safe spots (you have made more than 1, right?). As long as you keep moving, they will not be able to scan you down. Core Probes means someone is scanning the system too (watch out though, your own probes will also show on dscan), although they might be cloaked. The rest you will only learn with experience, knowing what ships you see on dscan can do to you, or what you can do to them.
---
3. Both are a good choice. Once you get more experience in the game (and maybe omega), don't hesitate to move on to other corporations or spaces in the game, even if you eventually return to Brave. Lowsec solo/small-gang pvp is pretty fun and has a low skill requirement (alphas can participate too), wormholes are great, but require omega/high skill requirement. Hisec is a very mixed bag of exploitative corps, non-violent non-wardeccable corps (think hauling/trading corporations) and wardeccing corps. Hisec was actually pretty good for a while because nullsec alliances started wardeccing each other to gain control of very profitable trade hubs around Jita, but this has since died down and they decided to cooperate instead of fighting each other.
---
can you link to a decent fit ?
---
You realise the game is in maintenance mode?
---
CCP does not have the courage to add anything fundamentally new to the game.
---
Prove me wrong CCP, prove me wrong.
---
As if they had any chance actually using them as it is now. :D
---
Send a message in game to soul vommit
---
Actually, not a single titan has died in Delve due to bombers. 
---
https://zkillboard.com/region/10000060/group/30/losses/
---
Yes!
---
Goons need a ratting and mining haven that cannot be dropped by bombers or dreads
---
He looks like they've held a gun to his head and made him read a script. There is litterally zero excitement from him there.
---
Fake Querious then, extended delve. Bee territory. I have heard several bastion titans burn in intel channel in the last few months.
---
Regarding jump clones infomorph synchronization lowers the jump cooldown by 1hr per level making it 19hrs between jumps, not super required but helpful. Also if you have access to a citadel with a clone facility it allows you to switch in station without the timer you still have to pay the citadel jump fee (they can be low or none at all depending on the owner) you just have to have a clean clone in station already and switch without jumping somewhere else. You can even do it when your timer is active.
---
Are? You mean were
---
Ironman btw
---
Asking the real questions! Game is a sandbox and you need to set your own objectives! :)
---
The old neocom was absolutely horrible IMO
---
Regarding p2w - there is nothing in the game that can not also be bought from other players with ingame currency. But as other already said...eve is a subscription based game with an unlimited trial.
---
I'm a bitter vet and I usually don't even care about the agency.
---
The fact It was reopening on 5 accounts made me think "did they change something ?" . Then I gave it a try, and it's nice. If I find a bug I will report it. However seing how long it takes to remove the marshal from the epic SOE I don't have high hopes.
---
Yes you will have a great time in eve with a group here is a link for free skill points https://www.eveonline.com/signup/?invc=e59a8319-6d3d-43d5-8ff8-3fc9ac0877e7
---
Ouch.
---
Wait, keepstars can lock past 300?
---
Yes, although you're more limited to the basics that isnt a bad thing while you learn the game.
---
You can have a lot of fun as a small group. Be villians, industrial, team exploration, etc. Newer players tend to gravitate to the more boring parts out of necessity to build their characters up. It is easy to let that spoil the experience, remember to kick some sand castles over regularly.
---
Usually promos relate to plex discounts. If you f2p that doesn't matter. Remember a job is always a better use of your time than grinding out plexing your subscription to go alpha.
---
Nop, still not. Neither in Period Basis. Supercarriers perhaps, im pretty sure a ton of supercarriers died to bombers. But no titans, not a single one over 3 regions that is blue since we moved in.
---
https://zkillboard.com/region/10000050/group/30/losses/
---
Change group to 659 for supercarriers.
---
Is there a walkthrough on how to set this up? I have no clue how to do this or what to use or how to use it.
---
Battleship size gate to Jove space.
---
1 Way NO return.
---
Bring what you need to build.
---
Can Eve afford to take a 5b revenue hit like blizzo did? I don't think so. That question is dangerous.
---
Where did you assume it cannot be dropped by bombers?   
---
* JF/Rorq range 10LY   
---
* BO range 8LY         
---
* Cap range 7LY        
---
* Super/titan range 6LY        
---
Basically idea is that those pockets are outside super/titan jump ranges.

So over 6LY , but well within range of capitals, BO or JF.

---
PA has always been short view, microtransaction focused, and struggles to keep any kind of revenue stream. Honestly surprised they're still in business, I figured their terrible 2017 would sink them.
---
This guy is trying to make a profit of you signing up via his referral code
---
It's also a meme.
---
Yeah  but like what do they do directly, day to day?
---
I'm not gonna run through zkill, you could very well be correct and they are dying to other things. So I guess it's just init that dive bombs people and kills titans no fucks given.
---
Id say buff them in that instance but yeah. Force spreading out in some way, and deplete resources. Sure that might just mean goons become a mobile group that slowly moves round the map hoovering up everything in a region and leaving it dead... but it would at least add some interest.
---
I don't know why. It's one of those places I'd love to settle down. After talking to them though, part of the problem is CCP has too much tech debt and too much of a "we can't afford to do it right" culture that good talent will never go there. It's where game dev careers go to die.
---
Play for fun and don't try to plex out of alpha, it's going to bore you to tears.
---
&gt; I can remember is people clamoring for a return to 2008/2009.
---
Those were the very best years. Bring back Apocrypha!
---
Yep
---
I agree with most of your analysis btw.
---
Idk how it's supposed to be an answer to my post. But it's an accurate mash up of what happened in Eve recently.
---
I never blamed player behavior for the current the state of the game. Ofc it's CCP. And I argue they can still salvage the situation. 
---
I blame Goons only secondarily, not because of the in-game decisions you make, but because how you are massive koolaid drinkers that cockblocks any fertile discussion for positive change (like you are doing right now). 
---
The only thing I disagree with is the claim that "if players band together, you can't stop them". Which doesn't follow at all from your "history lesson".  CCP can literally split your umbrella today by limiting the anom respawns alone.
---
just move to wormholes if you want to be far away from everyone
---
&gt; And to be clear, in 2008 and 2009, eve was super fun, and thats why the population exploded. Instead of listening to people in 2013 they moved farther away from what had made the game fun, and the population reacted accordingly.

QFT
---
can you buy subscription with ingame currency? just like OSRS
---
He also gets a huge boost to skills
---
how do I delete old auth entries in my app?
---
1. To a point yes, but it's really a subscription game and alpha clones are just the trial. There are a LOT of things you can't do with one. There is no p2w; subscribed players have a level playing field.
---
2. Absolutely. I know corps that size that hang out in lowsec or a low class wormhole and shoot nerds and have a lot of fun.
---
3. Get a referral code from someone helpful to newbros. I'm currently helping bootstrap a few lowsec corps with some fellow TEST bros, so if you guys wanna do that, hmu for advice. I can give you rundown.
---
can you buy the subscription with ingame currency? like in OSRS
---
he looks like a hostage reading the ransom requirement for his release ....
---
That is a link literally provided by the development company of the game so I am not sure it’s fair for you to treat it as some kind of scam. The intention of that link is to attract new players to the game so don’t make it sound like some huge scam
---
Yes but it's not particularly cheap due to a bit of a feedback loop between game time and skill point generation.
---
Noice
---
Yes you can buy Plex with ISK
---
I have a theory that EVE's player base is almost exclusively red headed step children
---
i never thought it was annoying, just would close the window but now I know : D
---
Even with dread insurance it's within a couple bil of dead even, assuming generously 700m per dread. Not bad.
---
yes, you can buy PLEX, which is the currency that can also be obtained by real-money purchases and with PLEX you can buy the subscription. It is however costly for new players.

It’s clear you have no idea how people live in WHs, I very much do call Arcadia (our main WH) “Home”, whilst 1 hole doesn’t feed 20+ people, static farming is very much a thing and is a fantastic content generator (hunting C5 dreads or BS fleets), some people have “farm holes” if they want steady isk without relying on rolling a decent C5 connection.
---
A lack of local is not an issue per se, it’s just a variation in how you must play, with higher risk and higher potential rewards, stop acting like living in WHs is *that* hard, it’s really not...
---
How do you multibox 20 cell phones?

What will that achieve?

Was a fun brawl. We expected to be outnumbered by a lot, hence the slaves and caps from our side. Hope y'all still had some fun :D Also do your homework Salivan so we don't need to punish you in future brawls!

Whilst Nidia has the capacity to be a complete and utter dickhead, I don't think I've ever heard him be racist in the two years of hearing him pulling rank on comms. I'd remain sceptical until someone got a SoundCloud.
---
Backing up what old mate said, racism and sexism are pretty great ways to get kicked.
---
I love it!!!
---
Exactly.
---
What we need is not more space, it's the bigger guys not stomping on anything slightly smaller.  
---
It's pretty simple actually: before you take space or deploy a structure, you anticipate if you make the investment (time, ISK, resources) back somehow.  
---
This doesn't necessarily mean ISK, it could also be fights  or another goal.  
---
But no player or group of players will take space or set up a structure "just cause" (at least not repeatedly)
---
Good. That means not everyone has it. Otherwise you might as well make it the standard SKIN and remove default Erebus as nobody will use it.
---
And saying you're paying x dollars is a bit disingenious, as I'm willing to bet 99% of titan pilots stopped spending a cent on this game a long time ago, as they have reached sufficient ISK income.

Others answered very well to your question.

---
If you are looking for a corp that accepts new players, you can write in-game to Crach Adoulin. We are building up a new alliance around Jita.
---
I also do exploration, I can teach everything I know
---
&gt; You cannot do much if you are a new player
---
False, running C1/2/3 Data sites isk a decent way to make isk, you can also solo T3 sites in T1 ships (Myrm comes to mind), or, if you have a couple newer players, you can run C5 sites with 3-4 Nestors... an Alpha clone can be trained up into a fairly good ratting Nestor...
---
&gt; PvE content is limited in your WH, you need to move
---
Ever heard of static farming? Pretty much every remotely relevant WH group has either a C3 or C5 static which is fine for making isk, stop acting like you need to move all your structures every 2 weeks to a new WH...
---
&gt; Life is much more demanding - more alts, scouts, probing
---
I still mostly play with a single char (I have 3, but 2 are specialised), seeding an alpha clone into your hole invade something catastrophic happens takes maybe 1-2hrs at most and you only need to do it once...
---
&gt; If you die you need to find your way back
---
Any competent group uses Pathfinder/Tripwire so you always have a map of your WH chain including any K-Soace connections...
---
&gt; WH is not a place to live if you have too many RL commitments
---
If you regularly take 3+ months off then maybe not, but you don’t have to be very active at all to live in WHs, literally just keeping an eye on your corp’s Discord is usually enough to keep up with the times...
---
Stop acting like you know anything about WH space, you obviously don’t.

&gt; If system is empty and unused - who cares, maybe it will be used at some point.

People who have to travel to reach places with people inside it ?
---
&gt; Funny fact people need space to "krab" to make isk and build a sense of small community within alliance to have common objectives ... in order for alliance to be truly created and people working together.
---
Yeah right because PvP doesn't achieve this at all ?
---
If you plan to go back into highsec it might be a bit tricky because it ruins your standings with at least 1 faction.
---
There is tons of empty systems
---
Small groups do not logistically have the ability to hold space, its not the supers stopping them
---
Small groups have wormholes
---
I dont think that is anywhere near. Concord is well placed as is. There are other stuff mentioned that are stagnating the game.

Don't be ashamed of your shitty music taste :p

Another great example of how this community hates new players.

&gt; Because WH is WH, you cannot call it home.
---
Yeah sure, people have been giving name to their J system but they aren't calling them home right ? 
---
&gt;  It have multiple issues with local anti newbie, or even most of new eden population
---
lol
---
&gt; communication again annoying to live in
---
??? Yeah you can't have discord or mumble if you live inside a WH it's well known.
---
&gt; What is most important ... a -0.3 system can currently feed a 20 people doing various tasks in a single TZ.
---
Statics don't exist right ?
---
I haven't lived very long in WHs but I'm impressed by the fact you have no idea how people live in it.
---
Fun fact PvP is great at achieving this if you don't want to become a krab alliance in a matter of weeks
---
I think everyone missing the main point, in a game where the over all ISK keep increasing (and it really cant be any other way) but the items you can get with that isk is more or less fixed eventually everyone will have the "best" item.
---
What we need is more high end ship classes, we need t2 dreads, t2 supers and titans and possible more classes between the capitals and super capitals. It dosent matter if we "limit" the ore now, i will still have multiple titans and multiple supers.
---
What i will not have is that 400b t2 titan or that 1T battlestar. But someone will
---
Yes if you want to wardec another group you must have a structure you own in HS that you declare as your war HQ. 
---
You can also only wardec groups that own at least one structure somewhere in the game.
---
They didn't do their homework
---
A single guys skill farm having more votes then a corp or even some alliances.

Not exactly good for the game.

You can do this right now. Get a group of friends, take sov, grow, profit.

I like the idea but fear they will be used to different effect than intended
---
Good point, I hadn't considered that
---
Legacy is the second power, not NCPL, and second power is allied to first, so yes, it is POBC very much.
---
1) No. Basically, you can access to a line of low-tier ships and items in the free mode. Get a feel of the game for as long as you want. But then you'll need to subscribe to use the high-tier ships and items. You can pay extra to get ingame money to acquire those ships and items effortlessly. However "winning" isn't a matter of having them, but depends on what you do with them, in which you're on equal ground no matter how much $ you throw at the game. So it's not p2w.
---
2) Yes.
---
3) The best way for you to do this is to get a referral link for a single account. Then make a "chain of referrals" in which each new friend invites the next one. This way you can get bonuses the game offers both for the reffering side and the referred side. Below is the page to recruit your own friends.

So your complaint is that they are overqualified?

They had the right product in the right genre at the right time.
---
Ea killing westwood studios and shutting down Earth and Beyond in 2004 (EVEs only real competitor in the space shooty mmo market at the time) basically assured EVEs place in the history books.  I know i came to EVE after EnB died.  I imagine a lot of other players did too.
---
But sometimes grind is fun! If you’re into business and resources than mining and industry is a fun money maker that yes, it’s grinding, but it’s honest work.
---
How do you make money in said systems ?
---
Background : Was in Brave in Raha. It was shit. Brave FCs were legit replying 'Buy Plex' to queries on comms on 'how do I make money to buy ships'.
---
Any my diamond axe!
---
Now RA has gone AFK, they are TCF's pets, yeah ?
---
You mean an UMBRELLA?
---
I mean pve in general normally becomes boring once you’re used to it. It’s similar to doing dailies in another mmo. Its required for money to PvP in this game. Unless your able to afford plexing when you need it.
---
Also at this point in the game everything is maximized for efficiency. If you find it boring switch up how you PVE.

i dont see the issue, just build more

There's plenty of areas in the game where the UI could use a touch up or at the very least checking if things work properly. The industry screen for example has had varying issues for as long as i've played (~2008) with refreshing, showing false/outdated information, etc. . Making contracts had a feature added (copy a contract, defaulting the itemselection to a corporate hangar) that plainly doesn't work and was ignored as soon as it was put out, even today you can't redeem corp-bought plex from a structure without physically going there as the UI options don't work; despite this kind of functionality supposedly having been released "functional" way back when structures first came out.
---
Basically, even though eve needs constant polish, CCP is mostly polishing the one thing very few people use that's already "okay", instead of spending resources to fix broken things. There's a *lot* of places that could use the UI-centric attention, it being used for the agency for the umpteenth time is a clear and obvious waste.
---
"Grow and develop" is just code here for "rat and mine, build caps, then recruit more people who want to rat and mine". That isn't building an alliance, thats being a renter in everything but name.
---
That would be a really significant difference though. What's a little more likely is a master account which logs in all your linked accounts. 
---
And 'all we ask' makes it sound like it's a simple change. Not so much.
---
(Even if you had one account, and you could get blocks of 3 characters on it, and 1 character logged in at a time, for each sub, that'd be a big change. As you could have characters in the same block logged in at the same time. Which you can't currently do. Be a big change for, say, cyno alts. Which would be a financial change for CCP)
---
While the agency window has use, it's also an issue that it's been reworked like... 4 times now? And every single time, every existing player has it pushed into their face in an annoying fashion. In this case, it got reworked again, and... it defaults to showing on every individual character. Can't even just toggle it off per account, so for those with 3-4 accounts with some characters not used very frequently, they'll be having this screen pop up time and time again like the annoying clippy from word back in the day.
---
It's okay to make a UI for newer players such as yourself, and to default it to show for new accounts so it's obvious. Personally i don't find it okay for said screen to get reworked 3-4 times a year and be pushed to people who don't need it at all, annoying them in the process.

you should somewhere say on that website that you are associated with INIT. Had to look you up on [evewho.com](https://evewho.com) to find that info.

There is literally no no other strategic use of a titan then to blob them up

They also kiss.

The real truth right here
---
And here I thought weaponized boredom was goons' thing.
---
I don't like this idea but wormholes are fundementally different to live in for all kinds of reasons. Not everyone wants to deal with daily scanning, mass limits, limited anoms, no local, irregular logistics, shit mining, actual danger, lack of asset safety, lack of taxable corp income, lack of clone jumping, being rolled out and being limited to one system.
---
1: Well, Eve is the ultimative P2W game. As you can buy EVERYTHING for $. 
---
HOWEVER:
---
\- Eve has a permanent destruction mechanism. (expensive stuff eventually dies)
---
\- Everything is ingame tradable, including all premium stuff. (also the premium subscription)
---
\- Expensive ships are often bigger ships, not better! Just different.
---
\- Premium account gives access to more specialized and simply bigger ships.
---
\- New (and usually poor) players cannot utilize bigger/specialized (and expensive) ships anways, up to half year, so it will not matter anyways.
---
Because of these points, it's definitely worth a try.
---
2: Eve doesn't care a lot about different progress (ingame money, skillpoints etc). You will always have some way to play with each other. Even in the biggest battles with the most expensive ship, a small 1 day old character can make a (small) difference. In fact, in Eve, people flourish when having different roles for different people, and some of these roles can easily be caried out by new players, while other roles can only be filled by veterans.
---
Sure and i want a missile that deletes all sub BS in a fleet.
---
Well, it could be useful. In my case, i did find it myself quickly enough, but since the agency window decided to open in such a way the checkbox was hidden off screen, it could have been easy to miss if i hadn't decide to move a screen i had no intention of using.
---
It defaulted to on for all my accounts. And there's no global toggle, so it will pop up on every character until disabled on each individual one.
---
They work in Python of all things.  I imagine theres a very short list of poeple ready and raring to go start working on a big python project.  Not even considering the fact that they would have to move to living on the top of a pretty active volcano.
---
And according to the Jestertrek ama theres a cultural problem at CCP where non icelanders are cordially treated as second class citizens.
---
Your wish is about as realistic as mine. Mine would fix one of the biggest issues with Eve right now, cause tears and butthurt. Yours wouldn't solve any problems but cause tears and butthurt.
---

---
I'm a small alliance. What's the point of me setting sov in these systems when the safety of my ships will be nowhere near Esoteria or Delve? I'll not be able to use Rorquals at all. I'll have to be extremely vigilant with my ratting carriers/supers as I won't be able to defend them if they get tackled. And I have no infrastructure protection at all, something I'd have if I at least rented from someone. 
---
The current meta doesn't favor small alliances not because there is no space they can carve. It's because large alliances have infinite room for anyone.
---
Your proposal comes from an irrational desire to "change the map" which addresses none of the real problems. I'm all for radical change. But you are not understanding what's wrong currently with the meta.
---
If you are losing people get into a position that mitigates incoming damage, be that pulling range, getting under their guns, increasing transversal etc. Beyond that just listen to what the FC wants. If hes target calling all he needs to know is that the fleet isn't dying and thats your main job.
---
If you're coming from a small gang background you're probably doing that mad clicking stuff. Don't, spend that mental energy watching what the other fleet is doing and try to fly the fleet in straighter lines.
---
And if you give people pockets like that you will deal with worse
---
The game isnt the problem its the players
---
is that why beans and dolphins became butt buddies with protostar of all people
---
hey, you're not allowed to say that and then not link an image actually letting us see. :)
---
I guess the fight was more or less even. But the fact that FRT lost their first ihub to TEST in Detorid might weigh a lot harder. Suddenly they have a secured cyno opportunity in the heart of their space. If TEST can hold it, and anchor some bigger structures, this might become a lot more interesting very soon.
---
When you jump into a gate camp (ie. The camp is on your exit stargate), it refers to propmodding back to the gate to jump back instead of trying to warp away.
---
Haha work in progress I fucked up one trying to paint it and did a shit job, so that was 2 days of printing wasted 😂
---
kinda like test and goons did? cause the proof of concept in that was ualx with panfam being the ones killing the keep(or was x47 before, either way it happened with switched sides).
---
Abbysal missions. You can make from 5 to 10 million every 20 minutes by doing T1 or T2 filaments. If you get  enough ISK you can do T3 and make 20+ millions per mission, which is equal to what you would get by ratting in nullsec, or even better. The income is reliable, but you can lose your ship if you're not experienced doing those missions. But, if you know how to do them, have a good ship, then you can plex yourself easily. If you just started playing, then mining is one of the most reliable. Just go mining to a region where ore prices are high.
---
&gt; After looking into it I like the look of manufacturing and is something I'd like to look at getting into, either that or PI. 
---
PI is not an activity you want to do in the game, as it's not "active" per say. You do like 20 clics every 2 days and one a month or so you haul stuff.
---
&gt; Is it possible to start with manufacturing form the very beginning?
---
If you like spreadsheets, number crunching and hauling stuff then yes.
---
I would recommend doing/re-doing all the career agents first of all. They give you a peak into the different aspects of the game. I would also recommend doing some Sister of Eve missions to build up your experience and earn some starting capital, especially if you decide to go down the production route.
---
Manufacturing can be done early on but you will likely need to start with basic items such as ammo. You can earn reasonable isk from producing consumables such as this but it requires the hauling and sale of large quantities to make big amounts.
---
Once you have more isk, you can look at building bigger and more profitable stuff, such as faction ships, t2 &amp; t3 ships as well as rigs etc.
---
Production isn’t massively time intensive so i would recommend another activity to keep you occupied while you wait on jobs. You could either mine, to make your own minerals for manufacturing, or look at missions or exploration for something to do. Whatever you find more interesting.
---
Don’t spend hours playing the game doing unfun activities to save $15 per month. Spend hours playing the game to do what you find fun. 
---
I’ve been playing since 2007, subscribing once a year, playing whenever RL permits, and never spending real life money to buy ingame items. If I wanted to grind for a Titan, then that became an ingame goal that I accomplished with ingame means. 
---
The only time I have come seriously close to quitting was when I briefly experimented with grinding to pay for PLEX because that’s how I thought Eve should be played. It was a poorly paying second job. Unless you are unemployed or broke, I can’t urge you strongly enough to avoid falling into the grind for PLEX trap (in which case you should probably be finding gainful employment before you start playing Eve).
---
Large scale python rules engines, especially cython and compiled python, are really efficient. For something like eve it's not a bad idea on its own.

Doesn't shock me that they don't want talent.

I haven't personally done much WH stuff, but... considering this is talking about sov space and organized group, wouldn't a structure with a clone bay be an easy way to keep people being able to return to their territory?
---
Abuse...I think you misspelled ‘min/max’
---
That's some big brain logic right there.
---
Now that you mention it, that corner of the window was almost covered by the default position of the notifications button; I moved out of instinct before anything else.
---
Originally, seeing a battleship was a rare sight.
---
Dosent matter, there are more and more ISK in the game so people will have more and more big toys. 
---
Two options, 
---
* 1 - Do nothing and ship cost will be less and less important, we will end up with a "Battle royal" EVE where ISK, Space, Industry means nothing. May as well have free spawning ships
---
* 2 - Acknowledge that people need bigger and better things to spend ISK and and give us more large ships.
---
While I am a veteran player and don't use skill injectors, it does allow new players to "come up to speed" quickly if they so choose.  I think limiting Sotiyo production lines and mineral spawn rates has a lot of merit though.
---
In a WH you can't respawn in a citadel, if you die you respawn in a K-Space system.
---
Capsuleers rise up
---
Oh look you are trying to make a contrived situation where random variables are thrown in so you can try and say eve isn't p2w.
---
Seriously dude, stop getting so defensive about your game. Eve has had one of the best p2w type solutions for fucking years. It took WoW and runescape way too long to catch up to this good system.
---
But in the end - eve is still p2w.
---
The team that runs our Alliance is bigger than a lot of companies we've grown up to something like 30 Directors each with their own teams of subdirectors. My job is to make sure all those various Directorates remain staffed, sets expectations for performance, mediates issues, and works on figuring out who the future Directors will be. When you add up all the ancillary positions in Alliance leadership we easily have over 100 people working day to day to keep things running and someone has to keep an eye on it since Mittens has enough going on himself.
---
The horror

Its an example of protecting new players from predation from people like you.

hm, that sort of negates any usefulness of structure clone bays in WHs then.

This is a good post

Ccp litraly doing what PA bought them for ( making mobile games for China) shock, supirse

RIP. If you don't feel you have the skill to do it justice, maybe consider having a look around your area for a miniatures/card game shop. Might be cheaper to have someone else paint it well for you than to reprint and waste the materials+paint. :P
---
I'm sure you didn't. I don't really blame you for doing it either, I'm sure it was fun as hell.
---
The issue to was that you were pretty much blue to the guys who had the a similar size super cap fleet to you. On top of that you used to poach other alliances titan pilots so no one could ever catch up. It was a bit of a cycle. Again I don't really blame you for doing it or the guys who joined with their big toys. Again I'm sure it was fun as fuck.
---
My issue is that more the irony of you guys complaining about super cap numbers after the tables have turned
---
They are good for holding implanted clones - Virtue, Slave and Talisman pods are common for WHers (For scanning ships, heavy armour doctrine ships and Bhaalgorns respectively).
---
Both of these can be unchecked to remove cAnCeR from the game, but dont mention it guys im just doing my job fly safe fellow capsuleers o7o7

1: This game is F2P up to a point. You can experience a large amount of gameplay and get hundreds of hours of content without upgrading. You could in theory play forever as alpha, but it will eventually feel limited as you are restricted from moving beyond t1 ships and a host of other restrictions.  You will eventually, sooner more likely, feel compelled to go omega because it's more competitive and the best way to experience all of EVE.  Additionally, if you want to grind isk in game to pay for it.. you will spend a large amount of time early on to do this. Think 20+ hours in a month to pay for your sub. It's far easier to pay for a sub one month at a time with your wallet if you are able or a year if able. As far as P2W? There is nothing you can acquire in game with real money that cannot be gained through standard gameplay.  There is no advantage money will convey except for reducing the time needed to acquire something.
---
2: Premades is a term from a game like WoW. You are inferring or asking if your group will be able to play together and the answer is yes. There is no limitation to how many people can play together in a fleet. Also, if one person plays more than the others they won't out level them. They will simply acquire more experience in pvp or more assets and wealth from pve in a quicker manner than the rest, which will still have little to no impact in your fleet and group activities aside from them having more knowledge to share.  
---
3: Green man gaming has a promo right now for 25 % off. Also, you do get referral bonus'. I would recommend one of you start and then generate your referral bonus for the next person and then keep the chain going so each of you gets a referral bonus from the next person. I am unsure if you need to be omega for that or not.  
---
-Shoot me a PM if you have more questions, these are items of conversation I rather enjoy. Anything that can be done to help people with their new experience so that it is a fun one and we retain people.
---
Sharo is an idiot.
---
Shit, this is nice, but I'm not going back through every single account to reset everything up, I'll just scroll through my authenticator.
---
It happens fairly often when I used to run 3 dreads at a time in sites and would refit them during the site. Pretty much without fail I’d get it once a week.
---
This is exactly how I  feel. I have played many other mmos an I enjoy grinding away on mobs and collecting the loot or running challenging dungeons. I just want to do something that is profitable in this game.
---
i miscalculated a jump range once. I lost 14 dreads out of 18 because PL was able to take 3 mids instead of the 4 i calculated in the span of 1 5 minute siege cycle iirc.
---
You can train jump clones and make sure you plan appropriately to jump clone to and from highsec when needed.
---
1. As others have said, consider f2p as an unlimited trial; yiu'll be able to test everything and do whatever you want, but with limits to what skills (or uo to what level) you can train, ships you cna fly and such. You'll also train slower (training is time based, not grind based). But it is great to test the game and decide if you want to sub or not.
---
2. Yes, you can have a lot of fun with 3/8 people in t1 frigates (the first real ships you'll be able to fly), and even have an impact on big fights with them if you know what you are doing. Keep in mind that in EVE the "progression" is relative, bigger is not always better, it will all depend on the activity you are doing and the situation. 
---
As I said before, you train over time (even when not playing), so as long as you guys remember to update your skills queues you'll maintain the same "level" of skillpoints. Playing more or less will only give you more resources and practice (this last part seems obvious, but EVE is a game greatly based on experience and personal skills; you can get anything with money, except that, but that will be the difference between owning others on a fight or feeding like a moron).
---
If you guys want, check out this newbie friendly small corp, which is part of my alliance: https://www.reddit.com/r/evejobs/comments/bzgh1q/voodoo_children_recruiting_pvpindustry_pilots/
---
They do a bit of everything, so it could be a great place to look what you guys enjoy and then either grow there or move on.
---
3. Should be, there's always some pack on discount somewhere or something alike.
---
Welcome o7
---
tbh, it's really for those people who haven't done it yet.
---
You obviously cared about security enough to do it right :D
---
so you "have a friend" who is an alpha and lives with you but plays off a different machine but you obv share the same IP
---
True, if only this came out a month ago when I had to resetup my 2fa authentication on 16 accounts after getting a new phone.
---
I'd send a ticket with that argument before doing it; just in case.
---
&gt;And if you give people pockets like that you will deal with worse
---
I agree, like I said I don't like this idea.
---
&gt;The game isnt the problem its the players
---
No it's definitely the game. You can't expect people to handicap themselves in a competitive game. If the game mechanics reward piling 30k people into one region that's what players will do. If the game mechanics reward curbstomping everyone with 1000 titans that's what players will do. Games have to be designed around player behavior, not the other way around.
---
(Serious question) Does anyone actually play with camera shake or camera bobbing turned on? Adding a checkbox for us to be able to disable camera bobbing is one of the best quality of life features they've added in recent memory IMO.
---
I did enjoy the mining fleet. It was fun chatting with all of you guys and gaining knowledge. Although Abyssal sites sound interesting if they are kinda like a dungeon. And ratting sounds like something I would like to learn more about. I have enjoyed killing endless amounts of mobs in other mmos so maybe I should learn ratting if it is profitable.
---
Wait, did I miss part 1?
---
Beep Boop the bots love your post
---
Cool change.
---
If I could make a sugestion: Having 2FA reduces the likelyhood of getting hacked and therefore reduces the stress on the support team. WoW puts out a little incentive for users to activate 2FA (an ingame pet), and I feel like this is a cool idea. What about granting players access to a line of skins ("guarded") while they have 2FA activated? :)
---
I see what you did there. You completed his rhyme :)
---
This sounds like an interesting idea, but then I would have to earn for two omegas?
---
We had to train up the entire alliance for slowcats specifically because we had identified a cool thing. It took us what 6 months to a year? of training before we had shit ready. Nowadays if you think something is good and want to do it on an alliance level, you simply say "inject it." Within a month you're good to go.
---
Do agency missions then to start, work your way up to a good scrapping ship like a Noctis and you’ll be making bank in no time, and it’s still fun loot collecting.
---
I make them all with pixton and publish them there publicly. Below URL will take you to parts 1 and 2.

Run my friend. Run fast, run hard. Never look back.
---
The hole is deep and dark. Once you gaze into the abyss that is EvE you have lost a part of yourself. All that is good inside you. You think you will take it with you. Hahahaha. Foolish child. You and your friends are doomed, doomed I say.
---
.
---
Nah, come on in, the waters fine. Sure you can play free, but it is so very limited as to be not worth your time playing as a group. $15/month is not so bad for a full experience.
---
Out of everything, try (highsec) mining last. While it certainly does provide you with ISK relatively reliably, but you'll also have to compete with people who are way better organised than you are. At some point you'll think "So that's Eve!?" and quit at some point without having seen anything of the game itself (cue Roy Batty's speech, but Eve themed).
---
If you are more daring; join a nullsec alliance, the major blocks/corporations and alliances have newbie departments and you can join basically "naked" as you would be supplied by said corp/alliance. Nullsec holds tremendous opportunities to get rich;
---
\- A lot of nullsec regions have understocked markets, but the alliances have freight services. Start a little import business. Just find the right commodities to trade with.
---
\- Nullsec has those big rocks you want to mine. Highsec mining is like scooping up dirt with a broom.
---
\- You can earn a fortune by trailing ratters with a salvager. To some people, the Noctis is the most profitable ship they own.
---
\- Even as an alpha you can run Havens.
---
I'm not telling you which ones to join. That's for you to decide. Join Panfam, Goons, Test, Brave, CVA, I don't care. Just find one which has a culture in which you feel comfortable.
---
Solids tips, 100% agreed
---
And that, kids, is why CCP isn't listening to Reddit users when making decisions about eve :).
---
Yeah this Abyssal thing sounds like a cool thing, but I am a little scared that I will break the bank trying to learn it; because I  have no idea how it works.
---
man you guys take roleplaying to the next level.
---
At least it ain’t high sec

I  just thought this post:

---
was kind of ridiculous and wanted to provide a little meta meme on top of that.
---
I have no serious intentions with this.
---
Why are you so interested in the authentication people choose to use?
---
We can either shrug it off and run the empire like shit and expect shitty results or push it as far as it will go and see where we end up. As the people running the Alliance have gotten older and older I think you've seen things get a lot more stable and predictable.
---
Loki pilot here just wanted to make some things clear here
---
i wasnt gate camping in my loki, just saw the charon sitting on a NPC station and decided to follow him, saw him warp of the next low sec gate, warped there at 10km and watched him take the gate, i decided to jump after him and tackle him on the other side since that system has a high sec connection and i called a corp mate and some alliance dudes as back up
---
while i had the charon tackled i was shooting it with mjolnir rage a polarized hecate landed on (i didnt know that he was polarized only after i saw the killmail i realized) so i made the decision to stop shoot the charon but keep the tackle on him as long as possible and reload for scourge javelin wich took me 10 sec to realod, im still wondering if i could have killed the hecate with my mjolnier rage and my tec2 hobs
---
He must be retarded.
---
eh, i guess the swarm of old is long dead and only the name lives on..which I guess is kinda cool in a way, but still. just seems...off...based on what GoonFleet/Swarm originally was and what it is now.
---
Sorry what op was this?
---
But why do you call it a trap? I like that the game provides an alternative to spending cash to get a premium subscription. I have heard people make hundreds of millions or even billion isk per hour. With that kind of flow of currency, getting plex should never be an issue. That's what I want to tap into.
---
The zephyr fits in it! 
---
It works out thematically since probably the biggest use for this ship is for idiots to multi box it in C5 sites for some stupid reason, and the zephyr is the best ship to make bookmarks with
---
I love this very much. I’m going to nag and say that when the guy started yellow-boxing there should be a lock-on warning?
---
Oh, I see.
---
I don't think we are complaining as much as pointing out the fact that there will not be any more cap fights while TAPIrium exists in its current form. We took plenty of fights with the old north or against BL back in the day, but none of us were big enough as a total fraction of null to completely dominate the landscape. 
---
Our use of the toys were more akin to the four guys with AT ships dunking on a kitchen sink response fleet. Fun as fuck and near unbeatable, but ultimately the pain fades as they move on to the next system. The N+1000 state is more one of stagnation. Yes, they can go around kicking over sov and citadels, but no one will ever fight them over it. For me personally, having never flown a super despite 10 years in EVE, it's not exactly what I would call "content".
---
I'll forward that to the it guy, thanks.
---
The current members seem happy enough and the results speak for themselves. A tip of the fedora to the goons of old but I think we still have a good thing going.
---
They'll probably rebuild there and kick the ever living shit out of GotG/DeadCo/Whateverthoseloserscallthemselves as soons as Goons Superfleet goes back to Delve.
---
Only when eve dies will CCP make the big bucks!
---
Not really, they're not listening to anybody apart from the CSM (who get a very limited chance to be heard) because that's their policy since forever. I'm pretty sure many people would agree that titans should be removed from the game altogether, preferably without compensation to the owners. I'm also pretty sure more would strongly oppose as they use titans to earn isk, enlarge their e-peen or meme on how one group of useless shitlords is better than the other. Either way none of this matters. CCP will not remove the titans because they're afraid their owners will all leave (which is a reasonable assumption). The difference between this and keeping the game in its current shape is that the others are quitting Eve all the time, slowly, one by one. In a case of such a dramatic change - the drop would be a lot bigger and more sudden.
---
Too bad this wasn’t changed before I did it for all 35 of my accounts.
---
World of Darkness. But they kept getting reassigned to EVE in classic CCP mismanagement style.
---
Yellow boxing was his warning. He was just too busy on comms explaining his point to no one to realize what was happening.
---
In a world where Italy’s more motivated than Germany, perhaps.
---
Maybe change introduce for Bombers a specialized capital torp module that takes three highslots and has damage bonuses to cap ships and disables cloaking for a couple of minutes after being fired.  Make a fleet of them a legitimate threat for a titan, but also make them vulnerable after getting their shot off.
---
A (large) pack of fleet footed bombers darting in to snipe titans out of existence might be nice way of balancing things.  Titans/supers would have to deploy with effective anti cap screens or risk deletion.
---
World of Darkness?
---
Progression in-game will be the same between all of you basicly, it only depends on where you want to use your skill points which are automaticly earned in a pre-selected skill, second by second (Some skills take 10min on first level then 30 days on level 5)  
---
If you want an activity to do as a group of 3 thats not too hard, do Abyssal Frigate coop runs, can be done out of PVP area and is a good way to learn how to panic. (Of course, tutorial first)  
---
I can get you hooked up for that if you want, private message me here.
---
What is the point though? They have nothing else going on. All their other projects have failed. They want the PA bonus or whatever and then retire?
---
It's comparable to carrier ratting income. It's huge
---
You cant have a sandbox then can you
---
The problem is most definitely the players, the game is a sandbox and you do with that sand how you want
---
Its always going to be a pipe dream of the " small guys" striking the earth and taking something from themselves
---
Just like it is in any situation where more powerful people are around they will squash the smaller guys
---
Eve cant be eve if you start putting in shit like this, admittedly its in a shit state currently but it would be even worse
---
So this is a really dumb question but I’m a glutton for punishment so I’ll ask here on reddit.
---
How TRULY important is 2FA? Wouldn’t I have to be someone important and worth something for someone to try to steal my accounts? Don’t people have to have some sort of information about you or the email address you use at the very least?
---
If it sounds like I don’t have a clue about this stuff..... well it’s because I don’t!
---
Hi there, here is the third episode of my solo pvp adventure in EVE Online. I'm making this serie to improve my solo PvP capabilities, so any tips, advice, fits or ISK are welcome.

Cerberus with heavy assault launchers. I also use the Gila a lot. Both for level 4 missions.
---
Authy is an option now?
---
That’s good news, GA is one of those things it feels like Google started, shrugged and said “good enough,” then totally abandoned. It’s only a matter of time until it gets Picasa’d or Reader’d.
---
I wouldn’t waste the time training a Norris, though. 
---
If you want to do mining/industry train a procurer and some manufacturing skills, and join a nullsec alliance with moon mining.
---
people who steal from those who trust them tend to be incompetent mongs with illusions of grandeur, who would've thunk.
---
different players, different attitudes, and different times.
---
Somehow you managed to look worse than highsec groups congrats
---
It’s mad max out here
---
How does some kid whining on r/eve make us look bad?
---
I have some aars with these retards I'll have to write up later.
---
Verlopen
---
In the real world, intense mining would lead to depletion (iron ore in the Mesabi range in Minnesota, USA).  Perhaps the mineral spawn rate can be tied to the rate of mining in a system or a region.
---
I don't give Gotg a month before they have to call in Goons SIGs / INIT to save them (assuming INIT would even want lol)
---
Perhaps the greatest unexpected content creator yes. I still believe the small alliance club owns the title of the best content creators.
---
Hmm. Something close to that would be T2 Ansiblex. Used for bumping freighters and afk mining ships. Bump them right into nullsec. That's what that ring on the Nestor is: seekret skwirrel ansiblex.
---
It’s okay Seddow. He broke the one rule of flying a super cap: never ever unfit your cyno.
---
*Steel Roamer joins corp, instant drama* *Surprised Pikachu Face*
---
Swing the narrative towards downplaying getting evicted from region(s) for member retention, retreat into the drone regions and adopt the delve model.
---
Thankyou.  Is there anywhere I can find more information on a way to start ? I can find things from 2016 and not sure how relevant it is anymore
---
I surmise that Tenal, Venal and a few other regions will still burn and lose all of their structures.
---
eve online literally on mobile
---
Yes and no. Hopefully like most people you can afford two accounts. It depends on where you are in the world of course but eve is way more fun if you're not trying to plex all the time
---
So far it looks like the corp is a giant kindergarten run by glue sniffing retards
---
GOTG are going to get whats coming to them.
---
This is one of the first reasonable ways I've seen to address smaller entities. From what I have seen, the barrier to entry in being a somewhat independent sov holding entity is about 500 real players. Anything below that and you exist by the good graces of a larger group. Having alliance nurseries that can be attacked, but are miserable to attack and hold, but not as miserable as wormholes, would be a logical compromise. This would allow alliances who thought they had no choice but to join one of the two blocs exist independent of them.
---
I’m sure PanFam/NC. leadership have a grand strategy they plan to implement once Goons get bored and go back home. I’ve heard on the grapevine that NC. and P.L are gonna go live in Malpais permanently, hopefully turning it into a northern version of Delve. Where that leaves BOT rental alliance I don’t know, seeing as E.R has been allocated to Triumvirate and SLYCE and The Spire is now taken up by pet alliances Skeleton Crew, X-COM and Damned Brotherhood.
---
But that is because they do things like this. If their krabs just krabbed 24/7 and never fought then they wouldn’t be nearly as powerful.
---
Hopefully on your new phone you setup 2FA in Authy so you don't have to go through that hell again.
---
&gt; *There are already way too many empty systems*
---
I've been scanning down wormholes that lead to null and poking my beak through. I'm doing this to get the "visited all regions" for Navigation V in the activity tracker. Half of the null systems I jump into during evening (US timezone) are empty.
---
Steel has literally nothing to do with this tho :think:
---
I went from carrier ratting to exploration only for isk. I don't think I'd ever go back using a cap or super.
---
Do not worry, they are also empty during EU TZ and not just the one you get into, but probably all of the region except a few active pockets.
---
Isn't this really old news?
---
Honestly i always felt one of the ideas was that we were going to jneed ot use the new structures to find and build up new space.  I think this is back burned, but i always thought it would be cool that certin wh's lead to a new region of space, that you had to place structures to actually work, like the star gates you had to place to connect your area.  That could give you the pockets you speak of.
---
Authy is a nice one for backing up your code especially if you lose your phone / it gets wiped your able to re-download them without need to go through a hefty process to get your accounts back. Authy is also a free app.
---
I personally use lastpass and their authenticator
---
I don't get why anybody cares about a wardec. It is not like any alliance in the top 50 doesn't have one from random wardec corp x at any given time anyways.
---
The loki was fitted with arties. They hit hard from far away but their weakness is their bad tracking. Thats why my aim was to do what's called "going under his guns", basically orbitting very closely so that he can't track me. That was my plan from the start but I clicked approach for some reason - luckily he was moving sideways so we did have some transversal between us and that's why he didn't get good hits on me. I was lucky that this mistake didn't cost me.
---
+1
---
Unless you're a tycoon, playing Eve solely through ISK and not a paid subscription burns you out *fast*
---
If you are a tycoon... you have trillions to spare, who am I to do anything but envy?
---
Would you please link me what combat fit you use and if possible what exploration fit you use?
---
I would appreciate that :D
---
put together a team of PVP people to smash trade citidels like eve mogul ones. Contact citidel owners and extort them for "protection money". if they dont pay smash the structure, if they pay split it with your crew and make bank!
---
&gt; No Titans or Supers in Low sec
---
I quite like this idea and it also makes it slightly harder to move supers from one side of EVE to the other.
---
You will likely find it difficult to find detailed information on making isk from production because it is a competitive market and if anyone shares what is profitable, it will soon become not as profitable, if you get what I’m saying. The best way to find what is best is choose a list of items yourself and by using Eve IskPerHour to check material costs and requirements on bp’s. Buy the materials from jita and build. Transport product back to jita and sell. Any profit is a good profit and remember that the majority of the time, large profit items tend to take longer to sell. Not always the case but from my experience it tends to be. You will need a spreadsheet or two to keep track of things, if you want to take Indy seriously.
---
Good point!
---
Okay but what about--and hear me out on this---capital exploration. Bob made Capital Gravity Capacitor Rigs for a reason.
---
Only sucks if they wont pay then you basicly have to smash a structure and not make any money.. unless you contact rival trade structures and ask for payment to remove their rivals

There is several way. Im not talking the newbie stuff like us can do, im sure people have give you many sugestion. Im gonna tell you the end game that i have researched for newbie like us to do in the future.
---
There is mining as a way. Top tier ship for it are Rorqual.
---
There is null ratting. Top tier ship for it are super carrier.
---
WH krabbing also a thing. You use dreads for it.
---
The passive way are PI, inventing and researching.
---
Trading/distribution also have huge potential isk if you got knack for it.
---
Or if you have talent in social engineering, build a corp, publish it, and put taxes on your facilities.
---
The simple way is simply buy plex from CCP and sell it in jita/perimeter.
---
Each of them has its own merit. Choose what you like.

Only put guns on it if you are there to fight. Otherwise, neuts may be better for escape. Honestly, you are either there to hack or fight. Trying to do both at the same means you will do both poorly.

I was actually expecting to die, but it was a total surprised that I didn’t, also no one in your alliance honor the ransom, well no matter, enjoy the 3b

---
Johnny Splunk aka EveScout did capital exploration on a few streams, carrier and dread and a rorq once. Fit the rigs on the dread I think just to have them show on the killmail when he died.
---
To add to what other people have said, I’m not sure if it’s still going on, but Eve was offering ~2 weeks of subscription time free for twitch prime users (just look through this subs history to find it). Might also be worth checking out.
---
How is that bad?!?
---
I use login and password. Works well and is not dependent on anything.
---
Stainguy for CSM.
---
Guilty as charged :(
---
I have a question regarding this... 
---
I think this is a fallacy. In the current game state I play as a solo player, I have 6 accounts subbed and bounce between WH and HS because those are the easiest places to make a living without having to invest in infrastructure which I definitely wouldn’t be able to defend even against a small adversary. 
---
The way the current Eve map works, even if all the major alliances live in one or two regions each, there isn’t any SOV space available for small entities. The whole map is already taken and if it isn’t currently inhabited it’s owned protected and rented out by someone who is backed by a mega coalition.
---
It’s literally not practical as even a 25 person group to just pick a pocket of space and try to take it right now. Whoever currently lives there is going to bat phone their big brother or their daddy and kick you right back out. 
---
Eve is no longer a game where you can start out and make your own way even as a small group. Your best option as a small group right now is WH because the mechanics far favor small groups. Which has infrastructure and industry implications in itself. You can’t build titans or supers in WH, whatever wealth you are developing as a growing entity is subject to the WH loot piñata so you are even less likely to invest in empire building infrastructure.
---
If you try putting up small structures to start your small empire building in:
---
HS- PIRAT or CODE will kick down your sand castle just for fun
---
LS-Snuff or the above mentioned groups will do the same thing.
---
NS-well good luck your subject to any of your neighbors and most likely whoever you are trying to take SOV from is going to bat phone and fuck you.
---
So really it’s not as simple as ooooooh my and my 10 friends want to make a Corp and carve out a small piece of Null Sec. it doesn’t work like that. It’s just not a viable option. The only realistic option is to be absorbed by a large coalition but if you’re less than 50 real dudes most of those coalitions make you join an existing Corp in the alliance.
---
Honestly there isn’t a mechanic that supports small groups and it’s very difficult to create one that doesn’t proportionately benefit the large groups. 
---
The only thing I can think of is having different size structures that could only be used by corps with less than X amount of people. This obviously comes with all sort of features you would have to put in place because players will find a way to abuse it like dividing into smaller groups or whatever.
---
The bottom line is you are saying it would benefit smaller groups forcing these large groups to spread out and own more space but the truth is there’s no space to be had by small groups now even with the big guys all in one region.
---
My understand is it was less of goon pressure but Gen Eve had IRL stuff happening and had to AFK and those in leadership didnt know what to do.
---
tbh, \_if\_ you never reuse your password anywhere and you don't log in on devices (or sites) you don't trust, you're probably safe. 
---
If you have reused your password somewhere then first off, you shouldn't have ;) And secondly, 2FA would help here, by effectively changing your password every 30 seconds.
---
If you're \_really\_ careful logging into other sites with Eve's SSO, you're probably safe too. If you might not notice one of them going malicious, and redirecting you to something which looks like Eve's SSO, but actually isn't, then 2FA is a really good idea as it changes your effective password every 30 seconds.
---
We stockpile them at an alliance level, so that in the event of combat losses they can simply hand out new titans and get the pilots right back into the fight.
---
Because if it stops 1 person from getting their account hacked, it's worth the time I've put in on it.
---
If you're meaning the Authenticator, then that's mostly to stop people complaining at me, when they turn on 2FA, their phone explodes for some reason, and then they have to negotiate with Eve Support to get access to their account again.

I don't remember if I use the compact version of the Warp Scramblers or not because of fitting reasons. The two warp scramblers are for hunting Ventures or Exploration Frigates with Warp Core Stabs. Note that because you don't have a cap booster, you will lose against other Asteros. If you want to be able to refit into combat probes, you might have to replace one of the armor rigs with a power grid rig (Ancillary current router) and bring in additional power grid modules, according to your skills.
---
If you want to be able to fight other Asteros, replace a warp scrambler with a Small Capacitor Booster and Navy Cap Booster 400 charges. You also won't really be able to refit into Combat Probes because removing an armor rig will just make you less tanky. Another fitting choice might be to replace a Small Armor Repairer II with a Small Ancillary Armor Repairer (don't forget Nanite Repair Paste as ammo) to get a bit more repair amount, but you might not last as long as you'd want to if the fight goes on for longer. You can also replace a low slot with a Drone Damage Amplifier, but the strength of the Astero is in it's tank, not damage, so reducing tank is usually not a good idea. You can also switch out the afterburner for a microwarpdrive, but this also reduces the time your cap will last, but it does give you a good amount of speed. Also reduces the amount of modules you have to switch if refitting in the explo fit.

I try to keep a minimal amount of changes from the combat fit because of cargo space, so that's why I keep all of my lows the same, but there are a couple of fitting choices you can choose instead. Warp Core Stabs will help you escape if they don't have double scrams, you can also fit nanofibers in the lows to improve agility. You can also fit an integrated analyzer (which replaces both a relic and data analyzer) and fit a warp scram to be able to hunt/explo against other T1 explorers, or even a Cap Booster to be able to be able to fight off (but not kill) another Astero.
---
Are you a CCP dev?
---
Ha. Butt buddies? Nah. We're not even light blue, and have yet to do another op together since our defense.
---
so large mega blocks are fine as long as they are not goons. that's fine you run on whatever platform you like but I wish people were at least honest. pipedream about politicians I know, Eve and RL
---
Yea dipshit, you tried that last summer. remember how it turned out?
---
Currently in the process of writing a petition to CCP w/details on stuff I bought from what turned out to be a hacked account. It looks like within 60 minutes of securing access to the account, the hacker had
---
1) firesold everything the person owned
---
2) extracted all his skillpoints
---
3) RMTd everything
---
That's a much longer time than it normally takes - usually liquidations happen in &lt;20 minutes. 
---
It'll probably take him 3-6 months to regain access to his accounts. If he does, he'll probably never get any of his stuff back; CCP rarely even refunds the isk the hacker got for your items. In less than an hour, his entire Eve career went up in smoke.  2FA your accounts, and **2FA your email.**
---
I'm going to answer this the way I answered it to my alliance which is currently under a great deal of pressure.
---
Eve is a game about stories which has been derailed by the killboard, the monthly economic report, and a culture of power. Eve has turned into a game where people go for the guaranteed kill, the easy Flex, and the self-righteous shitpost. Eve is dead because it's player base refuses to tell any stories for fear that the story will be a tragedy. 
---
It is fitting that goons rules this shit pile, they were the ones who came in and said all stories were useless lies. They emphasized a game without narrative other than power, the postmodern Bob. You can't get space-mad if losing doesn't mean anything. 
---
In every technical aspect, Eve is far better now than it ever was. It can handle more players, it has more useful ships, it has superior graphics, it has more options for tactics and strategies. Loading grid first is no longer a primary win condition.
---
What's changed is the players and how they play the game. The characters which fill up the Empires of EvE book were storytellers. The characters which fill up the EvE server are power brokers. 
---
Life is story; and power is a terrible substitute for story. If you think you can chase the power and then get the story all you ever do is chase the power. But people chase the power and blame the game for not giving them the story. They think if only the balance of power were tweaked and adjusted the story would magically spring out of nothing. The cold hard truth is we have nobody to blame but ourselves. 
---
The alliance I'm in was on the verge of collapse, the balance of power had switched wildly out of our favour -- it isn't even fucking close, our shit is about to get thoroughly pushed in. Panic sunk in, corporations fled to old allies, retreated to safe regions of space, actions were taken to protect the killboard. Everyone wanted a return to safety. 
---
There is no good story that exists in safety. If you want to live the comedy you must risk the tragedy. Luckily there are enough storytellers in my group to recognize the place we are standing. I don't know what's going to happen, but for the next few months power and the trappings of power shall be sacrificed in hope of the epic. 
---
Odds are we get the epic tragedy, but I've read a lot of tragedies and I'm rather fond of them.
---
Authy's been an option for a long time.
---
Eve's SSO is an industry standard TOTP system, cycling every 30 seconds.
---
That's one of the options Authy supports. It's not using their custom stuff, just the basic one.
---

---
As for the time I've put in, there has been a degree of badgering the appropriate dev to make it all work.
---
Surprise content best content :P 
---
The old R64s were probably the greatest content creator ever, to be honest. I think we need a new point-source income for alliances to make war over, but I think the active income of current moon mining is a good thing. Its not like goons can just collect all the delve+querious+fountain+period basis moons with a skeleton-crew of fuelers and reaction farmers. So continued effort from goons is needed to keep churning out huge amounts of goo and minerals. If someone else have more will to mine after this war then goons lose first place. That was not the case with the old R64s, a very minimal amount of people was needed to farm many regions of good moons even if bits of the alliance stopped playing entirely (assuming they could float on the success of a recent war they wouldn't be attacked for a while).
---
Does it still deactivate your 2FA when you change your email address? That being said, I could probably just reactivate it with the same seed rather than having to re-set up my app and the like.
---
One of the reasons you should keep a copy of the seed somewhere :D
---
On the plus side, that's a significant cost you've put on a defense force to maintain their regions. It really is tougher to blob capitals when you can't fit so many in so small an area, and a invested attacking can burn your members out quickly if you aren't careful and spread yourselves thin.

I recommend subbing your account for the first few months as a new player. Trying to start this game, and enslaving yourself to "plex" your account with isk can be a daunting task, which inevitably leads to burnout. 
---
Welcome to Eve, we want you to stay.
---
so then its just a mess off dread carrier and blops gangs? in defense and attack roles
---
Ah, right. Have it apply only for a certain alliance?
---
Or are people just going to create holding alliances?
---
Iron armada final timer for their home fort. Snuff assembled all the pets and went toe to toe until it looked like it’d be a roughly even fight then brought their titans and ruined the party.
---
For one, if that's the _only_ change you made, it would actually make it really hard to kill Keepstars in heavily populated locations.  The defender could just shit out a ton of low-cost raitarus to raise the damage cap to the point where it's really hard to hit the 10% DPS threshold to pause repair.
---
But lets pretend you also fix that such that the DPS threshold is changed to only apply to the base damage cap.
---
As an attacker, then, there's already a lot of motivation to seed piles of low-cost structures that you don't really care about.  This change would give you even more motivation to offensively spam otherwise meaningless structures to soften the defender.
---
is this what happens when wormholers huff too much gas?
---
&gt; So really it’s not as simple as ooooooh my and my 10 friends want to make a Corp
---
If you read my post carefully I argue that the game should encourage many mid-size groups (by which I mean something like 100-500 real people) rather than focusing on 15 man groups. And I argue the game can achieve that by forcing mega empires to spread out via smarter farm distribution (and by balancing capital umbrella mechanics).
---
The hypothetical "whether a group of X can carve space in region Y" mainly depends on their diplo skills with nearby powers. If we assume they have to fight for that space, you are right that it's near impossible. This would be even true for 500 man alliances. The current meta is all about blueing your surroundings. I didn't intend to claim otherwise. When I say "there is space to carve", I assume this kind of diplomatical scenario where you get along with your neignbors. It just means there is lots of underutilized space.
---
And / or you use the same password for every other service and that get's leaked elsewhere.   
---
If CCP get breached your equally as fucked anyways with just a password but you &amp; ccp have bigger issues then.
---
Oh look, bait.
---
I just want to add a small comment:
---
If you people agree with this - then fucking stop recommending every newbie in the game to join Horde, Goons, TEST or Brave.
---
Ah, so when did you leave the northern alliances?
---
An idea i thought about was having it apply per alliance and not per system, but I concluded that it would be abused to all hell. Another idea I'm currently entertaining is to have the change based off of value of the structure. A keepstar will greatly increase the cap, whereas raitarus will marginally increase it.
---
How about: Index based on a constellation moon count weighed against citadel size.  You can anchor some smaller ones across the constellation or fewer big ones that you may want to place more strategically.  If you breach the index cap, 1 RF timer and full loot drops for the offending structures.
---
Edit: and reduced resistances/no damage cap.
---
I like how you keep asking the same shit over and over... lol.
---

---
When your objective isn't a war, it's outforming the enemy so you can "win" without fighting, you do need every pilot.
---
Yup, they were losing dreads pretty quickly then decided to push the "win" button.
---
Then you are not dealing with any "hacked" accounts, so those kinds of issues wouldnt seem to be relevant to you. I dont like how you are pushing dependency on third party programs on people.
---
cmon man, my account was just deleted, please let me post it

Eve is designed as a subscription game.   You can get a long trial, but you'll be limited to certain ships and skills training.   Unlike other games, Eve doesn't give you more skills by playing more, it's time based (longer you're in the game the more training you get) unless you buy skill injectors.
---
You can definitely have fun with 3-8 players.  Eve is really a game where you have to join a corporation and be on coms/mumble/etc. with other players.   The most fun i have in Eve was the first 6 months where you're new, everyone wants to fight you and when the game isn't like it is today where skill injectors weren't available.
---
That sounds like a good suggestion!
---
EVE has rules and CCP decides those rules. Of course they can change the sandbox, they do it every time they change the rules. For instance moving from POSs to citadels, or from dominion sov to fozzie sov, or the introduction of rorquals. All those things completely changed the rules of the sandbox.
---
Like I genuinely don't understand your argument.
---
It sounds like you were playing both sides against each other, after reading input in the comments from Jamico.  Beans did the right thing kicking you, as trusting you would be utterly stupid.  As a form of revenge, for realizing you're not trustworthy, you're here to try to embarrass them.
---
I'd try to sell the character on the bizarre, or maybe just extract and biomass.  I doubt anyone would trust you with a load of fuel blocks at this point.

London is the server farm mostly, isn't it?  So Eve-focused, but not on actually working on the game's codebase or assets.
---
I don't know about that music man.  Especially for this one frig fight.
---
I'd also make that RF timer have a huge window to stop TZ tanking.  Can clean up all overpopulated citadels in two nights (if you cba)
---
:)
---
You can try ships and fits out on singularity (Sisi) - the test server, even as an alpha. You have to wait a bit for your character to copy over, then you can experiment as much as you want on there.
---
I built a low skill (skills were all L3) alpha Punisher fit capable of soloing T1 frigate abyss (normally fleets of three Frigates) this way.

Any changes that benefit small groups holding space will benefit bigger groups more

Without totally reworking eve from the ground up there is nothing you can do to stop it
---
&gt;Imperium have been the blueballs Queen for years now. Then don't cry not having fights that's it.

---
And who is that?
---
Monster.
---
+ Lifeblood Rorquals basically shitting Minerals, so 1 Multibox miner farms the ore amounts in a few hours that whole alliances gathered in weekend-long alliance mining ops.
---
&gt;.we're just paying you back for old time's sake
---
Nobody cares about this except some old timer Goons who have been ratting for last 5 years.
---
So what? The game still needs changes anyway because it's in such a shit state right now.
---
Meh, social justice warriors.
---
You can also just go to about 1s before the video ends and leave it at that.
---
TLDR: Chinese EVE mobile game still ~~being prepared for the dumpster~~ in development. Hilmar's excitement mirrors that of the EVE community: non-existence.
---
I don't think that this is a good idea. What eve needs are sov mechanics that break up big coalitions/alliances and focuses more on fighting your neighbors instead of blueing them.
---
I always thought about this idea:  If a citadel dies in a system, the ADM goes down if the alliance matches.  Then, tie the damage cap to the ADM and sov holding (in particular, the TCU so that it matters more).  Its a tricky system to manage, but a hostile force could not anchor a citadel and then haze it to lower the ADM, and if you keep citadels out of alliance, the damage cap is modified.  Let the ADM benefit the holders damage cap (and sov ownership lower fuel costs), but make it so that razing a structure lowers ADM and tie all these systems together.  
---
If an alliance spams citadels, they open the risk of getting their ADM hammered really fast.  If they have a few, they gain the benefits of a citadel.  If they have none, where do residents park?  If a hostile force spams a bunch in a system, if the TCU flips, they are not exposed to the ADM effects.  If they park a bunch out of alliance, the fuel costs are higher and the damage caps don't gain benefit from controlling the Sov.
---
Not for nothing, but new iHub upgrades that change the fuel performances of local citadels would encourage sov holders to keep structures in alliance.  (any system in Eve is going to get abused to the fullest.  I've been tinkering with this idea for a while, and I am sure its still not quite right)
---
What is building an alliance then, if you want Null space but not interested in growing what is your goal?
---
I thought they spiced it up a bit with the new AI... but I guess that would break to many important playstyles such as VNi afk-ratting and so on.
---
I have a hecate with similar fit that has a few kill marks on it, this vid has inspired me to try and lose it xD
---
&gt;Reintroduce passive moon mining with a moon re-balance that places a more geographical approach to moon mineral availability instead of just random seed, then make these moon minerals cycle quarterly to encourage fighting over resources and mobility of blocs.
---
Passive moon mining was aids. And making the moons rotate around seems really weird. Personally I'd love to see the PI mechanics added to mining anoms and moons. i.e. if you over harvest a specific ore, it doesn't come back for awhile. So sure, you've got a fancy R64, but each time you mine out all the monazite, you get \*less\* with the next frack. 
---
The net result of that is encourage different styles of alliance: you can either live in a region and mine it out constantly and get a baseline income Or you could be a nomadic alliance that takes a region for a month or two, harvests the jackpot moons, and then moves on again. (it would take a month of not being harvested for a moon to recover to full jackpot state)
---
It also punishes those who completely mine out their anoms, because when they spawn again, they have less in them. Which creates an incentive to conserve minerals instead of just wolfing down as much as the game will create.
---
It does need changes
---
But little pockets of space wont do dick
---
Unless you can somehow limit or penalty the use of N+1 in eve then always bringing or having more dudes is going to be the name of the game
---
Supers and titans compound that even more with power creep, so at this point you would almost need "eve 2.0" to actually fix this and wipe the slate clean, horse has already bolted on Eve with that
---
Fuck snuff

Goons/Imperium learned a lot of lessons from WWB. One of the biggest mistakes that MBC made was letting us slink off to the other side of the map to lick our wounds and rebuild. I have no idea what our plans are, but I have a feeling that our leadership is motivated enough to not make the same mistake. I see either a semi-permanent SIG/Squad deployment to anywhere Panfam retreats to, and/or a semi-regular coalition deployment to knock down whatever Panfam tries to rebuild.
---
1.) Technically, yes. EVE *is* a subscription game, but has a sort of "free trial." When playing without a subscription, you are limited in the number of skills you can use, which in turn limits the number of ships you can use and the types of equipment you can use. In EVE you train skills over time; as a free player it would take ~250 days of training to reach the soft cap, and an additional ~300 days of using an "alpha injector" daily (or ~350 days of training with a subscription) to reach the hard cap for skills for free players. Beyond this point you need a subscription to be able to train and use any further skills. If you train skills that only a subscribed player can use and stop paying your subscription, you don't lose those skills. They are merely disabled until you subscribe again.
---
The skill cap limits you to "tech 1" and "faction" frigates, destroyers, cruisers, battlecruisers, and battleships. You won't be able to use "tech 2" or "tech 3" ships. The skill cap also limits you to mostly "tech 1" equipment, although there is some "tech 2" equipment that falls within the free limits.
---
You can also technically purchase subscription time using the ingame currency, "ISK." The current market price of the subscription item is, however, difficult for most free players to obtain. Every item on the game can be bought and sold on the market, although some items are only initially obtainable through special events or by paying real money (although these items are purely cosmetic) before whoever received the item decides to sell the item on the market.
---
2.) Absolutely. As mentioned previously, skills in EVE train over time, not by playing. Additionally, even with relatively few skill points, new players can be useful even in huge battles. Because of the way EVE's skill system works, a new player can become equally as effective as a veteran at using a certain ship or piece of equipment in relatively short order. The only difference between you all is going to be your incomes - in which case you're always free to send ISK to each other, assist each other in missions, etc. If one player focuses on training their weapons skills and another focuses on training their logistics skills, they may have the same number of skill points but have wildly different specializations and be much more effective when working together than when working alone.
---
3.) There is currently a promo going on where if you have Twitch Prime, you get 15 days of subscription time (which doubles your skill training speed), a free special event destroyer, and a cosmetic skin for that destroyer. Additionally, it can be worth it to use a referral link when you sign up. If you end up paying for a subscription later, both you and the person who referred you get some goodies. If one of your friends signed up and gave referral links to the rest of your group, it would be easy to share those goodies amongst yourselves.
---
Gf, I meant to bring in titans sooner but our cyno went AWOL
---
You still have an choice, yes.
---
Personally, I think it's a bit of a no-brainer, but you still have a choice. 
---
You also appear to have some issues with detecting when someone's being tongue in cheek about something. Or when someone writes a topic heading to deliberately draw attention.
---
Not really just from that. From the drama i read here, you havent clarify the reason you failed handling the stuff you got from Apex.

Changing anom respawns doesn't hurt goons. It hurts everybody else. You're just not understanding what I've already said. You cannot make gameplay designs in order to hurt goonswarm, every time you do, it fucks everyone over way worse than us. Let's say you lower anom respawning time, that just makes everything within our umbrella optimized from 75% efficiency to nearly 100% efficient, as not every single anom is run every single time as it already is. Lower respawn rates and everything in Delve will be run every single time irrespective of difficulty and the umbrella will stay right where it is.
---
Back to what you said though, its not our gameplay style (which has a direct cause effect relationship to game design decisions made by the developer) but rather you hate the 35,000 people that are part of goons because we -- we choose to play with each other and understand the history of what's happened to our coalition repeatedly in order to damage us, making the best of the hand dealt to us every time?
---
So you want, and I'm just going to recap, because it's important that people understand what you've publicly said, you want CCP to stop us from associating with other, to stop us from empire building, to stop us from turtling up into one region, to stop us from being friends with one another, to stop us from having standings with other alliances, etc in other words blow up our organization through game design, and you believe that somehow you can create game design to do this that doesn't royally fuck over the rest of the game and cause more player retention problems? You must be completely out of your mind. Why do you want us to have all of our bridges and castles burned down in order to meet YOUR preferred play style? You realize your advocating using out of game methods to change the rules when you're not on the winning side, just to damage your enemy because you cant seem to win against them on your own?
---
See, this is what bothers me about you, you seem to think that goons have done something so completely bad and damaging to the game, but all they've done is play the game at the absolute highest level available within the current meta as an organization. Their achievement over the past few years coming off of their stunning defeat during The Casino War is proof positive of why having a well tuned organization is important in this game. Every organization could do this, as Test has done, and a lot of them that are our traditional enemies chose not to.
---
Irrespective of any organizations size, you've stated that you just want to burn it all down because you dont like other player organizations and you're not a part of them, and you think for some reason that having these large socially cohesive organizations is counterintuitive to your play style. That's fine and dandy for YOU, but that does not make you in any way well prepared to sit on the CSM or even have a successful transition into the CSM with Aryth, Merklechen and likely Innominate at the table. You'll just be able abject distraction and a waste of preciously needed feedback on important changes coming down the pipe and how they impact these greater eve communities that participate in these large organizations and have made these communities their home.
---
Dont go around trying to fuck everyone else's lives and organizations up because you're miserable. At the end of the day, nothing you've suggested to this point would even come close to hurting goons in the terms of production or organization cohesion, but it would absolutely hurt the hell out of smaller upcoming alliances, and definitely beat up Horde and kill player retention even further over there.

gf lads, nothing like watching your dread get DD'd from your subcap screen lmao
---
My bitter shriveled heart can't handle this much joy.  Can I have your fuzzy space babies?
---
was a fun 3rd party.   Sorry bout your fort and the titans that were dropped on you.
---
Nice, looking forward to these
---
Villore with snuff and G0N3 with 3rd party
---
Not all the pets, INIT wasn't there.

People telling you they make billions per ISK usually talk about themselves being &gt;150m SP omega characters living in the highest profitable regions of space with 4 multiboxed bling fit carriers and dreads or other super optimized setups, probably in a professional corp/alliance with equally euipped friends. They they probably also out-calculate all idle and waiting time and just extrapolize the activity itself and then round up another 30-150m to make it a sound number. and suddenly you're astronomical numbers like 2b/h. It's basically boosting your ego by telling other people how rich you are. They often are like politicians so far removed from "normal scrub players" that they don't even know that players don't have their ressources, knowledge and everything else required for that and that they don't even might have the same playstyle.
---
I personally would say, that a relatively new player (that already knows the basics of flying a ship and has like 3m SP) can get very reliably (!) 50-100m ISK/hour on average also depending how much effort you put in it and how serious you are about ISK, of course.
---
If you calculate with a "fairly normal" but good average income of 100m ISK/h, that two dozen hours for 1 months of playing time. How much online are you? What about the Corp/alliance? PvP? Having fun? Losing ships? Getting interrupted by fleet calls? Talking with people? investing in ships/assets which removes money as well?
---
I had quite a few people quitting the game because they were unsatisfied after veterans told them how much ISK they could make but ended up making not even 10% of it and I am so pissed because of it.
---
Long story short: If you play relatively alone, and grinding PLEX is your ultimate goal and you have fun minmaxing every single ounce of your eve life and plan every single minute of it: by all means, do it!
---
But if you are just too unwilling to pay "becuz muh options" - then just pay the 15 bucks, alpha has WAY TOO MANY restrictions for you to have a) fun b) efficient methods of grinding.
---
omega is the only way to play this game properly and if you're not completely broke and bankrupt, give the fucking money to CCP.
---
Whatever one you set. Harass these guys, dominate this, be kings of x region, etc. Look at Pizza and MOA as examples, they just lived in an NPC station and made life a nightmare for whoever lived nearby. There are things to do besides be the biggest, you might miss out on a lot of the "endgame" capital gameplay, but there's a whole world of other stuff you can do instead.
---
I'm not arguing one playstyle is better, I'm just saying there is and should always be a lot more than one.
---
A monthly subscription costs about $15 or 500 PLEX. At current prices, 500 PLEX is about 2.12b ISK (https://evepraisal.com/a/mlca6). 
---
People typically don’t make as much as they brag about making. Someone making the kind of money you discuss is throwing multiple accounts and/or very expensive items at making that kind of ISK (or station trading). 
---
For me, good ISK/hour is somewhere in the realm of 150m-300m/hour per account. So, assume it takes you 7.5-15 hours of uninterrupted PVE to make enough to PLEX each account every month. That’s 7.5-15 hours a month of PVE before you start making ISK to replace lost ships, get new ships to try new things, etc. At that rate you are making $1 or $2 per hour while doing a repetitive and often boring activity.
---
The other upshot is that your gameplay becomes focused on grinding ISK for the account. That means that fun long term projects (e.g. a shiny ship) require even more focus on PVE. That means that any PVE losses potentially impact your ability to even play Eve, making you even more risk averse.
---
Adding multiple accounts just makes the problem worse, because it takes time to build and plan your accounts so that each one is able to pull its weight. Not every activity scales equally well.
---
Adding grinding for ISK to purchase SP further exacerbates the issue.
---
This is also relevant: https://youtu.be/oSPT27XyY1U
---
I know there is still a choice, but the question was essentially: would you take it away if you could?
---
&gt;You also appear to have some issues with detecting when someone's being tongue in cheek about something. Or when someone writes a topic heading to deliberately draw attention.
---
No. Normally, these threads are to be ignored, but because it appeared have some kind of relation to CCP (that's why I asked if you were a dev), this could potentially be more serious than your average troll post.
---
Don't be sorry, we dropped the fort forever ago to get content, and this was the third time it was in hull timer (as OP mentioned).
---
I think we got our money's worth of content and fun from it :D
---
"Haha, look at that idiot getting DD'd"
---
*notification ding*
---
Agreed, from the other side.
---
I have to agree. Living in a WH really isn't that hard. It is however very engaging, which I think most people do not want. Even a lazy wormholer is going to hit V once in a while.
---
I think most people cant handle the culture though. Which is a big deciding factor. Wormholes require action.
---
Story time: Last night, our little corp was farming up a c4 mag that graced us with a connection to our tiny little c3 home. Being a good wormholer boy, I was spamming V and watching TV while I huffed some of that sweet sweet gas. My buddy calls out on comms "combat probes, let's bounce". Seeing 2 Sabres on dscan, I'm like fuck yes, let's dance. They werent incredibly aggressive on the hole, so it was obvious there was a fleet behind them. Regardless, I get my confessor out to shoot them. One goes into low shield and warps off. He's still on d-scan, but w/e I ain't sticking around for that. At this point, I did break one of Bob's holy mandates and meme'd in local a bit. I get back to my computer and see they are all in our home system and want a fight. This is where the culture aspect comes into play... always undock. You don't dwell in these lands, and enjoy the vast riches, if you don't undock. Needless to say, I unloaded the mtu's out of my ratting fessor and prepared it to be sacrificed as tribute. The fight went about as well as to be expected (alpha'd off the field as soon as the rattles gecko was in range). We live in a c3 WR so the ships we brought in probably would have faired better had we convinced to fight on our home turf. Regardless, both sides new this was tribute to something greater. GF's were had in local, and off they went, didn't even loot the wrecks.
---
Conclusion - Wormholes aren't hard. You just gotta play ball. WH space is actually better than what OP is talking about in my opinion. You bet your ass we're gonna roll that c4 if it's still there when I get home - meaning small groups can influence to an extent who and what they are connected to. The OP's idea seems like some sort of mini NS that has absolutely no benefits.
---
It has a relation to CCP. This is functionality which has just been enabled.
---
As for why I posted it, I was the CSM member who was poking CCP to add the option.
---
Pretty sure conifers and gone fission were on snuffs side for this - check some of the kills, you can see them against the iron fleet.
---
I've been getting a lot of invites, going to try this out.
---
You mean like NPC null space?
---
I play pretty casually. I've got two accounts, 1 for PVP and one for mining/industry. 
---
I make a little bit of ISK from mining/industry (just started out doing this in some spare time I had), but most of my ISK comes through buying PLEX once every few months and selling it in Jita/Perimeter. Past that, most my ships costs are [pretty minimal](https://zkillboard.com/character/96969831/). 
---
I'd say I play a couple hours a day, maybe a bit more on weekends (6-8 hours total over the weekend if I'm lucky). 
---
If you have any questions or whatever, feel free to contact me in game through EveMail or message me if I'm online.
---
Have you tried turning your computer off and on again?
---
Hugs?
---
We will not chase them into the Dronelands, that is the line that was drawn. So expect them to move there.
---
Is your computer plugged in?
---
Oh hey everybody, in case someone forgot to mention it, The Mighty Beans are recruiting!!!!
---
Underrated comment. 
---
Instead of building a larger coalition of like minded groups to take the fight to Delve, or grow their own group large enough to compete with the new capital meta, they would rather spend their time farming smaller groups, pushing around their own alliance members and basically play the same game that was very clearly not working. 
---
But...you know...Eve is broken.
---
This.
---
It s your opinion but not a fact. Nothing you can buy with $$$ you cant with isk in game. Only skill of the irl pilot matter. What make you good or bad is your own experience / skill / decision, not your $$$$ or wallet.
---
But there is a fact : the more you pay; the more you will loose (if you undock of course).
---
You brought a T5 Cerberus into T1
---
&gt; limited anoms
---
Farm a static
---
&gt; actual danger
---
Stop being a wuss? You won't be evicted if you actually undock and fight, even in T1 BCs.
---
&gt; lack of taxable corp income
---
Blue loot buyback is a common thing and allows a 5-10% tax.
---
&gt; being limited to one system.
---
Farmholes are a thing and Krabbing is usually done in Farmholes or the Statics (usually a C5 static)
---
not a bad idea that
---
U leave that newb ship alone. It did gods work lol
---
you keep saying ring of fire like we know what you mean by that
---
do  you mean revolutionary feature? because the actual full integration with eve that we were promised with dust would most certainly be it. shared markets, shared sp system, shared chat, shared corporations, shared battles, would 1000 percent make Nova the next big thing
---
i really dislike the idea off pushing around smaller group's, why farm them when you challenge against them is basically nothing.   
---
ill'd rather sit by and watch them grow in till they are at lest a threat, maybe even help them get to the point so that they can fight at a similar level and offer a challenge rather then a farm land.
---
yeah well, even then the meta keeps shifting (eventually, maybe). keres, mni, balanced legion would be kinda ok with the tackle range boni and passable designs
---
they could do some sort of homeland security theme with supercaps instead, but why bother when everyone is drooling
---
p.s. isn't erebus your #1 gatecamp ship anyway lol
---
From RTF (the tnt Corp there) we had a blast. Was great to be a part of it. 
---
Like always, &lt;3 IA and Snuff for what they bring to the game.
---
Per alliance would result in a series of holding corporations/alliances per coalition to work around it.
---
&gt;It s your opinion but not a fact.
---
Can you point directly to where I stated anything that wasn't objectively true?
---
&gt;Only skill of the irl pilot matter. What make you good or bad is your own experience / skill / decision, not your $$$$ or wallet.
---
Yeah and if two people have relatively similar skill levels, the person who paid rl money wins most of the time.
---
Yeah. There are a lot of benefits to upwell structures, asset management and things like the clone bay they beat POSes hands down.
---
I think the defences could do with another look but they are OK, Its mainly just the Upwell timer mechanics that often stop me wanting to undock a fleet so often on the basis there is often zero _chance_ of me being around on the exit timer.
---
That is exactly what I concluded, and if you look in the thread I've said this already.
---
thank you for demonstrating what we all argued against but ccp in it's infinite wisdom knew better; if you ever have to do something disadvantageous you lose everything and quit playing
---
They were shooting whoever - - definitively not on our side, that's all I know.
---
"pos are annoying to live in please make it better"
---
"holy shit we said better to live in not invincible"
---
So?  Did you not read his intentions in his post?
---
how would you remove citadels that are already placed but are now in excess to your limit?
---
That's your own assumption upon my words, I merely just pointed out a fact
---
gf
---
That's a universally applicable solution to all parts of.....aww shucks, it's a null sec boi! (There's more to space than sov)
---
Random neutrals would hide here from you killing them becaus they had docking/tether privliges
---
Matterall alt detected.
---
Don't worry about me scramming you, I read on the forums that better loot will drop this way.
---
Wew meme theft is a serious crime!!!!
---
Passive is pretty simple, should be fine with navy AB, a t2 hardener, and t2 extenders, everything else should be obvious
---
&gt;Feeding in LS was a problem,
---
Imagine actually thinking this
---
This would be great but would instantly be exploited. The larger entities would just gate into jump range, take the space, and rent it out. Even better the possibility of the botting empires to move in which may or may not make it easier to hunt them.
---
It's sad but the mentality of join or die (or at least pay us so we don't have to stomp you out) is the cancer of Eve player base mentality. There are plenty of off the path systems of -0.1 to -0.4 that many would love to have but aren't being used at all by the bigger blocks. Even if the smaller alliances get a hold of these side pockets there is nothing to say the larger blocks won't just one day show up and stomp around just for kill marks.

In most battle royale games, you have a contracting ring around the play area, to ensure that, over time, people actually find each other and fight.
---
It's the enabling feature which makes BR games work.
---
nope, just tried it... all normal for me. 
---
best of luck
---
have u considered that ccp could've improved the QOL of POSes without rehauling the ref system
---
You can never huff too much gas, maybe it's the equivalent of Spod brain
---
For those of you considering this, a slight security recommendation:
---
Group accounts by type, and use the same seed across their groups. One key for your main and cap accounts. One key for your director spais. One key for your skillfarm, etc. If you would be sad if someone got control and did the maximum amount of damage they could, key it.
---
I know a lot of you will be tempted to come up with your own, easy to remember key. Nobody will stop you but yourself so here's some tips for that:
---
* Don't make it the same/based off your password/name/email/birthday.
---
* For the most valuable accounts, like your main, capital, and director accounts, just get random seeds autogenerated. It's not that hard.
---
Dont write down your seeds either, especially not on the internet--that includes private google docs.
---
If your email service offers it, 2fa that too.
---
Remember. It may be a pain in the ass in the short term, but if you don't do it, you risk having to go through many months filing tickets because someone sucked you dry like a husk.
---
no
---
um....lol
---
Cerberus uses missiles; facts.
---
They need to build a sustainable core game, there is no point spend 80% of Dev time building the connection with EVE if the gameplay is crap.
---
What they make as their revolutionary feature is always gonna be difficult with a game in this genre, but definitely leverage the EVE lore and assets. Maybe more environmental hazards, variable G, acceleration inertia from the ship you are on etc could make things more interesting.
---
You can undo and redo them if you want.
---
But even if you dont you've done it the right and best way.
---
The only solution is to remove Titans and Supers.  Every attempt to balance them so far has failed, and has introduced serious unanticipated consequences to boot.
---
Remove Titans and Supers.  Give people the SP back, and maybe enough injectors to pull out all of the extra SP if they want to.  Give people the option to either get the isk value of their Titans and Supers or keep them as showpieces that can no longer fit modules, and that only grandfathered-in characters have the special (0 SP) skill to sit in.  This would render it much more possible for smaller, more skilled or dedicated groups to stand up to larger, more established groups, and it would mostly remove the content-killing effects of nigh-invulnerable supercap umbrellas.

i live in a low connection area, so is it my download speed is so low i don't see progress being made on the progress bar or did i mess up something in my settings? or something else
---
\#1, no. its free to play, but its really more like "playing in demo mode"  
---
2, yes. thats a great size to do things in  
---
3, kinda. if you can find anything that gives you a discount on the monthly fees, plex, or skillpoint boosts, go for that. cosmetic stuff really has no affect on this game for your character, and no one cares (even if ccp thinks they do) about clothes etc. Ship skins are where its at for aesthetic
---
was just going to type this exact thing!!! everyone cried that pos ruined content. Now for some reason they were the holy grail of it.
---
Sharo and Crizwoo are more than capable of being completely incompetent on their own. Steel atleast explains it to Sharo when he does something retarded lol
---
CCP did, for once, basically what everyone asked and now they hate it! Baffling
---
Was in my stratios with a belly full of loot. Jumped a gate and there was a small camp (3 guys). As soon as I uncloaked they insta locked and instead of crashing gate cause they were all aggressed I tried to burn away, while scrammed and webbed. I was explo fit and lost 500mil plus Hull and fit.
---
Not one of my prouder moments.
---
I mean, they promised you a cut, whatever % you were promised out of 0 is still 0
---
Content and Freeport thus supports lowsec null blocs universally use amamake one
---
Helaas verlopen
---
Ah, ok.
---
There is an even lesser chance than zero that the enemy will defend it. I've busted up many a citadel with just 1 leshak. I just set my alarm to go off 30 minutes after I start its cycle. When i come back the citadel is kill and I just log off right there and go back to sleep.
---
Thanks for doing this!! It's a huge help for people to understand filament yields.
---
What does spodbrain mean?
---
Station games may be annoying if youre the one getting baited, but theyve always been a method for a single knowledgeable pilot or small group of pilots to get kills when outnumbered.  And the larger more salient point is that that whole form of content is basically gone now due to the unbelievably poorly thought out nature of tethers.
---
Did you loot just the lootbox, or also the 2 or 3 boxes on the walls?
---
I think you mean "don't hate the players, hate the game"
---
Or just use BitWarden premium with TOTP support
---
well you are a small group that is the pet of the biggest group in eve to be fair
---
Even with a bad connection you’d make a bit of progress.  Try the Beta Client?
---
This.  
---
So much negativity on this thread, but people forget for every strategy there is a counter.  
---
Build a bigger alliance and take the fight to the Goons.  We are only just a bunch of care bears after all.   The problem is that this would actually require a shift in how the north plays.  They would have to work together as a team, put aside differences.  Take big risks.  Do they have the energy and interest to do that...who knows.  
---
If the Goons can come back from being evicted totally,  living in NPC stations and a fraction of their pre WWB size, to a powerhouse in a few years, then any group had the ability, if they want it bad enough, to do the same.  All it requires is the ability to read the meta, stick together and not want to die or become irrelevant.  
---
Make a new WWB...but with less free casino money.  Take the fight to us.  If you don’t want to, then I expect with time someone will.  It’s the nature of the game.
---
I agree with most of this post except 1 bit, please don't farm in a C4, C4 ISK is absolute garbage and the spawns are too far away, eiter run C3 sites in a Myrm or w/e or buddy up and run C5 sites in Nestors and Leshaks
---
dodged a bullet there
---
Dear mister Peligro, would it be possible to start recommending Authy to the playerbase? It's infinitely better than the current Google solution you're recommending.
---
the shooting needs to work but, as we can see with Eve, the gameplay doesn't need to be nail-biting action in order for the meaning of what you're doing to make you bite your nails
---
Eve is about consequences, nova can be too. don't just run and gun, move with purpose because everything you do matters, because it is part of the eve universe now
---
Please. The launcher should just boot up characters that you omega individually. 
---
CCP could benefit from a much more granual subscription model. Of alpha &gt; omega &gt; training. Per character, $5 a month to omega, $10/month for omega plus training/login, or something like that. Or just keep it as it is now. 15/month for 3 omega slots and one training slot. 
---
Put them all on one account subscription. Make it cheaper for vets to come back and fly thier caps and stuff, reduce the barrier to making alts, but maintain the cost of running a bunch of them. 
---
Finally allow running different combinations of alts without having to juggle thier roles across accounts.
---
Reason why Rote never wins 🤫
---
I played Eve and every space game pales in comparison. I played Elite dangerous and the only reason that kept my interest was the inside the cockpit view
---
Do you have:
---
* Over 5.5 million SP, or a desirable skillset like a focused dread pilot
---
* 250m isk in liquid and assets combined
---
* A password that is simple, reused, or based on other personal information
---
* OR significant access to any corp assets or privileges
---
* OR significant character reputation or notoriety
---
* OR attachment to that account
---
Secure it. Takes 5 minutes of your time.
---
It's BEEEN, that's a pretty apt description.
---
You are seriously claiming that NC/PL dont care about killboard stats?
---
While I agree with don't write down the seed in theory in practice, if I use a random seed how will I ever add it to more accounts if I get additional accounts?
---
i hate all these mobile games where all you do is throw money against the wall to beat the guy next to you, and if you don't use money you basically can't compete.
---
And as long as people are willing to pay for these sort of microtransactions more and more developer-manpower gets moved over into development of such games.
---
result is no moneyinvestment into actual games be it EVE or whatever and instead invesment into all these sort of moneygrab games.
---
the sad thing is, it seems this sort of farming is what people want, you can see it in eve where the majority actually enjoys getting rich but not really doing anything with it, except swinging their spacepen around.
---
Best example is goons atm, burning a whole region, telling everybody and their grandmother all day how good they are while there is no actual player interaction (pvp) is happening.
---
no offense what goons is and can do has my full respect, but the fact, that goons basically play this pvp game by themselves makes me (again) sad.
---
and that's just one example, all the other null blocs do the exact same atm, clustering up farming, dying randomly in whatever random roam, experience this as great time, log off.
---
i am missing the meaningful part :( and mobile games are just the next respectively current generation of brainless effortless instacontent nomeaning crap, that nobody needs, but everybody wants apparently :(
---
i used a T5 cerberus as i had seen a streamer do them in this fit, can't remember streamers name, and since i personally haven't touched abyss prior i felt i needed a 'uptiered' fit as it would give me a fit which could easily take it on.  
---
Other part lies in the "why change a winning fit" thought.  
---
And yes i will take it to T5 eventually, once i get comfortable and familiar with the sites.
---
Because you can go to the first exploration career agent, go through 30 minutes of tutorial missions, and be making several million isk on a starting character. I did this 2 days ago. Spun up a new character, Ran through the tutorial. went straight to the exploration career agent, and by the end of the night I had 20million credits.
---
That's totally fine. But exploration is hit and miss. Sometimes you'll find a system with 3 sites, sometimes you'll scan down 15 signatures in 5 systems and find nothing but wormholes. I look at exploration from the perspective of "I can spend an hour or two at this and come out the other side with a T1 Cruiser with a PVP fit". Level 4 missions are consistent, reliable, dependable income, if you capitalize on all your LP as well as salvage and loot the right stuff. Later, you'll want to go back to T2 Cruisers and do sites, but I've not got to the point where I feel like I can lose a 200m ship with t2 fit without feeling the hurt.
---
So, out of every 100 active players you do have 100 active titan accounts?
---
Why build one when you can build 50 tho?
---
Hello as the official Been Diplo I would like to say Sharo is a good lad a bit retarded, but a good lad. Please don’t slander the TMB name with this scandalous fake news. 
---
On the real Every newer Corp has growing pains and Beens expanded pretty quickly without a lot of the structure of the Corp hashed out that older ones normally have (in term of wh corps) they’ll get there eventually. I know people like poking fun at Steel for the shekle implosion but sometimes corps can’t make it past not having an identity and you had a lot of big personalities steel included that wanted different things. Let’s take some of the bigger corps as an example. hawks as a Corp roleplay as dirty blobber triangle ships while they wonder where their content is. HK likes fighting at zero on fortizars with caps on grid. Novac is stuck using 2017 tactics. The new comer AFK is on that Rev and :B:indi SB stuff. 
---
How will Beens come out? They’ve shown they want to succeed and when they get their Corp identity sorted, hash out their doctrines, and train up their fcs they be okay 
---
Also

Hey I was in that fleet with you last night. I’ll probably buy a vexor or VNI with mining money and go back to ratting with that since the NBI ratting ship is kind of weak. You can also use the mining time to get your ship or drone skills up.
---
Update. Zoryas are everywhere now that majors are out.
---
Can you teach me?
---
Sorry but nothing you say can be taken seriously with a name like that.
---
so am I, I will start by finishing the dark series before moving to different fillaments though.
---
Ratting scales pretty well - start with an Algos -&gt; Vexor/VNI -&gt; Rattlesnake -&gt; Carrier -&gt; Super, Carrier/Super ratting is some of the best Nullsec ISK in the game, there's even more ISK to be made in Wormholes - you can make a theoretical 2B/hr multiboxing dreads in a C5, though that's endgame ISK making.
---
Totally reasonable. Even if it s only a brown manpussy.
---
Look into incursions.   Large fleet pve engagements.  Big payouts plus Concord lp.
---
Warp2me incursions is a good place to start.  They have alpha compatible fits listed on their website.
---
When I was new I lost every isk I made in faction warfare fights.  I still like to do that but I can now afford to.
---
I'm pretty sure we've been over this on praisebob, but i've been using this name so long that changing at this point is just too much effort.
---
touche
---
So you completely just dont understand the issue at all.
---
Where send new players then ? 
---
I never seen a small groups that where great for new players as often these groups expect a level of independence that is outside of new players there ability.
---
Cheers man :D
---
The future of the game...who knows.  
---
I am part of the Imperium.  
---
What ever happens to the game, I am confident that our leadership will work hard to help the members enjoy the parts of the game they enjoy.  
---
As to the big picture...who knows.  I expect some group of people will get big and strong enough to push our stuff in again.   They will not do this though by QQing about how the game is broken, but by getting big and strong enough to do the work.  It’s the nature of being a big target (and a Goon).  
---
In the end though, our little group has proven itself to be strong and resilient and able to regroup.
---
150-300m/hr is carrier/super/rorquals which isn't realistic for a new player, with a VNI it's more like 35hrs/month, maybe 40.
---
Isn't everybody at this point?
---
Pancake brain explains it well. Thank
---
Beta client?
---
Nobody said that POS's ruined content.
---
If you're expanding a group of accounts, usually the accounts in there are going to not matter quite as much--so a complex, multi-word seed (GrrGonsHatGonsDredditIsRecruiting) that you can remember is a good enough way to go. Think about wormhole seeds, dedicated cyno alts--doesnt hurt that much to lose. Probably the only exception to that rule is going to be mass skill farms with access to a common extractor bin, or if you're a nutty multiboxer who needs to input broadcast login. And you're paranoid enough.
---
In that case alternatively just make a new random seed for new batches of accounts. If there are enough that it matters, you probably numbered those accounts anyway (skillfarm0231) and when you save your seed on the device side just call it something appropriate (key for skillfarms 0200-0250). If you're IBing or launcher batching logins then this is still compatible as you can batch the auth on that key.
---
Make the cost granular. You pay for omega character slots, and then you pay for training/login slots on top of that. $5 for omega slot, $10 for training/login slot. Both ccp and players benefit.
---
Fact, black bears are the best bears
---
the meaning of that quote is bad just really really bad, oh my lord :(
---
Ya agreed. It was a magnetar though. So while huffing gas on our alts, our tengus were pumping out 1099 dps with javelines loaded. Normally, with no effect, I would been like fuuuuuuuuuuuck that. The c3 as a base is pretty trash to live in as we had it fully farmed with 3 people in a few hours, so we take what we can get right now. But its decent isk for a few guys to start and makes a decent farm hole to keep in the back pocket.
---
We're literally doing what OP suggested. Taking the not so desirable space, and building up into something more desirable. Sure everyone has their own ideas on how they want to start, but ideas arent worth shit until someone gets out there and does it.
---
No. What eve needs is fewer 1000 titans blobs, or even 500 titan blobs or better yet titan blobs fewer than 10 at most.
---
Excavator Rorqs and injector farms (these should probably be accelerators so CCP can control the rate) are big factors as well, yeah.
---
Small areas was promised with Fozzie SOV but it just got worse.
---
What static do you have? I'd honestly suggest biting the bullet and moving to C2 with C3/HS Statics - it's some of the best space for newbie WH corps.
---
Also, if you haven't already, join the praisebob discord server, all major WH alliances have people in there.
---
That way with bots you can be protected 24/7 !
---
it was a fun brawl, I finally got to use my haw dread for like 20 seconds.
---
yeah sorry should have mentioned it, but i took all the boxes.  
---
I was hoping that the "Most time spend in the sites was waiting on mtu to be done. " would have been enough to clarify that.
---
Protostar batphoned us once...
---
We are not a goon Sig confirmed. Nice promotion
---
If you use any 3rd party sites that key you into the eve api via the eve sso,  (Like if you link your account to zkill) then you should use 2FA. 
---
You should also use 2FA if you use your email password anywhere else, or if you dont have 2FA on your email. 
---
If you have your credit card saved on your account to auto-bill you, you should use 2FA. 
---
Basically you should use 2FA, otherwise you need to be super paranoid and carefull at all times.
---
Its not about how important you are or whatever. They will clean you out, use your credit card to RMT a bunch of plex, and lock you out of your eve account regardless. Its just not worth it.
---
Hey if it works :shrug:
---
This was posted right after the brawl in Barleguet last night, which was SF/IA/Friends vs Snuff/Wangs/Friends. Snuff’s side won and there was no tidi, hence the title/meme.
---
That was one hell of a fight, thanks for showing up!
---
The stiletto landed at range and Bjorn noticed it was perfect MJD range.  Stiletto cloaks and Bjon MJD's on top of him decloaking him.
---
Whatever's clever. I run Hobgoblins, Warriors, and 5 salvage drones. Use whatever tank skills you have. It can fit either. You're just using it for lvl 2 missions. The goal here is to increase rep. Rep means lvl 3 missions and discounts on market fees.
---
probably because being a friend of goons doesn't mean they have access to indy structures?
---
Considering the gangbusters mobile games are making, I'm sure it's a "grin and bare" type of situation. CCP taps into some of that delicious Asian mobile games market cash, which they can use to (hopefully) make Project Nova not suck utter donkey schlong.
---
Can you teach me the fitting and strategy? This sounds fun.
---
differently from apple stock you can't rip rigs off and liquidate them, so no it has nothing to do with stocks not even at the most basic level.

Pay for omega with your real money if you want it. You will burn out so fast trying to do it with an alpha account. Or just stay alpha and have fun.
---
Got a link to PM me for the discord?
---
It's a c3 WR with a LS static (which is why I *had* a fessor). Just dumped a rat with some fuel down, nothing major.
---
The c2's we found are in high demand and are generally occupied (havent found low power structures to clear or empty systems yet). I do have my eye on a c4 black hole with c4/c3 static that may work well. Theres some shit going on in there though that I'm watching play out first.
---
i had the same after dt, restating the launcher fixed it
---
only 70% percent of the playerbase nothing to worry about
---
&gt;fewer than 10 at most
---
You can't put the genie back in the bottle.
---
lm doing the same thing but 100 of each tier and type just to see what/now much loot l can get in my spare time lol
---
this concept is a relic from when plex prices were about 10% of what they are today. It is realllly good advice to pay for omega and use isk earned to enjoy your playtime. spending all that time grinding isk (only top end is fast enough these days, think rorq or super pve) just to have it disappear into subscription every month just isnt worth while.
---
les voix* de bob 
---
FTFY
---
Actually not a bad idea (I can't believe I said this). I would add a few more systems and moons, though. It's not that hard to hit a wall fairly quickly. 
---
I doubt it will work, though. Someone will decide they just have to own all the shitty space in the pockets.
---
its unBEElieveable.
---
&gt; Changing anom respawns doesn't hurt goons
---
Contrary to the koolaid you're drinking, none of this is about "hurting Goons". It's about balancing n+1.
---
&gt; It hurts everybody else.
---
Because obviously it's the small alliances cramming 35k accounts in a single umbrella, making the best use of infinite anomaly spawns. You are parroting official narratives, but they don't make sense here.
---
&gt; we choose to play with each other and understand the history of what's happened to our coalition 
---
No. 2/3 of your memberbase don't care about your tribe-creating narratives or history. They are there to risk freely farm and get rich. The narratives aren't even accessible to the non-Western people, the Russians, the Chinese, which make a great portion of the 35k. It's mainly the American playerbase who cares about that kind of sense of belonging.
---
&gt; you want CCP to stop us from associating with other
---
No. I argue people to be motivated to spread out their farm activity by game mechanics. People can do whatever they want, blue whoever they want.
---
&gt; you seem to think that goons have done something so completely bad 
---
No. Again, this is part of the koolaid you're being spoonfed by your leaders. They do it to create a unified tribe. But it's koolaid in the end. As I said, the only "bad" thing Goons do is producing and spreading that koolaid, and when this particularly cockblocks game balance discussions (like right now). Nobody can blame anyone for ingame decisions. I don't want to "hurt Goons". I don't "hate Goons". I don't want to "see Goonswarm collapsed". I am a whaler who whales in the richest whaling environment of this game. And I noticedd some game balance issues so I am running for CSM to help CCP to address those issues. But they are game issues, not Goon issues. The fact that Goons benefit from those doesn't make the mechanics balanced.
---
&gt; you've stated that you just want to burn it all down
---
Where? Rn I'm not even sure you are producing or consuming the koolaid here.
---
1
---
&gt; Dont go around trying to fuck everyone else's lives and organizations
---
This game needs anti-N+1 measures to regain ecosystem balance. If you think my proposals would fuck your organization (I don't for the record, I think you'd do just fine) then perhaps you should adapt like  you've been telling to others for 4 years now.
---
I think a lot of people have been in the same position, asking the same question. In my case i trained a frigate to 5 and soon after i found i could do covert ops/bombers, interceptors, assault frigates etc. allowing me to spend my days in eve in a variety of ways. I wouldn't think to carefully about what you should be doing. Have fun in the game and these questions will answer themselves.
---
Yeah citadel mechanics are so fucking broken it made the game less fun for everyone.
---
CCPlease  fix it asap
---
sad to see all the people sucking up to snuff, not like they have enough already rite
---
Goons helped birth TEST at the time, plus SMA, FCON, WIDOT, etc.... they were always bigger it was 20k+ members in the coalition since the invasion of fountain for TEST.
---
If I am using one key for my skillfarm and don't record it anywhere I will never be able to add more to the skillfarm without redoing every key to a new seed, that is the issue with what you suggest. And if I number each key differently then I might as well let ccp randomly assign since the point here is to use one key for all of them.
---
this 100%. 
---
IMO should go back to having structures anchored on moons only, and tie their invuln timer and damage caps to system/region ADMs.
---
Sometimes you just have to muscle in and take a system for yourself  - if you find a C2 with C3/HS statics and the corp in there isn't an obvious alt corp and is fairly pvp-inactive evict them from the hole, other groups may come help you if needed.
---
Hope use enjoy :)
---
Would have been nice to know that context, thanks :)
---
This is a lot of words to say we need harder to reach space for botting.
---
Steve, please just ignore this idiot who doesn't seem to "get it".
---
Account security is a big deal and you have my thanks (among countless other people, I'm sure) for making this important issue one of the things you've focused on.
---
Additionally, thanks for all the neat market and industry tools :)
---
Fact: you are retarded
---
someone always will get the short end of the stick. 
---
 I also don't understand why, for example, the RU / RU timezone is bad for the defender.  This is a pretty piss poor chart.   It seems to be making assumptions in the first chart and then ignoring them in the second?
---
1. No, you can putz around for awhile, maybe months as alpha but you will want to subscribe to enjoy more of the game. Spending a little real money in the game is nice to buy stuff that's expensive, dont want to, then work for the expensive stuff. 
---
2. This game gets so much better, fun, and rewarding when working with others. 
---
3. The best deal to start is the steam starter pack.
---
Another eve will die thread?
---
How hard would it be to get support for U2F?
---
Being able to trigger an invasion anywhere would be broken. More than just the hubs. If we learned anything from citadel's, all of Eve would soon be in a perminant state of invasion.
---
No, if you *must* use one key for your entire skillfarm with arbitrary expansion then use a suitably complex multi-word string (e.g. SkillFarmingMakesMeWantToEatBuckshot) as the seed that you can remember. It's not "as good" but markedly better than literally nothing or an easily compromised seed.
---
Or if you must write it down, write it down physically and keep it somewhere safe and unlabeled as what it is.
---
Think of this seed as your second password that you never type (so no direct keylogging). Just dont make it super easy like "12345" or your email/birthday/password. We all have retarded password practices that are applicable here, the key is to just not be too retarded.
---
How would it return to the normal sec status? Would all of Eve eventually be triglave npc null?
---
voix : voices, talk you can hear, like shit french talk in vocal
---
voies : ways, routes, passages, holes... where bob use to guide us all
---
The title of the video means both, voices and ways.
---
You can, that’s why aircraft carriers travel with support battle groups and every sci-fi film shows big ships with support in case someone shoves a torpedo down its exhaust port.
---
I think the problem is more that people skilled and bought titans expecting to have the current version of Titans and the salt that would flow from making them less oppressive would be spectacular. We saw what happened when the relatively mild rorq nerf hit. 
---
Ccp has two options. Balance changes to upset the meta and upset people. Do nothing and risk a  serenity endgame and watch eve become a consensual pvp hello kitty online with nothing more relevant than arranged skirmishes to keep line members happy.
---
You couldn't kill it with your bazillion batphones when you tried, nor were you invited by the agressors to join the party, so you had to settle to whore and killboard pad. Gj!
---
I am beginning to wonder if that’s what they were suppose to be but someone got cold feet.
---
step 5 : get contracted a new hull for free shortly after
---
I have thought about doing a 100 but as i saw the low income from the T1 i figured 50 would be enough for a data set, Now I most probally need to run more T1's over time to get more filaments.  
---
But mostly I wish you luck with those 100 :)
---
&gt;OR significant access to any corp assets or privileges
---
Reason why I wish directors should know if a character is protected by 2FA or not.
---
That's not true. You can make changes that benefit smaller groups and give bigger groups a penalty, the only thing is you have to implement them.
---
What you could do is start a new character, do the tutorial and start again; with time you can buy (with isk or real money) skill extractors, drain your old char and inject all that SP into your new one or sell it for isk (or both).
---
You'll lose some SP in the transition, but I think it would be worth it.
---
On mobile. What's the isk price on that fit?
---
Bombers and goku/stuka fleets are common.
---
you never seen them maybe, because you never had a reason to search for them or to learn to know them. there are tons of small corps out there, that are excellent for newbies. like mine e.g. but who cares about a 20man wh corp... 
---
Almost every halfway established alliance has good opportunities for newbies to get into the game, and most groups I know are glad there's new blood from time to time.
---
It's up to everyone himself of course if he's willing to take some time to look out for a group that suits him. That's not your job, obviously. But I see enough people complaining about Imperium or blue blobs and then sending 9/10 recruits they encounter to Karmafleet/Horde/Brave. That's kind of paradox to me.
---
And independance is not a skill, it's an attitude. I disagree with you there.
---
How big is the timezone difference between ChinaTZ and AUTZ? Or RUTZ and ChinaTZ? Could we get a legend of what each timezone is represented here in +-GMT?
---
Last I heard they werent outside its defense range, you guys stripped it of most of its valuable modules then left it to die, didnt even man it to defend it.
---
Now see that’s interesting since based on zkill and the BR tool shoot first and iron had more people.
---
That's good to know. I'd hate to respec to a new meta
---
lm just doing it for the fun l dont mind wasting time, lm not init for the money just for the fun of the pve content lol
---
You can't use medical clones, but you can store clones with implants.
---
I like that they need to be scanned down, and I think the besieged covert sites should be too. Only because it's extremely easy for someone to deny sites by triggering the timers and warping out. If there is one of those trolls in your lowsec area, you'll never get to run any of those sites.
---
ship and fit are about 1.2 bill.
---
I mean they were meant to be anti-capital. But they ended up to be not a real solution to the capital menace yet pretty good vs subcap fleets.
---
So much salt
---
Wrong way. Move to a 4 static 4/3.
---
Yeah I know, but still for the sake of my sanity I’ll take the slightly less secure option
---
With all due respect:
---
Go Fuck Yourself.
---
My thought was time the structure to when it is used the most.  Track docking, undocking, services, etc.
---
A link to a link to a link to a link.

&gt; killing consistently 2-3 dreads and a bs per dread lost
---
&gt; wow guys we are losing too much gotta bring in 20 titans!!!
---
sure sounds like snuff all right
---
But is it obvious obvious or just obvious?
---
The Quafe conspiracy is why Starsi isn't a winner.
---
4 static 4-3 is better for PVP through the 4 but makes logistics harder when you don't have a K-Space (and never get non-frigate K-Space roamings)
---
Send them nowhere? Let them do their own thing and not be a another +1. This attitude of "join x" gives the game this stagnation we have as everyone just gets bigger and no new possible enemys arrive.
---
you cant, they're dead....
---
Gg les copains !
---
Is there an in-game channel for trading PLEX on private contracts?
---
That bad eh? Cash me undocked
---
IMHO, Nova needs a similar mechanic as Eve in order to promote the "ships are just ammo" mentality. Death needs to really matter.
---
One way they could do this is to have the different "classes" represented in different jumpsuits. The jumpsuits function like ships in eve - you can equip add-ons (modules) to them and if you die, the jumpsuit is destroyed along with a random number of add-ons. (The rest are dropped on the map as loot.) This will both stay true to Eve itself without needing to fully link the two games and will have people play a bit more cautiously than other shooters.
---
It's fairly approximate and there is some overlap (Russia for example covers three timezones if you consider the geography of the country but when referring to RUTZ its normally considered that you are discussing moscow time) and a lot of bleed into each others timezones.
---
EVE-time I would approximate - give or take an hour -
---
06:00-12:00 - AUTZ
---
10:00-15:00 - China
---
14:00-19:00 - RUTZ
---
18:00-23:00 - EU
---
23:00-06:00 - USTZ
---
Certainly open for debate.
---
&gt; What's the landscape like right now?    
---
It's portrait.    
---
&gt; Alliances, meta, any good wars going on right now, etc...

[[NER] The 1900 News on Tuesday 11th June](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bzgqlk/ner_the_1900_news_on_tuesday_11th_june/)

Do it. Don't let your memes be dreams.

&gt; Stealth bombers still hot?

Yes. Bombers Bar and Spectre Fleet are still alive and well. And each of the big null blocs have their own bomber group.     
---
&gt; At least fuck me up with memes and propaganda. Energize me fuckers.    
---
Be the change you wish to see.
---
And is less secure.
---
would you agree with that most small groups that are willing to accept new players are well bad in terms of teaching ? 
---
If so given most new players don't have the tools to check if a corp is good there selection is gonna be random this means for a majority of new players they are gonna get a bad experience from the game ( and likely end up quitting ). 
---
Now sure the subreddit could likely build a list of small corps that can take new players the issue is they would end up being big rather quickly, leading to the same problem as exists right now.
---
Thanks for the reply, don't I need 5.5m sp to be able to use an extractor on the character?
---
4.4m SP isn't a particularly large amount, it represents around 3 months of training (though that could be significantly higher or lower depending on implants and re-maps). Starting a fresh character isn't a bad idea, particularly if you want to change your name. After the tutorial missions I'd recommend joining a new player corp such as EVE University or Brave. They will be able to teach you the game and hep prevent you from getting lost in the weeds that are EVE mechanics.
---
Your character isn't worth much on the bazaar unfortunately. Skill injectors are generally a better value then buying characters on the bazaar in general, and with 5m SP being the alpha cap it is very easy to make a character with such low SP for yourself anyways. You should probably just keep it around as if you get deep into EVE you will likely want an alt eventually, and an old character is better then starting from scratch. Maybe just train him as an alpha for now while playing on a new main.
---
File this under things that are good for goonswarm.
---
Yeah if RU / RU is defender bad, that means at max form both sides then defender loses the fight.
---
However if that's the case then with citadel mechanics why does a timezone matching attacker not have a similar advantage over a defender? 
---
Even if the idea is that the timer is changed to a non-RU time zone but then it'd be both sides fighting on their back foot--but that doesn't make much sense to suddenly assume the defender has an upper hand either except at the very small scale (8 or less imo), where the constant power of the citadel on grid is enough to tilt in favor of the defender despite an inherent formup disadvantage.
---
Any tool/application which implements the same protol as google authenticator works. To my knowledge, the protocol is TOTP described in [RFC 6238](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238) with SHA1. I just learned that Steam guard uses the same protocol, but it uses it's own set of characters to render the decimal number.
---
Need to format your post a little better, i thought you meant AUTZ was 10:00-15:00
---
Don't gotta worry about Nova not sucking, it was canceled.
---
&gt;and mobile games are just the next respectively current generation of brainless effortless instacontent nomeaning crap, that nobody needs, but everybody wants apparently
---
Mobile games just happen to be a much bigger market than PC. Not tapping into that would be ridiculously stupid.
---
CCPlz U2F!
---
That's what I'm looking at now. Will be an upgrade to what we have now. Regardless, as long as my guys are taken care of (reason for quickly expanding beyond the c3) and everyone is having fun, we can settle for *less* optimal space while we grow and set our eyes on more risky ventures. Meaning for the time at least, we may have to roll a few holes to get a good route or ratting window.
---
havent you heard? shsro got bullied out of praisebob
---
about fucking time
---
He's back again as of about 6 hrs ago.
---
This, so much this. The issue is that an area that’s 1/75th the size of the entire map can sustain and provide for the isk generation needs of like 30% of the entire NS population is what’s wrong. That’d be like if you could pack 30% of the population of the United States in Utah and Utah suddenly started producing an infinite amount of food and resources. Every other state would never be able to compete with it.
---
uhhh k. 
---
why on earth would anybody drop 60 HAW titans on subcapitals when HAW dreads significantly cheaper and do significantly more damage with haw guns?
---
titans are a force multiplier for capital engagements, for subs youre more likely to see supercarriers on the field.
---
The issue with sending new players nowhere is that they likely end up disliking the game and leaving. 
---
Like the majority of times new players are pointed to a corp because solo eve isn't exactly a fun experience .
---
Imagine actually being in Beans.
---
POS timers were never satisfying content. Oh, how quickly they forget.
---
The 3 will give plenty of kspace connections. 3-3s, 2-3s are very common
---
Guys I’ve come to the conclusion that CCP will not fix all the issues before we give up on the game so I’ve made the decision to stop playing and giving them money.
---
Member peak Barleguet fun? I member!
---
That is the base refine yield of the station without skills/implants/standings factored in. All NPCs stations have worse yields than any player refinery with a reprocessor.
---
We're going to widot and join the Imperium. It's the only logical choice
---
Yes you are. You cant do anything productive without Goons.
---
Doesn't high sec still have to have those empire permits to put structures down?  Or at the very least, that system should exist.  I gave thought to high sec proliferation, but yeah, that's much trickier.  I mean, a holding corporation could be required to hold standings at a certain level to maintain a structure in a space, and then make standings decay.  
---
Spitballing,
---
If a corporation holds a structure in high sec, then that triggers a decay of standings for that corp, which is actually doled out to the corp members.  If it decays below certain levels, you lose abilities on structures.  you could establish a low threshold : one free structure, one free of each structure, or a capital system where you can have a few more that don't count.  (which would tie into the war dec systems nicely).  Standings decay could have a multiplier for corp members, multiplier for alliance members, multiplier for structures held, and thusly 'balanced'.
---
Spam structures with OPC's.  Each one person would have to raise standings on that character.  Spam structures from one corp with few members : they have to do content to keep the standings high enough.  Spam structures from one corp with a lot of members :  few people would have the job of keeping standings up.
---
If a structure you own blows up, you lose standings proportional to the structures number of the corp.  (If under a war dec, higher or lower, would require theory crafting).  
---
Add items that drop in low sec that boost corp standings that spread out to the corpmates, for the purposes of boosting/content.  or not, probably abuseable.
---
Yes. 
---
If you change the way that a group is forced to farm, you change the way that their defenses for those farmers must work. Forcing a group to farm across 50 LY of space to sustain 10000 accounts instead of 5LY would be such a huge jump, and would seriously make it so much better
---
Perhaps, but the fact that they showed up without scanning meant you could search that many more systems for them in the same amount of time.  I had a route I used to regularly take, right near Genesis... Got some good money there, and great sight-seeing with the EVE Gate, and it was easy to run it in a covops gate to gate because no bubbles. 
---
Now that they must be scanned down,  it's better value for your time to go hunt them in NullSec, where you find maybe one ghost site to 10 relics. Where's the fun in that? Where's the thrill? I ran ghost sites when I couldn't find any PvP, and wanted an adrenaline rush, because they were so easy to find even though you might get only 1 per 10-20 systems
---
I love how salty everyone is. This is gonna be fun.
---
Well maybe if their shiny new toy wasn't the absolute be-all end-all solution to any subcap they wouldn't throw it at everything with an engine. There's nothing wrong with cap brawls, have fun with them. But don't try and explain away the fact that supers make subcaps obsolete in k-space, and as long as fighters and HAWs apply better than subcap fleets this will remain the status quo.
---
Yup, this is the only correction needed on the BR  
---
Excellent fight Iron/Shoot First!
---
Exploration is often what newbies do. The isk is very nice and you get lot of opportunities to meet people who want to spend time with you.
---
I have been bitten by this. CCP, this is a mini bugfix/feature area that would make the alpha-&gt;omega return less painful!

tbh basically anything is better than G Auth. so many tools store your 2fa keys in the cloud, and so many of them are actually pretty damn good
---
Curious logic
---
Will sleepers kill a MTU, mobile depot and other similar small anchorables?
---
now that's a good question. CCPls
---
Yet no one from PL is stunting solo anymore, waddup with that?
---
Small alliances live in NPC Null. Sovereignty doesn't serve any purpose for a smaller group. In addition, NPC stations in Null (NPC null) Help foothold small groups within areas of null as it would be near impossible to evict them without lengthy and pointless campaigns.
---
Power blocs capture space not only for themselves, but to deny other people from using it, or turn it into renter space. The same thing will apply here.
---
Define productive. If youre talking about taking sov against serious powers, maybe so.
---
Even a fun roam's productive... Because of its nature. I take out INIT roams all the time, and we get pretty decent kills like this: https://zkillboard.com/kill/76980207/
---
Yes we do welp, but it's clean fun.
---
I can't see the difference between a new player leaving the game or joining a null powerblock. If he leaves the game he is gone. But if he joins a null block he is just another person that get taught how to krab and he will do nothing else. He won't be good addition for the game where null is full of krabs anyway.
---
GPU will always run high it’s meant to run 85-95% almost all the time when gaming. Now if it’s cpu that is a different case. For gaming it should be about 15-25% of cpu should be allocated to the game.  If you can and haven’t yet switch to the 64 bit client it will run a little smother than the 32 bit.

You dont need to hold sov in low sec. Nobody is going to do the anoms.
---
Damn, my bad, I didn't pay attention to your ammount of SP in the old character, I thought it was higher.
---
In that case start over and keep the old one for later... a second account and alts are really useful once you get into the game.
---
The Spoopy Newbies thing is interesting, I'll check that out. Thanks.

1. What would wormhole combat look like?
---
2. What would you say are requirements I should aim towards (ISK, ships, experience, skills) to be accepted into a wormhole corp?
---
3. How would I go about getting into lowsec combat? FW?
---
4. What fittings/skills should I use for an Alpha account for optimal ISK profits? (Frigate, I have no race-specific skills trained yet)
---
5. After I have more ISK, what type of ship should I aim to use in wormholes? IDk what kind of combat playstyle I would enjoy, preferably something support or long-range fire.
---
Check out Roedyn1 on youtube, he's great
---
Sure!
---
**Fit**
---
Here is the fit. My aim was to make a fit that was as cheap as running a single site, so you could make back the loss by one successful run. **This fit only works in T1 Electrical**.
---
It should cost around 8million if you buy at Jita. Each site makes between 4million and 20million and averages at 10million ([data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR1KAWcspqh92-Fa2VsPSnpHaXMWd6frM9I-GXNfc8OyQTtShTs2K06S_Ma38LlNqfhJUtlLogvbasx/pubhtml?gid=0&amp;single=true)). It's not terribly ISK/time efficient and was more just an personal challenge. :)

**Skills**
---
Most skills I have are all L3 except small energy turret and weapons upgrades which are 4 (for both fitting and heat sink II). As your fitting skills improve you can swap the AB for an enduring AB for more cap, and the vestment reconstructors for T2 repairers.
---
You need some rigging skills (armor/energy) to L3 but if you don't have them you can use the remaining rig for fitting. You can put some other rig in there if you want instead, it's harder to put another weapon/armor in there as the fitting is very tight.
---
**Tactics**
---
Use Multifrequency and orbit at 6k for all spawns except the Tessera drones, which you have to orbit at 20k and use Radio S for otherwise you die very quickly.
---
The max number of cap boosters I've used in a run is around 7, but I carry 14 just in case.
---
You might need to overheat a bit against the larger battleships just because you get close to running out of time. There typically isn't enough time to get any of the extra loot, just get the adaptive cache.
---
If you can't hit the smaller or faster moving ships then use "set at range 6k" or just "approach" to reduce your transversal, but only do this after your reactive armor hardener has fully hardened (should only take around 10 secs) as your incoming dps will increase.
---
If you get a Lucid Firewatcher (neuting) then it's very important you kill this fast, so overheat your guns and keep at range 6k for max dps.
---
Practice on sisi first!

reading it again, i think that the fact that defender gets to pick the day means that everything is now in favor of the defender?  Which, if true, means the whole diagram could have been shorted to that statement.

It would be fun for openings to new sov nullsec constellations to spawn in wormholes. These pockets are dilapidated remains of previous civilizations; as such, their gates no longer work, their structures are in ruins, etc., and must therefore be repaired and replaced by the new tenants. The malfuncting remains of these civilizations would constitute the ratting anons in these systems. As the TCU and iHubs are installed and upgraded and gates are repaired and/or replaced by player-owned gates, players are able to jump through and discover the next system and the next, until the constellation is fully known. The wormhole connections are not static, however, and so the tenants of this new sov null would, 1) have to be ready to move in and establish ownership quickly, and 2) be ready to defend themselves from whatever happens to come through their connections that day, as well as deal with the logistics of a hybrid wormhole/nullsec life.
---
I'm not proposing this as any sort of balance mechanism, though. The blocs would quickly dominate it just like everything else. I think it would be cool, though, if only because it would create a gold rush style of gameplay for a minute. Some new alliances might even be born out of it.
---
&gt;Found the Carebear?
---
That's exactly what it is. A carebear character to earn isk for funding pvp. The guy got killed. Everyone's giving him advice about how to not get killed. But getting killed isn't part of the problem, it's part of the game. He needs income. Skilling up to a vexor doesn't take that long, and isn't a waste of time. Neither is skilling up to a domi. Both are good ships, and the skills are useful for a lot of other stuff.  Lvl 4s in a Domi vs VNI Ratting, the domi is faster to skill, easier, safer, cheaper, and more reliable. Finally, this is intended to be an alt, not the main. It's not meant to be the best money. You're not going to be plexing using lvl 4 missions.
---
But good enough.
---
It would take a big cultural shift, a lot of new subscribing players, and a big crackdown on botting for plex to come down.
---
yes, that is correct, but that doesn't make them any better quality- or gameplaywise
---
I've seen this a few places (G Auth is "bad").  Can you ELI5 why G Auth is such a bad 2FA option?
---
Passive or active gila works well in electric or dark.  The Active performs well in electrical. The good part about darks is you can speed tank a bit better and and you save time picking up the loot. Gila is the gold standard for most pve content. Although the sacrilege is great for t4 darks if you have decent amarr and missle skills.
---
Most abyssal sites that I’ve failed haven’t been because I’ve died but because I’ve run out of time. Thus I think that darks are great because the speed bonus gives you more time. 
---
I’d also like to add that I’ve done a t3 electrical in a T1 omen with no bling. It was super tight but an absolute adrenaline rush and I made back the entire cost of the whole ship with one site. This is why I like abyssals; they are lucrative but also way more exciting than other pve stuff.

I really need to come up with a copy/paste for this question since it seems to come up every week now.  Eve can be anything you want it to be.  To be anything, you need money to make it something.  I will tell you right off the bat, manufacturing in high sec can be unforgiving.  That said, you can make isk doing it if you get the right plan together and it comes to fruition.  If you want to dabble in manu for a bit to see how you like it, rigs have a very cheap entry fee with a good profit margin/market movement.  Frigs/mods/ammo/drones are same but they generally have more competition depending on where you decide to set up shop.  PI is a good source of income if you find the right system combination/s.  High sec PI is the cheapest form that will yield isk incrementally.  You will not buy a titan via high sec PI though so dont get your hopes of filthy richness up.  It can work in conjunction with other indy stuff to bring in more isk (e.g. fuel blocks) if you organize things well.  Manu and PI are mostly afk activities.  You can do either/both fairly quickly via "set and forget" strategy and just drop by the system every so often to empty poco's or start manu jobs.  This leaves you time for an active isk making venture like missions/ratting/escalations/exploration/etc etc etc.  The most important thing to do early on is to get some form of stable isk income.  Figure that out, do it long enough to get good at it and then start looking at things that require higher investment/s or pvpblowthingsupfunnery.  Hope this helps in some way and good luck to whatever you decide to do. o7

Bullshit. Playing in Brave was absolutely fucking awful, in multiple ways in multiple places. I unsubbed for months at a time due to my experiences with them. Now that I play solo, I actually want to keep playing. Sov null blocs do not magically make the game fun for newbros. I don't know how this myth got started, I imagine it's just propaganda designed to feed the major alliances, but it's complete fucking nonsense.
---
if you're doing t1's/t2's you can solo them in a worm or AF (retribution/hawk)

and make much more than 27m per hour, risking much less. might be worth doing a data set for those as well
---
I don't much like the smell of the advanced supers concept, but like the idea of the super-killing subcap. A T3 BS with a doomsday-like module that can only be fitted if you have a subsystem installed that has the right kind of high slot, which also reduces your scan resolution to the point where if you try to lock anything smaller than a super, you'll still be waiting at downtime? I'd train for that.
---
It will limit the possibility of instant escalation.       
---
Getting 3 dreads on your head is different than getting 3 titans.    
---
Lack of jump out from such space will also limit potential of utilizing this as super/titan construction as this lowsec gate will sooner or later cost you ship
---
My reddit skills are basic. Updated.
---
There's a bit of a false dichotomy about all these threads. POS mechanics, allowing the attacker to choose the time zone, are also bad, and that's not the right argument to get Upwell mechanics to change.
---
Defenders being able to set a time zone is fair enough - losing a structure because the attackers reffed it for 5am on a Tuesday is a lot worse than being unable to attack a structure because the defenders tanked it to 5am. The problem with Upwell structures is (i) they are so spammable, and unlimited in a system, (ii) the vulnerability window is too small (it should be at least 12h), and (iii) the defenders get to choose the day, so they only actually have to play the game one day in seven, and clearing up spam because really hard.
---
That doesn't require a stront-like system where attackers choose the time, though. It requires (i) removing the ability for defenders to choose the day, instead the armour-to-hull time is calculated like the shield-to-armour one; (ii) probably removing a timer from medium structures, allowing low power ones to be cleaned up without a ref timer at all; (iii) allowing some stuff stored in the structure to drop (after all, POSs dropped 50% of everything); and (iv) widening the window for coming out of reinforcement and trying to put it close to when the attackers ref it.
---
A ship/station breaking apart, making the map smaller in chuncks. 
---
The ship/station could also sink into the ocean of a planet, decks getting flooded and players pushed toward the upper decks resulting in fights over only remaining rubber duck live-boat. 
---
Or ship/station being consumed by a storm of rogue nanites. 
---
Or within a hollow asteroid of a mining colony where doors to space are failing because of power outtages and blowing everything in the connected area out into space.
---
Or a station getting filled with gas by the Sansha over time - could add some PvE to it.
---
A colony on a planet that's getting bombarded from space and the bombardment closing into the center, or laying waste on random sectors of the map reducing the inhabitable zone over time.

There are lots of interesting scenarios to give players in teams or alone the motivation to fight.

Hi I can help you fuck snuff.

A cruiser-sized SB analogue, except it fits capital torps, and a special anti-cap bomb launcher with ammo that does negligible damage to anything smaller than a dread. Small sig and fast align so it's hard to catch for anything big and slow.

Yeah you can use any TOTP producer. I use my desktop as my second factor and use WinAuth, and transfer the key to other machines in a notebook if I need to. There are lots of apps to do this.
---
This isn't what made pos timing mechanics good.
---
What made pos timing mechanics good was that both parties had control over the timers. 
---
The initial default time would be set via stront. It would carry a default timer chosen for the enemy attacking in their prime so the timer would end in the defenders prime. Once the shields are under 50%, stront cannot be changed.
---
When attacked, the defender would remove stront to shorten the timer into the desired timezone. This creates a way that the defender can control the timer even when hit at a bad timezone. It's also manual and error prone and requires someone to be awake and paying attention. 
---
The bigger difference is that the attackers also control the timer. The timer is decided at when the tower goes under 50%. If an attacker keeps the shields under 50% but not reinforced, they can kite the time of the fight into the future. This gives an attacking force a way to shift a bad timer into a good one. The defender has the interesting counterplay options of deciding the attackers might kite and so setting the timer based on that, or in simply pushing the attackers off the tower and successfully defending it.
---
The downside to pos timing mechanics is one of time and manpower. The big organized groups with wide timezone coverage gain a major advantage over the smaller or single timezone groups. Upwells just say that the time is the time regardless of how many people you have staring at eve notifications. The timing mechanics were pretty good. Everything else was bad. I am not sure if a return to those would be good for the game or not though.
---
Tbh i rarely play anymore but i progress at the same rate. Skillpoint wise anyway.
---
Do it no balls
---
lol, ustz end more like 0400
---
Noone living in lowsec of noc nullsec wants any of that bullshit, we just want more content added to our area of the game and really old mechanics to be reworked to attract more people to our homes.
---
Nullsec isn't the end game, people need to understand that. There's plenty of room for alliances and corps to grow without being part of any blob or subject themselves to the boredom you guys have to endure with sov mechanics.
---
So please don't, just don't.
---
No, the chart is supposed to indicate that if an RU attacker, hits a POS in RU timezone, if that pos is max stonted, then the timer will exit at a bad time for RU players, i.e. 11:00. This gives a defender an advantage as they can let the pos naturally re-gen its shields and re-stront it unless the attacker can attack at 11:00.
---
It needed to be done. POS timer mechanics were good, but everything else about them was broken. Defenses made moot, reinforcement and kill times shorter than a siege cycle, broken unmaintainable code that made fixing them impractical.
---

1. Wormhole combat is similar to other areas of space. There's some cloaky ganking of explorers/miners and pveers (ganking PvE is much harder though, because the sleepers hit very hard) and some small fleet stuff. A lot of fighting is based around showing up in someone's system and then provoking them into attacking you. Some organized brawls, some evictions (attacking someone's structures to get to what's inside). Depending on the corp, you might have a nullsec connection so that means that you can go explore/attack into other people's territory, or a lowsec connection for small roams. A big difference is that you will much rarely get jumped by capitals or supercapitals. Reinforcements are harder to bring in, which can help or hinder you.
---
2. So for regular corps or Spoopy Newbies? For Spoopy Newbies, they don't seem to have a lot of requirements, they expect you to know how to scan, probe and navigate inside wormhole space. I suggest daytripping a few times to get an idea of what it's like. For regular corps, it depends on the corp. Some corps require 20-30m sp and the ability to bring in ships totalling a few billions (the corp I am currently in). Some demand pvp experience, but a lot of them don't mind teaching you either. If you can fit a T2 cruiser with T2 modules (including weapons), most corporations will consider you. Some will accept you much earlier, if you can fly a T1 cruiser with T2 modules (not T2 weapons). It really depends on what ship doctrine they use. You will likely need ISK in the 100s of millions or maybe a billion or 2. It depends on the corp.
---
3. Lowsec solo pvp is the easiest PvP to get into. Get some money so that you can buy and fit around 10 frigates (so around 100 mil). Fly them to an active lowsec space (look for contested systems in the Agency window for Faction Warfare), watch out for gamecamps. Using the probe window, warp to a Novice Complex and wait for someone to attack you. You'll quickly learn what ships to avoid and which ships to attack. T1 frigates are pretty common, so you should have some targets. Avoid Faction and Pirate frigates, you have no chance against them with a T1 frigate. You also don't need to be part of Faction Warfare to do this (being part of FW requires you to leave your corp or enlist your whole corp in FW). You will lose ships, you will kill ships. It's all part of the game. Brave might have a corp for Faction Warfare? That I'm not sure of.
---
4. Do the Career Agents if you haven't done them yet. They give you free ISK, free ships and modules. There are a couple things you can do. Exploration is probably the easiest skill-wise. You can train for a [Heron](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Heron), which is considered the best T1 exploration frigate (they're all pretty good though). Train all of the skills in the Scanning skills tree (the maximum you can get as an alpha takes about 2-3 days to train). Exploration is very swingy, you might hit the jackpot and get 500mil in an hour, but then only 5mil the next hour. Another good one is ninja gas huffing in a [Venture](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Venture/Fittings). It's a bit less ISK than exploration, but much more consistent. To make money doing combat usually requires Cruisers at the very least. By then, you'll hopefully know the game well enough and be well enough integrated in your corp that you won't need my help.
---
5. The ships you fly for PvP are usually determined by the ship doctrines that your corporation uses. Your corp might choose to go short-range and brawl or long range and kite depending on the situation. I'd ask your corporation what they recommend, it's probably going to be a cruiser or battlecruiser since they are the main type of ship used in wormholes. They might also put you in a tackle role (using Warp Scramblers or Warp Disruptors to prevent enemies from escaping), which is the easiest role to do skill-wise in pvp, usually done in a fast frigate.
---
Ready for invite

Nice video !
---
I'm working on the assumption that USTZ is usually propped up by their with their west coast players, happy to be proved wrong but the pacific TZ isn't that big until you get to Sydney prime.
---
Or you could just make the existing map have lots of these by nerfing the ability to project power everywhere with cynos.
---
This idea sounds superficially sensible but actually all you're doing is working around how broken capital projection is in Eve today, and since that's the source of a lot of other problems, why not go in and address that directly?
---
Rofl. Iron would only ever hit the cov astra when rote wasn’t formed. Every time rote formed, Iron and friends chickend the fuck out.
---
They would like to do it, but there are technical constraints holding them back for now.
---
So, not right now, but maybe some time in the future.
---
That might be the case, but my frigate  skills arent the greatest so for now it is outside my scope.  
---
but i'll keep it in mind for the future
---
The thing about Elite and SC is that they are not close to be similar to EVE Online, that's the thing. EVE is mainly alive because there is no similar game to it. In the same gender, you eventually have Albion Online who has similarities in terms of spirit and mechanics, but it's a totally different game.
---
I mean, Elite and SC don't have a player driven economy, they don't have a viable market, no production, no crafting, no buildable ships and marketed resources harvested by players to benefit other players. They don't have viable piracy, they don't have such a huge amount of activities that are ripe for players or player driven space.
---
The only reason why EVE is still alive in 2K19 is because there is no other EVE. If there was, EVE would be long forgotten, and this shows how retarded CCP is, because they have a game that somehow manages to keep people despite them doing the worst possible but still don't manage to do anything with it.
---
please let me have some of your stuff and isk
---
Still it's a colossal waste of time lmao.
---
You ARE going to get blown up in Eve, that's a fact.
---
BUT that doesn't mean you should resign your fate. Learn how you died, how that can be prevented in the future... *learn the game*. Unlike you, from the sounds of it.
---
And missioning is an absolute waste of time above all others. Incursions is mind-numbingly boring, but it provides good money at least, unlike missioning. Mining is shit money too, but at least mining is low-effort enough that you can multi multibox dozens of accounts on it, but missioning is right where you have to pay just enough attention that you can't multibox more than a couple.
---
Ratting is okay money, especially when done in Null with an alliance.
---
It's an affliction most commonly seen in nullsec residents (but present in all areas of space). They mine so much spodumain or other ore in their rorquals, that it disbalances their brain chemistry and they turn into drooling idiots who rely on their alliance leadership for any cognitive process more complex than pressing F1. It's sad to see, but unfortunately there is no known treatment.

Yeah, if you click the button in the top right hand corner you can run the Beta client 64bit version. If you can find it a quick google should get you there.
---
FWIW, with any Google-Authenticator 2FA, you can always show the 'secret' by using a QR app to decode and display the string.
---
Example:
---
otpauth://totp/Example:alice@example.com?secret=JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP&amp;issuer=Example
---
I maintain the 'secret' in the secure notes of my offline password manager, [Password Safe](https://pwsafe.org/), so I can reproduce the QR code later if necessary (e.g. backup device) using offline QR generator.
---
This also allows me to customize the labelling.

My sub expires at the end of the month. All in game assets are liquidated, I'm tempted to extract all my sp and make some random stranger's day.

I won't debate if it can feed a medium sized alliance, but the original post was about a small remote pocket for small alliances to grow. Isn't think NPC Null? I think OP is on the right track - we need some type of transitional space between fledgling group to Mega-coalition, but I just don't know how to manifest it.
---
Looks like even the basic version supports it too :D
---
A far option.
---
Yes, you have the best ideas surely not alt account, keep posting your wonderful plans on how to fix Eve.
---
The re-stronting mechanic is great, I fully agree with you. But i think most people miss the subtlety (and i tried to highlight it) of the 1 day 17 hours as a rather elegant game design solution to the 24hour all one server issue. It's not perfect, but it worked for the people who wanted to attack, and wasn't too punishing on an organised defender.
---
That, combined with the re-stonting and ability to kite timers with like you said knocking the shields to between 25% and 50% was pretty clever on reflection.
---
The system wasn't perfect, but but it gave tactical options to both sides which is what the current system lacks.
---
I don't really find the words to describe how stupid your idea is.
---
You don't need to add any systems, you need to keep capitals from having such an extensive reach. Shorten their reach, and people will consolidate. 
---
Or don't, your choice. If you don't, then all the people people drop on with supers and such won't be there, so you've got nothing to drop on you useless wankers.
---
nah mate, I'm paying bloody 10$ per year for that feature :kappa:

---
Good luck in that serp 6/10 in your tengu, idiot.
---
Yeah I worded this badly - my point is its not optimal for the defender to form that early, but it is more in the favour for the defender than the attacker by default if no one shows up. It forces a battle of willpower that is fairly balanced rather than 100% defender sided.
---
_don't_ come up with a key. Make it completely random. An ideal option is to use the first one CCP gives you. You don't need to give them one, after all :D

And feel free to write it down. a piece of paper is remarkably difficult to hack ;) Just keep it somewhere safe.

The _better_ option is to stick it in a password safe like Keepass, where it's protected behind a password and encryption.

It’s a meme disease that effects people who spend a lot of time mining spodanium, to the point where it infects their brain and prevents them from doing anything but mining.

What I want to know is if getting all the wall boxes plus the main box in T3 is more isk/hr than running higher tiers where you can only get the main box. Those building materials in the wall boxes are worth a lot these days.

You can always retrieve the seed for your authenticator on an account, by logging in hitting the display qr code link. It's the key listed under the image.

i agree with your assessment and the underlying point of the differences between pos and cit mechanics making life easier for the defenders.  Just saying that the charts are butt.
---
Only thing that'll happen is snuffed out and other hunter groups will just own it and harras anyone who uses the stuff

It's clear you are living in a WH, which wasn't intended, which is one of the top five safest things to do in eve, and you wouldn't be there without your special snowflake heavy interdiction mod that lets you continue to use an exploit to close the smallest WHs. 
---
You WHers are a sorry, risk adverse bunch. Don't bring BPO into WH! Don't fly without checking sigs! Don't stash everything in WH! Complain on reddit anytime anything shows up that threatens our safety nets! Stay on reddit and shitpost on how awesome WH is!
---
Correction it was the athanor we killed, but we didn't finish hitting your astra because you wouldn't form to fight us for the athanor, so we literally packed up and deployed elsewhere less than two days after this: https://zkillboard.com/kill/76049370/

Unfortunately not easy. The question has been raised by the third party community a fair time back :D

There's a technical issue standing in the way at the moment. It may be fixed, but no timescale.

The problem is, you’re alpha now, so you can’t have a skill queue longer than 24 hours + 1 skill. As soon as you tried to update it then that alpha restriction kicks in and it drops off the rest of your skill queue
---
Solved by rebooting client one more time
---
I'm thinking about something, since I have a really low download rate and I'm going to my grandmother this weekend and she have an amazing one, should I download the whole client at her place?
---
But first we need a lowsec gate to Stain
---
Good Luck
---
&gt; Defenses made moot
---
Same for citadels if the attacking force is overwhelming.
---
&gt; reinforcement and kill times shorter than a siege cycle
---
Minimum amount of reinforcement and kill times regardless of the dps brought in
---
&gt; broken unmaintainable code that made fixing them impractical
---
Fair but doesn't make citadels any better when it comes to OP's argument
---
There's no way to backup the keys in google authenticator. So if you lose your phone, there's no simple way to get them back. 
---
Authy, for example, has a backup to the cloud option. It encrypts it on your phone, and you can easily install it on a new one. (give it your phone number, it sends a message to verify, give it the password to decrypt the backup, and it's back :D) You can also get it onto other devices quickly. Like a chrome plugin. (again, give it your phone number, approve the request on your phone, and give it the password)
---
Why not fix current Sov Nullsec? We don't need to completely destroy LS.
---
No no no no no no. Some of us low seccers have escaped to low sec to get away FROM sov. Don't bring that shit to us! Also FW mechanics are already similar in certain regards to sov null.
---
DON'T BRING THAT FOZZIE SOV CANCER TO OUR FREE SPACE
---
Don't stop... I'm almost there.
---
&gt; So you completely just dont understand the issue at all.
---
I think that you are alone in having an issue.  You'll have to explain.
---
This already exists and is called Faction Warfare.
---
&gt; Same for citadels if the attacking force is overwhelming.
---
Not true, only true-ish for citadels when using a specific fleet doctrine capable of outranging them. The citadel defenses are certainly effective at forcing attackers to engage at long range. POS defenses can generally just be ignored.
---
&gt; Minimum amount of reinforcement and kill times regardless of the dps brought in
---
This is the design. So the defender has a minimum amount of time to respond.
---
There are multiple people that run buyback services in Goons and they all pay like 94% jita, all of them do free pickups at any location that has a safe cyno beacon.
---
To add for a little details: Third party sites shouldn't be getting your password. And you should always be checking the url you go to (should be login.eveonline.com). But no-one's perfect, and it only takes one site being compromised to make a login which was ok into a malicious one. And you just need to miss it once.
---
&gt;  and you wouldn't be there without your special snowflake heavy interdiction mod that lets you continue to use an exploit to close the smallest WHs.
---
I mean, we could still close the holes, it would jjust mean we had more alpha clone alts for suicide rolly...
---
&gt; risk adverse bunch
---
Depends on the group
---
&gt; Don't fly without checking sigs
---
Generally we keep home hole clear of non-WH sigs anad outside of home WH that's rarely, if ever, followed
---
&gt;  Don't stash everything in WH
---
"Don't stash absolutely everything in a citadel when there's no asset safety" 
---
&gt; Complain on reddit anytime anything shows up that threatens our safety nets!
---
You mean when CCP tried to fuck us over with the HIC changes?
---
&gt; which is one of the top five safest things
---
Lmao, super ratting, carrier ratting, ship spinning/Station Trading, Hisec L1-4 mission running and K-Space data sites are all safer, but hey, who cares about facts in here...
---
That cerb is monstrously overtanked; I get why you took it but a mwd fit probably would have cut your clear time down since MTUs are slow.
---
Thank you very much!
---
It sounds like what you're really trying to achieve could be achieved by nerfing capital ship jump range to the point where you need to use regional gates to cross regional boundaries in Carriers, Supercarriers and Titans. In my opinion you could take it further and need to use constellation gates too for Titans and Supers, depending on the distance between constellations.
---
I haven't looked at the numbers, but you'd probably need to change fatigue again to make this reasonable.
---
&gt; ‘Mentally Uninsured’
---
I think I dated his sister, ‘Mentally Unstable’.
---
thats fucking stupid. Atleast you had the ability to own a slice of sov after WWB. the entirety of eve was on a march to erase goons and once the good fights were over and enough damage was done they let you be. they didnt camp your members indefinitely with a superfleet.
---
mittens choses to have this hate boner over ncpl when litteraly a bunch of tendy bois in lowsec got pissed over the viceroy program,( and for a while you *blued snuff*!!). the tendy bois dunking you  was the catalyst for WWB. not ncpl being "bullies".
---
let the hate boner die so atleast one group can go toe to toe somewhat to your overfarmed armada and not make this server serenity
---
Disagree. Send them to Brave. Catch standing fleet has been a little thin lately. I need more newbros to absorb gunfire for me.
---
Try the 64bit client?
---
Anyone that tells you it's "Pay to Win" is wrong!
---
It's more like "Pay to make yourself feel better that you have caught up to players that have been playing for years, except you will still get dunked on non-stop, coz you got no clue about this game"
---
If I gave you a 100 mil sps pilot which might take you 5 years to train yourself i guarantee that for a long time to come you would just be a a very expensive killmail and would even lose fights to an experienced pilot that plays on a 5 mil skillpoints character.
---
Eve is about gaining experience, beyond a certain level there is pay to win of sorts, but as far as you are concerned that wont be an issue for years to come and by that point you wont care anymore.
---
I think you forgot sovereignty. I'm not sure if this still applies, but it certainly did during the POS warfare days. 1 day 17 is without the 25% fuel bonus. This meant sov based timers at ~2 day 7 hours.
---
In either case, nobody ran with the full fuel. Your towers would all be pre-timed for whoever was likely to attack.
---
That's the reason I requested it :D Maybe not take it all down to one key, but to reduce the number.
---
Fuck Snuff
---
Sadness. Thanks for the explanation, though.
---
Here’s to another year of successful CSMing. :)
---
Who can?
---
Yes, please. 
---
You should really spend a few weeks in HS playing, learning, doing and more before you even thing about joining/making a corp/alliance. 
---
Even then, you shouldn't be pushed into joining anyone quickly. There are public channels for questions and help, but corps that try to gobble up new players are just using them.
---
the Pepperidge Farm delivery man is in his car and is on his way to your house
---
I'll keep an eye on that when I get to T3's and higher and maybe add a seperate discussion on it.  
---
Thanks for the idea.
---
Ahhh. I was misreading. the 'Two-step authentication (2FA)' line.
---
$10 a year is peanuts though :)
---
(I use keepass, with the totp plugin.)
---
&gt;I'm just a silly, out-dated player who enjoys subcap PvP.
---
Rather, they don't have the courage to tell the common reddit poster that their idea of fun isn't conducive to the game's health, then slapping changes down. 
---
There's nothing like eve out there, but that may change one day. Trying to catch up and win people over is harder when something potentially better is promised rather than eve online: pvp/mega alliance buffs edition.
---
There are three ways to make it in this business. Be smarter, be faster or cheat.
---
&gt; When attacked, the defender would remove stront to shorten the timer into the desired timezone.
---
That was so rarely done, in my experience, as the defender was never around for the first attack.
---
Even when the Eve-mail warning when out, everybody ignored it, and the few with rights to remove stront were unlikely to be online.
---
Different experiences I guess. We typically did this with a fair amount of reliability.
---
&gt;  The big organized groups with wide timezone coverage gain a major advantage over the smaller or single timezone groups.
---
This dude thinks very highly his own ideas.
---
We did in 2006/2007 before dreadnoughts were common and POS defenses were _mean_. By the time Dominion sov rolled around the problem was POS were too weak. By the end of the last pre-Dominion Delve war we didn't bother sieging our dreads because even without siege we reinforced them faster than the module cycle time.
---
1 of the reasons was laziness as i found the fit from someone running T5's and figured it be a good base, 2nd reason is in that a mwd would need a completly different fit as it lacks powergrid. once again laziness.  
---
Although i didn't mention it i used a packrat so pull speed is 1250m/s, this however can be seen as 2500m/s if dropped next to the gate, while a mwd cerb can only get 2700 m/s with deadspace mwds, so all in all i would say the mtu is quicker, but that is just my view on it.
---
Thank you.
---
Add it to the station game, and I would forget the undock button.
---
&gt; It's well understood that small alliances can't hold sov in null-sec without the blessing of a large bloc 
---
Is it now? I know this is common "wisdom". It's also the kind of thing that large blocs would put out as propaganda to stop people from trying. There is plenty of space that is unused or underused out in nullsec. Go take some.
---
Shows EU'bies work 5 hours to the US 7.  This is why Germany, the richest large EU country has a GDP bigger than only 2 or 3 of the poorest US states.   :P
---
Some players were not even around back then, so see POS as an alternative to mechanics they don't like.
---
POS spam was also far worse, since could anchor and online a POS in very short timespan (15 / 30 / 60 minutes for a standard small / medium / large, shorter for faction).  The only limitation was moons, and a system with 30+ moons was a PITA to deal with.
---
It is a subscription based game.
---
You can fool around a bit with the Alpha clones, but they are not able to train much at all. You really want to have an Omega clone.
---
Making the ISK to buy plex for an Omega clone can require quite a few SP in order to be able to fund the "free" play. So think about getting a subscription for 3 month or so, since it will unlock a lot. 
---
And one final tip: DO NOT BUILD A MINER
---
Sure schedule a weekly move op to use this gate in a heavier ship ... like what can go wrong.
---
&gt; systems are connected to NPC lowsec ~~or NPC nullsec~~ by a static gate 
---
Aha, we see your true agenda, StainGuy!
---
is this /u/StainGuy in disguise?
---
&gt; It sounds like it isn't a gate to stain
---
One final correction, friend.
---
Eve kinda turned into P2W once you were able to buy SP-Injectors. Before that the only thing that $$$ was buying you was "gametime" or ingame money (or a 2nd/3rd training slot)
---
It seems to be up again.
---
And they say romance is dead
---
&gt; I think the defences could do with another look but they are OK
---
I'd say the Upwell defences are completely pointless.
---
The 'timezone tank' is also completely ineffective defense.
---
Yo mate I have no idea who you are but from just this comment chain you sound like a basic bitch.
---
Top Tier Shit Post... Solid mate lmao
---
&gt; Any changes that benefit small groups holding space will benefit bigger groups more
---
Citation required. Surely there's implementations that can make it harder for the big groups to hold big areas... like jump range reduction, or fatigue reworks, or you know, other things that limit power projection
---
But whatever, can't really change anyones mind here. You're either in a mega alliance, some shitty wormholer, or a solo player that has a few friends.
---
*lights cigarette*
---
Reminiscent of Malcanis's Law:  “Whenever a mechanics change is proposed on behalf of ‘new players’, that change is always to the overwhelming advantage of richer, older players.”
---
Low tiers you can get away with buffer fits, that would free up the required grid yeah? When I'm running t2s I use a buffer/kite caracal and loot as I clear.
---
Thanks for the help. I’ll send you a message if I need anything
---
Looks like a fun fight regardless of outcome :)
---
mememe! I love you
---
I think your perspective is very contextualised by that of a nullsec coalition leader - pos fights, as with citadels were for everyone.
---
In my experience max stornt timer was the default when you were not expecting an attack, or where an attack could come from multiple sources to buy you the most amount of time, especially lowsec, highsec, and wormhole space. I would argue that POSes mattered here more and it's these areas that are suffering for structure-based content the most in the post-upwell age.
---
The 25% timer bonus for sov was kind of weird to be honest and didnt fit in with the rest of the design in my view, although it does flip the chart over if you care to do the maths.
---
There is a mile long list of failed attempts to do anything besides eve, its pretty clear at this point that they got lucky with Eve.
---
Agreed. I thought I had a decent isk nest egg set aside to hold me for a bit but I'll just go back to paying like always if I stick around. It's gonna burn up way to fast at 2bil a month.
---
The athanor that was dropped by a member, timed for not our timezone and wasn't even pinged about.
---
But pat yourself on the back for killing an athanor when we were at work.
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.
---
My perspective is from that of a nullsec line member. POS warfare was long dead before I had any leadership role. 
---
It certainly is based on that of a large organized nullsec group though. Your chart similarly only really applies to organized groups. You can't timezone tank if you're expecting attacks from anywhere.
---
Will only take a few times before people take it as serious. We did it a few times. Even extorted line members of potential targets. It was kinda messed up, but we spent a month becoming the bad guys and popping structures (even farming the CEO by baiting them out a few times so their members could watch them die), then would tell people we are wardeccing their corp for some stupid reason. Once it was because someone had a similar name and I told him there could only be one of us in this region. One guy gave us like 200 mill to leave his corp alone. It wasn't a rounded number, so I believe it was everything he had. The same corp put a spy in our Discord that changed their gender and nationality about 4 times (it was fun). Sometimes members would drop corp and continue playing with their groups in an NPC corp, so we would red them individually and gank their shit with catalysts.
---
Honestly, it was a grind sometimes, but it was cool to become the bad guys for a short stint. Eventually they banded together and either moved to NS or formed a coalition and hired mercs to fight us. I like to think we made HS a better place and everyone got some good stories from it.
---
Go read their glass door reviews. After reading those working for CCP sounds about as much fun as working in a debt collection call center.
---
Back in the day, an alliance could be broken by attrition.  Attrition contributed to asset loss, participation loss, and financial loss.  Two of the three attrition types have become highly unobtainable - without a very large alliance block involved (even that is a misnomer).   Asset loss and financial loss are interconnected by a players ability to generate ISK by selling PLEX.  People with deep IRL pockets have no problem shelling out thousands of RL money for PLEX.  This in turn creates an endless supply of ISK.  The consequences are what we see today.  Expensive ships, that used to be a rarity and used for shock and awe, used in abundance and without abandon.  PLEX has reshaped the game and PLEX has inflated the economy, I don't think that can be denied. 
---
Pls note: I'm not accusing anyone of wrong doing.  I just feel that with PLEX and its ability to be used to acquire ISK, the game has been irreparably changed - as the system exists today.  It is a catch 22 because PLEX has been a great boon to the survival of the game.  This is coming from a player who has been away from the game for 6 years (and has recently resubbed).
---
Upvoted for the bromance.
---
/r/MissedConnections for dream
---
So us attacking you in OUR timezone for structures *timed* for OUR timezone, is your excuse to never fight us?
---
Thank you for prefacing your argument with an ad hominem and an epithet. It goes a long way to prove your point and not show that you obviously have no idea what you're talking about.
---
Seriously how long have you been playing this game? Goons have been "mortal enemies" of NC and PL since 2009. We've always viewed NC as the latest iteration of BOB/Kenzoku/IT Alliance/Raiden. etc, and therefore worthy of our eternal scorn and derision. 
---
PL we've had a semi-hate boner for off and on since the end of the Great War. We were pretty chummy when we were fighting BOB together, but then PL started to do their own thing. When Black Ops finally went fuck Goons and joined PL in a category 5 shit storm of drama and bad memes, it was the last straw, and Goons/CFC/Imperium have found ourselves fighting against PL in every major conflict since. 
---
So no, this war has little to do with Mittens or lowsec, or viceroy, or anything to do with WWB in particular, and has everything to do with over a decade of animosity and war between Goons and NCPL. 
---
As for letting the hate boner go: um, no, fuck that and fuck you. If big bad NC. and PL can't undock their own supers and motivate the 2 dozen members that still log in to fight for their own survival, then fuck them. They deserve to die. You didn't hear us crying about how unfair it was for  these groups farming new player and relatively low skill alliances like Brave Newbies and Test for years, and you didn't see NC. or PL leaving their supers home when they had the supremacy for ten years. When they had AOE titans. When they had cyno doomsdays. When they had tracking titans. When they had a literal untouchable ball of supers and titans with the wrecking ball doctrine. We undocked in fleets of subcaps and fought outnumbered and outgunned all the time. So again, fuck them now that the shoe is on the other foot and they failed to adapt.
---
I think the best solution movign forward is a mix of the two options. Maybe some stuff (citadels) are a bit harder to remove if they're actively defended, IE: fully powered and gunned. Sov, on the other hand, has timers more like this where there are ways for attackers to game the system in their favor if they're smart and persistent. Or have structures be easier than sov. Either way, you have a healthy mix.
---
Right now, all the timers just blindly favor the defender. That has to change.
---
I have no idea who you are either, but maybe if you followed politics of smaller groups it would matter. Rote has a hate-on for Iron Armada and keeps failing miserably trying to fight us without batphoning to try to bait and out escalate us.

---
might wanna update the wording....
---
Rental space exists, but is still not the 'holy grail' for small entities (it is very insecure).
---
Wormhole space was, for a while at least, before the masses realized that the same things which make w-space great for small entities, made it even better for larger entities.
---
I can't imagine any mechanic that would favour small groups, which wouldn't be exploited by large groups.
---
Isn't NC. basically the same timezone as you tho
---
As apposed to Pandemic Legion which can't do anything productive period.
---
Capital caches are a thing.
---
Range reductions are just an annoyance of no real consequence.

Turns out Hawaii is not an Eve power base

You keep fighting the good fight for your gate, we get connections to low all the time.

I don't think your sentence is true. This is the first time I'm hearing about Rote having a hate boner for Iron Armada, and I do follow small group "politics" as I'm a part of one.

Reminiscent of the fact that because this applies to everything , it’s a worthless law.
---
Paying for omega is cheaper than buying a new pc though...
---
&gt; You are however not allowed to play EVE by using more than one Account at the same time, unless you pay a subscription fee for each of the Accounts you intend to use for that purpose.
---
Is the actual clause in the EULA.
---
well you know this space will be less worth than this constellation next door no one want to utilize, but you keep it under your flag as it is next door.      
---
Tell me who will want to hold a separate system 20 gate jumps away 3+ mids ... just for sake of holding it.
---
That’s because this community has no imagination and is wildly afraid of the unknown.
---
It is pretty hard to move into NPC nulsec (or even lowsec) unless you are comparable force to the existing tenants.  Otherwise they have no reason to let you in.
---
PLEX can be bought.  It can then be sold for ISK.  Eve IS already a pay to win game.
---
\- I don't have to win in combat.
---
\- I just need to have a credit card to buy PLEX to replace my ISK so I can replace my losses and stay in the fight.
---
Where as 10 years ago 
---
\- I had to return to PvE and rat, mine, or mission run for ISK to replace my losses and get back into the fight.
---
\- Risk buying ISK from currency websites, so I didn't have to return to PvE to re-cooperate my losses.
---
EvE has evolved.  Golden Ammo would cause further evolution.
---
\- If it is handled like PLEX, it can be sold on the market.  Meaning it is available to all players regardless it they use IRL money or ISK to obtain it.
---
Well they come out of the wood works to troll, throw shade, or shed their salt every time Iron shows up on Reddit; and they smack hard in local whether they form or blue ball, or vice verse, win or lose. They have a history from well before I joined Iron as well from what I've heard
---
god i wish that were me
---
I have never forgiven Tomcat for that
---
thx
---
You found a good way to turn friends into enemies
---
Don’t forget that the empires have their own capsuleers. Iirc even one of the presidents of the Gallente federation was one in some capacity.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Also, while capsuleers can operate a ships essential functions solo, the lore still emphasizes that capsuleers ships still have crews, though greatly reduced in number. It’s not explained how necessary their roles are across the given classes of ships, but it’s safe to assume that a capsuleer still has to rely on people to perform some necessary functions. It makes sense too, since you’re essentially just jacked into the ships computer of an otherwise manually operated ship. Capsule technology is essentially a force multiplier in a broad sense.
---
Indeed, but they should be more clear about it, I've heard of several people being banned over this.
---
Agreed
---
It's not FAT ok. It's voluptuous
---
unless you have like 4 core terminals with radeons  laying around.
---
Add in sbu like structure that shifts exit timers by 6 or 12 hours based on what an attacker sets them to. Allows for counter play. 
---
Alternatively make it so you can't retime structures but once a month. Tz tanking has consequences then
---
Is that visible outside the game?
---
Trolling nerds is fun. Smack talking in local is fun. "Shedding salt" -&gt; i dont think this means what you think it means.

Is there a website that shows a character's bio outside the game?

---
All your questions have been answered. So I'm not going to repeat the info already stated.   
---
3-8 players is actually ideal for new players that just want to have fun together. However, if you really want to gain knowledge quickly, you're going to have to join up with pilots who have been playing for a while and let them teach you. There is a wealth of knowledge you can gain from twitch/youtube. ...but accept no substitute for hands on training. I've been playing this game for many years and i'm still nowhere as versed as most other pilots. 
---
The only thing close to p2w is skill injecting....but just because you pay to gain the ability to use items doesn't mean you have the experience to use them correctly. I've seen many people inject into capitals and supercapitals only to lose them not long after.   
---
I hope you give the game a chance. There is absolutely a long learning curve...but when you make it through it, the game becomes a part of you. Be prepared to experience all the emotions.
---
Nobody.  Not even the small entities, as the logistics nightmare is far worse for them.
---
I married his other sister. Turned out great. /s
---
I see the wisdom in this
---
Yeah, it's a little frrigtening but you will get confortable as you practice. T1s and T2s are easy to do, and T2s give you from 7 yo 12m isk per run, which is already a good money for highsec. You can run them safely in a gila with rapid light missile launchers and rep. You just need to focus neutralizers and you're done. It's all about experience. As you do them you will learn what are the dangers.
---
damn dude you really dont know how wh space works day to day

This shit. This shit right here is what I needed. 10/10 m8 I had no idea about the Q-click thing. Well I know about Q-clicking stuff in my overview/broadcasts to align but not for precisely maneuvering in arbitrary directions, I always just panned my camera and double-clicked center screen. Don't ask me how long I've been playing this game &gt;.&gt;
---
hahahaha so true, seems like Stainguy just worked out where he really wants to be living but doesnt know it
---
 - A one day old character could scram an enemy Sabre. 
---
 - A one day old character could jam an enemy logi chain. 
---
 - A one day old character could sacrifice their ship to save the tackled FC. 
---
 - A one day old character could smartbomb an interdiction bubble. 
---
 - A one day old character could fleetwarp NC.'s subcap fleet into a Test bombing run.
---
Such as?
---
So when the entire game teamed up to stroke their collective hate-boner for Goons that was cool, but when Goons go for payback after a history of antaganization by NCPL, we should just forget about the last decade of BS pulled by NCPL and all sing kumbaya around the campfire?
---
bet
---
&gt; Sad!
---
kaumaha
---
Its like they go outside or something
---
Exactly. The issue is horde,goons,test, etc aren't just helping new players out of some altruism. They are literally competing for the lifeblood of the game. Without players the alliances will die (eventually, eve has a fairly low turnover rate for long term players so it will take a while). So recruitment is a tool to sustain your group. Which is good for new players, it is good to have opportunities. but the idea that you have to join a massive group in eve to have fun is so stupid.
---
When I was a new pilot (back in 2011) I was randomly recruited by some scrub alliance with maybe 30 guys in a fleet on a super peak night. Just shooting the shit with people, mucking around in low-sec or wormholes. Even held some sov for a couple months (when some big block would collapse we would run in and grab some space). Sure, mechanics have changed since then, but mostly it's the players who have changed.
---
Can still search through evewho and click the zkill link
---
&gt;Learn how you died, how that can be prevented in the future... 
---
I'm not saying not to do this. But everyone has already given him plenty of advice on how to do this, and completely ignored the real problem. 
---
He has no stable income.
---
Further, missions are much more fun than incursions. Mining is a shit ton of extra skill points which are not combat related, and he's not going to be nulsec ratting with &lt;1m skill points.
---
What corp are you in? Want to be sure to avoid self righteous dickwads like you.
---
This is definitely an expensive route FOR SURE, but you could plex their account, that'll get their attention, I don't know if maybe gifting something cheaper will send them an email notification. Or even anything else that will send an email notification for that matter, they likely won't have any eve related ESI apps for sure
---
EDIT: typos
---
&gt;I must admit it does kind of creep me out that you're checking up on me, that you're so interested in me you're now looking at my bio for any and all information you can get on me...  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;You're a sick pervert, you should be ashamed of yourself, does your mother know and accept what a sick sick person you have become? I bet she cries herself to sleep every night knowing what type of horrid perverted person you have become....  
---
&gt;Well since you're violating me for your demented sexual gratification the least you can do is pay me some isk for my trauma...  A minimum of 500 million isk will keep me from telling people how you made me touch myself while you played with your naughty bits while smearing lipstick on your face saying you are "so pretty ohhhh oh so pretty"....
---
then he should release ALL the screenshots from FRT and Noraus.. stop dangling them and hinting and release the proof that we all know..WinterCo is as sh*tty as the rest and their leadership KNOWS it's happening. Instead he hints around every so often with only written accusations.
---
&gt; By the time Dominion sov rolled around the problem was POS were too weak.
---
That recently came-up in another thread.
---
Many current players don't remember a POS being capable of killing dreads, or even 10 minute siege cycles.
---
You're exactly correct, and that's why it's so much fun.
---
It's actually Brute. I insisted it was Brutae too, then my GF schooled me. Vocative is Brute, and it does make sense as Brutus is being adressed by Ceasar.
---
Just glad I'm not the only one. 😘
---
Also, keep it up.
---
&gt; you can still fly vindis tho
---
ftfy
---
Actually it is not, 1jump away you are in NPC space, mostly lowsec.
---
Perhaps, but your proposal doesn't read that way. If it's as hard to reach as you're indicating people simply won't bother, especially in this era where people dock to deny content to roamers as a tactic. 
---
If it's close and easy enough to reach so that people will make the effort, one of two things happen. 
---
1. It's overrun and used by sov null empires,
---
2. the amount of roaming gangs prevents any fledgling groups doing pve and growing, pushing them to go to the large groups for safety.
---
Again, sarcastically posted by a TEST guy
---
I think not.
---
Wes enjoy
---
And hundreds of thousands who say nothing because it was good enough.
---
Wait read again. In order to such pockets exist they need to be "hiddien" somewhere between nullsec and higsec. Probably above or below he "pane" of lowsec systems.
---
Makes sense. Doubt Vini would agree with you though... He'd probably argue with you AND your GF until you like, shot him or something. /Shrug/
---
Most ships I fly are f2p ones. You don't need to fly expensive ships to have fun
---
This is a good analogy. No ship can effectively turn on a dime when it's the anchor for 10-30+ other ships
---
That's exactly the reason they won't fully engage a fight they can't win. Which basically goes for any alliance btw.
---
Thanks mate, please keep me informed on how that goes.
---
Thats not even applicable in this situation. Before you use "big words", at least know what they mean. Thanks.
---
The Amarr Empire :)
---
He's not going to be doing missions either with less than 1m SP, but you seemed so keen on providing that 'advice' anyways.
---
Fucking love the YIP YIPs.
---
&gt; you can still multibox VNI's or Myrmidons tho
---
one more tip i got is. Do not chase the I got to plex my account to become omega bunny. It will burn you out on eve. If you make enough isk in the game that it does not impact you go ahead and plex. But if you need to think about ohw no i'm not gonna buy this ship / module because i need it to plex than you are gonna get fed up with the game rather soon.
---
Turns out that is actually it... thought it was a troll but that is actually it...
---
Timezone tanking was a mistake
---
Damage cap on citadels was a mistake
---
Maybe one day Pearl Abyss will step in a fix CCP's shit because we all know they won't do it themselves.
---
Nobody undocks for fights they can't win, not even goons
---
Wait. Is the "Final Boss" supposed to be a Gaul warrior, maybe even Vercingetorix? It would kind of make sense given Vini is alluded to be Caesar. (Though Vercingetorix didn't die on the battlefield.)
---
If you really have no intention of returning to EVE just fucking RMT that shit.
---
Don't play to save ISK for omega aka plexing your account, especially if you're new. You will find yourself grinding way too much to keep enjoying the game.
---
What are these wall boxes? Never heard of them till now.
---
That is definitely not a crab but a crawfish
---
~~EVE Gate~~
---
I had to check. It’s true. That’s pretty creepy. What say you OP ?
---
You see it i see it, but if you will look at 10.000 krabs every day - it will just blend in.
---
That’s a bit stalky!
---
Unmentally Stable?
---
I only learned this by doing incursions. Used to align down the gate so the fleet can all enter at the same time. I then used it for FCing and anchoring.
---
Also a one day old character wouldn’t understand anything you said.
---
I'm just questioning to what ends Goons are doing what they are doing.
---
There is no Mummy and Daddy around to applaud at amount of Titans you have made through turning game into a farming-sim. 
---
You just spent years of you lives autistically building a massive fleet just to have a few uncontested structure bashes. The only losers here are you. :)
---
We already have that.
---
Most of the eastern half of the galaxy are these distant pockets of space. They're not controlled by small upstart groups, they're controlled by slumlords renting them to botters.
---
Botters want to be remote and unreachable. What you're forgetting is that reachable by attackers also translates to empire being reachable. Real players need empire logistics. Only botters and renters want to be in the remote pockets. The lack of fighting over these areas makes it easy for slumlords to set up shop and turn them into rental zones.
---
They are the extractors that you can shoot for drops instead of just shooting the biocache
---
If you ain't having fun what's the point
---
I don't necessarily agree. Sure, people krab during an offensive war, but I don't think those people would be as motivated to krab instead of fight in a defensive war. I think a lot of people are krabbing precisely because "we're Goons, we have TEST, and there's nobody we can't defeat". If the rest of EVE ganged up on them, say, those people would stop krabbing pretty quickly.
---
Lol! Good call out but no, that wasn't the intent. The final boss was a generic "raider" that was different from the "pirates" and he wore armor. The drop was an armor mod, so I used it.
---
The last frame was more a call back to a meme I posted last ides of March regarding Caesar being an early Eve FC awoxed by 22 stabbers and a Brutix.
---
I spent 7 years in highsec mining ice before I randomly messaged a person in space and discovered the game, don’t be me, if all else fails go to providence and learn to live there. It is just like nullsec except there are people constantly trying to kill you. 
---
I would suggest finding c1-c3 wh Corp once you can scan . If you are on the Reddit’s you are light years beyond me when I started.
---
Flying skills count 1000x as much as skill points and it might take a while to learn and who to engage but it is worth it , if you’re strong enough
---
Find a decent pilot and learn everything they will teach you, if you don’t get them killed they will bring you out again, learn everything they do and anticipate their strategy. Don’t argue , learn. 
---
Every pilot has something to teach you , it is your job to figure out what that is. 
---
Help new bros, they are where you were.
---
Progress is becoming a better person, pilot, friend, leader, tactician, . There is a dark side and becoming better at those is not my goal, but it could be yours . Those things include betrayal, spying, thievery, ganking, and all around being a shit. 
---
You don’t need time in game to accomplish these things but it can help, being on coms with your active corp mates does help. Lots of information is thrown around on coms and you could learn 90% of what you need to be a good FC just by paying attention. 
---
Good luck.
---
damn.
---
Nuancy doesn't exist right?
---
Huh. Do they show up on overview, as an LCO?
---
Thanks for the info btw
---
knowing some off the people that play this game they would find a way.
---
Here's a twist, what if that's actually OPs account
---
How'd you know!
---
The big-block meta folk will just split off X folk into a puppet corp/alliance and take these places if there is anything remotely valuable there.
---
1. Thanks for all this info! Can you DM me your discord or something so we can chat? I'll probably need more help in the future, and you seem very helpful!
---
2. For regular corps. I guess I'll have to wait a bit then lol.
---
3. Thanks.
---
4. I've done all but the military, which is what i am currently doing. What is the ninja gas thing? Also, do you have a good fit I could use for the Heron?
---
5. What racial ship skills should I train then?
---
6. How should I go about making ISK then? Incursions or exploration?
---
ok...
---
They are in the same list as the biocaches and only contain the isogen, databases and zero-point condensates.
---
So again, when NC and PL would drop 500 supers against 2 battleship fleets, it was all cool. When Goons do it, we're losing? 
---
Personally I haven't krabbed or mined or done any form of PVE in years and I have 2 supers and a titan. Basically ran out of things to spend ISK on. Not our fault that Goons economy is bottom up and NCPL's is top down.
---
User name checks out
---
Erm, what?
---
Does one of those involve Barghests and a kitchen sink fleet getting dunked by Oracles?
---
That looked like a fun one.
---
1)  It's limited f2p - you can play as long as you like, but there is an effective cap on your "level" to put it in WoW terms.  You're restricted from a few high level ships and a few activities.  F2p is excellent for getting a feel for the game, but if you're serious, you'll want to subscribe.
---
2a)  You can enjoy the game with any numbers.  Working well together will be a good thing - the game rewards more people more.
---
2b)  Skill is acquired through real time, not through any kind of experience point system (kill monster, get xp - nope).  You do get money through activity in game, so the more active player may get richer.  Or poorer... losing a ship is a real loss, you don't do a corpse run and get it all back.  You might get some of it back, if whoever killed you didn't loot you, and no one else came along and looted you, etc.
---
3)  Don't know for current.  There are periodic sales on packages of one sort or another.  There are definitely referral bonuses, so the smart thing would be for one of you to sign up, and each subsequent person use one of the already signed up people as a referrer.  In any case, referral will do you no good if you're not both subscribed.  Referring a f2p player gets you nothing till they subscribe.
---
Lastly 3-8 premades sounds not bad for WoW, but it's small potatoes in Eve.  You'll still want to join a corp, where you may be part of 8-12 man (small gang) fleets, or large (200+) fleets for various warlike activities.  Or not, there are small corps of 3-8 around.  You might consider creating a corp for your group, and have the corp join a larger alliance.  Eve has politics.  :-)
---
The eve uni instructions worked fine for me just a couple of days ago. However I did use the gui to unzip the tar file but other than that they worked fine.
---
Good to know, I'll give it a shot then. Thank you!
---
Steel? I've not heard of this, please do tell.
---
Sad but,true
---
WHAT IS LOVE ?
---
Uh, 22 rusty Stabbers to the back? Nasty. Hmm.. I think I might have something similar in one of my super old sketchbooks where I tried to come up with funny eve related sketches. Yes they are bad. No I'm probably not going to show them. ^^
---
I have made a bit of cash whit a Prospect once.
---
Yes, you red that right. The T2 mining frigate. It was when Ressource Wars where introduced and the loyality point store for the npc mining corps. There where clothing items in there you could buy for relatively little LP and 100m ISK. They sold in Jita during the first weeks for like 250m each. Not huge turnover but they still sold steadily. And others realized that as well and put them on market and the prices dropped after the first month dramatically.
---
I did grind level 2 or 3 RW sites (not sure, was a while back) for a month and made quite a bit of ISK that way.
---
Making ISK is about finding opportunities you can repeat. Or just luck, like [finding unanchored structures](https://thegreybill.wordpress.com/2019/04/15/the-grand-little-scoop/) in a wormhole.

Ah you met my ex fiancee

ha dude i miss fighting ya :(
---
Exploration is the way forward! It will teach you a lot about the game. You will encounter enemies, gate camps, you will die but you will learn to also evade them.
---
All whilst making good isk.
---
&lt;/3
---
Just saw some activity on your killboard the other day. What are you doing?
---
No problem. Good luck!
---
DON'T HURT ME
---
Wait bro hold up
---
Can confirm, there was one guy who multiboxed gas huffers who acted pretty spodbrained...
---
Does it, though?
---
Yes it is if your alliance leader keeps getting banned for RMT and your treasury alliance keeps admitting to owning like 500 bots. Eventually CCP will remove your isk from you and your corporation but not before banning your accounts.
---
Just came back after a 3months off. I got teased by the triglavian command dessy and wanted to try it. Im back in lamaa and roam around there still for now, content is okay-ish if you can dodge the gayness of DHSJ.
---
That always confused me. Whenever I asked I was told "armour is the meta in wormholes".
---
&gt;The 'timezone tank' is also completely ineffective defense.
---
It only looks that because of the current burning of the north and the associated lack of defense. If the defender actually puts effort into resisting on top of timezone tanking it works just fine as a defense. See horde and BL's attempt to invade branch. Or Test's months long efforts to take detroid where after all this time they have managed to grab only 1 system.
---
Isn’t that targeting then target lock ?
---
I mean yeah. We wouldn’t brawl with shield vs a heavy armor fleet in our static
---
Looking for a corp or rather solo derping for now? Schneckt is still pretty dead afaik :/
---
&gt;He's not going to be doing missions either with less than 1m SP
---
He's not going to be doing lvl 4 missions. If you reread the original post, you will see that the advice was step 1, Drones V, step 2, Tristan. Unlike some people, who think everyone should be VNI Nulsec Ratting yesterday, I actually provide complete advice and take all aspects of the question into account.
---
Using citadel's is more for swapping your training clone as you need to be in the citadel with a spare clone to switch without activating your jump clone cooldown. Let's say you end your day in jita today, tomorrow you log in and play market and when ready to do other stuff you jump to your clone in null. Let's say you whelped ships all day and are ready to log, you can go to the citadel and swap to your implanted clone to speed up your training which you normally would not be able to do but you can because it doesnt trigger the timer. Next morning you can swap again in citadel and pod your clean clone and if your medical clone is set in a station near jita you can just fly over and get to work in the market again, when your timer ends you repeat.
---
I don't buy characters or skill inject.  I am about a year away from a TItan pilot alt.  Probably more than that from a Titan affordable wallet.
---
Yeah i just joinned them back for now to be able to shoot everyone, FW is fucked up and its a bummer to be in a factions. So for now im mostly flying solo or with whoever i'm feeling like. Idk im back for how much time but atm im enjoying it. You got an offer ? Schneckt might rise from ashes, who know ? Time will tell.
---
Just run it through Steam. Steam has a Linux version and thanks to Steam Play the Windows version of Steam runs just fine on Linux. The only issues I've noted is that web links in-game don't work, you have to copy/paste them into your browser.
---
Install Windows
---
Playing devils advocate here but it’s almost like you accept the EULA. Though I doubt more than 0.5% of people read it.
---
Mothy and me started our own little pirate crew a while ago (https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98592854/). We do a good amount of solo and small stuff and sometimes a bit bigger with the alliance. And we’ll always have a spot for you :) I wouldn’t be sad at all if Schneckt recovers tho
---
I dunno about sister, but I dated a guy like that.
---
Keeps getting banned? Do you not know how RMT is handled?
---
It doesn't say anything about multiple Alphas, it says multiple Omegas as long as an Alpha is not logged in on the same computer...
---
That’s why I argued that caps should be less useful against sub caps and why we were able to get some of the HAW changes through on titans. I want there to be more role specific stuff for caps.
---
Let's say the movement of PLEX is the cornerstone of ISK in circulation. On average 1,424,583 PLEX was sold per day for the past week. The 5 day running median is 4,114,209 ISK/PLEX. Thus currently there is approximately 5.861 trillion ISK in PLEX traded everyday.    
---
To put that into perspective, and probably the answer you're looking for... as of May 2017 the total amount on active player characters and corporations is roughly [1.089 Quadrillion ISK](https://cdn1.eveonline.com/community/MER/May_2017/9b_isk.float.3.png).
---
In dealing with the capital hull losses, the issue isn't usually isk per se; it's hull/ore availability. Most alliances mine their own ore and build their own caps; if they can't mine/build enough, they run out of caps even if they have a massive wallet. (Some people are in situations where they can source new caps from other areas, paying directly in isk; but this is rarely done on the sort of scale needed to sustain a sovwar.) 
---
300b in losses isn't too severe as far as caps go. Most big alliances have large warchests/stockpiles in addition to rich linemembers, and can probably sustain upwards of 1k cap losses before they have trouble reshipping. Smaller alliances might not have huge caches, but you can find 20 dreads on public contracts in nearly every region of the game.
---

Not wrong, so that's no excuse to avoid the ban; contradicting information on their support site might be.
---
Yep that sounds about right.  He had an interesting sense of humor but was a stand up pilot and a good friend.
---
Because it is, regardless of what our wormhole is.
---
highly debatable....because Mittens cares my dude.  He doesn't rat, breh.

Its a place for small corps to duke it out, or merge together.  I don't know how else the can indirectly facilitate a "safe place" for small groups to coop....

I said God Damn.

Why are certain bomber fits called Goku bombers? Same with Stuka.

Yellow box means the ship has you Target locked. Red box means they've activated an offensive system against you.

They might if someone teaches how to do it.

It's a universal problem.
---
"A mind is a terrible thing to lose."
---
Do you think a Caracal could run T2?
---
You could try using Lutris, EVE ran pretty well through there when I was using PopOS a few months ago.
---
Also remove Rorquals while you're at it.
---
It actually doesn't apply to everything at all (see Phoebe or mining anom respawn nerfs, for instance), so it's not really a law, but it is worth asking "how does my proposal beat Malcanis' Law" before posting it.
---
"cognitive bias in which people mistakenly assess their cognitive ability as greater than it is." pretty much exactly what you've displayed here. Might add this subject is my field (network security) and /u/Fuzzmiester fully understands the issue, by arguing with him you've displayed you know nothing of it.
---
I'll check that out too, thanks!
---
hundreds of thousands who don't matter to the situation other then being at risk, in your case quite willingly.
---
This explains why you're snuffed out.
---
For small groups maybe the isk cost will add up.  But it's more about ability to replace the losses, not just isk.  At the nullsec bloc level, welp a few HAC fleets or a chunk of supers and it doesn't matter how much isk you have, you can't replace them tomorrow, the supply isn't there.  
---
Most large scale wars are won on morale though, one side stops logging in to fight. 
---
The MER includes total isk in circulation, as of April it was 1357T, so a lot.
---
No, don’t remove Rorqs, just take away the Excavators. It can still on-grid boost
---
In luei of mining, can you buy the minerals off the market?  Say if you have a large warchest and just put up buy orders all over the place, collect it when you need it, and build?  May not be the most efficient way, as I think about it, but you wouldn't need to have a fleet of minor to accomplish it.
---
It still seems that wars of attrition would prove quite difficult to accomplish.
---
Rorqual nerfs, ceptor nerfs, mining rebalance, and a bunch more were achieved under the GSM...tell me again how corrupt we are my dude?
---
I could be wrong but I don't think steam has got a linux version of the game. However, the steam version of the game runs with volvos adaptation of wine, and its frankly doing a pretty good job at running the game. Imo this is the easiest and most stable way that I've found.
---
Edit: Clarification
---
They are referring to steel roamer, the former ceo of Shekel Squad
---
Glad to hear it man :)
---
wow you went way overkill for t1s
---
Back in the bob days we timed our structures 4x per day.
---
1357T ... Incredible.
---
If you speed run the t3s (finish is 10-13 minutes) and get all the loot you make about 70-100 mil an hour from materials alone.
---
If you want to get an idea of isk in circulation and wealth generation you can read :

Yea I miss the days when you could jump in 200 triage slowcats, rep your structure and nuke your enemy with fighters/sentries

---
It's fine, just go RF some sov in the 1 hour that you have overlap and pray that it doesn't drop into the other 7 hours thanks to retarded RNG timer mechanics.
---
ansiblex lolololololololol
---
Thank you this is great!
---
Yes, ISK and minerals are interchangeable for all intents and purposes of this discussion.
---
IPH has a discord channel if you want to ask questions about the program or industry. It’s relatively new since I’m just getting caught up with discord.
---
There is also a slack channel that has the eve developers for third party apps but it’s a bit dead lately.
---
Not with minerals (too high m3 to ship) but you can definitely buy massive amounts of compressed ore in jita and ship it into your space, if you can't mine
---
The real problems kick in if your production facilities are no longer safe at the capacity you need to run them at. Building 600 dreadnoughts a week in sotiyos you can't defend is a good way to double down on your losses, and if the sotiyos do die you *really* can't replace stuff anymore.
---
Edit: for context, **no alliance** (to my knowledge) **has ever actually lost a war on isk/material attrition.** Now, most of the relevant wars were fought pre-Phoebe (no jump fatigue, makes it easier to replace losses) and/or with giant titan blobs (one B-R level fight would decide the conflict). So today's mechanics *might* make material attrition more relevant to a long campaign. 
---
But it's still a long shot; the real attrition is in pilot morale, when people stop showing up to fleets; or, if you lose a decisive battle like B-R or X47 that puts you so far behind in supercap fleet size that there's no point showing up to big fights anymore.
---
So are you going to send him 500m?
---
'Unstable Mental' would work.
---
Said it before, will say it again.
---
STOP with with the jarring mid video twitch ad. 
---
It actively makes me want to stop watching and never look your twitch channel up.
---
Thanks nate, will see you at the nightly gatecamp to discuss this further o7
---
My idea is to merge Citadels with Ihubs and TCUs. Sov is determined by who has a citadel up in system. Every system is limited to one citadel at a time. Then limit anchoring Engineering Complexes/Refineries/Ansiblexes/Pharoluxes/Tenebrixes to one per moon. Change low- and highsec citadel mechanics so whoever owns the citadel in system gets some or all of the ISK generated in taxes in that system, giving people an incentive to fight wars over them in high- and lowsec.
---
To counter the problem of a system owner filling every moon in system with a structure and preventing enemies from gaining a foothold, add Forward Operating Bases which are structures without docking access which act as a Mobile Depot with infinite storage, tethering (maybe) and a single timer when powered (no timer when unpowered).
---
This limits structure spam and forces alliances to be strategic in where they place structures. It serves as a content generator in high- and lowsec. It also still allows attackers to gain footholds in system through deploying FOBs and basing assets out of them.
---
What about swolecat t3c?
---
Can I see one of those fits please
---
I believe they stipulate that as they can't tell difference between say a husband and a wife, and a person with 2 computers
---
There is a cure for Space AIDS. We have the technology.
---
I'm with you. I spent 51 days as an Alpha until I scraped together the real dough for a year of Omega. Grinding your Omega in real life is easier than grinding your Omega in game. Plus, you can throw all your ISK at whatever it is you **enjoy doing.**

---
What's his story?
---
No idea
---
We will help
---
I know but it all has to do with laziness and not wanting/needing to change my fit for the higher tiers to come.
---
I know I've said this a few times before, but bring back the starbase charter mechanic for Citadels in non-PC-sov space (so NPC Null, low, and high sec).
---
Just to hold sov it will require activity from the holding entity in some fashion, meaning you have to be active. It discourages taking sov for the sake of having it, meaning larger groups can't just roflstomp and then hold (emphasis on "and then hold") smaller entities.
---
It would also impose a decay of sorts if an entity can't do that upkeep. Maybe have shorter or nonexistent timers for Citadels that are out of charters, making forgotten ones easier to bash.
---
A higher cost in high sec would also be a push to low and NPC null for player structures.
---
And if a larger Null group wants to incursion it and push out some of these structures, they have to leave their space, and if a third group wants to try to give them a black eye for the hell of it not much is stopping them if they're iching for the fight.
---
Besides, when was the last time k-space systems were added to the game?
---
Ah I didn't mean a linux version of steam. I meant a linux version of the game in steam. Sorry for poor choice of words. Obviously steam has a linux version. I'm using it. Once steam is installed I think you need to activate a beta program to use proton though. Again could be wrong.
---
Much like your posting
---
When I was a kid i was terrified of them. You remember how they could teleport from the background to the foreground of the set? I assumed they could also teleport from the TV into my living-room.
---
i tryed to turn on the reps after he jumped gate but that only paused the video..
---
Yeah i read further down, was just an instant thought comment. What made you pick the cerb over a dual web sac?
---
The links I commented for the Heron and Venture have fits. You can look at Heron: Beginner Explorer (you can drop the cloak since you are still an alpha) and Venture: Gas Venture T1 for the fits.
---
Ninja Gas Huffing is going into wormholes inside Gas Sites and harvesting the gas site that can be worth quite a lot. Very strong Sleepers (NPCs that attack you) spawn after about 15 mins, so the trick is to harvest as much gas as you can and then warp out when they arrive. You can easily make 50mil/hour doing this. A big downside though is that the gas harvesting skill is pretty expensive to start (30 million ISK).
---
The Heron uses Caldari Frigate as a skill, so you can start training that, along with missile skills. You should probably join the corp and ask them what you should train after that. They will have specific fits and skill plans to get you started as fast as possible.
---
Incursions are advanced PvE flown with Battleships and pretty expensive ships, so it's going to be a while before you start doing that :P. Like I said, exploration is probably the best thing you can start doing for ISK. Doing it in hisec doesn't give you much ISK, but you could do 1-2 data or relic site to get used to it. After that, you want to get to a wormhole and find a way into nullsec, doing Pirate Relic/Data sites along the way (do not do any sites that start with Forgotten or Unsecured, there are sleepers in there that will blow you up). Do any relic/data sites in nullsec and frequently come back into hisec to store your loot.
---
Well, excuse the fuck out of us for utlizing our space, but it does seem to be an effective strategy that anyone could use.
---
Not laughing at the concept, laughing at the idea of being able to plex 100 account for a year. That's goon money.
---
How much isk would the player base consider for an individual to be "filthy rich"? I'm talking cash only in your personal wallet.
---
&gt;Baboon
---
this is true
---
&gt; if you're doing t1's/t2's you can solo them in a worm or AF (retribution/hawk)
---
I thought Filaments were hard locked to cruisers for solo and frigs for trios?
---
Because I remember looking into if you could get a destroyer in there and you couldn't.
---
Like a hurricane with explosions and screaming, then silence.
---
Probably at least a Trillion at this point.
---
No bit I am sure if you ask a gee guys caught in Fraternity about it you can easily find out.
---
Backing up to the cloud basically makes the 2fa less secure, so google doesn't offer this option. If you use the same password it's offers no extra protection
---
Best way to make sure you don't lose access is to keep the secret stored locally on your pc, put it on a second phone (or your partner/a good friends phone) of print it out and keep it somewhere safe
---
the only way to hide them would be to not have static gates connecting to the same place. What you're describing are wormholes, but with sov mechanics.
---
Hahah no
---
lol luv it!
---
Yeah just ignore all the rest of the players in game, that's cool.  
---
\*Edit and if you're going to lump test in with goons you have to lump winterco and skillu in with Panfam.

---
Everything I said was correct. What exactly do you think Dunning-Kruger applies to here?
---
&gt;Might add this subject is my field (network security) 
---
Now that is Dunning-Kruger if anything.
---
This is not really network security and if you werent full of shit, you would know that. This is more related to password hashing or OTP. Running some program on your machine that steals your password is also not network security.
---
And if you werent a total idiot with a hammer looking for a nail, maybe you would understand what the fuck this means: 
---
&gt;I know there is still a choice, but the question was essentially: would you take it away if you could?
---
&gt;and /u/Fuzzmiester fully understands the issue,
---
Thats laughable.
---
Keep on virtue signaling.
---
Awesome! I've been saving up seed and now I have something to do with it!
---
I've gotten mostly carbon before, I think 300K isk is probably my lowest for a null-sec data site.

Being Devil's Advocate, how could they tell you and your room-mate both playing on Alpha accounts in the same apartment from Joe Blow playing on multiple Razor gaming laptops like a 70s Prog Rock band played keyboards?

Hope is not a plan, dude. If you want a CSM that isn't dominated by one group, you need more than one group to put in the work of organizing a slate of candidates and getting out the vote.

Very much this. After all, Fozzie Sov's intent was to encourage new groups to take space and to stop the blue donut and then citadels came along and the combination of the 2 mechanics just made space safer

Goku and Stuka are specific fleet doctrines (compositions, setups) centered around bombers. Usually, you use a bomber as a stealthy hit-and-run ship meant to inflict maximum damage to big targets, but have a very light tank. Gokus (designed by TEST I think) flipped that upside-down by including a strong shield buffer tank, low signature and a complement of support ships such as logistics frigates, allowing them to stay on a grid for a long time, dishing out massive torpedo damage at a long range. 
---
Stukas (created by Pandoralica of the Initiative) evolved that idea by adding a large command destroyer wing - giving the fleet the ability to teleport around the grid at will. The original intent was for them to surprise the enemy with massive bombing runs coming seemingly out of nowhere, but torpedos just turned out to be a more reliable main weapon system. They are currently by far the fastest and most maneuverable fleet doctrine in the game. 
---
I don't know how Goku bombers were named, but Stukas get their name from the WWII dive bombers used by the Germans: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junkers_Ju_87

CITADEL COMBAT! Boarding a citadel in final timer gives you a chance to capture it. Think about how much more fun the current war in Tribute would be for both sides if uncontested structures were able to be captured in an FPS match.
---
They can't. They don't ban people for having the same IP...they ban people for obviously gaming the system to have a lot of alphas logged in at once.
---
As said, they are the most profitables, and yet the least fan (and also have the cheapest filaments, rivaling Firestorms) because the cookie cutter Gila can’t cookie cut it’s way through with the speed bonus making the drones a pain in the ass to actually use correctly (and in the time limit).
---
You could also just build a server that could run like 30 instances of windows pretty easily. (For like $600)
---
Absolutely. You don't need gunners or pilots, but you still need engineers, officers, cooks, and maintenance personnel.
---
This crustacean is smarter than 87.7% of Eve players....
---
Give it a go!
---
The root "problem" (if it can even be called that) is that no game mechanic can mitigate the power of large numbers of people working in an organized way. At least, I've never heard of one.
---
All I'm saying is: 32 on 32 match to decide the fate of a Keepstar. In a Titan docking bay. With tanks. And aircraft. And a control center at the far end that will flip structure control to the corp who captures it.
---
I too liked Dust 514.
---
Currently it doesn’t have any, and training it up is plain dumb as you don’t get anything out of it, not even a bonus to manufacturing speed or needs (plus you need around 100 days to get it to V, so it’s not even a good skill for SP farms).

Recently had a sansha relic site in a wormhole where every can dropped less than 30k and one of the cans was entirely empty. I was so excited by the hole because there were 2 relic sites and 3 data sites. Ended up making a half-decent 70mil from the whole system. Two days earlier I'd gotten 120mil from just one relic site :'(

smh keep on falling more and more into your hole man, you don't even realize my job is to PREVENT this kind of thing and as such it's part of it to keep on top of things like 2fa (which we do use at work BTW, though not the google authenticator system, I'm much more of a FIDO fan, but give me no other option I'll use google) basically this is firmly in my wheelhouse, you only dig yourself deeper making your attempt at mental gymnastics (emphasis on attempt, you basically belly flopped on the matt (and no, I did not misspell matt, feel sorry for the guy really)) And BTW, calling me an idiot when you consider Dunning-Kruger a big word?  Thanks for the laugh
---
I'd say yeah, extract it and then train it up back to I if you're building Upwell structures for yourself, your corporation or your alliance. It's basically free SP that's just waiting to be extracted and injected in something more useful.

Yea, but the N+1 Game is not really adressable. At same skill levels more People will allways have the upper hand.

But you n+1 bs/cruisers in a keepstar maybe fightable with the use of aoe like bombers, smartbombs etc. N+1 Titans scaps and caps are a different thing.

Pretty much exactly what you are doing. You know 2fa isnt necessary, but you keep defending it because it is "virtuous", and you also think you are superior. So a virtue signaling dunning-kruger projecting idiot. That is amazing.
---
If you did that for a living then you would know that it isn't primarily relevant here. The main concern would seem to be if someone reuses their password somewhere and that place gets hacked and they didnt salt+hash the passwords. Alternatively, if someone likes to run "untrusted" programs.

I really hate when people leave cans in a site, and only loot the valuable ones.

So is the unethical bit that one gets multiple votes? Because I'm fairly certain most serious EVE players have multiple accounts.

I remember reading somewhere that most people have 20b or less in liquid isk on average. No idea for sure but I think that while there are people with a trillion isk or more, they aren't many in the greatest scheme of things.

So the act of salting+hashing a string falls on "network security"? Users running things on their home machines falls on "network security"? You would have to stretch that pretty fucking far.

Salting and hashing a string, yes at least making sure a system is in place to do that is entirely in my wheelhouse, as for home machines, you'd expect someone in the federal government to have an approximate knowledge of state government activities as well, same concept is in play here, not to mention do you really assume I don't have my own home equipment when I have equipment for work. And I do know the meaning of the quotes, hence why I disregarded them when yours didn't make sense.

Yeah shouldn't it be the other way around?
---
there's no reason to not focus on repping, that advice is fucking stupid, also if you need to call for you fellow logi to overheat anything but the prop you should change said fellows. 
---
You will be overwhelmed the first couple of times and may very well fuck up bad, but that's true with every single mildly challenging task, it's normal and you shouldn't be discouraged by it. After the first few times it will become natural, the big thing is not to panic and if you don't know what to do use your keep at range from the main fc as an emergency "i dont know what to do im overwhelmed" button. If your guys get booshed well just tell them to go back to you, since the logi anchor's position is always a function of the fc's position you can't really go back and meet them halfway unless the fc does it too.
---
At the end of the day there's no need to overcomplicate shit and try to account for every single nuance now, do the cookie cutter shit, with time you'll figure out the ways to deal optimally with the finer points, but if you try to do all that while barely being able to rep and anchor all you'll manage is to die in a fire.
---
Moi je tank hull! :P
---
Frankly it was about as bad as the current timers, except it was all based on fleets of claws and other assorted fast ships running amuck trying to capture nodes because doing it with big ships took too long.
---
With the entosis sov you could sent a vulnerability window for a outposts and effectively timezone tank when the entosis nodes spawning how you do it now, though you'd at best you'd get a 3h window every 24 hours.  
---
If the attecker would win the 'entosis contest' there would be a 'reinforced' period of about 48 hours.  
---
The attacker would have to win the 'entosis contest' again to remove someone's claim on it.  
---
Instead of blowing up, the outpost would go into freeport mode for 48 hours when anyone could use them and they were effectively unowned.  
---
After that 48 hours, everyone gets to do the entosis bit all over again and winner takes control of the station.
---
If you want to go back further since we're comparing old pos mechanics, there's the Dominion sov way of handling stations:
---
\-Online SBU's on 51% of the gates, defend them for about 3 hours while they online.
---
Nuke the IHub's shields to reinforce it (while defending your SBU's)Nuke the Stations shields to reinforce it (while defending your SBU's)
---
SBU's and system structures go into reinforced along with the system for up to 48 hours.
---
Nuke the IHub's armor (while defending your SBU's)
---
SBU's and system structures go into reinforced along with the system for up to 24 hours.
---
Nuke the Stations armor (while defending your SBU's)
---
Blow up the IHub  (while defending your SBU's)
---
Capture the station by shooting it's structure (while defending your SBU's)
---
Fun fact: The defender could get the 'killing bow' on the station and recapture it getting a lucky last shot in.
---
Optionally:
---
Nuke the enemy TCU to unclaim the system.Online / Defend your own TCU took about 8 hours
---
Btw, I've slept a -lot- since dominion sov, so I may be screwing up a bit.

1) This answer is actually pretty complicated. You can play for about seven months before you hit the hard wall of progress as a f2p (alpha) account. However, you can purchase premium (subscription) time on the in the game market from people who purchased it as an object called "PLEX". So yes, if you discover a way to generate sufficient ISK, you could PLEX your account, and get the good stuff. It is also worth noting that several very good sources of ISK are very much avalable to F2P accounts. 
---
2) Yup. The majority of your progression is done over time. Your buddy will progress along side you. Your effort only generates ISK, which you can all share to have fun.
---
3) Use a referral link. Doesn't matter whos. It gives you nearly a month of Skillpoints (progress in the game) for free.
---
Any other questions you can DM me here, or in game and I would be happy to answer them. 
---
Good luck. Happy flying o7
---
That does not fall on "network security". It is an implementation choice.
---
&gt;And I do know the meaning of the quotes, hence why I disregarded them when yours didn't make sense.
---
If you knew, you wouldnt disregard them.
---
OP is in Panfam and the undock button is disabled by default when in a super.
---
NC. player with Initiative bait flare?
---
can just set a 30 minute shut down on your pc and go to sleep 30m earlier
---
The intent of the system is extraordinarily obvious.  Pretending to be so retarded that you can't understand it in the hopes of rules lawyering an extra alpha account isn't something that needs time or attention devoted to "clarification"
---
It just needs a simple but universal system.  Moons used to be the limiting factor, and because of the asymmetrical distribution it made things a bit more dynamic.  I posted it elsewhere in here, but constellation indexes that hard cap citadels weighted by the size of the structure works for me and also spreads people out more.  Place more structures than the limit if you want but face reasonabley severe risks such as WH timers and full loot drops., removed damage caps and long rf timers.  Make it restrictive enough to ensure null blocks can't have massive industry on the same grid as staging, give players an incentive to go shoot them with loot drops.  But still let attackers get a foot hold and if they manage to get a structure up under the limit they get the benefit for their achievement and see normal timers and the current RF windows and asset safety.
---
The siege cycle thing was easy, lots of poses, split fleet up if not being defended. I'd literally race fleets on who could kill / ref more sticks
---
You can't get a destroyer in there... that's why I didn't mention a destroyer lol.

Be in an alliance leadership position and you can make a crap ton of isk in a relatively short period of time.

Be a high-sec miner for 5 years and you wouldn't make the kind of isk that I can make in a month in null-sec.

Be a typical player that plays a couple of hours per day and even if you super rat which is one of the best ways, if not the best for a solo character to make isk, and you won't be getting a trillion isk any time soon.

posted my t1/2 worm fit above. Pretty damn cheap could be blinged easily (those are cheap t2 decayed abyssal mse's)
---
And i've seen people do up to t3's in well skilled/blinged hawks/retris but don't have the fits for those off hand
---
Now with rorqs and injectors, you just jump in 30 million titans, I'd take slowcats over what is now any day.
---
My word, i’ll be talking to you on jabber later for getting flair baited.
---
But don't see where dignity is lost. Tbh
---
Op success!
---
Apparently you can also just post on reddit to let him know.
---
Beautifully said
---
I thought it was possible in the fitting tool to view the ship, you can resize the image, rotate, zoom,etc... ffs learn to play the game.
---
Timers should be removed....

I'm sorry - do you want a central gate network allowing you to go across a region in 3 jumps?
---
Get it right, it is rock / paper / scissor / shoe
---
In my experience, not as much really. Mostly Texas
---
My employer throws out like 100 desktops a month, most with i5 processors and plenty of RAM to be scavenged.
---
It does not have remotely the same rendering (lighting, texture quality (look at the nag's wings if you don't know what I'm talking about), etc). It is also about 5% of the screen, so while I do see the whole ship it is pretty small and lacking. 
---
Thank you for at least trying to offer an alternative as sub-par as it was.
---
Still no.
---
It’s rock, paper, scissors, lizard, Spock

Why is a minmatar slave stealing Amarr ships and fits and making bad videos?
---
play's eve yeah it's one dude with 2 computers.
---
When you have roleplay space politicians, logic goes out the window.
---
Rock /paper / these nuts LMAO
---
You are majorly under-appreciate the new station lightning CCP put in a couple of expansions ago. Ships look awesome docked :D. Pretty hard to obtain the same result outside and outside is cold too. 
---
Thank you for trying to offer an alternative however scary it is.
---
Gottem

You're giving away my secrets.

please stop!

Cheers,

You can make the ship preview window as big as you want.
---
I could take a move op through a gate again if someone pays me ;)
---
one means CCP get's paid and the servers keep running the other means well CCP doesn't get paid and will shut down eve, plus a lot of people do grow out of there newbro corp at one point or another to go onto other parts of the game, like having the fleet basics down and navigating eve helps a lot when you join a smaller entity.
---
I do agree it would be nice if we could pan the camera under the ship. But you can pan up and around just fine. So all you're missing is the underside.
---
reeeee too powerful and will be used by those with big cap blobs to further entrench their dominance over other cap blobs.
---
Oh, I usually have my settings down to minimum to get maximum frame-rate and to reduce my PCs heat-output on hot days, was unaware of amazing lightning in stations.
---
This is why I brought up your eve play history.  'Solving n+1' is a fools errand that will kill eve.  The entire point of eve is that 'n+1' is a viable solution.  Someone who has been playing the game long, and in multiple styles, would have understood this already.  Your self described eve history is just a giant string of 'Farm ISK and kill pve'ers', with some well executed revenge in the middle I approve of.
---
You want to stop n+1?  Cap systems at 1000.  Cap deadspace pockets at 50, cap grids at 500.
---
Every other game from digital to board-game, stops 'n+1' with fake/artificial imposed limits.  Even right now eve has soft caps, like 256 man fleet caps.  
---
Then we get to the real meat of the issue.  Why is your hate boner on 'n+1' in the first place?
---
You multi box, bringing your own 'n+1' at high efficiency.  You fight the largest 'n+1' group in the game in-combat, successfully, and you still claim 'n+1' is too strong.  Not only this, you claim to make very good isk off of this activity.  Yet the enemy you farm is supposedly so strong they are ruining the game and need a CSM campaign specifically to fix it.
---
I bring up the past because there was a time when an Org like goons would have you perma camped out of delve via old mechanics.  No MJD cloak to jump out of bubbles, no nullified covert travel cynos, multi-bubble dictors, smaller grids, less perches, all of it.  And still you fail to see this, or even acknowledge it.  This is the type of slope that leads to Classic WoW having more interest in it than Retail WoW, the slow decay of decadence.
---
FWIF I listened to your entire CSM video with jintan, and you were not able to even elucidate your point.   
---
So I wonder... You just said in the above post:  
---
&gt;And I noticedd some game balance issues so I am running for CSM to help CCP to address those issues. But they are game issues, not Goon issues. The fact that Goons benefit from those doesn't make the mechanics balanced.
---
Can you elaborate?
---
&gt;TL;DR A New, larger, more expensive bomber/bomb type
---
COMPLETE FUCKING GARBAGE 
---
Will people stop fucking suggesting more burst damage?
---
&gt;Congratulations you just lost your entire capital fleet to a bombing run.
---
YEAH, THAT SOUNDS LIKE A FUN MECHANIC. Having your entire capital fleet of hundreds of billions vaporized in a 12 second bombing run by CRUISERS that can take Wormholes and travel near anywhere and everywhere.
---
Suggestions like these amount to nothing more that "Since CCP won't delete capitals, give me a tool to delete them for myself." All these retarded "just make a bigger bomb" ideas are trash and people need to stop thinking they've found the magical cure for cancer when they suggest "JUST DO MORE DAMAGE".
---
This \*really\* needs a longer clip to be appreciated because there is no way that should have worked - [https://clips.twitch.tv/CleverFastMallardTriHard](https://clips.twitch.tv/CleverFastMallardTriHard) :D   
---
Also Bjorn's laugh is the best.
---
I mean the solution to a GSF dominated CSM isn't to get a bunch of PL dudes in there, like really that leaves us with the same issue ( namely representing a uniform playstyle ).
---
Blob PvP isn't real PvP, change my mind.
---
I mean solo PvP to small gang---no more than 10 people.
---
For the nag, being so tall it is very bad trying to look from top.

---
My own opinion, but Horde should withdraw further into nullsec, go full Delve mode, and blops Darkness to oblivion. 
---
I dont see Goons babysitting Sort Dragon forever.
---
You can't get a **single** frigate in either can you?
---
He was talking fitting screen not preview. But the preview screen is truly horrible lightning wise. The skins don't even have the same colour...
---
Literally unplayable
---
This narrative is entertaining - especially since the CSM was actually effective at pushing decent / positive changes, just coincidentally heavy with imperium dudes.
---
upvote for visibility, my dude
---
&gt;so while plenty of dumbasses ran full stront the competent organizations would be timed expecting an attack in their enemy's prime time. It was the off-hours surprise attacks and timer kiting that made things interesting, not the max timer.
---
Yep this is correct.   
---
You would still see tz tanking to the defender's best timezone.
---
&gt;That was so rarely done, in my experience, as the defender was never around for the first attack.
---
Any larger org with a defined enemy had this.  In burning POSes owned by competent defenders, this happened most of the time.
---
Implying TAPI's interests don't align with goons...
---

No. That was mis-phrased. I'll rewrite it.
---
i owe you a 3 fedo for that tip!!! ty
---
It gives to little defensive play for the capitals as they're forced into a big ball by other mechanics and then punished for doing so. 
---
My personal favorite has been set capitals up differently: 
---
Dreads anti-capital platform ( they need a massive boost in alpha like anti-cap doomsday levels of alpha hell just give the ability to use anti-cap doomsdays in siege ), keep in mind this also means removing haws from them completely and nerfing the application to subs ( as they now have a clearly defined role and them applying to subs would break this massively ). 
---
Supers and carriers anti subcap platform, I really don't care how well the apply ( like somewhere where cruiser down is safeish ).
---
Titans Fleet support ships, so give titans more AoE tools in terms of utility I don't even mind them keeping AoE bosons no Haws and the capital gun application needs a nerf, o and a negative bonus to application mods. 
---
Faxes are fine under there current nerf
---
Now why this would impact the meta in terms of caps, now my 20 dreads can pop a super and die, this means if you consistently drop supers I can set up a counter drop regardless of how much support you have because my dreads will walk away with some kills on caps. 
---
This means supers and titan usage becomes a more calculated risk, so that if you drop a ball of titans and somebody is ready for it your gonna lose 1 or 2 of them, in place of if your the biggest your titans are gonna survive regardless.
---
Or you could use 1 radeon vii
---
Structure browser should only show you those you can dock in
---
10 isk
---
Yep, you can. you just have to make a fleet for yourself.
---
Except you don't see the stiletto warp in and cloak
---
you can still multibox two kidneys and two lungs
---
I was kinda shocked to find out my corp is ran by a couple, very nice people.
---
This has always been a thing - Goons versus "rest of eve".
---
The reasoning behind this might surprise you - it's because we think beyond the 'change' in question and consider all variable that are intertwined with said 'change'. The people who push for all these exciting \~*trendy\~* changes that will totally help the little guy! fail to look further beyond the immediate result.
---
**EXAMPLE:** Structures. Goons were well aware at the potential of structure spam before introduce to the game. We were all well aware of the over-zealous plopping down of un-removable sand castle empires - we tried to warn everyone and raised red flags. Guess what? No one gave a shit - *Goons were just crying* b/c NCPL &amp; friends decided to evict us from Deklein and plop down structures to advanced their offensives. The structures worked great and did amazing for the enemy - Gewnie tears were delicious! Structures are great!!! Now look where we are.
---
**EXAMPLE:** Carrier fighters. Goon were well aware they did wayyyy too much damage to subcaps. They were wayyyy too effective at removing the subcap menace from the theater. We tried to explain this would be abused. No one gave a shit - Goons were just crying b/c NCPL &amp; friends were exploding anything undocked in Saranen. Gewnie tears are delicious! Carrier fighters are great! Now look where we are - even with nerfs.
---
The list goes on. This narrative is old, worn out, and I guarantee if you took just a little bit of time to listen to some of the shit we recommend, and the consider that the stuff we say is dumb might actually be dumb, you might realize we know wtf we are talking about. Yes - Goons like ruining your game, but if there isn't a 'you' or 'game' to ruin then it's pointless. Our number 1 priority is to create environments where others can grow and become big enough they pose a decent competitive resistance against us. If you exploit your line members, suck shit at establishing an infrastructure for your dudes, skim iskies from renters then in our view you're the cancer that is stagnating this game. Retire and let someone else take over the throne, your members deserve better and an honest chance at defeating the evil \~*gewnies\~*. The changes these groups push are only temporary fixes to save their loan shark payday money lending space businesses until we have to illustrate how terrible they are by scaling them up and steamroll them into a shitheap.
---
How about just fucking listening and learning, we have better ideas on how to destroy us b/c our number 1 threat is ourselves, and the people Goons hate most is other Goons.
---
Until then enjoy us winning.
---
if you support omega account using alpha acccount but using  different computers/networks  it still falls under banhammer
---
it's mostly a joke, I get that couples play eve but well sometimes stereotypes exist to have fun with :)
---
Well turned out?
---
idgi what does this video have to do with NC or PL? 
---
You fought some dudes from Evictus in Goon staging, including an idiot untackled Tengu that didn't warp off.
---
Welp, that Mk2.5 is now on my kitchen table and runs great after installing firmware updates.
---
Ohh... that is a problem. They could just make the room bigger.
---
You may try your luck with support ticket under mission stuck or sth
---
No offense, but i installed eve on linux with the Euni instructions today. I think the Instructions are far from beeing dated. Depending on your OS you might need some libs tho ~ just run the client with logging and go from there - for me everything worked ootb tho.
---
The skins have the same color, they're just usually cleaner. Ships get dirty the longer you own them. If you click "Clean Ship" in your fit window where you pick Skins, then it'll go back to looking clean like the preview.
---
just do more damage lol
---
I doubt you're still reading these but...
---
1. How much longer do you think this game has in terms of lifespan?
---
2. How difficult do you think it is for a new player to come into the game without wanting to pay for a subscription in 2019?
---
They could have; at any time of their choosing. Thank your gods that they did not. I still miss my sister.
---
LOL you guys declared war and now you bitchin when you guy's loosing? there no so such thing is a fair fight bruv. if you are looking for one then play WOW ohh no fair fight there too.
---
This must be what the inside of a womb looks like to the swimmers😯
---
Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Mittens.
---
:golfclap: This may actually be the best post on r/eve that I've ever seen.
---
At some point it may become useful to you as a cyno alt or cloaky camper, then the name won't even matter.
---
i have server  with 128gb of ram four  quad-core cpus  intel.  no need  extra grapchic card.  i run  this server on linux but have also windows installation 
---
have liinux ubuntu also mandrake  and suse have also debian  for ssh.
---
as for windows.   win 7 win 8 installations both 64bit.  
---
if any1 wonders - server platforms for gaming  are useless,they can function for this but that is not their primary function. ..i can play eve on  my 128gb ram monster  but i prefer my  old   32gb  ram and ryzen 7 platform with geforce gtx 1030 .
