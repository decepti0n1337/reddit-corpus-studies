Serenity plays by the same rules (apart from botting) as TQ. If CCP doesn't want TQ to die for the same reasons, it needs to bite the bullet and nerf turbocrabbing, capital ships and provide mechanisms for smaller groups to perform guerilla-like operations against the large.

---
Under the current rules, eventually the big coalition will defeat the slightly less big, and there'll be one coalition that is bigger than all the others and can't be challenged, because only n+1 matters.

The spelling was just the icing on a long, stupid comment chain. Or at least I thought it was until you showed up!
---
Trusting people in this game is one of the joys of eve.
---
Did your sister have the experience playing her in order to make that comparison?
---
Yes yes we're all very impressed with how little you notice
---
yes, it is impossible to tell when people are having fun in eve: online
---
&gt; Did you fucking weirdos pay to send Elo to fanfest, too?
---
Wait, what?! This real?
---
Shut up Mack
---
This.
---
I recently started back up after a decade, and have already stopped playing, and I wholeheartedly agree with you.  I'm always game to hear stories about Eve, but actually playing it?  Not so much.
---
So what you’re telling us is. 
---
1. You’re a 39 year old halftard, who has a weird fixation on race. 
---
2. You’re dad is a sex offender. 
---
yeah, it kinda is when they don't talk to you or otherwise communicate
---
do you study the timing of their warps to derive their enjoyment level or something
---
I don't mean to sound like an asshole, but maybe you are in the wrong corp.

I’m done using  you pathetic fanboys. Now fuck off and quit bothering me! Lol fucking classic Elo. Take care see you on the battlefield when you come back Harry 07
---
Nice and a quick response you ***really do care!!!***...pathetic.

I would disagree on the last part, its more like 2% doing something, and 3% shitposting about doing something.

I'm not making a case for his/my world view but for the utter lack of any comical content

The market range skills said it but not industry/research. Despite it not being specified, they are still region specific.

Singularity?

BL achivement is higsec pirates daily bread.

Saying that EVE is play to win is like saying football is play to win because you can buy the ball and cleats.

Keep going I'm almost therr

it is if they don't talk back to you, how is this so hard to understand

That’s why they call them rogue drones bzzzzzt aye.  In Horde you can’t even rely on your drones not to be goon awoxxers. You should report that little shit so Nidia can purge it.

&gt; Elo, who had been going steadily more and more afk   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;But Elo was mostly afk during this time, off doing his own thing (probably a mountain of cocaine tall enough to need a ski lift).  
---
&gt; It increasingly fell to FCs in the alliance and others to lead fleets, but it just was not the same without Elo.   
---
&gt;Fleet participation fell dramatically
---
Huh, sounds like exactly as was predicted the last 1337 times hes come back and bounced, fucking over everyone who followed him and fell for the  "But itll be awesome!" line.
---
&gt; Fuck Elo for bailing on us without even a second warning. 
---
Its almost like when hes done this repeatedly, and EVERYONE says he will do it again, the people who fall for it look like sheep that could be outsmarted by a high sec miner.
---
a few kb per second \* thousands of accounts adds up fast. no it wouldn't cause game breaking lag on its own. but it still adds to the problem.
---
#HAHA!!!!!!!!!!!! U AND ELO SUXZZZZZ
---
I love the you just nerdraged over this but didn't explain racial spec which is probably the most common misunderstanding about drone damage.
---
You know, until the next time he shows up and somehow manages to trick dudes into making ANOTHER legion based alliance that implodes once the cocaine monkey starts climbing onto his back again.
---
I'm board and on a train you're just lame.
---
&gt;Such a shitty thing seeing a whole group fall apart like that
---
Again lol
---
Among 30k characters there bound to be some such people. Doesn't change the dominant culture. GSF right now is new players into a titan in less than a year kind of alliance.
---
Doesn't look like much for BL, was most of it in cash or just a limited grab? 
---
o7
---
Agreed, but sometimes old memes are fun like when BL eats shit!!!
---
Id say White Legion counts, he just decided to name the alliance after his favorite consumable.
---
Goons for Blood Raiders
---
several groups in Pure Blind for SoE and Mordus Legion
---
Guristas (Venal) and Angel (Curse) Epic Arc can be flown in tactical DDs, bombers, ceptors ....
---
sorry i didn't mean to be
---
Oof
---
Well yes, god forbid someone actually *works* for what they want they want out of this libertarian space paradise.
---
You're just not in the proper setting, join a different corp, try something different, live in a wormhole, try a new role in a fleet, etc.
---
Please don't breed.
---
I blame Hilmar's secret mining fetish.
---
So why are your harping on Elo being a bitch and his play style?
---
Absolutely lol
---
Ain’t gunna lie I was conned into rejoining Elo on that short comeback tour. I stuck around for about a month I think and went then back to brave (for actual content). But this and the other propaganda vid these guys made were and still are top notch.

Fuck Elo for bailing on us without even a second warning. **A lot of us burned our boats on the shore to come to BL, and you just fucking abandoned us. I should have listened, but I was blind. I hope you never come back to Eve again.**
---
I mean, GSF hasnt collapsed what, 3 times the moment someone stops logging in?
---
Black Legion and White Legion has.
---
HEY, don't blame us sheepfuckers, we're good, honest people.
---
Did you select your tag to describe Elo?
---
No there isnt, but if you're interested in trying to start one hit me up on the goon forums.
---
Don't project your lifestyle on us. It's not our fault you're scared to leave your basement.
---
Are the pvp mans bad? I don't think so. PvP remains what I do most in this game and that's really the operative word: "most" - it's not the only thing I do in this game nor should it be. It's a big game with a lot to do. Why shouldn't we do it?
---
Sure. It's a little weird you'd make the effort just to do that, but ok.
---
What's the drama with this guy? Someone fill me in? 
---
Nice. I've been to that one and we had a blast. 
---
Yes, generally that's how Reddit works. People type all sorts of things and submit them, the information then gets uploaded for people to read.
---
nice haul mate! 
---
Might have something to do with the learning curve, age of the game, or just being a very unique player experience.
---
Unless you are implying Eve has a particularly toxic community. If that is the case, please try a round of LoL, OW, or any game on xbl and report back how we stack up.
---
They have finished at least one, there was a kill mail floating around a bit ago. Couldn't say how the mechanics officially work but I am hopeful for the spam cleaning.
---
We have done one a couple times but havent had a reliable host to keep it going yet.
---
Your daddy.
---
Snuff is turning into the boogeyman to a degree, especially with the goon blob backing them up. The difference between the PL/NC boogeyman and Snuff/goon boogeyman is Panfam would shit on you, but if you were temp blue, they weren't going to fuck you over on a lark.
---
Anyone blue to Snuff has to be waiting for a knife in the back if the opportunity for a titan kill appears unfortunately.
---
&gt;retards
---
That, detective, is the right question
---
Ya, life is hard right. Lol
---
&gt; The allure of being in a BL reboot has to be weighed against the inevitable conclusion of dealing with the fallout, loss of assets, and lack of payment. Most directors and corps dont want to deal with that unless they are confident that they will get to loot the corpse and run.
---
Rofl. Spoken like a true goon with your eye on nothing but those sweet sweet in game assets. If you think literally anyone in BL is there because of the prospect of "looting the corpse", then you really don't have the slightest idea what BL is about my dood. No one gives a shit. Joining BL isn't about a calculation of gaining or risking isk.  You join BL to have fun and make friends. 
---
I need learn his secret, I too want to run an alliance while abandoning them multiple times and still being spiritual liege.
---
Awesome, Alfius throws a helluva party.
---
odds are he'll just never get accepted or trusted into a decent corp and will either biomass or leave the game after realizing isk is irrelevant nowadays. Well either that or he'll become like the judge, someone no one likes or trusts but it's just there coasting along.
---
I'm expecting a royalty check, otherwise I'm going to DMCA your video
---
Lets be realistic here. 80% of this subreddit didn't expect him to last more than 3 months.
---
Haven't played in like 1.5 years.  Just come here to shitpost and look at shitposts.  and I love the shitposts about eve.  Very different from the shitposts on wow subreddit
---
&gt;r/
---
A player called "Elo Knight" is a charismatic character with a reputation for being good at commanding fleets in Eve Online going back a long time. He runs an alliance called "Black Legion" (or White Legion once, when he was feeling particularly racist I guess) which invariably rises, dies and reforms when he is or is not playing. He plays furiously for a while, then he stops and the alliance dies, this is the latest death of Black Legion, same as the others. Memories are short in New Eden.
---
Let the attacker pick the day and the defender the time and you will see a lot less TZ tanking because attackers can now exploit it by taking a timer that is a weekend meaning the majority of folks can stay up late/ wake up early. 
---
Retrospect, in my instance it applied to both my Ex and to Eve pretty accurately.
---
Many have been here before;
---
2 60m+ toons makes me want to come back and I probably will - shit, Im on these forums cause Ive been contemplating exactly this lately.
---
10 years and 2 kids in marriage.
---
My sister was also divorced with 1 kid when she left her ex so there is that life experience to speak of.
---
She said what needed to be said and nothing more. 
---
Unlike you.  
---
I have a question, once you buy and train in the skills to pilot a ship can you keep using said ship after omega time is up? Ie the mining barge
---
HAHAHAHAHA!!! Fucking morons.
---
I care
---
Oh... was bl back again and broke up again?
---
*bored
---
I thought Bright side of death and fraternity we're friends. Today I learned.
---
I read your post and it inspired me. Thanks for the background info on this part of EVE history.
---
Do you need a red security mode to use them? 
---
&gt; Fuck CCP for killing this game with 2.5 years of patches that have ruined the game for anyone who isn't a turbokrab
---
This is what happens when you allow turbokrab alliances to fill the CSM who sways CCP on what changes are needed.
---
Even if that was true, it's absolutely generating pvp for someone.
---
For those afk citas, ok do it, but this is a aktive one I do my stuyy there day for day. I kill the Rats if I See them and stuff like that but that's just too much
---
We usually just have everyone trade the ore over to the corp and payout based on the corp mining ledger
---
Can somebody explain what happened first two times.
---
Calling someone a bitch once isn't harping lol. But you do you.
---
I wonder who was the profound idiot that thought that through. And I doubt that the stick your waving has any thing to do with the reasons they went through with that idea.
---
That is why I mentioned it. If I remember right Fweddit walked off with the wallet saying it was their just due or something silly like that and it fell apart within a week. 
---
Imagine unironically thinking elo would play longer than 2 weeks
---
Says the guy who's alliance lives out of a **fort** (EDIT: station) in lowsec
---
Because people don’t understand that people like mining/PI/trading/manufacturing, and that if there weren’t 10,000 toons mining and building they wouldn’t have all their cool ships to blow up.
---
That’s fine, at this point it’s easy to pay a sub, plex into one or two extra accounts and have a miner/hauler running while you fly around doing whatever you want.
---
&gt;Note: Due to recently discovered branch prediction vulnerabilities in certain Upwell Consortium Recursive Computing Modules this analyzer may also be used to collect sensitive information concerning reinforcement periods of Upwell Structures.
---
Indeed.
---
I remember that a lot of old Bovril bros went over to Black Legion during the great Circle-of-Two Jerk.  Wonder if I still know anyone over there.
---
Yeah that excuse seemed particularly flimsy
---
It hurt, we almost lost an Atron!
---
Those arbalests were the T1M4 launchers, right?
---
IIRC, they were more expensive than the T2s
---
AAR, Goons continue to farm Brave in both Catch and Impass.
---
In POS warfare the defender could pick they day AND time if there is enough stront. Assuming someone shows up quickly enough to restront it. Maybe increase the total stront on citadels so there is more leeway, but the attacker should have an opportunity to dictate when the defender has to show up
---
Big Atrons always come out on top
---
Because even their members believe it and are freaking out
---
Who?
---
Thanks for the content! :D
---
to be fair if CCP gave a shit about RMT they would put more effort into fixing the bots

Bruh link me how many fleet we welped the last 2 months since ur a scholar and all
---
Only downside from the fight imo was the fact they tried to headshot me. Knowing that I was the FC they turned their guns on me, which made the Apostle actually have to do something... Aside from that, there wasn't much of a threat.

---
Can't wait to see what /u/Haef_ has to say about this. 
---
That was fun listening to on comms
---
Not that I want to get rid of that Astra. It's pretty convinient. But you could blow it up on it's anchor timer and not let it finish onlining in the first place. 
---
Don't have to imagine, been to a few. Was like going to a industry specific networking event, where professionals meet to discuss shared interest. 
---
Do wh meets involve "Elite PvP" sword fights and other sexual activity? It's 2019, we will accept you the way you are, even if you are a 'holer.
---
I think the ones that get completely blapped by rats are ones where people don't even dock/undock.
---
Killing the rats is, I believe, only a band aid. There is most likely a Forward Operating Base (FOB) not sure if you can solo kill it or need to multi box logi (or with a group of people), but that should stop the annoying pings.
---

You sound like you don't understand how this works, every fleet you guys send is roughly double what we can muster. So we can outship you to even the odds or drop caps. Lately you don't bring small fleets you bring feroxes and battleships .. I saw a 100man Megathron fleet roll thorough. Pandemic horde and goons have large numbers .. we don't. We get a goon fleet come probably every hour or so, expecting us to form ( new goons btw) not the same people, often the same fc redline. We don't exist to form for you so you can bash a structure or whatever, even go to Impass and get helicopter dicked. The average goon who thinks we are being farmed has been a shitty no PvP line member for 2 months and now he's done a couple fleets,thinks he's amazing because of herd immunity and proceeds to shit talk. No one is impressed.
---
WORKING AS INTENDED!
---
you don't need people to talk to you to tell their mood
---
you get like 70% resist against disruption if I remember 
---
With enemies like goons, who needs friends.
---
there have been on going issue since they changed the chat. on top of all the other stuff the game is quite literally broken af. CCP going around like its 2005 and they can just blame it on dodgey internet.
---
it is apparently too hard for you to understand
---
Fuck if I know.
---
You want a Corp invite?
---
Bit more in-depth AAR:
---
Fleet #1: Goons formed a ~40-man Hurricane fleet and headed to Impass. Impass standing caught up with them near one of the gates into the Brave pocket of space and proceeded to murder them. Not too much to tell here.
---
Fleet #2: Goons, apparently suffering momentary amnesia, formed an 80-man battleship fleet. Threatening Brave's Catch Standing fleet that if we don't form something, they'll just head to Impass again and "take care of [our] ratters" (in the words of their FC). Not being able to counter a fleet of that scale on such short notice without dropping extravagant things (we *do try* to avoid dropping caps in Catch), they went on the same path as last time. We had eyes on them the entire time while Impass Standing prepared to drop yet again. We caught up with them a couple of systems away from 68FT. A cyno was lit and nearly the entire 80-man battleship fleet turned to cinders. It was genuinely awe-inspiring. The remaining survivors continued on into Impass proper and attempted to tackle a Rorqual. Impass Standing jumped yet again and pulverized the rest.
---
As we were de-aggressing and warping/jumping off the metric ass-ton of caps and supercaps, Catch Standing chimed into Impass comms that Goons have brought two caps into one of the systems directly neighbouring our main Catch staging of GE-8. At this point, we were all wondering what the hell is going on.
---
Fleet #3: Catch Standing had done a good job in keeping the two caps bubbled, subcaps were already whoring, when word went out to TEST. In sheer coincidence both Brave and TEST caps, uncoordinated at this point, dropped both cynos at the same time, and both anti-cap groups jumped into the grid simultaneously. Our goon friends likely regretted their life choices at this point. Especially the one with the 5 bil pod (I feel for you, mate).
---
Morals of the story: We try not to drop caps in Catch - *unless you do*; and Impass is a death zone.
---
Thanks for the awesome fights, Goons/Imperium bros! We always have a ton of fun with you guys!  
---
And the same to any group interested in reasonable fights, Catch is a great place to come for a stroll!
---
7o
---
Yup. A lot more then T2.  I think the T2 heavies we're about 3 mil at the time.
---
This was before tiercide, so they did the same damage as T2 ( with faction missiles), but had a ton better fitting.  Unless you had perfect fitting skills, you had to use them to fit a full T2 passive regen tank on a Drake.
---
They're super fun tbf, no pun intended

Dont ruin the fun
---
The yield on a rorq is balanced, just removed excavators from the game. They are broken, not the Rorq. T2 mining drones in a Rorq still pull in 2-3 t2 fit hulks worth of ore without having to offload.  
---
Mining has always needed a change but too many people like the semi afk aspect of it. Even in high sec people mine with orca. I honestly can't think of anything to make eve mining more active though.
---
We got away with it a lot more than once... until we didn't hahahaha

Coming from an actual racist, nice meme

Wait are you salty after goons drop double number of titans on Bombers fleet?

Asking for a friend

Yeah i saw he linked smthn and then deleted the comment lol 
---
whew
---
The fact someone with your (killboard) history (experience) is trying to speak with any sense of authority about the *tall entity known as Elo Knight*, Gigx, or how other people play this game is frankly, a hilarious fucking joke. Good troll, you got me. /s

oof dayum

he comes back

everyone fucking FARDS and SHIDS their pants and joins up
---
it disbands a few months later because elo burns out and or runs out of cocaine
---
repeat the process every once in awhile
---
Is this some type of bad dad joke
---
tell your friend I said no
---
and then they'd just place 3 more cause they dirt cheap.  and take a while to take out due to dmg cap
---
its easier to mine a new one with rorqs than it is to destroy it.  and faster
---
Yeah, I've not played for a while, but that was one of my fun things. Iirc a stiletto, with all the signature-minimising drugs and implants. Gave it something stupid like 30m sig with mwd was on, so even in a big fleet fight nothing could track you.
---
sending thoughts and prayers for your safe recovery
---
It's why I basically quit 2+ years ago. 
---
Excellent. Thank you for staying strong and keeping us informed.
---
If you spend it all then you go negative. I RMT'd a billion once ages ago and spent it all, then when CCP took the isk I went negative. I was dumb, but luckily it didn't take me too long to get back into positive isk.

because they're subhuman filth who contribute to the cancerous risk averse gameplay that we have today and encourage CCP's stamping out of as much actual risk or diversity as much as possible in favour of higher revenue from bots and renter vermin.

If brave arent pets of test then surely if I hit ctrl+f and search TEST i wont any results on this page right?

You're joking right?
---
Come back laz.
---
I was actually talking too my brother earlier about that exact thing, flying damp ships now. I just wish the nerf wasn't so much against the rook and widow. Sure I can blops on now and mjd out to a safer distance. But I can't do much about being singled out and have 5 or 6 friggs burning to me at 4/5kms. I can't mjd away again before they get to me. It's just a change I wasn't expecting to be so drastic haha.
---
 I knew I would be down voted pretty hard, but we all have the privilege of voicing our thoughts. Eve is a great game, best pvp adrenaline out there imo.

That's a copypasta, fren

current state: low patience for poster with poor reading comprehension
---
Seems like all "praised" "good" FC's are always rated better the more of an ass they are. I can't count the number of times I heard guys praise an FC for shreading some poor guy on comms.
---
Also how some FC's basically never associate with the "dirty masses" and they only show up to command fleets, treat people like shit, then log off and go play something else till some scheduled ping. 
---
yikes
---
you did it, you said the meme
---
I'm not entirely sure what you mean... There are 11 TEST members in that BR, not 2. And yes, TEST helped us out with the two caps that dropped  in Catch. Though with what we had on grid, it was severe overkill ;)
---
Whooooo boi

Whew with you around I'll never have to go buy salt at the grocery store every again!

Ummm, not sure if troll or if you are actually mad, its not a big deal when Goons bring a big fleet through we can't form for, either because of numbers or ship type.  If we cant form, we don't, we usually make it known if we will or not, and goons are actually pretty good about it.  They may camp a gate or ping a structure to try to get a response, but why not, they just want to blow shit up like we do.
---
In my experience, Redline has always been pretty good about fleet fights, there has been the occasional headshot, but that happens on both sides, so no worries.
---
It's all just space pixels, I for one am glad to shoot goons in our current situation, the content is good and constant.
---
Chill bro, we be blowing fake spaceships up.

toxic, not as bad as LoL or what not.  Eve players are quite friendly and helpful.  however, the EVE player base is very much racist, misogynistic, and antisemitic.  Which sure, exists in most other playerbases, but here it is celebrated.

Would you prefer a style of game play where you don't have to have isk or build thing? In not trying to be condescending or an asshole, genuine question.

Ours or yours? We TRY not to, like really hard (believe it or not) because Catch standing doesn't care much for a cap blob that wipes out their gud fite. Sometimes one of our guys will yolo in one, sometimes one of your guys will yolo in something subs can't break so it's kind of a case by case basis.

😘
---
I'd be that salty too if I lost that badly.
---
Yea, that used to happen, only never in the racist context and always in the common usage of a word.  That doesn't make it ok, but its a pretty important distinction to clarify how fucking stupid you are.  Its also extremely common knowledge as to why it stopped 7 or 8 years ago.|

Like people in our alliance also don’t use the word nigger or kike in a context that isn’t only racist. You’re right, it doesn’t make it okay, but this is literally the pot calling the kettle black. Your brain is too addled to make that distinction, just like the goons that can’t discern ‘beep beep I’m a jeep’ from the vile rat posts. Spewing bullshit and calling everyone retarded make for a great conversation though

Oh and just fyi, you've stated you know its not cool, and when me and others came to that realization we stomped it out in PL everywhere we found it, you're not doing that.

Nobody in your corp is doing that.

Conflating past behavior with current and using one to condone the other is a bullshit whataboutism.

the difference with us is that we don't just sit around and krab krab krab, we are almost always on deployment as opposed to sitting in Delve and singing Kumbaya

---
you can only fly the ship around if you were logged off in space when your omega expires. 
---
when you log in, all the omega modules are offlined and any skill dependent stats are as if you had no skill (eg if the ship gives a resist bonus per level of the racial skill to fly it, you don't get any bonus). As soon as you dock up you're unable to undock until you leave the ship.

you could pick within like 48 hours give or take, that's mostly a time pick.

We thought you must have run out of boosters from the way your tank suddenly collapsed. But after we saw over 1,000 3200's in the wreak, we figured you had hit reload on both boosters at the same time, or had messed up with not enough cap boosters to reload properly.

---
So here's what would probably happen, emphasis on probably because I'm not an FC and I don't make these calls. You'd yolo in your dred and start vaporizing subs, mostly lemmings who'd feed to you and not be on comms, etc... Catch would try to put something together and come at you, if they couldn't break you they'd either disengage or call for capital back up. That's more or less what happened in this kill, in which our feroxes engaged an active Phoenix, couldn't break it, and we dropped. https://zkillboard.com/kill/74028352/

You need to get Scooter to form periodic tribunals to discuss their failings as a captain leading to the loss of their vessel and crew. If they’ve been found to be incompetent they should be forced to perform Ariana Grande songs as penance and attend a fleet in a rookie ship before they get their SRP.

Since CCP is now owned in part by a southeast asian company, this doesn't at all surprise me that they're banning people for using VPNs.

All we are ever told is to train alts and grind structures in AUTZ. When we actually get to use alts for not grinding structures it makes us happy in our pants. 
---
Ok but you're lying.
---
Are you the one that is high? I said they wouldn't meet the current requirements, that they were grandfathered in. You know, exactly what you just said. 
---
Sure i did, the last great thing I did for that alliance was to make sure you weren't in it.
---
It lasted for about 2 dumb super kills before the constant tackle bridging in to catch his fleets kind of ruined any good gameplay he could get.
---
You know what...  I'm actually starting to agree with the remove supercaps idea.  Or neuter them in some way that makes them a niche ship.
---
That'd still leave us with the dread bomb, but...  Maybe remove all caps?
---
&gt; Last 3 years it's been "drop your own supers". And GSF right now is a new players into a titan in less than a year kind of alliance.
---
Totally not a contradiction. Goons want to win in game, no matter how stupid or busted the mechanics are. But at the same time tell CCP the truth that their supercap balance is terrible or the T2 industry makes technetium a giant bottleneck or whatever. Remember, not here to ruin the game, just your game.
---
The Serbs still in? Last time I played my character was in darwinism, ya'll invited me because my father is Serbian. 
---
So because the character posted earlier is not some small gang PvPer it means I don't know that gigX and Elo are not content creators? One day you will learn how fights happen. It isn't because some FC undock and hurr durr let's kill people.

could you explain how corp with 50 characters have 1/2 of kills corp with 700 did?

Sounds like you got the right idea man! The HML Caracal like Warga5m said, or you can use rapid light missile launchers. Level 2 missions should be easy in a cruiser, so a large shield extender should be fine if you don't feel like managing cap. PM me if you got more questions, happy to help!

Another fascinating piece of Eve history, thank you for sharing, even though I could understand only parts of what you were saying ( I only started Eve a short while ago ). Surely it forms another chapter in this amazing story of "Eve Online". Its this sort of thing that drew me to Eve in the first place.
---
Just a couple of things I would like to ask.
---
&gt;Fuck CCP for killing this game with 2.5 years of patches that have ruined the game for anyone who isn't a turbokrab
---
What is a "turbokrab"? And how did the patches ruin the game for anyone who isnt a turbokrab?
---
&gt;It was there where I got hooked on burner mission cash, easily making 1-1.5b an hour with less upfront cost than a faction battleship
---
What is a "burner mission"? How would an alpha noobie like me work towards eventually doing them?
---
In context, White Legion was overtly racist, that was the joke. I am not making any judgements about it because I was part of it despite the racist overtones of the alliance itself.
---
I agree, being white and all.
---
But you're not now right?
---
wtf why did this 20 man corp call for help vs 1000+ man alliance that cap drops
---
&gt;What is a "burner mission"? How would an alpha noobie like me work towards eventually doing them?
---
High value missions that pit you against a single faction frigate that is highly dangerous to fight, can pay 21k LP a mission. You can run them solo or run them in squads, solo is easier if you can't multibox but squads are faster but need more alts. The value really comes from the LP/isk exchange rate; the highest values can be found in nullsec pirate faction corps, but hisec is safer and less prone to blowing up.

This isn't a ruse Brisc. It's over. There's nothing left.
---
&gt;We try not to drop caps in Catch
---
Well our sendoff fleet for Elo says that was a fukin lie
---
that' not the players' fault tho, greed and hoarding crap in games is human nature. look at every other mmo out there, the farm vs pve ratio is many times more farm favorite than it is in eve. as long as ccp allows it, players are gonna do it. spam more titans, spam more citidels, more rorqual alts, etc etc. it's not surprising in the slightest, this is how people are. and more titans and more rorqs and more farm toons of any sort means more subs + more extractors cause waiting to train skills in 2019 lul so there you go.

They have been doing that in the system I hang out in for the past week. 3 little ships that shoot at a station with like 2 seconds left on the timer. Had enough of it one day and killed them only for them to respawn about an hour later. Found it odd that they don’t really do any damage to the station, just sit there and keep the timer running.

---
*wow, goons took supers to.... WAIT*
---
  Also goons crying about supers, how deliciously ironic.
---
Terrible for PVP but pleasant laziness for PVE to not be jammed out of some missions.  Of course, jammers in missions encourage refitting and skilling to learn to deal with the problem.  This dumbs down that problem and supports the one ship fits all missions doctrine.
---
PVE ECM could've been dealt with differently by adjusting jamming ranges and strengths in individual missions.  We already take the time to learn damage types for tanking and DD and adding ECM complexity would have been interesting but they prob decided it became too complex.  An ECM-focussed Epic Arc might've been interesting but now there is no need.
---
In missions, the jammer simply sets itself (as OP points out) as primary.  So, the changes don't enhance ECM-related gameplay but rather remove it and simply change targeting order.
---
Fair call and interesting point OP, wonder if CCP will reconsider this change.
---
Please do!

All I see here is excuses

---
&gt;groups like Rooks and Kings are widely loathed among the EVE community
---
... ?
---
&gt;and in the recent conflict INIT had widespread popular support 
---
lollered my copter right into the stratosphere with that one.
---
I might try to make that one too. It'd be good to actually see some players in person.
---
Hey you...  I see what you did there... 
---
Weird, I don’t seem to lack access to other games and the like and I read it perfectly fine. Also, wash your mouth out with soap you uncivilised scrub. :P
---
You might as well use a stratios at that point.
---
I'm not defending him or anything but getting on your high horse and saying that you can't be a good FC if you don't log in everyday is silly. An FC is just a spacejob, not a commitment. 
---
He is a pretty great FC, but he is super cyclic with his play time.
---
This is what has happened every single time.
---
Everybody wants to fly with Elo, nobody wants to put in any real work, Elo burns out, everything falls apart. 
---
wew lad
---
Hahaha this is great what a bunch of suckers
---
Being an alpha clone (free account) has its disadvantages but most groups will make accommodations for them, giving them special, low skill level ship fits to take on fleets. You can still be extremely useful on fleets if you're an alpha clone, and you can even win some fights in small gang and solo PvP with enough (ingame) skills. Also, if you want to sink time into something with a slow but satisfying reward, Eve is the game for you.
---
Eve-O preview. 100% free
---
HEY. I'm still here Hans. We still have each other.
---
but then people wouldn't jump instead of bridge
---
that's half the fun
---
good night, sweet prince
---
Lol it's been years since I've played this game, I'm curious about one thing though. What is a turbokrab?
---
Imagine posting that there’s a free titan kill and thinking people won’t just cap ball drop you
---
NPCs spawn in asteroid belts btw
---
Love the [Simon Stålenhag](http://www.simonstalenhag.se/index.html) desktop!
---
never not drop everything on PL
---
We’ve been trying to bring smaller fleets and the like but I feel we’ve been farming too hard and Red agrees. He’s a great FC. So I’ve asked if we can farm other regions more to give Brave a break.  The result is we are now farming other areas a lot harder instead. I guess having us show up every hour is gottta be annoying.
---
kiloalpha isnt known for making great decisions
---
Or that they havent left impass on their own ever.
---
Redline is a good fc always trying to make things fun. Was in one of his fleets on New Years Eve, came to GE in a procurer fleet and started mining in the small anomaly. Brave didn't form (seemed to be a TZ thing), but Simple Farmers showed up and bombed us at least twice. That was totally unexpected, but still had fun. 
---
Lol. U mad bro?
---
There’s about 25% that can actually pvp. 50% that are okay at fleet pvp and the last 25% are farmers with pitchforks on our fleets. But with so many numbers it really doesn’t matter. A bit like Russia during the Second World War, we just keep coming at you. We are called The Swarm for a reason.
---
&gt; INSU leaving would be a pretty heavy blow to the alliance
---
This is how you know this is a meme
---
It actually was fun, the fleets against gotg were a blast, and the time I spent roaming in delve is probably the funniest I've had in eve so far. Now I cant speak for everyone but to me that's the most important thing
---
Goonswarm has always been a 50%/50% type alliance though. Even when I’m out fighting on a fleet in combat I’ll be mining on an alt at the same time. That’s like 90% of the membership. 
---
There’s even a group of us in Goons called Scarebears because of this observation.
---
Sure there’s probably a few amongst us that are purely PVE types but they’re not the majority.
---
Well atleast we made up for my Kronos losses!!!
---
I still day dream about eve years after I stopped playing every 6 months or so this sub hypes me to the point that I log in and play about for a week or so before remembering what it's actually like
---
This is the natural progression of Eve Online. There's safety in numbers and the small groups eventually get absorbed by bigger groups. In the end there will be one or two blocs and the status quo will be locked in. 
---
CCP changes hastened it but we were always headed towards a single entity or Bloc becoming too big to beat.
---
Authy &amp; LastPass…  for casual users these apps are lifesavers 
---
That you're a trashcan human being who makes excuses and white knights for your racist cocksucker friends.
---
indeed it was ;p
---
Yeah but that takes time and commitment to set up. Good people who are willing to put in the work and not fuck you over don't come from nowhere. 
---
Manufacturing is actually pretty involved and is quite fun. It’s more a slow game though so a bit like cricket rather than fast paced action. The challenge is to build stuff ad clear your bottlenecks by finding or making sub resources/components.
---
Shooting lasers are rocks by itself is dull but that’s a means to an end.
---
If a kill right is used and the ship destroyed, that is the end of that kill right, correct?
---
You guys are good training for newer fc's. Appreciate the content :)
---
I gotchu fam all you have to do is follow the damn train
---
r/dualuniverse is coming...
---
Re-reading that I can see that now.
---
My apologies.
---
Had the exact same thing happen to me today... Weird.
---
White Legion is a reference to some racist group from a long time ago
---
I once figured a market but out.
---
Reported and he was gone three months.
---
Three months I ran that market wild! 
---
I don't know anything about Elo's motivation behind the Alliance name "Black Legion" you would have to ask him. 
---
Is it possible for Canadians to be racist? I don't even know.
---
I don’t live out of a fort (edit: station), sorry m8 don’t be mad 
---
 But how often do we get to do big supercap battles? This year was the first on any big scale in years.
---
The ticker started as "1488" a well known code for racist things, then either CCP or someone else had it changed to CAUC. I don't remember if they had to make a new alliance or if just the ticker changed.    There were some people that were mighty uncomfortable about it and the corp I was with dropped a few members because of it.
---
np we have fun too
---
We're dying again*
---
I also see a few results of PL and Goons, are they pets of test too? Maybe we're all pets of PL?
---
Thank you for the silver!
---
Time is a flat circle
---
No, not in corps. Or at least I dont think so since half the bloody corp mails I get seem to be people going "Yeah, I'm selling this account, dont trust my character in the future." You might get scammed with the person claiming the account back with 2FA after payments are made, though. 
---
Playing Prey.
---
Correct, unless players then have a limited engagement timer with one another. This'll be a blueish timer
---
Like it’s 2018 guys. Anything white is racist.
---
I am not complaining about Elo here. I didn't know him. And I am not talking about calling out an obvious mistake that gets a fleet killed or something like that. I've seen some flip for no actual reason. 
---
Reverse Ticker Tanking in today’s day and age.
---
Imagine getting flair baited this hard
---
But it's 2019
---
&gt;Half
---
That's being generous
---
I’d expect that corps would be fine with it (mine would).
---
So now you're throwing the "you're making excuses" line. Nice! Glad to know your 'common use' of the word nigger *wasn't* an excuse for your racist behavior. But my statement of 'other people can say racial epithets' *commonly* without racial intent IS an excuse. They're the same statement. You've drank so much coolaid you're drowning in it, Grath. You're believing your own lies.

Oh man you should see /r/Canada. DurrHurrDurr(/u/AbsoluteTruth) is a mod there and doesn't do any actual modding, keeping shit disturbers unbanned.
---
There was a thread talking about going to war with china, and people advocated for internment camps for Chinese - Canadians (again). I'm like buddy they have nukes and we don't, plus you're like literally hitler.
---
No permabans in that thread.
---
I got downvoted for pointing out how fucked up that was. The genocidal dudes got upvoted.
---
It's a shitshow,, there are protesters in Alberta adopting the yellow vest and mumbling anout secession before we even implement Trudeau's carbon tax. Ths sub reveres them and is generally racist af.
---
Even IRL I see a lot of casual racism in Toronto. The police just had a report saying that "random" stop and searches were 17 times more likely to happen to black people. The part that cracks me up is that same report says the practice "still has some value as a tactic". There are also lots of people irl or on that sub who will say every opportunity to say just the worst shit aboit natives.
---
What Corp is that?

Also give the bridge a spinny circle thingie
---
The reason why people do -10.1 or even -100.1 instead of -0.1 is so you think it's -0.1 by looking at the last digit and waste your cool-down editing the order by only editing it to -0.2 yourself.
---
So no you didn't find a bot you just found a common trick for the kind of people who stay on their computer all day point one ISKing orders. 
---
You're just a side character waiting for the protagonist to come to you, bringing the drama along with them.
---
I changed it, because I was uncomfortable with the ticker.  BL is the racist group from a long time ago, WL was literally just a play on words from Bene, who wanted White instead of black.  That intro video he made said it all tbh: [https://youtu.be/548Ci-EwNEY](https://youtu.be/548Ci-EwNEY)
---
The Thunder Struck one has pretty much been banned because of the AC/DC tune, sadly.
---
BTW- Alien Affliction is recruiting.  :)
---
I'm not here to say the guy is or is not a bot, but at least when i did market trading 4 years ago and used the market tools of the day you could set a custom price adjustment as you rapidly editted your orders using the clipboard and the export to file option. Its very common still I'm sure.
---
Only when you're blue to your neighbors.
---
Legacy Code
---
&gt; No permabans in that thread.
---
We ban a ton of people, but there's an ongoing issue in the subreddit with brigading from far-right groups that's made it a struggle to stem the tide. If you actually saw comments saying shit like that report them, that's an easy permaban.
---
Elo didn't make Black Legion, a fellow named Faekurias did.  He was Swedish, and the racist thing was his joke initially.  The original corp was Black Legion Command, and then from there Black Legion, the alliance was born. 
---
Thanks Susan, it was a few years ago now and my memory is bad. Was a hell of a lot of fun, I have no regrets :)
---
Well ... who doesnt.
---
Personally, I love playing this game, at least when something interesting is happening. This is why I stick with a major alliance and have discord up and log in to be an F1 monkey whenever shit goes down, and I have a lot of fun. But for me with all games, I tend to binge one or two games hard and then stop playing for months, and that's exactly what I do with Eve.
---
CCP got the killmail?
---
Yeah, very easily done with evernus
---
Ideally different areas would be better at different kinds of things. Better mining in some set of regions (with a smaller set being best) and some better at ratting and some better at something else (WH spawn rate or something more creative). 
---
Diversity. Imbalance. Give everyone a throne to knock someone else off of.
---
Someone could just make a github repo and people could post issues there
---
Ok Billy no mates

There are a couple dozen of us who aren't weakwilled enough to bow to become a faceless number in an impersonal machine. Our sandcastles may be small, but war and profits are guaranteed, and content is always available if you're willing to find it.
---
Guess that's what happens when a cancerous group establishes dominion over resources. Their greed is guaranteed, and therefore their addiction to krabbing is guaranteed.
---
I love DHD, so it's a bit of a conflict for me but if you see racist shit on another sub you frequent and don't report it, you can't bitch about it later. Mods can't catch everything, that's why the report system is there.
---
You don’t sell accounts, you sell characters. Once the character is changed accounts and as long as you’ve followed all the guidelines in the Character Bazaar then getting scammed isn’t really an issue.

You exist solely to line Mittens' pockets. Faceless drone in an impersonal machine.

Krabs building and amassing super fleets due to the excessive production of the Rorq leads to a stagnant game. Everyone's so turbo wealthy because of the broken Rorq that inflation has stopped having any meaning. There ain't enough isk sinks for the number of Rorqs in this game today

Are you in a wormhole Corp already? If so, ask your corpmates.

If your leaders are too fucking stupid to recognize the only talent you had in your greasy circlejerk of a Clusterfuck Coalition, they will continue to stagnate into inefficacy 
---
Thank me later
---
Elo fc'd a fleet literally 28 hours ago in highsec btw.
---
He was in RLLO for a bit after we split from Sky Fighters. He had a strong personality and there were some ... frustrating differences of opinions .... but no other issues/complaints.
---
Rest in Peace and and condolences to his family and friends.
---
If u have human brains u won't place orders lower in price on a regular basis, as a script do
---
so if the side that brings smaller ships gets dps/tank/whatever bonuses when engaging larger ships. effectively leveling the playing field between the ship sizes, then what would be the point of ever flying a larger ship?   
---
just only ever fly cruisers then.
---
Brigading is bad. 
---
Fag.
---
If you're going to spend the money, you should look into skill injectors. They could be more efficient, or if not, you can build out the character the way you want. I cant be fucked to do the math but it's another option.
---
Kirkland? CLASSY AF!
---
Any market bot worth their salt has a floor and ceiling price as a sanity check, to make sure exactly this doesn't happen.
---
Thankfully this guy seems to be retarded
---
What makes you think I didn't report it?
---
there is more than one way, only issue is explorers tend to warp out specially if they see something that can easily kill then, a fun fit you can try is a bait heron. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ir910TNwcdw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ir910TNwcdw)

I'll avoid trolling like I usually do on here and be honest with you my dude, I don't actually think most goons are Hardline Krabs, but I do think pubbie is an apt term, as it is for most people in eve and probably even myself.
---
Sorry, but there is no real loss of talent with them leaving.
---
GSF is stagnating into inefficacy? We just kicked the shit out of the entire North. You should probably buy a dictionary.
---
RGSU killed less Supers and Titans than other corps in GSF, so that argument is hilarious.

Those rokh fits are abysmal

You need to understand not everyone in goonswarm is a blobby meanie, some of us like to try solo, even though it ends up like that. By the way that is me. And incase you think I am bullshitting here is the recording of me [eating shit:](https://youtu.be/h7YwkuFQXuQ)

---
Indeed. I'm subscribed to this sub just because of it.  It interesting to read all the news and rants but I prefer playing something else (anything else actually) than eve. 
---
nobody cares if you buy a  new character or inject SP in to a character. in fact, people would rather you do that and fly the right ships than bitch and moan about your lack of SP and how long it takes to train things.
---
also, there's a bazillion corps dedicated to hoovering up new players. any of them would be more than happy to have yet another warm body snuggled in amongst their ranks.
---
That's a bitter title for an otherwise fun event.
---
R64 are moons with really good moon goo. Less sure about burner missions but most likely some way to run missions.
---
Dock up then, might be a nanogang in disguise.
---
'RGSU killed more supers/rorqs than most ALLIANCES last year'
---
Also, they hunted most of their own. not just killing supers/titans in massive tidi/major battles. 
---
Stick to pushing paper, you are literally dumb as shit.
---
You would in a low volume market where someone just massively undercut you and you don't have the capital to buy them out. I've been forced to cut half my margin away on manufactured goods because I got undercut so hard and just couldn't buy them out since I didn't have enough money.
---
literally fit missiles a prop mod and some tank. Also missions suck
---
ED is instanced, no guarantee that you will run into your buddy / enemy if you enter the same system at the same time. 
---
Gotcha
---
just delete their shitty rusepost threads if they wont stop
---
This. Hop in a fleet. From incursions to bombers bar/spectre fleet. Find a group of people you like to play with. Playing alone sucks. (i'm doing it right now waiting for my app into TEST/Dreddit to be approved or denied.) I've come back from an eve break and all my old friends have quit. So I'm trying to find a new group to fly with. This is a social universe. If you aren't happy with the content you have, go looking for a group that does something that you enjoy from pve to pvp there has to be something out there that you haven't tried yet. Until you've tried it all you can't claim that there is no fun to be had.
---
Ive had more fun playing eve since I quit last year.
---
I would !redditsilver you but they took away the bot and monetized it so all you get is an updoot. 
---
lot of hater trolls in this thread bro
---
Not according to Zkill. Literally most of theirs were part of other ops. You have no clue what you are talking about at all. The very few people in RGSU being kicked will have zero impact on the operations of Goonswarm Federation.
---
5 members in SV, no other Sigs other than someone in Heal Team 6. If you guys are not going to participate, why are you here? Oh yeah, we have great krab space for you guys.
---
The Supers and Titans killed in the big fights? That was because the large corporations and other Alliances of the Imperium that carry you guys did their job. Meanwhile, you guys literally got kicked for refusing to pay a small fine. Fucking hilarious.
---
I got that feeling when the t3d gang I was playing with in a t2 logi frigate nailed down a Niddy near Tama. Nothing beats that "WE SURVIVED" rush. 
---
Bandicam and then the typing in notepad. Shit this brings me back
---
the idea was not to level equally but enough so the smaller side have at least a chance to fight and come out victorious where the fight is decided on skills/exp of the fc and his fleet members rather than dumping a shit load of titans and supers and end the fight that way.
---
better not call him that or you get banned
---
I mean it is tr0pa. Theyve been like this for what, years?
---
It is always a possibility he ripped them all out
---
&gt;So my sugar daddies raped my wallet wider than a titan.
---
wait what
---
Ya go with those its just easier but as you gain sp you dont get the full sp boost from a skill injector. I dont remember what the sp it is when it tappers off. Look that up before you inject.
---
Yea I just bought the "absolute injection augmented to prevent diminishing returns
---
Juvir you know the only reason that req isnt in the shitter is because test and brave are there.
---
remove rorqs
---
No rorqs = less titans/supers in production

Dunno bro, I had forgotten my subscriptions on for 8 months while travelling without internet, and when I got back they credited all my toons with SP, and all they asked in return was not to sell them with unallocated points (this was pre injectors). Pretty nice of them, imo
---
Why mention  Eigenvector Centrality at all in the graph?  It's an interesting tool for analyzing a network with intentional social interactions, but in the case of pvp, there is no attempt by individuals in the region you are looking at to control this factor.  It might be a good tool for analysis in sov null, but in a region of low sec, the vast majority of interactions will be players roaming looking for fights with little care about who the fight is with.  
---
Also, why treat pvp as a social interaction at all?  Many fights involve little in the way of interaction between players, especially in low sec.  Wouldn't an examination of publicly available chat channels and corporation/alliance/coalition relationships be much more fruitful?  
---
An adorable newbro that thinks 180mil is a lot of isk would be my guess :)
---
Perfect. I forgot what skill it was but you dont want to have it, it makes the effect of those plug ins to be longer. Usually thats good but it means you can only do 3 injectors every 30 hours instead of every 16
---
there is only so far that will go though. overwhelming firepower and overwhelming numbers is a valid tactic, and its not like its even anything new. before goons it was PL/NC dropping their caps on anything larger than a cruiser, and even going back to the very early days of the game it was BoB. and a competent FC and competent pilots can still pull off wins they wouldn't otherwise be able to, cruiser gangs can already kill battleship fleets even outnumbered if used right and if you bring the right doctrine.
---
only difference is that now, instead of only the ultra-rich "elite" groups being able to swing their titan dicks around. just about any group with enough dedication can build a super-fleet.
---
supers and titans aren't any more of an "I win button" now than they ever where before. just more people have access to them.
---
and even in capitals you still see regular caps going toe to toe with supers. Test has regularly won the isk wars in oij against panfam despite panfam bringing supers and titans and test mostly fielding carriers. and the long established best way to take out titans and supers is to use dreadbombs.
---
What your suggesting can already be done, and without needing some sort of super fiddly damage multiplier (that I can only imagine people would figure out how to manipulate the hell out of)
---
all good now :)
---
Don't let your memes be dreams!
---
No one will care, if they do they're idiots. Just make sure you buy it through legit means (with isk on the ccp forum)
---
In what universe did init have wide support?
---
Eve is the game you play while you are playing other games...Even when we are playing Eve Online, are we really though?
---
BTW, ffs people use elinor or evernus. Don't giving slash prices by a mill because you're too lazy to type it out. Unless you are manipulating the market that is
---
I do get it's great for people to use the big toy they have but it's also is a very much one sided experience.
---
Make sure you're not buying it in a kick-out station. If you're not in a hurry, you could look opportunistically at capital LS chains you get, and check for dreads on market in range of it every time. Otherwise, just buy one whenever and move it into the next LS you get. 
---
When you are moving it: 
---
* never take gates
---
* use DOTLAN to determine how to get to a system
---
* on each jump, light the cyno first, then undock and jump immediately
---
* don't dock in kick-out stations
---
* light the cyno more than 5km away from the station model, so you don't bump
---
* light the cyno more than 5km away from the edge of the docking range, so you don't spawn outside the docking range
---
* always jump from station to station
---
After you get to your wormhole, I'd suggest using a webber to get you to warp faster, as well as a cloak and probes in case of emergency.

Damn.....this feels pretty low :(

You can jump into the wormholes and run the sites there. More dangerous, but one haul would be paying for 10 more ships.
---
As alpha, consider fitting 2 relic rigs, so that the minigame becomes easier.

I'm pretty sure excavators don't even surpass 3x hulks.

Oh wow, you guys got on some kills.  SO DID THE REST OF GSF you ignorant fuck lol.

Tbh we were in this position before rorqs came along; the biggest super fleets are effectively invincible to anything other than a bigger superfleet.

Since we're past the point of no return already on proliferation, we may as well let more people into the "people who matter" club with 40b titan hulls.

I'm sorry I value real money over ingame space money. Don't even try to act holier then everyone else you would also cash out if it meant that you could pay rent for a year.
---
Shh don't ruin his elite narrative...
---
I haven't really player Eve for about a week or two, my friends called me to pvp a group the other day "for 10 minutes", and I stayed for 6 hours hunting w/o breaks. 
---
I hate Eve and I love Eve. I probably have issues.
---
I love a good flop
---
Ahh, neat! I didn't know that part. Sounds like it should be totally fine for the OP to do, then. 
---
I was going thinking the same thing... a shame that this is the norm. 
---
I have jumped into wormholes, but there are a ton of NPCs in every site. 
---
Try having a 300 odd page PhD in word... can literally hear it straining lol
---
Big alliances send pings out to dock up when we are inbound. I think that's pretty relevant.
---
We here at Sniggwaffe invite you to a grand old time in Kinakka! Whether as friends joining us in our state of the art Federation Navy Comet, Police Edition, ships or as the honorable opposition flying the twenty titans with fax support that’ll drop on our humble fleet, we welcome all to Kinakka Thunderdome 2019!
---
I was really hoping for the I do not free base cocaine video instead.
---
Solo small gang is always welcome, at one point yesterday goons and friends had 3 or 4 fleets simultaneously in GE totalling over 250 pilots.          
---
               
---
They then got pissy about the lack of fights been taken by the 60 brave pilots in system. It felt very much like a bait for us to drop and be counter dropped. Everyone can play the game how they like and if it looks like none total suicide standing will generally take the fight. We also do suicide on a random individual basis.  
---
Polarized virtuoso do the job
---
Rental on any large scale is wrong. Past present or future.. that's my opinion.  Don't like well GFY 
---
You want the sites which have the npc faction as a prefix like "sansha", "angel", "gurista". Those are unguarded.
---
Dude's got a point.  If you remove excavators it severely impacts the yield and people still use rorquals.

Well... Are you at least having some faction spawn rolling your way?

Remember when propaganda videos were actually good.  Because this is dumb and unexplained.  He is not a cult leader he is a content provider in a game that is quickly losing most of its actual "content".

There is a division though. You just choose not to see it.

I was actually expecting the overshot by 100km, still good though =)
---
What do you expect when his asshole subordinates steal all the money that it used to fund fun things.  But hey its Elo so lets shit on him forgetting the fact that Eve is againt losing yet another content provider because the game has become stale and boring.
---
U okay budd
---
lack of moral character, and a community that will pat you on the back when you scumfuck over people while they say "its part of the game"
---
Do you even understand how markets work mate? If you don't have the lowest price in a trade hub, you don't sell, plain and simple. Every SECOND you spend where your orders aren't at the top is a missed sale, where you could be losing millions. Especially if you're trading faction/deadspace modules, where volumes are low and margins are high. I've had cases where I edited an order and 30 seconds later it was bought. Don't be like the salty guys who think every non-afk vni is a not just because they suck at hunting.

There is a 100% chance you are wrong.

---
Yeah, internet went down. Haven't been able to get ingame for a few days sadly. Been playing an offline clone over in Avorion and been getting a few crazy ideas for how eve online could benefit. One of which is watching your ship fail when you run out of energy and become a dead fish. But just thoughts. o7
---
Top Comment, Fuck CCP. I quit EVE 2 years ago. I still subscribe to this sub incase things get better. They havent same shit different day and year. Quit eve and get your real life back. You will thank me later. Eve is a waste of your life you will jever get back. 
---
The whole intent and I am sure the way CCP imagined it is have a fleet of exhumers and a rorq or 2 servicing them and eventually defending them, bringing PvP content.
---
But they failed to see everyone will just use the rorqual's mining capacity. These days hulks are only used to clear a belt and mine the mercoxiit rorqs cannot mine.
---
How stupid should one be not to see the easy fix here? And remember rorqs were nerfed 2 times, firat time rorqs mined like 350-400M worth of ore per hour, now it is 120-15. Yet some of us thought it is ok and you risk enough for that reward. We were wrong.
---
So what? You’d prefer them to be rorq mined under a super umbrella like the rest ?

Rorqs aren't even that great for isk right now until you get 6+.

Finally, someone who gets that "get your own bearhole" is a problematic statement! Amen, brother!
---

---
Why you do this when im at work
---
Well, he's onto something though. Think about. IRL you have people working day to day to pay the bills and get by, and you have the big fish who make millions or billions even by manipulating markets, finding niches, investing successfully etc. In eve you have the lowly krabs grinding bounties, and you have Aryth making trillions through market speculation. Of course there's those in between, but the people who exclusively vni rat(or just rat) or mine to sell could be called peasants.
---
Pick a loop of 5-10 systems in null.  Do every data and relic site.  The first time through the loop you'll spend a lot of time scanning down combat sites and wormholes.  The second time through the loop you'll already have the bullshit scanned and any new signatures are almost certainly relic or data.
---
It's important to completely clear all the relic and data sites because each one you complete makes another relic/data spawnq somewhere nearby (that may or may not be on your path).

Have you ever looked at the coalition map before the fozzie-soz changes?
---
All of null was run by 2 coalitions and 2 jokes:

-CFC (goons)
---
-N3/PL/Drone russians
---
and
---
-Provi-block (some things never change)
---
-HERO coalition (Brave+TEST, in that order and they only controlled a single region)

We have far more blocs these days.

---
The problem with caps and supercaps is not the 'big supercap battles', it's the umbrella effect - epitomised by bosoning T1 cruiser roams. You can't enjoy the game in subcaps any more because at any given moment you can be dropped on by caps, and, unlike having your cruiser roam dropped by battleships, you can't disengage.
---
And the reason you don't get big battles very often is that the side with a slightly smaller deployable force knows that n+1 means they will lose, so they don't fight, or at least don't bring their valuable assets to the fight.
---
The issue here is hosted on AWS, which might very well move, mirror or backup this container to Equipment in the EU and certainly Amazon is dealing with EU folk
---
If this is true, the responsibility falls on the data operator // collector in this case the site operator..to stay on top of it.
---
This is why it’s easier for companies to just say fuck the EU, than actually try to solves the problems.

---
No thrusters? Wouldn't that stop a ship in space creating almost a flop system motion? I'm thinking of a VNI going straight afterburner on. And neuts hit, afterburner/mwd fails and turns off. Webbed or scrammed, and you're going 100-less m/s currently your ship just, stops, in space. You're barely moving maybe orbiting the attacker. But you can't really run or defend yourself that well. 
---
My thinking is a VNI running away being neut drained would come to a slow stop eventually top heavy bringing the large head to the bottom of the failing mass. As it resurrects and attempts to run away it regains some power, jumps back up to run, only to be snagged again and drained. Falling.
---
The ones I've encountered are either not configured, or set with a very wide margins between the floor and ceiling. It was easy to run circles around them, bidding them up or down, then dumping/buying them up as required to make a profit.

---
Eve physics ain't no space physics.
---
For mystery reasons, space in Eve has very high drag, so a powered-down ship would just ctrl+space and sit there.
---
Sounds a lot more like goons tbh...
---
&gt; Krabbing can be just as much work as PvP
---
Imagine actually believing this
---
Truth be told there’s probably more alliance FC’s and others of rank in Shadow State and Karmafleet than in the old original corp. Not that it matters. I see no division. We are one people. You’re making a division that in reality is not real as far as power goes.
---
Don't you get it? Your alliance sucks unless some rando on reddit says that it doesn't. Stop having fun!

#makekinakkagreatagain
---
Its not about power but access.  The only point I was trying to make was that for a certain subset of the alliance membership/participation on SA is still relevant.  Members of Goonwaffe (apologies for getting the name wrong but I get stuck in the past sometimes) are required to either be members of SA or be sponsored by someone already in waffe in good standing.  That was literally my only point.
---
Just assuming for a moment that you are a real corp rather than a computer game one, the data protection act doesnt provide the right to the user that delete any personal information pertaining to them unless that information is incorrect or misleading. It only give them a right to demand a copy, the right that that information not be circulated without their permission and that it only be retained for a "reasonable duration". If individuals could demand that you delete the information about them then you could call the local council and demand that they delete all CCTV recordings that you appear in and provide evidence that they have done so. Some salty little nerd has clearly seen two paragraphs of the data protection legislation and gone off on a crusade.
---
Yea eve physics are weird, but then so is most fun sci fi ) 
---
we agree, I'm talking about 64 bits for it to add to the working list on the game.
---
but he's not a company, he's a private individual.  
---
and he's under canadian law, not EU.  so EU has no jurisdiction on him, or on the website as amazon is under US law.
---
whats more, he is not focusing on recruiting EU people specifically, so there is no claim for the site being majority EU.
---
private citizen protections apply.
---
if the EU has a problem with it, they have to bring it with the provider(Amazon), not the consumer of the hosting service due to whose law applies.
---
if the EU has a problem with how foreign law and protections work, they can feel free to submit a claim to Amazon's basing country and see how said country responds.
---
considering said country is USA under Trump, i'd expect little more than a mocking tweet.
---
TLDR jealous of Goons. If you want “farfights” go to j-space or lowsec. Nullsec is power block warfare. Either you can bring it or don’t bother. Let me let you in on a little secret. When BoB was the ONLY superpower in the game with all the titans Goonswarm did not cower. We fought even outmatched we fought, despite it being possible to doomsday through jump holes even... life was even more unfair back then. Quit your whining and grow a fucking pair boy.
---
Over under on howamy jumps before they derp it into their own alts in T3s. 
---
I'll stake 8.
---
Maybe grow a pair and actually hunt other pvp’ers you weakling? What’s with hunting people who can’t shoot back you coward?
---
You really must be new. There is no active group or player who is winning eve. 
---
Yes, true. Every corp has its own membership rules for joining and requirements to stay. Thunderwaffe is different to Shadow State which is different to Bovril which is different to Karmafleet which is different to Goonwaffe. Goonwaffe holds a special place in our hearts because it was the original but we are all Imperium brothers and sisters. Our enemies have long since tried to say those not in the original corp are not real Goons blah blah. On it goes. But I’ve never heard this from Goons who are in that corp, ever. Many are my friends. :)

Ksrmafleet came from Brave. We share a history so it’s good to see Brave FC’s give as good as they get. They have become very experienced fighting us. There’s been a heap of times we’ve lost to Brave. They’re our sparing partners during peacetime rather than punching bag.

That's always been the case - the vast majority of people on the CSM have always been from nullsec blocs. It's more dramatic this time as it's 100% but representation from other types of player has always been minimal.

&gt;As such, groups like Rooks and Kings are widely loathed among the EVE community - and in the recent conflict INIT had widespread popular support.
---
Incorrect on both counts - RnK are widely respected as one of the most skilled groups to have ever roamed New Eden, and INIT. was widely criticized and laughed at for what was seen as seal clubbing a poor defenseless 80-man wormhole group.

As far as your commentary on capital balance you should probably get a handle on the basics such as changing client settings before you try to make balance suggestions.

---
This is a new era for PL 
---
Honestly these other suggestions are more expensive than needed. Fit a Heron or something with drones with an MWD, Scram, relic analyzer, Rockets (or whatever preferred weapon type), and some low slots with whatever. Then you seem just like another explorer come to steal a can or two but nope, you Scram them and kill them. Much cheaper than the other suggestions here.

Imagine a satellite in space. Large object with no thrusters? Yet it moves around the earth at a nice constant speed. If it loses that hold on gravity. It moves out into space forever. Air without drag will be slow to stop a large mass like a capital. Yet EVE is broken

private citizens are protected by their countries law. and are not at liberty of other countries laws unless they are in that country's jurisdiction.
---
in this case, the website is not based in the EU,  or focused on EU members.
---
also, who said private data?  from what we've seen the only data shown is data period,  so what they post on forums.   its normal process to keep this info on hand as removing it is problematic specially if they are especially active.
---
and information used to create the account is archived to prevent them from recreating accounts using said info. 
---
the GDPR might have an issue with this, but Canadian and US law differs, and if an EU citizen chooses to create an account and post on a site based in the US or Canada,  a general site not a focused to EU member site,   then theres no legal standing for GDPR.
---
not to mention GDPR is more focused on companies,  not private online chat groups for video games.  you'll find they aren't going to bother here unless said chat group turns out to have stuff similar to SSN or credit card and is using it.  in which case it violates US and Canadian laws.

Because you're 'one of those cunts' and this is your retribution. #ecmisforpussies

That sounds right. Sometimes just the satisfaction of knowing that you vented it, even if they don't, is enough.

fuck the miners and fuck the newbros

Also do this in gurista or sansha space. The others arent any good.

None of your bullshit here atters ,youre still conflating current active behavior with past behavior, you re an apologist, you are trash.

In academic papers you're not supposed to include pictures/images unless it's absolutely necessary for your analysis. Here, the image does not depict anything that can't (and already has been) described in words. It's unnecessary fluff.

Incorrect. That might be true in the US (or may not, I don't know US data law), but GDPR is EU regulation, and part of that is Article 17 - the Right to be Forgotten (or Right of Erasure). Its not blanket, but basically if:
---
* the personal data is no longer necessary for the purpose which you originally collected or processed it for;
---
* you are relying on consent as your lawful basis for holding the data, and the individual withdraws their consent;
---
* you are relying on legitimate interests as your basis for processing, the individual objects to the processing of their data, and there is no overriding legitimate interest to continue this processing;
---
* you are processing the personal data for direct marketing purposes and the individual objects to that processing;
---
* you have processed the personal data unlawfully (ie in breach of the lawfulness requirement of the 1st principle);
---
* you have to do it to comply with a legal obligation; or
---
* you have processed the personal data to offer information society services to a child.
---
In this case, the first two could be argued to apply (guy is no longer in the corp, so his data is no longer necessary, and the guy has withdrawn consent for a group he is no longer affiliated with to hold his data). 
---
The exceptions to Article 17 are:
---
The right to erasure does not apply if processing is necessary for one of the following reasons:
---
* to exercise the right of freedom of expression and information;
---
* to comply with a legal obligation;
---
* for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority;
---
* for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific research historical research or statistical purposes where erasure is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of that processing; or
---
* for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
---
The GDPR also specifies two circumstances where the right to erasure will not apply to special category data:
---
* if the processing is necessary for public health purposes in the public interest (eg protecting against serious cross-border threats to health, or ensuring high standards of quality and safety of health care and of medicinal products or medical devices); or
---
* if the processing is necessary for the purposes of preventative or occupational medicine (eg where the processing is necessary for the working capacity of an employee; for medical diagnosis; for the provision of health or social care; or for the management of health or social care systems or services). This only applies where the data is being processed by or under the responsibility of a professional subject to a legal obligation of professional secrecy (eg a health professional).
---
None of those would apply here, so if it were an actual company, they likely would have to comply.
---
No, they can demand that you delete all data directly, except when you have to keep them longer due to other laws.
---
The GDPR also says that you only are allowed to save the data "as long as you have reasonable need"
---
In a decade or two
---
Under rated rules of life.
---
Lol and you call test dinobrains.  Look at our alliance we have like 150 members and are def not in legacy.  I do love the horde salt though keep it up.

You don’t pay. You let anyone else shoot him if they want to and they pay you the amount you enter. If it’s too high, no one will tale that option. Usually 20-30m is good unless he already has 50 other killrights available. For 0-10 m it will get taken very quickly. 
---
Couple of tips to help you speed up:
---
Bind the functions of scanning and increasing and decreasing the range if you probes. I use z,x,c as the keys for smaller, larger and scanning. This way it is also next to v, the key for d-scanning
---
Secondly, i recommend making a bookmark when you warp into the site so you have a ping. Timing is key and it will take some practice. I like it because you warp to each can, leaves you less vulnerable than burning between them.
---
Good luck my friend, exploration is great isk for new players but you can be unlucky, you also have rare times when you have a can with hundreds of millions of loot.
---
As an alpha i can also recommend the abyas for some consistent isk in hisec.
---
Fly dangerous!

I think we should consult Texas Law.

Nice to know eve community has finally devolved into making youtube videos with comments written on a notepad... 
---
The only thing that's missing is Trance - 009 Sound System Dreamscape added as an audio track...
---
Youve kind of argued my point at the same time. The group may feel the data still relevant and required as they may need to keep record of previous group members. So the data would still be necessary.
---
Also, youve missed the key term "Processing" in a lot of the statements from article 17 where the right to be forgetton is only relevant where the data is being processed, which in this instance it is not as the data is unlikely to be continued to be collected or manipulated.
---
Either way, there are a lot of items that are open to interpretation and the key thing is that i suspect the information that is being requested be erased is not "Personal information" as id hazard a good guess this person isnt even refered to by his real name.
---
Heck is exactly the place I go if I want to buy massively overpriced modules and ships that aren't always available!
---
So Bob would have to delete his Eve account for any of his complaint to even start to matter.  Any info of his game account is still useful should that corp want to put a bounty on his head in-game and chase him down. XD  That's still for the purpose of the game.

I'm pretty sure if I got any mail from any foreign entity demanding anything at all, I would ignore it at best; but knowing me I'd probably mail back just to tell them to eat shit and remind them that I'm not from their big government paradise.

Chill out there and don't take everything so seriously.

I had a slightly different interpretation of eigenvector centrality. Since it's a centrality measure weighted by the relative importance of your connections to the graph, I interpreted it as the difficulty of the fights that a given pilot would take. If you're primarily taking good fights and not popping random FW bears, haulers, shuttles, etc, that choice of engagement should be reflected through eigenvector centrality. That said, I think that Conoco. actually warps this entire network pretty strongly just by their sheer size and activity in the region, so I'm not sure what to make of that. It would be something interesting to explore further.
---
As far as PvP as a social interaction, I'd disagree - it's definitely social. It's two or more players (or groups of players) interacting with one another within the broader context of the game. You don't necessarily need rich interactions between players in order to model the way that players associate with one another. For chat channels and alliance relationships, you're right and I'd love to, but that's much more difficult to capture well. The only way for me to do chat channels that I could think of would be for me to run multiple alpha accounts and leave them online 24/7 in systems that I want to examine, and even then that only captures local, not corp/fleet/voice/dm. There's a ton of data that I'm just not able to capture without extensive fieldwork and community buy-in for that.  
---
I actually sent this paper to CCP after it was accepted to CLS, and was on a few conference calls with their data scientists about some other applications for this kind of work in looking at EvE. As part of that, I would have been able to get access to ESI on their end, which *really* opens up the number of things that I could look at. But this was right around when Pearl Abyss bought CCP, and I stopped hearing from them, unfortunately. I would have loved to use back-end ESI data to expand the kinds of interactions I could look at.
---
It was a lot of fun for sure!
---
&gt;3.  There will be more content or obligation to defend / pay mercenary to defend = More content if it’s the same as in WH. 
---
That's a rather big assumption right there.
---
Stuff can easily be moved, even by a casual player, as you'll likely have in excess of a week to do so. In null and low-sec we have things like Jump Freighters, which makes moving stuff between citadels pretty quick and painless. - People defend structures because of the value of the structure itself not because of their stuff. Usually it's more about strategic value as well, as opposed to monetary value. This change won't have any effect on that.
---
The only people who would be hurt by removing asset safety are people on hiatus, as they won't be around to move stuff. And, obviously, no matter what changes you implement you won't be getting content out of people who aren't playing the game.
---
Look at the globalists trying to control the world. Good luck
---
I have concluded that bears don't exist after I looked under my desk and saw there wasn't any.

There is one for ESI. If you submit a bug you have a good chance to have it closed as 'that's how it works'

Burner missions is a type of missions where, unlike normal missions with dozens of NPCs in them, you fight against a single frigate that's supposed to feel like PvPing, but in reality people figured ways to farm them with specialized faction frigates fitted in a certain way. They're profitable because they give a lot more LP than normal missions (because they're supposed to be "hard").

The same thing happened to me except with fighters

Weren't two of the largest battles in the game pretty recent?

Make sure you’re doing exploration in sansha or guristas space. Since you’re new, don’t do wormholes. Null sec is much safer, no chance of a hole closing behind you or whatever. I did explo in provi for 2-3 months and once you get to know the busy/camped systems, you can avoid them and have pretty much uninterrupted isk making.
---
Look at how dumb you are.
---
Imagine bragging about being rich in a valueless video game currency rofl
---
Not gonna try to change your mind because I agree. The idea is much better than the execution/reality.
---
That's saying something though, imo. Other MMOs you read about and you pretty much expect what you actually get. Eve at least has a grand plan, it just doesn't get implemented fully. This is what keeps vets around, clinging to the hope that eve becomes what it claims to be. It's also what chases new players off, it sounding amazing and turning out a relatively buggy and bland experience for much of the time you're logged in on any given day.
---
Are those artilleries or autocannons? If arty, go a bit further, to about the end of your optimal, slightly into falloff range.
---
and then everyone clapped

Used to play pretty hardcore years ago, in my Aharm days, and we had a semi regular meetup in the Boston area and it was really great for me. 3+ years later when I’ve returned to the game I now live outside of Charlotte and am super amped to see this post. Will do my best to attend.

---
2014 is recent?
---
Do you have isk? If so fit a small shield Extender (not just the basic one but one with name like compact or something). Also check your optimal range and falloff on your guns. If you have autocannons you should orbit him at a range below what your optimal range is. So if your optimal is 1k orbit at 500m. If you have Artillery, same thing except you don't want to orbit, you want to keep at range (right click him you will see the option). This is because if you are moving quickly the Artillery won't be able to track the target. 
---
You're probably on the mission where you're supposed to point the Pirate Leader. It's intended that he doesn't take any damage.  
---
Here's what you need to do:  
---
\- Fit the "Civilian Warp Disruptor" Module that your agent gave you for that mission to your ship
---
\- Warp to the combat site
---
\- Activate the Warp Disruptor on the Pirate Leader (just like you would your guns) and shoot him for a bit
---
\- After some time the objective should show as completed and you can dock up and turn the mission in

Official Communique from Gotan Kreiss, Head of Internal Security, Angel Cartel.    
---
Capsuleers are reminded that unauthorised commercial activity by visitors under the Yulai Tourist Visa Waiver program will be met with enforcement action by agents of the Cartel Revenue protection team. Unauthorised mining and Haulage without correct permits may lead without negotiation to the destruction of your space vessel and impounding of all cargo. Capsuleers wishing safe passage through Angel Cartel controlled space are advised to contact an authorised representative of the RPT with the value of their ship, cargo and intended route in order to levy the appropriate permit fee.
---
Gotan Kreiss also wishes to remind non affiliated members of the Cartel that The Angel Cartel &amp; Cartel logo is a registered Yulai commercial trademark and may not be used for commercial promotion of non-authorised Cartel business interests without license. Impersonating an Angel Cartel agent is considered a crime under the 3rd Tama Convention Of Pirate Factions Accord on naming rights and protection of brand reputation, and any such impersonation will result in assassination contracts being issued.

or am I just experiencing lag?

Until we hit a point where you can insta SRP with completed hulls, big alliances still won't take risks with them (compared to how you can yolo a dread fleet). And even big alliances would balk at having 150 replacement titan hulls lying around (especially if those could theoretically be shipped up for the *first* fight).

As I said in another thread: Some ppl are online LOTS( about 12 hrs an avarage day here) and you cant be all PvP-superhyped all that time. You need some chill ratting, mining, hauling stuff from a to b while having a fun chat with the corpies inbetween, else you burn out quicker than you could spell "fun".

They do get concorded immediately after they tried to kill the hauler. After that they just wait out their 15 minute criminal timer and can go at it again.

Faction police itself (not Concord) will engage all targets below a certain security status threshold, (see [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Standing\_and\_status](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Standing_and_status)), but gankers usually keep their security status above that thresh by turning in security tags at concord lowsec stations (see [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Security\_tags](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Security_tags)).

Would be pretty funny to see the President tweet about a EVE Player taking legal action on another EVE player by a French law firm though. If it gets visible enough he might just do it under the guise of irritating the EU lol.
---
I think the fact that thinking about EVE is better than playing doesn’t mean that the game is bad. I think the fact that this game captivates our thoughts while we’re at work or with family is something I’ve never had with any other game, and a sign the game is great. I’ve been playing a bit less than a year and I love brainstorming skill queues, and ship fits, and coming up with and organizing fun events for the Corp, and chatting on discord. Maybe I’m still in the honeymoon phase with EVE, but I have fun when I log in and when I’m logged off. 
---
I get on and usually there’s plenty to do between tons of pvp pings, or Corp ratting fleets, or helping the Corp scan out the chain, or playing with ship fits and industry stuff. 
---
Then I get off and it’s equally fun with podcasts, books, community and videos to watch, and planning for what you’ll do when you get to that next skill or when you get off work.
---
I think it’s great logged on and logged off. No other game have I thought that. I think maybe for people who prefer a more action oriented FPS type game it lacks that, but if you enjoy strategy, and planning, and coordination, and teamwork it’s truly a great game.

I'm sorry to say, but the Japanese guys sure got the short end of the stick. They are woefully under endowed. Even though the Japanese snatch is about the tightest on earth, I doubt that they feel much when being screwed by their boyfriends. That might be one of the reasons that the birth rate in Japan is on the decline.
---
So when a full size Western guy starts pounding on her pussy she starts feeling things that she hasn't felt before. Certain places are getting hit that haven't been hit before. Then a nice orgasm for her.
---
With Filipina girls, my theory is a little different. I've had a number of Filipina girls tell me that the Philippine men are just no fun in bed. They aren't that much into fooling around or foreplay and just want to boom boom. I had this one Filipina gf named Roxanne who told me that the basic method of sex for Philippine men was the 1 - 2 - 3 cum method. She said that they were just that fast. So when a romantic Western dude comes along and gives them a lot of play and then starts pounding their pussies, they cum pretty easy.
---
I've also found that if I spank a girl really hard while fucking her doggy style that also induces orgasms. On the other hand, it could just be that the girl is faking the orgasm so that I stop spanking her ass so hard. (Ha)
---
Boy, you dense.
---
Gankers rely on high alpha strike ships like tornados aka ganknados and catalysts to one shot volley targets before concord responds. Since concord only acts after you attack if you apply enough damage in one strike you can kill anything before concord kills you. Then a neutral alt scoops the booty. Arty Nados are good because they have a massive alpha strike DPS but long reload which doesn’t matter as its a one strike attack. Since they are t1 they are also cheap to replace. The trick is to apply enough DPS to overwhelm the highest EHP the target could have, accounting for Slave sets, overheated modules etc.

"We quickly establish Forts across Branch, particularly in MA-VDX, Y-1918, and others. This gives us full cap + black ops coverage of Branch, and these Forts are still there to this day. "

Your forts definitely aren't here anymore.

# ESI Setup

To set up EVE IPH for use with the EVE Swagger Interface (ESI), please see [instructions here](http://eveiph.github.io/ESIAuthorizationInstructions.html).
---
Very simple : he sells thr right at random people that want to pay X money to have the right to kill the man without getting concorded (when you buy the KR the man comes suspect). 
---
I do it sometimes . Put plex in cargo , too easy to bait ganker lol
---
Thank you! Big oof on my part
---
Thank you!
---
When ur old ceo from INIT loses his rev 😂
---
Because they mine and krab without a mining permit!
---
ah fantastic!
---
God damn Europe is so shit.
---
Mining in high sec is relaxing and easy to get into and you can train up skills while mining. You can start with t1 mining upgrades and then replace them with t2s, same with lasers, etc.
---
Lot of options to choose from, with 3 t1 and 3 t2 barges.
---
Everyone doing Elite HiSec PvP are better than those carebears that are mining and krqabbing without proper mining permits.
---
i can see Trump having fun being the PR spokesman for a corp in EVE.  would be the most content generation ever

when 123b isk Titans take less damage than rorqs.
---
This was in 1999, and there was a lot of DirecTV hacking going on. Some people were using readers like the one I bought to modify their DirecTV access cards.
---
they probably arent going to bother here not because its not covered but because its just starting to get of the ground and there is a ton of other stuff to do. private chat groups and forums will very much be in the focus once we are down the road more. they wont care who is behind is as long as a global player can be forced to take action on their behalf. amazon microsoft google and discord will very much care. ignoring is might be a valid strategy now but it will not be in a couple of years.

Innuendo's are in this post are weird who would use a 1Bil drone to excavate the balls of an asteroid...and why the fuck am i thinking about this
---
It's been so true for me for the past 3-4 years. Mostly because I remember how it was when I started, and how bad it's got now.
---
 I have a solution that killed 100% of the bots in this game. But, I will not tell about it. I do not pay for it. 
---
LOL!!!
---
Afk hauling... Just don't. People will gank you before you have made back the costs for the hauler.

Trading is passive income, but requires starting isk and you have to do your homework on what to trade, where and when. 
---
Sierra Nevada eve meet &gt; Biltmore anything
---
Don't forget to buy a mining permit from your favourite Agent.
---
Just 10m isk for a whole year of responsible mining.
---
But every single ganker in that video got killed by concord? What prompted you to post this?
---
Planetary Interaction is a decent way to make some passive isk. Requires some skilling and time to setup, but once it's running it's low effort
---
Synology was a good program I used for controlling multiple computers. It allows you to move the mouse to switch screens/computers seamlessly
---
Oh I'm sorry I was confused because he was issuing kill rights how do you still make money offering kill rights if they're being killed by Concord?
---
Who the Hek still runs L4s?
---
Hek is literally a shithole and thats low considering minmatar standards.
---
It sounds like subscription is your thing, if you wont enjoy it and you can afford a galaxy pack every so often thats a better bet.          
---
          
---
Start lots of alphas now and get them skilling towards 5m sp then you can extract at the end of their respective omegas for max profit.  
---
Of you did that you would lose all the high sec carebear miner type members - aka most of the goonies
---
I'd hope you'd expect nothing less from us!  Blaster fit phoenix though?  What's your optimal range on that?

you can only do a galaxy pack once per account

---
i think you are confused again, apply the lense of reality then ask again says my magic 8 ball
---
Outlook good
---
And yet again ccp does nothing while goons rat and mine
---
Because when they take the first shot, you also get the kill right. Kill rights aren't tied to you dying. As soon as someone opens fire illegally, you'll get a kill right and a few seconds later, concord kills the attacker.
---
Lol
---
Who is this idiot
---
When I started a few months ago I got a Noctis and thought I could survive off l4 wrecks. Was a little underwhelmed. Are there any salvage focused corps? Im sure if there are its all industry based. 
---
Are rapid light missile launchers considered as small weapons? Meaning do they get bonus in Wolf Rayet or is it just normal light missiles launchers?
---
Don't think this is true. I live on the edge of one region, with my manufacturing/research in another region one jump away, and Supply Chain Management lets me start and deliver jobs in my build station from my home station despite these being systems in different regions. So it's purely # of jumps, not region locked.
---
Whether that's a bug or intentional, I couldn't say, but it does work currently at least. And yes, this is specifically industry skills; market ones are indeed region specific.
---
honestly, between that and Article 13 bullshit.   i really expect most websites to just block europe from accessing their sites.
---
i mean, consider facebook, youtube, google,or discord.  policing for "any copyright content and remove it" specially with how little in the way of fair use the EU has vs America.   it would be a suicidal nightmare to police.
---
while banning Europe loses you some customers, but the potential lawsuits outweigh the loss in users
---
FC, how do I read mission briefing?
---
Get into a Hyperion or Rokh and fly incursions maybe? It can take up a lot of time and be a totally lifestyle if you want to get the optimal battleships and a Bowhead to live in, but it can also be a casual ish thing if you dont mind warping to the new incursion site every 4ish days. It will get you like 150 mil an hour ish? Go to the Warp To Me channel and see if it's your kind of thing.
---
The other is exploration in null sec. Or ganking explorers in low sec if you dont like the hacking mini game and feeling like a rabbit in a cage of owls XD.
---
Spring 2027
---
If you run the burners and are selective, you can make a Hek of a lotta ISK. 
---
google and facebook have more users in europe than in the us. probably the same for amazon and microsoft if you add up all the indirect cloud users. they will care. 
---
In my opinion the Interstellar main theme fits quite well to Eve Online if you're not doing PVP.
---
I'd buy this for a dollar!
---
In the mood for what
---
Have no experience practicing laws but isn't Bob asking for his data that op's site has to be removed, not removed from the game. And since the name in the killfeed is public information and not operated by op's site op can't be liable for that. Bob would have to delete his character from the game.
---
Wait, there are gankers that don't scan both the cargo and your fit?
---
Appropriately enough, you can't even bring a Hel into Hek.
---

Lanngisi is an easy 200m/hr+ running soe lv4s.  SoE LP value has kinda tanked, and other LP has mostly gone up so other agents can be more profitable but it's something you need to keep an eye on as LP goes up and down depending on what's going on in Eve.  
---
mabye becuse test decided to put thousandth+ players there to fight so normal people and a thousand man fleet fight. yea a little lag
---
That's why you make lots of alpha accounts and skill them to 5m, redeem the pack. Extract and sell on char bazaar if you wanna go nuts. Rinse repeat.   
---
but the problem is the requirements of removing every single copyright content that gets put up.
---
with the sheer ammount of content uploaded per minute, its impossible to monitor it all.  and even worse people will get pissed due to just what gets removed (as not all stuff demanded to be removed under article 13 violates fair use, see reviews and analysis).
---
article 13 is, in short, an excuse to sue whenever you want, any company and make their life hell.
---
Look mom! I'm on the internet! (seriously, wtf is this about?)
---
Nah that person is just stupid. Anything created in Eve is owned by Eve
---
hi
---
Yes RLML get small weapon bonuses like the Wolf Rayet damage bonus. It’s frankly absolutely disgusting how fast a fleet of RLML cruisers can kill stuff in a WR wormhole. 
---
As a new player, you’re unlikely to be a part of any political drama unless you try and make some yourself (by being incredibly dumb or being a drama queen). 
---
If you want to elevate yourself to a leadership position, you should look into joining a Corp and being an active content creator once you have more experience.

I haven't run missions in awhile though, so that may have changed, but Motsu never sent me to lowsec.

Then you got another Phoenix. Mine were Rapid torps. Who would dare put blasters on a Phoenix... lol
---
intro is like a minute and a half long but this is one of the dankest pvp vids I've seen still.

HAHA cool, it's just like my reddit name. Took a while to find it, heard  it years ago in a LoL video replacing a character as the whambulance.

Idk, but I heard he’s a heck of a hel pilot, in his spare time.

The T2 Catalysts etc are not high alpha ships.

One of these words is not like the others.

This is amazing :D
---
that neocom still looks good
---
That might be our fault. We turned Perimeter into our Isla Sorna. 
---
Most of the time when people are talking about isk/hr they are talking about what an experienced player can do. Since you are a new player it's going to take you some time to learn how to do things, and train up skills to do them better.   I'm really bad at exploration I feel like I'm lucky to make 10mil/hr doing it and I have max skills for it. I'd have to spend some time practicing probing and the hacking miningame plus figuring out good routes to make good money.
---
there's also more advanced exploration sites like ghost sites and sleeper caches that can have some very good loot.  You might want to look into these once you start getting better with the normal data/relic sites. 
---
yes many items are run by bots.  i knew several players who made billions every day very easily with their market bots.  they make sure they under cut everyone by an extremely small amount to have the cheapest item for the items they are currently working.
---
I think the problem with goons currently, is that it doesn't seem like they coordinate at all on their fleet roams. 2-4 entirely separate goon fleets will show up in catch around the same time, then get upset when the reaction is "yeah...we aren't forming for that". They realize we are good for a fight, so a lot of the FCs end up coming out to Catch. But it's like they don't even pay attention to eachother's pings.
---
vintage neocom
---
That which is dead may never die.
---
So I am ignorant because you said they most their kills were on ops, I link proof showing they were possibly best solo super hunters in eve last year. 
---
You say they contribute nothing and just krab, I show proof they had highest participation stats in goons the past few months.
---
How do you even remember to breathe honestly.

Motsu is 0.9 sec though, won't the isk and lp rewards be pretty low compared to an agent based in 0.5 sec?
---
Just because I don't want to go into low sec in my pve ship doesn't mean I'm botting :/
---
Damn, dude rolled a twenty his first time out yo

The better, but no fastest, is do level 3 distribution missions with the agent of isenairos. I recently level a character to 7.07 there and sold ( [https://forums.eveonline.com/t/sold-wts-puller-trader-with-reputations-amarr-caldari-and-emperor-caldary-navy/126480/5](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/sold-wts-puller-trader-with-reputations-amarr-caldari-and-emperor-caldary-navy/126480/5) )

Maybe someone here will be know. I’ve never been able to get it to work.
---
I registered the program successfully, but when I add character and enter my info, the site says “login successful!you can close this window...”
---
But the isk per hour app returns an error “web failed to get access token. Code 401, remote server returned an error.

What am I doing wrong? Please help an illiterate.

I too endorse the 0.5 Hek instead of the 0.9 Rens.

I didn't miss anything - those were copy-pastes from the Information Commissioners Office, not my phrasing, and no offense, but I'm taking the phrasing of the UK's official body for information governance's legal guidance for businesses on the GDPR article 17 over reddit's.

Gigx, is that you?!

No they dont drop anything 
---
Surely since EVE is submarines in space this comes under [Maritime Law](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdeSh3vLvYI)?
---
Not necessarily. 
---
The data they have on that site would be considered legally distinct from Eve itself. 
---
Again, this all assumes it was a real corporation in the EU, but as I said, the key points which would relate to this would be:
---
You couldn't argue the bounty thing, because that's not what it was originally collected for, and the player has withdrawn their consent, so a corp in this scenario likely would be required to delete.
---
But as this is a non-corp and outside the EU, it's all academic.
---
**FUCKING**

boo

i loved 6 jumps from hek (in vorsk) for 4 years, it was so nice and comfy i wasnt even aware it was a trade hub till i was in nullsec

can reccomend!

Yeah that was you.  My brain isn't working.

LP in 0.5 is 54% better than in 0.9.

---
I'd think the docking theme would fit for major battles. 
---
Oh right, thanks.
---
Oh, you're not an eve player are you?  Killboard is literally just a transcription of Eve deaths coming from Eve's API.  That guy can't be withdrawing his consent unless he was doing that with Eve which would mean he wouldn't be playing anymore.  It's like saying, "I don't consent to sex, but hold on.  I'm not finished sucking your dick."

Forum comments I can see as also being there for the original reason you collected them, but that's a little fuzzier.

How dare he decide not to play a video game anymore? Who will think of the children of not Elo??

No, your organization is an embarrassment, a cancerous disease killing Eve over the span of years. But do enjoy the endless spod, the addiction never quits, does it

NuGoons are trash

if you had proper reading comprehension, you would have noticed that I indeed have answered your question.
---
Only your "proof" was without context. The Super hunter stuff was mostly large fleet ops. The participation, I already explained, is a flawed statistic that you are twisting to your own agenda.  
---
I'm telling you, RGSU is not noticed. You want participation stats? I give you the numbers of how much in the way of Alliance groups they participation in. Making paps for your Corp roams is just gaming the participation system.

To stop them jumping out of the system. This prevents the side that starts losing evacuating when it's going badly, securing far more kills for the victors.

Also since abyssal space the Enhanced Ward Consoles have been close to Intact Armor Plate prices. 
---
The warp systems on ships creates space time friction so therefore the ships have a maximum velocity due to this.  This was explained in a lore chronicle 12-15 years ago and occurs on all ships capable of warping.  
---
But this doesn't explain things like drones.  
---
I am an Eve player (though I won't lie and call myself a good one, also why do you think I'm posting in the Eve subreddit if I'm not an Eve player), so I know exactly what a killboard is. But we're not just talking about a killboard. We're talking about their forums and stuff like that which isn't API driven.
---
They could make an argument to say "we cant' control this aspect, as its not controlled by us", but things like his forum posts, account details, etc are things they can control and therefore can delete. That's what the GDPR would cover.

Eh, maybe. Imo it's better than the idea of "you never get to use your titan because we need them in case PL tries to evict us, which they won't because we have too more titans - unless we welp them, so to prevent that welp, we never undock"
---
At least in full resource-glut mode we'd get a lot of pretty solid fights, with some potential to wear out alliances that welp their fleets more than once or twice. 
---
It won't make you any money passively, but exploration can be very lucrative if you hit a good string of sites. I know people say it averages 60M an hour, but I find it's closer to 100M. I've made 250/300M an hour for sure, but it's very rare.

EVE IPH is amazing. I recently discovered there's a way to make it exclude blueprints with products that shift less than a certain amount per week on the market. It's the SVR threshold at the bottom of the manufacturing list tab. Super-useful because the top of the list is always filled with deadspace equipment that no one actually buys.

I mean really what happens a lot is goons will bring stuff that we are completely willing to fight, then another goon fleet randomly shows up that didn't realize there was already a goon fleet in Catch and stick around so it goes from "yay 50 on 50 (roughly) corms vs talwars!" to 130 goons in system and Catch doesn't have the numbers to fight that many goons at that time.
---
Now we need one for the Solitude "high sec pocket"...

I just check out the Eve Reddit and Twitch from time to time to look at the spaceship redesigns.  Now that the game is free I've even logged in one or twice to look at them in the in-game viewer.

100% have to agree with PI.  There are a ton of good guides and walk throughs for how to effectively set up a farm, so I'll just touch base on what your time investment looks like for OP.      
---
PI scales linearly, so the more toons you have doing it, the more isk you earn.  Your time investment will go up as you increase in toons as well.      Typical farms are going to look like 300-500m a month.
---
The longest time spent in one sitting is your initial set up.  You can do all toons at once or spread it out over a few days.  Once set up, your time investment will involve two activities.  Resetting your extractors, and hauling the materials.  
---
How often you reset extractors is up to you.  Longer cycle times mean less resets, but also less materials mined an hour.  Shorter cycle times is the opposite.  Hauling can be done 1 or 2 times a week, depending on your set up.  This might be more if you are using a few extractor planets and have a factory planet.  
---
I recommend finding a balance between efficiency and time spent that works for you.  Some people can reset 6 planets on 25 toons every day and be fine.  Personally, I found 4 toons at 2-3 day resets to be a good balance for me.

Minataur or the Egoism by Fleshgod Apocalypse would be great for a huge battle scene!!
---
A shorter way to say what you've said would be "no you"
---
not blingy enough. If you have that expensive of a ship you need to go ALL out with the fit
---
So it's all about the price and not about how useful the fit is? Sure, you could officer everything and have the fit cost 150b, but you wouldn't gain much. Again, I haven't flown one and therefore am not sure if like 1km of point or web range would make a difference. I'm fairly sure it wouldn't.
---
Ah, forgot to mention that 7.5k was the base amount it could hold.
---
Eve IPH is in my opinion is the best tool available. It took me from middling profits to billions a month and let me find good niches for what I wanted to do with industry. 
---
It’s an incredible tool. 
---
I stick to run times that will hopefully end when I’m awake and can start a new job. I do not make charges and rarely make ships. All T2 modules and capital T1 and T2 modules. 
---
the bestower has the most cargo capacity of the t1 haulers after they rebalanced them and turned the hoarder in to an ammo hauler, the miasmos in to an ore hauler etc.
---
the iteron V used to be the best, if you had the racial industrial skill trained to V. (the mamoth was king if you only took it to IV which was common because of the time investment to get from IV to V).
---
in short; most people saying the itty V are probably outdated sources from before the rebalance. the max capacity will come from the bestower - the amarr hauler.
---
It does, and at 150b that's still cheaper than the hull
---
Skill urself is an elite alliance 
---
[Insert hastily made Cleveland tourism video theme here]
---
Q: what kind of cruisers can bombers take down solo?
---
Given that different haulers have a different number of low slots to fit expanders, the cargo capacity once fit is a bit more relevant than the base number
---

---
Inb4 "but then why would you ever fly an Ishtar???"
---
Because Ishtars can actually go faster than 1500 m/s.
---
You still do but that’s for goonwaffe. He applied for Karmafleet which is GSF’s reddit corp for pubbies. You still need to apply with ESI and get auth’d then you get invited to join corp, if you just go and cold apply in game it’s a insta-reject because if you are to dumb to follow basic instructions then you are the sort of poor quality spai that even Horde would reject.
---
I'm still working on it. What's up?
---
I think the bestower has the largest hold for alphas, and the caldari have the most ehp.
---
You can't but I'm working on a fix. ESI doesn't give me a list of the structures you can access or make it particularly easy to do so I have a somewhat funky way to do it that I'll get going hopefully soon.
---
As a resident there, I would say we live in the middle of nowhere, but that would be a lie, as the middle of nowhere is a far to central and marked location.
---
We live in the hinterlands of nowhere from where you can SEE the middle of nowhere, on a good day when it's not obscured by fog.
---
Not as strong as 100 atrons

IPH dev here. Thanks for the notes. I still have a lot of things to fix and update but glad you are finding it useful. Conve me or join the EVE-IPH channel in game if you want to ask any questions.

If killing something a fraction of a second faster in one out of a thousand fights might make a serious difference in saving your AT ship you should really consider paying up for at least a little abyss
---
And when speed relates so often to survival, it's often worth the cost on ships a whole lot cheaper than this
---
May as well tbh.
---
That just sped up the process. They were holed up in Delve with nowhere left to run at the time. We had them surrounded.

Moral of the story... Next time Elo comes back, don't believe the hype and waste your precious Eve time. Short CEO, will disappoint.. again. Let sleeping dogs die? lie? You know what I mean.

Eve is a game, which allows meaningful losses. People build things for months, and everything can fall to dust again. That's maybe THE most defining feature of the game. As I said - actually it has become easier to recover from losses.
---
&gt; Tl;dr the top strategic force needs to be something people can afford to risk.
---
No. If every possible loss can be replaced easily, people will not risk more. Nobody will ever take big risks then - because it became impossible to do so. Sure, there will be more Titan killmails. But they are not the same any more.
---
If big risks are possible, it is quite normal that people avoid them more often than not. This is reason, not a symptom of bad game mechanics. They have to decide if it's worth taking the risk or not (and very often it's not). Making these decisions is central in Eve. 
---
Actually, we regularly have the problem of having to leave Goons behind because the fleet size is at max numbers... fleets can only fit 256 members. 
---
Sweet and the pilot has yet to have a buddy explain why this couldn't have happened.
---
That would require me logging in
---
When you're sitting in a hull worth 3-500+b every km, every fraction of a percent matters.  Also this ship can push twice the dps this thing was pushing if you sprinkle a little abyss on it (not to mention 98+% webs at over 35km).
---
&gt; It is also human nature to want a safety net so I get why everyone doesn't play like I do.
---
This is the real key - we all agree the game would probably be better if everyone played like this, but no big alliances will do it. Groups that do (like Co2 to an extent) tend to get weeded out over time by groups that don't. 
---
Yoloing your supers around also objectively decreases your ability to hold sov on a permanent basis, so any entity that has "be a sov null power" on its top list of goals will find it has a lot of incentives not to do fun shit with supers, and, by extension, most strategic-level operations. 
---
It'd be great if we could just tell everyone to grow some balls and play the game for all it's worth, but humans are collectively risk-averse creatures, and so we need to design the game around the expectation that most people will behave the way most people always behave. 
---
If the most effective strategies are un-fun for everyone, *people will still pick them to win* (not unfairly - losing all your shit isn't typically fun either) - leading to an un-fun game. 
---
this vid makes me want to play again
---
I'm going to click the link and hope it's the 10-hour version of the orchestral Duck Tales Moon Theme. 
---
then why are you bitching about it?
---

Crunched the numbers, Tayra has 15,330 m3 with all 4 cargo expanders in, Itty gets 13,775, Bestower gets 12,720, and Mammoth gets 13,062. This is unless each module stacks on (x+27.5%)+27.5%)....
---
big brain play n1 nice fit
---
I have a mammoth with c.33k and the same for a Bestower on a different character
---
Prob not factoring cargohold optimisation rigs
---
Why form an organisation though? Why not just FC for others?
---
You nailed how I feel about Eve's Meta.  Eve is the way it is, not just because of mechanics, but primarily because of the players themselves.  
---
The history of Eve from start of the universe, to the empires of today is an interested microcosm of human development.  (If we were immortal space psychopaths)
---
There are still fun fights for me though, so I keep logging in.  It is more difficult to fight the blob, but that just makes the victory sweeter.  
---
With the volume of WoW players and the volume of large guilds, I have no doubts this exact situation has happened there several times by now because those guilds have forums people post on just like us. 
---
The t3 is supposed to be better than t2, but since the t3 changes last year, the t3 cannot out preform any of the t2 cruisers
---
And the rebalance was over half a decade ago, fwiw.
---
it's almost as if there's an entire /r/legaladvice thread with legal advice from lawyers on this very topic, linked at the very start of this thread
---
and even they can't come to the same conclusion as you -- seems very unclear whether or not home residence matters in this case
---
Yeah I guess Tau Ceti, Red Alliance, The DRF, the Northern Coalition, Pandemic Legion, United Legion and other such groups had nothing to do with it.
---
Oh those brave old Goons, stemming the tide of BoB imperialism, single handedly... Outmanned, outgunned.
---
Also your claim that BoB was 'the only superpower' and 'had all the titans' just sort of proves you don't know anything about what you're talking about.
---
When the graphics engine was updated the UI was kept the same. It started to look like a 8 bit ui ontop of a PS4 game.
---
The players asked for it to be changed and CCP did so.
---
&lt;3 :3
---
You don’t follow the very easy app process
---
There's no stacking penalty for cargo expanders and the total capacity is indeed x*1.275^y (if you use the 27.5% expander), where x is the base amount and y the number of expanders used
---
Lokis and Prots brawl HACs fine. Source, brawling HACs 
---
That's one of my most usual "Oh fuck" moments.
---
Abyssal urself
---
Lol keep drinking the cool aid. Red Alliance was on the ropes and we came to their aid in the south East. The other groups in the north were getting hammered by Mercenary Coalition. 
---
B)

Hek died the day Brave Newbies left the system
---
it's the drones, of course it'll be rental. duh.
---
the only people who would *want* to live in the drones are renters and botters (or both).

Whatever you say dude. You're like that kid who talks about America single handedly winning WW2 because someone told him so.
---
&gt; The t3 is supposed to be better than t2
---
that's where you're wrong
---
The hardcore krabs will just spin up more rorqual alts. Cut the tank of rorquals in half along with the excavators, and we might get somewhere.
---
Cutting the tank in half sounds harsh, but they'll still be able to tank 75+ bombers, which is still ridiculous.
---
Which hile did you go for?
---
If you \*actually\* follow broadcasts and anchor from the get-go, you're probably in the top 10% of EVE players, skill-wise.
---
Something else to consider is a dirt cheap catalyst could probably alpha through its tank. 
---
Maybe give incursions a go. A while back I was in the same boat where I could only play a few hours per week, and incursions helped. HS incursions can net you about 200m and hour. It isn't a ton of ISK, but 8 hours a month and your account is paid, anything else is for savings. WTM and TVP let you start in their T1 BSs and work your way up to blingy and better ships as you make isk. 
---
god forbid somebody lose an AT ship and the pilot is actually at fault

The Gallente industrial skill also gives you Epithal, Miasmos and Kryos. Caldari industrial gives nothing extra, and the standard haulers are not exceptionally better than the Gallente ones --&gt; it's not worth to train this.

AND sound!
