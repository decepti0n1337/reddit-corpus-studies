Don't join Goons. They'll take everything that you enjoy, break you down, and rebuild you as a miner who shows up to the monthly mandatory fleet, and does no other PVP until you get bored and quit.
---

---
If you want to be in Null, Pandemic Horde and Brave Newbies are the two groups which do the most actual PVP rather than having everyone hide until some large fleet of really big ships which you're years away from flying shows up to clear out any non-friendly players who appear in their space. The other groups which actually try to do PVP instead of making it as inconvenient as possible so that people avoid doing it generally have requirements pretty far beyond what a new player can provide.
---
Here's what it's like from an outsider perspective: If you go into Goon space, you'll likely get at least a couple of carriers dropped on you. If you go into Brave space, they'll stay docked until they can form up a fleet and fight you. If you go into Horde space, there will be a bunch of nerds waiting at the front door (currently right inside the gate from Paala into LXQ2-T) looking to shoot whoever walks in with a variety of ships and absolutely no attempt to form a coherent doctrine for an effective fleet and only escalate if an actual fleet comes in (and only escalate to capital ships if capital ships or a fleet from an actual enemy like Goons comes in). Because they put the least effort into making it un-fun to roam their space, they're the ones with the most PVP opportunites just from sitting around in your home area.
---
Low-Sec (can be a better option than Null for small-scale PVP), I'd suggest going with Faction Warfare if you do that. The corporations affiliated with the Gallente militia tend to be the best-organized, with Aideron Robotics frequently advertising itself as new player-friendly. RvB, a group which is aligned with the Caldari militia (so far as I can tell, that's mainly a source of funding) while the Red half of RvB mainly fights the blue half, is also known for being a good place to develop PVP skills. It's just that they don't really do large-scale operations like you hear about in big gaming media not focused on one particular game.
---
Wormholes have good PVP options as well as plenty of other considerations (exploration-type stuff is essential there). There are a few C2 and C4 corporations which are good for new players.
---
---
---
I mean why else would you buy nodes? 
---
Easier make isk this way and just buy whatever you want in market with all the free isk you can make. People who buy other nodes hoping to win something are just feeding my wallets because I am almost always going to win with the most nodes to myself when my net has caught enough ISK to "cash out" on the remaining nodes to "salvage" back my carrot and stick.
---
You want to avoid having your extractors connect directly to a factory or there will be wasted mass. Have your extractors connect to a storage or launch facility. From there you can either connect industrial facilities, or just launch the raw to the customs office, pick it up, and take it to a planet that has no extractors, only factories and launchpads. Once you start building and playing with it you'll see how the thing works and can refine it as needed depending on how much time you want to be spending on it.
---
Until Jan 13th I believe, it's in the announcement
---
it is, dont let people fool you.
---
I just have mobile depot and a proto cloak, then call them idiots in local while I play Dota or something
---
Theres 2 English Incursion communities: Warp To Me (WTM) and TDF. 
---
WTM is a shield fleet that's very new bro friendly and flies more often throughout the day. 
---
TDF is an armor fleet and will expect and..."encourage" you to upgrade within a week 
---
I fly with WTM and recommend them personally, but I have zero experience with TDF.
---
What did you like doing before?
---
Crying in local is p lame, I certainly hope Goryn Clade members aren’t doing that. I do know that Goryn has many skilled pilots, and are one of the top corps atm when it comes to small gang pvp playstyles.
---
Were you on quafe and pills while writing this up?
---
Hope your father in law is doing well this holiday
---
I know I'm a small minority, but I have only 1 account. For me, using a 0.0 static would mean taking a lot of time rolling it. With filaments, I can go around and die to people without having to spend a lot of time mindlessly waiting on a polarisation timer.
---
Do you take a sec status hit by attacking MTU?
---
I agree. I gave up on helping out in npc corp chat as the spam has become too bad.
---
&gt;large alliance/corp but im not that active ( 1-2 days/week ~ 3h)
---
You would be more active than most people in that alliance
---
&gt; Should I join a big corp or not?
---
The real question is one we can't answer for you. Do you want to?
---
&gt;t? And is there smth that is a likely requirement ( like skillpoint, etc.)? Thanks
---
Depends what corp
---
nice!
---
Hey, glad you're still going for it and giving us updates. I had a bit of a thought about how you might fit ships since the interface for that is graphical more than textual and I think what you may find useful is downloading a program called Pyfa. The program is almost entirely text based and can import and export ship fits too and from the game. 
---
Aside from that, once you feel ready, you should find a big active corporation to fly with. People will help you, almost everyone in the game has people they help and people they are being helped by so don't feel as though your limitation will discourage people if it's the right group. The mind is where this game is really played and once you understand how it works you'll be able to make meaningful contributions to many groups of players.
---
At the moment it isn't as efficient as I wish it were, but I'm hopeful that it might improve with time. I would also love to hear from any other visually impaired players, especially if they also use screen readers.
---
Actually, I found an iOS app called Neocom 2, which seems to support similar functionality. iOS apps are very accessible when properly coded, and this one seems to be very good.
---
I appreciate the recommendation, though.
---
I guess the Gallente wasn't invited.
---
soon it will die hill time ris today
---
Jesus Christ
---
yup.
---
They did the best they could with a google search and I'm appreciative regardless.
---
Unfortunatly there are no proper WH corps attatched to K-space big blocs after the death of Hole Violence and Dropbears.
---
I would tell them just control F for things you might want to read. 
---
Doing missions? Ctrl+f mission etc.
---
you keep dodging my questions, can you discuss in good faith?
---
#do you honestly not see the difference between bots being undetected because CCP can't detect them, and people using programs like isboxer because CCP says they're allowed despite violating the EULA?
---
&gt;Isboxer itself is not illegal.
---
according to the EULA article you linked it is
---
&gt;Because you conflate lack of enforcement with legality.
---
i'm replying to a guy that's telling him to stay in highsec...
---
they can "explore" back
---
&gt; There are no allowed instances of broadcasting.
---
&gt; 
---
once again, it's surprising how utterly misled and stupid you are
---
&gt;• EVE Online client settings
---
&gt;• Window positions and arrangements (of the EVE Online client in your operating system’s desktop environment)
---
&gt;• The login process
---
wow the login process? it's almost as if you can broadcast legally there to redeem items!!!!!!
---
Where will you post an update, as a reply to /u/ggragtitans's message?
---
Sorry LadyScarlet (I promise this was like 7 months ago)
---
Until they learn game mechanics. Which is incredibly valid advice. The game is complex. Takes time to get used to it
---
&gt; you 
---
i stated a fact, WH space is the safest it's been and there are groups that aren't mega zergs that own or have a presence in their constellation exactly for what the OP describes.
---
you don't need a lot of assets to do sites, you don't need a permanent residence in your outpost systems.
---
better to do it in nullsec with people, where you get free ships instantly
---
In rust we trust. Minmatar for life.
---
  
---
They are the tribal, tattooed, shaman led freed slaves whose spaceships looked duct taped together, yet sling hot death while slaloming through the ponderous soon to be wrecks of the other empires. Each tribe is unique; some are warriors (Brutor), some are engineers (Sebiestor), some are spies (Krusual).
---
I live for the Thukker Tribe. They are the nomads, the caravaners, the travelers. They've been behind the scenes of most of the major developments of the last decade, because they're always traveling nearby when shit goes down. It's heavily implied that they were using wormholes to slip in and out of places before anyone else knew there were wormholes. They were there at the heart of the Isogen 5 entanglement and found Empress Jamyl's superweapon that killed the Minmatar Elders. They were already in Thera when it opened. There is never a lot of lore on them, but it's always fascinating. They are the space gypsies, and just as cunning and unpredictable.
---
Safe logoff makes you poof out of existence without any additional timers. You can check it with your alt.
---
Gallente, the true democracy of new eden. Plus Blasters are the best.
---
Sort would cheat, he'd pull the dildo out his ass and use it as a weapon.
---
It was also feroxes, with enemy FAX support.  Had GOTG not bailed, it still would have been unbalanced, but not what people are pretending.
---
Just checked my hypernet history and personal assets and i got a (duped) skill extractor in the reimbursement thing yesterday. Ofc i don't mind and probably not going to crash any markets with just one extractor but just saying that apparently receiving a duped item isn't that rare.
---
i never said it was easy and safe, i said it's much easier to do now than ever, and that there are groups that currently do just that and it's not hard.
---
Teach me how to solo pvp without a scout in anything bigger than a frig without dying to a gatecamping instalock super.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I´ll wait.
---
Yes, solo hunt in more places at once means more chance of content.
---
The game is definitely way slower when you are running a single account.
---
A good way to try it is to do it on test server first
---
Nice, 2 whiskies and some rubbing alcohol to clean the glasses!
---
So far all of the ones I’ve used that are supposed to drop you off in active systems have stuck me in Goonswarm or Test space. (Once I was stuck in a system with one exit, and it was gatecamped XD)
---
Weird how all their even slightly competent FCs leave or go inactive, huh?
---
eh that's your opinion, there are quite a few people invested in lore who didn't receive the empyrean age and the associated characters well. many are interested in a... more organic plot development rather than two or three characters who are super strong and key to everything. i guess the guys at ccp shared that kind of view so they pushed the empyrean age characters out so as not to be hamstrung in developing the lore. 
---
i find the tournament pretty cool tbh, it's probably the biggest mark a player can leave in the game lorewise.
---
Working as intended
---
SPACE CATHOLICS!!! Fae Victus Minmatar scum!!!
---
oh its better to be camped and log off/ take a wormhole, I see.
---
Like make it similar to a micro jump structure?
---
Except it's activated and bridges everyone nearby to the random location and destroys itself?
---
[removed]
---
t1 are extremely easy to get into.
---
maybe not 3m easy, but get an assault frigate and you'll be fine.
---
&gt; I have not seen an inconsistency when it comes input automation. Are you aware of any? (isboxer in itself does not qualify in this regard).
---
isboxer ITSELF is an inconsistency, also
---
Examples of allowed Input Broadcasting and Input Multiplexing are actions taken that do not have an impact on the EVE universe and are carried out for convenience:
---
• EVE Online client settings
---
• Window positions and arrangements (of the EVE Online client in your operating system’s desktop environment)
---
• The login process
---
&gt;CCP has been consistent enough as far as I can tell for this to not be debatable.
---
bro it's a fact isboxer breaks the eula, but is explicitly allowed by CCP
---
it's a fact, not debatable
---
same thing with near2, it's a third party program that facilitates the gathering of items but is explicitly allowed.
---
&gt;If CCP determines that all gameplay is illegal, it is illegal. Ultimately, what is allowed must be governed by how CCP intends the game to be played. Botting is illegal because it goes against such intent and hurts the game.
---
but you see the issue I've brought up right? if a rule is ignored over and over again that rule loses it's legitimacy.
---
&gt;A good faith interpretation of the EULA
---
we're not talking about good faith
---
&gt;Not particularly arbitrary when it comes to input automation.
---
only applies to gameplay, the login screen isn't gameplay.
---
In the fleets where this applies you can find the type of pilot that is intellectually overwhelmed even with just staying anchored and press F1 when told ...
---
Filaments should work both ways.      
---
Provide both sides kills.
---
DansGame. Kinda takes the "solo" out of Solo Pvp doesn't it
---
Yes mate I'm sure 6 destroyers, 3 Kirins, 1 boosher, 1 bomber, and 1 interceptor made all the difference in a fight between supercaps and dreads.
---
Wow, I understand the basic idea of a role playing game and that makes me a retard I guess.
---
But that still results in a limited amount of chilling spree challenges being completed.
---
YikerZ
---
And people wonder why buying models isn't cheap. :)
---
Sure, it might not be a great deal of materials, but it's tying up space and an asset for a significant period of time. (along with someone to keep an eye on it to make sure it's not creating a filament cloud.)
---
you are just a mountain of salt. AND all over a few dread losses lol
---
MINMATAR - FUCK YEAH
---
What time is it?
---
Not really, I think it's disrespectful to RR to imply they aren't the real drivers in that coalition, particularly with how much bluster comes out of Sort.
---
It was a good engagement and we got good metrics out of it. On to the next one.
---
You speak the truth, my friend.  Never thought of that one.
---
No, but you lot understanding the basic idea of this post does
---
no one is implying anything, you got dunked. You're the one trying to redirect by calling out darkness to please your ego.
---
Might want to look up bastionnades and change your marauder description.
---
https://youtu.be/I4jQENEsbdk
---
You have to wait out the 15 minute aggression timer before you can use another filament.
---
People should be grabbing combat probes instead of camping on a gate.
---
I like Amarr the most. They seem to be the most stable and slavery is cute.
---
For three people? Sure.
---
The T1 filaments are a piece of cake and an absolute blast to do. They shouldn't be too hard. T2 filaments are a bit of a challenge for newer players so you will likely lose some ships. T3s are a fair bit of difficulty and the first level where I'd say T2 or pirate frigates are almost essential to complete them. T4s absolutely require something like a Worm or an AF, and I've not bothered with T5 frigate abyssals.
---
Try to fit to run your propmod (afterburner or microwarpdrive) cap stable with an active tank running. And work on getting T2 frigate skills and T2 small gun skills, they're going to be absolutely essential outside the filaments. Frigates are an absolute blast to fly.
---
Duh
---
If ghost training was still a thing, that would be the best set of characters in the game.
---
Goons won eve already.
---
TEST is the runner up.
---
Everybody else exist only because one of the above hasn't bothered to kill them yet.
---
Garmur, Flycatch, Tengu, Drek, Widow.
---
Joining a Faction-Warfare Corp that is new-player friendly sounds like a really good idea!
---
It doesn’t remove it, rolling static’s does mean you can go home after roaming unlike with filaments
---
The entirety of the caldari capitals. It almost feels like they were just out of ideas by the time they got to them. And while I love minmatar designs probably the best, their titan the rag looks like a gnarly mangled turd after a week of constipation, given their Norse mythology themes I assume its suppose to resemble some sort of serpent which makes me think it would prolly been more appropriate to name it nidhogger instead of the carrier.
---
probably, just as much as it must suck being an ex-goon watching goons becoming the new bob and PL (of all alliances) being more similar to what goons used to be
---
I love my enforcer for allowing me to not train frigate 5 on my scanning alt.
---
Well, at least one guy bothered enough to take control and managed to kill a couple cruisers.
---
Also I guess your options are somewhat limited if every ship you bring for defense has not only to face the people that are at war with you, but also CONCORD.
---
A Raven bashing fleet lmao, the penultimate high sec carebear experience.
---
haha - I would've thought about it the other way around - each anomaly now holds 1000x the ore. But once it's gone, it never respawns. 
---
Asteroid belts now span for thousands of kilometers and hold a lot of ore, but also once depleted they replenish very slowly (over a year or so, with nothing happening in the first months).   
---
You need to scan down ore anomalies, they randomly spawn in some systems - super large ones are easy to scan down (size of asteroid belts). Smaller ones are harder to scan down but you can go hunting for rare materials in them (can hold anything, including moon materials) so the fast agile prospector fleets also have a thing to do.   
---
Moon mining would remain the only reasonable way to go in your own space - increase the chunks, or the number of moons idk. Mining ops on resource heavy systems should take years and spawn infrastructure in place (much like the ORE space came to be).
---
Just copying Initiative, they are hisec carebears after all..., except that they are not :-))
---
Frigate - Stiletto
---
Destroyer - Jackdaw
---
Cruiser - Muninn
---
Battlecruiser - Drake
---
Battleship - Leshak
---
tese are the best ships for pressing f1 in
---
A valid tactic against cruise phoenix’s :p
---
So some folks that remotely heard about EVE once or twice will try roaming? Thats cute.
---
I often wonder about this response, if you don't want to have CONCORD in your game play then why play in hisec?   It is like going into a forest in the country side and complaining about the trees cutting out the light and preventing you from getting a tan.
---
It's just a bunch of losers who follow CODE around 20 hours a day 365 days a year failing to stop ganks, gloating that they killed a fort after pretty much every freighter ganker quit the game (so nobody to defend it anymore)
---
They were pretty hungry for a win after 6 years of constant failure
---
What did you do before?
---
You probably got downvoted because you didn't notice the tactical irrelevance of having 'tackle clearers' on a field you held unmolested.
---
But then again no one ever accused Darkness of tactical brilliance, hell your brightest light was Kenshin. for the longest time.
---
Hey at least you don't have to drop 50 bucks on an expansion every now and then on top of that subscription fee that has been pretty standard in the industry since the days of M.U.Ds
---
I would too if I was that dense.
---
Imagine being in a corp where nobody comes to defend your fortizar.
---
I occasionally will run a gang of 4 alts in hecates and my main in a dictor, it’s actually not as hard as it sounds
---
One month of eve Costs  the same as a cheese pizza, and not a good cheese pizza - but a crappy one from some chain like dominos. If you like the game just pay the subscription - that way you don’t turn Eve into a second job.
---
Lol, O7 fly safe
---
Happens when you give the worst pilots in the galaxy a way to outplay all others by just carebearing their asses of to build 500% as much Titans and Supercaps after 2016 that were built in the 13 years of EVE before ...
---
Frigate - Stabber
---
Destroyer - Thrasher  
---
Cruiser - Loki  
---
Battlecruiser - Tornado  
---
Battleship - Megathron
---
Ashes to ashes, trashes to trashes
---
so a gatecamp setup?
---
I am the more risk averse one :(
---
The first stage of grief is to train for the catalyst :)
---
CCP balance team? Heard of them? Lul.
---
RMT has a tradition especially amongst alliance leaderships, like the old NC (MM vukLau) or all that Technetium ISK of Goonswarm that did not convert into a Superfleet for their members like in NC/PL back in OTEC times. thats a fact yes. Also Circle of Hell is a fact.
---
What also is a fact that especially the combination of RR and AoM is taking that problem to whole new levels and making it a really bad economical problem for the games health where in former times it was collateral that did not affect the server economy as it does now. I mean none of the old RMT convicts had sweatshop-programs run by alliance ledership to sell Supercarriers and the necessary Injectors to basically all new members.
---
Your seriously deluded if you don't think ganking has died.... Please go compare some killboard data....
---
Start new corp and lead people?
---
Yes! The entire story of how the Caldari and Gallente grew up "together" but also apart is a fascinating one.
---
Tenal is not really in direct range, especially for supercaps.
---
They did not renew their permits?
---
I think that as soon as you attempt to anchor it you can be war decked.   Not 100% certain, but I think that is how it works.
---
Naaah.  Watching CODE get their dicks knocked into the dirt is always worth a look, to me.
---
other day we got one that sent us to esoteria v0v
---
That's pretty damn cool man
---
You're fundamentally misunderstanding the entire point of a nano super - you're not supposed to chase subs you can't even hold with them lmao
---
The whole purpose show off to sabres.
---
When I briefly suicide ganked in Niarja I just picked a random freeport to sit criminal nados on...
---
It would be unbalanced isk wise yea, just because feroxs trade well. But they might have accomplished their objectives. Who knows
---
Hi, /u/N1PvPr - you truly are Eve's Number 1 PVPer.
---
Amazing foresight?  
---
It's CODE.  It's hardly amazing that no one would fucking care. lol   
---
Amazing foresight is when Mittani start to flap that festering hole in the bottom of his face, and you turn him off before the first syllable.
---
They ripped out the rigs lmao
---
Jesus Christ dude he means barely used. One man for an entire station isn’t exactly busy now is it?
---
This.  I got ganked in an empty blockade runner trying to dock at Jita 4-4 by a 'nado last Saturday.
---
If ganking went away it would spoil the game.  What's fun of Eve if you can't die anywhere any time?
---
yes pls :&gt;
---
If you're not into efficiency:
---
Triglav recon hunting. (My favourite)
---
L3 missions are chill.
---
Mining.
---
LOL
---
Underrated comment here - so many structures have at least parts of their fits dictated by what was in the fittings can at the time they needed to be fitted, not by what should be in a ideal world.
---
It's because CODE. only skill for 2 things, a ganking trasher or ganking nado. Code and actual PVP? Golly gosh, I wonder when they ever will.
---
Gotta go where line members actually join fleets, have the doctrines in hand, know how to broadcast, know how to anchor, be willing to fly what's needed, and are willing ti set their med clone to staging so I'm not waiting for half my fleet to fly from the other side of the damned region! I fully understand competent commanders wanting basic fleet skills out of their line members.
---
You think they havent taken back items/isk from sales for things like faction forts that the players that had them duplicated reported as a bug to CCP? 
---
I like your optimism
---
Yes its super easy
---
yeah, and that nerf is a massive reduction in content for us to the point where we just all quit
---
it's not easy to compensate for it, otherwise we would have
---
Just dont be bored.
---
I like how the Gallente Federation kept their wine glass. I guess they like to drink a little too much... lmao
---
It's the same price it was in 2009
---
God forbid you have to actually be logged in and ready for content instead of waiting for someone to ping you
---
thats true... i heard about that ;)
---
and yet the mighty code cant send one of there ultramultiboxers to blap them
---
This. I'm a new player (approx 2 weeks) and the hookbill is acceptable for T1-T3 without major issue. I've dragged friends into doing abyssals with me. They're veterans but have never done them before. We currently run T3 darks easily with 2x Hawk and 1x Hookbill. Their advantage over me in the Hookbill is small without going with a blingy fit.
---
why do you need 8 suicide points? Does it take you 20 minutes to form?
---
Hey, you can do it. Heres how:        
---
- First, get your character ID through API. Head out to https://esi.evetech.net/ui/ and select "search", then "/search/". Click on "try it out" (right hand side) on the grey bar. Set "type of entity" as "character", then put in the "The string to search on" field your character names. Set "strict match" to true. Hit execute.       
---
The return value is your character ID. Keep it.      
---
[Spoiler: Its 1308483663 for Ono Matsuyama and 1338709185 for Sonya Lee]
---
- Then, go to http://cdn1.eveonline.com/data/OldCharPortraits_256.zip and download the 14GB file.      
---
- Unzip it, search for the two ID's. And thats it. 
---
Have a nice one
---
I know how to fit a rorq, it's more I've been tp'd with a filament pretty close to home say 20 jumps or less, it really wouldn't take much for a group to have something close to the area you filament to by chance and blops  bridge to a cyno if they tackled something juicy.  It's just a scenario I've ran through my head. Is it likely no, can it happen? Absolutely.
---
To add to your fitting notes from what I've been trying - a micro warp drive is super valuable. You can forego quite a bit and make up for skill-based mistakes by just outrunning your problems... especially in the frigates.
---
&gt; they usually bring me to friendly space    
---
you could spam filaments as a rng shortcut to get through friendly space
---
You can easily change ship types in station, provided you have both of them stocked. 
---
That's just the basics of preparation lol
---
Good to see CVA dudes still making shit up. I had literally just got back from work lmao.
---
Also seriously what the fuck? Literally never threatened any of that shit, you're literally making shit up out of thin air... Get some fucking help dude.
---
tasty tears
---
hurts small groups more than big groups thanks ccp
---
Hey next time make sure you have a EpiPen on hand. You could get shock.
---
is that how he got promoted to 23rd best fc?
---
Ah, that I agree with.
---
I think competent people could figure that out....... bump. Scram die repeat 2 min later.
---
You fucked up.... star of northern moons are nc. Allies
---
You guys are misunderstanding what I wrote - the whole idea is that by making the problem more in-your-face, CCP will be more inclined to act.
---
Sadly, CCP's negligence is on a level I didn't anticipate. You're right - there's no winning this.
---
Spod rock ate your brain cells away?
---
didn't want that w anyway
---
tapi logic hurts me
---
An vast improvment, in my opinion
---
Check my Zkill (Hoed Cosmere)...
---
I don’t feel so lucky XD
---
I joined a null block week 1. Any time is the best time for a new player.
---
Plot twist: you're using the information to also design the ultimate bot while learning to play.
---
Props to you and good luck! Hope you get to enjoy EVE! And don't forget to reach out to other players as well.
---
I saw a few of them in system but I honestly had no idea what their MO was.  I'm sure they'll find other ways to have fun blowing up delicious miner meat. :p
---
I dont mind getting downvoted.  
---
But I d be interested in why ppl actually do it. A simple downvote doesnt tell me much.  
---
Well... Cant be helped. vOv
---
Did you manage to get a license from CCP for selling their ship models? 
---
I attempted to but was only told it was illegal and I had to stop. Who did you contact?
---
Thanks!
---
Skip the mining.  It's boring.  Go for some missions.  Even trade missions.  It's a little more active
---
I sure was more than giggling when I saw it. I was laughing so hard I was in pain
---
The nyx refits to plates and his armor jumps up. They dont understand how he 'repped' so much armor. They lock up the nestor but dont shoot it too :S
---
Even more greedy Chinese mouths to feed money into begin to surface... 
---
Is CCP still even developing their game, or are they just following orders?
---
now i gotta ask. are you really that retarded?
---
