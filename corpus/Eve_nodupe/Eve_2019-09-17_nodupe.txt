Define toxic. I want to see what you consider toxic.

---
---
It's true that it slightly underperforms the barges especially when the barges are boosted, but it can form the core of your mining fleet if you want to build one at a later date because of the boosts it can offer.
---

---
The number one advantage of the Orca is the enormous ore bay. It's designed for fleet support, so you can get a pretty respectable bay on it (300k) which means you never have to return to station for hours. In ice fields, where people regularly field big blobs of barge alts, this makes the Orca the superior choice because what it loses in yield to a solo barge it more than makes up for in total uptime. If you ever have your chars mine together, it can also serve as a big container for a barge, thereby increasing uptime on both characters.
---
The second big advantage for longer AFKs like when you're just studying or watching movies or generally doing something else is that its yield is primarily drone mining. This means you can mine 5 rocks at the same time, at the measly depletion rate of one drones' worth per rock. In 0.5 sec you can comfortably walk away for 2 hours without any input needed. The Porp can do this too but its ore hold isn't as large so it may not be able to take full advantage.
---
Not at all. What I'm saying is that if CCP wants this game to survive they have to listen to its playerbase, rational or not.
---
&gt; fitted with 2x 75 MM Rail Guns and 1x 125mm
---
So cute, keep it up!
---
(Tip: Using different guns on your ship, often seen by newbros, is generally not a good idea. A single gun type-only will allow you to maximize your engagement effectiveness. For instance by sticking within the optimal range of your guns, which can be shown by hovering your mouse over them.)
---
No, that means doing your best to not get tackled in the first place. But for Rorqs thats pretty impossible right? So the only other means is by having a standing fleet that is prepared and active to help you out. And with the old cynos shit was still dying. No it just became pretty impossible to save ships against certain fleetsizes and fleetcomps.
---
You can say what you want but at some point you need to start listen. This is the same shit as the BO, if it doesnt work then you will see a negative outcome and it will get reverted. The negative outcome is already here.
---
Goonswarm
---
The you people is me grouping with the rest of the elite pvpers. Since you choose to group me with goons it is only accurate.
---
The point is blackout didn't change your claimed play style, because if people wanted to bring those fights they would. What blackout did was make it easier for you to kill unsuspecting krabs and then disappear into the night.
---
Cyno changes are the thing that support your claimed play style but again thats only because "elite pvpers" get upset when anyone brings a bigging fleet than them.
---
I also like how the only wording that upset you was when it was something you agree with and are still resorting to personal attacks. Can't get the fights you want in eve, can't argue on reddit.
---
Ye those afk VNIs surely broke the economy with their 15m ticks. The horror!
---
Dont try to make it like afk cloaky ships dont do anything dude. If they didnt do anything then why would people use them? Its used for content denial and you can mess up a region by simply getting more alts that do nothing but skillfarm. And you say they dont do anything against the economy? Or affect the game? Their votes arent used to elect CSM members or drive PLEX prices up cause of injectors?
---
NOTHING SHOULD BE 100% SAFE WHEN UNDOCKED. This is the basic principle of Eve. Dont try to change this just because you like something. Be a man.
---
Oh CCP style?:)
---
There is a large contingent of players who prefer structured pvp, but since CCP has never catered to them, the only reason they are still here is that they have nowhere else to go.
---
Lol ye thats true. I honestly wouldnt mind a longer revert now that you mention it. Whatever kills the fking rorq.
---
1. There is definitely some people who quit and didn't come back
---
2. There is some people who liked blackout and now may be quitting because it ended
---
3. Even before blackout there was strong downtrend on player numbers, so we can guess that even without blackout numbers would be lower after this 66 days period
---
If a cloaky camper is afk, explain to me the process by which it can hurt you?  It's fear that prevents you from doing something, not the afk camper.  Fear is your enemy. Luckily for you, CCP traffics in safety these days, so you rarely have to face your fears.
---
Hunters would just group up and only kill targets they can delete in a few seconds. Just watch bomber gangs killing domis and myrms. There is no way to defend against it.
---
Thats true. I mean in this case I fear its ignorance that drives the narrative but I wanted to not create more conflict than there already is. But ignorance and lies go hand in hand I guess.
---
150+ regularly
---
I'm going to let you in on a little secret - I don't care enough about you or your opinions to look at your flair.  I just assumed you were a mindless null drone like the rest and reacted accordingly.  Good news though - I still don't care.
---
&gt; So firstly I have lived in every sec status and have done everything but capital construction (not my thing).
---
I've done all of the above (heck, my first nearly 3 years was entirely in w-space), plus I've built capitals.  I'm currently 'baby-sitting' three titan BPO and a supercarrier BPO for a friend that trusts me.  Indy is my thing.
---
I agree that citadels are broken, but not for the reasons you stated.
---
From an indy point-of-view, citadels are broken because they are not on-par with POS industry functionality (structure &amp; rig bonuses), nor defensive ability.
---
I really don't care about the week long timers.  I'll trade those for better defence (POS-grade).
---
Though asset safety is nice, and I'd abandon lowsec without it, I'd also give that up for a return to remote station usage.  However, without asset-safety or other asset security, there is no way in he** I'd move my BPO into lowsec / nulsec / w-space.
---
Well I never trust any shit like this and will have cover for myself anyway. Knowing CCP they'll fix it on the sly and not announce they did it for weeks or months.
---
You should have quit when you had the chance now you just look like a whiny fuck who is angry only a few people agree with you.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
" magine actually believing CCP gives a flying fuck about what people post on reddit. "  
---
I guess you missed the interview where Hilmar actually mentions reddit as a place they are actively monitoring for ideas and feedback.
---
EveOffline shows that, even if "a lot" of people were happy, more were unhappy. Period.
---
Some attacks have been coming through since then. I think the first wave of attacks are the ones they cant handle but they can stabilise after it. Have no idea how this shit works in reality tho, Im very clueless when it comes to IT.
---
[Found something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_LwdYlPNCE) that might be a good inspiration for the Angels' music. I think it needs more techno and a faster beat, but it's a good start.
---
I dislike Keepstar on a Star simply because that makes the undock WAAAY too bright to sit on.
---
One per system seems fine though.
---
Yeah cos there are way more krabs than pvp players it makes sense.
---
How do you know hes afk? You are pulling grade school arguments. You know yourself its wrong. But you want to keep it in the game. 
---
But it doesnt matter. The principle of nothing being safe when undocked trumps everything else. Cloaky ships can sit with impunity in 100% safety. It should go. If I had said afk VNIs should be 100% safe people would have lost their shit. Its hypocrisy.
---
[Found it](https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/d2nbwp/good_sir_you_may_suckith_my_testicles_as_your/). That's some real grammatically-incorrect salt there...

---
imagine buying into corporate PR bullshittery in tyool 2019. grow the fuck up.
---
You can play a game and still have no vision on it. it's the case for 90% of eve online players. the extreme majority are casual, relying on their CEO, FC, or just chilling in barges or doing L1 missions in caracals or L2 with battleships ....
---
It's basically a static PVE game now.. how hard can it be??
---
alright got it, thankyou  
---
so it's safe to say that my asset is safe right..
---
The problem I have with removing asset safety is that it removing it would help the game in the short term, but hurt it in the long term.
---
It'd be way more fun to get lots of loot out of blowing up a keepstar, but if you had  ~10 bil to your name, 8 bil of it was in that keepstar, a lot of people will just stop playing in that scenario. 
---
Plus the onslaught of destruction that'd occur right after the change would pretty much solidify the current large blocs permanent dominance.
---
I get it your angry, blackout was everything you ever wanted, too bad the majority of the player base would rather play other games then put up with that bullshit.
---
The way some people use "logic" in this sub.
---
Okay, can someone explain what I'm looking at here? I'm not sure if I'm reading the ZKill right, but it looks like two of those people killed you by ramming or something? It lists their hulls as doing the most damage...
---
You mean just like nullsec anoms )))))
---
I *think* it's just pirate factions that have faction capitals; Guristas, Serpentis, Blood Raiders. The Revenent is the exception to the rule because it drops via lowsec Incursions. 
---
I could be wrong though; I'm basing most of this from when I lived in Gallente lowsec and roamed about in null for people to shoot.
---
The day you roam and actually help the miner instead of trying to kill it.
---
Oh god, that's a classic.
---
They have no roadmap, that's why they sold it.
---
You assumed I was mindless because to think otherwise would be to admit you are wrong. And we both know that is basically impossible. Don't worry now that blackout is down there will actually be more krabs for you to kill and there will be more krab deaths than during blackout. So even your real play style was buffed by this change.
---
You don't know if he's afk.  But its the unknown that has you afraid to play.  That's fear talking, not logic or reasoning.  And now that only a select group of ships carry cynos, it's even sillier.  Just go about your business. Worst case scenario, you get a fight or can countergank.  Best case, he's afk and won't bother you.  It's fear.  You're scared.  You don't realize it, but that's what's holding you back - fear of loss.  Just get over it and play the damn game.
---
What if I told you that there were cheaper ships that don't require 64 hours to break even?
---
Where?
---
Thanks for proving my point. \\o/
---
THERE'S NO AMERIUS LIKE KARASH AMERIUS!

&gt;5. Killmail/Battlereport with no AAR

i dont think no player has truly lost complete interest in the game,  its just that nothing is compelling chaos wasnt sold as a product with a feature set,  sov was untouched, entosis untouched,  my subscriptionunsubbed :D
---
No cringe-laughing moments please, we've got enough negativity floating around this sub already. ≧ロ≦
---
Yeah, one per system is the gist of it. Maybe a polarized field emitter station service lmao.
---
One spawns as one of the missions in the Sisters of Eve epic arc, haven’t seen that carrier killer tho
---
City of heroes style mission architect tool, but for eve missions, deadapace pockets, anomolies, combat sigs, etc?
---
It could work. But I can't imagine (current) CCP are the ones who could pull it off.
---
No I'm hoping they go up so I can make a profit. I cashed out before I unsubbed.
---
Literally no one asked for this. But way to make a bug into politics.
---
Do you care to explain how they get used then?
---
What makes you think i care about blackout or where this game is headed beyond laughing at idiots who are too dumb to not get killed by shit once it shows up on grid?
---
You have to go back in time, I hear that's impossible but my wife seems to think otherwise 🙄
---
No need to be a troll fella
---
Maybe they want to PvE sometimes, and PvP other times.
---
Wow. Just wow
---
You are right in a lot of what you say, but i don't think it's a case of PVE vs PVP players, as lot of players wear many hats. In fact, PvP players are the most likely to have moneymaking PvE or industry alts so that they can fund their habit.
---
What you are dead-on however is the change in nullsec mentality and culture, and the herding of rookies to join the biggest groups available and perpetuate the vicious cycle of stagnation. That's the core issue (along with the unsustainable economy it creates), not the "krabs vs cloakers" mudslinging we've been mostly seeing here.
---
Coincidentally, i was out with a long-time gamer friend today discussing EvE's recent troubles. He never played it but is interested in how it works, so we've had quite a few discussions over time about how the game works.
---
Plus the guy is probably in the perfect demographic of potential EvE players (25, close to finishing his studies, likes complex and challenging games) he should be right at home playing EvE, right?
---
Wrong. Here are the cliff notes of the important bits and questions a potential newbro gave me during the course of the discussion. Watch the escalation of tone and topics covered and draw your own conclusions:
---
* How effective can i be as a new player in "world pvp"? Is the SP gap too much to overcome? Are there ships that can only be countered by having more of the same ships, or can i bring 100 friends with worse "gear" and kill one guy with top end "gear"?
---
* Why should i start playing a game where the only way to influence something important is to skip to the biggest ships available, or join the biggest groups available? If i start a MMO game, i want to have a reasonable chance of success both across various points in the progression and in making my own story and carving my own path. I like playing with a group, but not being treated as a unit in a RTS game played by the 50 top players.
---
* If things are like that, why don't they just delete smaller ship classes entirely, make big ships cheaper and more available to all? Will the veterans complain too much for losing the gap and the advantage that goes with it?
---
* What do people do with all that money and "gear" they "farm" if they don't use for PvP? Isn't it meaningless to just hoard it for its own sake?
---
* If players can't accept changes for the good of the game the company should just kill it and start a remake, or go through with the changes anyway, let the disgruntled part of the playerbase leave, take the the loss if they can shoulder it and make room for new blood.  Waiting for the game to die off by making it impossible for upstarts to get playing in a way that doesn't involve established supergroups is wasted bandwidth.
---
Make of this what you will, especially in light of EvE's well known retention issues. It's not only the NPE, tutorials and UI. It's something deeper.
---
When you give an outsider that fits the criteria for potential player the run-down on the game, letting him ask the questions himself and not guiding him to your own viewpoint, and his reply basically is "why would i bother with a bunch of people i have no chance of competing against, unless joining them and letting them shape the way i play the game?", there's a problem.
---
Considering the computational power behind the Eve Server Cluster one can only hope that CCP does not creat Skynet this way...
---
This is the problem and it should not be CCP job to protect me against non consensual PvP. 
---
With the recent hammer drop on null sec krabbing,  buffing abyssal safety wouldn’t really make sense.
---
This point is such a bad one. "It comes at very little real effort" sure, day to day you are right, it does come at very little effort, I will agree.
---
But please think over what it took to reach the stage wherein it takes little effort day to day. As the old saying goes, Rome wasn't built in a day - it took more man hours than I would even dream of trying to calculate to reach this stage, Goons at one time had no supers, same of most alliances that have stood the test of time, they built up to them, and they built the out of game services to support their members. They cultivated the ecosystem that they live in, and the diplomacy to get where they are.  Every alliance worth its salt didn't just spring into being out of the black of space one day, and those that did I think it is fair to say sprang from someone else's shadow instead. Stop and think, how much went into making Goons into the organisation it is, Delve into the place it is, the super umbrella into the power house it is. I am talking the man hours, I am talking ISK, even cold hard cash to fund servers and the likes. How much effort have other groups like TEST put in to following and replicating the proven model?
---
You're largely right there and the age of chaos crap made the problem worse by giving all of nullsec a common adversary, CCP themselves.
---
Still, no nullsec bloc wants peace, to just sit around farming. This is how we all die. The problem previously had been that fighting wars is too costly. The war that was ended by the drifter invasion was mostly just us blowing up undefended citadels which were simply replaced when we left. 
---
To bring back war two main things need to happen.
---
1. It needs to be easier. Currently it takes too many people too many hours of chores to even get to the point of starting to create timers, let alone setting up for actual fights. Citadel mechanics, timezone tanking, jump fatigue, and various other problems all conspire to make war more work than fun.
---
2. We need to know the rules and be able to trust the rules aren't going to be changed on us without warning. The trust is gone on this one, it will take CCP re-examining their processes and then following them long enough for the trust to be rebuilt for this to change.
---
There are many other problems to be addressed, but this is the worst of it which can be addressed without major development resources.
---
"Don't worry," CCP said. "Though the concept of PvE in privately instanced space goes against the nature of EVE, we'll make sure there's still a way to hunt these Abyssal runners. They'll come out Suspect from the T4/T5 filaments, and you'll be able to camp the exits."
---
Holy shit I just played the new SS Second Galaxy App game it’s a complete ripoff of EvE I can’t say I’m surprised anything that comes out of china is a complete ripoff of everyone else’s hard work like the Fake Apple store and Fake iPhones
---
yes this carrier deal tiny damage but horrendal neuts.  im looking for  more data about the npc spawns of capitals on asteroid belts/anoms so and locations what can get in certain nullsec system. 
---
im trying to find post/devblog about the first time encounter of npc spawns to maybe find my answer there but search on reddit is broken.
---
maybe they flipped of local for 3 months to chase out the carebears looking for Farmville in space?  One could hope.
---
This is Eve, news flash, it's been this way for 15 years. If you think CCP would implement that feature over others I have a deal for you that will double your isk.
---
It's faster to use a discord bot. A group of 10 guys had a bot for checking prices in jita. It's not hard to program one for fuel and timers.
---
With a grain of salt.
---
As you are almost certainly alone wherever your PC is, must be you reeeing if you can hear it.
---
PVPers are also what keeps any crafting playstyle from completely devaluing to worthlessness, by providing a need for replacements.
---
This is itching my resubs
---
I don't disagree with you, especially on the first point. I'm not sure that I would agree with all the solutions you have for them, but I think most people would agree that these are the major problems. Requiring a three hour play session to do anything rewarding is pretty absurd, especially with an aging playerbase and alternatives that are good
---
Good times man :) (dartien btw)
---
(in-game)
---
Was pretty sure he was going to help the miner, then kill him when the pirates left.
---
there is always stagnation brah ... its part of eve atm . But a lot of stuff like Project discovery , o7 show and other good things went with her .
---
Point was injectors made it easier for people already making a lot on rorqs to inject more rorqs and scale up. Ofc the problem exists now and it would be hard to change. The nerfs to rorqs mostly hurt those who could only run say 1-2. Even me running 3 rorqs makes less than what abyssals could do with 3 accounts, or a few other things. 3 isn't bad by any means but the nerfs hurt the smaller people more, who were not hardcore mining early in the rorq days :D But injectors also at a guess are mostly used by vets to inject more and more capital toons. Result of which is even faster capital proliferation.
---
No doubt, wasn’t expecting to be uplifted but yeah...  
---
I myself am just coming back to EVE only for the PVP having largely missed out on the experience the first couple runs of playing.
---
Let’s assume everything above was true.  Getting new blood hooked into PVP should be a bigger focus for CCP.  They have plenty of PVE wealth opportunities but bolstering PVP opportunities wouldn’t hurt to draw folks in and keep them coming back.  I know there is money to be made already but I feel that most would struggle to come out isk positive and they know it.  Also the impression that new players can’t take on vets because of the skill gap.
---
EVE PVP is so robust it’s a shame it isn’t getting more focus.
---
Oh take a number bitch.
---
I liked the impact the blackout seemed to have on botters. It didn’t stop all botting obviously, but it definitely ruined a lot of their fun. 
---
It pisses me off so goddamn much that PLEX and skill injector prices are stupidly high because we have to subsidize bot cancer. A few months ago, we were paying 1b for a skill injector so that Supercarrier bot #13582748 can sell his ISK for Yuan.
---
Don't listen to him there is no cake.

My buddy and I were running high sec Guritas event sites for several hours.  We were multiboxing a small fleet ( he had his main and an alt, I had my main and two alts).  We were power rushing these sites near Dodi when my buddy happened upon a drifter worm hole.  My bud who has been playing for over a decade had never been in a drifter hole so he warped to it, and jumped in.  The hole promptly closed, drifters popped him, and he lost 4 or so hours worth of skins, loot, and quafe.  I was flabbergasted.  Here is a guy whose alt's alt had more sp than my main and he was so delighted to see something new that he forgot his character was carrying all our loot for that evening.  That is the funniest thing that happened to me in eve.

Well said but we’ll leave the light on for ya at Hotel New Eden ;)

People who's still in the game will stay without a discount.
---
People who left during blackout have for the majority lost trust in ccp and/or found another game to enjoy, so most likely they wont be back.
---
CCP needs to propose something really new, other than just new mining/ratting mechanics all based on scouting/grinding, they need to give a very new fresh air to the game for it to be attractive again, and overall , they need to find solutions to prevent blue donuts and hegemony of big blocks considering their members as if they were lemming.
---
So here is what happens.  You go to help the miner, his friends show up and blow up the pirates.  They see you and smile as they tally another kill.
---
Or
---
You arrive at some fictitious battle because there hasn't been a reason for conflict in over 5 years.  The Fleet Commander bitches you out for showing up in a Drake, Spod bless you, and before you can realize what "primary the Drake" means you are podded back to Hi Sec.  They may go on to win the fight because the appropriate sacrifices to the PvP gods have been made.
---
You could have said all that in 1/3 of the sentences. Don't feel obliged to match my word count you know, since you have trouble maintaining coherence anyway.
---
But i'm glad you came out and established the fact that you don't want a discussion, you just want to shout down people of different opinions with insults, you cute little fascist you, hiding behind a keyboard across the world :)
---
With this mentality i'm surprised you're even here, since r/eve is a waste of your profound talents. You could get very high-profile jobs in a totalitarian state you know.
---
P.S. I can keep doing this forever. Now go away or i will taunt you a second time (bonus Monty Python reference).
---
Awesome input. This very part is why all this nostalgia BS is pure BS. The players and even the entire world is way different from old school Eve, its simply not feasible to try and recreate it. Instead you need to build upon what is currently working, a more casual Eve. These last years, even though many might disagree, have built a very solid foundation (that needs tweaking tho). We should try to use this foundation to gain more players instead of trying to tear it down in the hopes of people that left might come back.
---
Because in the end we dont know why those players really left.
---
For the 500 millionth time, the bots created new accounts and moved to high sec, there are a hundred threats with proof showing that. If you still believe its bots then you are retarded

Time to do all of my filaments in Jita
---
&gt;As a question, wouldn't it be easier just to have a rota of people whose job it is to go around and refuel the gates on a regular basis?
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Like, gas stations get their fill ups on a weekly basis, regardless of whether or not their fuel tanks are actually empty.
---
&gt;I mean, if there are people who find mining rewarding (I kinda fit into that crowd) then it shouldn't be too hard to find people who find being a space trucker rewarding.
---
Truckers get paid in a convertible currency, and that pay is necessary for living. Not so for gates.
---
Refuels are already sub 1-week, btw.
---
Everyone thinks "Oh it's simple, just do it" until you have to do it 10,000 times.
---
&gt; translation: my group is too antisocial to gatecamp and catch the slow  warping t3c, or help each other in anyway so please just delete them so i  dont have that problem anymore 
---
Do you find refitting at mobile depots too complex? Even without nanos or stabs, a T3C is still very unlikely to get caught at a gatecamp, and it doesn't take too much brainpower to figure out that you can use a travel fit when checking for gatecamps.
---
&gt; srsly have you ever went roaming?  Unless you have 0 friends near you,  "gankers" going into your space shouldnt be outnumbering you all the  time. 
---
Do I REALLY have to explain this to you? REALLY?
---
It doesn't matter if there are more blues in the region, constellation, or even solar system when one of your ratters gets ganked - all that matters is how many can get to the tackled ship in time to save it. Everyone on the ganking side is typically there from the outset, while the ratter is almost always alone. It takes time for the defending side to assess the situation and react, and during that time, the victim is outgunned and/or outnumbered.
---
Ratting in a larger group would not only be much less profitable and make fair distribution of bounties difficult, but would also attract larger groups of gankers - unless you have a large coalition's entire super fleet ratting together, SOMEONE is eventually going to bring enough firepower to slaughter you in a one-sided gank for all those juicy killmails. Without ratting ships being able to fit cynos, the attackers know exactly what they are facing and can ensure that they bring enough firepower to make the fight one-sided. You could rat in a massive gang of N titans, and someone would gank you with an N\*20-man dreadbomb.
---
&gt; Not only can they get caught on gates, ive killed several t3c in old  ratting vni. even easier with a domi now,  get a warp disruptor for  helping with drone aggro and then you can put neuts in the highslots and  an MJD in the mids. and bam, you cant get ganked easily. really that  simple 
---
See above point. Chances are, your domi isn't going to get ganked by a single T3C. Even if it is, and the T3C fails to kill you, chances are good it will escape and come back with friends next time. Even if you DO kill it, the pilot will know to bring more friends in the future - so you will survive one gank and MAYBE get a single kill (but probably not), then you have the great honor of dying to slightly larger ganks in the future. Go you!
---
&gt; also super easy to bait people. have friends waiting in station. 1  jaguar and some dps = dead ganker. vast majority are bad and solo so  really easy to kill them. 
---
You're looking at it from the perspective of the ganker - "oh it's easy to stop ganks, you just have to have a defense fleet in system and ready to react to me as soon as I show up! Every time the defenders did this, my gank failed; so it's obviously an easy and effective counter."
---
It's entirely unreasonable for the only "counter" to a single player in a subcap invading your space to be "always have a dedicated defense force in every system that is always ready to jump to the rescue on seconds' notice."
---
Even if someone actually managed to pull that off, gankers would cry a river of tears and get CCP to nerf it somehow, just like they did to umbrellas.
---
I wish you'd just stick to autisticly screeching to your line members via pings, rather than post here

\+1 low power citadels need to DIE

Hell yeah dude, this is a fun read.

I dont know whether to laugh or cry...

how about acl managed wallets
---
Everyone else was dying because the hegemony of Imperium, hegemony of big blocks ruin the game

You'd be surprised how many kills you can get in WH solo, actually.  Unlike NS, we don't need node-crashing fleets of supers in order to PvP.

You circumvent the argument by putting it on me. When you give me a good reply to why someone should be 100% safe when undocked Ill maybe listen.

I get ridiculed for this about two or three times every month, I hope you feel good hahaha
---
So many people who is asking for what whey call "right" changes don't understand truth revealed by blackout
---
There is no way CCP could implement any changes that impact casual players income/safety/comfort without any loss
---
There can be big losses as with blackout, or smaller ones, but there is always no gains in short term.
---
And they seem to not have any long term plan RN.
---
Thats how PvP in most games works. WoW does that through Battlegrounds and Arena for example.
---
You get rewards on par with PvEing for your effort and nobody has to worry about losing anything.
---
There will always be exceptions to the rule. Too bad she's gone
---
Wow.. just f'n wow.
---
For one, PvE heavily rewards playing by yourself, maybe with some alts, and avoiding all players as much as possible.

---
What about the Friendship?
---
Not all of them. Some do.
---
&gt;It's sad because the macroeconomy is unsustainable. 
---
Why is it unsustainable? Unsustainable relative to what? There isn't a codified law set into stone written by the hand of Bob that states your corporation, your alliance, or coalition should be limited to X isk or X ore. In short, because of freedom and free will, there is absolutely nothing wrong with people being successful.
---
Do I hate it that they can kill my small gang when I roam into a territory with much more powerful enemies? Yes, of course! 
---
***But the act of building communities per their human nature to defend themselves as a tribe, to beat my small gang trying to hunt them, isn't inherently wrong.*** It's actually fair -- they've spent significant amount of hours building a culture, infrastructure, communications, services, SRP programs, trainings, etc from the ground up. I have several choices, I can build a similar group or I can do guerilla warfare, do inhibs, spy, etc.
---
&gt; The game needs to be reversed in a way that adheres to these three conditions; ... ISK/minerals should be added to the game at the pace they are removed. 
---
**This statement forces a play style against someone's will.** 
---
In a sandbox, [with the butterfly effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08hmqyejCYU), game designers shouldn't force a play style.  
---
I talked to a null miner the other day, has combat experience, and he said his personal goal is 25bn of ore, and after that, 100bn worth of ore, and then 500bn. This is not someone without ISK or without ships. It's just his personal goal to reach those levels. He has a mini-game for himself so to speak. 
---
Who am I to say this play style is wrong? My own opinion, he goes to college, gets stressed about his homework and studies, and his mining activities with his buddies gives him a mental break. Why should the game force him to PVP when all he wants to do is collect ore and minerals until perpetuity? When he gets attacked he actually fights back with ease, but he doesn't enjoy it as his primary activity.
---
&gt; A high risk high reward nullsec (and jspace). 
---
This already exists.  
---
The only reason why the risk can be alleviated is because human nature forms communities. 
---
&gt; Current nullseccers still have things to do even when the majority of the current farm is cut. 
---
[Everyday routines makes life feel more meaningful](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/everyday-routines-make-life-feel-more-meaningful/) \-- that's brain science I'm linking here. 
---
If a player has found a play style and they formed a routine around it plus they've added a community layer over it where they are treated well, protected, and given a communication platform (e.g. TS3/Mumble/Discord), their game play is more meaningful. 
---
It's no longer about the economy, and the rise of ISK or ore.  It's simply, a meaningful game for them.
---
It maybe blowing up ships every weekend, or it could be, just orbiting a rock all day long.

He may have been a little juiced before that match.
---
Eve's community is the way it is because people are calling for either change or the status quo. The community is fractured. Your beliefs about how the game should be or should not be place you on either side of the line. 
---
As soon as you have some sort of opinion, you're in the ring, dude. It was your choice to speak it, so bear your cross so to say.
---
Like literally fk you. CCP Rise even said something like; I have seen good versions of what the cyno change could be but we choose this option because of age of chaos.
---
Like wtf. What is chaotic about massively restricting cynoboats. Chaos would be if they removed cynos all together. Sure, it wouldnt make sense but it would be chaotic atleast. This change is just "fk you, inject all your alts and did I mention, fk you because fk you".
---
Like do they even have 1 person in that office that says "guys, maybe this is going too far". Or did they boot everyone with opinions throughout the years.

My alliance exec in Arson Industries made the mistake of watching the old Lord's Servant dunk phoenix video.

---
Needless to say, the next week he dropped his own "dunk" phoenix.  He chose to do it against a sig tanking gang, and without anywhere near the proper fit.  So about 5 minutes into his fight, we got asked on comms to try and save it.  So we formed up a kitchen sink armor gang and proceeded to get massacred, multiple times.  Eventually, I think they ran out of ammo, and chose to warp off.  Somehow the phoenix lived, but the rescue fleet perished a few times over.

---
It was a fun experience, and still makes me laugh about how bad we welped trying to save him.  Still give him shit about it.
---
Well that's a dumb and awful change that should be reverted.
---
i always liked how stations had the various subsystems available to attack and disable. they should bring that back for citadels.
---
It would if they want to incentivise null peeps into a different form of pve, making nerfs to their current forms less debilitating.
---
&gt;Which is what entosis link first envisioned, but broken by citadels
---
Imagine an entosis game where you can force a system to be jammed or gates to be closed so it can be entosised.
---
CCP doesn't have to change citadels, but they could enhance so much more elements to entosis mini-games.
---
Ha yeah that was extra fun on comms when someone went "Ah fuuuuuuuuuu..." after getting podded and forgot to insure.
---
Goons
---
&gt;Am I crazy or could this work?
---
The first one
---
This game is all about reducing pvp opportunities now, until everyone can farm in peace. So I think it's inline with what everyone wants.
---
&gt; PvE and PvE minded players have more "legs". 
---
In the hospitality industry, like say airlines or hotel chains, these are your most loyal consumers. They are the Platinum Medallions of Delta. The Ambassador Elite of Marriott.  
---
To CCP in July and August, they are those silly null bears to kill, they wont mind dying and will adapt to enjoying it when we remove their play style.  Am I right?
---
Nice butt plug
---
It's sort of insane in the scope of Eve that you can not only put down a Keepstar, but unlimited engineering citadels in the same system, and there is no penalty at all for spamming as many as you want. It's like if you lived in New York City, but also owned a 200 acre farm that somehow also was in New York City.
---
Well it isn't making the null blocks more +1 bil isk ships safe, so its ok to cry about it.
---
The salty redditers here are a very small minority of the game. Probably over half of them don't even play the game anymore.
---
Don't take them too seriously just because they are very vocal.
---
they really should have added a beacon structure that made any player that appears on grid with it show up on local. then make them be able to be disabled pretty easily and require a player to come repair them if a small gang incapacitates it. small gang targets!!
---
Extremely vocal.
---
&gt;when I tried to do some hunting
---
We don't do that in eve anymore. Scares the null blocks.
---
&gt;I'd quit.

tbh, this place is \~\~circlejerk\~\~ resonance chamber in someways - you hear a lot of people who share the same views, or at least are active in a similar gameplay style. But there are other people on here who just don't post, and still plenty others (majority?) who don't even bother coming by.
---
Not that I disagree with some of the stuff on here, ie citadels suck ass, FAX need balance, game is stagnant, etc. But that doesn't reflect everyone's opinion, and I think CCP know that at some level, and take the \~\~salt\~\~ opinions with a grain of, well, salt.

Forums require outspoken people. If you check the markets you get a feel for what is actually happening. Many many left because of the BO alone. Not saying the cyno change didnt add to it but the BO was not harmless, by no means. I think the cyno change however just sealed the deal for many who where in between opinions.

---
&gt; ACTUAL PvP which is rewarding is putting yourself and a handful up to 20-30 of your teammates against a handful up to 20-30 other dudes in somewhat similarly classed ships, and trying to beat them. 
---
There are much better games for that kind of PvP. Ones with matchmaking and ladders that allows me to quickly find other people to PvP with in "fair" fights.
---
They already get sub money, why do they need constant praise too? They're not volunteers at CCP, they get paid to do this. Balancing this game is *their job*, and customers are well within their rights to tell them when they're being bad at it.
---
They've been fucking up this game for years. Sorry their fragile egos can't bear to hear that.
---
While I agree, let's look at it this way: I don't know of any other game that has a fan base that cares so much about a game and have been around for so long. I think some people have reached the end of enjoying the game and they've long maxed the utility they get from any additional hour spent. So nerfs come harder for them.
---
That's not to say the game needs a healthy boost. I'd like to see the community start talking ideas (cause CCP might be struggling here) rather then just throw out criticisms. We can provide constructive feedback.
---
delete reinforcement timers,entirely. instead  give us three  strontium cycles that work like panic but for only 12-18 hours  reduce all damage by 95% so you still apply damage but only 5% of ur dps for 12-18 hours per stront cycle,there would be three of them. next cycle would be 9 hours and third final 4.5 hours and  citadel explodes
---
He isn't 100% safe.  He has to get to his cloaky spot.  If he's truly afk, he's not interacting with the game at all, so he's a non-entity.  As soon as he starts playing, moves, decloaks, jumps a gate, he's unsafe.  He can be baited out. 
---
Are you also afraid of people who aren't logged in?  What if they log in suddenly?  Maybe we should never log in to avoid any risk whatsoever?  
---
You're a coward.
---
Your mom was just here with me.  She wasn't very quiet though - made lots of noise.  Mostly sounded like a pig.  Or a dog.  Hard to tell over the moaning.
---
Agree. Feedback could be more constructive and less toxic.
---
Ccp have kept their plans close to the chest since I've been playing. 
---
If I had to guess, the triglavian ships and invasions will be developed further as they work mostly on the npe and maybe some more balancing attempts that aren't so extreme.
---
You obviously have no customer service experience, so let me say it this way.
---
You get more with honey than you do with vinegar.
---
In a full PvE re-work I would agree with you.
---
&gt; You get more with honey than you do with vinegar.

maybe ccp should learn that - because look how their latest dose of vinegar played out.
---
horde runs me off their ratters all the time.

are you really admitting to being worse than horde? oof

After going through many tutorials that were informative but ultimately missed the point, I settled in James on the Internet's channel. Where a good tutorial does better than a worse tutorial is in the presenter's ability to truly put themselves in the shoes of someone who has never played before. James does it very very well, and the videos have great production  value.
---
I'm also a huge fan of quill18. He makes great let's plays in general, and his eve series (that he started very recently) follows the usual trend of him giving the answers to questions I hadn't even asked yet. He's fantastic, just try him.
---
feedback has been constructive for years, and the issues have been ignored.
---
people get sick of repeating the same, obvious, things to ccp year after year for it to fall on deaf ears.

Eve Online: "Dying since 2003"

Fax dont rep you that far out. You keep the cyno/path to it bubbled and there is no counterplay for the defenders. And guess what is happening?

Hint - Gameplay - First bullet point -  Abyssal Traces are not showing on D-Scan or when using Combat Probes
---
At what point should they just quit the game, if its so bad? I fail to see how yelling louder makes anyone listen. Its as if no one here has worked with other people before.
---
Not true at all, POS have existed for years with a reinforcement mechanic that allows for some tug of war game play and not allowing an exactly determined timer by the defender, i.e you can "kite" a tower and adjust its RF timer if you so choose.

Oh wow.

&gt;Proper IT infrastructure should not be required for Eve online.

That is some very, very, good work. Post more pics when you finish painting it. Would love to see it.
---
I do it for comments like this.
---
This. Imo the age of chaos did something CCP didnt expect, it just highlighted their inability to implement good changes. People just lost hope. Many who stayed through all the shit weve seen in the last years did it hoping one day CCP would reward them with good changes. Instead they chose to alienate that group and just go stupid.
---
If they manage to actually start making changes people have been asking for years they might regain a large portion of the players.
---
&gt;Joining a Corp isnt bad. Find one that does what you want or doesn’t care what you do. It’s nice to have people to chat with at least.

I think CCP really did hit on something with the Abyssal idea. They managed to interest a segment of solo themepark game enthusiasts who normally can't handle EVE, who were willing to subscribe in order to run Abyssals. However, the only way to retain them was to shield them from risky interactions with other players, so CCP compromised one of the core values of EVE: that the server is a single shard where all areas are accessible by everyone.
---
You must be a lonely person, dude.
---
Yes..but really this time for sure :)
---
&gt; You want them to go fuck themselves, they just might but they'll fuck you in the process Einstein.
---
They'll fuck me over by becoming unemployed so they could steal my $15 a month subscription? 
---
CCP and Eve Online isn't something I need to survive, if they go under tomorrow it's not going to be the end of my life. I'll still continue living and there'll still be thousands of other games to play.
---
I don't think you thought that logic through (or thought anything through if we're being honest) Einstein.
---
I thought abyssal traces created a system wide beacon players could warp to?
---
Basically standardizing meta levels of modules.
---
I wouldn't say it is not true 'at all', in the sense that such things were the majority of what happened. 
---
It's been pretty rare for that type of kiting or even on the opponent's side to sit a BR inside to mess with the stront amount until the last minute, Unless that POS had something very valuable in it. 
---
But, both the Kiting from the attacker, and the stront fuckery from the defenders always required dynamic choices to be made during a siege. 
---
In the current state, TZ tanking is an alliance wide point and click once venture to make all structures any entity holds, no matter how insignificant, a pain in the ass for anyone to assault. All from the comfort of their Jita alt, if they have that character set with the right permissions. 
---
POS Kiting &amp; Stront fuckery required boots on the ground interaction at the very least. 
---
With the empires and masses of structures that exist today, do you think everyone would have an alt ready to login on every structure to adjust a timer based on stront math? 
---
It required math to calculate correctly, and it had to be done under the pressure of time determined by the mass of the force shooting at the structure you are sitting near. A fuck up could tip the tide of a battle or even a full on war. 
---
These days, a timer is set when the structure is anchored, and the owner can sit and know that, 100% that if that structure is attacked, most of the people that want to attack it, will have to alarm clock for it. No matter how insignificant the structure is.
---
This is an emotional response.
---
It helps the defender how exactly? Im only seing advantage for the attacker. Like theory is one thing but reality is quite different.
---
&gt;However, the only way to retain them was to shield them from risky interactions with other players
---
Seems like this is what 80% of eve wants now tbh. I subbed all my accounts for 3 months cause of the way eve looked to be heading. Now,  If the hello kitty theme continues then i'll look for something else to play.

Horde routinely saves subcap ratters so not sure what your point is really. i mean if those pesky gankers will just bring more people next time, might as well uninstall then. afterall even if you have 1000000 supers on field theyll just bring 1000001 according to you, despite the fact that most groups roaming tend to be small and they dont just magically teleport more people.... and, you know, there only being so many people in the game. 
---
zkil shows most people in domis dyin to bombers 
---
"You're looking at it from the perspective of the ganker - "oh it's easy to stop ganks, you just have to have a defense fleet in system and ready to react to me as soon as I show up! Every time the defenders did this, my gank failed; so it's obviously an easy and effective counter."
---
Even if someone actually managed to pull that off, gankers would cry a river of tears and get CCP to nerf it somehow, just like they did to umbrellas."
---
uh maybe you cant read but made it clear im both one of most active hunters, and im a krab at the same time. while your talking hypotheticals im killing those gankers in domis and rorqs. they dont just magically spawn 30 people to kill me either. ive killed bn's more in gankers than ive lost to them because 99% of players are blobbing trash who cant pilot their own ship, including the gankers. very few groups are actually good at small gang to the point you have to really worry unless your watching netflix and too stupid to use an intel program to beep at you. 
---
what other counter should there be to getting ganked? youre making isk, they are risking isk just for kills. by the time i finish roaming with 500m or so killed avg after a few hours, the first victim has already replaced their ship but if i die once thats several hours wasted. 
---
the vast majority of these nullsec pussies will. not. pvp. They exist only to play Eve Online: Idle Adventure. thats fine, targets are awesome to have. but dont sit here and act like its soooooo impossible to just simply not be shitfit and be on coms and talkative with people around you.

If you disagree, youre literally worse than Pandemic Horde because they do this all the fucking time. HELL, EVEN FUCKING CONOCO MANAGED TO KILL SOME LOKIS

youre literally worse than a rapping russian nazi who spams help chat for recruitment scams. less than 2 month old alphas, grouping together, to kill stuff significantly more valuable than themselves so yeah some die but the phat loot coivers it. 
---
its seriously that easy, but for some reason you want to pretend the things that are regularly done by low SP pilots with a strong social bond to eachother cant ever happen. ever. because if i go gank hordes domi and they bring 2 domis, im just gonna batphone the oiver9000 titans of the Blue Donut and gate them across eve, during which time I certainlyyyyyy wont get spotted and all the people will dock BECAUSE GIANT GROUPS ARE OBVIOUS TO SEE ON INTEL CHANNELS FOR FUCKS SAKE. almost like home turf advantage has been a real thing for thousands of years for the same reason :thonking:

I don't even play in hisec, nor run abyssals, so gg bro, as you put it? I just know enough people who do to know how the whole socket disconnect thing works, aswell as understanding the relative safety of a super umbrella.

We were having dread fights on Singularity. The Moros tanked 8.3mil.

People don't care about the health of *the* game. People care about the health of *their* game. Nullsec krabs only want easier risk-averse nullsec krabbing. Wormhole blopsers only want easier risk-averse wormhole blopsing. Highsec carebears only want easier risk-averse highsec carebearing. The moment you do anything against these, even if it objectively benefits the long-term health of the game, the playerbase throws a massive fucking tantrum and stops playing.

I'm pretty sure rooting for a bot-like behavior gets your code flair pulled.

Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system.

I believe there's a word in the English dictionary for that. Oh right, it's 'coward'. Feel free to blow my shit up though, I really couldn't care less about it since wait for it...it's a game.
---
But if you want to break this down, you were upset they you can't "get gud" as the kids say. Frustrated by your inadequacy you cannot find kind words to explain the hopelessness of your situation. So faced with the fact the developers truly can tell you to stop bitching and go home you chose to validate your own frustration by believing there are other games that you feel you excel at (probably because they're single player) and that EVE is the problem because it isn't like them.

Maybe your better off sticking to what your good at, if this challenge is only going to turn you bitter.

Yeah, you're right. It's the prisoners dilemma and only CCP can change that. I'm disappointed CCP appears to have caved, but maybe they're telling the truth and they just got the data they needed and the timing is unfortunate. I hope something else is coming.

Was ratting one of the new trig sites in HS. Some random kept coming in and salvaging while we still had rats on grid. We tried to chat to him in local as we often invite random to join if they are not able to run it on their own. He was getting annoying getting the loot for free. All he had to do was say hi. Warped the primary rats target off grid and they popped him. He never came back for his wreck. Was a laugh. A little gesture in local would of saved him.

Quite right. EVE has been being nerfed for a decade and apparently only now has it crossed the threshold into being readily apparent. 
---
Could be, since computers and the internet are now pretty user-friendly and well-established, that the self-motivated hacker subculture that was prevalent in the 90s and 00s and was so drawn to EVE is not being replenished. Perhaps the idea of a blazing a path in a fiercely libertarian universe is just not exciting anymore.

why would you post this, and wait hours on hours for a reply when you could LITERALLY find it in both the top posts of the subreddit, the hot posts of the subreddit, the controversial posts of the subreddit, other explanations in like every thread, and the top result on google, DDG, and bing.
---
You know what makes a joke so much better?          
---
Being reposted thirty times in three days by twenty-five people.
---
1 ) As a developer myself,  i am interested in trends in software Industry. Is very known the problem of mad patroll in games software, they guve passion instead "payment" and death marchs often. Rememeber EA wives. Reasons for go are bad bosses, lack of interest in product, and in that matter, CCP bosses have less clue than some players here. You fire bosses for bad ideas, actions and performance. No emotional ones.  And many times an emotional developer/ artist can do strange things. Stockholme syndrome, maybe.
---
2 ) Me and others have reasons to think games debelopers have access to puppet accounts in official forums, to "deal" with unpopular matters giving support. Is strange than ISD sometimes allow puppet accounts to do and say things other guy will be thread closed. I am not saying you are a puppet account, but emotional responses pointed to EVE users and no EVE CCP people are rare.
---
3 ) Many people here are pissed for the Eve Pulse Falcon images and the Memes. And for many people here, no bonds to the REMAINING CCP staff we have now as survivor. Rise maybe, but we dont care because AT was axed. Because poor communication. We cant Do comunnication with CCP and they are not interested in hear other thing than Wallet. WE HATE  protagonism of current CCP staff, and lack of empathy and.. other things.
---
You'll notice I didn't argue with your other points because yes I do agree with you that customer service can be a harsh job and yes I do agree with you that people can be less toxic when talking directly to CCP.
---
The only point I argued with you about was claiming that CCP can fuck me over by closing down the game. They can't, this game isn't my life and if it shuts down it won't affect me past disappointment. 
---
But hey I find it hilarious that you somehow made this about "getting good" and "single player games" bravo. 
---
Want a dirty little secret? I didn't think blackout was all that bad, it could have been handled better and it could have been worked on to make it a compromise everyone profits on but it wasn't an entirely bad idea. Bet you weren't expecting that now were you, coward.
---
&gt;CCP and Eve Online isn't something I (or anyone else) needs to survive, if they go under tomorrow it's not going to be the end of my life. I'll still continue living and there'll still be thousands of other games to play.
---
Then why is this community so toxic? Wouldn't going to other games be more fun?
---
umptydumpty herpaderp. halp i´m getting owned by changing game mechanics. FC wat do?
---
That was really only instigated to stop that Slyce director spamming BRs he had nothing to do with.
---
T1 and T2 aren't the meta tiers. You find the meta level when you show info on something.
---
I've been using a dedicated alt corp for a few years as my "bank" but I'd love it if it were just a built-in feature to have wallet divisions at the player level.
---
Then form a player's union dude. If communication isn't working the next step is not bitching like a 2 year old with a diaper rash the next step is action.
---
If you already know the language they speak why are you still trying speak English?
---
Thanks for coming here and replying. r/eve can be a little... y'know.
---
FWIW - walking in stations had and still has so much potential. The potential to revolutionize EVE and afford players a level of interaction (both via other players and via NPCs) that we can't do in spaceships. 
---
Everything from bank heists, to rescuing NPC corporate execs as missions, to kidnapping that darn damsel yourself for ransom, to rescuing that darn damsel, to just taking a player-run transport from one part of the universe to another while walking inside their ship - it's all possible. And, if used properly, it should help with the NPE, too,  Sooooooooo much potential gameplay that we can't get from being in our spaceships.
---
The last line killed me . Subject to change , at short notice , according to circumstances .  We don't know what we are going to do next so please bear with us .
---
Maybe it was sponsored 23 hours ago, but it shows posted 5 days ago still.
---
This is only a one sided confrontation dude. You did great itterating your point in the first have but the latter is just filled with personal insecurities.
---
I'm glad you enjoyed blackout, you should try to phrase all your frustrations as you did in the first half of this response. That sounds like human being looking to work and communicate with another human being, the other half sounds like Conan the barbarian trying to impose his point of view. This conversation is for your benefit bud.
---
I'd argue its fine unless CCP brings back blackout to some degree (constellation local or 60 second delayed system local).
---
Wonders what will become of this subreddit if the company goes tits up 🤔
---
You can, yes. 
---
But camping in a cloaked t3 is not going to get you many kills in wormhole space, because you can’t predict when a certain hole will be farmed. And you can’t call in reinforcements if the ratters are in something tanky like triple RR domis. 
---
I’m not saying solo pvp doesn’t exist, I’m saying cloaky camping isn’t useful
---
Maybe YOU don't know how to fix it. I could fix the entire game with a 6 pack , a bag of smoke, and a 72 hour playlist.
---
I like this guy.
---
A.) You're a paranoid, delusional coward with a tinfoil hat and a 2-day Reddit account who doesn't have balls.
---
B.) This entire post is a troll.
---
C.)  You're disgruntled CCP Dev.
---
D.)  All of the Above.
---
I got elected to the CSM.
---
yea i know
---
&gt; theres meta 1-x as ***inbetween*** *t1 and t2*
---
The Skiff and Procurer are still formidable
---
And what second half are you talking about exactly? The Einstein comment? Because that came from you, just rephrased it.
---
Your logic about CCP fucking everyone over by shutting down the game is deeply deeply flawed. CCP isn't a company with a very diversified portfolio, they make one product and that's really it. They shut that down and that's the end of CCP Games. It'll hurt them far more than it will hurt their customers.
---
Would I be sad if Eve shuts down tomorrow? Sure. Would it affect my life in any real way past that? No and it shouldn't for anyone. If your life is so deeply tied into a game that you would feel more than just sadness / disappointment / nostalgia when a game shuts its doors then you need to do some thinking on what really matters.
---
&gt; This is the most ungrateful community I've ever seen.
---
Poor baby, daughter going to starve because you had a bad day at work huh? Your genes were not supposed to make it this far. You're a weak person, don't confuse yourself with viking blood
---
avoid paying to win especially while your still figuring the game out.  take your time.  everyone wants a big ship big corp and big stations.  they become bug targets and get demolished and quit.  youtube has thousands of videos and guides.  welcome to the addiction 😉

FUCK THATS A GOOD PERSPECTIVE
---
SHIT MAN I DIDNT ASK FOR THIS MUCH THOUGHT RIGHT NOW FUCK YOU
---
&gt; I really like the idea of no asset safety for low power structures.
---
Doesn't work as a solution to the "I came back after a three year attempt to win EVE, and all my stuff is gone so I'm now actually finished" issue.
---
It will be "I told you so" and "Called it!" posts all over the sub. Pick your flavor.
---
Thank u haha
---
I thought when you first posted this that you had just filtered the sig.
---
Huh, neat. Do they still use drones, or have they switched to the new fighter mechanic?
---
Alright lets imagine a scenario where you could help the miner:
---
You find a dude mining alone in a null anom. You are in a pvp ship so you can't join him to do mining with him. So you ask him to go reship into pvp ship and join your roam. He agrees to join you and then you start burning back to Jita to reship because he is blue to everyone 40 jumps around him. 1 hour 30 minutes later you have finally reshipped to duo pvp setup and have reached a region where he doesn't have any blue players. After 3 hours of roaming he dies because he has no idea how to pvp and you can't teach him on the fly because it's too complicated to explain while roaming around.
---
After that you decide that next time you will just shoot everything because it's lot less complicated and you don't have the time to go through all that hassle. After all you play Eve because you like pvp.
---
What's with the neo reference. Are you saying I'm a filthy injector noob? You'd be right, I'm just checking though.
---
what is happening? please show me. You do realize fax DOES rep 100 which is where you can light your cyno off an inhib. 
---
Unless you are going around killing titans/supers you can shove it.
---
These Bad Dragon toys are getting out of hand
---
&gt; It was your choice to speak it, so bear your cross so to say.
---
This. Dude was hardcore sperging for 2 months straight up to the point were people suspected he was either a bad goon sockpuppet or an Olmeca alt to make goons look like utter retards. Not even surprised he concern trolls his way out of this, sockpuppet or not.
---
Compared to pretty much any other iskmaking option, subcap ratting without local intel is complete garbage. If you need even a 2:1 ratio of pilots krabbing versus actively sitting in home defense ship, you're completely wasting your time making an absolutely pathetic 30-40m isk/hr per account even in something like an ishtar or dominix. If you want to use the only cheap, super low skill ratting ship left (the myrmidon) that number goes down to 25m/hr per account **at best**. You'd be making two to three times as much running HS incursions.
---
The only things worth doing in a subcap for money in nullsec now are moon mining the good stuff, running escalations, or doing explo. Anything else is just inefficient compared to the money you could be making in FW or highsec as a lower skilled player.
---
It started in highsec. Wardecs have been nerfed multiple times, until the much-praised (and apparently ineffectual) war eligibility feature came to fruition. Corporate friendly fire became a toggle. Crimewatch 2.0 made it so that you couldn't pilfer goods from a corporation's mining op without everyone in Eve getting a chance to shoot you. CONCORD response times were shortened and barges and exhumers were buffed and insurance payouts were cancelled for ganking ships and hyperdunking was made impossible and the list goes on for CCPs efforts to reduce the effects of ganking. I can remember GMs posting knee-jerk rules in the middle of a hundred-page forum thread and then actually issuing temporary bans based on those rules. Those of us who lived the life of bad guys in high sec watched CCP erode our lifestyle every chance they got for years to protect the risk-averse.
---
Nullsec has now reached the same critical mass of community pressure to drive CCP to do the same thing there.
---
It's going to end the same way most people stop playing if they never leave highsec: They'll acquire all the things to fit out their perfect &lt;insert activity here&gt; ship, and then enough to replace it. As their wallet continues to tick up and they continue to consume the same PVE content day after day in perfect safety, eventually they'll ask "what now?" Someone will suggest combat, but they've been conditioned to avoid combat. Risk and loss are bad, their high score (wallet balance) would go down. Maybe they'll try some other PVE activities. Nothing really grabs them, or they don't feel like sinking in the time to understand the new system the way they did the last one. So they play less. Eventually they just stop logging into. Often they don't even think "this will be my last time on Eve," they simply never return.
---
This game sucks at PVE. There are prettier, more interesting, more compelling games out there if you want to mine space rocks or shoot space NPCs. As a single player game with a chat window, it's not very interesting. It's the conflict that writes the stories we tell. Until CCP gets it in their head that this game lives and dies with the player versus player narrative, this trend will continue.
---
Yea, the guy was pissed
---
Thanks
---
Same as if it doesn't, a lot of pilots will pretend to be a lot more relevant in EVE than they actually were, people who don't pvp, don't fc will talk about how the 'krabs' killed eve. People will complain and act as if 15+ years is the normal lifespan of an MMO instead of an extraordinarily rare circumstance
---
That was the point of the chaos era yes.
---
Or, you know, don't do that because you can probably save your expensive pod and recover your losses faster.
---
Take a look at the meta levels of faction, deadspace, and officer mods.
---
This will be your last post then?
---
Shame it’s a PvP game...
---
That’s not exactly hard to see or catch then, now is it?
---
This ^
---
Entosis is (or was) broken however. You did not need to contest the grid to stop an attacker --- you merely need to blow up the enemy entosiser, or, even worse, ECM it. 
---
Which was why 200km sniping Tengus and suicide ECM frigates were often enough to stop a much larger fleet from doing anything. It may be thrilling for the defenders, but it was absolutely shit for attackers --- not unlike the citadel system.
---
Those mechanics favoured the defenders too much, which, along with lack of the need for more space, in part led to the stagnation. Everyone remembers how in the last war, Imperial Legacy was in a stalemate with Panfam and Co. in some sort of low intensity warfare for months... Until Panfam lost the two battles that drained their morale. Even then, Goons did not evict Panfam completely --- I suspect we wouldn't be able to. A skeleton crew would be enough to keep us fighting for months to get through all of their space, which are just renter space that we didn't actually need.
---
Let's face it. Citadel mechanics, sov mechanics, and PvE experience are broken in this game. Those are some things that we can all agree on, and if CCP wants to fix the damage they've done to themselves, they need to look at things that essentially the entire playerbase wants.
---
Responding to pings and CTAs doesnt make you a PVPer lmao
---
Walking in stations was a horrible feature that got axed. You won't need to worry about development time being wasted on that.
---
Nobody wants to go to your apartment, just like every other game. Your stuff is shit, my shit is stuff.
---
What kind of game offers that besides eve? Because I don’t know of any.
---
Looks like you've already taken Lil' Billy as an example, you're about as fucking clueless as him!
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Numg_0dxiwk
---
yea ok, i still dont get why the meta levels are such a big deal. They make no real difference since different varients dont follow a linear scale of improvment anyway so why do people want them removed so badly?
---
Eve has sound?
---
There is any chanse that The  Zorya's Light/Medium/Large Entropic Disintegrator  to drop from these?
---
As opposed to your very rational posts in this thread lol
---
Train both so you get double the suckage!
---
&gt;Upon creating your account you signed your rights over, at any point they can tell you I'm tired of hearing your bitching. We're shutting the game down and keeping your money.
---
And what a brilliant business decision that would be for CCP: shutting down their sole revenue stream because some meanies said bad words on the internet ;_;
---
It's literally the first hit on a "eve online tiericide" Google search.
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/rebalancing-eve-one-module-at-a-time
---
we were having bets on how long it would take to break(ie ccp restarting the servers again), and then how long it would take for ccp "actually fix" the problem. my guess was 25 mins, and 12 hours....... which reminds me. i think i lost 50mill on the 12 hours bet.......
---
Hold on before you start lemme grab my salt cup
---
Not anymore unfortunately.
---
There's two forms of tiericide
---
1. Ship Tiericide (which has been complete since like 2013)
---
2. Module Tiericide
---
T3 Subsystem Rebalance is an honorable mention but isn't really tiericde.
---
A little history on ship tiericide. In the way back, frigates like the Atron were utter jokes and the only t1 Gallente frigate worth flying was a Tristan (or Navitas if you were frigate mining... but lets forget about the darkest days of Eve). Each level of [Racial] Frigate unlocked a new frigate you could fly which was hands down better then the previous frigates. So there was no meaningful choice in which T1 frigate to fly; you flew the best frigate you could fly, or you fell into the noob trap of not understanding how convoluted the systems of Eve were when [this graph](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/eveonline/original/2X/9/9a395dad41a3cccfecd1346e6bc4aa48beb14442.jpg) was actually accurate.
---
Now this applied across all ship classes more or less. There were clear ships which were always the best choice.
---
Module Tiericide follows the same line of thinking. Previously we had meta 1-4 modules of all types, with meta 1 modules being hands down worse than meta 2 modules, which were hands down worse than meta 3, and so on up to meta 4. There was no reason to use a meta 1 module aside from cost and availability (and if there one thing which is always true about Eve its that cost is not a good mechanism for balance).
---
Module Tiericides goal is to rework all meta 1-4 modules and make them all meta 1 modules with interesting trade offs in their attributes. Ie a Compact shield extender that takes less power grid to fit, vs a Restrained shield extender that has a smaller sig radius penalty. Hand in hand with this change is standardizing the terminology; so you see Compact, Restrained, Enduring, and Scoped as descriptors on Meta 1 module lines that have undergone tiericide and since they have a standard meaning you can quickly tell what you'd gain by using a Restrained MWD vs an Enduring MWD (reduced capacitor penalty vs reduced capacitor usage).
---
IMO, the goal of module tiericide is noble however its not a make or break feature of Eve (as opposed to the importance of Ship Tiericide). People blow it out of proportion because Module Tiericide has been in the works/abandoned for a 5 years or whatever now but that's just Eve for you.
---
I realize that, but that means nothing. A venture takes 8 minutes to recoup...doesn't mean it's the ship everyone should use.
---
both?
---
Citadels should have inherited more POS mechanics (anchoring limitations, fewer timers, etc.) and fewer Outpost mechanics. Asset Safety is a steaming pile; I like the suggestion that a week of 'Low Power' mode goes to Unpowered mode, with the addition of standard drop rules for the dead Citadel - if you couldn't be arsed to fuel it, and couldn't be arsed to show up *for a week* after it goes Unpowered, you *should* lose the crap you left in it. 
---
Deployment should be limited to 1 Citadel or Engineering/Planet, except for Refinery structures, which cap at 1/moon.
---
Honestly, there are worse communities out there far worse than us ungrateful nerds
---
Just check the kbs. You are presenting a theory but in reality I am seeing how it doesnt work.
---
I can't believe you've done this.
---
These problems are the same problems all mmorpg games have.
---
I played world of tanks for a long time.
---
Players cried that arty was too op and unfair so they nerfed the hell out of arty 1/3 of the player base left the game never to come back.
---
Then players cried that tank destroyers were to op and unfair so they nerfed the hell out of tank destroyers and again 1/3 of the play base left the game never to come back.
---
Now we are seeing the same thing in EVE some very vocal players cry about somethings that cause changes, that cause people to leave the game causing, CCP to panic more and make more bad choices.
---
CCP should just let the players shake the balance problems out themselves after all it's supposed to be an open-ended sandbox.
---
As always with relevant input.
---
I don’t get it.
---
r/iamverysmart
---
Here's the big problem with most of your suggestions and "this is so easy": they're not easy unless you ignore all of the potential side-effects that break more than you fix and two of the mare completely unworkable, ignoring reality of human lives or how structures work.
---
&gt;decrease belt spawn rate to once every week.
---
Unworkable, people can't attend a required day of the week to be allowed access to a particular playstyle.
---
&gt; decrease minerals from moons
---
Would have to be looked at in great detail. It could easily ruin the concept of moon mining for anyone outside of nullblocs, forcing more of the already stale and problematic gameplay to occur.
---
&gt; increase combat site spawn to 30 minutes between sites. 
---
Same as above. if this means smaller groups in their own space are forced out of null, it's not a good overall fix.
---
&gt;no tether
---
Wouldn't change anything. It's also core part of the structure, not of any particular service.
---
&gt;no docking
---
Literally impossible, structures aren't anchored with fittings, services and fuel. You need to dock after anchoring to set all of those up and bring it to full power.
---
&gt;only have one timer
---
This is probably the one suggestion i can't think of any immediately obvious effect that would ruin things for everyone else - so long as it's only low power structures.
---
&gt;increase the fuel costs.
---
Increasing the fuel costs to a point it'd be notable for the null blocs could easily break the balance of their uses (industry, moon mining) for other people in null, in smaller groups. And everyone in lowsec, and everyone in highsec , and everyone in wormholes. Like most of the other suggestions that aren't actually easy but potentially workable, it'd require a lot of looking at data that's not publicly available to avoid wrecking more of the game than you fix.

I've played World of Warships where the balance was (and still is) less than ideal. Where playstyles clash hard with each other and salt is the pretext of the game. Where the devs are slow to acknowledge their mistakes and are infamous for being a bit predatory.
---
It strikes me extremely hard that /r/EVE is less amendable to dissenting ideas than /r/worldofwarships. Objectively, EVE's devs are better, and the playerbase more polite and less salty. Whereas it took this sub around 3 months to recognise blackout wasn't the solution they are looking for --- and some of them still don't recognise that --- it took only around a month for the WoWS sub to recognise an AA change basically rendered a class (carriers) from OP to unplayable. 
---
Even during the heyday of carriers' dominance, there was a multitude of opinions on where they should be and how to change them. People debated about their status, and mostly did not resort to calling names like they do here. You might get laughed at if your ideas are stupid, but no one will insult you just because you are a carrier main, unlike here, where you get insulted by being a Goon.
---
Sometimes I wonder if we had brought this mess upon ourselves, or is it simply a symptom because the more casual people have left the game. With dedication comes obsession, and with obsession, toxicity. Either way, if EVE dies one day, we have a hand in its demise.
---
playing with others is hard eh ?

Checking in with the daily low-effort screengrab of eve-offline

It's 2019, AKA the age of hurt feelings.
---
Well, you don't.... maybe? If you do, quit. If not, quit Reddit.
---
You don't have to "do the math" to know how much CCP makes. CCP made 76 million in 2016, that's higher than companies like Paradox interactive (until 2018 that is) and Create Assembly.
---
Look at what CCP had churned out in the last 10 years, and what Paradox/CA have turned out in the last 10 years.
---
Hey Im just giving a remark based on the clip, not actually having opinions on the fact that the clip is misleading. But if you help a miner that is in trouble by fighting off people attacking it I would bet you the miner is grateful and will recommend you to his group and in doing so create a new friend and perhaps a new home to live in.
---
And not every place in NS is "blue for 40 jumps". And there are ways around it, like jump clones, wh travel and so on. Plenty of options. But if you kill the miner you have exactly 1 option, to keep killing them because no one will wanna be your friend in that space.
---
Its quite simple, make friends or enemies. But you cant do both with the same people at once.
---
Loot from a keepstar would be scooped at an alliance-level.  There might even be interesting things that happen with all that loot on the field.  And just as many people just go buy a shiny at that point, so I don't get that.
---
Also, I disagree here.  The only people who would lose stuff would be people who moved assets (putting them in a citadel) after the change.  Everybody else's stuff is already there.  You also don't have to put all your stuff in a keepstar.  You can also pay attention and evacuate important things when it looks bad.
---
None of those are reasons to remove a key driver of conflict, imo.
---
Not my circus, not my codemonkeys.
---
This but unironically.
---
@ OP, if you actually want to mine, [take a look at this graph](https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/6Pf7YlVu0k8lu7u5cO0Sv7/30496947c39595d14b83bc6cd5a72670/1_regional.stats.png) and look at the mining value per region.
---
I can just imagine someone with 30 phones taped around their 1999  18" CRT while they watch local in every system around them so they can mine in peace.
---
Sometimes ZKill does that. I don't know why. I've had some of my kills look like that even though I know what weapons I used.
---
Feedback has been constructive for years, it becomes ""toxic"" when CCP completely ignores it, charges forward, and the results that everyone predicted, of course, come true.
---
See: rorqual changes, citadels, injectors, FAXes, etc
---
There is a lot of anger but also tons and *tons* of constructive feedback that is just completely ignored, even on topics that are nearly-unanimous in the overall opinion on them. For example, you'd have to try *really hard* to find someone that doesn't think citadels are too spammable, or FAXes are too powerful, or ramjags are overpowered. Even people who abuse these mechanics recognize that. It's pretty low-hanging fruit from a game balance perspective, CCP has tons of options that would be met with overwhelming praise but they're either too lazy, ignorant, or stubborn to listen. That's where the "toxicity" comes from.

NGL Girth. You are the 'Ye Olde' bro I wanted to talk this shit through for everyone to comment on. 
---
It'll be at least 8 hours from now, But I definitely want to hear what you think about EVE as it is now.
---
reminds me what was kinda embarassing at this moment but .. here's my participation :
---
One sunday, one guy of my corp was ratting in a thany, had visit of light blues doing a 10/10 but didn't want them here, despite rules allowing them. rage came in his head he started insulting them.. bad luck , a wh spawned while he was raging, his thany unspawned curiously, a wreck spawned at the same place.  
---
the guy kept raging at blues, even intelling them as if they were grey. he contacted me as I was his CEO with screenshots of light blues trolling him, I said I couldn't help , I would like to , but they were allowed to do their 10/10.  
---
the guy of course kept raging , but now at me. decided to put all his stuff and hull in his moros and go to our alliance staging for selling all and leaving, without forgetting to give me a kind advice, that is that I should.. well.. you know. he started travelling by gate his moros, 4th jump another wh spawned , the moros unspawned curiously, a wreck spawned at the same place.  
---
this guy is now known as "the raging guy".
---
I miss the target painter names.
---
Yes for sure, no one entity would get all the loot. But with the massive pinatas now available the best ISK/hr after the change would be destroying anyone else's citadels. 
---
If you are in a null system where do you keep your stuff? The nearest NPC null? Or are you saying diversify your stuff between a bunch of different stations so that you don't lose everything in on blast?
---
If I can't log in for a few days and come back and my stuff is in safety, no big deal sucks to pay ~20% to get my stuff but it is piecemeal, if someone comes back and their stuff is gone, a relatively high percent of people won't stick around.
---
Like I said, it'd be a great PCU boost for a month or two, then we'd see even lower PCU's than now.
---
Which really isnt true. Just because this fits your way doesnt mean the rest will do the same. Believe it or not, some people can remain objective. And these are the ones that CCP should listen to instead of well.. I think we all know how this went.
---
Bingo. 4 types of ship in a row I've skilled into, bought, then they were immediately nerfed hard. This last round I skilled 2 pilots into Rorquals to do some mining just to have CCP decide "Nah, you should make like 1/2 as much as you used to with a lot more risk".
---
CCP sees "Oh, there's a problem with Delve mining too much, let's do something about it", then just pulls the knee-jerk "MAKE MINING YIELD LESS AND MAKE THE SHIPS EASIER TO KILL", instead of "Hey, maybe we give benefits to people mining with less than like 5 people around them".
---
CCP doesn't want to think up good solutions...they want to just introduce new changes so it looks good to the Koreans that own their company.
---
You're few weeks late
---
Would you like to buy a highsec gate to Stain?
---
&gt; Troop out CCP Quant to talk about the numbers
---
I wouldn't be so quick to ask for that if I were you
---
Just lay off all the staff and replace them with clones of Guard
---
No, we don't want people who can't even use punctuation in EVE.
---
THIS IS GAME
---
Imagine thinking F1 approach is PVP
---
That's...true, but not immediately. Small gains or losses aren't important - what matters is lasting potential. They might introduce a change that reduces the active playerbase by 10%, but if it increases it another 25% over the next few months it's still worth it.
---
The problem is they have **no idea** what effect their changes will have...they're just throwing shit at the wall and waiting to see what it does.
---
Like the CSM? And the action being loss of subs?
---
[It's literally their financial statement.](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AA5_H-bEAF8/WQ5gFlA-urI/AAAAAAAABbA/ntmI6-tcIlkLz-mZnWePfbhGgQWUCbeJACK4B/s1600/z07.png)
---
Cringe tbh. EvE just doesn't have the kind of PvE that can be dramatized.
---
This feature was widely hated and badly thought out and is therefore good lul
---
Oh yes please more cancer structures to burn through please give us more fun and engaging upwell mechanics
---
Hey, nobody said you had to be here
---
alright so its not about removing the meta names its about fixing the meta differences , that makes alot more sense, thank you
---
Send the site where you got this from, not just the picture.
---
&gt; because 'lol who gates caps 
---
Goons. i still remember the first time i was in delve. watching titans take gates all to find out it cause "fuel costs, gating is free".........Krabbers gonna Krab lol
---
I wont name any names, but any time my friend loses a ship. Its always something ridiculous, and always for a ridiculous reason. Like losing a bowhead in HS because he forgot he had killrights out. Or recentely, forgetting to red cycle his cyno on his arazu. Or forgetting to bring fuel. Its always something!
---
&gt;Unless naming your Atron "The Last Emperor" and mixing guns on it was supposed to be comedy - then you did well
---
 [The name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRZZ5qkn2iQ) I chose for my ships are based off my favorite artists. Sorry you didn't like my writing, and, I think the PvE has a certain uniqueness, enough to write about it and have fun. I didn't write this for an edgy teen, I wrote it for myself and if you don't like it, **¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯** have a good one!
---
Invictas
---
Still proves point, I wouldn't put up with your bullshit, being paid that much.
---
Furthermore, paradox's business model sucks. And they're not the example you want to use if you're going to bitch about half finished games and bullshit non sense development decisions
---
I mean sure. This is one of the most expensive games on the market. One of the most complex games on the market. One of the most tedious games on the market. One of the...
---
But people are willing to stick with it for whatever reason. And they feel their wants and needs should be considered which isnt an unreasonable ask considering how few are actually playing. At some point players become "shareholders" and the future of the game matters to them. 
---
And your argument of players not knowing how to fix the issues is invalid. People have been screaming for certain things to change for years. Pretty much every side in this game agrees that citas are broken, that SOV needs work, that LS needs work, that HS needs work, that FW needs work and so on. So saying we havent presented constructive ideas is just BS.
---
So how about fixing these things first instead of putting what 70% of your staff to change the NPE for the what a third time in a couple of years? And leave the rest to "balance" by nerfing. Players have said what they want fixed, fix it. You dont get cookies for not doing your job, something PvPers should learn aswell.
---
Well, now Widow is the most tanky ship that can carry regular cyno. So I guess she has her niche, although I doubt anyone designed it as such.
---
Other than that, they are kind of ultimate sub-cap krabwagons. Fit it with CMs, and bam, you have kind of retarded Rattle, but with jump drive.
---
Would you like to buy some objectivity?
---
Exactly, i (in goons) sold my ratting super, as i worked out the profit i was making would take me a bloody long time to pay it back, even at 200+mill/hour, when i can make a bill a day in a 200mill ship in high sec, whats the point in ratting in a 10+bill ship for around the same isk? esp when all it would take is some bad luck to loose said 10+bill ship.
---
You hear Purdue is filing for bankruptcy so they don't have to pay out any legal settlements? Lol
---
Killing kid's ain't a bad business decision either if you can play your cards correctly.
---
Yup. I put away the carriers and haven't ratted in a Dread in probably a month and change, already. Blackout made it not really worth doing, but the cyno changes take it into the red. Ratting with a carrier/super now is cancer.
---
Honestly, some people just want to do some PvE when they have some time. I like PvP as much as the next person, but when I have like 30-40 minutes of time between getting home and having to do other things I don't want to spend that time mindlessly watching a gate that nobody will come through or trying to roam and definitely not finding anyone in that time.
---
To the people saying "If you want to PvE this isn't your game"...that's a stupid point of view. CCP wouldn't have designed *any* PvE content in the game if there weren't an intention for people to do it. It's there for a reason, and there's generally vastly more available than people can even use.
---
Ah, *now* I get it.
---
...anyone got the killmail?
---
&gt; I don’t want a job with rules on what i’m allowed to do
---
with all due respect, that's part of what the whole "empire building" mindset is about, or it should be   
---
carry on with the discussion
---
What the fuck are you even on about you absolute lunatic lmao
---
The fact that it existed for a week demonstrates how nonessential CCP consider the potential for PvP encounters with Abyssal runners. And how few even try.
---
yip.......... i used to log in, do a couple of sites, take a quick  trip round the area i lived to see if i could catch a neut (never did......they just didn't like my armour HAC's....lol) in between getting home and doing dinner/heading out again, now days i'll jump into WoT Blitz instead, 30 mins free, is enough for 4-5 solid matches.   
---
Eve is at the point where if you dont have HOURS free, you may as well not log in.
---
who the hell are you to tell me my gamestyle is invalid. also, stop assuming my preferred fleet role. im usually in a hictor or dictor btw.
---
Come join Horde! We’ve got fleets running all the time, lots of helpful players, and lots of ways to get you into doing what you want to do.
---
That looks pretty clean, how much does it cost to make something like that? Time / Money?
---
Profit, man. Business isn't always about fulfilling the customers request. I mean you think the "community" had any impact on their decision to sell a chunk of their Company? 
---
Hell that company may even decide CCP is more profitable as a lincencable Engine than an actual game.
---
If you can't give constructive criticism you might as well just shut the fuck up. You're not entitled to anything as a customer, if you want scream, yell, and shit your pants at every little change a corporation is going to survive any way they can.
---
I like Eve as a game, I don't want CCP to say "Fuck it", because they're making a game for a bunch of autistics that don't know how to express themselves and become trapped.
---
Maybe that's what they need to do. Just find a way to purge the toxic part of the community and make way for a new player base.
---
rip chewwey
---
waves hand... you don't need to see the chat system today... move along...
---
Surprise, people just said fuck this game and weren’t sitting around for local to come back..
---
and effort, and actually playing the game, 3 things CCP hates with a passion.
---
I agree with you here.  My original belief was that the blackout was covering for the system-local membership bugs, which, maybe it was, but also it was a handle they could grab easily.  They saw what happened with that (even more centralization towards durable ships with cynos to save them) and essentially banned cynos, instead... at which point, they started looking at unbanning the lack of visibility, because they found what was more likely to be a big culprit.
---
I doubt cynos are going back on capitals ... ever, and I know that the way the "can fit" lists are implemented, they are strongly incentivized to put them on only a few ship classes... but they might allow them on a few more in the near future.
---
This raises serious concerns of the reliability of their surveyed population.
---
reddit.com//r/DualUniverse in like a year maybe
---
So rational.
---
i’m still alive o/
---
Considering they are cloaky and can cyno in off a single covert cyno?  In a blackout, it is nearly impossible to see them coming.
---
I noticed the status went to "Closed". Did you decide not to implement this feature?
---
&gt;We need to know the rules and be able to trust the rules aren't going to be changed on us without warning.
---
This is the big one right here, no one is going to start a war and extend themselves during a period of the games development where the devs have said they want weekly changes that pull the carpet out from under the playerbase. That doesn't drive conflict it drives groups to turtle up and wait out the stupidity.
---
at any given time and place in wormholes there are multiple ships warping in
---
Do you listen to the CSM? Are you willing to unsub, would you be willing to get other people to unsub?
---
what have you done to build the goon empire, or are you just some dumb newbee reaping the benefits, standing on the shoulders of giants calling yourself tall?
---
The "trade off" is for hunters only. It's harder to move capitals for hunters, but it's worth it.
---
I'll take option 3. Can we have a contest for the best memes from this?
---
That was a really long post
---
:thonking:
---
Are we going to see some new lighting updates or any DX12 raytracing features in the magic of x64 bit client?
---
Part about goonswarm turning on martial law. Yeah it’s crazy. They just killed one of our own nyx’s who was farting doing his own thing. They jumped titans and team killed him because he “didn’t follow the rules” if someone fucking dies that’s on them you don’t have to teamkill to teach a lesson.
---
Well you'll be happy to know that CCP will likely be making the game a lot safer, though I expect you'll be here in a few months saying that wasn't what you wanted.
---
LOL.. I'm sad that I missed the sarcasm...Fly dangerous
---
 I dont play to many games, but CCP is by far the worst gaming company.  Its like they dont know what to do and show us that they are clules.
---
The only good of the chaos era its that they show us there is better games or things we can do with our free time than play EVE.
---
Out of curiosity, who did you choose to give your money to?
---
September is here, almost gone and no words.
---
The amount of times I’ve just made an innocent comment only to be told to “shut up goon” or “oh the goonie has something to say” just blows my mind. That people take a video game that far. 
---
Like I just joined an alliance to play in bull with cuz my friend was there. I could really care less the name. Now I enjoy playing with them but who cares what alliance people are in.
---
The problem I see is if you were prepared for a deathstar pls you could defang it and make the defenders have to repair the guns to keep it active, allowing you to engage them. with citadel's you cant do anything to defang it
---
Promising is easy, keeping the word is the hard part.
---
Well even if he apologized, what good would that do
---
If "PVP" guys were not for 90% of them not flying covert cyno or cloaky shits I would be extremely happy to see much, much more pvp even if my gameplay has always been 95% indy+pve. even nanos are a fucking problem, stay long range, warp when any fucking line adds in dscan, then trolling because "boahahaha you have 10 ships you can't catch me bohahaha". 
---
Sorry guys but when everyone talk about pvp, they think pvp can be considered as 3 simple letters, but when hunters get completely uncatchable because ultraspeed or cloak, non pvp players just have to undergo the threat and stfu. there will be a time where all kind of gameplays will have a real word , but for now , all pseudo-pvp trolls just think they own the truth because "eve is a pvp game". it's a mistake, just think about it, eve will get back to pvp when pvp itself will be attractive to more people. for now ? player base are carebears. quit flying uncatchable or cloaky ships, you'll get more target who will think you're the target, we can call that "baiting with balls" maybe , but for now, pvp ships easily kill pve ships, pvp ships are extremely hard to catch despite real efforts from many to do so, so what's the results ? carebears take disposition to not be catched, and let the hunter go .. in 99% of the cases, the hunter will run to his safety on any threat.
---
Juiced on *what*, essence of Jihadist?
---
Why would you quit a job where you do literally nothing and still get paid?
---
lmao
---
&gt; I don't know of any other game that has a fan base that cares so much about a game and have been around for so long.
---
WoW?
---
Nah citadels are great. Reinforcement mechanic is dumb.
---
&gt; At what point should they just quit the game, if its so bad?
---
the point where they get more fun using the time to do other things.
---
Theres services for websites that function as kind of a buffer for DDoS attacks, cloudflate is propably the most famous, idl why they wpuldent implement something like thst for eve.
---
Same here
---
So, just to make sure I understand what I'm looking at.
---
A guy from TEST is harassing some guys from Horde while listening in on their comms? And Horde are watching his stream, and appear to be repping him while blasting his ship apart.
---
Then they get sad that they actually blew him up.
---
Then they give him a new ship so he can fight them for the lulz.
---
Then you help him try to kill your own corp's Praxis.
---
Then you get sad after he's blown up AGAIN.
---
...You lot were sure having fun.
---
I think that's a reference, but I don't get it.
---
Incursions, the staging bullshit thing, diamond NPCs in belts which barely give enough time for a frig to warp out, NPCs mining fleet stripping belts, and recently triglavians.
---
Which one of these caused the highsec playerbase to "throw a massive fucking tantrum and stop playing"?
---
Thinking 90% of PvP is cloaky shit dropping or ganking PvE players is such a krab thing to think.
---
Hi blackout.  I'm sorry to inform you.  Your identical twin Blackout has passed away. 1 isk has will be deposited on every corvette  class  ship you'll ever own as part of his last will.  My sincerest condolences 
---
Drunk on ritalin
---
-death announcer
---
it is less safe dude by a huge margin, in high sec if someone hits you it they get one shot period. in null you have wormhole roamers, whaling fleets hac roams and have to rely on people to help you if shit goes down, not a concord. people roam to null for content, why pretend like it’s not true? and yea i’ve heard of people dc but i’ve also heard of ccp returning lost ships. the safety in null is in its people, player made and if you check zkill you’ll see how reliable players can be.
---
tl;dr
---
I unsubbed 7 accounts (2pve 5pvp) . Not likely to come back unless there is a major revision and change in CCPs design for the game going forward.
---

You need therapy. Quite literally.

Ye I dont know. Dont understand the issues.

Space OSHA updated their jump beacon safety and harmonics standards to reflect new research findings. Just like when they saved capsuleers using the new-at-the-time cloning systems from permanent jump-related psychological damage by implementing jump fatigue safety guidelines in October of YC116.
---
+1 for the Ender3. My father got himself one to get into 3D printing. Even the first prints looked really good for a machine of this price and he community is very helpful.
---
I believe the CSM to be our "union". And they dont need to tell us things cause unlike in a workers union we have the choice of just not playing the game so they work as a conduit for our concerns.
---
Well the simplified version is that they connect fast, like 5000times a second fast or faster, which CCP servers cant handle, so they break down.
---
That's neat but can you do a 2D printed one as well?
---
Do they work?
---
I understand the principle of it. I just dont understand what CCPs issues with it is. Like what stops them from preventing this. Cause I know they have protection but I dunno how the attacks are carried out. From what I gather these attacks usually chain computers to apply pressure on a service. But I dunno which types CCP are encountering atm.
---
Well no, CCP needs to listen to them for it to actually work.
---
I WISH

THAT I COULD TURN BACK TIME

Plex sale would make them more money..

Watching the part of flightleader's "Trauma" video where he alphas a rattlesnake landing on a station in what I'm pretty sure was an arty rag is one of the funniest things I've ever seen.
---
Well, usually the block services will stop them after seeing it starting. So either CCP is bad or someone found  a way around the system, id say its a 50/50
---
Bitching is an action. So is unsubs. And considering reddit seems to be where they get their ideas then its a prudent place to bitch. Also I wouldnt really consider everything to be bitching. Has been a lot of good ideas.

Oh okey so the system automatically starts to ban certain high frequency activities?
---
You have no idea what you're talking about do you ?
---
Yeah, essentially.

Why the widow in particular. All blops BS are good for is bridging. CCP added a cyno role to them, but I doubt be someone will use them as such.

I think 10-20 might be off by a few factors

Well exactly. And you cannot leave structures hanging either, too dangerous.
---
Ah, another brave explorer, that learned about Eve-Offline's existence.
---
We are surrounded by geniuses on  this sub lately.
---
Because ECM got nerfed a while back. While in most cases it's not too bad, the way it's used by the Widow (anti-fighter control) makes it useless now.
---
For the first time ever we had an issue where the local chat was broken for a few hours. The Apocalypse is near!
---
I thought the issue is that every channel is a different xmpp server and every join is a new connection which coats a ton of resources because xmpp is bad. So reducing the amount of people doing reconnects would significantly reduce server load and give the it guys a nice summer break. But ccp is silent so who knows.
---
Not sure why should you give a fuck. Nobody in their straight mind will use blops BSs to kill a dirt cheap carrier or be able to do shit to a super.
---
I remember the STO foundry.  
---
Dont get me wrong, there were some actually good, well plotted mission chains.
---
There were more grind farms, though.

I can just imagine the missions where million ISK battleships spawn essentially endlessly at optimal.

---
My group had a ton of mobile depots in top of our station ( ostingele, lowsec ). "Yuhu" corp around 2014...
---
A t2 cruiser gang came, we killed one of them in one plex.
---
Tears, salt and lots of shitpost on local... "we are going to camp your station with t3s".... you know.... tipical shittalk...
---
One of the guys started to reinforce our depots .
---
Our FC: "hey guys, suicidal catalists" :).
---
We fited on the fly around 10 catalists,  undock, warp, t2 cruiser almost insta-popped.
---
Balance lost 50m, killed 400m.
---
Still remember the laughs.....
---
I've been in brave for my entire eve 'career' so my experience is a bit different, I guess sometimes things don't always go to plan :(
---
Aha, so now we get to the root of the issue: cynos. What, it’s not cool that someone can instantly drop a pile of shit on your head with no warning while you are trying to do what you enjoy? I tried to propose alternate changes to cynos a couple months ago and mostly just got a lot of hate for it.
---
No thanks.
---
Never done that because we welcome content. If we wanted safety we'd live in nullsec.
---
Same could be said about capital rebalance (skynet carriers + rorqs which enabled it) and roamers: entire playstyle got destroyed, and those people who quit are not going to come back.
---
&gt; PVE ships can still have hefty tanks, you know that not just the hulk exists right? there are a wealth of mining barges that trade mining amount for tank, and its easily possible for some of them to tank for a minute against a solo dude, long enough for your friend to come and dunk him (because cloaky ships are sacrificing some pvp potential to fit that cloak). Instead miners expect to use maximal mining output setups in dangerous situations, thats called being dumb in any other arena, but in nullsec, its meant to be acceptable? 
---
The point you're making it "you can use other fits". That's true, but you cannot use fits that are even average for pvp.
---
Take Vale/Tribute for example, most NPCs are hitting Kin/Therm, so you kinda tank for that. Come the lone guy with his EM damage and he will just rip you up. So you do it like me, you plug the EM hole a little. But that's not going to help unless you remove even more dps to fit more tank. Then you get a ship that can survive pvp a little longer but who is still not a pvp ship (because tanking the rats doesn't just require omni tank, it doesn't work), getting horrendous efficiency in a settings where the payouts are already not that great.
---
A lot of people are mad at VNI farming. How is 10-20M/20 min depending on skill something you should be mad about ? Yes it's afk, like most pve in Eve, but it's still a low payout activity. Then you have the scale (which is nullsec bread and butter AND biggest problem) with override it as you can just launch 5 of them in space.
---
Multiboxing makes it difficult to balance, but not everyone can throw multiple accounts at Eve. Far from it.
---
&gt; Second of all, nullsec is about building empires, which cannot be done without friends, why are you expecting to be able to do risky stuff solo in dangerous space? Wouldn't it make more sense that if you have a group of 10 miners out, you have at least 1 player dedicated to protecting them? that way a solo ganker cant really do anything, and if a gang comes along its much easier to notice and you can form defence fleets, infact forcing gankers to group up inorder to kill miners is generating shit loads of content, because its not really worth it for your corps pvpers to undock for 1 loki, but 5? thats a small gang fleet fight on your doorstep. 
---
Well having a group being defended totally make sense. But mining is a group activity, not ratting. Miners that go alone in untanked ship just get killed by rats anyway. We used to have one or two supcap/on carrier/super on site for detterence and rat clearing, but that's all.
---
Solo gankers rarely kill miners outside of blackout, they mostly target excavators at most. Ratters are the target of choice of these guys.
---
Small gangs can and will ruin you if you don't defend yourselves. But 5 lokis ? It's a matter of scale, 5 loki will one volley any subcap ratter so you cannot save them, and 5 loki will do nothing against a mining operation (except lol excavators) and get rekted by the rorquals. 
---
Remember that big alliance are mammoths, it's less easy to organize yourself on a smaller scale. In our corp, we deal with our own shit so we can assume a defense fleet without issue, but that's far from being the case of every one of them in the alliance.
---
And nullsec isn't wormhole : the small gangs are bigger, and the INIT/Bomber bar/Spectre/Everyone bomber gangs are scary. You don't get 200 bombers dropped in your face often in WH are you ?
---
&gt; You are just proving my point more and more though, you are literally saying that you expect solo mining in defenseless ships to be viable in nullsec. Essentially treating nullsec as being as safe as highsec. Yes this is the way it has been for a long time because of intel networks, no it isnt good, and never was. Ever wonder why goons have 600 titans and a fort in every system? because miners had essentially 0 risk unless they were mentally handicapped or afk. 
---
I don't expect them to be viable per se. I expect the ships to have so kind of defense mechanism that don't involve being a sacrificial goat to cloaky gangs during blackout.
---
Check my posting history, I'm not again reducing safety in NS by a long shot, it just that reducing it should be offsetted by other changes, like payout change, pve change, etc, something that make it worth it to undock despite the risk. Today nullsec pve only work because it isn't overly dangerous and because it's scalable (due to reduced risk you can undock more alts and be less aware).
---
Also goon had like 3-400 titans already when WWB hit. They have like 1200 now, but they made it safe and worth the while of everyone, and despite the flaws of nullsec risk, I think we cannot say it isn't an achievement.
---
Did u even read the post bruh
---
Oh dear.
---
&gt;Why should I keep subscribed...
---
To bear witness to the messy end of this grand experiment.
---
If they didn't nerf mechanics that got abused to the point of suffocation, PL would literally rule the universe from about 2012 till now since they'd be untouchable as far as wealth and power goes (dyspro moons, then tech moons, original tracking titans, subcap targeted doomsdays used to head shot FC's and command ships in fights, the list is pretty extensive).
---
If you abuse a mechanic enough the game company changes it, and people were dropping cynos on anything and everything that moved, considering the past history of the company when it comes to things like this its pretty laughable that you're all 'oh dont nerf shit!" now.
---
The entire game quite literally brought it on themselves, the cynos were suffocating games smaller play meta, the end result was inevitable and the only shocking thing is that it took them as long as they did to modify it.
---
I think that the single shard, 'consequences matter', microcosm that is Eve motivated people to put up with that. You could always strive towards impacting the virtual world.
---
Nowadays what with equipment (isk) and skills equating directly to money it's harder to justify the time. People have given sincere advice to mow someones lawn in order to pay for plex. Like wtf??? Botting and boxing have devalued the grind IMO.

We all just won EVE!
---
On the flip side, I subbed 3 accounts for blackout, had fun for about a month, and then realized that I was pointlessly spending hours hunting caps/rorqs for basically no reason at all. Like sure you get the kill, but there's just no "objective" to be won for small gangs in that scenario.
---
Good job OP, now print entire fit.
---
well widow made the killing of carriers much safer.

also, blops in general are an over-investment based on what you're hunting. but the mobility and surprise factor are what you pay for
---
Bruh, thats insanity.
---
I know T5's are good isk, but stuff like this is why you shouldn't risk the biscuit like that.
---
I can probably do t5 electricals with a 2-3b zealot if i wanted to push it :D

The only answer to get eve back online is to remove local again :)
---
&gt; Unfortunately every time I tried to say this, I got told to go back to highsec.
---
That's what all the bots did, after all
---
I just logged off like 30 minutes ago. Did something big happen?
---
Hunting a coercer pilot in lowsec
---
Eve is kill glad I'am not the only one.
---
No, cloaks are just as bad, since unless you have every gate in a region manned, there is no seeing a group of 150+ bombers coming in at you.
---
What a surprise, turning local back on didn't bring back all those PvPers that the game needs :thonking:
---
I just lost two simultaneously
---
You just said your problem was that they’re going to cyno onto you. Which is it? Are you having issues with 150 dudes gating to you? Or are you having issues with one guy getting to you and cyno’ing 150 bombers in your face?
---
Sure, but there is the issue if figuring out if the beers rage is representative or not.
---
100 angry replies may really just be 100 people that are really angry and everyone else likes it.
---
And how do you listen to a playerbases that is split?
---
Local going away from null has been asked for as long as I've been playing the game.
---
Player count under 9k
---
Oh I agree, for sure.
---
But now it takes very little effort, which is a problem.
---
They can indiscriminately recruit people that never had to put in any of that effort.
---
all they have to do is make fighter jamming like how it was before the ECM nerf. Caps are still OP idk why they indirectly buffed them, and killed medium sized blops BS fleets for ganking supers
---
If I've learned anything from 12 years of playing EVE on-and-off, it's that my EVE binges always end when I have a strong reason to go play another game for an afternoon. I rarely come back to EVE the next day because it's just not as fun. 
---
In this case I came back because of blackout, but even with blackout still active I realized I was literally having more fun per hour while playing Classic WoW with one of my friends, and then Borderlands after that. 
---
By comparison to most other games, EVE in 2019 is just not that exciting or fun every time you log in.
---
potato exploded
---
That was a lot of words for such a tiny suggestion.

Got back in with 6 mins left and did the whole site thanks to drugs and heat. Time to dock back up
---
Praise bob for your luck!
---
Wasn't hoping you were gunna die or anything, just 15b? jesus.
---
I know but I feel like I had to with the state of r/eve suggestions without really thinking about a lot of aspects like "nerf nullsec" Sorry for the long read.
---
The thing is that rorqs are bad as a whole. With the invulnerability they are/can be the tankiest ships in the game. And its too easy to mine with them. They were a wrong decisions from the beginning and should just be the best buffers while the bulk should be mined with smaller barges. Then WE would have easier Targets for hunters while also miners dont have their losses in the billions all of a sudden. 
---
Same with citadels. Shorten the timers. Make it mir accessible.
---
Lots of people got booted. Jita local was at 550~ when I logged back on. Climbing 600+ now. Some didn't get booted some did. Others complained of a 30+ sec lag spike.
---
I mean... I just do them with a cloaked larazu 10km off (with a few scrams fit) a Mino undocked next door ready to jump and my other alts ready to go in dreads/titans/supers (depends if it's 1 Kiki or a blob of 3 frigs/dessys)  clearly it's not possible to do these sites safely w T5 sites ran no deaths to date) thank you CCP for making my PvE activities safer I don't know what I would do if I had to fight that solo hunting Hecate without at least 1 fax and 2-3 caps on standby.
---
OP is (or atleast claims to be) genuinely concerned about himlar's mental health, talks about their expreince in the military and how it gave them ptsd , then talks about signs of erratic behavior from himlar, compares one of himlars dreams to William Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar , and then tells him to seek professional help
---
Someone is pissed lol.
---
Product of me getting way too wasted one night and deciding I wanted to "try them out" as I had never done one before lol.
---
Dual Universe might be an answer?
---
Yea, I sorta miss the BS slugging games, but aside from a few tweaks that some of them definitely need, CCP would have to be very careful not to make them too strong, as you pointed out when it comes to PVE etc. 
---
Again, too strong a buff to their tank / survivability and they will become too OP in fleet warfare, especially due to their accessibility - it’s a very short train to get a decent t1 mega or such, where as HACs take a lot. So I’d be worried that the “big boys” could field insane numbers of DPS ships with very little cost risk, and easy replace-ability.
---
I’d like all BS warp speeds increased a little, because after flying any other subcap, they’re just depressingly slow in a huge universe.
---
Ah ty, sounds like a moron.
---
The issue isn't making battleships great it's cutting down on their predators. Bombers, even with having to fly through defender missiles or encountering HIC bubble-walling will be able to fuck a battleship fleet over nicely. Caps, especially HAW dreads and carriers, will fuck them up as well; Nightmares are the only battleship that somewhat counters this phenomenon. Hell, their mobility makes them specifically vulnerable to Lances/Bosons like nothing else, not even to mention booshing/stuka fleets
---
The time I was in Pandemic Horde when they lived in Querious. I was caught in a gate camp bubble and I asked if I could skate by. They asked me to explain the D.E.N.N.I.S system if I wanted to live.

Based on the size of it the material cost on its own is around £4 ($5 or 6)
---
We have &lt;3 already!
---
 I've enjoyed eve more than I ever have over the past few months, (I didnt live in null,).  Im sorry it hasnt worked out for you.
---
rest in peace, my dude.
---
What you're seeing is a bunch of people losing connection, and the ones that were ratting at the time are dying to rats.
---
Can mods start banning people that post these eve-offfline graphs constantly?
---
You did a t5 in a hel? :0

Xtrasquishy is a popular streamer. He has an alt in horde so he can listen to our comms. We love him and he feeds us a dread every week.

I've had a really good look at it, but general consensus is that it's a bit young in the Beta so far...
---
not really, he talked lot about a problem and then offered his solution. IF he had just mentioned his ship class idea, then it woudlve turned into a discussion about his idea, but this way it allows for people to disucss the problem of battleships being weak instead
---
Oh for sure. But wait till March and it’ll be a whole different situation. I bet. Little patience and it’ll be the new hype for most eve players I’d guess. That’s where me and a few are going
---
I mean how is this news to you?  We commisared 6 rorquals just last week for not following rules.  There are other entities in the game you can go join if you dont like it.  We have the safest super umbrella out of any group in the game and hell we're implementing ship replacement if someone loses a super while ratting if the umbrella cant save them.
---
And no if someone dies in a super that's not just on them.  That has knock-on effects for every member in the alliance.  Entire point of the super ratting ban was content denial for hunters.  Give our team a week to prepare for the new cyno changes develop the alliance fittings for ratting supers and don't make our region a giant hey come here for easy kills mark on the map.
---
If you think selfishly and willfully deciding to just ignore the rules only affects you then you're in the wrong alliance.
---
Back to Classic WoW for a bit then... LOL
---
Yes, they are great and they are called bombers.
---
We need a “delayed local” thread at least once a day, to show it has a lot of support and hopefully Falcon can take it to the others.
---
We have &lt;==3 already too
---
Do you want to stay beyond the first few days? Join a corp.
---
Here's a good one. In fact, the best one for new players (the other good ones which cater to new players get you caught up in the politics of the game before you know what you've gotten yourself into).

He does not have too. All he has to do is be loyal and participate in our community.

When you see a goon flair you place upon that person all the *imagined* sins of The Imperium, you vilify the line members and all we get from you is hate. 
---
Yeah, he was speaking in general terms but he is RIGHT and you cant stand it. 
---
The bots have moved to hisec for the duration of the blackout, if you think CCP actually murdered all of them you are fucking delusional.
---
edit: and i say imagined sins because that is what they are the goon is the good guy and all of you are bad's.
---
The widows tank is pretty shit maxed out it is only like 20k ehp more than a Falcon can get to and 700m more
---
server mass disconnects and they sucked. ccp will probably get some tickets today.
---
I'm so glad that most of the devs are reworking the NPE instead of actually new features while managment just disables and then enables things in the game seemingly without plan.
---
Can make the best NPE ever but when the player count falls below a critical mass nobody will bother with the game anymore. Also what good is a NPE when it spews you out into a mission and pve system that by this point is almost old enough to get a driver's license.
---
This is exactly what happens, it’s why I feel that CCP should have had a post-Blackout plan for a Local mechanic change that wouldn’t be too “drastic” either way. They could have advertised it heavily and brought the people back. What are they gonna do now, email everyone who quit and tell them “come back to the game, we’ve made no changes so you’ll still question why you’re even online”? Wasted opportunity..
---
Shattered ice fields are quite good.

The yin to my yang, how could I forget it!!?

yes.
---
W-Space works a lot like K-space. There is a whole other “universe” if you will. The big difference though is that all the connections between W-space systems are constantly changing. One system might be connected to another one day, but it’ll be connected to a different one the next day.

wow edgy comment here boys

It's stuck on the Jovian homeworld - underneath a complex fullerene shard.

Great post, my dude!

Yes.

It's the same reason people go watch sports and hate the opposing team and their fans. The them and us mentallity used to be evolutionary beneficial but now it's just a barrier. Ironally they people that don't like you are the ones who decided to sink insane amount of hours into the same game.
---
Don't you go bringing factual information into it. You'll ruin the "nobody loves me" pity party the John Galt Interstellar Fan Club is having for itself.
---
Rework mass and agility to be inline with everything else.
---
They can lead anywhere including other wormholes. Corps that live in wormholes use mapping tools like Siggy or Pathfinder to keep track of them, [looks something like this.](https://i.imgur.com/jgiV8LX.png) Bookmarks are named to match the names in the mapping tool, and holes that lead back home (wherever that is) are usually marked with a * in front of the name or something. So like *c1a &gt; c2e.
---
It could have been as simple as giving the players the choice. Make a corp module that blacks out local, then if a corp or alliance wants that they can use it.
---
Ye uber much.
---
The issue that would cause then is people who live in WH's and use battleships to roll their holes. If CCP were serious about making wormholes no longer rollable, then it could work.
---
One time I accidentally converted a guy to christianity IRL then he blocked my eve character from mailing him because he thought I was gay and sinning
---
All I did was PVP. That's how I made isk. Kill people and scoop loot for isk. Did some alliance stuff(wasn't fond of). Some competitive stuff. I preferred the small gang and medium engagements. But it seems that's not what CCP promotes. So I had a good run. No regrets
---
Pls no
---
Awesome dudes no afraid to have their balls on the line.
---
Oh tell me more about nameing bookmarks and what's the best way to name bookmarks :)
---
&gt; This thought that there shouldn't be some level of relative safety
---
Isn't this literally what hisec is for?
---
Everyone seems to want to null to be as safe or safer than hisec.. Which is fine, but then put the high value content in Hisec for those of us willing to take all the risks.
---
I see the point but equivalent of click bait
---
Coming next to EVE, instanced mission and escalation sites - everything to please the average PvP-averse subscriber who just want to rat or mine in peace without disturbance from other players, as he was in a single player game.
---
Allow for that ofcourse, it's just an adjustment. One of the CCP Devs (can't remember which one) mentioned this in one of Exos podcasts when they were chatting about the leshak and it's proliferation due to smaller mass and damage output.
---
And I'm just giving a remark where I try to point out that it is not practical for pvp player to try to help the miner.
---
A) It is extremely rare that you happen to find someone attacking a miner where you can help him by attacking the attackers. I have done that few times and I roamed around Eve nullsec for 5+ years.
---
B) Making friends around null will lower your pvp targets. You are not there to make friends you are there to shoot stuff.
---
C) Some of the best friends I've made in Eve have been those that I've shot. You prove that you are worth the friendship by killing their ships in various ultraviolent styles.
---
smashing idea, I would login daily just to check my retirement saving balance!
---
Great post.  This should be the top comment for the entire subreddit in 2019
---
Actually no, as we can use the same mechanic that we have for storing assets to structure.         
---
Maybe after injecting enough fuel all services could also go online.
---
The funniest thing I've seen on eve online is that time CCP disabled local and a bunch of people hailed it as the new golden age of pvp and then squandered an opportunity on dank procurer kills. That shit was hilarious

 If two widows are jamming you and both are successful, then you can't lock either of them due to the jams from the other widow.
---
\#Justshowerthoughts
---
It's more like snakes and ladders than just a series of deeper and deeper tunnels.
---
The biggest factors are;
---
1. capitals punch-down onto battleships very well, 
---
2. bombers punch-up onto battleships very well.
---
Caps punch-down well because of typical battleship sig+velocity is well matched to capital weapons, allowing capitals to focus-fire with great effect. 
---
The straight-forward solution is to change sig+velocity. But I think a more interesting approach is to prevent(limit) focus-firing by changing how capital weapons work. [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/d4oue3/t2\_attack\_battlecruiser\_shower\_thought/f0gl06e/?context=8&amp;depth=9](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/d4oue3/t2_attack_battlecruiser_shower_thought/f0gl06e/?context=8&amp;depth=9)
---
I will be the first to admit that this approach makes capital ships more like Stealth Bombers, which are also known to be very good against Battleships. The irony is not lost on me.
---
8. Now your turn.

This is some deep shit psychological analysis. You got a talent for it, mate.

If you are new to wormholes then you have uncovered a whole new eve universe within New Eden.
---
Wormholes can link together like a clandestine super highway, each with its own unique characteristics, gameplay mechanics and peril.
---
If you want to go further down the rabbit hole you can explore drifter wormholes too.
---
There is a lot to learn about wormholes, but thankfully a lot of helpful information out there too.
---
EveUni is a good place to start to learn.
---
Pathfinder is a good way to map out wormholes if you want to explore.
---
Have fun!
---
You still have the super at the end of it?
---
the Widow is now the most EHP for a cyno. It has a purpose. Thank you CCP /s
---
Well if you have 2 widows one can jam the fighters while the other jams the carrier, and you're golden.
---
Eve has always been that way. If you literally have 30 mins to play games Eve was never going to work for you. Sure you could log in, run a site and log back out but you're just a sub number treading water.
---
I demand 10 million SP as compensation for being most inconvenienced. If not received forthwith, as decreed by bird law, I shall take this to the highest court.
---
Goku fleets never consist of pure bombers and generally don't have cloaks
---
true. but that logging in and running a few sites when i had 30mins to spare kept my isk comming in so on the weekends when i have more time to play i could do other things like roams or gatecamping with corpies, i didn't have to worry about spending hours on end grinding. sometimes grinding 30mins a day, 3-5 days a week makes it seam less of a grind then spending 3-4 hours in one sitting just doing the same thing over and over.
---
literally undocking in a Munnin fleet in QLPX and the server crashed 5 mins before an ihub kill timer in Detorid.

Not at all, a subcap ratter can be from 2 to 6 hours, nowhere near rorq or super time.

Nullsec PvP is completely"safe" as in you form a fleet, go roam or start a fight. There's zero risk except your ship. Your home systems are completely safe, and even if by some miracle someone destroys a structure (which takes fucking weeks) all your stuff goes into asset safety.    
---
NS has gone to complete shit compared to what it was supposed to be, a lawless area where you could earn a lot but had to fight for it constantly.
---
Your post has too much insight and depth for Reddit. Upvote from me, but do not expect to get much traction from the mouth breathers.
---
A) True.
---
B) I chuckle each time someone says miners or industrials are "pvp targets". You could probably find better targets if you don't bother shooting them.
---
c) Not the way I personally play EVE, but to each their own and if it works for you, that's great.
---
I sometimes wonder if there would be less bots if there were less hunters. The bots are not really effective, their only advantage is that they do not sleep.
---
If we would have more real players in the belts and anomalies (in addition to the bots), eventually the bots could be pushed out of business, because of the real players not wanting to share their space with bots. In the end, that is probably the better way to get rid of bots.
---
Well you seems to be a part of a big block, by leaving it to a smaller entity like in wh or low even null you would probably still have fun.
---
Having rules for big toys is normal due to more the organization to save the big ass when tackled, half braindead player can't just push a «please come save me senpai» button.
---
The chaos era and announcement of change are quite poor communication but at the same time eve was way too easy , overload with kraber don't understand that pve should sustain pvp activities.
---
I lived in null for 1,5years farm in my hel, I moved to wh, yeah krabibg can't be more risky and even there there are way to limit that but it's much more enjoyable to krab with more risks and with friends
---
&gt;Will there be other wormholes that have wormholes in them leading to other W-spaces \[...\]
---
Yes. Wormhole systems have one or more "static" connections that may lead to other wormhole systems, known space systems, or both. When a "static" wormhole collapses (either from age or from too much ship mass moving through them) it reappears elsewhere in the system with a new destination (restricted to its type, e.g. C1-C6, HS, LS or NS). Wormhole systems and k-space systems can also have "wandering" wormholes which can go to either k-space or w-space.
---
&gt;or can you only go into pockets and back out again to normal space? 
---
Nah, you can go arbitrarily deep into w-space, but because of what I described above, you'll never be super-far from K-Space. A static will always be available and you'll eventually find either a static or wandering route out.
---

Perhaps also consider using a tracker if you're going to use wormholes a lot. I use [Tripwire](https://tripwire.eve-apps.com/) (which is available free) in conjunction with [Short Circuit](https://github.com/secondfry/shortcircuit) to find quick routes. In fact, I made all my initial capital in EVE by finding wormhole routes to far-flung NPC stations and selling their cheap shit in Jita. [Pathfinder](https://www.pathfinder-w.space/) is also free, then there's [siggy](https://siggy.borkedlabs.com/pages/welcome), which is nice and affordable for small groups.
---
We name holes by their class and a letter to avoid duplicates, so c5b would be the second active C5 hole on the map. If the old c5a collapses the next c5 hole would become the new c5a. So
---
c3c &gt; c1a (frig)
---
Means this wormhole takes you from c3c to c1a, which is a class 1 wormhole, and it's limited to frigates. A * in front means it leads back home, so no matter where you are in the chain you just follow the * to get home. Statics in your home hole get an s after the name, so c5s for example. hsa is highsec, lsa lowsec, nsa nullsec. 
---
But everyone has their own way of doing it I think.
---
Cyno change because being able to call a fleet of titans/super/fax on you is too powerfull
---
I was just making fun... If you answer seriously to trolls it must mean you are really caught in the subject and if that is the case then I'm sorry.
---
While true. a significant chunk of the cancer of entosis wars was(in my opinion/experience) fozzie claws and ecm frigs.  
---
With ecm being neutered. and combat ceptors now catchable. it would be BETTER. but i will agree, you are right it still kind of is broken.  
---
Tbh. the one (and possibly) only fix i see neccesary. is the ability to continue the entosis cycle even if the lock is broken (or from an entirely different ship within a cycle of time).  
---
Stop the entosis snipes and then it can become a (non capital) battle of attrition.
---
want to stop me bringing the next 50 entosis draeks/mallers? man up and drop an entosis boat of your own to stop my cycle. and whoever defends it enough to hold grid will be the eventual winner. that way even if the attacker keeps sniping cheap as chips entosis boats. atleast the guy willing to commit entosis ships can make PROGRESS. rather than being utterly cucked every 5 minutes.  
---
Maybe not the perfect system by any stretch, and we'd sure find a way to abuse it again.. however it does paper over the previous entosis sov issues.. but lets face it. no matter what we'd like entosis or sov warfare to be. citadels have utterly and totally obliterated it. that short moment of maneuver warfare changed back to "and we drop 50 titans on your fleet. bai!". the reason we went from dominion to aegis in the first damn place..  
---
well done ccp. well done.  
---
TL:DR. entosis warfare was shit cause of fozzieclaws, ecm frigs, and the defender never needing to commit a single entosis ship ever by just stopping any entosis attempts.
---
This is sad and all, my condolences but I thought that B4R and people dying announcements were banned?
---
Dude I've been thinking about this. In fleet once the FC (also leader of the alliance) started giving us shit for something we hadn't done at all, and the other guys were telling him calmly. Short story : "JUST DO X OH MY GOD YOU SHITS WHAT DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND" we were very much doing X, but that wasn't why we whelped at all. Someone else fucked up. He realized that much much later. 
---
I can't imagine this guys responsabilities and stress. Providing content for whiny line members, diplo, logistics, etc. I get why he lost his temper.
---
Then we go reship, he starts giving us shit again, accusing us, especially me, of stuff we haven't even done. By this point my blood is boiling : I'm a fucking adult, I'm not gonna be verbally abused in a game for shit Im not guilty of. So I said, it just came out, "CALM THE FUCK DOWN". We did, then we undocked and won.
---
I felt bad cause I know he's just under a lot of stress, But I don't think I was out of place. My ceo thinks I was though lol.
---
'You're just a line member waiting for us hard workers to provide you content so if I'm mad, you need to take it like a bitch". I get that but it doesn't justify abuse. 
---
Is that pretty much how you feel?
---
Make it so that they do not get absolutely murdered by smaller stuff (Assault Frigates and Cruisers) or bigger stuff (HAW and fighters).
---
Krabs and useless people heated it, pvp-ers loved it.
---
Let me guess which one are you :)
---
Wtf are you talking about? are you showing ignorance about wormhole mechanics or talking about some new exploit?
---
It doesn't take many brain cells to find the biggest group in the game and join them. Halfwits and cowards have been doing it throughout history.
---
Your leaders are smart, you're just a drone.
---
Oh that's why. My god.
---
damage application coolddown ability that increases damage application versus assault cruisers (introduce some lore bullshit about secondary smaller guns added on bs)
---
pasive coolddown on warp that gives you 3 charges of higher au that replenish slowly after depleted.
---
Increased shield or some active armor ability that gives you a boost in defences
---
Introduce ability in rats that neutralize these two functions and you,ve made the ship a bit more viable.
---
August, 2015, the Goonswarm invasion of Providence is in full swing. My alliance is desperately trying to defend our pocket of space against the two alliances attacking us, but we just don't have the man power. The order goes out to break up the fleet and do what we could individually to make the enemies lives as annoying as possible. Shenanigans ensued.
---
* Gangs of frigates spent hours repeatedly jamming enemy toasters, to the point of local rage.
---
* Our bomber wing annihilated an enemy fleet
---
* We got chased all over our space, going from POS to POS. While they were busy keeping us inside POS shields our hit and run crews would take out there toasters.
---
* A single guy in a smartbomb fit moa warped to our jump bridge, which had the entire enemy fleet on it, pops the entire fleet's drone swarm, and safely makes it back to station.
---
* They hit our JB every day, so we repaired it every day. The rage from them having to spend an hour grinding it at the start of every fleet was great.
---
Generally the chaos, weird tactics, and fun mood on comms made the whole invasion hilarious.
---
This comment scares me
---
They don’t use either - they use a ‘beam weapon’ despite being a Thanatos hull... I think it was simpler coding I guess for an NPC not to have fighters.
---
Hey fam check this out. That guy is at the end. I fucking laughed so much. I still laugh in public like an idiot when I think about it
---
I suppose it's this kind of thing that makes Eve a niche game. It's never going to be huge without changes that make it worse for people who enjoyed it to begin with.
---
This is the correct answer. Pvp offers really low returns.
---
Pve just want to maximise isk/hour or isk/effort. 
---
If Pvp was the most profitable thing in eve, a whole lot of called Pvp players would quit. Watch as the spreadsheet making ultra meta game hard cores start farming entire corps for money. It would be so relentless eve would die in a couple of weeks.
---
&gt;The people that liked it stayed the people that did not left
---
Thing is people were not done leaving the number leaving seems to actually have been accelerating, at what point would you have said ok too many have gone now, because the trend down showed no sign of slowing.
---
Hmmm. Doesn't look like that guy had a valid mining permit. You don't need to go deep into space to see this. By the time you see the "pirates" that guy is dead. The right answer is to warp in their and grab all of the loot. Don't be a slave to the man...
---
What ship do you need to solo those?
---
Give all BS 300% more base shield/armor/hull
---
Maybe more?
---
Maybe make it a module that makes BS immune to Micro jump fields and unable to fit the jump module.
---
Not NPC related but still a favorite
---
So there we all were in audio when one of our friends pops in. He's being bumped in Niarja in his freighter. So we ask him what he's carrying that has their attention. Sins. Literally a freighter full of Sins. Instead of splitting it up he went for the full prize pinata. We realize that this is now a race because if he wasn't our friend we would have ganked this loot pinata so we know for certain that there's a fleet en route to take him out.  
---
As we put our game face on and race out there some of our forward intel confirms the Talos fleet moving from uedama. Our friend is panicking everyone's getting tense but we had a plan. We warp into the system and sure enough, were watching our friend get rammed over and over. So we start a convo with the rammer. As were distracting him we are landing transport after transport on the freighter.   
---
Its been a few years so I'm sure im paraphrasing.
---
"You know its not worth ganking this freighter"
---
"Are you kidding me there are billions in there he's gonna pop"
---
"is there?"
---
Everything just kind of pauses.
---
Everyone watches as the enemy gank fleet lands. 
---
Everyone watches as the scan ship rescans the freighter.
---
"motherfuckers"
---
Convo closes
---
Enemy fleet warps out, they let the freighter go.
---
As we'd been distracting the enemy we had been transferring as fast as possible Sin after Sin into our deep space transports and getting them off-field out of the freighter. Cockblocking a 20 billion Isk kill mail and making a memory we all cherish.
---
Playing wow classic ofc :D na actually was I sleeping and I could care less
---
Down vote me, but why do people who haven’t played the game in years. Constantly come on here giving CCP ideas on how to nerf anything that remotely generates Isk, some people like PVE not PVP all the time. What are you going to do if all PVE is nerfed?
---
Ahh this classic mems
---
Would more ore, and less isk in the game, not result in cheaper T1 ships? 
---
How is that a bad thing?
---
why not just back to wow until CCP gets their shit together?
---
we only need that one?  [https://www.emojidex.com/emoji/salt](https://www.emojidex.com/emoji/salt)
---
Yes rorqual changes sped it up, but supercap proliferation was heading this way regardless because with local up in nullsec there is basically no way to stop people mining, its 100% risk proof if you are paying any attention whatsoever.
---
Tons of pve ships can tank reasonable amounts of pvp damage and still clear sites, but noone is tanking omni tank, because they want the minimal tank to tank the rats so they can optimise dps for money. its the same thing as flying an untanked hulk and complaining you die to suicide gankers. how about instead of clearing anoms in a shitfit VNI (or domi now) that dies to the 1st hunter that shows up, you actually have a decently fit rattlesnake (or a cap) that can handle pvpers showing up long enough for defence to land, not just a full rat tanked, falls over to anything that isnt x damage type shitfit. And yeah why don't you actually have defence for ratters? you said it yourself miners have managed it, but ratters just can't be assed. (my personal opinion is because 90% of anom ratters either AFK heavily or bot)
---
and yes to a 100man spectre fleet bomber gang, ratters should die, and then they should report there is a fuckoff fleet and the rest of the ratters in the area should dock up til it moves on. woopty do you died to a 100man cloaky gang, this happens what once per week at most?
---
Pretty much........have a ton of isk that wasnt being used on shit so when i get drunk i tend to blow it
---
It's very difficult to make PvP the best iskmaking activity because of player collusion. Even in games like PS2/Dota2/etc... win trading for stat padding is very common... and in many of these games stats don't really actually do much to make you more competitive. Can you imagine if similar systems were created in EVE with ISK, which can be directly used for huge gameplay advantages? 
---
The abuse of any PvP based system that allows creation of ISK would be insane.
---
Upvoted for level 5 missions, stayed for the story, it was good.
---
Exactly this.
---
I wish EVE implemented a "epic" system of some sort that highly encouraged fleets of similar size to engage each-other. Basically a system that might give a much higher insurance payout or something similar if two fleets of equal size were fighting eachother... maybe the fight is made into entertainment for the high-sec NPC empires and explained that way, why the player fleets are paid for it?? IDK. :)
---
 If left directly to players, as you said, no fleet will ever choose to engage even or out-numbered, which directly leads to stagnation and no fights, especially considering how much you can lose in this game due to your ship blowing up.
---
Yea make content, like using more autopilot or use covetors and hulks and not procurers and orcas. Stop using bots. And stop flying god damned garmurs and worms and fly rifters and atrons. And everyone, unlearn logistics and t3, and use some good old t1 cruisers. All those fucking munnins. When I was young, we used drakes.
---
I was thinking more like, a krab refuses to undock because of the remote notion that a cloaky camper may be in her/his krabbing system. But there is no way to know for sure.
---
This
---
" I'm pretty certain CCP even mentioned it was temporary (fact check?). " They said it was an indefinite change leaving open the option to end it if they felt that needed to. I guess a 30% player base loss was enough for them to feel ending it was a good idea.
---
Nothing in this game should have a 7 day timer
---
the sound of Sub losses is all CCP ever hears.
---
Maybe the biggest issue with blackout was the fact sov null is absolute garbage for active PVE (moon mining excluded I quess) when compared to safer options like WH krabbing.
---
So when CCP heavily nerfed the PVE safety in sovnull they should have really heavily upped the reward at the same time too.
---
Nullsec is supposed to be the end game, highsec is supposed to be for retards who just want to mine inefficiently and dick around. GSF’s recent “strictness” is literally just telling people not to be grossly incompetent and retarded, how is this a bad thing?
---
Well i can understand if most of your don't play often that you are in high sec.
---
You don't have to join big corp to have fun, most wh ones are that big but with no asset safety that not ideal for the rest of your player,you can still daytrip in wh for pvp or pve fleet.
---
Fw can be a solution to give you a goal.
---
Public fleet like spectre fleet or bjorn bee and so on can give you some experience too
---
I don't know about any of that. I fly an orca fleet when we go mining but everyone yells at us for not having lvl 5 reporssesing  so we don't know what do to with it. I just started learning logistics. Not sure what the rest means.
---
because ~certain alliances~ haven’t created a million threads about it
---
You are so fucking cringe that poem literally gives me cancer everytime I see it
---
It's been implemented! There's just a few more things I want to add before I release a new version.
---
You can preview the new things (including the total skillqueue length and sorting) on https://dev.spaceships.app
---
The 12t is not even close to the amount of blue loot generated. Your narative induced boner for wormholes makes you forget overseer effects (minor detail).
---
Thank you
---
Cool but when we show up for.them everyone laughs at our fit/skills. And we are just told to get skills that will take another year and fits that will take longer then that to afford. Got some skill injectors and isk you can give us? Very few are willing to helping is get the basics. I've been laughed out if more public fleets then i care to admit.
---
On the other hand there are people who like this game because of non-consensual pvp aspect. I personally like the feeling I get when winning the fight and killing a ship. Many PvE players for example make it out as if when ganking someone you get content right as you jump into system, from their perspective it might be true that they just now undocked to farm and are already dead, but the hunter has been sitting there for maybe hours.
---
Now ganking targets that cant properly defend themselves is nothing to brag about, but there is still enjoyment in that. call me that kid who didn't let others borrow their ball to play, but I enjoy taking their toys away from ratters. It's FUN for ME personally and you going on shitting on my playstyle is not really great. Blackout was a half-assed change and I agree that CCP should have done more, but a single change that buffed my playstyle resulted in upset players simply dropping a game because they couldn't do their dailies anymore
---
PL's kills of supers and other caps with massed blops would put the lie to your claim.
---
Yeah. We had people that could attend the first fleet but not the second and felt kind of cheated. Not great when you want to encourage shooting structures
---
Last time I checked they flew mass stukas. Like all the time...
---
I think Hilmar will remove asset safety but that's just me trying to read between the lines of the tweets and interviews.
---
You dont need to spin whole game around ISK.
---
They could but obviously they wont do to NPE make more ingame content to lose ships.
---
 I would start with:
---
1. Ingame Top PVP List
---
2. Unique items or tag's tradeable for boosters with exp date.
---
3. Put more dynamic spawns into normal nullsec anomalies so you will put more effort to farm.
---
4. Make citadel consume more fuel
---
5. Redesign subcap warp-align times.
---
6. Capacitor/Shield Changes ? When? They told us they will remake it.
---
7. Remove free loot, make it salvage only.
---
8. Most important DROP NPE, make tools to help NEWBEAN Corporation so we can teach people.
---
Didn't they change the backend of the chat some time ago?  What if blackout was just a bug turned into a feature?
---
Stop being poor
---
Lore driven game design is fucking awful. Eve players maek their own lore anyway who gives a shit about IG lore.
---
Quich guide how to punish EVE bears for not supporting the the blackout effort:
---
Remove anomalies and the blueloot from the game.
---
Salt must flow
---
&gt; Not sure what the rest means.
---
nothing
---
If it's so easy to get ISK via blue loot, why don't you try it and show how easy it is?
---
Wrong. I'm pretty sure if you get succesfully jammed by two ECM Ships you can lock up both.
---
&gt; CCP is by far the worst gaming Company
---
Okay this is your opinion and I respect that. But I don't agree.
---
Have you EVER played another game in your entire life? 
---
If yes, you are blind, if no, you should do and come back in a few weeks and tell me again how CCP is the worst gaming company ever.
---
ironically this was exactly what i did.
---
How to be a newbie (my edition):
---
Before i even started playing i read alot about EVE mechanics, so i was familiar with most dangers i will face in low / nullsec. (scan resolution / sabre / mobile campers)
---
From the beginning i decided that i will stay in empire space for 2-3 weeks maximum.
---
After that i picked closest low-sec to Rens (i created minmatar character) and moved there. By accident that low-sec was Ammamake... i lived there for about a month, doing 1-2 lvl missions, lost some Rifters, got first frag, etc. And after that moved to the closest nullsec avaliable - Curse, and settled in Utopia system.
---
As 2 month old newbie i was perfectly comfortable in null-sec (by mechanics knowledge and good practical survival guide in Ammamake).
---
After that i was almost instantly noticed by some russian nullsec corporations and joined them.
---
Then 6 month old character was teaching 1-2+ year newbies how to live in null-sec and some advanced features.
---
Really? That's quite sad, I follow more bjorn bee but I know there are newbro fit usually, t1 module will work too.
---
For solo fit when I don' know how to start I go to zkillboard, go the oage of the guys that does a lot kill with it and look at his fit.
---
For fleet it's more linked to what you want to do, where and with how many people.
---
Super\\Titan retting and C5\\6 aren't "anything" and not "all PVE" 
---
I would add Incursions to that list tbh.
---
once again, the goal of blackout isn't there to nerf pvers or nerf the production of players, it's a side effect
---
We go to zkill as well. But yes it can be really rough. It's weird you get to this point in Eve where your SP and time in game is above a newbie and suddenly you should know everything. I've experienced it with some more popular fleets like bombers to fleets o love flying with but can still be harsh like TDF
---
Ore yes. This is why you get titan hull for 36b.
---
i could lose 20,000 fit feroxes, and still not feel a dent in my wallet
---
If you do not want to split the corp, you can just join a high sec alliance in your corp.
---
Look at the other players corps and alliances next time you are mining. Check each one out and look at there requirements to join as a corp. 
---
P.s get over that sp shaming. There will always be player 20mill sp over you because the game is 16 years old, your corp mates are just as fun  with 6 mill as they are will 60.
---
And shooting jump bridges is the most mind numbing thing under the sun. They take way to long to ref, even at dmg cap with a full fleet, while on a citadel grid. The time they take to ref should be hugely reduced.
---
Do you know of any that would we could run with to help.us get out of high sec into 'the real eve'?
---
But they said in the stream that faucets were under control to the point that CCP could start to think about buffing them.
---
Yes, it was totally incoherent because the next sentence was about cancelling blackout.
---
lol, just roll the hole and you drown in ISK, I didn’t even bother rolling and just krabbed my ass off moving from C5 to C5, you make a Naglfar back in no time
---
Faction/T2 Battleships, T3C or Orca for easy mode.
---
T1 Battleships &amp; Battlecruisers can solo but may/will need warp-outs. A strong Gila can do it but it's long and hard and you need to mind your drones.
---
Get the armor repper effects stat!
---
No i don't miss a minor detail.        
---
Fact is that around ~5 to 7% of New Eden population living in WH space and generating over 12T in blue loot.  
---
Lets use 6% as average population in WH space.            
---
If i divide 12T by this 6% it is telling me that each 1% in wormhole population is generating around 2T.      
---
So "every thing is fine" can be only said if 94 % of rest of New Eden generate expected amount of isk and that is 2*94 ... so 188T 
---
But we are talking about 20-30T generated by this 94%, so please tell me **where this 12T it is fine**?             
---
&gt;But in K space people mine.              
---
Yes, you can do the same in WH space.                      
---
&gt;But in K space people mine moon goo                    
---
Yes ... but in WH space people 'mine' minerals for T3 production.           
---
Like you see the change is only for C5 and C6 where the most krabs live and you can get the most materials for T3 production.
---
It just occurred to me that, rather than rely on CCP manual intervention, the PetroISK exchange rate provided by the PetroBank could be wired to some inflation metric.  Inflation going up?  The PetroBank (for example) starts charging 1.1 ISK per barrel of Petro, then 1.2 ISK per barrel of Petro, etc.  This could happen automatically (or if you prefer, auto-magically).
---
What the fuck?
---
This game typical player slightly above middle age overweight deep voice redneck sounding airsoft military goon that think they are good at the game because they involve themselves with the politics of the game and command a zerg. Real players who go out and solo like the kids of Genos Occidere or small scale pvp are too rare and that's why the game is shit. Man I miss the days of running around with 3 bois in dramiels taking out 1-3bill ratting tengu trash every 30mins
---
Wh chain can be very long use tripwire/pathfinder to keep track of your path , you can have wh that connect 2 k space, or one k spac and 1 wh system or 2 wh system and that can repeat for a long time, more in high class because they haven't k space connection
---
We wish. It was a technical marvel how the 2 games interacted and the concept was great, too bad it was on ps3...
---
Imagine a universe where war meant something more significant and you had to control both space and land.
---

---
The first day br
---
So you quit in 2004? While I haven't actually played all that long, morale has always been what wins wars unless a much larger guy attacks someone small.
---
TDF and many fleets like that are complete autistic retards. I have a decade old account (on and off) with almost  100M SP and I'm still not even close to getting to some of their bullshit suicide magnet fits.
---
Don't worry about it mate, just do what you do. I run a pretty similar corp (though with a few more skilled peeps) and it is fun to do our own thing and build our system in WH.
---
I don't say you are wrong, i only say that unless we fix ISK and materials pouring into the game we will never have healthy economy.    
---
CCP tried blackout it fire back.        
---
I don't think CCP will try something extreme any time soon.      
---
TBH i expect cyno changes to be reversed if the numbers don't start to grow and grow fast enough.            
---
We need those things and we need them for years.
---
I already voted with my wallet on all accounts. Doesen't look like the game has changed for the better in the past 7-8 months tho and even more people left since then according to the stats...
---
I mean, at that point the relevant groups put a huge premium on capital pilots on mains and alts. If you had a super you'd naturally gravitate towards NC. or PL if you weren't already in goons or drf.
---
Although i agreed with your points on blackout on other threads, in this case cyno changes are going in the right direction. I mean cmon, having 824342342 titans/supers/carriers/faxes/haw dreads dropped on any roaming gang tackling an epithal was complete bullshit and you know it. Cynoes with limited EHP pool are better and offer way more counterplay to the attackers, making the engagement much more dynamic than "wait until the bullshit god mode panic rorqual light cyno and bail" type.   
---
It sure has some downsides, but overall there's no need to be Einstein to see the cyno changes were really needed.
---
[I was admiring my petition](https://www.change.org/p/pearl-abyss-fire-hilmar-veigar-p%C3%A9tursson-aka-ccp-hilmar-without-any-golden-parachutes)
---
so we are playing a artifact game right?
---
I did the calculation for someone else.      
---
Just to summarize it.        
---
If an average 6% of New Eden population can do over 12T then each 1% in WH space can generate 2T.         
---
So 2T * 94 give us 188T - this is how much ISK could be generated if people made as much in rest of New Eden if we use WH income.         
---
We got like 30T?         
---
I know that Higsec cannot be compared to WH space or Null but 188 T (real 30T) vs 12T cannot be dismissed.
---
There's been a change of plans, vanguard.
---
huh.. so the main definition of pvp has been "pvper vs a krab"?
---
Give them an lower signature, and then give battleships an inherent massive signature bonus to MWD sig bloom.
---
Then if they are using the MWD to putt putt around they can be bombed to smitherines, but if they are slowboating or using ABs they are tough to kill with bombers.
---
Just a thought, I don't have much experience with either.
---
Ccp dopamine said wed get them at the end of last week &gt;.&lt;
---
Too much old content is not worth doin its time to put all dev time to new missions and more dynamic game. 
---
The problem with ISK is, that with 15 years and bots some people got too much and only way to remove it is simple delete.
---
I would call State of EVE as terrible right now and going down. They need to turn ship 180 degree and start refreshing old game play.
---
CCP Rise said Trivalgian ships are op, they knew but they do shit about just like rorqs. Problem will grow so much, when nerf bat will come some big chunck of pvpers will leave.
---
I love this poddcasts keep it up !!
---
Single mining rorqual is not an issue.         
---
100mil/h is quite fine in the biggest industrial ship we have.         
---
Problem is that multiboxing limitation on rorquals is in "how much clients your PC can run".                
---
Same for supers and titans - i don't say that those ships should not be used for ratting i only say that they are way to effective in it - mostly due to **external** things.           
---
People smartbombed anomalies for years due to all spawns appearing in the same spot for years. Simple spreading out removes the boson ratting same for bombing the spawns and this letting you to get insane ticks.          
---
Subcaps are the thing, with the blackout gone subcap ratting is again possible.       
---
We cannot dismiss the fact that some changes have to be done.
---
I would say exploration (data/relic) depending of you skill/isk/knowledge you can do it in high sec, at start to get used to it then do it in low/null sec even wh space ( don't go higher than classe 3) with a tracker like tripwire/pathfinder. But don't forget to use dscan with a filter that show ships and probe in case someone hunt you, a cloak will be your friend.
---
 You can find a lot of info on the eveuniversity wiki.
---
For fit astero is great but quite expensive if you can't fly t2 frigate.
---
To not only do exploration, you can do combat site in a praxis (can pm you a fit) in c3 but not sure if can't already tank all the normal site.
---
You can farm some escalation buy doing combat site with a worm or gila in high sec.
---
Running L4 is another option.
---
Engage yourself in a militia to do FW but it will affect by quite a lot your gameplay
---
&gt; What have you got to lose?
---
common sense
---
What a retarded answer, maybe he doesn't want to join a corp yet
---
Old content is not worth due to "power creep" 
---
For me new content should be nerfed or it will become new (next) issue soon.
---
Since she left the game really started bleeding players...... 1y ago we hit 30k players on a weekday
---
It's totally possible to make decent isk solo, still remember making isk is not all ;)
---
Try a bit of everything, go in public fleet and when you know what you like you can search a corp accordingly
---
Work
---
&gt;Give them an lower signature, and then give battleships an inherent massive signature bonus to MWD sig bloom.
---
I mean then you have issues with mobility for most BS comps. Unless you strip the Nightmare of its AB bonus, then all BS are going to be outstripped by it for raw speed. And for modern sov warfare, the answer is not slow, blundering ships, its fast and mobile ones which is why AF, Jackdaw, and HAC comps are the preferred options.
---
The issue with BS is that they are ill-designed for a diffuse sovwar in most places, and even laying siege to structures you may as well bring HACs with a capfleet to go clear them out.
---
IMHO, HAW weapons need to be reworked considerably for dreads as I think they are still too powerful in many cases; perhaps cutting the range by a third would be a good start. Carriers as a counter to BS fleets I am fine with, but Supercarriers need to have their ability to launch light squadrons of fighter removed and pivoted back entirely to heavy fighters
---
A significant number, myself included, already did. And it was during blackout, when the meta shifted to cloaky ganks there was noone left to have proper fights with because all focus shifted to that. I do think Blackout was a good idea fundamentally, but about 15 years too late, the playerbase was already dwindling and 3 years of incredibly safe isk printing basically forced everyone who didn't see the writing on the wall into the farmville turbokrab lifestyle.
---
Doesn't matter as he has a lot of disconnection
---
Nothing that I suggested would decrease their speed at all.
---
Lower initial sig, with a higher bloom when using MWD that makes them vulnerable to bombers.
---
I'd say it's less Eve and more /r/eve. Vast majority of Eve players don't complain, it's just that the ones who do complain come here or to the eve forums.
---
Those new ones, if we remember where we put them.
---
actual players that got hurt by hamfisted changes, good idea, terrible execution.
---
Directly it isnt an adjustment to speed, but it is a nerf to MWDs which are key to mobility for modern sov warfare especially for battleship fleets. It also is a huuuuge buff to Nightmares as they get near MWD level speeds wothout that sig bloom
---
scanning static
---
Sounds good, would be nice, won't happen.
---
Wrong
---
reddit was fucking with me, not taking in the comments. The dude is still an idiot tho, unfortunately, if he can't tell the difference between a 1-2 week long timers and a 1-2 days long timer.
---
So you want your cake and eat it too?
---
Nah still players.
---
Just with everyone ratting and immediately docking ip thanks to ingame sirens alerting to you an enemy at any entrance to your system and friendly space usually being multiple systems wide allowing for them to be spotted at any time means players are just docking up.
---
There really isn't pvp in this version of eve unless someones bot is broken or they are afk ratting.
---
Not exactly engaging content.
---
Thats what you use when risk averse and poor, or in a blob ....
---
What are you actually asking for? If you want to help some hypothetical miner then do it. If you've never made friends with someone while you've been out roaming on your own then that's on you. If you're simply saying you want great stories like that, go make one, lots of people do every day. If you're saying it would be nice if there were more "boarder patrols" made up of a kitchen sinky gangs that included a single dread for no good reason, well...yeah me too.
---
There are a few reasons why battleships aren't used in the current meta.
---
1. Carriers haw dreads supers and haw titans rip BS apart too fast.
---
2. Fozzie sov.
---
3. Bombers.
---
Caps and supers are really oppressive to subs and in particular battleships. Bombers will also tear BS apart in either straight up bombing setup or in the stuka setup. And if you're attacking or defending a sov timer you need to be fast to run around the constellation to respond to your toasters getting hit or blapping hostile toasters.
---
Id like to go back to good ole battleship slug fests but the meta wont allow that for awhile if ever again.
---
n+1 balance approach .... as always
---
yea i originally got the idea from Vulkpeck. 
---
and I dont want to run the c13 with them since u make way more solo XD
---
but i do hope to get a chance to fleet with them for a c5 hole someday perhaps.
---
Well in 2 days ive made about 400mil so thats paid for my confessor already several times. its just once u die getting back into hole is so tedious and annoying to deal with...
---
The deeper you go the more safety you get.
---
You have discovered the wonder of WH space. Soon you will travel so deep Into then that you will eventually find how to untrigger Stainguy
---
For the record like four Logi can tank any medium or large structure. You don't need a huge fleet
---
Nothing happened, like ever.
---
It was abandoned
---
&gt; Soon as we mass undocked, server crashed.
---
Be more gentle to the servers, undock ship per ship ;-P
---
No
---
It needs to be dynamic thing, like it adapts to some variables without CCP manual control.
---
Rats - Reward more RNG.
---
easily fixed by adding some T2 components
---

TBF, the pure "number of people (irl)" quitting &amp; resubbing should not be so far apart, its just that people quitting were multibox farms in many cases, and people resubbing were the casual pvpv players with 1-4 accounts that never adapted to multibox-farms&amp;fields.
---
The current main problem isn't people abusing broken mechanics.
---
It's the people who think that the mechanics being abused are normal and should remain.
---
Quick, how many thoraxes to tank a widow?
---
&gt; Losing a huge chunk of players who you will not get back
---
So exactly what they did between 2016 and 2018 with farms and fields, where they lost 50% of the player base that won't come back
---
Nooooo
---
Why
---
Everybody is the good guy and their enemy are the bads.
---
Why spend double the price on a marginal benefit.
---
Imho fleet fights themselves have shifted a bit. If we use the same legacy vs winter example, you also have to look at fleet size. Legacy very often pulls full subcap fleets (or close to it) if its a bigger op... Legacy in the past used mael alpha fleet, but do you really need BS size arty alpha fleet when you have 250 dudes? With 250 dudes muninns easily can melt stuff before reps or often ADC catches... You can use machs, they are way faster than T1 battleships, but than again - expensive ships, harder to pull 200-250 fleets and really don't need that much alpha either...
---
Sad if true
---
Not only did they make zero progress, they also managed to put players off subscribing for longer periods of time. Every playstyle can end up on the chopping block next. And instead of working on new incentives for players to leave their comfort zone they are rebuilding the NPE so that new players have a better time. I'm sure a great tutorial will keep the players playing an aging game after they finished it and are confronted with the reality of the game.
---
Can’t you see that is a newbro Energy Neut Abaddon due to lack of skills for the Bhaalgorn? 😧
---
the whole blacklisting for joining group A isn't happening anymore like it been years ago that somebody did that. 
---
The only thing I would say is megacorps are great to learn the game basics but you likely wanna leave them after a couple of months ( unless your the type of player that enjoys being an NPC in somebody else his game ), like your not gonna have any real way to influence direction in a megacorp and more likely than not never will, but they're a good stepping stone if you don't know basic mechanics. 
---
my second thing and this is likely more personal don't give a fuck about how much isk you have it's easy to generate and really this is a video game go for having fun over having isk 100% of the time.
---
&gt; I chuckle each time someone says miners or industrials are "pvp targets". You could probably find better targets if you don't bother shooting them.
---
Usually you have to shoot the miners to cause a reaction that makes it pvp at last (they undock defense fleet, happened a lot more often before citadels)
---
That's not that far off of dock up your faction titans coming through on comms. Because losing them also hurts morale.
---
For T1 hulls only, so actual battleships of the line that are semi-disposable. I know Nightmares have other advantages. Maybe consider the other Navy/Pirate BSes for this as well, although Wormhole is a Strange and Crazy Land.
---
Increase shield/armor/hull by 50%. Drop their max turret mounts to 6. 
---
Introduce a Dumb New Module by Rando-Redditor that goes in a high-slot, and loads scripts. This thing has a minute cycle time. 
---
"Flak" which bumps your scan res up considerably, tanks your alpha but increases your RoF to something like a Small Gun+ If you try and flak down a cruiser, you should get laughed at. On the other hand, you can start fragging AFs and Bombers. You could also semi-reliably engage fighters and the like. 
---
"[Insert Name Here]" keeps your scan res, jacks your alpha damage up but tanks your RoF and some of your tracking. If you can critical mass with say, 1400mm Maelstorms or Tachyon Abaddons while running  this module, you should be able to outright alpha Dreads and Carriers. On the other hand, an orca at max thrust can speed-tank you. 
---
For engaging battle/cruisers and other battleships, etc, you can not run the module which gives you versatility in engagement envelopes. You're still slow as shit, sure but you have options to engage most everything on the field and with cost effectiveness can serve as a solid capital deterrent.  
---
Best part is, for PvE they'd be relatively untouched since the module hard-locks you into a specific engagement profile for a minute which lets hunters do some on-grid recon and counter appropriately.
---
tl;dr: T1 battleship EHP +A lot, 6 guns for all of them, new mod lets them fight AFs/Frigates/T3Ds but sacrifices fighting cruisers on up, and an anti-capital mode.
---
why not
---
Okay, so get more people out in wormholes and/or increase the number of wandering holes that spawn.
---
expected a picture of a dick on an Astrahus tbh
---
Upvote for dancing krabs
---
I live in high sec with a small corp sorry for not being an f1 monkey :)
---
The only currency worth anything in EVE is people and time.
---
Also I would be careful with statements like
---
&gt; CCP notices, and easily tweaks a few numbers in a database. 
---
And last but not least: The real world economy has two deciding factors you have never heard of in EVE: Finite resources and maintenance costs.
---
Bombers provide about the same DPS. The only difference being they are quishy.
---
It is common sense not to use blops BSs. They have 0 advantages apart from tank.
---
sadly i believe this is true. Eve has been going for so long now that people are used to what they have and any chances that effect the way people are going to play will be seen as bad, no matter how good the changes are for the game over all.....  
---
changes we mostly agree are much needed to help bring in new blood will be see by some as negative, look at blackout as a example.  i love null have live in null for over 4 years, lived everywhere from the north in the drone lands to the failed attempt at a coalition (Mistakes were indeed made.....lol) in immensea, before we joined GSF. with that said, Blackout brought about changes that could of worked well, but didn't, as a large number (myself among them) didn't like it, as it was seen as making nullsec more like Wspace and if we wanted to live in Wspace we would (been there done that, wasn't my style but i see why some people love it) a one shoe fits all policy does not work for eve, what is good for one group, can and probably will be seen as bad for another, blackout was good for hunters, but shit for the hunted. noone wants to play a game that isn't fun for them, and at the end of that day thats what Eve is, a Game even if it can feel like a second job at times.
---
If by damage you mean a bunch of Russian and Chinese bots leaving, then yes.
---
build a wall of hacs and make bots pay for them
---
off yourself, thanks
---
No.
---
Just 'obituary' or 'obit' for short
---
&gt;Wormholes can link together like a clandestine super highway
---
It's like the interstate, except on the interstate you don't have people waiting at turnpikes to fire ATGMs at you.
---
Well, the PCU will rise so *clearly* EVE will become *much* healthier.
---
Lösch dich
---
What's the fit? Overkill deadspace and officer mods?
---
laughs in 1k dps (not polarized)
---
I once watched some wormholers hunting in nullsec. They'd probed down a magpie tractor unit and it had officer mods in it. 
---
I did a bit of zkill detective work as I was curious as to what was going on and found out this hilarious piece off bellendery.
---
Some credit card warrior only a few months old was running a blood raiders DED in an almost full purple fit rattlesnake. The rattle deployed a magpie and proceeded to run the site until he got neutet out, died and then hoovered up by his own MTU. The sad thing was that most of his uber bling dropped and was in the mtu. All he had to do was go scoop it. But it looks like he ragequit instead leaving the wormholers to stumble upon it and scoop billions in purple mods.
---
We need ISK sink not material sink that they already provide.      
---
I stated few times that CCP can add 15bil as additional material requirement when installing new Titan job.
---
Or PI
---
Those supers were still fit with cynos.
---
I hope they get tackled and die.
---
You guys should check vvv in Cobalt edge if you wanna see some real over the top botters.
---
Ew.
---
What is this knockoff you speak of?
---
Is the blue doughnut
---
The cyno change is like the BO, it can perhaps work, but it needs balance. Issue I see right now is big gangs coming in with stukas and tackle a ship. They put up a cyno inhib whilst the tackled ship speaks up on comms (if he/she even does it fast enough) but before we can be ready to drop the inhib is active.
---
So we have to light a recon +150km. As soon as we do that a dictor starts bubblefucking the route to the ship that needs help. No way to reach him, no way to kill the attackers. We just have to sit there and watch them kill the ship/ships then moonwalk out of there. 
---
I dont know how to balance this. People shouldnt drop caps on everything, imo many places should be cyno free even. But if you cant save people (even though many died before as well, the umbrella is mostly psychological quite frankly) then sooner or later it will have the same effect as the BO, people will stop doing it.
---
This one change is potentially neutering cap umbrellas worth trillions. Not to mention that Im still fairly certain offensive drops will be harder. So I dunno man, it feels like we have nerfed one thing but nothing else. Which makes the balance really broken atm. You have to nerf stukafleets and also the whs they use so you cant have ultramobile fleettypes be able to just do whatever they want. Cause thats just OP in the other direction. 
---
You were isk negative on defense fleets before the cynochange even, now they are just pretty much immune.
---
Would you say that HAWs are effective over too wide a range, or that HAWs are too effective within their effective range?
---
A separate but related question: would increasing vulnerability to ewar help keep HAWs in check?
---
Don't forget to warp out and downvote !
---
&gt;  how about instead of clearing anoms in a shitfit VNI (or domi now) that dies to the 1st hunter that shows up, you actually have a decently fit rattlesnake (or a cap) that can handle pvpers showing up long enough for defence to land, not just a full rat tanked, falls over to anything that isnt x damage type shitfit. And yeah why don't you actually have defence for ratters? you said it yourself miners have managed it, but ratters just can't be assed. (my personal opinion is because 90% of anom ratters either AFK heavily or bot) 
---
That's were you don't understand the scale of fleets coming in most coalition space. The lone hunter is not the norm, most of the time it's 10-20 men roaming gang and covert cyno hunters dropping blops and small wings of bombers. If you get engaged, you will die in a matter of seconds 95% of the time.
---
Wormhole don't have cynos and have reduced number of pilots, while farming is done at most one jump away, so it's often easier to save someone.
---
When local is up, ratters can warp off when they see someone coming, but when it isn't, they die.
---
&gt; and yes to a 100man spectre fleet bomber gang, ratters should die, and then they should report there is a fuckoff fleet and the rest of the ratters in the area should dock up til it moves on. woopty do you died to a 100man cloaky gang, this happens what once per week at most? 
---
You heavily underestimate the frequency of such fleets in coalition space. But yes, you warn people when you get dropped, but you're dead at that time.
---
&gt; Yes rorqual changes sped it up, but supercap proliferation was heading this way regardless because with local up in nullsec there is basically no way to stop people mining, its 100% risk proof if you are paying any attention whatsoever. 
---
Rorquals made it risk proof because of the PANIC module. Then again, try to farm in a rorqual in PH/Goons/TEST without it, you get dropped 5 min after being on field because spy/awoxer are stronk.
---
Everything is about balance, and the one we have is CCP throwing ideas down the stairs and implementing the one that landed the farthest.
---
Because at that point you would benefit more from two cyno ships.
---
&gt;Ore, what can be said more.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Rorquals will kill this game
---
I agree. To much isk is the problem, and titans in there current form, are about 20% the effort to produce, compared to the very first one. But I am trying to understand why you said that Rorquals are going to kill the game
---
Would be nice if they made the pve ai better
---
 Extremely valuable salt clouds have been discovered in the /r/eve subreddit which have created a drama rush. CCP was quick to claim 'ownership' as the subreddit borders its intellectual property, but the subreddit mods and the community, as well as multiple famous shitposters from the subreddit, have all claimed their own piece of the salt heap. Inevitably collisions have occurred and the subreddit has become a sort of 'warzone' between various groups of narrative pushers.
---
yeah my spelling is shit, its not a word i use often :p
---
Yes,
---
But the problem is twofold. On one hand CCP needs to do sweeping changes and it shows that the carebears of our community can't accept that. On other hand CCP fails to continue iterating on their new changes and just flops to the next problem while half arsing it.
---
How long they let this happen makes me very pessimistic about their ability to extract meaningful metrics from their game.

Join the channel SF Spectre Fleet, look fora  fleet that sounds interesting to you, and ask the FC to tell you what you could bring as a rookie. 99% of the time our guys will gladly help you out.

Because the only thing that limit your rorqual multiboxing is the limit of how many clients you can run on your PC.
---
Giving an enemy stuka fleet the time to online a cyno jammer means that you fundamentally failed to defend your space. 
---
Set a cyno in system and get ready. If dropped, light it and get the first few fax and dps through. That can be done before the structure anchors.
---
Would it really be that hard to finish the tiericide?
---
There's your answer
---
Aside from very skilled hunters, hunting afk pve ships, the people want balance. Age of chaos is a cool but flawed concept. The chaos is down to player actions and ccp cant flick a switch that changes player behavior. 
---
What EVE plays want and deserve is the age of balance.
---
I loved Eve. Eve was my out, my retreat and man cave. CCP is like that nasty bitch who took it all away. Thankfully there are other games!

Good shitpost.   Have an upvote.

No joke that's such a bullshit video. Almost anything you do in any online game has potential for "butterfly effect".
---
It's still the right move regardless...
---
Give blops BS mini-DD. /s
---
A game where 20% of the population can live in 2% of the available space comfortably has no incentive for war or change. So of course people will want a measure of their own success. That measure for most people has turned to be ISK. For me it certainly is the only thing that is left at the end of the day.
---
In a classical MMO it is a thing like gearscore. But in EvE where you rarely fly a ship fitted in complete purple because it is just nonsense you look for something else. For some people it is owning a titan or a super. Not to be all powerful and mighty because nobody in EvE is that on his own. Mostly just bragging rights. But Owning a fitted titan or having 70 bil in the bank amounts to pretty much the same. 
---
So of course a lot of people want to be more successful/rich. Best ways to go there have been super ratting or rorqual mining. CCP pushed both of these playstyles with the advent of citadels and then let the inflation run wild. They nerfed some and tried to subdue everything a bit but those were still the methods. Now they more or less took that playstyle away and are wondering why they are hemorrhaging players like crazy.
---
With the previous nerfs players just keep getting the idea that the creators of the game don't want them in the game anymore.
---
And now we reverse it and hope people come back. Sounds like a great idea but in truth a lot of those people will not return. With pretty much no warning their playstyle got invalidated and the devs beat their chests and shouted chaos. Instead of finding solutions to the stagnation we now have them rebuilding the NPE to help retention. But in truth this game is not for everybody. It is a klunky mess and the stuff most likely to keep players is a healthy game with a healthy community. Not everybody talking about player numbers dropping into oblivion while somebody is shouting chaos and letting a group of chimpanzees fiddle with the controls for the server.
---
By now the player numbers have dropped so low that even resource scarcity will not bring any sense of urgency back. Or you make resources so scarce that you will also lose the people that enjoy empire building and industry. 
---
The game is spiraling into death and everybody knows it. Their needs to be something worth fighting for so that everybody has something to do. From industrialists to pve players to pvp players. 
---
TLDR: Stop fucking over playstlyes without providing valid alternatives or incentives to do something else.
---
literally eve in a nutshell. Spending billions on officer mods for a +1% improvement on the next tier.
---
If you are not ready ready and start dropping randomly you will just feed harder. I think you are highly underestimating what those fleets can do. They shred everything. Almost BS levels of dps, sig and mobility of frigs with the ability to teleport themselves worse than cynos are able to thanks to WHs.
---
If anything threatens them they can just boosh away. Everything always works in theory but as soon as reality sets in.
---
What danger? I've gone on 10-15 man roams regularly for 4 months now and lost 1 ship and that was because of my own stupidity. If you don't count the tackler I think we've lost less than 10 ships, and that was when we didn't blops.

If you use cloaky ships your risk is next to none.

Oh hey, it's you, the guy who told me I should quit the game and talked shit about my chosen playstyle.  And here you are quitting.  Let me be the first to say: Get fucked!  Good riddance.  Sorry you can't hack it.  Guess you're just an internet tough guy.  Bye felicia.  o7
---
I already unsubbed my ten pvp accounts, reeee
---
Remember to bookmark the hole after you jump in.
---
So afk brought a fight and got cap blobbed? Wormholers...
---
You, by coming here and begging strangers to help you defend it.
---
I had this back with Fatal Ascension. I knew everyone. And then one by one over the years, they left and I was left as one of very few who began it all. I knew nobody. And i never tried to climb the ladder or take charge. I was a line-member the entire time. And i was happy.
---
It's taken years for me to get back to a group of people that I appreciate and like, with many months unsubbed or not even playing. Yes, the blackout has caused a lot of burnout. But that passes. Keep a firm grip of the people you love to play with out of game in some way, so should the worst happen - you don't lose that happiness.
---
o7 best of luck.
---
500k ehp is literally a defence
---
Yeah wormholes, where less than 1% of the population lives, is clearly the problem with Eve right now.
---
We need MBGA hats - Make Battleships Great Again!
---
but they buffed the faucets by removing blackout
---
He did, by posting on r/eve.  Everyone knows that makes you an expert in whatever topic you're posting about.
---
\&gt;  Time-Zone tanking is a huge issue with Citadels, If you have a superior  timezone to your opponent then there is no reason to not set it on a  weekday where most players will struggle to have as much freedom to show  up to off-TZ fights. If you can't beat your opponent in your timezone  you set it to your opponents weakest timezone on a weekday to fatigue  them. In large scale you can set all your structures to the same time so  there is only a 4 hour gap every single week where they can actually  destroy structures. 
---
I mean this was a thing with POS's too. I get the idea; make it as accessible as possible to people with jobs. But it works too well.
---
Maybe if your enemy and you set your 'primary alliance timezone', it splits the difference for a cusp? This would be death for any group that can't protect their interests against overbearing force, ofc..
---
Yes, how very original
---
I sent you a PM.
---
In the end it depends on the numbers. Sure, CCP devs may want to do more blackout, but than the sales and accounting department starts knocking on their armed with baseball bats... So if the blackout is deemed very harmful to CCPs financials, it won't really happen again...
---
So the problem is then multiboxing rorquals - again, this would just make the ore price crash. Making is useless to mine.  But that is not happening, because just as much isk is being generated to offset the crash
---
Yes, N26 Spaces...
---
https://n26.com/en-eu/spaces
---
Canes to IPX !!!
---
Real answer if you want a ton of money and have money to invest, go do incursions.
---
Been like that for years and the billboards are clearly not empty so you are clearly talking out your ass.
---
It was the fact that the blackout wasnt needed to control faucets, there are/were other methods available. The blackout actually caused issues as you say. I dont think they reinstated it simply due to unsubs, it also hurt the economy.
---
but you want easy targets. miner sitting and dying.
---
killboards green, op success. Maybe they do not want to fight, some people might even hate it
---
Well if WH space gives so good money, why there is such a small population?
---
spoiler: WH can only hold very limited amount of people, Requires a lot of tasks that dont give any benefit and requires a lot of communication between corp mates (**Everyone** needs to be at comms **100%** of time if logged in, mainly to a reason that if you move around others know roughly who went and where since WH mass, no local (scouts report by activation -&gt; you need to call on comms **every time** you active hole from X to Y so that the guy who keeps eyes with 15 alts doesnt need to alt tab throught them all to see who was it.) etc).
---
you wrong
---
oh skills bothers me the least. Content is the word.
---
Not sure if epic troll or somebody that really needs some help (not Hilmar)...
---
I know the Iskian Empire is a botting alliance
---
lmao wow
---
Wow.   That's some premium salt there.   Welcome to Reddit!
---
But then you would not need to keep money on your alts to prevent fat finger buying stuff at 10x the price. Where would be the fun in that?
---
GF
---
a massive battleship buff could come with a total pve overhaul to avoid the problems you mentioned
---
Looks like the same details. Or what is the difference?
---
The problem is that all the details you see ingame come from textures. The models are kinds low poly. So if you want high detail prints you have to apply all the effects (bump map?) the engine does with a 3D modelling program, fix manifolds and export it again. And then it's still not really optimized for 3d printing.
---
But if you find an easy way to get better 3d models please let me know.
---
CCP, listen to this man! It will save you a lot of trouble in 3 months.
---
Good job! Selling escalations is overrated!
---
Nothing special about this
---
I just prefer to play a game then to constantly whine about it. Fuck off already what the fuck.
---
I think thats a very fair assesment. I do think this is CCP's plan, but there are many factors inbetween my prediction and reality, including the points you make. If I were looking to make a more realistic prediciton, I would say that this was a trial of blackout for a role in the upcoming system, and depending on their assesment may be one of the final items included.
---
 "start making some yourself".  As for myself, sure, i\`ll go full PvE mode to grind enough cash to supply PvP needs without restrictions... BUT...   
---
If i ask a bunch of randoms here , on *reddit,*  to go to jita to form up and fly with me (or dare to say with me as FC)  to lowsec or nullsec in cruisers/bcs/bs/*anythingyouaren\`te100%*  so we can have some good time and kill some random dudes/gangs in low sec because my corp is always 30% not here, 80% ratting,  50% risk averse, 25% not in my timezone, 15% won\`t fly unless specific ships adding to 200% WON\`T UNDOCK unless something blingy there is to kill or/and you are a regular/popular FC or/and there is 100% SRP...  that might not happen (or most likely won\`t happen).

Wow, so much for "forcing people to dock".
---
Alliance leaderships told people to stop supercapital ratting to have some time to figure out how to handle the change and its implication correctly in term of defensive capability.
---
Is that so strange ?
---
&gt; once again, the goal of blackout isn't there to nerf pvers or nerf the production of players, it's a side effect
---
What was the goal then? Because i can see no other effect than that.

&gt;there is more to eve than
---
&gt;assets generated = assets destroyed

All of the core gameplay loops revolve around these concepts.

Even is this goes full Serenity there will still be fun/satisfaction to be had. That fact keeps enough players in that CCP doesn't need to face reality really. Sad, but true

It is not misleading. Stuff like that will happen if you do PVP long enough. I still chat with one of my "victims" from time to time. I made an mistake and she managed to destroy my ship. I was her first pvp kill. That was 7 years ago.

Wait what do you expect? Just watch the MOTD and join Forums/Discord/Mumble/TS and go have a chat with others.

Ask in your respective newbro channel if you have questions. 
---
I joined PH and no one came to me and said: Oh poor newbro can I wipe your ass? Would you like a coffee after that? 
---
If you are truly interested in actually playing the game then you will find out on your own. Living 2019 where you can google *everything* and still wants to get babysitted.
---
The bonuses of the other three racial blops battleships are all primary weapon focused.  Changing the widow to match is the probably best solution.  If CCP were interested in iterating it towards a good place, I'd recommend changing the role bonuses, and then revisiting it later and tuning the pg/cpu.
---
It ever being for ewar wasn't a balanced design decision, and with the new implementation of ecm, it makes even less sense to have it that way.
---
Your assumptions are pulled straight from that ass you call a face. We don't know what % of the population lives in what areas. So stop acting like we do.
---
But the old Bois should have logged back in by now
---
I completely  agree with  Innominate that is the way to go. Unfortunately at this point of time CCP are fire fighting here and there and it seems they are not paying attention to the bigger picture.
---
Blackops ability to warp cloaked when?
---
So back to wow forever then
---
For a bit more detail. If you think you will play EVE for longer than 2 weeks and you want to spend some money you should do it on SKill Injectors. 
---
SP will remain permanently and you can only benefit. Beware: Starting at 5M-50M SP every Large Skill Injector gives "only" 400k SP, not 500k.
---
I would strongly advice to not cash for any ship you may want to buy. You don't have experience in flying and will likely lose it at some point.
---
This.
---
Working fine on mobile.
---
Oh it is more than ore crash.      
---
We already see the effects of ore price crash.         
---
The issue is that this affects every aspect of the game in a negative way.       
---
Cheap ships are fun, but at some point to cheap ships create significant issues. 
---
Simply to say carrier hull costing 2bil is fine with another 1bil in capital modules fitted, but the same carrier costing 600mil for hull and and 300mil in capital modules fitted is bit broken.          
---
The issue is not in the hull abilities but how cheap it becomes and how it overshadows other things.
---
I was reading Reddit laughing at you people paying for a game you can't play.
---
Ghey
---
&gt; to introduce risk into nullsec participants
---
The ONLY effect this can have is reduction in production.
---
&gt;define 'core gameplay loops'
---
Any task that you can do in the game that involves interaction with assets is one of three things. Production, ratting, mining, industry, increasing the opportunity value of items like hauling and station trading, or consumption of items, ratting, PVP, consumption of normal consumable items like ammo, other charges and boosters. 
---
So it goes from ships in space having a chance to cause consumption (from them being destroyed) producing to ships in space with the goal of consumption (PVP, destroying other ships and potentially being destroyed themselves.) 
---
I'm inclined to believe this cycle from creation to destruction contains every single playstyle. Unless you can name something that falls outside of this greater loop.
---
Anything that "Scales Well" means its broken as fuck and is the answer to the riddle... Why is the game so fucked up...
---
Bots ramping back up.
---
(yes i truly believe most of these accounts that left were bots!)
---
Less than 1% of nullsec made 265m ticks before the fighter nerfs, yet we still got  the nerfs. Should wormhole space not be equal and treated like the rest?
---
I just checked zkill and it's fine for me. I'm inclined to believe it's something on your end.
---
Plot Twist: Mini DD is triggered by self destructing the BO core and apply 400k damage to ships within 10KM from it in 2 waves one 4s after another. .              
---
This is instant and it is put just below the 'Bridge To' option.
---
This simply overcomplicates the system for no actual benefot or change.
---
So inflation?
---
Its gonna ho lower soon, after the chaos but not so chaos shit they pulled
---
Well, if one guy can afford a PvE titan or super, he should be able to have a cloaked recon following his isk printing machine. How many alliances ask to have a Fax alt for the same reason ? Faxes were the thing to have as a super/titan pilot, now it evolved to recons. (not that much isk to invest when you super rat)
---
The example you gave here is exactly what i meant by "counterplay": in order to defend a strategic asset like a super or a titan, you need to start thinking on how and where to light your cyno. Every super/titan pilot will now be requiring a recon alt following him around, ready to light a cyno at a convenient spot for the def fleet. If you landed too late and can't reach a convenient spot cause the grid is bubble fucked, the attackers win.
---
Prior cyno changes a brain wasn't even needed tbh, all people did was pretty much light their cyno and wait for the cavalry to save them. Like you said, sometimes it didn't happen and the guy died but most of the time, they lived and the attackers lost countless expensive ships. So yeah, right now big toys are more vulnerable and fuckups can happen and will cause losses, but is that a bad thing when you see a goonswarm move op with 1200 titans and 2k supers?  
---
The only real issue i see with the nerf is indeed for offensive ops, recons and blops don't have enough EHP and will pretty much get blapped as soon as they'll decloak on grid. Against a 30 man gang, it leaves quite some time to get a big chunk of your fleet trough the cyno but against a capital blob, the cyno will be instapopped. I'm fairly certain CCP will iterate the current changes though, there's a lot of tweaks needed for sure.
---
Mining will leave you like this.
---
Mostly don't mine, or you'll get caught in a cycle where you get better at mining while waiting to be good at more exciting things.
---
Yes YES more C4 violence kill them all in game YES
---
 "you can either have good PvE or good PvP in a region, never both"  
---
Why not both, what is the obstacle?
---
but Widow is not just more ehp. it's jump drive + bridge as well. take it when you need it.
---
What if the point of all of this, the black out, the cyno changes, ect, was to nerf income from ratting? What if CCP wants to turn the faucet down a little bit, and increasing risk to ratters was the way to do it? Maybe they're trying to push you towards some other way to make isk because ratting is broken and has been for a long time?
---
And what if capitals are too strong? Maybe they were never intended to be used as a "drop on anything that moves" solution? Maybe CCP never thought it would get to this point because they were so expensive, and thus they didn't even think to balance cynos around them because they didn't even think that ubiquitous cynos would be a problem?
---
Of course it wouldn't be hard.
---
But it's CCP.
---
Reports on current politics can be found on Youtube from Jintaan
---
This is one of those ideas that has been suggested since YC105 but will likely never see the light of day.
---
Brave Newbies sounds like the place for you guys.
---
Every wormhole has at least one static (c2 and c4 have 2 statics.) This static wormhole leads to a certain class of space. Be it c1, c4 whatever it could be it could even be kspace areas like high, low or nullsec (terms and conditions apply, some combinations don't exist.)
---
But aside from these holes a wormhole also has a static set of 'wandering' holes that can randomly spawn and don't respawn when they get rolled or time out. These wandering holes create a lot of the randomness of the connections of wormhole space. 
---
kspace has its own set of wandering holes as well. These connect any random high low nullsec system to wormhole space instead of the other way around. The result is that it's very possible to take a wormhole from highsec, into a hole with a highsec static and then take the static back out to a different place in highsec.
---
EA is guilty of way more crap than CCP. They've murdered franchises beyond count in their quest for milking as much cash out of them as possible.
---
Yeah how dare people enjoy pve, or hauling, or manufacturing or God forbid the chill out social side of the game... don't they know this is a pvp ONLY game ?
---
I have a feeling this was a trial run, and once they get the actual structures finished for setting up local and running intel and stuff, they'll begin re-introducing the blackout.
---
My corp uses a system that looks like this ABC-CX-K162 where the ABC is the sig of the wormhole, the CX is the class (C1, C2 etc) and the K162 part is the kind of wormhole you are looking at when you bookmarked it. So if you are looking at a X702 you know you have a wandering kspace connection to C3 space that would be ABC-C3-X702 and the other side would always be K162.
---
And then we add an asterisk * to the front to indicate that the wormhole leads back home as opposed to away from our homes. This causes the wormhole to appear at the top of the list of bookmarks in the right click menu so you can just follow the top entry back up the chain to home. Even if the chain loops in on itself it'll still lead you home.
---
I am a dancing crab !
---
very wrong, you can lock any ship that jams you if its one or 100 doesnt make a difference
---
1) you may have warped to the wrong bookmark
---
2) your shuttle may have been misalligned, and therefore your bookmark broken
---
3) you may have been on the opposite side of the undock variance (there is a slight variation on undocking angle each time you undock, if your shuttle was 5 degreees to the right, and your bestower undocked 5 degrees to the left, you'd need a second or two to warp)
---
You can be friends with non-blues and still shoot them. Now strictly that's not friends and enemies but it is pretty close.
---
There is the reddit Eve Online discord and the Praise bob (Focused on wh community)
---
PM me if you want invite
---
Lol, good luck jamming the carrier as it's 10% chance to jam per cycle
---
When making an undock bookmark use the tactical overlay to ensure you are flying straight and not at an angle. Ships undocking from a station 'spray' out by a few degrees. Watch the Jita undock for a bit and you'll see what I mean. Also make your undock bookmark much further than 160km. Yes you can warp to 160km from the undock but I'll have burned an interceptor to you before you align to where-ever you are warping next.
---
apparently they dun. ban them?
---
There's too much free space for bots to operate in for you to rely on players pushing them out by wanting to use said space. Currently at least.
---
&gt;The ONLY effect this can have is reduction in production.
---
are you saying blackout can't have any effect on risk in nullsec? yikes
---
Screw you CCP. You did something good and then still managed to fuck up
---
Queue the spike in Gila prices.
---
🦀🦀🦀 BLACKOUT IS GONE 🦀🦀🦀
---
Sounds like he had his application on hold so he'd have no access to brave services.
---
When you unlock, there is some variation in your launch vector. If your shuttle was far from straight your insta may not be be directly ahead, and not work instantly for a subsequent undock.
---
Test this by undocking in first person camera mode. You'll see the variation and whether each unlock is in alignment. If most of them aren't, make a new one. 
---
If your insta is mostly ok, you can also just live with it and redock when you get a bad angle with no risk.
---
No, because we're elite motherfucker.  You're all just F1 krabs.  We play Eve on hard mode.  When you're all on our level, we can be "equal" - until then keep crying about the blackout and your ticks.
---
All these dank VNI Ganks you are missing now:(
---
Paragraphs are a thing, holy wall of text.
---
And cat ears and wings for characters
---
quite literally what i said
---
I was meaning mass and agility. Some BS are unbalanced due to this, ie nestor and leshak.
---
wormholes are like vertical houses with doors at same place,you open door walk throught rooms,corridors to another doors exit that home and enter next one throught another doors you walk  next rooms corridors then exit that home and you walk next next next..
---
Also curious.  Since PvP lost the battle for Eve's soul, how can I get some of that hot krab action?
---
its gonna plummet even further cause now that most roamers have seen the light and how fun the game could be, they wont be satisfied by this abomination
---
You're a fucking idiot aren't you intaky.
---
Power level's over 9k tho
---
You just said they didn't leave tho...
---
Most of them are immobile bricks now, and they're barely ever used because of exactly that.
---
Even if your bookmark is exactly in the direction of the undock vector, you can be ejected with an angle bigger than your warp requirement.
---
In this case, ctr space, wait a bit, dock, restart.
---
Kind of reminds me of LoL, least on that game you can get a champion before they nerf it into the ground not spend 6 months training for it.
---
Add fixed chat to chat.  Then, still no.
---
Can u get dread bombed?
---
Back in the day when i first came into 0.00 space and into pvp ... i joined a gang where 2 Machas were the major DPS (if i remember correctly it was a part of future Hydra) i never saw a battleship (piratefaction) in space before and a long time after that i didn´t saw one again. 
---
Now days these ships a maindoctrines ...WTF! (or at least have been for quite a time!). A Machariel was worth like 1.2 bil when i first checked it on market! Now it is like 400 mil or so? 
---
Sometimes i´m wondering about the fact that faction and pirate faction Bs are that cheap when there are no real isksinks ingame! But than again it is something you can farm ... and everything you can farm is constantly abused by someone! 
---
Abusing is for me if you can rent bots in Jita local chat for 15 bugs a mounth and that bot will farm the shit out of eve ... and if you think not my problem! Your are totally wrong! Because it is not just one...! 
---
So if you know someone  pls stop him! Cause he is one of those who is harming the game.... lot more than blackouts are doing!
---
i was repairing engine on my yacht,fuck diesels.
---
then glorious nyx alpha it off field
---
And you would be wrong.
---
Can agree with this entirely, as a former war deccer I knew sooner or later they would nerf wars because combined with other alliances we were hammering kills so hard it wasnt even funny.
---
I did feel in away forced to that type of 'camp pipe/station' gameplay though due to previous nerfs that killed hunting. Once hunting &amp; camping both got nerfed all my gameplay was removed.
---
Out of 100 lone T3Cs that jump a gate I'm sitting on, 99 are cloaky-nullified, and you manage to fine the one Tengu that isn't either.
---
I think so too now. I thought it's another baby. I look like an idiot with my rant
---
Never
---
It's not correct
---
That actually happened a few times last week. Good laughs were had on comms.
---
So is the reason they’re not used because they’re slow or because they get nailed by bomber’s? It sure sounds like it’s the bombers that is the issue not the speed. Also my suggestion has nothing to do with speed and only signature. There are lots of ways to get around that by using micro jump drives warping in and out or using longer range weapon systems instead of close range weapons
---
There are beginner corps that will guide you alot better than a single person could ever do. One of the most prominent and well known beginner Corps is EVE UNI , known for helping EVE newbros through the basics for more than 10 years.  
---
As I am still a part of them, and they gave me a huge knowledge and progression boost, I also want to mention SEADC. The idea being close to EVE UNI, SEADC offers lots of content that you can chose to paetake in or not (learning courses and fleets, adanced fleets), as well as a coalition structure that allows you to progress through different gamestyles and types of space by just hopping corp inside of the coalition, which can be done at any time without any hassle.
---
Most def.
---
ooof
---
I quit in 2007.  Warfare became progressively less economic over the last several years before I quit.
---
And mass-reply to them with "Our logs show nothing"
---
I haven't played since ecm changes.... Are Target breakers removed from game or entirely useless now?
---
In order for BS to be viable in today's meta they either need to bring back the ability to brawl (being unable to catch kitey ships means brawlers are dead in the water) or give the battleships the mobility to keep up with the other faster ships. 
---
Take a range bonused battleship like the Apoc vs a standard fast doctrine like Munins. At max engagement range of the munin the apoc can't track the MWD cruiser. Even if you started the fight at the apoc's considerable 175km maximum attack range (more than double that of the munin) guess what that is? it's within warp in range of the apocs which even without MWD have huge sigs and are easy to probe. You just warp in at 40, load shorter range ammo and start deleting the battleships one every arty fire cycle.
---
Never understood his specific hate boner for WHs.
---
Was there multiple stations in the system? You might have put the bookmark off the wrong station.
---
But some advice for the future: CTRL+D.
---
Turn on the distance overlay. Most, if not all, stations eject directly East, North, etc. When making bookmarks in a shuttle, manually steer so that the compass axes line up perfectly with the station.
---
You'll end up with perfect insta bookmarks.
---
Regardless which character you chose, you should be able to redo the tutorial missions. They introduced a new guidance window, called The Agency, that should be on your screen on startup. You should be able to restart agent arcs from there.

Some kind of eve retirement program for old wormholer
---
Did you really just make the argument that a pox NAV a pox can’t track micro warpdriving cruisers?
---
Weren’t golden navy apocalypse used to slam sig tanking cruisers for a long time?
---
If your ship sucks, it's just because you don't have enough of them.
---
I mean sure. But it has consequenses. As we have seen. I would much rather have them straight nerf income rather than try to get people to break habits. Cause if people realise they can get rid of one habit they might think its okey to get rid of the habit of playing the game.
---
DNG is recruiting on Grobbulus, we accept all EvE refugees
---
Lmao just look at your skill que
---
Such a good idea.. congrats!
---
The carebear tards will immediately downvote and tell you that caps stockpiles as cheap as cruisers is so healthy for the game! Infinity assets make so much sense in their heads.
---
This whole thread needs a translator.
---
All krabs get the abyssal treatment - CCP probably
---
Not in the form of a question! Overruled?
---
Yeah but he also might have just warped to the wrong bookmark though
---
just playing ping pong with stratios and capsule using my nestor
---
From one crab, an even more prolific crab: Good shitpost!
---
Remove panic from roqs and a lot of the issues are solved there.
---
This is how it *should* be... Unfortunately, CCP did not go with logic, but what fit them best in this case.  
---
Obviously, if you get jammed by two sources, Jam from target a) prevents lock on target b) and vice versa (by logic). Guess that was still too strong for what CCP imagined (which is funny, instead of going with a soft nerf and leaving the mechanic in the game partly, they chose to completely remove it. Seems familiar?)
---
nailed it, thanks for being awesome :) i think we can all agree the bots are the baddest thou.
---
DDOS attack to skew player activity data with blackout disabled?
---
^ This right here.
---
One thing Globby didn't mention is that you can use the tactical overlay to check the accuracy of your undock BMs since *most* stations will kick you out along one of the cardinal directions.
---
My statement stands, quit eve and find the help you need o7
---
Good luck if you stay, you are toxin
---
What this guy said. Had lots of fun convos with people I killed repetitively in their krabbing ships, gave some of them advice and they moved on. Just because you're blowing up each others pixels doesnt mean you cant like each other.
---
The only farming simulator I'd ever play. LOL
---
But seriously, what is with all the videogames of jobs? I don't want to work all day then come home and do a fake job for fun. I don't get it at all.
---
[Yes that's exactly what i'm saying.](https://i.imgur.com/HyBrNPc.png)
---
You could get better tracking in this Apoc vs munin setup using different guns but then you could not achieve the goal of ultra long range projection.
---
So wrong indeed.
---
You left out npc pockets in every region.
---
No bots in the dronelands eh. Pfew.
---
The announcement thread was automatic locked because it hit the 10,000 post limit of their forums software. We're not talking about 100 replies or a vocal minority.

Blackout is gone? I don't believe you.
---
I haven't logged in since PES 2020 came out and I don't have time to log in and check.
---
Every dam thread
---
There isnt any counterplay for the defender, thats what Im seeing. 
---
The main issue I have is with stukas. If you drop dreads on grid to kill a super/titan/rorq thats fine. You are committing. But with stukas you dont really risk anything. I fear, or rather I already know, that they are simply too OP in this new era. They already were strong but now they are unstoppable.
---
No change is inherently bad but if you change one thing you have to change other things aswell. Its just balancing the scales. Thats why the BO didnt work, everyone just went with one type of ships leaving no counterplay. Now we have lost the only half assed counter to stukas and everyone will just use them for whaling. It already was like that but now nobody will even try anything else.
---
I dont like that at all. That fleet comp needs to be nerfed, it needed it before but it most certainly needs it now. Outside of that the cyno changes arent bad. I dont like the heavy restrictions though. Its very costly, a t2 frig would be much saner in terms of both SP and isk cost for the ship itself. 
---
And also ye the offensive aspect. I dont think there is a way around needing capital hard cynos but we can wait that one out and see what happens the first time a big cap fight kicks off. Maybe people find a way around it.
---
Those has been unsubbed when goons were born
---
&gt; are you saying blackout can't have any effect on risk in nullsec? yikes
---
You keep trying to seperate the two. They aren't separate. 
---
&gt;you're bonkers if you're seriously implying that risk is static and can't be changed because it's a player driven system.
---
Biggest way to increase risk is to encourage players to interact. When you cause the interaction to be completely one sided the other side stops playing.
---
True.
---
So just like the other guy you want your cake and eat it too.
---
You want ultra long projection,with great tracking, great dps, and maneuverability.
---
Its like you don't want any downsides at all!
---
Also, its kinda useless to link that without showing the fit or ammo used.
---
No Im talking about the clip. Which miner even needs help against NPCs nowadays.
---
Money money money!
---
you are stretching  .... a lot. 
---
it isn't a required day of the week, the belts respawn every 4 hours or so right now, so just increase that timer to a week. there will be plenty to mine every day, just not in the same system.  this is not a hard concept.  also it is an easy dial to move around. 
---
minerals are a side product from moon mining to fill in the gaps of goo.   decreasing them won't hurt most of the value of the moon. 
---
combat spawn decrease hurts big grouped up corps or alliances.  forcing them to spread out.  small corps are not affected. 
---
no tether prevents dead stations being used for safety.  
---
same with no docking.  fuel can be dropped off the same way stuff is dropped off now without docking.  impossible?  not even fucking hard. 
---
break the balance of their uses.  yea no shit sherlock, that is the fucking point.  to break the balance right now that exists because of endless resources that allow for endless spam of stuctures. 
---
none of this is hard.  all of it is basically adjusting a few dials.  (which can also be played with after the fact).
---
I'll take all of your Proteuses.  I'm building up a collection in hopes that they'll finally be good one day.
---
160km is nice but I rather go 1600km... the further away the spot, the less you actually need to align... thats why all my toons can use ceptors... well and viators... get a mwd atron and dont use stations where you cant just redock...
---
I’ll word it another way.. when looking for places to roam I had very little options. All over the map with “active pilots in space” selected I would be lucky to find systems with anymore than 2-3 and even those were very rare.
---
It's definitely not. JF can hit 1mil and they still die all the time. You get warp scrammed and it's game over.
---
They have no plan. Anything they may have said in the past is null and void due to the mass amounts of subs they prob started to lose which prompted them to turn the blackout off.
---
perhaps DDOS = blackout :D
---
People have given you good advice. You also always need to try out your BMs before you use them "live". Also they dont always seem to work, I personally never had issues with them but I have heard that CCP did something a while back and they are not fullproof anymore. But since I havent had issues myself I cant really argue for it.
---
It's not CCP that make the game not fun. Of course people are never happy with nerfs, but a nerfs doesn't make the game un fun, actually a nerf often tries to make the game more fun.
---
The problem is that some people have fun from exploiting unbalanced mechanics and shitting on those who didn't adapted to it.
---
In eve this takes special proportions because of the numbers involved and some nerds gaming the game against its developers.
---
Basically the blue donut broke the game, and everyone agreed that EVE was dying. But at the same time, CCP can't do shit to fix it, because any change that affects the blue donut but wasn't supported by them have no chance to be carried over, or what happened this month happen.
---
And the blue donut will never endorse a change that challenges its supremacy or its ability to shit on anyone that isn't the blue donut.
---
Stalemate. Congratulations. Everything must change, but nothing can change. Welcome to the realm of politics.
---
Now if CCP can come up with a plan that can change the game subtly enough for people to not mass riot but ultimately enough for the game to get in a healthy state, they can overcome this. Good luck though.
---
From what  I gather from our people in AFK : 
---
Last month we had to repel a more or less well organized invade from the C2 ElITe pVp coaliation :

---
They mostly failed to their lack of usefull hole control allowing us to bring some people in.
---
At this time AFK were offering their help if we more or less suicide our fleet to get hole control. They got pissed when we declined and wanted to teach us a lesson (and mostly have a good fight).
---
A frenchy in AFK told us in advance it was coming for us, but he was only able to get us a spare month instead of a week as they planned. we used this time to remove most of the assets from our WH (yeah its mostly empty now).
---
AFK arrived on sunday for the 1st fight where they fragged 5 of our caps ([https://br.inyour.space/?s=1001556&amp;b=8785380&amp;e=1530&amp;t=rb](https://br.inyour.space/?s=1001556&amp;b=8785380&amp;e=1530&amp;t=rb)) 
---
They offered to give us hole control to get some people in to get a more or less fair fight on monday, so we did.
---
they brough the counter to our homedef, but we improvised, adapt, and overcame :

---
The rest is history, according to Bob's law, they now have to move to C4.
---
GF AFK, some of you are my friends, some are the people who unknowingly brought me to WHspace, this fight was one of the best memory I will ever have of this game.
---
What makes you think Hilmar cares about EVE to the point that it affects his mental health? He cashed out with the sale to PA after a series of very smart business decisions (skill injectors, f2p, rorquals), although bad for the game, which severely inflated the sale value of CCP.
---
The fit is just Tachyons with prop vs a munin with a prop. Munin 720mm arty range with long range ammo like Proton, Carbonized Lead or Nuclear is 72km optimal. So adjusting the Apoc crystals to Ultraviolet gives the highest damage while being able to shoot that far gives this graph.
---
You say we want no downsides but there's no upside to using a battleship.
---
No, posts abusing B4R and it's flair are banned.

Well we need the help of old vets with Salt Mining V and Salt Processing V, since the level 5s of both skills are like 1 year training times most of us young people dont have these powerful skills (and their t2 modueles like the salt miners and salt grinders)

So no tracking computers, no tracking enhancers, no tracking rigs?
---
So you're just flying the base battleships, using the shit tracking tachs, without trying to compensate for its downsides?
---
If your FC does that against muninns, you deserve to lose.
---
Blackout as a short term event made sense. Then after a few weeks the lore could have been that the communication nodes cannot be fully repaired resulting in bandwidth issues so there may be delays. This is when you iterate as a game maker and implement an actual delay on when people show up in local. But like I've said, CCP is really bad at this.
---
shiiiiiiiiit, i'd be totally down for an Eve-version of Planetside 2. But the way it was supposed to work (ground/aerial combat on planets which have planetary interaction structures, some form of interaction with players in orbit)? they'll never get enough players to populate each world
---
That was the first thing he said.
---
Ouch:(
---
Shit if you can't get off to killing other players in Eve then why are you here
---
How long did it take? What percentage infill did you go with?
---
Delete this! Need more kill mails in the world!
---
Why would they bother now, they didn't bother losing 50 % of the player base between 2016 and 2018, why would they bother now when people in Goons or Test unsub their Rorqual Alts because their leadership told them so ?
---
I’ll throw you guys some isk mail me in game CJ Agnon. All my isk should go to good use.
---
oof so you are worse than horde. imagine playing a game and staying in the tutorial the whole time
---
Because i wanted someone who plays to explain? When I google anything to do with EVE i get pages of bullshit. I checked the subred there was no post about what the Blackout actually is, just everyone complaining about it.
---
But you're a dick because you spent more time telling me to google it when you could of answered, whiched is cancer.
---
Distance has *nothing* to do with alignment. It's purely angle. It's good to make the bm further out, but only because it makes it less likely is sitting there.
---
Blacklisting is still a thing. Speaking as a new player &lt;  1 year. After leaving a mega corp, you'll find the choices are limited to join corps in the former alliance or coalition, maybe neutral corps like eve scout or eve uni, or go back to high sec and go solo. That join a Corp, any Corp is bad advice. Just paying it forward.
---
Depends - Will it make CCP money?
---
Rumors have been confirmed, dangerous levels of salt deposits have been indeed spotted on r/eve. MD's named this phenomena the Salt-Crab-Crybaby-Entitled Syndrome which is causing the formation of these deposits. Specialists say that it is a very aggressive contagious chronic psychological disease and quarantine is advised. Stay tuned for further updates.
---
10,000 replies from how many people?
---
Also the assumption that born of those posts are in favor of it would be a fallacy.
---
It’s a shame really. I understand the economics of that decision, I really do. At the same time, I think most players and prospective players would love to be more closely tied to their actual in game character instead of just a pod in space. Fact is there was not the dev time to make that happen... it really should have been a feature from the beginning. Just imagining how cool it could have been to walk around a station and “socialize “ before a Corp meeting or fleet is interesting. It could have been great imho.
---
&gt; So you're just flying the base battleships, using the shit tracking tachs,
---
You need tachs to shoot across the entire battlefield. You compromise on this goal by fitting better tracking shorter range guns. This creates another downside.
---
&gt;No painters? No webs?
---
Now you are adding support ships that are considerably faster than the battleships but shackled to the battleships. At that point you are just compensating for the downsides of the platform. That isn't an upside.
---
fuck off with your wormhole safety bullshit, we like the dangers of nullsec
---
If you want less Ore, blow more ships up. It is a rather simple solution. With resources being so abundant groups need to stop worrying about losing ships and just go fight.
---
This. They're basically cheap dickstars that are annoying for the utility/docking/tether/asset safety they provide, but they cant shoot shit.
---
Imho the subcap weapons need a decent buff, while the ability for capitals to be used against them needs to be balanced.
---
Capitals, subcaps and structures should exist in a rock/paper/scissors situation, completely flipped from the current implementation. Subcaps should be able to engage capitals effectively, but succumb to structure defenses. Captials should be the go-to for dealing with structures (reducing the manpower needed to deal with undefended structures), but requiring subcap support for structures actually being defended, which leads to actual PVP and not mindless bashing. Finally, structures should be able to defend against moderately sized subcap fleets, but be pummeled by capitals, which cost more, have higher skill requirements, and are far more at risk once deployed.
---
Remove tether on low power structures and, reduce the time needed to bash them further, nerf anticap weapons, and set structure spam limits on non-sov holders (1 XL, 2 L, 3 M-sized structures per enemy alliance). Asset safety i'm impartial towards, as its an important part of player retention, but perhaps adjust it to divert to the nearest LS/HS/NPC Null station, rather than just lowsec, or divert it to the a "capital structure", specified by the alliance/corp.
---
Finally, follow the lore surrounding the TCUs/fluid router network and make them a requirement for installing an Observatory, giving the sov holder more control, at a cost, for their ability to administrate the basic functionality of the old Intel problems (turn on/off local, dscan, system wide decloak burst, automatic anom classification, etc.).
---
I think i'm arguing with an idiot.
---
&gt;Now you are adding support ships that are considerably faster than the battleships but shackled to the battleships. At that point you are just compensating for the downsides of the platform. That isn't an upside.
---
YOU MEAN LIKE EVERY SINGLE FUCKING DOCTRINE THAT REQUIRES WEBS AND PAINTS?
---
After killing the super carrier in my first incursion one of the gsf incursion pilots (maybe dirk Steele) warped to the wreck and started towing it around with a tractor beam.
---
&gt; we like the dangers of nullsec
---
Ahahahahah
---
Someone is upset. 
---
This post doesn’t even touch base on WH’s besides the one variable described.
---
I think you need to go back to bed.
---
Read the fucking post
---
While I agree this is good for the person who actually plays, its also not good due to the amount of bots that will now be running again. After blackout hit the number of bots running in the common botting areas were close to non existent.
---
The effect that bots have on the overall health of eve is incredibly detrimental. Why couldn't everyone just make peace and adapt. :/
---
I didn't know that Huigins and Lokis were a lot faster than Munins. Or maybe i'm missing that nice battleship support that can web out to 70km. If you are going to be running cruiser support ships anyway why run with slower poorer tracking battleships for dps? There is no upside to running the battleships as your dps ships that's the point.
---
Maybe before you call someone else an idiot you should make sure you thought through what you have to say.
---
Saving this post for later. I saved CCPs roadmap from fanfest and they have more or less stuck to it since it came out.
---
I love two scoops of armchair psychology in the morning.
---
For the record, I was actually entertained by this. It was definitely amusing seeing the random shit that would pop up in local. Since there was no local otherwise, it wasn't exactly a loss of anything.
---
I almost wonder if some of these bugs are not their attempt at fuzzing the bots. We know they watch local, so feed them data that doesn't make sense and see who jumps. 
---
ofc probably they are just bugs, but the data is getting logged anyway. Hopefully they put it to use.
---
A while back they changed it so you undock at some random range of angles. It used to be you undock in a perfect striaght line so insta undocks always worked perfectly. Now they will work but you will still need to align for a few seconds in something big.
---
EVE is a game about getting money to buy exotic dancers
---
&gt;Or maybe i'm missing that nice battleship support that can web out to 70km.
---
Rapiers/Huginns can get OBSCENE web ranges with abyssal webs.
---
Again, it really sounds like you want battleships to do everything with no downsides.
---
"Why can't my tach apocs without any tracking computers/webs/paints hit these mwd sig bonused munnins?"
---
Nah CCP seems to be pretty good about reimbursements. I DC’d on warp-in to a C4 site and lost my ~2B Golem. I had it back within minutes.
---
Pretty much this. It hurt their wallets too much, they will try a different concept next time.
---
You forgot to add /s ^(based on your reddit name)
---
Slight increase in warp speed, and scan res, allow BBS to fit an ADC?....
---
It's protection against attacks but not immunity to them. 
---
If you had no defences then you'd be getting ganked by solo corvettes.
---
🦀🦀🦀CCP IS POWERLESS AGAINST KRABS🦀🦀🦀
---
This would be great. 
---
Considering how well everyone took losing local and then getting it back again, these changes will be well appreciated and accepted by the community!
---
F
---
&gt; Rapiers/Huginns can get OBSCENE web ranges with abyssal webs.
---
I'm sorry did you miss the first part where i mentioned them and the follow up where i talked about having support cruisers mixed in?
---
&gt;Again, it really sounds like you want battleships to do everything with no downsides.
---
Tell me what the downsides Munins have and upsides battleships have vs eachother then.
---
&gt;"Why can't my tach apocs without any tracking computers/webs/paints hit these mwd sig bonused munnins?"
---
More like why use battleships when you could just use munins yourself.
---
Because a 50% decline over years isn't as scary as the drop we saw in the last 2 months.
---
Not really a big deal, most people use HICs to roll anyways because of mass manipulation. BShips we just a fast forward button but we could also just make  our Corp mates help more often.
---
So people who have quit should vote for a CSM member who has also quit to represent them?
---
You can't be right because i'm right and you'r  wrong.
---
Neither PL or Goons or anyone else are unstoppable or invincible or inescapable. I've operated everywhere I felt like including their spaces more often successfully that not. Some losses of course, but that's the cost of doing business.
---
tdf ?
---
That's the dumbest thing I've seen on here. Isk inflation is probably less than the USD inflation. In the last MER, more isk was destroyed than created.  This had to do with blackout but even still isk faucets are something CCP is very aware of and constantly taking actions to prevent hyper inflation.
---
Examples 3 and 8 would be of interest to me, what lovely noval ideas (my opinion).
---
Might be also worth to consider making entosis nodes like abyssals: a small arena that if you are in, you are not getting out easily. 
---
To be honest, Dominion sov wasn't as bad as citadels: today's sov system is essentially the worst of fozziesov *and* Dominion sov combined. You have to do fozziesov for TCU/ihubs, but those structures have little importance. You do Dominion sov to contest citadels, but there's a damage cap and tethering now, plus, instead of doing it once per system, you are in for dozens.
---
For once I'm being serious. The only way to cut into these large stockpiles is to build ships and the ships to blow up. It has never been cheaper to die in a glorious fire!
---
@Pod Liberation Authority IKR
---
same tbh
---
Truthfully pve in blackout was not worth it so most people just didn't do it. After so many nerfs to the yield increasing the risk threw the balance completely out of wack.
---
Also the bots would have adapted anyway
---
The Barrens
---
Increase warp Speed
---
Increase Agility
---
Bubble immunity 
---
Allow them to fit a command links like battle cruisers
---
Bring in a new Weapon assistance Command link that is restricted to battleships with 3 charges
---
\- Weapon range
---
\- Tracking/explosion velocity
---
\- DPS
---
Care to share?
---
When I do an insta warp bookmark , I always use a fast mwd ship and do from 5 to 10 bookmark, all at same distance from undock point, because as already said, the alignment when you undock is never the same. then I choose the most centered one of the cloud I realized, it's the one that will work the best
---
I want a mini-Carrier that can use 1 or 2 squadrons of light fighters and like and some Missile/Gun DPS... for like 1500 - 2000 dps...
---
because fuck it... why not...
---
Yes. Ganking is and has always been a form of PvP. The term "PvP" doesnt mean both players are equally matched.
---
You’re not wrong
---
I think they should have done it a little differently as to not make T1 meta0 modules completely worthless. Like with the MWD example making the enduring use less cap but have a bigger cap penalty vs the T1 and the restrained having less cap penalty but bigger cap usage. This would have made the T1 the most rounded module and not just completely irrelevant outside of making the T2 version.
---
*said the whining man*
---
I like.
---
On retiendra surtout le nom des traitres.
---
But it’s true so
---
&gt;\[citation needed\] All I did was PVP. That's how I made isk.
---
Press X for doubt meme goes here.
---
Show us your zkill so we can judge how elite you were.
---
the thing is that a citadel works differently from a POS, it offers station-like features, while a POS never could. It's been made to give the owner time to evacuate his own stuff and/or organize a defense of some sort.
---
Show me where we ever told any of our pilots to unsubscribe? Got a recording? Got a screenshot of a forum post? A blog post? 
---
No? That’s because they don’t exist, because we never did that. In fact, in our most recent meeting before the cyno patch, we even discussed our messaging to our members to discourage them from causing one another to quit the game. 
---
You’re full of shit.
---
That's some optimism right there.
---
Isn't nullsec supposed to be risky? 
---
While I agree that bots would adapt, how long has blackout been going that they haven't been able to? In order for a bot to have sufficient data to run a bot, they would need to have as many accounts subbed as there are gates in the system. That is a significant sum more that they have to grind in order to get the isk to keep those additional accounts active as well.
---
Even then it isn't even as foolproof as having local since people can dscan them down faster while being cloaked on the gate.
---
it´s their new anti PvP narrative. first it was blobsers. then kiters. than it was the 1337 PvPers. than it was Wormholers because hunters use them as a base of operations. never mind the fact that 95% of people actually living in wormholes don´t give a flying fuck about nullsec.
---
So... if you worked for CCP, which you don't, you would quit because your customer is mad at you because they don't like what you're doing to the product you're trying to sell?
---
Ok.........
---
You're right that I have no idea what it takes to make a game work. But I DO know what is going to keep my friends and me playing, just as I DO know what's going to make us quit.
---
Their job is to make a functioning game out of what WILL keep us playing.
---
Ah kk, his shuttle was probably just misaligned then.
---
i understand the need to reallocate resources, but I’ve struggled to enjoy Eve since it was removed. I LOVED the feeling of being a captain in a ship with a crew, and CQ helped ground that idea for me. It helped me with a sense of scale (something Eve does very badly) and without it Eve feels more depressed and lonely. Cosmetics are useless without it as well.
---
Good luck convincing these pvpers to have a fair 3v3. Maybe a 6v3 would get these crybabies happy.
---
The people
---
You lost?
---
You're not allowed to like mining here. That's one of the cardinal sins. It's almost as bad as being a nullbloc or being Stainguy.
---
Refait eyes.fr et essaye d'avoir les couilles de fight un grand garcon plutot :)
---
Yeah, also yor rorq red light and after blackout restriction to 1dq range does not exist, I a m sure ...
---
thank you, kind sir
---
reeeee, found  an ironic grr goons post here is a +1
---
Shit if i want to fight abyssal runners im gonna have to do a site myself and have a fair 1v1 in the specoal pvp room. I wanted easy ganks damnit.
---
albion online does - gvg or arena
---
that’s rich, so you instead of closing off you’re private section in wh space you leave it wide open for people to gank your nestor’s. you must have 0 back bone if you feel the need to lie about internet spaceships
---
lolol, nice
---
Yeah you want Nullsec to be risky but risk need to equal reward or else what's the point of doing it? People doing PVE are not doing it to make targets for hunters they are just trying to make isk for whatever reason but if they will loss more isk then gain they are just going to quit doing it.
---
Tout de suite les grands mots
---
Chaos era: Widow is now a railgun boat.
---
You can use your rorqual just fine. I have 2 and used them through the black out. Stop whining
---
Modern Picasso
---
I read this and couldnt believe this... am pretty disenchanted. I know Eve is rough but killing a Nyx for what the owner maybe ratted for Months? I mean wtf... Goons didnt give a fuck to lost supers, this happens and were more like "prey to the Whelpgods!"  and that every loss is good for Eve cause Content! ..... And now they kill a guys expensive ship he worked hard for cause he didnt follow orders. Pretty much 1337. Im really disappointed. I dont know every fact in this case of course but thats only from what i can say from my perspective.
---
Our battle ventures shall blot out the sun.
---
Idk what's more shit, your grammar and spelling, or your grasp on Eve
---
Lmao you link the one athanor you’ve killed in the past two or three weeks vs all the other structures of yours we have been decimating. But, I guess that’s what you have to do when you can’t actually fight someone who has equal numbers to yours.
---
So it's the new lazer hawks?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjTQqTGa3dQ
---
Cut the HAW Moros’ falloff by a third and you may as well delete HAW blasters from the game though.
---
Lol we really don’t honestly. Null is more of a side thing to do if it just happens to pop up in the chain if you are part of the traditional C5 entities.  Very few specialize in null static’s. 
---
We also don’t tend to horde our isk and have ships we never use unless it’s 3 to 1 odds of obliterating the other side. It’s all cards on the table for armor brawls.  So yeah we make a lot isk but an any given armor brawl that isk you made that day could go poof.
---
One of the best things you can do if you want to pvp with your guys and your skills is to start theorizing fits in Pyfa. See what's possible. Try to find the best hulls, compare similar options, compare what your skills allow to what's possible. 
---
You'll gain a lot of understanding about what you're up against and how to fight it. 5 guys can do a lot in pvp if you find the right fits and targets. Go try out your ideas, then come back and refine them after you see what happens. You have enough people not to need to go elsewhere, but it sounds like you need to learn how to craft your own plans for fleets and activities. Start teaching yourself to fish and gl out there :)
---
i do not agree....delete wcs and give evry ship in eve 10 warp core strenght...problem solved
---
So our changing our ratting/mining policy to tell our pilots that they must do so, from now on, within supercap range(which was announced publicly and is not a secret) is somehow evidence of, and equivalent to, us telling our members to unsubscribe?
---
Go back to lowsec idiot.
---
Ya it's on my desktop. I will when I get home.
---
Stukas are not really overpowered imo, there are some hard counters that will shred the stuka fleet (chemos?). I don't think they are overpowered but tbh i didn't fight many stuka fleets either, if i had to fight stukas on a daily basis I would maybe think differently. 
---
back to cynoes : There was a proposition i read and discussed here, quite interesting actually, capital hard cynoes with spool timer. 
---
Unusable for def fleets if the spool time is long enough (same timer as a cyno inhib), but quite useful if you need a hard cyno to place your fleet on a citadel (for as long as you don't get DD'ed right away, but that could happen with any hard cyno tbh). Needs a lot of thinking and balancing, but the idea seems interesting.
---
Change in Moderation... but your heart is in the right place...
---
I wish CCP would stop giving info about their game in a lore fashion. most of us do not care or read their bullshit. 
---
just tell it straight, "guys we still haven't fixed chat channels yet, we are trying but we have no idea why they break".
---
Just make them an active module. Doesn't matter what part of space a person is in; you shouldn't get the benefit of the module if you are autopiloting while AFK.
---
4
---
And you have no evidence to support either side, so you are also wrong.
---
says the snuff pilot
---
If your gamestyle is monkey see monkey do it may be the style that's invalid, but it's probably you.
---
He said the character was now in goonwaffe, goons hate it when people call characters "toons".  So if OP asks about his/her "toon" the other player is likely to ignore them.
---
With this i totally agree, you shouldn't fly what can't afford to lose and if you are going to, make sure to take the proper precautions to not lose that ship. Being aligned and making use of dscan to keep an eye on what is around you goes a long way in ensuring that you don't lose your ship to hunting parties.
---
If you cannot learn to take care of your ship in the region you find yourself in, then don't fly that ship or don't live in that region.
---
Got to be a krab to hate a retarded move by a company that doesn't understand their game or community, god you're such an intellectual
---
Lets just start with at low power it dies in 1 cycle... safety feature... need special permissions to remove fuel... anyone can add...
---
They only need 1 min and it can take someone 15-20 secs to get on comms alone. These Stuka fleets kill faces easily enough so sending a few in with no plan does not help either. If you don’t run a super umbrella then kindly stfu

&gt; yor
---
Ladies and gents. Your intellectual champion of the forums.
---
It appears blackout was intentionally open ended and they didn't know exactly what would happen. Now that it was rolled back, it seems the biggest result we see is a bot culling. Perhaps this was the intended purpose? I assume the bot problem is worse then we think.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ud-OUhyYauA
---
There's no evidence to support that.
---
interesting ideas!
---
&gt; Now that we confirmed that EVE should not be exclusively PVP
---
FTFY
---
If only there were some kind of central location players could get this information.
---
Well there's also the 'Delve minute' or something like that?
---
original eve is dead post 5/7
---
When was this decided? Because Age of Chaos hampered PvP, cutting back should get people back out in space again for us to pew pew.
---
Yeah, jt was ccl claiming they were going to "rebalance eve, one module at a time"
---
Hmm....

Wormholer crying about nullsec blackout.

Nothing new in New Eden.
---
It might return, but not the same as it was implemented before.
---
The blackouts might be tied to structures, or environment.  They may be rolling blackouts which affect certain areas using RNG.  Lots of things can still happen.
---
Make warp core stabs modules reserved only for Industrial and ORE ships.
---
Ah yes, I too have to go 2 weeks back to find a few unfit structures to stroke my ego over. You did get the onlining one last night because it somehow wasn't on our timerboard - whoops.

 I can see how this is even numbers, you're saying the average skill level of your alliance is 1/2 to 1/3 of the average FE member, so you need 2-3x the people and multiple batphones to fight us with "even" numbers.  
---
GL little buddy. ;)

Duuuude. Don't screw his narrative with facts. He worked very hard to post all of this.
---
Sitting in the Camal keep, to scared to take a fight with CVA :P
---
I hate how beautiful this is.
---
I've been familiar with some real world botting operations, but not in eve. We're talking about RMT business. That is, actually real money is involved. It's not something you shut down or start back up on a whim.
---
If you really think that:
---
1. They shut down operations because of the blackout
---
2. After shutting down, they would come back a day after blackout ends
---
You are seriously deluded and ignorant of the subject.
---
I normally have a lot of respect for Unspoken, and hope that you're only flairbaiting. 
---
Anyway, I hope that your post helped you work through some of your personal issues.

Everyone wants to be the 1%.

Great fight with you the [BAG8]. And fun fight against you AFK. 10/10 let's do it again ;)
---
Putain jetais a la cita et j'avais aucune idée de si le  neut etait efficace !
---
Then it depends more on the fleet/corp doctrine etc? It won't work like incusions, with fleet invites for logis (so solo players with logi helps random fleets for share in spoils)?
---
Why sarcasm, Marshal is expansive and I am risk averse dropper :honk:
---
You can lock both ships. I've tried it with my own alts.
---
Alternatively, just remove them from the game.
---
Like i know but people just fly in kite stuff as they are afraid of loses.       
---
Me a man, fit blasters and go face to face with your enemy.
---
We were so freakin' lucky. The second one had a such weird behavior - he was gating with us till that point where he just stopped. Prolly not paying attention, prolly his connection went down etc
---
Ça allais plutôt bien pour être honnête j'avais tout allumé et ça tournais :)
---
I disagree. 
---
Sometimes putting a POS brings pression.
---
Attacking structures DO the eviction !
---
Better reward for less risk.
---
Because for me stabs are fine if you want to fit them on industrial ships, but totally broken if you can do the same for combat ones.
---
haha, noooo .. definitely not all people in this game are idiots ))
---
EVE has changed a lot since 2008, much more things to do and explore. The best way would be to open ingame "The Agency" (Alt+m) to find out about all of them.
---
Welcome back and fly safe! o7
---
Yeah. Long ago I was using an awesome strat with a falcon a vagabond and a stiletto. It netted me so many kills back then. Now everything is nerfed to oblivion.
---
Bon pour le coup c aussi lui qui a fait hidden, et on s'en sort pas mal. Comment va LZH ? On entend tellement plus parlé de vous qu'on s'attend a vous voir venir nous evict comme les autres mortvivants.

I don’t get it. What does dotlan have to do with no blackout.

Cloaking kind of defeats the d scan unless you get lucky or they're stupid. and people did stop flying ships in logging in that's why blackout ended.
---
You are generous here , the only skill member we have is Striker and it is merely because he have the power of anime behind him.
---
That's literally what we do, I don't really care if you believe me or not as it doesn't matter.
---
Some people crit their holes, some people don't. It's not perfect safety and it's nowhere near as safe as having a PANIC or cap umbrella.
---
Limit it to 1 per ship.
---
Change the bonus to prevent scams shutting off mwds.
---
Actually, that sounds trading 1 retarded problem for another. Never mind.
---
entosis will always be shit because it requires a critical mass of players to spread out and cover multiple systems. if you want to be a small entity and only hold 1-2 systems, you still have to have enough people to defend an entire constellation. 
---
entosis sounds great on paper, but its one more system that's designed to work better with more people in the game.
---
English is difficult for French people I hope you took it I to consideration :D
---
All for it, as long as disruptors get at least 5, and faction scrams get at least 10.
---
C'est parce que vous restez en C4 comme des debiles au lieu de monter en C5 comme les grands. Ca se cache toujours derrière l'excuse du "ya tr0 de n00bs che nou pr high class" ou ca a evolué?
---
Do we really need to make neuts even more essential?
---
You say they are pushing on your sov but you have 2 pockets and have been pushing for a third what entitles you to more sov than everyone else?
---
Target breakers are still in the game and untouched. Its only ECM because it was too strong before and now garbage. Gallente sensordisruption ist a better ecm now in my opinion. Just reduce lockrange to 1km and you are good to go
---
Do you have data that supports your hypothesis? Or are you just making assumptions?
---
Yeah you little shit, pray I don't turn up to fleets and start linking weeb shit in local or the end will be close for you I promise.
---
is there a reason asset safety can't be tied to your subscription? i.e. if you're unsubbed for more than a month, asset safety kicks in.
---
if the intent is to shield people from loss when they're on a break, make the mechanic do \*that\* instead of just blanket safety for everyone, all the time.
---
I thought you where a coalition, could t your mates help?
---
It's true but afaik, they came to see our caps. I hope we didn't disapoint them
---
A lovely example of this is now that they turned blackout off, they somehow introduced a bug where abyssal traces werent showing up on dscan.
---
Like...How?
---
How the fuck to they introduce these bugs in disconnected systems? Programmers like to use the term "spaghetti code" but Jesus H Bob, EVE is like the most literal case ive ever heard of. Do they somehow have interactions between local *chat* and the window used for *scanning objects in space?*
---
&gt; Isk inflation is probably less than the USD inflation
---
Overall EVE CPI has fallen in the past 10 years. PLEX being the huge exeception.
---
Eve is a space game. Acccording to Hilmar it is supposedly THE space game. But, alas, it is a space game almost rid of astronomical events.
---
My idea is to make such events content drivers. As cosmological events they should be a beautiful spectacle, so even though the PvE or PvP content is of no interest, they may cause players to make the journey just to watch.
---
Would also be great for new players to witness such events, I guess, perhaps sowing an interest in the game for its sheer beauty...
---
It would be good if chat worked before they blacked it out
---
this is how it was in the POS days too... you could have an unfueled stick anchored out there, but it had no shield, no reinforcement, it just died when you poked it.
---
I have no idea why they abandoned all the good design that went into PoS. I can only assume that they lost the institutional memory about why they did things the way they did because of dev attrition
---
What about the 5,000 eve is dying posts with link to player numbers? There's plenty of evidence to support that. Why else would they go back to local? To keep the crabs subbed. There were hundreds of posts about unsubbing 20 accounts. A corp member of mine said he dropped from like 30 accounts down to 6 because of blackout. There's plenty of evidence. Simply posting "there's no evidence" is not a valid argument.
---
There are still viable uses for the T1 modules since you can mass build them from scratch, making them fine for throwaway handout ships for newbies and the like.
---
Get rekt!
---
Hahahahaha. Aweeome.
---
It is most obvious, as honestly i am never angry when a tackled industrial ship warps off while i have it pointed ... but when i see this T3C warping off ... honestly i want to go and hurt someone.
---
Quand tu galères à sortit 20 toons en fleet car t'as 1/5 des mecs qui sait/peut multiboxer plus qu'un main et le scout, le C5 ça devient tendax
---
Well tried everything and still no reply, the adventure continues
---
Buddy, nobody should be "yelling at you". Whether you're new or a veteran.
---
"You" don't need reprocessing skills, your miners do, to unlock mining crystals improve their output, they don't do anything for the Orca. 
---
You also don't need to refine anything you mine, if you prefer to just mine and don't get bogged down in the logistics and depth of the subsequent industry steps (refining, reactions, manufacturing, invention etc.), just don't do it and sell the ore outright.
---
I've seen some of your other comments and it sounds quite absurd. There are NO reasonable T1 fits for subcapitals that take a full year to train. 
---
~3 months trains all fitting and support skills for ships, and any given T1 subcapital ship can be flown in a few days, and with reasonable related skills in a couple of weeks.
---
Drop me a line if you need any help with ships, fitting, or any other starting player stuff.
---
You need those recon pilots.       
---
Like i play in eve again when this Blackout nonsense is gone and while late i am in the process of building myself 50 recons ... for start.
---
We only hold our two pockets, and don't plan on expanding further since we don't have full utilization of the space we have now.  
---
   
---
We're casually lighting no visual's sov on fire because they're nominally part of the big blue blob(they don't really do much TBH) we've been fighting and as such don't really have a future in Vale.  
---
Scum are alts / don't do anything to make us think they're good neighbors. They can either prove us wrong or rent. Up to them.   
---
I'm not entirely sure what 3rd pocket you think we're taking, but it probably has reference to the above. :)

Polarized Blaster Vindicator with Logi Support?
---
Engagement is refreshed each time you shoot.      
---
Just get enough dps and don't let him dock.
---
True, but that's anecdotal. We don't know how many of the player count drop was paid or unpaid, bots or players. They could've gone back on local because it was meant to be temporary and they accomplished their goals.
---
Ah yes the nullsec assumption per usual
---

Oui on voit bien ta connaissance la commu franco  en general et en wh en particulier.

You can trade those skins between accounts or they are bound to account you redeem them?

I too live my life feeling entitled to everything
---
I don't know theres quite a few extremely risk averse nanoboys and gankers who tag themselves as pvpers for some reason.
---
We're only blue to two groups - divinity and echo out of necessity. Our 3 total groups can't match the 8+ and counting that the big blue blob keeps bringing. None of us are that big, even combined. Earlier we had even numbers, but they've just kept begging more and more people for bodies, as you can see, they don't like even fights or losing. ;)
---
Noone uses VNIs, it's all about the Myrm and Domi meta
---
Its a bug you troll
---
Good question, but I got the email at work. They're listed on the market, so I expect that you're able to sell them like anything else.
---
Got the e-mail this morning.
---
something something phased generation array extron and went for 4-5 mil, my eyes lit up whenever it dropped
---
You are wrong.      
---
Chat/fleet channels where most reliable things you had in eve.      
---
Those 2 things always worked ... until CCP decided to pull them and host them on separate server.
---
j'arrive jamais à comprendre quand des mecs se croient permis de critiquer nos choix de jeu/gestion de corpo.   
---
mais qu'est de que ça peux bien vous foutre à la fin qu'on vive en C4 ou ailleurs? vous êtes pas nos babysitteurs que je sache?
---
I was helping a new bro out in chat, he been playing for a few weeks, undocked at jita 4 moon 4 with his shiney new astero with that fresh new car smell, got blapped by station campers........ never logged back in  yet
---
Good to know
---
Emails going out now
---
You could also use linux and never worry about system issues.
---
Wow.
---
Increase warp speed is the first and largest problem. If that doesn't do enough (it won't), then increase tank. If that still doesn't work, then nerf medium guns so they can't do reliable 400 dps at mid-ranges.
---
Antimatter only
---
Can I ask why you're so attached to this character? No hate, just curious why you're putting in this much effort.
---
Hi, GSF diplo here. Please don't contact me as you go about your quest. If that character was that important, you shouldn't have sold it.
---
what a nice wolf
---
Someone should do a version of this about The Judge and GigX. xD
---
Sounds like you roamed into the wrong space if you got touched in your private parts by 824342342 capitals just because an evil epithal of doom hunted you down to exterminate you without any reason.
---
This is a troll right?
---
You can't really be that entitled.
---
Finally
---
This is going to be a popular post
---
Wave tested, you can lock ANY target that has you jammed.
---
...And then there was the Vault 66 which was primarily focused on a social experiments on a group of \*\*special\*\* indivuduals...
---
you are thinking of the Scorp/ Scorp navy or Rattle, the widow is pretty glass (as are all blops)
---
Y a rien du tout derriere mdr c'est juste dur de respecter quelqu'un qui roll a chaque fois qu'il se connecte avec nous, et qu'il fait ca MEME apres avoir promis de donner un fight. Ca a zéro couilles alors que en EUTZ literalement on bouffe de la merde contre n'importe qui. Et maintenant y a 30+ de hidden sur les BR et une dizaine de caps mais ca dit toujours que ca galère en C5... Mdr
---
&gt; You piss off a pvp guy and his 2 Loki’s toons go inactive, it doesn’t have the same impact
---
It does. It just takes longer. Ask the guys in Serenity.
---
You want to blow up an XLASB Orca with a single ship in 4-5 minutes?
---
I'm sorry but I don't think it will happen.
---
Assume he has 500K EHP. You thus have to do 100k damage per minute, or 1666 DPS.
---
And "Max tank" can mean a number of things...if he has more than T2 modules and overheats hardeners, you're looking at way over 500k EHP.
---
Problem is, even if you somehow get 1666 DPS and his tank is on the lower end, that doesn't take into account the XLASB which is pretty insane.
---
" It's like you have no clue what it takes to make a game work, and I've done the math to know that these guys aren't making anywhere close to Facebook or Google money."
---
Put your money where your mouth is... where is your 15 + year old game hot shot?
---
The dangers of null is very much like the dangers of taking a shit in perfect vacuum... it never happens because of local intel.
---
Posts as a coalition, complains that one fight he can’t even be bothered to link is SOP when at least the linked evidence proves otherwise. :thinking:
---
You can trade them.
---
If you think that is anyway a good thing you are insane. Why would giving local to the largest groups and cutting it for the smaller groups in anyway be good for the game?
---
The only half measure that makes any sense is delayed local 1-2min.
---
So if you want to rat/mine in null as a new player now under your rules the outlay is at minimum: 
---
2 Omega characters, 1 injected into a recon cyno fit, the isk to have spare cynos ships and 1 ratter/miner.
---
All this required to start mining or ratting for newbros in null.
---
Meanwhile his opposite number to fly in a bomber fleet needs needs a 100 mill fit bomber.
---
Yepp and look where that took us. People like OP and a nullsec filled with inept and dependend krabs with low engagement levels towards the game that will quit when they´re slightly inconvenienced.
---
pvp fit leshak with heavy drones
---
It’s fine. I regularly batphone Novac and cones to my structure bashes. Oh wait no I don’t. I keep it to the Tribute bois (NSH, US, and Rote)
---
They probably won't do another Blackout. CCP just admitted the whiny cry babies have them by the balls. Too many people jumped ship because they couldn't mine and rat in peace. And CCP can't afford to lose all that revenue.
---
Well, the sheer number of people logging in can be taken from eve-offline. Also there was a quite in-depth-analysis of playercount based on these stats by jestertrek (factoring in f.e. the timespan of Alpha introduction, where player count rose, exactly for the timespan you need to hit SP-cap with an Alpha, just to plummet into oblivion right after). On the other thing you can call me out for an educated guess, but denying it won't make you look smart as my educated guess is based on ingame facts and statistics and simple logic. 
---
If you kill the playstyle of people casually running 1-4 accounts (subbed with CC not PLEX) to PvP and implement a limitless scaleable Maxxed-PvE-Solution as well as bugged SP-Farming-Mechanics, one should not wonder that lowsec content creator X with 3 or 4 accounts unsubs, and the casual HiSec-L4-Bling-Missionrunner that got pushed into Nullsec because Goon Gank Squads simultaneously made Hisec less secure while Citadels and Rorqual-Minerals made Nullsec the safest place in game, starts to PLEX-sub and inject something in between 3-50 Rorquals.
---
Before F2P/Injectors CCP released a stat at a fanfest (idk if 2014 or 2015) that said the avg. Accounts-per-Player is 1.5 accounts. Factoring in that the players that quit in thousands after Citadels and Lifeblood (proven by eve-offline and just by checking logged in accounts on Saturday 1800-2000 ET /strongest timeslot all times) are mostly people subbing 1-4 accounts with CC to not being forced to play EVEs weakest and worst part - PvE - just to keep up sub, and the people subbing additional accounts usually did this to scale up PvE income to PLEX all their accounts, you can only come to the conclusion that the stat accounts per player has increased.
---
Next logical step, when logged in accounts in Saturday EU prime is sinking from at least 55k in 2015/16 before Citadels to barely 30k at the end of 2018 (far before blackout) while simultaneously the accounts per player are increasing, what does that tell you ?
---
You can also do exploration in a very cheap T1 ship like a Heron. You'll lose it a lot, but if your skills are low or you're an alpha, one good haul will pay for it many, many times over and you can afford to make mistakes or just have the bad luck to run into hunters.
---
Probably because he sounds as retarded as you.
---
I like a guy who both says people who encourage others to quit are cancer, and then also says other people should quit.  Then claims I'm the toxin.  Enjoy candy crush you little bitch.  
---
Also, although I doubt I have a need for a failfit highsec mining barge, can I have your stuff?
---
Doubt it will happen with big daddy PA pulling the strings
---
Je sais pas chacune de tes interventions est plustot agressive pour un gars qui s'en fou. 
---
On choisit nos fights plustot que de les subir.  
---
Mais je ne comprend pas a quel moment la frustrations des ElItEs pVp arrive ? Parce quon fait les choses de manieres differentes ? Genre on "doit" faire les choses selon certaines regles definies par des corpos avec lesquelles on a rien a voir ? 
---
Je sens beaucoup de frustration de la part d'entités qui n'arrivent pas a nous avoir en suivant leurs regles et se cache derriere notre suposé lacheté pour evacuer leur frustration de se faire spank par des caves comme nous.
---
Yeah but if you are spit out away from the central line going out from the citadel, you have to turn a smaller angle to face a point that is further away. The closer the bookmark the more you have to turn to face it.
---
Meanwhile a crab somewhere resubs 30 accounts LMAO
---
Ever since the warp speed changes, way back in 2015 or whenever that was I can't remember, the meta has shifted more and more to quick response everywhere. Feroxes also eat shit to bombers, but they are used literally everywhere. Same for moas, and snail moas are the main cheap cruiser doctrine. It's ALL about the speed, getting to the fight asap and dictating the engagement range. Have you flown with a baltec fleet? It can take upwards of an hour to do 15 jumps, often more. The same distance is less than 30 minutes in a ferox fleet, even less in HACs. Even if you give battleships superb on-grid mobility, they still won't be able to get to the grid before the enemy have completed their objective(in sov warfare) or the hostile gang has pulled range/disengaged/left system. Throughout the entirety of the northern war last year, I might have seen 4 pings for megathrons, as opposed to literally hundreds of BC and down fleets, and it's no coincidence that every time everyone on comms was groaning "are we there yet", both on the way there and on the way back.
---
*cries in Zealot*
---
And get absolutely murdered by a few capital alts. Swell.
---
&gt; supers can't enter anomalies and combat signatures 
---
This will piss off both PvE and PvP players, because the only way to do that is an acceleration gate.
---
&gt;  NPE, tutorials and UI. It's something deeper.
---
&gt; "why would i bother with a bunch of people i have no chance of competing against, unless joining them and letting them shape the way i play the game?"
---
Catering to this sort of complaint is how we ended up with injectors. Making top level content more accessible to the new guys led to day one supers and rorqs.
---
You shouldn't expect to compete against a guy in the game for ten years on your first day. expecting to make an impact on the game world with a first day character is an unrealistic expectation in any game. Recruiters should focus on letting new players know it does take time and experience to get better, and not just in Eve (but especially in Eve).
---
So don't get scrammed?  If you fly a JF and get scrammed, you did something wrong.  They're just about the safest ships in the game when flown right.
---
Disappeared.... The fundamental joy of blackout, everyone disappeared over night and you never really knew who was there or not....
---
Blue loot has already been nerfed by the taxes increase :p
---
Nice shot.

So...
---
* You want them to extract skills and give you skill injector.  
---
* Your flair says skill urself.
---
Whaaattt?
---
Those are recent npc kills numbers. A few days ago it was altmost all empty (because krabs stopped farming, all afraid of no local)
---
Make them affect DPS like polarized weapons affect resist profiles.  Fit a stab?  No DPS.  Want to shoot rats?  Don't fit a stab.  That will limit their use to haulers, miners, PVE drone boats.
---
Yeah of course t1 work, the advantage of the astero are to warp cloacked, be instawarp with 2 warp core stabilizers if I remember correctly.
---
I could have also add to go/come back from null , using wh is safer than the usual ns/ls system that are often camped
---
Weird isnt it? Sometimes I stop and think what exactly is the point of this anyway? I'm space rich to the point where I don't even care to loot a titan or super kill. My killboard is green like what am I doing here 
---
What needs to happen is all of eve including wormholers, band together and break goons down. I think everyone would enjoy that and we would see 30, 40, maybe 50k people online when they hear about entire Eve joined up in a coalition like that.
---
It will be tough boring months of fighting but people will meet friends and empires will build up in the face of a common game destroying enemy.
---
I mean, you can get a bling fit Rattlesnake to around 1900-2100 dps without heat with a bling clone. So, it's possible!
---
While true there. every other system requires that same critical mass if not more. to engage a single point battle against what will always be superior numbers or size..
---
While its not perfect. and in alot of cases. kinda shit. entosis is FAR better for smaller entities, but only IF you want kills as an attacker. or are already the defender.
---
its one big and really only benefit. was limiting or otherwise hindering capital involvement. (not to say it removed it entirely. but it was MUCH diminished compared to dominion before or citadels after)
---
What about burst jammers?
---
Railgun bonused boat with three turret slots, 3 missile launcher slots, 15m3 drone bay.
---
About the blue loot, you are comparing blackout numbers in null, the regular numbers for known space were more to the tune of \~60T (70T in Feb, 70T in Mar, 57T in Apr, 55T in Jun). So the comparison would be 12T to 60T.
---
I'm not saying blue loot is OK, it is not. But if you want to compare and state it is "totally out of balance", please use the right numbers.
---
I'm not saying I dislike this idea, but how about set turret limit and drone bandwidth to zero if you mount one.
---
nah. not really a fan of the arena idea.
---
100% agree on the rest tho. the current system is literally the worst of both worlds..
---
meanwhile citadels got the BEST of both POS and stations. with none of the negatives or limitations.
---
Oh, zkill zombie. Legit discussion point. Can’t talk about things unless you have the risk adverse numbers to take a fight. Good narrative yourself, for your supposed “we’re also here for good fites.”
---
Sorry dad ):
---
Il don't think it's an issue when you rat in a super or mine in a blob of rorqs due to the shitton of isk the Guy is making. A carrier getting caught by a stuka fleet has good chances to die whether there's a cyno or not no?
---
So bring dreads of your own. Blow up all the ships. Hiding in station is dumb. Will you die? Yes! That is the point. Take as many of them with you when you do.
---
EVE is like an ecological system. there need to be feedback systems to maintain a healthy balance over time. when the checks and balances are eliminated, there is usually explosive growth, up until the point where the system collapses. CCP have a role as a sort of gamekeeper, making sure that these checks and balances exist and are effective. left to their own devices, players wont shake the balance problems out, they will exploit them until the ecological system as a whole crumbles.
---
Dunking on waffles roaming gangs gets you called a “pussy” in local. Rewarding for me. Sometimes I’m the one getting dunked though. My MWD didn’t heat the other day and a trig destroyer zapped me.
---
Result would be in the same direction, so i would be ok with it.
---
CCP can easily adjust the BOM for caps/Supers/Carriers to decouple them from the cost of anything else in the game.
---
Make capital components cost 10 times as many highends and 1/3rd as much lowends. There, capital cost is not inversely proportional to subcap costs, since producing high ends for capitals generates a ton of low ends that comprise most of a subcap BOM.
---
The cyno changes are pretty over the top for many people and I'm not talking about people who drop titans on nanogangs. It's made JF logistics, and even personal logistics with your own capitals, the most boring part of the game, into the most boring and most risky and expensive activity in the game.
---
I won't touch my JF anymore.
---
Are we already to the bargaining stage?

Never roamed through delve maybe? Even tackling a frigate could lead to a capital drop.
---
Don’t break up your Corp. Try joining bombers bar fleets until you learn the ropes. Or, just throw yourselves out there with a few cheap fits and see what happens. You have to fail to learn. 
---
Good luck!
---
Well sure, but this is not about removing all blue loot but to reduce generation of it in C5 and C6 space.         
---
If we go from 12T to 6T it will be still a lot but in acceptable levels.      
---
Currently WH space is making more ISK than whole imperium ratting in supers and titans.          
---
Like how often you see people arguing that goons make to much ISK ?            
---
Now imagine yourself making even more with much, much less people.
---
I wasn’t on or the fc of that fleet. :smile:

Ah, good old Vale, that no one ever wants apart from very few groups of people that seem to always gravitate to there inbetween massive wars between neighbouring coalitions sweeping the region...
---
I hope this is one of those posts where you say add NPC pockets to every nullsec region
---
yeah , walking in stations needs to happen first and then a proper PC version of it.
---
Some of us want actual good fights to test us.  I'd much rather take a 10 man gang to go fight outnumbered, unfortunately there’s a large majority that don’t want to play this way.  
---
Gotta find shit to do, so we gank what’s we’ve been left with instead.
---
Then they wouldn't be usable since they self tackle.
---
umm, skill injectors? if you already have the skills and are in a nullblock then ask on their respective discord who builds rorquals or has any fitted ones for sale
---
Be careful, your hired mercs can also turn against you and fuck your shit up. Just sayin
---
Correction, they're actually probably having more fun at low sp.
---
Stukas are cheap, easy to fly, easily extracted, hard to hit, have NO counter since Kiki's were added to the mix (Chemos eat ass against even a handfull of Kiki's nevermind the 9-12 you see with most fleets minimum. Unless you are trying to promote the Chemosh's as an anti Stukkka fleet faction dread in which case you are just a fucking moron.) They can attack everything from frigates up to Supers with no fitting change.
---
And the worst part is unless the FC makes a huge mistake 90% of the fleet is guaranteed to make it home. With the majority lost probably using a drifter wormhole.
---
As for Cyno's Im actualy for the removal of Cyno's from Caps. If you can fly a cap, you can afford a Recon. But removing it as a whole means people you cant fly caps but might be in need of a cyno are shit out of luck. CCP have discussed Remopving Cynos from caps and only allowing Sub caps to have spool up cynos based on ship size before (Frigates and Destroyers get a fast spool up but Fuck all tank, cruisers have a balanced time vs tank, anything above that the spool increases based on size with Command Ships, Command destroyers and Flag Ships having bonuses to the cynos spool timer as they are considered a fleet ship.)  and got a very positive feedback from everyone so why they decided to go "LoL fuck your cyno"  is just beyond me.
---
Some stations fire you out with a slight variation of angle. Test your BMs multiple times if youre not certain they are solid.  Also, 160km is still going to be in range of some sniping setups.  For a high value cargo transfer, i wouldnt recommend any thing less than 1200-1300km.  Dont use 1000km.  Too many people do and the odds are that your pursuer might too.
---
Personally, when i used to be a dirtbag wardeccer haunting a station i would set up bms every 150km from the undock all the way out to 1500km or so. More often than not i could land pretty close to an intended target even if they had instas. Mostly while flying a ceptor to close the distance asap.

Yes damn those dirty crabs and their refusal to be fodder. CCP is at fault for introducing Blackout without any reason to continue playing in that kind of environment. The PvE in Eve isn't compelling or rewarding enough to keep people playing if they are going to die to a cloaked ship that they cannot see on D-scan. At least when the crab can see you coming they will still undock because if they get caught they can blame themselves.
---
Basically if we get another Blackout cloaks need a huge nerf. Players should be able to tell you are there, just not in what.
---
That is a lot of words to say you are guessing at the cause of the drop in players.
---
If there's another blackout it will end with the servers being unplugged.
---
But issue is not in capital build costs but rorqual swarms generating to much materials.    
---
Simply saying it differently.           
---
Rorquals generate so much materials that marked already crashed and the only thing that keept it semi normal were people building thousands of supers and titans. 
---
But this is going away now as you cannot sell titans any more and price is falling.            
---
Soon material market will crash and CCP cannot allow this to happen as all those higsec miners/ mission runners and industrialist will be badly affected without any hope for recovery as long as Rorquals are mining.
---
The Ditanian Fleet, an ancient incursion group that's been running incursions since week 1. I knew they became elitist jerks at some point, but I'll admit I didn't expect them to still exist.
---
Thats a low effort take to say you don#t have anything to prove me wrong ...
---
This would be true, but with how it looks like CCP implemented their blackout, every user was still doing the same reconnects as before, just weren't being shown all the data until it was needed (someone talked in local, chat broke)
---
What about adding a "decay" timer to low power citadels to address the citadel spam? Lets say a 5-10% hull decay per day of low power state depending on structure size...
---
I was going to say that but then i remembered CCP rebalanced the VNI.  At least sometimes they can balance well.
---
&gt; fuel can be dropped off the same way stuff is dropped off now without docking. impossible? not even fucking hard. 
---
You're literally objectively wrong in every possible way and appear to be completely unwilling to do any research or learn how the game works. You can't take control of a structure without being docked, which is what is required to touch any of its fitting as well as be able to see/access the fuel bay. Your suggestion would require some new mechanics where the player is somehow in control of two ships in space at once, and then stating it's "not even fucking hard".
---
&gt;yea no shit sherlock, that is the fucking point. to break the balance right now that exists because of endless resources that allow for endless spam of stuctures. 
---
If you're happy to break things outside of null to fix things in null, you should just withhold suggestions at all since they'll never be helpful to the overall game. You don't fix things by breaking more things somewhere else.
---
just no
---
I'll trade you my stack of diamonds for it. What do you say?
---
Are you blind? Or dumb? Or both?
---
Ok, so here is what you gotta do, aside from learning about paragraphs.
---
Realize that if nobody in your group is experienced in pvp, then you have no reason to expect to do well at it. You say yourself you mostly do highsec stuff and are somewhat casual in your pvp endeavors. Well a lot of people are not casual when it comes to pvp, not by a long shot. I'm not saying you shouldn't try, I'm saying you should lower your expectations. Nobody in the game is under any obligation to give you a fair fight at all. They can and will use all of the advantages they can, which makes perfect sense, why play to lose? 
---
If you choose to stay in your particular corp because of friends and family that's great, I've done that for almost a decade, it can be worth it. But you have to understand that by doing so you may be giving up a potentially easier path forward with larger or more established groups. If you're gonna be small you need to specialize in one thing. If you just run around doing random stuff you're gonna be pretty bad at all of it. For example you mention spending most of your time doing PVE yet you have no money for ships??? What are you accomplishing? 
---
As far as taking your guys out on a fun roam, I'm not sure where you're being told you need ships that take a year to train into but that is incorrect. A group of long range destroyers like talwar, beam coercers, cormorants, or others can score plenty of kills in hulls that cost less than 10 million fully fit. A tip though, one that may be disputed by others a bit but whatever...skip lowsec and go to 0.0 space. Maybe find a wormhole to deep nullsec. The thing about lowsec is, most of it is dead, the parts that aren't dead have competent groups staged there and none of them are doing random PVE. The other part of lowsec is faction warfare which can be great for new players and corps but has special rules related to gates and fits that are optimized specifically for faction warfare. In nullsec you'll have potential to die in bubbles but so what? You're likely to die wherever you go, wouldn't it be nice to kill something first? 
---
The absolute most important thing is to make sure you're having a good time. You can be shit at the game and if you're laughing about it with close friends you'll get there eventually. 
---
This is older but listen to how much fun we are having doing blops stuff, our coms are sloppy as fuck but we are loving it the whole time:

Null has other sources of wealth like expensive modules, ship blueprints and valuable ore. WH other source would be WH gas. If you consider that, and non-blackout numbers for null, they are pretty much on par. But in my opinion, both WH and NS should be reduced by 1/2 or 1/3. Too much WH wealth leads to people multiboxing 5 or more accounts and in my opinion that is bad for the game. I wish you could run only one instance of the game.
---
&gt; sold it           
---
More likely RMT out it i guess. 
---
Like do you sell 'char' before going away from the game.
---
dont know why this guy is downvoted, he got it SPOT ON! CCP has no intention of making managing structures easy in any sort of way and even the most basic thing like chat has been fucked over since the change from something stable to a complete shitshow...
---
Ecm is still cancer for entosis. You can lock the frig but it still kills your entosis cycle.
---
They look any good?
---
Sure thing, but it doesn't beat the XLASB on top of the tank. I doubt any subcap can beat an Orca tank 1 for 1 while it has charges. Certainly not in the short time period OP is describing.
---
Technically, you are correct! The best kind of correct! :D
---
Also, should get an extra low at the cost of 1 mid to get the most dps out of those 3 guns. Of course you'd need to nerf the agility and speed so it wouldn't be too good with that sick 900 m/s speed in case someone fits it with two nanofibers.
---
I'd love to but I don't have the time or the spare accounts to seed dreadbombs all over nullsec. I also don't think that every small fight should escalate up to capital ships right away, it kind of does a disservice to the hundreds of different subcap ships in the game.
---
They managed to puss off both the krabs and the people who hate the krabs, classic CCP.
---
Idk what's more shit, your lack of understanding that English is not everyone's native language, or your attitude towards people who actually have fun
---
You miss a fact: loot generated in wormholes is not necessarily generated by wh inhibitants. Everyone can daytrip into whs. It's like saying every exploration loot made in null is made by nullseccers. Yet even this sub recommends every newbro to do null explo.
---
I'm also trying to build a spreadsheet for different purposes, and this guide has been helpful. Have a look  [https://wiki.zansha.space/index.php/SSO\_Authentication\_in\_Microsoft\_Power\_Query](https://wiki.zansha.space/index.php/SSO_Authentication_in_Microsoft_Power_Query)
---
You know there was less game destroying ways to do that? Lower the isk rewards and drops from sites. Lower the amount of amount of ore spawning in null. 
---
Hey presto, your isk faucet is lowered without CCP loosing people from their dollar faucet.
---
You know what I see a lot of? 
---
Tengus and lokis - cloaked and nullified
---
Interceptors - all nullified version, zero combat ceptors
---
Command destroyers - because MJD means escape
---
Recons - not as often, but always force recon
---
Bombers - these are literally everywhere. 
---
Nano - garmurs and orthrus because ye I can run away
---
T1 cruiser gangs - caracals ospreys exequror augurors scythe 
---
I don't see any guys flying in solo sleipnirs or nightmares or barghests or vagabonds or anything made to take a 1vs1 or 1vs5 fight and win. Which is all fine I have setups to counter them and moon walk out with a few nano kills because they can't enter warp before they die to 4 ships perfectly tracking their nano trash out to 230km
---
Anyway It's shit that carries little to no risk of engagement. 90% sounds accurate to me for nullsec roamers
---
You also have the same valuable ore in WH space.       
---
Just "tower" the moons and start mining.                 
---
While there is no valuable goo at the same time WH have T3 mats.        
---
People forget that all materials for those T3 destroyers and cruisers is coming from WH space.                 
---
Same for ships BPC.           
---
All T3 cruiser and destroyer 'bpc' runs can be found only in WH space. 
---
WH space and K space is different but you cannot say that WH space is 'more poor'.           
---
There are huge differences between both, most of them lead to reduced population in WH space, yet even if reduced it generates a shitload of isk.         
---
I don't care about how much 'gases' are worth or all other stuff.        
---
ISK generation need to be reduced including WH space and nullsec.
---
yeah, a wing of nano smartbomb chemosh seems a pretty damn good alternative xD (do i need to add /s ?)
---
Tbh last time i fought a stuka fleet it was before kiki's were a thing, chemos were a pretty good counter but i have no hard time to believe they'll get erased by kiki's in the current meta. Maybe the problem isn't the whole concept of stuka fleet in itself but the olol destroyers with perfect tracking and insane DPS?
---
As for cynos, i don't know either, there are countless variants to this cyno nerf but CCP chose the option that didn't need too much thinking i guess.
---
Except rarely anyone uses officer mods, and even then its either an AT flagship (oops) or a super.
---
He talked to TDF. I've seen their fits. He's not joking, that shit is damn ridiculous.
---
If you want to you can join a coalition like SiCo. We offer to integrate your entire corp into our coalition, and then offer access to our services, like newbro pvp fleets, dedicated channels for fits etc, and also some more advanced fleets. All, and I repeat, ALL content is optional, you do what you want. No CTA's no defending no nothing, except if you really want to. And no splitting up of your corp, its all just additional services that will be offered to you, while the corp and its internal comms/doings stay the same.
---
Le double static c'est pas pour les tafioles. Quand on voit la facilité avec laquell n'importe qui qui sait prober rentre 50 leshak chez nous on peut se poser la question de la pertinence de l'argument.  
---
C'est plus facile à attaquer qu'un C5, plus difficile à prendre tant qu'on a des caps et pas les assaillants, mais ça ne rend pas nos assets plus safe et nous ne comptons pas là dessus.
---
A panther, sin, and redeemer also have those benefits and are better is pretty much every other way.
---
WH people daily trip to K space also for PVE.          
---
WH is source of blue loot that is out of whack and this source need to be reduced, same for isk generated in supers and titans.             
---
Sorry but i don't buy "my isk faucet is ok"
---
If he was TAPI you'd help
---
I nearly got flair baited and said  'hahaha RIP fof ratting"
---
Yeah that's quite the achievement
---
I know about those fits, and yeah it's not for new players. I'm a bit more concerned about the attitude they are facing but with only word of mouth about it...meh
---
Didn't think about alphas though, that is gonna be a problem. But still, T1 stuff should be within reach for them and I'm sure that if they carry out their business in a positive or supportive environment, they'll make it work.
---
&gt; This is what Eve has needed since the start, it has always been the weak point of the game. Better PvE does not mean less PvP, just the opposite. Good PvE is the path to putting the game back on a trajectory of growth. Good PvE means more targets in space. It means more for people to do when not PvPing.
---
I always thought the game needed a middle sec to ease players out of high sec. Gate camps and not even the illusion of safety is a big cock block for a lot of people. Concord response on gates and stations would shift over pvp content to hunting missioners and miners down rather than gate camps. Better pve for pvers as they get more rewards and opportunities due to taking on higher risk and thus more pvp opportunities for hunters.
---
Carebears would get to learn dscanning, scouts and local etc which would help move them into low.
---
&gt;not worth it
---
Buddy it's called *null-security* for a reason
---
IDK buddy, I'd think about finding some friends for this. You're going to spend over a bil to get a blingy fit to MAYBE kill the orca, and what if he brings friends instead?
---
I don't think it can be done easily. The guy might also be doing that on purpose to bait people.
---
Provided that they can prevent him from warping or gating, once he engages it doesn't matter how long it takes. He was safe to fire while the target had a timer.
---
iirc the assumption is that delve represents the theoretical maximum output since it has the highest output.
---
ship scanner reveals no  scram/disruptor.
---
Mate you sound like a proper grief farmer LMAO
---
Welcome the local grammar nazi
---
eve classic?
---
If you can harness the true power of anime you'd rule all of Eve.
---
High isnt the “tutorial area” that would be the newbie systems and i never said i dont leave high sec i just said i live in it but dont worry i can tell you despise anyone that isnt good at pvp or tries to stay safe maybe even pve as a whole
---
It's a variation of the default Guristas skin. It's black with camouflage accents. They're listed on the market, so you can use the preview window to see them.
---
I can’t say for other regions, but in delve they explicitly told us we are not allowed to rat at all in any caps and threatened us with teamkilling if we did basically lol.
---
Yeah, Blackout really told us more about the average Eve player than about CCP.
---
Its always nice to see as a (very) adult person that adolescents think swear words make them look more impressive or even adult ...
---
I am not sure if you are blind, dumb, illiterate, or all of the above.
---
Thinking small. Galactic!
---
Ding ding ding. This guy has your answer OP. You don't need to kill it in 5 minutes you just need to start the engagement within 5 mintues and have enough DPS to eventually break his tank.
---
Your posts make me feel illiterate because they make no sense.
---
🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀
---
Number six: means wormholers only ever have 2 pods available. Would be great if we didn’t need superfluous structures so pods can be stored but that’s where we’re at.
---
Whatever it is, it is unsurprisingly sill better than your personality.
---
Look another person that can't spell
---
Yeah but the Orca can wait out its weapons timer and dock, that's why it needs to happen in that time window. Maybe it will fight him and prolong the time available for DPS.
---
I'm all for the guy going for it but the whole thing seems bad on paper to begin with.
---
&gt; wormhole safety bullshit
---
Hahahahaha
---
No, supers are safe enough as they are. Supers need to die more, not less
---
Heavy missiles lokis dont count tbh.
---
Krabs gonna Krab.
---
EVE should be whatever the players want it, as played against other players not wanting you to have it.
---
The difference is people like you want CCP to force people into not having a thing instead of stopping them from having it within the confines of the game as it's existed (semi) successfully for over a decade.
---
It is like that for me for a month. Bug was reported, but...
---
I gave up hunting abyssal krabs anyway.
---
You can just bring a HIC instead. 
---
Point is that no matter what ship you're flying, or how you're flying it, there ought to be a *relevant* consequence to fitting WCS.
---
I was in the same boat.  Keep your corp, join an alliance that deals in Faction Warfare if you want some PvP and money making opportunities in low-sec.
---
You also don't have to jumpclone back just set your deathclone to a nearby station with your pvp ship. Just make sure you don't undock with 10s of criminal timer left.
---
Hol' up, that means stabbed bubble immune ceptors, stabbed tackle garmurs, and god knows what else that I can't come up with yet. No, the game has enough cancer as is. Either both res+dmg reduction or no change.
---
A good troll is a good troll.
---
This idea gets a +1 from me
---
How would this make them safer? With the nerf to cynoes moving them cheaply is not an option anymore. This at least gives players some motivation to move them outside their current areas of residence, exposing them to some danger.
---
I follow all the rules they say man. I’m just saying like if he chose to break the rules and get tackled let him die not just purposefully kill him.  I don’t think selfishly and don’t ignore rules.
---
Let me repeat my comment from the other thread: Dumb, illiterate, or blind?
---
No. It’s just a combination of - it only really has synergy with battle ships because they move slow, have enough health to make it matter, and are valuable enough to make a 2b logi ship not feel that much more expensive. But then also battleships are kind out of favor atm with the meta tending more to HACs.
---
Sweet ill check when im outta work
---
My reflection in the screen.
---
Look a new high end target to forever camp!
---
Thanks 07
---
Yeah freaking good fight nevertheless, are you sure you want to do that again ?
---
Bro, haven't you heard? EVE is a PVE game. PVEve. it's the latest thing.
---
I agree, though current WCS are already a huge impediment to almost any combat ship, except possibly drone shitboats. Also, I absolutely reject the "bring  X to counter this" philosophy. We have enough N+1 encouraging mechanics as it is.
---
Reality: nobody can really tell as changes happened to quick to result in any usefull data
---
I would never roam through delve. Why anyone does is beyond me. The sign at the entrance clearly says "thousands of bored super caps here, enter at your own risk"
---
You can just pm me instead of follow me around. It's less creepy
---
Yeah that's actually the idea. Right now we cannot camp supers because they are in Keepstars.
---
No more structures.
---
Is there acceleration in Eve? I think that maybe Battleships should be able to move faster but accelerate slower then other ships, this could lead to some fun scenarios. Beside the changes that OP proposed.
---
This is tbh a great recommendation.
---
Players play in the game they're given. Yeah, they could purposely ignore the "best" options for them ... but obviously they won't.
---
CCP has created and promoted and continued to support a game environment where this is the inevitable result. They focus on nullsec, they hype tidi slugfests, they flood the game with ore which leads to swarms of supers. And it just snowballs, because a large group establishes nicer IT and finds more players interested in recruiting and logistics and whatever, and only gets bigger.
---
Meanwhile, areas of space that have always had at least some mechanics to shield smaller groups from being overwhelmed by numbers like FW and WHs are ignored or are collateral damage to changes aimed at nullsec.
---
It's relaxing. I have hundreds of hours in ETS2 because of that
---
Why would anyone ever voluntarily use it then?
---
Right because stabs are for ppl obviously there to shoot you. Have them just nerf everything. Including align time
---
Apparently the OP has no clue how to balance a game. Maybe CCP will hire him after all.
---
... what are you talking about?
---
Mmmm, goon salt.
---
&gt; Newbro rant
---
Once you've ranted, you can no longer call yourself a newbro.
---
Welcome to the community of salty ~pirates~ pilots~  Yaar!
---
It's the gurista skin. The black and camo sections are swapped.
---
thats actually good then. by that logic, mechanics should NEVER change once implemented and invested
---
strange argument to make..
---
pvp leshak with ogre can dish out almost 3k dps. Find a friend who can bump (machariel) orca away from docking range
---
Do mind that orcas hit hard so you will either need a strong tank or logi.
---
well undocked just frigate with 2s criminal timer.  timer ends  concord still shoots criminal timer restarts.
---
the 5min engagement timer refreshes as long as you are agressed. it doesnt run out while you are shooting.
---
since players like this always sit in nearly unbumpable spots on a station, killing him in time or bumping him off before his agression timer runs out will be the biggest prob.
---
"Small Group Pvp" LUL
---
Tbf that sounds reasonable, but then I would recommend the "both" solution.
---
For the same reason players try to gate Rorquals to Highsec
---
Hot damn, now that's originality.
---
Sounds like the game is fine as is then.
---
No definitely the widow. It has 8 mid slots to max out the tank. Specifically it is the perfect cyno to have on grid with rorquals because each can fit a shield link and a capital remote shield rep.
---
With 1 bil in modules, I have a widow with 525k overheated and 312k cold. The rorqs would be able to keep that alive on their own until fax comes through. Once caps start pouring through even stukas will fuck off.
---
If shield slaves ever become a thing, that buffer will only get larger and it's worth it to have a safe cyno for something like moon mining.
---
The fuck is a zkill zombie? I will gladly take any fight. I took on their tornados with no logi. We aren’t an over bearing force that can’t be stopped. Rise and face adversity. Don’t bitch about it.
---
Hey kopeng o/
---
Je suis désolé que tu l'aies pris comme ça, je n'ai jamais commis aucune trahison envers qui que ce soit. J'ai transmis aucune intel d'un côté ou de l'autre, j'ai appris l'existence de l'opé le jour même, et ça n'avait rien à voir avec mon départ de chez bag8.
---
Je kiffe autant les gens chez afk que chez bag8, et je n'en veux à personne. Je suis venu à l'opé juste pour faire un bon fight parce que, pour avoir été chez eyes puis bag8 pendant deux ans, je savais que ça allait péter de manière spectaculaire et je voulais voir ce que ça donnait d'être de l'autre côté du carrier.
---
C'est un jeu, je voulais juste jouer avec mes potes.
---
You can't buff battleships without nerfing bombers.
---
Tbf, he has a point, as currently WCS malus scan resolution makes locktimes on tackle ships like on bad scanreso cruiser hulls
---
&gt; It ever being for ewar wasn't a balanced design decision
---
Blackops are the T2 variants of their respective T1 ships, which were the old tier 1 battleships: The Scorpion, Armageddon, Typhoon and Dominix. The Scorpion was and is the only e-war bonused battleship and as such its T1 bonuses became an improved T2 bonus.
---
There was no "design decision", they simply gave the T1 battleships a jump drive and improved bonuses. The Widow was never going to come from the Rokh or Raven, because those were a different line of ships.
---
Other than that, the Widow until recently was a fine ship. The unreflected ECM change killed it. It was a direct carrier/supercarrier counter. Now it's good at getting volleyed by Ametats. That said it is shit at anything else too, compared to the other three.
---
Since it is doubtful that CCP can implement two functionally different types of ECM at the same time (old and new), replacing the widow with the Rokh/Raven base would be the best solution.
---
These days ecm lays in ec300's.
---
You can't lock the ship deploying them against you, only the drone jamming you
---
Thanks CCP!
---
We went from boring, stale and stagnant game play without chat back to boring, stale and stagnant game play with chat again.
---
I can tell you guys are really evolving the game to keep fresh.
---
Bonus waves. Our version of dread bombs.
---
I really love that small entities have moved into tribute and vale of the silent after The Glassening.
---
Supers and titans in lowsec is bad. They belong in null.
---
NO
---
Because it's an alternative to firesales if you are leaving your alliance for one reason or another. Or if you manage steal a super you have somewhere to sell it. They will also have strategic value for staging, and even serve as an option for a nomadic life style that some bitter vets still pine for.
---
Are y’all wanding for fights, or to haze them.
---
Ah. I immediately assumed this would be an additional restriction to the scan res tbh not a replacement. My bad.
---
The rewards increased substantially during blackout. 
---
Almost all products fell 30% relative to isk. So essentially anyone ratting was making 30% more.
---
The SoV around them would be sucked up to deadlock it and prevent that as a security measure against theft.
---
I’ve never listened to anything more then once and I am on my second run through of your episodes, so much information it’s amazing.
---
So, you might want to reread the post again.
---
The real problem since the ECM change is that before, ECM served three (broad) purposes: protect yourself, protect allies, fuck logi.
---
The way it works now, it can no longer be used to protect yourself. As a result, the ships that were balanced around ECM as self defense got fucked.
---
IMO this won't be solved until/unless Caldari gets a second ewar bonus. Every other race has 2, Caldari has JUST ECM. There should be a second Caldari ewar system that is useful for self defense.
---
We're wanding NV because of their affiliation (they're obviously hitting our stuff), and scum because they were constantly reffing our stuff. We don't plan on holding either of their space tbh.
---
I was playing. Just like every other time the game is dead. Same as everyone else.
---
Just in the context of combat ships, the 40%-50% penalty to range and resolution isn't enough. 
---
Solo and small-gang combat is done within point range. Most ships can still target beyond point range with a WCS fitted. Some of them still can with two fitted.
---
Maybe they wanted to invest in PLEX, or have one big “feed fleet” before they quit, or just donate to their friends/Corp.
---
It's the truth, though. Roll wandering holes, crit static, set up doorbell, krab in 100% safety.
---
They already can go into Low Sec. Only thing stopping them is no Null Sec alliances maintain Keepstars there for them to dock in. Do you not remember the Malia Keepstar that the Imperium forced out because they did not like it?
---
Thank you for that helpful response.  Answered all my questions and then some
---
I like the OP's idea. 
---
Here a crazy addition: when an alliance acquires sov in a system (and did not hold sov for at least one week in that system already) it immediately aquires ownership of half the existing citadels in the system (selected randomly, the capital is exempt). The new owner is immedately able to dock. The defenders are also still able to dock. The new owner can add new access rights. There is a two day window in which access cannot be revoked.
---
Raises stakes for TCU. Reduces structure grind. Leaves some citadel tug-of-war.
---
Yes stupid because they got nerfed over and over again throughout history
---
True!
---
A typical bomber's bar fleet has over 100 bombers in it. That means 500k alpha. It survives two waves, even with 5-6 rorqs repping it. If it was cloaked, it takes time for the rorquals to lock it anyway.
---
I currently have 6 citadels: 1 hisec, 5 lowsec.
---
Why:  because CCP forced it with restrictive rigs that cost a fortune, and system indices that a single player can ruin.  The difference between 0.10 and 2.00 can be 1 billion ISK, and one of those systems hit over 7.0 recently.
---
Reduce medium timers, yes, but also make medium structures more defensible when unattended, and even dangerous when manned.  Large and extra-large can stay as-is.
---
It was don’t rat in supers/titans for the first week after the cyno changes.  After that, it’s make sure you’re fitted correctly.  But as a goon, I don’t expect you to have reading comprehension.
---
Well sure, in your wh as usual ! ;) ♡
---
So if they're docked up in a Keepstar, what's the problem?
---
Hilmar talked about the "Three body problem" which is a good indication that blackout will happen again.
---
Easily said when your side of the fence includes 8 alliances against a side of 3. One fight that was taken with equal numbers doesn’t wash the fact that we consistently see your “Tribute boys” in numbers to take 90% of your “good fites.”

You can claim that you’re personally not calling the blob, but you’re representing the larger picture here. Guilty by association unfortunately. If you want a better representation, consistently take fights on equal footing. Not just puff your chest and stroke your ego when you did it “that one time.”
---
That's why i said be careful. Rip.
---
What I love about this line of thinking is you never account for the hole that is created when someone else rage rolls into you. That’s the hole that kills you not the static or the holes you previously rolled.
---
So nothing has changed?
---
I love how lord servant has some success killing a handful of undefended structures. Then declares victory.
---
As someone who's now working at a company with a similar sort of institutional, top-down... I don't even know what to call it, laziness is too blunt, but regardless, it can't be changed. At its core, it's a leadership issue, and it's going to be the direction of CCP for the foreseeable future. There are ways out of this mess, but they're not going to be taken.
---
The reason you don't see a lot of those ships is because of what happens when you fly something that like in hostile sov null. You get reported on intel and within 5 minutes people are trying to drop caps on you or have formed 10 dudes with 5 of your own ship class. The shift (or more like exodus) to nano kitey shit is a direct result of what happens when you try to brawl in null. 
---
I would LOVE to be able to fly a cane or myrm to delve/esoteria/kalevala and get a fun brawl, but roaming 30 jumps in a BC to get dropped by caps or blobbed by standing fleets is a monumental waste of time. 
---
A lot of people, myself included, are being pushed into flying kitey crap, not because they won't to, but because brawling in anything bigger than a destroyer provokes an unengageable response. 
---
People say "well what do you expect, you come to OUR space, of course we're going to try as hard as possible to kill you, we have to protect our PvE players!!". Well this is the end result. 
---
Now blobbing is fine. Dropping caps is fine. But you can't really blame roamers for then switching to stuff that can run away from both.
---
They didn't shut down, they moved to hisec. The deltas spiking greater than they were for the entire month of july and August THE DAY AFTER blackout ends, suggests they moved back to nullsec to continue as they were before.
---
I don't think players should be able to tell you are there. It works fine in WHs. The problem is that hunters know when you start krabbing due to too much information in the ESI and tools like Dotlan and Zkill.
---
I don't know what is worst to be honest.
---
&gt; but it will stop destroying entire playstyles in a single patch. 
---
Some playstyles are meant to be destroyed.
---
Doorbell. Also, nullsec has to deal with getting rolled into as well, AND cynos.
---
Undock... Stop your ship completely... THEN proceed to burn out as far as you want to create a instaundock.
---
If you undock without stopping sometimes the ship is flying off in a random direction a littlebit... so when you burn off its at an angle... this causes a delay when you try to use the bookmark.
---
He said that as well.
---
You cannot camp a hostile Keepstar. But if a hostile group uses one of these stations to stage out of or for a moveop, that can be Hellcamped. It'll put actual players on the grid because they will have a reason to PvP.
---
Good point! PVPs would have to wait in the anomaly probably, and it would destroy the hability to hunters warp quick to the target.
---
Sounds like a fun group of people
---
Yup, I was replying the same to another poster. Issue is the Orca figures out he's being ganked and stops shooting. Then you have 1 minute to finish him before the weapons timer is off and it can dock. Engagement timer doesn't prevent docking, unless I got something really wrong.
---
It's just RNG.
---
Last month I killed three NPC dreads that spawned in belts and on moons.
---
Just need 2k dps to break the tank.
---
&gt; All blops BS are good for is bridging.
---
You're wrong. Talking about something you truly have no clue of.
---
They are battleships that require no bridger, they can jump directly into a fight with zero travel time, they can jump farther than a titan could bridge, they are virtually unaffected by fatigue and unlike bombers don't die to gate guns. The widow in particular used to neuter carriers/supers.
---
&gt; Nobody in their straight mind will use blops BSs to kill a dirt cheap carrier or be able to do shit to a super.
---
Plenty of people do. Zkill itself says you're wrong. The widow in particular used to reduce supercarrier DPS to 0.
---
Literally no swear words in that comment. You make yourself sound less adult by going "(very) adult".
---
Get over yourself.
---
&gt; Cyno changes?  because fuck you, that's why.
---
Well yes, cyno's should never have been allowed to operate in the way they do. In fact capitals on the most part were released broken. In this way at least CCP is attempting to undo broken implementation which should have happened years ago.
---
*smartbomb intensifies*
---
Even changing numbers in a database is too hard for CCRee.  Why do you think EVE is in such a pisspoor state?
---
The word is doorstop spodbrain. Don’t forget you have your precious local back little bee.
---
Yes that's true. A typical active tanked battleship should be fine though.
---
If you're in highsec and dont have much pvp experience declare war against another highsec corp that's of similar size to you. Chances are they're just as inexperienced and you'll have to work out how to do things like defending and attacking citadels, ganking their miners and mission runners and defending your own. Shooting people is the best way to become friends with them
---
Before you undock, alt+E to open people and places, have your book mark up. When you undock you need to zoom out and look at grid, inline with your bookmark. Your bookmark should be tested before hand and further is better. MAking your bookmark with a frig modified for speed (overdrives, and thrusters etc) is optimal.
---
tkt bobby des bises
---
There has been two fights where those “8 alliances” have shown up. But pretty much every single timer on the ones I linked I took out my alliance, Rote, and NSH.  But there isn’t BRs from that because no one came and fought. 
---
But I do get what you’re saying, but have some mutual respect for someone who does want good fights. Maybe not exactly equal but the fleets I take out are no where near over bearing for your coalition to take on.
---
Ah, thank you for confirming it.
---
Being able to absolutely control transit is far, far more powerful for safety than local. There's no arguing around this.
---
Time to fit hyperspatial rig again !
---
Reddit is an echo chamber. People on hear what they want to hear. Facts don't matter when emotions are at play.
---
Published March 26th, 2011
---
Yeah...
---
Confirming what? For one nobody doorstops their static when farming.
---
Its a bug, so may be fixed by 2024 if EVE still exists then.
---
Rewards didn't increase during blackout. At worst you could say that prices fell a little, but rewards did not increase.
---
Oh, nothing. Don't worry your little head about it~
---
You just now discovered it? I've been here ages, sifting the soil and I've found numerous deposits that have never run dry. But alas, I grew tired of mining those deposits so I moved on.
---
&gt;I don’t want a job with rules on what i’m allowed to do, what i’m supposed to fly, how i’m supposed to fly it, and the game itself will punish you with changes to mechanics if you do it successfully....
---
This translates to "I don't want to live in null" because that is exactly what null alliance shove down their members' throats.
---
Break free from your Stockholm syndrome and move in to wh space where you for whatever you want whenever you want. If you know what you're doing, you live. You get to live by your bootstraps pretty much.
---
Actual ly, I have a pretty good clue as hunting krabs inncov has been what I've flown for the last 1 year or so. And bombers have proven to be far superior cost and versatility wise. It is 90M frigate that is basically free vs 2.5B fat battleship, that only slightly better DPS application vs large targets.
---
I have also done a lot of solo dropping my panther on line VNIs and ishtars, so yeah, I have pretty good idea on the subject matter.
---
It is usually the inexperienced hunter groups, who think blops BS are good for engagements and dropping on big targets. Pre ECM nerf, you just use 2 falcons in your flet and be done with it, without being embarrassingly useless.
---
Yeah I don't understand why nullbears continue having this Stockholm syndrome. Null alliances are cancer.
---
Nah, but you could see them on d-scan which would help you pin them with combat probes :)
---
Solo drops on the damn novice plexs where you cant light a cyno or warp a gang? Pffft safer than null.
---
Abaddon is my favorite looking BS.  Too bad BS aren't the meta anymore and are just good for making models.
---
I wonder if this is how North Korea talks to South Korea. "We are a mighty little country, but you're lucky were dipshits that nobody likes and you guys have support from the entirety of Earth."
---
&gt;Hellcamped
---
And how would that look like? In lowsec there aren't any Bubble mechanics, so ppl undock and press "jump to" during their invul timer.
---
Rorquals Online is back.
---
Imperium heading for their 2500 titans.
---
The future of this game is so serenity.
---
Sad end.
---
Flair checks out.
---
maybe ccp could leave praxis as it is since it is very thicc
---
I'd have expected an adult to actually counter the points in someones argument rather than talk about someones choice of words and supposedly therefor age.
---
We don’t do balance changes here
---
I can't imagine how anyone could possibly rat in three carriers at the same time without losing more fighters than its worth.
---
Got Key today via mail, and claimed them.
---
what have you been doing for a year that you still can't get in a proper fit?   
---
getting 5-10 people in a bunch of drake navy issues, caracals, hurricanes, prophecies is not that big of a deal tbh, if you set your mind to it.   
---
What I think we're dealing with here is a pretty classic situation of not reading up enough before starting playing. Eve can be like that. Look up any uniwiki fitting place, try to focus on some of the fits there and you should be fine-ish for pvp. At least you won't die as fast.   
---
But I mean pvp-ing in k space is a fine art of getting battles going, that are in your favor, you can't just roam your fleet in lowsec and expect to get fair fights - what you would get is hard counters. I say stick to/try to get counsel of a half-decent FC from an established group (another nice thing for you to figure out) and make do with that knowledge.
---
It certainly does, just not without an equal amount of carpal tunnel inducing inputs.
---
This is the most retarded post of the day.
---
or you just cyno offgrid and warp in. 
---
you dont *need* a cyno for cap and supers. you *want* one. because it would make things easier/less expensive.
---
What's the guy's name?  How does his killboard look?  You don't need a scram to be bait.  There might be a backup tackle ship.
---
Where you selling carriers for 10b each?
---
Let's hope for the best dude!
---
The fact that they showed up once or twice will always place the potential for it to happen again. That will always be on the mind of those who FC and scout. When you include other entities, you can’t control what those groups respond with when they get pinged. You may want the good fight, and meet in equal numbers, but can’t help when large numbers log in for the content. Alts or not. Eve is thirsty for any content unfortunately, so a blob will form when you include more and more blues.
---
Hence why we don’t want too many. Reverbs relationship with FE started with no blues, just don’t burn each other’s shit. A mutual understanding was had, and hands were shaken. More blues means less potential content.
---
Hope to see the reaction of this as bringing the good fight, and not the blob. Until then, let’s all mutually cry that local is back like it was a groundbreaking change to the dynamic of Eve.
---
Oh god! Can't wait.
---
Oh god can't wait!
---
If only there were some kind of website you could link instead of needing to screencap a killmail and post that 🤔🤔🤔🤔
---
Get some friends all flying Tornadoes. Don't worry about keeping your ships.
---
Use a fucking Talos xd
---
No in fact it needs to go the opposite direction. Removing the production slot limitation on the production of supers was a mistake change my mind.
---
EVE reached the end of its product cycle before it left the closed Alpha. 
---
At least if you listen to this sub.
---
&gt;New stargates that connects distant regions to each other
---
Stain Gate confirmed.

---
Your reading comprehension is bad and you should feel bad you referenced goons, no where in my post did I say "i" go back to your unscanable abyssals. Carebear
---
And then get the loot pinata ganked in perimeter :3
---
So lowsec is safe too then?
---
Null is significantly more dangerous then the easy mode safety of wormholes.
---
I think somebody just has a bone to pick with TDF... As a relative newbro I have been with TDF for 6 months now, and they have been welcoming, fun and helpful.
---
Blackout was always touted as a temporary thing to see how things would turn out so if they feel cheated they only have themselves to blame.
---
That's not how angles work.
---
You can't save stupid.
---
As if that was any different than before?
---
Yeah supers are hilariously safe in LS for what they do.  Imo, no bubbles, no supers.
---
It turns out you don't have to actually wait for an announced change to be released to react to that change.
---
30% isnt a little bit. It's that the money went further, thus increasing its value.
---
 Unfortunately the game developers don't seem to actually play the game or understand how the game works for players I think it's more like the game  Civilization where people are building things and trying to grow economies it's not just a game about fighting other people and seeing as combat is like a board game based on a system that looks a lot like just rolling dice it's not exciting.
---
he's saying that there are people who left the game, because of the blackout. 
---
then there are people who loved the blackout and who will leave the game because now they feel there is no hope that CCP will adress the risk v. reward problem in null. 
---
both are unlikely to return for completely different reasons. both of them could be right at the same time.
---
So snuff can camp those stations 24/7
---
Good
---
Never experienced it or seen it ( especially if you join 1 of the newbro mega corps ) like never seen somebody denied for karmafleet, because they had horde on there corp history etc.
---
It might happen among smaller groups ( like i known some wormhole corps on your history might make it harder to get into others because of there cultural difference and suspecting your not a good fit but even then it's rarely a hard blacklist ).
---
Amanda Shadowsword is an Aeon (super carrier) pilot now. She probably sits in her Aeon in 1DQ1-A.     
---
You won't get her back, unless you are prepared to pay a very generous bonus to an already expensive character.
---
1 HAW Dread = 10 blops
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
I stopped playing the game since ~2015 iirc, I'm still checking here and there and hope for the best to be back, but this is disheartening :(
---
I was very much hoping to see what she teased with her new stargates and new "universe" etc
---
you stupid .... more target is coming...
---
Why aren't players doing jack shit to make content? Why play a PVP videogame if your intention is to simply farm. I'm tired of you people crying about "boohoo CCP bad". Why are you playing EVE if you don't want to engage in Player versus Player battle? and that doesn't just include actual ship fighting, but rather competitiveness in general.
---
With that logic wormhole groups should not scan their chain after 3-4 wormholes, because they can farm their isk in static or home. There's no conflict driver other than "there might be something in chain for me to kill"
---
go take out a fleet if you want content so much, but yeah you are just like those krabs who dock up and never fight when they see 3 neutrals in frigates 15 jumps out
---
Just make all resources finite and grow/deplete across the map.
---
There is your content driver.
---
Null pets can't krabb in system, need to up sticks and move - Conflict driver.
---
Sweet rocks/moons are appearing near another alliance - ready the boarding parties!!! AARRRRRRR!!!
---
Surely this cant be that difficult, I mean - it's only moving asteroid spawns or depleting moons.
---
I was thinking 4 fit rorqs.
---
Actually a fine point.  Would need iteration...and fuck all if CCP doesn't do that.
---
Leaders... forcing me to dock up?
---
Yeah nah, I'm not getting permission to fly my own ship that I bought with my own isk. I do everything in a yolo capacity.
---
Hi, GSF Diplo here, please stop posting
---
Oh, my b.
---
remaps for isk would be the bomb. once per year is lame.
---
I'm a Hidden Baguette pilot.
---
I will win Eve now.
---
I played in C5 in 2015; it was fun at the beginning, but after few months of only fighting the same people with the same ships every time I got bored and tried to win Eve. 
---
I failed.
---
I came back few months ago and decided to fly with BAG8. I had a lot of fun. Unlike C5, C4 chains go fucking bigs really fast with all kind of holes. I really liked hunting in it, roaming with the scout, and the undocking fregates/destroyer/cruiser when a target was found, miners, PvE farmers, people preparing a gank on another target.
---
Here the "elite pvp" will start screaming "that's not wormhole PvP, that's just ganking, you C4 tard". Yes, we try to don't arrange our fights; we just find a target, gank it and see how it escalates and if we can take it. It's another way to play, and I really liked it for the randomness. 
---
We had a first eviction not so long ago, we fought for our home. An impressive work was already done before to be ready to defend ourself if the "elites" tried to evict us. We won and kept going.
---
A lot of stuff got secured, but even like that, a new evict happen two months later.
---
I'm not playing to Eve Online to be some C5 sextoy. Null Sec became a boring place for PvP because of super blocs. Now wormhole is living the same fate, we have to choose between joining one of the C5 eLiTe CoRpS or get blopped by them. 
---
You can answer "defend your space u noob". Yes that's what we have done twice now because we **had** to, not because it's what we like. I don't have the will nor the energy to do that every 2 months.
---
So now, I'm going to win Eve, gl to my fellow bag8 corpmates.
---
Entitles them?
---
That they fucking want to.
---
Just worth to mention that your post gives the impression that you (forsaken empire) was fighting alone against everybody else in vale, as you mention your enemies 'bat phone' always, however your BR shows Theran fought alone while you have almost half of you fleet of pilots from Reverberation. Just an observation.   
---
In any case it seems it was a good brawl.
---
I like your proposal if timer queues. Especially because it somewhat penalizes structure spam. However, if you want to avoid overlap, wouldn't you need more spacing between the timers? How long is the average time to complete a timer objective?
---
All nice ideas, sadly its not likely to happen... CCP has been talking about some of this stuff for years. They were talking about system-wide asteroid belts and ice-comets moving through a system. Also planetary rings to mine...
---
So many cool ideas...
---
I mean...that’s like saying every MMO is the same as eve. There’s quite a lot more that goes into the kind of small gang fight I’m talking about than MMO raids etc.
---
with 2000 billion isk almost nothing will dent your wallet.
---
They have? When I talked to them they basically said "get this 5b vindi fit or gtfo". Though granted, that was a couple years ago. Don't get me wrong, I'd be glad to hear they have more friendly and reasonable folks there nowadays, but they used to be like that.
---
/u/BBTB2 these are the people in your alliance
---
Fuck you. I don't want him contacting me for stupid shit. He said he was contacting diplos. So eat a dick.
---
&gt; the inexperienced hunter groups
---
So you, with all your rich experience of killing ratting VNIs, want to call hunting groups such as NSH, LSH, Ivana and PHEW inexperienced?
---
I'll relay to these shit tier alliances that some dude on reddit knows better.
---
Yes, because everyone knows that on a (super)capital heavy fight it's absolutely impossible for an interdictor to bubble you and all way in before you can ever try to warp or even before you finish loading grid. Not even when there is an average of 50 of them on grid.
---
Don't speak about things you don't understand.
---
&gt;One argument i often heard was that it made subcapital ratting obsolete, which is not true. The problem is that most major blocs didnt even attempt to defend subcaps. If you got an active defense fleet near that system, you should be able to save most of the subcap ratters which get attacked by solo hunters in t3cs/strats/recons and so on.
---
About 70% of the "hunters" who come by are not solo.
---
"It's only guaranteed death 70% of the time" isn't much of a solution.
---
So are the frenchies evicted or?
---
Does rk still have active people or is that a old flair?
---
Lol no. Diplomats deal with foreign policy, not dumbasses who want their character back.
---
Diplomats are self important cock bags who ensure the blue donut isn't disturbed.
---
The dreads or supers Ivana and Rekking Creew use aren't exactly blops ships.
---
He's super fucking dumb. Go read his post history.
---
Players are actively encouraged not to, because guess what if you make your space a fun destination for roaming you will have all the other roamers over meaning you can't grind isk there and given grinding isk is right now is mandatory both because biggest titan count wins and adm indexes need to be kept up, if you live in a area of space well your only real option is to deny fun fights.
---
I didn't say to start with them. Use them in response. But as a means to combat the too many minerals problem posed, ship destruction is the only way the stockpiles will be dented
---
https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/may/23/birth-parents-stalk-adopted-facebook
---
look here baguette - this is some advice i'm giving to you free of charge, through a RL example.  
---
If someone parks on your spot in front of your house, don't scratch his car or something because he will move his car but you can't move your house.   
---
same way if you're gonna go be all "ganky" and "griefy" and whatever you wanna call it (in your 10-15+ fleets) be prepared that someone would want to extract that fight from you, in the form of these eviction pokes. Bob knows I have a few targets in mind that I would gladly go break the windows in their fortizars if I ever had the power to.   
---
So nah, play stupid games win stupid prizes.
---
Come on over to Tribute, hit some stuff.
---
sounds like a problem that is solvable to me. it seems like you just want it to be easy to project power into hostile forces. you dont want to have to think and derive solutions to problems caused by your enemy.
---
"its too hard" is not a valid complaint.
---
gvg is not raids lol, it's 5v5 or maximum 25v25 pvp.
---
Resurrecting this idea would be a huge waste of CCP resources and time - they need to concentrate on improving/milking the cash cow they already have.
---
Besides if I want to play an FPS I will go play a real FPS like BF V / Pub G etc.
---
Hey! I've never really played and I'm not very familiar with many of the mechanics of the game, but I do have a passing interest and I've been considering purchasing Empires of Eve because the subject matter fascinates me. I have two questions.
---
1. Would you recommend Empires of Eve(Vol. 1, of course) to someone not really in the loop?
---
2. I've been seeing posts here talking about the end of a Blackout and PVE being pushed over PVP or something? I looked up an article about it and it just told me that there was a bug or feature that allowed your ships to appear offline(?) or otherwise conceal your presence. Could someone explain to me what the Blackout was and the significance of its end?
---
Lots of PvPers makes a region unsafe for PvP. Roams catch your ratting VNI or your excavs, and organized groups dreadbomb your ratting supers. 
---
PvE by its nature is very boring, so the optimum PvE setup is afk multiboxing about 15 rorquals while binging netflix. Anything less than 100% safety (being able to do this for 100+ hours with no threat to the rorqs) reduces income and adds unwanted stress. So an ideal PvE region would be highsec-without-ganking.
---
How about, if you fit warp core stabs you can not activate any modules
---
Hilmar was talking about this in Finland. He called it "New Eden recreating itself". Unfortunately he hinted that technically it is indeed more challenging than it sounds due to #legacycode.
---
But yes, dynamic, procedurally generated resources would be a great step. CCP might be researching it.
---
No, we died when the blackout hit. Small alliance, couldnt hold sov, went back to highsec, collapsed. 
---
I'm now a goon skymarshall, go ahead and @ me on discord and ill make sure u get kicked out.
---
Not enough minerals.
---
or just make loot the primary income source from ratting. That way we will have less isk faucets and you would make it possible to harass afk ratters by stealing their loot.
---
Yeah, that's why I'm angling more towards "competitive PvE" instead of direct PvP-for-profit. In a competitive PvE setup you can still get the pvp shakes because you're competing with other people, which is a lot more fun/engaging than mindlessly f1ing rats all day even if you don't choose to fight them for the spoils.
---
I remember this. Re-enlisted in the militia and sent mails to Dust corps offering my services. Never heard back and never used orbital bombardment. :(
---
I returned recently recently after a break and came across 20 destroyers in Black Rise. Took a while to remember why they were there.
---
How did you get your space job? You're not very diplomatic....
---
But then explorers who don't want to fight could fit them with no downsides to their activity. The problem you're pointing at is drone auto-aggro, not warp core stabs.
---
Ok I completely forgot about that part.  Still players can watch for them coming in and catch people who are napping when undocking (or if they forgot to preload the grid before undocking their super).   Since cynoes are no longer so disposable players will get kills regardless.
---
flair checks out
---
Before I reply, my post was quite a bit of reeing gotta admit
---
You are correct in that and honestly I blame capitals being too powerful. Carriers imho are in ok place in PvP as there is counterplay against them in terms of jamming/killing fighters. Dreads are out of whack, I don't know why HAWs exist, its stupid and now instead of dreads as structure/capital killers, we have dreads that are basically battleships but with 50x ehp and 10x damage. Supers, I'm not even going to start.  
---
now that I've gotten out how capitals are stupid, let me explain why I think that exactly is the problem. Right now to be competitive in null you just NEED capital hull, which costs quite a bit for singular person. If we get back subcap meta, where ships cost quite a bit less, people will need to farm much less money to be competitive and therefore denying your space to others wont be as big of a thing. I don't blame players who pve to fun their pvp as it takes somewhere around 15 hours to get back what you payed for in your carrier
---
He should at least stop flying what he can’t afford to lose
---
Yes sure let's just do this little thing that CCP totally has the dev hours to pull off. Nevermind they couldn't even get a working middle ground for blackout, or balance single ships that have been broken for years, or fix bugs that plague the game, or find a realistic way to crack down on bots, or anything else. But yeah this should be ezpz no problem
---
We do too, it's been great, LS sperg and all.
---
Here's a thought. People who don't want to fight PVP AREN'T going to fight PVP. 
---
You might want to accept that people who don't want to fight PVP AREN'T going to fight PVP.  Even if that means leaving entirely. Doesn't matter what kind of tinkering you do, nerfs, buffs, whatever. People are only going to do what they want to do.
---
Except those, mostly noobs, who either don't have the resources/knowledge to avoid it when they wish. Anyone with for instance large corp connections/multiple alts, eeeevvvvvviiiil bots, or other methods to prevent or avoid PVP will ALWAYS be able to avoid PVP. For instance the Renowned blackout was easily...you know what...never mind..I won't even say how the Blackout was easily worked around.
---
Now that being said it might be possible to make some non PVP people become INTERESTED in doing PVP. For instance if the Loot Fairy were more generous in PVP loot drops....Using a billion isk ship to blow up a 10 billion isk ship and have it drop 100 billion OR MUCH LESS is bollocks.
---
The only thing Citadels lack is no different interiors.
---
I really wish tethering is not a citadel mechanic or if it is, only on undockable citadels (so the disposable ones you use for solo WH expeditions). I also wish ships can dock/tether to a supercarrier or Titan when they are "sieged", and that their primary function is fleet support/force multiplier instead of being the main combat ships... Just bigger.
---
Of all the things CCP could fix, they chose to turn off local and nerf Cyno to the ground. I would say even super simple citadel changes, like removing low-powered citadel damage cap and increasing fuel consumption, would have served them much better job to revitalise the game...
---
Gonna shoot you a PM
---
did you just call circlejerking in a discord "foreign policy"?
---
I'll pray for you
---
nah dude instead of them having a debuff to scan res/lock range, have them debuff agility instead.
---
&gt; I know that people don't like change, but EVE is slowly dying. 
---
I get resource depletion; that makes sense. 
---
You haven't explained about how creating "nations" or embedding some form of player government into the game would work, or even how it would fix any issues.
---
I agree and 'disagree' I find eve pve awful it's literally even phrased as a job with hourly rates and very few like it. "I make Xisk/hr but I hate ratting/mining"
---
However I find factorio really fun and my God to some people factorio seems like a chore lol.
---
this idea sound good, but won't work in practice. All the mayor Null-Powers have multiple regions under control so they can just move between those in a circle when one depletes. This system is called crop rotation and has been utilized by humans for thousands of years.
---
&gt; there's no way in hell they would come back a literal day after blackout was removed.
---
You jump clone to a citadel where you already have your ratting ships.  It's not that hard.
---
IDK I've been playing 3 months, incursions for about 6 weeks, and with TDF for about a week or two and I've never had any troubles with them, even in basic fits.
---
As long as you're trying to learn, and willing to upgrade so you aren't just leeching forever, they're willing to help.
---
I'm sure PA has no concerns about that.
---
You can't warp in.
---
At this scale, the game breaks down.  So you bubble your own super fleet to prevent emergency warps as people crash/disconnect.  An e-warped super will be scanned down and very easily killed (the game treats them as unfit with a zero-sp pilot, so they die incredibly quickly)
---
Since the enemy fleet bubbled itself, the only place you can warp to is zero on the enemy fleet.  And that is not where you want to be during these battles.
---
The way we dealt with this before the cyno changes was to warp an interceptor to where the fleet was supposed to go, and light a cyno.  It dies almost instantly, but just have everyone ready to jump, right?  
---
Nope.  Again, the game breaks down at this scale.  The "jump to" menu doesn't populate quickly or reliably, jumps don't reliably happen, and if you spam "jump" too frequently, your client gets screwed up for minutes.  So typically 1-5 caps got through to the interceptor.  Then a one of those caps lit another cyno and the rest of the fleet jumped to it.
---
After the changes, there's no way to do it.  A BLOPS blinged with officer gear dies just as quickly as an interceptor when there's a massive enemy super fleet on grid.
---
There won't be another large cap battle in Eve with the current cyno mechanics.
---
CCP where my catears on ships
---
Only targeted ECM got reworked
---
Correct. If we did do balance changes then bombers can tackle supers and jump across the map. The point is to discuss why the battleship sucks, so hopefully CCP may read this and optimize the ship without making it too powerful or too weak.
---
Yeah they have plenty of cheaper fits now - the alpha vindi is like 1b, the basic like 1.5 (same for leshak) and I think the alpha/affordable praxis is like, 500m.
---
Consider you can make those amounts in hours doing incursions, and then upgrade, its a good starting point.
---
You probably should have helped him with an undock bookmark too, huh?
---
These stations and all fringe systems in range will totally not be camped 24/7.
---
Seems they still have big supply then but VNI is a more expensive myrm now
---
so many crab posts.... like they weren't already a daily occurrence. now we are lucky enough to get a dozen a day...
---
Don't hesitate to dive in.  
---
Carry several backup sets of probes. You WILL lose probes if you're inexperienced.  
---
I usually carry 3 sets. Set 2 as backup and set 3 as go home now device. I rarely loose them nowadays.  
---
The aforementioned clandestine highway is the so called C5 Highway. C5 interconnect with each other. This is called the chain. They also have downward connections to C1-C3 which in turn connect to k-space. There is always a way out. If it's inconvenient just hop further down the chain. All roads lead to Jita, or death eventually.
---
&gt;New stargates that connect distant regions to each other
---
wormholes...?
---
GSF diplo here.
---
No one cares
---
nope
---
Maybe I missed something, but here's how I saw it, via an extremely shitty paint drawing:
---
https://gyazo.com/bca77558fabdebfd483fd2a96a6a4ed9
---
X is your undock, A and B are bookmarks, Y is the place where the ship spawns on undock, with an arrow representing its alignment vector. To rotate the ship to face bookmark B, which is further away, you need to rotate less than for facing A.
---
Boosh him
---
If you can afford a super, you can afford the recon to light the cyno.
---
It was even numbers. We will 100% do it on our own (see the other BRs) if we don't need our allies help. We'll keep numbers as even as possible. GFs are what we're after, not blobbing independent alliances. We have a ton of respect for Theran considering they stood up and fought without batphoning a million people like we expected, despite their earlier smack. We'll likely do just FE stuff against them if numbers become an issue.
---
Terrible and nothing simple about it.
---
&gt;I'm not sure what reasoning CCP gave for allowing a citadel to be used if it has no fuel.
---
Because one of the biggest complaints people had about pos mechanics was having to fuel them, so on release no citadel required any fuel as an effort to appease logistics dudes. This obviously led to a ton of spam which low power was meant to mitigate.
---
Tl;dr CCP listened to the players to closely and didn't get the right message
---
I approve. I need to feel elite when flying my sabre.
---
Skip the tutorial shit and join a newbro friendly corp - EveUni, Pandemic Horde, Dreddit, Karma Fleet.
---
Learn the basics and how to PvP and then decide what to do.
---
TEST restricted super and titan ratting to a smaller portion of our space.  But you were not required to stay docked.
---
Now, undocking in the first week before we really worked out how to do saves in the new system would be insanely risky, so plenty of people did stay docked.  But they were not ordered to do so.
---
No, actually pretty easy. Give it a half assed sensor dampener range bonus, jump in, jam/damp, mjd, once at range you can now enjoy the old school permajam with jam+lock range damps.
---
I am a pure pve nul player. I don't do eve pbo because I dislike every aspect of it. That said I play pvp much more in other games.
---
I run (ran?) a mid sized JF operation. The ISK was excellent and far out paced anything else I've done indy wise.
---
I slowly started to hate the high sec JF experience. High sec is by far the most dangerous part of JFing. The problem I was slowly running into was unnamed people who apparently run solo with 15+ clients out ganking JFs in places that even have 1.0 sec status.
---
This is easy to avoid simple scouting and Intel works in all but the most niche of circumstances. The problem is it fucking sucks. It's not fun to dodge these people. It's just annoying. Several thousand contracts later and I'm burned out.
---
I've always liked working on low and nul. Sometimes getting a cyno is tricky. Sometimes finding a good spot on a station to jump in is tricky. Often times you have to dodge cyno killers, etc. But at least I see these fucking people. There's at least a glimmer of an interaction between us.
---
Not so much in high. Guy running 15 clients popping 10b ships all day? I never even see him in my actual non scout ships. When he's around I have to log because they stick around for hours. And these people blow up very expensive things with very low losses to concord by comparison.
---
I mean I get it. It's a thing someone can do. Blow up big ship with no guns, get blown up by npc super police force. But us this interesting content? No not really. It's a chore. And it's boring. So I stopped doing it.
---
Since the amount of mindd minerals floating around is at the point of insanity indy markets have crap return. I used to be a miner/super/titan maker and large scale ore trader. I can literally remember the conversation I had with a client. He had moved on from me to buying from a bitting circle. The prices he was buying for were double digit percentages under buy orders on major market buys.
---
And it was at that season that the economy started seeing inflation with resulting price drops on huge hulls.
---
So here I am. I don't JF anymore because I'm sick of waiting for high sec gankers to chill out, and I can't make big toys because the percentages are garbage.
---
It blows. For a game with a potentially fantastic economy to play on its all driven straight off a cliff.
---
When I read some posts about guys mining in high sec making crap I cringe. Because I know they aren't going to last.
---
I raise you
---
T E X A S L A W
---
&gt;I logged off docked in a safe place
---
A) this suggestion let's you fire sale your stuff in a hostile station like you used to do with outposts

B) why should citadels be a perfectly safe place to log off for literally years
---
Maybe irl, but most eve diplos deal with silly drama. This sounds right up that alley.

I regret that I have but one upvote to give this comment.

Or and here's a better idea. Make ship mastery certs matter by having them actually include all the skills that bonus that ship.
---
Ah, you are most probably a noob pilot anyway. Take some pride in your ship skills you useless git.
---
:D
---
The real problem BSs face is how easily they are disabled/negated. You can die to a few frigs with a TD, particularly if you can't fit a heavy neut.
---
They need EW resistance, more fitting, more damage and tank, and faster locking.
---
&gt;Marz
---
Honestly I was not blaming on those guys trying to get some content, i'm more blaming on people trolling not to be catchable. Anyways, the true fact it that content must be offered to roamers, but surely not by putting a dark veil on the eyes of extremely vulnerable people who are trying to make their isks. But there's as well something you shouldn't do, is blaming on people who's goal is to securize a sovereign territory.  
---
On that case, I really have to repeat , nullsec is mostly a sovereign territory, why then wanting to travel across 30 systems for hunting easy target ? because they are easy target ? there's something not very coherent with the "pvp" idea one can admit, right ? What about low sec roaming ? low sec is currently empty, or full of blobbers, make low sec great again as it was around 2009/2010, then roamers will find targets. but honestly, while i'm not telling a roamer has not to travel to null to find target, I think nullsec isn't done for that kinda stuff when we see how pve can be done there.
---
Many directions can be taken, but CCP needs to -very- urgently talk to the csm and both PvP and PvE communitites have to find a a way to talk to eachother.   
---
My best idea around that have been already given by someone else, it's that pve needs a complete overhaul so that pve able ships become pvp able ships. that way, the 99.99% chances of kill if tackle is successfull become , say, 50 to 70%.  
---
Other thing that would be interesting to do is to develop a new pve that can only be done in gang, kinda like incursions, thus allowing those gangs to get into pvp ships and give a possible response to roaming gangs , once done , other mechanics can be placed to make the place more dangerous, but you can't decently make a place more dangerous without giving any counterparts.
---
&gt; Blackout in combination with cyno changes make things significantly too difficult for the rewards given for PvE 
---
So zero risk high reward is ok but when it changes to high risk high reward it is unbearable?
---
Oh my god this guy / manchild is actually retarded. Even just a casual glance over their recently history  shows how full of shit he is. 
---
I honestly don’t know how his Corp mates deal with him.
---
No this isn’t Fortnite. You get nothing from ccp
---
Besides the other issues noted about rotations within their own space, the other issue is that nullsec value doesn't come in the form of small immensely valuable resources, but sheer volume of half-decent resources.  Between the cost incurred setting up the infrastructure to exploit said resources and the low return if said resources are limited,  at best, they're difficult to justify the expense of fighting (encouraging diplo solutions), at worse, they're not worth chasing period. 
---
This sort of change is theoretically possible, but you'd have to completely rework ore and moon mining to be much better ROI without breaking the economy.  So it's a much more complex change than you'd think.
---
&gt;1. Carriers haw dreads supers and haw titans rip BS apart too fast
---
So basically injectors.
---
You can't even boosh a porpoise let alone an orca
---
This probably has more to do with Tiericide, and the fact that there is no useful T2 BS in the game (PvP at least). Marauders by definition cannot be used in fleets. Further, if they were to implement T2 BS at a similar ratio of T1-T2 cruiser tank and Dps, BS would be competitive with dreads on both, but maybe that’s not a bad thing?
---
We are comparing T2 cruisers to T1 BS here. That’s like comparing Enyos to Thoraxes, except in this context the thorax is far too slow to respond to anything.
---
Part of the point of these changes was to make that not matter.  No matter how many bored supers you have, you shouldn't be invulnerable.  I'm not on board with how they've gone about it, but the Delve paradigm should never have been allowed to exist in the first place.
---
&gt;but the point wasn't to stop big fights from happening.
---
Doesn't matter what the point was.  Big fights are not going to happen with the current cyno mechanics.
---
First super fleet on grid always wins now.
---
Insightful. Highsec has always had a large number of players that delay exploring PvP until they train high skills and accumulate piles of ISK, but then are still hesitant to take the plunge. Such players have always been the butt of jokes as the proverbial big fish in a small pond. 
---
They fly around in excessively blinged battleships with a golden pod stuffed with billions in implants, blapping pitifully underpowered NPCs in L4 missions. There was no good place to use such a ship until CCP added Incursions, but even those require pilots to fly approved doctrines, be nomadic, follow orders, and play on the schedule of the group. 
---
Now the themeparkers can take their blingboats into the controlled, predictable, private environment of the Abyss and earn lucrative rewards at any time simply by activating a filament, all from the comfort of highsec. 
---
Conventional EVE players bridle at the idea that a risk-averse farmers can grow rich while living in the starter area of EVE. We believe that lucrative opportunities should exist only outside of highsec, away from the protection of CONCORD, where risks are always present and teamwork is required to mitigate them.
---
The ability of solo themeparkers to flourish in highsec diminishes the achievements of risk takers. They can't simply be "left alone" since all players share an economy. And their presence is actively malignant because they continually lobby for more nerfs to erode our playstyle and enhance their own security. And gradually, CCP yields to their demands to the detriment of the sandbox.
---
The breaking point for me was last year when CCP migrated the chat system to a separate server. This crucial feature we all depend on was buggy and unreliable for months, and to me this really highlighted how badly CCP had eviscerated its staff of programmers. I don't want to play a game that does not have the full attention of its own developer.
---
Ah goons being goons and in the wild too. Go back to hiding behind mittens who doesn’t log in anymore
---
Why should a region be roam free? With this train of thought, you'll roam in less and less regions until there's no region left cause every single fucking blob would act the same. So yeah, cyno nerf was needed to avoid this situation
---
&gt;they get an alarm when someone enters warp to the wormhole that leads to them.
---
It's actually only once there is a scout in your hole. Almost every wher I've talked to would welcome adding some mechanics that prevent Krabs from warping off right away such as sites scraming so you can't mjd or encouraging more dreads to be in site
---
If you stop breathing we have a deal
---
I’ll pm you tonight ok? Xx
---
High reward? Maybe in capital/super ratting, or scaled rorquals, but as someone who fucking hates "lil guy" arguments, CCP has to balance pve at both extremes, which they've proven they're incapable of doing. Getting tackled in a subcap is basically death, and the people likely to be the ones in subcaps ratting are the ones who can't really afford the losses. I'm not arguing for low risk high reward but the changes made the risk expoentially higher for rewards that are considered baseline.
---
Or to the same system. Has happened before. The magic of j-space. Praise Bob.
---
Not familiar with that, unless you specifically meant guild wars? Which also does not fit the description.
---
Think of it this way. If you're turned 15 degrees to starboard away from where you need to align, whether your instant undock is 100km or 1000km or 10AU, your ship will need to pivot on its axis 15 degrees to align. It's a line, so distance from you to the bookmark doesn't impact anything. What matters is your ship's alignment in relation to the line.
---
Still posting twice in one thread, sort of suggest otherwise
---
Some of these ideas are just terrible as game balance but implemented in short windows like you suggest wouldn't have time to break the game.  Who tf cares if a region is thrown totally out of balance for a week--in fact, as you suggest (and I totally agree!) deliberately breaking the game for short periods in isolated areas can be a great conflict driver--one that MODERN KRABS WILL RESPOND TO!  Designing a system for content that the modern player wants to engage with is not easy but Imo this would do it.   Honestly even if nullblocs wants to bully everykone else, we could still see flash-wars and rapid deployments of rorqual fleets (jump drive ships that normally sit totally still) to scoop sudden deposits of non-regenerative resources.  That would in turn create dynamic content for the little guys, and so on...
---
A) that's good
---
B) that's the way stations were in terms of having items effectively confiscated when you take a break.
---
...
---
&gt;Make systems controlled by Alliances into actual nations eventually and adjust to low and Highsec based on how these player nations choose to govern.
---
.....so you want to expand highsec.
---
....wouldnt that...you know....make the issue of safe-nullsec worse.
---
Nice to see a decent post from goons. This man should be a diplomat not the others
---
But I am a tremedously entitled iskie toonie goonie ;) I can buy any quantity of skill injectors now that the blackout is over to get ship mastery level 5.
---
F*** all PVPers
---
There should be a battleship sized weapon system that does extreme damage to capital ship (think battleship sized dreadnaught). It should be worthless against subcaps.
---
Then you would see battleships used as anti-capital ships in fleet comps.
---
Dreads have HAW weapons.  Battleships should have dread weapons.
---
The difference is tank.
---
Do you have an idea of who you would like to live there for content after you evict them?
---
I have no idea who they are affiliated with.
---
They should just implement solar system physics (orbital body rotation). That would cause real chaos and probably generate content by itself.
---
not really.
---
EVE is too old already and CCP has shown several times they dont do well when trying to expand out of their flagship game. that vision cannot be fulfilled in this environment both codewise and developer wise.
---
i always comment the following when someone thinks of DUST or Nova and the "different clones, different games, one universe" thingy:
---
that vision can only be done if EVE is remade from the ground. adding supplemental games to share with or add mechanics in the current code will just end in a fiasco. to fulfill that dream we need to make a new game from scratch using the EVE IP as the background/setting. EVE as it stands was designed with the spaceships in mind solely, avatar interaction wasnt part of the deal and due to this there's no feasible way to implement it and actually engage the player.
---
if you were to compare, EVE is more in line with old spacesims like Elite or X3, where you dock on stations and stay 100% of the time floating in space rather than having to beam down in a spacesuit.
---
an EVE where Dust Bunnies, Valkyries and Eggers can exist and work witch each other properly would have to be made with the sense that the player character is the centre of the interaction with the game world, in a style similar to more modern space games like Empyreon, No Man's Sky or Space Engineers (minuts the minecraft style resource collecting and crafting).
---
the best example for that however would be a game older than EVE. Shores of Hazeron was born in the 90's and its basically a universe simulator with an mmo slapped on top. player made empires develop from their home planets and extend around the different galaxies while fighting for resources, dominance and bragging rights. the graphics are severely dated but the mechanics of the game are much more complex than more modern and popular titles.
---
such a game covers many of the mechanics that an EVE game pursuing that distant vision needs. the problem is finding the funding and a developer team that can actually be put to work on it rather than hoping that CCP will return to that idea.
---
Just it being my first character character that’s all, the character I fought with in the stain empire and started pirating on so really just sentiment 
---
Tbh the character I have now is prob more focused than that character was for the time and I sold it as well I thought I’d not have been returning to eve and I have the isk away.
---
Brutally slain by his alter ego live on stage - a sad day ...
---
I was under the impression that the ships also start physically off of the center line towards instant bookmarks, not just facing away.
---
If it's just facing, then yes, of course :)
---
I wouldnt trust you to look after your reddit account.
---
Sort of true but not really, because you're ignoring scale.  With infinite resources, infinite people can fit in one region.  With depleting resources, e.g. imperium would have to expand because even though they have several regions to rotate throuh, they are just somfucking big that even that wouldn't be enough.  Then look at winter and legacy, who are able to krab in one region and fight in another.  If that region got depleted, they would have to krab in a warzone or rent space from an ally--but then the ally would have to move because that space would go bad for their members, and so on.  This is a HUGE difference from the current meta.
---
All that aside, I still think even if it just becomes crop rotation, that would be preferrable to this current meta too.  More moveops means more chances for ganks, forcing wider infrastructure networks would help slightly with citadel proliferation by increasing the administrative cost.
---
Points on the board.
---
There’s a locator agent chat channel you can ask if and when it logs on.
---
Oh for sure every region is open borders. Some regions carry fine print. If you decide Delve is the great place to go roaming, more power to you, just expect to be bosoned supered or haw dreaded on every gate you jump through, but for the sake of our sanity, don't come and cry on reddit that delve capitals touched your roaming group, because everyone already knows from experience what happens there.
---
BTW I didn't once say any region should be roam free. I said I won't roam delve, it's a silly place I have zero interest in.
---
Yes. Please use the "Simple Questions" thread next time.
---
I have noticed that. EVE pilots in the flesh are awesome people [there’s always the one who has to make a point, but one data point is not a statistic].
---
/r/EVE is a different animal and you have to rattle the cage a little :-)
---
And many of us left for good, the straw that broke the camels back..
---
NV are affiliated with the salt in this thread, scum has had frat and NC alts fighting for them.   
---
https://br.inyour.space/?s=214&amp;b=8784180&amp;e=9  
---
 
---
See that br^. We're fine with whatever small groups moving in. There's currently a lot of available space as well. Ideally we'd get a nice small-midsize group ecosystem going with plenty of fights and no huge blobs grouping up while smacking anyone and everyone.
---
Adms, titans, yes, and also alliances have no top-down income without linemember farming.  Renting is all but dead and passive moon mining is dead.  It used to be that a pvp alliance could... pvp, and their moons (protected by.... pvp) would pay SRP.  Now there is no such thing as a purely pvp alliance.  So there is infinitely less incentive for players to drive content
---
There needs to be incentive for constant conflict. Border wars that give a bonus to something for winning. The amount of territory would matter less than being able to consistently pull the rope your direction more than the other player. Wars in Eve are more like trench warfare, at least until one big alliance decides they are bored and want something just to want it. Then everyone gets involved, a news story hits the AP about "THOUSANDS of DOLLARS LOST" in an online game and Eve is HYPE for about a month.
---
There isn't enough conflict over resources. It isn't an easy fix though, because that's how things started out... carving out parts of space where the good resources are. Those big alliances gamed that system and established borders, swallowed up the good areas, rented out the poor ones and that's how we arrived where we are now.
---
Rewarding conflict, for both PVE and PVP is what would breathe new life into the game. The PVE measures have been mostly small and targeted events without much weight behind them. The PVP has almost been abandoned entirely, as it the onus is on the players to create that content and make it fun/meaningful. Not that it should be all on CCP, but everyone wants safe PVE and Blob PVP.
---
FW should be a fun, interactive and satisfying experience to win. Combat should be the thing that drives PVE bonuses and makes them worth fighting for. Alliances don't need to topple every other day, but there should be some tug-of-war style conflict that drives ISK to be spent in order to make more ISK.
---
But range and mobility, also why the fuck would you use a haw dread ganking a super?
---
Actually you clearly don’t have enough experience if you believe they are only good for bridging.
---
I suppose you’re stuck in your own little world of whatever blue donut you’re connected to and can’t possibly think from a different perspective.
---
You say you’ve solo dropped your panther on Ishtar or whatever. Okay, show me where you solo dropped your bomber on an Ishtar or dropped 2 bombers on an Ishtar. There is a reason a lot of blops groups are small groups. When you have 2-4 warm bodies in fleet then you need to be able to tank stuff on grid as you don’t have the luxury of warping off when yellow-boxed.
---
Sure if you’ve got 15 guys on fleet, bomber away. But when you’ve got 2 and you’re about to drop a rattlesnake... well, I’ll let you ponder that one on your own.
---
I'm more of an actual skills guy than whatever it says on my character sheet, but you can be happy with that mining drone level V friend
---
Have them reduce agility. So a stabbed ship can warp out but it can be bumped or destroyed in the 20-40s it'll take to align.
---
Tbh i don't roam there anymore cause it's way too far from out current staging, but what goons did is only using the meta,m and it's only a matter of Time before every blob does the same. Better late nerf than no nerf Imo
---
I whole heartedly agree and the sooner eve unites to kill goons, the sooner the game will have something interesting and worthwhile happening. As shit as that war would be, I think a lot of people would enjoy it on both sides. Then we can all kill each other afterwards
---
and just like in Civ, war is part of building an empire. even if you are a pacifist, interested in growing through trade and culture, you might have gandhi as your neighbour and all he wants to do is nuke you.
---
Directional Scanner can be used to identify not cloaked ships within 14 AU, because of this anyone travelling and/or hunting will be able to tell what ships are around and where they are. This in turn makes it alot less safe to for example mine because you are staying still for potentially hours.
---
The only instance where one would've remained unseen while mining is if you are mining in a belt that's really far away and not in Dscan range of the general warps but even then active hunters would definetly check those anyway.
---
You can’t boosh a porpoise???? 
---
Can someone explain me why.
---
Doesn't mean you'll have the Isk to move them freely as we used to, since all you really needed was the cyno module and the ozone to light it. On top of that you'll have to move the recon to the station and find a spot to undock it and light a cyno that doesn't leave the super capital exposed due to a bad bump.  If somebody sees you coming in on a recon they'll know to watch for a cyno.  Moving the super will not be safe, but it it's a worthwhile risk if you can sell it or place it somewhere safe without having to worry about getting locked out of it.
---
It has been speculated part of the  botting software worked off of the local chat system. In other words, if somebody would appear in local the Bot software would recognize that and warp the bot to safety before anyone could scan it down.  Having no local made it more difficult for the botting software to recognize when somebody was in system. At least that's my understanding of it.
---
he died when Eve died 
---
I'm sure he would have wanted it that way. Rest in peace
---
It is supposed to be risky, but in my opinion the failure was that CCP didn't increase the reward to keep people out in the sites in 0.0. The increased risk of loss meant nullsec earning potential was pushed closer to highsec earning potential and people didn't find it valuable enough to do.

Only the tengu has a lot of skins. No vitalshift though

some of us are just tired of the paronising tone of some of C5 guys and the "delete C4" meme.  
---
we just do our buisness in our way and don't care if you like it or not. what's why we live in WH.  
---
we never tell to other corps what to do or not to do.  
---
Of course they can come and try to evict us, if they love this kind of gameplay.  
---
we are ready to fight, (and ready also to lose if that happend)
---
The thing is, it has to be a massive offset for that to matter, when we're talking 100km+ to begin with.
---
Why? It is cloaked anyways.
---
flair checks out.  :P
---
&gt; don't let him dock
---
expanding this idea: as long as the orca is in your fleet (invite him, it might work), you can prevent him docking.
---
just occupy wing command and put the orca in another squad every 5 seconds until he realizes he has been sessiontimer'd.
---
No, weapons timer is only 1 min. So if he's in docking range, that's your time limit from his last shot.
---
True but if this was only about pvp why not make it into something more like a FPS then?
---
Better targeting, being able to target parts of the ship you are fighting quit making people grind for months to get into a combat ship or get the skills to make enough isk to buy better tier equipment. People aren't going toss away ships and isk that took months or years to get just so some bitter vet can get off on killing them. And when the above happens people leave the game.
---
i would say talk to eve-scout ( you don't have to join them but there on a similar enough path to where having a conversation is worth it )
---
They poached half of the active lazerhawks membership I heard.
---
If I was quitting for what I thought for good, and it was my first time quitting? Sure. It's not exactly uncommon for people to give away everything/sell their account/delete their account if they never plan on returning to a game. Most people just stop logging in, but some people prefer to go out with a bang.
---
But bound to a character once activated. (you know this. Just in case someone else misunderstands)
---
It's b8 m8
---
Thank you! 
---
Will do so
---
3 months of blackout vs 4 years of uber-krabbing in safety.  We saw immediate results in some prices even though the stockpiles out there of the null materials are probably HUGE.
---
[Go in C3 static. C3 has C1 static go in there. C1 has C5 connection go in there. C5 has an incoming C4 static go through there find yourself home again.](https://i.imgur.com/s5B7jtK.gif)
---
Also true. But when you decloak on top of your target..it needs to be in style :)))
---
Eve should just go back to belt ratting.
---
Times were better back then.
---
Texas is the reason that the presidents dead.
---
But skins would hide the rust.
---
hi, IMGAY diplo here, please stop posting too
---
They're just items that are delivered like any purchased skin.  You can just send them to whichever character you want.
---
It's already got more than the Legion gets.
---
Nah man. Krabs will bitch about it and throw a tantrum like they did with black out.
---
Yup, so I should really get back to my first comment, then. I had my doubts with 4-5 minutes available but you can't do it in one minute with a single ship.
---
Gotta count on the guy getting greedy and going for a kill, otherwise this is pointless.
---
Tank fit they are strong, and dreads self tackle as well
---
TL dr
---
Get a stronger point or more points.
---
Blackout means you can't see someone is in the system.  Without blackout you can look at Local chat and see every person logged in in that system even if you don't know where they are.  Bots used that local information to dock up every time a neutral (someone not on a "friendly" list) showed up in system.  It was perfect safety as they had perfect intelligence that they were not alone in the system.
---
With blackout the bot can't tell if someone jumps in unless there was a set of "eyes" (a character, maybe a bot in this case) with eyes on the incoming gate.  And even if they see this character jump into system, without keeping track of it jumping out you can't know they are gone. They might be cloaked up in the system or have logged off while in it.   What you don't have is the full list in the local chat telling you they are there (even if cloaked up).  
---
So blackout was bad for bots.  They needed a lot more effort and characters and coding to be safe, and it was never going to be as secure as before.  It wasn't impossible, but it increased the coding need, the characters needed, and the costs due to losses etc. would be higher.
---
Whats the meta for myrmidons and domis? I have both but just started playing again after years, and wasn't very good back then anyway
---
As in "ganking people with VNIs"? yeah, I will miss that.
---
bots use local to instantly warp to a citadel when a hostile enters system, no local to warn them and hunters can kill them no problem
---
What about corp diplos?
---
Have you tried taking your gila into eg c3 sites? You say you get ganked but that hasn’t been my experience. I like to find a quiet c3, run the sites, huff the gas, and do the exploration sites. Can make a bunch of isk
---
it's all about the narrative
---
So before blackout (and now that it’s over), each system has a “Local” chat channel that shows everyone current in that system. Docked, undocked, cloaked, doesn’t matter. This is obviously a very powerful intel tool, as it immediately show you when a hostile (or 30 hostile) come into your system.
---
While blackout was active, CCP changed this system in nullsec (the lawless parts of space where most r/eve players live) to only show anyone who had sent a message in the chat channel in the last 15 minutes. This is also how local works in wormhole systems, which are different from other parts of space in many ways including this.
---
For ratting mostly (although they have a place in baity solo PvP). The VNI got nerfed so everyone just uses different drone boats instead.
---
Been retired 3 years now but still come back for the memes an gifs.. Well done Sir.
---
The wildest thing about this post is the reminder that FHC exists.
---
I see.. that makes sense, but don't people come and go thru all the systems pretty regularly?  wouldn't bots be warping and hiding all the time getting no mining/whatever done?
---
They try to get themselves into the blue donut ring of approval. And assure their members those OTHER corps mining their sites will stop!!!
---
We are moving to DX12.  There’s a lot of work just to retain feature parity, but obviously we want the future to be more exciting than that.
---
I made a bug report about this on 17th of July, then forgot about it because... well, everything else is working perfect, right? So now I went back to check the bug report. It shows as "closed", with some random guy answering me on the 31st of August (took them a month and a half!) and telling me to ensure that I've set up my dscan properly.
---
Beta-testing quality gaming. Features all around!
---
"What is NOT desirable is that the system as currently and previously implemented incentivizes centralization of players into very small clusters that are extremely over-farmed and safe."
---
You people are hilarious.  The reason they implemented this system was because players complained for years that there aren't enough anoms in a systems to support the number of players in a typical region.  This was true at the time and it's still true today.
---
CCP can fiddle with the respawn timers to prevent overfarming.  My experience of super rating for a while in a -1.0 was that the Sanctums supported 1 maybe 2 supers.  If you include Havens you're probably good for 3 or 4 supers.  The Forsaken Hubs were good for two or three Navy Vex or Ishtar.  Nobody else ever ran anything else.
---
So in conclusion then, you're talking out of your arsehole.
---
Are you proposing jamming something that has an NSA active
---
Thanks for explaining! That helps me really understand people's positions on the subject instead of just trying to extrapolate context. Much appreciated.
---
Just adapt to the current ratting system. Or die, you can do that too.
---
I think part of the reason blue loot is less of a problem is due to the average wormholer being significantly more likely to spend their krab money on expensive pvp ships than the average null member. Most wormhole groups generally don't run srp and they can still afford expensive doctrines because their members aren't penny pinching to contribute to the n+1 super meta. I wouldn't mind some wormhole sites having more scrams/points though. Also pretty much all of pve wormhole loot comes in blue loot while mre ignores the tons of money that come from escalations/lp/faction spawn mods.
---
Are you recruiting? I'd love to teach new players how to PvP and I just got back to EVE. Would be cool to fly with you guys some time.
---
&gt; You want ultra long projection,with great tracking, great dps, and maneuverability.
---
you're describing muninns/eagles/cerbs here
---
It's about both pve (industry) and pvp (war).
---
If you don't want to partake in pvp thats fine, just make sure you stay in highsec and don't go into systems with 0.4 security and under.
---
Marauders are perfectly fine for the most part and the people saying they aren't likely have no idea how to fly them. Blops however could probably use a small buff to just base stats as a lot of them really aren't much better than t1 battleships. Honestly just getting better resists would probably be enough.
---
It's pretty easy to look at a fortizar and see how many people are docked in it.
---
In all my time spent playing EVE I haven't seen a stabbed tackle garmur. Like why? It's a frigate and it already has limited lock range. If people fit stabs to a garmur they deserve to get popped.
---
I love poking the bees nest to see what kind of shit falls out. Today it is u/Bo_Hunt keeping me entertained at work
---
I know it takes a few clicks to set a contact blue, but I don't think that really counts as "foreign policy"
---
yes, and yet  they keep relising new soso games, i mean tehy arent stuck like ccp.
---
It was risk proof before rorquals, you can fuckin warp a cap out in the time between someone coming into local and warping to your site, intel nets arent even needed, even with a not aligned cap. That's beyond fucking stupid amounts of safety, it makes nullsec the same as highsec unless you are afk.
---
And yes, roaming gangs can kill solo ratters, that's how it should be. If roaming cloaky gangs couldn't even kill ratters, what's the point of having cloaky ships except exploration? Maybe those empires can use their numbers for once and put up gatecamps at chokepoints to stop fleets, cloaky or otherwise. But nah, for a 30k man alliance, putting up a few 50 man camps per region is too much effort, just whine on CSM until they revert the changes. 
---
All I'm saying is once again, I can keep providing solutions to problems that you think the game should solve for you, not the players themselves. Emergent gameplay cannot happen if the game never challenges you, and pre blackout nullsec never challenged anyone beyond requiring you were awake.
---
Bjornbee fleets and Bok fleets are usually fairly accessible to newcomers in terms of fits (both skillwise and isk-wise), who laughed at your fits/skills? Cuz that's not the way to help people get better and improve...
---
How do you think we know how many they’re going to blob us with? Thanks for the vital info champ.
---
OK, I was a JF pilot for quite awhile, so I know how it works. Jumping around in NS and LS you should never be touched, but when you're making Jita runs getting scrammed is not always entirely avoidable. I never lost a JF, but only because of some lucky eCyno work. Insta-lock scrammers can still get you, no matter how perfectly fast you are, because of the stupid server tick implementation CCP has.
---
Goddam this made my day
---
ok im sorry boss
---
You should send an in game mail to The Mittani.
---
I had a stroke reading this.
---
Sounds like your full of shit to me. Too stupid to be in goons.
---
That is **entirely** untrue. You need to do some research into how Vectors work. You have to turn 5 degrees, no matter how far away the point is, if you're looking 5 degrees off of that point. The longer you travel without turning the more it will have an impact, but if the closest point is at least 160km away (which is the minimum for warping) we're talking about 1/10,000th of a second difference (which vastly less than a server tick, so has no impact at all).
---
I mean, hopefully it would reduce drone boats' dps to zero as well?
---
it looks kinda neat, on the worm especially
---
Also you say in wormholes people rat at most 1 system away, as if you can't do this in nullsec where you have a citadel in literally every single system.... If you complain about ganking so much why are you even ratting without friends on standby in the same system, preferably undocked. That's not an unreasonable request when you are complaining about gangs hunting you, not solo players. To counter cloaky gangs guess what, you need friends to be grouped with you.
---
And now add Citadels to that and we get the perfect shitshow that null has been the last 2+ years.
---
We've taking like 10 leshaks versus 20 abbadons, tried to fight actual gila comps with nano oracles, and done other dumb things besides. We show up with whatever we show up with and take the fight.
---
Of course, last time I toasted unused FE sov, here's what went down:
---
Start toasting, frag 1 dumb jackdaw and then a 7 man FE gang shows up with T3s and cruisers.
---
Me and my buddy ping for a couple extra dudes in kitchen sink to match theirs for an even fight
---
FE reships into a full cynabal comp so we have to fuck off and go home.
---
If y'all wanna not take the small good fights, I'm just going to start bringing fleet comps of my own straight off the bat. So don't start crying about risk averseness to me.
---
That's very true. I've used Linux in the past but I have too many games and devices whose software only runs on Windows. I have a Logitech gaming mouse, a Corsair gaming keyboard, a Razer Chroma keyboard, and Asus motherboard with RGB headers all with their own Windows software not available on Linux. I prefer Linux, but Revo Uninstaller has made using Windows just a tad more bearable.
---
Time will tell, but this is exactly what people were worried about and warned about. Now that CCP has successfully driven people to stop playing, getting them to start again is not, and was not going to be, as easy as 'turning local back on.'
---
Yep we spent 2 hours bashing a low power structure in an allied system in lowsec same result. Structures are rediculous. Timers are stupid.
---
I am actually for most of the stuff in here.  Pretty cool ideas.
---
first of all, even when Null was busier there was a limit to how often anyone went through a given system.  At best maybe some explorer passed every hour or two looking for anoms to hack, and would leave fairly quickly.  The bot sees someone join local and warps to a safe location.  That person leaves local and the bot returns to what it was doing.   It is no effort since it is a bot, and at best it degrades the production a bit.
---
TIL I learned that being 37 years old, married, owning a house and having a 3 year old kid is "adolescent".
---
Maybe I'll get carded the next time I go buy alcohol! Wouldn't that be something.
---
I can't think of a single point in time where I needed no local to kill a krab.
---
Back when it came out we had the 3rd largest Dust Corp because my old WOW guild leader was super into it. We ran some ops for them with orbital support. Super underwhelming for us, apparently dope as hell for them.
---
So you admit your prior point about not knowing how many alliances (AKA how many people are showing up) are going to be at a fight is invalid?
---
Diplomacy isn't about being diplomatic.
---
NUUN is recruiting
---
&gt; There won't be another large cap battle in Eve with the current cyno mechanics 
---
if that were only true, eve would be better for it.
---
but i firmly believe you're talking straight nonsense. unless you mean something like b-5. in which eh, you're probably right. but there have only been like 5 of those sized battles ever in eve so i dont think we can claim those happen regularly or that the cyno changes effected them. given that it will be a few years before another would happen anyways.
---
It's 2019.  
---
Glad to see you are so proud of your organisation you have to use someone else's.
---
You see, again, you have stumbled into an area that would require CCP to go through the Effort ™ of actually having to engage in design and balance testing. Of course, we know that this is too much. These days all they can do is toggle on and off flags (see local and cyno changes) and call it a day.
---
For responding once? Ok. You have a low bar for entertainment lol.
---
I disagree. At least not for DED runners. Many complex mods skyrocketed in price. 
---
Also considering how much control Null gets of T2 production. I wouldn't be surprised to see rewards for T2 products increase as well along with the cost of T2 reactions.
---
that looks interesting
---
you got an upvote!
---
Yeah, because you always want to log out of all the other clients you've got running so you can get to that one "wallet division."
---
Blackout cost CCP players and isk. Therefore it will NOT return and as so many others say, there is no plan. CCP is just implementing whatever showerthought Hilmar comes up with after his hot yoga class.
---
this is false, I am skymarshall
---
also upvoted
---
Ah I remember doing this in provi back in like 08 or 09. Good times, I freaked out when I first came across a multi million bounty NPC.
---
I go into lowsec all the time it's empty.
---
I mean... you are looking sort of retarded here.
---
im the AUTZ one though.
---
Upvoted you too bill!!
---
I really don't going care or even have a culture anymore. There are so many of them that the culture has been diluted by the masses.
---
My guess? Both the orca and the porpoise are considered ore command ships... And what ever tag ccp uses to exempt the orca is applied to the porpoise as well.  Whether that's intentional or not, I couldn't say.
---
---   Okay this is your opinion and I respect that. But I don't agree. Have you EVER played another game in your entire life? If yes, you are blind, if no, you should do and come back in a few weeks and tell me again how CCP is the worst gaming company ever.
---
Im sorry but there is no gaming company that nerfing or removing things from theyr game  has made that the game skyrocket.
---
Eve is moving backward, not foward, in any other game when they relase something and the see there is something wrong, they do the nerf on that thing but they do it in relly short time, not years after lol.
---
Every gaming company knows that if your game is to old, it will never get better using the same player base, thats why the gaming companys make .2, .3, .4 versions, etc etc. so in each .x version you get new blood and if the people from the older versions are atached to the franchise they will stay where they like witout hurting any of the player base they have in the other versions.
---
CCP is trying to make a remake in the same game whit the same player base lol, thats stupid.
---
Haaan comment il porte pas ses couilles ! 😘
---
Je confirme, aucun Frenchy de la Corp n'était au courant de l'op. A part moi viteuf, mais j'ai bonne conscience et je ne suis pas une pute. J'ai appris très tôt dans la soirée que vous alliez sortir du munin, tu as vu du contre aux munins ? Allez bisous ! 
---
La seule Intell qu'ils ont donné c'était celle où on écoutait les comms et la tactique de mafoud sur les comms avant le fight (au travers du stream).
---
Mais prenez le comme ça si vous voulez, pas de trouble 😊
---
Perso ça me va, c'est au niveau des personne cancérigène de Bag8.
---
Encore une fois, goood fiiight was fun!
---
Enjoy the complex loot delivery on your doorstep!
---
thanks for the drawing, yep I see now you're correct. I was imagining the same starting point not accounting for the fact that you drift along that initial line for a while before you start to initiate warp.
---
CCP should disallow supers AND normal caps in lowsec.
---
You can however EASILY light 300 off OR use more than 1 cyno as multiple cynos will not be killed in the tidi fights within the 2 seconds it takes an entire fleet to jump in. 
---
I have already seen these exact same senarios play out within a week of the changes in Fountain and Delve with minimal issue getting supers/titans into field in proper positioning.
---
I don't think you understand what "shutting down" means.
---
You know, I have an open mind. So I'm just honestly curious to know about the brain storming that happened at CCP office.
---
Like when they were discussing what to do with unfueled citadels, who at CCP thought that unfueled citadels shouldn't work exactly like POSes and what was their reasoning behind it. Like I genuinely want to know that because to me it makes no sense at all. If something that needs fuel isn't fueled it should have no functionality. No shields, no tether, no guns.... nothing should be working except the docking bay. But I would really like to hear CCPs thoughts on it. Maybe I'm just missing some crucial piece of information. I mean there has to be some weirdly logical reasoning CCP had for citadels to keep functioning without fuel? Right?
---
Show your killboard
---
And who PvE's with dreads in an environment with cynos.
---
Or you're a bullshitter trying to push a narrative with no more authority than anyone else on the subject.
---
The reward for that activity is already well above what it should be. The risk was simply adjusted to match.
---
All SoE ships have weird agi/mass ratios so that they can warp quick
---
You don’t go against economics. You will never win. Your only change is to learn it and use to your own benefit.
---
Well you sound like the expert here, I'll defer to your wisdom.
---
&gt; Super underwhelming for us, apparently dope as hell for them.
---
I wasn't expecting much tbh, fly to planet, hit F1. I just liked the concept of pod pilots influencing ground actions. I'm glad your Dusties enjoyed the support.
---
not as much as i upvoted you, because I went through and upvoted other randomly placed comments, and then you're gonna be all "**oh I must be a super good poster!**" when really... it's me.
---
You need a balance team, before things like this get considered.....
---
You're looking at the CCP decisions very differently than I'd guess they ever did, and how you should. CCP created a world where the lowest-security space has the highest reward, which makes perfect sense. They left it up to the players to create their own security, and the players did. It's not as if CCP made it easier for them to do it...but players were determined and pooled their resources together to fashion their own security, and now we have the game as it currently stands.
---
Hating on the large corporations/alliances is just ridiculous. They're filled with people that just wanted to play the game. You might be against the big groups (OP), but you're out of your mind if you think you're going to create an uprising with small groups of players. The only time this has really happened heavily was Goons, and it took a massive number of players (bigger than almost any other) working together under a few alliances. What you're talking about is getting the neighborhood kids together to take down the conglomerate at the end of the street.
---
Let's be real: For every million isk you have, the big alliances have 10 billion. Thinking you can compete by attacking them says you don't understand enough about how that aspect of the game works. It's estimated that Goons have something like 1300 Titans, and that's only one of the 4 big alliances -- what possible answer to that could you have?
---
why?
---
I'm awaiting your proposal. Giving even more power to the defending side is not gonna help Eve right now.
---
That’s the point, why should a pve ship be safer than a PvP
---
if you can get the black ops into the system, then the main targets to use black ops against will already be docking up.
---
Because local suddenly disappearing wouldn't be a dead giveaway that a drop was coming...
---
The point is that people who PvE won't use a non-disposable ship that tackles itself unless it has enough tank to survive in most gank situations. Take away PANIC and Rorquals simply won't be used, since their payoff time if their mining drone bonus is removed is quite long.
---
Yeah, let's give everyone who already has a Titan a full fleet of them and fuck over everyone else by introducing a new rare component that is required to build new ones.
---
I wish I could gild all of your posts bill, but I spent all of my allowance on skins
---
Dont listen to that guy...  except about flying garmur and worm.  The garmur really needs a blingy point to do its thing, and its thing is being pure cancer.
---
The fun is diving in and never coming back out for air.
---
You feel the paranoia being to take your over.
---
It’s called a scram and can already be done to friendlies to stop booshing
---
For savings... yeah
---
Anticap dread = even more blops
---
Your idea would have been good back before the mass titan proliferation. Its odd I had this same thought today too.
---
If only we could go back to 2006 and tell CCP supercapitals are a massive mistake.
---
\*cap one\* Goons hunt it to infinity until they have it in their posession, game over EVE.
---
Even something as simple as needing to fly around more in PVE could even help a lot. That goes for cap ratting too.
---
Let me guess. This is to solve the problem of response fleets in ratting systems the solo nullified cloaky gankers discovered as the counter to them?
---
Why the gank?
---
If orca sees tbreat it will dock. to kill it in 60s you need ludicrous dps, which is not possible in 1 ship.
---
No. You could stab tackle ships and warp out when you tackle bait.
---
Stabs should need fitting significantly. "The warp corw stabilization technologies conflict with other electronic and engineering equipment present on ships." 1 stab sure, but it means you can't fit a standard for anymore. 2 stabs sure, but youll need to sacrifice basically all of your tank or damage potential. 3+? Youll be lucky to have enough cpu for the stabs themselves at this point, let alone anything else.
---
What do you want? For me to admit to botting? Kindly fuck off, please and thank you.
---
I assure you I know what I'm talking about, and that's all I'm going to say.
---
....This just shifts the problem to something else.
---
And ignores the reality that once a single group gets control of the majority of them, all of nullsec will exist at their descretion
---
Sorry 'bout that.
---
Oh, forgive me; you're right about the same details for the abaddon model.
---
I made this comment after looking at the executioner (because, best ship amiright?) and noticed it lacked some key details.  For instance, in-game there are openings along both sides of the hull of the ship where the lasers are mounted.  (These cuts close when in warp.)  The model in that repo doesn't have those cuts.  The body style seems a little more severe than what we see in-game as well.  Like, if you imagine the in-game executioner model as silly putty, this model in t,he repo appears to have been "stretched" horizontally s.t. the overall frame is thinner and longer.  The in-game model looks fatter.
---
It looks like a re-design was done recently.  Here is the old in-game model:  [http://www.ravestats.com/public/fen/0\_21032010121532excutioner\_3.jpg](http://www.ravestats.com/public/fen/0_21032010121532excutioner_3.jpg)
---
Here is the new in-game model: [https://image.eveonline.com/Render/589\_512.png](https://image.eveonline.com/Render/589_512.png)

(And a better shot from the side of the newer model):  [https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/newssystem/media/73194/1/Kador\_Family\_Executioner.png](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/newssystem/media/73194/1/Kador_Family_Executioner.png)
---
Nonsense. 
---
1)The chains u get living in a c4 vs c5 don't make a lick of difference on ganks. Most of c5 life still revolves around scanning and rolling for ppl to gank or fight. 80% of my time is spent in a scout, a sabre, a cruiser-du-jour.  Heavy armor or shield only comes out for #2
---
2) two to 5 times a month, u roll into someone that does what u do and then u get the c5 wormhole "arranged" fights...maybe. These are the let's get it on days of the month. U get to risk ur shiny you with 1-3 caps.  It should be noted that plenty of times ppl go "meh not enough ppl on, we are moving on"
---
3) what kind of sextoy are you?
---
&gt; Saw him live like 20 years ago. Keep the writing coming
---
You lucky MF, hands down one of the only people I'd ever go see live! haha
---
If there's one thing I like to read on this sub, by far it is posts from the salty unspoken boys.
---
Good thread, interesting ideas.
---
How about just get rid of them?
---
What if they just shut off local and left it iff?
---
&gt; use more than 1 cyno as multiple cynos will not be killed in the tidi fights within the 2 seconds it takes an entire fleet to jump in. 
---
Now's the part where you need to read the bit about the game not reliably populating the "jump to" menu, not reliably jumping, and your client getting in a minutes-long bad state if you try to hit "jump" too frequently.
---
&gt;I have already seen these exact same senarios play out within a week of the changes in Fountain and Delve with minimal issue getting supers/titans into field in proper positioning. 
---
No, you haven't.  There has not been a large capital battle in Eve since NC fled from Goons the first time.
---
Ok cool, but if you got blown up there would you complain?
---
Looking for easy isk are you?
---
While I personally have no issue with ganking we're lost tons of potential players over the years to gankers. It would be nice if CCP had a tutorial mission that taught you about some of the emergent player behavior in highsec but the first and last thing most new people know is they got ganked for no reason.
---
So if there was only 10 supers in eve would you still say the same?
---
The only were in light of changes that they made later.  At that time there were no infinitely spawning and farmed resources.  Titans were completely out of reach for an individual player.  It took the effort of an entire alliance for months to build just one.
---
Yep
---
&gt;raight from the undock. Try to correct for that while creating the BM. If you hold Alt, you get a small rhomb shape on your ship. That should be centered with the undock in a straight line.  
---
&gt;PS: The further the BM is away from the station, the better it will be for fast alignment (if the direction is good).
---
True...except, for the discussion of physics, points A and B are so far away that the difference is irrelevant. In reality, it's more like this:
---
 [http://imgur.com/a/LCMzKTB](http://imgur.com/a/LCMzKTB) 
---
For reference: I made a red line from the station to point C, then a red line from the ship to point B, then a green line from the ship to point C. Notice how you can't even see the red line going to point B...because the vector is almost identical. That's even operating under the idea that your ship had traveled like 10km+ from the dock, which is insane.
---
its decided: a duel at the sun!
---
Nope, that's not correct. Stopping/starting your ship has nothing to do with its vector.
---
The Serpent Kings Crown looks real good
---
AWESOME LOL! :D
---
Never once did I mention not knowing numbers. The control of response was in regards to not not how many numbers will respond to a ping when you have multiple alliances. I.e. Want 30 to match enemy, but get 50 dudes in fleet, and it looks like blobbing. This is the effect of having too many blues.
---
Eve uniting to kill goons (or anyone else) is not really possible without major mechanical changes.  As long as a group maintains its cultural identity and infrastructure, it doesn't die, it just moves.  We've seen this over and over in Eve history, from the Fountain War to the Halloween War to WWB.  Groups die of apathy, not of war.
---
And besides which, goons aren't doing anything that their replacement wouldn't do too if goons got Thanos'd out of existence somehow.  Look at Esoteria or TKE/Malpais for proof of that, even without goons vanishing.  The problem is the mechanics themselves, not the goons.

Bad idea.
---
It requires two conditions. First, the BOps must not be seen in local or everyone will dock.
---
If first condition is applied, then the second one is that this scrambling effect must be seen in a way of another. Because if it is not seen, CCP will receive so much bug reports from people who will be killed by people who wasn't displayed in local that it will make them regret it.
---
But the second condition will make everyone dock too.
---
That can probably be overcome by making it highly likely that they are going to die when they are used, and by CCP controlling the pattern in which new ones spawn.  It's pretty easy to say why something won't work.  How could it work?
---
Oh alright yeah that's what I've been using mine for.
---
I mean, there comes a point after a number of decades where you can only blame #legacycode for all of the failings of your game before people decide it just isn't worth playing.  Maybe those millions they blew in failed projects would have been better spent doing something about this?
---
...how do you make them worth using if they are so likely to die that even using all of them won't save them?
---
Sure, it is easy to say why something won't work, because this won't work.
---
How could it work?
---
It couldn't.
---
It's even worse than the current issue.
---
The less I have anything to do with him the absolutely better. Internet tyrant that takes the credit for something he didn’t start
---
Their less bees and more crabs, goons haven’t been relevant in years. Until mittens tells them what to do when he’s not fucking about on boats
---
The fact that there is a possibility is crazy enough for me. The potential is wild.
---
I mean, there is a Keepstar in high sec. If you want to dock supers in lowsec, drop a Keepstar. Quite simple!
---
god I miss DUST514. My fucking HEART OOF.
---
i gave you a custom flair, and you removed it because you're too cowardly to own up to your horrible cringe-posting. Sad day.
---
There are no glass cannons in big battles.
---
"Healers" and other force multipliers are generally targeted first.
---
Alright.  What's your idea?
---
The Malia Keepstar claimed to be a Freeport but it wasn't. The owners could have saved it but they didn't.
---
Thanks! It’s actually the easiest of it all to make if you don’t consider the walnut stuffing. It just takes time to cook through.
---
I'm not advocating putting a cap on the number of titans that can be built.  Is that what you think?
---
Let's go back to a pre-blackout MER to get a better view, March.
---
Here we see much better utilization of regions, many of the top 5 regions seem to be using a definite majority of the systems. This is great! Once you get outside those regions, utilization drops to about half the region.
---
What is not great is the amount of players that can be packed into those regions. If there is no mechanic to incentivize the distribution of the player base across space then problems arise. Things like, I am sure everyone has experienced, "I roamed for over an hour and didn't see a single ship". When populations become isolated, travel time becomes an issue, which leads to player dis-engagement and boredom.
---
Regions that show activity may not be active in your timezone, so it is not uncommon (I have experienced it many times) to go through entire NS regions without seeing anyone undocked.
---
These are problems, and pre-arranged fleet fights will only keep the game limping along, not growing or thriving.
---
Pepehands
---
&gt;eads as I think they are still too powerful in many cases; perhaps cutting the range by a third would be a good start. Carriers as a counter to BS fleets I am fine with,
---
The only problem I see with this is the space superiority fighters, which as you know are only light fighters. I do not think the ability of supers to field these. 
---
If anything, I would rather see certain types of light fighters constrained. For example, by making space superiority fighters super capital deployable only. In fact, I would probably tinker around a bit with all the fighters. 
---
For example, support fighters. I get the problem inherent with Sirens, but I might make Sirens regular carrier only deployable. If I were CCP I might even remove FAXes, but instead of going back to the triage carrier, I would think about splitting the carrier into two separate ships--combat carrier and support carrier. The support carrier I would make the traditional triage carrier and only allow it to field support fighters. 
---
That said, these are just musings that I would think about, and actually, you know... test changes before I pushed them live.
---
I gain pleasure in cucking velators that come to troll sov, but save it for the last 30 seconds.
---
As we could say "the good price for a product, is the price at which it sells and gives the best margins". 
---
Same way, we can tell balance between risk and reward isn't a decision you can decide like that, just because it's your own feeling, it's a tweaking you do which gives results, and those results will decide for the good balance.
---
So , the problem isn't in fact the balance between risk and reward, it's only two extremely simple fact : pve is boring as fuck, almost all pvp ships will kill almost all pve ships considering same size. thus, the changes to be done are not balancing changes, what ccp has to do is to overhaul pve to 1/ fit adjusments have to be done to do that pve and get isks, but be less vulnerable to pvp ships 2/ develop a new pve that gives good rewards (say, comparable to rattlesnake income) while being in groups, so that these groups are less vulnerable to roamers. 
---
CCP has ton encourage a roaming pvp that's not necessarily based on cloaky/nully/covert cyno, but has to encourage as well pve  players to do pvp by using pvp capable ships while they do their pve.
---
People were proposing using Jackdaws again Stuka/Goku. INIT and Pando tried that against TEST fleet. Didn't work very well. Untill Super blob arrived, there wasn't much they could do. Jackdaws don't have enough ehp to deal with fleet that can pretty much alpha any of ships in doctrine, with exception of FC's Harpy. And even after Supers arrived, Jackdaws cannot do much. They are easily deleted while their fleet focuses on booshers.
---
And yeah, smartbombs works wonders against them. Thing is, unless Stuka/Goku FC makes critical mistake, there is no way of deleting them with Smartbombs. And even though chemo fleet is largely immune to torps, due to firewalling them, Kikis eat them alive
---
About Kikis. CCP is well aware how overpowered this ship is. But they aren't going to nerf it. Why is that? According to CCP Rise, community isn't raising this issue, so it means, that community is content with the current state. What a load of BS
---
Not mentioned in the Leshak fight was the ball of Dreads we waterboarded. You think we brought 20 Abaddons and Dreads for your 10 Leshaks? Don’t flatter yourself. The waterboard was very fortunate timing, the numbers were to fend off your dread ball.
---
I can’t speak to the FE response to your toasting. So I’ll just cheers you on that.
---
The Criminal attacker would not be able to use logi in this case.
---
Crab detected.
---
What you talk about are modules that already were tiericided.
---
In this system there are multiple items of same meta lvl, each with their own advantage. (webs, scrams, plates, shield extenders)
---
The modules that haven't been treated with tiericde yet (turrets, hardeners) have just a clear progression of higher meta is all around better.
---
I mean, you come on here saying you were going to contact diplos. How dumb was that? Could I have been more sensitive? Certainly. But your entire quest is easily solved by sending an ingame mail. If you get no response, move on. But instead you are wanting to drag people into this that simply don't care about your old alt.
---
It’s probably not a very well liked idea, but getting rid of caps and Supers flat out (you’ll get the SP and the est value of the ship returned to you). Then make the spawns in systems shift based on anomaly running and ratting. If anomalies are cleared multiple times a day, a sov system goes up to sec status until it becomes a 1.0 with the players being the concord of the area. Reduce the number of moons  (again compensate for things that were removed). Belts should spawn less frequently the more quickly they are mined. This forces player movement.
---
I know who can't; CCP.
---
Toxic
---
Or they’re intentionally kept at range so they can’t be.
---
Nerfing doesn't always balance
---
The real amusing part is that it looks like he wasn't involved in almost any of the fights, winning or losing.
---
Grats on running 5s w/your Corp!
---
If you’re looking for some (short-lived) variety while you pad your wallet and train additional skills there are Emerging Conduits in highsec. Shouldn’t be too big an issue for a small fleet of cruisers.  Pays out 4.5M and 300 DED lp per site for participants (not sure on player cap, probably tapers off around 5).
---
As for the variety part, 3 waves of combat, decent loot/salvage, and the sites are full of pretty good ore to mine and refine for indy. 
---
They take about 15 minutes if you’re slow, respawn w/n a minute or two of clearing, and though they’re soloable, they should be somewhat challenging for a lower-skill kitchen sink group.
---
So you want to bash Goons in the same exact thread you are begging for our help? Classic.
---
&gt; What Eve is missing right now is the possibility of catastrophic loss
---
delete asset safety
---
They've proven that their "roadmap" is to throw shit at the wall and see if any of it sticks.  When the wall was too slippery, their lack of planning is the only thing left.  Hilmtard strikes again!
---
&gt; That's not how it's supposed to be.
---
And yet that's how null local has been since 2003. Are you saying CCP has had it wrong all this time?
---
&gt;Using a billion isk ship to blow up a 10 billion isk ship and have it drop 100 million OR MUCH LESS is bollocks.
---
Possibly because it had a typo at the end where it said drop "100 BILLION OR MUCH LESS is bollocks." instead of "100 million OR MUCH LESS is bollocks." like it was supposed.
---
Just have to wait for the ECM iteration. (j/k, CCP only pretends like they iterate changes)
---
So with the option to rat with no interference in your safe space, fully protecting your generally expensive ships, youre saying you choose to not protect youre ships. Wh space is the CLOSEST to perfectly safe when you crit/roll your holes and pay attention to that band new red X that shows up on your probe scanner. Hisec you can be suicide ganked, null you have 100man roam fleets who will wait out your sweet panic button and fleets that use drift/wh space to come to null. WH space = oh your invading space? let me just roll all the holes i have scanned down already, trapping you inside or forcing you out real quick. holy shit when you think of it, you dont even have to work for adms, literally just drop a citadel and done, you have your personal hidey hole. ya gotta be some kind of special to think people will believe that load of bs you just dropped. heh maybe your just a beginner jita scammer after all xD.
---
Buff hp, buff / revert warp speed, allow defender missile launcher to be fit on BS.
---
I think you misunderstand how logic works. If you make a claim the onus is on you to back it up, lest you commit a "burden of proof" fallacy.
---
Had to check and make sure OP wasn't StainGuy
---
it's not wars, it's one time fights  guilds have with each other.
---
Yes, he is.
---
That's another possibility, for sure, but one that greatly favors the powers that be.  They'd be highly unlikely to end up on the business end of a catastrophic loss.  No "the rebels just blew up the death star" type moments.  The other problem that I see with it is that spy networks are too good now.  Anything seriously at risk is likely to be gone safely to low-sec or an NPC station long before it's attacked.
---
Funny part is both abyssmal space and the chat servers are new code.
---
&gt; Aeon (super carrier) pilot
---
&gt; expensive character
---
eww
---
And here I thought all you did was shit post, not shitpost. Well done
---
They have no idea what they are doin now not to mention future. Roadmap for current devs on the other hand probably consists of attempts on finding new job.
---
Didn't that launch around the same time as the launcher itself?
---
They literally are still saying don’t rat in supers/titans kid. What? Holy fuck ur an ass.
---
Blackout memeing aside, this is a new level of safety. Nullsec anoms are safe if you're paying attention; this makes abyssals 100% safe from PVP.
---
Generally the first things targeted are logistics (healing) and boosters (buffs)
---
It's almost  like, GASP, CCP's retardation has given people a reason to finally pull the trigger, and nobody trusts the shitlords anymore?
---
I take back the nice things I've said about you
---
To add to this, the closer your BM is to the station, the larger the effect of undock variance is (i.e. the longer it takes to align to the BM).
---
Ideally, an undock BM should be 500+ km from the station. If you can, make it several thousand km. Easily achieved by sitting in a T1 frig with MWD and going afk for 10-15 minutes.
---
When your fleet only has main line ships, logi and support I don’t see your point in killing the weak ships first. If you wiped the other teams dictors and other support frigates than by the time your done you would have lost much more main-line ships and lost the fight. I don’t know what your referring to as glass cannons as BS,BC,HACs are not exactly a glass cannon,nor are dreads or titans.
---
So, this was more an adhoc amateurish effort to shitpost to see how many would rise to the bait and to get an argument
---
Lowsec can also be safe if you warp off whenever anyone hits local, yes. However, most of lowsec has far more neutrals in it than your average sov-null ratting pocket, so you get more false alarms and taking that perfect safety affects your ISK/hr a lot more. In addition, the ISK available in lowsec is a lot less so it's a lot less unbalanced, even with the low risk.
---
Yep, this is something that flies over a ton of peoples' heads.  EVE is famous for being the "long game".  When CCP proves they have no problems potentially fucking years worth of work on a whim, with absolutely no real thought put into it, why even bother?  Its not like the actual gameplay or short term EVE is any good, the politics and long game are the only thing it had going for it.  Hilmtard even managed to ruin that, he's pretty impressive.
---
&gt; While I agree this is good for the person who actually plays
---
In the end, this is the only thing that matters. Stopping cheaters completely is a non-starter, games with vastly larger budgets and teams can't do it. Mitigating the damage is the goal, and if it comes at the cost to real players, it generally isn't worth it.
---
So while bots will run around again, which sucks, overall the change is good.
---
That's okay, last time we tried to entosis some of rote sov [this happened](https://zkillboard.com/br/111373/), which I don't know having double the numbers and dropping caps seems more aids than some cynabals, I guess.
---
Don't delude yourself that you're contributing positively to the economy by not playing the game. Minerals are plentiful, while effort is highly prized.
---
Except that you said it yourself: Null attracts new players. CCP needs revenue to keep going...and where do you think that comes from? New players. Old players don't "pay" for the game, new players do. Of course CCP is going to do what they can to bring more people in and keep them around.
---
&gt; It was risk proof before rorquals, you can fuckin warp a cap out in the time between someone coming into local and warping to your site, intel nets arent even needed, even with a not aligned cap. That's beyond fucking stupid amounts of safety, it makes nullsec the same as highsec unless you are afk. 
---
Sure, that's why Caps were dying everyday everywhere. These people must have all been afk right ? I never said nullsec wasn't too safe, mind you, just that you need balance and neither blackout nor no blackout were providing that.
---
&gt; And yes, roaming gangs can kill solo ratters, that's how it should be.  
---
Never said they shouldn't be able to.
---
&gt; If roaming cloaky gangs couldn't even kill ratters, what's the point of having cloaky ships except exploration? 
---
There's a lot of usage, but I assume you're only talking about small scale pvp. The point was that cloaky were completely overpowered during blackout with no counterplay.
---
&gt; Maybe those empires can use their numbers for once and put up gatecamps at chokepoints to stop fleets, cloaky or otherwise. But nah, for a 30k man alliance, putting up a few 50 man camps per region is too much effort, just whine on CSM until they revert the changes. 
---
Sure, let's mobilize 50 people times 10 just to prevent 4 random guys to enter your territory. So nullsec alliances should put 100 times more effort than small gangs just to prevent SOME smallgangs to bother them (because you know, wormholes and cynos ?).
---
You're like asking to put 3 policemen in every street to prevent theft, but only on one side of the road.
---
&gt; All I'm saying is once again, I can keep providing solutions to problems that you think the game should solve for you, not the players themselves. Emergent gameplay cannot happen if the game never challenges you, and pre blackout nullsec never challenged anyone beyond requiring you were awake. 
---
The game developer should provide balance, not heavy hammer swing of meta like blackout was.
---
Yes, blackout-less nullsec is too safe. No, the current iteration of blackout was not balanced in any way. Is that so difficult to understand ?
---
Best part is they actively rigged it themselves by trying to inflate metrics and tell everyone it was doing great.  Almost as if fudging numbers never ends well.  I mean, its not like they haven't tried to do the same thing multiple times in the last 15 years with the same results.  We can't expect them to learn anything, can we?
---
No plan, no vision, just salt :( They lack serious program management in my professional opinion.
---
this is the big takeaway, don't just assume something will work without testing it.
---
You realize this is an Orca with XLASB we'retalking about here?
---
Simply blacking out local without some sort of indication of how they planned to improve the reward side of the equation was a mistake. But the reward/risk of nullsec with local is too high, so it does need to come down. And the correct next move was not just to revert to the previous broken state, it was to have plans to make null high risk, high reward (rather than it being low risk, medium-high reward as it is with local and anoms).
---
&gt; Baiting cloaky and nano ships? Have you ever tried doing that?
---
Sure, I live in J space, that's one way of attracting content.
---
&gt; What do small gangs do for NS (or the game quite honestly)?
---
They bring fun and they stop it from just being a farming simulator. Do you actually enjoy anomaly ratting? I doubt it, without the frisson of excitement from the risk of PVP it is incredibly boring. There needs to be PVP on a non-strategic level because strategic operations take huge effort, a big commitment of time and hundreds of players, and that isn't practical on a day to day basis.
---
And even from a strategic level, it makes for a better game when you are able to perform behind-the-lines operation against other entities. Everyone loves being the sneaky black ops guy shooting the other side's economic heart.
---
Capital blobbing and local are bad not because of anything particularly about the effort (or lack of) involved in them, but because they're inherently anti-fun mechanics.
---
No drone boats are superior and should have special rules allowing for their use in all circumstances.
---
If you own a super, you can afford to burn a few recons now and again.  If you need isk, just rat for 30 minutes and replenish your stock of recons.  If you seriously cannot afford the recon cynos, you really shouldn't be owning a super - just sell it for the isk.
---
Fair enough dude. Good luck on your search.
---
This is not even sarcasm.
---
Then the reward in highsec needed reduction. The problem was the reward for those two activities was too close together and my evidence is that a lot of people simply moved their operations to highsec.
---
Just have them prevent warp while _not_ scrammed/pointed. 
---
It's big brain time.
---
*re-reads his pings*
---
Dammit, I forgot that I too am a goon, and I can't read my pings.  You must be in a better quality corp then me.
---
So, you devised a strategy for a game you don't play and don't know most/all of the mechanics?  
---
You are advising to split dps - which is one thing you see in most videos people getting yelled at for.  
---
You are thinking too much in terms of a standard dungeons and dragons MMO with 50 classes.  Think of most fleets as 80 % DPS/Tank in one class + 15 % healers + 5 % support.  It's not one great big tank out in front of all of the weak dps.
---
Of course there's the extreme server tick case, but if we're being reasonable about this, you should never lose a JF unless you screwed up.  I have not seen a server-tick scrammer loss ever.  I'm sure there's one out there someone can throw in my face, but the vast majority of JF losses are people being bad.
---
Basically this. Apply extra downvotes so he gets the point
---
That's okay, OP had a stroke writing it.
---
I don't think this is the right answer. The problem is that WCS's malus doesn't apply to drone boats, because they don't even need to target things to shoot them.
---
Make the WCS also have a drone range control malus, to match the targeting range one. That would mean that stabbed drone boats are range-gimped like stabbed boats of other kinds.
---
I think the problem exacerbated when CCP gave in to the public outcry of rorquals just being large boosting ships and not the miner's ultimate tool, with excavators drones that suddenly changed, and whole fleets of rorquals can mine enough materials to replenish any loss at any moment, regardless how big it is.
---
To me, that was a large mistake, ISK sink is one thing, but materials sink need to be attended too, otherwise people just accumulate and accrue items without ever destroying them.
---
too bad imperium is too big to fail.  They have proven the can just unsub and CCP will cave to them now.
---
I think he is assuming that in large fleets, many ships are apparently fit for all dps and not tanking.
---
I am too goon.
---
I like how you imply you'd PvP if the module destruction chance was lower.
---
I also like how you imply you'd kill a 10bil ship if you were to PvP.
---
Like yeah, I am certain that it's the modules not dropping that's keeping *you* from PvPing.
---
What if local was scrambled but it cost you 1b isk to bribe Concord, and the power overload from blocking local for 2 mins cause the reactor core in your ship to explode thereby blowing up the black ops battleship and everyone he bridged too?
---
Nah. I spent my first 11 or 12 years in game as a low-sec pirate before I went to null. 
---
As for how I make isk, well these days (the last 6 or so years) I do market PvP; however, fair enough I do own both a Nyx and a Hel--I do not rat with them though. Finally, for the record I own zero Rorquals and have zero characters with a single skill point in mining. 
---
What I am is someone who worked in QA and then game design on at least 3 MMOs (I am no longer in the industry), so I have some insight on what happens when people quit the game, particularly because of game mechanics changes (I was working for SOE when the SWG NGE happened). 
---
TL;DR you're krab detector is broken. I used to make games for a living, so I have some insight into what happens when people leave the game, and whether you can, and how long it will take, to get them back.
---
Only issue with that is the estimate value in game tends to value super caps at 0, same with officer mods so odds are you’ll just have your super expensive asset just taken away from very little in return
---
And have no one to shoot at within 3 months.
---
Imagine having to make a smug post about theran alliance. Talk about an all-time low.
---
Nerf ADC. In any kind of fleet with logi it means it's impossible to kill a HAC if you can't alpha it and you haven't got close tackle. It's also absurd for AFs in certain situations e.g. ramjags.
---
Also nerf capitals, because they encroach on battleships' roles from the other side.
---
What if r/eve had a "bastion" like module that stopped you from posting for a day or two?
---
70 mil ticks? Either officer fit carrier or shittiest super ratter ever.
---
Sigh. How about this, fit two points, or use a scrambler and stop whining?
---
Reduce the effectiveness of the super umbrella by encouraging sprawl and making rapid redeployment more difficult.
---
So the recent cyno changes + not infinite anoms.
---
&gt;What if there were a ship that is as awe inspiring and as sweaty palm inspiring as Titans were in 2006?
---
This is what we call power creep. It can be just as deadly as stagnation if not kept in check (see world of warcraft stat squishes for what kind of absurdly extreme measures are required to reign in unchecked power creep.)
---
Argh, I was getting a Error 500 when trying to submit...
---
I just went through this an it (appears) to be solved, but I had to swap to an old version of WINE in the Preferences tab of the launcher, go to the 32 bit client again, and turn on DX9. Yuck. Hopefully the 64-bit version will be back up and at it soon.
---
I reckon it would be a pretty fun job to be honest. Sadly though I have no experience in the gaming sector.
---
That's why you employ the held of your corp/alliance. If you dont have one yet you have a super than I have no sympathy for you. You knew what you were getting into.
---
Sit tibi terra levis
---
Roadmap: Make changes that continuously alienate more and more players until game is dead.
---
I think it would be better if it froze local. So it just won't update when new people come in.
---
This can only end well
---
We used to do essentially what Randolf says in his post, but without the special coding for statics. Now we just refer to them by their sig e.g. "c4 XYZ". And we use the * for home as well (I think that's fairly standard).
---
That could work, but, historically what that encouraged was the formation of rental empires.  The people at the top still collected their cut.  They just collected it from a wider area with less effort.  How would you stop a return to rental empires?
---
Yes, if they are going to keep mechanics like that as they are they should at least warn people about it. They definitely lose new players to ganks which in many cases they didn't know were possible.
---
&gt; A static will always be available and you'll eventually find either a static or wandering route out.
---
I would imagine that at least theoretically, you could get a C5(C5) loop and no exits, until some wandering holes spawned.
---
- You'll still show in local before you activate the mod so the krabs will dock up anyway
---
- Fixing a ship in place means the locals will guarantee a combat scan and a hazing, 2 billion ISK to suspend local for 2 minutes is not reasonable
---
Oh, that's wonderful. You should try out wormholes. Even if you don't see anybody, feel free to announce that you would like a delivery at (your current celestial) and a friendly delivery agent will pop out of nowhere most of the time in about 20 seconds.

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA
---
But seriously....
---
LOL
---
&gt; And if, hypothetically speaking, they were to shut down operations because blackout, there's no way in hell they would come back a literal day after blackout was removed
---
Uh ... why not? Their bots were coded to work in nullsec with local, if they pulled them because it wasn't safe to run them without local then of course when local was reinstated they could just turn them on again.
---
Fair point, but since this would happen at the code level, the raw data needed to calculate the current value of all the components to build a titan are readily available. I mean, users have spreadsheets that can do that calculation for them. 
---
Either way I would want the stripping of assets that required effort to acquire to be fair. Maybe we keep carriers, and only carriers but restrict them to maintenance bays not big enough to carry a BS. Something like a combat Orca. That way you can build up a big fight but everyone is more active and engaged by ship swapping  and such
---
I sold a character on the Bazaar in 2008ish and the person I sold it to promptly quit playing the game. Like a year or so ago I did sort of the same thing as you, and tried to get into contact with her new owner to see if I could get her back. I eve mailed her corps CEO and some of her corpmates, but alas they informed me that the owner of the character hasn't logged in since 2009 and, other than the fact the person was German, nobody knew anything about them nor how to contact them in real life.
---
Power creep is a problem, to be sure, that's why I'd propose that these could never be proliferated as Titans have, otherwise in a few years you're right back where we are now, just at a higher level.  The problem that I see now is that there are so many titans that a real confrontation between bloc level titan fleets is pointless.  It just breaks the servers.  The result is that nobody wants to, and so they are being built and not being lost.  They need to be lost a lot more, and the risk of fielding them needs to be higher.
---
It's been some good fights loving this region. This one is my favorite so far: https://zkillboard.com/related/30000861/201909100400/
---
Good to see small alliances flourishing
---
I think its better if module automatically kills ratters in system and all hostile in fleet will be added to kill mail.
---
All assets in citadels are transferred Into the coffers of the blops pilot.
---
Bruh, look at the op... He suggested removing the targeting penalties for a DMG penalty instead. Which is broken for any tackle frigate and generally any PvP utility ship.
---
Are you ewwing the Aeon? Because if so + 1. 
---
Though I secretly want an Aeon because of the troll tank.
---
&gt; that's why I'd propose that these could never be proliferated as Titans have,
---
The devs never thought that titans would proliferate the way that they have. That their extreme cost would keep them well under control. 
---
And now you trust that they could create a super weapon that could break titans like twigs?
---
You still have the issue that this only works for t1 supers, faction supers are worth vastly more than their mineral input and a lot of the mods fitted to them are valued at 0 isk by the game
---
That's besides the point. What we were discussing is whether players or ccp are responsible for big blocs and a lack of content elsewhere.
---
I argued that CCP is primarily at fault because neglecting other areas of space pushed many people to null or to quit. Even when there were double, triple, or more the number of players doing highsec missions or lowclass WH life or FW PvP or nomadic null living, CCP was already not paying any attention to those places/activities.
---
This neglect over time, sometimes coupled with other changes negatively affecting these areas, basically ensured that null would be where the "action" is.
---
CCP shot itself in the foot, basically. Always focused on null to the point where now its the primary driving force in the game. So now they keep focusing on null even though the minority of players in jspace, the minority in HS, the minority in LS, the minority in noc null, the minority in NS but in smaller groups ... Oh wait, a bunch of minorities is still a shitload of subs CCP is slowly bleeding because they haven't done shit to develop content for those people in 5-10 years.
---
#Legacycode, if it represents a real and decisive obstacle to creativity and flexibility, then any good management will know what is priority number one.
---
There cannot be any real progress by sticking to it.
---
I had the same thing happen to me around the same time, so I assume Reddit was pooping a bit.
---
And I'm saying your allergy to risk is unbecoming, and actively flies against what this game is supposed to be about.
---
Rental empires still rely on the umbrella.
---
Nobody will pay rent if they won't be kept safe.
---
&gt; Are you ewwing the Aeon
---
always. most other amarr ships look good but that, left over starbase asset looking thing, just yuck.
---
So listen to yourself for a second, if you genuinely arent trolling you have contradicted yourself like 5 times already. First it was "solo cloaky is a problem" when i explained how thats not the case you went to "but i meant big gangs which happen all the time in bloc null space" when i explained how to counter that you went to "but its not big gangs its like 4 dudes". Way to flip flop.
---
And yes caps were dying because people in null were by and large retarded, thats the type of players that left when blackout came out, the type that refuse to learn new things, thats not conducive to being good at anything. Ever wonder why the large majority of null players are called f1 monkeys? its not because they are good at the game.
---
Again i explained plenty of counterplay to cloakies during blackout, but you just ignored it because you thought it was too much effort, ergo exactly the problem i explained at the start, pve pussies that whine about a problem but go lalalalala when you explain the fix to the problem. its untanked hulks all over again with you guys.
---
Well, I was blue to FCON for a while. We lived on the very periphery of their space and I particularly enjoyed doing a lot of bait roams in my trusty Rattlesnake, *Girls' Last Tour* (it still lives and has 43 killmarks. It once soloed an 8 BC gang with dictor support). 
---
So here I am, leisurely burning through their space at 2 au/s, when the FCON Intel channel pops up with a guy reporting a neut in my system, flying a Rattlesnake, with an unknown pilot. Since me and this guy are the only people in local (he's blue, btw, but their corp probably didn't bother updating their standings, welcome to FCON), I am pretty sure that's me. Several jumps later he gets on grid with me and confirms my name. 
---
I ask for more information on this guy in Intel channel. The newbro in an interceptor then tags along with me for about 35 jumps, describing it step by step in Intel channel. After a grueling half an hour of chasing a battleship in an interceptor, he manages to get on grid with me and actually locks me, but then immediately bugs out because he did not fit a warp disruptor. 
---
And this is why FCON is dead.
---
Oh, down voted? Did I destroy your chance at a winning Ad Hominem. My bad, bro. You are totally right, all I do is krab all day and I have noooo idea what a video game is, let alone have any experience with the industry, MMOs, or making games. 
---
&gt;!spoiler!&lt;Actually, none of the above is true.&gt;!spoiler!&lt;
---
Yep.  But one that could only ever exist in very limited numbers.  The devs did think that the extreme cost of Titans would keep their numbers low.  But remember that when Titans were introduced (if you were playing then) a chaining triple 1.8m battleship spawns in belts was the apex of ratting.  The changes that they put into the game later is what lead to Titan proliferation.
---
I lose about one to two ships a month in lowsec usually because I do something stupid but the amount of isk I make there pays for the ships easy.
---
Well, ok, but if you know that it was a 700 bil investment, the data to prove that exists in the game thus making it available to CCP. Again, the only thing being sacrificed is the ships and the time. You get all of the isk and skill points back.
---
Nope. I think the minimum is like 40k km. We have had to use two hunters to catch people in ded sites a few times. One to tackle and hold it and the other to bring in the fleet and let them warp to the gates and start burning to the target.
---
My ole pentagram-homes system-name isnt even fully shown on that pic! I m offended! OFF - EN - DED!!! \^\^
---
The 700b comes from the fact that the BPC is stupid rare and only sold on the forums by players, same with 90% of the modules, and odds are they would only base the payout on market value
---
Is that true now?  It didn't used to be.  The landlord only guaranteed to protect sov in the space, not your ratters and miners.  If players these days are that risk averse and demand an umbrella or they won't play, then yeah, your idea would work.
---
Sounds like highsec so no booshing, and orca is also not booshable.
---
Mac
---
Lol
---
So I assume you only rat in holes that you haven't completely scanned down, without any scouts on entrances, and don't warp off when a new sig spawns?
---
I wouldn't give them that much credit.  Backing out of a change after you lose 1/3 of your playerbase in a couple months isn't iteration, it is panic.
---
The Geddon has neuting bonuses, though.
---
Ok so you want to put in a thing that once one group controls all of would let them rule over all of null. And you think that the devs could be trusted to keep them balanced and not make changes to ruin that balance in the future? (not that i think that it would be balanced to start with.)
---
Honestly just leave nullsec alone and let people do what they want, this includes driving content
---
🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀 15 DOLLARS 🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀

Tbf, a lot of people who fly with bombers bar have nowhere close to perfect torp skills.
---
Damn near anything will get the shipyard to start spamming dreads
---
Sure, let's have friends on standby in every system 24/7 to prevent 4 random guys to gank you. A gank that literally take no effort. So you can rat in peace at 60M an hour.
---
Do you even read yourself ?
---
Probably because people rediscovered fun games, so the time passes quicker.
---
It does it do me when I undock. But only once. Then it’s fine. So I just undock an alt in high sec. crash relog. And it seems to be fine. At least for me.
---
I don't really agree with the angle here, I think it's fine for highsec to be a safe space, and wardecs were largely used just to grief newbies.
---
I do agree with the last two paragraphs though.
---
The agreement doesn't really matter, as renters renting without an umbrella is still better than the current situation of empty unused space acting as buffers between hyper dense umbrella regions.
---
And renters will only rent if they feel safe.
---
As we recently just saw, people won't rat when they don't feel safe.
---
That is true... all that being said though, it is a rare case so perhaps combing this with OPs thought might work. ONLY faction titans exist and BPCs exist and they’re only spawnable after there are fewer than a set number of ships in game.
---
Are you mad that we brought kitchen sink shit to fight your hyperbling fleet comp with logi?
---
Besides, that fight was actually interesting because our individual pilots and your fleet were playing dancing games all over the grid, trying to tackle without getting tackled and playing around the edges of Pheonix range. Even the final BR was pretty even on losses. Good manual piloting challenges for our guys and a challenging opponent for your loki comp that is *designed to fight capitals*. Hardly what I'd call a great example of getting turboblobbed.
---
All those dangerous cloaky campers disappeared overnight.  Null became much safer during blackout.  Remember, they're only scary if you know they're there.
---
Pretty much.  The blackout change by itself wasn't the big deal; it was the fact that CCP has proven they have no real plan and has no issues just shitting on years of work/mechanics without any real thought as to how it will actually affect the game.  The announcement of the cyno changes highlighted this direction, which is when I and many others I know who were dealing with the Blackout to just say fuck it, this company doesn't deserve my time anymore.  Now I'm down to one account instead of like 10, and that one is only out of dedication to my alliance.  My activity even on that one account is WAY down already.  I'm enjoying hobbies that are actually fun again.
---
It would be interesting if they made PI a little bit more lively and worth it with stuff like this.
---
You can also export them yourself. I did it for a few. You can also try to open a bug report on the github repo and get some one else to do it. Just don't expect to much.
---
Well because this is not a good solution, simple as that.
---
Why I should not be able to mine because someone with no life, no work, nothing else than Eve mine 24/7?
---
Too many rorquals? Too many caps and supers?
---
Ok, let's neft injectors and turn injected sp back to injectors, and limit them to &lt;5M SP toons. 
---
Let's make rorqual trining harder and longer (they are the biggest indy toys out there, right?) and not injectable.
---
Let's remove keepstars and make rorqual unable to dock, like titans and supers in past (and in future I hope).
---
Let's put a gate on combat anomalies that prevent caps and supers to rat. 
---
Do you wanna mine hard?
---
Ok, but you must put hard commitment on the table, with a dedicated toon that require hard training.
---
What you suggested is not the cure for the disease, it's a palliative for the symptoms, what we need is something on the root of this shit: excessive proliferation due to injectors.
---
It could work but people are so afraid to lose their faction titans that it will be so ungodly rare that another spawns as unless you are exceptionally dumb or unlucky it won’t die
---
When you undock you are kicked out sometimes not aligned. If you undock and not aligned to your insta that you made, just redock before anyone can lock you and undock again. Rinse repeat until you have the right alignment.
---
Good post
---
You are being remarkably drama-filled about this. Ya, a majority of players are HS players...but a ton of them are station traders, miners, and industry characters/alts. None of those things are affected by any of the changes that CCP enacts in Null, nor are there really any changes CCP could implement that would drastically alter their gameplay.
---
What "content" would station traders, miners, and industrialists need? How could their game possibly even change?  Null is where the boundaries are removed and the chains come off...of course that's where they push people, because they want players to have control over the sandbox.
---
You know, the bee has some good points for once. 
---
Considering this subreddit memed the blackout into place, we can also meme positive changes as well, right?
---
CODE. wants to: 
---
Know your location
---
People laugh at the aeon but guess who gets shot last after all your shiny Nyxes and faxes are dead?
---
YEah but the reason CQ was rarely used, was due to the lack of it being any use... 
---
If you had introduced a reason for it to be useful, then it would have been used. The Pie chart in the blog is just an excuse... 
---
Resources should have been spent on bringing in Walking in stations. The amount of MMO nerds who love the player gatherings RP crap would have come to Eve. 
---
Just another massive let down IMO as it had great potential.
---
I'm having trouble seeing how your idea helps then.  Essentially you're saying force them out from the umbrella, but on the other hand you're saying that if you force them out from under the umbrella they won't play.
---
You flag yourself red and let yourself be shot a few seconds before the flag wears off to get an engagement timer vs the orca pilot. Your crim flag wears off, you reship and go back to shit on the orca.  If its in a belt, the orca is basically dead meat - assuming you have the sustain to tank its drones and the dps to break its tank.  If its near a PoS, you just need to keep it from making the bubble perimeter.
---
Again, I agree with you...so not sure why you're being antagonistic about this. I've never lost a JF and I'm of the first belief that you need to mess up to lose one, for the most part. That said, it happens. Even with maxed skills and the best mods in the game there were still openings in my warps that people could have instalocked+scrammed me...it just didn't happen.
---
With maxed skills and anything but officers mods in a Hyena you can web assist warp a JF in around 2 seconds, from initiating warp (2.06 seconds, I think). That means with an instalocker it is *absolutely* possible to lock+scram the JF before it takes off.
---
Paid or unpaid CCP still made money as someone has to buy that plex at some point
---
The problem is not on rorquals, it's in the excessive number of toons who can use them, basically the problem it's in injectors.
---
Rorqual changes made mining and industrial paths available to anyone, and it's one of the most fun things in the game imho.
---
Do you remember before this change? 
---
Only people with tons of account could really enjoy these aspects of the game. 
---
If you had only a couple of accounts you were basically unable to compete, and to build something significant...
---
And make them undockable except in stations that can build them and put a dock timer on them like the warp timer. That makes it so an alliance with one would have to be ready to protect it and it’s home station. And the attacker could still take it down if they have the resources to contribute to the fight.
---
99% of faction titans are on dedicated alts so you can perma safe log it until a drop gets called
---
so you want to introduce a bunch of shit while all the old shit broken, you should send in your resume; you're ccp material.
---
But they usually have 150 bombers in an armada and a lot fly polarized.
---
Yea dude, I get that attitude entirely, I was just replying to this other whiney dude above who seemed to have a problem with it. 
---
For the rest of you, who are willing to fight, of course it's nice to have matching content for your size and abilities.
---
(Also a Dino) I actually enjoyed the blackout, these cyno changes are beyond dumb though
---
Lots of people aren't fitting NSAs now that they disable warping while active. That may change with the blackout being lifted but we'll see.
---
So let's assume for a second that blackout did indeed make botting unprofitable in EVE, and that all the botters had to leave. Hypothetically.
---
What now? You have a business here. Money invested, employees to pay. You have two options. Let everyone go and shut down, or find greener pastures somewhere else.
---
What game is profitable to bot and RMT that also allows a decent ratio between profit and fighting the anti-bot measures? This is not an easy question to answer, because every single game dev hates botters. Money going to botters means money not going to the devs. Plus most botting also makes the game unfun for the players, usually leading to even less money for devs. So they work very hard at making botting hard or impossible.
---
Assuming you find an answer to that question, you now need to set up your shit to work with this new game. Find and buy, or much more likely, develop new bot code for the new game. Get your staff trained to use the new software (yeah bots are actually run by people, shocking I know), and so on.
---
All of this costs work and money. It's an investment. When you make an investment, you want a return on it.
---
Then you learn on Sunday that CCP decides to undo Blackout. What do you do, smart (slightly illegal) business owner? Reverse course and fuck the new game, go back to EVE and hope CCP doesn't pull the rug out from under you **again** in a week or three? Fuck no. You wait and see what other bullshit CCP are going to do with this Age of Chaos nonsense. And if things look good in a few weeks or months, you can consider going back to EVE.
---
&gt; So listen to yourself for a second, if you genuinely arent trolling you have contradicted yourself like 5 times already. First it was "solo cloaky is a problem" 
---
Never said "solo cloaky is a problem". I said that even a solo cloaky can kill the most populars pve ships. Then you told me to use a tanky ships or a cap instead, where I answered you it didn't matter anyway, you would die the same because solo cloakies AREN'T the norm in nullsec. But you lived there, you should know right ? Oh wait...
---
&gt; you went to "but i meant big gangs which happen all the time in bloc null space" when i explained how to counter that you went to "but its not big gangs its like 4 dudes". Way to flip flop. 
---
Cf above answer. Also you didn't explain how to counter it, you gave your personal view of how much effort a 30k people alliance should make to prevent a small gang to kill ratters, which I told you was greatly disproportionate.
---
&gt; And yes caps were dying because people in null were by and large retarded, thats the type of players that left when blackout came out, the type that refuse to learn new things, thats not conducive to being good at anything. Ever wonder why the large majority of null players are called f1 monkeys? its not because they are good at the game. 
---
Kinda ad-hominem don't ya think ? Most deaths in caps are temporary lack of attention, login traps, awox, and people entering system when you're in warp.
---
You just think most of these people are retarded f1 monkeys with one brain call shared between each 1000 people, am I right ? Can you stop throwing shit to people you don't even know about, speaking about things you don't even understand ?
---
F1 monkeys is used by people that dislike the nullsec gameplay of big fleet fights and find it easy as fuck. Ever wondered why we have to make it like this, us, nullsec people, that min-max everything ? Must be because everyone is retarded. Probably.
---
&gt; Again i explained plenty of counterplay to cloakies during blackout, but you just ignored it because you thought it was too much effort, ergo exactly the problem i explained at the start, pve pussies that whine about a problem but go lalalalala when you explain the fix to the problem. its untanked hulks all over again with you guys. 
---
As I said, you're just pissing on people explaining they should be putting way more effort than small gangs, without providing any explanation as of why they should require 200 people to guard them at all times vs random gangs using the FOTM cloaky bullshit that can choose where and how to engage people with no risk and overpowered efficiency ?
---
You're exactly what you're describing, but on the other side on the argument.
---
Start thinking about how to actually propose balances changes instead of just being all "krabs are retards killing this game". If you never lived in nullsec, which seems to be the case, how do you fucking know what you're talking about ?
---
Fair, but now they’re the only ones. They’ll only get called to action when they’re needed, like a massive invasion force. And that sets the stage for a jealous alliance to come for the titan while it’s busy protecting its home. Granted most players wouldn’t do this initially until the squeeze of resource rarity starts to impact the building of BSs again. Then you have the choice of fight or die.
---
They probably have the same system handle local, probe scanners, overview, and d-scan. Abyssal traces aren't supposed to show up in local, so maybe they forgot to enable it for d-scan but not local when they re-enabled local?
---
Make them enormous, make then spherical, allow them to oneshot titan *blobs*, make them supremely vunlerable to line rifter pilots.
---
don't get bought
---
No, but Init &amp; TEST at least both have bomber comps where the vast majority of their pilots will have t2 launchers and skills. I assume goons, horde have something similar as well. Bombers bar is a tiny player on the threat scale in comparison.
---
Allahu ackbar, death to krabs.
---
They still wouldn’t be worth it to field as the DD is only so good and they have dread dps, you would just horde them all and safe log them
---
I have seen removing safelogging suggested here in the salt mines as well. Maybe that’s something to be considered. Not just for titans but for everyone. I’m a carebear for now so I have literally no reason to do it. So the suggestion is made with no idea how helpful or broken being able to safelog is.
---
No need of imagine it , we are witness it at this very moment.
---
Trust from the player base is important. Telling players one thing "This is a temporary experiment" and then leaving it in place, apparently permanently, violates the trust of the players. Having to then remove it violates the trust of the rest of the players who have come to expect it is no longer just a temporary experiment.
---
Age of Chaos shows us why other game companies don't do this kind of thing. It has cost CCP customers and left the game in a worse place than it was before it started.
---
That is the opposite of what bloc leaders want, you need the safest space possible so you can try to compete in the current meta
---
You should *definitely* put that in the mail to him.
---
It was an experiment by CCP to see how many players eve would lose of they take away local from nullsec.
---
The result of the experiment is self explanatory
---
It forces the umbrella to sprawl and reduce in effectiveness, it would encourage leaner null blocks, and better populate space with a soft cap, as opposed to evenly impacting everyone.
---
So people can balance their risk averseness through their decisions in nullsec.
---
Aha! You're ASSuming I don't just because I'm not obsessed with it ! 
---
I already said else where I do what I feel like! Now it happens that when I feel like something it's usually focused.
---
WHEN I feel like PVE I do that and only that unless forced into it.
---
WHEN I feel like trading I do that and only that. Hell I have trading alts how haven't left the station since they were "born". AND YOU CAN'T MAKE THEM!
---
WHEN I feel like hauling I do that.
---
WHEN I feel like manufacturing I do that.
---
On the RARE occasions I feel like mining, I even do that.
---
And many MANY other things. Some of which you might not be aware are possible in EVE.
---
My point is the primarily or even mostly PVP people of which you are apparently one, always want to DEMAND that EVERYBODY do PVP, REGARDLESS of how they feel about it and DEMAND that CCP make that happen.
---
Taint happening McGee! 
---
No matter how YOU feel about it or how your ilk of PVP obsessed feel about it because I figured something out, which apparently CCP has also.
---
&lt;deleted&gt;
---
If you're wondering what the deleted section was I was going to explain in great and IRREFUTABLE detail what CCP has apparently figured out, (possibly too late!) and what it means and WILL mean forevermore and trigger a SHOWER, no..FLOOD of PVPer vitriol, downvotes, rage and TEARS! 
---
However, decided not to for my own reasons. Oh, the tears and rage I am foregoing! But I think I'll just sit back and watch events play out as I predict. 
---
That will be MUCH more entertaining!
---
I mean I remember what happened the PVPer vitriol, downvotes, rage and TEARS and DENIAL when it was predicted what the results of Blackout would be and that it would be a failed experiment, and that it would be abandoned in short order. Well, guess what?
---
BOHICA!!!
---
Why would you use a hyena over a daredevil?
---
Are you okay? You sound like you need professional help, my dude.
---
Funny that you said that, because I do work for CCP already. I am testing our new ideas with you guys before we implement them. My first two ideas were something about a blackout and some cyno stuff :-/
---
I am aware of how that works, but I am still pointing out to the player above that logi wil get concorded in hisec at this point, it is strong tank only.
---
If you have enough, you can alpha it.
---
Good posts, I agree with almost everything. The exceptions: I do not like your proposed cyno changes. I do not like your proposed Interceptor changes.
---
A lot of the rest is superb.
---
I'll be very honest: Those changes would mean an incredible swath of the playerbase would quit, which means the game would shut down. I disagree with almost all of your ideas, because all of them severely negatively affect the gameplay of specific segments. Ways of fixing an issue are not valid if they drastically negatively affect other ways.
---
You can't "limit" the game just because some people will spend 400 hours a month playing. You will *always* have those people, and those people will break balance just because they're spending way more time than normal people. You don't ruin the game for the rest just to combat that.
---
It takes over a year to train into a Rorqual fit, without using Injectors. Thinking that's not enough time to get into a ship with a limited set of skills is ridiculous. You want to talk about Injectors being bad sure, we can definitely agree on that.
---
Your entire post is "how can we prevent Caps from affecting subcap players?", which is bad design. The two need to work together to be effective...anything that pits them against each other is poor design.
---
Seems to me like it'd just get the powers that be to spread out more, and claim more space.  What would keep the umbrella from just following the crabs around?
---
Nice post, I like the changes to SP. SP is a big factor when new players look at this game. They see how you have to train skills and get imitated when they hear people have been playing for years, thinking they will never catch up or be useful. I have always liked the idea of injectors as a means for new players to accelerate the time they have missed by not playing. In the same sense people abused them as they really had no restrictions put on them. I personally think injectors should never be used on Cap skills.
---
Because Range is more important than just effectiveness. I can stasis web at like 34km, which means when I'm gating into a regional I have no risk my JF decloaking before I can get within range.
---
Can a super tether at a Raitaru?
---
The real misleading part of that clip is that "lone wolf in far reaches of space" -part. Solo pvp has almost died. Encounters like that don't happen anymore because there are plenty of miners but only small handful of players who bother to hunt them solo. If every single Eve player would go out on solo pvp roams now and then, stories like that would be a lot more common.
---
How many times have you done that lately?
---
Remember the days when there wasn't a Reddit thread every 5 minutes to do with balance or game improvement changes.
---
What a time to be alive.
---
FFS All CCP folks need to read the fuck out of this.  This is so so so so good.
---
The cyno changes, and needing to cover larger areas.
---
They would 100% not be able to operate as they do now.
---
And the current powers spreading out is good. That's conflict. And right now they often hold a lot of unused space to maintain buffers.
---
Hi, higher ranking GSF person here. Sorry for the cringe posting from our diplo. Feel free to send me a PM, I can forward your message to the person who owns the character.
---
RTS instead. CCPlz
---
Yes i know wormholers love to discus wormhole mapping tools and bookmark naming schemes :)
---
I think you could make that highly unlikely.  It would be a ship that you'd have a high chance of losing once you used it, and if you lose it, the next component necessary for building one wouldn't spawn where you'd be likely to get it, so the balance would shift continuously unless they never get used.
---
Small tweaks are unlikely to disrupt the stagnation that Eve has fallen into.  If we don't trust the devs to make changes that have the potential to actually shake things up, then what we get is the status quo until they turn the servers off.
---
Maybe that's really the best that we can hope for at this point - that Eve is just in a slow decline and anything other than preserving the status quo will just make it die faster.  I'd like to think not, but maybe.  If so, the Devs should really do nothing, and just let everyone Rorqual in peace.
---
O2V-BK
---
Nice system you got there... be a shame if something happened to it.
---
People want to engage in pvp. They just dont want it when they make their isk in their pve ship.
---
...Dude... High five.
---
Yeah I'm sure most of them think its cheating/exploiting and submit a ticket only for CCP to tell them its all OK which only confuses and upsets them more.
---
lmao what a ratte can 100% break a xlasb
---
There are potential methods to stem the stagnation without introducing world of warcraft levels of power creep into the game.
---
A planet whacking into a Keepstar does seem fun
---
drekavac, vigilant, deimos all of those can kill it
---
You also assume that CCP would actually learn and iterate on any mistakes encountered during Chaos.  Or that they'd actually have at least somewhat thought through the changes they dump out.  We have 10+ years of proof that they do no such thing.
---
Today, we are all the pillow.
---
you guys are really overestimating a orcas tank, xlasb orca does not have a ton of tank, 800 dps should easily break it
---
There already exists, vehicles of such cataclysmic destruction. The problem is, these vehicles have no intention or reason to really fight one another, except for settling old grudges and content-generation. If CCP gives the bigger alliances a reason to truly fight one another, then the problem will sort itself out. I know that isn't an easy ask, but that's what it might take. 
---
I think all but the sweatiest of krabs will agree; space could use a bit more risk. The Blackout, for many, was a step way too far in that direction. We need to have more ships blow up, but at the same time, we can't have a system where players feel that they are **utterly helpless** to defend their precious pixels. If it isn't a PvP solution, perhaps it could be a PvE solution. Invasions are a step in the right direction, I think. Get that impressive AI working and present a real threat (with proportional rewards) in *random* systems/constellations in null, something that can't easily be ignored.
---
You have to shoot those miners and industrials to give a reason for the players to undock and come chase you down. "Hey, there is a bad guy in our space shooting our miners!". If you leave them alone they have zero reason to come chase you.
---
Sounds good to me.  I think they'd need to be pretty vulnerable to ensure that no one entity could control many of them at one time unless they just hid them away and never used them.
---
NPC region added to dronelands
---
Dronelands is lacking a whole NPC region, should get one.
---
I see whats going on here.
---
IMO inherently slowing down capital response time through a spool is a better way to limit capital mobility than having artificial ship restrictions. With the spool there is no longer a need for as restrictive ship classes, as it's still a whackamole whether the recon ship you miss is the one that will bring in 100 supers instantly. I'm adamant on Hics being able to fit capital cynos, as in lowsec, a hic cyno is one of the few ways to tackle a super and get ships on fast enough to kill it.
---
As for interceptors, having a combat probe fitting bonus also works. Some way to allow ceptors to land initial tackle far better than any other ship, which is their Tech 2 niche.
---
You shouldn’t need a HIC to roll a hole unless you either mess up, or if a large group of enemies comes through
---
You mad Bro? In any sense of the word?
---
You lot are amusing. When you can't refute you attempt to insult! It's impossible to insult me when your opinion means less to me than my neighbor's dog!
---
PS The dog is dead.
---
I don't agree with everything but I love your suggestions for capitals and rorquals. Good post.
---
They were a mistake from the very beginning.
---
Alternatively you can interpret it as no system is more than 1 mid from where snuff can stage dreads.
---
It's not an insult, you actually legitimately sound unhinged. Very reminiscent of a clinical narcissist to be honest. Unless you are trolling, in which case good job, you successfully impersonated somebody in need of actual clinical help?
---
The orca won’t be suspect after the 5 minutes is up. So repping it after that should be legal, right?
---
It's a mess and it's been days now I cant even play because it's just fucked up
---
He sounds like me. IRL I almost always forget *something* that I really shouldn’t have and end up regretting it.
---
Agile development is great. The things CCP have been doing are not that. Chaos Era changes are not that. They were these sweeping changes that were dubbed "expiremental".
---
Agile iteration is great. Look at Riot Games. Every month a new patch tweaking a quarter of their champs to shake things up or fix whats too broken. 
---
When was the last time CCP tweaked a ship? They have double the tweaking potential over Riot and they instead are only capable of sweeping changes.
---
&gt; Pie in the sky
---
Oh boi.
---
That's gonna be so much shitshow and everything's gonna be on fire.
---
I love it.
---
If the Orca is shot by a criminal then you can rep him, but once he is in a limited engagement then the Orca cannot be repped.   I don't think the system follows through that the Orca initially engaged a criminal.
---
I like an angry mustache post, brb i'll need a shower.
---
I subscribed to this guy’s YouTube channel a couple of weeks ago and I thoroughly enjoy his videos.
---
Definitely worth a watch if you enjoy WH brawling PvP videos.  Lots of Megathron, Hyperion, and Leshak action.
---
Might be faster to sew the UnrealEngine4 renderer onto the current engine, and replace it. 
---
Then you get the benefit of the 100+ engineers working at Epic to improve it and add features just to the renderer. 
---
Also next generation console hardware, and a replacement for your physics engine that will be hardware accelerated with either AMD or Nvidia hardware. The new Chaos system in Unreal looks pretty nice.
---
More UE4 engine the better I can tell by the content being so 2003 that the tools being used are pretty bad. BP, Cinematic, Tools, etc. Easy to use Art Pipeline. 
---
Hong Kong team using Unity have a more interesting mission system then the current Eve system. Little cinematics, characters talking to you via 2D UI blended with 3D objects from the world. Check out Second Galaxy for a good example of a structure done too quickly and not polished very well but still leaps ahead of CCP.
---
It didn't when they introduced blackops.
---
I don't agree with everything here, but I agree with most things.
---
The highest priority should be on fixing structures:
---
&gt; Rather than set timezones, citadels use the Strontium system from Towers. No stront, no timer.
---
Hell yeah. Nothing makes me miss POS grinds more than spending days and days grinding an astrahus. Plus, realizing deep into a bash that the defender forgot to stront their tower was always a delight.
---
I think this disturbs me a little though:
---
&gt; Redo the map such that nullsec is in the middle, surrounded by a ring of lowsec, with highsec on the outer rim.
---
By concentrating all of sov null in one spot, it would be easier for a single mega coalition to control all of it.
---
I thought I wasn't that annoying.
---
It didn't when the blops were first added though, it was just laser bonuses at that time iirc
---
I am in one.
---
Anyone ratting under an umbrella should be in comms already. It is that simple and if you cock it up, you deserve to die
---
* All + Attributes removed from implants
---
I really really wish this is a thing. Its so annoying how having super expensive implants makes you so risk averse. Sometimes I want to just undock a welp a few ships, but every time I got to jump clone &gt;.&lt;
---
I fly them frequently with Seedow, dunking things. But even then there are ways to deal with it.
---
Complacency does not excuse you.
---
Hopefully they will manage to get Project Nova back up and running as an actual game at some point.
---
Some very good / interesting ideas in here. Not sure how I feel about adding scram/durability to low class wormhole frigates. The sites are meant as entry level (T1 cruiser/Battlecruiser for C1s and C2s). Durability for frigates in C5s would largely be a minor annoyance and of little consequence given the dps involved. 
---
Honestly the best thing to increase risk of site running is an increase in wormhole participation. It's gotten a LOT quieter lately imo along the C5 chains, lots of folks looking for null exits for fights. 
---
Good ideas overall though, some would benefit me others would hamper me, but nothing I couldn't adapt to 😁
---
Lol, would actually start playing again if half of those get implemented
---
Luckily, I'll never get back.
---
Even more easy:
---
Disable all offensive systems while you are stabbed.
---
Damn I just upvoted a grrrgoon, time to chop off my own hands.
---
I would simply state that any use of WCS will turn off your offensive capacity.
---
The biggest issue isn't SP there, the biggest issue is the inability to build there own stuff, like right now as a new player you feel forced to join a existing empire, like the issue isn't that they don't understand you can't build a castle in a day, it's that dragging stones to your castle isn't gonna get them to build there own castle. 
---
Like a lot of new players come into the game trying to build something with like there 5 or 10 friends and well there is really no good advice for them.
---
LS is an absolutely dead sentence if you don't believe me try to get a citadel down somewhere, like you have to deal with politics and without contacts well you're more then likely gonna lose it. 
---
NS well yeah not gonna happen.
---
HS wardecs. 
---
Wormhole space, not exactly easy but at the very least you likely will make it past your first 3/4 months but mechanically punishing as fuck, no med clones no local no dead clones having to account for ship mass dealing with weird mechanical tricks and getting rolled in by groups that field 1 billion isk battleships as there fun doctrine. ( while it's the most open it's also a sandbox really hard for a Low SP group to not feel hopelessly outclassed in ). 
---
Plus even knowing the existence of wormhole space is an issue in and of itself. 
---
This leaves a group of friends unable to make progress to building there space castle and well leaving, like nobody is asking them to have universe shaping impacts but the lack of a route to start walking on a lot of new players will feel like there way to late in joining the game to start building something new.
---
&gt; Maybe this would be the start of a new age of sustained evolution of existing games rather than the boom / stagnate / replace cycle that games so often fall into today. From reading this sub though, it seems like most people (including CCP) see it as a failure thus far which is disappointing. 
---
This sub would love this to happen. CCP have promised it repeatedly. It never actually comes to pass.
---
&gt;THOUGHT THIS WAS IDEA SUBMISSION FORUMS?!
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
No, I'm not mad, but it's interesting and that was a good fight. It shows good fights can be had even when outnumbered sometimes, but using some smattering of lokis to fight double the numbers in machs with fax support isn't gonna be a good fight and painting it as such seems disingenuous. 
---
As far as good fights goes, I don't think 7 people in cyns is a great example of some sort of turboblob either, but it certainly isn't a good fight I guess.
---
&gt; By concentrating all of sov null in one spot, it would be easier for a single mega coalition to control all of it.
---
That is a concern, but there are ways of designing sov to make that a lot harder.
---
Ways that I can think of include
---
- Regions near the center do not have gates to each other. If you want to get from one region to the next, you need to jump, which means fatigue, or go around the "inner ring" which is a lot of jumps. Or even pull the regions just far enough apart that you need to mid in the NPC space in between to land in an enemy region. This means shuffling forces between two center regions is a lot harder than just living in one region, and the home team advantage is larger.
---
- Disable Inter-region Ansiblex.
---
You got to let him have one pure goon request in a list that's otherwise pretty good &gt;_&gt;
---
Thanks grath, this means more than you know.
---
Sov Null
---
ADM changed to be constellation based rather than system based
---
Small change to make all systems in a highly used constellation "hard".
---
Nah fuck that, it's already hard enough to break into a defended, high adm, cynojammed constellation.
---
While they're at it, they can add dps penalties to covops and interdiction nullifier subsystems. 
---
If you fit modules to escape any player interaction, you also do not need the dps.
---
I'm a bit concerned about the "no damage cap" part (except for low power and "wrong faction" FW - uncap away there)
---
A handful of supers/titans shouldn't be able to do a &lt;5 min driveby on a citadel.  They should have to sit there a little bit so it's conceivable to escalate while they are present.  (Not as long as current damage cap though)
---
I see your T E X A S L A W and raise you Cole's Law
---
The dreads didn't even reach the gate by the time we called to pull out of the fight. You did not waterboard, I could have jumped in my apostle the bubble was so poor. What actually happened is we were ill-prepared and didn't have things in immediate jump range.   
---
You claim it to be the waterboarding, it wasn't. We didn't expect you to have so many abaddons, and we came it at a bad range. I blame the dread on grid for not providing a d-scan :P.
---
Thanks for an actual nice reply
---
Diplo
---
Fc
---
Jay, pick one you cant have all the titles
---
Gating anoms is dumb. Very dumb.
---
If youre going to invert the whole map, then there really should be no space in nullsec that's not within dreadbomb range of a NPC null station
---
You started the bashing from your first comment and if you check I actually complimented one of your normal member not the “diplo”
---
Could just move the damage cap much higher so it's a 10 minute shoot instead of a driveby. Just proposals, nothing in stone.
---
However, I think that structures in hostile sov should have no timer. If you aren't prepared to guard your forward citadel (and keep eyes on hostile super forms), it should get reinforced often.
---
I remember somebody suggesting this before: give the caldari a secondary form of ECM in the form of the ability to give target ships heat damage. Maybe have it ramp it up the longer it's active, which makes more sense than on those ludicrous triggy weapons
---
&gt;However, I think that structures in hostile sov should have no timer. If you aren't prepared to guard your forward citadel (and keep eyes on hostile super forms), it should get reinforced often.
---
True.  I was talking about it from the defensive side.
---
Amen, dude
---
That's one of my other proposals. An NPC constellation in every sov region and an NPC region in every Sov region group.
---

---
&gt; Then you learn on Sunday that CCP decides to undo Blackout. What do you do, smart (slightly illegal) business owner? Reverse course and fuck the new game, go back to EVE and hope CCP doesn't pull the rug out from under you again in a week or three?
---
No, you just turn the botting network you *already have* that works with Eve with local back on again. Since all your code and infrastructure development from before blackout is now all valid again, there is almost no investment overhead.
---
A very thoughtful post.  Well done.  
---
I don’t agree with everything, but they are wonderful points to start taking about specific changes.
---
Goon diplomacy at its best I see, sensitive?? It’s not like we’re trading top secrets u fool I’m asking people for help and you came here being a idiot from your first post, also no ones making up u reply??? You choosing to click on here and post total toss.
---
Stop being a whiny little cunt. 
---
Do what we all did and just grind out the SP and isk before you can branch out into PvP.
---
It sounds like people are offering you options and you want to ignore it all to forge your own path, which is fine, just don't complain that it's harder than just joining a megacorp/alliance
---
Skill a thrasher with T2 guns and have you and your Corp mates Zerg while you skill up to real ships.
---
Silly liar!
---
You've never read any DSM in your life much less comprehended it. I have. I am a very broadly educated fellow. Both formally and The Real World.
---
You're throwing around terms you picked up somewhere.
---
Btw if MGTOW has your panties in a bunch, I'm MAGA and NRA too, among other things.
---
I'll understand if you have to go change your diapers...I'll still be here...
---
But that's what they do, You're already gimping the damage for each stab you fit.
---
CCP need to read this. CCPLEASE READ THIS
---
I dont have to remember i am still at that point because it never interested me xD.
---
But i still think the invul is a tad too strong and especially combined with the amount a rorq can mine in its own. The whole mining is way too basic and afk. 
---
Hell i would steal the simplistic mining from warframe where you have to push events to mine. Lets say letting your excavators run through gives you 30% and managing timewindows yields you 4 times as much. The amount of possible minigames which also should be rewarding is plentiful. I think thats one of the problems of the whole rorq mining that its just not active. I mean who would care that rorqs could mine better then 2 barges If you cant multibox them.
---
That could also be done in other aspects of the game to battle dullness. Because currently i see a lot of people even in my corp who play while playing other games since activities arent engaging
---
&lt;3
---
But like why is the module on the garmur in the first place? Like the penalty can't penalize it if its not on the ship, as it shouldn't be on that ship lol.
---
So start from the edges instead of trying to headshot the core ratting space on week 1.
---
What if I buy a year long subscription and go afk in the middle of it? What if I am injured and spend a couple weeks in the hospital while my space burns? 
---
Just remove asset safety for Titans/supers, and remove the ability to asset safety stuff to a structure in a different system. That’s effectively how it worked with stations.
---
You get my upvote just for the effort of typing this out. The suggestions are pure gold also
---
To be fair he did make suicide jokes against someone and encouraged people to commit suicide as a ‘joke’
---
I have a positive opinion about most things except the accel gates on anoms.  Talk about ratting in complete safety....no thanks.
---
Let's be honest this dude is having interesting ideas lol
---
HE DELETED IT
---
HAHAHA
---
You didn't need a new post. You had already made one. You then stated you would contact diplos. I merely requested to not be contacted.
---
Because dank kill mails
---
On a more serious note, exhumers are a few hundred million, while killing them costs 10s of millions, so isk positive, dank kill mails, what’s not to like
---
The problem is AGILE was a good idea, but now is a buzzword. Agile is now a word for Curriculum Vitae / linkedin, and is strange find business using it as must be.
---
I hate in my own RL work, as developer, many self called "scrum leaders" "agile customers" and get sometimes twenty days to get answer for a ticket of a dumb item they do.
---
Agile need respect and trust and quick actions with customers. CCP dont do.
---
I disagree on low powered citadels having no asset safety.  reason is especially when players take breaks - they won't KNOW if a citadel goes to low powered.
---
You weren't saying you were going to start contacting the normal members either.
---
-Because harvesting salt is fun
---
-Because they want to mine where you are mining
---
-Because some people just like kicking over other people's sandcastles
---
-to teach a lesson
---
-easy way to boost your billboard
---
-miners can be a look pinata with fun blue and purple modules
---
Take your pick, lots of reasons
---
ive krabbed more hours than most people, between rorqs and abys. ive fed over 100bn in the abys (srsly dude made a klakulator to add it all up. fuck im bad). i love the krabs. i srp quite a lot of the people i kill thanks to it. just the other day i spent all weekend roaming 7 regions. the only non bot i found, in 7 regions, was 1 gila.
---
i killed that gila. sent him 2x his ship value
---
and installed classic wow instead.
---
stellagg is recruiting btw. 
---
my problem isnt that people dont want to pvp, its that they dont want to pvp and then complain about not having non-pvp options to defend themselves. 
---
retarded hunters went MUH NULLSEC KRABS so they took away local and nerfed all the krabbing stuff so hard there wasnt anyone to shoot. thats lame
---
now its back to auto local so the intel bots are back in action. 
---
at least people are undocking again tho, so can use a blue hunter to get em at least but really wish we could have a nice middle ground.
---
You don’t want CCP controlling who dominates nullsec. T20 was bad enough, and all he did was give Bob a Sabre bpo (and a couple ammo bpos, but those weren’t nearly as valuable)
---
Lol I'm a BF fanboy but BFV is pretty trash, I still play it because I can't not but it still pains me. Here's hoping the next project is Bad Company 3 with some of the team that made 1 &amp; 2.
---
No you didn’t just say that though, did you? You were rude and not “diplomatic” makes you sort of moot as a diplomat
---
See, that's what I don't get. Is it a "dank" killmail? The Hulk can't defend itself, of course you can kill it. Is it really an accomplishment?
---
It's been a while since I did any sort of PVP, but I do seem to recall that it was the fighting that was fun, not the being blown up.
---
I love factorio when first starting out with red and green science but after that it gets way too arduous.
---
Not one of those suggestions will break up stagnation.
---
You mentioned the low end ores and intimated that they were worthless. Then why mine them? If they have enough value to mine, they have enough value to steal.
---
What you are talking about is a 200 mil ship being blown up by less than 10-15 mil in throw away dedtroyers. Its an easy way to get your pod too which could be expensive as well.
---
Their are some pvp mechanics here that should be understood before risking such an expensive ship that has no tank. Consider this, how long will it takeyou to mine back 200 mil vs, using a t1 barge and mining that ships ore amount tu regain isk. Especially in hignsec its... painfully obvious that the risk vs reward isnt there.
---
Former FCON pilot, we were in our citadel in Immensea, waiting for a corp roam. Suddenly we get a mass disconnect, and when we log back in the citadel is gone. Completely gone. Next day it reappeared in the same place. I guess the Immensea shard had a bit of a fit, because alliance chat reported lag, but no other incidences of citadels vanishing completely. Very funny situation.
---
I'm not being antagonistic, you are.
---
lol, failheap, the only forum worse than this one.
---
Please don't drink early in the morning anymore, for the kids.
---
&gt; you place upon that person all the imagined sins of The Imperium
---
don´t flatter yourself. people just laugh at them because they are bottom feeders without any drive or ambition. same reason why people laugh at any line member of other nullbocs.
---
I'm assuming the return of blackout. Without some sort of mechanical safety, ratting subcaps in blackout just eat shit over and over with no counterplay.
---
https://i.imgur.com/JgqvnhZ.png
---
Meanwhile the real moneyprinters were basically unaffected.
---
https://i.imgur.com/KAowIQC.png
---
If CCP rolled this out as a patch right this minute I'd be pleased with it, even knowing that I don't necessarily like all of those proposed changes
---
Yeah lol. I think it's fine for the game to be harsh, I'm not sure completely new players should be subjected to inexplicable deaths (from their inexperienced perspectives).
---
You'd be surprised how many highsec miners fit ridiculously expensive mods on their barges.  Like faction shield boosters, those crazy expensive mining laser upgrades, etc.  Not to mention the blingy pods they often have.  So yes, the typical miner barge gank isn't all that special isk-wise, but sometimes you get a real loot piñata. 
---
Also, don't discount the isk you can extract from people who don't want to die. I've made hundreds of millions from various highsec ransoms in just the past month or two.  
---
Lastly, as others mentioned, highsec miners tend to spew the world's greatest amount of salt.  I've had my mother accused of truly horrific acts in at least three languages.  I find a certain entertainment value in that as well.  It's a game after all, but some people don't see that.
---
YES IEPITAN TITANS
---
Goons provide content both ingame and out
---
Spodbless
---
Some people just want to watch the world burn.
---
There are people who can't get off unless they are picking on people who can't fight back.
---
That would be more tornadoes than it might be worth.  An active tank orca can more easily be overcome than other variants, however it seems more economical to beat him in a game of attrition.  Defang his drones, bump him off station, and proceed to grind his face into dust.
---
Rising freaking ADM.
---
I can't make that promise.
---
I wish I could upvote you twenty times. If those changes to stats and implants and skilling were added, I'd actually go pvp. And I'm as carebear as they come.
---
&gt; why then wanting to travel across 30 systems for hunting easy target ? because they are easy target ? there's something not very coherent with the "pvp" idea one can admit, right ?
---
because the game is basically dead everywhere else and has been for years.
---
also "weekly changes" then having 2 changes over the span of 2 months... also kinda erodes trust.
---
If all you want is kills, why not just smartbomb the Jita 4-4 undock? That's sure to net you more than one kill. 
---
What lesson is there to teach?
---
The rest of the reasons I guess I can understand, although I can't fathom why anyone would bling out a mining ship.
---
There wasn't really any salt though, we went "gf", they went "gf" and we warped out, got a new Hulk.
---
The whole thing is just weird to me, like the whole thing cost them like 5*25 million, for a kill worth twice that. Is that really an an accomplishment?
---
But, I mean, I guess it's just part of the Eve experience. Sometimes random strangers waste everyone's time.
---
Everyone can fight back.  Some just choose not to, or don't know how.
---
I take back everything I said about you. I mean not really, but this is a great list of changes. Some of them are interesting and I'm not a fan of, but overwhelmingly good, and well reasoned.
---
Yes it hurt to say that.
---
I'm assuming the return of blackout. Without some sort of mechanical safety like accel gates, ratting subcaps in blackout just eat shit over and over with minimal counterplay.
---
Agile development is great; so is being able to pay salaries.
---
How many bots are ran by people with employees, as opposed to people just running 100 bots in their spare bedroom?
---
That’s why I didn’t say good changes.
---
It *IS* a good post though.
---
and you also cannot see local or dscan while gatecloaked ;)
---
My body is ready.
---
-Why not smart bomb jita: can't smartbomb inside 5000m of a docking perimeter.
---
-lession to teach: get out of our space
---
-bling out a mining ship: maximize your yield per hour
---
-salt: while you may not have, miners tend to be very whiney. Don't know if a miner is one or not until you start harassing them.
---
-hulk cost: yes because you do it enough and it looks great on the killboard. Like a positive k/d ratio.
---
Risk v reward.
---
But first, I see you got the usual “man up or gtfo” reply’s. this sort of post invites the trolls.
---
Ganking in high-sec gives is without any risks, you get throwaway ship (or ships) and you blow up expensive stuff... it’s mostly KB stats, few are for profit.. and some are for extortion, but also to remove unwanted competition for resource.
---
So ask yourself, where does my loss fit in with that !
---
Just swap clones in a citadel, no cooldown.
---
I never said they were worthless. I'm just wondering why you would throw away like 5 Catalysts worth like 15m a pop away for 4 cans worth like 4m a pop.
---
Some interesting ideas for sure, thanks for posting.  
---
Just like on earth, resources should be a major driver for conflict.  Currently we can take over relatively small amounts of systems and have plenty of resources for your needs and more to put on the open market.  Some of this is due to the same number of systems we've had but with lower overall player base and possibly higher distribution of players in large alliances.

I'm far from a resource expert in EVE but is there any resource you can only find in certain constellations/regions that is critical to industry?  CCP could generate some content and manage economy by redistributing materials and tweaking the caps and regen rates of resources, an example of the concept:
---
* Common stuff everywhere.  
---
* Uncommon materials in greater supply of certain areas in each constellation/WH space, lesser supply elsewhere.  
---
* Rare stuff in only certain regions/WH space and in limited quantities in majority of those places.  Very small amounts found in other regions.
---
A few other related opportunities:  
---
* Minutely tweak caps and regen rates over time to slowly shift the "hot spots" or even to shift the economy as a whole.
---
* Introduce resource fields for explorers to "find" and sell bookmarks to (similar to DED escalations).
---
CCP doesn't have to make null dangerous, they don't need to nerf Rorquals.  They only need to shift where the wealth is available.
---
\&gt;3) what kind of sextoy are you?

A Hulk isn't that big of loss though. It's just annoying having to truck somewhere to get a new one.

max tank everything - if you want more dps just bring more ships. you're not limited to 10 players in an instanced dungeon here.
---
Thank you for informing us of the life and times of parody gimmick accounts on Twitter. Truly riveting.

I think a better way of encouraging inter-regional war would be to unbalance resource distribution. People used to fight for regions because the moons or truesec was better than what they had. With upgradable anoms and the moon goo reseeding there's almost no reason to fight for a region that's comparable to the one you're in. There's no reason to play king of the hill if there's no hill.
---
I don't  think that occurred to him.
---
cool, so you can just camp gates for a guaranteed kill. don´t even have to catch people on grid anymore. 
---
im all for it.
---
More like they spent half that to kill a hull valued at 300mil.  Seems like it was a good trade in their eyes.
---
Yeah, those strip miners and survey scanners are such OP mods.

I'm definitely interested and keeping an eye on it.

Well, I can see why you'd stay out of PvP, it's largely dominated by feminists in EVE. 4th wave primarily.

I wanted to hat gons this post but I see very little wrong with it. Good proposals.

I'm actually quite "diplomatic" when doing diplomacy. This isn't a diplo problem. I am honestly sorry for writing that I was a diplo. While I am, I generally try to keep the CD name as untarnished as possible. But this isn't diplomacy. It is someone who realized at least 6 years later that selling a character was a bad idea declaring his intentions to spam members of CD. That bothers me as many people start at the beginning of the list if they don't have an assigned diplomat. So I read this as I should prepare to get some random guy on Discord trying to get me to do something that I have no desire to do. I don't know who owns that character, I don't have that level of ESI access.

But, you win. I'm an asshole. Oh seven oh slash.

Rattlesnake with 4x HAMLs (Inferno Javelin), 2 Target Painters, Therm and Exp active shields, X-Large Booster + Shield Amp, cap rechargers &amp; drone amp/BCS in lows.

I answered you above as to why I personally gank people.  Sometimes it's as simple as I want to kill something but I don't have the time or interest in roaming 30+ in null or scanning down a wormhole chain.  In that case I'll just go nuke the nearest retriever.  It is what it is.  Sounds like you took your gank the right way - a "gf" in local, and on about your business.  Don't start getting salty on r/eve about it.  It's a PvP game. Sometimes the PvP isn't consensual. Simple as that.
---
Here's the thing, how much better does Malpais have to be in order to make it worth for goons to leave delve and invade Malpais? Probably not good enough to justify giving up all of Delve because there's no way to hold both regions at once. So what happens is one group sits on the hill of best region, and the next strongest group sits on the hill of "second best region" 50 jumps and 40 light years away. The spacial separation prevents conflict.
---
It's not that hard to tweak most blops ships, but the Widow is a special case - it's protected under Texas law.

What's an Anathor?
---
Alternatively, if we just make it less painful to actually fight a sov war, people will probably start to fight aov wars again. Especially if the other discussions on making resources more scarce is implemented to encourage border spread.
---
I mean, the reason so many Domis and Myrms were killed is also because the VNI got nerfed, so they became so much more popular and widely used. You gotta compare subcap ratters kills pre-blackout (which is basically only VNI) to during blackout (which is a mix of VNI + Domi/Myrms).
---
Because the ore plus the fit could possibly give me more ISK than the value of my ships. Especially if I use that now free ore to make more ships to gank with.
---
I don't mind those responses, me and my buddies could have paid more attention; we could have docked the hulks on our Orca (that they didn't have enough firepowe to kill) or we could have kept an eye on local and seen the red flashing icons.
---
We did none of those things, so the loss was more or less on us.
---
That's not really the point of the post though. I know what I /think/ is the reason people do these things, but I am genuinely curious to hear from the people doing it why they do it.
---
Catalysts were probably T1 fit, so maybe 3m each.
---
People gank cause it's fun.  They're probably reading this post and having a good chuckle.
---
Practically, it's also good to practice ganking in lower leverage situations before going after the juicy targets and risking losing them.
---
is it about being able to read the clock?
---
&gt;This change gives 39 base SP/min for all skills, which is 1 more than an optimal remap currently.
---
Please make it 40 to appease my OCD.
---
That's totally false lol... The rewards did not increase substantially... They were virtually the same. A few modules increasing in prices doesn't equate to 30% across the board... Ratting was identical income, and way more risky.  Abyssal sites isk/h decreased by 5-10% as more people ran them.  Not 100% sure on ore but the few times I rorq mined there wasn't a noticable increase in Ore prices....
---
You cared enough to make this comment. :P

Maybe these guys are in the hulk selling business.

Best not to try and understand the weird things people do. There be some scary things hiding in some people's heads.

If you are giving everyone a skill at level V then the skill should just be removed from the game.

 "What does it gain you? Best case you get some mining lasers, maybe some  crystals or MLUs; most expensive part of the Hulk is the hull. Do you  want those cans of delicious low-end ore? Is an unarmed mining ship a  juicy killmail? "

Well, you are forgetting the currency of SALT! maybe you are lucky enough to get some smack in local or an angry eve mail. If you are really realllllly luck you get a salty reddit post xD
---
Ganker for Profit btw
---
40 isn't divisible by 3 so it's not possible to have 40SP/min with even stats. I don't trust CCP to hard code in 40 base SP/min and not break something like wipe out everyone's skillpoints.
---
30% is BS... one module increasing has nothing to do with blackout... Module prices swing 10-30% all the time for a wide range of reasons... And using a few ded site modules to determine the value of Pve In nullsec is flawed in so many ways... DED site running if I had to guess would account for MAYBE 10% of nullsec income.  The majority of it is mining/running anoms... Not the three random dudes in your area that actually run DED sites.
---
local scrambling also generates dubstep

Except they did not get the ore, since pods can't haul and we just picked it up. Even looted the Hulk wreck.

Agility not scan res is the real win. You wanna be more safe, coolie doolie I get to punch you in the face for longer so now you need to actually fit a tank rather than relying on the stabs to save you.
---
Industry needs changed more than just increasing/redistributing what ships require what, but in general good post.
---
I think they tried that and result in the worst failure known to video gaming
---
I like a LOT of these suggestions :) but the w-space ones are bad. Given there are only two, and neither one is good, maybe stick with the NS changes :P
---
#1 More frigates are not necessary. Just make the existing rats scram.
---
#2 There already is a delay, because you need to scan the new hole after the sig appears. Despite what you hear, ratting in w-space is never safe (I’ve hazed my fair share of dreads and nestors in C5 sites) - people can always roll in. 
---
The issue with catching people in sites is MJDs: since they don’t scram, a BS can just MJD and leave. The rats already point you in most wormhole sites. Just make them scram instead.
---
Even though this is true it seems like ccp is supporting this as a profession. I got ganked today because I didn't know that you might randomly land short when you warp to a station (a mechanism that is there to support gankers, I can't see any other reason they don't fix this).
---
The problem I have with suicide ganking is that the ganker faces no consequences, he can jump in a new ship and do it again. This is just too unrealistic, I mean in real life you will go to jail for stealing in this case nothing happens you don't even get a kill right.  So no Concorde \*doesn't\* punish crimes that's my problem.
---
Also I'm a little bit annoyed that I'm playing along with people that don't mind ruining someones day like that but that's another story. They are probably awful people and have no friends in real life so whatever let them have it
---
Some people, especially gankers and many PVPers and more than a few PVEers do not play the game with much economic logic or they get pleasure from things that make no sense to anyone thinking economically even in terms of ISK or time.
---
My classic example, that has happened more than once in various forms, is a moron who spent several hours trying and failing to kill my two million isk Rifter in a multi billion isk T3 cruiser ( checked his most used fit for that type ship he often used and occasionally lost on zkill) and also while completely failing to prevent me from achieving each and every one of my objectives.
---
Meanwhile said blingy loki could have been doing MANY other things far more profitable and in my opinion much more fun.
---
In short, there's a surprising amount of damn fools in the game but that's true of IRL too!
---
As for "salt" I always laugh my ass off on the rare occasion someone "wins" by killing one of my birds because the VAST majority of time they do it in something or somethings WAY overpriced AND my hulls have already paid for themselves many times over.
---
The only time my kill vs profit ratio is fricked is when I first learn to fly a new hull. Very soon that,after I learn how to use that particular bird for it's particular purpose, by the time you manage to kill me I've profited enough that I give NO shits!
---
Rather than set timezones, citadels use the Strontium system from Towers. No stront, no timer.
---
Stront as a system works better than set timezones.
---
No it does not.
---
Well... The problem of the Agile method, is that it become popular at the same time than a specific principe who counteract his goal : *The final user don't know what he really want. When he ask something, it is not what he really expect.*
---
tl;DR, don't believe him, but still make it the center of your process.
---
Strangely contradictory...
---
This principle was a response to some commercial failures applied in real-world economy, like the new Coca-Cola in 2000 or the Wallmart experiment, who ended badly.
---
And it is true that you can't expect a user to fully understand all needs or consequences of everything he could ask. Mostly because **they don't care anyway**. A supermarker user do really care about the space to circulate between displays and stuff, and what it will cause ? No, he just want to buy what he needs so that he go home fastly.
---
But here, we are in EVE Online.
---
Most of the "users" has DECADES of experience on video games if not on EVE itself, and we do care because at the end we realized that we wasted YEARS on it and we don't want to lose it "just like that". We use spreadsheets, create softwares, wikis, etc. and many things that a simple supermarket user would have never done in his life, we are dealing with the gameplay mechanics everyday.
---
But CCP rather respect said principle and don't listen to us.
---
Unforseen (for CCP)/Predicted (for players) consequences happened. On the first posts of the first topic about the Blackout, everything was already predicted (especialy this one) :

So CCP should listen to us to avoid a disaster, a few like the devs of No Man's Sky which permitted to ressurect the game, and maybe SWG would still exist today if the dev listened. So yes you will hate this lesson but it is the best way to deal with an ecosystem like EVE who survived more than a decade...

It will be a tedious work to find the good ideas in the vast amount of posts on this subject, but they can do it... if they want to... But that, I doubt of it.

Sorry if u thought I was going to hurrahs you all I was going to do is ask if you came across the person could u lead them to the post and if they aren’t interested no problem :). But ok feedback taken I’ll not contact you.  Also I wish I was just 6 haha more 8/9 😬
---
We're talking about a number of changes here. No invasion makes a lot of sense with the mechanics we have. If it becomes easier to take out structures and sov with the other mechanics you've suggested, it becomes more reasonable for another group (or group of groups) to invade.
---
I want to add to your citadel list something I saw earlier, where low-power structures stay that way for a week, and then go to no-power. No timers, all the same other stuff as your low-power stuff.
---
Once it's in no-power, there's no asset safety and everything in it drops.
---
We didn’t bring Machs when you toasted our space, we brought random shit and zero fax. That was a different fight.
---
To a small nanogang, an 8 cynabal fleet comp means no fight. Considering they were in a comp that was comparable to ours before they reshipped, it was a pretty active attempt to avoid an interesting fight
---
Haha it definitely gets.... Crazy. You start to get stressed or overwhelmed with how you're going to achieve things(purple science oh god) with biters trying to fuck your day up.
---
But yea i like that arduous task somehow it was still nice and relaxing.
---
Eve I guess doesn't have anything arduous or interesting to figure out...? For pve that is. Just copy fit  go run site hit F1. While this can be said about factorio as well. The mindset of the community pushing forward the idea of fun and ingenuity over min max has made me never once copy a base.

Not for you poor GSOL people, but for people who don't like fighting in AUTZ it is.

No there aren't.  At least not around these parts.

Please stop posting
---
See now we are getting somewhere.
---
Why is it fun? This is what I don't understand, the people you are ganking literally cannot fight back, so it's not like you get to feel like you outplayed someone.
---
So, is it fun to you because you know that your actions are upsetting (or at least mildly annoying) another person? If so, why do you find it fun to be upsetting or annoying?

CCP accidentally remove Power Grid Management instead of Biology, EVE unplayable for a month while Icelanders are out enjoying the 1 month of the year where they have good weather.

And then you hit the core constellation and your idea strips away one possible way to break the jammer wall.

If they didn't have a scooper then they were doing just for the lulz, which, to be honest, is q perfectly valid reason.
---
Well...that's a stupid ship to bring to a 0.3 system...
---
All NPC regions have at least 2 gates to Empire/other NPC regions.
---
I think they are too effective inside their range, they essentially project a zone that screams "please bring high-sig ships into this area"
---
I do think that if HAW dreads were more susceptible to EWAR, that it would be more in line with what we need.
---
Agree with a lot. From Skill/Learning/SP over most Citadel changes, to Caps and everything.
---
But some of it is a little too extreme. Removing Docking from low power structures is idiotic if you also remove asset safety. I mean how are you supposed to get your items out if the CEO of a small corp where not everyone has fueling rights has an accident and goes to hospital? You and everyone else is completely fucked and has no chance to get the asstes out of the station with none of it being his fault. That's too extreme.
---
Just an example that some of your ideas are not entirely thought through and hurt small corps/alliances WAY more than you might think. (Yes, technically and in theory everything can be avoided, but that's not the point here).
---
Still thank you for the effort, that's a lot of good stuff there. :)
---
No you can't. The only move you can even make is to not play. Because you have no way to attack or intercept the gankers.
---
how about a tldr asshole

Even lorewise... Civillian ships are likely to be prepared to fit "measures against piracy", like WCSes. Where combat ships are usually build to be exactly where they are, when attacked... Theoretically...  
---
K, we all know there is times where we wish our PvP-ship wouldnt be where it is atm :D
---
Great ideas! I have one to add:  
---
For citadels, create a cap based on the size of the citadel which determines how much M^(3) can be stored in it, just like how POSs were. There would be two hangars in citadels: personal and corporate. Personal hangars have a much smaller hangar and item bay capacity than corp hangars. All assets in corp hangars DO NOT go to asset safety. They drop as loot when the citadel dies. Assets in personal hangars go to asset safety, but at a great cost. For keepstars, this would mean a max of 1 (maybe 2) supers can be docked in a personal hangar; or no supers can be kept in personal hangar, only in corp hangar. This would force filthy rich krabs to either sell their supers or acquire coffin characters just to keep them.
---
If you want to alleviate the concern - maybe like a abyssal type combat zone around the area to prevent people from just coasting off and sniping the site at 150km perfectly safe.
---
Good point, I had a brainfart not including VNI.

Still a spike but not nearly as drastic.
---
A for effort.
---
Why is it funny to annoy people?
---
The biggest issue with supercarriers is that they shouldn't just be Bigger Carrier that Does Everything Better. They should fill the same kind of niche that they filled in the pre-Citadel age, where they were reliant on support ships to help deal with things that weren't caps (skynet not-withstanding). Leaving Space Superiority fighters on them is tricky, as it makes them a direct counter to carrier's DPS as a whole, but I can see your argument here.
---
As for support fighters... Dromis and Sirens need a major rework. No one uses the other support fighters because they just aren't that useful, which is in itself a problem, but Dromis and Sirens are troubling just because of how oppressive they are to fleets. They are part of the reason why the meta relies on stuka fleets/fast HACs for Rorqual/super ganks and exits, because anything else is gonna get tied down and murdered.
---
I'm really not sure how support fighters can really be adjusted without totally removing them from the game, which may be the optimal route.
---
As long as we can light covert cynos inside an accel gate, I'm all for it.
---
Agreed. I should have been more precise though: Hillmar said the implementation would "not be trivial". That this is because of legacy code is my interpretation.
---
More worrysome I find CCP Burger's comment on this issue, namely that " this is were the conversation has been for some time. And we keep the conversation alive." it seems to be a "vision" thing to them, not something they are actively working on.
---
Rifters Online. I like it!
---
It was a "feature" that encouraged people to stay docked up for far longer periods of time.  It's gone and I thank bob (you too Darwin) that it is.
---
u/CCP_Falcon sorry to bug you, but this is a really good post. Hope people at CCP see it.
---
Good point, docking access should be restored but you are still sitting in a structure with no timer, no resists, and no damage cap so it's not a good hiding place anyways.
---
Ahem, ***I said*** "lowsec gate to Stain"...
---
And that's fine and totally good that way.
---
Give them a CPU reduction of 10% per level for expanded probe launchers, and put that same bonus on the astero/ stratios and you have my support.
---
Isn't that simply wormholes? Would be nice to have more null-null wormhole connections
---
Don't mine in populated areas. Go find a remote, empty system.
---
In case you are unaware, jumping to the clonebay of the citadel you are docked in has no timer. Allows you to switch pods for pvp
---
To be clear, TEST didn't take a stance on the blackout or encourage anyone to unsub. That's self defeating and dumb as fuck.
---
We have our share of people who pitched a fit over it, to be sure, but plenty of us supported it too. Myself included.
---
This is what I would like to see as well.
---
I'm not gsol. I don't want my alliances structures to exit when I am not around to defend them.
---

I agree that HIC’s and DIC’s should be able to fit cynos, I just don’t want them on FAX.

---

---
not improving but making EVE 2.0
---
Must have gotten you confused for someone else, sorry.
---
When you undock with a stab fit, it should start the self destruct timer. Just make sure you dock up before it ends!
---
Very solid list. Can get behind almost all of it. 
---
Here are some issues:
---
&gt; Capital Cynoes to Fax
---
Part of the benefit from current cyno changes is having to risk expensive subcaps per cyno. That adds up to the total number of explosions, and opens up different possibilities; including fuck up or outsmart scenarios from each other.
---
Currently a recon can merely decloak and bring in friends until it dies. Capitals do not spawn at the sun, so even a 2 second window is sufficient. It just has to happen in a small timeframe per recon alt. That small timeframe becomes a problem only when groups start to become really crowded. But those crowded groups can organize cynoes, just like they arrange Sabres, etc. It is already nice that fleets require more diverse compositions rather than putting all accounts in capitals. So as of right now I don't think the escalation argument for capital cynoes is strong.
---
Besides, "large null fights" are good, they promote Eve and lots of people enjoy them. But they happen rarely. More capitals (including titans) die in everyday whaling scenarios than large fights. Also player habits are becoming more casual. Optimizing the game around everyday situations rather than large fights (but none of this kills large fights anyway) is the way to go here.
---
&gt; Citadels confined to moons
---
I suggest citadel charters and a consequential monthly ISK cost to combat with citadel spam. With local back, the game is in dire need of more ISK sinks.
---
&gt; Local upgrades
---
Tying local to infrastructure (even if it's a trade off with ratting isk/hr is not a good idea because local is the least needed in places with the most infrastructure. I would instead offer a system in which the more crowded a constellation is, the more non-dependable (delay or even complete shutdowns) local becomes.
---
&gt; Remove FW missions
---
If CCP makes their entrances so that you exit from where you enter (like abyssal traces) they would suddenly become content catalysts rather than content blockers.
---
&gt; 30 second chain boosh CD
---
Niches like spearfishing or excavator booshing are still fine. "Chain booshing" in the sense you're fixing is actually not a problem. The ability to sustain it forever is. There are better options to target that. Such as stacking debuffs, or "booshers and ships getting booshed sustain high rack overheat by X percent".
---
&gt; Cloaks now generate heat while active
---
First of all, you mess up the offensive/travel caps with this. Secondly, cloaking makes the surrounding space less safe. Cloaking itself being safe is less relevant. Calls for nerfs to cloaking actually are calls for having to drop citadels in a system in order to remain afk in it. Eve has enough privileges for inhabitants of a null system. The privilege to remain afk in a sytem shouldn't belong to only to its locals.
---
PS: Nerfing cloaks become justifiable only with pure blackout conditions as cloaks do become OP under it.
---
Do some basic research. Most PvP ships in a small gang require maybe a couple months training. This just sounds like you are being purposefully obtuse.
---
No need, just ask gigx to do it for you
---
If you're in highsec, just go somewhere others aren't and mine.
---
warp away when npcs show up.
---
Or find tiny mining fleets where they will kill the stuff.
---
Then train some basic drone skills so you can kill the npcs.
---
Mostly, people won't bug you in highsec.
---
Also, buy a mining permit.
---
You seem to have taken it pretty well, but some people completely over-react and that can be funny. It's a couple space-pixels and they act like if you had destroyed something of real value. They think high-sec means 100% safety instead of what it truly is -&gt; aggressor is guaranteed to die.
---
Think of the "Leave Britney Alone" meme that got quite popular at the start of Youtube, it got popular because that video is also an over-reaction.
---
Maybe they're selling you hulks bruh
---
Commas, the work.
---
&gt; Harvard Business Review uses EVE Online corps for a study on country of origin and company structure
---
&gt;According to the results, countries which have transparent institutions and predictably enforced laws granted its corp members more decision-making power. 
---
Players are your big concern. There are groups who delight in wandering around looking for miners to kill.
---
There are also NPCs that occasionally spawn, but they are pretty easy to kill if you have drones.
---
Don't agree with all of it, but the good strongly outweigh the bad.
---
This is what expansion patches used to be before 2013 or so. No shitty "patches" that could be summarized with "this ship received 20m³ extra cargo space". A crap ton of changes.
---
Not feeling the golden halo, either:
---
When you show info and see the information of the ship but also a picture of the pilot, place a coloured star for their certificate.
---
Or /and
---
 A logo next to the kill marks on the ship.
---
its still an extra 20 seconds i just have to sit and wait. its super annoying to do 10 times a day.
---
Thanks!
---
I don't believe I stated anything about humor. Making internet spaceships go poof is reward enough, let alone under the nose of those who are trying to be a safe as possible without taking isk/risk level into account. It's beating someone at game on some level, even if you find it below you. I find highsec miners to be below me so we at least have that in common. anything to pew, anything to pve. to each their own.
---
I don't agree with that, having people around 24/7 so you can correctly stront stuff to exit when you want just seems a bad mechanic and what if your the little guys and a single tz? Your post reads like this will fix tz tanking, that was an issue with stront timing back in the day. I do agree however there is an issue with low power stuff.
---
Sadly i don't have a better suggestion to today's problems but i don't see an issue with the 4 hour window on full powered citadels today also.
---
I don't gank a lot personally, but there's two factors:
---
1) I find the relative balance of power fascinating.  A fail-fit [250m hulk](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78966913/) can be brought down by a [12.7M catalyst](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78966919/).  (Kills not mine.).  Somebody else in this thread mentioned that kicking down somebody's sandcastle can be fun.  I tend to agree, especially because...
---
2) Even if you don't ham it on like CODE does, it's fun to role-play as the bad guy with no motivations beyond causing chaos.

Tbh I don't agree with everything either, but if we got that list exactly as he spelled it out I would be happy to take the stuff I don't like
---
Four paragraphs.EVE corps' rules, individual power, and individual autonomy reflect country of origin. Germany good, Russia bad. Hilmar is clueless.
---
Now witness CCP completely forgo ALL of the suggestions listed here and go fumble around with the dying chat system or promise some "amazing changes coming soon" that never materialize, then just leave in October with a fat paycheck from Pearl Abyss...
---
ah yes, armchair expertise widow discussion thread #47892432133742069
---
&gt; Part of the benefit from current cyno changes is having to risk expensive subcaps per cyno. That adds up to the total number of explosions, and opens up different possibilities; including fuck up or outsmart scenarios for each side.
---
The problem with the current plan is that it doesn't stop 30 supers landing on grid seconds after a decloak, which I think is a problem that can only be fixed with a jump spool timer. "Large Null Fights" will still happen a lot, since after the titan/super changes, a Damnation with FAX reps can live long enough to bring in everyone, or multiple damnations with FAX reps.
---
&gt; I suggest citadel charters and a consequential monthly ISK cost to combat with citadel spam. With local back, the game is in dire need of more ISK sinks.
---
Space Value Tax for maximum Space Georgism
---
&gt; If CCP makes their entrances so that you exit from where you enter (like abyssal traces) they would suddenly become content catalysts rather than content blockers.
---
Not a bad idea, but how do you implement it in normal space with CCP Spagetti.
---
&gt; Niches like spearfishing or excavator booshing are still fine. "Chain booshing" in the sense you're fixing is actually not a problem. The ability to sustain it forever is. There are better options to target that. Such as stacking debuffs, or "booshers and ships getting booshed sustain high rack overheat by X percent".
---
Drones aren't ships so I don't think they'd get the debuff. If you can get the boosh ships positioned quickly chain booshing excavators should still work. It's just a lot harder than warp 3 command destroyers in, boosh boosh boosh boosh.
---
&gt; PS: Nerfing cloaks become justifiable only with pure blackout conditions as cloaks do become OP under it.
---
Blackout is the context in which the PvE reworks happen, as gates AND blackout is too much.
---
No, my dear boy, you proved mine. 
---
The first step to recovery is to admit you have a problem, little fellow. I hope you find a better avenue in life; don't forget that salt kills slugs and you best keep away before you shrivel into a raisin.
---
Maybe the better question is why is the gank upsetting to you?  It’s a sandbox and no one play style is better than another.
---
Awesome, I'm excited. Another request is to provide a character name or Corp name where you'd like happy users to send isk donations. :-)
---
&gt;stabbed bubble immune ceptors
---
????
---
This is barely possible right now on an Ares or a Malediction, and that's just one. If you want to fit more warp stabs, your align/agility goes down significantly leaving you more susceptible to the famed instakeres of death. Not to mention that even if you rig it out for agility, you lose valuable warp speed as well which is primarily what travelceptors need for long jump routes
---
Capitals are for alts. Start with getting all frigates to 5 then Dessie’s and so on
---
But you could say the same thing about POSes, which acted as a form of low quantity asset storage without safety. People used to make a living cleaning up abandoned POSes that people had left shit in.
---
I see no problem with small structures having no asset safety, while keeping it for the bigger ones. If you are gonna take a break, you put your valuables into a fort/keepstar or a station.
---
I expected to hate these, but the only suggestion I didn't like was swapping highsec and null. 
---
I don't know enough about FW or capital construction to know if those would work, but I actually liked the rest of the suggestions.
---
inb4 this bait works
---
Highsec? Mining permit? What are these?
---
Long time lurker, first time poster. I m subbed to Eve but barely play once in a while, my char is training skills in his learning clone.
---
10/10 would get back to playing if first points would be added to the game.
---
Learning implants and mapping is terrible as it discourages casual players like myself to even play.
---
Thanks for all these suggestions, it all seems very good to imagine in the game.
---
It’s a stupid ship to bring anywhere, but people do it every day.  You put 1B+ in a paper thin hull and someone is going to shoot you.  These things are all over hisec
---
And 0/ and don't forget 07
---
Agree.  A big part of it isn't even the cost, honestly, it's having to go run around and get all the implants sorted, feeling like you're missing out on SP while you're doing it.  Even though I have all the skills I really care to have and don't suffer 'loosing out' on some pittance of SP by not having +3s in my head for an hour, it feels like I'm missing out.  It feels like I have to 'have a new clone in order' before I can go PvP.  
---
Screw that, let me undock in whatever I want and whelp it and be out the cost of the ship, wake up in a station, undock, and whelp the next one.  I'd gladly crash piles of Meta/T2 fit, T1 hulls (eg, a \~30m fit cruiser or whatever) if it was easy to do on a whim without planning out my clone for fear of non-optimal SP gains.    
---
Learning implant costs disproportionately hurt new players in my opinion -- someone with 'enough money' is just going to plug +5s in and not care when they loose their pod, and similarly not going to care if they miss out on some skill training (Oh no, rank 5 of some ancillary skill is now a day slower) if they don't have +5s for a while.  New players suddenly are set back significantly more by comparison when they're just trying to get core skills to IV and V.

---
Rip PI tho
---
While the book describes the ongoings and story very well for non-players (not heavy on terminology and the rest is well explained), the story itself might not be too interested for non-invested players, and there are a lot of corps/alliances/players/locations that needs to be tracked to follow the story correctly.
---
In contrast, "EVE: Source" is a slightly more lighthearted (though detailed) intro to EVE Online, painting the backstory of the EVE universe from an NPC side of things with a number of (shorter) backstories, art and so on.
---
No im actually new, got it yesterday
---
When multiple lists like this appear you know a game is in trouble. Seen it time and time again over the years. Shame really.
---
I wish players could have any impact on changes, besides stupid spam survey CCP send us from time to time...
---
&gt; Injected SP now no longer penalizes by existing SP, but rather by skill rank. 1x to 3x skill recieve free SP at a 100% ratio, 4x to 6x receive SP at a 80% ratio, 7x to 9x receive free SP at a 60% ratio, and so forth.
---
What do you do about the people who already injected into Titans/Rorqs?  You won't solve the current problems (caused by people who injected in the past) by just nerfing people who might inject in the future.  You can slow propagation of the issue this way, but Eve hasn't exactly got the problem of rampant player growth.
---
if i point it it wont move anywhere.  question is what to do during 4 minute engagement timer when have no near tradehub and no right ship there.. just got  vexor
---
I'm not upset, mostly mildly annoyed; and most of that comes from having to go to Jita for the new Hulk.
---
Jita fucking sucks.
---
I'm responding to the guy that said he enjoyed ganking because people got upset at him when he does it.
---
Ah. Makes more sense.
---
you know how they just love to waste time and resources on shit like that though, right? inb4 DUST 515 announced soon...
---
YOU SEE THIS CCP?!?!?!?!?!? HOLY SHIT IF YOU GUYS IMPLEMENTED EVEN HALF OF THESE THINGS PEOPLE WOULD COME BACK IN DROVES. GIVE THIS GUY A MEDAL AND TAKE MY OVERLY LOUD UPVOTE!
---
&gt;I don't agree with that, having people around 24/7 so you can correctly stront stuff to exit when you want just seems a bad mechanic and what if your the little guys and a single tz? 
---
Then you did what we used to, and set up the stront so it came out 36 hours after it was reinforced.  It got you some TZ tanking, but also made it possible for the bad guys to game it a little.
---
Asset Safety is off only for small structures, which are POS replacements that should have never had asset safety, and unfueled structures, which are space garbage that someone should have unanchored/refueled.
---
There's even a firesale suggestion so if you can't be arsed to asset safety your bulky stuff, you can just firesale it to the locals and leave.
---
&gt; - Local removed from null by default, can be restored by an Ihub upgrade which reduces bounty/LP payout in the system and reduces quality of mining anom spawns. Attackers can disable the upgrade.
---
&gt;Make local a choice, albeit one that is expensive to maintain ala Cynojammer and reduces PvE payout. Attackers that find botting systems and disable the local there to break the bots.
---
I can see people just opening chat in entry systems to get a count of who is coming and going, while keeping PVE rewards high in the rest of that constellation. 
---
Aside from that, the Ihub upgrade for enabling chat and Cynojammer upgrade should be a one or the other type deal.
---
This is what I was thinking reading. All these changes sound good for the most part, but just like NS folks were saying no one understands NS so shouldn't be making change recommendations regarding its health, the same goes for WH. Don't touch it unless you know how everything is actually used. PLEASE CCP. DO YOUR RESEARCH HERE.
---
Play the game on low settings. Try your theories out.
---
A long long time ago, players actually had a say in the matters... those times have since passed... all that's left is a Frankenstein monster type of a game on life support, begging you to pull the plug... but you just won't do it...
---
In many cases, you can ask CODE for a gank SRP and they will send you ISK to refund your catalyst loss. Add this on top of the ISK you make from looting the wreck and it leaves you with a net profit.
---
&gt; The problem with the current plan is that it doesn't stop 30 supers landing on grid seconds after a decloak, which I think is a problem that can only be fixed with a jump spool timer.
---
Question: If the cyno dies before the "spool up" will capitals still be able to jump? If not, then FAX cynoes can be OK.
---
&gt; The incursion like activity pays out part of the bounty as LP, which is an isk sink.
---
You can't combat 60t ISK generation per month (pre-blackout nullsec nullbers) with incursions merely because there is just less amount of people doing it. Blackout was good, but it was also killing the game. We need better, more widespread ISK sinks. Citadels seem to be a really good candidate. Everyone uses them.
---
&gt; Not a bad idea, but how do you implement it in normal space with CCP Spagetti.
---
Anything is possible given sufficient devtime :). We're already assuming there is devtime with many of your proposals. There actually isn't devtime, but it's good to sketch an ideal direction anyway so posts like yours are always helpful.
---
&gt; Drones aren't ships so I don't think they'd get the debuff. 
---
I still think chainbooshing ships for a short amount of time is still fine, and the real problem is "constant booshing" rather than "chain booshing". And I'm a big fan of the overheating idea to solve that.
---
For fun. It is fun to gank people. Try it sometime.
---
High sec...as in systems .5 security and above...where the concord police protect you from players (sort of).
---
and a mining permit. http://minerbumping.com
---
There has to be some way to put a cyno on a ship that can survive for more than a second on a field full of enemy supers.
---
Otherwise there's no way to have a large cap battle.  The second side won't show up because they can't.
---
&gt; You can't combat 60t ISK generation per month (pre-blackout nullsec nullbers) with incursions merely because there is just less amount of people doing it. Blackout was good vs faucets, but it was also killing the game. We need better, more widespread ISK sinks. Citadels seem to be a really good candidate. Everyone uses them.
---
I mean that around 40% of the value of payout of the "super ratting replacement" group activity is LP, and that number is adjustable. This way CCP can tune the isk faucet aspect separately from the rewards for the players aspect.
---
I wonder how the United States stacks up.

---
Get your dessies and cruisers to V and small + medium guns to V
---
Be a solid start to a promising career :) good luck and fly safe o7
---
Do not buy bullshit permits.  Those are griefers.  In fact, search for Goonswarm and CODE and set them both to -10.  And leave system when one shows up.  All they do is shit on new players to “harvest salt”.  
---
As much as people wanna blame the bad new player experience for new player retention (or lack thereof) these orgs (more CODE for sure but goons aren’t innocent) are probably more directly responsible for new players quitting this game than any other influence.  
---
And I’m proud to say I mined in high sec and elsewhere for close to a year and there’s definitely no killmail.  I took the advice given and avoided them.
---
the question becomes quickly to what players do you listen? 
---
Unless you go for a straight majority (and if you do anybody not in null can quit playing today because really the majority is in a limited number of null blocs and well any mechanics changes outside of null are gonna be horrible). 
---
Given even with something as simple as the blackout, there isn't a unified position of the player base as much as a bunch of people with different views ( keep in mind the issue of selection biased here keep the blackout running for 2 years and the majority is quickly the type of player that enjoys the lack of local ) because the players that dislike the current state tend to leave the game more than those that enjoy the current state.
---
So even if such a system does work it's inherently massively conservative with changes it makes as it selects voters based on the enjoyment of the system and then votes on changes among that same population.
---
&gt;Redo the map such that nullsec is in the middle, surrounded by a ring of lowsec, with highsec on the outer rim.
---
One of the fundamental issues with Sov Null is that the most valuable space is at the four corners, farthest from each other. Instead of having a "king of the hill" fight, you have 4 blobs sitting on 4 hills comfortably away from each other. Games generally try to drive conflict by luring/forcing players together towards one point (see Battle Royales and their closing perimeter for an example), Eve's map does the opposite. Having Highsec On the outside rim means that the safest route between two regions of highsec is never through more highsec, but rather cutting through low/null. Pulling highsec apart from each other makes regional differences in resource more accentuated by making transportation more expensive.
---
That's an incredible idea. That would take so much effort to add, and they probably shouldn't even attempt to justify all the starts suddenly moving in the lore, but this sounds like a legitimately amazing idea.
---
The single biggest issue with eve is skill injectors.
---
Suicide gankers are an important reminder to get your shit together.
---
Cause reading is hard.
---
bigger punishment other than sec status loss which directly affects you being able to travel through HS systems, and having your shit insta- blown up?
---
What could you propose that could not be easily circumvented or abused that was fitting?
---
Even if you made it impossible to gank, people would just find some other way to be a shit lord.
---
As it is clear from my recent post, most people who gank, do it because they know they are being annoying. If you made ganking impossible, they'd just find some other way to be annoying.
---
Besides, what would you do to stop it?
---
A lot of people think that EVE is internet spaceships. But they're wrong. Eve is a politics and human suffering simulator.
---
This is the type of comment I was looking for since I wanted to start a discussino but I'm being so aggressively I will just delete I guess the community sucks
---
Its just like real life.
---
You shoot someone in real life and people may shoot you to stop you.
---
You have that put on your record, with convictions and there can be manhunts.
---
It's actually just about the same thing as in real life.
---
Not unrealistic at all.
---
I just came back after a ~5 year hiatus, but what bothers me about null is that there's not even an attempt at resource scarcity.  In hisec, heavy belt mining reduced the amount of ore that respawns, for example.  There's no way to increase plex spawning in hisec, so you're likely to find better belts and more anomns in backwater hisec systems with less activity.  Moon mining is new to me so I'm still trying to wrap my head around lowsec/nullsec ores in hisec.
---
Move to nullsec, though, and increased farming in a system increases the farming potential of that system with the higher-tier ihub upgrades.  This is exactly opposite of how a scarce rescource should work.
---
Also truesec seems to mostly mean fuck all these days, so my half baked idea is to make truesec variable.  There should still be some base truesec value that represents danger potential.  Dead end systems are less dangerous than a highly connected inter-regional connector system, for example, so the base truesec should reflect this.
---
On top of this, player actions should modify truesec.  More ratting/anon running means the NPC pirate threat is more under control, making the system less dangerous.  Deploying stations and cyno jammers should also reduce the truesec, since these structures significantly reduce the riskiness of a system.
---
Ship losses by the Sov owner, if any, would be a way I to lower the truesec due to increased danger.
---
Why the focus on truesec?  Because the other part would be to tie mining/anom quality to the truesec, where ihubs increase the frequency of the respawn rate of the anoms, with instant respawns being a thing of the past.
---
If the same system is repeatedly farmed, truesec goes up and quality of the farming potential goes down.  Thus overfarming encourages spreading out and using more of one's own space and possibly more desire to take other space with better truesec.  And the best farming potential would be found not in dead end system chains, but in the systems with the most connections, forcing more risk for more rewards.
---
I feel it is annoying, but mainly because there’s very little you can do to “get them back”. Unless you have a miner combat ship on hand cloaked and able to point and scram their pod before they warp off, they literally get a killmail worth at least 30 times the ship they flew in with and suffer nothing bad. So, maybe concord points and scrams the pod for 60 seconds and gives some long pop up diatribe about criminal activity, which is long enough for a properly skilled and fit miner to point and scram the offender and pop their pod with drones. It at least adds some level of retribution for the miner. You feel less like some bully’s punching bag and more like a part of New Eden.
---
its a game..

have you never played a FPS and shoot someone ? 
---
do you keep the speed limit in a racing game thats not on a track ?

---
This is a long as fuck read but most of it is really good/obvious. You could consider putting the entire thing in the "little things" suggestion thread and seeing if anyone notices. 
---
One of my only real complaints is the asset safety thing. As usual, I'm a fan of asset safety from pretty much all structures, mainly because it doesn't create a lot of unbalance for people to be able to store shit in a low-power rait and forget about it. I've never seen someone successfuly "abuse" safety in a low-power citadel to get any kind of gameplay advantage. If you're trying to reopen highec pos bashing as a career option, though, you might have an argument. (I'd be fine with a 2-month safety wait timer and an extra 10% tax on the assets, I just don't see the point in removing safety entirely from low power cits.)
---
Also, if this *were* implemented, you'd probably want to make it possible to fuel and online a citadel *while it's taken damage/reinforced*, which is currently not possible iirc. Director-level spies could offline your keepstar, and as soon as it's at 1% shields, you can never online it again! That's a little too good.
---
A stunningly good post.  Disagree with heat for cloaks, but I would cave on that issue to get the rest implemented.
---
No, I don't think I will.
---
I would, however, like to hear why you think it is fun.
---
Eve is a spreadsheet simulator disguised as internet spaceships. I'm just here to do some sight seeing.
---
You won for a long time...
---
CCP should just do a one time move of everyone's shit to the nearest station for free. 30 days to opt out. Repeatedly blaring the notice for another month before that.
---
Not a great solution, but better than Astras in their current state.
---
You're thinking like a business person, not so much like a gamer. 
---
Good on you!
---
I guarantee CCP loses large numbers of noobs who get "molestered" whilst still trying to learn the game and build up a little nest egg before moving on to bigger and better things.
---
Now also guaranteed there are going to be a lot of gamer morons who respond to you, like me, and say Fook The Noobs! And also fook you and fook me.
---
These people know jackshit about business.
---
As I've said elsewhere EVE is a business run by gamers rather than a business that has a game, but is run by business people.
---
I mean I understand some of your proposals do gimp the ISK spam but; people seem like they wanna grind ISK in one way or other, and ISK sinks are always needed. If there is too much sink, CCP can always use that to reward something else meaningful. Tax increases created almost no turmoil so seems like people don't mind sinks that much either. Citadels are just too good an opportunity to pass for a sink.
---
What's funny is that all the people who unsubbed, they arnt coming back just cause blackout ended.
---
No. It's fine. Just don't make it worth it to gank you for profit. And yes messing with newbies should get them in trouble.

Fit a tank?  Mine in lowsec, nullsec, or J space? Warp out when they enter local?.  Factor the losses into your operation?
---
Why can’t a miner do those things?  I know why an afk miner can’t, but someone at the keyboard?
---
I think it's just one of those things that isn't really circumventable. It's part of the game mechanics and not getting HS ganked is pretty easy...

---
ccp take note
---
&gt; Not sure how I feel about adding scram/durability to low class wormhole frigates.
---
These would work kind of like pirate elite frigates in null anoms but on roids. They don't spawn much in low level anoms but most waves in Havens and Sanctums have a few. Higher resists, higher EHP, and faster than regular frigates. Wouldn't exist in C3's and under, but they spawn in C5 and C6 sites to prevent people from just MJDing out on sig pop.
---
The torp Phoenix that bumped and isn't doing anything of value way out there?
---
It's not "technology" it's CCPs unwillingness to fix it. They could simple have a buttonon the esc screen that has return to char select. The problem is switching to another alt gets to quick so you can do something on your main and switch over to lewt or whatever on your alt. Like every miner would have a miasmos on there alt waiting to swap.
---
I only gank if I'm the one setting it all up, the scouting, ship scanning, setting up the warp-ins, handing out ships fleetwarping,etc. All of that work gives it way more value to me than just a killmail, or even the loot. I doubt I would ever do it if I was not, no matter how big the kill.

You really can't if you're in a mining ship. That's ok, non-consensual PVP is part of the game, but it is what it is.

Yeah. On here too just want to blow shit or ruin your dau. With the downvotes. I did warn you Bro. Lord knows I don't give a shit when they do! 
---
The thing is is people on here, especially PVPers react VERY badly when you hit them with any kind of truth bombs.
---
Yea don't buy a "permit" they will gank you more often than not even if you have one
---
Sometimes it's fun to kill something, even if you don't get a profit from it, if it's cheap (which gankalysts are). I don't gank in HS, but I will happily go and gank a venture in a gas site, even though I won't be able to pick up anything valuable it drops.
---
And every kill is a killmark and a green line on the killboard, of course.
---
&gt; - Asset Safety removed from small structures.
---
&gt; POS never had safe assets, their replacements should not either.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Has CCP even introduced any small structures yet?   Right now all we have are medium, large, and XL, along with FLEX structures.   None of those are direct replacements for POS, which is one reason why POS are still in the game.

CCP replaced player built and conquerable outposts that were non-destructible and which one could continue to jump clone to/from without standings, with large and faction large structures.  In the case of the player built and conquerable outposts, there was no need for asset safety because you could use public contracts, public firesales, re-taking the stations, or sneaking out your assets with alts.   CCP has not introduced a gameplay ability to recreate this aspect of the game, and instead we have simply asset safety.

I try to run +4 as my pvp pod, 50m doesn’t hurt all that much once you have isk. Year 1-2 it hurt to lose anything and everything.

Wew lad there's a lot of stuff here:  
---
\- Skillpoint and learning changes: Agreed on all points.
---
\- Structures: Maybe all celestials instead of just moons (sans gates). Allowing citadels to be repped has been said to be practically impossible code wise. 100% disagree on allowing services to be disabled, that completely fucks production and markets in so many ways. All other points agreed.   
---
\- Cyno Changes: Disagree on allowing points to stop people from taking ansiblexes. Please for the love of god add a capital cyno ship that doesn't cost 300+ mil. Agreed on all other points. 
---
\- Space: Disagree on allowing I-Hub upgrades to be disabled, same reason as for citadel services. Disagree on ratting suggestions. Disagree with removing pirate ship BPCs from escalations. 100% completely disagree with the addition of NPC null within 7 LY of all Sov Null Regions. Agreed all other points.   
---
\- Ships: Disagree on all capital points except those related to titan weapons and FAX tank. As a Capital FC I assure you you are overestimating the power of capitals in their current state. Especially disagree with nerfs meant to bring them inline with subcapital progression. They do not and are not meant to follow the same progression. Disagree on bomber damage buff, Holy Shit No. Slight disagree with implementation on Rorquals, but not the idea itself. Agreed on all other points.   
---
\- Pie in the Sky: No you can't completely reconfigure the geography of Eve. Of all the cloak fix suggestion's that's probably the worst I've seen; No. Agreed on all other points.

Given the recent history you really wanna come here saying that it’s deliberate that you can’t simply log to a char select the same way WoW does?  No.  They just can’t do it.  And haven’t tried making it work.  
---
Who cares if you can hit swap to an alt in a miasmos?  All of a sudden joe casual on a single barge account with a miasmos 2nd char is breaking the resource game?  Do you realize how stupid that sounds??
---
Your retriever still warps off on a DC.  All you’re doing in that example is harvesting cans from the miasmos.  Anyone wanting to kill that will simply watch for the two cans to spawn and time how long it takes for the second to pop out (which tells you how long till that second will be full).   
---
No.  You can’t swap because ccp doesn’t want to make that work. There’s nothing intended there

 When an [acid](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Chemical/acid.html#c1) and a [base](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Chemical/base.html#c1) are placed together, they react to neutralize the acid and base properties, producing a salt. The H(+) cation of the acid combines with the OH(-) anion of the base to form water. The compound formed by the cation of the base and the anion of the acid is called a salt.
---
Sorry I meant astrahus as compared to forts and keepstars
---
If you haven't read he glassdoor site reviews for CCP you should give them a glance, and see if you can find the article where one of the developers for the failed WOD game is interviewed. It basically boil down to what you just said plus they pay less than the industry average and their managers have no idea how game development works, so nothing ever gets done on time or the way it should and they constantly change their focus from one thing to another which never gives the actual devs enough time to finish what they were working on before the change of focus.
---
Those who care for you are paid to do so. Only reason they’re there.
---
LP is a massive isk sink, adding more LP is adding more isk sinks, and by tying the biggest isk faucet to LP, you are adding a sink that scales with the faucet.
---
Suppose you ran 6 site with your alliance mates in a hour. You get paid out 90 million isk and 72,000 LP. You cash out the LP at the LP store buying say, 6 ocular filter standards for 72,000 LP and 72 million isk total. The ocular filters are worth 20 million each, so you net 20 million implants x6 and 18 million isk left over. You got rewarded 138 million isk/hour but only injected 18 million isk into the money after redeeming your LP sunk isk back into LP isk costs. The Isk fauct has been cut to 15% without damaging the profitability of null PvE.
---
This carebears question highlights perfectly what is wrong with EvE today, CCP included for listening to them and implementing nerf upon nerf over past years.   Blowing up other players ships used to be reason itself for playing EvE, and not something that needed explaining.  Sad.
---
.
---
100% get what you mean and have experienced the same thing
---
And CCP is one of the best in the business at losing customers. At some point, youd think management would step up and just say "lets try doing the opposite of what we normally do and see what happens."
---
Member when BoB and MC had all the titans and then those titans went to NC/PL after chilling in shitty alliances, and then those guys had them all for a long time and hazed the shit out of everyone with them?
---
I member.
---
Now that goons and  have a bunch the game is bad? In the words /u/absolutetruth “Ok dooood”.
---
That’s a you problem not this guy for failing to write up a tldr.  Asshole.
---
Lowsec is a subset of Empire.
---
What if it became more of a literal donut? 
---
This is Eve 2.0 level stuff, but what if Highsec flowed to lowsec flowed to null flowed to lowsec flowed to highsec again? 
---
Basically, put every system 10j away from the nearest highsec and nearest lowsec?
---
Keep telling yourself that
---
Astrahus is a medium structure.  None of the existing Upwell structure are replacements for POS - part of the reason why POS are still in the game (besides the POS code, ofc).  
---
Small structures haven't been released yet but were supposed to be the POS-equivalent - none-dockable structures that provide a safe haven at similar cost scales to a POS.  
---
Medium structures are substantially more expensive to build and purchase than even large control towers were, and take nearly 25 to 169 times longer to deploy then a large control tower, and are immediately visible on a global overview.  Comparing a medium structure to a control tower - of any size - is not a fair comparison at all.
---
Yeah do it all. I don't agree with everything but at this stage it's so much better than the status quo.
---
We bashed a low power Forizar last night. It was glorious. It popped and a beautiful sphere of yellow container goodness appeared around the wreck. We spent a couple of hours opening all the presents and hauling to loot home. Soooo good. Low power should lose asset security in K-space too.
---
As someone who used to do it, blowing up expensive ships is just kinda fun, dont really know how else to put it. The more expensive the target the more exciting or thrilling the gank is.
---
Nobody is saying you can't blow up ships, calm down with the bait dude.
---
&gt; What if it became more of a literal donut? 
---
So nullsec in the middle, with jove space in the middle of that? Truly the blue donut we all dream of!
---
FUCKING CCP FALCON. YOU IGNORANT, ARROGANT TWAT YOU DONT KNOW SHIT, I'M SICK OF SEEING YOUR FACE ON THE LAUNCHER BECAUSE SOMEHOW I HAVEN'T QUIT YET. GET IN A SAUNA, OR SPA OR WHATEVER THE FUCK IT'S CALLED, WITH HILMAR AND FUCKING STAY THERE
---
I noticed that lol, they will kill any argument against them. Here is what happened today. I accepted a contract, I gank contract probably and got it into an insta-warp ship. Until today I thought that when you dock you are safe, they can't gank you, but today I warped short and had to approach the station so they got me. I lost 1 billion which is stupid but I thought I was safe when docking. Isn't that just annoying? lmao
---
Imagine being so uncreative that you think a dread bomb is the only way to get at someone. Top kek.
---
So, all you want to do is annoy or upset people?
---
Give BSs cargobays worthy of their fat asses.
---
What if we shut off your sub and left it off
---
I don't understand your first paragraph..
---
But moving on I mearly used a miner as a point. There far more ways it can be used. Think interdictor being on an alt. The probes would last long enough to get the main in before it expires assuming you have a decent computer. The retriever will only warp off its it's uninterrupted as well as logged in slow enough. There's been many times I've had a DC and logged back in to exactly the same spot just in time to cancel the warp. Larger ships are a good note for this.
---
But it's exactly because CCP dosent want to do the work. And to some extent I agree with them. If switching becomes to easy and fast everyone will be running two toons off one account. 
---
Now don't get me wrong ccp can absolutely make it so you can't switch too fast when they do "fix" it. But there is no reason for them to beyond awe the players want more Qol stuff that's cute! Get me the skin designers!
---
not sure how someone is going to explain it to you. You dont think its fun and someone else does. Sounds like any activity, some people think skydiving is insane, others its a favorite hobby.
---
I'd point out all the plain dumb things and all the things I agree with, but instead I'll say just two things. A) Implants converted to boosters? No. B) FFS ceptors are absurdly easy to fix. They're supposed to be the zoom-zoom-gotta-go-fast ships, give combat ceptors an extra agility bonus with mwds and make their base agility instawarp. Make them the zoomiest of ships, no expanded launcher/dscan immunity/etc nonsense.
---
Ohh then you have a chance. just get things with nos and can tank it like a vni or myrm or domi.
---
&gt; Suppose you ran 6 site with your alliance mates in a hour. You get paid out 90 million isk and 72,000 LP. You cash out the LP at the LP store buying say, 6 ocular filter standards for 72,000 LP and 72 million isk total. The ocular filters are worth 20 million each, so you net 20 million implants x6 and 18 million isk left over. 
---
Yep. You're forgetting the part where once the massive farming needs of nullseccers are directed to LP the Ocular Filters will be worth much less. The more people farms that LP, the more the Ocular Filter's price will approximate to 12m (the base price) and you'll end up with no profits.
---
The conversion rates of LP to ISK strictly depend on how much LP is being farmed (supply) and how much demand there is for the stuff you can get from the LP store. You keep the Ocular Filter demand the same, but increase the supply, you'll devalue the LP, and it won't be worth to farm.
---
This. This is amazing.
---
One thing I'll disagree with is carrier application. Light fighters should be able to apply well to light ships.
---
Its a big ship that uses fleets of little ships to apply damage. The little ships (fighters) are small and agile and by that reasoning should apply well to small ships.
---
I think a better idea might be to add a subcap gun or ammo type that applies better to fighters to defang them faster rather than just making carriers even more useless. Or maybe some kind of aoe module or bomb that temporarily disconnects the fighters from the carrier to buy some time to reposition and/or blap a few.
---
I fundamentally disagree with this. Large capital battles usually happen by accident - one side or the other miscalculates - the result is a capital brawl. It may be bloody and dispersed, but I expect a battle of keeping cynos alive can still present a way of having future capital fights.
---
&gt; This is not fighting back.
---
Concord kills them for you, whore on their mails with a drone. Laugh in local at their stupidity. I have a civilian railgun on my hauler just for whoring on tornados that fail to gank my ship.
---
Some people do it for the lols, some people do it to bask in the rage and salt from the victim, some people do it to drive off competitors, some people do it for profit.
---
Some people do it because why not?
---
I like your idea of flak. Reminds me of Battlestar Galactica. I imagine it a little differently than you, I think. I think of it as a large turret that fires rapidly, has a medium range and decent tracking, fairly low damage per shot, and causes AoE damage centred around a point a random distance from the target (or based on the hit/miss calculation?) A flak-fit battleship in a fleet could sacrifice its application vs large targets for application vs small ships anchoring up. I can imagine a flak-fit battleship being a counter to a kitey t3d fleet. Make it effective against large groups of smaller targets, but practically useless against a single target. Watch out for enemies getting too close; don't want to damage your friends or even yourself!
---
Before making major decisions, try joining your  Corp into one of the NPC factions for FW. You will get ppl to fight with you in alliance and plenty of ppl to shoot.
---
\*Laughs in upvotes\*
---
Helpful for it to be SCRAM too instead of point (MJD issue). Doesn't add a ton of risk as long as you're not being crazy about it. The emergent defenders adding scram would be good. They're pretty tanky.
---
I’d go a step further.  
---
Let’s say to build a super/Titan requires some npc component.  That was on a maximum quantity allowed in the universe.   Not unlike the palatine KS but it’s on a component that goes into building a super/Titan.  Once all those ships have been build no more of those components will go out.  And these components expire after 48 hours purchased by players, so when you buy one you must start a job inside 48 hours or it expires and allows someone else a chance.  
---
Make the vendor selling it rotate around empire space and require some sort of effort to find so it can’t just be camped on end.  
---
Would this limit the capital proliferation and create huge incentives to kill them?   Push the value of these components to huge levels creating a nice new isk sink?
---
All troll/gank/lul aside - something you may not have considered is that maybe they were miners as well and your hulk was competition. That would make it a legitimate "economic" attack to slow down your corps pace. If you all ship into procurers, or skiffs, they effectively halved what the completion can mine.
---
a structure for pedants
---
I don't think it sounds fun to kill ships that cannot fight back, this is true.
---
Nor do I think I would enjoy upsetting or annoying random strangers.
---
However, I am interested in understanding why people like you find it rewarding to do something that is not challenging and only really annoys someone else.
---
I have, in fact, asked skydivers why they skydive. They gave me nice answers.
---
Self-deprecation probably falls under the "cringe-laughing" umbrella, but what the hell. ;)
---
a pretty solid list man, mostly agree with everything.
---
u/CCP_Falcon. This. Just...this. Please, for the love of Bob read this and actually act on these changes, they're pretty much the only things that will save your game, not to mention your paycheque.
---
&gt; Still give him shit about it.
---
Well I would certainly *hope* so!
---
You know I was going to start nitpicking the 4% of things I don't agree with, but this is such a good list it really deserves serious review and consideration by CCP and the community. If even a third of these things were implemented, it would be so good for the game. It saddens me to think that most of it will never happen.
---
yet here you are
---
Not if you follow the rules.
---
Blackout alone, while awesome for pilots like myself, is terrible as a singular design change.  This game has always needed some sort of skill use intel game mechanic outside of probing.
---
Buff the Target Spectrum Breaker. Obviously it doesn't help slow non-BS against Support Fighters, but it'll at least make BS fair a bit better.
---
&gt; a wh spawned while he was raging, his thany unspawned curiously, a wreck spawned at the same place
---
&gt; he started travelling by gate his moros, 4th jump another wh spawned , the moros unspawned curiously, a wreck spawned at the same place
---
I presume there was a wormhole corp following him around? Talk about shitty luck...
---
Just ping u/CCP_Falcon. Over. And over. Again. Until he finally reads this shit and CCP actually acts upon it. Make it clear that these changes are massively popular among the playerbase, make it clear that they are going to bring huge numbers of players into the game, and make it clear that this will give EVE a 20th birthday where nothing, absolutely nothing, else will.
---
A good chaos change would be that fitting warp core stabs mean that the ship is automatically scrammed if a flashy pilot is on grid in lowsec. Just make the change without announcing it I reckon. 
---
I don't like stabs in lowsec.
---
Look at cheapy cheaps over here not even springing for a t1 and high end faction ammo for whoring.
---
Ocular filter is far from the only LP item there is, and there are plenty of LP stores that would synergize fantastically with what null wants. The concord LP store for example, supplies concord capital mods. I for one don't think that thirst for capital mods is one even nullsec itself can sate.
---
Even if the LP is not worth much, it's still worth it to cash out and that very action will reduce the magnitude of the nullsec isk faucet.
---
Ping u/CCP_Falcon if you want to get stuff to CCP.
---
Welcome to eve
---
It would completely remove supers from the game eventually. Because people owning supers would quit, they would be docked in a keepstar. The keepstar would die and they would be asset safetied to a lowsec station never to be undocked again.
---
As hard as the idea of all supers being removed from the game makes me i don't think that's a good thing.
---
Okay now I'm sold on the idea
---
Some men want to watch the world burn 😈
---
&gt; Eve is a politics and human suffering simulator.
---
More like a pain &amp; suffering threshold test.
---
How much can the player-base withstand before cancelling.
---
what? why has noone run apple out of business yet? well, it´s not because of the valued foxconn employees, i can tell you this much.
---
Issue: Server would get angry much like smart bombs, so in the interests of server performance its single target. 
---
The concept I was borrowing from is the more recent iterations of Capital Ship combat from_Battletech(Mechwarrior expanded universe.)_ where Warships with multiple guns in a turret bay could sacrifice raw damage output for much easier damage application. This is primarily done to gun down fighter squadrons as they carried very little to no fighter scale weaponry to drive off enemy fighters.
---
Yeah just thinking thru ways to make them less ridiculous in quantity and create conflict.  
---
Maybe make it so you can’t dock them anymore at all but you moor them off a citadel which allows you to eject from it but retain sole possession. They can still be shot and killed while moored.  Idk.  Capitals are a big part of a problem that they keep trying different shit to remedy.
---
Losing any ship due to a game mechanic of sitting in place while your buddies "jump in" is inherently stupid.  Cyno mechanics are broken to infinity, regardless of what ship class you use.  Its beyond stupid.
---
Ships with jumpdrives should be able to jump to any celestial object in range - Sun, Planet, or Moon.  Or with 50% more fuel cost, they could jump to a bookmark (personal, corp or alliance).  That fixes almost all problems with them and allows ceptors a great role at bringing in fleets on grid, albeit with less in the gas tank.
---
With the above spool up times, I think it would strike a great balance and we can get rid of cyno alts once and for all.
---
Make cynos for all combat capable cap ships be upwell modules.
---
Merge small, medium and large modules into one module with small stats - balance accordingly and finally close the 'rebalance' task on Jira.
---
isn't the counterplay having response ready?
---
like either be thick enough to not die before help arrives from stsnding fleet nerds or have qrf already sorted?
---
imagine a world where krabs and pvpers worked together to provide content for each other, and shared in profit
---
Ahh that makes sense. I didn't realize smartbombs were that taxing for the server!
---
Take all the items in all fw stores. I am pretty certain you will devalue them hard if you gave their lp as a null linemember main farm reward. And you will mess up profitability of all other activities (missions, fw, arcs) in doing so. That's not a good way to create a sink.
---
You mean [this vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZv7Km-4N1w)?
---
It's not necessary for you to understand to learn from it.
---
If its say, 10 targets, its not that bad.
---
If its 256 targets, We Have Problems.
---
There's no response when you are in a subcap. TTK from decloak to dead is around 20-30 seconds in a myrm. Not enough time for your buddies to warp to you.
---
In an Eve where most people have capitals now, I don't think jump drives should give such strong mobility to these ships.
---

There are no rules... They're a bunch of crooks trying to run a racket stop feeding them isk.
---
- No AFK mining allowed. All miners are expected to remain at their keyboards at all times, and are required to prove their presence by responding in local when requested by the Supreme Protector or one of his Agents
---
Sure what does afk entail to you?
---
How about this one?
---
- Miners should strive not only to avoid botting, but to avoid even the appearance of botting.
---
What does botting look like? Alts? Cuz mining is pretty easy to look like a bot he'll vni ratting is pretty hard to NOT look like a bot.
---
So go on support them give them their isk cuz either way they will kill you.
---
Honestly, the response is sorta memey but the reality is most likely there session system between client is written with the assumption that a new session is needed for a new character.
---
This isn't some minor change and likely would mean a developer digging truth the client code to clear all caches and a mistake in such a function could be massive ( think item duplication glitches etc ).
---
The reality is the amount of development time vs the reward just isn't there.
---
Some of these ideas are retarded such as going back to the terrible stront system

I like your spirit. Can't drink all day if you don't start in the morning.

stop being offensive toward my religion that's extremely hateful
---
We do.
---
Yeah, let's keep the bitterness out of this thread, please. Or is this an actual joke that's just going r/whoosh?
---
Holy moly this is actually really fantastic
---
I, too, take my posting seriously.
---
Miner wonders where's the fun in a more fun activity than mining.
---
Solo mining is slow, but still possible, especially in highsec space. You really need boosts from a command vessel to mine faster. Find friends eventually or provide your own (would need another account though...)
---
You want to fit your ship to have some defense and try to max out the mining power. Venture ---&gt; Mining Barge ---&gt; Exhumers for solo mining. You can use porpise and orca for solo mining using drones, but that's more for afk mining. 
---
A good place to mine tends to be further away from trade hubs. If you mine extensively, look for better rocks. Also look for player citadels with refining so you can compress your rocks to increase their value AND move them easier. You may wish to operate out of an ice mining system as they tend to have these. You can also mine ice when it's around.
---
Moving your stuff to sell, don't autopilot with cargo and fit yourself with lots of hitpoints. Look at your fitting window, simulate it with the ore hauler on the gallente industrial line and fiddle with it until you like what you see.
---
...okay. That's one of the weirder things I've heard happened in this game...
---
You have only been looking through the keyhole my friend... open the door.
---
It's demoralizing for CCP to get all their ideas from players. Let's try to not rub it in.
---
when have nex chance will try this thanks
---
I see where your head is about the 6% of players generating 12T in blue loot faucet isk, but...
---
ExookiZ also stated moon goo, gas harvesting and mining are hardly touched in WH space, partly because the value of T3s has dropped.  The blue loot farmed in wormhole space is not evenly distributed, either, it's farmed mainly by the largest corps/alliances, just like in NS, except without Local to alert to the presence of hostiles and without clear lanes to transport.  Therefore, botting is not as effective, nor is it regular.  Fleets and non-AFK players are generating the isk through GAMEPLAY.  As an example, there's a dude who multiboxes about a dozen Nestor accounts.  If he so much as catches you or your probes on D-scan he immediately warps off, reships to Megas and rolls the connection, or kills anyone trying to catch him in the act, but it's still fun to try and sneak up on him because he's AT THE KEYS and paying attention to his surroundings.
---
Also, many K-space based players use WHs as farms, and there's plenty of empty space still available.  Filling it creates content for every attached chain and everyone in it, unlike in Null Sec.    The J-space PvE doesn't need to be nerfed, it needs to be PLAYED more, because it's unsafe for bots and will only lead to more PvP.
---
u/CCP_Falcon you reading this my man?
---
We can honestly only assume.. ccp has to my knowledge never given us a good explanation as to why. It's always just cuz. I could absolutely believe when they first started someone made it how you say. 
---
My point is that there is no technology stopping them maybe a programmers oversight absolutely but technology sorry no. I don't buy it. Lazyness *read as cost cutting* and programmer oversight is the highest likelyhood as to why it hasn't happened
---
&gt; someone promised him isk for 1000 body
---
And he *believed* them?!
---

&gt; - Pie in the Sky: No you can't completely reconfigure the geography of Eve. Of all the cloak fix suggestion's that's probably the worst I've seen; No. Agreed on all other points.
---
Not everyone has 5 rorquals already, you can slow the bleeding and nerf Rorquals/supers.
---
I been playing for something like 10 years. In all that time, I have had only one Gank attempt on me. This was back in the day when hulks were the meta. A tempest and a frig tried to kill my battle hulk. I happened to be afk with my drones out. When I got back I found both the tempest and the frig dead. It was a very funny lol mail. In short there is plenty you can do to either avoid ganks and/or respond to them.  As for why people do it - because it is fun. The whole point of open world pvp is bringing pvp to people who don’t want to play the way you do.
---
He deson´t want others to be able to get access to his golden cow. More level playing field ruined the game for him.
---
Bad post is bad
---
Yep. Watching that rattle get clapped brings me joy beyond words and fuels my dream that some day Arty nags will become meta.
---
This made me lol. A++ master troll.
---
Back in the day there was only one way to build supers. To setup a pos and fit it for the construction of them. This array could build one titan at a time. You had to own the sov to get this going. Poses could easily be destroyed during the manufacturing process allowing attackers to loot the unfinished remains of the super to use in their own super construction or to sell. 
---
This created a significant bottleneck for the production of supers. The number of poses you owned that could build them. Today a single Sotiyo can produce as many titans at once as your character has both the materials and manufacturing slots to do so. Can you see the pattern of the problem emerging considering massive increase in raw resource injection as a result of buffed rorquals?
---
Assuming you have more experience with smartbombs than I do, when do you typically notice a slowdown when using them? Just if there's a lot of ships on grid, or if a lot of ships get hit by it?
---
Trust should have been eroded just based off how often they balance problematic mechanics or ships. CCP holds off on iteration and then does a kneejerk fix to whatever thing is deemed a problem. This isn't new behavior.
---
Also, why should a mining ship be able to defend itself against a PvP ship?
---
Does this in mac as well, the solution I found was to buy a Windows 10 PC and play Eve on that
---
Yah yah to this.
---
&gt; In short there is plenty you can do to either avoid ganks and/or respond to them
---
You haven't outlined anything that qualifies as fighting back. I am not and was never saying that there was nothing proactive that you could do about gankers. Just that you cannot meaningfully fight back against them.
---
Sometimes, absolutely.  If I have 30 minutes to log in on a given day, you bet your ass I'm going out there and interacting with someone.  Other days I feel like a roam and a fair fight so I'll hit null or J space. Just depends on my mood.
---
Eve's been around so long I'm sure it's a huge  data mine for all sorts of not only corporate but sociological findings.
---
Why should a mining barge be able to stop a PvP ship?
---
Fax changes like this would annihilate wormhole fighting, but otherwise I agree with quite a bit of this.
---
Frigate V
---

---
Yeah agreed BF V is arguably not the best effort in the series.
---
Lol I'm still wishing for a reboot of BF 2142.  I loved that one but it was not well-received by a lot of the other players.
---
You can be alert, have scouts, use intel sources.  Your mining barge, by itself, should never be able to win a battle against a PvP ship - even a ganker.  But there are ways to "fight back."
---
So remove the free stabs that titans and supers get as well?
---
&gt; hen there are people who loved the blackout and who will leave the game
---
There is no way to keep these needy, feely types satiated and keep the game financially successful. 15 years without blackout and they'll quit if they don't have it?  Yeah? 
---
Blackout was a financial disaster that CCP was forced to take back or start canning more employees to make the financials look right. It was the wrong way to implement the removal of local or development of intel.  Want blackout? CCP can't coexist. We need thoughtful development that solves the same issues.
---
What matters is we lose a lot more players with blackout than without it - in addition to it being a pisspoor way to address the development of intel. The company was supposed to be working on this for several months. CCP doesn't walk back hilmars vision without it being a complete disaster for the game.
---
This is a niche sci-fi game and its sure not for everyone, not the super-niche crowd that doesn't undock but spends 3 hours a day making podcasts about a game they haven't know about for years - and not for the turbo krabs who got nailed with several anom/rorq/carrier based nerfs. 
---
Can't speak to feelings or how the minority lost their golden era, they don't matter enough to be the games development focus unfortunately. Everyone loves EVE except for _______. It's a game for a hundred thousand people to enjoy - not 200 goobers.
---
Mentally ill people who quit because they thought CCP was wielding a sword for them to kill goons or test or PH mega groups simply need to come to terms that those mega groups house the entire playerbase - they choose to quit instead. CCP isn't their pocket developer - isn't falcons, isn't mine. 
---
As far as those unlikely to return - maybe CCP will take the hint and not take sweeping risks with their game mid-transfer trying to chase financial incentives instead of losing money putting chat back on their servers. CCP will continue to attempt to move features to the cloud without ANYONE to write code for how it should be handled. The result? bad local that swaps channels or is inaccurate. Can't wait for 10,000 v 10,000 battle where the cloud loses the doomsdays and plays the battle out-of-order and in the wrong system.
---
What sucks? Blackout was really cool and has aspects of where the game needs to be (if we can make it there). It was missing too many components but would have been great with some actual development time or thought. Blackout won't come back - chat won't move off cloud and CCP won't hire someone to smooth those problems out, so CCP will think of other ways to target the goofy way chat doesn't work and future design goals.
---
They waste their own time too , but generally for many empty brains , the fun of that 10 seconds action is enough.
---
After all, the definitive reason is : because they can.

Wormholes fought just fine when we only had Triage Carriers. The power of FAX is arguably inbalancing in wormholes since it ups the critical mass of relevance to the much higher tank of a FAX, and they can't be neuted out by a small amount of Bhaalgorns like triage can due to triage relying on cap regen that dropped off hard as you hit 0 cap, while injected FAX will not stay at 0 cap for long.
---
theres no guarantee he will actually pass it along  (he was pro blackout after all) and we need to make sure multiple people read this
---
&gt; No, I don't think I will
---
Then fuck off. No answer will satisfy you or the host of other people before you with a similar whine. It has nothing to do with any "challenge" or whatever passive aggressive shot you want to take at other players playing in ways you dont approve. Fuck your approval.
---
My immediate conclusions:  
---
* Along with attribute changes, I'd like to see new player skills increased even further than they are now. New players are *often* asking, "is it even worth playing this game or trying to catch up?". Flying specialized ships requires training. Flying a fucking Rifter that does 30 DPS until you train the proper skills for 6 months should not.  
---
* Your skill injector nerf isn't far enough. At minimum it'd be great to see 4x-6x pushed down to 70%, and  7x-9x pushed down to 30%.  
---
* A complete removal of automatic regeneration on structures seems like a drastic change that may cause a lot of bullshit for no reason. I think a more incremental change, like reducing the regeneration significantly and allowing manual repair to speed it up would be more appropriate.  
---
* It's a very controversial idea but along with your concepts for asset safety, I'd be interested in removing asset safety from low power structures and possibly even powered structures beyond a certain timer. If you want to go AFK for a certain amount of time, you just need to move your shit back to NPC Null, Lowsec, or Hisec. If you're actively playing, this doesn't force JF pilots to spend a solid week of 18 hour days evacuating 10,000 people's shit like we saw pre-citadel.  
---
* FAX tank is too oppressive for any kind of cyno iteration with the ship. If FAX tank gets nerfed into the ground, then *maybe* it can be looked at. However even with a cyno spool up it would be pretty much irrelevant with FAX in their current place.  
---
* The proposed constellation ADM change seems extremely imbalanced with current infinite anomaly IHub upgrade. With a significant nerf to abundance of ADM, this might be feasible.  
---
* IHub change would be better if people could just kill the structure and it was easier to produce. It might be interesting to introduce "IHub fitting", with modules such as a Local Communication Battery, or a Structure Orbital Anchor that force players to make a choice about what  they actually want in a system.  
---
* The five node instant capture seems terrible, especially with N+1 meta. We should be encouraging skirmishing, not mass waterboarding. Might be better off with an increased node spawn rate.  
---
* The FW change list seems great. Along with it I'd like to relink [Tikktokk's FW Post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/7akkgd/tikktokks_thoughts_on_faction_warfare/) that's a great read and has several very important points.  
---
* Battleship cargo needs an increase. Badly.  
---
* Dreads need a look. Revelation/Naglfar outclass the others by a vast amount in most applications, with the Phoenix really only having very niche uses and the Moros essentially only useful as a HAW dread which is still inferior to the Rev and Nag.  
---
* T1 Battlecruiser/Cruiser fitting increased slightly.  
---
* I'd rather see anchorables stop nullified ships than HICs. I think it adds way too much strength to standing fleets, and greatly reduces the effectiveness of solo campers who would benefit the most from being able to stop traffic in a pipe system.  
---
* Interceptor change seems great, but might be better to apply it to combat interceptors specifically since they have essentially lost any fleet role whatsoever after nullification removal and Assault Frigate buff.  
---
* Fantastic bomber changes. People living outside Delve may not realize how oppressive permanent bomber camps are, even vs. frigates. Also makes Stukas more manageable.  
---
* Command Destroyer debuff change is common sense and there's no reason why it shouldn't be implemented immediately. In general a slight base lock range nerf to Triglavian ships would help keep their range at a more appropriate level.  
---
* The big change I disagree with is your concept of inverting the map. This immediately incentivizes all Nullsec alliances to form a large coalition and would cause a stagnation that Eve would probably never recover from.
---
Um - fit a battle/bait tank and kill them?  Have shield boosts instead of mining boosts. There is a ton of things you can do. They are fit to use the minimal amount of dps necessary to kill you. Ofc they can bring an overwhelming amount to kill you - but more often then not it’s just a handful - which you might be able to out pace in tank or otherwise. Hell if you can’t kill them, pop their pods after they are dead. Frequently they have implants which is annoying to replace. In short, stop with the whining and htfu etc.  there is plenty you can do. Hell just stop using a hulk in hs  and you will avoid 99% of this.
---
I gank miners cause it's fun. Generally it is a pretty easy kill and you lose like 20-30m worth of Cats for 300m ISK killmails. Getting nice drones or ORE modules are nice but the kill is just so satisfying.
---
&gt;  i would rather not spend weeks working twords a titan
---
Weeks, he says. Oh you sweet sweet child.
---
The problem in your line of thinking is sotiyos not rorquals.
---
those are ways to fight back. try again.
---
Because you were stealing ore that [belongs](http://www.minerbumping.com/p/the-code.html) to [James 315](http://i.imgur.com/1zgUHAF.jpg).  
---
Necessary law enforcement was performed.
---
"to remove the structure spam" . If you want to remove it, just remove the structures from your overview.
---
People spam structure because it's the only way to keep them. When you want to remove them, you pay with your time the price they paid in the structure.
---
It's boring to kill the structures ? Then don't kill them. All I see is people complaining they can't insta kill structures. but who cares ? Attackers almost always attack when they know the defender can't do a thing. The HPs of the structure is the only defense it has, because its offensive capacities are zero - especially small structures.
---
To kill 500k EHP in 1 minute is 8300 DPS before he uses the XLASB.
---
Yup, I got it.
---
I was wondering how long it would take one of you guys to come to in here and try too hard
---
Na...you're really wrong about that.
---
There you go you're getting it.
---
Why though? Is it really fun fighting something that cannot fight back?
---
I don't disagree, but it's also a good thing to do regardless.
---
&gt; Um - fit a battle/bait tank and kill them? 
---
Concord denies any chance to fight back.
---
&gt; Have shield boosts instead of mining boosts. There is a ton of things you can do. 
---
#***ONCE AGAIN I'M NOT SAYING THERES NOTHING THAT YOU CAN DO JUST THAT WHAT YOU CAN DO IS NOT FIGHTING BACK.***#
---
contain your autism
---
I know, that's why I told the other commenter that I thought the ships were physically away from the docking point. Otherwise, only the random initial deviation matters.
---
Thanks for taking the time tho :)
---
Ignoring for a second the fact that this would make literally no sense what so ever from a lore perspective. The effort of making this workable means it is beyond a non starter. 
---
More plausible from both perspectives would be things like additional NPC null or like a few supergates or something from one side of the map to the other. Although I am not convinced either would be good ideas.
---
Holy shit you guys are denser than the rocks your targets munch.
---
It's still the game.  
---
Chill :)
---
Remove your assets to a more secure location. Or log in and asset safety everything which takes approximately 10 seconds. This seems like an incredibly poor argument for an extremely poor mechanic.
---
man, eve pvp was allways either ganking or large scale wars between corporations what made gaming journalists write about them
---
maybe join code? high sec miners are far easier to find and they rarely can dock up in time
---
Reduce the resources per system drastically and those big alliances will spread out or even fight amongst themselves over them.
---
There are too much resources per system right now, that´s why all the big alliances do not actually go to war and are happy with the space they have.
---
I never said it should be able to?
---
You're being weirdly defensive, nobody is trying to stop you from doing whatever you want to do.
---
why are you killing it in 1 minute?
---
Any citadel that isn't orbiting (read: anchored in the orbit of) a planet is liable for space dodgeball.
---
&gt;you mean like when player involvement picked the Amarr Empress?
---
muh lore? does this even need any more comments?
---
&gt;or when player involvement determined the release schedule of T3s?
---
a release schedule of a ship is as superficial as saying that players are involved in creation of some skins...
---
&gt;or when player involvement determined in local was turned back on?
---
Blackout was ALWAYS meant to be temporary, but that's too hard to accept right? YOU turned it back on...
---
You still haven't answered what you think is fun about annoying random strangers.
---
Yea, like I said you would slow it getting worse, but that doesn't make it better.  It's already bad, there are already too many people who have N Rorq alts, so a full solution needs to do something more than just slow down how quickly it gets worse.  Your solution sounds like a good start but is incomplete.
---
Arguably, allowing all the people who already injected into Rorqs/Titans to stay that way while nerfing the ability for new people to do it just screws the new people harder than the current system.  Yes, it's basically impossible to catch up in the current system, but your suggestion as is makes it vastly more difficult to even participate, let alone catch up, without actually reducing the down-stream effects we already experience.  Nerfs to Rorqs/supers might do it, but I'm curious what nerfs you would suggest.
---
A lot of ships hit by it. Alright, so think about the following situation, a pipe bomb.
---
8-12 battleships all light off their bombs, each sending and recieving packets for damage. This winds up being 144 packets and server actions processed. A fleet of 200 ships lands and that's an extra 2400 packets being sent back and forth.
---
It... It kinda is.
---
So what were those guys trying to teach?
---
the right way for a non fight would say gf ? lol. if no fight, no good fight. no salt, true facts.
---
Low effort.
---
because the ability to disengage while pointed would be a pretty swell thing for a squishy tackler or drive-by screener? but it´s not a thing because WCS gimp scanress and targeting range so nobody actually fits them on those ships who need to lock shit fast and from far away. is that such a hard concept to grasp?
---
Nah they docked up when their near2 went off 8 jumps ago.
---
Only respectable pirates ignore the free indy ship kill in space, for they know the goods being moved are for other ships that they can then shoot later.
---
&gt; FAX tank is too oppressive for any kind of cyno iteration with the ship. If FAX tank gets nerfed into the ground, then maybe it can be looked at. However even with a cyno spool up it would be pretty much irrelevant with FAX in their current place.
---
I actually think a Damnation would be a better choice since an enemy titan can't just DD a damnation and wipe out you cyno in point. The important part of the change is that a cyno has to live for 45 seconds straight to bring friendly titans on field, which is why a hard cyno is necessary.
---
&gt; The proposed constellation ADM change seems extremely imbalanced with current infinite anomaly IHub upgrade. With a significant nerf to abundance of ADM, this might be feasible.
---
Infinite anoms would be removed, since the majority of null PvE is in the new incursion like site. Anoms would only be there for newbies who can't fly a tech 2 fit battleship yet.
---
&gt; The five node instant capture seems terrible, especially with N+1 meta. We should be encouraging skirmishing, not mass waterboarding. Might be better off with an increased node spawn rate.
---
I think if you lost 5 contests in a row you can't really win any of the other ones and might as well save everyone some time.
---
&gt; I'd rather see anchorables stop nullified ships than HICs.
---
Turbocrabs anchor like 60 bubbles on their dead-end in gate. I'd like nullified ships to cut right through those like they do now.
---
&gt; Dreads need a look. Revelation/Naglfar outclass the others by a vast amount in most applications, with the Phoenix really only having very niche uses and the Moros essentially only useful as a HAW dread which is still inferior to the Rev and Nag.
---
Didn't touch on specific ship balance other than kiki because those aren't as disruptive. Moros is bad, ok. But it doesn't have the effect of say Kikis automatically winning every FW plex unless you are in one yourself, or Kikis blapping assault frigates from 50km with perfect tracking so nothing can get close to the bombers they escort.
---
You know why ccp have no idea what they are doing, and why they are complete morons? they released  a major patch that would shake up the universe that many people would love/hate at the exact time that one of the most popular mmo's in history (wow) were releasing one of the  most hyped patches in their history! That would pull many players away from from eve under normal circumstances. love or hate blackout, it was half assed with no thoughts put into it and totally put out at the wrong time.
---
Why does everyone hate in capital ratting? There are far worse things then that.
---
Feel free to believe whatever the fuck you want dude.
---
I don't crit my holes before I krab. I krab in my chain. I play this game to shoot people and to be shot, and pve for the purpose of sustaining that. I will throw hecates at Horde myrmidons, I will invite Init. ratting Hels to my fleet for kicks, I will warp a 1.8b Ikitursa around TEST space aiming at purely the NPC delta and get dropped on by a Nyx.
---
If wormhole space is so great and safe, why don't you join us?
---
using them on exploration site running ships is perfectly valid
---
There wasn't any salt? You literally made a reddit thread about it lmao.
---
I only one thing as an improvement to eve. CCP to learn this... if you are going to take something as big as local it should be driven by player choice. You did something to get the drawback, something you can choose to fix yourself or your sov holder can.
---
In other words, link these changes to game play.
---
i wouldnt call 5 medium drones that hard, its like 400 dps maybeee, 550
---
Right that’s what I am getting at, pve ships alone shouldn’t be able to survive most things when caught alone. Neither should pvp ships.
---
If they aren’t used then back to the cheaper versions of minning is fair.
---
1. Supercaps ratting means supercaps are economic investments that pay for themselves, instead of strategic war winning weapons, that leads to stupid numbers of the things.
---
2. Supercaps ratting is a "win more" mechanic, where you have an umbrella that can drop your supercaps to save ratting supercaps, you can rat safely in them and make mad dosh. If you don't have an umbrella, you die to snuff, so you should join an umbrella.
---
3. /#death to all supers
---
I hope you're not avoiding pvp because you're worried about implant sets, you can swap without any delay inside the same citadel as many times as you want in a day.
---
Could you show me the stats that back up your claim that ganking reduces player retention?  Because CCP put out their own stats (which I presume are better than yours) showing the opposite.  But I have an open mind if you can back it up.  In fact, I'll go a step further - if you can back that claim up with real proof (not "I heard..." or "I know a guy..." but real numbers) I'll give up ganking miners in highsec forever.
---

---
Standardizing BLOPs bonuses across the board is probably a good idea. Just spitballing but something like this:  
---
* Black Ops bonuses (per skill level):  
---
5%-7.5% Application Bonus  
---
125% bonus to ship max velocity while using Cloaking Devices  
---
* Racial Battleship bonuses (per skill level):  
---
[Widow and Redeemer] X% Shield/Armor Resistance Bonus  
---
[Panther and Sin] X% Application Bonus  2  
---
X% Damage Bonus  
---
Also the Marshal's bonuses are legitimately fucked and whoever put that ship together should be ashamed.
---
id like to play your eve version in which ''slow'' warpspeed for subcaps is the reason they dont get used.
---
Right, because taking the players' advice would cheapen CCP's role as the auteur of this whole experience. Which has worked so well in the past.
---
Screw that. Rub it in. I have heard better ideas from players the entire time I have been playing this game. I want to play the game Eve could be. CCP can learn a little humility and we can have a better game.
---
What's dense about those suggestions?  Set Code and known gankers to -10 so they are obvious when they enter system.  Put an alt or a scout a system out to be even safer.  Join the minerbumping channel to get a sense of who is online.  Warp off or move systems if you see gankers nearby.  What's dense about that?  Mining blindly in highsec without taking any precautions is dense.  Highsec isn't supposed to be safe.
---
hes politely asking a question about it not going "reee ban now"
---
Concord doesn’t deny you the chance of fighting back, it helps you. You live, you win. You kill their pods you win. You steal their loot, you win etc.
---
Please walk me through your reasoning - why should a mining barge be able to fight back against a PvP ship?  By that reasoning, I'd like my Fenrir to stand a chance against a Talos.
---
Yeah because defenders need even more buffs to round their space faster
---
Step 1, buy a 30mil stabber w 500mn to bump him, 
---
step 2 give that to a friend or a alt
---
step 3, get him to agro, and once podded wait out your criminal tag. 
---
step4 Undock in the station you preseeded a vni, deimos, or something else in in system. (because you set deathclone there right?!)
---
step5, orbit at 20km w a point on him and kill him, shoot any mediums he puts out and ecm drones too.
---
step6 Scoop loot and take to jita
---
Ex musician asshole. I've had more puss than times you've jerked off..
---
Is it so hard for you to not be afk?
---
Really?
---
And I don't need to buy a permit, because I don't mine.
---
I can sell you one though. It's clear you aspire to be a bot, so I'd recommend you study the code.
---
Honestly a big part of the ganks I pull is the responses like this.  You may not like what I do when I gank, but it's a valid playstyle and there are no "right" playstyles in Eve.  I personally hate nullsec ratting (DED was different - I enjoyed that) - but orbiting a beacon killing rats makes me nuts.  But I don't "hate" anyone who does it.  I don't think they are "empty brains."  It's just something someone else does.  Why do you guys take it so damn personally when someone ganks your ship in highsec?  Honest question.
---
Just prevent any active module activation.
---
\&gt;  Delayed/no notification for wormhole spawns. 
---
What's the goal here? Is this delay only within holes or also their connection to known space. How long of a delay are we talking (jump cloak or a few minutes)?
---
man i moved all my shit in a carrier. some things are far too fat for the DST to move.
---
I was asking that question primarily to figure out vaguely how CCP was doing the damage calculation to know what ships got hit. Given that the load on the server is dependent on how many ships got hit, I would say an AoE-firing flak cannon would at worst be on par with a smartbomb, and on average be much lighter weight (as the range of the AoE effect would necessarily be much smaller). Though, the practicality of such a weapon might cause it to be more common than smartbombs.
---
It can be seen as "something of real value" : the time IRL you need to earn the isks to replace what you lost. this time has a value for many
---
&gt; . And leave system when one shows up.
---
It's funny that you say code is griefers and then recommend to him to follow the code and be active and not afk.
---
Part of why people used to fight however was it was relatively painless to move.
---
Sure you gave up the stations you used to live but chances are you hadn't paid anything for most of them.
---
The place you were moving to you conquered some stations and had a reasonable base of operations for free. Yes you needed POSes for some things but it was pretty optional.
---
You've got a pretty clear bias here.  It's a PvP game and you got PvP'ed.  You might not have liked it, but it's part of the game.  Why do you have such a negative reaction to it?  Highsec isn't safe.  It's not supposed to be.  If you  want perfect safety, take up market trading, or manufacturing.
---
Not trying to fluff you senpai, but this is the best and most comprehensive list of not fucking awful ideas to unfuck what’s fucked. Hopefully gets noticed. Maybe even considered.
---
The whole discussion was about blapping an Orca that is activating weapons timer next to a station, before it can dock safely..so you have 1 minute if he's smart and stops shooting when in danger.
---
You said you have no way to attack or intercept the gankers.  Why should a mining barge be able to do either of those things?
---
1. Every ratting ship needs to be economic or its useless and supercarriers are the least economic ship 
---
2. Dont push your opinion on others 
---
3. You can still die under an umbrella If you dont know what you do. 
---
4. Supercaps will become glorified siege weapons where especially carriers will just get worthless. Jo mean they already are not the greatest of warweapons.
---
Nice flair bait then I guess. I hate to see you besmirch the good name of wingspan Mr code agent.
---
Do a skydiver bother/annoy/take something to someone else ? I don't think so. irrelevant comparison.
---
i mean this could be in combination with nerfing cynos (not by ships they can be fitted to but mobility as a whole so they cant be used as hot drop function,ive seen several of these ideas  on this subreddit)
---
The problem is that ratting builds on subcapitals are so antithetical to actual pvp combat that you often can't fight back, especially now that the VNI was nerfed. PvE isk making needs to be closer in line to actual PvP combat.
---
If you have alt get cap booster hauler. the orca will have many neuts and huge cargo. try simulating a neut orca to see if your fit can get enough cap to rep its dps.
---
Sorry I was suggesting ways to make them more difficult to produce too.  
---
But sure if they do anything else with this game they should really evaluate citadels/structures and the aegis sov.  
---
No more drifters.  No more blackout bullshit.  No more “chaos”.  Fix this broken ass unfun game.
---
Eve isn't the subject actually. Having pleasure annoying people is the true subject.
---
It's group content for the gankers.
---
Get on comms. Have a chat. Race for most damage and/or final blow. If the killmail has something notable, have a laugh over it. 
---
The salt is just a bonus. The killboard padding is a bonus. The community really is the content.
---
I'd say completely rework astras, raitarus, and athanors. Make them basically POSes, with no docking, no clone bay, no personal item hangar, 1 timer and only if fueled/stronted, etc. Keep the bigger structures as replacements for stations, so they are effectively unchanged. Then disallow asset safety from moving stuff out of the system. You can get your stuff back by either retaking the system and anchoring a friendly structure, or by moving it to the enemy structure and fireselling it there.
---
That's as close to the old mechanics as you can get with the new system, and it doesn't go too far in either direction. We're definitely too far into the safety right now, but as we just saw with blackout, going too far in the opposite direction is not going to do anything good.
---
like I said my first response is rather memey, it comes from another game developer denying a feature request with that exact line ( a feature that was obviously also technically possible ). 
---
it's absolutely far from a serious response, the have commented before in fanfast Q/A's that it's technically hard because of client design aka my speculation of build-in assumptions ( being a mix of ccp comments on the subject and my own speculation experience with systems like this ).
---
&gt;I think if you lost 5 contests in a row you can't really win any of the other ones and might as well save everyone some time.  
---
Agree to disagree then. Even currently if you've got a halfway coordinated fleet entosis doesn't take that long. I have more of a problem with how entosis is conducted in general, and how it dissuades actually fighting on nodes.  
---
&gt;Turbocrabs anchor like 60 bubbles on their dead-end in gate. I'd like nullified ships to cut right through those like they do now.  
---
T2 bubbles have too much HP. Is there really even a good reason why there's T1 and T2 bubbles to begin with, in 3 different sizes? Why not make anchorables a single structure and balance around their usage?  
---
Also doing "incursion style PvE" in fleets sounds pretty fun. Trapping a bunch of T1 battleships on the outside of an acceleration gate sounds like a BLOPs fleet's dream - finally getting an opportunity to grab something they can actually kill, as opposed to sitting off a Thera wormhole in an AB bomber for an hour while someone tackles a super that eventually just kills half the fleet at 75% shields.  
---
Your ideas for LP payouts are very interesting. Doing something about immediate liquid ISK generation is pretty important.
---
Anyone willing to take on a newbie ? I’ve done the first 5 minutes but was overwhelmed so kinda gave up :/
---
This is a very epic pvp video with great skill
---
Yea I can believe that for sure. Probably just an oversight when they original wrote the base code.
---
Just would be nice to see some honesty out of ccp regarding it tho. If they don't want to do it just say so it's not like we're an angry mob.. oh wait... Fucking blackout!
---
You seem pretty mad that your not good at this game.
---
I don't own a citadel and I've already lost half a billion in a jump clone after the station I was using ran out of fuel and made it inaccessible. Plus it's an unnecessary pain in the ass. I'm already probably going to lose isk from pvp. Should I also lose skill points I won't get because I jumped out of my +5s?
---
so asides from all the awnsers you already got here, ( and i didnt even read them all) people mostly explained to you why and what and all that.
---
now let me ask u a question, why should u be able to happily mine away in an open world sandbox pvp heavy focused game, without being harmed/engaged in battle ? 
---
like put some guys in tornados/thrashers/catalysts , put them into the belt on top of your mining fleet, and your fine. hell do it in shifts, first hour some guys do it, next hour they ship to miners and the miners ship to the defense ships...effort!

eve is NOT and never was, farmville in space ( even though the 0sec carebears turned 0sec into farmville online, hello kitty in space)
---
put some effort into your mining ops or get ganked .
---
i truly dont understand people complaining about non-consensual pvp in a sandbox pvp mmo.....you know it can and will happen, so be prepared, put some bodyguards with your fleet......
---
I would recommend not leaving your assets in a citadel if you intend on going away. With the proposed changes to add more npc stations in regions, you would be able to store those assets a few jumps over.
---
haha XD
---
This can only happen in Eve though. You don’t find 1000 vs 1000 battles elsewhere. And stuff like in the trailer has happened to me so it is possible. Undock your wolf and go out there.
---
Lmao yeah, for real XD
---
I’m glad exooki made it on CSM so he can quell this shit every time a nullseccer makes a suggestion for w-space without having ever lived there.
---
"qq"
---
Well it's not going to be free kills, since most incursion fleets have 2-3 logi, a web Loki/vindicator, and a t3 booster/command ship. You have to kill them before cyno goes up and stuff comes in.
---
Probably has a bigger player base right now too xD
---
Oh look another retard who doesn't even know what a DSM is much less read one. 
---
Using words you heard watching Dr Phil won't impress anyone.
---
Hmmm new rule. I haven't seen anyone try in vain to insult me and fail miserably. Anyhow new rule 
---
Retards (Like yourself) get one and ONLY one attempt to impress me enough for me to bother to respond at all. If you fail, which is highly likely, you'll be ignored like a fart in a high wind. A VERY apt analogy as it happens....
---
PS It's impossible to insult me since I have more respect for my neighbor's dog than I do for anyone who has tried in vain to insult me and that includes anyone who is LIKELY to try to insult me.
---
PSS My neighbor's dog is dead. Yet I still have more respect for him. Even though the poor bastard died chasing a squirrel in front of a car. Squirrel made it...he didn't...
---
It has no actual timer, but it has a rather inconvenient "wait on the game" timer, though I do realize this is nitpicking.
---
This, so much. Maybe three posts since ChAoS ErA started have been good suggestions.
---
a garmur, with longpoint..shouldnt get tackled or not be able to burn out of tackle..or kill the tackle that is fast enough to keep it pointed. if its scrammed..its dead anyways, as 1 stab wont help 2stabs wont help vs faction scrams either...so why in the name of bo..should a garmur..or any tackle frigate for that matter, fit a stab?
---
This is actually reddit.
---
make one yourself
---
The data that they put up didn’t conclude high sec gankers create retention.  The data they put up said “any form of PvP helps to engage players.”  While code participates in unilateral PvP that could be misconstrued into a false sense of endorsement.  
---
Of course I’m not privy to any official data and you know this so you feel comfortable making your little straw man assertion about quitting ganking.  We both know you wouldn’t quit.  We both know ccp wouldn’t publish what you demand.  So I’m calling out your bs.  
---
A simple search on this sub and the official forums will show you example after example of people who were victims of code and decided if that’s the game, then fuck this game.  I can hardly blame them.  You losers show up against defenseless barges or hulks/mackinaws scan them to make certain it won’t be a fair fight and proceed to extort them and kill them off.  This winds up creating such a negative experience for the victims they never return.  
---
Code is directly responsible for a lions share of new player abandonment of this game.
---
&gt; Null is quite dead even though local is back...
---
You snapped your fingers and CCPs error didn't correct itself in one day? Imagine that. That's the cost of pisspoor development. Try again in 2 months when you have some data.
---
Why?
---
Why not?
---
Bump it? you can 100% bump a orca out of tether/docking range.
---
I'm at work. At this point I'd pay you to make one.
---
No it wasn’t “losing a ship”.  It was “any form of PvP” which could simply be target locked.  You guys pervert that to fit your little narrative and it’s pretty pathetic.  
---
And no I don’t endorse any following of bullshit codes.  You are griefers.  You don’t create long term engagement at any level.
---
If you are in a 30k man alliance and you think a few defence fleets are too much effort, get good at the game because you are clearly trash. you literally just said cloaky roaming gangs have "0 risk" but borderline afk ratters were at risk pre blackout. Ok dude now i know you are just trolling, noone, not even a goon, is unironically this dumb. Noone in existence.
---
long awnser short: yes.
---
I absolutely agree that giving cynos such low fitting requirements that they can be fit to anything bigger than a Corvette is bad design. Giving capitals the ability to fit a cyno just means that they don't need any other ship classes to be involved in their defense, which is also bad. However, CCP has gone too far in the other direction. They should at give the ability back to covops ships (not bombers) and T3Cs with the covops subsystem. Neither of those ship classes are optimal for PVE, so giving cynos back to those classes wouldn't make capital umbrellas any more effective.
---
A/S/L?  
---
I accept blowjobs.
---
roaming dozens of systems from home to look for a kill on a VNI "0 effort", but having a few dudes semi afk in system while you make more money than 90% of the game "so much effort i can't possibly do it". good job proving to me that you are mentally handicapped and the reason that goons need 30k people to beat alliances of 5k people.
---
As a pirate myself, I apologize on behalf of all the sperglords in this thread beating their chests while chanting "HTFU".
---
I like frigate and cruiser bushido brawls. Other people in my corp are aching every night to swing their cock around, land the erect head on the mouse to click "jump", then start blapping subcaps in their carrier. And you, I'm assuming, like the chill camaraderie and logistical puzzles of mining. It's all about what use you find for your time and your ships that you find most satisfying. And for some people, like CODE, that means padding their killboards with as much green as possible. Defenseless miners are the fastest and easiest way to do that.
---
It really is as simple as that. Dank frags are a hell of a drug.
---
All of these are so fucking good holy shit
---
we already have cynos and no-fatigue bridges. that give defenders a huge advantage.
---
the reasons why subcaps dont get used that often is because caps are better/cheaper/faster/tankier/have more dps/apply better/and whatnot.
---
there are only a handful of doctrines that are able to somewhat stay on suberblob grids and the answer to that is usually ''just bring even more caps''.
---
Why would you be able to light a cyno on the outside of an acceleration gate?
---
id like to see your killboard :joy:
---
I haven't seen PL in anything else than Kikis or Jackdaws in a quite a long of time.
---
maybe with the added FPS, it attracts new players and then there will be enough people on each planet
---
u/ccp_falcon jumping on this one. Please.  
---
Genuinely pleading here. Stand up another instance of EVE with these changes (not all are needed but most). Someone, just, please. I know you guys are doing your best, but this has to be one of the most comprehensive game changing and reinvigorating list of things EVE, in a lot of peoples eyes, NEEDS.  
---
Again, please.
---
Why should highsec miners be a protected class?  I flew for PushX for a long time.  I never got upset if I got bumped.  I didn't demand special treatment.  Why should a guy in a retriever who takes no precautions be exempt from danger in this sandbox?
---
Nice troll.
---
More like Low Sec as a content driver has endless  potential.  
---
Why the fuck is *literally nobody* giving a shit about such a huge portion of intermediate space.
---
you nailed it :) - ccp listen to this pls...
---
We aren't satisfied until you're content!
---
69/yes/ur moms
---
You don't endorse the code?
---
But you told this miner to not be afk and to react to the world around him.
---
Just like a code agent does...
---
This is how you lose training pods without blowing up :3
---
Check out [this website](https://abysra.com/) to see some cool Abyssal PvP stats, it’s crazy to see the numbers. 
---
Abyssal PvP is a lot of fun, unfortunately it’s only active at a specific time of day due to the amount of people running Abyssal sites at certain times. 
---
While there are some bad asses that reign supreme, with enough people trying you have a lower chance of running into the big guys (Sniper, TC, Prox, Malango, Gustav, Glock). Or you could prove how bad ass you are and try to take them down!
---
Killing miners is fun, even more so if they then make a reddit post asking why people do it and why can't they just mine in peace.
---
Starve the game of attention. If nobody talks about it, nobody will play it.
---
First of all, we don't have the manpower to counter blob, so that is why.
---
Second of all, never said those guys shouldn't be able to do what they did. That was not the point of the post. You wanna gank random miners all day, by all means do it. 
---
I am genuinely interested understanding why people are so willing to go out of their way to annoy random strangers.
---
Like, several people here specifically mention they do it for the salt. As in they are ganking specifically because they know it will make someone angry.
---
Why is this a good thing? Why is people being angry at you a good thing?
---
I understand that Eve is a PVP heavy game, I'm fine with that, I just wanna try to understand why (some) people seem to interpret that as "spend your days being a dick to random strangers"
---
Or go to nullsec since the local is back..
---
Gottem!
---
I see this "Eve is a Pvp game" sentiment all the time.
---
Would you kindly refer me to statements that say that is all the game is.
---
Also, I am fine with being pvped. I just wanna understand why people like you feel a need to be a dick to random internet stranger.
---
You would not do it with a barge dummy. Just because you were flying a barge doesn't mean you couldn't reship for pvp.
---
Oh yeah that auto win so satisfying, those t1 fit catalyst wrecks so lucrative.
---
Mining is a necessary evil. It's too boring to pay attention. Such easy ganking just makes it tedious. Gankers encourage afk gameplay. It's better to use a porpoise and mining drones while watching Netflix for an hour at a time.
---
Once again, that's not fighting back. That's stopping playing.
---
The fastest ship is one with a jump drive. 
---
Your ihub upgrade is going to be very _very_ strong to overthrow that.
---
Can call it r/dumpster
---
If you're a wormholer, you should feel good about it. Wormholes are good money and very very safe if you're not a moron. You should be putting something on the line when you krab there. 
---
\^\^w\^o\^r\^m\^h\^o\^l\^e\^r\^btw
---
How many times are you going to keep asking the same question, get the same answers, and then ask the same question with your bias showing ever so slightly.  Just come out and say you think ganking sucks and should be nerfed.  We've heard it before.  
---
We've answered you honestly why we do it.  You don't have to like that or agree with it.  It is what it is.  Just accept it and move on.  But stop playing dumb.
---
A blue donut hole.
---
It would be great if there were some way to enable the nomadic lifestyle again. Its dead in the current meta and it was a good conflict driver.
---
Of course I still love you pene 😘🥰
---
it takes about as much effort to make a post as a subreddit. whys “being at work” stopping you?
---
Yes please. PlanetSide really needs a competitor anyways.
---
No it's not.  It's being smart about how you play.  There's thousands of systems in Eve - why do you need to mine in the one occupied by a ganker?
---
Get rekt, scrub
---
&gt; There's thousands of systems in Eve - why do you need to mine in the one occupied by a ganker?
---
Oh yeah i'll just pack up my athanor and move it real quick.
---
\*instant association\* "Who is Adam Shadowchild?"
---
okay I remember from one of his videos u/wingspantt said that we should put a low/null corridor between all empire spaces just to make things more dangerous. 
---
then he said that seems like a terrible idea but looking at it from this idea from this direction it seems pretty okay. 
---
increases risk for freighters who just haul stuff from jita to sell it somewhere in high for cheaper. Alliances will want the space for... IDK? better empire NPC agents? 
---
point is semi-related but it's an idea that might allow for either smaller alliances or more conflict or just more risk. this isn't really sov but it's related.
---
Honestly, it depends like if you're running an alpha doctrine you tend to ignore logi anyway as if targets catch reps your already ineffective anyway, logi focus is often more common in fleet's where both sides lack the ability to alpha the mainline ships of the other side.
---
If that happens like you need to remove logi from the fight and one of your tools is to kill them.
---
You're assuming I am a dick. You don't like my playstyle, so you're labeling it as if it's wrong.  It's not wrong - if it was, CCP would have nerfed it into oblivion years ago.  It's accepted and part of the game.  You don't have to like it.  I've explained, honestly, why I do it. You just want to keep saying gankers are "annoying" or "dicks."  That's a judgment, not a fact.  It's no better than me saying "all miners are dicks."  
---
I've mined.  Did it for a long time.  Decided I hated it.  Now I do other things.  I suggest you try a gank, just once.  Do it in nullsec or a wormhole if you feel that's not being a "dick" - but try it.  You might be surprised at your reaction.  
---
But for the love of god, stop acting dumb here. Just accept that you lost your barge and move on.
---
lol, going with a cloacky proteus and fight a non-pvp fitted gila is "epic pvp", and the pilot has "great skills". That's hilarious.
---
And so do I, I also try to save our shit from getting dunked by those fleets. And it doesnt work. Ask anyone who does that. There is a reason why everyone flies them and its not because they are balanced.
---
Last I checked your athanor has tethering, defenses, and you should be able to defend it if you anchored it.  Remind me why you and your mining fleet are special and shouldn't be held to the same standards as the rest of us?
---
Create an alpha account today it's free to play find any NPSI group follow there instruction and try to work out why they do things and ask FC's for clarification after fleet if you don't understand why they did X.
---
Nice you got it.
---
Considering the blackout killed where I would usually roam? None other than the first week of BO, then I realised shit is broken. I actually like doing it and I sincerely dont mind losing shit. But I also know that its rather boring on a good day because its either kill PvEers or get blobbed.
---
Which is why imo there is no real point in roaming null.
---
as in the OP edit youd implement this in conjuction with jump drive nerfs idealy
---
Gildworthy
---
i never said it should.
---
Mostly psychopaths and people self esteem problems. They're just like schoolyard bullies.
