Please, this
---
Geez I need Hull Upgrades V, High Speed Maneuvering IV and Small Hybrid Turret V for this, rough. Also, you say Cap can go over but what about CPU? With this build I am showing cap stable but -10 on the CPU.
---

---
Also, I'm about 25 days out from having all those skills. I don't really get that aspect of this game. I feel like I'm incentivized to just go AFK and wait for my skills to train up, since there's nothing in-game you can do besides buy injectors. I guess I'll just play something else for a month and come back actually able to fly stuff.
---
Last time we looked at parsing the .dat files we were told it was a EULA violation...
---
Everyone has a lot of basic mechanics to learn, Im still learning after playing for years.
---
Damn you almost solo a carrier in a BS, they answer by dropping and blobbing harder than on the Uyghurs and not even GF in local ? That's some bad etiquette right there.
---
He is masterbaiting hard atm
---
Yeah... found his stream the other day. Told him, if he doesn't want to get blapped, he'd gotta hide his location/destination.... His only answer was: "I like to get my ships blown up. I pay them with my mothers credit card." Whored myself on his carrier/fax 20 minutes later.
---
PM me your ingame name and I'll send you some ISK.
---
But I was one of those new player surrounded by capital, super and titan pilots in Corp and in alliance, and I was barely able to fly an Ishtar with decent skills only for logistics doctrines. 
---
One objective at a time I trained 2 chars for Rhea, then one for the Naglfar, then a carrier (but I always hated ratting with that, I always felt fighter mechanics very autistic). 
---
After rorqual changes and excavators introduction I started training for that, I finished only after a few nerf bats but who cares, the important thing imho is to reach the objective and have fun. 
---
Also for me the plan for many of those milestones started way after the introduction of skill injectors.
---
Pin D scan to your HUD, map it to space or something easily accessible and mash that shit all the time. Stay aligned to an escape route if you can. But constantly scanning will be your best chance of survival, if I'm exploring a wormhole and see anyone on scan I cloak up

get the secondary screen a bit more angled towards a top down view, the way it is now it's pretty hard to see the projection onto the grid

Well good news is I know I'll die in my dreadnaught a lot so once I'm skilled up I'm going to save 40 bill before joining a corporation so I'll be able to afford 10 deaths before I have to go back to the grindstone. And I plan to run c5/c6 wormholes to generate isk. That's the plan anyway

And yeah, I once had someone reach out to me on an out of corp alt, and then ask a bunch of questions related to how many people we have during which periods of time, if he could join on that alt instead of applying with his main. The guy straight up started asking me when our reinforcement timers were set up for haha.

Besides those fancy proprietary methods that nobody is ever going to share, what market trading strategies are out there? I’m aware of contract flipping, patch speculation, arbitrage, and trading between stations. Am I missing anything?

On the off chance that any trader does want to spill some beans, what’s the typical ROI for market play? How much does it vary between different activities and amounts of capital committed?

This fit is just generic full T2. Here's where knowing how to adjust fits to match your skills/requirements or ask someone to customize it for you will help.
---
1600mm Steel Plates II -&gt; 1600mm Crystalline Carbonide Restrained Plates
---
* Less HP but you'll actually be a bit faster
---
50mn Microwarpdrive II -&gt; 50mn Quad LiF Restrained Microwarpdrive
---
        
---
* very slightly slower, with smaller sig bloom and less cap use. Honestly, T2 is not really worth it here anyway for the extra cost.
---
Light Neutron Blaster II with Void/Caldari Navy Antimatter-&gt; Anode Light Neutron Particle Cannon I with Caldari Navy Antimatter
---
* Notable decrease in DPS. Don't use the Modal Light version, it's way too expensive.
---
Alternate: Light Neutron Blaster II with Void -&gt; Small Energy Neutralizer II or Small Infectious Scoped Energy Neutralizer
---
* Energy neutralization makes you better at killing things that use active tank, use a lot of capacitor, or are smaller than you. Make sure you turn off your MWD and don't run your own capacitor dry.

Being in a HS corp isn't always all that bad, as I'm sure you can see. But as people will tell you, living almost anywhere else will be a better experience for you. So my advice would be to enjoy yourself but keep an open mind. Once you are more comfortable with the game it would benefit you greatly to join an established WH or Nullsec corp. Whether just to mine and indy, or branch out into fleets and PvP, the real fun happens everywhere but hisec.

He was in a speedy boi ship and was out ranging his opponent in the abyss 1v1 thing. Its a common tactic to fly a cheap ship and ransom them because if one of you dont die then you both die.

Abyssal PvP, 1v1. after 20 minutes both of them die.

Gatorgrips was in a cheap Caracal that goes fast enough to speed tank the Ishtars drones, and kill them.
---
Gatorgrips offers to let the 5 bill Ishtar go and let him kill him for 1 bill.

So Gatorgrips then honours the ransom and lets him kill him.

He could have just taken the 1 bill and laughed as they both died or tried to kill him

Pretty good, some corrections/additions needed still though. Like Initiative Mercenaries belongs in the Imperium, not associates. Also, Phage and Terror should be under Panfam Associates. Tri should probably be listed as a Panfam associate if not under Panfam directly, both due to their standings and the significant presence Panfam has had in every significant defense on Tri's behalf.

Even when they weren't there they were wither formed in range or ready to form. Infinity Avenger, even though they're a corp, should be added to the Winter Coalition due to their size, activity, and constant presence with them during this recent "war".

---
So basically in WH space everything drops when the citadel dies ? That's how I would have expected it to work everywhere tbh, even POS wouldn't allow you to magically teleport stuff out of it when they were destroyed.
---
Very strange design choice tbh.
---
It was created to incentivize people into using citadels when they first came out instead of stations. They had to have a reason to park their stuff in citadels that could be killed rather than the previously indestructible nullsec stations (no longer true since they were updated to faction fortizars) that stuck around forever.
---
I see, well that's fine then. I expected that it would be a sea of sharks that can attack at any moment. I suppose most of my pvp conflict will be in response to an attack. I'm not one to go hunting for a pvp fight, especially in a game where veterans will have much stronger ships.
---
shit I forgot about the deposit function this is actually smart damn
---
Any tips on finding solo fights faster and more frequently?
---
Structure dies or you manually put items into asset safety (like op) stuff shows up in lowsec system close by after a period of time and you can collect for a fee (which is determined by value of said items).
---
On top of this you can deposit items from cargo or ore hold and probably any of the other holds straight into ANY citadel without docking. Designed for krablords who don’t want to dock to stash their ore. I used it to sell escalations to people who didn’t let me dock in said citadels.
---
In wormholes structure dies and it shits out anything and everything.

When you've been playing 12 years and haven't injected yet, it's kinda pointless to start now
---
The beacon its on my overview but the timer bar still not showing up :/ think I am messing something up lol

While I understand your idea and logic, the only injectors that make sense based on a day or two of training and earning one every hour or two are the alpha injectors.
---
Don't forget to biomass.
---
Cool, thanks for the meme explanation.
---
Why Acolytes? Why not Hornets or something?  Hornets have a lot better dps, almost as much tracking, etc. I thought Amarr drones were generally worse unless you MUST do EM damage.
---
Code have their own purpose. They are fighting against boring gameplay and botting. They try to force player interaction. What I've understood they don't use wardecs but just go for the ganks. Without them some stuff in highsec would be 100% safe to do. Someone has to do the dirty work.

What's the over/under on CCP messing something up and ruining their Birthday event?

For fun, lets pretend events weren't ruined after the first one.
---
Wait, how do you put it straight from your hold into a citadel without docking?
---
How's it work with courier contracts?  Can you no longer scam people into doing high collateral contracts that they can't complete?
---
What’s a PL lol
---
Eve is an extensive, slow paced and challenging game. I can see how some people could take frequent, long pauses from it in order to keep interest In it, and when you lose something, it can be very disheartening for awhile.
---
Anytime Dyson has an application
---
Wait what did people really live in poses in nullsec back before citadel came out?
---
Right click structure, open cargo deposit, drag items in and click transfer.
---
Yep, you had ship hangars where you could store ships and items, capitals were left unpiloted inside the forcefield when not in use.
---
&gt; They gave me access to a significant amount of stuff
---
I promise they didn't.  You can buy something like 1.5 billion isk for ~$17.  The things they gave you access too were in the low millions.
---
At docking distance or 2500m or what is the range for that?
---
Log in a fw pvp frigate alt, warp to plex and run 1-2 of them for 100m/h. Shoot anyone that tries to come after you. Warp to safe. Log off.
---
Idk warp to the structure and you’ll be in range.
---
Straight up don't roll it, it was infuriating...
---
If you know your payout may just be greater than an appropriate ransom and you want to get out of the stalemate with most of your assets in the site intact, a cordial ransom is the way to go...
---
Yea, totally, there where/are all sort of modulus you can anchor, ore processing, balding, the works.
---
Correct.

Happy Birthday! o7
---
Also, I didn't know about the Gigx bans. Just looked into it more. That's some horse shit.
---
Nullsec had outposts, which behaved kinda like npc stations today, couldn't be destroyed but could be captured. Also, you couldn't have a bajillion of them in every system.
---
Honestly I thought one of the reason for creating citadels in the first place was so that you could effectively have destructible stations, but if all the stuff inside gets magicked out when it dies I don't really see the point besides adding more structure grinding pain to the game.
---
Good question. But I spend my isk as fast as it appears
---

Please link your lossmail.
---
Have you ever taken the game out of potato mode and unlocked?
---
Some of the visuals and attention to detail in eve are amazing, especially for a 16 year old game.
---
&gt;What's the point of asset safety 
---
iirc, this idea came about when they were turning npcs into faction citadels(fortizars)
---
Basically what happened was there's probably a ton of assets locked up in old NPC stations you cant get access to for whatever reason. So there's Asset safety to move your old stuff to lowsec/highsec npc station(whichever was closer)
---
But before that change happened it was implemented in all citadels that the player puts down. Blow up a PC citadel, player assets in those citadels are scooped up by Space UPS with Concord cloaking and jump to the nearest low sec station.
---
But in wormholes there's no Space UPS so there citadels just drop everything that was in there.
---
That actually sounds like fun.
---
ANY TRUERS?
---
Eve isn't about the graphics.
---
&gt;  Can you no longer scam people into doing high collateral contracts that they can't complete?
---
I believe when it first came out you could still do it by setting the destination to a citadel they cant dock at.
---
But now CCP has implemented a direct deposit. Ie. you can just warp into tether range and just shove it into the citadel.
---
And then you can just "deliver to..." iirc.
---
Wait how do this work scoots?
---
Incursion. And sometimes selling alliance contracts.
---
&gt;after fucking up the wars and all other fun evil stuff in Eve
---
If you are talking about highsec wars then they were already totally fucked. They used to be fun when there was more different groups doing them. For years now they've been fun for only really small group of bittervet players who haven't figured out how to leave highsec:
---
&gt;Five corporations are responsible for 50 percent of the wardecs. Destroying 105 ships for every one that they lost. Only 4 percent of defenders were able to score a single kill.
---
Maybe you should realize you are getting more worked up over someone else's loss more than pilot that lost it?
---
At some point you have to ask, why do I spend my time this way?
---
I look forward to your calm and reasonable response.
---
fohhhh
---
True, it's not about graphics, it's not about fun nor gameplay. It's about "shut up and take my money" at this point
---
asset safety is a mistake
---
I understand how it works, I just don't understand why they thought it was necessary ? If they were afraid of old outposts dropping mountains of forgotten crap stockpiled over the years then just make the converted citadels not drop anything when downed but have the regular citadel be real loot pinatas that are rewarding to kill. I bet the new citadel far outnumber the old outposts at this point anyway.
---
Haha damn holy shit.

Because $15 a month is sooo much $$$ for a game, or, if you where smart, used the DLC packs to jumpstart your toon, utilize your other two characters and make enough ISK to PLEX your account and a second if you really want to.

You could also wear it and irritate just as many.

Why are you calling it buffer?  
---
Looks like passive regen to me.
---
Caracal have pretty decent base shield and resists. It's no Cerb but they can get tanky enough to ignore a poor Ishtar fit and piloting I'd think.
---
I had a Brutix try and gank my Caracal in wormholes.. for some reason he didn't try to stay out of point plank when they used rails.  I got him to 30% hull without losing shields and sadly he warped out since I didn't have a scrambler.  And that was just a like 180mil fit Caracal.
---
This sub is 90% bittervets
---
Warp to any Upwell structure, and click on it. In the Selected Items window, there will be a "Delivery" option. You can just drag and drop things from your inventory and it'll deposit the goods into that structure. 
---
Most folks use it to get around those courier contract scams that block Docking access, because now you can just Deliver the courier contract and finish it remotely without having to dock in the structure. But I've been using it to safely drop and Asset Safety away all the loot I've been scooping from dead VNIs. :D
---
Sadly most people won't pay ransoms because they think you will just screw them over. I'm trying to show that it's not always the case and certainly not the case with me.
---
If they really want to get back these like... 50 or so Republic Fleet Berserkers, sure, lol. I'll most likely forget it about it until next year or something, because I'm not in a rush to pull 'em out, lol.
---
I think cap proliferation is the big culprit here. Nowadays anything that breathes is at risk of getting dropped on for shits and giggles, like 2 carriers and dread dropping on 3 assault frigate, which i've seen recently.
---
I think CCP should seriously consider removing cyno from non-super caps while there is so many of them in the game.
---
To quote Billy Joel:
---
\&gt; I’d rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints; the sinners are much more fun
---
It works for anything you can scoop and drop from your inventory.
---
If you manage to boosh off an Excavator, scoop it, warp to the nearest structure, and Deliver it. Boom, now you can asset safety that baby all the way out to lowsec.
---
Then go scoop it out, and courier contract it to some pubbie with proper collat. Either you get your goods delivered for cheap, or you get a nice chunk of collateral, lol.
---
The best time in eve I had when I was having 2-3 space jobs. The fact that others depend on you makes it a whole other experience.

---
lol goodbye o/
---
&gt;he wanted a vacation from his space job.  This is the moment you say yes.
---
You make good points but he's calling it buffer because I fit extenders instead of purgers, and I rely more on total shield hp than regen to get me from room to room in the abyss. Although you're not wrong - recharge does play a large part.

I was in pen is out a week so ago, we wernt blue but sometime worked with eachother. I wouldnt call that being in a coalition but whatever
---
I just hate discord. Slack ruined all the messaging apps for me.

i won EVE more than five years ago and i still have nightmares about fuel logistics.

My salt detector went off the scale. I'd love to know the back story.

Brave put out an invitation for people to come looking for a fight in their announcement. I mean, I don’t think anyone expected a dreadbomb, but if you’re playing games with a Vendetta then it really shouldn’t be too surprising
---
Last time it was a thanny that dropped. Then, when we took the fight he fled through a jump gate. THEN Brave dropped 2 supers. The time before that, y'all batphoned a goon fleet to fight us.
---
Hey Tora, honest question: how does one manage to only gatecamp for years and still suck at bumping?
---

Nah his geckos lived. He did lose quite a few augmented infiltrators and maybe some vespas I think.
---
And this is why you use heavy tackle rorqs....

If you have any additional questions, feel free to pm me
---
I quit the game several years ago and back then you had to manually generate API strings through account management. If you told me to go to some website (ESI site) and login through SSO, i'd probably be just as wary. I would try to find this site through account management just to make sure you're not doing something malicious. 
---
That seems paranoid, but this is EVE.
---
Did you happen to ask for a referral fee? That'll probably do it.
---
I mean coalitions is one thing

Strategic coalitons is another there buddy

My main was injector free until they released the booster that allowed 3 injectors without the penalty, went and extracted bio v so could use a booster every like 19hrs and dropped a lot of injectors that week.

Im sorry, but very few wh corps can actually hold hole control vs a force that outnumbers them.

You asked him for the 100m offer and he didn't said yes?? Why? Or am I reading things wrong?

Really bad idea dude. I'll be civil and leave it at that. Personally, I'd get rid of plex. I see that removing so many problems. But CCP won't do that because they profit from rmt.
---
you think we scum?  w8 till you see twitter.  or Tumblr during a 4 chan raid.

Hyper rigs exist if you don't rely on a fax blob and instead use them on risky situations.

Thanks mate! And I'm not, but that match they outplayed us before we landed on grid.
---
My accounts are over a decade old and I just came back, “millions” of SP and “billions” of ISK come quicker now.
---
Your lack of self control “itch” and deleting your account because you want to “live again” is 100% on you, you are depressed and not living like you want to, if not EVE, than it would something else you’d be raging at and trying to get rid of.
---
Handle your shit for our sake and yours, get a theripast, I just did, even with a good marriage (kinky gay btw) that was a huge help after the second session.
---
Brought a tear to me fookin' eye, it did!
---
Tabs, like z-s default has. 
---
Clear all the clutter off the primary combat overview. Ships, npcs (not police or lancers), structures, gates, etc. Leave cans for relic/data sites, but pretty much everything else that isn’t combat related should be gone, and moved to a separate tab, like structures/stations, travel, miscellaneous for cans/wrecks, etc. 
---
And include in the tutorial a description of how to add/ remove things from overview, and leave all brackets on, so people can easily add or remove things.
---
Long story... too triggered to tell it. Hell, it took me 2.5 months to upload this.
---
This old dead alliance, kinda like band of Brothers
---
A) You are not actually in militia yet for some reason. Can you see a "militia" chat channel ingame? It automatically joins the channel when you join FW and you can't leave the channel unless you quit FW.
---
B) You are trying to run dplex in a system that isn't contested. Or you are actually in enemy system and it's offensive plexing. You need to kill the rat and after that timer starts to run.
---
Yeah good eye. Walked that one back real quick.

Nu pure blind is a trash name, and tri definitely did not agree to it. Imo, it should be changed to “TRI arent dead yet? And friends”
---
Weekend Warriors are part of winter co.
---
Also, FXR are init pets now. After “TRI arent dead yet? And friends” stomped their attempt at getting space from olds and banderlogs, they ran to init who flipped them a constellation of LUCK. sov In pure blind. So yeah, plus one for the imperium blue donut.
---
Anyone saying snuff isn’t part of the imperium is deluting themselves. They have space near init, are always friendly on grid, are always batphoning each other on timers, etc. At best, it’s a loose association that has them working with imperium members daily with “neutral” status so they can drag idiot supers who stumble in range of their dread bombs. At worst, they are low sec imperium on the DL due to politics and propaganda purposes.

Olmeca: Not enough Rorquals die because capital umbrellas are OP. We should buff mobile cyno inhibition so people have better means to circumvent capital umbrellas.

4 PL camped one of our ratting systems for hours, I slept and came back and they were still there. Best part is how I almost killed 2 of them and still got away in my ratting VNI, then they “thanks for the faction drones” republic warriors 1mil ish each LOL. 
---
Weren’t they supposed to be an “elite” pvp group
---
Yeah no i dont need your validation.
---
And if someone attacks you and you survive leave the damn system.

As he said, the margins are super tight and often in the red. It’s the best when galaxy packs are dropping multi-character training certificates, could buy one for like 1.5 bil. Add in extractors and it was a cool 300 mil profit or so for zero work.
---
That’s when certificate prices were cheap tho
---
Now this explains where the 70 trillion ISK tax imperium must have collected since the Delve move-in goes.

I wish it was more common but sadly I don't see enough t1 ships in abyssal pvp.

When I was yet a newbro I was rocking lvl4s in a domi. 
---
My next mission took me just 1 system over. Little did I know it was lowsec. I had no clue what sec status was or any of that shit, because back then Eve was a hard cold bitch. I saw the warning status at the gate and chuckled, "HA fuck this game, what does it think I'm dumb?"  
---
About 4 minutes later I'm tackled by an ares (first time seeing one at the time) and a sin. Out of nowhere I'm down to hull, and they stop. Convo goes up, ask for 500m or I die. I'm dumb, pay it. and out of nowhere they let me go, and warp off. 
---
After I wipe up my newbro shit/piss off the floor I convo'd the guy and asked how he did that. He taught me the first steps of PvP. After that I was hooked. 
---
13 years later look at me now. Still a shit PVEr and even worse PVPr, but at least I'm still playing.

&gt;The pressure of numbers alone isn't the issue your doctrine pool is deliberately designed to be impossible to engage by any nano cruiser doctrine

lose 5m in drones, save a 60m+ ship hull.

It is funny when asset safety is bad and kills all wars in  null-sec and at the same time it is good because it provides way for roamed to safely move loot to empire.
---
&gt;not many people keep their word though
---
Not really. A rorq is like 700-800m after insurance when it dies. You just use miner 2's and boost.

"my corp dude... sometimes you guys really boggle my nogs"

Propaganda posts are like 2012 memes, doesn't deserve a place on reddit because that's what moms are doing if they are bored
---
Ha
---
Not all of krabbing is soul crushing, matter is most efficient ways of making isk are. Rorq mining, (Supper)carrier ratting aren't the most exiting activities. All thought that's not my main source of ISK, I, for one, love to take my trusty Astero and look for some anomalies.
---
 Doing abyssals is engaging and kinda fun, but I wouldn't recommend that for most people. TBH, if you are unlucky, you will be lossing money on it even when our not loosing any ships, even at T4. Simply filaments are so expensive, that loot won't cover the filament and ammo  and drugs costs. I think that they might ninja nerfed the loot tables, but it possible that it was just realy long strike of bad luck.

Sweet! I was looking forward to that perspective.
---
This is really sad to me, this was supposed to be a fun go and bash simple farmers fleet and you guys went for the headshot massacre right off the jump.
---
I don't do a lot of trading but the one thing I have always done is null sec alliance importing. I don't even own a jump freighter or it would be even more profit. I just pay for the alliance jump freighter service.
---
My markup was 10-15% after shipping costs. I would buy up whole doctrine fits in Jita off buy orders and ship them to null. Fit them up and list  on contracts. Every time a fleet whelps or pings you sell a ton. Sabres are best sellers.
---
And this is how a nobody became the new Elo Knight? :)
---
better fit some abyssal cargo expanders to fit the massive balls on this guy :P
---
It's ok I know the feeling well... I've list a few Titan due to lack of tackle Lucky one time a hel got away in 3% hull, luky managed to get carrier to the first grid before either landed it and managed to secure the kill.

Someone has to.

ok now hear me out.
---
WHAT IF
---
at the exact location where the loki was being booshed to
---
there was a higgs'd Macherial with an X-type abyssal MWD hurtling directly at that point at full speed in the direction AWAY from Nag
---
and it makes contact directly with the loki as the loki appears from the boosh, taking all possible momentum and directing it away from the Nag for an angular velocity of virtually 0, in addition to the webs
---
AND THEN
---
there are three abyssal web vindis in that general direction as well
---
and THEN.....
---
ok im done
---
yes people do this often when they get something shiny in enemy space.

this post should be saved

Nomading is way more fun. Take 2 dreads, a scanning alt and a prowler alt. Bash only other people's content, self destruct when you run out of holes/get bored.

Can confirm, people always ask me how to make fucktons on the market... and it's like "why would I tell you? I spent weeks watching charts and making graphs and spreadsheets, I didnt do all that work so I can tell you to buy X here and sell it there."
---
thanks, updated
---
Concerns were raised that this would happen when the drop box feature was announced. The concerns went unaddressed. Perhaps your publicity will hasten the fix.
---
You were in frat space shooting a frat structure.
---
Elo barely ever calls FC's as target, but in this case we had just chased the fleet for two systems and their next warp would have saved them, so tackling the FC was the best way to hold them in grid. Notice how he calls for tackle, not calls him primary. If you don't want to fight, don't undock.
---
It shouldn’t, set your safety to green and then it will ensure that you don’t accidentally go suspect.
---
I added the folders that hold this kinda of stuff to Windows File History, so now there are instanced incremental backups if something messes up.
---
not so much difficult as it would be tedious to create
---
iv done it for other games:
---
write a little script that takes a screenshot of a section of overview or dscan or whatever (a,x)to(b,y) coord rectangle. Now present every use-case to record, in our case this would be going on sisi and undocking an alt in every ship in the game to screenshot and save. Have the script present you with a prompt to name each one (heron, loki, legion etc.). After hours of doing this, your bot can now reference this database folder to find what exactly appeared on d by matching pixels. If it matches to an image name "legion", you can have perform some actions specifically tailored to case-state "legion", print it, play a legion-specific sound clip... whatever.
---
Since this is very cpu inefficient what you could do is write a script to run through all of the images and convert all of the images to a text representation of the pixel states. Furthermore, you can have it present you this textual representation as a chunk of formatted code that defines and fills the arrays of pixels for you (something it would take hundreds of hours for a human to do manually). Paste that straight into your code. You have now cut out the need for your program to open/close files to do a simple task - identify what ship just appeared on overview or dscan.
---
You can take this a step further by writing a script that finds a combination of pixel states unique to each of the images in your screenshot folder. This cuts down the number of pixels that have to be compared from thousands to maybe 10-20. Reuse code you already made above to present you with a formatted block of code ready to paste in with array definitions.
---
Again, this is the *tedious* part, not the *hard* part. The *hard* part would be for instance, to write a program that reads the distances of objects on overview from multiple clients (with friendlies on overview open so this includes distances between bot clients) to  triangulate a 3d representation of the entire visible grid. From there, its a shot leap to imagine a kiting bot that can always perfect slingshot, for instance - with mathematical precision the human brain is not capable of. A visionary with enough time on their hands has yet to come around to eve.
---
watch me get banned from yet another subreddit for talking about conceptual programming :^)
---
When i played more extensively and i was in provi block. There was a red roaming alone probably for drops. But still i invited to a 1v1 because personally i wanted to practice. He honored it, which was nice. I was winning it would seem and although i made a few mistakes that probably would have got me killed in the end. Which i didnt know at the time. But apparently there was a cloaked blue not in fleet watching and decided to ruin the fun. Made me look bad and is one of the reasons i dont like provi block anymore.
---
Don't forget supercapital building.  Had to be done out of a POS no station had the facilities for it before Soityos.
---
I'm a dummy who lives in Low/High. But it's neat. I can appreciate it.
---
It's the terrible price you pay when you don't invade former friends who just finished getting their teeth kicked in after you spent a large portion of the war staying docked or half-heartedly helping them.
---
Exploring, and killing explorers. Best part is you can do it while multitasking really easily, when exploring just cloak, when hunting just dscan for probes every so often.
---
So this will be at noon for the East Coast US and 9 AM for the West Coast US. More than half the players are being excluded from a "Mass Test."
---
Why do people applying to corp want to tell me about their pets?
---
I get it, you love cats, but I dont need to know the full backstory of how you and Sir Fluffy Mewkins the 3rd met.
---
From my understanding it was to replicate the ability of a corp that lost an outpost being able to still firesale their stuff. Asset safety from a cit in NS to a NPC station in LS costs 25% the value of the object. This was designed to be both an ISK sink and to allow players who lost a station to not lose everything. Personally, I disagree with this design, but I'm still willing to exploit to evac loot safely.
---
I may have missed the previous threads dealing with it but what are the rewards for the winning team?
---
Love you Chols.
---
For a slightly more detailed AAR, Voltron decided that for some reason a mach fleet was the best thing to shoot a Frat JB. Elo flash formed a munnin response fleet. Vily had also cloaked a devoter one system out, so a sneaky play was suspected.
---
We cyno'd in on the station with JB on grid. Voltron fleet immediately started to run. We gave chase, and because of superior warp speed managed to catched them one system away, bubbling their fleet and jumping into them just after they had jumped. They began aligning out, but our dictors copied their align and managed to bubble most of them. Elo called for all tackled on their FC to try and hold them on grid, as one more warp would have saved them.
---
Once trapped we started chewing through machs, the only targets they shot were tackle. Eventually so many machs were dying that they lit a cyno and bridged in a titan and super fleet. However the munnins had been chewing on machs from behind and weren't anywhere near enough for the titans to be effective. Elo called tackle primary and then warped the fleet to a ping. The machs safed up on top of their titan and super fleet. WinterCo headed home with stomachs full.
---
Only way to avoid an unjustified ban is to just RMT away all your extra isk. If you’re going to get banned, make it be for something you actually did
---
Test aren't doing rorqual saves while fighting pandas.
---
Fw plexing novices with pvp frigs you can always find a fight just let them come to you
---
Look for items that fluctuate regularly, or items that are unsusally low. Buy them when they are  low and resell them once the price has recovered. Just make certain the price will recover before you buy. You don't make a consistent stream of ISK, but profits of 20% aren't unheard of, and I've personally gotten close to 200% on some of my investments. This is mostly something to do with ISK that would otherwise just be sitting in your wallet, and isn't the fastest money maker though.
---
Gator! So that's what you were up to! I faced you yesterday and was a bit confused. I'm honestly lucky I caught you. I was that vedmak.

Bob is everywhere but I think the Abyssal space needs a new god
---
Hello all,
---
I just picked up the game again, with a friend who never played. 
---
I used to play with free trials account while my dad and borther played on an "omega" back in 2009~2011 (I remember eve dominion and eve incursion) since I was the youngest.
---
I started guiding us towards security missions, but I realized I should show my friend a little more of the game before going for our "main" activity. I finished the 5 career missions that are recommended at the beginning, but I find them a little boring since they don't offer much.
---
So, I got a few questions:
---
*So what activity would you recommend we try? My friend doesn't know all the basics, and remember some stuff but I might need reminders in some areas. Also, I don't want to get him into PvP already, with a 2days old account I think we can only lose money and motivation.
---
*I vaguely remember faction standings matter for mission (for access to level2,3,4 missions) but also you hurt standing for other faction? when doing missions for a faction, do I boost my stading for this one, and hurt it for one other or how does it work? 
---
*Is there somewhere where I could grind without hurting too much standing, or where I could counter the bad standing? Is one type of mission more worth it (security, mining, distribution, R&amp;D)?
---
*Bonus question: Since I saw there's quite a few ways to make money, how did YOU make your first billion? anything you would recommend?
---
Thanks for reading!
---
Stay humble dude
---
Cool music, what track is that ?
---
aquaman drowns and the flash breaks his legs in avengers endgame
---
Hah
---
Is that where they went? Well then i'm instead glad i didn't go and a lil peeved i was initially mislead. When they left they said there were reffed low power simple farmers structures to kill.
---
Jita trade alt and another in-corp trade alt. I log them in maybe twice a week to update orders and  JF contract stuff to null.  Stupid amounts of ISK with almost no effort once you get it set up.
---
Yes I joined the militia and can see the channel, also the systems I tried were either at .3% and 13% contested but nothing was coming out for defense, havent tried killing the rat in offensive yet.
---
Were you single rep? I remember facing a single rep vedmak recently and thinking he was crazy and gonna die if he kept that up.
---
&lt;3
---
I was not (i can't fly the mach doctrine yet so i didn't go) which is why i assumed the original suggested objective was what they were doing and not going to harass frat.
---
Don't think so tbh, given their knowledge of the game why would they play to not undock?
---

---
I think that's the major difference between being in a nullsec big blob corp and being a wormholer / lowsec pirate / faction warfare. In nullsec it's usually someone else looking for the fights and planning offensives, while in the other spaces you will need to actively search for fights, and when you find one, you don't have hours to prepare for them but take whoever is currently online and available.
---
 *You can't triple stamp* a *double stamp*, Lloyd!
---
Inadequate opsec is a very serious and real problem. And in the end they don't need you as much as you need them so axing you is the right thing to do if anything suspicious happens.
---
If you want to see what inadequate opsec looks like make an alt come join brave.
---
Yeah he walked away from that for free, you should have wrangled him for at least half the value.
---
you can't really camp lowsec stations, so who cares
---
Voltron leadership lying to them to get them to undock, who'd have thunk it

you need a little tank even in hit &amp; run fits, else you can just get alphad by some titan dd that just cynod on you before you can even kill the hic/sabre

So let me get this straight. You joined Horde. Then suddenly left horde. Joined legacy/imperium. Received isk from a non coalition person and blame them for being sketchy? Thats like a russian coming to america, and suddenly becoming a millionare (during the cold war). Of course they thought you were a spy. 
---
While They might not be perfect. Imperium is a good place for newbros. It always has been. We teach people how to do stuff and offer a safe environment for them to do it, or it they fancy. We offer almost never ending pvp options. 
---
To be clear, im not saying other coalitions dont have good incentives, they do. Im just saying, dont warn people to stay away from one party cause you made a silly mistake.

Refining. It requires a minimal amount of krabbing. Sadly, it only scales with the market and requires enough liquid isk to capitalize on good prices.

If the market dries up, then abyssals or some low effort mining if I need to also do other things.

I am glad someone else asked this question for me.

---
There's no such thing as griefing in EVE Online. That is a mission baiter attempting to irritate you into shooting back so he can PvP you directly. He has to do that to avoid a CONCORD response. If you aren't confident of victory and don't want to lose more MTUs your best bet is to fill your highs with tractor beams instead of remote armor repairers.

Phear Vyna Monitor. Laffo

I mostly do something I like to call "hot salvaging".  I patrol Zkill for ppl dying in Delve then I run, loot, and salvage before I get killed. Its horrible for tick per minuet but it's good because it teaches you how to dodge hostile fleets, the loot you can use on your own ships to offset costs of pvp, and its alot more fun then point click grinde
---
If you don't get dd'd it's irrelevant
---
Avoid titans and you're fine. If you're dropping in space where you're concerned about titans dropping on you you're probably fucked anyway
---
I always assumed that doctrines had something to do with mfs higher up making bank 😂
---
Nobodies that have such a high opinion of themselves that, really, you should be paying for them to join.
---
You know that feeling when you buy an ice cream and drop it? That’s how I feel about the amount of fireworks I bought lol
---
Tell that to the guys in Konora 😁
---
Honestly. This would do more harm then good. Lets imagine somehow. Player loss is nearly non existant. The null powers would be screwed. Panfam is running almost entirely off "old money" from their glory days, while imperium/legacy are running off of new money. Now imperium/legacy would just restart their economy and steamroll eve, with no force strong enough to stop their advance.
---
&gt;How are you making an injector every hour or two?
---
Two supers
---
&gt;when you're super ratting what are you still going to inject
---
More super pilots.
---
Guarantee you don't work at Intel.
---
Do you want the war to be over? Cause that’s the only reason to post triggerbait bullshit like that.
---
That's why you buy them in Perimeter
---
Like anyone picking up lowsec couriers doesn't have an insta for every kick out
---
Well... let me tell you my story.  
---
Started playing in December 2017. Joined a null-sec corp, who told me I was gonna get a lot of pvp. Didn't get pvp at all, so started joining NPSI fleets. Got realy exited with pvping, and watched a lot of youtube videos. Especialy those with comms! Learned a lot about priorities, what to keep an eye on, how different doctrines can interact with each other, weaknesses and benefits of certain meta doctrines (Eagles/Muninns for example), etc. 
---
Get to know the ships you are flying. What they can fight, what they can't. (For example: Don't try to take Rail-Comorants into close combat. You'll get slaughterd.)  
---
Started my own little funroams within my corp. Started of with losses, went to equal fights, till we finally were able to shoot a lot of targets and had minor to no losses.
---
Sure, there will always be a fight, you'll be heavily outnumbered, outsmarted or else. But you gotta get a feeling, for when its better to extract your fleet, or you are able to stay in the fight.
---
FCing, is learning by doing. We could give you all the information, and you'd still be sh!t.   
---
And very important: Talk with experienced people in your fleet/ your other FC, what you could have done better.   
---
  
---
Hope this can help you.
---
&gt; Anyone saying snuff isn’t part of the imperium is deluting themselves.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I'm ok with that if we agree TRI is panfam
---
It's just some friendly trash talk, don't get so butt hurt over a game.
---
Thanks for this comment, made my day! :D
---
Ouch, right in the morale.

whats wrong with hookers? isnt it only way you are able to touch something different than your keyboard?

Do you remember the name of the pilot or the killmail? That situation has happened to me multiple times when I solo roam lol

Turn on active tank.

[u/Mondschweif](https://www.reddit.com/user/Mondschweif) a little update for you :)  
---
First: who the fuck came up with the name "Nu Pure Blind" lol  
---
Second:  The Weekend Warriors  are no longer to be found in PB they have moved out! and are right now in Detroid flying with WinterCo
---
Well, it does now have tabs. Which is something.
---
Go to bed
---
What is the fix? The whole point of this change was to prevent courier scamming. If you block out deliveries via ACL then courier scamming is back. If you block asset saftey then we all throw a party and move back out of null.
---
CCP has created a situation you cant win all sides of.
---
You too guy.
---
Working...
---
Then why did you say they were awful?
---
Your always working it seems.
---
It seems the fun fights have come to an end. Happened much sooner than I expected with PHorde.
---
I fear all that remains is waiting for the alliance to kick their crutches out from under them and beat them to death with our crutches.
---
yea
---
1. Exploration is a grate place to start, you can quickly make several times the value of your ship, and it is significantly ore engaging the mining or ratting. You will probably lose your sip a lot, but even one successful site in null-sec or wormhole space can easily net you the value of your ship, and often times much more. Also, being very low SP doesn't mean you can't effectively PvP. Take [this guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bi9kwl/lately_i_started_hitting_hard_with_my_thrasher/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) as as an example of how a new player can be successful in PvP. He's a bit older the 2 days, but after of only a month of actively PvPing, he has already won his first 2v1. Exploration also segways easily into PvP as you can both explore and hunt other explorers simultaneously. That's how I got started.
---
2. Essentially yes, but it is a bit more nuanced then that. missioning with one corp will hurt you standings with that faction's enemies through derived standings, but the loss in usually minimal. You lose most of your standing from shooting faction aligned rats, though this can be avoided by not taking those missions. See [EVE Survival](https://eve-survival.org/wikka.php?wakka=HomePage) for a good reference. The derived standing problem can be fixed bu switching who you mission for every now and then. as long as you keep your standing above -2 with a particular faction their faction police won't bother you.
---
3. Combat anomalies and cosmic signatures won't hurt your standing with anyone other then the pirate factions, but those standings aren't important unless you want to run missions in NS. Otherwise just avoid shooting HS faction rats and change who you mission for every couple weeks and you should be fine. An overview of standing mechanics can be found [here](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/NPC_standings). Also, security missions are the best type of normal mission for making ISK.
---
4. My first billion came from blowing up a low power structure in a WH, it dropped over 20 bil and my share came out to around 1.2 \~ 1.7 bil. If you just want to PvP then PLEX is a good alternative. 500 PLEX will fund a lot of frigates to go lose in faction warfare. Something else you could look at is frigate abyssal sites. You will need a decent about of SP to run higher level ones, but the frigate ones can be run with friends and lower tiers have significantly lower requirements so far as SP and player skill.
---
5. Though not something you asked. I'd also strongly recommend you look into joining a corporation. It is a great way to meet other players and you will learn a lot from it. EVE University is a great new player corp focused specifically on teaching new players. Signal Cartel is another good option if you enjoy exploration. There are also several NS based new player corps, most of the major null-blocks have at least one.
---
Eww american infidel
---
pgl reprocesses his coalitions morale locally
---
God it's almost like a war where the fights go back and forth
---
I like wars that last.
---
Props to you man
---
Please explain though. How you can stomach running t3s in a caracal, losing pretty much every time you enter pvp pocket. 
---
I mean caracal is cheap and everything, so with the amount of empty pockets you're probably even isk positive.
---
But holy shit must this be soul crushing.
---
Must be a difference in FCs then and/or situations
---
TAPI is finally showing it's ability to have balls without goons holding their hands.
---
Even better cycle through dscan settings.
---
Remember the one time we in SV came to whore on a rorq kill while you guys burned it with your dracs. Love the video when we Pop up and someone goes "oh shit"
---
See my exact point. People dig up these sht like nothings wrong with it.
---
Nah i think its fit to make them know and to warn them so they dont have to go through what i went through. Gettit goonie?
---
I'd pass
---
Yeah tried that. But nope nevermind them. Imma just play my game
---
[removed]
---
Cool thing bruv. Thats albion. You dont lose 1000 dollar worth sht. I got to freakin t8 with 50$ invested. And thats a meme post. You can get banned for making a merc guild in albion. See even you goonies spies dont get sht. God hahaha 😂
---
the intricate politics of who works with who to frag someone else are super fun.
---
"I make tax income for the corp" = you're a dirty krab
---
Your loss.
---
That's literally how it's always been. The annoying part of CCP being based in Europe, and there's presumably enough people involved in running a mass test that it isn't feasible to do on a weekend.
---
So, no matter what time they do it, a group gets shafted.
---
If you don't care about Pvp, the Pvp will care about you
---
Can't even defend your rorqs and ratting supers from bb and you expect us to believe your going to take care of horde?  Gtfo
---
You do you boo.
---
Use a clean alt with good background ;)
---
Definately
---
Nah its not about brave. Its more about. I found home already here in horde. And i think it would be shitty to come close to legacy again after i yeeted outta there without any saying and went to delve. And besides. Why would you guys want a "spy" thats blacklisted with people youre allies with?
---
No idea, after 16 years it just comes somehow into my hands ;) (t2 bpo lottery anyone ?)
---
My fucking hero.
---
still more exciting than camping Forsaken Hubs in a VNI.
---
Yeah whats wrong about saying dont accept player isk donations if you have a plan of joining the ALMIGHTY IMPERIUM ALLIANCE, i did not say to not join imperium. I specifically said dont accept isk shit if you wanna join. Lol
---
Did you even read the post goonie? 😂
---
Which is still more fun than chasing after booshing ravens
---
Dungarmatic
---
Even? Made me spill my tea, gj on that.  
---
No, it's quite far from even actually. You called a war, didn't manage to take any important objective, fed on multiple occasions, issued a really really really worrying emergency alliance update etc  
---
Calling it "even" is goon level turbospin :D
---
Dropping an application out of the blue without a single word in it.
---
for close to 15 years now :)
---
We aren't blue with goons as such. From what i understand we have a "we don't invade you, you don't invade us" type policy set up where we are still allowed to shoot at each other all day. And everyone in brave is a spy.
---
Yeah, you're elite, we know. Now stfu when grown-ups are talking.
---
Theres way too many of them.
---
LOL @ end up.
---
I was a sed miserable man ever since i was born. 
---
What is your excuse?
---
Hum... i'm interested. what is Nomading ? Bashing WH structures ?
---
Why would i? Yopu tell me.
---
Because i clearly don't. :D
---
Oh I agree, but it's not a case of government regulation to prevent them from doing so; that's silly. There are pricing protection policies in certain socialist economies to protect consumers from price hikes in goods deemed essential, but nothing in the example TrashAccount121 gave above is actually illegal in RL, so not sure why he's citing it as an example of something that would go awry.
---
I didn't participate in the last test. And can't on this one either. But what I heard is that the test was very successful and stable except for very high memory usage. What was the problem you had?
---
Yes, I would also dream to be able to start EVE anew. All the chances that would open up...  
---
Well, all the organisations that are at the lead right now would be back there in no time - because their advance is not the time they had on the server, but the organisation, experience and tools.  
---
No, anyone who understands how EVE works and what makes it the game it is today would never suggest to whipe the history away.
---
I predict that 64-bit operating systems will be outdated before that happens
---
Those things owned. You had this stupid badly specced frigate rolling around with ridiculous cruise missiles with the added hell of the frigs sig radius. Cheap chaos.   
---
I still rue the day they replaced the stealth bombers cruise missiles for torps. Frigate sized T2 cruise missiles meant you could put yourself well beyond tackle range, uncloak at 60km off target, dump a handful of cruise missiles off,  and warp out before they can even respond. You couldn't kill much on your own, but a handfull of you could create an awesome amount of almost risk free \*harrassment\*. (I'd actually throw a passive targetter, as it'd get you a few seconds more time before they'd notice your lock, often enough time for the missile to hit before they could warp out. That was a controversial fit though.
---
so rifter proliferation is a problem as well correct ?
---
The big point of it is CCP wanting people to move to citadels with the removal of the NPC stations from null. Since those are unkillable (or were) it meant that you could always find a way to remove assets from them long term. Imagine if citadels drop loot, no way to get things safe. People wouldn't want to risk stuff there, or base out of them. Also because coming back to the game and finding all your stuff is gone would fuck people off pretty badly. Obvs wormholes are different because "reasons" but there has been a huge switchover which is what CCP wanted.
---
actually toxic
---
"even" reffered to the "ohmagewd, tapai is only feeding frt" BR from OP compared to the latest 2 bigger fights from the last 2 days I posted. Maybe im just fed up with seeing all the BR´s of  10000+ alliances fighting a 100  men brawl, wow. 
---
Also i aint called a shit of a war, neither did anything else you accuse me of.
---
I always enjoy the fight even if it is going to be an obvious loss. It makes me smile though. It is fun. It requires focus to fly very well for a decent little chunk of time. Plus, I have killed 2 gilas, taken countless more to timer. I have been able to extract a few bounties, which I haven't found possible in years. Sometimes the pvp room is empty so I get a free cladistic cache which gives a nice little payout too.
---
This guy gets way too salty, we killed his ratting rorqual while ago. He spent almost an hour raging. He needs to stop being so brave as to rat in lowsec with a capital..
---
Just like the tireless VNI ratters of FRAT, always working. Can't help but admire the dedication needed to rat 23 hours a day.
---
What you describe sounds very complex and prone to failure compared to a rudimentary machine learned text recognition program. There are hundreds of ships in the game, and they will each appear in three different variations on the overview (neutral, -5, -10 stadings), so you need to store three visual representations for each. And then you're assuming that what you see on SiSi that first time is going to be the same (to the pixel) as what your scout sees on TQ - not a single pixel changes brightness, etc. That might be reliable or not - I'm not quite sure frankly. But a text recognition machine would sort this out really quickly. 
---
The triangulation idea sounds kinda interesting (you'd need 4 observers to pinpoint  a position in 3d space). Figuring out their direction of movement would be the tricky part though, you'd have to just extrapolate from their last few positions and assume they kept going the same direction. 
---
Anyways, my original point is that all this is majorly difficult compared to what the bots are doing now, which is reading a text file, and my point still stands factually.
---
before outposts there were conquerable stations, which were quite rare (~3 per region). Then POSs, then outposts.
---
Wow if you bought the Omega with real cash it would literally be equal to what my monthly salary was 2 years ago.
---
gf!
---
this is from Brave's slack yesterday https://i.imgur.com/ILfdPra.png 
---
doesnt include the komodo fed "before the war officially started"
---
seems pretty even eh?
---
What i dont understand is why you arent rolling a cheap orthrus at least, which has the potential to kill  most krab gilas.
---
Is it a roleplay thing?
---
I mean they ARE the most battle hardened group out there.
---
wow ur fc is terrible
---
They just invested a lot into bringing Serenity up to the current level - they won't let it down right away.  
---
Also, they need to have a different server for the chinese market, so there will always be (a) Serenity
---
The absolute state of EVE 2k19: Deposit your items into any hostile structure and then automagically teleport them to safety. I would laugh if it weren't so sad.
---
Its not the isk. I had a similar situation when I joined, I Was questioned to. Difference is, I didn't come from a direct enemy.  You did. Plus I had nothing to hide.  I really doubt you gave the full story.
---
tracking is important
---
you the one that caught me with that over heated web right!
---
Honestly I can still kill most of those gilas in the caracal and tbh I kinda get off on doing it in a cheap af ship. I think it was maybe sniper bros or somebody gave me 500m and I bought a couple orthrus and fit them up. They are ready to go I just haven't taken them out yet. Also I'm just kind of cheap.
---
I am not joking, or making fun. I simply dont care thats all.
---
Holy fuck please stop posting forever.
---
Post history still worse than this sub
---
I had nothing to hide. I even begged hard to give me a chance. And told everything. But considering you have that paranoid tone too. Sounds like it runs in the alliance. Good day to you too
---
Takes a special kind of hypocritical human being to post like this.
---
Basically. Imperium would rather have test on our borders than horde or frat. Simple as that. As for allies, the imperial legacy wartime coalition died when we won the war against Frat. HRE. NC/PL/PH. GOTG and whoever else I forgot. Test is 100% shoot on site to imperium. Only exception is the occansional fleet fight were we have similar goals.
---
You cannot come to an existing geopolitical landscape and just "carve out your own sov". You need to build up first, which means using diplomacy to get a starting point.

I can´t cause i am not sad.

Dont misunderstand an interview with a damn straight interrogation. I wasnt interviewed cause when i joined tnt i was interviewed and the people who interviewed me saw nothing wrong with my story. Then i was interrogated by your intelligence agency and sht. And the feeling wasnt the same.
---
Funnily enough the only real chance you had was to abuse their propless drake. 
---
That was a bad call from them but yeah, would have been tough to adapt to that in time.
---
i still feel shitty about shooting a brave pilot and then realizing i was in the john belicose system...shout out to brave for not holding grudges and giving me a cyno ship non the less. o7
---
Exactly my thoughts, but my budget is 500 plex. I still run PI alts on a 4 day cycle but If I forget about them for a week it doesn't bother me.
---
I like how all of you read mor into that just to get your selfs worked up.
---
I made exactly one post about the loss.
---
&gt;At some point you have to ask, why do I spend my time this way?
---
Well, maybe you should ask that yourself.
---
Nomading is YOLOing through all the c5 PVE sites in a couple of dreadnaughts, stealing other peoples content. It's risky but 9/10 you make more than what you lose and the occasional bout where you rampage unhindered for 8-9 hours pays for the occasional loss. You use cheaply fit dreads to minimize insurance losses when they eventually die or when you S/D them because there's no chain back to HS. Prowler brings blue loot to HS fairly safely.
---
I only have 1 dread alt is it still doable ? Thanks for the tips btw i would love to try that :)
---
c5 WHs are still good isk, not super entertaining but ok.
---
i mean, what did you expect from this sub? it's filled with addicts and people who don't really care. First ones don't complain much, second ones just move to another games and have no reason for an internet war.
---
look who i am replying to, look what pov he posted
---
activate your brain and conclude who I am calling terrible, I am aware independent thought is difficult for you since I only repeated an instruction once but i have faith you will be able to pull through for me here.
---
What
---
The reason there is so much other stuff in the trade window was cause we chatted for a bit, 
---
He linked the bhaals as proof the others were real. 
---
And offered me bigger discounts on bulk deals
---
I think alt+tab allows you to do that
---
pretty
---
You begged to remain in a alliance that you are now trashing? Sounds like your bitter. Bitter people dont survive in Goonswarm anyway. So sounds like the Goon Counterintelligence Agency (Never heard of them btw) helped you out. Go back to Horde if ya want. Enjoy the game.  Go shoot somebody, welp a fleet or demolish your enemies fleets.
---
Dual nestor + leshak in C5 :)

Oh, that sounds correct.
---
 Reupload cause picture didn’t work.
---
 
---
I don't know whether I just avoided a scam I have never seen or missed a good deal. would appreciate feedback.
---
what happend:
---
player opened trade with me offering an Armageddon navy issue for 500mil. which would be a good deal. (searched ANI in market and they are worth 600mil)
---
I am however suspicious of all trade windows. so tried to check if anything was off.
---
name of ship in trade checks out. (ANI)
---
right click and show info checks out. (ANI)
---
right click and show market details takes me to bhaalgorns…?
---
anyone know how he could change the name and show info of a ship in trade chat to link from a bhaal to an Armageddon navy issue. or was it a bug showing the wrong market info?
---
I am a fan of a good scam, but this one seems to be doing something funky with actual game mechanics.
---
Like the three shells?
---
Yea you're replying to me... My ticker is BL, my AAR is from a WinterCo prospective. I just added the brave pov because no one else has.

So sure, let's talk about brain activation.

2000 PLEX a month is quite a lot of isk to welp each months. But if you rather welp big ships rather than small ones why not

just awox them and make more alts to awox them with

Could it be assembled bhaalgorn named ANI?
---
Should AWOX, then post.

Keep going like this and it might  last forever.
---
Alliances are blind to boting. It helps their economy grow. Its bad,  I agree. But I do not know what can be done about it without negatively effecting non botters.
---
It's not like he can't get another character in for that
---
Could be for the name, but the right click show info linking to ANI as well?
---
Want a real head scratcher?
---
Every gun platform in the game has one skill for both long and short range variants of the platform - i.e large hybrid, small projectile.
---
Missiles however are separate, and often have different multipliers, whilst individually being equal or larger than their pew pew counterpart.
---
Crazy
---
Inclined to agree. The two ships have slightly different icons, and that’s a Bhaal icon, not an ANI icon.
---
This.
---
Elo op
---
ok lets talk
---
well i think it is enough that leader of snuff told that penif apologized one of the people affected for this
---
&gt;but the right click show info linking to ANI as well?
---
I have my doubt. Are you sure about that?
---
They can't, they use them as a meat shield. Plus this whole bridging titans onto the muninn fleet was vilys idea.
---
Trajectory analysis is falloff

For future events to be streamed we need to have some updates to allow the tool to be possible in 2 arenas, this allows for a quicker match turnaround time (5-10mins vs 25-30)
---
When Frat make TEST n Friends bend the knee, just as the had too, then Ill be impress, until then, meh, some battle won, some lost.
---
It's a relatively new feature that, among other things, fixes a load of undesirable shipping scams.
---
Post the system on this forum...
---
You won't get any response for a bot report. CCP won't discuss player bans with other players. The only way to see something happened is to see that they never log in again. If nothing happens, it's possible that they determined that these guys aren't botting. Make sure you used the bot reporting tool though and not email or support tickets to report them.
---
My guess would be that finding information on third party websites is part of the Eve Gameplay for a while now and differentiates the different levels of Players.
---
Integrating it would also make focusing one/few ships way worse since everyone who can rub 2 neurons together could see your last fit (if you died) or the weapons you used to kill your last victim and counter you pretty badly.
---
That sweet vni loot, must be worth at least 15 mill!
---
Another awesome video.
---
Your productions values are fantastic.  Thanks for all the hard work.  It really brings the game alive and makes the story line updates easier to follow.
---
If leader of snuff say that penif apologized people from init for it then, well ... it is enough for me.
---
Sorry, there are real players in those systems too. I don't wanna screw over real players by giving away their system names. That's why I didn't post landscaper or Vanguard names either. I like PH and don't wanna hurt any of their real players. :(
---
whoa
---
They will be released over the coming days
---
"Didn't respond to me"
---
"Condone botting"
---
So do you have any evidence or are you just one of those people
---
STOP FUNDING THE ENEMY!
---
Damn I guess, they’ll be using those warriors against us now :(
---
&gt; submitted a ticket to CCP waiting for response.          
---
this is obvious bug.      
---
You could try to repackage the ship ... but as this is some **serious** bug it is better to let CCP check it out and fix it.
---
Check Zkill?
---
The other option is someone blanketing the whole region :D
---
haha, that works too.
---
I guess that works too...
---
Maybe say when the least people are ratting those systems maybe i or someone else is able to pass them up. With the names and since they might be ratting 23/7 it should be easy to scout them
---
I mean you should probably let some one more useful than landscapers know :tharreling:, like someone in VG. Its now dealt with.
---
Mean ol' Hedliner
---
Please... Just no. Stop
---
Asking the important questions before thinking of going. I would ask the same.
---
Ooooof
---
Ccp would have to pay for it to be included into the game directly. Why should they pay for something people can access for free
---
The prizes are:
---
First place: Apostle Lavacore Imperial SKIN and 500 PLEX per player.
---
Second place: Drekavac Metamateria Exotica SKIN and 200 PLEX per player
---
Third place: Hecate Caille Neon SKIN and 100 PLEX per player
---
whoops
---
Fly safe bruv
---
i have literally seen a bot getting awoxed and purged a while back.  Just get it to the right people.
---
For once I agree with you Orion
---
Hey if your alliance leadership isn't willing to active purge bots then i would suggest moving on, [Dreddit is recruiting!](https://dredditisrecruiting.com) our leadership will respond to any and all bot reports and actually investigate and deal with it, you'll hear all kind of bad shit about Dreddit and Test on reddit but at the end of the day we don't condone botting and our leadership actually deals with it and won't just stone wall you.
---
Sorry m8, you'll never hear from CCP. They'll just lose track of your ticket.
---
It's missing a "d" (gnihihi) in armageddon. So this is a scam.
---
when inactives from other corps in the alliance who somehow haven't been purged yet decide to comment on your applications
---
you'd be surprised how often applying directly to a corp in game with "cyno alt" as your description gets you in
---
Test is renting out omist to botting alliance KWG
---
&gt;I brought it up in corp chats and most of the "Made Men" Vanguard members answered with, "Eve has Bots, just accept it."
---
That's interesting, when I search for those words on Discord I don't see them...
---
there is grieving in eve online, but the threshold for it is way higher than in most other games
---
trajectotyes are hard man!
---
This is possible. The first seven or so are static IIRC, but you can use the last few (8, 9, 0) hotkeys for custom scan profiles.
---
never use trade windows, ask for personal contract
---
Check zkill of what or whom though... 
---
Maybe I'll run a locator agent on anette1 or something...
---
All big alliances pretend to not see anything. I live in Imprerium and everyone just pretends not to see them. The isk botters pay is just too good to pass for everyone.
---
&gt; Has Eve really become so bot infested that corps are openly indifferent to them now?
---
Yes.
---
&gt; Should I start botting just to keep up with the meta?
---
Probably.
---
&gt; Worst part is, the landscapers I messaged before will probably kick my character from corp because I'm posting this to Reddit, but the bots will get to keep going.
---
Definitely.
---
They didn't stay docked, they were ordered to redock.
---
Yea propably, but I have faith.
---
You don't say.
---
“EVE has bots, accept it”
---
That is not what EVE is. You can shape that reality.
---
You know how...
---
Why the fuck should you be kicked?
---
Message a Diri and they will take care. As PH dont Support any known Bots, Racism or other unsocial things, someone will do something about that.
---
Dont post it in the normal Channel. PM a Landscaper. If they dont do anything, PN a director and tell them what the Landscaper answered. They will get rid of him :-)
---
And loyal to their allies unless there is isk involved.
---
Why didn't you write to the director of his corporation or NBI? For example, I, the director of one of the corporations, did not see any references to bots.
---
It depends on where you roam. I think tho if you're strong enough and have a strategy you can also win fights where you're outnumbered. 
---
If you roam in lowsec btw, roam in FW space, even if Dscan can tell you if you're going to have a 1v1 or an 'unfair' fight. If you're in a frigate and see a Merlin, but you also see a jaguar or a dramiel, there are chances that even if they're not allied, those ships would backup for 2 easy kills.
---
 if you roam in null btw try delve/esoteria/geminate/stain. For null sec roaming it can happen that you die to gatecamps so the best thing is to have your stuff hauled there yet.
---
i mean tbh i think eve's kinda stale meta these days contributes to this ie we all know roughly how a retribution is fit
---
lol this is just a packaged bhaal called "armagedon navy issue". notice the missing "d" in "armageddon"
---
every renter alliance is full of bots and we cannot directly police that, we do however directly police our alliance and corps.
---
Welcome to \~\~Black Desert Online\~\~ EVE
---
It only took it going public for Horde to do the right thing?
---
How long would they of been left to continue botting if this was not brought to light on Reddit?
---
Proper corps kick cheaters. It's not common. Be happy if you get kicked and search yourself a proper corp.
---
Old scam, renaming a ship and trying to pass it off as a more expensive model.
---
I think you just had a brainfart at the show info part.
---
Active modul bug? Oh boy... Losing multi bil ships in the abyss to this shit and you will only get an automated response: Our logs does not show anything strange.
---
At least relog worked for me when it happened in regular space...
---
Had a fortizar unpackage in a transport orca. Wouldn't anchor. Talked to a GM, the fucker was still fit. Odd time
---
Why didn't u write to NBI or dir of his corp? I'm the director for a corporation in the PH and I didn't seen any reports regarding our members using 3rd party software for the automation of the ratting process.
---
You won’t. We aren’t exactly on friendly terms in terms of alliance relationship but when I reported a known bot to your leadership they removed them instantly. It’s always a constant whack a mole scenario and imo I think CCP is overwhelmed.
---
All alliances have botters. It doesn't matter if it's test, fraternity, goonswarm or pandemic horde. All alliances somehow tolerate them.
---
Actually legacy propaganda is showing frt as "botting" alliance.
---
Through last 3 months I have been collecting data about botting and these data clearly shows that currently top "botter" is goonswarm (4,72%). On the second position is ph(4,64%), then, kwg(4,32%), fi.re(3,98%), frt(3,97%) and  legacy (3,90%). That % shows amount of online botters to all online players. This is of course average value obtained by checking over 50k players during last 3 months. I was not including holy rental and many others as I need more time to obtain results from their territories. If I was unable to determine if player is botter or not I assumed he is botter (7,52% of all tested players).
---
You're also the definition of a krab tho so lol
---
So your evidence that the so called bot have been ratting 23/7 is you logging in at random hours and seeing the character online? Only CCP has logs of time spent online, if you reported to CCP and they took no action that means there is nothing wrong, you are just seeing what you want to see.  
---
If year was 2009, there would be people making botting whine threads but instead of chinese they would be russian. I have not seen a script that automates tidious gameplay in EVE that actually works and makes you a ISK profit, just rumors and phishing site trying to get you to share credit card details.
---
the only part that is true is : "Leadership actually deals with it"   
---
Yep, Test has indeed a solid deal with KWG!
---
Spodbrain thinks he'š stronk
---
Says a goon lmao
---
do you find thats on both commentators?
---
but mittens with the quote out of context!
---
CENSORSHIP PROTOCOL FAILED, POST MADE IT THRU, RED ALERT RED ALERT!
---
Post names and proof and one way or another it will be sorted
---
Are you for real contesting the existance of ratting bots in Eve?
---
Usually with a dozen titans and a kick
---
fix is to only allow plastic wraps to be delivered into citadels?
---
It's simple. Why put stuff in a destroable station when you could pack in out post. "When they where still in the game." Or npc stations.
---
It's basically the idea off. If you lose everything when it goes up people would just stage out of npc stations.
---
Because in the old days you couldn't lose you stuff in a station if you were afk for a period of time. You could always get it back. So this system keeps that going.
---
You guys are the reason the kiki went from 70M to 140M. Pls stop.
---
I don't speak for leadership but Horde is 100% against bots as far as I'm aware. Any spotted and reported correctly will always be purged. There was obviously a failure in communication somewhere and OP should have tried following it up internally before coming to reddit. 
---
Still 3 possible bots in an alliance with 18k characters isn't too bad is it?
---
And by that, you mean the messenger was rightfully shot, right?
---
&gt;Still 3 possible bots in an alliance with 18k characters isn't too bad is it?
---
Can't weed them all out, unfortunately.
---
The more people, the more bots slip in :S
---
Do you really think this issue is unique to Horde?
---
Here are some of the other big alliances that also have bitters hiding amongst there ranks.
---
Goons
---
Test
---
PL
---
NC.
---
Darkness
---
Every single renter alliance in the game
---
Players know botting is an issue. We reeeee about it all the time. It's supposed to be CCPs job to take care of it because kicking and awoxing people based off accusation alone is stupid. Which means you need hard proof  or a director needs to witness it enough to act on the botter.
---
7o John.
---
As someone who is new and hasn't tried joining a corp yet, what is an API?
---
test eagles and panda muninns https://zkillboard.com/related/30002169/201904300500/
---
But where is XIX and FI.RE?
---
&gt;fucking up wars
---
  &gt;PIRAT
---
  Hey I thought everyone in PIRAT said they don't care about the war changes?
---
You live in Delve so that's up to you.
---
Pretty sure it's up to you to stand behind your implications.
---
Don't worry you are not in Goonswarm, you'll not be kicked for report bots
---
&gt; The first seven or so are static
---
This has always driven me out of my mind, why take up 7 hotkey slots with horrible presets and not let us select our own?
---
&gt;literally only logs in when there are fleet pings.
---
&gt;it a krab lolololol
---
Ok dude.
---
I'm not, I'm contesting the existance of VNI pilots being bots, one can probably automate mining or market stuff, but null sec ratting doesn't seem easy to account for all hazards
---
I just wanted to thank you for your positive dedication to this game and its community even when met with all the bullshit from CCP. 
---
It's a refreshing outlook.
---
Why pay for something that people will do for free
---
yeah. you wont go on anything but SRP'd fleets cause you dont want to lose your precious ships, and you make isk to make isk to make isk.
---
krab.
---
&gt;Make it fast, functional and actually fun to use
---
So nothing like a CCP product?
---
Shoot me the information you have in a DM on reddit or on discord. I'll forward it to the right people.
---
Srp'd fleets are the only ones there are. Not my fault
---
Always AWOX bots
---
that is idiotic
---
Yup those are def bhaals. Just look at the icon closely
---
All the big blocs are cool with botting, it’s the new r64
---
We have a constellation we took off FEDUP, in Pure Blind. There are 10 systems between our claim there and the closest INIT system. In that regard we are closer with Tri (only 7 systems)... oh, and I guess we have one system claimed in Cloud Ring. No idea why. Logistics?
---
As for standings, we are generally light blue with INIT and IM, but not their associats or any other imperium alliances or their allies. I'm not sure if the light-blue standing is permanent either, as we had been neutral for a while, even shot each other a bit. I guess we set it for fights vs Tri?
---
Thanks for the answer!
---
For now I'm avoiding PvP because my friend doesn't know much about the game and there is a ton to learn (and I need te re-learn a lot ^^). I have no doubt someone who knows what they are doing can beat a lot of people with better ships, but you gotta know what you're doing. I imagine myself PvPing as a middle schooler trying to fight an mma fighter ^^.
---
2. I already have -3.17 (social skills are still low) for angel cartel from the few starting missions, so if I travel through the curse region (their region), I should get attacked? If I go past -2 can I still make it up?
---
I have my updated permit and praise James the savior of high sec
---
Yeah.. I missed class to be at 9-4 in a Thanny I had just trained into. It was supposed to be this big thing and I was so proud of that ship. I killed two squads of fighters in 4 hours and then we recalled and jumped out.
---
I don't know how many botting scripts you've looked at like you put it, but a ratting bot has to be the easiest to write of all Eve bots.  
---
They were the first bots to surface in the game a loooong time ago and today are used for VNIs up to supers to infinitely chain nullsec anoms.  
---
Your reply almost feels like trolling because this is very common knowledge, but HTH in any case.
---
Might have missed it...but how did you 'nearly get caught' @ 11:30? I get that local spiked...were you 'nearly caught' coz they couldve combatted you down + decloaked you?
---
Most of the time there's no issues, but I need to recreate my UI once every year or so as a result of what I can only assume is because I copy the profile to other chars. For example, whenever I leave a fleet, the fleet window disappears and I cannot reopen it until I've right clicked the icon and hit 'close window' first. Nothing happens if I keep clicking the fleet window shortcut from the neocom before I close it. This is such a minor issue that I haven't bothered to redo my UI, but I know that the time will come soon when I have to.
---
Which system?
---
In general, whenever CCP feels it might not meet its desired numbers for the given month/quartal.
---
I doubt Horde would condone botting. You should have poked the people higher up.
---
CCP never follows up on Bot Reports because they do a Ban Wave every so ofter so the botters can't (easy) deduce how they were detected.
---
Hol'up
---
You kicked a member for reddit shitposting?
---
Not at all true. Get two or three friends in a fleet and go kill TEST krabs or renters or standing fleets. Viola, non SRP fleet.
---
Oh right, you hate any pvp that isnt required to maintain your isk grinding status quo.
---
Krab.
---
'flamboyant behavior'
---
lmao. name checks out
---
o7 fly safe capsuleer.
---
I go day-tripping into dronelands and do sigs, i actually get around 50-70mil per site surprisingly.
---
Other than that its the good ol' VNI alt.
---
Also the wiser business-choice. He might meet him again and earn another billion.
---
random linemember #34123 think he actually does anything relevant in game
---
i have the feeling that Eagles in test have about as much lifespan as a catalyst in code
---
&gt; Has Eve really become so bot infested 
---
you've triggered very sensitive fanboys fam . Wait for wave of hate and suspicious
---
Be careful. Highsec mining corps are not really good places for new players. I recommend joining a group with a respectable PVP wing, even if you don't want to PVP, it's often a decent sign that they're not just out to profit off of new player labor.
---
Nah u tell them what to buy after u bought it. So they spike prices for you ^^
---
america and freedom lol. its not even a full democracy anymore and far from the top of any of those "freedoms" linked.
---
To add on this: botting bans come in waves. Bots won't get banned individually. So it might take a couple of weeks to see results.
---
Just want to confirm that horde does not condone botting afaik
---
Example of a reported bot getting awoxed: https://zkillboard.com/kill/70793291/
---
Me either. Kind of doubt this part happened.
---
Which koolaid you on m8? I think ya take this whole thing a bit to serious
---
Isn't it also the fact that a heavy NOS is rarely ever useful since you're gonna have more cap than your targets most of the time (even when you're close to running out)?
---
Was clean until 21 million. 
---
Last corp I joined gave me 500 mil and a large skill injector when I joined.
---
So far I've purchased 2 more. War is coming and I need to get ready.
---
&gt;complains about krabs. 
---
&gt;complains when people play eve in a way that allows them to krab as little as possible, and PvP as much as possible. 
---
The cognitive dissonance is fucking real, boys and girls.
---
I would think May would be a good time for one with it being Eve's birthday.
---
But this is CCP we're talking about.
---
I love the use of the words "has to be". Just because you believe something doesn't make it true. I invite you to try it, if you can create a script that correctly learns not to bug itself trying to dock because it can't tell the difference between possible threat and no threat then you have created Artificial Life and you can sell that to NASA and make a fortune.
---
I’ve been doing stuff with CCP for 3 years, I knew what I was getting myself into :)
---
&gt;This would be bad for new players
---
&gt;I'm an old player so idc
---
ok buddy lol
---
Did you think they would kick the guy in 3 seconds without evidence and investigation? Give your head a shake. You did the right thing by reporting them. As the saying goes, broadcast once fucking shut up after. Jesus man. Let leadership do what they have to do and stop whining.
---
I screwed up my warp so i sat in my cyno spot with the titan with a cyno up as local spiked, obviously nothing actually landed on grid but as far as things going wrong while moving, it wasn't ideal given that Ivana were hunting me :)
---
and years of "reporting blues for botting is goonfucking" and Elusif proudly asking people to "Buy my Eve gold".
---
Except that you're PvPing as little as possible in order to maintain your fleet quotas and not be kicked from KF so you can collect isk in peace to pay for an omega account, so you can continue to collect isk in peace and continue collecting isk in peace and so on.
---
So yes, the cognitive dissonance is very real.
---
time sinks
---
**Boring, but easy trading**
---
I have maxed out trading skills. The initial process of creating an item mega-list took quite a while. Now I go through it few times a month to update/create orders. It's all very tedious and boring. If you stay out of Jita you can do this fairly casually.
---
**Cool and easy exploring**
---
Exploring sites in WHs/null is a laugh. Plenty of pilots out there looking to kill explorers so you have to be aware of what's going on around you. Null sec is way safer due to local. In WHs you will mostly only be aware of being hunted when your attacker decloaks next to you :)
---
Oh right, that actually makes sense..
---
Not a recruiter anymore, but a former one. My biggest pet peeve would be people who need me to walk them through literally everything, and then go afk for weeks after being active (usually as a PVEr) for like two days. Then they come back and do something particularly special like hauling BPOs in jita in an untanked iteron.  
---
Yes that actually happened. It was a kid that inherited their dad's 10 year old eve account. After that incident, I put an age requirement on the corp.
---
See case Brisc, do you now understand what "reporting blues is goonfucking" means?
---
That would definitely makes sense, just realized eve’s 16th birthday is in May, but that last part is what I was expecting to see in this thread hahah
---
No, I PvP as much as my free time allows.
---
This is a game, and isn't that high up my priorities.
---
In December, apparently I was one of the top 5 people in fleet participation. I PvP as much or as little as I want.
---
2 wrongs doesn't make a right
---
Actually, i do not really know, but this seems about as reasonable reason as any. 
---
Coupled with the timing on the last "sale" -15% on plexing, which perfectly coincided with the end of the first quartal of 2019. And the login "free" SP for everybody at the exactly same time only cemented my conviction, that the timing was everything, but coincidental.
---
Kick him for chatting in corp channel.
---
Oh I remember when I first started playing.
---
I was streaming my first few days because I didn't know anything about opsec and information management in eve.
---
Got raided by a random pvper for 80 people, Tweeted out by CCP Staff, donated 100 mil ISK. They told me, once the time comes, I should repay the favor.
---
That was 2 years ago.
---
2 days ago, was the day. A new bro was hosted by someone for 200 viewers. Chatted with him for abit, helped him finish his beginner missions and donated him 100 mil after some time.
---
IM is just an alliance for corps that recently joined Init, but otherwise they're the same as Init. They're full members of the imperium, to my knowledge
---
Not necessarily. I used to kill bot rattlers and barghests a few years ago when they used those and they brought a new one the next day after getting killed. I only managed to kill them on two or three days before they would get banned. I reported them every time I killed them.
---
Mighthave been in game.
---
you take that back, I hear he's your personal saviour
---
Dock up your faction supers and titans.
---
\^ this, and the missing D is because player given names cant be more than 20 characters
---
the scam is really old and most know it
---
You seem to forget Orthodox easter is still a pretty enormous holiday as there are around 360 million slavic people and on top of that nordic countries which are also orthodox
---
god no. leave it as it is.
---
they would find a way to fuck it up
---
But with the combined might of line member #1 through line member #45635... they can do magical things
---
If you submitted a support ticket, you'll hear back, but support tickets are primarily for fixing the state of your account, for example dealing with requests for restitution or getting your account into a playable state if a defect has made it impossible to log in.
---
If you submitted a bug report, usually you will not get a response, though you may if a developer has further questions about the problems you're reporting.  You will ONLY see any such responses if you log in to your account at [bugs.eveonline.com](https://bugs.eveonline.com/).
---
To submit a support ticket, visit [support.eveonline.com](https://support.eveonline.com/).
---
To submit a bug report, the best way is to press F12 in game, then click Report Bug, preferably as soon as possible after the issue has happened.  If that's not possible for some reason, you can submit a bug report out of game at [bugs.eveonline.com](https://bugs.eveonline.com/), though that doesn't give us nearly as much information to work with in reproducing it.
---
Doing BOB's work, bless
---
Feeling the troll post..
---
The hands on approach.
---
Hi Judge, will you be open to information about other bots and forwarding it to the right people?
---
It basicly everything your account has done. Mails who youve sold to where you get your isk uour skills. Everything. ESI is the new api. Easier to track
---
It's always sad when the D is missing
---
That’s actually amazing - What kind of stuff do you end up looting most of the time?
---
Surely it would just self-destruct over and over?
---
taking bets on when you lose your virginity, keep prayin
---
&gt;It is far more likely that the guy started playing EVE recently and is wetting his feet with null sec ratting and got his ship as a donation and doesn't know how to change its name or something
---
&gt;Just because you believe something doesn't make it true.
---
You're correct there. Bot's have been in eve in one form or another since the early days, ratting bots, mining bots, bot for pretty much everything. The existence of a bot ratter is far more likely than the laundry list of 'it's far more likely'
---
One day after I pay the regular price for my subscription.
---
Lmao, funny you say that.. Last time I bought omega time, 2 days later a discount popped up..
---
Hey congrats, your argument is so strong that ratting bots don't actually exist in Eve Online! How could a mere human possibly make a script to right click in a videogame and select "warp to" on a bookmark?  Impossible!
---
Those ratters you can find most nullsec regions who are online 23 hours a day and instantly and always warp when a neutral enters local? Those are just enthusiastic players!
---
First: not me, I just "stole" it, how are they correctly named then?^^^^
---
Second: thanks. Edited accordingly.
---
Pfft, Eve is a multiboxer, afker or botter game... plus pvp for the gankers game. GF is mostly said when it wasn't.
---
Shrug, that is all you can do.. 
---
just enjoy what you can and laugh because CCPs bottom line comes from a tiny group of multiboxing players (whether botting, afking or using scripts). They CANNOT fix it because that would kill their profit per player and in that... kill the game. 
---
Per real player we are below the bottom line of any reasonable MMO.
---
Limiting the types of engagements based on only one sides perspective of fun or ability to compete does not a fun game make.
---
Thanks for the info, edited accordingly (except the tri aren't dead name ;D until i get a real one)
---
You realize that High Plex prices hurt botters, not help them right?
---
Join test
---
&gt;PVE in this game is like watching cactus grow. 
---
Love the metaphor!
---
I do some industry stuff for the local nullsec market and tiny PI on the side which actually earns quite a bit over time if you do it consistently. While the jobs are running I spent my time scanning, roaming and generally look for opportunities for fun and ISK.

Nerfing something that is obviously overpowered does mate.

Remember the ingame web browser. What a marvel of engineering.

The bloodstains should've given it away!
---
How do you know they are online 23 hours a day? Do you have a time accounting region scouting bot?
---
Or just stock 20 Eagles / Nagas / 30 corms and kill the command destroyers and the raven fleet dies.

edited (both phage and terror and infinity avenger as associated).

IM i think is still "under init" and therefore more associated than full member so i really would like to leave them under associates where IA are, too.
---
thanks for the information
---
I might have a clue, being othodox myself. Still, this does not impact numbers as much.
---
I am just worried those numbers used to be only seen in the summer, but that's a new, worrying signal.
---
There was a page named eveskunk for when the old api worked, where people could see exactly that.
---
sadly this site is no more working.
---
I was just talking about automated responses not asking for an example, but ty.
---
I can understand PvPing when your free time allows. It's a dumb video game, after all.
---
You're still a krab who does the bare minimum to continue your safe way of grinding ISK though. What I don't get is why you grind isk for the sake of grinding ISK, especially if all of the "fleet pvp" you do is already SRP'd. Why even have Omega? Most GSF fleets can be done with an alpha character. Help me understand your thought process.
---
tl;dr knocked over beer wrote a 1000 letter drama for some PC stuff.
---
Didn't mean that as a reply to your comment.  I really know nothing about GM policies or procedures on this, but I know they'll do the best they can with what information they have.
---
Doesn't really hurt them when they make the isk to buy a plex sub while the owner is asleep and the rest is pure profit.
---
Machariel massacre - kill 15 machs  , tough 100 bill releit but its like 8...epic bait-click
---
&gt; **Disclaimer 2:** If alliances  are under a '+++ Associated +++'-line, it means, that they are not  officially part of the respective coalition, but have some kind of close  "business ties" to it or however you wanna call it. 
---
Well, IM, PBLRD and SV. are all directly part of the Imperium (although PBLRD only as the rental alliance). Why SV. is a tool-alliance and IM is the recruiting alliance for INIT, they still have more than just close business ties. They are officially part of the Imperium.  
---
Snuffed Out on the other hand does not fit this in any way. They are blue to INIT atm and work together with them. But that's pretty much it. Only because alliances occur to shoot others first or work together from time to time doesn't make them part of the same coalition. The "strategically friendly ties" would also count for Imperium &amp; Legacy - but both are their own groups.   
---
Putting Snuffed Out as "tied to the Imperium" does paint a false picture imo.
---
"implications" lol
---
The past was alterable. The past never had been altered. TEST was at war with Imperium. TEST had always been at war with Imperium.
---
I don't grind isk for the sake of grinding isk.
---
I earn isk to keep my omega status, then go about the remaining time pvping, or just not logging in so I can do other things irl that are more important.
---
Which ones would those be?
---
Yes but my question was why? The pvp you do and interests you can be done with an alpha toon and you won't have to grind 2b of ISK every month.
---
That's an old one. When I started my EVE trading career, I got scammed into buying 10 Vexors thinking they were VNIs. Was expensive back then but I learnt my lesson.

&gt;ome "landscapers" on Discord. None of them have seen fit to message me back in the last 72 hours. I brought it up in corp chats and most of the "Made Men" Vanguard members answered with, "Eve has Bots, just accept it."  
---
&gt;Has Eve really become so bot infested that corps are openly indifferent to them now?  
---
&gt;Should I start botting just to keep up with the meta?
---
\^ This. PH are one of the better ones to solve the botting problem.
---
The one where you imply that nothing would have been done if he hadn't gone to reddit. The 2nd sentence is a question but implies a lot too.
---
I think its a repost....

Not my proudest moment as an fc, but you can hardly call two alliances “allies” when on hunts the other and hotdrops their 20 man fleet with 80. But then again, being part of imperium, you do have access to Mitten’s spin bike. Keep pedaling, little bee.
---
NPC destroyers have drones as a higher target priority than ships, the VNI would be feeding drones to npcs if it's not careful, how does that make economical sense? Eventually the VNI ends up defanged orbiting for nothing unless somehow it has the artifical intelligence to dock up, restock on drones, all I'm saying it is not easy to automate such a process. What happens if a dreadnaught spawns and instablaps the VNI, how do you automate for a VNI to correctly identify a threat like that?
---
Oh what do you mean overwhelmed, alphas can't do l4 missions anynmore they're handling  it just fine
---
Because alphas are shit at literally everything
---
&gt;right click and show info checks out
---
Nope, what it showed you was an assembled Bhaalgorn called Armageddon Navy Issue. The show info screen shows the ship name instead of item type when it's an assembled ship. The picture displayed will have been that of a Bhaalgorn and all the other tabs would have Bhaalgorn stats.
---
So you came to the game, within two days joined multiple entities, got several billion of isk from a good friend of yours that seemingly you don't intend to play with despite setting you up like he did and somehow it's supposed to not look fishy?
---
I wouldn't be surprised if you just bought the isk from RMTers, but either way good to know that counter intelligence works fine in Imperium. Have a good one in Horde.
---
I think the best drop I've had is a 400mill tengu wreck I found floating on a gate while roaming hisec, but I've only ever seen one like it.
---
I do FW.
---
I have two main accounts and one alt account (I do not plex them). 
---
I will either spin round and do a mission route.
---
Or do the sites and camp the gate with my one of my mains in an arty Loki to farm mods while I do it.
---
Banning in waves is more effective.
---
You may have 5-10 different tools using dissimilar techniques. If you ban all the botters using technique X, then they will just change it to technique Y.
---
If you instead ban all botters at the same time, it will be harder for the botmakers to respond with a counter-measure.
---
If you look closely, you might see those weren't mine.
---
You log in for a mass F1 fleet, with the ability to use T2 damage mods and T2 guns up to battleship level. The extra DPS you could potentially provide is inconsequential.
---
That said, you do you man. Just understand some guy somewhere thinks you're a krab.
---
Check past sales. For that see  [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Events\_and\_Offers](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Events_and_Offers)  isn't up to date though.
---
If I don't have time to log in for a few mins a week to update jobs etc to keep my omega status... how many fleets do you think I'll be able to go on as an alpha instead?
---
all of them.
---
I see you put a lot of time and effort into this post, my only question is why?
---
Makes sense, ty
---
Yer I did do abyss but the only thing cheap enough to run now at t4 are firestorm/darks.
---
And they are both pretty tough, I don't feel I am making enough isk for the risk so I've stopped doing abyss earlier this month.
---
Is a shame as it was engaging content.
---
Wow, cool scam.

Ya all we need is an in-game browser, eh

Wear it with pride

Haha

CCP: Can we interest you in our brand new SKINs? :D
---
My appologies good sir, you are correct. I could log in my Goon alt to look for some bots to post em here on Reddit but i don't care enough to do so, to be honest. We all know they are there (and everywhere else).
---
May 2nd!
---
INIT and IM are basically one in the same. IA is our rental alliance.  
---
Snuff is missing from the imperium list though   (ﾉಥ益ಥ）ﾉ﻿ ┻━┻
---
I dunno about passing information to the csm. Might not end the way you expect.
---
But what about Ginger's??  It's not racist since Ginger's don't have should right??
---
They can rat and mine in null just fine.
---
This is the way I did it back in 2016 no regrets!
---
&gt;artifical intelligence
---
It has fuck all to do with artificial intelligence, you script the bot to react to series of events. For instance, the bot will be scripted to do certain things under specific conditions.
---
Depending on the complexity of the bot it could go something like this :
---
Players selects warp to and activates the bot. 
---
Ship drops out of warp. Are NPC's present ? Yes/No
---
Yes - bot triggers keep at range on closest NPC, launches drones. targets all NPC's within a certain range and set's the drones to attack each in turn dependant on their range, starting with the closest and working backwards. 
---
In the event of a drone taking dmg, the bot triggers return to drone bay for the drone but because the drone is set to have a certain number of drones in space it launches another to offset the one that has returned. 
---
New entry in local : yes - return drones, warp to pre defined safe spot, disconnect.
---
Dread spawns - recall drones, warp to safe or to next ratting location. repeat. 
---
Obviously this is incredibly simplified but there tools and applications that help to create the sort of complex decision trees needed to make a bot as complex as you want it to be. Hell, you can do this sort of decision tree automation on your android phone for all sorts of complex interactions dependant on specific circumstances.
---
&gt; I could log in my Goon alt to look for some bots to post em here on Reddit but i don't care enough to do so, to be honest.
---
Bullshit, I'm calling your bluff.  Go do it.
---
Ahh, subtle way of CCP saying that there is not enough bots and SP farms.
---
I have no interest in structure bashing with week long timers. I have a job
---
Call it whatever you want, i got better things to do.
---
When was the last time you undocked in EVE?
---
One of those people? As in, willing to work out a grey area, but you have come to a conclusion given what your provided. You mean one of those people?
---
Dunno, if PH or anyone is so strong against botting. I would assume those set out to enforce it are equally as passionate. You mean one of those people?
---
No it really doesn't, he was definitely not talking about alpha injectors
---
yesterday.
---
I can see that you do based on your arguing about bots in a video game on reddit.  run along, dont want to keep you
---
You can fly the classic ratting vni with an alpha account
---
&gt; Should I start botting just to keep up with the meta? 
---
If you're serious about EVE, yes. Or you can consider winning it.
---
Yea which is weird cause I know both these guys mics are pretty high grade
---
Then grab a droneboat, go to a nullsec anomaly and then we can talk more
---
Believe it or not but i am actually at work atm so i do have better things to do (but i am not doing em as you can see).
---
lol you too huh? nice
---
I dont think that alliance leadership accept it except in kwg, rus and frt. You looose a lot of money as alliance leadership when ccp take back the isk from botters.
---
&gt;then we can talk more
---
Nah I'm good, I've already wasted enough of my time trying to explain one way in which bots are scripted to you. If you choose to disregard that information then I've better things to do.
---
I'm not disregarding your information, it is something I already knew
---
Lol moron
---
Love this. 
---
Another method if you’re interested in when they unanchor, put something low cost in there. A single unit of ammo for example.
---
When it unanchors you get an in-game notification.
---
How do you fit your caracal? I m flying caracal for years , 50m fit in total, i get fucked against stabber, vexor, brutix, cyna and so on, so i m interested to know the fit that can kill an ishtar.... i have perfect missile skill , perfect shield skill and cal cr to V of course. The reload is really, really too long in rlm...
---
Space UPS don't judge, brah.
---
And, NC and horde have definitely not shown up for exactly the same fights goons have or anything. Much less some PL guys being part of frt in all but name. It's a batphone war on any large timers.
---
Because you are PH and can't have those filthy line members snitching, amiright? Also... grrr goons.
---
Even though we have been working with Tri on some ops lately  they still have red standings (to horde at least).
---
Not true. Seems when they banned Brisc a couple weeks ago they discussed it with the entire world.
---
I can't recall the last time CCP has done a sub sale, it must've been a few years ago now. Before they got acquired they were doing a lot of galaxy pack sales to boost their sales figures but now that PA has bought them it seems like they aren't doing it as much.
---
Wrong answer. Correct answer is: *most of the time,* honor ransoms.
---
Is it possible to cargo scan the arrays (hangars etc...) inside tower's force fields ?
---
I see, wasn’t there one about a month ago or was that plex? I remember 15% off on something, few days after getting omega of-course lol.
---
But generally isn’t it cheaper if you plex your account while there’s a sale or is it not that much of a difference?
---
Top post here def have some good pointers, i would also suggest watching videos with FC comms to get ideas of how to call.   
---
[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8gNdXeYR-g) video is very long but it has full FC voice in 1:1 speed (most videos are 2x speed or more), Fever is prolly not the best FC EVE has ever seen but hes doing a solid job these days and i still remember when he was a newbro spodbrain like 2 years ago. Take inspiration from what other FCs, you may pick up small tricks and things to do.
---
Multiboxing rorquals, sure, peace of cake. Multiboxing super ratting, hats off to you.
---
Then I fail to see what your point is. You know how bot scripting works (at least one example of it) and yet have chosen to explain away potential, if not likely botting away with a series of fantastical  events.
---
Eve is a game where you will have to figure out a lot of things, even if you have people helping and teaching you. It's also a sandbox, meaning that you can do a lot of different things but at the start you won't be able to do them all at one and will have to choose. It also mean the game doesn't provide you straight up with a stair case of content you will progress through, content is for you and your friends to make, the game only give you options and possibilities.
---
If you went to spend time in the game you can. You can also take it slow, although not the best thing to do at the start when figuring out the game. You can grind isk for the sake of it and get really bored really fast. You can spend hours scouting and watching to set up a trap and never have it being triggered, or get into the craziest fight in a matter of seconds. You can build a solid industrial empire with time and dedication or just get really lucky with minimal effort.
---
Eve can be a lot of different things, you will have to play it to see if you enjoy it or not. Just, don't play it alone.
---
It’s free to play. Literally just download and start the tutorial missions
---
Honesty I'm willing to tolerate the un-eveness of this since hunting is so ungodly defender-favored
---
It is  really nice to see people keed memory of a fallen friend alive.
---
Fly safe kind pilots.

stop posting :)

Thanks for this, I’ll take a look.

wow dude opsec stop leaqing

Not saying you are correct, but maybe... https://imgur.com/a/w6EDjEA

Well, the CSM has always been an exception to the rule. Do note that they didn't publish the names of the other two players.
---
idk i think this is my favorite picture [https://gyazo.com/6e9aa56c32fa9bcf374bb77ba16a41a7](https://gyazo.com/6e9aa56c32fa9bcf374bb77ba16a41a7)
---
Nah. We have a very hard no bot policy. Landscapers not answering may happen, they got shit to do IRL and in-game. Players just putting it off as something that happens is kind of expected. It's not their job, and even with Hordes extremely strict recruitment process, some just pass through somehow lol. And you don't have to be afraid, we encourage reporting bots. Please keep doing so in the future.
---
You can delete the presets and use them for whatever you want. Not sure about moving through overview, but the is select previous and select next locked target.   I set those to mouse 4 and 5
---
I'm gonna argue that it hurts their margins (RMT) even if they're alpha.  If players get more ISK for their money through PLEX, RMTers have to lower their prices to stay ahead.
---
Just make deals with people who build them and take 30% of the profits from whelps ez
---
It could just be a lot less multiboxing is happening now given the spike in plex prices. I’m not sure if that completely explains the low numbers, but it definitely plays a part
---
Well you know what they say about French tanks...
---
So you being dunked by the people you batphon every timer counts as an excuse to not be called allies but us hunting in delve doesn't count as not being Imperium members, gottcha.
---
You think you get on all of Brave's kills or something?
---
As sad as it is, you are absolutely right, but you will suffer for it. Whistleblowers aren't protected in real life, and there is very little to no incentive to protect them in EVE either (if you're not a big name person like Brisc).  
---
For what it is worth, you have my genuine respect for doing the right thing and blowing that whistle, even when it most likely means trouble for you and little to no change to the better. The directors may just shrug it off with continued "this is status quo in EVE, just accept it" - and to be honest, they're not completely wrong either. 
---
I myself am under a coalition that has a clear botting issue, and I don't know what to do tbh. I love my alliance and know that they don't do it, but the larger entity is definitely guilty.
---
Is this man the man in ant-man 2?
---
Are there any places in Lowsec where I can buy ships to whelp in faction warfare?
---
Exactly the paranoia i was talking bout. Would rather have me admit to breaking a tos agreement than just say the truth that my friend gave me the isk. Good ridance. And no my friend told me not to be with him/her cause he/she said lowsec isnt for me for now. So rip your dreams.
---
Obviously. You can't be racist if it's not a person.
---
Can I just ask wtf is a landscaper?
---
Cause i wouldnt enjoy how harsh his space is and how unestbalished the markets there are. So it wouldnt be a good starting point for me considering i just got back to the game and relearning everything.
---
That phone number seems to connect me to a Beta Male Phone Sex Hotline. Odd.
---
Some  corrections:
---
1. PH leadership are good dudes, they'll torch bots. Have no fear, just go to diplos next time.
---
2. Ship names can be Chinese but char names cannot. Most young Chinese are also conversationally fluent in English. Language mismatch or Russian/Chinese shipname doesn't indicate a bot, though some players will be racist about it.
---
3. Chars all named the same don't indicate bots either. A lot of people have many alts they create in batches: skill farms, cynos, indy toons, etc. and sometimes you can't be bothered to be creative. It's true that batches of bots may be named similarly too but there are too many legitimate reasons.
---
4. There are bots everywhere honestly, and PH has zero recruitment filters so many do get in, no fault to PH.
---
The 23/7 behavior is very suspicious of course and if they are bots they will likely have some set and abusable behavior pattern that can be taken advantage of.
---
Why not talk to Chuggi about helping maintain the coalitionsin.space list?
---
People who think they are more important than other people. I get a lot of people who think they should be next in line over the other applicants because reasons.
---
Also people who fail to follow simple instructions. If you can't apply properly you're likely going to be a headache for me down the road for a number of things.
---
I guess my point would be that if there were more destroyers/frigates with drone target priority in anomalies, it would make solo-VNI ratting a thing of the past and solve this problem
---
Wait... That's illegal...
---
As far as I got to know, they are organizers. (Take care of people and stations and stuff like that)
---
I see them daily, you need to look in the Tenerifis and Omist regions; which they are successfully defending against the, ‘all of eve’ and ‘a Corp from Skillu’ backed, RMT dirty money unnatural Titans alliances of Winter Co.
---
"All i did was rat literally 23/7 for five whole weeks.  How could they have discovered me?"
---
I would answer you on the negative but that would be irrational.
---
TIL you can do that.
---
Each region usually has a trade hub. Not jita stocked, but with common ships and supplies used in the area
---
Cannot target anything inside a pos forcefield

I do, he sometimes is very reluctan to change things or outright ignores them. I don't know why though, he always seems busy and forgetting things easily, but only a guess.

Is it that hard to understand that eagles are shit at fleet fight ?????? test should really change their mentality by fitting.

He is The Mittani, he doesn't need context.
---
Can ctrl F the channel log files.
---
My poor loki is on top.
---
...there are so many ways that's false. Or I guess we call that Reddit True? You do realize PH openly kicked every gay member/supportive corp in 2015 right?
---
I didn't even know that's why they all got kicked back then, only found out this year from Securitas, one of the biggest bros in any alliance we've had him in.
---
Hey sec, if you're reading this, DREDDIT IS RECRUITING.
---
On second thought please stop talking
---
I tried deleting those unsuccessfully - how do you do it and how do you select the order in which your presets show up on the d-scan dropdown?
---
Valued allies
---
Well... as someone who actualy gets to shoot those eagles... Yes, indeed. Some of code's catalyst might even live longer.
---
brb, filling some applications.
---
You didn't give the PH leadership much time, you also took the words of a line member/scrub and assumed every player in your alliance thinks the same as one dude.
---
If you get kicked, its likely due to you going to reddit and attempting to tar an entire alliance instead of giving PH a chance to sort it themselves.
---
Beats working

The man likes a well fit offbrand triage, what's not to like?

But that’s exactly how it is now, isn’t it? Anyone with two neurons to rub together can already see your fit, courtesy of Zkill.
---
The ability to draw on third-party solutions to gain an upper hand seems like a perverse benchmark of player ‘level’ to me.
---
But yeah, I can accept that there is a high risk of it not being well implemented.
---
Lol that typhoon fleet was a test not TEST fleet. Don't forget about your multiple multiple previous feeds.
---
I've never seen Horde take a pro-bot stance. Whatever other bad things happen in Horde, this is true.
---
Test has bots too, we awox and kick the fuck out of them.
---
Downvotes only support this claim.
---
It's the only way to be sure. What if OP was just trying to put them off his trail?
---
Importing, exploration, and PI.
---
I dont think SP farms have been profitable for a while now.  Not unless people were sitting on a cheap pile of extractors already.
---
A sad truth.
---
I've tried to get a solo kill with the griffin. It's not going very well. I switch and went to another ship, I will get back to the really shitty ones later on.
---
No, you have to suffer like the rest of us.
---
How do you find them? Is it typically the high traffic area of the region?
---
"Shattered Armor" more like "I Shat In My Armor"
---
Next patch: alphas are no longer allowed to leave highsec
---
&gt;You do realize PH openly kicked every gay member/supportive corp in 2015 right?
---
That is completely false. When people are kicked, it's definitely not for their sexual orientation - and nor has it ever been.

Another dumb as fuck goon...

Did you not read the OP you fucking tard?

 I made 2 Bil in 2 hours on Friday. Haven’t logged back in since.
---
Lol, at least check Dotlan before making up a story. Only 2 corps left horde in 2015 and 1 of em is a holding corp.
---
People that use injectors are inferior Eve players, we shouldn't share the same server
---
Question is : how long did it take to run all these ?
---
Yo PM a dir, i used to be in horde and i'd say they will deal with the issue.
---
0rigin. is recruiting... we dont bot.
---
What the fuck is a landscraper?
---
CCP needs to implement an automatic flagging system for behavior that bots display. The metrics would be kept secret and change occasionally so people have a hard time working around them. 
---
Do a short human investigation on X number of worse offenders, ban.
---
They could outsource this to Asia so the labor rate would be low.
---
I'm not always the most talkative and social in Discord and am focused on my hunting. I like to listen and hear what's going on and chime in on occasion. Thanks don't have the patience nor desire to be a spy.
---
And yet, after all that They did not look closely enough t all these logs, and were ultimately wrong.
---
finishing this is below 2 hours, one site is like 8 minutes, rest is wasping around.  
---
Point 1 and point 2 is 20min each in VNI. And usual setup is 2-3 VNi are shooting fhubs and one vni is flying around and shooting escalations point 1 and point 2 (it is pretty same ISKs like in fhubs)
---
It's funny because FRAT funded these losses by paying the TESTgeld when we came knocking last time...
---
But people forget that part.
---
Pushx will recruit BR pilots. DSTs were recently removed.
---
If you want to join or are interested send me a message.
---
Well... actually we're lucky we've been that patient, and brought the fight to their front door. We've been around for about 45-60 minutes, reinforcing 1TCU and 1IHUB, then we traveled to Y-C to shoot the ansiblex, and it still took them till mid armor-timer, to arrive on the field.   
---
Rumors say, they've been pinging the whole time.  
---
When they finally arrived on the grid, we got some nice kills, TEST warped off to their Astrahus, we killed the remaining ships on grid, finished the armor-timer, and tidied up the grid, then went back home.  
---
Thanks for the fight, thought I'd have to travel home without one.
---
Test uses Slack? Interesting considering it doesn't have end-to-end encryption.
---
I do enjoy that fit. I need to bring it out more often. I've never been sold on the rocket launcher over the defensive neut, but maybe it's the right call.
---
Been messing with dual prop AC tails lately, but haven't been able to get a fucking km in either direction yet.
---
No he doesn't. He's in PH. so at best he's cutely retarded. At worst he's ugly retarded and snorted the hard kool aid
---
Show me on the doll where the truth touched you.
---
Dude are you retarded or something?
---
Two things:
---
1) you took all the right steps
---
2) just be a little more patient. CCP is slow (expect like 2 week ish response time on most things) and people, especially in management can be slow too. 
---
If nothing happens in another week then I think you’re right that it’s a conscious choice, but at this point I think it just needs a bit more time.
---
the downvotes. 
---
Ahhhh. It feels natural again. To be an Imperium pilot. The grrrgon has resurfaced and it is beautiful.
---
Shut up lol
---
You realise that plex prices dont matter to someone getting 60m/tic 23.75hrs a day right?
---
Show me what was not true in what i said and keep your doll for yourself pls,
---
Even if you’re just considering it’s probably best to just spool up about 6 accounts and subscribe them for the next few weeks to get some sweet login rewards.

Then after that you can decide it it’s for you

---
Jesus christ guys can we stop feeding eagles...

They invited people to come along and fight, you did nothing wrong :)
---
I filmed it, I'll have the video released tonight. I went to bed right after that fun fight.
---
I'm holding out for ORE titans that doomsday planets for PI
---
Had an amazingly fun and good fight with Brave Collective last night in IOO:
---
https://zkillboard.com/related/30002439/201904292200/
---
They stood ground and didn't try to run away. Ended up getting on 6 killmails before I got alpha'd by the second Raven who was in structure and launched a volley of missiles at me before going down. Was a lot of fun and I hope to fight Brave Collective again soon!
---
2 nights ago there was a content hole chain found to lead to enemy space, so we formed up and took my first trip through a wormhole. Went charging ~10 jumps through enemy space to get to our destination and blapped a Rorqual and a Phoenix that cyno'd in to defend + a few random sub-capitals.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/76447574/
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/76447538/
---
There was basically no defense and the Rorqual even used PANIC. Saw the Phoenix cyno in and thought "this was it, this is where we die" but there was no further defense coming in outside of a few sub-caps that got instantly deleted from the field.
---
Said our good fights in local and the Rorqual pilot responded with a "fuck you". After destroying the Rorqual and Phoenix we decided that was a good run and headed back to the wormhole chain and headed home with minimal losses of I think like 3-4 ships.
---
Also a day before we had a little scrap with some Fraternity VNI's in our space in 9P40 and we formed a small response group and went and deleted them from our space with (iirc) no losses. I typed "gf" and then "TAIWAN #1" and they all started spamming "YA" and I started laughing.
---
All in all it's been one hell of a past week for me PVP wise, both in fun and exhilaration. My heart started racing from all the adrenaline during both the fight with Brave Collective as well as charging through enemy space to get that Rorqual and Phoenix. I've literally never had an MMO ever make me feel so good before in that way that got my heart racing.
---
No.
---
I'm not sure here. It's more of a mass suicide contest in that TZ.
---
When they are flown like that against muninns they are \*shrugs\*
---
While feeding the pandas*  
---
Fixed it for you.
---
+ all you needs are 3x VNI - for usual ratting to get them and then for finishing it .-)
---
It's still not an excuse to keep welping eagles lol
---
Please, i sometimes want to use my ps4 controller when ratting.
---
Of course not. But you called me disingenuous or new. Of which I am neither. I'm not on every kill but I'm on enough to show a cross section demonstrating that, unless they're just constantly slinging caps when I'm not around, it's not nearly as common as you believe. In general, the folks I spend time with in standing comms are just there to have fun fighting and will happily oblige visitors. There is one player in particular that occasionally over escalates with his personal dread and we give him so much shit for chasing off our content. But again, that's the exception more than the rule.

Don't need isk when you get SRP

Long gone.

At least Horde actually acts when people go public. Goons still have the same botters people were talking about months ago.

Hey the reality is you should stop with eve finish your mission and come back wiser and more focused after your mission bud.
---
Is this a meme post?
---
What kind of data could you possibly collect that would allow you to reliably determine whether someone is a bot or not on a large scale?
---
Someone not complaining about RMT harbouring the most botters in the known universe? FC wat do?

You should encourage others and not cash their dreams. That short circuits potential.  Who knows they may understand you ja e failed or are unable to figure out. Be kind Rewind.

In a non shocker people aren't going to drop everything instantly because you reported a bot, they will get to it. Just because it doesn't happen in a time frame that's acceptable to you doesn't mean it's not going to happen, it just means you're impatient
---
Nestor is not for relic/data sites mate. It's used as chain logi in small gang WHC PvP. Use a covert ops ship for nul relic sites in c1-c3 (ones with a faction name) if you want to fight back take an astero. If there's anything bigger than a frigate in the site leave it. If you want to run WH relic sites a  brick tanked strat can co c1-c2 and a T3C can do C3.

Are there loot tables online for all the different flavor 9/10s?

You run these in 3x vni or one vni?

Could you know, just put a rotating dummy account in local in every system. Always there but is just a name on local, name is automatically rerolled every few days.

pls help me understand how a titan's targeted DD can one-shot a vendetta, even a zero-tank vendetta.
---
Thats probably from a lifetime of being abused by your el337 leadershop
---
ragnarok with dd V easily one shots zero tank vendetta. don't believe? sure u can bring ur zero tank vendetta against my rag
---
Interesting, I guess you could have a neutral ceptor alt just making laps in the suspected botting area, causing all the bots to constantly dock up over and over
---
It's not.
---
That could work.
---
It is and continues to be.
---
I dunno about that one but whoever suggested reviving the doctrine has a snowball's chance in hell of continuing to FC
---
A ragnarok with Doomsday Operation V does 1,500,000 explosive damage. A vendetta hull has 2,660,000 EHP versus an explosive damage attack.
---
Additionally, there's been zero kills on Tranquility where a Ragnarok, or any titan for that matter, has killed a Vendetta by itself.
---
This leads me to believe you just made something up, which is appalling. This is the internet, sir!
---
This is the #1 most misunderstood quote from mittens ever.  He said that it's not our responsibility to police bots.  He said that is CCP's job.  That is pretty fair.  In a game where teaching new players, authentication (ESI stuff), forums (because their forums suck), and legit every other organizational system is setup by players THE ONE THING that CCP has direct access to is the ability to see if someone is botting.  Let them handle it at a minimum.
---
1 and 3 are amazing though.
---
Just no.
---
Sansha 9/10 can be run with alone VNI, Angel needs more, because to break structure require 1500+dps
---
Bro, flickr, why.
---
The internet is for porn
---
I only know sansha and angel. Sansha 9/10 loot is really bad when it is compared with angel one

The new recruit a friend system is similar. You get 750k SP on the new account just for making it through RAF even if you never activate it, and then you can buy the $15 'Meteor' DLC pack to activate the new account. Between your two accounts, this nets you:
---
1 month of Omega on new account
---
30 day +3 attribute booster on new account
---
1 million free SP on new account
---
460 PLEX (350 on original account, 110 on new account)
---
Skill Extractor on original account (~500m ISK)
---
2x Master-at-Arms Cerebral Accelerator on original account (~150m ISK each)
---
IMO it's pretty good value for making a new alt
---
bos is the new dyson tbh
---
First: The Name Erika Coalition was floating around :)
---
I’m a SKIN trader, from what I’ve been able to draw probably one of the larger ones. On average I profit 2-8 B a week moving 80-100 skins of various values and rarities. When new skin sets come out (Callie Neon, Jubilee, Headhunter, etc) I usually buy 2-4 complete sets then sit on them for 6-12 months after they’re discontinued. Usually returns a 100-300% margin on the PLEX spent to buy the KINS, although the recent climb in PLEX prices did fuck me a bit the business is still very lucrative for the 5-10 major players that control it. 
---
BTW if ya need any rarities you’re having trouble with PM Whistle Past-The Graveyard in game and we’ll get you all set 👍🏽
---
Triangle is best race.
---
They wanted the citadels to actually be used.  Even most null-stations were rarely used besides isking setups.  Every alliance I was in back in the pre-citidel days had their primary staging either well behind the lines or in NPC null sec where you can't lose access to the items anyway.
---
I didn't know SJW's were smart enough to get passed EVE's learning curve. 
---
*They're evolving.*
---
I mean, if you have to shaft a group, I vote for the aussie, the smallest group. Simply, if you want 10000 people in one system to test the new sever, you should give 25000 of your players a chance to log in. And I've always seen less than 10% of the online population during the tests.
---
Are you a nature sports retail store ? Because I have never seen such a great bait !
---
What I used to do back in the day was using a very similiar fit (no rocket launcher, tracking or falloff rigs i don't remember), carry a depot, MSE, MWD and Autocannons as spare parts and then start feeling out the enemies at range. Bait a bit, showing off my AB, looking at their prop and guns, and deciding whether or not to go for it in the double web fit, or, if they were clearly MWD Kite and not a Slicer, warp off, memorize name of the player and the ship, refit to MWD brawl and "get found again" by them. SUddenly, scram brawl buffer tank firetail and not the easy ab double web kill they expect :)
---
Yupp
---
Hmmm, maybe i should not let all those 9/10s go to waste.... 
---
And you say i can do stage 1 and 2 in a lone VNI? I wonder if even Blood Raider ones.... Imma try, the worst thing that can happen, i lose a VNI. :D
---
Usually people are dying in cheap tech two stuff. So usually ever wreak i loot is around 10-20 mill in tech II modules and ammo then another 20ish in salvage. So damage controls are common, so are cloaks, torpedos, launchers, tech 2 launchers. The biggest issue is you have to rely on people being idiots and dying consistently, you also need to hope that the loot fairy say yes (loot fairy say no on deadspace modules :&lt;), and that people haven't already loot it. 
---
Also some people dying to NPCs show up so for that I just warp 100km, bookmark their wreak, re warp at 0 loot and run, that usually brings a decent amount too. 
---
The big bottle neck is people arn't dying enough. NC arn't killing enough Goons to make it a very viable way to get space rich and you end up twiddling thumbs most of the time. So I often do other activities then when Im done I check zkill to see something juicy. 
---
As for ships I use the Probe. With extended cargo holds it can hold a ton of stuff, its cheap to welp, quite unsuspecting, and make you look like a scrappy space trader in a sci fi novel. 
---
And thats how I elite PvP Salvage :p
---
on the contrary, they are very useful. Their purpose is to make us look better.
---
This is literally the oldest scam in EVE. It's an assembled Bhaalgorn named 'Armageddon Navy Issue'.

You missed the vendetta John bellicosing itself with SF assistance.

That’s the real story here.
---
If you're looking for a long term commitment, EVE is the game for you. I've been playing consistently for... 14 years now!? Shit!
---
Anyways, the best advice you will get is to find a group of players that you enjoy playing with. EVE is a social simulator that just happens to have spaceships. Go create a free alpha account, and just dive in head first.
---
There are several corporations/alliances (corporations are like guilds, alliances are groups made up of corporations) that specialize in helping out new players. Brave Newbies, Pandemic Horde and Karmafleet are the big three. I'm partial to recommending Karmafleet because that is my alliance's new player feeder corporation. You can a be a day 1 new player, and they will take you in, teach you how to play, how to make money, they will hand you free ships to PVP in, they have daily training classes, dedicated players who help newbees learn the ropes, and an entire library of instructional material. We also provide full reimbursement for ships lost in PVP, so basically once you buy a doctrine ship, if you lose it, you never have to pay for a new one out of your own pocket again. And I can almost guarantee that if you join a fleet on your first day or two and say hi on coms and let everyone know that its your first fleet, you will probably come home with a couple hundred million ISK (in game currency) in your wallet just from veteran players showering the cute newbee with cash. I've personally given day 1 players in my fleet a couple bil just for having the balls to dive in. 
---
Where ever you chose to go, just remember to fly dangerously.
---
My guess is it's more of a technical reason. Local is in the chat system which is now a whole other server node than the "space" server node that knows if you are cloaked or not. Just speculation.
---
I hope the Packs go on sale... I am in need of a third Omega account.
---
(It was a math joke)
---
Exactly right
---
what is the goon home system?
---
The only time I get annoyed about losing a ship is when it's due to my own stupidity
---
My favorite thing about the rocket launcher, despite the fact that it does not add all that much DPS, is that it is pretty common to have a volley land, they go into hull, and then a rocket lands before their rep does, effectively increasing the alpha and further chipping away at their hull buffer.
---
Don't get me wrong, I love a defensive neut too, but with 2x webs and the base speed it's pretty hard for stuff to get on top of you (I do use a defense neut with something like a scram kite FNC).
---
at least you could firesale it to them
---
Is there a proper module than the fitting scanner I can use too see precisely the fitting of a ship ? The fitting scanner gives random results no matter the distance I am from the target
---
too bad ! thanks for the reply
---
I think it is 1D-Q in Delve
---
I would like one change to it:
---
if you import a skill queue that has missing skill books, give an option right there to buy and inject all of the missing skill books (and say how much it will cost in total ofc) and finish importing the queue
---
wtf I love /r/eve now
---
I didn't know right of center was now in your definition of SJW. Botcheck?
---
No, I did not hear it from Sec.
---
&gt; They just invested a lot into bringing Serenity up to the current level - they won't let it down right away.
---
&gt; Also, they need to have a different server for the chinese market, so there will always be (a) Serenity
---
It is true that they invested in it, but it has become somewhat of an embarrassment at this point and is a negative, rather then positive asset. I think they would need to do another complete shut down and re-launch under a different name for it to have a chance.

Alpha/Omega is the biggest mistake CCP ever made. give botters free access to the game... brilliant idea.

Yeah come do the thing. Dank frags exist. Fly dangerous.

does this mean you're quitting?

please say yes, please say yes...
---
What the fuck

from what I recall CCP are friends with Jagex. and they do an excellent job of weeding out botters. They should ask for input from their friends.
---
Go ahead and check brave's zkill for a single capital ship (niddhoggur) and tell me again they have dropped caps a couple times since you started playing. https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99003214/kills/ship/24483/

RIP bomber

Also, you stupid plebs. Remember the FCs get *all the loot*.
---
gate camping is hard
---
Avree Lewis is attractive.
---
This is exactly the opposite of what happens, botters provide no income to CCP, they use PLEX which is already money that CCP cashed in to fund their omega accounts and are a small % of the overall population of the game. Botting used to be a problem in the past when high sec asteroids and ice fields were infinite, now it's just people complaining with no proof because they enjoy echo chambers or something.
---
If we don't do an intro post I get blown up with PM's every time he does something. It's also part of our bias rules / culture to openly state who they or at least who they are with from a game perspective. The community here tends to riot about anything remotely pertaining to mod bias - so this is part of the reason.
---
&gt; only found out this year from Securitas, one of the biggest bros in any alliance we've had him in.

&gt; No, I did not hear it from Sec.

Even for you that’s stupid.

---
Literally went on a fleet with him two nights ago.

“Long fucking gone” indeed.

And yet they acted exactly how any oversight group would.

Here's a very real world example of nearly the exact same thing happened.

Here I was having typed up a nice story for the EVE story time thread about my experiences for the past week only to have the thread deleted for this.

I got scammazed. :^)
---
But for the law-abiding citizens of New Eden its great that you don't have to invest a lot of real money into the game before you've even found a place for you in it.
---
Haha yeah I was thinking "that totally could be me" too.

I'm a primarily english player raised in a russian household, on public transport right now, and I can't stop giggling (in tears right now) at the warp to fleet member translation

[Finally](https://imgur.com/7yh6CZF)
---
Just to clarify - you're just running these with 3 normal 100mn ratting VNIs or do you have a specific fit?
---
It's usually between 15-20 depending on their fit, but if you're killing 4 or 5 an hour it's better isk and way more fun than vni ratting itself.
---
I have just realized that if rats give you a combat timer most of the issues with bots and afk ratters go away on their own...
---
Fun fact: I have been trying to get the automod scheduler to remove that thread for months. It's not the most.. polished tool and it's run by the automod 'team', not us. Knowing about those little reddit quirks and how to deal with them is *exactly* why I'm excited Avery finally said yes. There's no one stop shop for all the things you can do or have to manage with a sub so getting someone whose not just as experienced but actually more experienced with that sort of thing than I am is a *god send*.
---
I’m loving it to be honest it’s quite funny. How low can it go!
---
IDK if angel sites are the same but blood 9/10's (fleet staging points) are fairly ass. The loot is alright but three times as dangerous due to travel distance and not a proportional increase in loot to make that worth it.
---
Congrats Avery :)
---
So let's look at engagement range and the advantage on grid and there interaction. 
---
So in a fight that is winnable there is some theoretical range, so for brawlers this range is often close to 0 for kiters this range between 20 and max range for your doctrine. 
---
You use your other tools to get in this range and well win, the issue with brawl is when you have a number disadvantage your theoretical victory range is non-existent as your short range advantage is gone because the hostile fleet has more ehp and dps then you do ( by the nature of well how addition works ). 
---
This means there at optimal range you lose, this gives you well no way to setup an engagement that will lead to you winning. ( and fights are fun feeding ships into a brawl you can't possibly win isn't ).
---
This is before we account for stuff like cap pressure that encourage you to kite in general because brawling gives you very little options to GTFO when the cyno go's up.
---
Al off this pressures people into kiting doctrines ( with nano cruisers being the most extreme example ).
---
What a time to be alive. 
---
Good to have you Slicker than Average Lewis 😎

Good to have you Slicker than Average Lewis 😎😍
---
imagine this sub if he was announced on the day of brisc stuff haha
---
&gt;o basically in WH space everything drops when the citadel dies ? That's how I would have expected it to work everywhere , even POS wouldn't allow you to magically teleport stuff out of it when they were destroyed.  
---
&gt;Very strange design choice tbh.
---
I will likely get down voted for this, and honestly I am pretty agnostic about the citadel mechanic, but let me explain the game design choice. 
---
It turns out that people living in null-sec tend to live there a long time, and have all of their stuff and assets in these citadels. Many times these players take breaks for a year or more and come back. 
---
If that citadel gets blown up, or *moved on purpose,* either while they are still playing the game, *or* while they are on their eve vacation, without asset safety they literally lose all of their stuff. 
---
Now fair enough, a good argument can be made that this is what eve is all about; however (and this is an ***important*** however), people tend to forget CCP is a capitalist entity whose existence is not just predicated on making a profit off of its customers, but its very *reason d'etre* is making said profit. 
---
Where I am going with this is as follows: CCP has access to data that demonstrates pretty conclusively that the *very best way* to lose paying subscriptions is to have someone lose ***everything*** they own in one go. This causes people to quit and never come back, demonstrated by hard data. 
---
Similarly, when people come back to the game after a year break, they are ***very unlikely*** to re-sub ***ever again*** when they see that everything of value they owned in the game has disappeared. 
---
Therefore, CCP implemented the asset safety mechanic, which incidentally also acts as an isk sink, which is kind of helpful for other reasons, to ensure that they are not literally losing paying customers forever because of a sudden loss of all of that customer's virtual assets. 
---
Given that this is the ***literal*** reason that the asset safety mechanic exists in the game, the better question is "why doesn't this same mechanic apply to w-space?" This is because CCP is *just as likely* to lose those w-space dwelling players who lose all of their shit as they are null-sec players who lose all of their shit.
---
Made Man is an in-game VG role that most of us have.  That part makes sense, but I have a hard time buying any VG member actually saying that.
---
I honestly missed being downvoted. Everyone on reddit liked us for awhile. It was unnerving and made me uncomfortable.
---
Grrr jannies
---
When RMT gives you fewer billions per dollar than simply buying plex from CCP, the amount of bots would probably go down quite a bit.
---
That’s pretty nostalgic.
---
I usually super rat or rroq mine, but before you REE at me know that I don't use alts. If I move my super I do it unscouted with no cyno alts, and if I mine, I mine with only one ship. 
---
It never ceases to amaze me that no one has managed to kill me yet.
---

&gt; hell of a first day lmfao
---
I felt so bad that the day he was added to the team was that day haha
---
Can confirm, in all my 4+ years of subscription time I've managed to hit one subscription sale.
---
Or, more likely, it wouldnt affect anything as botters do it to primarily sub their own accounts, hence CCPs obvious lack of motivation to ban them.
---
Plex used to sub acc = CCP profit
---
Nice job boys!

Do they have ping reactions?

It makes it easy to manage a large gallery with albums you can customize, presents images and albums in a nice way visually and allows storing full size images without compressing them and degrading quality. That's why. ;)

2.5bill, 9 sites with 3 stages each, so we have 90 mill per stage, multiple accounts, flying around the whole region...imho thats really crappy isk/hour.
---
Shit, the RS3 team is prolific with dealing with bots. When RS3 released they removed tens of thousands of them at once and it took a year for a decent number to come back.
---
I’m surprised bots haven’t been such a problem until now, EvE appears to be an easy game to bot imo.
---
Useless middle management
---
Lucky, you already know what you need/want.  I'm sitting on like 2M bonus XP and most of my Q is filled with level 5 spaceship command skills and large precusor weps.  I may just dump on Maurader 5 and go out like a champ in a blaze of glory, or get dumpstered. Either way, that may be the plan. But there's so many more tempting options.

The problem is when meme becomes reality...

Obligatory response highlighting the inherent silliness in asking a game's subreddit if said game should be invested in.

Who the fuck is legacy?
---
Rough.
---
At any point when you're in a region, open the market UI and search for something common (Void S, Hobgoblin II's, etc).  Generally speaking, whichever location shows up most frequently in these lists is going to be that regions' market hub.  Keep in mind that this changes from region to region, so you'll need to check multiple times.
---
As an example, I live and operate in the Caldari/Gallente warzone, which consists of the Placid and Black Rise regions.  So I would check the market lists once in a system in Placid, and once again in Black Rise, in order to get a good feel for where the hubs are in the area.
---
OK dude, you win. Stay in your space and do you. Us big scary nublets will stay over here.
---
I like the idea of rat afk checks once a month on unpowered structures dont think there is any need for a structure to create that. Rats could be just enough to ref the structure in an hour and return for the follow up times if the structure actually refs.
---
Also wormholers had already accepted the risks of losing everything if their pos was destroyed, etc. So making no change to citadels was no change for their risk (other than now it is easier to accumulate a lot of stuff)
---
I appreciate it, let's me hop on occasionally for a few hours without wasting money because I don't play Eve too much
---
you are usual null sec afk farming, so each your VNI get 30-60m per hour + loot, when you get some escalations you bring VNI to go for stage 1 and stage 2, so you get around 30m per hour. then you take all your accounts and with jump brisges it is not so much travelling. 9 sites even when 3hours it is still 300m per hour (400m if you do it below 2hours).   
---
Do you know any other method, where you can do 300m with just T2 fit VNI's?
---
It helps that they hired a big bot client developer.
---
Mind you he's since left; but the Old school servers are pretty plagued.
---
I got it. The “trying” was because that would be a square root.
---
What are you even trying to say here dude? It's fine to drop caps and it's fine to blob. I don't care. The only problem I have is when folks pretend like it doesn't happen.
---
That's pretty freaking cool man! Good on you for profiting from the mistakes of others, that's what EVE's all about!
---
wtf.. u serious this dude is definition of cancer
---
At no point have I said that it doesn't happen. I've openly stated that it does. But it doesn't happen nearly as often as you think it does. Redline literally flew a Nag into GE the other day asked us to fight it in sub-caps on his stream and we did.
---
at least it's not evary vestewis
---
yes, for Angel you need usual armor tank pve fit. for Sansha you need change your slightly to have 2x EM hardener, because sansha station have huge EM voley, when you survive first voley with overheated EM hardener, you just shoot down station from range.
---
Whether intentional or not, they all do that. The pros cycle it several times in a row. Know that’s not what you want to hear, though.
---
Making assumptions about the whole alliance, based on some knobheads trolling you, is foolish.
---
Proper thing to do is report the bots and wait for CCP to check. Might take a few mobths but eventually they will ban them. I've reported lots of exploration bots I used to notice and some of them are no longer around.
---
This doesn't mean new ones are not created, of course.
---
I *really* do not understand when I hear people say EVE is beautiful.
---
The models for the vast majority of ships look like downright ugly and the in-game rendering of them is poor at best.  *Most* Gallente ships  for example, just ewww.
---
Space itself in EVE looks like you are flying around an OSX wallpaper, with little sense of depth or movement.
---
Weapon visual and lighting effects and are so underwhelming that they might as well not be there, unless you play zoomed right into your ship.
---
The HUD is dated and a poor UX.
---
The UI within the game is not too bad - star maps and such like are quite nicely realised, even though the usability is not the best.
---
BUT I GUESS BEAUTY IS IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER.
---
I think that purity dude is flair bait.  Over the top parody accounts are becoming *a thing* on many sport subreddits.
---
wow more goon bias
---
And yet you're here complaining that horde leadership (or rather middle management) hasn't done CCPs job quickly enough.
---
Bots keep live numbers high and plex price high. Both of which are helping ccp bottomline directly.
---
No but you said it happened a couple of times since you are with them, which is objectively bullshit.
---
You won't catch me, copper!!
---
Lol you're clearly a lot more invested in this argument than I am. Have a good day bud.
---
That is fantastic!
---
lol who’s actually going to take the csm seriously anymore 
---

&gt; While we're discussing this in detail, how does a script know how to diferentiate between which series of events to react to and which to ignore? Magic? Image recognition software? If a bug happens you'll end up with a capsule trying to pretend its a VNI, which defeats the purpose of botting with a VNI in the first place
---
Ok, now you're being deliberately obtuse, and the ninja editing is bad form by the way.
---
We weren't really discussing it in detail, hence the 'obviously simplified' in my previous comment but to broadly answer you question. This sort of decision tree automation works on a set of assumptions relating to the environment it is intended to work in. Specifically in this example, the bot is scripted under the assumption that there will either be NPC's present in a set location or not, and then act accordingly. 
---
Sure, bugs will always be an issue, a incorrectly configured tree could leave the bot in a loop over and over, in which case the VNI will likely die, but because there's a logical progression it's not too difficult to track down the the branch that caused the bug and correct it. 
---
So no, not magic, logical assumptions. It's really not that difficult, you can make the decision tree as complex as you want provided it's in sequence and configured correctly. 
---
I do find it odd that, considering you already know how bot scripting works, that you are so unable to wrap your head around it.
---
Haha okay dude
---
Pretty sure time/isk is low. How many did you run to get that loot?
---
High plex prices doesn't guarantee rich people spending money on this game in the future, can I have some of what you are smoking?
---
In regards to the 1m free sp, is that on top of the 750k you get for the referal? Thanks for the info regardless has definitely changed how I approach this
---
That’s actually true
---
Lol good luck
---
and those fuckers neut
---
I hear there's an opening
---
It's 750k and then 250k after you activate Omega
---
The API rage is super annoying. My goto response these days is "alright well we don't need you, fly safe". I'm done having that discussion.
---
Next time just send corp mails instead
---
why do you have the most beta discord picture i have ever seen
---
It's probably that "expectation vs reality" problem most of life (including games) faces. People come thinking they can fly fancy space ships and or role-play their favorite sci-fi adventure like a D and D game in space. that bubble bursts quickly and leaves a poor impression in its' wake. If there was more engaging PvE content and a more fluid transition from solo to group that would help new players a lot. Instead it leaves people feeling isolated, rejected and bored with no achievable goals in an immediate future.
---
It's very strange as we don't hear it like that.. tha k you for letting us know

and he got a warning.

Fill me in please, wtf is Thera?

Unfortunatly no but thanks for the reply :)
---
Could be true too. Alot of people and alliance leaders never had any power in real life so they fear they will lose it ingame when they take fights and lose.
---
Time to see if we can go 12 / 12 0.0 candidates this year. Much representation, much balance, ~~~much leaks~~~

You are just now realizing this?
---
After the Brisc fiasco, why would anyone bother?
---
dear diary
---
today I oriented the fuck out of my flow
---
considering the workload during those visits I wouldn't exactly classify it as free. I consider CSM a job you have to pay for. All the obligations with little to no perks.
---
That will almost never happen, though.
---
Wow. Nice to see a finally pieced together frame of it, Looks like maybe whatever it is, Will be a soon^tm
---
Nice, so that's what it looks like. Also, capital or possibly FOB/Small structure to establish beachheads or w/e?
---
It’s definitely possible, but you’ll have to write a custom bot or some such. Character location is a quick ESI call away.
---
He thinks he's super clever with that phrase too lol

Cant wait for the ironic nazi mod posts.

They are directors of bless beans and also "Landscapers" of PH Corp. They deal with the " he said she said" daily drama of a large eve alliance.

---
Lol making fun of people for being dumb and using the wrong homophone of “past”
---
When we’re talking about frigates and destroyers, we’re talking about so little DPS that we really need to start by finding out how the VNIs are fitted. What is their resist hole? If SP is not a problem, the ship can be chosen from there.
---
Don’t have a specific region in mind? Then consider a ship with bonuses for missiles or projectile turrets.
---
&lt;3 Frosty bois. That last match was fun. Who needs 4 months of practice to figure out the meta when we’ve proved it can mostly be done  in two weeks :)
---
What once was old is new again.
---
How would you train that hypothetical neural network? 
---
Is there a large list of confirmed bots lying around that I'm not aware of?
---
10/10s are generally easier per bpc then grinding for lp. I know with Sansha 10/10s you get about 1 nm bpc per 3 sites and at 100m per site it's basically just an added benefit.
---
When I still played I used Magnates.
---
Both in Horde/Delve
---
4nano/istabs/4wcs/2wcs2expander/etc.

Its fucking perfect.
---
So many dreads looted in magnates lol.
---
just don’t show up
---
Got a Mail from Veles Clade, saw this. Now I'm excited.
---
Yeah man, everyone is dealing with the bot menace.  They're not even fun to try and attack.  The SECOND you pop in local, it seems, they're already warping to something safe.
---
I've been in test for three days, this was the first thing I heard. Don't fly shiny shit during Strat ops. It makes sense to me and these people should of been part of the op imo.
---
Fair enough but for us common folk would it be too hard to use Imgur?
---
FOR THE MOTHERLAND
---
People that keep things clean and organized. For PH there are people that are good at organizing efforts.
---
OP, sounds like you spent a very short time trying to figure out what to do, didn't get the answer you were hoping for, then came here to blast PH for it. It's your responsibility to reach out to people, not the other way around. If you didn't get a reply, you should have hit up another NBI or any of the online FCs -- someone would have pointed you to the right people.
---
Then again, the standing fleet would gladly wipe out bots if they're in our space. We're not traveling the galaxy to kill bots, but if they're in Horde-controlled space it would be fun to get a fleet together to keep them in check.
---
&gt; "Eve has Bots, just accept it."
---
This is an odious, defeatist attitude that must never be allowed to prevail. Do not listen to the cynics who tell you CCP doesn't care about bots.You did the right thing by flagging them for CCP and reporting them your alliance.
---
I like this.
---
Btw I would not never ever pay a ransom anywhere in New Eden except abysmal PVP. It's the only situation where there's nothing to gain from not honoring the ransom.
---
Everywhere else, shit's already gone down the drain the moment convo pops up, so why throw extra money at the baddy who's just gonna pop you anyway for the lols and the loot.
---
Props man, keep it up.
---
I have had a few characters in PH, (and may well still have at least 3,) and I have personally seen those higher up, (not necessarily the absolute leaders,) at the VERY least, insist on ignoring botters. Then again, that is what I seem to hear from the largest of the alliances/coalitions is somewhere between, from the worst to the best, "Don't report alliance botters," to "ignore them" to "report then to CCP, and then let us know who exactly they are so we can kick them."
---
Sadly, Botting is very prevalent, but one should never NOT report a bot. At the very least, it's a way to let CCP know roughly how many botters there are, and at best, it removes them from the game, and locks out all of that accounts resources permanently.
---
But to reference to "has eve really..." the answer is a sad yes, especially when there is a LARGE infusion of players from another server where the rules were slightly different.
---
But thats just me, and I may be wrong, but then again, I could be right.
---
Playing for 8 years in hs means they probably ARE retarded.

I was planning to run as a wormhole representative. Not anymore though. The CSM is already basically a part-time job you do for free, and on top of that you have to worry about being falsely banned with zero communication? Pass.
---
https://i.imgur.com/ZQZUeCN.gifv
---
My intended point here was only that they took a good faith complaint by a CSM member, and by their own admittance, practically skimmed the available data and came to the wrong conclusion.   Now, I don't know what they looked at the first time around.  But it SEEMS like they said "oh, he knew about cap changes, his buddy is selling a cap, must be insider trading.". This is obviously grossly oversimplified.
---
Praise pop
---
Sheesh, the guy took a break from wormholes for a while, that doesn't make him retarded. He buys any ore I'll sell him with a 2% reprocessing tax, buys all my salvage and relic findings at 100% market cost or whatever I pitch him (within reason), and I have no idea what orca boosts are haha.

Sounds like you are used to the Horde mentality that just is not there in other Corps. The most paranoid we get is trying to keep blue intel off comms, which normally means people call them "oversized VNIs" insteed. 
---
Other corps dont want spies and will try and keep them out, its not paranoia when its just how eve is played by 90% of people.
---
So nobody I should care about as a wormholer, got it.

I approve this freak out and would have been thankful for it. I'm sure you know that sometimes it takes a leader losing his shit to get people to SHUT THE FUCK UP in com's or in fleet chat.

Isn't that the guy that got caught jerking off the baby in the Vegas steakhouse?

I mean CCP doesn't give a fuck about anything but 0.0 anyways, so... why have a representative for highsec or lowsec? What are they going to do other than waste everyone's time?
---
holy crap, that music is dark and sexy. thanks for sending.
---
dude.. What the fuck... I have seen you post this in a bunch of posts today... What gives?
---
No longer than 14 hours 30 minutes
---
When was the last time you roamed in lowsec? Worms and Garmurs were super popular during OGB years, now the meta is scram kiting shit. You might get some kitey slicers every so often but its not the norm.
---
Assault frigates and the Kikimora dominate small complexes, usually in brawling or scram kiting range.
---
Mediums and Larges are usually small gangs of F1 shit going at it, or somebody baiting in a combat battlecruiser or battleship in the large.
---
Venture bots still exist though :(
---
&gt; What's the point of asset safety ?
---
Ruining the game
---
Thera is a special place. It is a wormhole where you can go to. It is VAST and it has stations.
---
It is the home of Signal Cartel [a very solid group].
---
Thera lives on the nebulous border between Empire and the insanity-filled dumpster fire of K-space.
---
And that should clear any doubt as to what the object was. It is a ship after all, not a station like many others kept on insisting despite the evidence.
---
Sheesh the guy with 2 months experience knows it all right?
---
I've been playing 8 years... seen it all... all except one thing... until now!!!
---
The guy who gives up w space to start new bro friendly mining corps!!
---
Do you realize how boring high sec mining is for any player who has moved beyond that?
---
In fact high sec mining is the #1 killer of any growth in the player base.
---
8 year players do not start high sec mining corps unless they are Awful or scamming new bros.
---
. it's a way to capitalize off new players let me explain. You sit there and mine for them..they churn through new players left and right and dont really care because they just replace them with other new bros. You see it is a reasonable way to avoid tax... or you could just start your own Corp and avoid tax.
---
You will enjoy this Corp.. for 2-3 weeks and then one day you will no longer want to play eve.
---
When I was in your position 8 years ago I was about to quit the game until I randomly got killed by someone and joined their null sec corp.
---
This lead to me eventually joining w space... fighting in 100+ billion isk battles and earning 10s of billions of isk without trying too hard.
---
I've even made good rl friends....ran fleets... you name it.
---
I pity every high sec miner I see because frankly they are missing the entire game.
---
Is the size calculated correctly yet?
---
That would help with the designation of the "thing".

"You may fire when ready."

TIL.

*FYI those components can only be mined in caldari/gurista space (not local to TAPI home regions)
---
Y U so crazy!!! lol
---
shit
---
honestly not up to date with the current plex/extractor/injector prices but i think it's around -2b for 30days plex and +1.8b for selling the sp or around there, not important exactly where but let's just use those numbers for this example 
---
so you bought your plex at 1.4b a X time ago, in your mind you go hey this is 400m profit since i got it at 1.4b but in reality you are losing 200m by not selling the plex straight off and in fact you are doing more work for less isk
---
This is the same stuff as the "the minerals i mine are free", in their mind they see it as a profit while they are losing isk
---
The text included in the video states that it's a "World Ark" under the *Xordazh* classification.

---
I’m fairly certain there were a few changes implemented that helped highsec and addressed highsec like “war” exploits for one. Perhaps FW is up next? Who knows!
---
That's too much work. Just awox them.
---
Back when null didnt care about the CSM there were a ton of hisec members, and they listened to them, so i would imagine theyd still care
---
I think that depends. I was gonna come back to game and my friends had joined a large alliance. the amount of leg work just to apply was insane... register here... register there.
---
. Oh you are having that problem??? Yeah mail this guy... then I mail that guy..."actually that's my supervisor the head of alliance ot infrastructure who will have to help you"... etc etc.
---
I actually said fuck it and stayed afk another 4 months before deciding to become a solo explore and shit up chat channels with my friends

---
I'm glad you guys keep hammering me with downvotes instead of reading the rest of this thread where i changed my attitude towards this event completely.
---
Just abolish it already.  
---
CCP and the incumbent CSMs have already lost the trust and confidence after #Briscgate, on top of cancelling two player PVP tournaments, comisaring the community team and watching Guard sail off into the sunset.
---
Start over with something new. Because what CCP is doing now with the CSM just hasn't been working.
---
I speak only from a year or two ago and I did it mostly with MCTs. At the time they were several hundred cheaper then plexing, and that’s where most of the profit came from. 
---
Stockpiling plex and using it for this instead of selling it is dumb I agree
---
That's very good that you got some advice, whilst being shot. The one advice they forgot to give you is 'do not start your main account as indy' and bother with corps whose main activities are mining.
---
You will get to see so much more entertaining stuff, if you jeep playing. Trust me. ;)
---
You will probably have even higher efficiency setting up a bridging Titan and a few cyno alts

This is so fun to watch, you're actually hilarious.
---
Any big organization has people that bend/break the rules, in any role. 
---
The fact that you stepped up and are reporting them refelects very well on you. That's really the best you can do. Sure you can message goons that there is an easy km, but that does not fix the problem. They need to be banned and only ccp can do that. I think you've done the right thing, whether or not you used your alliance options is irrelevant. Keep doing the right thing for the game in general.

As I said, I’ll be rooting for ya’ll! Best of luck in the next stage.

That's totally a fortizar

Just got back to eve, what'd Vily do?
---
I'm running because I refuse to let one incident stop me from trying to improve the game I enjoy. People make mistakes and I'm willing to bet those mistakes are being answered for. It's not fair to the devs who haven't done anything wrong, to hold this over them.
---
That thing is bigger then titans..
---
Shit, I didn't know that the CSM had the authority to fire employees.
---
Basically. I stopped doing this kind of shit for game dev companies. If they want experts, they need to pay for them.
---
Which makes it a ship, not a station. Titans, especially Iapetan titans, are basically massive ships that share many of the same functions that stations do.
---
https://i.imgflip.com/2ytib6.jpg
---
Bigger than the Promethean titans that capsuleers are allowed to use, yes, but the Iapetan titans are still many times larger than the Triglavian world arks.
---
Well, not a new trick TBH, there was news that someone tried to disguise Vigilant as Adrestia and scammed a Estamel's adaptive invul a few years ago
---
&gt; I use for casual ratting when I'm busy with RL stuff.
---
in other words, you're a bot as well basically
---
Semi-afk VNIs in heaven anoms.
---
Yup, Just seen the ARC tweet, This is going to be fun, And big.
---
Causea friend made it for me a long time ago cause its what I look like so I keep it, I sorta like it.
---
No, you're Spartacus
---
Perfect, cheers mate. Will give that video a watch
---
Its the one that puts it 10x the size of a titan.
---
When Uriel stated that he got the scale wrong, He was referring to the scaling he did that put it the size of a dread.
---
I don't have confidence in this csm anyway
---
And they haven't even been in the game files.for over 10 years.
---
I'm talking mechanically. Imagine a citadel with a jump drive
---
The point is that CCP probably didnt use them for input before making the decision. They were just told.  
---
Same with AT and this most recent tournament cancellation people worked hard to put on. CCP didn't use the CSM as a sounding board to tell them how short sighted those decisions were.  
---
The CSM are used as a small focus group, little more than that. Yet the title of the group infers more representative power.   
---
It's a joke at this point, and so is how dense you're pretending to be.
---
Now more questions kicked in:
---
Will this be player-flyable, if so, how to obtain BPC, how much construction material is needed, is Rubal Brisk related to this
---
Wait let me put that in google translate
---
[This](https://imgur.com/a/5Hjxf3c) is the corrected scale for the Xordazh, courtesy of u/Nickosaurus.
---
I have never had so Mutch isk in Eve online. ( Im always Broke )
---
Apps in. Here we go again!
---
Now, I wonder if we're going to get some Trig dreads to dock in it...
---
If you right click show info on an assembled ship it shows the name of that ship in place of the name of the hull.
---
So the onus of responsibility falls on the CSM no matter what? Even if they were consulted about $MATTER, advised against $MATTER, and CCP did it anyways? That's what you're saying with your "probably" horseshit.
---
Called snuff a bunch of f****ts.
---
&gt; And they haven't even been in the game files.for over 10 years.
---
Yet still they remain, especially in lore.
---
&gt;I'm talking mechanically. Imagine a citadel with a jump drive
---
The Xordazh also has very visible engines on its rear, which again, makes it clear that it's a ship, not a station/citadel.
---
Yeah it’s not a bad mechanic from our perspective. If you miss one it gives an exact drop time.
---
If you’re on grid it notifies you can should catch your attention :)
---
Exploitation of those who don't know is a cornerstone of eve gameplay.
---
Sad
---
I don't really enjoy talking with new people until I get the hang of them.  I'm a people watcher, as it were.  I don't mind talking that much, I just don't have the energy to keep up with it.
---
Yea. They should put effort in other things Then more damn skins
---
called someone a fag
---
anyone looked into the audio on this? seems like something might be encoded in there...
---
okay
---
Fuuuuuuuuc... That is BIG... I have a feeling that it will be AT LEAST the size of a Dreadnaught, if not Titan... 
---
The frame on that thing... jeebus...
---
The fact that the CSM have no weight to give CCP any reluctance in these decisions is my point.   
---
So what's the point if the only thing CCP uses them for are what amounts to balance passes?
---
Not by design. It is what it is, I guess.
---
&gt;that bubble bursts quickly and leaves a poor impression in its' wake
---
To be fair, there are groups for anything in this game. There are even hardcore roleplayers of that's somebodys thing. And they are (for the most part) super friendly and helpful people. The problem is that this isn't conveyed to you in any meaningful way. And the game also doesn't really give you the tools to search for them.
---
&gt;no achievable goals in an immediate future.
---
That's kinda the point of EVE tho. It's never about filling a bar or killing X in Y time, it's about doing what you want and having fun with it. The sandbox doesn't have a goal, but you can make one for yourself.
---
Just kidding Avree. You do my favorite vacuums
---
Don't worry, you can be falsely banned with zero communication *without* being on the CSM!
---
Not sure what I'm looking at, can anyone explain?
---
Thanks mate! We'll do our best!
---
Glad that I can disable notifactions on reddit...
---
&gt; Will this be player-flyable 
---
I hope no, when we see how titans are spammed...
---
&gt; if so, how to obtain BPC 
---
Probably running triglavian sites in Super/titan at least. Risk = Reward.
---
A little more color on that history.:  
---
* Pen Is Out, GMVA, Spaceship Bebop/Magnus Manus/Magna Digitus/etc., GOG and FedUp Gal Mil FW corps made up Galministan.  
---
* Spaceship Bebop/Magnus Manus/Magna Digitus/etc. were the same general corps but disbanded and created new alliances due to drama and not paying the alliance dues.
---
* Galminsitan crushes the Caldari and take Sov in Cloud Ring due to boredom.
---
* Pen is out left Gal-Mil FW
---
* Spaceship Bebop/Magnus Manus/Magna Digitus/etc. disbanded with QCATS going to GMVA and Black Fox going to Pen Is Out.
---
* Pen Is Out candy stomps FedUp and in the process evicts FedUp from all of their Black Rise, Cloud Ring and Pure Blind holdings.
---
* FedUp became TEST pets moving into their space and even dropping from GalMil FW for a period.
---
* GMVA and GOG remain in Cloud Ring and Black Rise as the last remaining FW alliances.
---
* Pen Is Out and the FW Alliances are NOT blue but are friendly given their shared history.

Casual ratting while multitasking is far, far less efficient than botting. And you cant do it 23/7
---
GMVA represent!
---
How dare nullsec alliances want to be safe.
---
You're all over the place, dude. You started by accusing the CSM of actual employee layoffs and departures, as if they could possibly have any agency over shit like that. That's on top of how they apparently had veto power over the AT. Now you're saying they're impotent. Which is it?
---
So running with the idea, a question to consider:
---
Where does the “blue loot” get turned in? There aren’t many NPCs in most of Null. Does it have to be trucked out to Empire? That instantly cuts into time and profit, discouraging people from ratting. Those who live in the far reaches of Null have the most risk to move the same value of goods, making it even less desirable.
---
jagex still a thing? wow i haven played rs in a long time
---
but they'll still do it
---
and if the blue is big, there'll be juicy freighter convoys to dunk now that faxes are capped
---
This is (essentially) how the Drone Regions ran back when drone poo was a thing. That shit was botted to death and back in those times, too. It didn't really slow them down.
---
yeah, internet people are apparently easily offended when they want to be
---
Some people think those are supercap scale docking bays
---
Perhaps? I would argue that for this sort of system to work, the value of “blue loot” would need to be higher than the current flat Isk payment to counter-balance the need to move physical materials through dangerous space for a payout.
---
Alternatively, I suppose a series of new NPC agents could be introduced in space. Maybe one per constellation? Or perhaps just two or three for an entire region. Hell, make a new iHub upgrade or two that causes them to be more prevalent and pay out more.
---
One issue is that there really isn't much of a sandbox. It's there in a few ways, but overall there isn't much to do in the sandbox. that boredom seems to have caused a lot of damage to the game.
---
A huge hurdle EVE faces is the fact that player expectations have changed over the years. remember the old video games? They flat out worked to kill you. There was no end game. Just survival. Nowadays people have no stomach for long term goals. It hurts games but it's been damaging to society overall. Look at how many hobbies and trades have fallen away because people simply have no interest in waiting. Smart phones, as an example, are marketed around this. How many hobby shops exist these days?. It's a big hurdle to deal with.

BlazingBunny for CSM
---
I'm confused which one is the right one...
---
There are lots of places in empire to drop off blue loot. Regions far into NS are somewhat safer from hunters so there is some balance of risk there. Other NPCs to buy loot could be added to npc NS regions. On another note, hunters can use citadel dropoff and asset safety to transport their spoils during roams.
---
Reeeeee
---
All Mods Are Bastards
---
thing is, it's not like you have to add more reward when you increase risk because the balance is already tilted towards reward, so they'll still do it even with more risk
---
You can't, you will get neuted dry by the tower in the first stage if you try.
---
You know goons smashed gotg so hard they broke right? It would be easy for goons to take out horde.
---
Sure, I'm not going to downplay that it was offensive and inappropriate, but it was one statement largely out of character for the guy. Slap him / make fun of him and move on?

No you're just bad at posting you need to stop

this is the trig dread

The docking bays you're talking about are on the front of the ship. [I'm talking about the rear, which has visible engines](https://i.imgur.com/0BXVYOI.jpg).

What's to be confused about there? All three images show the same scale, just with different objects.

Very interesting how r/eve eats all your fake shit. You lose half your space to the same bots you used to keep adms up and get rent from and you start a fake botting crusade. [LUL](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IGZDJWJyHi71qNipCB2BPqzBRglLVVKQJ9Y6Ob3QBDw/edit#gid=0) You didn't seem to mind them when they kept the adms up for you and paid the rent.
---
How come the bots from your renters are [feeding](https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98583202/) in horde renters now?
---
I'm starting to think we just need ratting to give you a fuckin combat timer, preventing tethering and docking for one minute. Though as long as we still have POSes to hide in (ccpls?) it won't work. Sure, bots can then bounce safes, but how often will bot runners change safes? Will probers be fast enough to warp hyperspatialed tackle to these safes? It keeps the ratters/bots in space, potentially threatened.

---
As much as I've trusted you guys over the years in your ability to mod such a [contentious, yet tight-knit community](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EVc9Vq9UjJ8/hqdefault.jpg), I can't help but feel like there's something wrong with this one.
---
Looking at [his record](https://i.pinimg.com/236x/e5/c7/1d/e5c71d5339375e1a464d377b8ae7b77c--baby-wombat-cute-wombat.jpg), Avery looks good on the surface. But if you delve a little more into his [discussions and interactions](https://i.chzbgr.com/full/6459702272/h0D51D228/) with users, he comes off as more combative than needed. I get this is a unique crowd to deal with, but [examples like this one](http://i.imgur.com/1zONMtt.jpg) just rub me the wrong way.
---
There are other [extremely capable candidates](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/89/47/a8/8947a8ac5b9bcee203e751b2c85c0635.jpg) out there that you guys are completely brushing off. They, too, have the proverbial tough hide to weather the brunt of this sub's ebb and flow, and at times, even the teeth to bite back.
---
Just take [other powerhouses](http://images.animalpicturesociety.com/images/00/3_2_wombat2.jpg) into consideration going forward. I'd appreciate it.
---
Neat.
---
But never really my point. Imagine it had the mechanical function of both a citadel and a capital. Someone can fly it, jump it, drive-by DD someone, all while a fleet is docked, referring and repairing, inside waiting to pop out and say "lol rekt" when they get where they're going.
---
Everyone in null, stop shitting where you eat, go take out a small gang roam. Go fight enemy gangs. If we all do this regularly (b0rt does this at least 3-4 times a week on a slow week) we can beat the narrative that nullsec players are just braindead f1 pushers.
---
&gt;The biggest issue is you have to rely on people being idiots and dying consistently
---
If this is your biggest issue, keep doing what you do. You should be fine. &lt;3
---
Well hello there
---
Hi Gay, its dad
---
well seeing as how it's just as easy to make a bot that creates safes as a bot that runs anoms, plus the fact that you can create thousands of safes in one system, that probably would hurt more than it would help.
---
I can't read for ya. I'm saying the CSM don't have any real input, so why have them.  
---
CCP outlines the CSM as  
---
&gt;As an elected representative, the CSM will have clear communication paths with CCP and a chance to influence the development of EVE Online.  
---
&gt;Generally, CCP wants to work with the Council of Stellar Management in 3 major ways:
---
Getting feedback on EVE development priorities and long term roadmap
---
&gt;Discussing ideas, theory and design approaches for potential EVE Online features  
---
&gt;Getting feedback on features in active development  
---
If you're really tellin me the CSM were content with Aegis and Citadel, while the community team got axed and did a great job creating the Brisc debacle, then I want off this wild ride.
---
How would this combat botting? it would not. 
---
it is easy to program a bot to pickup a MTU.  Most do right now.  Some don't because it isn't worth it to drop a MTU.
---
I kinda like this idea.
---
It would be interesting if the loot value varies depending on how much of the loot have been sold to the npc in the region.
---
Dopamine trying to redeem himself after shotty Brisc work
---
He said to not report blue bots.
---
I’d understand saying don’t kick/awox bots a bit more, but even FRT does that. And he is going a step further and just saying to completely ignore them, don’t even let CCP know where to look.
---
Absolutely. Last mention of the Gallente Iapetan titans, the Soltueurs, for example, was during the Battle of Caldari Prime in which it was stated that the Federation had its entire capital group of Soltueur titans on standby as a last resort. Prior to that, the Federation had naval exercises with a fleet that included a pair of Soltueur titans.
---
I didn't ask you to confirm my previous assumption, but thanks.
---
The ARC team figured out the actual scale, this thing is much, much bigger than a titan. I think it’s maybe a bit smaller than a Fortizar, iirc.
---
That would still make it a ***ship*** that simply shares the same functions as a citadel, but wouldn't be a citadel itself since it's not a stationary object.
---
Take the 10/10 shift the x to A and you've your loot table
---
What they need to do is make all pve have rats that point
---
That is no fault of the CSM. But if the CSM can't effectively advocate for the player base, the hard question you gotta ask is, what is the point?
---
A 100mn vni will have trouble scooping the mtu and warping before a fast hunter makes it to the site. Bots or players that scoop before warping are much more likely to be caught.
---
Well the Comment  above said size was wrong...
---
Just remove local, bot scripts would not see a Neut in local and not warp off.
---
That assumes that citadel = stationary. What happens if we drop that assumption?
---
Maybe a flex structure that people could put in systems then have some mechanic like an ESS where you could steal the blue loot "stored" in it?
---
It isn't wrong though. We're both giving the same scale. The other comment was referencing an earlier scale that has since been superseded and corrected by the revised one that I linked.
---
If that's what you like to do its great. But its not efficient in the least when you take into account the cost of the characters
---
A tech 2 vni alt is less than 100 mil.  The PILOT is 2+ BIL a month IN PLEX or $15 USD in cash if you pay monthly.   Seems like the op is using 4 or more. That's 8 bil isk or 60 bucks to drag cheap fit vni across space for A-type loot and maybe a couple pirate BS bpcs.
---
My one 6/10 farming smartbombing Machariel cost 2 bil ( so 5+ times as much as those 4 vnis). But that's a one time cost. The refit to run a 6/10 cost another 600 mil (again a one time cost if I don't lose the ship).  So yea I spent more on the ship.
---
But it also costs -6+ bil per month in over head compared to the op, 6/10s can drop a billion isk mod (9/10s can't) and its ONE site to do not 3.
---
Like I said, nothing wrong with what the op is doing if he likes it, but what he's doing doesn't mean that fleet suddenly doesn't suck.  It still does.
---
I'm getting some serious *Independence Day* vibes from this thing.
---
&gt;One issue is that there really isn't much of a sandbox. It's there in a few ways, but overall there isn't much to do in the sandbox. that boredom seems to have caused a lot of damage to the game.
---
Compared to other sandboxes there's so much, but overall I'd sadly have to agree. EVE is really just like a handful of gameplay loops, what changes is the interaction. This is what made the game what it is today and this is what keeps players interested. 
---
&gt;Nowadays people have no stomach for long term goals. It hurts games but it's been damaging to society overall. Look at how many hobbies and trades have fallen away because people simply have no interest in waiting. Smart phones, as an example, are marketed around this.
---
This is sadly so very true. EVE isn't really gaining players since the playstyle that EVE requires is going out of fashion. This hits especially hard since it's always been a niche game, and with that niche ever shrinking, the future looks dark for EVE. It may not end today, it may not end this year, but if this trend continues it will eventually fissle out and die.
---
&gt;How many hobby shops exist these days?. It's a big hurdle to deal with.
---
Most smaller cities either don't have one, or it's a mom and pop shop run out of dedication instead of for any real gain. It's super sad, because they used to be super interesting social spaces that my generation is just missing out on.
---
But why should we? Titans themselves are already the prime example of ships sharing the same functions as stations/citadels while being mobile and are therefore still classified as ships. There's zero need to obfuscate the already clearly-defined definitions for ships and for citadels/stations.
---
It’s not about adding complexity to bot programs, it’s about giving incentive to hunt them. The hunter gets to enjoy more loot and the botter makes less profit. I don’t think this change will eliminate botting, that is very unrealistic, but I think it would substantially improve the current situation.
---
Lol...ok. was just pointing out it works both ways. You build a big bureaucracy you get a ton of busy work and frustrated questions.
---
Can’t wait to see it
---
How dare you speak back to supreme fleet battalion leader Redalert447
---
&gt; Literally went on a fleet with him two nights ago.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; “Long fucking gone” indeed.
---
To be fair, if your attention span is measured in increments of 5 minutes, two days could be "long time".
---
Or even just until you lose gate cloak. In that 30 seconds you would have more than enough time to find and warp to them
---
The biggest benefit to asset safety (which I think is worth the downside) is that it allows a player who takes an extended break from the game to not come back completely impoverished.
---
Also, while it's not the biggest problem, this allows citadels in highsec to be useful, and not just massive honeypots that the owners wait to for unsuspecting noobs to fill with loot, and then unanchor them, similar to the problem that the delivery system was meant to solve (that it was basically impossible to get anything hauled between citadels in highsec)
---
I'll believe it when I see it.
---
Tbh if rats hit structures once a month and gave combat timers i would be happy
---
It can be.  Some of the biggest builders though pretty much charge jita sell, so really its just easier than shipping to jita.
---
Anyone else get Independence Day vibes when it sieges?
---
I dont think a single strat op or higher in test builds ships on a regular basis.
---
Can't dock in a titan.

The new faction citadel model that everyone wants to be a ship instead.
---
eagles can usually work pretty well.
---
IMO against 95% of the FCs in the games it would have gone a lot better, but Elo was able to coordinate the void waves quite well.
---
It was also a mixed legacy/test fleet, and we had some idiots broadcasting targets along with FC that caused split dps at least twice (each time that happened, it cost us about 3 ships in kills in the "time" component).
---
The player PvP tournament ended up being run (by myself, a CSM member), it just wasn't possible to stream it as a result of TD issues as described. That's not something the CSM can really change, or has ever really been intended to change. We're many things, but we can't actually go to CCP and program things for them.
---
Are you really unable of conceiving of a middle ground? Progress can be made towards a goal, and that progress represents value even if it's not everything you want.
---
That also implies that what you want is actually something that's good. That's impossible for me to say, because you haven't actually given any concrete examples; choosing to instead use terms like "Aegis and Citadel" like anyone knows what the fuck you're talking about. Shit ain't a hivemind; you have to state individual things clearly.
---
Also, the CSM would never have any input on "the community team being axed." That shit has nothing to do with anything you quoted. Trying to use that as proof or disproof of CSM malfeasance or impotence is objectively incorrect, no matter what spin you try to put on it.
---
Well, this guy follows me around everyday, bumps me off of everything, steals my stuff, blows up whatever he can, threatens me in game with threats on raping me and stuff...   He is literally griefing me.
---
This is the first round of concept art for the last members of the team.

---
I'll post them again when they are refined closer to what they're supposed to look like.
---
Not in-game perhaps, but certainly in lore:
---
&gt;*Titans are closer to mobile battlestations than actual ships. Indeed, someone unaware they were in a Titan might assume they are walking through a low-sec Naval station, as a Titan must provide similar facilities for its crew. They are massive in size, measuring several kilometers in length, with as much mass as some asteroids. Specialized space hangars must be constructed in order to dock the ships, which cannot dock at regular space stations.*
---
&gt;
---
&gt;[...]
---
&gt;*A Titan possesses many other, lesser-well-regarded capabilities as well, such as its ability to carry clone vats and have smaller ships dock in its hangar.*
---
It'll be profitable when you get a free 1 million SP from CCP!
---
Sell it now...? Buy it later...?
---
For real tho. Depends on if the item supply chains into other things. Be mindful of how it effects your regular products. If you are into speculatives start liquidating your current orders in order to buy the item at its low. ( only if it’s volume is high enough of course)
---
What stops them from storing the loot after every site they do? Even if you catch them before finishing the site, not much of a loot piñata either tbh..
---
Now if they limited the structures per region, so each alliance would have to place their structures strategically and then they implemented your idea, I think it could possibly workout in a way...
---
There is no equivalent to commodities market instruments, if that’s what you’re asking...
---
I know a thing or two about being involved in a niche hobbies with a shrinking population. One of my hobbies is weaving. Since so few people do this and so many don't know what that is I'll preemptively explain to the passing reader that by weaving I mean I weave cloth from spun textiles.
---
Local's still integrated with the game server (and especially since they fixed the local chat bug thing) so they could easily apply filters to who shows up. Or just not have your user attempt to join the local chat channel until you submit an action in the system, maybe.
---
A bit.  Tbh I think a titan could have faired well in a 1v1 war vs. the independence day ships.
---
I know there's one in stain and there's one in curse. It's just a few jumps tbh, although curse is much nicer (there's almost never anyone there but in stain there's almost always a loki trying to volley travel ceptors off the undock.)
---
&gt;GOLD CONSENT FOR XORDAZH CLASSIFICATION INVOKED
---
Guessing this means it is being released soon, if it has passed testing and received certification?
---
I'd love to do an escalation in a dread.
---
Again: I'm talking game mechanics.
---
Maybe? Or a structure you put the loot into, and it’s exchanged for Isk over a timer? Like, every item needs 20 or 30 minutes to be “packed for shipment” by a concord hauler? Some nonsense like that.
---
Any given pilot can only see their nay, but the thing can be popped (no reinforcement) and whatever is in there can drop from it.
---
What you are proposing basically does nothing to combat botting.  Again, it takes no time to work out a strategy and implement it to operate around what you are proposing.   What it does do is provide a mechanism to troll the shit out of normal ratters.  Which i guess is fine if you are looking to lower the population of eve.  And please please do not tell me that this would lead to more good fights.  The roamers are just looking to gank people and run away at any sign of home defense.
---
I've never even bothered with CSM. Do they actually do anything?
---
getting paid 10m per mtu kill and the ratters being forced to use MTUs wouldn't feel bad at all to me. It wouldn't make botting go away but it would certainly make null roaming more fun: chase the carrier off his haven and collect your PvP ratting payout.
---
First, thanks for *your* effort. It takes members of the community and CCP team donating their time to accomplish this stuff, without people like you EVE loses a lot of it's luster.  
---
Second, my regret is that you as a CSM body cannot get CCP to see the value of what I described and undoubtedly countless other things that players find important.
---
If you folks are pissing into the wind whenever something beyond the scope of balance passes or a new faction ship are being discussed, what is the value of your being there? What is the point of the very hyped election of representatives if those representatives have the combined strength of a wet noodle in respect for real, substantial game changes?
---
I'm glad you came around but you interjected with zero knowledge and are surprised people didn't like it so...
---
to be fair there's some crazy shit in old lore chronicles
---
Caldari embedding images of your crimes in your eyes so you constantly see them whenever they trigger the remote? all this and more!
---
First, Squizz does an amazing job running zKill.     
---
Second, one of the cool things about is is how much is player built.  
---
Lastly, look at any 3rd party account app for eve. . . now look at CCP's. Which would you use?
---
For anyone considering running that has 2 weeks of time to spare and a lot of extra cash to spend this is a great experience. As with all things in life the bad effortlessly drowns out the good but having seen it myself there is real value in the players being able to sit down with the Devs and talk through things. The game will never be perfect and the CSM will never have the power that people imagine it does but its still worth trying to do your part to contribute to the conversation somewhere that people are actually listening.
---
While the crew was wrapping up the translation work, Jaret Victorian was working on packaging it for you all for easy reference. :D

KITEZH "Китеж град" in Russian.   sometimes called the "Russian [Atlantis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantis)".

 According to legend, he must "manifest" on the day of the Last Judgment. On that day, when the dead rise from their graves, Kitezh will rise from the water. But you can see it and even achieve it now. A person in whom there is no sin will discern a reflection of church poppies and white-stone walls in the waters of Svetloyar Lake.
---
Well I would accept official bots .. like you get a app pay a little amount for the app and then you can set your ship to fly from A to B on autopilot (like for freighters) or just blindly mine .. no overview no local for you .. so if you have enemies in system you would have a problem ...would be nice to play low key eve on the phone and be in real eve and not a stupid new app
---
Yes and no, like sure GSF could remove horde from there current space horde would move and the cycle would repeat. 
---
Like the issue is nobody has anybody to install where GOTG / Horde currently lives.

Question:
---
&gt;What should we do when we find a blue botter? Report to CCP or report to our diplos?
---
Mittens:
---
&gt;You should probably not be reporting on your fellow goons
---
Tapi are very sensitive to the needs of endangered and extinct species
---
Don't shame them for caring
---
seeing as how any sign of home defense can have a cyno that instantly teleports a node collapsing number of supers onto you, can you really blame them?
---
Bring on the downvotes!
---
PVP?  waiting until the carrier warps to the next site and killing the MTU?  warping off if anybody jumps in?  that is some hardcore PVP!
---
You sound absolutely horrid
---
If its in trade and not a known friend its a scam, if its a known friend it could be a scam, if its your alt it might be a scam.                
---
             
---
Never use trade to swap items with people you do not trust, private contracts are as good as free, if they wont do a private contract its a scam
---
If you've played since 2003 but your Naari is 2 month old character than who is your main?
---
Init is diffrent to horde though, init has a lovely firm stance on botters. PH is also more open to, well, anything.
---
more likely this is incursions 3.0: abysmal edition
---
i'm in complete agreement that cynos (and kitey ass shit, fast align times, tethers, etc.) all have killed most pvp.  The solution proposed here does nothing to fix the problem, it just makes ratting in Null more of a pain the ass.  At the end of the day, roaming sucks balls  because null is empty.  Can't catch anything if there is nobody out ratting.
---
So is this post supposed to tell us that shit might actually get moderated around here? Or are we still going to see a plethora of non Eve related posts and mods getting butt hurt when people ask them to do their job around here?
---
When you use Stellaris OST, you know it's going to be relaxing.

this is why nobody takes you hisec candidates seriously
---
Hahahaha
---
So, what do I have to run to spawn these? Forsaken Hubs?
---
Yeah that's basically what I was thinking except give it a reinforcement but it would eject the blue loot after being reinforced the first time.
---
You’re forgetting our newly formed null security enforcement team
---
I know people care about isk/hour efficiency so much, but I say whatever keeps you engaged and enjoying yourself the most consistently, do that. I personally love all of the DED levels (if I have a ship capable of doing them) even if the payout is not as good as some of the others.
---
is there a source for that?
---
FYI your numbers are off.
---
A vni account will take between 100-300m/month to plex when you are skill extracting, which you should be doing.
---
K
---
Neither did I lmao
---
SP Farming and Market PvP for me.
---
&gt;There is still a culture growing in the player base that is accepting that botting is ineviable.
---
botting will exist as long as local exists
---
If you play it alone, at least ask people for help or advice when you are completely lost/frustrated/confused.
---
Lol that title
---
Absolutely common for anybody but goons to drop supers on poor unsuspecting PVPers killing VNIs right? This doesn't fucking happen if you don't fuck with capitals. And capitals have a very good reason to cyno in support, seeing as people who try to tackle capitals are either ***very fucking stupid*** or are going to cyno in a metric fuckton of bombers. Guess which one is more common? In 99% of cases the home defense response is a few frigates and maybe a handful of cruisers in an active TZ in a system close to staging.
---
None eve related posts get removed constantly. I guess sometimes they slip through though? Got anything in particular in mind?
---

free tears and all I had to do was play the game! :D

Saddest thing is that this is meant ironically, yet a lot of CODE members believe it unironically.

Not too bad of you didn’t pay for the escalations I guess.  But only 2 bil loot out of 9 sites kinda sucks.

no run away as fast as you can and dont look back...

Also if you could get 5000 supporters why do you need more people to vote for you? Last CSM the #1 place got 6644 and #2 got 3767 so 5000 easily puts you in.
---
Same here.

They specifically said they would be investigating further and taking appropriate action. That's not abnormal for any ban

&gt;I will advocate for the firing of Hilmar an bring in a better CEO for CCP.

wait what

&gt;I currently have over 5000 supporters who will vote me in. So I do not really need your vote other than to make a statement to CCP!

The original minmatar Ipeatian titan was a World ship for the Thukker Tribe.

I really want to cast a vote for someone that fundamentally misunderstands both how to play the game and what the csm does :)))))
---
You do not know if someone is multi-boxing or using a botting program.  You are not the judge, jury, or executioner.  I fully agree.  Only CCP knows that.  You're telling me that ITYOOL 2019 that CCP doesn't have monitoring software a la Blizzard with WoW?
---
I do use zkill, it was just more convenient to use the DOTLAN page and not have to switch to another website.
---
And i thought my ideas were bad.
---
This is possibly the most sensible and thought-through course of action that has ever taken place on this subreddit. I'm a little disappointed that there is absolutely no opportunity for drama and that this is the closest I can get to an on-topic shitpost.

What are the odds we get something similar to death wing in Cataclysm in WoW.

Giant ship that is virtually invincible that moves from system  to system and basically one shots any ship nearby. With a massive escort fleet.

i dont think you need lots of extra cash, afaik CCP covers most of the summit expenses.
---
This post makes me wanna vote. For anyone else
---
No, and I really should apologize for the snarky tone of my post but I’ve had numerous issues with mods on this sub getting butt hurt about asking them to remove a shitty post that’s completely unrelated and they respond with “I’ll start by removing your post. Lololololol.” Thinking it’s funny to be a completely incompetent moderator. 
---
Honestly, as someone who mostly just lurks this sub, I can see why people cry out “mod bias.” From the outside looking in it very well can appear to be a little circle jerk among friends.
---
Obviously. 
---
So if CCP knows what’s happening, surely a false report isn’t actually going to do much. They’re slow enough on banning actual bots that they obviously don’t just see reports and hit ban without checking.
---
I have a bot. I see that now I could be smashed harder than your mom and lose all the stuff that I'd worked hard (lul) for. So I take the hard decision and make my bot dock and unload it's cargo after each anom and go from earning 77887b a tic with my 756 alts to only 46522b a tic whilst I get to go take your mum out on a nice candlelight dinner. Maybe some wine. A romantic walk on the beach...
---
So sad. So hard.
---
Love to your mother btw. She's a wonderful woman and doesn't deserve this shit posting. Call her and tell her you love her. Unless none of that's true. In which case, don't. Call your dad maybe? I mean, he's alright. Not my type. But I'm sure he's cool? Unless he isn't either. Then at least you're cool, right?
---
Anyway. Bots gonna bot.
---
The report queue gets cleared out regularly, and mod mail is responded to promptly as well. If you send a message there, you should get a straight answer as to whether or not the post you're reporting is in violation of the rules.
---
It sounds like the audio's a voice over an old dial-up tone. Which would suggest that, if they could be isolated, a) there is some more information in the voice text and b) the tone has binary (possibly tertiary as they're Triglavian?) data encrypted into it.

LOL I love when people chime in and say something along the lines of "Oh I make like a bill a day with PI" and it turns out they sure do, they just have to use 45 toons to do it.

Back when ccp cared about lore they posted so much stuff on their websites (
---
The Drifters were already that in some cases. Arithmos Tyrannos could doomsday any subcapital after the overshield got removed, and there were fleets of 100s flying around. People still figured out how to cheese them either throwing suicide thrashers at them or kiting them with crazy fits.

Assuming you mean Salt Lake City, UT, we have a utah discord where we organize 2 meetups a year (summer/winter), can you get you a discord invite if you want

The delivery system is also used for things like rorqs delivering to raits. Plastic wrap only would eliminate that.
---
Cool. PM me an invite.

I hope to see you run again. It's good that there are people (expecially those already on the concil) that still believe in it.
---
Please elaborate, or are you just talking out of your ass? I see plenty of ways it can help and little downside except to those who profit from the current system.
---
Imagine dedicating this amount of time and effort to bashing Moomin Amatin L M A O
---
Down voted for ***stating the literal PH fleet looting policy.*** :D
---
You got problems bro lol.
---
Are you saying you would have to risk taking your loot to an NPC station to sell it, giving other players a chance to gank you on the way,  increasing your risk? Say it isn't so. Heaven forbid nullsec AFK VNI ratters should be exposed to anymore risk
---
They cover a lot of the travel related expenses. In a city where an 8 dollar beer is "cheap" and a burger and fries can cost 25-30 USD I think you are going to burn pretty substantial money even if you try to go semi-inexpensively. I spent over a grand per trip and I did not really do anything touristy or outright expensive it just adds up.
---
Yes. Hard to redact in game events.
---
Radical as in cool? Because that's how I see it. Only people I can see who would be opposed are risk-averse nullsec carebears.
---
First, don’t be a dick.
---
Second, I was asking the question to get an idea of OP’s thought/vision/whatever. I could assume what was meant, but I’d rather ask and actually get their answer on the topic.
---
I don’t much care about VNI ratting, afk or otherwise. But as someone who does ratting in null, these proposed changes would matter to me as much as to them.
---
A fort with massive engines and a singularity cage, more like a mega-capital.

Can I get one as well? Southern Utah checking in
---
my favourite little dude, plus DKS rules
---
Everytime I see a statement complaining about this just reinforces the idea that this is a change really would botting/AFK ratting a lot less profitable. Why else would people bitch and whine about it so much? 
---
Lets not forget the personal attacks about having sex with someone's parents. You know you've gotten under someones skin when they do that.
---
What's this from?
---
Pretty sure TagaraTiger is/was in Horde.  Never trust flairs, unfortunately.
---
Moomin’s voice alone is worth every individual isk
---
Ahh, fair.
---
I knew that guy
---
 I wasted too much time reading this, can I get a refund on my time please.
---
Not in HS though, poor newbros. 
---
But hell, just make 0.0 rats like sleepers, have them target drones with scram/webs, and plainly remove afk ratting.
---
read the thread.  there is nothing in this proposal that would take more than 2 seconds to program around for a bot.  IF anything, it hurts normal ratters because it makes ratting more tedious.  IT does not provide pvp, just adds additional "work" to live in null.  So if the plan is to not hurt botters, hurt regular null people, and do nothing for pvp, then great!
---
Oh look. A fuckwit.
---
It's not the CSM's fault, but it's a waste of everyone's time to elect a council of people whose job is to scream at a brick wall. If CCP's not listening, what's the point?
---
Better Call Saul

That's be impressive. Mostly because theres only 10 seats

I didn't have zero knowledge, i was mislead. I'll edit the original post if it makes you feel better just say the word.
---
Noob question, why not a Gila? More (medium) drone damage, higher shield+armor EHP, smaller sig radius, greater targeting range, more medium slots for tank.
---
Also rat hictors
---
A forting traveler!
---
how does the bot insta warp when local changes but also keep his money but also stay moving to avoid drone damage

Man, I've really enjoyed this ride

He's a P, you're a P, and you're working v him. It's PvP
---
is it me, or does it just look like a big hecate?
---
orbit MTU or just pickup loot after each site or every two sites.
---
I love how in this article, Salivan legitimately tries to imply that Moomin's leading questions are even vaguely as serious as a personal attack in the form of a suggestion of paedophilia.
---
I also love the horrendous use of the english language in this article, including the misspelling of "paedophilia". Come on Salivan, if you're going to use words, at least make sure you're using the correct words.
---
you mean after he has warped off and it is you vs the MTU?  so PVM?
---
Also shouldn't any decent corp in null have a freighter or local market proxy program in place?
---
I kinda like it, yes it's a bit more work to earn isk, but it encourages more play at different levels (the ratter, the marketeer, and the hauler).
---
One of CODE.'s greatest greatest ventures.
---
Very fun, thanks for the organization of this and for the spirit of competitors

I would do 9 sites in drones and pull double in just salvage.

quick 5$ handies in the mcd's bathroom.  can make about a plex every 20 ish minutes. Best ticks to be sure.
---
we updated some of the graphics following feedback on video one - hope that makes it easier to see the teams
---
While the quite may be twisted one way or another the sentiment is certainly there. I haven't played for a little while but I actually joined an Imperium corp (wasn't goons itself) and when I asked about reporting input broadcasters the response was "why screw over your own alliancemates?". I don't want to name names as they are generally nice people and just see it as "everyone does it why can't we". Also mittens would totally be ok with it even if he wasn't publically :P
---
And really it isn't that misunderstood. While CCP should monitor for bots and such they also should rely on reports, just like other MMOs, games, and even real life authorities. Reports are important. It is their jo to INVESTIGATE those reports. He quite literally said do not report goons because it's goonfucking. It is 100% a supershitty thing to say. I understand you saying "hey people can multibox and not isbox, if you don't know the difference don't report." No he just said a blanket don't report at all.
---
I want to be neutral as possible
---
You can read good for you
---
That's why i am running
---
1. I can understand wanting to avoid PvP because of a lack of experience or skill, but you need to remember that the majority of PvP is never going to be fair. Hunting explorers with an astero is a great example of this, you take only fight you know you can win, and you have enough time to gather any intel you need to ensure it isn't bait.
---
2. Yes and no, if you had high enough standing then diamond rats would ignore you, or even rep you, but that only applies if you have your standing above 2.0. Normal pirate rats will attack you regardless of standing. Unless you want to take missions offered by a pirate faction, or want to [bait people and use rats as support](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ale608/video_how_does_the_npc_ess_trap_work/), your pirate standing doesn't matter. Pirate factions don't get faction police so feel free to tank them as much at you want.
---
3. &amp;#x200B;
---
4. Playing as an alpha is a great option. I'd be careful of trying to "earn" omega status though. The grind to make the 1.5-2 bil you need to do so every month will quickly lead to burn out. It is certainly possible, but how much time do you want to spend earning what is essentially $15. One option is to use skill farming to subsidies the cost of a subscription. If you are remapped correctly with +4s an account will take around 200m to PLEX after selling the month's worth of SP. This will make you omega, but you will effectively be unable to train skills. Every ISK you earn after the 200m can be turned back into SP, usually because it means you only needed to extract 2 injectors worth instead of 3 that month. Whatever you choose though, be carful that grinding to play the game doesn't become playing the game so you can grind.
---
5. Even if your goal is empire building, I'd still look for a corp to join at first. You can learn how to run a corp easier that way, and maybe you can recruit some of the friends you make into your own corp when you eventually leave to create it. The single best resource in EVE is your friends, and the best way to make friends is to join a corp. (it's certainly not the only why though)
---
Moomin is cool no worries
---
Yes r/Jackarvey , I definitely 112% agree with this
---
They are not all still on the Eve website. Some never got moved (correctly).
---
I will have CCP terminate your account, for stalking
---
The retardation is real.  NOTHING to see here
---
Why i said i do not need your vote just want to make a point
---
warning: this blog post doesn't contain anything of value to anyone
---
"Why else would people bitch and whine about it so much? "
---
because changes like the one proposed here hurt actual ratters while bots give zero fucks.  
---
As a bonus for botting, this would works as another layer of laundering isk.  Just have a clean character drop the MTU and pickup the loot and the bot couldn't be traced.
---
Yes theses are my alts?
---
Not unless you know it will go back up later. People will sometimes intentionally crash a market, but that is usually either to pick up a lot of volume cheap to resell when it stabilizes, or to drive competitors out.
---
They do not reflect your claims of having played since 2003 or FCing for "well known alliances such as BoB and other major alliances." 
---
Do you have another alt that can verify these claims?
---
&gt; paedophilia
---
Pedophilia (alternatively spelt paedophilia) is a psychiatric disorder in which an adult or older adolescent experiences a primary or exclusive sexual attraction to prepubescent children.
---
Thanks for playing.
---
Empire would work fine IMO: I run 10/10s for my isk and taking a travel ceptor with OPE through a wormhole is never hard. If you aren't in a big bloc you might need to wait a bit longer for your wormhole but if they keep the blue loot in the same size category as wormhole blue loot you can cram a billion isk in a travel ceptor pretty easily,
---
It’s funny to read someone criticizing rhetoric with an entire shitpost of ad hominem attacks.

I hope its a death star to destroy the citadel spam.

imagine spending your time writing a huge ass article about martini, salivan is the olmeca of snuff

Just because he killed your structure in game he can't respond to this giggle of a thread?
---
You're an idiot, even WoW depends on reports. There is monitoring, but every game requires asks people to report. They fucking ask you to report shit in real life too :| If you saw someone commit a crime would you just be like "nah it's someone else's job to deal with it". Of course you wouldn't :| (least I damn well hope so).
---
Again, trying to sidestep providing any form of proof?
---
Everyone makes mistakes, and it sucks but no ones perfect. As a whole though more good is done then bad, which is why you should report.

An entity of tens of thousands is packed in a single region, imagine the amount of reports by people who are mad a VNI is taking their site for the 152nd time this week. 
---
Things get taken to a diplo who then forwards them to ccp if there is actual evidence of a botter.
---
Surprised they are still doing the CSM
---
I'll trust you to not talk about things you don't understand next time, then? Glad to hear. Please leave these discussions to the adults.
---
Which would force content closer to Highsec as alliances scrambled for better space.

Would also mean the edges of null would be more populated while the edges of space would be more dead. Which makes sense

Smart krabs never leave their shell.
---
I proven my point and i am done talking to you
---
Other video games, especially mmos, also ask for people to report cheaters as well :P
---
And no people should report to CCP. Like with any agency that has to investigate reports someone who cries wolf too much will be taken with a grain of salt unless they are just dead retarded. I'm not sure who "we" is but I was in the Imperium not too long ago (don't play atm) and was told not to report suspected input broadcasters (to anyone, much less CCP or diplos). Every big name awoxs botters and such every now and again, it's a good show for sure but certainly not often enough to really cull all those who cheat within them. Not that they need to, because it isn't their job to investigate botters it's CCPs. If they want to power to them but you should NOT be asking players not to report shit.
---
Just let it die.

For my 2 summits there seemed to be a pretty big group of the older CSM who had some disposable money that tried to squeeze some fun and nights out into the week away from home. Even a cocktail in the hotel lobby was like 20 dollars or more. So a student doing everything they can to avoid spending money is probably a lot different mileage than some 30-40 somethings visiting a foreign land.

Is this how you will treat the playerbase once you are in the CSM?

This is a troll account. I actually responded and then deleted. Got me.

Talk about fighting fire with fire. Taking on Moomins baseless ramblings with your own baseless rambling is one way to do it I suppose.
---
I've thought about it, but didn't dare mention it bcs downvotes. :(
---
I am all for fucking it!
---
Make ratting as profitable, by rats dropping some kind of tokes, that have to be echanged, limiting the liquidity, but also make it more manual and stop that fucking endless isk faucet. Maybe even combining tokens into a certificate that is exchanged for isk value in special stations like Concord's 
---
The idea of stopping insta printing of free isk out of nowhere gives me a hard-on.
---
No worries! I’m glad people enjoy the show :)
---
The line you are thinking about is a 4 second clip of a minute long section "Do not report blue bots, it's goonfucking" as to why, exactly what happened to Brisc. Someone reported him for something that didn't happen and CCPs incapable security team slapped a ban without a proper investigation. If Brisc wasn't a CSM member, the trio would still be banned.
---
too late.  diamond npcs in hs scram and hit hard.

the fuck would you know about it?

It's a player's MTU. If he fails to defend it, that's you winning at PvP

I have no reason to falsely give praise to Horde, just saying they do take action, as we do as well. As for you, believe whatever you believe as long as you are happy in life.

Saying not to report /= hide them

Also, we've killed/removed from our alliance botters that we've found but I'm sure that'll get drowned out in the all the anti-goon rhetoric.

i do not need your vote

Thank you kindly. I assumed it would be something stupid but I feel like that would have been an important thing to mention.

since CCP banned me from talking on the forums i had to switch platforms

Those prices you posted (8 dollar beer, 25-30 for a burger) are similar to Reykjavík prices actually. You can get by on about 200-300 dollar budget if your hotel room has a kitchen and you're not eating out every night.
---
It takes time to research and I think there’s just a lot of reports that come in to investigate. It’s why players need to help the process along.

you can make that running a single 6/10

'Regular' ratters also need to be fucked with... Hard.
---
Saying that as regular ratter that pays for his PvP ships from VNIs in heavens. AFK isk making is not ok and should be destroyed. It is boring as shit, so 'ticks' should be higher, hut have to be also very intense and hard.
---
Like abyssals. CCPLS, just connect th abyssal game play to regular anoms and make the open for everyone in a system, ffs.

The "get your account banned" statements were too over the top. The rest fit.
---
Actually you really do... The more you alienate, the more votes are against you
---
Spoiler alert: you're not fixing it
---
The "get your account banned" things were too over the top even for that guy.
---
"I don't know why, but I am loving this font a lot.  
---
Was able to download it. It is fun to use. good job CCP &lt;3"
---
I think you missed my deliberately obtuse point.
---
We can so many posts about this every day on this subreddit with half-thought through "brilliant" ideas that it has basically become shitposting at this point. Shitposting should only be responded to with shitposting.
---
However, as I said early on in my initial comment, what is this going to do to a botter? They adapt the program and make slightly less money. Instead, Joe Blow who's been ratting for 7 hours until his brain starts trying to escape through his nose because he's so bored now has to haul all that loot to an NPC to be able to profit from them only to find that the NPC's system is gate-camped so he, at best, can't get through or, at worst, loses all his stuff.
---
All of the recent suggestions to tackle botting haven't considered how they hurt the average player even worse. Only CCP dealing with reports in a way that makes players believe it is worthwhile to report bots will tackle the number of bots.
---
Oh shit, it's modular. It's a T3 super cap!
---
Correct :)
---
No I've just lost any faith whatsoever in CCP. I appreciate you guys for trying, but you're trying to bail out a sinking ship in my opinion.
---
Dont wait for CCP to do anything against it. You will die of old age. Months ago i reported some ice miners who are active almost 24/7, with near perfect efficiency (not idle time like afk miners usually have), but they are still mining today. I was thinking of hiring some1 to gank them, but then again, i barely play EVE anymore, so i dont really care.
---
World Ark makes it sound like it's the vessel they're going to be coming to our space in.
---
... I've been such an idiot.
---
Our triangle experts have said the rest of us need to pick up the slack, so it was good practice. ;)
---
Some of his crazier stuff on the forums was deleted by ISDs so i am not sure.
---
In that case you won't be on the CSM ballot. You have to pass CCP scrutiny beforehand and if you can't post on your main on the forums, you will never be allowed to run.
---
Keep it up agent!
---
There was a corp living next door to mine. There was a fun conversation.
---
My CEO: "Hey guys, I know what you're up to and I don't like it."
---
Them: "What are we up to?"
---
CEO: "I know you're botting. There's no way every single one of you rats 24/7."
---
Them: "We don't bot. We share accounts!"

If only
---
Haven rats rarely get within point range of over-propped VNIs though. They'd need to be super points, like a Garmur's.
---
If you're bad enough to get banned from the forums, you don't really have a chance at running for CSM.
---
CCP made a point that if any alliance is knowingly condoning or allowing botting  they would be punished too.  Seems CCP have never followed up on this threat.
---
Wait. Did you just call Eve a sport?
---
Cheers
---
I’m pretty sure most all 0.0 entities have been in wars since the introduction of wardecs - there have been very few days Goonswarm hasn’t had one since I have been in it. There are also a number of ways around this. So Tbf I don’t think that has anything to do with it.
---
No, I called League of Legends a sport, huehuehue.
---
When active players numbers are shit or PLEX prices are out of control.
---
The point is if someone enters system, the bot warps off, leaving the MTU with loot. It's not a silver bullet to kill all botting, but I think it makes it harder for them to make ISK with people hunting them. As it is, they get money deposited directly in to their wallet by just killing the rats with absolutely no way to disrupt that. They can just warp out of site and wait until local is clear. They don't lose any of their payout from the site.
---
I didn’t see those highsec CSM members make any positive changes what so ever for highsec either lmao.
---
At least he isnt a thief, Dirk "Gets invited to peoples houses and steals things" Stetille
---
Yeah, sorry I tried to get Benedict Cumberbatch but we used all our budget on Void S and Exotic Dancers.
---
This is a video game.
---
I don't even play anymore, I'm not bad and like I said in another comment I was in goons and I liked the people who told me not too. I'm not mad, just a little taken about by your stupidity :P Your meme response is well in line with that though :P
---
That was one of the most cringe-making hurte-butt embarrassing rants I've ever read.
---
I suspect that you'll do yourself a favour and delete it tomorrow, and hope that everyone forgets about it.
---
At least you called my dialogue “semi-weighty”.
---
Subs are always cheaper. I don't understand why people buy plex with RM to buy game time.
---
12 month sub form Amazon is like 8EUR per month whereas 1 month for 500 plex is always above 15 EUR. Basic maths.
---
Please tell me again how rough you nullsec raters have it; I couldn't imagine the struggle you go through on a daily basis warping to sites, running semi-afk while you watch Netflix, and then warping off to another site when you're done, all the while having an intelligence network that exploits the chat system to let you know when there are enemy combatants 10 jumps out.
---
Why is Dirk MacGirk eve famous?
---
I haven't played in years but I swear I was in the same Corp as him when he first became an FC.
---
Might just be someone with a similar name
---
"a bloo bloo I got banned from the INN Discord, so here's why the mittani is literally fucking SATAN HIMSELF also something something Brisc something penif did nothing wrong something"
---
I’m not saying it's on him...I'm saying if it's that important to him he can't expect others feel the same level of care.
---
Well then..
---
https://imgur.com/y6mTzcf
---
I thought you were making an acute point
---
Every alliance has killed a few, nowhere near enough to cover all their botters. It's a show and it's for good fun but they aren't really cleaning up themselves. You're an idiot if you think they are really keeping themselves clean by killing someone very once in a while (I know  you're an idiot though). I quite literally have been told not to report cheaters, too my own face.
---
'Harkoning' back to the misues of words...
---
Posts like this are why long, rambling fits of empty vitriolic butthurt are best left to professionals like Seraph. Did you not have a 'Butthurt rambling template' to use?
---
Just goes to show you know nothing about me, I'm a cat person
---
Hahahahahaha, this is top tier pooposting
---
I am going to let you sit and think about what you just said.
---
I tried to have this argument with someone yesterday. And actually continued part of today. They could not be convinced that BRAVE of all corps do not drop caps on literally everything that passes near GE.  Some people just have a pre-conceived notion of null corps or are running off a bad experience they had.
---
You still should m8
---
Was gonna say that. Bónus is your friend!
---
No I have in fact listed to the entire minute 30 long clip before. CCP response to reports is generally good. Sometimes it isn't but as a whole they ban FARRRRRR more people who deserve it then don't. You should still report. Also I've been in goons and was told not to report cheaters and was told it would only screw over allies (it was input broadcasting and not botting though, generally people are more ok with it).
---
Possibly his therapist?
---
IM is part of INIT and a full member of the Imperium, it is not appropriate to list them with renters and sov-alt alliances. LUCK is not part of the Imperium and putting it as associated is an exaggeration, they are neutral but on good terms.
---
This is good because so many nerds are being a bunch of butthurt ch00blords over it. Good show Sal. Never stop posting, and tell penif I say hiiiiiii.
---
You are the poster we need but don't deserve x
---
Yep.
---
You can reduce your spend relatively easily, but it does limit what you can do. 
---
Lunch in the CCP canteen is free, but it's a bit harder to talk about prior or upcoming sessions, when the people involved may be at the same table. 
---
If you're a _poor_ student, I'd suggest not running.
---
Ahem, I was asking while plex is on sale, unless you’re talking about people in general, I was asking a genuine question, plus I’ve never bought omega with plex.
---
I think /u/AugustSun just wanted to post pictures of wombats. Or have a wombat mod.
---
You don't this if local refuses to update correctly on its own in the first place.
---
ut only if you look at it form the right angle
---
That's fair criticism. Things have gotten a bit stupid around here lately. Not really an excuse here but an explanation is the sheer amount of garbage in modmail, discord pm's, reddit pm's can make it pretty easy to just be 'always on' with shit posts.
---
There are some cases where there's a lot more to the story though. The mod bias threads for example are often times just bait threads - often posted by friends for shits and giggles (just as an example). We basically meme with the term at this point. The reality is our top mod is Chribba, we have Durrhurrdurr (One of the  OG TEST leaders), 2 former CSM's (one is a small gang type the other NPSI), a Skillu mod, 2 PL mods, 2 goon mods and a third (goon) temporary mod whose just helping out with some stuff. The effective team leader is an NPSI guy. Those 2 reasons are why most of the time you see us mention it, it's tongue in cheek. Again, not really an excuse. Just an explanation.
---
Personally I've been avoiding all of that since the last Olmeca thread. I said my piece but it's a dead topic.
---
You have my bow
---
(We'd actually been talking about it for a fair time before then)
---
I think CCP mentioned something like that at either Fanfest or Vegas last year as a possible future Upwell structure. However, I believe the throw-away comment about it was that local would only exist in that system if you had the structure up instead of it working as a jammer.
---
You guys did a perfect job with the bombs xD
---
And so it begins...
---
I hope that the powers that be work to increase participation in the voting.
---
"Don't take this thing seriously, because I won't."
---
nice
---
The funny thing is that it is super easy to write and decode locally. It's basically a flip of a switch. But to share it, I save it as an image and it becomes harder.
---
I take it you are new. You will soon find out CCP maths obeys different laws. Not always, but a year or two ago there was a fail with their discounts that were declared as 15%, but in reality were 0%.
---
I mean, you could come out to Null. Admittedly, it’s a pretty good life when you have a group that’s organized for it. There are plenty of opportunities, and groups that’ll help you get settled. This is my third time, and it’s significantly better than the first two.
---
I’m not sure how you see anything as “exploiting” the chat logs. They’re stored on the client machine in plaintext. If CCP didn’t want them accessible, they wouldn’t be so readily available. Near2, or one of its kin, works in the same manner.
---
Translation: I PLAY THE GAME DIFFERENTLY THAN YOU AND THEREFORE AM BETTER THAN YOU ON A DEEP, PERSONAL, FUNDAMENTAL LEVEL!
---
Jokes on me, there is literally nothing substantive in this article.
---
Did you just literally admit that this would decrease bot profits while also implying it's not worth doing?
---
A solteur was even in game once.
---
Congrats and thank you :)
---
Spoooooon i miss you!
---
I thought EVE was already dead?
---
* PI on 2 toons in ns
---
* Exploration in ns/ls/wh 
---
* Little bit of mission running in hs/ns
---
* Little bit of hauling in hs
---
Things for the future:
---
* Seed the market a little in npc null (ammo, guns and mods. Nothing expensive). 
---
* Start a jf chain from npc null to hs, so casuals like me who also live there can move their belongings in/out of null
---
Good enough for a casual player like me.
---
They're a group of players that advise CCP on changes needed to make life easier in goonswarm. 
---
So sure, they do things.
---
i like it
---
Calling someone names and attempting to reason with them is the worst way to conduct discussion.
---
botting wasnt an issue when you had to pay $$$ for subs CCP just saying.
---
A good argument can be made that if they want to quit the game or go on a break, they can move their shit to a NPC station. 
---
What a lazy fucking excuse, if unorganised people that don't think of safing up their stuff before leaving get punished, who cares
---
Clearly discussion is on your mind when your last response was "Can you get more mad about it buddy?". Nice backpeddle retard :P
---
Penif is a way more veteran Goonfucker. Stop making me relevant by comparing him to me.
---
Thank you sir, for reminding me why I should never click on reddit posts that directly link to a blog.  
---
I now know you can get brain cancer from reading...
---
GG
---
Then botter adds a second bot in a frigate to pick up the loot every 10 minutes
---
This has to be a troll. lol, good laugh.
---
^^^^^^^^^
---
So anyone taking bets on who's gonna lose one first?
---
MAKE DEADTEAR A MOD. THESE PROBLEMS SHALL CEASE.
---
I can't pin down a daily income for my market PvP but year to date I've brought in +/- 300b.
---
Jita pvp is strong
---
I would rather have a csm made up of Marmeca Goa'uld's alts.
---
Bring back drone poo.
---
So Mr McBotterson was earning 150m per tick per alt but now only earns 100m per tick per alt after changing the bot. They have 25 alts so they still get 2.5b an hour so only need to bot for 25 hours a month to cover the costs of running the accounts and the rest is pure profit. To PLEX has cost the botter an additional 50 hours spread across 25 accounts so 2 hours in real time.
---
Joe Blow earnt  100m per tick but now, because of having to loot every ship, salvage and then either docking up between each site and then hauling to the NPC or hoping they don't get popped in sites and losing all their income, he only earns 90m per tick. Even though he's lost less per hour than the bot, it now takes him around 28 hours (with no losses) to PLEX his account - and additional 3 hours per month.
---
So in this examples the botter loses out on 2 hours whilst the average player who is constantly having to check d-scan and now can't semi-afk as he can't rely on bounty income. loses out on 3. It disproportionately hurts the player to the point that it actually becomes *more* profitable to the botter as they lose out on less.
---
This is also ignoring that a bot will dock up as soon as someone comes into local whilst a player might not as they went to the bathroom or they were checking d-scan and forgot to press scan that one time.
---
This suggestion is focused on improving roams which would be fine if it was solely trying to increase content (although that would just meant null standing fleets and super-cap umbrellas would become even more iron clad). But it's not. It wants to tackle botting and if it were to come to pass your average player will lose more than a botter would.
---
There is a long history of combatting these ratting bots. It's all over this reddit. Something about cloaky something or other
---
Alright, that was a quality explanation. You've accomplished the uncommon feat of changing someone's mind on the internet.
---
I always hate Moomin's inn post it 99% spin bs.
---
Cost is probably the easiest answer. its 60m vs 200m(?) for a gila. While more tanky, iirc its less mobile.
---
JUST MAKE A BOT THAT REPORTS BOTS ALL DAY, SOONER OR ATER CCP WILL NOTICE
---
It’s been suggested, but the odds of it actually happening are near 0
---
He was shooting all of them, my devoter was the only one left at the end.
---
Penif drools less during it.
---
Personally I cringe harder when the rag warps.
---
&gt;either I am retarded or WordPress is
---
I'm gonna go with both
---
[Nice.](https://i.imgur.com/sAkiBcH.png)
---
Thank you for the compliment.
---
In fairness to the OP, I think it's great that they're trying to use players actually playing the game to tackle botting without having to become the bot police as most people suggest.
---
The problem is just that it doesn't differentiate between players and bots and, whilst it could lead to more fights, it would need massive game mechanics changes to fix sov null first as, elsewise, Rorqs being everywhere would have already brought more fights instead of less.
---
Poes Law, EvE style. Is this the real Naari or is it just a troll.
---
(Yes, I know the real Naari is a troll)
---
To be honest, considering how I have a long road ahead of me... a Venture without anything fitted on it or an officer fit battleship kill : I take it all &gt;.&lt;
---
INN is literally the Fox News of Eve. Feeding koolaid and bullshit to people with preexisting beliefs formed via kinship/cult membership relations. That's not to say it doesn't have any useful content. Like all successful koolaid media outlet, they feature better people like Jin'taan, Rahne or some NC/PL/PH dude every now and then to derive legitimacy. It's managing is incredibly professional. Should be featured to some dissertation somewhere. 
---
More broadly, the way Imperium is being led through warlordism, the "us and them culture", encouragement of constant shitting on select fodder personas (like myself) on social media, the way they think they need to cultivate hate to keep their coalition unified etc. did long-lasting damages to the ecosystem of Eve and is one of the meta reasons why the game is so stale. Like nobody even cares anymore and it's not like there is an existential threat to their coalition, but the way they inherit/keep the culture going is really disheartening. 
---
All that being said, I don't think some dude in INN deserves your attention this much. And I don't think you should use "mentally ill" as an insult. Every week I get 50 Imperium members claiming that I am mentally ill on reddit. The Imperium toxicity I endure would have been really problematic if I was someone with real mental issues (like many people do and nothing wrong with it). That's their level, and you can't sink there if you claim to be better.
---
I get my giggles from unironic gon egos and #fakenews as much as the next goy, but this shit is just... Wtf?
---
Lol. Says the person not aware of what Aegis or Citadel were. OK chief o/
---
It reminds me of the original Jovian Motherships which were built as ark ships to carry the entire Jove population in stasis. We know the Trigs are related to the Jove 2nd empire in some way. This thing is bigger than any other ship in the cluster, except for possibly the Gen1 Empire titans. This thing being some sort of city ship rather than a battleship sounds likely right now.
---
Whut, where did this even come from?  The official looting policy is a free for all loot-fest AFTER the fight.  MTU's are forbidden and can/will primaried by the FC.  Occasionally tackle and other small ships will be told to loot the field before a fleet is stood down, such as after a small skirmish while bashing something far away from home.
---
BUT HE RAN MY DED SITE
---
Yup! I don't think you don't call your combat flagship a world ark.
---
yeah, I just [need to learn](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76367568/) how to [stay on anchor.](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76397448/)
---
did he steal your boyhood?
---
looks like everyone involved had tons of fun
---
Not a bad idea but instead Just remove local and you both make roaming more viable and hugely nerf botting.
---
&gt; Why is Dirk MacGirk eve famous?
---
He's famous for being that creepy uncle at family functions that can't handle his booze...except he live streams it on twitch.

Ah OK, that makes sense.

I have had the mining offer 3 times total.

I do like to read his posts tho. That proves I’m not the most retarded guy XD
---
I found razor.
---
xD that too!
---
&gt; encouragement of constant shitting on select fodder personas (like myself) on social media
---
Have you ever considered not being dumb as fuck?
---
So it’s more work for them
---
Isn't it like mandatory multiple regions for each?
---
You could have buy orders in NPC null. Or just make it empire stations like blue loot, and you have to use your corp's JF logistics or find a wormhole to liquidate it.
---
Then why's there 9 overseer effects?
---
They don't in NS?  Jeez.  I had no idea. 
---
wormholer btw
---
Nobody really answered you, but they deal with more "petty" day to day issues within the alliance. Fueling JBs, dealing with ratting/mtu/ded/mining/PVE drama, and they oversee the "Blessed Bean" corporation. They also lead a lot of the industry stuff. Basically, they make sure beans have a good time. Directors do all of the top level corp/alliance shit and let landscapers deal with the small stuff.
---
This doesn't really address botting, bots can be written to pick up MTUs, but it's still a good idea, because it means there is some incentive not to warp off the moment someone hits local and leave your MTU and loot behind.
---
*it's bigger than the last one*
---
" I’m not saying it's on him "   but " It's your responsibility to reach out to people, " ....  
---
You totally said its on him, and based on his initial post he did reach out and got nothing for his trouble.
---
Give all the rats sleeper AI, with webs, points, drone targeting, etc.
---
Pelligro is overwhelmed, lets not act like all of CCP is engaged in the war against bots because they aren't. There's one guy we know of doing it and he is overworked to the point of being a punch line because in the grand scheme of things CCP doesn't care.
---
FYI "loot instead of bounties" is an idea that gets suggested once every month.
---
&gt;  Now when you kill a vni bot that has been ratting for hours straight, you get all of that profit and the botter gets nothing.
---
No. The bot software will get an update to drop loot every few sites. You will never get hours of farm.
---
Yeah no
---
Well then how am I supposed to complete higher level ratting sites in my low level ship?
---
Eve spaghetti code
---
just make faction ships omega only and the ratting problem is solved, the two most efficient alpha ratting ships are gilas and VNI's and a massive part of the botting population is VNI's. It sucks that it would affect real players but at this point its getting to the point where they have to do something and an imperfect solution that affects most botters and some players is better than CCP continuing to do nothing.
---
Translation mentioned "Kitezh classification". You know that Kitezh is the name of the old mystic slavic city? I bet it is a citadel of some sort, not the capital.
---
It's his thread/picture. We can just ask him.
---
Team names are fantastic.
---
so by your logic the death star isn't a station its a ship because :engines:
---
Vert you sir are a king of thieves and would steal the chair out under a person (in game).
---
Pretty sure it's one big competition to see who can use NDA info to profit without leaving enough evidence of breaking NDA.  This is probably what happened with Brisc, he was just smart enough not to leave evidence that would hold up in court.

Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. That's crazy. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet.
---
We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow.

Invite sent

hahahahaha 5000 supporters... gl finding 5000 ppl (not alts) that still play eve. =P
---
This doesn't combat botting. It only requires a minor change in bot behavior. The only major directed change is that roaming is benefitted, and multiboxing a separate salvager is promoted.
---
This is just a proposal of self-interest.
---
True, can't call that a solution though
---
ppl still use forums?
---
Found r/wallymarts alt right here

Yes

Close your launcher, reopen it and let it do patch. You didn't restart launcher after DT and you are missing new patch files.

Technically the death star would be a carrier. With an equipped superweapon. Station is just the closest we get for it. Stations however don't move, these things do.
---
&gt;addressed highsec like “war” exploits for one
---
No. That was because the number got out showing how many players it consistently forced to quit.

Rorquals are great content generators! Look at how those panic timers allow the defenders time to form a proper responce force to fight. Wait...

Daily reminder that furries are canon and Caldari have been known to genetically augment themselves to be their fursona.

---
Is this for real?
---
Oh shit thanks for the sticky r/eve mods - CSM and r/eve mods coming together to do something, truly this is the end of days.
---
CSM is just another level of the meta game. CCP showed us how much they enjoyed it by immediately banning those believed to be involved while protecting(?) the fake snitch.
---
This post wreaks of AstroTurf...
---
*We're talking about EVE-Online here, not Star Wars*. It has been very consistent in EVE that ones that are mobile are classified as ships, and ones that are stationary are classified as stations/Upwell structures. You need only to take the example of the gigantic Iapetan titans (which are ships, not stations) to see how EVE classifies things.
---
Why don't you get gud and actually hunt people instead of posting your shitty idea on reddit
---
Read the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/eve/wiki/rules).
---
Recruitment posts are not allowed in r/eve with few exceptions.
---
You got it all wrong. Being banned with no communication will happen sooner or later, being on CSM just gives you better chances to get unbanned.
---
well its no moon
---
They are a pressure valve allowing players to rage vote instead of bitching in public and nothing happens unless it benefits f1-drones/rorqs/bots.
---
It definitely was in PH.
---
&gt;I refuse to let one incident stop me from trying to improve the game I enjoy
---
Thats great. You think the current CSM didnt want to "improve" it?
---
This is the Titan CCP has been wanting. Limited number in game. Kills all things.
---
Yeah but that was only because it was way funnier for you to be a good mod than your normal self, same as Xenuria on the CSM.

Where are the injector fixes?

oof, someone sounds butthurt for some reason. I do not hunt people, lots of people complain about local on this subreddit though.
---
Man the goon downvote brigade came here in force.
---
That was only after the fact, after they were "pressured" to do so.  I'm not saying CCP didn't handle it appropriately... CCP is.
---
Maybe it's the first mothership classed ship in Eve, which they promised us around 10 years ago when motherships was renamed to super carrier
---
that would be rad
---
Fit null rat with smart bomb, problem solved.
---
Maybe alpha accounts should only get 60 hours per month to play. That's enough for 2 hours a day, more if they don't log in every day.
---
In game but not irl &lt;3 Especially not your chair my sweet dragon

or even c) that it's like a numbers station and you can 'tune out' to get a data package

I was putting a cyno in position and didn't notice until I was already scrammed. FWIW I was 2ICing that fleet and didn't want to take the engagement.

aren't you the guy that unironically made like 50 madposts about me
---
/u/jibrish innit him?
---
both sides seem to have their own downvote brigade.  The talent is to avoid posting in these threads which I have just failed at now.
---
Good luck Exo Just don't get banned ;)
---
Cool

142mil per hour, like 2 navy vexors in anoms and 2bil right on wallet. 9/10 are useless.
---
Clearly anger and belittlement is your go to so you're not worth debating with my dude.  Have a good one if you're able.
---
&gt; real mental issues (like many people do and nothing wrong with it)
---
Except the word ill itself implies something is wrong.
---
How many VNIs?
---
I'd rather shit on my hands and clap than vote for you.
---
^(nice b8 tho)
---
nice one Boris.
---
That actually makes me not want to roam anymore.
---
No

I would encourage anybody who wants to run to run. The worst thing that can happen is you win.

i got a strong Homeworld vibe from the mangled radiochatter, i feel like raiders are coming ("wait... these arent ours...")

I read that as New Moderator Addiction, and thought he went overboard with his moderating.
---
Didn't you get kicked because you threw an angry fit over your members joining other corporations via Mobile Depot advertisement?
---
A Video Game that you as a Missionary in Central  Russia should not be participating in brother. Please remember it's up to you to make it the BEST two years.
---
&gt;  and that one story where a capsuleer takes revenge on one of his crew who sabotaged his ship.
---
you have my ear citizen
---
Is for me on mobile.
---
Why would you subject yourself to such torture?
---
i need sauce for that (unless you are talking that holo tape story involving "exotic dancers in mascot gear")
---
Because they are free to do it and not serving a religious mission like you...right brother. At least that's what you told me...right?
---
haha I'll fix it
---
No it's not okay that you spend so much time not focusing on the word.
---
Please focus on the work. It's all about the work brother!!!
---
oh bob please dont let this be baot
---
No beaches for you for the next two years Elder. Please keep your focus.

The novel "Burning life" follows an NPC mission agent, they go to a gallente party and describes some...animalistic characters
---
How many times do I need to remind you to get back to work and focus on helping the people in Central Russia.
---
Cant believe noone said this yet.... \*ahem*

Detective Average Lewis is on the case!
---
its been deinig for 15 years son
---
Git gud, scrub
---
So can you quote Nephi 1:5?
---
Except that person already came forward and explained their side of the situation.
---
CCP has no need to protect them as they did nothing wrong.
---
Do have you introspective on Russian food?
---
BURN!
---
Good try mate but I haven’t left USA in over 20 years.
---
It's a freighter.
---
I’m not a big fan of the defensive neut, the firetail’s speed combined with double webs means pretty much nothing can range control you, and since you operate at the edge of scram range a meta neut does almost nothing.
---
In the event something is on top of you and you neut it, the firetail doesn’t have the cap, tank, or tracking to make use of the neut anyway.
---
Rocket launcher is the only way to go imo.
---
You always should restart launcher after DT
---
salivan pls
---
?
---
Wow, that's dedication. That raping thing sounds edgy but as long as it's only an in-game threat I guess it's fine. What does he want from you?
---
Just to add to this, if you carry RF Depleted Uranium you can easily force a slicer off you. You will track the slicer perfectly because of the range on the ammo and tracking bonus, and the slicer simply doesn’t have the cap, dps or tank to kill you before it’s forced to warp.
---
They already fit cloaks. Just delay local.
---
Who was that and why did anyone believe him?
---
This is amazing.
---
What you don't realize is that the OP just wants to rat, and shoot MTUs all day long to get rich. They don't really care about pvp.
---
Posts like this always make me chuckle, there are way more clueless nerds than i expected :)
---
What are you talking about? Is this the thing where you want skill injectors to be removed because you don't agree with what they allow players to do?
---
caldari will have a field day if a single cruise missile / auto target rocket can blow it up
---
Remember that a steady supply stream is the key to military success, therefore you shouldn't hesitate to contact your nearest Wingspan Delivery Agent. 
---
They will get you set up with a steady supply of torpedoes, at little cost to you.
---
Really? That's how you read that? You really think that your opinion of structures and the sov system is universally held? Hint: it's not. You have to actually use words to explain it.
---
Injectors that inject SP. They break the game so they must be fixed.
---
Probe safe. Bookmark. Come back an hour later and warp to safe. 
---
I've caught many targets doing exactly that.
---
Happy cake day. 
---
Am I ever going to get an apology for all the shit you talked?
---
Nut
---
Typical nerf local post.😕
---
Ya, because he's the one that was interested in doing something about it. But hey, differences of opinion are good :)
---
Leave Dimitry alone
---
Turn it off.
---
Then...
---
Turn it back on.
---
The drifter is, the structure not.
---
I too have fantasies and make shit up :P Also if you consider any of that a debate you're even stupider then I thought :| Which is a feat cause I set the bar crazy low.
---
So are you, because of your flair.

SSO logins are handled at [https://login.eveonline.com](https://login.eveonline.com)   (i.e., you click the link they give you, it takes you to that domain, you login to your eve account on a secure [eveonline.com](https://eveonline.com) subdomain, and it redirects you back to the 3rd party website).  I mean, if someone's paranoid, that's acceptable.  I'm paranoid, too.  That's why I'm making recruits jump through the hoop.  But if my prospective recruit is both paranoid and completely unaware of the very basics of how the internet works, then I don't expect them to have a good understanding of how game mechanics (which are much more complicated) actually work, either.  So it's good for that to show up right in the beginning, saves everyone a lot of time.
---
Auto-orbiting almost killed ya on Zealot
---
Ok thanks for letting us know.
---
you should probably tell that to the drunk man wearing a wizard hat.

Avery is a good man, too good for /r/Eve

Me personally I run a triple monitor setup. I just keep that trade toon up all the time. Walk by the PC and have a free min? Update the orders then walk away, play other games...wait time for next round to start in Game B? Update those orders really quick. 10 Second re-spawn? I'll update 3 orders in that time. So you;re probably right, its more that 5 mins but I can assure you the effort is beyond minimal.
---
Because Malcanis is the hero we deserve.
---
You guys really thought this through haven't you . 🤔
---
Dinnae cut yersel oan that edge
---
Iirc that would be observatories. Unfortunately, CCP also said that observatories are “on hold” for a while.
---
Shut up fuck /u/avree
---
is this comedy?
---
Eyes forward, capsuleer, the cyno is not yet lit.   
---
Consider your modules, your rigs and ammo before you undock, for the cyno is not yet lit.  
---
Break free of the station and witness the universe before you, For the cyno is not yet lit.   
---
Set your ship to fly through the vastness while you wait, For the cyno is not yet lit.   
---
Pay attention, capsuleer, for those who have gone before you call for you to join them.   
---
The cyno is now lit.
---
It is though
---
It appeals to me that the Triglavians don‘t like to post on the forums. ;)
---
I don't have a time machine.
---
If you are talking about the Mach fleet FC, yes. He could use some study and practice.
---
Arataka did it for us, don't worry. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNAr3HlRuD0
---
Karybdis Tyrannos is a Drifter not Triglavian.
---
Classy.
---
That it would dramatically affect the players you spit upon makes it in no way realistic. Personally I give no fucks either way.
---
I’m pretty sure it’s meant unironically too
---
I've been wanting to run a few times but do to military deployment and later my daughter's birth, I always passed it up. I'm finally in a position in my life to do it and have the free time to focus on it hard. 
---
I'm taking this week to take a much harder look, and talking with my Corp before I commit to this year. I love this game and have always believed in the changes and th3 light the CSM can bring. FW, NPC AI, ship balances and citadels being the main things I would be focused on seeing real improvements with.
---
That's not what "fix" means. "Fixing" something means repairing it and keeping it in service. You want them removed. Big difference.
---
I personally don't understand why scientists are spending so much research time on stuff like cold fusion.
---
Why not just harness the power of this spin?
---
Translate? How
---
u still read this subreddit bluemajere??
---
Bruh it's clearly bait, i mean come on.
---
I have 300 vnis on market buy them please.
---
I think they did, I also think the next CSM wants to improve it, and the one after that. The point I was trying to make was I'm not letting one incident stop me
---
I don't see how it would spit on anyone other than botters and players who do not engage in more than 'Warp to site, Orbit at 50km'. Wormholers have been making ISK the way that is suggested for years now. I'm guessing you're saying that wormholers have been shit on this whole time?
---
You realise botters are using Alpha accounts while cloaky campers take Plex right?
---
Controversial.
---
I like it.
---
I made one semi-ironic trollpost while belligerently drunk that got a lot of traction.
---
Aside from that post I just called you an idiot a lot. Because you are.
---
dose the sound, sound like compressed audio to anyone else?
---
I doubt CCP envisioned them being used in the way they currently are. Most game logs are simply used for referencing a past event, not active intel gathering. I'm sure when they started being used as such CCP was probably somewhat impressed at the inovativeness and allowed it, but I think it's more detrimental to gameplay at this point as it's being used to keep lawless spacew way safer than it should be. that's just my opinion of course. CCP makes the rules in this sandbox.
---
Penif is not retarded and doesnt blog about it thou
---
It's been done now by Annisir. But using https://www.artstation.com/artwork/QdKO8
---
and of course he had no come back on that. good job
---
In classic high sec fashion, the high sec members were disorganized and all had different visions for highsec. The choir of voices drowned out any good ideas. What goons have going for them is that their representatives are united with common goals they want to achieve for their organization
---
gila is 230m just for hull
---
can CCP just pay to Squizz
---
Idk what a "reddit birthday" is, but it's been a week since my own bday. Thanks tho!
---
From my perspective, I can stand behind the shit I talked. The community swings back and forth at the extremes. Rush to the guillotine when CCP decides one way and "total exoneration" when CCP decides the other way. I carefully do so even when I shittalk. Here are the 2 things I said.
---
1) In very early days I thought it was the leak of anom changes and Init/Bastion etc. adapting their space. I did an "I told you so" on reddit. I was wrong. But it doesn't warrant an apology. I still think Imperium/TEST landscape decisions are made using CSM info. As I always said, I'm OK with it as this is one of those "race to the bottom" things which everyone does (e.g. how PL invaded NPC citadel land) and CCP can't do much about it.
---
2) After the CCP unban, I said that you being a high profile person who can claim damages motivated CCP to take a second look at your case. Almost no CCP decision about a player's fate had to be court-proof, but you had that privilege. It's still true.
---
I also argued that you might still as well be guilty but it's just the case that CCP doesn't have court-proof evidence. Which is also still true. At the end of the day nothing changes the fact that a Molok was sold right before it got nerfed. CCP saw the transaction and banned you, then realized they can't win a court case and unbanned you. From my perspective, there is no additional reason to trust you didn't leak the info before the titan was sold.
---
Only thing I miss from the official CCP tourney is the commentator's name card at the start. Aside from that, fantastic match, loved the dual angles.
---
Next video when?
---
Eat bacon and scroll.

Eat bacon... and scroll.
---
Literally zkill is more stable than eve chat server and has better U.I than eve itself lol
---
We dont say others are spreading misinformation in the media. We call em fake news.
---
That statement just makes no sense. the last year and a half have been very kind to highsec
---
God bless this post
---
overview settings window &gt;ships tab &gt;check box for "hide corp ticker if pilot is in Alliance"
---
you must be a very good programmer
---
So how many "failed" CSMs would you need before concluding it doesnt work?
