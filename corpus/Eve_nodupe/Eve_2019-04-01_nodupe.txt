Come on, link your lossmail.

The fact you don't know shit about the game ? Because you seem like someone lock in Nullsec meta from 5+ years, buddy, time change, I know you did not but you have to adapt... or join WH since it's where you won't see super umbrella or stupid blob 
---
Leave highsec
---
Yeah it was impressive to see the impel army move shit in. If people had to do this in C5 space again I'd assume freighters/jump freighters would speed up the process. Not a hauler person though so I'm sure someone might say otherwise.
---
Maybe hold on and see how bad the coming "reeeeeeeeee Nerf fighters/supers/HAW" is and then decide.   
---

---
It would be nice if CCP added some capital/supercap PvE content instead of just nerfing the ability of caps and supers to PvE.  
---
Sure, you want to balance caps/subs but it could you throw cap pilots a bone?
---
Very nice. What's the song?
---
This is a straight dumb idea.  The goal of a sandbox game is to be in the same world With other people.   This idea is retarded and takes people out of the sandbox.  You're splitting the player base.  It's a dumb idea and you should delete this post.

Lol 10/10 uncle dunk post

dang why so salty???

LMAO!!!! XiX declares war to Frat...bathphones TEST for every engagement they start.... poor russians

yep...Legacy needed 3 fleets of eagles + titan sup, supers and fax machines.....to fight the 150 Elo fleet lol...when you have a 600+ man fleet chasing a 150 man fleet and still got away.....
---
I like how most of them are actually TAPI victories, not FI.RE victories.
---
Getting 2 LR phoenixes in to pause the fort would have been a problem?
---
You guys struggled hard in that video and you know we would have derailed that sloppy attempt with a hand full of dudes :D
---
You dont need mass caps either... could have done it with 2 muninns fleets or feroxes or anything ezpz really
---
The first talk about it was a year before and the test freighter was brought in soon after. Most of seeding was done in the last few months before the op (5 or so) and we were busy with other stuff alliance wise unless you didnt notice the massive war going on.
---
And why are people comparing a single fort kill against a group that small to 2 Keepstar kills against the biggest wh group and possibly the rest of wh space again?

---
Enjoyable video, awesome taste in music
---
lol no l like it because it triggers so many people
---
Is it just me or does this look like they almost lost it. Was much closer than what i expected and read in that other post. Why didn't they warp in front of them or boosh after them to kill their booshers?
---
you wouldnt say this in d-p

Ive watched a lot of your eve stuff

Not your best.. this intro is pretty bad lol.

It's definately best to join a corporation and get some other dudes to fly around with. We at [Dreddit](https://dredditisrecruiting.com) are newbie-friendly and pretty chill, and if you want some extra help we have a mentor's program with top men leading it.
---
Feel free to PM me if you're interested.
---
So this is pretty cherry-picked tbh. I don't have a dog in this race because both groups (FI.RE and WinterCo) not only ignore botting but have encouraged it in the past, so I dislike both of them on principle. 
---
What remains of the DRF is borderline useless, just as they were in the last war that they were in where they sat the fence for 2 months and then decided to impotently feed like morons for the remaining duration, or not even contest timers, and whatever remains of the RMC pretending that they weren't trying really hard to back groups that were hitting Legacy a year ago, yet batphoning them to come save them during any major engagement. If you guys wind up taking space in the East again from FRT we'll just be setting ourselves up for DRF 3.0 (Except TEST will be the only reason you took the space) with likely another White Noise schism in the near future because you motherfuckers can't play nice with each other for more than a few months before The Russian Revolution reenactments.
---
Damn the first one looks amazing. If i went into a coma for a few months and after waking up someone told me that ship was added into the game i would 100% believe them.

Well, look who’s mad now.  I simply stated that I thought the overuse of a certain word was indicative of stupidity.  It is.  The fact you got so butt hurt over it is an indication that I have struck a nerve with you.  I never insulted an entire generation and do not intend to respond to your warped understanding of this world and how it works.
---
But, by all means, continue to use unironically as often as you wish...the next time someone tells you to quit using that overused word, please remember me and how I warned you about looking stupid.
---
For the record you did anything but “disect” (hell autocorrect fixed it for me and I had to unfix it to show your lack of intelligence) my second comment as it was hardly worth any dissection at all.  As for my reference to your generation and the entertainment value you provide the world, look no further than your last post lol.

Nice brain pretzel btw.

If you want to minmax ISK then you're on the right track.
---
If not roll a D20 idk. At least it's more fun.
---
Oh god you even have a status page. I love you
---
As I posted 8 hours ago in another post with pretty much exactly the same question: "I find helping newbros more satisfying than playing the actual game nowadays, so if you want me to fly with you for a few hours hit me up. I'm in a US time zone, but I can accommodate."
---
Well of course do you happen to have a discord?
---
We are comparing the two situations because someone in the parent comment of mine had brought it up.
---
5 months or so is still a very long time to seed that many ravens considering you could have built them in less than a day with the logistics power most null blocs. Like it or not you were very inefficient and will be made fun of for using that inefficiency to spice up your narrative.
---
All coalition kills are ours, all losses belong to individual pilots! /s
---
"we just take her" ummm ok......
---
took us 10 hours into a c2 
---
They just get TEST in who has to fail boson/lance 40+ times to kill 1 group of pesky bois
---
Well looking at your killboard sweetheart if a better man like Vile Rat was still around he could have explained how trading rookie ship kills for BS losses was not necessarily a good thing!
---
Well, there’s your problem...adjective.  English much?
---
How’s smegma taste?
---
It's not it's own disease but a symptom of Spinner's Wrist. The pilot spends increasing amounts of time spinning their ships in station. Symptoms include:
---
* Lack of isk due to never undocking to make any
---
* Constantly buying new ships to lock an, none of which they end up actually flying.
---
* Complaining that SKINs are too expensive
---
* Repetitive use injuries in the preferred mouse hand
---
End state:
---
* Pilot forgets Eve isn't a ship collecting game
---
It's cute that some people still believe brexit will actually happen, bless yall hearts.

Consider moving to a wormhole, either find a group to run with or do it yourself / with a friend or two. (screw anyone who says it cannot be done solo, definetly can be) 
---
Wormhole life offers you a dynamic source of content, one day you might be rolling your holes because there's an ore field and you have an itch to mine, next day there could be a WH that leads to some very traffic heavy null/lowsec and you whip out your pvp ships to catch some kills. Third day you notice you have a bunch of sleeper sites piled up, go run those. Next you realise you have a decent hisec connection, logistics time! And the list just goes on and on.
---
 Wormhole life, especially with a small friend group is the best content that EVE has to offer, atleast in my opinion. I made the move once and never looked back. 
---
Yeah I'm down to about 120m and all I have for ISK generation is a high sec incursion maelstrom..... 
---
Probably until drones/fighters use actual ammo

Thanks!

 [Warp To Me](https://forums.warptome.net/topic/301-rookie-guide/) is a good place to start; it's a shield incursion community. There's also [The Ditanian Fleet](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/the-ditanian-fleet-incursion-community/114885)  if armor is your flavor of choice, but from what I can tell the shield incursion communities are a bit larger. I think WTM usually has a fleet going in EUTZ, can't speak to TDF.
---
its nice to see tributes in game communities, but they shouldn't be limited to only "important people"
---
Step 1: Realize the game has gone to shit and will never get back to the same level of entertainment that it was when you first started.
---
Step 2: Cry
---
Step 3: ???
---
Step 4: Quit
---
Yeah it kinda spiraled down, less fcs&gt;less member&gt;less fcs &gt; less members and so on...
---
It sometimes took hours to get an HQ fleet up, up to the point where we could only form in eu prime, and then even that died. 
---
I guess the "buff" to nullsec income did us in aswell, as a minmax oriented group members went to super rat or rorq multibox 
---
Shooting blues... Are you in TIKLE? 
---
AFAIK Everyone person in every alliance who is on Reddit commiserates and salutes each other when ANY RL person dies.

It's just the way we've always done things!

I'm actually trying to min-max for mineral distribution, so I don't have to import so much (compressed) ore for construction projects.
---
Though, tbh, an earthworm which had had a stroke could do a better job than many of the politicians in Westminster.
---
(There are a few decent people amongst them. Just not that many)
---
Lmao. Seriously though you probably should just give it a rest. It was not your place to insult a person's intelligence based on your view of a "overused" word. I made a spelling mistake yes. Ok so how does the reflect in any manner a persons intellect. It does not actually. Furthermore I am in no way "butt hurt". I just really really enjoyed making you look like a fool. It was the arrogance and the petty nature you displayed that really kinda makes you look just a little tiny bit pathetic lol. Honestly though we can take shots at each other. I find it a bit humorous. DM me if that is what you want actually. You will become angry however. Honestly speaking I have already made my point. Any more would be a waste of energy and time on an idiot.
---
Still though if actually want a fight please DM me. Me and my roommate have been bored as fuck and your pathetic stupidity looks tasty. 😝
---
Like really tasty. Please DM me. I want to have fun. It is too bad I can not meet you in person. As tasty as you seem I know I could never resist a bite.
---
While having two accounts certainly isn't neccecary it does give you more freedom to pvp to your heart's content on one account while using the other to keep the isk flowing.
---
For ISK there's a few alternatives and none of them mutually exclusive. Personally I combine station trading, PI and the occasional abyss. You can also go with incursions, and there are a few public groups for that, with Warp To Me being a shield-based group. I usually run my abyssals, trading and PI as near as possible to one another, traveling far to get your PI outputs are unneccecary. Plan it all out beforehand - very important!
---
Another reason to have one account for pvp and one for pve are kill rights. Have one activated on you as you're hauling ships about or when you're in your abyssal cruiser and you're in for a ride and then a dive economically. 
---
And lastly you don't need to keep grinding sec status if you have some character still able to provide logistics to the other. 
---
The latter two points are relevant for low sec, not null and wormholes.
---
You're missing the point. When Britain leaves Europe, well, unless the cables have a lot of slack in them, they'll snap.
---
Then theres the fact theres a copy of the data in Iceland, which isn't part of the EU anyway. 
---
I was hoping for a pyfa warrior one.
---
Sane is the problem.
---
The "U" is silent.
---
What about that FRT WH exit strategy cleared out? 
---
You had 5 omega accounts?
---
Close 4, take the money you saved, sell some PLEX for the same $, boom. You have PVP money now.
---
Form2 tho

Doesn't help they catered to the most prolific FCs who just so happened to be raging idiots.

Glad they are dead tbh.

I am in no way angry about a thing, just munching popcorn as I observe the personal attacks as you pay no attention to the actual point.  You see, the way your kind does it is by first attacking the disagreeable thing (that being me) because you cannot handle being told you are wrong about something.  That usually occurs with a slew of names thrown at the offender followed by threats and further insults.  This is the perfect demonstration of my point.  You’re stupid and it’s on display at every turn.  Thank you for the entertainment my friend, my work is done here.
---
Who do you have in mind? I think i never had a problem with someone there

Your site is fantastic and incredibly useful.  Thanks for all the work you put into it!

you almost failed and all you did is kill a fort...
---
Rick for one
---
Some good advice you need to hear: look up Belt Driven Industries in corporations.   We got the solution to your problem.
---
Form2 is a great printer but like other SLAs, you're very limited in capability, extremely expensive, and in the case of formlabs, problematic support and parts availability.
---
A thrust pressure switcg would be amazing for eve. 
---
Then you could have pedals or a joystick for manual piloting.
---
There is certainly a place for nice people. You just have to surround yourself with other nice people. Literally. You know, like how herd animals gather up in a group so it's harder for the circling predators to get at them. There are lots of friendly corps and alliances. And if you're super duper lucky, maybe they're Blue with enough of the neighbors that you can wander out a bit and not get shot on sight.
---
I did not actually do those things until the last comment. And no threats here. Just saying I am having the time of my life. You are doing exactly want I want you to do. It is textbook really. You refuse to be wrong and as I am having fun I provoke you and you reply more and more giving me more fun to be had. You see If I where to say you would not DM me followed by a insult or a reason that you would find absurd or dislike,  you would probably DM me almost immediately after you get the notification. If you are not lurking the thread that is. I would give it a say 86% chance that you would. That would give me the icing, the cake, and a cherry 🍒 on top to have fun no holds bared with you. Please continue to make yourself look like a fool. I can say you won't reply anymore. You can't. You don't have it in you.
---
If he was to join goons he’s better off joining one of the other corps, waiting 2-3 weeks in chat hoping to get picked next just to join won’t be an enjoyable experience for a newbro tbh.
---
I would argue that there are more actually nice people than bad ones. Most of the EVE players I know pretty well would never yell at anybody, ever. Try looking for groups (ideally smaller groups, so you can really get to know people) and if they're mostly assholes, move on.
---
What happened to me was that I dragged the nice ones out of the toxic group, who crumbled, and into an actually decent group.
---
If there were no ways to track deaths in eve pvp would be more common.
---
Squizz and his counterparts have hurt the game, change my mind.
---
This, but look into joining a group of decent people as the same time.
---
Skill Injection is the only way to go. If you wait for the training to finish, the ships you want to fly will be Nerfed to heck. #SpeakingFromExperience
---
What if hostiles actually take hole control and prevent that from happening?
---
Bringing the materials in would have been a pain but okay within the initial surprise phase but it would also mean we would have to wait 24h for the first reff + the time it takes to build the ravens + the time it takes to get stuff sorted and what if the raitaru gets reffed? Dont forget that when we first started planning we didn't know for sure what numbers we would have initially and if we would bring any friends along. That option just seemed very risky to us and we wanted to make maximum use of the first day and get the first timer in the books asap and lower the risk (time for you to rageroll) for the second timer which is the most important one. Hope that makes more sense.
---
i dont know a better one. we did the same as you, btw also spod/arkonor and one bistot/crokite
---
We can all agree that fathoms and leagues would be the correct unit of distance in Eve
---
How's the fuel economy?
---
If you're the sort to care about kb stats you'd find a reason not to pvp anyway 
---
Unlike the PVP powerhouse that is CVA, who never call on Legacy's support, and are always standing strong in the face of attacking hordes. Especially the ones from the south
---
Did you see the alliance tag?
---
Valhalla, Niftel, Heaven, Hell, Rai, Ad, Nether, Underworld, Aid's Kingdom, Higher Planes, Better Place, Mitclan, Limbo, Duat, Caleuche, even Reincarnation and many more, the choice of final resting pla... errr, destinations is staggering.
---
Ouch.  Sounds like you're punching above your paygrade.
---
Eh focus on Gneiss imo (because of the mexallon bottleneck) and import the rest cheap, get contacts or access to delve.
---
Have no idea what OP talking about the only mean people I ever met in this game is 0.0 sec , gankers and player pirates.
---
When you can't regulate your spodahol intake.
---
People are nice, it's just that most people are losers in real life so they all act tough because it's a video game.
---
There are alliances with a high % of nice people though. I-RED in syndicate is one I know and recommend. I think rote kapelle might be also.
---
There's plenty of friendly people in Eve, if the people you've played with are toxic then move locations and join a different corp.
---
But agree with the poster above, Karmafleet is not a great experience. There's several better options in Imperium and many better options in other alliances.
---
And what, exactly, stops you from using your own boosh to get on top of the enemy fleet? They have 21 booshes? You bring 22. Probably wouldn't even need that many. You could just sit on your undock, wait for a good opportunity, and boosh on top of them. If it fails, boosh back to safety and try again.
---
Eat ass and fly fast
---
Could always make a pivot table and make your ores filterable and find the combination you like best.  I mean it's basically what you are doing but partly automated.

Water, you have to be properly hydrated to be elite. Sustain your needs for calories via meditation.
---
We also had over a thousand more ships in fleets than they did. 
---
I am hoping someone can give me an answer. A friend recommended ISBoxer to multi-box my miners. Looking into it, I was very confused by the google searches. Most were old and they did not contain a clear-cut answer on whether it is legal to use. 
---
I am not looking to press one button and have all accounts do the same thing. I was told that it made it easier to cycle to the different accounts and it eased up the resource drain on the computer. I do not want to mess with it if it will get me banned, just looking for a more efficient way than alt-tab. Any links to anything official would be greatly appreciated.
---
The question is, what’s CCP’s April fools joke, and is it gonna be funny?
---
I've rarely encountered rude or overly mean people in EVE, even right after getting toasted by them.Heck, many of my better EVE buddies destroyed one of my ships once upon a time.  
---
What you need to remember is that Corporation/Alliancess are teams, and fleets are combinations of everything that want to murder stuff, complete a task, or both, and may span multiple corps/alliances.  
---
If you aren't on their team or working with them, expect them to screw you over at every turn, every time, and you will find it happens -most- of the time.   
---
You don't -need- a team to do well, but it makes the startup a LOT better if you join the right group. You don't have to, but the learning process is a lot less painful.  
---
  
---
what ships do these look like from 40k? 1 MIGHT be a dark eldar looking thing if you really stretch... 2nd one kinda looks like old imperium actually.
---
But the others don't look anything like 40k ships that i've seen.
---
Then write one yourself!

Be the change you wish to see in the world.

EVE-Scout is an awesome group of dudes who avoid fighting at all costs and make bank being friendly and hunting down exploration sites. +1 for these guys

It's fine to use ISBoxer as a window manager tool and to input commands into a single client at a time. It's by far the best tool for the job of managing numerous clients. From what I've read, ISBoxer will actually warn you before you enable the input broadcasting feature that is forbidden.

He was my wing leader way back when, spent quite a few nights in (was it) teamspeak being told what to align to and when to warp and what not.   I was gutted when I heard the news break.

Almost all the people I've met who trash talk Eve on the basis that its players are jerks (for example, on the Star Citizen forums) are just pvp-averse, and can't understand the concept that blowing you up is NOT mean. Telling people that "it's not mean, if they can't accept that, Eve may not be for them" is not elitist.
---
Not saying this is you, but it has the bouquet of many of the arguments and veiled complaints I (and I suspect many here) have heard a ton of times.

I lose ships maybe every 1-2 weeks (that's not a lot).
---
I actively pvp.
---
I also do pve.
---
I do mining, planetary interaction, ratting, exploration sites, manufacturing, trading, and hauling.
---
I do HAW dread baiting, wormhole camping, nullsec roams, and miner ganking (in w-space).
---
There's so much to do in Eve, against players and against the AI.
---
There's also so many groups in Eve of different kinds, from different places, from different worldviews. Eve's community is not heterogenous by any stretch.
---
As a general rule in life, if you move from place to place, job to job, relationship to relationship, and you are unable to get along with people, you may need to look inside.
---
The people I meet in EVE who claim to be nice are seldom so. When I blow up their ships they tell me to drink bleach, wish cancer on my loved ones, and hurl the foulest of racial epithets. Most of them are miner/industrialists in highsec. Even if this does not describe you, it does describes the sort of company you will be keeping if you take up with pacifist carebears.
---
The truly good people I meet are well-adjusted enough to enjoy all aspects of the game, especially the PvP. In fact, PvP is the primary focus of the game so if you don't like it you're virtually certain to be annoyed quite often.
---
No doubt others will jump in to reassure you that it is possible to go against the grain and sustain an enjoyable farming lifestyle. But in my experience if you really want to get the best out of EVE, you need to "lose your morality and embrace your immortality." Role-playing the villain is indescribably exhilarating, because it's something you never get to do IRL.
---
great mate because ccp doesnt cease and desist you, they despise people doing anything with their ip
---
If you’re super keen on PvP you can live a frugal scavenger life. Use your 120 mil to buy cheap PvP ships like t1 frigates and move down to a lowsec FW zone. PvP to your hearts content but watch out for when big fights happen, it will be tough at first but once you get to know the locals it’s easier. Loot these big fights with either a Sunesis (for small loot) a Wreathe (a cheap option that can still loot 1 cap mod per warp in) or a Mastodon for the ultimate ninja looter. 
---
Once you get good you can comfortably fund most lowsec PvP shenanigans.
---
Note: this will definitely not be enough to plex accounts. I use real money for my subs
---
yes \*hug*
---
Karmafleet rules!
---
Most groups have discord or similar place to chat and ask questions before joining.  It’s a good idea to chat for a bit talk about Eve and not Eve stuff just to see if you like the general feeling of the corp and if they think you would fit in well too.  Look at r/evejobs and chat up a few of them.  What makes Eve awesome is who you play with not what you do or even where.  Treat looking for a corp like a mix of a job interview and a dating app. 
---
Great video

Are you blitzing those level 4 properly?

Jesus Christ, do people actually believe this? As someone who has been fcing in some capacity and running a corp for over 10 years, I have not once ever been like "Oh, I can't take this fight, think of the kbstat!" or "You have to stop feeding if you're in my corp, the kb is too red!"

This

Haha me

&gt; That leaves unique hardware identifiers, but those can also be very easily reset and spoofed, hell I have all that shit disabled starting from my router through every device I have, except my phone which I never connect to my hardwired internet ISP, keep it on its own network at all times.
---
Cool story bro. But as a software developer, I can tell you, you're full of shit. Your router can't block hardware id because the hardware id has nothing to do with your router. It's a combination of your motherboard's serial number, etc.
---
But you keep telling yourself how secure you are because you did some shit in your router that you didn't understand.
---
LMAO, thanks for making my night. 
---
How do you pay for an alt like that? Do you just sink the IRL cost or is there some magical method of plexing two accounts I haven't heard of yet?
---
&gt;This voltron of the special ed class flexed their lats on 35 real players 
---
Dude, jita doesn't even get burned that hard
---
So you consider infiltrating hosa to build/steal 2 dreads or hold hole control for a extended period to build them after hole control is established less work then getting a bunch of t1 BSs...I hope u understand what c2 means.
---
Surely u would wreck us. We had no experience running these boosh bs. Glad about that.
---
2 muninn or ferox fleets? God pando...Why do I even talk to you. For a proper comp these 180 toons on the final fort killmail get down to 100-120. These numbers already include additional help by other groups that were called mid eviction seeing the certain groups trying to help hosa afaik. Who would have guessed eutz timers are bad for most wh groups
---
I think that stat has been a running joke anyway
---
Why would anyone ever let Theran Alliance speak for them and why would anyone ever answer a batphone from them lol

Some of the old school indy alliances wrote their own custom ERP software for moon management. So in short, no. There's not really a better way

They contested the armor timer instead of hull with a small ball of carriers. Wasn't very eventful either.
---
Sitting here looking at 17b and feeling poor as fuck. 
---
How do you only have 1 hours ratting income to your name?
---
I can regulate the intake just fine. It's the output from the refinery that can get out of control at random...
---
it's raw; I was listening to that during the fight. but thank you for the compliment ))
---
An even better choice, then.
---
If you're a sov bloc and your reputation is that bad then I don't have sympathy for you. Victory by numbers and nothing else is not a victory anyone will honor.
---
Snuffed can club away. Besides, these are the kind of fights Snuffed *should* be taking, rather than punching down against far smaller and more helpless groups in lowsec.
---
&gt; seemed very risky to us and we wanted to make maximum use of the first day and get the first timer in the books asap and lower the risk
---
Lot of words to say that you might lose with the largest coalition in the game against some wormholers
---
Freighters are inefficient so no, if anything you'd jf it to the entry system then dst army it. 
---
Same way we did it. Prioritized what we needed and price of individual mins in case we had to buy to supplement for big projects. And trit. Always trit.

&gt; D-Scanning like crazy 
---
If it's not 6/10 and i don't have to kill triggers, i simply alt tab and wait for drones to get my stuff, doesn't matter who is in system most of the times.
---
Besides, if you are getting hunted by a proper hunter you have to spam D-scan every 6 seconds, overwise you will miss probes and if you missed them, D-scan won't save you from Lachesis.

There is other way to do it 100% safely.

He was killed in the 2012 attack on the US embassy in Benghazi, Libya.

Funny thing Theran left Winter Co to have less PVP. They were offered to join FRT in Detorid for better protection/fleets/FCs.
---
Rorqs get a 100% penalty to shield booster amount and panic doesn't work
---
I'm pretty sure Canes were their doctrine for a long time. Thing is they dont have a good enough FC to herd those cats. The only one i remember decently flying them was Viper08? of Viper's bastards, but he left for RAZOR with his corpies to have quality pew-pews and more pew-pew minded people.

Ew

What are the ticks. In previous vid where you didnt post fit/imps you were claiming 50-60 m/tick were achievable.
---
Abyssal gyrostabs? Im pretty sure you can push 1800 easily if you get a good roll
---
Would like to know where OP is from and if he/she has ever travelled?
---
Nice performative morals
---
If by strategic assets you mean almost 200 capitals, you're right. 
---
What's up with the dreads.. 
---
To be honest, I'm surprised they needed that many dreads to kill that shitfit. 
---
I am posting this because I have been ordered a public hazing
---
Then why talk so hard shit lmao. I dont understand it. Just be like well shit here we go lets fucn brawl m8
---
Are crystal implants becoming armor rep bonus??
---
Stainguy is an idiot.

He has his settings set up to disallow conversation requests and whatnot.
---
Source: I do this on all my alts
---
they never cared for pvp to begin with, they have always been a full on carebear alliance
---
I think I lost a few IQ points reading this
---
No joke, scotch makes my solo pvp on point. 
---
Its not really shit fit. Just a ratting carrier I brought to kill some subs.
---
Theran alliance talking shit then getting stomped, thats quite literally all they do because theyre tradh.
---
Vile Rat was 'as important' as anyone else in the entire EVE community and the fact that he lost his life in service to the USA is equally tragic and heroic. His family and friends and his fellow gamers miss him. There should be no real limitation on anyone's individual ability to honor the fallen people that touched the livelihood of both digital or RL communities in their sphere of influence. This is /r/Eve
---
Also rorqs can no longer mine, instead they create moon rocks 😂
---
No, it really is shitfit.
---
Both for PvP and PvE.
---
That fit is bad and you should feel bad.
---
It's a tough job. But somebody has got to do it. 
---
The ruskis are savages tho, some Red guys dropped 2 dreads in the middle of frat space close to their staging, 0 fucks given... These guys are deffo having fun no matter what
---
You were the one who started being a complete dick head to everyone, which is why I even said anything to you in the first place. You weren't "just asking for help" read your own comments idiot. 
---
You are a Goon, you tell me
---
This is why I’m not gonna bother with carriers or titans, it’s either gonna gather space dust in my hangar or I’m gonna go for a piss as I usually do and leave it in mid space.
---
Alrighty then, that fit was pure garbage. Whoever came up with that should be forbidden from flying carriers until he can explain what's wrong. 
---
What was their joke?
---
There was once I thought I didn’t like snuff because poor lowsec etc and that evil animal m0ther killed my wee astra with his tittie...but recently they kill all the people I actually hate so now life no longer makes sense...snuff are kinda awesome?? 
---
What’s genesis all about these days? 
---
i did it the same way, since wspace only lets you get the shit moongoo i went based off celestes dot de and which ore gives you the most isk for your time so: dazzling spurdo and brilliant gneiss, try to get the most amount of those and everything else is just secondary 
---
The guy died long before I ever even thought about playing eve, but I can commiserate with those who did know him. It's ok to open up sometimes

Why did you feel the need to post on reddit.

I remember speaking to his wife the night Sean died. I remember how much she hated us for taking up all his time, and how she also had no one else to turn to. And how I had nothing to offer her as a balm to her soul.

I remember Sean.

Mostly SFAQL.

Sounds like fun :)

AAR: We’re a corp of 7 small gangers (recruiting btw) that recently moved in next to Talentless Derpstruction’s lowsec home. After they fed up some Kikimoras they were salty that we didn’t want to replace them and shot our Astra, but didn’t show for the armor timer. Then they did this again and after this second blueball, we were very disappointed so we started to shoot their stick with that shitfit niddy in it in Ravens. They fed an untackled confessor to the ravens but otherwise didn’t react much until we exchanged the ravens for a thanny. That apparently got their attention and we finally got a fight. Expecting a drop that we can’t take alone (7 small-gangers) we invited our friends from cruisers crew who gladly came along for the fun. 
---

---
As a reward we have a third armor timer tonight, with all of horde pinged to “burn todi” even though the CEO is “pretty confident that he could solo our entire corp plus whatever we bring as backup”. We’re confused but also excited. This is eve, I guess. 
---
Excellent video, really love how you set up the music.
---
Great rundown man thanks. I suppose I will delay the Precursor ships and focus on a VNI or Gila for now despite how boring they are since I already have Gallente Cruiser V, but I will definitely go for a Vedmak long term.
---
Can someone explain to me why GOTG is so bad?
---
-250,000 skillpoints for all omega accounts who log in on April 1st. The skillpoints are taken from spaceship command skill.

To remediate everyone either a) buys injectors, b) spends a week training the skill / using spare points.

Happy April.

a large group of Theran Alliance pilots is forming up. their FC gets a message. "20 Snuff are better than 100 of Theran guys."
---
The FC quickly commands 100 of his best pilots to warp to zero and a battle commences. Fighting continues fiercely for ten minutes, the battle coms raging, then silence. The FC gets new message. "20 Snuff are better than 250 Theran and their allies."
---
Furious, the Theran FC forms a full fleet of 255 and commands them to fly into battle. Again the mumble fleet channel coms fills with the noise of battle. After ten minutes of battle, again silence. Another message to the FC arrives. "20 Snuff is better than 800 of you and whoever you bat-phoned!"
---
Enraged the FC sends wave after wave of his ships into the grinder. Everything he can muster into the battle. Furious sounds of battle ensue. the global mumble channel filled with calls of primaries and requests for reps. 
---
Then silence.
---
Eventually one scout, badly shot up but still on grid keys up. "Dont send any more pilots... it's a trap. There is 40 of them.
---
They used a titan to bridge in, so technically this is still true 
---
It's a pretty standard fit for blitzing L5 missions
---
Fuck that hurts just thinking about. I imagine my wife would react the same way. 
---
How did he attain legendary status?

hey retard, when you actually don't know what the fuck you're talking about, don't be so stubborn
---
Erotic Role Playing software for moon mining? I'm not sure how that would help but kudos to them for the right attitude.
---
the jumps per hour are pretty fucking aids according to dotlan. 
---
This is a pretty weighty cruiser gang imma give you that
---
Whaaaa?
---
Ah ( It’s not a region I’ve ever had a reason to go to tbh. 
---
Lol, I have lost smart bombing Machariels that are more expensive than your carrier by 2 fold.
---
Why don't I ever find people like this...
---
Join some big nullsec group that protects miners. Learn how to make big isk. It's too much effort to try to make everything yourself.
---
I used to do a lot of migration ops with our corp, I always wanted to find hot spots of low sec but genesis was never an option. Literally solitude and aridia had more jumps than genesis some times. It's really gross.
---
Christ, Solitude &gt; Genesis sounds like it’s a shithole )) 
---
Cyno up!

If people want passive income with multiboxing, they can use their hulks and mackinaws like they've done for literally a decade +. I'm happier than ever that the cancerqal is dying.
---
no it was a real post but l lost interest with it, and went back to mining ;) but it did get a few people to rage and my job is done for now
---
From what I've seen, apparently they decided to run incursions in delve instead of high sec.
---
Is running C4 abyssal sites still a good method of income?
---
What is the safest ship+fit to run them in?
---
I can run all pirate cruisers + amarr&amp;caldari HACs
---
Except for today.
---
I spent 4 hours running throw about two dozen WH, and im guessing each one was picked clean by them.
---
Basing that based on the EvE-Scout cans in the WH...
---
1 site in 4 hours for 20m... 
---
Today they get -1 from me. They can get their +1 back tomorrow lol
---
Given that UK Parliament voted 4th time for hard brexit, i doubt they will keep any law from EU after that, they will have their hands full with more intense problems (i.e., economy and stuff). Some car manufacturers already announced they will shift production to other EU country. Nobody wants to do business in these conditions (political instability and uncertainty). Frankfurt also has strong datacenters and connectivity, France the same (Blizzard has some things in France)
---
So you killed Hurricanes + Scythe's with Slaved Machariels + Apostole's + Rev's. It is an expected outcome.

This guy Sgeine Ambraelle trully is something else.

https://imgur.com/a/nn13jJN   This is what he sent me after I politely asked his "main diplo" if I can put an alt in Theran to watch bots in Wicked Creek (the diplo said Theran is strictly against botting). 
---
https://imgur.com/a/JlaKN5s     Here he is trying to suck some dyno dick after being kicked out of Wicked Creek by Frat for being a complete piece of shit. 
---
Theran alliance boys if you are reading this RUN. Theran is NOT a newbie friendly alliance. It's a thinly veiled scam by some people with big egos. Just go to Horde/Brave/Karma literally any other place will be better than paying taxes to this douche nozzle. 
---
Second this
---
If you’re ratting with this, swap
---
The drone navs for tank, remove the SB and neut for FSU’s you can keep the hypers and mwd to get faster ticks (I guess you’re done reloading fighters before landing somehow) other than that. Standard fit
---
because they don't bother trying not to be
---
LMAO
---
The doc is old, but still sound from my testing. Thats a little sad tbh since the content hasnt really changed enough in the last almost 3 years to invalidate 95% of the doc.
---
That said i think running lv4 abyssals will net you close to the same but the risks are a bit higher (losing a pod)
---
Very good video. Nice editing skills
---
Is there a post that your not projecting your salty-ness on this weekend? Feeding hand in hand with your chinky bot brothers taking its toll? Might be worth taking a walk brother, have a wank or a twinkie

If I had to ping to take on 5 dudes I'd be just as trash as you guys
---
oh sftu, "Creeping Bittervetism" is real and im patient zero. ill never be not-undocking and eve's golden years were 2006-2008, never to return again. game's dead
---
Have to update my coverage. Do these count as preexisting conditions?
---
Cruisers Crew still alive? I'm happy to hear.
---
Why have a separate external tool for something that can be added in game with zero downside?
---
Much confidence in this one. The actual AAR is that we did a fail drop with like 4 dudes trying to catch a thani bashing our pos. They batphoned Shoot first and thus is the result. If you call 4 dudes burning all of horde than you win lol.
---
If I remember correctly, rumor was that some ships were stored in a corp hanger and that a few accounts had access that didn't get banned. Don't know the truth of it but it would be smart to do so. 
---
I wouldnt say its completely shitfit lol
---
I agree with everything you said, besides putting heroic and USA in the same sentence
---
As the vile nation is responsible for many of my own relatives death due to striking civilian targets (2 of my living relatives are currently dying from cancer that came from USA using DU ammo in residential area)
---
&gt; They Batphoned GotG.
---
I see where they went wrong. 
---
Jokes aside, looks like a fun fight.
---
Yep
---
you are correct about everything there and i had those refits but at the time i just didnt fit them lol
---
its not that bad. Not like a better fit would have saved me lol
---
Talk shit, get hit.
---
Could you say they were a cruiser crew
---
looks like it
---
Agreed. 
---
I hate having to bounce between alts to find the note as to why Random Dude is red to the corp, so a 'corp notes' tab as well as the current 'personal notes' tab would be awesome (even make it only editable with certain corp permissions if you're scared of mis-editting by plebs).
---
And since we can set standings for a while corp/alliance, they too should have a notes section. 
---
The 'labelling' of contacts is a pain and super limited, and so clunky to use that I doubt many people even know it's a thing. This would literally just be a more user-friendly version of that, so not like it's not in line with current functional intentions.
---
I was ordered a public hazing
---

Drink bleach you fucking homunculus.

That's the attitude that will get you back here in a month.

---
why use lot isk when little isk do trick?
---
u talk a lot of shit for someones alliance who literally lost this today: https://zkillboard.com/kill/75991730/
---
That’s not my alliance, tho?
---
big cruisers u mean?
---
You need to work on your reading comprehension, mate. I merely said that we’re confused because you’re ceo said during the bash he’d solo our corp plus backup but your diplo says a little later that all of horde is pinged to burn todi. Nobody said we’d burn all of horde. 
---
&gt; AAR: We’re a corp of 7 small gangers
---
sorry couldnt deduce your corp from this very vivid fucking description
---
Re-read my last sentence. By burn all of horde I mean actually ping them lol.
---
We already have them, they are called "Triglavian".
---
Yea, I should have been more clear - I want to multiplasmid my megathron )) 
---
He sent some pretty retarded shit to some of our people as well, many facepalms were had.
---
pls show I want to laugh 
---
[ 2019.03.31 20:50:07 ] Teff nogero &gt; yea so land780 pinged horde so once the ops end tomorrow or tuesday they are probably gonna hard form to burn todi.
---
That’s what I meant. 
---
Its pretty standard for missions
---
To be honest, they should have been dumpstered against all that they faced and many others would have just punted the timer so stop being such an ignoramus and just say gf.
---
What lol
---
Those Eagles that you see on the battlereport were shooting the muninn's as well and not the machs. So a true BR would have been with the eagle fleet on the same side as the Mach's.

You know what would be a delightful April fools joke from the Universe?

You.
---
You guys are always making shitpost on reddit about Frat without revealing that you have a big coalition on your side. Sometimes they can do better than you.
---
&gt; But what can anybody who doesn't own a Super or Rorqual do to defend their ship while ratting in a cloaky camped area?
---
It's called home defense fleet. If you can't defend yourself with subcap against other subcaps you sure do deserve to die or at least, not be able to farm.
---
Look at all those 3200 cap battery drops.
---
Why is Russian propaganda always so dull?
---
&gt; having fun with griefing
---
If you think of Eve PvP as "griefing" you probably not in the right place.
---
tnt was with u guys tho,no?
---
Apparently some time this year, they're changing crystals to armor rep implants. I know and knew Asklepian are that right now. I'm kinda annoyed since I just bought the mid-grade crystal set. It's still in the works and may just be a name change, I'm hoping.
---
They are also pretty risk averse though
---
I used an Oracle for belt rats in Delve and Querious, but you need to have something larger if you do find an officer spawn.
---
You can actually paste results of a moon scan into evepraisal, might speed up the process
---
I mean unless Snuff decides to shit on TAPI until the end of time.
---
"C4" is a denomination used for wormholes (as in class 4). We generally T4 (for tier) for abyssal space. And yes afaik it's still worth it to run, I used a passive regen gila for gamma, I'm sure there are a few HAC that can be used as well.
---
Plus the 30 dreads they had on standby next door. But don't let the truth stand in the way of a good yarn
---
Here's a simple answer: abyssal sites. You can do Tier 3 sites in a kitey T1 cruiser, then, once you have the isk, upgrade to a HAC/Gila/Phantasm and blast through T4s. It's good isk, it's engaging,  extremely solo, and you can be doing a site within a minute of logging in.
---
If you have poor cruiser skills, then you can do frigate-sized abyssal sites. They're meant for three players, but the low tier ones can be soloed by a single assault frigate.
---
This is so true, especially spod brain and anomaly tickerosis
---
There was alot more than 16 eagles.
---
don't joke from something that this game need
---
As someone who runs lvl 5's in a nid. No. no it is not
---
That's what happens when you can't actually do anything despite being some of the oldest entities in the game. They'll just coward behind you guys at any important moment and chest-beat about it.
---

I get that Vile Rat has been elevated to sainthood in the goon community but I'm genuinely curious to know what he did that makes him "a fucking hero in real life" ?
---
Far be it for me to speak ill of the dead, but as far as I can tell he was a regular guy doing a not so regular job and had the unfortunate luck to fall victim to terrorist shitbags.

Who taught you to PvP?

Thanks :D

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqFLXayD6e8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqFLXayD6e8)This is all i have to say 
---
In short, I am lazy. The long explaination is; it should have been in the game for quite some time and the note functionality currently available would make more sense if I could share them with my corporation more directly instead of taking the tedious extra steps it would take to copy-paste it to an external database and then copy-paste a link.

Do you people never aspire to do anything by yourself? 
---
Land780 has already pinged Horde for you apparently, so at least you don't have to; it's already been done for you. 
---
Im on my phone so formatting would suck, basically a gila with large shield externders, t2 adaptive invulv, 1 dda, 1 bcu 1 caldary navy shield thing for passive rep, t2 10mn
---
If you are Omega, why not making 400-500m/month/character with PI passively? It only takes one injector for a totally unskilled character. 
---
I do it myself with 3 chars so i have at least 1.2-1.5b for my plex at the end of the month. 
---
Damn, is IIC still going? D:
---
Don´t forget, CCP, or at least CCP Fozzie used 1st of April to post serious balance passes
---
That reaction is priceless
---
Oh, my feelings 😂😘
---
Imagine though? 😂
---
I seriously thought the free SP were the gag this year.
---
I haven’t been around long enough, but any idea what they did previous April fools, anything exciting? Lol
---
Imagine tho, they take back all those “free” skill points.
---
Made me laugh, now that’s a troll hahaha
---
I can't really remember a lot of the april fools, but years they announced to introduce cat ear headphones cosmetics. There's still a hardcore faction of players demanding them.
---
Ohhhhhh, explains the “cat/bunny ears” meme that I’ve been seeing in-game and on reddit.. 😂😂
---
T3c marauders blackops rattle
---
Agreed, better to take it a bit slow than lose than nice ship and get frustrated.
---
Found on /r/ofcoursethatsathing/
---
you look like some sad little virgin to me you triggered faggot lmao
---
&gt;If you restrict their use it will create all kinds of problems. 
---
They are already creating problems.
---
&gt;There are several ships in eve that have their own jump engine and need cyno to move around.
---
And they are all overpowered because there is no counter to instant travel.
---
&gt;You already have the tools to avoid cynos in every FW system. Don't fight on gates if you don't have your own cyno ready to escalate the fight. 
---
There is no point in having a mechanic that is completely broken. If you dont use a cyno, you would never be affected by the inability to use one.
---
&gt; And use scouts to check if enemy has a fleet sitting on their titan ready to be dropped. Max skilled titan pilot only has 6 LY range. Easy to check around if map stats shows a fleet somewhere close.
---
You think someone is going to scout 50 fucking systems in an area before taking a fight? That must be the dumbest shit I have ever heard. No wonder you dont see the problem with cynos.
---
You telling me you need a Titan to use a cyno? I never heard of that.
---
&gt;You just have to play it smart and not engage obvious cyno baits
---
Dont ever use a cyno and a cyno block will never affect you. Maybe you can play it smart?
---
this meme were old years ago, stop being a retard.
---
Americans fetishize the military, no matter what they actually do. A serviceman could have ordered an air-strike on a civilian village and it would still be seen as a heroic act.
---

Well not old for me, so let me be a retard in peace.

---
ohh cheerzh brav..ya retarded fuck..
---
FUCK SNUFF

You know I’m trying to imagine a grown man saying shit like that and I just can’t, some things never get old huh? Lmao, anyway brb uninstalling..
---
Not sure why you're dreaming about grown men, anyways, bye
---
You forgot a few other IDs such as NIC from the major ones for starters, etc. At any rate, depending on your router and what you run on it, or what you modded it with, you actually can. You can start by disabling protocols that are required for quite a few of these completely. Then you can disable the IDs themselves within your hardware, you can of course run VMs, change MACs, internal IPs, literally everything. What is actually on your hardware does not have to be what actually goes out.
---
Going further, did you know how incredibly easy it is to make a blank IP blocking list and then open them up 1 by 1 manually as you start up your apps and simply not let through anything that you don't want to go through ? For example Nvidia and Intel just for starters ... It is a bit time consuming, takes me about 20 min to set it up though. 
---
I'm surprised how little of these things you know, as a software engineer ....
---
Dyslexia confirmed lol, anywaysss bye twinky
---
you had to bring in GSF to secure the kipstar kill lmfao
---
&gt;They are already creating problems.
---
Only if you don't know how to use FW plexes.
---
&gt; And they are all overpowered because there is no counter to instant travel.
---
FW plexes are your counter. You find them in every system. Learn to use them.
---
&gt;There is no point in having a mechanic that is completely broken. If you dont use a cyno, you would never be affected by the inability to use one.
---
Cynos are not broken. You seem to actually have problem with people dropping capitals/supers against subcapitals. Capitals are going to be nerfed soon so they can't be used such abusively against subcapitals. Hope it helps.
---
&gt; You think someone is going to scout 50 fucking systems in an area before taking a fight? That must be the dumbest shit I have ever heard. No wonder you dont see the problem with cynos. 
---
You only need to scout systems that show numbers in map statistics. Of course this only helps against titan and blobs bridges. Capitals are huge problem even in low numbers against subcaps. But that isn't actually a problem with cynos but with ship balance.
---
&gt;Dont ever use a cyno and a cyno block will never affect you. Maybe you can play it smart?
---
Don't fight an enemy that is known to drop capitals outside of plexes.
---
:krab: :krab: :krab: 
---
Faction ammo pictured, reaches 900 DPS with rages... an accelerator brings it up by about 50 dps more but wondering if flare/rigorous might be better for dark sites
---
But how are we gonna fight the gerbil army?  They've already built a Keepstar in there and will be hard to evict.
---
Go for another CCC 1.9% cap stable is awfully tight 
---
No, mostly it seems that people leave you alone if they don't think it's worth bashing you down. I'm sure it will happen to us eventually however, it's just a thing you have to accept when living in a wormhole with a small group.
---
I fail to see the shit talk, only a pastebin full of compliments :/
---
Either Cap as your cap is very dodge or missile application if you just wanna Dakka through the sites.
---
I am preparing to do that with 6 characters as of now but want to top it with carrier ratting because I invested a lot in skills and ship.
---

Shhh! Don't give them any cute ideas.

"We've realised the (Advanced)Spaceship Command skill has been too easy to acquire, and thus increased the skillpoint requirements. No skillpoints has been removed, but Spaceship Command + Advanced Spaceship Command has been combined to one skill with a new total of 10 240 000 SP. This skill is also not injectable. Enjoy half a year of no Capital Ships in EVE! Best Regards, CCP."

Mfw chad initboi was scared of virgin wormholers
---
makes you think 
---
Haha lets not forget about that pos fuel boys
---
That's funny, I joined Horde when I first started playing. What a fucking shitshow, especially on comms. It's a shouting match between mongoloids. Any attempts to get help were met with sarcastic replies. I hope things have got better
---
loot fary is drunk today 
---
3/12 are cruisers. 
---
CCPlease nerf Cruisers are to stronk 
---
&gt;Only if you don't know how to use FW plexes.
---
No, thats incorrect.
---
&gt;FW plexes are your counter. You find them in every system. Learn to use them.
---
They dont fix cynos.
---
&gt;Cynos are not broken. You seem to actually have problem with people dropping capitals/supers against subcapitals. 
---
Instant travel is broken because there is no counter. People drop carriers on cruisers.
---
&gt;Capitals are going to be nerfed soon so they can't be used such abusively against subcapitals. Hope it helps.
---
They should add a 5 min delay to cynos, but I havent seen that, so there are no relevant nerfs coming. Or are you talking about the "5 minute" useless balance patch?
---
&gt;You only need to scout systems that show numbers in map statistics. Of course this only helps against titan and blobs bridges. Capitals are huge problem even in low numbers against subcaps. But that isn't actually a problem with cynos but with ship balance.
---
So when you have 30 secs to decide to take a fight, you should spend an hour scouting every nearby system? What a perfectly balanced game this is!
---
&gt;Capitals are huge problem even in low numbers against subcaps. But that isn't actually a problem with cynos but with ship balance.
---
Really? Lets remove or delay cynos and watch the problem go away! If you reduce all capital damage by 95% to all subcaps, they just switch to blops and the problem remains. Could there be a pattern? Could it be that instant travel is overpowered? Yes.
---
wait he had money for a full exca set but not for a 3rd mining rig? or a panic? or a cyno? 
---
oh so this is your guys lvl 5 fit

Why should I give u isk? U surrendered to me! U owe me

it's trivial to setup a gsheets that translates this into readable and useful figures. use a combination of:

It's hard to find someone who doesn't have 30 dreads on standby next door these days...
---
Because it's all they have. They don't even engage when its even number or even when that have a dozen or so more DPS ships.  Not without putting in the batphone first. 
---
You mean [these](https://i.imgur.com/0JFqlC6.png) free SP?
---
&gt; You can start by disabling protocols that are required for quite a few of these completely.
---
Tell me more about how you're going to disable eve online protocols and continue to log in.
---
Tell me more about how you're going to block connection requests from the eve online client and still play the game.
---
How about CCP places the gate and announces its location but doesn't tell anyone that it will only be availible for 24 hours. After 24 hours it disappears never to return.
---
Wait till you reach river Wolga.
---
Missile ROF rig. Get rid of the last BCS and add in a reactive control unit.
---
Use CN missiles on frigates, and if you can move them to the blue cloud for that dank 300% sig "debuff". You'll toast frigates and cruisers.
---
Funny part is, since Pearl Assbyss owns them now, its pretty much guaranteed they'll come at some point.

I mean, I get where you're coming from and agree about CVA, but when was the last time CVA called an invasion of a hostile entity like the Russians and did that? A bit different since CVA seems to always be on the defensive, imo.
---
PvP is just one of the many possible focuses of this game.  
---
And what would villains do without the white knights? Would be boring, dont you think?
---
Would only be better if you remote bought the skill book and used the free SP to moonwalk out with it. 
---
Lol, sounds like the type of nightmare stainguy had every night
---
I can't even imagine how shocked I'd be if I was in a small gang and an Erebus fell out of something like that.  I mean, I just get happy to loot like [100m in fuel blocks](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75903418/) from structures. Did you guys have any idea it was in there or was it a total surprise? Did your comms fucking erupt?

No *we* can boson the others !

You are missing character names.

I too can see the botting clearly ongoing here

Jesus, just the shoulder? In M-OE back then I had the feeling I could raise a piglet to full size, slay it, slice it apart, BBQ it aaand eat it in the time it took to just lock a target :D

&gt;Glacial Spodbrain
---
and we wonder how they got more titans than any one else...
---
Theran alliance.. the latest addition to GOTG 
---
Clearly botting and should be reported
---
Are we related somehow? \*wonders\*
---
they warped off as soon as i dropped into local, the screenshot on the left is what I got off the cloaky camper when laughing at it that they have actually tried to deter us from going into there with a haw dread. CCPlease Downtime saved a lot of bots in this enormous in XW2H-V.

Isn’t cloaky camping against the nip..
---
pros: 
---
* no supers, no titans
---
* no local
---
* content changes every time you roll
---
* smaller corps, more "at home" feel
---
* krabbing is insanely better, super ratters are plebs
---
cons:
---
* INIT has already started seeding your wormhole for their eviction next year
---
Local.
---
Amazing, everything you just said is false
---
He was the lead diplomat for goonswarm in the BoB days and up until his death in 2012. As for his regular job, he was IT tech or something of the sort for the US foreign office.
---
Get a vexor with rails and sentries, sit on a gate. When a hauler comes through point and hopefully kill it - much easier if there is a few of you. Ideally you would of scanned it for tank/loot on a previous gate to see if it was worth it.
---
Once you hit enough negative sec status you will either need to tag up or ping off a citadel near the gate. Timings can get awkward especially if they hold cloak, but that's how I used to do it. You'd also need to have a looter on standby too if you want to make a profit.
---
i would say he is dead as soon as he meet neut wave
---
And that's how FRT became a super power with loads of supers and titans in less then 2 years. Others had to struggle for many, many years to get to their level. 
---
why is there no pilot names?
---
struggle in 2019 lmao
---
what nip :P
---
WH pros -
---
Bob is just
---
No blobs
---
Lots of isk potential
---
Can lock the hole down with relative safety
---
Lots of isk means blingy ships
---
Smaller scale fights
---
Cons
---
Bob is not merciful
---
Spamming v can get tiring
---
If you get podded, you have to find your way back
---
You can be evicted relatively easily
---
Logistics is difficult
---
Finding content can be tough sometimes
---
Null pros
---
Established corps and space means it's easier to hop in and go
---
Logistics are simple
---
Content is usually just around the corner
---
F1 PvP fleets for new bros
---
Null cons
---
Reddit memes 
---
F1 fleets
---
Blob warfare
---
Easy for new bros to get lost and quit
---
Generally speaking, it's easier to join a null group as you can hop on and play whatever you're feeling that day.  WHs have tons of isk potential and more "fun" fleets but you have to work more to make that happen
---
isnt afk cloaky camping the 'frowned upon' bit. whereas clearly. taking pictures etc would mean he was simply cloaked in the system.
---
referring to it as cloaky camping as thats what it was called in the old days :D
---
No, it's not. Things are hopefully better now, perhaps I was a member during a bad time, who knows, must be coming up to 2 years ago now. That was my experience at the time.
---
[https://imgur.com/LGNSE2v](https://imgur.com/LGNSE2v)  
---
Here are the names of some of them, pulled of the can info. there were more as can be seen by the OP. but we already killed allot of them when i started pulling these up
---
thx, random names and obvious bot characters showing up recently. 
---
Please report this using ingame feature and raise ticket, also /u/ccp_falcon - i guess security want to see this. 
---
???
---
Isn't botting against your csm campaign?
---
If this is true - i hope they keep it  :D
---
Lol gila got lowest damage
---
I only do 4's but they are pretty chill and loot is alright. I find it comparable to carrier ratting with a heft corp tax due to purchasing Filaments. 
---
Just don't panic and overheat your launchers to long when you get 7 nuet cruisers on field and burn your launchers out like I did the first time I Cerb'd.
---
I use a Gila for Gamma's and a Cerb for Exotics and Electricals. Gila probably could do the 3 if you change from passive fit Gamma to active.
---
But I like the spice of different ships.
---
I don't do proving grounds as I am not space rich enough to throw ships at it. But if you enjoy 1v1 600mil&gt;2bil cruisers it is probably worth it for the thrill.
---
&gt;ere no pilot names?
---
Sorry about that, this happend right b4 dt and I didnt get the local scan here is what is pulled off some of the cans after servers came back up
---
On current hoboleaks a "SP" boxes showed up up to 1.000.000 sp.     
---
Like the one already ccp gifted.        
---
Tbh i don't know why they didn't went higher with generic items.  
---
AAR?
---
unlike most the nullbears commenting here.
---
me, not in a nullsec megacorp.
---
and not in pirat.
---
i can confirm pirat are actually very very good at what they do. they dont just gatecamp and sit on undocks.
---
me, personally laugh just as much at people hiding behind super umbrellas and f1 pushing fleets in space of thier own
---
as i do laugh at highsec fighters who do things the way they do.
---
with even numbers, and even hulls. im 100% sure pirates 50 would destroy PH's 50 for example.
---
i say arrange it. a 50v50 pirat vs PH.
---
cheap like mallers and augs or somthing would be fun to watch
---
I bet this is just a ruse cruse by FCs to make us all go on bashing ops...
---
There's a smart bomb for killing frigs, hyperspats for warping faster, prop mod for aligning faster. Two shield extenders for a passive tank and neut in case you get tackled. It really does look like a throw away L5 mission blitzing carrier. As that's pretty much all you need as you land on grid kill one thing usually and then immediately warp off. 
---
Haha, that's pretty good man. Block=Win
---
He was an IT guy with the American Embassy in Libya.
---
As an embassy is a small isolated community it's a fair guess that he was sometimes involved in national security matters. I think it's not unreasonable for an American to view that as patriotic. Even if he wasn't helping the CIA it's still a dangerous assignment undertaken to benefit his country.
---
Shots fired
---
&gt; No, thats incorrect.
---
It's correct. You can't use a cyno outside or inside a plex. Not even a covert blobs cyno. And capitals cannot use the acceleration gates so they are 0% threat to you.
---
&gt; They dont fix cynos. 
---
You can't use cynos in plexes. So yes they do.
---
&gt; Instant travel is broken because there is no counter. People drop carriers on cruisers.
---
Capital vs subcapital balance is the real problem. Sounds like you didn't play in the old meta where capitals didn't do much against subcaps. It was a lot better back then.
---
&gt;So when you have 30 secs to decide to take a fight, you should spend an hour scouting every nearby system? What a perfectly balanced game this is!
---
Checking zkillboards and map statistics take 10 seconds. Not that hard :D
---
&gt;Really? Lets remove or delay cynos and watch the problem go away! If you reduce all capital damage by 95% to all subcaps, they just switch to blops and the problem remains. Could there be a pattern? Could it be that instant travel is overpowered? Yes. 
---
Blobs are totally different thing. They are extremely expensive compared to regular carriers and they are highly vulnerable to other subcaps. You kill 1 black op battleship and you most likely win the fight. And if they have a large group sitting on bridge blobs, it will show up in map. Your scouts will see it if they open the ingame map.
---
Lowsec Titan bridging service to Stain 2k20
---
classic, op to date has just used a supercarrier to feel good at the game.
---
op doesnt realise that nano ships still require skill of some level to fly. not just an omnidirectional tracking computer and 3 hotkeys.
---
op ignores the fact that fitting said nano removes lowslots. lowslots are super needed on everything if you didnt know :)
---
the lost lowslot is either loss of tank, or loss of dps or loss of defensive midslots as now your shield tanking.
---
let alone the reduced capacitys and reduced hull etc etc.
---
go and buy some combat recons and dunk these nerds you say you cant catch.
---
If you want to do it efficiently you swap the damage control for another dda. A shield extender for another drone Nav (a lot of lvl 5's the fighters have to burn 100+ Kms and swap the smartbomb for another fsu. Dps tank the site. Less time on grid less time to get caught. 
---
I mean mine is like 1300 with my skills and heavy drones. 
---
A vindy is the one id go polarized on that would yield some siilly numbers lol
---
supers in 2019 lmao
---
500k 750k and 1mil sp boxes
---
Missile ROF. Make sure you're using implants / boosters on T5 otherwise you're gonna lose it in some of the longer rooms due to the lower DPS.
---
shut up nanofag, enjoy your dying gameplay.
---
boy i sure am glad that ccp is going to remove poses and instead of this happening you can bash an epic low power citadel with a damage cap and up to a week timer which won't drop anything!
---
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY

---
Apostolically speaking - an outcome is never truly expected.
---
Something obvious that should be there since the beginning, even higher numbers as those are generic items that can be used on multiple occasions.      
---
you can squeeze 100k dps tank out of a rev for like 4B, what do rorqs tank, i dont even know.
---

---
MULTI BOXING???
---
Outrageous!!!!
---
Not sure if there is a rig to make it a gila, but fit that one
---
I'm the one who used to roam in fleets of highly skilled gangs of 7-10 players that enjoyed murdering larger fleets in pursuit. Before CCP decided to make it a finger snap to give everyone Titans and supers and injectable sp. Thus stagnating nullsec and any notable conflict from happening. In place of a dynamic Eve online. We now have content wars and small gang is for the most part dying . So you enjoy your blobs of 3000 on citadel fights that are meaningless and I'll watch you all descend into the abyss from a distance. Thanks.

you learn alot and now i can work out in my head the speed somthing would be dual webbed and be not to far off :D
---
Anyone with half a brain knew the apostle was bait tanking. Jesse does not have half a brain though. He argued with anyone who pointed it out. To him, it was impossible it was bait tanking because "the fort is neuting". Pretty sure a few people super rage quit the alliance just based on Jesse, not even the losses.
---
All of this is very true, but wh fights come fast and without notice, being ready is key. And if you find a good wh corp, they'll have most of the basics a new bro will need to get started for pi, and gas huffing to make isk.
---
Adapt or quit

Yea I was told it was about 75% dual, never checked though. Guessing triple won’t give you much more than 80%?

Mmmm, talk to me dirty as well :)
---
a dual web applied makes the ship travel about -87.5% of its original speed.
---
im working off memory here :)
---
vindi web is 90% per web
---
3rd web slows you to about -94%? ish of your original speed.
---
where ofc 2 vindi webs your at -97% of your original speed
---

Why someone would batphone Darkness of all people is a headscratcher. the point of a batphone is to try to win.

I think he wants to promote FRT plex sales , i think... tbh not sure. 
---
Thanks for saving me the time of blowing up my pod..
---
No, you see, if the bots aren't in Delve, they're okay. Also, they're not rorqual bots -- they're barge bots. These are also okay.
---
now get that pyfa,

Don't struggle by yourself as eve is to complex to explain stuff you are asking fast and in a way you will understand it.

Hahaha awesome ))
---
yeah the eagles were with snuff to hit the structure 
---
&gt;It's correct. You can't use a cyno outside or inside a plex. Not even a covert blobs cyno. And capitals cannot use the acceleration gates so they are 0% threat to you.
---
It is incorrect that the existance of plexes solves the cyno problem.
---
&gt;You can't use cynos in plexes. So yes they do.
---
Im not talking about plexes. The idea that cynos would be a problem where they cannot be used and where capitals cannot enter is absurd. You think people complains about ECM when it fails to jam?
---
&gt;Capital vs subcapital balance is the real problem. Sounds like you didn't play in the old meta where capitals didn't do much against subcaps. It was a lot better back then.
---
Unless you are willing to nerf capitals to make them literally unable to kill any subcap, this will not even produce a partial solution as people would just switch to blops.
---
The real problem is the lack of counter to instant travel.
---
&gt;Checking zkillboards and map statistics take 10 seconds. Not that hard :D
---
The map is basically useless since it isnt updated often enough. If you need the help of a third party website to deal with in-game mechanics, those mechanics are broken. Ultimately, these are avoidance tools and dont solve the problem. 
---
&gt;Blobs are totally different thing. They are extremely expensive compared to regular carriers 
---
We know for a fact balancing on cost doesnt work. For this to work, they need to remove injectors, nerf a fuckton of stuff, and crack down hard on bots and "safe" isk in null/whs.
---
&gt;they are highly vulnerable to other subcaps. You kill 1 black op battleship and you most likely win the fight. And if they have a large group sitting on bridge blobs, it will show up in map. Your scouts will see it if they open the ingame map.
---
Doesnt matter. They drop 20 blops on 5 cruisers. You escape or die.
---
If you don’t boson people, I will have to file a complaint. I would be very disappointed 
---
Most of the time, the names in question are actual random keyboard mashing on the home row. A Chinese name would be, at its most unintelligible to an "American," some sort of numerology thing. It would at least have vowels and syllables otherwise.
---
Are you sure? Could be an autist? This requires at least months of investigation! /s
---
&gt;Others had to ~~struggle~~ bot for many, many years to get to their level. 
---
I allways though fighters need more to there game play currently the only extra stuff you can do is hit keep rang an orbit, or bomb aiming. But part from aiming bombs you bearly need to do keep range or manually control.
---
WH pros :
---
- no blob, no tidi, no super/titan droped on yours nano gang
---
- insane isk
---
- everyday is diferent
---
- no CTA (very rare) 
---
- smaller fleet mean you have, individualy, more impact on the fight
---
- the satisfaction to fly/kill blingy ship
---
- barely no diplo. just kill everyone and stay polite
---
WH cons : 
---
- no alpha accepted
---
- multiple Omega account sometime required
---
- no afk mining/krabing
---
- Logistic can be tricky (but not as much as people think)
---
About Eviction:
---
- that's happend, be ready. don't keep useless and pricy assets in your hole
---
It can create some awsome fight, because if you lose, you will lose everything. So, you undock everything you have and fight until death.
---
ok mate, run back to your c2 hahaha
---
Looks like chinese(?). Good thing they told us. We would never have suspected!

Segine is hands down, the most handi-incapable and socially incompetent person I have ever met in eve. I have literally, never met another human being who can stomach being around his utterly toxic personality. I do not understand how he is in the position that he is, or how people in his alliance do not leave within 60 seconds of interacting with him.  
---
GOTG, you have made a massive mistake letting that withering cancer into your blue list. But you do you.  
---
If you are in Theran and reading this. Get out. Seriously. That alliance is the most incompetently run and bear filled alliance I have ever seen in my career in eve. Literally anyone would be better.
---
That´s honestly no joke. Look on the forums into the section "Upcoming Features &amp; Changes, and see for yourself the threats that got created on 1st of April, and weren´t a joke

Ok, I suppose my idea of a quick question was a bit loaded. 
---
Thanks.
---
So you are saying he has graduated top of his class with more than 300 confirmed kills? 
---
The capacitor safeguard rig might help you with keeping your shield booster on and given your cap stability is scarily low, it would be very important to do so. Or, given you have a cap battery, you'd benefit from a Semiconductor Memory Cell as it would stack.
---
You did better than some do. Most just get salty when being killed. Especially russians seem to anger easily.
---
Shooting Herons can be quite lucrative if you get an explorer with a full cargo hold. Talking hundreds of millions here.
---
When you are scanning be: 
---
* cloaked
---
* aligned
---
* at a safe spot
---
If you cant cloak the being at a safe and moving fast is even more important. Why? if you are aligned to something you just need to hit warp and you are instantly off grid. Someone who scanned you down lands at the place where you were when he scanned. So the further you moved the harder it will be for him to get you.
---
While hacking you obviously can't be aligned. Some prefer to orbit the can, but I generally just sit still. I have my overview set to show any other ship as yellow so as soon as the overview lights up I hit warp to somewhere. A ship with a fast align time helps with this.
---

/r/nocontext
---
Even more as I'm at work and the site is blocked.
---
null sec combat sites are fun and it wont send you to low sec to escalate.
---
Let's put it like this: always align if your situation allows you to. While mining or hacking this is obviously difficult, but you can make the life of your Hunter harder. Moving (orbiting), fast acting, being unpredictable (for example leaving a bad, full can in a Relic Site). Another thing to keep you safe(r) is making a safe point in the middle of space. For that you warp to any point space and creating a bookmark while you are mid-warp, then staying at that exact safe point (and aligning to a planet/gate/another safe/etc.). This way hunters need special probes (and launchers that usually don't fit on certain PvP ships as they need a lot of resources) so called combat probes to find you in that safe point (they are seeable on Dscan as well so keep an eye out!).
---
For your other question on people killing you in a scanner: 1st because they simply can. They don't really get punished in Lowsec or lower space for that matter, so why not do it? That sometimes can be the whole reason these people fly ships :).
---
2nd those little T1 Scanners can carry up to several billions in loot, you wouldn't believe me what you sometimes find in those tiny ships!

     New Caldari Prime – Ishukone unveiled its latest addition to their New Caldari headquarters complex, Momoriyota Plaza, this morning: a major extension to the communications and viewing spire of the megacorp's primary skycraper. As a result of this new extension, the towering edifice sets the planet's record for tallest building. It supplants the previous record holder, Kaalakiota, which has a campus a few kilometers away from Ishukone's central complex. 
---
    The Momoriyota Plaza is the anchoring ground for a circle of towering skyscrapers that rise several kilometers, all interconnected by transit tubes and skybridges. The design allows for the Ishukone corporation to occasionally tear down and replace one of the skyscrapers without interfering with the rest. The Momoriyota Plaza has a reputation for always being under construction due to the mega's historically reliable growth.
---
    During the opening ceremony, employees living in corporate housing on the plaza expressed relief that the current phase of construction work had ceased. "It's a prestigious posting to be sure," one source said, "But is getting three meters more important than a full night's sleep? We've had constant autojet traffic back and forth, and these last months the plaza's been more of a launchpad for constructor drones than a pleasant park for workers to enjoy!"
---
    Eyewitnesses across town reported seeing construction equipment being moved to the Kaalakiota campus only a few hours after Ishukone's opening ceremony.

I love you, because you play/played EVE.
---
But this “Elite Smallgang” rhetoric is the most garbage thing. You aren’t/weren’t that skilled if you can’t adapt to change and I’m sorry but you aren’t that good if your excuse is “everyone has supers now!”
---
Also it’s tiring to hear the same lie repeated ad nauseum about wars being “pointless” now. As if structures somehow made ownership and use of space irrelevant. It’s a lie that flies in the face of reality like the death of XiX and Tri’s recent situation. It ignores half of last year and the long term changes that came from it. I’m not aware of a single major alliance that is currently in a friendly “content war” either.
---
Goons are attacking the north, Darkness is legitimately attacking Horde as retaliation for Branch. Frat and TAPI aren’t fighting a content war either. Maybe there’s some alliance spindoctors who are pushing that, but attacking your enemies with strategic goals isn’t any more of a content war than wars fought in the past.
---
The real reason supers are showing up more is because of phoebe. Prior to that, there was a massive squelching influence to deploying extremely expensive supercaps anywhere because someone with more supers could travel across the cluster in minutes, limited only by capacitor and fuel and show up to any fight. Now not only is that timeline slowed, but it forces the group doing that to run the risk of being unable to respond rapidly to changes back home. Is it better that the game requires more strategic thinking on the part of supercap groups? Yes. Does it have the consequence of creating zones where supercaps can show up from one side unopposed? Yes. You can’t have your cake and eat it too.
---
Quit blaming injectors and supercaps for why you’re unable to adapt. The game changes, and I’m sorry to you that it’s not going to be the same game as it was in 2009 forever. It changing is what makes it what it is though. Surely you understand given your comments about “meaningless wars” though?
---
&gt; Im not talking about plexes. The idea that cynos would be a problem where they cannot be used and where capitals cannot enter is absurd. You think people complains about ECM when it fails to jam? 
---
Only thing that is absurd here is that you don't understand that FW lowsec is the only place where you CAN avoid cynos. In non-fw lowsec and nullsec you will get mercilessy cynoed every time unless you have good intel/scouting/tactics. 
---
Highsec wardec mechanics are going to be overhauled soon. Maybe you should go to highsec. You can't use cynos there. Sounds like FW might not be your thing.
---
What if this is actually an April Fools to get people to blow up their pods?

is the keepstar kill actually a win when you have to damage control every time on reddit?

back in the day, I did C4 (pulsar is easier but not needed). whith a moderate pipm, passiv shield myrm (200M thanks to T2 rigs).
---
Not realy efficient (~100M/h) and need heavy refit. It was more a personal goal than a reliable income.
---
a cheap one (&lt;100M) can do C2 and C3 with medium skills.
---
imo the main problem with the myrm is the loss of drone and the weak dps (that why the gila is better in the long run)
---
you can begin with some gas site, as easy as C2/C3 and a little bit safer (and you can also huff gas)
---
Firing full auto screws your aim over any way. You should be firing in bursts

Haha awesome! That ranks up there with the time Everquest switched everyones gender for the day
---
You cant realistically avoid cynos anywhere. Your logic allows you to say a cyno isnt a problem while docked. It gets you nowhere.
---
&gt;In non-fw lowsec and nullsec you can be mercilessy cynoed anywhere unless you have good intel/scouting/tactics.
---
And that is a problem. Everybody should want cynos to be nerfed. In the absense of that, a cyno block in FW space is better than nothing.
---
&gt;Highsec wardec mechanics are going to be overhauled soon. Maybe you should go to highsec. You can't use cynos there. Sounds like FW might not be your thing.
---
No. We need to balance the game to make it playable. Instant travel is overpowered and must go.

what were you doing with 5 accounts if you never got to the point where you were able to pvp?

I'm sure being the fourth largest alliance in the game didn't have anything to do with it. I'm also very sure that no other alliance in the game has botters. No, certainly the MER statistics in Delve are 100% legit players.

How does this even?

Furthermore, Its not actually assembled. How does one even move that now.

Yeah, go to zkillboard, hit F12, go to the Console tab and paste this:

    clippy.load('Clippy', function(agent){a = agent; agent.show(); agent.speak("noob"); setTimeout("a.hide();", 5000) });

Minor correction: it was 1 carrier, 2 dreads, and some support totaling 7b that got killed. Still peanuts to most probably, but for our tiny corp a nice success. The whole context just makes it even better.

The idea of removing the asset safety mechanics for Low Power structure should be a no brainer, and would add some depth and push to cleaning out the Citadel spawn.

He had a panic, but he couldnt lock an asteroid to activate it because he was being 5 damped by an arazu and at a ping. He'd normally be able to lock the rock from the ping, but the damps pushed his lock range below the threshold of the distance required. Thus no ability to panic.
---
Haha le epic pwn 
---
if you're caught in a carrier you're either extremely unlucky getting landed on while deaccelerating from the warp or extremely lazy not paying the least bit of attention to dscan/local/grid. And if someone got 80 players in bombers together I don't think it's unreasonable to there not be a single man counter to it expect not getting caught

Second this, I have flown alongside Red alliance and legion of xXdeathXx on the teniferis detorid border quite a bit in the last few weeks and they take risks I would think are completely insane. They get away with it though and tbh are our most reliable source of backup (whether or not we think to ask them) when frt forms an outsized fleet for our 8-10 assault frigs. 
---
I've been saying this forever.
---
The corp has been kicked this WE from TNT. A good thing so.
---
I wouldve rather kept playing tarkov wtb Luger rounds in eve 
---
I remember one year was a corpse grinder that made drugs.  Looked a bit like a mobile tractor unit.  Add two dead bodies and an exotic dancer and get blue pills.  2 bodies + a janitor and quicker salvage drug.  That kinda of stuff
---
Well, writing a long reply from a phone is seriously admirable, so thanks for that.
---
Thanks for the kill reasoning, it is almost inspiring to be honest.
---
I will adapt and learn these... Rotus tactics - if i can get to nullsec in one piece 
---
buy the skill books from your character sheet and profit the rest when you sell it. 
---
No way a Gila can do T5 darks...
---
Was a fun time. We heard PanFam was bringing a big blob to the field so we left the other timer and took our small fleet home with few losses. 
---
You've got that backwards
---
&gt;No blobs
---
:thinking:
---
Its really simple: If your focus in game is PVE null is where it's at. It's less ISK/Hour than wormhole ratting but *far* safer especially if you join an alliance with a Super/Titan umbrella meaning you can be undocked and grinding for much longer.
---
If your interest is PVP however (not referring to F1 monkeying btw) the you **need** to be in wormholes. Because of wormhole mass mechanics, all WH fights are essentially small gang fights with even the big engagements limited to a few dozen ships at most so each and every single pilot's actions really matter and can often be decisive.
---
Here's a final (**but huge**) caveat. If you cannot (or don't like) to scan, stay in null.  
---
what about you ever actually not posting for once
---
Report them. Easy as that. Weird you guys only seem to post on the threads about your enemies botting, though. I wonder why that is.
---
It's going to take like 2 years, jokes on you your corp is probably going to die before then.
---
Simply put, wormholes require a bit more effort for some every day tasks. Null is much better suited to a more casual play style. Whether or not one is more rewarding than the other is dependent on your perspective. 
---
Giving details on your Timezone and general hours of activity would likely help people narrow down suggestions. If you are going to /r/evejobs make sure to put those details in.
---
Side note, beware groups with the line "we are looking to grow our X timezone presence". Where X is yours, not always but half the time this translates to "we have 5 guys in that timezone who may or may not be active and you will be mercilessly camped by the local enemies because we give them grief during our real prime time".
---
Why didn't this shitty subreddit do anything for april fools
---
Who else would vote for him but bots?
---
&gt; I was told that it made it easier to cycle to the different accounts
---
yep 100% it does this - default hotkeys are ctrl+alt+client number and it cycles instantly
---
&gt;it eased up the resource drain on the computer
---
isboxer also hot-swaps cpu priority and fps cap on your clients so that only the "active" client is taking full resources, the rest are just using the bare minimum
---
True to that. There were always bots in the game but letting the floodgates open for Chinese players has let to this situation. Having the most of their botters/rmt'ers gathered in FRT and goons while the smaller bot corps have nested in renters and other alliances. 
---
Back then bots had little impact on the game due to fear of losing their account that took weeks/months of training but this right now is getting out of control. And together with skill injectors Botters are basically unstoppable as they do not fear being banned. They will just create more bots. 
---
I expect in less then 10 years this game either to be dead or hyper inflated economy. 
---
But will it one day be worth it to be rid of spaghetti code? Not disagreeing with you btw, just playing devils advocate
---
Something erupted
---
The corp has been kicked from TNT this WE :)
---
Literally nobody cares. 
---
Move to low/ null and shoot them
---
if you're so upset by posting that ruins your narrative you could just use the `block user` link and never see it again
---
I had A-type adaptive and high grades so don’t go throwing ur weight around like ur king it’s just bad luck on the spawn, also how’s ur Gila gonna do once the patch lands and it’s drone bonus drops to 250%? That’s why I’m not flying one but thanks for ur input on my CERB like I asked....
---
Is that how it used to be? That's interesting
---
Lol, who is dismissing botters? Report em all
---
Were the two rorqs just chilling in a safe? 
---
That's one example of high-sec care-bearism (the bad kind). 
---
Either they are pretending every player they meet is an npc with no feelings (i.e not taking into account "they'll remember that" when ninja-looting a site) or it's just a case of double-standards.
---
That, or you set them back 1 hour in terms of paying their rent IRL, in which case they should really not be doing high-sec sites... /s
---
Stainguy good post??? Oh right it's April fools.
---
&gt; letting the floodgates open for Chinese players 
---
Botting has existed since the dawn of EVE online, you racist dipishit lol 
---
Low power should slow burn through fuel and once out of fuel for more then 48h, go to a "Shutdown" mode where RF timer and asset safety disable...
---
I can tell you where to send ISK to be guaranteed to join Karma fleet ....
---
High-sec drama is best drama
---
Dank leak or fake news??
---
There are good and bad people in every organisation in the game. Some are better than others but you should check out /r/evejobs /r/pandemichorde /r/Karmafleet /r/Bravenewbies 
---
Giant supercap space pinata.
---
Hunting in blue space is kinda frowned upon
---
Dude relax, it’s not a big deal.
---
What does this screenshot even prove? Jetcan mining is botting now?
---
Why are people still using CSAA’s?
---
It doesn't show anything lol 
---
&gt;neat
---
&gt;with ice
---
Pick one
---
Upon pod destruction. Well played CCP. 
---
I have never one time defended botters of any stripe. You're just assuming a lot and sticking me with it. 
---
Botters are a plague on the game. Any botters in any alliance in any system doing anything should be punished. If you think the same thing, drop the partisan outrage pitchfork. The issue in EVE isn't frat, or goons, or legacy, or B0T. It's that there are a lot of people who bot, and they are hard to stamp out. If you burn them out of one group, they go to another. You collapse one corp, they reappear in another corp in days. Ban their toons, they inject more. They have no allegiance to frat or goons or anyone else - they will go to whatever coalition will take them. The only solution is that they aren't welcome anywhere, and alliances that harbor them are punished by CCP AND their own members. Somehow /r/eve missed that message and decided that botting is yet another in a long line of cudgels to be used in eve politics - "your group is bad because you bot; my group is angelic and would never bot" is pants-on-head stupid and yet par for the course around here.
---
Keepstars are expensive and renters are stingy.
---
Then I just ask, why were they anchored on sieged rorqs?
---
Depends on your definition of blob. Is it a number? Then what number? 20 pilots? 50? 100? Or is simply being outnumbered? 5 pilots on 1, is that a blob?
---
What does this show?
---
Yes, but now we know who ignores "e-war only" FC commands ;P
---
&lt;3
---
Oh? CCP found another way to fuck things up? Colour me shocked!
---
My comment about it being funny is directed more towards your "holyer than thao" leader Elo knight who has been rampant about delve botters. Now that his own alliance is caught doing it, he is nowhere to be seen with no comments exept a lame pun about a nip he purpusfully broke
---
Uhmm well yeah cool but unless you have or know or can find and hire a *trustworthy* pilot before it's too late...what a waste.
---
Also the dreadbomb "in their time zone" seems like it's implying that it wasn't in FI.RE's time zone.
---
That BR happened from 5pm-6:30pm Moscow time, 10pm-11:30pm Chinese time. While most Russians live in Moscow time, 7 of the 15 largest Russian cities are at least 2 hours after Moscow time. For these cities, the BR would be 7pm to 8:30pm or later.
---
I don't know about you, but to me, 5-7 pm is probably within your time zone (especially if you're the one planning the attack) and 7-8 pm is probably more firmly in your time zone than 10-11pm is.
---
The pros are pretty simple..
---
\- PVP is very high quality generally
---
\- Good krabbing
---
\- Your home WH really feels like "your" territory in a way null does not
---
\- If you kill an enemy structure, you get to loot it
---
The Cons are a little more involved and are important to understand
---
\- WH logistics is a little annoying, and in general your hangar is going to look differently than in null. You're probably not going to just amass billions and billions in shit and ships in your home to just tinker with whenever you feel like. Because in WH you're always a day away from getting blockaded out of your home and losing everything. In WH you'll be making smaller more frequent grocery runs, and they'll be riskier
---
\- You need a good corp. WH mechanics are involved, and operating a successful secure WH corporation is a team effort that requires (or should require) contributions from everyone. This is very different from null when almost any sufficiently large group of bumblefucks can do anything as long as there's one person that knows what is happening and they pay rent.
---
\- You will lose ships, sometimes expensive ships, because WH mechanics are such that it promotes getting ganked on by enemies. You aren't going to avoid it. It will happen.
---
\- On some nights your content will be defined for you... Bob giveth, and Bob taketh away
---
TL;DR wormholes are EXCELLENT but only if you're a hands on/high energy player with the motivation to make the incredible upsides of Wormholes work for you. Krab hard, live hard, die hard.
---
&gt; My question then: Is alignment ALWAYS a good idea? What if I want to be standing still (mining, analysing relics, loading cargo to/from containers or depots). 
---
No, it isn't always a good idea. As you said, there are plenty of things to do in space that don't mix well with a moving ship. What you should do, however, is always know what your exit strategy is: A station you can go to or a safespot you've created somewhere, for example. Make sure you're able to quickly issue the warp to command when the need arises. This means not having to dig through multiple layers of rightclick menus, for example. Or in some cases not having your exit path blocked (a mining vessel close to an asteroid may not be able to warp to a station on the other side of that rock because it bumps into the asteroid while accelerating).
---
If your ship can cloak, then that's also a great escape method as long as you're aware of the limitations of a cloaking device.
---
&gt; I respected his sportmanship, we had some lols about other shit but I could not really figure out why someone with a massively equipped ship will just K.O.S a pilot in a lowly fitted Heron, who was not a threat - isn't that a bit of a RUST way of doing things? But that is another story I suppose.
---
Why did he do it? Because he could and because he wanted to. The answer isn't really more complicated than that. Eve is a game that doesn't force fair fights and allows anyone to engage anyone. This means that most fights will involve one party being considerably stronger (in ship types, numbers, or both) than the other.
---
An important tool is being able to ensure that you can force fights that you want to take and avoid fights that you don't want to take. Both ship modules and tactics can help with that. 
---
Man, long time gone already, still remember the days, all the cyno vigils and renamed outposts ... threw some money into the kickstarter for his kids. Sad story
---
They found these while roaming for fights/ganks. Most people don't go roaming for fights/ganks in blue space.
---
I will report any and all botters I have proof for, fx theese guys. I however do not pay attention to rorquals in eso when I spin my vni's since usually im out hunting for yours. But belive you me, if i find a blue bot its getting reported
---
&gt; Expecting a drop that we can’t take alone (7 small-gangers) we invited  our friends from cruisers crew who gladly came along for the fun 
---
But if you read further, you could easily deduce that they called friends from cruiser's crew. Plus, looking at the KB you can see the alliance isn't the same. Excellent detective work ;)
---
BoRn2ReIgN, more like BoRn2Cry
---
CAT. EARS. NOW.
---
"Bombres Bar" sounds like the Spanish division of Bombers Bar :)
---
I think Sotiyos and Keepstars should not have safety for supers.  I understand CCP's point that previously stations in nullsec wouldn't drop stuff and you had the option to sell or try to get a courier out.  You could never do that with supers however.
---
Its funny that you doubt the possibility of a group being evicted from lowsec when that is exactly what happened to you. Of course we didn't post about it on Reddit then because no one cared enough about your f-tier alliance eating shit. 
---
Its CCP, so Spring 2020 or 2021.
---
2420
---
We learned it from the English, blame them.  The royals may have caved to euro homogenization and adopted the metric system but Murica stands its ground.
---
Freedom units &gt; metric shitlers.
---
If we get a few FLEX structure by Spring 2020 we can be happy.
---
You organized it, interestingly. 
---
Just put the same moon on a single row and then on another sheet have the price pull done. Then SUM the row, And BOOM isk value of moon is displayed.
---
\*gasp\* who would suspect anyone would do this, in the year of our lord 2019
---
i don't really care about the narrative i just think you're a bad poster and you could stand to post less
---
If you field close to 200 people and you don't have 30 Dreads on Standby too, you are doing it wrong ...
---
most likely is, just enjoy it for now :)
---
The thing is, there is no way to enforce a ransom. You have to just trust them, and since there is almost certainly going to be no consequences for not honoring a ransom, and they will get a reward (roughly half your cargo) there is no reason for them not to kill you 
---
just hit that `block user` link m8, that's all you need to do
---
there's no way i'm going to stop posting because some upset child like you metaposts about it
---
 spaghetti code, the biggest lie CCP has ever sold.
---
Bless your heart, you magnificent bastards :-)
---
if you fly a super in 2019 you are such a goddamn poor, new meta is titans (haw nerf just means 2x titan numbers, no problem), bleeding edge is faction titan meta.
---
Check hydra out. They are pretty okayish at the game
---
I can't speak for elo, but I'd guess that's because this is all bullshit and no one in this thread really gives a shit about botters except insofar as they can be used to criticize your enemies.
---
Some mission runners are floating about in ludicrously expensive setups.
---
I heard they will be implemented the day after a lowsec stain gate, so soon.
---
Pretty sure using carriers for pvp is illegal
---
more titans than goonz ?
---
Google z-s overview. This is the most popular one though there are others. Setting it up is just clicking the links in the chat channel.

To everyone missing their kids, don't let this bot ruin the joke for you.

The mountain is named after the Corp from my understanding but yes.
---
I used a bling passive gila for t4 exotics and always died on karybdis. Never tried gammas, how much more comfortable are they?
---
If he had a criminal timer and jumped into high sec. He can't warp off so all he could do was decloak and install die. 
---
You can put make up on a pig but can't disguise the slam hog that is GOTG 
---
Curious about the capacitor implants and their affect on active armor to sustain reps...
---
This was a joke post. 
---
Top comment in the forum thread is right. Albiet the drone one shouldn't be damage, they should look into overall effectiveness by boosting speed, tracking, range etc by 15%
---
Small point Dark Taboo and Already replaced were there to shoot Theran     Which you should of known since you dropped on them before to protect Theran.  
---
A reminder to all that no matter how someone acts in their pixel spaceship, there's still (most likely) a real person on the other side.

Hate the character, not the player.

At least until the player proves to be an ass in real life.

---
The money in L4 missions is not im the payout or the bounties or the salvage. It's the LP. You blitz missions as fast as possible doing the minimum to complete each one and skipping slow ones, then take your LP to the store and buy mods to sell on the market.
---
Regular mining not worth in hisec, moon mining is gud.
---
Losing gilas is just a matter of not knowing how to navigate safely. The loot outweighs the losses (or you could skip the lowsec escalations). You could also just use a jackdaw and skip the higher escalations, or use a Stratios.
---
------
---
The only other usual, notable iskmaker in hisec is incursions. I know you said solo but it's really drop-in and drop-out. You'd have to be in a corp with no wardecs though so it'd be your alt probably.
---
But in all honesty, do what's fun for you. Different people have different ideas on what's fun. If you really want good isk/hr, paying real world money is probably a bil+ per hour of work.
---
Shields Slaves 50% shield buff         
---
^(ps. 50% shield ehp nerf on all shield supers and titans 2 weeks before introduction of the new implants)
---
Loss mail as at Planet 9 rather than a stargate.
---
If he got the criminal timer in HS then he can't have done it with that ship so there should be another ship showing on zkill.
---
What can give a criminal timer in Low-Sec? Suspect status sure but that doesn't Concord you. Low sec status which they've since used tags on (It's -0.something sec status now)? That's Faction Police.
---
Yeah, looks like it's going to be a cheap set that doesn't get used much. Maybe some Abyss Gilas to make up for the nerf they got?
---
&gt; images of frat botters
---
death 2 botters
---
&gt; images of goon botters

lol those images show nothing that's not botting and if it is mittani tells us not to report them to ccp anyway just tell your diplo he will handle it

never heard the term slam hog before what's it mean?

if you want to see the numbers. 
---
Yeah, but that'd be pretty dumb to just add a set that reverts a Nerf. 
---
Idk if rather have carrier/super pilots be forced to pick, more tank or better utility &amp; damage application for fighters. And same for other drone boat pilots like Ishtars, Mrymidons, Dominix, etc
---
You are about to get slammed with requests for access permissions...
---
Off course then should not be. But if you change the cyno you change more the just ratting caps calling in help 
---
You change drops. Dread drops titan an super drops. Bridging fleets in both normal an covert.
---
*Can't change one with out looking at the other.*
---
As for bomber's there in need off a look at them self's to many advantages. 
---
( Stealth warping, fast warp off, battle ship range, battle ship dps, small sig, Agile, high top speed, cheep, aoe damage - or aoe neut or aoe lock breaking,)
---
If 3 toons make P4 worth 150m in 3 days, the revenue per toon per day is just shy of 17m and not 50m.
---
Tbh was just third partying that time. Theran only came on my radar since their leader ran his mouth. 
---
It's an entire mountain range located on Caldari Prime, and the corporation is named after it :)
---
If it was damage, it'd probably be used for drive-by supers. Which could be interesting. I think fleet supers would still keep HP and ratting supers would likely keep warp speed for ticks. 
---
Yeah but then I would have to log in and do things.
---
He was using about 30 T1 procurers of which about 20 of them were sitting in space with no rocks to mine, about 10 of them were still mining spod and ejecting new cans and a sieged rorqual at the 0 point of the anomaly underneath a cloud of cans.  
---
My theory is that his bot broke and stopped tractoring and compressing the ore which is why there were 200 cans containing a total of 500 million worth of ore when he warped off because of downtime,.
---
"an indiscriminately promiscuous woman.

I thought my friends were nice girls, but after spending a few nights in their company at the night club, I discovered that they are in fact filthy slam hogs.

---
who leaked. was is Brisc.
---
How many people know about EVE there?
---
I mean TAPI line members were explicitly told to report botters by diplos and alliance leaders.
---
holy Walmart
---
faxed*.
---
wormholes are only good for krabbing and getting across the map (rolling static for roaming connections). other than that null is better unless u have some sort of masochism for scanning 10 minutes for even the most mundane shit you'd do in null with 2 clicks.
---
ccp doing something within 5 years of announcing it was coming?
---
must be an april fools joke
---
I thought is was an appropriate comment. Some dude crying on reddit about ccp isn't really going to change anything. But adapting to current meta will.
---
yes let's take a quick jaunt through legacy renter space and see what we can see, I'm sure it's full of hardworking miners and ratters plugging away 
---
every coalition has botters because it is _incredibly_ difficult to prevent. 
---
It's 2019. "Professional Active Clone Relocation Agent"
---
Someone is doing a lot of multiboxing and mining nothing. The OP is struggling to imagine why you would siege in an empty belt with a fleet of barges, and start ejecting cans everywhere.
---
build a wall and make China pay for it?
---
wait they did build a wall real and digital...dayum.
---
oops.
---
Fixed :D
---
not like this.
---
Indeed. I am ok with the more planable windows of attack on structures. But if you don´t fuel your stuff that is noone´s fault but your own. 
---
As gamma gives you +50% shield it makes your passive Regan and total ehp huge. I have had a Karybis in nearly every room once no issues.
---
Would never take passive to an exotic though. 
---
Even if its not assembled?
---
Eve Online works purely over IPV4 and standard TCP and UDP, obviously to play the game I don't. But Eve Online itself does not collect deep identifying data.
---
I was with them about a year ago I'd say they're def still trash and plenty of members have been banned for RMT. Not worth the drama to consider flying with them ever again
---
what if you get a special achievement or item for doing it.
---
LOL, did you call a CTA for all your 3 friends to upvote you? But i am not surprised that kiddies spitting swear words without knowledge and content getting upvoted while educated people staying factual &amp; polite get downvotes. 
---
iirc you can assemble and eject though getting that out of the system is gonna suck
---
neuting is the way of the triglav. adding more ewar would make it OP for the class. 
---
You are *really* tempting me to join up with you lot sometime soon! I can fly all 4 SB types.

he told Kotaku about it

What is your fit?

r/murderedbywords
---
Weird, my Chinese boots have standard black strings. 
---
Remote armor cycle speed ooooooh yes baby.
---
Need more sniper dread / carrier / t3 chemo.
---
Good luck for the last timer
---
April Fool’s Day pranks, CCP posted stuff on Hoboleaks
---
Now, this is the best i can do to help a poor botter out, he is prolly at work and dosnt know his bot broke down
---
Ah yes playing the racist card as China is a race and I brand all of China as botters and cheaters. 
---
What about the reverse of that, you use the ewar on your own logi to make the reduction on reps less.
---
You know you can run Eve in Windowed mode right?
---
&gt; If you get podded, you have to find your way back
---
this is both the biggest pain, and the easiest fixed when your established.
---
if your new, or in to small a corp(aka new to living in whs). getting podded can be insanely hard to get back in.
---
if your corp has been around a while and is established, they probably use websites to map hole connections, have people on at all hours to scan new routes back in, and can roll holes easily to make new connections.
---
Neato... Would ditch the napalm fire blasts coming out the lasts 2 tho... Look's pretty ridiculous and it becomes the focal point of those images. 
---
They need to upgrade their bot to the *Elo Knight Fraternity Edition* to avoid these kinds of problems in the future.
---
What's a good way for an Alpha to make their first billion isk?
---
I think you have it mixed up, storing your scaps in the XL array is the alternative.
---
True my dude. A bot is a bot. 
---
 \[ 2019.04.01 00:15:12 \] Psyk &gt; Hi local! how are we today... oh 
---
I like that guy
---
Id say so. Though if I had to guess, the moment they realized what dropped they pinged or logged a pilot then jumped everything they needed for it to get it extracted.
---
The longer you wait, the worse it will be.
---
There are rocks in the screenshot and the cans all have ore. This is jetcan mining. What do you not understand.
---
well, when they actually release the shield slaves we can estimate how long the flex structures will take
---
No.  I'm talking about new EWAR module.  Or re-tailoring something we already have, like making a targetted target spectrum breaker have a clear mechanic with a boosted effect and reduced fitting req's for triglav ewar ships.
---
Here’s the thing. You’re not entitled to carrier ratting. If you can’t field the needed resources to defend a ratting carrier in the event that it does get caught, you shouldn’t be ratting in a carrier. 
---
Thanks, I try 
---
Not for the person behind, they should be see through on all sides
---
🤔🤔🤔 
---
The thing is nobody can tank with a ratting carrier until help arrives. Maybe with a fax alt you can but it's too much complication for something that isn's insanely profitable.
---
The main problem is cloaky camping mechanics to be honest. 
---
No AFK mining/krabbing? Nahhh you can totally afk and ignore that new sig pop.....nothing bad will happen I swear
---
The guy was a close personal friend of pro-suicide spokesman The Mittani. Probably just as big of a fuckwad. You need some perspective. The guy wasn’t a hero of any kind. 
---
Botting means automated gameplay, replacing the need for humans to touch keyboard/mouse to gain an unfair edge in a video game. These guys are chinese, last I check that's the place on earth that has the highest density of humans, therefor the lowest need to replace players with bots, it could just be that what you find boring is what they find to be entertaining, I mean who knows, I sure don't
---
Shield invuls or base hp will have to be nerfed or noone will fly armor ever again when you can get more hp, speed and damage with shield ships.
---

Stating facts is racist ? Maybe you should educate yourself on China's gaming culture before you get on your high horse and call people dipshits to make you feel better about your empty life.

Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
So we can expect you to be outraged about the botters you are defending... when?
---
Sure. Variety is the spice of life. Hunters need targets.
---
I'm all about setting realistic expectations. Accept EVE for what it is and keep an open mind. Don't bring your RL emotional baggage to the game. In a universe of immortal capsuleers, understand that civilian morality is woefully unsuitable. And that nobody gets to be exempt just because he claims to be a non-combatant.
---
Self-described "nice" guys demand special treatment, have a disdainful and intolerant attitude toward other playstyles, characterize non-consensual PvP as sadistic, cast themselves as perpetual victims of unfairness, and generally carry around a huge chip on their shoulders. As a result they sometimes feel justified in being abusive toward other players.
---
If that's how they want to be, within the EULA, more power to them. If they want to role-play the butthurt loser, good for them. But by all outward appearances they are having a miserable time, hence the caution.
---
GM has been at local for a few times. Seem cannot find proof of botting so far.
---
LOL oh I know that feeling.  That why we were there the first time.  
---
The Hydra bonus is actually pretty sick, that's double the EHP bonus that a max Carrier skilled Nyx has. Aeons will still be underperforming for DPS, but if they have a few million EHP more and fighter HP that's double that of the Nyx's... they might actually be viable.
---
Still waiting to see how they'll rebalance shield supers/caps with the Shield Slaves, not sure if the Wyvern will be viable again or not. But my fears of the Hydra implant set being absolutely worthless seem to be unfounded now.
---
Jesus Apirl 1st

Which means the real shield slave would never come

Thank you for the grammar assistance and education.

&gt;the most of their botters/rmt'ers gathered in FRT and goons while the smaller bot corps have nested in renters and other alliances.
---
Says the alliance that harbored KWG for years proven to be a bottling ring all the while receiving massive "rent" from it. And before the Chinese the Russians in DRF and XIX were thought to be the biggest offenders also in legacy space. So yes it is the pot calling the kettle black here. Goons have also been shown to harbor tons of bots, if you look at pest control super kills the majority are proven bots. 
---
I agree that botting is bad and all bots should die. But this framing it as primarily a FRT issue is ludicrous. 
---
It all depends on development time as far as I know. There is really no pattern to when new ships are released for different factions, besides with events or content based around that faction.
---
Lol! Nice reference to eve from something irl. Have an upvote and enjoy the gold.

Why you left one modification slot empty?

Also, if the shown dps is with fury ham, your fit is in a borderline dangerous spot

About the alignment while standing still:
---
One important thing that's not obvious is that it doesn't matter where your ships nose is looking at while standing still. 
---
If you stand still and hit the warp button the direction doesn't matter. Imagine yourself as a sphere. If your destination is in front of you or behind or below doesn't matter it takes the same time to get into warp. This only works while standing still. 
---
Therefore: while hacking in a fast aligning ship like a heron, standing still is safer than orbiting the can. 
---
When you orbit and someone lands on you and you hit warp to a random direction chances are that Target is not in front of you. So you have to slow down, change direction and get to speed. You have now doubled your time to get into warp and are probably dead by then. 
---
Sure if you are ultra elite you can use your orbit speed to get faster into warp at the direction of travel provided something is actually there to warp at. For that to be beneficial you need split second reaction times and know your shit. Only feasible for cruisers or bigger. In frigate it's likely that you just screw yourself over 
---
Sadly not, it was a haw nag used to deter us from dropping them i guess
---
Aligning in this case just means being pointed towards your intended safespot or celestial.  Align to object then stop your drive.  Your ship will remain oriented but will be stationary.
---
Much of the delay inherent in a warpout is the act of getting your ship pointed in the right direction.  Pre-aligning removes this part of the escape delay.
---
I love how much WANGS tries to pretend like they aren't a snuff pet but everybody knows better.
---
But if its low power that usually means it's out of fuel, right?
---
When am I gonna make a self-aggrandizing /r/eve post in order to publicly declare how against bots I am while simultaneously doing nothing about it? Probably tomorrow. I want to fit in around here, after all. Nothing is worth doing unless everyone can see me doing it!

Oh yeah, FW space is still fun to roam around. 
---
Sad I used to fly with tvp and it was pretty funny most of the times.

Are renters even allowed to anchor a kipstar?

Oh! I thought they bought it and named it after themselves like some kind of stadium. Thanks for clearing it up!

well it becomes a big deal when great mechanics in the game are portrayed as being op in this echo chamber that is reddit... imagine ccp would listen to this crap?
---
Pretty sure he's asking about FOB's that we're mentioned at vegas
---
Yes. But I think it would make sense for a mechanic to exist that builds in a high-level of vulnerability to unattended structures. As it is, you end up with tons of derelik structures in low power owned by defunct corps.
---
Passive align is not a thing, you have to be moving for alignment to be of value.  Your ship in the code is actually just a single point in space, so the direction the model is facing is irrelevant.   When you're already aligned and moving toward a thing you will enter warp faster.   If you're full speed aligned you will basically instantly enter warp once you hit the button.
---
im laughing at your attempt to control a narrative many months later, not that Holesale got evicted by ravens that weren't even seeded a year ago.

This is assuming you run fighter hp implants instead of amulets on your armor super.

It can replace direct SP addition to charactes like when you got 250k SPs to character with most SPs on account. This way you could choose target character.

This is how they work I used to see several in my part of space mining ice.
---
I run and pay for 8 Omega rooms that I use to mine and build.  I don’t mine to buy plex my resources support other things.
---
All 8 of my toons have a well thought out name and I don’t use software....I’m just Alt - Tabbing dumping to Orca and have hauler as well.
---
You can tell the bots because it’s just random garbage names.  They also use several groups all over the belt shitting cans everywhere and the Orca tractors each one in or uses MTU.
---
It’s total BS humans done mine this way and trust me I know I’ve been a carebear since 2003.
---
Humans fleet mining sit or orbit the Orca dumping to fleet and use hauler.
---
Neither of those seem to have worked reliably

Most rental rules only allow astra's and raitarus rest rental priced if included

As it currently is in w-space a low powered structure can be killed as quickly as 10-14hrs (12+/- 2hrs)

I could see that being better than no RF timer. I agree on the asset safety though.

If the thing isnt fully functioning the "safety" feature shouldn't either

I don't really like snuff, but I can respect their ability to hold their own against numerically superior enemies. They are good at what they do.

Could it not also be 3 individuals with bad communication between them who are also busy looking at netflix? I mean mining isn't exactly APM intensive

I think its tradition for Fozzie to post on Apr1 with real notes as a troll to the internet
---
nice flair bait dude...
---
taking intel from zkill is obviously the easiest but a killmail doesnt really tell the story does it?
---
most of the shit on that br are probably ships that dropped after the thing died (go ahead and check the timestamps) and not all the hk friends are on that mail since there wasnt a real fight on that final timer and there was no interest in being on that mail since its insignificant really. They had a muninn fleet do hole control and a raven fleet on the fort (math says thats 2 fleets).
---
I think people are jumping in this because of frat's "stance" on botting. It's one thing to have botters but if you are against botters but still harbor them it just screams hypocrisy.
---
Thanks. Is there a trick to probing? That seems to be my main bottle neck.
---
You cannot fucking seriously just have pulled an uniornic "BUT MITTANI WITH THE WIZARD HAT" about someone else, can you? Seriously?
---
That actually sounds nice. 
---
Are we really though? We don't do much together, expect maybe the guys camping in tama. We don't own some sort of buffer zone in null for them. And we don't pay any isk to them.
---
Afaik were mainly allies so we can supplement their ustz sub cap numbers.
---
Obviously they're the far stronger alliance but I never felt like being used by them. 
---
It's questionable on a Nyx, but the built in resists on the Aeon offer a lot. One of the big reasons why its not viable in fights is because of the lack of fighter HP which means that an Aeon's fighters get mulched super easily. When BL had a super fight against Siberian Squads last fall, our Nyxes were doing very well while by the end of the fight the Aeons were almost out of fighters and running half filled squadrons at times.
---
Sure, you will lose out on about 3k max dps compared to the Nyx, and bananas of armor EHP if you swap for Hydras. But if you do use Hydras compared to Amulets, you'll be getting double the raw fighter EHP of a Nyx with 10% higher EHP and (most importantly) higher resists as well since you wont be able to FAX wall to save supers 100% of the time now.
---
We'll see how it hashes out but if these numbers stay constant I think it wont be just "Only Amulets in your super pod" for armor supers. There will be serious pause for thought when considering what to do.
---
&gt; but if they have a few million EHP more and fighter HP
---
They’ll be exchanging amulet armor bonus for the fighter HP bonus. Iirc the EHP differences between the Aeon and the Nyx weren’t so large as to make amulets unnecessary.
---
Hmm, I don’t - the grr lowsec doesn’t effect me as a small gang / solo player, other than my poor Astra last year. So no, snuff to me seem to be doing a lot of “big scale” stuff now that they’ve left the imperium, attacking some groups who are long overdue for a crushing. 
---
Yup. I hate that TEST has indeed been harboring that cancerous entity called KWG but what can I do as a simple grunt? I cannot attack them as I'd get booted out of the alliance. I cannot spy on them gets me booted and while I can report them it would take months for the bots to get banned. Had some chats a couple months ago with some TEST vets/higherups about the issue that we're harboring bots and they simply just said: "Well, if we'd kick them out they'd just go to our enemies." 
---
The only way to get rid of bots is to deny them space to rat/mine in. If all the nullsec alliances would have a treaty where is written that they will enforce laws against botting and deny any person/corp that has been botting in the past to obtain renting/nullsec rights. Have the alliances patrol around and investigate botting suspicion (can easily be done with a alt in a noobship, you sit cloaked in the site with the bot and see what it's reaction is when said alt comes in system). 
---
Would be nice to see a treaty like that to ever come in existence but  in reality this would have a 0.0000001% chance ever to become a real thing. Just like IRL without hatred and crime. 
---
im just being honest and the only reason i even commented on shit here is cause people are trying to influence public opinion on a mechanic thats great for the game by giving shitty examples like dead fortizars like this one
---
&gt;We are not currently planning any changes to shield supercapital hitpoints to go with these changes, although the upcoming remote rep diminishing returns are expected to somewhat reduce the relative strength of shield supers since they are somewhat less suited to dual tanking. We’ll be keeping a close eye on things and making changes if needed.
---
This better be the 1. of april joke. 
---
having just recently dealt with someone doing this, no cyno isn't the issue, it's that you're in dead space and you cant probe or warp to anything. the guy that did it in my space was over 2000km from the warp in point, and would just warp off as soon as you got to within 500km of him and setup a new site. 
---
heh, wait till you get a TCRC or NRF wall. it speeds up alot
---
Sure thats a more reasonable explanation, but since its Frat they must be botters -reddit logic
---
Will the rapture sets apply to Capitals as well?
---
2:1 and you almost lost... booshing is so op! :D
---
Usually no, though their overlord will most likely anchor the Keep for them, should they provide it.
---
takes a few hours to burn there and place it, too.
---
 Actually ***æffect*** is now used for simplification and to avoid improper grammar.
---
Some people’s brains will never reconcile this. 
---
^ - TNT aren't exactly on good terms with us... and they didn't get on many ship kills, however, they got shot at by GOTG and they did shoot the citadel. GOTG also shot Already Replaced...
---
how is this unclear?
---
People are jumping in on this because it fits a very clean narrative. Frat has chinese players. Chinese players are obviously all botters (let's just ignore the huge Chinese population in Goons, or R-R - only Frat's chinese players are botters). Ergo, Frat is bad. 
---
Meanwhile, every renting alliance is chock-full of botters. Goons themselves are chock-full of botters. Botters do everything in this game. I'd wager that VNI bots are more common than actual players in VNIs ratting. The issue is not frat's "stance" on botting (which, by the way, is to report them). The issue is that we as a playerbase generally only care about botting when we can score political points by revealing it.
---
Amulets won't be unnecessary, but Aeons may become more viable than Nyxes for more direct fleet combat. A major thing that is hampering them right now is that the lack of a dedicated fighter bonus makes the hull very resilient but its application in a fleet very subpar. If these numbers stay constant, fighter EHP that is twice that of a Nyx will need to be seriously considered since that is a hefty bonus; not to mention that the innate resists on an Aeon over a Nyx will make the decreasing FAX rep application more powerful on them than ever.

Oh he ran his mouth alright. Not just smack talk either, evil shit. Fuck that cunt.
---
so when your in the 40 man fleets running HQs. theres 3 types of HQs
---
TPPH is the one where its 3 rooms, and you kill the tower in last room after all enemies dead. its the longest site, and the easiest due to not as many enemies on grid at once.   normal speed is 15 to 20 minutes per
---
NRF is the room where its jsut one room, no killing the tower, just kill the waves of enemies.  its in the middle for length. usually 12-15 minutes.  
---
TCRC is the fast one, but deadly, you go in, kill osmons.  and start shooting the tower.   but because of all the waves of enemies. logi need to be on point or people die.   WTM has done these in as little as 8 minutes,  with average time being 10-12 (depending if we went in with full fleet and MTAC is on time)
---
in short, you want to do as many TCRCs and NRFs.  as few TPPHs.   but you gotta do TPPHs to open up space for TCRC and NRFs to spawn
---
Yes, exactly this. I remember them mentioning a drilling platform concept or something similar to that. Also a small engineering complex and FOB.
---
A nibble perhaps
---
wow, a thing that's been being used since the mechanic came out and was only fixed or labelled an exploit once it came to reddit
---
b-but guys make sure to submit a bug report!
---
In fairness, an aeon can do almost exactly what these implants do with a lower loss of HP. If you fit 2x drone HP rigs you get 50% fighter HP, but the gap comes down to only 2m EHP behind the nyx as opposed to 4 (based on the fit I’m using at least).
---
jetcan mining ..... using a bot program.  What do you not understand?
---
Yeah but in much better shape than cva
---
Agreed. its getting really bad.
---
They gonna fix injectors?
---
Do you miss Counter-Strike All Chat? Visit lowsec today!

He did offer free R32 moons for everyone. It was nice making 200mil / hour with 2 barges, being the only one mining them half the time.

15 micro jump dessies and a badger, takes like 20 seconds
---
u can bring same 15 mjdessies and jump a pvp ship onto the ess lol
---
wormhole space is a thing, if you want cyno-free combat so bad go check that shit out
---
Microjump Dessies are allowed only by the people who placed it there, definitely not for anyone else. Cmon wally, this was an unfixable exploit and needed to be squashed! fucking cheater hackers.

They should make ALL implants only affect subs, lmao

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2eZmodJvNo - Fantastic video on scanning. The video will teach you the basics and from then on out it's just practice. I do recommend buying Sisters Core Scanner Probes (the ammo, not the launcher). The launcher is nice but a little much on a ship that can't use a covert ops cloak. The probes themselves are well worth the cost vs the bonus they give.

Awesome thank you

He died in the American embassy attack in libya, so that therefore makes him a hero to most americans cause “dae person killed doing something for america literally needs to be honored like a god”

I know this is a hill you're prepared to die on, but there are a thousand things Eve needs more than a lowsec gate to Stain.
---
Now I'm interested
---
Uuu so cool. 
---
Goes to replicate. 
---
Damn my Slave set.
---
Yeah, I just checked. My fit with 3x 25000mm plates on the Aeon with 2x Durability rigs instead of trimarks and assuming slaves placed it higher than the Nyx by ~4million EHP with links. Dropping the plate, keeping the slaves and the rigs sees it lag behind the Nyx by about ~2.5m EHP.
---
These are all Pyfa numbers of course, and are not guaranteed to be anything more than theorycrafting. If it is being beaten out by 2x durability rigs, that's a pretty troubling thing and I would hope CCP would adjust that so it is more competitive.
---
Pls no make Aeons viable again
---
I was telling everyone not to put it on reddit.
---
Triglavian ship line is powerful enough, leave your idea to other precursor ships
---
A spool-up resistance dampener (lowers the resistances of the target over time) comes to mind. 
---
Would be strong against caps / supers and kind of fit into their "punch-above-your-weight-class" philosophy. And we need more exploding supers anyway ;)
---
was it me?
---
Didn't know this. We just assumed and F1'd to kill them. Since we obviously couldn't fuck with those refitting like champs Machs 
---
When other alliances complained to GM they got made fun of on Reddit, then people put down ESS in delve and voilà!
---
But setting up ESS in a fully deployed site is acceptable...
---
I know its not a DB change and therefore CCP does not have the resources to do it... but maybe don't allow the ESS in any annom..
---
Be sure to kill lots of miners so they won't kick you from corp. :)

Oh and do the trials! XD

With these implants (if nothing else gets changed) Komodo becomes the absolute king of EHP in the game. Not that it's useful for anything else, but still... Neat.
---
I mean, there is an implant that makes your drones go faster, i personally like using that one
---
Maybe he'll get our schedules...
---
I dont even know what this means?  By f-tier alliance are you referring to to the one (shit first) that had to bat phone the Chinese to even break even on a fight?
---
if you think the idea of shooting some random stranger seems inconsistent with your normal way of thinking, perhaps life in Providence is for you.  The Alliances that inhabit Providence live by a different code, we roll with "not red, do not shoot" rules, which means we only shoot guys we know to be trouble makers.  To be fair, that is indeed MOST of the groups in the game, but that's becuase MOST groups in the game come to Providence once in a while looking for a fight.  
---
The alliances that make up the Providence region are the biggest, strongest, most organized NBSI coalition in all of New Eden.  If NBSI sounds like your jam, come check us out.
---
Just a casual 53% bonus to shield capital EHP. No other changes necessary...

I sure hope that other factions get new ships with time. Hoping for a SoE destroyer.

it bothers me that you rgb coded the lasers the wrong direction
---
Goons don't hold a stance that they will ban and kill their own botters. Frat does. And if Frat is serious about rooting out botters from their alliance they are doing a shit job of it. Or more realistically it is only a facade so they can try to appeal to more Western groups.

Meanwhile Goons are still making use of "bubbletrap NPCs at the NPC station undock" mechanic to render blood raider structures highly unusable by hostiles at the lowest effort cost.
---
NPCs even get stuck in the station model, become untargetable and do not move (yet call for more NPCs) so you can't pull them away from the bubble. But GM's say this is "working as intended".

why would you not just buy a nyx in the first place tho
---
Salty much? CCP recently said they found it interesting how players are using good srandings with diamond rats to their advantage and even liked the innovation. It's probably here to stay. The only broken thing is where you get a br ship stuck in the model. People have bubble camped stations for years. The only difference is that it's diamond rats raping you instead of players. 
---
Plus, your problem has s solution. Grind standings with br and they won't shoot you anymore. Even with just om e character. That would allow you to kill the bubble trapping you and voila, problem avoided. 
---
But I guess grinding standings would take away from your precious booshing for all of a day. Oh no, whatever will you do. The big bad goonies are just a bunch of meanies who abuse easily avoided mechanics.

There still have some ways to do this without seeker investigation sites but just need some more effort, just wait CCP fixing this one and see you soon little mad bee.

Please send 99'420'069 isk to the corp "EvE-Scout" TOMORROW, thanks. (it won't get on the [list](https://www.eve-scout.com)  today
---
Sorry for undocking lol
---
Already Replaced. was there to shoot Theran/Darkness, and a lot of us used to be in GotG until Sort struck "The Deal". Got to see some familiar faces on grid this time on the opposite end of the guns. 
---
Who ever taught me how to pvp must not have taught me how to fit a carrier
---
check your head, elmo.
---
you were in yulai when we got evicted the last time.
---
rounon decided yulai should abandon provi and sell it's structures.
---
you came back with a bunch of people but had to face suspicion.
---
you decided to leave.
---
from what a line member can say, you left because you lacked stamina (leet speek), read "you were tired of getting punched" all the time. which is fine. just state the real reasons; nobody's gonna blame you for that. but stop blaming EQ, after selling fortis to the invaders. :&gt; yulai's legacy died with this action.
---
I have to get back to 0.0 man high sec local is like a demilitarized zone.
---
Miss stuff like this.
---
Who wants me?
---
If you’re aware of any bots in TEST, hit me up and they’ll be dealt with. We have a firm ‘report ASAP to CCP and alliance leadership’ policy, and I take great delight in killing bots when they’re found.
---
Like what? It all blurrs behind aegis, which we did get. Not that i'm too happy about it still.
---
Pizza and actual beer instead of that piss you call Corona
---
so, selling blue fortis to invaders isn't considered [treacherous](https://www.dict.cc/englisch-deutsch/treacherous.html)? i'm sorry that most of the remaining bloc still is disappointed by yulai after this move. 
---
Based on what metrics/standards of analysis?
---
No just mine beside them
---
Eve is dead?
---
[Uuh, you should check again](https://i.imgur.com/wElPK4L.png)
---
Fixed :)
---
I've been running trio hawks since they came out. Much more isk, less risk, no need for expensive implants + can run them with a friend when j don't want to multi-box. 
---
I also do think I have an authority to speak on the Gila though. I've had some of the worst spawns in a t5 including starving + tangling + renewing leshaks, a similar setup but with vedmaks + damavik which is more dangerous and many other dangerous combinations. I've completed at least 80 abyssal t5s in a Gila and only once or twice dipped down to the danger point. 
---
If you had a good fitting it was probably your target primarying then. Also blue pill and hard she'll will save your life. 
---
I do know that there are death waves. Don't get me wrong but if you know how to handle them then they are not death waves. 
---
Also, a cerb in a t5 is going to have similar problems to the Gila. If you don't kill the ships in a death wave in the correct order or quick enough you will still fail and die in a fire. 
---
Rough guidelines. Be able to tank 1200 dps. Have blue pill and hard she'll I'm your hold. Do at least 800 dps and have neut resistance in the form of eother cap battery or injector. 
---
1. FUCK NYXES
---
2. You need amulets in the Nyx to survive, hydras offer more flexibility and give some impressive viability to Aeons again
---
There is no idle alignment or pre-aligning.  The only thing that matters is the velocity and vector you are moving (or lack therof)
---
It’s pretty funny how you were using this to your advantage in killing my bubbles before I had standings. Now that I developed good Blood Raider standings and can defend the bubbles without fear of diamond rats you REEEEEEEEEEEEE REEE REEEEEEEE REEE REEE MUH MJD DESTROYERS all over Reddit. 
---
Yet another hypocritical Olmeca bitch post, nothing to see here you can move along.
---
Awww,  don't be so harsh on them. Looks like good clean fun.
---
i, too, believe i'm owed the ability to perform game exploits
---
I was responding to his statement that he lost a Gila in a t4. Not saying s Gila can do darks. Never do a dark on your gila
---
Russian corporation turbo blobs active C5 pvp Corp and posts it expecting a positive response...

still wrong

Was really hoping for more Screetching comms but unfortunately everything was pretty clean. Looking forward for the next.
---
uh, dunno about other space but test space is filled with vni multiboxers.  not botting so much as barely paying attention to run 6 clients.
---
 This idea is known to the devs wether they'll make it happen is up to them.
---
The mechanics of FW might be broken, but if you're just looking for fun and fights, it's the place to be.
---
Are you illiterate or just didn’t read the details?
---
I can’t take screen shots on this old computer, idk why
---
If you know of any bots in Test, let me know and they’ll be dealt with. And I’m sure you do know of some, because you wouldn’t imply there are bots without evidence, as that would be foolish.
---
look man if you want to get risk free ratter kills (Everyone knows that 700 DPS cruisers can't defend themselves) you need to JUST ADAPT and BRING MORE FRIENDS so you can SEED DREADS and kill a ratting supercarrier that's ALREADY REPLACED.
---
I just saw an Arbitrator on scan in my system a day ago and of course he was at a safe. He had finished a data site and was AFK (or focused on probing). Yes. It was a t1 fit exploring arbie lol
---
Killed him. Took his measly 10m of junk loot. Sent an EVE mail with some advice.
---
Was it worth it? Well I mean, loot is loot. Plus, it could have been bait, and a potential fight to be had!
---
Tuskers are legit cool pvpers. I've learned a lot fighting them in delve. You could prob learn a lot about small gang with/from them 
---
Well, judging by the lack of any phrasing indicating that any deadspace counts it's not an exploit unless it's a seeker investigation site. the second room of a DED site probably works just fine. Bonus points if it's a Sansha 10/10 where you have to burn 20km under a 75% web to get to the second gate.
---
Are they fucking stupid?
---
[Dracvlad](https://forums.eveonline.com/u/dracvlad/summary) knows. He's one of them. He's been advocating nerfs to highsec PvP for many years.
---
Find a corp, preferably in WH space.  Stay away from the blue donut.
---
People that takes pictures of computer screens should be banned from ever using technology again.
---
"You have been banned from R/Eve for your inability to take a proper screenshot"
---
The wall didn't keep the mongols out but at least brings in tourism now so I guess they won in the long run
---
yes you can. 
---
Because no game mechanic has changed in the slightest over the past many years that has made it easier to mine the materials to build supers and titans and have the pilots to fly such ships...
---
Started a new corp and allaince that will run NPSI fleets with free ship hand outs
---
https://discord.gg/ZpE9ZYp this is our discord we will send a ping out hour before fleet all welcome to join
---
I mean alright, would you happen to know how to take a screen shot on a chrome book?
---
This is a much more helpful answer thank you
---
http://lmgtfy.com/?q=chromebook+screenshot
---
Could just link to the image http://www.verite.space/maps/influence/influence.png
---
Ahh, this is what you mean.
---
Oh well
---
Have you ever tried 2 t2 drone durability rigs and armor slaves? I bet these would provide much more benefit than configuration you're proposing. 
---
Thanks but I think it’s disabled for my school’s chrome book, none of those shortcuts or quick keys don’t work
---
Damn, thanks for posting this lol so fun xDDD. High quality post hahaha. Lol lmao. Very good
---
Jesus Christ that must have been a rough passing
---
try wormhole space.. there is no local so it's WAY safer.  use your heron's scan bonuses to scan down a wormhole and just go nuts exploring them.  o/
---
You assumed it's species!
---
well, all toons there so far are 13 days in corp, I don't know, but it smells like its the same individual jetcan mining in 30 t1 barges
---
Join a Corp. any corp. probably a large newbie corp like Horde where there’s no interview or anything, they just accept you. But there’s also karmafleet, dreddit, etc. They’re all the same so just pick which team you want to root for and apply. Even though you’ve been playing for years, just join the low barrier to entry newbie corps. When you get accepted into corp get all your services setup ASAP - particularly important are Discord and whatever voice comms they use. Finally, fly to your new home, jump in a ship, get in standing fleet comms, and say hi. You’ll make friends in no time and discover a whole new side to Eve.
---
the rapid missile nerfs weren't implemented tho
---
Yes. Things have an effect on other things, by affecting them.
---
Not many NPCs sell certain items and many of the buy and sell orders are awful, but it does seem like a challenge. If you wanna do it go ahead! Kudos to you if you can get to flying a battleship or something with it.
---
Apparently the New Player Experience just has people go down to Delve so they can join goons faster, makes sense to me
---
Yeah I agree. Everyone knows 'slave = armour' and while that doesn't make sense either, it will be super confusing to have slave mean a different thing. Call them 'Tribute' or something else with a slavey theme.
---
Full disclosure, while Provi corps won't shoot neuts, there are plenty of people that like flying around Provi that have no scrupples about shooting anything and everything.  It's not a magic safe space.  :-)
---
So, we see ourselves more as white hats, and once in a while we save some poor schmuck that's getting ganked.  And we'll try to avenge him when we can't save him.
---
What I would do if I were you is start running lowsec DED sites for money, then use the money from that to get ships you enjoy flying. This may take some investment, and you could require frigates, dessies, and t3cs to do all of the ones you find. However, its much more fun than standard mission running or belt ratting imo 
---
Wait, is it a second or a third year in row where they post completely serious devblog with on 1st april?
---
Your pod shouldn't look like that, have you considered shifting to a cheeto free diet
---
Except, you know, when sig matters.  Like any subcapital fight against caps.
---
Really cool idea!
---
Is that a real question, the answer is obviously yes
---
I'm actually trying (sort of) to do something like this. For example, I am currently collecting minerals and PI to create my own athanor, and I have started buying rig BPOs to produce my own T1 and T2 rigs. I am planning on continuing to expand my operations over time. The main issue is that mining is extremely boring and I think that is going to be the bottle-neck for my activities. That said, frigates and modules don't use many minerals, so it might not be too bad. Obviously there are some things that will be very hard to get reliably, like faction/pirate ships and modules for example. In those cases I've still been buying stuff, but I could see getting away from that.
---
They are taking steps to that already.
---
20% rorq mining nerf and ~7% barge yield buff with the boosts.

Ah, there it is. Now I can masturbate again.
---
This is very simple. Bots in Delve are not okay. Bots not in Delve are not okay. All you nullseccers are playing political games with botting, making a big scene about it when your enemies get caught doing it and pretending it's not a thing or deflecting when we talk about it in your area of space.
---
&gt;lowly fitted Heron, who was not a threat 
---
Yea in Eve you cant judge if a ship is a threat or not just by its hull, most things can fit a cyno, and plenty of people bait with a defenseless looking ships mostly barges and haulers, but often exploration frigs too.  https://zkillboard.com/kill/75972343/

An anomaly is nothing like a portable deadspace pocket you can deploy anywhere.

Am a dev and did some opengl stuff, so it makes sense. Just don't want it too, Eve was so real before I thought about this :|
---
TIL having to grind standings to do pvp just to clear your bubble works for my advantage.
---
VERITE YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO PUT ROTE KAPELLE ALL OVER 😭
---
Attacks when they know other corp is deployed in mass out of hole.  
---
24hr hole control with a 144 pilots on the fort kill  
---
a ragerolling team that only got a connect off hours at the end containing 80% of the residents of said hole  
---
Tactically okay, kinda shitty but whatever we know inner hell doesn't fight for content only for profit, thats your M.O. so do you  
---
Creating a reddit post pretending the defenders had numbers to do anything and you didnt go in like a burglar once the fambam left...  
---
Tactically poor choice.
---
Who did not do it, at some point ?
---
Thanks everyone for the replies and help here, that was awesome. Going to make myself available to be blown up tonight again. See you in  0.4 - where I am stuck :-)
---
i really gotta ask at this point with all these active corp evictions going on
---
who are you people going to fight if you empty out wspace? 
---
just putting it out there because it really makes me think
---
I don't see which part is deviating from intended use.
---
Broken on not, deadspace on demand is retarded.
---
&gt; Attacks when they know other corp is deployed in mass out of hole.
---
As much as I hate Inner Hell, Stranger Danger royally fucked up and paid the price. They've been in wormhole space for a long time, and their CEO said most of their players don't have alts because they're 'casual' then went on to say that on average each member has 2 capitals? 
---
If you don't have alts even if it's alphas you can inject when needed in your hole, you fucked up.
---
If you deploy all of your mains on an op leaving your home undefended, you fucked up. 
---
Best way to get a bug fixed, is still to make its use widespread enough.
---
Excel Role Play, common mistake.
---
NPCs weren't intended to permacamp these stations, even barring the possibility of warping to an instant undock. And CCP didn't intend to give players power to shut down a station by bubbling it and going afk.
---
Computer jokes!
---
Using the starter tutorial to interfere with pvp in any way should be illegal.
---
What happens if you start one of these a few thousand kilometer off a citadel before an incoming fight?
---
Inner Hell don't care, they don't take fights in wormhole space other than ganks. 
---
Scanning - OMG scanning.  A couple guys that love scanning and have maxed out skills and ships will be able to scan down the chain in 1/10 the time you can and will do so, then bitch constantly about others not scanning enough.

Rorquals are balanced, skills injectors are what made them OP in the sense that everyone have one. 
---
Your ship is not just a single point in space. Your ship is a single point in space AND a velocity vector.
---
The second point is where people have trouble with passive aligning. They assume that the velocity vector always specifies a direction, which is true **unless** the magnitude is 0 (ie your speed is 0 (ie you aren't moving)).
---
As we all know, a vector only has magnitude 0 when all of its scalar components are 0 (under every norm). And if all the scalar components are 0 we can't be "pointing" any where, thus there is no "passive aligning".
---
Right, because this is definitely the most egregious abuse of this mechanic.
---
its one thing to have botters in renter alliance and a whole diff to have them in YOUR alliance. but hey just a thought
---
https://www.google.com/search?q=eve+ess
---
Didn't you guys evict BTLH horizon because they were evicting people?
---
As strangers CEO I completely agree on half of your points.
---
We have a active player base of around 30 actual people and are open to people of almost any sp level 
---
Being out the hole was a mistake. Especially as we knew Innerhell have been around (when local broke we even could see them in local) but since this has been a thing since before Christmas we refused to sit still and just 'turtle' the buildings are just that. Pixels in a video game. A game were here to play not sit in a hole doing nothing.
---
We had ALOT of caps. We know we arnt as big as the big dogs but we try to fight what and when we can and have nothing but positive interactions with as many folk as we can ( something im glad to say ended up with hundreds of players in fleets rolling for our home) 
---
We knew from the beginning of time that solo we can't match a 100+ man fleet and even if we had people in home would rely on a break out in the late ru.
---
But. The injection to capitals is almost definitely more isk that most of our members even had to 'save' the cap stash was in event of a connection we wanted to make sure we had ships to give out. (Something so so many corps fail to do and friends arrive with nothing to fly).
---
Lastly I want to say gf to Innerhell. They have their play style and we have ours. It sucks we were out but that's a burden we accepted when we leave. Were neither salty or angry. It's a video game and everything can be replaced.
---
To all the guys rolling for us your efforts were insane and I can't thank you enough. We will return to a wormhole near you and we will be there to fight and live same as always. We lived for 11 months in a c5 and enjoyed every day it was certainly better than the 12 months in our original C4. And I personally feel we've done great for the two years we have been around.
---
See you all in space guys 07 and remember good or bad. It's only pixels in a game! 
---
reminder that an eviction doesnt mean that the evicted corp can rebuild
---
I mean inner hell usually doesn't take fights in wspace outside of ganking people
---
so they don't care lmao.
---
GSM working to get things fixed for you
---
The only out I can think of is that CCP also previously announced they are re-designing shield regen modules. Maybe they are making changes they expect will hurt shields in those areas? I don't know.

" The initiator of the attack was the corporation "BTLH". Calling their own composition of 40-50 pilots, their own English-speaking alliance and allies in the form of an alliance "Holesale Operations", they attacked and completely destroyed the home system of the little "Duckling Union" alliance.
---
Link to the battle: [https://zkillboard.com/related/31002262/201902142000/](https://zkillboard.com/related/31002262/201902142000/)
---
And the management of the "Inner Hell" decided to conduct a special operation. The purpose of which was to put the corporation "BTLH" in the framework of norms and order."
---
Deployable structures with a system-wide warpable beacon that collect ratting bounties and pay out more than they collect, unless they are stolen from.
---
The exploit was that people were anchoring them in places that made them nearly impossible to steal from.
---
Just one tiny gripe. We were not holding of for friends, but were trying to get our own pilots back in. yes thats still our fault, fair point, but it is missleading to say we were avoiding a fight because we wanted friends in. of course this is an absolutely valid tactic and we were actually trying to do just that, but more importantly we were trying to get our **own** pilots in. we simply didnt have enough pods in hole to form a real defense at peak times, hence why 2 breakout attempts at night time. It is a damn shame too because that would have been a monumental fight, and i am very disapointed by myself that i was part of those massive lack of pods in home.
---
Remember kids, all the caps in the world do no good if you dont have pilots to fly them. SD. has learned their lesson, and you will see us around very soon :)
---
0 shittalk from InHe whatsoever, very professional. 10/10 eviction, used our weakness to their full advantage, as you should do when evicting someone. 10/10 would shoot festival launchers from my Azbel at your fleet again.
---
Spirit in corp is great. Were memeing the shit out of each other, and overall people are excited to mess up some place in Eve again once the dust settles. Expect to see us back, cruising around, headbutting every bait we find.
---
Killing unsuspecting newbros was an Eve thing way before rust.
---
Cloaking off a relic site is legit one of my personal favorite things to do in game. 
---
Damn they're good. It only took them 3 years to LITERALLY copy and paste the armor slave numbers to shield.

Thats the true spirit right here. I wish you the best for your next adventures. SD you are gud bois.

this is why i have no sympathy for ccp

Worst ISK/EUR ever

Its pretty sad that people even have to ask this.  The current devs repeatedly show they don't understand their own game, and only narrowly avoid catastrophes (when they even do) due to mass player outrage over pants-on-head retarded decisions.  When they don't listen, we get things like the original rorq and skill injectors.
---
agreed. will be adressed in one way or another. we wont be giving up our casual style, but there are measures regardless we can take. i can say this as i was very much part of the problem (2/3 accs in hs due to rl shit)
---
Whole heartedly push for a corp that tries for nothing but fun. It's hard and people best you down. Your too 'casual' you could do this or that better. But they all forget were just playing a fake pixel game 😅
---
Our corpies are some of the best and I've never stayed up till 7am watching assets burn and laughed so hard on coms with our fellow allies across all of j space. 
---
That said when I thought of spring cleaning the hanger.... I didn't quite mean all of it hahahaha
---
Are you sure? I'm not a low-sec person but I thought low-sec stuff just gave you suspect timers? Because low-sec is where they lost that scimi.
---
I could see planet 9 have a clone bay structure for them resulting in an undock / concordoken but I just couldn't work out what they did to get the criminal flag.
---
CCP was just neither fast nor really consistent with adding new ships. They announced already years ago that angel cartel and sisters of eve capitals will come soon™, but it never seemed to have moved beyond some concept art. Meanwhile the Triglavians experience quite a bit favoritism by CCP, presumably because they allow them to experiment with new mechanics.
---
Hey, at least the BRs are undocking to protect their sov, right? 
---
Memes aside, If you're blue to the BR rats, you can kill the bubbles, without harassment right? 
---
Inner Hell doesn't fight lol. There's a reason why them and every corp affiliated with them in wh space has a target on them. Holesale for instance got evicted last week for this exactly.
---
Orca + 3 Covetors, just like you said. They are dirt cheap, even if you lost all 3 at once, that's nothing. Keep your Orca aligned out at all times. I presume you know the MWD trick? (hit warp, run MWD twice, soon as the second cycle ends, you instawarp)
---
Thank you CCP, every time I get the urge to come back you all remind me why this game has no future. 
---
yes it's one thing to have them pay taxes directly to corp wallets. it's another thing to have them pay rent instead, very different. the second one gives you a juicy layer of plausible deniability
---
You really think we wanted to stay there more than a week? This isn't even our op you degenerate monkey 
---
I hate to say it (because I don't like TEST) but you guys don't really harbor bots - in your alliance. To say nothing of your renters or pets, esoteria seems to have mostly people in it. 
---
yea keeps it pretty quick. the orca will be tank fit for the most part so itll take a bit to burn it before concord shows up. 1 hour of mining alone would cover costs of the miners. Now my next thing to figure out is a decent place to mine at that isnt crawling with people.
---
Yeah I did actually look at this earlier, and with that you gain 4m EHP in the Aeon and have a tiny bit less fighter EHP than you'd have with the Hydras, its pretty ridiculous. Considering that your fighters are on par with Nyx fighters with just 1 drone durability rig the numbers will balloon higher.
---
Hydras will need to be balanced upwards a bit higher I think
---
Rage rolling for content from our home while we were locked out was pretty rude. You could have sent an invite.
---
🤜👌
---
Id look for a system with an ice belt, good isk if that's your priority. Need to be quick because they generally disappear fast but if you setup in a system with one &amp; track the times, you can be first to it
---
ma de fuck
---
or when having mids you can actually use matters
---
like wormholes 
---
Sorry, I can do stats and I feel I must reply with a concrete example.
---
If 5 players have 60 caps and 25 players have 0 caps, both of these statements can be correct:
---
- Most of the players have no cap alts.
---
- Players on average have 2 caps.
---
Spodbrain does things to cognitive function.  Like not being able to change flair...

yea i actually get off work like 2 hours after downtime so i usually see belts on when i get on. just need to find something kind of backwaterish where i can get lower tax and decent returns on refining.
---
👀
---
It made me want to SD &amp; walk away mid fight. I could hear my brain cells evaporating.  I feel sorry for people who fly this regularly.
---
&gt;Do you always have to be this retarded?
---
Look at this cyber bullying! 
---
&gt; Eyewitnesses across town reported seeing construction equipment being moved to the Kaalakiota campus only a few hours after Ishukone's opening ceremony.
---
See, being a suspicious sort, I have to wonder: is it the *same construction company* doing work at Ish and Kaa? 
---
I think low-power structures should have a timer, as you mentioned, of say 30 days like the mobile depot, then after the time is up, it begins to un-anchor letting anyone scoop it up when complete (still applies suspect to non-original owner.)  It will just make the "Clean New Eden Project" easier to manage for WDS.
---
Wasn't that the joke? The guy above was definitely sarcastic
---
i never blame people for not scanning stuff, i get 200% triggered though when i see some a random "Unstable Wormhole" as a bookmark. 
---
If someone says they are nice, assume they are lying
---
Imagine being this mad lmao. Please respond with a paragraph about how not mad you are.
---
Im not sure if your serious or joking? First, I think it is relavent to mention that the Chinese were not batphoned. They started independently hitting the Russians because of constant russian shit talking. Turns out they dont like being called 'dirty chinks'. In any case SF has won a bunch of fights without them.  - https://zkillboard.com/related/30005239/201903222000/
---
 https://zkillboard.com/related/30005084/201903131700/
---
But what do I know. SF is an 'already failed alliance'. Must suck to be the Russians getting beat by them. 
---
TLDR: only differences is it takes almost no actual player effort and leads to a highly self replicating uncounterable bug of rats getting stuck yet still interacting with players.
---
It's not less, it's more drone EHP - 1.25x1.25 = +56.25% (they are not stacking penalized). Hydra is 53.63%.
---
woosh
---
That would kill of small scale pvp and make the n+1 game-play even more problematic.
---
Apart from the bot assumption, that random name is not actually "Random". That is pinyin which is using for pronouncing Chinese. hahaha,  this post is so hilarious.
---
Excellent photoshop on the document! I mean, I have been around on the internet for a couple of years now, and I can say I have seen my fair share of pixels. But this one had me almost fooled!
---
Yep, it’s a good step (though myself and others would argue no where near enough). Did the math recently and I think the rorq is down to about 2-2.5 boosted hulks worth of raw yield. Which miles better than it was on release.
---
You can counter it. Grind standings with the faction. Also, I did say that the ship being stuck in the model was an issue. I didn't deny that part. 
---
Ah there it is, I was simply adding their bonuses instead of applying one after another
---
Soon (TM)

\- CCP
---
&gt; made them OP in the sense that everyone have one.
---
Honestly everything should be balanced with that consideration. Rorqs may be an obvious symptom now, but we were always headed toward a future with way more things like caps and supers than before. 
---
If players using a feature as much as they possibly can becomes game breaking, you either have to control how many can do it (not an optimal dev strategy), tone down the feature, or introduce some kind of opposite and opposed strategy to keep it in check.

I'm actually glad you guys stood up to my CEO. For months in a row he forced me to clean his hangers and rub his pod until the moment that a lot of nanite paste was required to heal it up a bit. I objected many times, but as a slave in Stranger Danger I have to follow his instructions.
---
GF to Inner Hell, you guys played it well. Like some others said, too bad we had too many peeps outside of our hole to bring it to a good fight. 
---
Can't wait to rebuild my shit and bring you a good fight on a future attempt. Also many thanks to the people that rage rolled for us, we love you forever for it!
---
I've always been a snuggly carebear. Jokes on you. 
---
&gt; I would hope CCP would adjust that so it is more competitive.
---
Exactly. That’s my issue with the Savior’s as well. The alternate options really squeeze Saviors and Hydras into tight niches. They’re going to lack utility, price-point, and strength if they release like this.
---
Just buy a miner permit from goons and you will be fiiiine. 
---
As a newbro, before you begin to adventure in the avenues of more expensive ships, max your core skills (engineering, electronics, navigation) or at least the x1 and x2 skills then stick with cruisers and below.  The faction you become fond of the most, max those out to lvl 5 i.e. Amarr Frig / Destr / Cruiser / Battlecruiser - then get all the subsequent gunnery skills or missile skills to match.  As you progress through your skill tree in these regards, you can fly your frigates while training up destroyers, and so on so forth, all while learning the intricasies of the game mechanics as you do.  Also, you won't be losing tons of isk each time you welp yourself.  This does not answer your pirate faction ship questions, but i figured i'd give you some unsolicited feedback :)
---
Removing asset safety on a low power structure runs counter to the base idea of preventing people who leave for a very long time from losing all their shit when they return. As such, CCP will never do it.
---
Buy plex. Honestly if you want the best advice I can possible give you it's to spend $20 and sell it for the 2 billion they're worth right now. The way I look at it is depending on how much you make that 2 billion could take you 10-20 hours as a new player. Hell it might take you a month! Use only a few hours of work time and trade it for many many hours of fun in game. The game is way more fun when you're not trying to grid for everything just to watch it blow up. 
---
TLDR; Buy plex for $20 sell it 2 bil and go have fun/reinvest that. 
---
my understanding pretty close to a rorqual. cant pilot those yet but soon.
---
pretty sure you mean code?
---
That’s not how it works. It spawns at a random location in system.

I'd have more respect for the people shitting on the US military if they bothered to learn the reason why my country's military is constantly rampaging around the middle east for zero benefit to us at all. I guess it's easier to just spout "dum murikkkcans" over and over. By the way, most Americans don't support this either. Hint: it's not the American citizens lobbying for these endless wars. 
---
This didn't just start recently, by the way. Look at WW2, where the allies firebombed a "safe" civilian city into ash, incinerating tens of thousands of innocents and not one military target. What monster would have authorized such an atrocity? Well, Churchill wasn't thrilled with the idea, but it was pushed hard by, coincidentally, the same sort of lobbying group that's now pushing for more wars in the middle east. Weird. It's okay though, because the Germans were all 100% evil monsters, even the women and children who had no part in the war or politics at all. And so it goes.
---
RIP Sean Smith. Dude didn't deserve what he got, and he certainly doesn't deserve getting shit on for a war he had no part in.
---
A SoE destroyer doesn't make much sense, both from the lore perspective and in therms of game-design. All SoE ships are designed towards defense, meanwhile destroyers in eve are mostly purely offensive ships.
---
Tfw when your alliance's reddit brigade works
---
I would recommend the test server. At the moment there are a lot of caps BUT every once in a while you get people running subcaps that you can fight. It's the best way I know how to practice with ships for free. 
---
But like they have said solo is tough.
---
I like to think its 3 cross-dressing chinese fellas in a basement over a cup of noodles that decided "you know what we should do, we should all make alts and mine" ?

The question is why? You fucking degenerate brain dead low IQ poor gene slav cossack pigs.
---

I fucking hate Russians. Literally the trailer trash of the planet. Criminally insane scum.
---
Depends... if you define 20~30+ as blob, even then, you won't get those numbers unless you're doing evictions/in one of the larger corps (HK [idk what they up to these days], Lazerhawks, WHBOO, NOVAC, etc).
---
Even then, you'll probably get 30~50 on the biggest of the days, both sides combined.
---
Normally, you'll have 10~30 people max in an engagement.
---
Is that a blob for you, compared to nullsec?
---
I don't see why ships should ever be balanced based on skill. They should be balanced based on what they actually do and how hard the ship itself is to acquire. Rorqs have too many gimicks and strengths and are cheap as all balls to build.
---
What's something fun and different to break the monotony of exploring? Exploration is rather solo so I have a hard time connecting with other players.
---
It's not even close and its even less considering you will be mining in highsec
---
Them too. 
---
Sounds like communist propaganda to me, but ok

We are currently planning to release these implants alongside a rebalance of the shield regen modules and rigs that would buff the individual modules but add a stacking penalty. This plan does not currently involve across the board changes to shield regen rates. We may add a shield regen penalty to the implants themselves if needed for balance but we are interested in exploring whether we can avoid that added complexity.
---
We are not currently planning any changes to shield supercapital hitpoints to go with these changes, although the upcoming remote rep diminishing returns are expected to somewhat reduce the relative strength of shield supers a little bit (removed a sentence that might have given the incorrect impression that we are mandating how people fit their ships). We’ll be keeping a close eye on things and making changes if needed.
---
FW was even better when It was alive.
---
You could get fights all day without any time to breath if you wanted, also there was lots of solo bc/bs which was fun to fight against.
---
Of course, FW zone is fun to roam in frigs nowadays, but I still miss lowsec on pre 2015.
---
Yeah, very little has changed in that doc in the way of normal mission blitzing.  Of the regular missions in that list, I think the only two that I've noticed changes in were:
---
- **The Assault**: you have to kill both rat spawns in the final room now, not just the left-most one
---
- **Stop The Thief**: you no longer need to buy reports for this mission; a Reports item gets automatically added to your cargo after destroying the specified rats
---
The Machariel fit changes slightly too with the slot layout changes, but I kept it simple and just dropped a Gyrostabilizer and added a Tracking Computer with a Tracking Speed script.
---
The Garmur fit still works for Team Burners, and the Daredevil fits for the Worm and Succubus Burners.
---
It sure is a convenient scapegoat.
---
&gt;the biggest offenders also in legacy space. So yes it is the pot calling the kettle black here. 
---
Okay, but I don't think you can legit say "the majority of the pest control super kills have been \*proven\* to be bots." I was around when a lot of them were killed screaming for help... AANNNND  at least one of those hyperspacial Hel kills was streamed by the victim.   
---
In other words, you don't have to be a bot to get the extremely stupid idea you ought to fit your ratting super with hyperspacials. 
---

He was the best Diplo Goons ever had that cared about building a community and reached out to help people without personal reward.  I miss him.

3 Covetors + Orca with max skills and fit and only using orca boosts (also max) will probably get you close to 1.5 rorquals after the April patch by volume. If you are mining in high sec - half the value of 1 rorqual mining in null, by value.

Everyone is also at 100% snuggly

We have been over this, there are *multiple* mechanics you could use to overcome this. Including improving your Blood Raider standings. Also, you have no problem using rats to your advantage to 'elite pvp,' but as soon as they are used against you, it's grr goons cheating.

Hunt other explorers. If they kill you, start a convo, ask them what you did wrong and give a gf.

Buy an astrahus together, find an empty wormhole system, anchor the astra, form a corp together. Start hunting ad a group, recruit fellow hunters. Grow to be the best exploration hunters in New eden.

CODE is only a issue if you are utterly lazy or suffering from spoodbrain (my dad is dirty carebear mining in higsec for over 10 years and was not once ganked). When it comes to the setup it was as far as I remember: 1x Orca &lt; 2x Orca &lt; 2x Hulk+ 1x Orca &lt; 3x Covetor + 1x Orca &lt; etc

What’s it for?

This is just like the real eve! Grind billions of isks then quit the game because the pvp is boring and painful.

TDF in my experience is EUTZ mainly. I'm USTZ and I only get into TDF fleets on the weekends. TDF isnt as large as as WTM but armor is fun and you can use Leshaks and Nestors.

How do I change the color of the overview? I have tried the overview settings however I still must be missing something.

I'm fairly new myself but I imagine fleet exploration could be pretty cool. You could have probers for scanning down sites and hacking the data caches and relics. Then you could also have combat ships with you to run the combat sites you scan down and salvagers to loot/salvage the wrecks. Also,  miners for the mining sites and haulers to bring loot/ore etc. back to a base so that nobody needs to waste time going back to unload. Finally, a pvp division that could be in charge of protecting the fleet from gankers as well as enforcing a claim over the areas you explore, driving off/ killing anyone who invades your wh space.  I imagine something like that could end up being pretty fun. 
---
That would work too. No matter which direction they take, gotta do something, not nothing.
---
I've wondered about the sisters probes myself. Are they really worth the price difference on an alpha ship?
---
Why the nanobot accel rig? 
---
How do you get involved? Start by getting involved! Talk to corporations who are doing stuff you want to do. Join one. Be happy.

Don't orbit the roids man, align align align. You orbit mine out in nullsec and your going to lose a ship or 12.

---
Legit not trying to be a wormholer btw, but my personal experience with null groups is that they take things waaaay too seriously even when it's entirely misplaced. I don't really fault them, because groups as large as them tend to get like that in any game. Try joining up with some NPSI groups or wormhole groups, or smaller null groups if you can find them. Getting to know the people you're playing with means less people who feel they can push you around.
---
If you're just looking for some quick fights, NPSI groups like Spectre Fleet are perfect. Fights with no obligation on planned schedules, very cool community.

Holesale neither fights nor brings any content to wormhole space. They're a hisec wardec Corp that exists in wormholes only to claim they're wormholers. No wormholer has ever gotten a fight out of them. They're nicknamed rollsale for a reason.
---
Additionally, the eviction of Holesale, at least from the outsider perspective seems like revenge for the fact that Holesale attacked them during the rage eviction. They had good reasons to go over them.
---
INHE evicting stranger danger on the other hand, especially if this aar is to be believed and they intended to hit them for months, is a massive corporation attacking a corporation full of Newbros a faction of their size for no discernable reason. Stranger Danger fights, are nice dudes, and basically are liked by everyone. INHEs eviction of them has no clear motivation other than to kill off English speaking wormhole pvp corps.

Can't really argue with this. Rorquals are tuned similarly to ratting is. The issue at the end of the day is that when you are making the kind of money you can make in nullsec/wormholes via ratting/mining you can simply multiply your skills and characters quickly. The money increases exponentially. I went from 1 rorq to 7 in a year. Skill injectors and extractors need something, but the thing is we're at a point where the damage is already done. The rich will continue to get mega rich from here on out.

I hear so much about the current inflation problem in EVE. Why is it not as simple as just forcing high end players to spend more money? Get rid of asset safety, make abandoned POS's more vulnerable. Ihear people complaining about how the major player groups have mostly stopped engaging in large scale wars, instead opting to be satisfied with mostly smaller skirmishes over contested territories. Encourage the mega factions/corporations to be more aggressive towards each other so more ships get blown up. Perhaps by making newly acquired territories give a short term boost in resources. Like, for the first week, valuable ores, sites etc. will occur at a higher frequency or something to that effect. Also make it so that the longer another faction/corporation(I'm really not 100% on the appropriate terminology) has held a territory, the greater the new acquisition boost is. That could encourage groups to push deeper into enemy territory instead of only engaging in fringe warfare. Apparently there is a big problem with afk rorquals fleets? Nerf the rorquals. Of course, I've only been playing for a month or two, so it's entirely possible that there is something I'm missing, so please feel free to correct me on anything I'm getting wrong here.

I always recommend that new players go join the **EVE University** corporation. They will teach you all about the game.

I feel like I can give a decent perspective here. I've been a CEO since I was 15 (am 28 now) and spent 95% of that time in null. We moved to wormholes in January and it's been a bit of a transition. My major things to ask people that are moving from null is:
---
Are you able to be self-sufficient? Not just ISK, but if it's a night where there is nothing planned, do you have issues going out and doing solo stuff?  
---
Do you have an issue scanning/using mapping tools (Pathfinder/Tripwire/Else)? They are necessary for working together in a group.  
---
Are you cool with not being a shithead? Wormhole "bushido" is actually a thing, and when you decide to consistently drop capitals on roaming gangs through your hole, or talk shit in local, or whatever, it manages to piss people off and give your alliance a bad rep.  
---
Do you have a lot of alts? It's not necessary to have a lot of them, but I've found it's far more beneficial in a wormhole. You don't have local so a lot of the time if you're out doing something, someone will want to have an alt placed on each hole with World Level volume up so you can hear when people jump through the hole.  
---
Are you fine with the fact that if you get invaded by an overwhelming force that your group can't fight, the reality is that you're either gonna repackage ships and log them off in a hauler/freighter/orca, or self destruct to deny them loot and get at least some money back out of it? This means that asset safety will never save your stuff ever. So pack light.
---
If you don't have issues with any of that, then I think wormhole space is at least worth trying out for a bit. New experiences in a game are not typically a bad thing, especially once you learn the in's and out's of wormhole mechanics, how to roll statics, wandering holes, constantly using Dscan, working in smaller gangs.
---
I can say that my desire to play Eve has gone up significantly since we left a null bloc to do this. Not at first, and not all at once. It took a little time to adjust, but over the last couple weeks I've been more active, more willing to do stuff, and becoming a better PvP'r than at any time in the last 10 years. It's one of the first times in a very long time that I think about what to do in Eve when I'm off doing other stuff.
---
My advice if you wanna give wormholes a shot is to find an experienced group that isn't huge with a null static so the transition is a bit easier for yourself. PvP out of the null static, maybe explore or make money if you need to until you learn how to farm their other static.
---
damn that looks cool, (i want one) 
---
U rite
---
Well...multiboxing hulks is hardly akin to running a single account in incursions and I’d assert that it is not remotely “passive”. (Insert botting complaint here).  The assumption seems to be that a Rorqual is inherently “safe” to afk mine with but Rorqual pilots that survive a gank attempt are going to be those that are alert and at the keyboard, otherwise you’re dead.  Incursions are mind numbing and a very repetitive grind that also come with gank risks.  I was just making a comparison of the before/after of Rorqual changes that resulted in a migration of players to certain areas of the game that will potentially see inverse migrations with the upcoming nerf.
---
Same number supers and machariels :d.

Let me tell you a little story.

In March 29, a FRT logistic manager with almost 0 PVP experience, pinged everyone in alliance chat that someone is using this "exploit".

And I told them just using carrier or some high speed ship to force the enemy leave and put your own. This is the easiest solution for this. I was told that ESS is forbidden in in Winter Coalition, lol who cares. But I think this could develop some tactics and force someone to put ESS to have more contents.
---
After discussing with my friends, of course we just targeted the busiest systems in New Eden.

We managed to shut down several systems with some interceptors and got tons of salt.

I sent that to my corp. Pretty good. If you weenies did more than just dock up every time I enter local and only ever fight 3 or 4 of our guys with cruisers crew ready to roll or third party on shit and then dock up immediately for the rest of the day, then I probably wouldn't be as annoyed. But if that's your goal then you certainly are doing it well

This is something completely else and jsut a usual battle in SP/WC and has really nothing to do with the FI.RE/Winter invasion as one side wasn't even present at all.
---
Yeah...considering all those ‘russians’ live in scalding pass and have for awhile, don’t think they made a wrong turn
---
Hey fix my printer thx
---
This is actually a decent idea
---
Once again syndicate is left out to dry 🙄
---
Agreed, was more of a joke then a serious statement about a wrong turn.
---
You are not being fair at all, period.    To define all hisec players as being the same as a few miscreants shows a lack of maturity and intelligence on your part.     The only person I see frothing in a psychotic way is you.  Let me remind you, they are Eve players, you should remember that.
---
Let's take their ramping up mechanic and apply it to their cap reduction use bonus on neuting. Problem is it takes away from the role of Amarr/Blood Raiders
---
Warp To Me is still active
---
If you have 0 m/s velocity, it takes the same amount of time to warp in any direction.
---
Simple experiment:  Jump through a gate, and you will be at 0 m/s.  Warp to anything.  Time how long it takes to reach 75% max velocity required to enter warp.  Repeat and warp to different things.  Compare the times.
---
I mean I don't even care if you do phone or not but this sly bs of "we don't *try* to phone them they just happen to show up to all major timers."  Just say what really happens, you give them the timers and they show up.
---
Still kind of looks like a wrong turn though.
---
* Go to the overview settings (burger menu on the overview)
---
* go to the "appearance" tab
---
* and there to "background"
---
wow whats your deal?
---
It's a secret 
---
It doesn’t help that they use to spam + undock from those stations resulting in peak accumulation of the diamond rats at the stations. 
---
Cheers my dude 👊
---
Most entities rebuild if they have a decent Corp culture that the line agrees with. 
---
My laundry basket is really similar to that.
---
It is also nearly impossible to remember how to collapse it :(
---
Hey bring it over lazy
---
Our great logistic manager would like to believe it since she got GM response in Sunday while we were happy playing in Delve. Whatever CCP happened is just like the ancient rules, at leaset I do not care...
---
They are actually working on nerfing rorqs, among other things. The issue is there's a fine balance to be struck between neutralising the 'infinite isk' faucets, and making individual players feel that the time and money they invested into a high SP character are now worthless (causing ill feeling, and potentially large-scale player loss/unsubscribes). So instead of just knee-jerk massive nerfs, they go for small tweaky balance passes, then review how the economy and player activity shifts, then another pass, view and review, repeat ad infinitum. This means the player base might grump a bit, but then they adapt, adjust, and accept rather than flouncing altogether. However, it also means that as one easy revenue stream dries up, smart players find a new one, so as soon as they perfect the solution to one issue, a new one has popped up, so it's a Sisyphean task.
---
The idea of 'newly conquered land' being more profitable is nice in theory, but the problem is that the people who can easily take this are also the people who already have too much isk, so all that will happen is that the rich get richer by booting out everyone smaller, making it even harder for those intermediate groups to catch up or compete. And it's more likely to result in 'surrender terms' that involve trading dried up zones on each side to the other (benefiting both) than outright battles when the big boys go head to head. Currently, the logic is that over-use of anomolies in a given system will reduce the spawn rate, meaning instead of farming one system to death, groups have to spread out to let systems 'fallow' without stopping their members from farming. This should result in more boundary fights, as well as alliances winding up with more territory than they can reasonably defend thus allowing for lower-scale hostiles to sneak in more easily. It hasn't played out quite like that so far, but as said that's because the adjustments thus far have been minor each time, so probably we'll see further passes that push it over that edge, but it's a slow and careful process.
---
AND HERE IT IS BOYS AND GIRLS - all those months of “*You are irrelevant! You don’t stop us at all BBTB! Your bubbling does nothing!*” posting dismantled and thrown to the side by Olmeca’s ending argument of “*...players shut down a station by bubbling it*”

There goes that narrative.
---
The pros are... too long to list lol. Wormholes are awesome.
---
The cons? Nullbears literally so bored with null they drop 1400 dudes on your citadels.
---
It is a shame that you, a person who self identifies as having multiple degrees and is against isms of all kinds, would engage in this ableism against a fellow person.  
---
Thing is we need to phone them for most major timers because other groups are either to big or phone themselves. It's really a chicken eggs problem. 
---
Amen
---
So the piece of the puzzle I was missing is that aggressing a pod in LS (even if you don't kill it) gives you a criminal timer. You were close enough so PM me the pilot name you want the ISK sent to.
---
Pretty much spot on. I'll do the donation tomorrow as requested.
---
We've got really good scanners, for us the struggle sometimes is just getting people out in the chain looking for a fight. It's insane the amount of kills/fights you get just checking every hole, checking if citadels are low power,  camping a hole for a bit...
---
Content is actually super easy in wormholes, as long as people just undock and actually play, instead of just ship spinning
---
Currently, yes. The others are linked to events and time-limited (expire a certain date after the event ends) and the last 'batch' have already expired. There will most likely be more when the next big event rolls around, although whether they're beneficial compared to skill injectors will remain to be seen (last event the crafting cost alone meant they cost almost double what a skill injector would to get the same SP!).
---
corporation full of newbros?
---
you were supposed to combat the spin, not join it 
---
Thank you. I seem to have completely overlooked that.
---
Have you interacted with the average SD member? Sure they've got a core of experienced member, and they've got some vets, but their average member is new to eve. They're very open about taking anyone. 
---
There are other people that get as hyped you as you do for Eve. Connect with them. There are literally *dozens* of us.
---
Step 1 - join a newbro corp. Any one - Horde, Test, Brave, Karma. Even though you aren't a "newbro".  
---
Step 2 - be on comms and participate in ops.  
---
Step 3 - identify individuals that share similar interests and that you enjoy flying with.  
---
Step 4 - mentor real new players and see if you enjoy that  
---
Step 5 - after a few months you will have a whole network of individuals in whichever alliance you choose, as well as continuing to build your resume and Zkill and experience. You will also have a much clearer sense of direction of what you ENJOY in Eve, and start to identify people that share that.  
---
There are very few things that beat the yelps of excitement of an operation planned for weeks results in a win or a shiny titan frag.   
---
single and incel is redundant
---
please revise your post thanks :-)
---
I was actually asked to stop posting. The anti bot campaign is going good though. Watch for the next team security update!
---
... Leviathans are going to be awful to kill. Let alone Komodos. Dear god /u/CCP_Fozzie does no one have Pyfa installed over there.
---
That's fine just don't act surprised when people expect snuff to be right behind a cyno because it happens often enough.
---
Yes it was ordered today we self destructed 500 titans on the 1dq1 undock
---
Skill Injectors (Easy bot accounts) killed (killing) EVE.. Change my mind
---
where in the op does it say anything about anything you said
---
it literally says they wanted to kill faction forts because they're shiny. isn't that the "fuck the spin go shoot things create content" mentality that's supposed to be virtuous? 
---
To add to the other guys, iirc Hard Knocks eviction was a personal grudge as Holesale tried to fuck over Hard Knocks when Hard Knocks were getting evicted. 
---
I refuse to come back until they nuke asset safety for everything out of high sec
---
Have you tried to talk to Eve? Ask her out? 
---
Try EVE University for start and see how it goes from there
---
bruh XD
---
this "joke" was not even remotely funny so i bet you try to mask it as a joke now that you've been called out.
---
Ok will do thanks
---
&gt; CCP didn't intend
---
says who?
---
I hack from 2100 m away... that way you can still cloak.
---
And a Heron is not "harmless" it steals relic sites ;)
---
Can comfirm the shit talking part. It's about time LSH and pets get dunked.
---
if this is real then it's funny af
---
when u loose ur pod you get this for Aprils fools :P
---
Well you're in TAPI. Of course you aren't going to make that kind of cheddar holed up those keepstars all day fending off baddies soaking your isk up. :D
---
:sigh:
---
The one day of the year when every news site becomes completely useless.
---
Seriously stupid.
---
no
---
Tbh i play on geforce now so idk how it works
---
What do you want to use your stabber for, friend, and where
---
SoE fax? 
---
200/160 = 2:1 yes okay?
---
I think that's more like 5:4? 
---
I highly recommend Eve-U. You don't get the political bias drilled into you from the get-go as you do with every single newbro "take everyone that breathes" alliances that people will advertise in here. They teach you the mechanics and let you figure out what to do with it.
---
X-up is recruiting new an old player we are vet players that plan to run public fleet with free t1 ships. Will learn to have fun smalk talk a lil and pvp both brawly snd kity
---
That's amazing
---
&gt;taking intel from zkill is easiest
---
Actually being there is easier
---
&gt;but a killmail doesnt really tell the story does it?
---
nah but what if you're there? 
---
&gt;most of the shit on that br are probably ships that dropped after the thing died (go ahead and check the timestamps) [incorrect bullshit .......]
---
Yeah nah, look at the armour timer. Nothing dropped for armour, that's where you get the holesale fleet size from! Wow how amazing HOW DO I DO IT?
---
&gt;They had a muninn fleet do hole control and a raven fleet on the fort
---
????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
---
WHERE IS THE MAGIC MUNINN FLEET
---
You colossal mongoloid, the hole control was a doorstopped mega. On a ultra-low sp alt, that couldn't cloak. 
---
blue donut? high sec?
---
hold onto them you'll get spooky emails 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BE1HriDzlJs
---
Well, we don't know yet. All we do know is that having them will cause you to get an EVE-mail with a vid linked that has a cryptic rotating image.
---
They are sold on in the system named Rancer
---
I always miss all the fun ops...
---
why?
---
Wait we were wearing shirts to begin with?
---
Out with little cell phone reception. Playing with stabber fits and bit of googling I can. Tryna gank/ pve a bit in group.
---
Idgi PK. 
---
If you are refuting my claim. Please bring some evidence for the court, or stfu forever. 
---
Tia,
---
All of Eve.
---
Alright I'll talk a look
---
Ok cool thanks that really helps
---
ok so hi sec was way lower than i expected. came out to like 40m/hr with all the accounts. i think ill have to figure out a different place to mine or run it into my wh and hope for the best.
---
Can Ansiblex jump gates be made in high sec?
---
Here's why this is useless: let's say your ship has a 75% warp speed of 100m/s. If you are "passive aligned" at 1 m/s, you still require 99% of your align time to get into warp.
---
Now it's *possible* that did some good: if your ship's normal align time would have been just over a tick boundary, maybe getting into warp 1% faster could actually save you. But it's unlikely. If you feel like this gets you to warp faster, it's probably just psychological because you're not watching your ship "turn around" and thinking **hurry up!**
---
My stabber was fit with the following
---
T3Cs are in my opinion the best bang for your buck in the game....you can make all of them a perfect ship for most things. Theyre also a very quick train to get maxed skilled
---
It's a neat trick, but IMO it's just too powerful.
---
EWAR has fairly soft effects: messing with logi, improving application, nerfing incoming damage, immobilizing your prey, playing cap games.  This has a direct, hard effect of increasing the effective DPS of every ship in your fleet.  There's no reason not to fly as many of these as you can.
---
Which, to me, means it's interesting, but broken (and if not broken, useless - non-Caldari EWAR drones anyone?)
---
I didnt say nerd i said remove rorqs ability to mine.
---
Blood God's prophet 
---
Amarr already have neuting as T2 EWAR, inb4 patent infringement lawsuit.
---
Tbh I'd be glad to see a new EWAR mechanic, although I don't know what it would or should be.
---
&gt; I hate to say it  
---
So, you would rather have it that TEST has bots. Just.....wow.
---
Asked to stop posting? Why... Too much light shed on a real problem for players that lines CCP pockets?
---
I hate to say it because I hate to give TEST a compliment; unfortunately for my ego, in this case it's deserved. 
---
You on the other hand deserve ridicule for being a fucking moron.
---
How is dropping it in a deadspace pocket any different to dropping it next to a dread spawn?
---
&gt; The exploit was that people were anchoring them in places that made them nearly impossible to steal from.
---
Why didn't they just state that!  Geez!
---
I think a SoE cov ops logi cruiser would be sweet.
---
Ready for the Ragnaroks and Leviathans ranking entire fleets with passive shield regen?
---
ADAPT AND GET 1000 VIRGINS TO RAGE POST ON REDDIT
---
Ah yes. Personal attacks and name calling. Excellent argument as always.
---
Anyway, the ridicule is deserved by you and origin for joining FRT after complaining about bots. Look at your own alliance.
---
It really depends on what you’re wanting to get involved in and what you feel like you’re missing out on. There’s a ton of group aspects that you’re missing out on and each appeals/doesn’t to different people. Do you want to help build a Corp up from the ground? Then go small. Do you want to be part of the big battles you’ve always heard about? Join one of the sides/big corps currently dunking it out (or soon to be). Not to mention WH life which is a whole different type of eve for those interested. It really depends on what you feel like you’re  missing and where you’re at now
---
Yeah. CCP are always intentionally vague to limit the spread of the declared exploit.
---
You need to go spend some time outside in the sun buddy... 
---
Big ups to Odin's Call. Good Group of peeps.
---
pro: Literally all of wormholer space will jump to your defense to brigade and help you win reddit karma, even if you can't win a fight in EVE.  
---
con: You are required to shit talk anyone not a wormholer or you lose your membership card.
---
It’s deadspace. You can’t warp to them even if you probe them. You’ll just land on the warpin again
---
I know this. But once you force them out of one deadspace pocket they are also forced to start again at 0km. 
---
Its funny cause Blood is actually Hitler irl
---
HWITE PAWR
---
Oh. Makes sense
---
  I am somewhat perplexed that in the span of several weeks, one of my corp mates purchsed a whiptail for 155 bil, ccp then told him weeks later the dude person who sold him the whiptail qas involved in rmt so they took the whiptail...leaving him with nothing. The dude tried to escalate with ccp but they said no tool bad so sad. No giving his money back. They just took it. They know he didnt rmt. They wont do anything to even try to make him whole.  Hes been playing almost a decade on several paid accounts.  Yet since he cannot trust ccp he quit. Hes gone. And he was a great friend
---
 
---
     Another corp mate bouggt a character on the bazaar and then all of a sudden all of his characters were banned ehile ccp investigated. They eventually relinquished control to all but 2 accounts while the pending investigation went through. He now had all his accounts but other people doing bad things caused him to be banned. Now he lossed weeks of training. Weeks of paid time. They did give him some free time or something but seriously. 
---
    ...Yet such blatent botting can go on. Its unreal. I understand investigations take time in rmt. But the whiptail story is just disturbing and i plan on making a post soon about it. The community needs to know.
---
    It seems ccp is going ham fisted on rmt investigations. Botting, however, is just run rampant.  All big alliances moat likely have botters since its easy for then to hide. As a director in a corp i try to keep my corp as honest as possible.  I want it to grow, for more people to be on comms, and for lots of paps.  I want people to have fun. But dont think that alliance leadership has any idea about bots in some renter corp or even member corp. Not unless it is actually brought to their attention. 
---
It must be April 1st, again :(
---
Seriously, just unplug and go outside for the day.
---
Is this the World Famous Angry McGee? How in gods green earth does Tiny still stand you in corp?
---
I never sold any Fortizar to anybody. But do you know what was more ‘treacherous’? Your leadership telling us that we were less important than CVA and were on our own in the last few weeks. There’s a reason why so few remain in Provibloc. It’s because CVA stabbed us in the back one too many times. I’m not surprised some in Yulai sold structures that weren’t going to get defended by the coalition we had spent years defending.
---
Dax made a huge show of trying to remain amicable and do a last battle with Provi before we left, but the way EQ and team treated him and us was despicable and far more treacherous.
---
We in the Endgame now
---
The only real argument I could see for it hurting small gang would be fucking heavily active tanked ships that would get a carrier dropped on them anyway. Nano is already trying to mitigate damage in ways that resists mean a lot less unless you're lussy
---
dambit, Brisc!
---
Hmm titans dont cost that much
---
Holesale shot HK bear holes during the eviction. Idk what they expected.
---
Wasn't even a hk op tho, fun fact.
---
Thats the blue donuthole.
---
Have you ever tried solo or small gang pvp? Most entities nowadays will not undock even if they outnumber your solo cruiser 8 to 1. Many defense fleets are so focused on getting enough alpha damage on the field that they aren't willing to to risk anything beyond T1 ships if they don't have a absolute numerical advantage. Superior damage resists are one of the few ways to deal with high alpha damage, which for example is why for example WH groups and other small scale groups love command ships so much. Adding a mechanism that would lower resistances would encourage players to wait until they have enough alpha to just delete attacking ships from the grid which overall leads to less content and less interesting fights.
---
Hey, if you are looking for some people to chat with and have some fun, let me know, Right Click Jump To would love to have you!
---
Let me know if you're interested!

You need to move your stuff.
---
"Blue donut" is a derogatory term used by smaller PvP groups to describe large nullsec blocs. I couldn't tell you where the *donut* part originates, but it describes the problem of being unable to find an enemy to fight due to having everybody within a radius of several regions set to blue standings. It's generally followed up by the witticism that nullsec is safer than highsec and a jab that it doesn't require any skill to be successful there.
---
He did that for rapid heavy nerf and entosis, iirc...we seriously thought it was a joke
---
I don't recall Fi.re coalition officcially launching an invasion either.
---
no u
---
Wormholes: every individual player matters a lot and can often single handedly make or break an op. You choose your fights, usually no mandatory ops, smaller group of closer friends and you get rich quicker. You actually learn to PvP.
---
Null: you're a faceless pawn in someone else's war, won't learn anything about pvp and will be easily replaced. Oh and you get told what to do, when to play and will be destroyed if you don't listen.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gDiSTtABuE
---
Uh... You mean the pre-planned, announced invasion that the "reformed" RMC was doing in conjunction with Siberian Squad, and former DRF alliances? Because if you missed that, I'm not really sure what to tell you.
---
wait NCdot members are allowed to do PI? isn't that dangerously unelite
---
Watch solo PvP hype videos on YouTube. Go try it yourself for hours and find nothing. Repeat. Cry. Try again. Get blobbed. Cry some more. Repeat. Well you get the idea... 
---
Perfection
---
&gt; Enjoy half a year of no Capital Ships in EVE!
---
sounded scary until this wew
---
Announced where? Care to share the details of when it was supposed to kick off, what were those preplanned plans etc? Are you sure you're not confusing internal propaganda with actual announcements?
---
Unlike your argument, which was more or less a willful misunderstanding of what I wrote in order to make a shitty quip, my argument is true. You're a fucking moron. I can point out hypocrisy in this community just fine from inside frat, and your ideological purity would be a lot more palatable if you had any clue what you were fucking talking about. 
---
I mean i just unsubbed but ill come back if we being invaded by triglavians 
---
Going off what everyone else is saying, join a corp and get out of highsec. EVE is usually much better with friends.
---
There's plenty of good newbro-oriented corps, but consider joining us at [Dreddit](https://dredditisrecruiting.com)!
---
I guess Original Sinners is making Eve Great Again.
---
because you can create the ded site and then burn 2000km from the entrance and drop the ESS. when people warp to it they are 2000km away from it and cannot warp to it (due to ded mechanics). dropping it in a spawned site is ok because you still warp directly to it 
---
Very nice dude! I especially like the Kestrel vs Breacher fight. I'm not sure what ammo they were using since it's not listed in your notification but you could probably mitigate even more with heated AB. Good stuff though, more please!
---
You cannot even point out your own hypocrisy, let alone that of the community.  
---
And the cursing and name calling is really pathetic and shows how frustrated and clueless you really are.  
---
Maybe take a break.
---
No, why would they, they don't play eve
---
why dont you just burn to it
---
Would you be willing to share the NC file?
---
I got some new 3/32" bits I need to test out on mdf on my CNC. I think this would be great. 
---
have considered deleting your reddit account?
---
yes, but only when i'm elected to csm
---
I liked the idea of a ramping resist debuffer I saw on here a while back.
---
wow it would nearly be worth it
---
How do you know what I am or am not doing in my own alliance? Not everyone runs to Reddit to make sure everyone sees how virtuous they are. 
---
I'm calling you names because you deserve it. I don't get frustrated when people intentionally misrepresent what I say in order to make a shockingly stupid point. How about you have a good faith discussion instead of trying to score meaningless points by fucking lying.
---
&gt;  There's no reason not to fly as many of these as you can.
---
Surely the direct counter would be standard ECM?
---
&gt;wow it would be nearly worth it
---
dw baby i don't even have a passport lol you're stuck with me
---
Cool!!!!
---
*gsm
---
Shame they didn't even try to stop the Raven fleet  
---
it ain't untrue
---
if i actually chose to run i could guarantee my election, no sweat
---
furry downvote
---
Nice April’s Fool joke
---
We were looking at the Komodo with the new stats and a decent fit. Like 403m ehp heated 200 plus cold
---
you would have my vote ngl
---
&gt;why someone with a massively equipped ship will just K.O.S a pilot in a lowly fitted Heron
---
Welcome to eve. If it's not blue to you, it's going to shoot you. Doesn't matter how much of not a threat you are.
---
Very good summary and completely agree. I think the key bit to highlight is the self sufficiency timewise not isk. I think that is the biggest challenge in making the transition from null to wh’er.
---
The default overview is...not good. As others suggested z-s overview is a good one. There are others as well. Google is your friend
---
So basically never
---
Can't believe I allowed myself to get talked into joining such a clusterfuck of an alliance. Don't get me wrong, plenty of the pilots are great guys, but Jesse is a shit leader. It would run vastly better if Jesse just kept his nose out of shit and let the FCs do what they do best.
---
He's such a fucking charity case the prostitutes he hires to touch his tiny cock likely qualify for 501(c)(3) tax exemption.
---
I for one welcome our triangle overlords
---
ECM works if it's centralized.  Which granted, it could be, either lock the module to one ship class or nerf it into the ground on all non-bonused hulls.  Most EWAR isn't hull-locked though, and if I were designing a doctrine I'd want to put it on all my mainline ships.  Sure you lose tank, application, cap, whatever, but it's a damage mod for your entire fleet.
---
Then again, I don't design doctrines so I have only Pyfa to guide me.
---
Please contact any TEST diplo with proof of alliance members botting.
---
well as long as i don't run, yeah
---
if i do though i'm on
---
Tormentor is great! I've seen ppl post kills of a dual web tormentor killing dramiels.

In the kill mail it says he was using faction rockets. Good suggestion, I do believe the only dmg I was taking was from his two drones but I could be wrong. Thanks!
---
No. Only sov null
---
I have a container with corpses in. When they're fresh, I contract them to their owner for a small fee.
---
They rarely accept :(
---
Oh pwease, it's just an aprils fools text replace :)
---
If you can afford it, yes. If you’re getting blown up every time you go out and have trouble affording a heron, figure out how to improve your survival and maybe join Signal Cartel, and then buy the sisters probes
---
No dude, it's purely a joke, closest thing is the corpse bay on bloodraider ships
---
I’m sure any changes to implants like slaves and crystals will be name only and they will keep their armour/shield bonus respectively 
---
There will be more. We'll try to turn PvP into something fun at least here!
---
Noone would notice tbh
---
My friend was thinking about giving me a free Gnosis, is the ship any good?
---
wow u replied b4 i edited my post
---
I used to use this trick with Bestowers, not sure it works anymore, but it's worth trying.
---
Align your ship to target.
---
Stop.
---
Power up a microwarp. Keep it hot.
---
When you see something on d-scan, immediately align, then kick the MW off. When it cycles off, your max velocity will drop, and you warp off instantly. There's a timing trick to this of course, so practice it.
---
So if we write in elect you all our problems are solved? you can't go be in the CSM but you still have to delete your account

Some questions about clones soldiers. 
---
Is it possible to hunt them in a T1 destroyer by closing in quickly, then sig tanking with a 500m orbit?
---
What DPS do you need to put out to kill each level of soldier?
---
Do the 0.1 clone soldiers use disruptors or scrams?
---
Never heard of that group.
---
you know youre sub is unbiased when the mods defend goon zings

What's a wormholer know about capital fits? Go back to your shell, hermit crab.

yes.

in the time it takes you to get to it they can cash it and steal it, its not like they make a ton of money but its annoying
---
Yes, you can only expect it to be this china alliance, the whole country should be removed
---
I have asked for this several times.
---
Today its not a joke today it is happening.
---
Yeah, new soe ships would look badass
---
Its because we were told by leadership not to post about blue bots
---
If the Triglavians are all about triangles, does that make them... Delta Force?
---
Will still die to 300+dreads with the fax changes. Armor caps can dual tank and can effectively get double rep power.

I don't see any problem with this.  Armor supers get the dual tank, shield supers needed something

Well, you're already playing Eve, so the issue of having any self-respect doesn't exist anyway. Go for it!

Few months back someone suggested something to add heat damage to modules. Kinda goes with the ramp up of Triglavian ships

You can only store assembled ships in an SMA, so you can simply launch the ship, get in and leave.

Na'av 😂 funny you show up when mention the crew

Why you hatin'?

Yes and no. If it's free you should definitely take it. It's a good ship to experiment with.

OK, I'll try and take a look at it!

What kind of scratch would you guess is needed to get setup in j-space? I'm in a small (&lt;10 man) corp and would love to do this, but the money man isn't completely sold on it without a solid plan.

That "race" of ships is nice because they require starter skills to pilot even the battleship, so you can focus on core fitting and weapons skills and not worry about spaceship command skills. That being said a jack of all trades is a master of none and once you figure out what you like and dont like about that ship you will know what spaceship command skills to focus in on and get something that works better for your uses. So get out there and lose that ship!
