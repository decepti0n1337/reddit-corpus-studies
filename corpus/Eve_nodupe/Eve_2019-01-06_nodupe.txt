Which amazes me because its very few actions and is very simple. Compare it to any other game and its amazing how little some players can understand or do in eve.

What the hek is this shit ????

Isn’t hek still top 5 systems?
---
That's allot of drugs in cargo, you should go see some one about that
---
Serpentis is also very good. Only Angels and Blood Raiders are much worse.
---
If a region is well farmed (like Catch for instance), Serinus' method is great. Run around through the same systems repeatedly, and most new sigs will be good sites to run.
---
If there are not many explorers in a region, this often doesn't work well. There are often "highways", which are cleared by neutral explorers passing through, and some side areas, which are rarely visited. Respawning sites tend to pile up there. In these regions it's better to scan a large number of systems - preferentially those which are off the highway, of course. Once you know them well, such regions can be very profitable. But it takes some time first to learn which systems are good and which are not.

The idea behind T2 is specialisation and T3 is flexibility, T3 is not actually meant to necessarily be objectively better than T2, which is why they were nerfed ages ago and given the ability to refit rigs given they're supposed to be able to fill many roles

As an scifi artist myseft I tend to picture amazing Eve ideas with the right music. When ever I hear certain music (mostly Dark Synth) I just go wild on ideas in the EVE Universe. Fast ceptor fights, fleet battles or the end of New Eden. I always come up with something. So yeah, I have something for ya.

that fit shooting void and having ogres out is 704 DPS. changing damage sub to hybrid sub and blasters to neutron blasters. you will have 716 dps with void loaded and hobgoblins out. with neutron blasters that fit is 15% over from PG, so you have to drop a little bit of tank.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The dps difference isnt massive in the end, drone fit does tiny bit less dps, but can reach further and can fit bit more tank.

Going to their public channel and following the MOTD instructions or pinging one of the listed HR guys I expect. ESI has been a mess AFAIK so assume they are having to do some manual Auth workaround.
---
The best hauler is someone else's. 
---
Pretty much sums it up. I have a trading character there just for the fun of it, that only sells skill books no one else is selling and it can literally take a year to get rid of it.
---
t3 is supposed to be
---
a) more flexible
---
b) well suited for WH space and exploration
---
c) not automatically more powerful that t2 cruisers, which are inherently focused on combat, ewar, or exploration, but never all 3 at once.
---
1)T3s are meant to be flexible, not better. That's why you can swap sub's and rigs even with a mobile depot.
---
2)Not sure if you ever noticed, but T3s lean much more heavily on survivability and/or utility than dps. A Proteus tanks way more than an Ishtar in a regular/blinged PvP fit. Source: me facetanking a vni and a myrm(whom I killed and made reship into a domi) plus the site for about 20 minutes or so before eventually getting neuted out.
---
First of all this meltdown is a meme. How you idiots haven't figured that out is beyond me. I thought hanzs post would have put it over the top but you drooling morons are so eager for drama that you keep doubling down. Second of app go back to where I blamed CCP for anything, I'll wait. 
---
I lived in Hek for the first few months of playing EVE as an alpha, and I gotta say, it is a solid place for new players: tons of missions (of all levels and types) within just a few jumps, a decent market, and just a few jumps from ganking lowsec (Rancer) and content lowsec (Min/Amarr WZ).
---
Frankly, I view the "under-seeded" market as a massive boon for prospective Hekians (Hekites? Heklers?). If you're looking to dip your toes into industry/trade, you don't need to spend your entire life waiting 5 minutes to .01 ISK someone, chat has 99% less sperg in local than Jita (when chat actually works). Yeah, you won't be able to sell a huge volume of goods, but you'll often have really good margins on a wide variety of goods, whether mining goods, mission hulls and modules, or PVP ships and rigs. Plus, prices on Matari and Angel goods (like meta projectile turrets) are often much more reliable than those in Jita.
---
Hek: Give it a try. Why the Hek not?
---
The issue that I have with his fit is that it looks as though it can't decide weather he wants to brawl to kite, and so he ends up being bad at both.
---
60k EHP? Are you sure about that?
---
This post gave me aids.
---
most of regions are dead...ty CCP  for infinite anoms and rorq minning....80%active population is in delve this days...bots included
---
But that's true for all the max cargo Indy's. Only the small ones like the nereus can truly survive banks.
---
dude 6qb in stain got several good agents and no1 botter to farm lp...ccp fucked up big time when they spawn infinite anoms and spod....every1 and theyir bots are farmin afk in anoms...game is very nice balanced
---
He’s the type that think people don’t sit in channels and talk shit and have a merry time while ratting/mining. In his world you have to be mindlessly sitting in front of a computer screen doing nothing.
---
That’s what happens when you play a game not to have fun but to fulfill some other need. I have friends that we could have fun doing almost anything. Space combat especially on a large scale is not fun. So i guess everyone involved in any super cap fight is also a peasant because they are not having fun... shit at least when crabbing you can chill and talk shit without people getting mad about sperg.
---
Also ironically his definition of peasant would make everyone with a legitimate job a peasant.  
---

Why did Goons bring a 1500 man fleet to Geminate today? And what did they accomplish with that fleet?

Join Pandemic Horde. You will immediately be in the middle of political drama as the two largest alliances have a hard on for Horde.  You will probably get into fights within an hour of entering horde space. 
---
And cost 12 million each which is... I mean... Nothing
---
You can also recreate the fun times sitting on Eve forums shitposting for SP compensation in front of the loading screen while CCP took the servers offline for unscheduled DT after every major release. Try not to get emotional when you reach the log-in screen of your birth, and realise how much of your life you’ve lived in New Eden vs planet earth that every major RL event you can time to each one of these screens and all those moments you shared with so many pilots who were cruelly stripped of all their history by greedy SP brain vampires are gone while you still linger,  asking one simple question: WHEN WILL YOU MAKE LOW SEC SMALL NANOGANG VAGABOND CAnCeR VIABLE AGAIN CCP!

Not that I would ever live in Minmatar space but I can definitely +1 the idea of going to a smaller trade hub. Lot easier to find a nitch to work and maybe a community to fly with. Plus the Ammar/Minnie warzone has always been good for some action. 
---
You know what Stain doesn't have though ..... 
---
Saw the flair and thought of the cute doomchinchilla
---
the guy I replied to did
---
&gt; forgetting the fact that Eve is againt losing yet another content provider because the game has become stale and boring
---
that's how replies work
---
&gt; If every possible loss can be replaced easily, people will not risk more. 
---
There's 2 issues. One is it's possible to strike a balance where big losses hurt, but aren't game-ending. A max dreadfleet from goons/panfam might be a 3 trillion isk loss, before supers even get involved. It's not the end of the world, but getting wiped like that would still hurt. 
---
&gt;If big risks are **possible,** it is quite normal that people avoid them more often than not
---
The second issue is that the "big risk" here (losing all your titans, becoming unable to defend your sov and getting evicted to highsec) isn't just *possible.* It's *required* if you want to commit to many strategic fights in sovnull. Titans+fax are so good there is *no counter other than more titans*, so if you want to fight someone's titan blob (or take a capfight that might escalate to titans), you *must* field your own titan fleet. Most people look at that and say "I'm not risking everything over a fort, but if I don't they'll drop supers and wipe us" so they go home. We get formup/standdown fleets and muninns instead of brawls. 
---
I like the idea of big risks too, but this is a risk people are provably not willing to take often enough to keep the game interesting, so it shouldn't be mandatory for big fights. 
---
That is amazing
---
alphas can only have industrial level 1
---
That stings just a little.
---
Its almost like CCP redesigned the way T3Cs worked because they were too good at everything and out classed all t2 cruisers (except logi)
---
Abyssals in caracal can be done up to t3, is way better isk
---
Fits fine. You have a 90% (ideally higher, with abyssal stuff) with web. Its meant to be hard to hold down by utilizing the web to essentially make something not able to keep up with you if it has you scrammed. AB for pulling range and getting transversal to blap with rail guns. MWD for general purpose kiting and using the web to keep things from actually tackling you. The AB is just insurance that you will scoot out scram range quickly.
---
A 90+% web means you can do either, look at a dual/triple prop vindicator, same thing.
---
I Kommissar my way, not as reddit pleases.
---
Napisan?
---
Mechanics definitely play a part, though. Good game design makes fun strategies also be successful strategies. You don't have to sacrifice an advantage in order to have fun. Bad game design creates perverse incentives, providing "success" for [playing in an un-fun, even miserable way](https://www.ign.com/wikis/destiny/Loot_Cave). 
---
Nobody wants to punch themselves in the balls to win, but if you make it a game mechanic and give out XP and prizes to the best ballpunchers, someone's gonna win that prize. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
what the proteus needs is an actual speed sub. the heat-bonused ab one is a joke, and the hyperspatial is pretty niche (though interesting enough that i like it). it's just stupidly slow with no good way to improve it. 
---
Can you tell me more about how NPC can kill citadel?
---
If you do that no one uses rorqs.
---
Lol this must be fake he didnt die to a super?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysmLA5TqbIY
---
What's the highsec tradehub ranking nowadays?
---
For sure.  I would think with the wealth of experience and data that CCP have at their fingertips, they could design mechanics that would both allow players to have and use their caps (Since its fun for the person) and prevent this "stagnation" (for lack of a better word) in the global game universe.  
---
It's why I don't hold true to the Eve is Dead meme.  Eventually the servers will turn off, but I can keep hoping CCP will continue to introduce fixes and good content.  
---

To add to this. If you want super low effort OP (obviously less income) this is the setup I use.

5 planets all making their own T2. I set them to 5 day cycle times and reset them once a week. (I set for less than exactly a week so i KNOW they will be ready to reset whenever I decide to on the weekend) then I pick up when, during my resets, I notice the pads are going to be full before the next week.. I’m not sure how often it is feel like every 3-4 weeks.
---

Copyright is fuzzy personal data is very specific. It won’t be easy be we have to do it. All the business plans that can’t deal with GDPR will  probably disappear.

This is the most sensible opinion I've heard on this topic, and I have come around to your way of thinking.  Maybe we need a referendum on removing supers/titans from the game?  Maybe   
---
a Playerbase vote?

does anyone have a spreadsheet where I can find the ship with the highest stats in say, inertia or velocity?

What if you just give an option to enter the citadel ID, and just have a brief explanation on how to find it?

NJC AAR: (Hopefully Garbage got video with comms of this :heart: ) I was scouting/scanning the chain when I ran into an NJC (New Jovian Collective) helios that was scanning along with me. Assuming they were in our chain I struck up a convo and asked if they wanted to pew.  he said maybe, he'd get with some of their guys and see if they wanted a fight. We found their hole a couple sigs later and got a scout inside. 
---
NJC decided to try to bait us out with a Drake running ore anoms. I got my Proteus onto him but decided not to engage as the main body of their fleet was 1 system over whereas ours was 4 jumps up the chain. I did warp in on him and decloak, then immediately warped off. This was enough to trigger their fleet responce, which they did in customary style, bringing a heavy armor mix of Drekavics, Guardians, Harbingers, Prophecies, Sacrileges, Bhaalgorn and a lone Zarmazd to the table, with the incumbent bifrots/magus/heretic stork.
---
Our scout had called their fleet comp when they undocked so I called to respond in our own heavy army fleet of Proteus's, Drekavics, Guardians, Magus, Sabres, Vindi and Bhaalgorn. They were milling around one of the wormholes in system about 20K off for their cheap brawlers, and about 40K for their more expensive stuff with their Guardians in a little pack about in between the two. My fleet warps into system and takes the hole, holding cloak, while my Proteus cloaky slides into within 7500M of their Drekavics.
---
I call for the fleet to warp to me and I decloak and get tackle on the Zarmazd that was with the Drek pack. He immediately starts pulling range as the fleet is landing so we switch primaries to the closest Drekavic to try to burst him down. I call for ewar drones, damps and Bhaal on their Guardians but despite this their reps are holding. i switch targets one more time to their prophecy right as our god boosher lands an MJFG on their guardian pack, landing them 100 off and immeditely siccing ecm drones on one while keeping the other tackled. This Boosh basically won us the fight.
---
At this point we kill the prophecy, a Drek and a VNI as their logi is burning in. Our dreks are fully ramped and we start hitting with the entire fleet, calling overheats as needed and breaking their reps one by one. Slowly, their ships began to fall as our dictors kept everything bubbled and we scooted around the field spreading tackle, killing their guardians, their Bhaalgorn, the last Drek and finally the Zarmazd that had burned to 170K away but our god boosher had kept up with and got us a warp to on.
---
Many GF's were had in local as we scooped as much loot as we could and headed back home. 
---
Friendly loses: 2 sabres, 190 Mil. 
---
Hostile losses: 19 ships, 8 billion isk.

Evernus is the new age shit that all you hipsters use.  IIRC EveElinoor was the original thing that did this back in 2005-2006.

Hyperspat has that agility bonus that the Prot needs so desperately however. If they changed the heatbonused AB abomination to something that just gave a flat boost to MWD/AB speed. I'd be happy if my Prot could get up to 1300, 1050 is definitely brutal slow
---
Howdy!
---
I just saw this post. I actually wrote a VNI ratting guide. You are more than welcome to share it around if you find it helpful.
---
I created the guide with my current region in mind, so the only things you would need to change are the types of drones you use, and the damage resists of the rigs you add.

I hope I am allowed to link this. If for some reason it gets deleted, I will message you a link directly, op.

Nice
---
If you wanted to brawl, you could lose the mwd and add a battery and repper rigs, and duel rep and he could tank a whole lot more. If you wanted to kite, you could lose the eamns and AB for an additional magstab or nanos, and throw in a LSE to be a lot faster and do much more damage. He's got cloak too so he can pick his fights and dictate range before decloaking. 
---
that's cute and all, but i'm not wrong

logging in is cool and good, do it more and you'll be more powerful

As for the Bhaalgorn in the end, I was told to bring it in, then the order was given to break off as I was in warp. Didn't go well for me. On the plus side, it wasn't actually *mine*, soooooooo...

Alphas can only get level 1 of their racial industrialist. Iteron V on lots of lows for maxing your potential cargo.
---
Not only that but gallente have the most diverse indy ships. Ore, mineral, and PI specialized ships. Their fast hauler (Nereus) also has a drone bay and can fit a 800 dps/s passive tank.
---
didn't they fix the wardec issue?
---
whats the point of a roundtable now lmao
---
They are educating themselves on how the wardec changes affect people so they can take that information to CCP. Otherwise know as "Doing their jobs".
---
Step 1: destroy the 100mn VNI
---
Step 2: Make the Proteus field 5 heavies
---
makes catching someone ratting a lot more interesting

Nice! Really hope you can make it.

It's called Blockade Runner roulette for a reason.  Sometimes you get something juicy.  And sometimes nothing.

Don't feed the fedora wearing troll.

They use an exploit to delay Concord by forcing them to spawn on the opposite end of the system of what they are ganking. CCP doesn't care though, even though they explicitly said it was a bannable offense.

A wardec change has happened. They're not finished yet.
---
And it turns into an actually viable BLOPs ship
---
Id say Evernus is the successor cause It has a better version of EveElinoor built in lol

&gt; Close to the two best L4 security agents that this game has to offer.

thanks for your appreciation though and i hope you have a good night

Well we were against all odds in the Casino war. The point still stands. If you don’t fight you lose.

The whole film was a wonderful blend of goon childish humour and razor sharp satire, sadly I think both are lost on a lot of people today who take everything too seriously or lack the capacity to see why things are worthy of poking a little fun at. Eve is such an easy target when you consider it’s a bunch of grown men playing with spaceships and yet get super salty if you insult their space bushido )
---
What the hek?
---
&lt;3
---
same. feels bad man. there will be more.
---
Lel? hisec safe pvp pussies talks 'bout options. Sounds like a bad joke. 
---
I agree. Was just thinking the humor of a buncha eve players crashing a schwanky place like the Biltmore.
---
Elo is the equivalent of space herpies. He comes and goes and everyone acts surprised when he shows up like it's never happened before 
---
Logging in more rorquals and skill farm alts 
---
Mhm yes very fun
---
Nah ill stick to my mains until my plex runs out next year
---
Honestly
---
I also neut primaries when fighting passive armor tanked ships 
---
hauler agility is a big deal too in places like lowsec. You can get sub 2 second aligns out of a Wreathe which are cheap as shit.
---
that was just an emergency bandaid. the "fix" is currently being worked on
---
Jita, Amarr, Dodixie, Rens, Hek.    
---
Jita was a decent spot as well, just we were all spread out a lot more. 
---
That's fine with me.
---
You'll get different mutaplasmids in different effects, all the other loot is the same I believe. I think dark is tackle and prop mods, gamma is shield extenders and boosters, and so forth. 
---
You're mean.&lt;3
---
Nope, they can out-rep T2 logi too, but they generally have lower tank and it costs a lot of isk to make it happen. But they can have links and reps on the same ship, and can take a blops bridge as such. So they are better at logi than logi too.
---
When I started the Prot was a brick tank, hump the leg, and face melt with blasters PvP king. It was the first T3C I wanted to fly followed shortly by the rail-gu. I think it's sad how they've been relegated to "Meh"....
---
Thanks mate. I didn't consider the muta to be a variable.
---
So no change I suppose
---
My username is right there. 
---
sorry brisc you dropped the ball here ( but good on the moderation BTW ) , wasn't the main issue was that up to 70% of the wardecs have nothing to do with merc contracts ? Everything always came back to two miners groups and what ifs and what aboutism . I think everyone is fine with Dec's like those that remove a structure , chase people out of areas ect , its the other 70% that needed to be discussed
---
Red Alliance blobs are another fun ancient piece of history.
---
To be fair: Elo is still a very young guy. Iam sure, he will be back at some point in the future. People then just need to lower their expectations and not jumping on the Elo Knight hypetrain like crazies. Is Elo a good FC ? For sure, we all know that. Does he have a 15 inch dingdong to cure us all? No he doesnt. Is he a good longterm alliance leader? No, he isnt. 
---
Just enjoy the next BL revamp as long as it lasts and then go on with your eve life. 
---
Elo has always been like this. 
---
Eh tank isn’t really the issue. Range is. They don’t have the dedicated logi range bonuses so while they’ll rep well it’ll be super short ranged. 
---
shut up nolak
---
decs need to be localized. in the typical mindset of a highsec PVE player they have nowhere to go when they get a wardec, so they log out und quickly quit playing alltogether if they get decced more than once in a while.
---
i heard that by anchoring it on his main, nidia is able to turn mobile depots into raitarus
---
Its weird how one guy leaving (or not) can have such an effect on an alliance
---
An excellent place to stop and rest on your way to the majestic frontier of Great Wildlands
---
They actually have a large range bonus (1150% for legion), but only to falloff, and they can only fit medium reps. ranges are usually around 35-40km which is more than enough for repping dudes anchored in a fleet

The main issue was that the meta for dealing with most war decs was folks logging off for a week, and the data showed that when folks did that, they stopped logging in period. 
---
That's the real issue we're trying to fix. 
---
what happened to him?
---
Cant imagine people would use the proteus to rat in that case when ishtars are a thing.
---
He's very new, and that was his very first time in a bhaalgorn. He's also got an amazing attitude, always looking for fights, scanning the chain, and incredibly willing and eager to listen and learn. He's one of our favorite people in the corp, and he's the one that posted the video. He asked for what he did wrong as soon as he posted the vodeo and we told him what we know, and he doesn't make the same mistakes twice :)
---
I'm sure you're a perfect pilot and have never done anything silly especially in your first 6 months playing this game, but for those of us normal folks he did an amazing job given his lack of knowledge/experience.
---
I am amazed you took the time to write this.
---
Quite frankly, I don't understand why, but I am still amazed
---
  I got to play during those times and take comfort in the fact I got fun fights back then you could fit a ship properly and get 1 v 1 or good fights like 2 v 2  or 2 v 4 etc you could also get some awesome moments like killing a vagabond with a vexor or rupture 
---
This is such a classically Eve thing to do. Cutting off hands is so last year, we're filing GDPR complaints now.
---
Quick question... after the ESI URL change, I get stuck loading EVE IPH because it is getting 400 errors retrieving my existing characters.  Is there an update to fix this?  Alternately, how do I get it to stop trying to do that long enough so I can recreate my character profiles?
---
i dont see the proc pointing him, how come he didn't just warp out?
---
fuuuuuucckkkk i wanted too goo... fuckin work 
---
People logging off and not coming back when they have a negative experience is always a risk, but Wardecs are perhaps the most egregious example of something where the balance is completely and utterly fucked.
---
What does a wardec target get out of being the target 99% of the time? Zero. 
---
Can they realistically fight back? In 99% of cases, no.
---
Is there really any risk to a wardec aggressor? In 99% of cases, no.
---
Let's put the cool-aide down. What the vast majority of wardecers want is easy kills against undefended targets travelling alone through major pipes or to/from places of commerce. There's a reason they have 98% ISK ratios (https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99001134/stats/)
---
Wardecing 100 alliances and 50,000 players should require hundreds and hundreds of billions on the line. If you stick up like that you should be inviting all of EVE to come down on your head.

I will sadly be unable to attend, as I will be in class at that time :( But I will still participate in a sense. Find out who gets the most kills (actual last hits/killmarks) with their comet in the fleet, and let Leehams DaWildabeast know. I will give them a prize pack. I'm not exactly sure what all I will put in there, but it will be worth at least 1 bil. My history in SLYCE has made me love to see proper police work be carried out!

Each system that has been in place has had an inherit flaw. The nature of the sandbox and the spectrum of playing styles means the next system will have a flaw as well, but where does the balance of acceptability exist. High Sec and corporate/alliance entities have not had attention for a long time. This issue ultimately brings to light numerous flaws in the existing system beyond just wars.
---
I hope the solution proves reasonable, but I lack faith with CCP's recent track record of new or neglect of existing content. I must agree that there is something to be had for incentivising conflict among smaller groups and defenders. This was far more prevalent under the pre Inferno system, but the culture of Eve is tough and you should fight for it was also much stronger then. Furthermore knowing who to fight and where to fight was enabled by the watchlist system supported these smaller conflicts, which is lost with the when being removed. So why bother looking at all when you don't know when you can find a target, so the counter is large economies of scale of wars done by a few groups. The cost of supporting reasonable content is so high that there is limited point of participation from groups that can't counter with scale the lack of when that the watch list provided.
---
I don't agree that high sec or any sec should be a risk free no pvp zone. I also don't think another version of faction warfare or null mechanics is the answer either. However, a fundamental and practical vision of the intent of high and for that matter low sec with the associated balance of risk and reward needs to be kept in mind while the risk of mechanic changes that lack alignment with existing mechanics has such meaningful implications.
---
Thank you.

I think that the Ishtar is really popular for these sites, but I hate drone boats for this stuff, so if an Ishtar is okay, certainly a Cerberus can be too?

The top advice to any beginner in Eve is "Don't undock what you can't afford to lose." The game allows it, but in most cases everyone should avoid it. Eve is not a game of dexterity, it's a game of decision making. And I think it's a strength, that it also allows "very bad" decisions, which might be correct in some niche cases only. This is also true for higher levels - from corp up to coalition.
---
With or without supercapitals - being the weaker party and in defense is not fun. Ask Hard Knocks or those who were evicted by Hard Knocks. Keeping a "fleet in being" to make the campaign unfun for the attacker, too, is a valid defensive strategy in Nullsec.
---
Eve has enough room for fun fights - try to kill or defend some Rorqus, go in a roam or try to stop one at a gatecamp, ... If strategic campaigns were guaranteed fun for everybody, too, they would either be not strategic, but a series of fights where nobody can be really defeated, or the strongest coalition would soon conquer all the galaxy just for fun.
---
About faxes: I think the big problem is, that they are way too strong for their price. The current faxes should be heavily nerfed. Lower their tank somewhat and make them specialized logi for capitals, with severe penalties when repairing subcaps or supercaps. At the same time add "super faxes", which have the capabilities of the current faxes, but also a price somewhere between supercarrier and titan.
---
Single points of failure are not a great long term plan, plus EvE needs more FC's. Ah well

&gt; What does a wardec target get out of being the target 99% of the time? Zero.
---
I think this is the fundamental issue with wardecs that needs fixing.
---
there's absolutely no reason for the targets to engage in the activity. it provides a level of risk that's basically "certain death" for absolutely 0 reward.
---
if ccp introduced that as an activity, you'd never fucking do it.
---
imagine a marauder only abyssal site with a 30 second timer. you'd never make it to the first gate before you threw your isk down the shitter. that's essentially what wardecs are as the defender - an abyssal site with a 30 second timer.
---
the defender needs an incentive to participate, rather than to go and play something else.

I predict that you will run in to the same fundamental flaw of the bounty system.

Any reason to fight will be sufficient that you'll wardec yourself with a 1 man alt corp in order to abuse the 'payout/reward'

Not sure if you got the memo but if you brawl you die. That's fine in your standard 2B Marauder (tho stupid) but it's not fine in your 300B AT ship.

  As Stitch said this fit is not for brawling. The AB is just there to sigtank when at range, gtfo when scrammed (which works because of the 90% web) and positioning when the mwd speed isn't needed. Nothing at all in this fit suggests brawling.

As a player who d like to fight the wardeccers the only problem I have is out of corp logis. These should get a criminal timer for assisting a wardec engagement (Not a suspect engagement). The advantage merc corps have is already retardly strong. Logis should be in the corp.

That is correct

Mittani said on the meta show that he thinks Horde is shit for new players and he would like to see them eliminated. Given the recent events on the map, horde having less allies than last year and TEST marching north I would expect more of these eviction style of fleets from now on.

As a Drek pilot, it mattered. I could barely shoot for most of the fight, and once I ran out of cap boosters I imploded.

&gt;That's the real issue we're trying to fix.
---
Should it be? I think this is a fairly closed lens (i.e. trying to make the current wardec system give the defender a chance to... fight back? hide? evade the war?).
---
I think the "war-requires-structures" change was a step in the right direction, but not playtested enough - all it's done (from experience, but looking at the data would be interesting) is taught highsec about holding corps.
---
What if corporations themselves were forced to become more meaningful (i.e. provide more benefits / access to things like incursion payouts, but at significantly greater cost, or are somehow more difficult to make), meaning that the corps which fold at the first sign of wardecs aren't cost-effective to create, and the remaining corps are more inclined to defend their investment, or react in a way that isn't "log off"?
---
Ultimately, mechanical band-aids can't help but feeling like frivolous cat and mouse, like banning Ventures or Atrons in faction war plexes.
---
I really wish we would stop thinking winning by ISK is actually winning. What real war or fight is based on how much something cost. Shit guys we lost $10b and they lost $5b but we obliterated them all but they still won because it costs us more.
---
NO... it's all about last man standing. Period.  Who ever kills more ships wins.  Even if someone kills a titan  but you killed 300 of their entire fleet that cost half that. YOU WIN... That's it..
---
and HACS are just better than BC like for like. 
---
But it does depend ALOT on tactics, strategy and a damn good FC.  Otherwise don't matter what you bring.

But I am a little confused as to the choice to neut Sacrileges and the Damnation. They are bound to be passive tank and use missiles, so would not seem to have much of an impact. Whereas the Drekavac, Guardian, Brutix e.t.c. needs their cap to do their job. But hey, when the PVP shakes hits things can get a bit crazy, especially in a Bhaalgorn where you need to pick your own primaries.

Finally it also prevents super caps and titans from jumping gates

These are all personal data.

I heard it prevents everyone from taking gates, not just caps+
---
Is this true?
---
I almost never find a player in the PST timezone, much less in Washington.  It would be nice to find others. 
---
Any of those two scripts will make it so that capital ships cannot take gates (carriers...titans). I believe it doesnt apply to rorqs, freighters and orcas tho. Subcaps can take gates no prob.

Sounds like you clicked align and warp-to to two different points in space
---
Actually the proteus hyper sub is prob the best out of all racial propulsion subs. It gives bonus to both agility AND warp speed/acceleration. Other racial propulsion subs give bonuses to either agility or warp speed/acceleration. The covert hunting proteus is pretty good. With two plates, hyper sub and hyper rigs it has a sub 4 sec align time and over 7au/warp. Not to mention long points and scrams. 
---
Funny guy in amarr militia, shame about the stroke he had writing that
---
What's the difference now? Do you mean citadels, or the escalation changes/drifter introduction? I can't even remember if drifters and citadels were the same or different releases. Were FAX the same release as citadels and those are what "killed wormholes"?
---
A Proteus tanks less than a Deimos but will do more DPS. It’s actually the opposite, T3C will tank far less than they used to but do significantly less dps. The removal of T3 resists hurt them a lot.
---
This was downvoted even though it's practically a direct quote from CCP regarding why T3s still have SP loss lul.
---
You know what else would work? Using a screenshot button 
---
 Shut up retard.
---
Not on the topic of HICs and sort of an aside, but any scram/point will prevent any ship from docking in a citadel 
---
Bigger problem: Capital cap boosters.
---
Capital cap boosters completely negate the previous subcap advantage, capacitor warfare.
---
Nice to meet you *Ms Shut up* 
---
Rorqs, freighters incl. bowhead and JFs are. The orca isn't.
---
The easiest way to tell is the S, M, L and XL label on the ship tree.

---
Cap neuts+cap cap boosters simply make capital warefare a seperate game rather than make it be intertwined with subcapital ships.
---
That's a solid point. Cheers
---
They arent separate, just on a higher level, think about it as about cruiser -&gt; bs progression. 
---
Subcaps still have their seat in those fights.
---
No T3 cruisers don't have to be expensive. A tech 2 fit Loki or tengu does better then this cerb for only a small increase in cost. And you can refit to travel fit for safe traveling.

They are called exhumers and expedition frigates and yes, you can totally fit them for combat if you wish.
---
Holy shit is that really him?
---
People use VNIs because you can use one even with an alpha clone. Which is also why you see so many bot Gilas and VNIs - a banned account can be recreated using one or two injectors, and even with very conservative ISK/h estimates for a bot it can pay itself off in a couple of days (well before the ban hits again).
---
T3Cs are not viable in the same manner, as they need a LOT more skills to be good.
---
Its a bit like Formula 1, best pilot and ship is going to win the day most of the time. Put a poor pilot in a blingy ship and they will lose it regardless of the skill points they have invested in.            
---
          
---
Its more pay to skip than pay to win, so much of the pvp is about bringing the correct thing to the party and using it in the correct way. Most of the skill is in learning the fights you can reasonably take and anticipating the opponents actions.         
---

Unlike WOW or similar when you die you lose everything with some ships having $1000+ values paying cash can be crazy expensive.  Choosing to pay a subscription and buy a plex pack every so often can keep you in ships whilst avoiding the grind. People regularly say dont fly what you cant afford to lose and its a good way to start.

Subcaps obviously still have a role to play, just look at the booshing against nc. Keepstar. But they gameplay is focused around avoiding the caps altogether.

Thats a bit sad :(, and a problem

Tengu used to be king but since the t3c rebalance its not as good but still viable.

Keep moving be cap stable with 1k+ tank for the rat damage type, some have a boss like rat in a room or two that throw out different damage types so consider refitting for the final room.

Maze in gurista space is the easiest in my opinion but you should be able to complete most 6/10 7/10 8/10 and 10/10 9/10 is not worth it. If you are scanning run the drone sites as well and bring a salvager.             
---
             
---
Some of the site will not be worth it as they take too long to run. Pith a medium shield booster and pith x shield boost amp with a monoprop 10mn Ab is the starting point for your fit.           
---
Practice on the test server by just scanning them down and dont be afraid to bling the low slots and use implants for dmg and range its worth it.

This is a great resource.

okay but why 
---
the skiff says hi.
---
&gt;What if corporations themselves were forced to become more meaningful (i.e. provide more benefits / access to things like incursion payouts, but at significantly greater cost, or are somehow more difficult to make), meaning that the corps which fold at the first sign of wardecs aren't cost-effective to create, and the remaining corps are more inclined to defend their investment, or react in a way that isn't "log off"?
---
I don't think it's possible, really. You cannot force people to do PVP if they don't want to. If they must do PVP to have a "good" or "effective" corp, they just won't play eve at all - it does not change the current situation at all.
---
Bump them away from each other!
---
Every statt in eve is hard. Can you remember? 
---
&gt;there's absolutely no reason for the targets to engage in the activity. it provides a level of risk that's basically "certain death" for absolutely 0 reward.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;if ccp introduced that as an activity, you'd never fucking do it.
---
That's the mechanical issue of war decs, I agree. They are needed to remove structures. For everything else there's ganking.
---
Problem that you cannot fix without making capitals complete shit. 
---
Yes you can.
---
1. Log in
---
2. Select character
---
3. Log out
---
Would have been nice of you guys to get rid of the POS for us, maybe you can come back and finish the job.
---
I think there needs to be the option for the defender to know the location of an enemy structure(s) so they can have the ability to try and end the war early. 
---
We recently had a month long war Dec from a 4man group who I saw log in once. I ended up looking for hours near where they lived to find the thing that was keeping them able to war Dec but to no avail. I was even looking for old pos they may have (I searched well over 300moons). Basically killed my game for a month. Wanted to fight the aggressors but had no way to do it ended up faking till war finished.

“Kamikaze” Armed Hull
---
The “Kamikaze” Armed Hull is a new monstrosity used by Serpentis and Angel Cartel. Using newly deadly manufactured drugs,  they take control of free capsuleers minds and arm their ships with deadly charge of new explosive before making them explode on enemy fleets.
---
C.O.N.C.O.R.D  is extremely worry about this new modules surfacing.
---
This “Kamikaze” Armed Hull will reduce ship’s hull structure and replace it with a detonable charge which will destroy the ship upon using it and explode in an area surrounding it.
---
His apms are just so high he wrote all that at once to let you all know

Structurable Neural Interface
---
New research in Artificial Intelligence &amp; cloning have reached a new era by allowing to manipulate “zombie capsuleers minds” which can be programmed with a strict automated behaviour.
---
“Zombie” Pill
---
Serpentis research have broken again on extremely dangerous new drugs. These “Zombie” Pills will reduce a capsuleer mind to no will. Capsuleer will follow any command given by bound capsuleer, and will be able to fit Structurable Neural Interface.

Tests have shown that effects last about 1 hours for each capsules.

Masthodan

New enormous and very complex ships have been seen used by Angel Cartel and Serpentis. Masthodan ships are said to require multiple capsuleers to be flown, and possess unseen until now firepower, size-ship, shield, hull &amp; armour capacity.

&gt; The top advice to any beginner in Eve is "Don't undock what you can't afford to lose."

Yeah, my argument here is basically that people took this rule to heart - but to get a big fight in sovnull, you have to be willing to break it in *spectacular* fashion. Most people aren't willing, so we don't get a lot of fights outside the smallgang scene. 
---
That’s how mafia works

Imo all you need to do is:

\- Only allow a corp to be war dec'ed eg. 2 times pr. year and the time span of the war be set to structure timers.

He won't be banned, input broadcasting is still allowed its just a grey area like others.

Falls under the 'don't make it obvious' level of ban threat.

Funny you don't post pictures of all your input broadcasting rorqs that pull their drones on the same server tick. *Thinking.......*

---
Not sure but he killed a rate my ticks carrier then said it was an overview bug and had to pay a fine
---
Well, I mean, people would troll with something like that. But yeah, I don't believe it was a troll.
---
why would you bother input broadcasting for something that's 1 hotkey press per client?
---
you can hit the hotkey as you cycle through multiple clients per server tick.
---
LMAO GOONS ISBOXING RORQUALS. WHAT A BUNCH OF LOOSERS. WE DON'T DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT. WE'RE EL33T!!!11

---
it's not about him being under canadian whatever but it's his customer who is under EU law. So he have to provide same ways how to deal with personal informations.
---
&gt;see what CCP says.
---
So like, in 6-8 months, if they even look at it at all?
---
Marshy is far from the friend of Lazerhawks lmfao. 
---
don trolleone was proven as broadcasting multiple time over last year, yet ccshit did absolutely nothing, nothing at all
---
"Per server tick" that would mean they all go in 1 after another. No they all disappear at exactly the same time.
---
We have lots of videos of them doing it. we are just waiting to make an hour long montage that we can show the rest of EVE. and my internet is kind of shitty for uploading videos.
---
So it might be he forgot it was on after setting his UI correctly across his accounts. But me personally i've seen goons with 10 rorquals on the same grid input broadcasting 50 excavator drones to get back into drone bay, as local spike. Laserhawks does right in defending Mafia, there is no real evidence of Mafia using it in a illegal way, unless u count this chat thingy... xD Because some goons that mine with too many rorqs use this daily.
---
I too am making an 1 hour long video of my rorqual warping of at the same time, i do that by simply pressing "Fleet  warp".

That is Trump yes.  I don't remember the whole context.  I was fitting ships and overheard the convo on ts and shadowplayed.
---
&gt; No they all disappear at exactly the same time.
---
yes, because you can cycle through mutliple clients and issue the command per server tick.
---
server ticks are one second, it doesn't take a full second to tab between clients and hit a 1 button shortcut.
---
you can cycle through multiple clients and hit the shortcut every server tick. this has been demonstrated countless times, usually after some moron overstuffs his freighter and gets murdered by a guy with a handful of catalyst alts.
---
but hey, if you think you have evidence of wrongdoing you're welcome to post it.

Lets see if CCP dares take any action.
---
Im betting they will look the other way
---
Thanks. Just came back from before when T3C's had their rebalance.
---
So is it u that rekt me in my astero then hmmm?🤔
---
It has been years (8 I think) that I didn't play eve online. I know that there is a "free" version and from what I found it's limited to alpha clone, slow learning, up-to-battleship and medium weapon ?
---
I cannot realistically either play like before or put a tone of money into the game but I still want that free experience.  
---
Is it realistic for me to start a new character, go for small ship (rifter with some interdiction stuff)  and aim at exploration or some small head-hunting and get a battlecruiser (or more) to get some actual money with the missions ?  
---
Since I don't know the current meta or the state of a free account I would like your opinion on that. If that's just impossible and I have to get a real account then just tell me.
---
Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V, enter, Ctrl-V, enter, Ctrl-V, ... 
---
Well he just did "make it obvious"
---
yes, maybe 2 or 3 would get drones in at the same time, but 10 rorqs? or 30 rorqs? fuck no!
---
I touched him there. Oh shit no no you tricked me
---
I also don't check the fits i'm talking about 
---
not talking about rorqs entering warp lol
---

---
I'll call my Texas space law and bird law enthusiast 
---
would be a win, if 100s of rorq pilots got banned at the same time imo
---

---
That's the best one I've seen, ever
---
Waaaaa! It was a bug! Waaaaa!
---
do you always try so hard to be edgy or is it just when you crave the attention that you thought this post would get you and then you realised that the true masters of Delve are the cloaky campers and nobody really cares about him talking in local by accident?
---
feel free to post 30 rorqs simultaneously recalling their drones, and let people judge it for themselves. vOv.
---
Ahhh yeah that makes a lot of sense
---
Fairly certain there are no exceptions for input broadcasting. You are allowed to use tools for example for window adjustments/switching that include broadcasting if you do not use the input broadcasting.
---
I would take one for the team if that were true. 
---
He 100% input broadcasted intentionally, probably just forgot he had it on when chatting.
---
Homest work for honest pay
---
With Eve-O Preview, I don’t even need to take my fingers off Shift+R to recall drones on 10+ accounts within two server ticks.
---
I’m sure there are some people who input broadcast, but it’s not hard to run multiple Rorqs without it.
---
Often. 
---
i personally have not recorded it, but sure. next time i excavator hunt in delve ill make sure to have shadow play ready, because i have experenced them doing it before.
---
So in the end did he win eve and then go outside and smell the grass and play with the birds?  It cut off at the most important part!
---
"Those other guys do it so when we do it we should get away with it" uh-huh, ok there champ.
---
Not for ccp, 'the logs and screenshots, they show nothing' 
---
mad respect bro
---
Your post is toxic
---
&gt; We have lots of videos of them doing it. 
---
Then fucking post them.  I don't like blue botters any more than red botters.
---
&gt; and nobody really cares about him talking in local by accident? 
---
You noticed he didnt talked in local on my screenshot ?  
---
You also noticed he talked with more then 1 character at the same time ?
---
Anyway,
---
So you say, because you maybe got the evidence ( or atleast think you got evidenve) that a goon was input broadcasting, it is ok that everyone else does the same ?
---
&gt;a nd then you realised that the true masters of Delve are the cloaky campers .
---
You are right, i am litteraly terrified by the 0 times i got attacked while mining.
---
**PLEASE STOP IT**
---
Or 30 rorqs lighting a cyno at the same thing. That sort of thing definitely would never happen.
---
He asked for stupid ideas smh
---
There is always a small group of toxic players in every game. Most ppl i've ingame are really cool and willing to help when a newish player like me hits a wall. Maybe you're hanging around the wrong players?
---
did it alter any value of ingame items or get anything destroyed ? talking in local isnt a big deal, i guess it was banned because scam spamming in jita local etc. but when 50 rorqs recall their drones, they save atleast 10b in drones so that guys like olmeca gold and others dont get them etc!
---
And no, i dont support any kind of illegal stuff, but look at the severity of each action, one is heavier than the other!
---
 YEah they use asic miners these days 
---
Did I ?
---
But clearly if he is input broadcasting his typing he is input broadcasting his actions in game, ergo he is cheating.  Cheating and losing nothing and cheating to save 10b are the same thing.  
---
At the end of the day who is really "hurt" if I bot mine in 20 rorqual 10 hours a day every day?
---
But the real question is: How much toxic could a toxic toss if a toxic could toss toxic?
---
ur brain broke 
---
Yup
---
He (as in Mar5hy the character) was literally blue (+5) to Horde a week ago.
---
&gt; So you say, because you maybe got the evidence ( or atleast think you got evidenve) that a goon was input broadcasting, it is ok that everyone else does the same ? 
---
talking in local and being able to save drones from being killed are very different in the advantage you get by doing it. Not sure how talking in local is an "unfair advantage" so please if you think it is clarify it for us all.
---
Uhhm, that's not how it works. People who call out Toxicity and Toxic players cannot be Toxic. 
---
Fixed :)
---
This is the first time ever I see Don Trolleone doing something actively.
---
Haven't read the post but a fly through had me spot the word "toxic" at least 10 times so I won't even bother reading further.
---
Just a question: How did you get the idea it's an unpopular opinion?
---
Always has been since I joined in 2014.  A couple times Hek came close, but Rens is a bigger hub by number of orders.  
---
&gt; he forgot it was on after setting his UI correctly across his accounts. 
---
So he was doing something bad he just forgot that he was? Solid Logic
---
"ergo he is cheating." excuse me? he could be logging in/fixing windows, chat windows etc. my client always start out in 3.4*3.4(or whatever) ratio and not wide screen/fullscreen.
---
Unless u can provide proof of unfair advantage, your comment should get a smack.
---
Sticks and stones...... man up! 
---
I don't know how it works either but if these are genuinely at officer level I would expect to pay around officer prices for them, no?
---
I'm not sure how to check 1DQ's total number of orders, but I'd guess it's above Rens and maybe Dodixie.  I was just listing the traditional highsec stations. 
---
Video games are full of Toxicity and gamers are Toxic people bent on spreading Toxicity through the gaming universe. Barely anyone ever mentions just how Toxic this Toxic community is. In fact I never see people use the word Toxic to describe it so I figured I would bravely do my part and call out Toxic behavior in EVE.

I wish you a good night.

Input broadcasting has been a bannable offense for a very long time. The only thing that's acceptable at this point in terms of multiboxing is client switching and monitoring. 
---
They need to remove the mined minerals from the game too (yes even if they've been made into ships already). Stop people accepting this in their alliances.

He is using this technique to insta cloak all of his bombers when he logs them in the exact same time.
---
He is fast typing, let it go.

pbuh xd
---
did it give any unfair advantage ? i dont think so, did the 30 rorqs' input broadcast save some of their drones, hell yes.
---
Just alliance mates that try to defend him.
---
Well yeah it always were, but I thought it had died off a bit in the last couple of years. Maybe it's just coincidence, as every time I've gone through the area I tend to pass through both and Hek always had almost twice the people as Rens. 
---
not logging in, or changing the UI apperence ?
---
Holy shit you really are defending this dude. Yikes. I would say having to spend less time setting up a UI and configuring window positions would be an advantage over somebody who needs to do that manually. 
---
[removed]
---
They've both died off, but Rens has more orders.  Hek has more people on occasion, but Rens averages 75-100 in local during the weekends.

i dont see proof though, so why write?

If he jumped off a cliff would you suck his cock there too? gayyy

this guy's skull is too thick, we need to hunt those rorqs again, and ill provide footage.
---
Sure, it might be a bannable offense, but surely rorqs should get banned to the teeth in that case!
---
Didn't understand why it was so good.  Until the end.  Well done. 
---
You seem pretty upset by this if you go and find a forum post from 2014 to prove me wrong. 
---
Are you having a tough time circle jerking over the goons petty attempt to get rid of the campers because they refuse to pay him to leave or come to an agreement about the AWOXing of NPSI fleets while all of your miners are REE'ing about losing there precious little excavators?
---
Sounds like he got mad because someone on that list likes ladyboys IRL (stop using your slack email address to post on those sites!). Not my cup of tea but each to their own.
---
sure it might save him 1 min, so rorqs could have mined in peace for 1 min longer than normal, i get it. But is it illegal though, i see multiple comments saying fixing UI is not bannable if done with input broadcasting.
---
There is no way we players can proove it. However ccp gonna check this player now, and everything is visible in the logs.

You should have thrown in Cancer and Hitler a bunch of times to max the shittiness of this shitty troll post

Sounds fair. Pity, I like the red skies and all, but I can't even justify having a market alt there anymore.

You got it confused.

You can use ISboxer (or other tools) without broadcasting functions in any area of game.
---
You CAN use broadcasting functions in areas such as character creation or modifying game settings. You only shouldn't use it in a way that gives you unfair in-game advantage.

This makes Zero sense and probably proves you are the guy trying to be edgy in newbro fleets thinking you will make friends when in actual fact most of the TS room has muted you after about 5 minutes of your consistent attempts to be funny.

Ofcouse i agree with you on that.

Obvisouly you have a much bigger advatage if you input broadcast while rorq mining or even running your own fleet, stuff like that.

&gt; I'm pretty sure that no one actually gives a fuck.

hmmmmmmmmm
---
He's not wrong to be fair, catching bots is actually more fun than catching someone AFK. at least the way i hunt it is you have to make sure you get which site they are in, where they warp to, either setup a bubble trap or log off on there warp in and guess there timers. Catching someone AFK is easy.
---
Isn't it 60? I think his post a few months ago said he had 60 accounts. 
---
Elo is missing, fc what do? ... Fc?
---
&gt;  I would say having to spend less time setting up a UI and configuring window positions would be an advantage over somebody who needs to do that manually.
---
CCP doesn't think so, and they explicitly classified these kind of actions as those that does not give someone an unfair advantage. He could have just logged in his 100 characters with broadcasting (which is legal, and which I am certain I would do it if I had to manage that many characters), and then forgot that it was on.
---
The foul smell in this thread is Goons using metagame to get rid of an undesirable person, blaming him with a kind of breach of EULA that itself is rampant among their ranks. It's almost too similar to how many among Goon leadership did way worse things than Gigx yet defended he is the one who should be permabanned due to moral reasons.
---
I am not saying broadcasters shouldn't get banned, but his way of doing it is way more harmless than Goons' way of doing it. As someone who's often subjected to Goon metagame tricks, harassment and brigading I can symphatize.
---
Sure looks like a message to copy and send to the same chat from all of your alts! Logic checks out.
---
Then report those players for doing it, the same way Mar5hy is being reported for it. Just because others do it is no excuse for someone else to break the rules. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQXqKyKWFqY

---
Actually last time I looked it wasn't banned for chatting. 
---
Marshy has streamed himself logging in each toon. Afaik there isn't a "log in all" broadcast button
---
ik him well and yeah it was taken
---
I never thought I’d see the day where I became tired of reading the word toxic.
---
Your post history yikes. 6/10 bait tho
---
I personally am against any kind of automation that takes place outside of the game client. I understand that setting up the UI is supposedly legit but I think that is it'self questionable as it opens a door where people can claim "Woops I was just setting up my UI and I forgot I had this exploit running". 
---
"sorry that was my TV" isn't a good excuse and it stopped being funny in the 80s. Also aren't you supposed to be silver now? Gigx was a moron who crossed the wrong people and burnt all his bridges. Eve history is littered with the carcasses of people like him, he isn't special. If you dislike input broadcasting in it's current form maybe you should vote for somebody who supports your viewpoints.

---
i highly doubt he will get any sort of punishment  I mean i bet he already was reported for input broadcasting, not sure these chat logs will make a difference. I guess there would have to be mass reporting of that thing for them to even look at this case
---
So u agree this is a minor offense, obviously not meant to write in local what he said, probably just logged in since it is not long after DT either. Do u think this warrent a 30 day ban?

Market Hacking Array.   
---
When targeted onto a market station allows the pilot to manipulate a random market order price at will and blocks the owner from accessing it for the duration of the timer.
---
Market ECM
---
Targets a specific trader and blocks them from carrying out any trades for a specified period (the 0.1 isk counter)
---
Market Nosferatu
---
When targeted at a station selects the owner of a random market order and sucks ISK from their wallet in an amount based on the size/meta of the nos
---
Market Neut
---
Reduces the price of a targeted market order by X percent per cycle.
---
Trade Heist Module
---
Deployed within a AOE around a station, acts like a MTU but uses elite sleeper drone technology to infiltrate station hangers and steal items at random before depositing them into the container
---
Market Doomsday
---
When targeted at a market it projects a EMP burst that shuts down all market and trade access for a specified period.
---
Kidnap Module 
---
Targeted at a station it pulls a random player out of the station. 
---
Market traders like to convince people they are doing PVP - so it’s time they faced the same PvP risks as combat pilots )
---
This would stop afk market runners and bots since you;d give them some counters they’d need to activate like market shields etc
---
‘
---
It depends on whether he was using it for other illegal things or just to log in. I think CCP should look into it. If it's just one chat accident it shouldn't matter. I think CCP should also look into Delve Rorqual broadcasters.
---
good we agree on something :)

That was in response to the previous comment where he thought marshy was input broadcasting the logins.

Bring back anchoring structures to moons, all types. Your jump gate or cyno beacon will sit alone on that moon. No more half a dozen structures on grid with a gate. You want to mine every moon in system? Well, you won't be able to have any EC or Citadels. Limit keepstars to 1 per system.

---
I think you are missing the point, even assuming that he did use it only for "logging in" ^(like yeah you need to be dumb as fuck to believe it) he did input broadcast to the client after this - what mean he will get a 30 day ban if this is his first offence, or perma ban if it is 2nd one.             
---
**Tbh i am glad he will get punished because i have enough with competing with guys that 'click fast enough to do stuff on 10-40 accounts at the same time'**

But defending it because other people broadcast makes sense to your prion addled brain. I don't have a mic but keep trying, it's obviously what you do best. 
---
For your sake and ours
---
There are just too many of your random thoughts scattered in this post for me to sift through and compile a proper answer. But let me give it a try.
---
&gt;I personally 
---
Most of us look into what's allowed and what's not before doing something. If I had to use 100 characters, and it was allowed to broadcast while log in, I would do it. It doesn't matter what Xenuria personally thinks about the issue. You can argue that CCP shouldn't allow for broadcasting of any kind, and perhaps that's a legitimate argument, but currently, they do and that's all that matters for the purposes of this topic.
---
&gt; Also aren't you supposed to be silver now 
---
?
---
&gt;Gigx was a moron who crossed the wrong people and burnt all his bridges. Eve history is littered with the carcasses of people like him, he isn't special. 
---
I couldn't care less about which space cult you support, which space cult you hate or which space cult you derive a sense of belonging. 
---
I care about who is right and who has principled reasons for their positions and arguments. If alliance A's leadership blames alliance B's leader for doing something morally wrong and demands a ban, but alliance A's leadership has way worse things in its history, alliance A can't be the one to offer lessons of morality on why alliance B's leader should be banned.
---
&gt;If you dislike input broadcasting in it's current form maybe you should vote for somebody who supports your viewpoints. 
---
If in-game broadcasting is banned, then CCP should look into Delve Rorquals. I don't have to elect a CSM to demand that rules that are already established by CCP to be enforced.  That's a pretty stupid thing to say. 
---
Send your war example to Brisc, give details it is this type of shite that is killing Eve.
---
What I will say after listening to this absolute laughable round table is just how stupid most war deckers are, Sol can't work out that he has his mike turned off then complains about someone talking when he did not say a word and Dom having a convo battle with someone in the discord to make himself feel better and all the people who had so much to say when I was in the war dec discord did not say a bloody word.
---
Seriously after that if CCP want to cater for that lot they need their brains tested.   I was going to get involved in this but my wife wanted to watch a film together with a bottle of wine and the film and the bottle of wine won easily.   I just listened to it and I have to say that this just reinforced my total contempt for PIRAT and their super carrier or plex funded blanket war decs..., wtf!!!!
---
TFW literally anyone does literally anything, and a reeing bunch of space dorks immediately start screeching about how it's ok "cuz gewns". 
---
Yeah man

Goons using this=fine. People who kill goons are using this=reeeeeee.
---
While the op is the most blatant troll, it's kind of true though. Eve has in general gotten a bit worse in this regard over the years. Hell, I've gotten a lot more toxic over the years. It started out as a bit of friendly HTFU stuff which is what Eve is basically structured around, but as the playerbase and game has developed toxicity in general has risen quite a bit while masquerading under the htfu this is Eve thing.
---
Maybe the players have changed, maybe it's just a general culture shift of the internet itself over the last decade and a half, but Eve's gotten a lot more Hello Pussy (see latest wardec changes as an example, but the overall direction of the game the last five years or even more with damn near bulletproof bearing etc), a lot safer for everyone, and still somehow far more toxic and cancerous when it comes to internet tough guy ism. 
---
I've caught myself being so much worse than I used to be and I see it from so many people elsewhere in Eve too. People are meaner, douchier, taking far more pleasure in that, and there's this feeling that trying to hurt the actual people you're playing against is the goal rather than winning whatever conflict you have with them in the game. 
---
It's not like it was non-existent before, but it's gotten so much worse. There's actual _hate_ between groups that I never used to see. There's very little respect for worthy but beaten opponents, instead a whole lot of reddit or local hurfing about 'cucks' and otherwise trying to shit on people for... basically not being _you_. 
---
From highsec through low through null and... fuck knows in WHs I haven't been there for a long time, but I doubt it's that unique. 
---
Yeah, shitpost OP and all, the Eve community has gotten toxic. So has much of the rest of the internet, but I don't really feel like that's an excuse as much as something to work against if we can.

To be honest, when i used to vexor roams right after the ban of input broadcasts, i would paste a mispelled smack talk line into fleet window. Then have the 20 or 30 man fleet copy and paste it into local. 
---
Just to see people rage about how i was going to get banned for broadcasting 
---
No, he is totally right. CCP even came out once and said that input broadcasting to set up windows, settings, etc. On multiple clients at the same time is fine as well. 
---
Thx that's great :) Any advice or link for the skills? Been a long time I don't remember the opti. Al path for exploration pve or pvp.

EVE is basically full loot pvp for fucktards.  Can you name a full loot pvp game that is so devoid of player skill and that caters to the most pathetic of risk averse grief monkeys? ie: commonplace suicide ganking.

Join Pandemic Horde in Nullsec and enjoy Eve.

for exploration, you just need a racial frigate IV, and all the skills under scanning (you can only train them to a very low level so you can get all of them very quickly). Use a T1 exploration frigate such as a Probe, not the Astero. For a battlecruiser, I guess get something like a Drake, Caldari BC IV, then train heavy missiles V and all the support skills in the missiles tab (I'm not sure what the mission running meta is).

At any point did I defend Eve? No I just commented that you have an unhealthy obsession hatred towards a game that is not healthy. Sad it really is. 
---
if you, as a goon, admit to reporting a goon to CCP for botting, you will instantly get kicked
---
Only if the warp core strength of the ship is exceeded by the amount of points of disruption.
---
Broadcasting for logging in multiple accounts is technically allowed.
---
Broadcasting to scoop drones is not allowed.

Let's see, how much did you lose to a suicide gank? I'm actually gonna guess something comically low, like 2b or so. For some reason, that makes it funnier.

Please explain to me how input broadcasting to a rorqual is beneficial at all because I can't figure out how that would help you at all. Only thing I can think is warp-outs or maybe drone commands but warp-outs are handled by fleet mechanics and drone boradcasting just doesn't sound necessary unless you're literally multiboxing 10 rorqs. It's just not a lot of clicks involved in mining

That but put the toad on a rorqual.
---
You said you wanted all forms to be banned, correct? 
---
&gt;YEah they use asic miners these days
---
And i was thinking he is a smart guy...  But hopefully he gets banned for that if TRUE! 
---
Obviously what we want do is get people to play the game more, and a war dec mechanic that encourages people to undock is preferable to the previous system where logging off was the best strategy. 
---
Defending EVE is the reason for your thoughtless reaction.  Where are you getting it from that I am "so much anger", "so much hatred"?  
---
I think you are just an ignorant person who is too stupid to understand that things aren't always so black and white.
---
I had some time to kill and I thought I'd have some fun with your dumb-shit EVE defenders.  Just because I use harsh language doesn't mean i'm angry.  That is a stupid assumption and what we call "projection."
---
There should be ways that can be implemented that aren’t gameable. The idea of a war bomd that is put up by the attackers but can be won by the defenders can’t really be gamed, for instance. 
---
Actually there are quite a few examples of people convicted from encouraging people with diagnosed mental illnesses into suicide (as mittens’ target had).
---
Literally google it. 
---
Thanks for being a retard. Keep sipping that mittens coolaid. 
---
If only everyone else had amassed into a single group of 60,000 characters or so -- then they could have easily countered our utter dominance of the CSM voting.
---
Christmas is over, you need to believe in something else.... 
---
Who said it was recently?
---
It’s not because of the negative experience - it’s a specific tactic used to get the war invalidated. It’s not a rage quit, it’s the best move the underdog has, and that’s the problem. 
---
I agree with the rest of what you wrote, and finding a way to change all that is going to be the challenge to the system. 
---
here is the link you requested 
---
:)
---
truth hurt?
---
Make sure to submit a ticket aswell.
---
No? Where?
---
I'd just love to see current rules being enforced.
---
more fun to speak the unwanted truth and watch you EVE kids lose your collective shit.
---
Hey as long as you keep pretending youre having fun
---
You do you
---
'niche' isn't a bad thing. things have niches, it's fine. but it doesn't compensate for the fact that there is no way to make the proteus anything other than a pig when it's not in warp
---
Suitonia will be calling. 
---
I'm only halfway through listening to this, but you need to revisit what the problem is before coming up with these unworkable solutions i'm hearing.   
---
As already shown through the evidence which led to this conversation, it's larger, more established pirate groups attacking smaller, non-militarized industrial groups.  
---
Any solution involving war goals or structure bashes has to consider this. I'm not saying the bears don't need to attempt to defend themselves, but the mechanics must reflect who they are trying to protect from quitting the game too early.  
---
And oh, by the way, any war goal mechanic based on ships killed or isk can be exploited in a wormhole by delivering ships to the enemy and destroying the structure contained therein.
---
agree, worthy way of going
---
i dont have game installed.  
---
Does the unwanted truth hurt?
---
deal with it :)
---
yeah but that is a niche use. i'm not saying it doesn't have applications, that's what a niche is. but the roles the proteus can fill are extremely limited, because it's basically impossible to make it move at any decent speed
---
Utter domination is extremely fun, yes. For a bunch of folks who claim to enjoy PVP, they sure are shy around feelings of domination and conquest.
---
Thanks for making me waste five minutes but I couldn't find an example of somebody being convinced of "counseling" a suicide (the legal crime of talking somebody into suicide) that stemmed from a single comment on the internet. Every case I saw was a pretty extreme amount of "counseling" to the point of describing techniques or truly abusive behavior.
---
I'm not saying that what the mittani did was cool (honestly the guy is a sociopath) I'm just saying he didn't break the law. If you can bring up an example where somebody saying "go kill yourself" was later convicted of "counseling" a suicide please do but I just don't think there is.
---
all input broadcasters are cheating equally and should all be permabanned.
---
“Soliciting to suicide”
---
Now google again. Remember, he encouraged an entire crowd to send this guy messages to kill himself. 
---
Keep sipping that coolaid tho. 
---
Just wait for EvE Classic: learning skills, 24 hr skill window, no warp to 0 stargates, no citadels, no asset safety.
---
When you think about it, EVE is just full loot pvp for fucktards.
---
There are no other games where dumb and bad players can have such an impact, being a protected class in high sec.
---
Than I would like to clarify how I differ in my views. I think all forms of input broadcasting should be banned and in their place Unified UI tools built into the game that allow for the end user to never need input broadcasting. 
---
ur fuckign thick-headed Xenuria. Olmeca_Gold is a god in this thread, and you are getting your shoe burned off.
---
That's cool. There are other full loot PvP games out there.
---
Respect da hustle. 
---
YEah we use asic miners these days, digging isn't hard.
---
“Soliciting to suicide” - there are plenty of examples in multiple countries/states e.g Montana:
---
https://leg.mt.gov/bills/mca/45/5/45-5-105.htm
---
I CBA to link specific cases but there’s plenty of them. 
---
Now go back and turn my downvotes upside down ;) 
---
which he most likely does, and it is not illegal.
---
Regardless of who they are, it is good general advice imo :) 
---
I can only say for sure that they don't go away passively after seven days. I had been hoping as much as I currently can't fly any of the things reported as soloing one down and there's been one parked in my go-to mining system for nearly a half month or so now.
---
Sooo did he get banned? 
---
its a joke, right?
---
i guess i need to tag the /s on there for you, don't i?
---
Watch him when he streams onlining his toons.
---
who cares about making EVE friends?  They are liable to fuck you over given the prevalence sociopathetic culture of this crap game.
---
Well that is your view, CCP views is what counts, if you think you're above CCP, you're a joke, and we all knows how corrupt the voting system for CSM members are, because Goons own almost half of all Eve: Characters ? (and dont quote me on that because what I really mean is that the corp/alliance is huge af.)
---
Ahahahaha, its good to see that he's still up to his old ways.  
---
He's half of the reason why Amarr militia chat was crowned most toxic militia chat of all 4 empires. 
---
Other exploits of his include asking for every 'nonessential member' of our coalition (read, corp directors and key members) to be banned from our coalition discord, pledging to destroy SBA (destruction seems to be still pending, right now they're more active than when he said that) after they didn't immediately give him admin to their militia wide teamspeak server, and other assorted tomfoolery. 
---
Nah, just restrict it to non-nullified ceptors and ecm ships, at least they will have a purpose again
---
They’re called Iaeptan Titans 
---
No judge is going to convict somebody of that law because they told a person to "go kill yourself" one time, or because they told a group of people to do it. It takes an actual effort not a public ploy for attention.
---
Source: Montanan who watched numerous people get told to kill themselves (myself included) and no criminal charges were ever brought up. (My mother actually worked in suicide prevention for years and years here)
---
While it's morally fucked, and legally ambiguous, it isn't a clear violation of the law. Or at least a big enough violation to actually get somebody to press charges.
---
I didn't ask you for a law I asked you for an example of somebody being convicted. There are shit tons of laws that are not applicable anymore. That's a fun Google "ridiculous laws that are still on the books"
---
I had an old boss tell me MT law used to be if a woman left her toothbrush at your house for a week you became legally married.
---
https://ww2.harford.edu/faculty/DVolkart/Handouts/odd_state_laws.htm
---
Mittani broke the law like I break the law every time I drive my truck because I think seatbelts are pretty fuckin stupid
---
Blizzard: Diablo Immortal, Warlords of Draenor, Battle for Azeroth, Heroes of the Storm, the cancelled project that later became Overwatch.
---
Bethesda: Fallout 4, Fallout 76 (Bonus round: Nuka Dark + their collector's edition bundles as well) Not going to speak on anything else from Beth.
---
OP should procure one
---
ITT: Goons who think putting the same message in a bunch of chat channels on the same server tick is proof of input broadcasting but a group of rorquals operated by the same person lighting 40 cynos on the same server tick isn't.
---
I too like to spend my free time harassing people that play a video game that I abstain from. It's a perfect pastime. 
---
Im guessing you are in an npc corp?
---
I lose 2 bil pod a 6+ years ago.  That was the day I stopped paying a sub FYI.  It wasn't so much that the loss effected me as it was the cherry on top to realized how shit the game really was.  Here you have a protected class who you can't retaliate against in a meaningful way who takes no risk for their reward.  The game just isn't worth playing imo if you can't autopilot in high sec.  It is time consuming tedium and the rewards aren't worth it.
---
I'll pay  100mill to your rival to kill you in front of your most frequented structure
---
So I make 3 corps and am immune from war decs. Wow, what a great solution...
---
except, that's not true. CCP has specified what is and is not allowed. 
---
&gt; Ones that actually require you to aim.
---
Irrelevant thing to bring up since the point has obviously never been to aim your guns in combat. Not that point and click adventure games such as WoT are any better. Stop your vehicle, wait for the gun to be accurat and click. Very nice..
---
Isk rules everything around me. IREAM skill skill injectors ya'll.
---
Most people dont want to spend their free time playing videogames trying to create a meaningless empire of self-importance, but i guess thats what makes Goons the winners of EVE online the videogame. 
---
Can i have your stuff?
---
White knitting?   Impress your KKK friends with your hand knit klan robe!
---
all hail hy wanto, princess of new delhi 
---
but its beside the point, it is not illegal
---
Also in the tutorial mission. You put bombs in the frigate the agent gives you and blow up an enemy base
---
It's a video game.  You're the one on the kool-aid here bud.
---
Is it weird that I'm actually considering moving to Hek (or Nakugard more specifically) after reading this? 
---
Dude was just so high skill he could alt tab that fast to blaze them cynos.
---
according to shazam, it is: [Prem Joshua - Dakini](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSFp4y_YSgY)
---
Literally the #1 recommended change to bastion modules right now
---
I really don't understand this new thing we're doing promoting various highsec markets.  But's it's getting old fast. 
---
Nah not really. Just lol’ing about the fact that nothing is going to happen to Mar5hy yet all the goons seem mad 😅
---
Don't RMT accounts actively loose ccp money though? They're selling isk to customers that would otherwise be buying them from CCP
---
Demonstrably false. Throughout the entire game, this is all that players have ever tried to do. If you don't like the way empires are built today, that's fine, but don't try to tell me that players have not wanted to create empires. That's just silly.
---
wot isn't a full loot pvp game you dumb fuck.  
---
I mean the camping alts don't do anything 99% of the time, they just sit there cloaked. You don't really need input broadcasting for that
---
And aiming your guns to hit ships has never been something in EVE so why did you bring that up you manlet?
---
Cyno.
---
Same as before but can only fitted on battleships. Old module goes the way of anaconda mines (removed).
---
OK, so I spend an hour a day doing incursions, and i make 100m/hour because we're terrible and it takes us 20 mins to do a site.
---
in a week that's 700m isk.
---
that's what I'd have to be able to earn from participating in a war to make it worth my while, plus extra to cover any costs of participating in the war.
---
now multiply that by the number of people in my incursion running corp.
---
lets say there's 40 of us since you know, high sec incursions are a thing for 40 people so you're looking at a war bond of at least 21bn isk to wardec us to make it worth our while rather than just saying "fuck this we'll go and play whatever moba/battle royale game is fotm right now".
---
as an attacker if you told me it'd cost 21bn to wardec a 40 man corp, i'd tell you that you're off your rocker. even if i felt that i wouldn't lose the war and my 21bn was safe, the fact that i need that much to declare a war, and that i'd then not have it available to fund the war... yeah.
---
the amount an attacker would have to stump up in order to make it worth while for a defender to even think about participating adds up really quickly. this also assumes that the wardec actually ends after a week
---
also what happens when i don't bother logging in for a week? i haven't won the war so i don't get 21bn isk - but the attackers haven't done anything either, because you can't attack some one that hasn't logged in all week. is that a default win for them? does it roll over in to a second week?
---
probably wont happen. as olmeca_gold(the guy that multibox and stole over 1trillion in excavators from goons) said perfectly in the other thread, input broadcasting log ins isn't illegal, CCP has said what is and what is not illegal. so its not for anyone to wage their opinions on this matter. Though it is illegal to broadcast in chat channels,(for obvious jita fuckery reasons) this at least is kinda obvious that he used only for loggin in and forgot to turn off. And it didn't give any unfair advantage at all. If he get a 30day ban, make no mistake, CCP will dig deep into delve's multi rorq users. And there will be change.
---
Island life is best life.
---
I like to think of it as forum pvp.  I'm basically seal clubbing right now since its the EVE community.
---
The fastest alt tab in the south
---
You know your region has problems when you have to ask your own promotional committee to go there.
---
the only milimetre measurement  is how close darkness is to getting steamrolled by goons again.
---
You and I must be playing a different game, because way back when I used to live in a small corp highsec, including when I was its CEO, we mainly logged off because our usual gameplay styles became suicidal while under a wardec. 
---
Not feeding kills was a big part of it for sure, but it wasn't the main reason, and trying a different activity such as going to lowsec in cheap ships was a non-starter because trying to put a small group of ships together was a non-starter because all of the trade hubs were camped by insta-locking T3s.
---
Out of the god-knows-how-many wardecs I've been under in various corps, the total with any actual content was... I think 2 of them, both where the attacker was after a specific structure. The groups who wardec 100 corps at once have \*never\* provided any meaningful content. 
---
oh man, it's even less isk than i predicted, jesus christ dude let it go
---
Is anyone shocked by this?
---
\[Light Recon Drone\]
---
Small drone that can be piloted remotely providing intel back to owner.  
---
Ability to jump thru wormholes and stargates to report on conditions observed.
---
Transmitter Range = 15 LY
---
Two hour lifespan unless recalled.
---
Can be detonated remotely causing 1K Omni damage to a 20KM radius.
---
Lol @goons pouncing on every little opportunity like they don't farm the whole delve for rmt 
---
How did you completely miss the point that it isn't about the isk?
---
Who’s handicapped enough to need input broadcasting for rorqs?
---
it's not that i missed something, i just think you're lying
---
It's almost like said person was perm banned for it. Also, grath was claiming there's a video that we have yet to see.
---
Honestly take the advice and go to a nullsec corp. you are probably safer in Delve than you are anywhere these days and it’s far more profitable. 
---
Ok confirmed troll. Cya later.
---
His apms are just so high he wrote all that at once to let you all know
---
Stop trying to witch hunt a CONTENT cReATOR and spend some time speed typing u frickin loosers
---
All of this is pretty much why I quit League of Legends. The ego on players is insane ... people get to silver rank and think they're the next blooming e-sports celebrity while somehow managing to ignore the fact that they are still second from the bottom.
---
He was banned for RMT unrelated to that incident afaik.
---
the game is devoid of player skill is the point, and not worth playing.
---
It's the same argument about [people who pirate games/music](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/music-piracy-doesnt-hurt-sales), fact is they likely wouldn't be buying it from CCP if they **only** had the option to pay full price.
---
Man torpedo explosions used to have so much swag 
---
That is the official line.
---
Now that's an interesting prospect. I don't know how you have the endurance to put up with such an oversight.
---
I see what you did there
---
Thank you for sharing your opinion. All opinions are valuable and I want you to know that we care. Have a great rest of your day.

&gt; and we all knows how corrupt the voting system for CSM members are, because Goons own almost half of all Eve-Characters 
---
The voting system isn't corrupt, CSM elections use STV (Single Transferable Vote) and this system makes it harder for large blocs to get all of their candidates onto the CSM.   
---
&gt; Goons own almost half of all Eve-Characters ? (and dont quote me on that  because what I really mean is that the corp/alliance is huge af.) 
---
The Imperium is very large but it might surprise you to know that high-sec pubbies actually outnumber Goons as a voting power, they just don't vote... 
---
Let me ask you something, did you vote in the most recent CSM election; in any CSM election? 
---
It’s an obvious Gevlon bait post but I’ll bite. I don’t believe the Eve community is toxic, go to the help channel and you still see players answering and helping newbros and supporting them. You can;t judge Eve on reddit which is intellectual brain cancer where stfu ur mom F2P mouthbreathers come and whore for karma because nobody else will pay them any attention. The actual players invested in Eve have been smart enough to put up ESI walled gardens around their groups and stay within their own locked doors social platforms to keep the usual knuckledraggers out. Horde, GSF and others all have their own very good community values where friendships are still made. What has been lost, and the reason why there is so much hate between factions is a common platform that the official forum used to be, and reddit served briefly as before being overtaken by vote brigading memelords, where the community united in common causes and maintained cross faction bonds. Nobody is especially invested in the history or lore of the game, and with skill injectors characters are nothing more than empty task shells. Eve isn’t dying, it’s just becoming more insular.
---
Where do you apply in game?
---
Could you tell me more about amarr militia, please?
---
U mad bro?
---
&gt; we all knows how corrupt the voting system for CSM members are, because Goons own almost half of all Eve-Characters ?
---
Thats not corruption that's democracy you fucking idiot.  1 account 1 vote, that's literal democracy.

grrrr gons, i hat gons grrrr, i iz mad

The only ones "shocked" are those with skin in the game.

I did, but he wasn't elected.

[Capsuleer Pod]
---
"In an age of extreme violence, capsuleers sometimes need to move themselves unseen to prying eyes. To accomplish this, the new Entropic Pod Packager allows a capsuleer to repackage their own pod into the inventory of the station they are in and contract themselves to a hauler. During travel in this format, the capsuleer can only escape their confines by jump cloning."
---
You seem to know an awful lot about this game, despite never playing it.  Highsec gank victim confirmed. 
---
to be far they made bank on fallout 4 and overwatch 
---
Your post history amuses me. 
---
Nah, just restrict it to corvettes
---
counter uncomfortable truth: that's why most of us play it, we enjoy the toxicity.
---
it's a certain brand of toxicity that you just don't find anywhere else.
---
That isn't what I asked. I asked.

"Let me ask you something, did you vote in the most recent CSM election; in any CSM election?"

Write a rap about my beloved alliance and receive 50 mill. 150 mill bonus if it gets more than 50 upvotes in 1 day.        
---
Tips:       
---
The more anti-PL, the more easy to acquire votes (quantity)          
---
The more pro-PL, the better it will have to be to get upvotes (quality)
---
Next time just mumble something and earn trillions
---
Search red federation. Or over a character name like nitro Oxide.. 
---
A new kind of EWAR where a ships and drones can get hacked and controlled then turned on against their own side (for like 15-30 seconds at a time).  Kind of like how drone control be heisted today.   Think of it like "mind control" in WoW.  Scalable with EWAR, resistances and skills etc.
---
And instantly stop reading at "autopilot".
---
Literally one of the first things players will tell you. Don't autopilot. You were asking to get blown up and so you did.
---
Now show me any time where any one has been convicted of breaking these laws with a single comment.  Please.  I'll wait.
---
If I say to someone "go walk into traffic"  is that me encouraging them to kill themselves? If he does go walk into traffic and dies, is that because of the thing I did?

Liquidizer Tractor Unit
---
Tractors in corpses within 250km and blends them into nanite paste. 
---
10 nanite per corpse.
---
&gt;The game just isn't worth playing imo if you can't autopilot in high sec or do activities while afk.
---
So what you're saying is: the game is too hard?
---
Sorry abouit the loss but why wasn't that thing abyssaled to fuck?
---
I'd like to see you go against someone that knows how to properly 1v1. You know that in many games you need more than just the ability to aim well?
---
Its about squeezing the absolute maximum you can out of a ship that cost 200b.
---
Flop Off 8-)
---
Yes I do remember that thing that happened 6 years ago where the person who carried out the act was duly punished and reprimanded heavily for his actions, why do you bring it up?
---
Also last I checked "threatening to dox someone" isn't illegal anywhere, only actually DOING it is a crime.  Thats like saying idle threats of "dude you better do what I say or I'll hack you" are the same as actually breaking into a computer system without authorisation.
---
Passive Armor and Shield reps - costs % of cap like MWD. Obviously lower strength than active reps, but consistent (like each rep is every 1s.
---
An actual sig reduction module for low slots, and fuck off with the "its going to be OP" shit. Mids are already cluster fucked for frigs with basically compulsory propmods and tackle.
---
A Jump drive **module** for battleships and above. Would probably put blops out of business, maybe. Perhaps severe fitting costs, low LY jump range, high fuel cost, I dunno.
---
What illegal act did he carry out?
---
People still waste their lives in Eve?
---
It's dead Jim, let it go.
---
Didn't mean to say that Overwatch was a failure. Unless I'm wrong here, didn't some cancelled project (can't remember the name) eventually evolve into Overwatch instead. If so I was thinking about this unknown project from Blizzard that never saw the light of day.
---
Overwatch was good for quite some while. In my opinion it is far from as good now as it was before due to the changes. But the game itself did well. Same for Fallout 4 I guess, but at the same time it felt perhaps a little too much like a FPS.
---
No
---
Look at meeee, I am scrolling a website manually. 
---
nothing new - they are called F1 drones :)
---
&gt;if you have indisputable evidence like this, you will instantly get kicked and permanently blacklisted.
---
Care to provide some evidence of this? I don't mean that old Mittani ping, I mean an example of someone blacklisted for reporting.
---
CCP can't have that cos it will cut subs since it competes with scout alts.
---
Wanna touch me? 
---
RESTRICT IT TO THE WIDOW
---
oh your right, i think the made two game into overwatch, but even if they are not realy good games they made a good bit. with CCCP i think they kept there shirt on most endeavors like dust but that's about it.
---
He told people he was banned for input broadcasting, his excuse being that he assumed he'd get a temp ban and then find a different way to get around managing that many clients. 
---
Justifiably not the case.
---
"Aplha Clone? New to PvP"?
---
nice typo LUL 
---
One of the reasons I don't play this game anymore and give CCP money. Sure, they throw out a sacrificial lamb now and then, but they could give a shit about fixing the real problem. Those people pay for too many accounts for CCP to want to piss them off. Just how it is 
---
Is this post written to just antagonize people? 
---
Don't mine in niballe, there are 4 groups of players suicide ganking daily. Neutron Alpha is their cloak scout. Other than that Solitude is awesome.
---
boystin my dude man those were the times...
---
I do enjoy Solitude, Yet i run after incrustions now.
---
Shows how many goons there are on the subreddit that 2 posts about this are consecutive on the top of the sub. Good lord this place has gone downhill.
---
Suspect flagged is extremely vulnerable to counter already
---
&gt; Care to provide some evidence for this? I don't mean our leader literally saying this, I mean some _other_ evidence.
---
If you are using 15 Rorquals and just realizing bombers/booshers landing on grid chances are you'll lose 5 billion if you don't broadcast the scoop command.
---
How would input broadcasting help you camp? Warp all 19 of your campers to different sites in different systems at the same time?
---
never change r/eve
---
That's fine and I don't mind your position. But how you think rules should be changed really does not create a problem for Ma5hy if he was using broadcasting only for logging in (which he may well not be).
---
this isn't civil rights, this is destruction of evidence.  avoiding punishment for a crime
---
You have some serious mental instabilities. You should seek professional help. 
---
Ramping ewar etc on the trig hulls that should bonus ewar. 
---
Trig inty = ramping point.
---
Trig command ship = ramping combat bursts.
---
Trig HAC = ramping armor repair bonus.
---
It’s not evidence unless someone is prosecuting that crime. 
---
\-1 / 10
---
Bad troll
---
Rules change and so do CCP policy, this has happened before and it will happen again. 
---
Is RMT that much cheaper than PLEX?
---
Nobody shoots lasers at rocks,,,, nobody gets to build ships,,,, nobody gets to fly ships. Eve is dead.
---
Of course you played dark fall. That game had the worst community. Had being key word because the official servers were shutdown because Adverturine was a shitty company. 
---
I agree with all but Fallout 4 had a ton
---
 glitches yes but it was a good game. Dumpster fire for 76 tho
---
If you are multiboxing 15 Rorquals and just realizing bombers/booshers landing on grid chances are you'll lose 5 billion if you don't broadcast the scoop command.
---
Happens a lot in Delve. Bombers/booshers are the biggest problem of the Goon Rorqual krabs these days.
---
Your Reddit troll account’s posts/comments are at best 2/10. They are the equivalent of walking around your middle school asking everyone “losersayswhat?” Followed by reflecting on how good you gotem. But you didn’t gotem. 
---
I came here expecting at least a mediocre TGIFriday’s entree, perhaps a 2 for $10 appetizer. Instead, you have presented me the with the discarded wrapper of a jolly rancher next to a half eaten pretzel stick. But you’re charging me like it’s filet mignon. 
---
I’d like to talk to a manager please. 
---
I love how everybody groups all the goons together like we're a hive mind. Because there's no way any goons don't support cheating
---
If you're multiboxing 15 rorquals and you can't check Intel channels or be bothered to scan down the signatures in your system you deserve to lose excavators vOv
---
Don't forget in game voice comms that worked. Let alone a working chat system. 
---
Some dumb rorq pilots have been caught doing it (eg lighting 20 cynos at the same time) but there's little benefit to doing it in rorqs vs pretty much anything else. Rorq mining is so braindead that there is little reason to input broadcast
---
ITT people using CCP’s 3rd party award winning chat provider as authoritative data for investigations.
---
its not evidence UNTIL someone is prosecuting that crime.
---
prosecution comes after the crime is committed.    and if its deleted before the preosecution but after the crime. guess what, thats destruction of evidence.
---
not sure how it is in EU, but in US. thats generally considered evasion of justice.
---
and i KNOW it exists in some european countries.  It is a standard doctrine in most jurisdictions: in France, it is termed, fraude à la loi, in Spain, fraude de ley, in Italy, violazione di norme di legge, in Germany, Rechtswidrige Umgehung eines Gesetzes. It reflects the need for governments to prevent their citizens from intentionally and improperly manipulating their behaviour to prevent mandatory provisions in the law from applying to them.
---
now if EU itself overrules those, then EU has a serious problem
---
Whether it's because of the meta, or whether it's because of "usual gameplay styles becoming suicidal," the point remains that the standard tactic for dealing with a war dec when hit by one of the usual suspects was to log off. 
---
That's a bad mechanic. It needs to be fixed. 
---
Pirate corvettes only
---
And how do you think Rogue Drones came into life?
---
Holy shit, these are expensive
---
I mean those prices are cheaper than their officer mod equivalent. But most are better than them lol
---
Officer mod type stuff has always been expensive
---
what would you do with current strcutures
---
i can appreciate the hustle 
---
Obviously the war bond idea has to be part of a broader program designed to provide incentives. But the fact is, even if the isk isn't that significant (and the PIRAT guys admitted they spend upwards of 20b a week on war decs, so there's clearly money there) it provides more of an incentive to fight than exists now. 
---
And, frankly, fighting the war and winning a good amount of isk coupled with the fun of actually fighting back and having a reasonable chance to win (which needs to be part of the solution) should be enough to keep people interested.
---
I mean, this would stupid easy to photoshop. If the logs don't agree with the screenshot then the screenshot is fake. People want to hate on CCP for not caring about reddit 'evidence' but there are good reasons not to do that. 
---
its a fun place of friendship and cuddlyness and everyone there is nice and friendly all the time 
---
I'd buy this service!
---
did you just copy paste that analogy reponse from somewhere because it doesn't even apply.  Why do you think trolling is meant to entertain you, the ones being ridiculed?
---
we all do  
---
Yay
---
Off topic, but I had to laugh when I saw this... I have a good friend who operates a small organic farm, his helper one day starts describing what he does in CrossFit... farm owner says “oh cool, now you get to pay me for moving those hay bails”
---
Classic!
---
Wtf is asic miners?
---
Eve uses a different calendar in game. For the characters, 2019 = YC121. So these Skins were in celebration of New Years.
---
Do you often see revivals of New Years souvenirs? No, I don't think they'll be coming back.
---
who even is SBA anyways?  im not up to date with militia autism 
---
A remote assistance denial module would be very interesting. I'm picturing it having size classes like prop mods do, can't really fit it except on the right hulls sizes and it definitely doesn't work except on the same full size. When activated on a targeted ship, neither the target nor user of the module may benefit from remote assistance for the duration of the module, then it's burned out or on a long cool down. Requires lots of compromise from a normal fit.
---
I don’t know I’ve lived in rens my entire eve career. Sure it’s dropped off a bit but you can still make a killing here with industry, at least I do. Sure occasionally you got to import some stuff but the profit more then makes up for it. More industrialists should try it out imo. 
---
See, I’m so good at it you even thought it was a copy pasta. Trolled the troller. You’re as good at trolling as you are at F2P games. 
---
Now you can't spell risk without isk
---
better than capitals online sprinkled with botting VNI/Ishtar/Gila
---
Not that most Rorquals don't deserve losing their excavators but there are atm hundreds of command destroyers and covert cynoes logged off in delve specifically allocated to booshing or bombing. I know I can be on top of your drones under 10 seconds upon a log in.
---
 I've got time to kill while i wait in que for a game that i enjoy.   There is nothing wroth with criticizing pay2win games.  How are you so incredibly stupid?  I'm fine.
---
Unlikely as these are new year themed, next years will maybe look similar if they are not putting too much effort in, but will certainly have a different name and market group, so avid collectors will want the set......
---
&gt; If you are multiboxing 15 Rorquals and just realizing bombers/booshers landing on grid chances are you'll lose 5 billion if you don't broadcast the scoop command.
---
Now, I'm not saying that delve isn't botting the shit out of eve and CCP couldn't care less, but you're completely dead wrong. I used to run 12 rorqs, 2 hulks (to clear merc) and a sabre for screening, and with your hotkeys set up properly, including hotkeys to cycle through clients, you can issue the same keypress command to recall all drones to 12 rorquals in 1-2 seconds, faster if not for the fact that commands sometimes get lost if you do them TOO fast. 
---
You are all over the place and have no idea what you are Talking about.
---
Because wormholes never appear, and have a fleet pop out the moment they appear, right?

Make the Aeon a whole ship.

Something to do with bitcoin I believe. 
---
Some are, most aren't, If you are playing with toxic people, Change your friends.
---
Implying that CCP actually takes action often for this shit.
---
&gt; coupled with the fun of actually fighting back
---
these people live in high sec - they don't find that stuff fun, or they'd be out doing it. they don't find it fun. to them it's an inconvenience and it doesn't enhance their enjoyment of the sandbox.

Look again at the age stats for this game and call us kids again. [https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/2p2s7m/player\_age\_distribution\_in\_eve\_online\_oc/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/2p2s7m/player_age_distribution_in_eve_online_oc/)
---
While this is old data \~2014 \[but far more relevant than your broad assumptions\],  you can assume we just grow older. The thing is we understand its a game and we don't hate so much.
---
 You sir/madam/apache helicopter look very immature at this moment. 
---
Please do, as i and others suggest,  go outside and take a walk. Ships are tools and tools get broken.
---
You seem pretty obsessed about soyboys bro. 
---
Entitled gamer whines on reddit about a game he doesnt play anymore. Priceless.
---
Git gud or STFU!!!
---
&gt; At the end of the day who is really "hurt" if I bot mine in 20 rorqual 10 hours a day every day?
---
Every other miner whom your competition has devalued the output of. Every other alliance whose industrial capacity falls that much further behind Goons's based on the botted output.
---
Botting for mineral or ISK gain is bad for the economy and hurts everyone, and people doing that should definitely get banned.
---
You aren't getting the point. Suppose, hypothetically, that he was merely broadcasting for logins (and he had the chat accident by forgetting that it was on). Then he would be in compliance with current rules. You would be able to blame CCP for rules, try to change rules, but you couldn't blame him.
---
I think the hypothetical is true but CCP should look into it.
---
No, because you can then roll your officer module to get something better but not with these.
---
this guy’s series
---
https://youtu.be/LCdUCtvhqZ8
---
Local scrammer, only operates in trade hub systems.
---
If REALLY popular, It can be fit on a special class of ship that broadcasts a Local that rolls ships in system display back to 20 seconds before activation.
---
I guess be aware of bombers bar pings? My corp pings whenever they send a fleet out. Who else rage rolls for delve? I've never personally had a hole open and a fleet come out before I could notice and scan it. I feel like that's a situation that happens MAYBE once a year to a player.
---
Not the best company but still better than CCP.
---
CCP could multiply the size of their security team by 10000x if they made every alliance vet their own members by making a change like this.
---
Intergalactic Space Hobos approuve this message!
---
You might actually, considering all the other defenses I've seen.
---
You mean run or MWD’d into the nearest dumpster before cloaking? I’ll get my coat as well.
---
Why the fuck would cloaky campers be using input broadcasting in game. To launch, yes, but I see no use for it once logged. He's blantantly forgot to switch it off after doing his login sequence.
---
It does look like the designer was shown a cutaway view, and went with it.
---
Kronos - lose a high slot and gain a mid
---
Proteus - who knows, but I really want to enjoy this ship.
---
I don't really have a specific ship I think needs buffed, but a cruiser sized command ship would be nice.
---
Right now there isn't really a good links ship for HAC fleets.  CDs are too squishy, T2 Battlecruisers are too slow, and T3Cs are both too squishy and slow compared to ADC HACs.
---
So maybe like a Heavy Interdictor tank and bonuses, but with links bonuses in place of the WDFG bonuses.
---
its used to deploy bombs on excavators with his alt army
---
It appears that way, but in the end, you will likely be caught. Best case scenario is that the ISK gets whooshed from your wallet, possibly in to the negative. It goes without saying that you won't get a refund. Worst case, you get banned, and that account and any others tied to it are gone. 
---
IDK man. I guess I have to have to be in that situation and I haven't. I've always had fair warning. You even dreadbombed me once and I saw it coming like two minutes before it happened...
---
The Raven is way underpowered. More tank, less sig, and more damage would be greatly appreciated.
---
Also in general armor command destroyers should get +1 low and more tank bonuses.
---
Bombers should do more torp damage and have less sig. Maybe a bonus to AB would be good
---
Exactly. He uses scripts and broadcasting to fire up all his accounts. It has no use beyond that (unlike the guy who used to input broadcast wings of bombers on the same target)
---
He just forgot to turn it off. He ain't getting an unfair advantage in game, it's purely a quality of life benefit to get into the game.... with a gazillion accounts.
---
But the chances of actually getting something, is pretty low lol.
---
&gt; you can issue the same keypress command to recall all drones to 12 rorquals in 1-2 seconds
---
If the command is automated (say a keyboard macro) it is actually against the EULA. 
---
If it is manual you'd need a sequence like : 1 - G - 2 - G - 3 - G ... 15 - G (imagine clients being assigned to numbers, and G is your scoop command). Good luck doing that in one second.
---
Whenever people speak of broadcasters there is always your kind of a skeptic dude who says "how do you know it's not a skilled person". We are not angry neckbeards who call "isboxer" the moment some multiboxer saves his drones from us. As a prominent Eve multiboxer myself, I know what's possible and what's not. 
---
Show one killmail to prove it. His alts appear on them as he's got one in almost every system of a region to make tackle but there is only ever 1 or 2 in a single system.
---
I think you are talking shite.
---
MJD Missiles, like regular missiles but instant application &amp; probably less damage somehow
---
How am i entitled?  You aren't even making sense, idiot.
---
That's how the Mafia works.
---
(ツ)_/¯
---
Yes. Unbelievably so. You can also RMT for Plex itself and a ton of other items. Basically every MMO is like that though, cheap server farms in Eastern Europe and South East Asia where they bot hundreds upon hundreds of accounts and make billions of in game currencies every hour.
---
It's crazy if you read the stories of people who do it
---
The game didn’t protect ur stuff while AFK, bad things happened to you and a pitiful amount of isk was lost, now ur really angry and copy-pasting about full loot games that require you to aim. Gotttit, -4/10. 
---
I think if it were that easy to catch the people it wouldn't be happening as much as it is. I bet 98% of RMT goes unnoticed
---
Once again he gets caught doing it. Hopes CCP do something this time.
---
Anyone input broadcasting should be banned! do not care if you are BB, Goon, Dinoslut, docking monkey etc etc.
---
Literally unplayable. 
---
You are kids to me, and dumb ones to defend such a shit game as EVE.   I've been playing full loot pvp games since ultima online was released.
---
the truth hurts, I understand.
---
suck it up.
---
Oh this guy. He's been trolling up Amarr militia for years.
---
absolutely fine with me too. Less competition for ore would be nice. :)
---
"right to be forgotten"    can easily be considered evasion of justice if used to remove potential evidence in illegal activity.
---
hence, websites keep archives(aka no right to be forgotten) for if the courts ever come knocking.
---
that simple
---
I dreadbombed only twice and one of them I lost my stuff. I was hunting for an hour for that dreadbomb and even had my dreads undocked with people in NPC system. Drone booshing doesnt work that way. I steal most of my stuff in the initial 1-2 systems I log in.
---
tbf dude anyone who is clearly input broadcasting should be investigated by CCP. I don't have any doubt mar5hy isn't cheating (honestly...it wouldn't even help him to broadcast) but if there's clear evidence it should be looked at.
---
I have never lost drones to booshers so that situation I can't speak about from personal experience. I'd be curious to see how fast you actually go from showing up in local to being on grid though. I'm sure it'll happen to me eventually
---
He streamed how he gets all his accounts up and running a couple of months ago.
---
T3Cs aren't as expensive as you think they are - a HAM or HM Tengu is pretty similar to its Cerb equivalent, but you also get covops and travel refitting capabilities. Though I can see the ADC being really handy for those 'oh shit' moments.
---
You should probably host this on a website somewhere because it's a lot of words which will drop off reddit in a day and be wasted.
---
Like I said there is no doubt to me that he's not breaking the rules intentionally. But I want people who are to be investigated and if this was some dude with 60 hulks instead of campers I'd be up there at the top asking for him to be looked at
---
Based on what you just said, you’ll not believe it no matter what.
---
eve golden years....fuck minning and supers
---
Some pathetic fuck
---
&gt; So you believe it's OK for people to use bannable cheats as long as they're fighting goons?
---
No. I just think it's not Goons' place to mock people for broadcasting when it is rampant in their space.
---
&gt; Because you must realise that this attitude raises... questions about your own activities, right?
---
For the entire year I've been bombing/booshing Goon drones I had Goons questioning my activities. For the very fear of getting falsely banned due to being mass reported I twitched lots of my activity. You'd just prove yourself to be a moron if you want to question my activities today after all the content I regularly release.
---
This is like nazis whining that the KKK takes things too far.

---
It has happened once. I think it was some SKINs from YC119. They got renamed to remove the year from the name and then re-released.
---
You could forgive one accident but it has been recorded before of him doing so and regardless of it, input broadcasting anything other than logging in is bannable and no one knows if he has had a temp ban before so this would make it perma ban by all accounts anyway.
---
Anyone input broadcasting regardless of who they play for in game should be banned, end of.
---
Don't be an idiot. I've already explained why the game simply isn't worth playing and it has nothing to do with the fact it is full loot pvp.  It is a grief monkeys paradise.  Full loot pvp games are pretty much the only think I play nowadays.  Your full loot pvp game is trash.
---
Deal with it :)

I would venture a guess everyone did.

Yea they all willingly spend money on keeping data just in case they might be of public interest.

Now this is an exciting corp!

They wanted to recruit me to Solitude once.

---
The reason the Itty is the 'best' is because if you have Gallente industrial skills, you get the specialised haulers. Epithal/Miasmos/Kryos are unquestionably the best for hauling PI and gas/minerals around. And if you have Gallente Industrial IV and none of the others then the Itty is best.
---
For the Iteron vs the other factions' unspecialised T1 haulers the differences are pretty minimal.

True, most mining ships can be used for more than one porpoise

---
Triggering people is so easy in 2019, Roll on 2020 were saying hi makes people kill themselves ingame
---
I'll give them 15m isk to do it again
---
In best cases about 10 seconds. The ships are fast warping and the drones are really easy to scan. You can't fully rely on intel.
---
What fully works is not being afk and scooping the moment a boosher lands on grid. But that's not fully reliable if you are multiboxing 15 Rorquals. I think this is more than fair too.
---
The now named ironblood skins. I panic sold my Revelation skin, losing 5B-ish of profit. Grrr...
---
I give both of you 20M each to fight
---
I throw in 100M aswell
---
Hey, that's me! ;)  
---
That was an early isboxer thing for me; I accidentally had the output as square screen on one monitor.  
---
It was definitely magical. Noone thought what I was doing was possible, and a lot of fun mechanics (like total immunity to ewar/tackling in siege) were in place, allowing me to do some truly awe-inspiring getaways (like in the one man crew vid and the final fight of the video you linked). At the time, everyone assumed a solo dread was just a free killmail waiting to happen, and I was able to get application so broken stuff would literally instapop, something that, while impressive, was something I would ensure was fixed when CCP implemented my HAW guns design (http://failheap-challenge.com/showthread.php?14217-Fixing-quot-Blap-quot-Dreads-Rebuffing-Titans-and-Solving-General-Cap-Subcap-Imbalance) several years late, but better late than never.  
---
Unfortunately, my vision wasn't fully followed(you can see some obvious differences from implementation and my link above), and the members of the capital balance group weren't told of skill injectors + rorquals, resulting in the absolute shitshow the game is today.  
---
It's unfortunately very unlikely we'll ever get anything close to a balanced game ever again with the way we've been moving since 2011 (the beginning of the end). :(
---

Holy shit, everyone will become a market pvper at that point
---
If you imagine a "next client" hotkey, then it's a matter of bouncing between next-client and return-drones (or scoop-drones, I can't into rorq) 6 times in a second, and that is believable (source: use vi at work and sometimes type "n." a bunch).
---
Bellicose, caracal navy, typhoon fleet
---
20.01m isk or nada
---
I imagine there could be a way to set up a "swap to next window" keybind that would rotate them correctly and just hit that and then recall key, and then do something like end up in discord to ping if it's an actual drop.
---
Time to drain those alts of yours, Donny buy. 
---
from this link,  the same text here explains why Mar5hy did nothing wrong.  Oh snap..  His broadcast was nothing gameplay related,  giving him advantage over others.
---
Examples of allowed Input Broadcasting and Input Multiplexing are actions taken that do not have an impact on the EVE universe and are carried out for convenience:
---
• EVE Online client settings
---
• Window positions and arrangements (of the EVE Online client in your operating system’s desktop environment)
---
• The login process"
---
Yup and that time they treated gigx with the same leniency? Oh wait.
---
Sorry PIRAT, but your alliance is far from being clean with the botting Nyxes.

---
Friend ship
---
20.001 is the best I can do
---
But it’s not the fault of the high sec mission runner that they unknowingly bought a ship made with bot mined minerals when there is no way to discern this in game. I’d be fine removing mined minerals but that’s way to slippery of a slope to start removing items that were produced and have already been resold, admittedly it sucks but I don’t see a realistic way around that. 
---
I've seen some shitty mails in my day but this rly takes the cake
---
OMEGALUL ez gank :Clap:
---
they already banned gaara
---
Good that you spotted this - this is to raise awareness about lack of lowsec gate to Stain.      
---
I know - the only way to stop it would be to undock and attack the player. There’s nothing like watching isk sucked out your wallet to force non-consensual PvP onto players who make trillions without undocking. Redistribution of wealth from the risk averse. PIRAT would wet their knickers at the prospect and Jita would be a constant bloodbath, might actually force players to distribute trade to multiple hubs and not sit 0.1 isking all day until they got ‘nos’d
---
Capital oof

post proof or fuck off

It's rare I'd even bother to acknowledge this pained posting but this, and your post history, really comes across as a cry for help.

I won't defend EvE, it has major problems but I think it's important that you go and talk to someone in real life.
---
This might be a good step before getting some professional help.
---
If you wan't to PM me, I'll listen.
---
and they've been permabanned.
---
NPSI... More like NC. PL Special Interests. 
---
well it isn't okay
---
if mar5hy is input broadcasting, they should get warned if not previously warned, and banned if they had been, as outlined
---
goon krabs, as well as other krabs all around the galaxy, should also be hit with warnings and bans across the board
---
it's not really an either-or thing, it just comes off as less than genuine when it's from an organization who openly insists to not report its own bots
---
This would actually be pretty interesting if they had a seriously long spool time. 
---
\~20 minute spool time to get better yield than a Hulk would actually make a miner worry about losing their spool.
---
Would make for some interesting risk/reward mechanics.

I was absolutely being sarcastic in regards to the comments on the two different threads about the guy.

 ‘Any time from 1600-2300 you get messages about underpaid workers on strike’ - stealth cry for help from CCP devs. Maybe Hilmar is holding them hostage and it’s a code for ‘cannot leave office until we hit 450 million skin sales. plz send help.’

Yeah, except this particular dude is known to run about a hundred characters simultaneously. If you think he's not regularly broadcasting and bottling I want some of what you're smoking.

Yeah thats what I thought. Literally no person has ever claimed to have been banned for reporting, and thats not what Mittens actually said.

So you're just making that claim based on nothing but that ping? Got it.

ASIC are integrated circuits that can do only one job (unlike a generic CPU) but very fast with low power usage. It's widely used for mining crypto currency, wich is likely what the guy was talking about.

The ping for your alliance leader, the screaming comms. Dude, you wont change your mind even if Mittani himself comes here and screams at you, so what claim you want? It’s a fact. Accept it or dont, I dont care.

You think that's bad I had a cousin who was into quilting, yeah that's right quilting, couple years back she mixed with the wrong people now she's into dark quilting.

RMT and piracy are actually vastly different. Publishers believe that a pirated game is a missed sale, to which people respond that pirates wouldn't buy the game anyway. RMT on the other hand completely sabotages CCP's form of micro transaction by offering in game currency at a lower price, and thus actively losing money. What's the argument for RMT? Genuinely curious to hear it.
---
It is still a very widespread practice.

https://imgur.com/a/BRzu08Q   One says acts like a normal warp disruptor, the other says acts like a warp scrambler. But https://imgur.com/a/PwcdzKw can be a bit confusing as it does say warp scramble range, not disruptor. Just have to read.
---
wait until they put up a decent L4 with SoE first. Depending on the isk/lp I’ll think about it as long as it’s blitzable.

It's actually absurd people still bring this up. Why you trying to virtue signal with this in a thread about a dude input broadcasting.

I never cared about input broadcasting

well to be fair you used about the same amount of titans as the other video.

And yet literally 0 people have ever been kicked or blacklisted from GSF under this supposed policy. Also a fact. Its funny how you're not disputing that point. 
---
You find me one person who can show me (with comm logs, screens etc. don't just make a reddit throwaway), that they were kicked and blacklisted from GSF for admitting to reporting someone and I'll pay you 10B and reddit gold. I know you'll just say "oh you'll never deliver so I won't go to the effort" but this is a legit bet I'm making here. If you're not full of shit, this would be 10B for 5 minutes effort.

Yeah you can haul the blue loot there and pick up ammo or whatever at the same time. Better than risking it near jita.

“And yet” crap expected. Thats not a fact, that’s that you know of, ofc.
---
And even if you knew, you’d stfu because thats what Mittani ordered you all.
---
Goons that tried were threatened to not take any action whatsoever. If anyone goes public, ofc they will get kicked of the alliance, yet you want them to go public to prove my/your point? TBH, I know people in the spanish goon community that reports them anyway, I’m sure its the same in all goon corps. As long as they dont go public in alliance comms, they should be safe.

That's easily doable without broadcasting

Bellicose: Increase fire rate bonus to 7.5%, or else give it a 5th high, 5th launcher, and enough fitting to fill it. All 4 t1 ewar cruisers have one less slot than their regular brethren. For three of them it makes sense. The celestis and blackbird are not hybrid ewar-combat cruisers, so it could make sense that they're low on highslots and damage. The arbitrator *is* a hybrid ewar-damage cruiser, but it's a droneboat and those always have one less slot and it has all of the dps (drone bay/bw/bonus) you'd expect for an amarr drone combat cruiser, just missing whatever the second bonus would have been. The bellicose, however, does *not* have the dps you'd expect from a normal minmatar missile cruiser, having only 4 launchers where a normal missile cruiser would have 5 - not only is it missing whatever the second bonus would have been, it's just missing a launcher.
---
Corax: Swap explosion velocity bonus for a 5%/lvl fire rate bonus, and increase PG from 48 to 53. The corax is just a mess. Its slot layout says brawler, and using rockets makes its absurdly tight fitting easier, but the application bonus says 'use light missiles' because rockets already apply perfectly 99% of the time. Swapping the bonus makes it much less conflicted, giving a clear distinction between the more slippery, mitigation and kite-oriented talwar and the in-your-face-dps brawl-oriented corax, and adding 5 PG means it no longer needs a current router merely to fit rockets and a MSE.
---
Sunesis: Just give it 25 mbit of bandwidth to match the Gnosis' 50 mbit - it has terrible dps for a destroyer.

By market value it's just below Amarr, although if you were to take contracts into consideration (where all supers and titans, as well as many capitals and doctrine subcapitals are sold) then 1DQ would easily surpass Amarr.

they also use round robin which is banned. The only allowed way to scoop the drones is to give each window focus one at a time and issue the scoop command when it has focus. This cannot be done on a dozen clients in a second, to do this they either broadcast the scoop command or round robin it, both of which are against the rules.
---
I live in a c5 though 
---
The Mittani is like CCP.  He'll ban them, but only when it becomes a PR problem. 
---
Everything. No really. Everything. I won't make a trip to high-sec unless I know I can basically buy any in game item there. Sorry mate replacing Jita isn't an easy thing
---
I didn't even consider contracts.  Good point.  I usually just judge them by the number of sell orders. 
---
wow....flair baited &gt;_&lt;

you'd be surprised.   specially with the recent attention on social media after shootings where people notice posts that are considered warnings

I’m not trying to replace jita. I’m trying to have the essentials that people forget when they come back from jita.

I do think that all the specialty t1 haulers that belong to gallente need deleted and ORE equivalents released.

I mean theres already the Primae... just needs a tweak to not be worthless.

Release other noctis variants for minerals and ore .

Why would Gallente have the ships that ORE literally exists to produce?

Proximity Warp drive calculator

\- Allows you to warp to any object on grid that's at 200km and above, even hostile and manned ships. Accurately predicts where the target will be upon landing and adjusts the warp angle towards the estimated position of the target object at the time of arrival. 
---
Even just minerals would probably screw over many legit players. 
---
Well at least you were paying attention. Now come pew at once!
---
Yeah thats true, I guess once the assets have changed hands its pretty hard to work backwards from that.
---
Number of sell orders is misleading too, as in more general hubs you're likely to have more sell orders to cover a wider range of items, whereas in an Alliance staging such as 1DQ you'll see a much more focused set of sell orders covering doctrine items and ratting/mining items. You're a lot better looking at the amount sold in isk.

The videos I linked were almost all solo or small groups, and the first video linked the guy's known for super blinged solo/duo blops.

---
People aren't gonna buy a hull or an interdiction probe launcher or shit like that, as they'll either buy it as a complete fit from contracts or go to highsec for the complete ship themselves. 
---
Protecting the plattform form trolls etc. might be considered legitimate use of data - to what extend is not clear, though. But IANAL, so I might be off here.
---
That's true for many, and the solution for those folks is a corp with no structures or the NPC corp.

But for those who may want to try fighting back, there should be a meaningful way for them to do that with a reward and a possible chance to win.

So [this](https://zkillboard.com/kill/72226363/) Claymore has about 77K less EHP then an ADC Muninn, and is about 150 M/S slower. The speed probably isn't an issue, but I'm not sure that you want your links ships that much squishier then your DPS.  Part of the issue is that ADC HACs are tanky AF, but I think you need to be at least close in tank, or your links just get headshot right away.
---
Whatever.
---
Swapping the cap battery for another LSE gets you closer, but still about 45K EHP short of the Muninn, with the larger sig.
---
I'm sure you have a better fit somewhere.
---
The [Loki](https://zkillboard.com/kill/74353516/) fit we use has quite a bit more tank then that Claymore, but still quite a bit less than the DPS ships, and is quite a bit slower with a much larger sig.  I'm sure we could bling it out a bit more to make up for the EHP, but that still does nothing for the sig and the fact it takes a lot of implants/drugs to keep up.
---
So feel free to post your CS fits that have enough EHP and still keep up with HACs, because I don't see it.

You really think that if that was happening someone wouldn't have posted on reddit for the shower of salt it would generate? 
---
You really think its productive for alliance leadership to do that? I'll give you that they don't give a fuck about botters, but I can't see them wanting to spend effort to deal with the fallout of kicking people for reporting. 
---
But you know, don't let logic get in the way of your paranoid fantasies. 
---
Are you actually basing links ehp off the HAC while the ADC is active??
---
Many battleships can’t even achieve that.
---
Overclocker and quafe easily get you up to speed with muninns.

Yah i know, eve's changed a large but, and pretty sure blops guy is taking an extended break, but I love the hunting videos.

CCP started to save on developer time in the middle of Aeon design phase. 
---
At least you're honest with the "buffs things I use"
---
instead of "these ships are too weak."
---
Whatever you say, mate. It never happened and Mittani never threatened anyone if they reported blue bots.
---
Sure.
---
Let's not mention how the warp-in bug and the dscan bug that were introduced with Permafrost still have not been fixed.
---
Or the sensor overlay bug which has been around a bit longer.

An item that you can buy (with plex) or get from events as a reward, that has no in game effects. Apart of changing the colour of your ship.

Exactly my thoughts

At least they have a hairline

Is there something I haven't heard other than that one fireside?

Sorry there isn't. People have gotten it to run on wine though. I think that's a mac option?
---
When the Rorqual’s industrial core module is active, mining drones get a 500% boost. This makes them mine far more than even a bling Mackinaw. They are a mining ship. In fact most don’t even bring mining boosts, they bring shield boosts instead just in case they get dropped on. 
---
It should be like this but no
---
There is a way round that. I will share it with you but you need to send me a billion isk as a sign of faith. If aren’t satisfied my method will work i’ll Double your isk and return it.
---
Using vi? I see you are a man of culture, like me.
---
That was super cool to see, thanks for posting!
---
Yeah, really sorry about you guys just sitting on that hole forever, we really appreciate y'all waiting. we were 4 jumps up the chain, and armor doesn't warp that fast &gt;.&lt;
---
I was the Proteus pilot, I honestly thought the drake was a random that we were just gonna blap, and yes, I'm hot garbage at combat scanning lol. Once I got it scanned I warped at 0, and saw it was Rio as I was coming in. Knew that was bait, and knew your fleet was 1 jump away whereas ours was 4 jumps up and still forming so I didn't want to get blapped, hence the warp off.
---
then on the polarization on the hole, i was going to reship, eralized I was already in a heavy armor proteus, so came back in to FC in the prot. It's not nulli fit, you guys came 3500m from me and almost got it. it's a bil, plus a slave pod, woulda been bad :O Thankfully I was able to squirm out of that one lol.
---
Great fight, thanks a million for that and for the vid, was super fun to see! Hope to see you guys again. And for the record, We're always happy to brawl armor v armor, we generally just bring the pseudo kitey bullshit out if some else is kiting lol, we try to match when we can (ish)
---
Thanks again!
---
&gt; Are you actually basing links ehp off the HAC while the ADC is active??
---
I mean, that's the EHP, right?  You pretty much have to use that values because it's accurate.
---
You probably won't get there (although the Loki gets close-ish, with the speed and sig issues), but being basically half isn't close enough.
---
Your leader forbids reporting blues for cheating. You have no foundation for debate as long as you’re in goons or they keep the same leader.
---
[Let's take a look at that replay Tony](https://youtu.be/uWCz3BBfmPE)
---
That EHP only last for like 12seconds, intended to give the cruiser a battleship tank for a short burst.
---
That’s not how you balance the rest of the ships in a HAC doctrine. A muninn has like 40k ehp, that can burst high resistances once every 2 minutes.
---
Tank on a loki or claymore is much higher the other 108seconds per 2 minutes.
---
How the hell do I do that in multiple systems without using input broadcasting to have even a chance of catching if he does cloak all at the same time or not?
---
When you get flustered, you tend to react emotionally, rather than logically. It happens to all of us.
---
Both
---
A supporting rorqual could provide immense amount of boost to other laser mining ships
---
Meanwhile if a rorqual pilot is willing to invest in 5b isk and related skills for using a full set of excavators, one rorqual could out-mine two hulks w/h boost
---
Frozen corpse reprocessing.
---
Materials to build implants can be extracted from corpses that had implants plugged in when lost.  There would be diminishing returns, skills to increase said returns on extraction, and higher extraction numbers for higher grade implants.
---
This is a good turn of phrase, and if I use it without giving you credit later, I apologize.
---
Oh right I wasn't aware of the bonus to mining drones, so basically they're like hulks on steroids.
---
Is it possible to plex an account with 1 hulk mining in 0.0 for a few hours a day without the boosts from a Rorqual? I like mining on my alt but high sec sucks, would kinda like mining in nullsec if I join a corp based there.
---
One of the guys in my corp just uses the Logitech G keys and zero automation. He only has eight rorqs though.
---
I really hope CCP gets their money back for non-performance...
---
No, that wasn't my point at all. I wondered if people played on other characters whilst the War Dec was on.

You clearly don't understand how EHP works.
---
He said that someone who mass reported multiboxers (not botters) was a goonfucker and said  "you shouldn't be reporting goons, don't do it because you could be wrong"
---
Thats a pretty far cry from "anyone found to have reported any botter will be blacklisted".

You still can't attack suspects with a structure though

---
That and most pirate argument has always been a huge pile of shit like th "if the game was good, I'd pay for it" one. If you put any value in those argument, then RMT get the same BS ones like "I would not buy it if it was only available at CCP's price".

Oh euphemism. Now I have to learn to get actual work done in eclipse or notepad++.

Imagine getting mad and spinning a narrative because a npsi FC wants to fight and feed to you
---
Lol ok. 
---
He literally said "do not report goons for botting." The justification for it was an _extreme_ example of someone reporting people for multiboxing, but he used that example to justify not reporting any good at all for botting because "you don't know who is botting and who is good and who is bad." If only there was some sort of company who could look at some logs and determine if someone was botting, instead of telling your members to not report even obvious botters because...uh...reasons.
---
Mittani didn't say that.
---
And if he did, he didn't mean it like that. &lt;---you are here
---
And if he did, it's not that big of a deal.
---
And if it is, it's your fault for being upset about it
---
I bite my thumb at you, sir.

If you send me this 2 billion isk first in a gesture of faith i will tipple it as a gesture of good will!

I know the feeling and heck I live in Spokane so thats further east than seattle
---
youd be better off with a vni if you're only doing one character
---
But where was there a threat to ban anyone?  Has it ever happened? Or it all of this still just about the single statement not to report anyone?
---
fuck
---
If it makes you feel any better, in reality I use a VIM plugin in whatever jetbrains IDE I'm working in at the particular moment.
---
It ain't forbidden buddy, people just spun the shit out of that soundclip until the legend became he was actually endorsing botting. I can report whoever the fuck I want and nobody is threatening to kick me
---
Cheers for the double gold and the feedback, it was a low effort fun project and i did not expect so much response :p
---
Do it. Join a big block with a capital umbrella.
---
Like everybody says though if you're not multiboxing you'd make more money ratting. If you enjoy how laid back mining is (like me) then joining a null-bloc and becoming part of their industry arm is really really cool.
---
IMO it's not a viable playstyle any more.
---
stick drone on 1m m^(3) rock, come back every like 30 minutes to compress ore, don't get hotdropped
---
IIRC, we're still waiting for the video we were promised for that one. 
---
I'm doing 2, one of them will be ratting / pvp and the other will be mining.
---
I'm curious about this, when you're in one of those huge alliances or corps and you're mining etc. Are you expected to sell to the corp / alliance you're in and do they give you the same price as Jita or something? 
---
I hear in nullsec there aren't any trading hubs so I'm curious how people ship all that ore and industry related stuff around 0.0. 
---
They should do alot of things, but there is proof for this , right now so acting accordingly would be the thing to do

It's percentile and also trash considering the mechanics, increasing shield buffer is a better way to increase passive regen because you get both tank and regen. You add regen mods in very few niche scenarios and typically they are worth getting without a sizeable shield buffer.
---
didnt that guy that panic'd 50 rorqs in one input not get banned
---
why do you keep linking this link?
---
I tell you how we’ll do this then. You send me the 1 billion as a gesture of faith and i’ll send you the 2 billion as a gesture of goodwill. If you aren’t satisfied with the results of what I share with you then I’ll keep your 1 billion and you keep my 2 billion and the least you’ll walk away with is your billion doubled. I’m taking all the risk then because you could scam me and take my 2 billion AND my secret to doubling isk, and I’ll end up with nothing. But I’m a legitimate isk doubler so I’m prepared to take that risk as you are my new space friend. But we need to wrap things up here because there is a guy in another channel who is willing to do 4 billion right now.

It is forbidden to use input broadcasting to interact with other players.
---
Using the Chat means you interact with other players.
---
I mean, you’re in test so I guess when the 200feroxes are shooting a hac you have to account for that EHP. 
---
When your entire fleet is only 20-40 dudes, you fight based on 40k ehp, because a good FC and pilots will exploit this.

Yeah dude! Do you like, have any evidence of someone being kicked for not following the Grand High Fuckboy's instructions?
---
Just because he told us not to report blues for EULA violations doesn't mean he actually meant it.

No proof will satisfy either TAPI or Gon membership, because the members of those organizations are so braindead that not even this could cause any sort of rupture. EVE players are sheep.

Sometimes you get a corp buy back at 90% or so jita.  It depends tho what Corp. You aren't expected to sell to your Corp but you help them in doing so...so if you want to not contribute to your corp then go ahead. 
---
Grath must have bought his Rev from the same person
---
Ha. Prepare to have your mind fucking blown when you come to null.
---
Player owned structures typically have way better processing rates than NPC. So we mine, refine, and build all in null. Goonswarm has the second best market in the game and honestly is pretty dang close to Jita prices on most stuff.
---
Buybacks tend to be between 90% and 98% of the price you'd get in the nearest trade hub.
---
You're typically not expected to use buybacks, they're a service that corps offer so that logistics teams and krab teams can work together more easily and both make money. I like supporting my corp though so what I don't use for my own industry I put into the corp buyback. It's massively convenient.

If your refining skills are shit you can typically find a corpmate with perfect skills who will refine your ore for you for like 1% of the value (or if you sweet talk them and laugh at all their jokes on comms they'll do it for free). Refined minerals are pretty small volume so it becomes a lot easier to haul them, however big alliances will have hauling services to move stuff for you for next to nothing due to the economics of scale.

Eve is a game that becomes way more enjoyable when people work together IMO. The industry park I live in is pretty epic and I can build almost anything with perfect bonuses right in my home system.

I shit talk anyone who mines in high-sec and go gank them when I'm bored. There is no reason for a player with any skill to be there other than to shit on people without skills

I don’t think we can be friends now, my friends never question my integrity. I think 1 billion isk is a small price to pay to show you are a man of integrity and not trying to cheat me out of my isk and knowledge. I was prepared to do 2 billion as an act of good faith if you did 1 but you are clearly one of those scammers everyone is talking about. After this deal I was going to lend you my officer fit Caldari Navy Raven space vessel so we could do Level 4 missions together, but now I think you are just taking advantage of my generous nature and care more about losing your silly billion isk than the value of best ship friendship. It is a shame because we could have been space rich together, but I guess I’ll have to go with the 4bn guy now. He seems a nice guy and trusting so I’m going to give him access to my Corp wallet and hanger so we can get rich together and build Titans with the BPO I bought from my isk doubling secrets. Too bad for you that you’ll miss out on a Titan because you don’t Have faith to put up 1 billion...

The wormhole might be there. It might not.
---
Wormholes live for a set length of time or until its had too much mass through it. It might run out of time or someone might choose to close it. Or it might last 47 hours. Who knows 
---
Oh then you should talk to me earlier, we can endure into this titan building business - you see i have limited access to The Sansha Nation construction facilities, while they are 4th grade, and quite obsolete now - they still allow over 30% materials savings during the build.           
---
Please move your BPO to the 37s area so we can tripple our profits.  
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Wormholes 
---
This is a very useful article about wormholes. Your problem is that the wormhole you used to enter the wormhole space has either collapsed due to end of life (EOL) or has been collapsed due to overmassing.
---
So you need to scan your way out now. Different wormholes have different critical masses. But I think they all have the same EOL. I cant remember, its bee. a few years since I've played. Good luck!
---
And if he did, he didn't mean it like that. 
---
And if he did, it's not that big of a deal. &lt;---you are here
---
Nitro Oxide
---
If you BM the exit, it will be in that same location... assuming it hasn't collapsed yet.
---
Wormhole openings are limited by the amount of mass that can pass through (gets eaten up by every ship, bigger ships eat more) and by how long it can remain in place (usually a matter of hours, not days). So if you pass through one that is on the verge of collapsing, then it probably won't be there by tomorrow.
---
That's why WH exploring means bringing Core probes so you can find another way out if needed.

This is great but I have to take my sister Sala to a job now. She is a lingerie model. You will be able to meet her when we make our new Titan building corp business together. Once you’ve sent the 1 billion I will give you the corp roles and you can take the bpo and anything else you need. You need to send it now, I don’t want her having the wrong impression of you being a cheapskate. This is a great opportunity for us, but this guy wants a decision so if you can’t put up the 1 billion now I’m going with him. He’s offered Sala his Nyx, but I can talk her round if you act quick.

Honestly for ashimu and cruor too. I think improving both of them would be fixed if they slightly increased their neut/nos range. Loke make cruors to 15km and ashimus to like 28km or so. Think that would help both lots without being too op.

Sure thing boss.

I mean, sure, but then the game would be safer than it already is and there'd be nothing to do but grind for capitals... Might not be so different from what it is now.

Test and goons demonstrating again how the two largest entities aren't blue.

Almost as believable as Init saying they are goons.

Lol they had more than us

we horde, we always have more.  we like the mongolians, zerg, tyranids, and every other horde army =D
---
Nah. Intentionally seeding enemy staging with less than optimal contract fits. Its a thing.
---
Almost everyone has had times where they see ping buy a contract and jump off. Its next level stuff.

The Mongolians were usually outnumbered by whoever they were fighting

BB drops on shit in the north all the time. Are you surprised though after accumulating 48k people in a single region of the game that he comes to Delve so much?
---
You misunderstand; I'm not disputing any of that. 
---
All I'm saying is that goons and test will tell anyone who'll listen how they're not blue and link some small skirmish, but against any competition will blue up. 
---
aye, but their tactics used speed and ferocity to isolate and overwhelm.
---
even outnumbered, they could make it so the enemy felt outnumbered by being isolated into small groups.
---
I usually write Haiku's for ISK
---
Yes with how many different entities?
---
That's also irrelevant to my point; you'll say you aren't blue with goons, but against any real objective where you might lose you'll batphone them. 
---
Yes let's live in this fun reality where we pretend anything could change your mind. Your leader _literally fuckin said it_ and that wasn't enough, I also have to google for you.

SEVEN-OH FLY SAFE, YOU CAN'T SPELL GOONSWARM FEDERATION WITHOUT 'GOOD FITE', OR TEST ALLIANCE PLEASE IGNORE WITHOUT 'GIANT PETS' 
---
Lots.
---
and TEST have already mined back the losses while the north can't mine, so it's a double win.
---
The gyro mistake can happen to anyone, I'm facepalming harder at the sebo.
---
frenemies
---
Right, because when I call someone mongoloid, it means that I am obsessed with mongoloids
---
Yahhh maaahn
---
I approiluve of the French misspell of approve
---
Enjoy winning eve, scumbag.
---
yeah the goon form-up was a little disappointing, you should probably phone harder next time so you get an even funner good fite brawl 
---
Combat Tractor Beam - Pulls ships towards you
---
What. Marauders are fine mostly (too expensive but that's a different topic), cruor is okay, worm is god tier still. 
---
They are additional mappable keys. what is your point? 
---
You can map each key to a different client and have different key binds settings for each account so the recall drones button can be placed across like eight different Gkeys. You can roll your face across all of the keys and recall your drones.
---
Explain to me where the automation is on that.
---
We have not one, not two, not three but FOUR incursion constellations in Solitude (2 high, 2 low).
---
Between 6 and 7.
---
They are still part of the same coalition though, so if they want to be bluetral for content, then good for them, but they never stopped claiming they were panfam. The equivalent on the legacy side would be TEST and BRAVE going bluetral for content, since they are alliances in the same coalition, not goons and test.
---
Not a lot, don't do it not much isk to be made.
---
Posting this bad should be illegal.
---
I feel like this could be pinned.. but it's too low of an effort really
---
Geologically speaking, not really.
---
yea but there not 100% all the time in the main land you can normally get to one by doing 10-15 jumps, and incursions usually show up in Solitude once every 3 moths or so
---
And an incursion running group comes maybe once every three high sec incursion (pls come visit us more often).
---
the .model of the imicus
---
What's your IGN so I can personalize it a bit? 
---
Kinda depends on how much you put in my friend.  I run a small market in a dead-end region.  I have around 5B isk invested at any given time, give or take.  I'm probably making about 1B per week.  Rough numbers.  
---
Meh.  100+ muninns is pretty satisfying.  We'll manage
---
&gt; Not having Logi V
---
That's why i left the South months ago i was in evictus. Im done with alliances i joined a small corp in aridia made friends there we work togheter no ego's no drama no People telling us what to do. We are free man.   Im happy. Best decision i made in Eve. Leave all the alliance power hungryness of nullsec behind and find a home 
---
"europe has like no crime"   lol, oh how wrong that is.
---
that is the type of propaganda that most dictators wish they could make their people believe. but even they aren't that clueless
---
Was a hell of a fight!
---
It depends, if you have a lot of money and a lot of characters to move shit it can be pretty good 
---
I actually kinda like the warp in bug. You just show up on grid like blep. Just gotta be on edge when it happens to you
---
He probably fits a whore gun on his scimi.
---
Coordinated Large Angle Ion Destabilizer \[COOLAID\]
---
Stops cloaks and Cynos from operating instantly on all ships within the Dscan-angle of the ship using it.
---
Meta 1: works up to 5% Dscan-Angle
---
Meta 2: works up to 15% Dscan-Angle
---
Meta 3: works up to 30% Dscan-Angle
---
Meta 4: works up to 30% Dscan-Angle with reduced fitting requirements( CPU/PG)
---
Meta 5: works up to 60% Dscan-Angle ( has some ridiculous skill-requirements )
---
If he won Eve wouldn't he go outside, harvest the grass and shoot the birds, stealth into the neighbors backyard and ambush them too?
---
If they did that, then they would no longer have an excuse for ignoring wormhole space. And then they would have to deal with spaghetti code.
---
I don't have the massive balls for that
---
Shit the bed, those numbers aren't bad. 
---
How many different types of items are you shifting, n is this just a straight buy orders at jita/another hub n ship to desto for sell orders. 
---
Having close to 2000 goons in alliance chat isn't the same as 2-4K active traders in jita
---
Minor correction, that guy wasn't in test
---
Don't worry PH recently took over the role of most hated alliance ever from Goons.
---
jack1974
---
Why did you post this
---
Cause goons think that 1-dq will pass jita 
---
❤️
---
Possible isk/hr isk/day from 2 max rorqs in delve?
---
Tomorrow ? the date of your link is 20/dec
---
&gt; Have 150 more people
---
&gt; Have complete capital and super-capital superiority
---
&gt; TEST &amp; Co brings nothing bigger than Hacs
---
&gt; Still complain about being blobbed
---
thank you for this post
---
This post gave me autism.
---
Thx
---
Best intel we got out of that brawl?
---
We get gudfights if we drop fortizars. moar of that! :D
---
But where is the "grr hord hat hord"?
---
Until your haters have a catch phrase I really can't believe that
---
A reset so that we can shoot each other, we see the same thing with goons and TEST right now, don't we? Horde, PL and NC. are all blue. The last time I checked Horde isn't blue with GOTG and I have heard that both PL and NC. also reset them, but I haven't heard anything since. 
---
In the old days the Rorqual was used for boosting only and was incapable of mining. Bringing one into an asteroid belt or anomaly was considered the height of foolishness. They sat behind POS shields, one per system, because fleet boosts worked system-wide at the time.
---
Then CCP, in their push to remove all things passive, decided to convert system-wide boosts into localized on-grid bursts, and the Rorqual was given 'Excavator' drones to mine with.
---
The players pointed out that a Rorqual in space with industrial core on would be a sitting duck. To encourage widespread adoption, CCP created the P.A.N.I.C. module which would make the Rorqual temporarily invulnerable to give the defender some time to call in reinforcements.
---
cross-regional = trillions
---
I bought some stuff in Jita today, took 4 minutes for the transaction to process and appear in my hanger.
---
Considering there’s about 20k less people logged in than when I use to play a number of years ago it’s crap that it’s so slow.
---
Hey, let them have their little cheerleader moment, if they feel they are "winning" maybe they will last longer this time before folding and running away to someone nowheresville corner of nullsec that takes forever to get to.
---
My answer would be that:
---
- it doesn't take into account the contracts nor the direct trades
---
- 30% of jita trades is going alts.
---
they would have to give me blue status in order to pass domain lol
---
I meant goon alts.*
---
About 3.50
---
&lt;3 thanks fam

Alright thanks

---
On a serious note, there was probably less bling when Titans and doomsdays were new.
---
maybe you should try to go to another county once. just to see how it goes. 
---
Watching pilots mining in their Rorquals would make for a very boring TV show. No thanks CCP.
---
I once made the mistake of maximizing the cargo hold on an Iteron Mk 5.
---
The Praxis has a 1200 m3 cargo hold plus 7 low slots to expand it, plus 7 mid slots for a strong shield tank, plus 6 turret hardpoints or 6 launcher hardpoints. You can expand the cargo hold to 6573 m3 using all the low slots, and 9996 m3 if you use all the rig slots too.
---
"  but against any real objective where you might lose you'll batphone them. " It sounds like you are describing the strong independent northern alliances just as much as test/goons. both sides phone the universe when the timers means something. 
---
Enjoy the time winning my dude.
---
:pepehug:
---
oh boi
---
Do you have an idea, when it will be finished? Can't wait for it
---
The first one says 'was told not to report bots to CCP but to innomniate'
---
The second one is a 2011 forum post that does say reporting is goonfucking, so I'll give you that. Maybe you could have posted that before the long self-righteous diatribe?
---
Soon\^TM
---
Yeah, you're right. That is also the point tho. Goons and TEST aren't blue, we just tempblue for fights against PanFam. We shoot each other in between.
---
Its just that PLNC posters are turbo salty about it and they seem to think that their reddit tears will achieve something other than give us even more motivation to keep going.
---
They just finished pretending not to be blue. Horde reset GOTG, PL/BL sided with horde NC tried to act like they were sitting on the fence, and fake rest horde for a few weeks before joining the evict GOTG train and then nothing happened and everyone just went home after not following up on a bunch of timers.
---
Hello police? I'd like to report a murder. 
---
aight dope, responding to your OP now with it!
---
    Here’s the rap for your beloved alliance
---
    It’s likely nobody’s going to be writing about you again. 
---
    Since all your friends’ve already left for NC.-istan. 
---
    It’s such a shame, you used to be soo elite 
---
    Hell camping small alliances, smug posting for newbies. 
---
    But don’t worry, by the end of this you’ll have a taste of your medicine 
---
    So bad that Elise’ll have to post on your behalf for your friends. 
---
    I’m not even remotely surprised someone of your pedigree got accepted into PL 
---
    You’re the type of dude who’d post pvp videos fragging out highsec buffoons. 
---
    Wait.. that’s actually you. 
---
    Shocker. 
---
    I imagine this is how your app went when you applied to them: 
---
    You’ve got 2 braincells, 5 alts, and a titan trainin’? 
---
    Shit man, come on in! 
---
    Then a bearded guy appears in your room similar looking to hagrid. 
---
    “Yer no wizard Jacky, yer a has-been” 
---
    That’s the other requirement they don’t tell you about. 
---
     You’d have to peak a decade earlier, but keep the big mouth. 
---
    That big dude was actually grath telkin
---
    Your eyes full of desire, your heart meltin’ 
---
    “Wow,” you think “what a pristine individual” 
---
    “The man is a legend, he holds no equal” 
---
    More like the midas for neckbeards. 
---
    Be careful, when he touches you, you gain a hundred pounds, disability checks, and wheelchair. 
---
    Probably why you’re so good AT theorycraftin’. 
---
    No creativity, just a bunch of monkeys keyboard mashin’ 
---
    But those days are over. You’re just a shell of yourself. Pathetic and inactive. 
---
    Died with barely a whimper but to be fair it’s for the better. 
---
    You were a cancer on the game. 
---
    Living up to your name of pandemic legion. 
---
    I hope next time you’re trying to smash, the girl has a nasty pandemic lesion. 
---
    Send your isk over to my friend Konnen Jung. 
---
    I doubt anyone else is going to try to make one… of these raps.  
---
I joined RFED recently and so far have been met with welcoming and helpful folks! 
---
Wasn't this basically last year's April fools?
---
do all of you guys just talk about space politics or do you actually play the game like a sane person? 
---
With that last paragraph, are you implying that being in goons takes any sort of skill? Lmao I've seen it all
---
Im getting sick of this, I used to be make 100kk an hour in 4-cum. I havr lost more VNIs to that fuckin loki than ever. we dont even get SRP for loosing shit in lagz. i just want them to kill us n fuck off. im taking braek fuu
---
2019 is going to be good memes i can feel it
---
So much NC salt in here, you guys not like pvp or something? 
---
I kinda hoped it would be station and ship based. Like when a corp is betrayed, there is some dude marching into hallways, diverting assets and hoping he isn't caught before he gets it all.
---
Or can be used in any sec space, and can forcibly repaint other player ships to a colour scheme of your choosing.
---
I appreciate it!  Enjoy your Sunday evening
---
It's not an instant deflection. Goons are not a third party in this as it's their space getting camped. But oh wait goons are infamous for input broadcasting as well? Honestly fucking insane level of irony. 
---
Probably in the same place as Walking in Stations, Proyect Nova, the fix to FW and engaging sov mechanics.
---
I mean are Goon f1 monkeys any different from Horde f1 monkeys?
---
There's skilled members in both groups but they make up the minority of both groups.
---
You're just a lemming who wants to rah rah rah his alliance and hate on the alliance that is currently threatening your existence purely for fun and spite.
---
My squad is deploying to Geminate soon, we'll see whether I have skill or not then
---
Oh I'm sorry, its only a "deathclone deployment"
---
You're not fooling anyone.
---
The reason folks don’t fight back isn’t because they don’t know how, it’s because they generally don’t see the point. There needs to be a point. 
---
Lol I remember walking in station being promised. Almost forget about it, what was that almost seven years ago? 
---
They would be actually awesome if you could kill a super isk positive with them.
---
Man, I hope that isn't contagious.
---
I never said that F1 monkeying in horde is difficult or takes skill. I just said that it doesn't take skill to be a part of goons. Which is still true.
---
Regardless, you cannot speak for my role in horde, you are merely guessing. You assume I do nothing but anchoring up and pressing F1, because that is what you do yourself. This is called seeing yourself in others. Read up on it.
---
On a finishing note, how are goons threatening the existence of horde??? Eve nullsec is so safe that even if you say your entire super fleet in geminate and killed all the structures, personal wealth would barely be affected. Case in point; goons after WWB.
---
Don't you mean?
---
&gt; I half sean some shirty males in my day but this rally take the snake
---
Solitude is great. Tho, i dont miss spending 12 mil for caracals.
---
I mean, if you can't see the point in fighting in a PvP game, you're probably not going to get it regardless.  You either want to fight or you want to be perfectly safe.  There's a reason people join Goons with the Cap umbrella. 
---
u/OfficerCat 
---
reeee
---
damn ur upset
---
Dude, I don't mess with Jita buy.  I buy from sell orders in Jita, pay someone to haul for me, and relist at 25-30% markup.  I probably list 150 items total across a couple characters.  Just basic stuff everyone needs.  Expanded cargoholds, IStabs, etc. 
---
I was already giggling before your post. Now my sides hurt. Please send medical ISK.
---
Whatever their reason for playing the game, there has to be a better mechanic than one that encourages people to quit for playing for days at a time. 
---
There is a video out there where 2 shadows killed a nyx with ts. 
---
&gt;His apms are just so high he wrote all that at once to let you all know  
---
&gt;Stop trying to witch hunt a CONTENT cReATOR and spend some time speed typing u frickin loosers
---
How the fuck do you know what I do in Goons? You're literally being a hypocrite right now by making blanket assumptions about an alliance of thousands but saying blanket assumptions don't work for your alliance.
---
This is so not worth my time it's not funny.
---
I guess we'll see whether Horde survives the coming storm
---
haha I subbed JUST so I could upboat this =)
---
[Brisc’s Anti-Mining Button]
---
This device, when activated kills every Rorqual in the game. 
---
This is no joke, I've actually considered botting this year.  The only thing holding me back is not wanting to download shady software onto my computer.  But at this point, that is the only thing stopping me from running a couple VNIs while I'm at work.  You really want to fix the game?  Make it worth PLAYING. 
---
Really fucking annoying in wormholes. 
---
You know you can edit a post right?
---
pls come back and make pl vids
---
Those are rookie numbers. You need to pump up those numbers. I make at least 12-14
---
ahh i remember this one
---
Isn't this somewhat outside of the scope of the problem? If the problem is "we're trying to encourage players to undock, instead of unsubbing under the oppression of wardecs", then problem solved, NPC corps or structureless corps: sure, there's downsides, but doesn't this address the problem by making a portion of the playerbase completely exempt from war?
---
For the players who want to fight back, and are willing to risk ships and assets to do so, surely the mechanics are in place, barring a few issues like neutral logi and station games, which is somewhat out of scope of wardecs.
---
For players who would otherwise not fight back, let them have their undeccable corps?
---
This feels like trying to give PvE-centric players, or new PvP players, a fighting chance against Marmite and friends - surely natural selection should prevail here?
---
I know you F1. I never said that you do more than that - because I don't know. Read what I said again. I never assumed anything.
---
You are reading things that are not there. You are putting words in my mouth.
---
And regarding the "coming storm" that is TEST replying to geminate and goons "third partying" according to your leadership, I am certain that horde will be fine.
---
support yer local artists
---
I one up you and give 25m mat
---
HAH!!! GOTEEEEM. Ha. Gotieem
---
Ok.
---
Yeah I agree. I do it to plex one account and that's about the right amount for me.
---
How do you know I F1?
---
I actually don't. I had a corp mate getting on my case last night because I suck at multiboxing because I never use the F1 hotkey.
---
It's something I really need to work on
---
So... You're wrong.
---
And your last paragraph is so unintelligible I'm starting to suspect you have a mental disability and I should try to be a lot nicer to you
---
Please stop replying
---
That's not what I meant, sorry. I meant that it should have 25mbit, matching the gnosis in the sense that it can field a full flight of size-appropriate (i.e. light) drones the same way the gnosis can field a full flight of size-appropriate (i.e. medium) drones, not that it should literally have 50mbit. I've edited the post to clarify my meaning.
---
Jokes on all of you, already been extracted he won't care if they get banned now.
---
I know you don't take the CSM seriously - that's clear from how you respond to people on reddit.  But for once, maybe listen.  When people who are into PvP and playing the game the right way are telling you that it's not fun, it's tempting to bot, and that your solutions to problems (like war decs) aren't working, maybe fucking listen and try to make some positive change instead of being a smug shit who licks GOP and Goon taint.  Just a thought.  
---
skosh o' lag there
---
gui got a touch soupy
---
the spacewater thickened up a bit
---
and maybe you should try visiting the US and seeing for yourself.
---
then return to europe and compare.
---
might benefit you to visit japan or canada as well to see the closest your gonna get to crime free.
---
With this shitshow of CCP chat, timestamps are meaningless anyway.  However, there's 0 reason for him to say that (esp with same typeos) on multiple characters. So trash, everyone already knew it from his synchronized bombing anyway but even CCP can't deny this one.
---
Nothing has been confirmed (or denied) by CCP. But it looks pretty sus when they can't roll back to a pretty good system despite the thing they 'upgraded' to being broken for a year. Expect miracle progress (i.e. changing service) in March.
---
It’s a benefit to both sides for these wars to be more than what they currently are. Right now, aggressors have a massive advantage, which is why the number of kills per war is so abysmally low. If we can do it, why not create a war dec system that provides incentives to both sides and gives defenders a chance to fight back in a meaningful way? The existing mechanic obviously isn’t doing that. 
---
Nobody is expecting to turn a group of miners into PvPers over night, or give them guys a way to stack up against veteran wardeccers, but there really doesn’t seem to be a good reason to continue with the essentially riskless system that the current war dec mechanic promotes 
---
i'm extremely distraught, yes
---
I have no idea who you are, but please feel free to bot so we can ban you. Thanks. 
---
Invasions happen when super fleets move.
---
Dude. Sub the account. Get one of the cheap deals. Galaxy pack gives you 3 months and about 8 bil isk. 6 month+ sub deals save you more. Earning isk just to spend it on sub time is a waste of time unless doing PI or you're earning billions an hour doing nullsec burners or WH dread ratting. 
---
i enjoy doing caldari FW in tama solo. yes, you die a lot, hahahah. good times tho.
---
As amateurish as this video is, alliances like RVB are still the best way to get your average ignorant, risc-aversing, highsec newbro into PVP.
---
This whole idea of getting 5-days-old characters straight into Pandemic Horde or Karmafleet is simply not how player progression works. If you enter a new game you simply want to get your feet wet first at the place you start.
---
Ah yes, that's much clearer than it was before - thanks!
---
We're working it from both ends, naturally. It's a work in progress.
---
/u/jibrish
---
I have my MWD on F1. The term "F1'ing" means to shoot the designated target though, come on.
---
Also, are you actually getting mad over me responding to all your arguments, so you resort to personal insults and plead me to stop replying? If I were you, I'd just delete all my comments and pretend this never happened instead of continuously embarrassing myself...
---
I got 50-100bil on marked i make aroundt 10 to 15 bil a week 
---
They said in the linked post that January 7 (tomorrow) would be the last day they would do redirects. You would have seen that if you read the title of the linked post.
---
Thanks, I would probably have forgotten about that having been away over Christmas/New Year.

It's amazing that shit politicians in RL will be shit politicians in a video game.  No real surprise.  Got some brown people you want to ban while you're at it?  
---
I'll expect the ban when your Rorq fleets get banned.  In the meantime, lick my ass.
---
225 m3/s is max yield. That's 810k m^(3)/hr.  
---
Assume you're mining Spodumain at 16m^(3)/unit; that's 500 compressed units/hr, worth about 300k ISK each = 150m ISK/hr raw.  
---
Then assume 20% efficiency loss due to drone travel time and de-sieging to reposition.  
---
Then assume you're selling at 80% of Jita buy because it's Delve.  
---
You're down to about 100m ISK/hr.  
---
Multiply by how many hours you'd mine in a day and by how many Rorquals you plan to use at once.
---
In an alliance staging? Consumables - ammo, drugs, drones. Most people won't try to buy a ship except in a hub, unless you put doctrine stuff on contracts.
---
Jesus what part of stop replying did you not understand. You have been insulting me since the beginning. There has been zero logic to your arguments. You literally started by saying it's impossible for me to have skill if I'm in Goonswarm.
---
I'm only pleading because it's such a waste of my time to argue with you and yet you keep putting out such idiotic responses I can't help but shit on you.
---
The only thing I'm embarrassed about is engaging such a pedantic and narcissistic person they would insult every member of an alliance and think they're right.
---
Can't wait to burn Geminate. See ya there
