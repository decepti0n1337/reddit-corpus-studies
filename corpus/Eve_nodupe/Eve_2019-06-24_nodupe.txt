He's like the police chief, he enforces alliance rules. He's a super chill guy and easy to get along with, but if you're goonfucking or otherwise breaking any rules, he'll drop a pile of supers on your head and give you a good spanking.
---
Not true. Alphas can use a lot of t2 mods nowadays.
---
Okay. And?
---
The game isn't meant to be played entirely as an Alpha, Alpha Clone state is meant to be an extended tutorial/trial period. There's going to have to be some limitations on that state to encourage players to subscribe.
---
Hampering botting activity is more important than making sure people can play without subscribing.
---
r/eve any year :  "It's not my fault its yours"
---
it didnt look like it did any thing for me either until i was in big fleet fights and big tidi systems and no crashes or even splutters running it on highest graphics settings vs having to potato mode before.
---
I would not recommend going it SOLO.  A few months ago, my corp pushed out a solo Character and destroyed his Astrahus.  He begged me not to do it, but he needed to learn his lesson.  I still fly one of his ship that has his name on it through highsec, just to rub it in.
---
Get with a small Corp, or just do day trips.  If you really want to live it SOLO, Good luck.
---
PM me if you need some help.
---
1. There are already quite a lot of limitations to Alpha clones already.
---
2. This won't even stop botting...like at all. Won't even slightly hamper it. Every ship is capable of being botted, they will just adjust their programs for a different ship and keep botting. Most likely bot Domi's next.
---
bot domi's would be much more catchable though due to their slower align time
---
Can you reform that with parentheses
---
Alphas can use t2 guns familam
---
Auto aggression is fine.  What they need to do is put stasis towers in anoms or give the rats the same air sleepers use.  Or both for that matter.
---
There is a reason why other ammo types exist. Try using depleted uranium next time or at least plasma/emp.
---
You know what's worse than getting deleted by 12 votes?
---
Sort was tied for 6th in the first round. The guy he tied with and the 5 above were all elected in the first round. 
---
Sort led 2nd round voting with over 1900 votes. Steve was sitting back with over 900. 
---
So between round 2 and the elimination, Sort only picked up another 350 votes, while Steve picked up another 1400. 
---
That is an incredible jump and fall.
---
CCP said, when rolling out the extended set of skills for Alphas is, they wanted both Paid and Unpaid to be viable styles of play for EVE. Many players saw this game on Steam, Humble bundle etc. as Free to Play and never intended on becoming Omega. 
---
So to offer these skills then take it away from this set of players because of the actions of EULA breakers is entirely unfair.
---
So they're not exactly apps,  but two 3rd party programs I'd struggle to live without are Evemon and Pyfa.
---
Evemon let's you build skill plans and share them,  and shows you exactly what skills you'll need to train into the fit you want and even tells you if you need to buy any skill books.
---
Pyfa is a fitting tool that let's you minmax your fit to get maximum performance. It is just more reliable than the in game simulator.
---
Have you ever thought that VNIs can be clone by alphas
---
Alphas + Virtual Machines + T2 drones + bots = unlimited ticks per hour
---
In recent light of CCP changing the drone layout, it makes sense to limit the possibilities for botting =//= RMTing
---
Assuming they have clones stashed elsewhere, you can't rule out mass suicide as an escape mechanism.
---
You already have a job but you work for $0.2 /hr and you are only paid in a virtual currency.
---
Unless they've changed something in the last few months no they can't. I can't use my T2 hybrids on my Vindicator unless I'm Omega
---
no. with parentheses it's the same.
---
stacking more doesn't cause real issues besides lagging upon loading, I've placed a few hundred thousand unique items in a can to try.... no crashes just big lags.
---
Just close the launcher once you are done using it.
---
Sorry, alphas can use t2 small and medium weapon systems
---
very much agreed
---
Yes 20% or 30% but i never touched a fucking drone. Next time i will put more choice in ammo :)
---
They can use up to T2 medium weapons.
---
Ok i will ;)
---
lol
---
&gt;The game isn't meant to be played entirely as an Alpha
---
This isn't true. Even according to CCP who said they wanted both Paid and Unpaid to be viable styles of play for EVE.
---
There are limitations to Alphas: 20mil SP. But like I said in my other reply, many players joined EVE because it was free to play, 
---
Now if CCP said "Were making this change because we feel Alphas are too powerful" then that's another thing.
---
And I agree, botting is a problem and needs to be fixed but this solution is one that also harm's legitimate playstyles.
---
If you were using Hail, it has a tracking penalty. What speed you were flying and how close orbit is also important, and also your gunnery skills.
---
That being said, you didn't have a chance against a PVP fitted Procurer flying a t1 frig.
---
The client has nothing to do with it (though the UI lag is a bad secondary effect). It’s all down to database manipulation on the server. Likely they don’t want to unpack that can of worms for the 1/1 million transaction where someone exceeds 1k stacks.
---
That is a big deal.
---
Yes, FW plexes are awesome.
---
Rest of FW mechanics are completely fucked up.
---
&gt; Removing drone auto aggression would solve all the issues connected with AFK farming 
---
What are these issues you're talking about exactly ? To me your post looks more like a rant than something that could improve the game.
---
This is a solution that CCP has proposed and I'm here to say that I think they should choose a different one.
---
This solution is a total nerf to an entire set of players. Drones are used by everyone. 
---
While I agree in game nerfs to botting platforms may be necessary, for example the VNI changes nerfed it's ratting capability but buffed it's PVP abilities. This on the other hand is a complete nerf to all Alphas which unfortunately includes legitimate players.
---
Damn. I want one....
---
What you MINE is m³. The activity of mining provides you cubic meters per seconds. Those cubic meters are transformed into ore when you mine.
---
those cubic meters of ore are then tranformed into minerals, according to your refining skills.
---
Have you ever roamed nullsec or taken a glance of what is primarily used for haven farming? 
---
Also you never offered a different solution, and at this point, r/eve poster #42069, ccp doesn’t care what you think in terms of balance. Hell they don’t even care what the CSM has to say most of the time.
---
Thanks for your post, we’ll put in the pile of complaints to the right 👉
---
Should of switched to deleted uranium and popped  drop the second you missed 5 or so cycles
---
Good you alohas don't need T2 anything
---
Clone tech is decently well-established as being pretty expensive, though. It costs a capsuleer the equivalent of ~$10Bn (assuming 1ISK is ~$100k) and even vessels as large as Titans can only house a hundred or so (though that might be because Titan clone bays are an afterthought). In lore it's established that only the wealthiest dirtsiders can afford infomorph clones. So it's very likely most if not all of those billions are SOL if they're in the station when it blows up.
---
&gt; Teleporting across the map should be used in emergencies only.
---
You should encourage parties to connect, friendly and opposing. Lack of interaction will lead to a dead game. There's already numerous null sec systems with zero interaction, zero players. Creating more of a divide doesn't "break up" most of null sec. It is already broken up. 
---
The solution for whatever X Y Z problem you're looking for must connect players and must encourage better retention. That's the true north for any aged game.
---
Bombers bar is alright.
---
I thing i could if you track you can easily blap the 10 warrior before my tank drop. 
---
Will do it again with another ammo and 150 autocanon so better tracking.
---
Yeah hail is 20 or 30% malus. I didnt thought i wont track when we start the fight.
---
I've still got 4 boxes of the core game set and two boxes of the boosters. I sold several a few years ago on eBay and kept some for myself. I can't bring myself to open them.
---
VNIs are used for Havens and they're already planned for changes to reduce ratting viability.
---
And I can't offer a better solution. I'm not a game developer or designer. I'm not a master of EVE and I don't have all the answers.
---
But I do know that there isn't only one way to do something to make a change. And that's why I'm here to maybe see if that's possible for this.
---
so how would YOU suggest they combat afk ratting and botters?
---
Oke let's play this game ( this is bait but fuck it ) never not take bait. 
---
So right now if your working 40 hours a week on grinding isk, that nets you about 5 billion, if you where to work a job that same amount of time, it would net you about 37 billion ( assuming a 7 dollar an hour job and buying plex by intervals of 15 ). 
---
Now given because the time to play eve is your most important factor, here is how you get the money first of all work on your looks this means diet and exercise ( no seriously this is gonna be important later, so you can do this while playing eve, now once your in good physical shape and decent looking, you go around town scouting your audience, now if your male a lot of your clients will end up being gay so keep that audience in mind ).
---
You need to appeal to this audience and well given you worked on your body the best talent you now have for sales is sexual favors, now don't undercount yourself you want to at the very least be able to plex 1 toon for every dick you suck, but go crazy it should only take you 1/2 nights on the weekend to get all the plex you need this way, you then have time for pvp the rest of the month. 
---
Also on the remote chance, this is serious, get some help no seriously what your describing is addiction not having fun, then again prostitution has a long and proud history of paying for addicted people their habits.
---
Slim down Eve time.
---
Acquire employment.
---
Acquire real currency.
---
Purchase own breaded chicken strips.
---
GBP and ISK are only real currencies if they're pounds and krona.

the 64bit client was downloaded long before the option to activate it was even made availiable.

if its 32bit it shows "(32 bit)" behind the process name.

if it doesnt then its 64bit.
---
all of that assuming that your OS is actually 64bit
---
Awox roulette sounds awesome
---
Look at Mr Optimistic over here.
---
Yes. But it’s a lot less likely to work. With this method you just have the dictor sit cloaked on gate while the other two are off grid. If the hauler scouts it he’ll see nothing. 
---
If you do a drag bubble, only the laziest haulers will run into you, and those ones probably won’t be flying anything valuable.
---
For AFK ratters they've already planned to nerf the VNI but if we wanted to go further changes to drone aggression might be needed.
---
For Botters I'm not sure and I don't have the knowledge or resources of CCP but I think they can combat it better. Surely better client bot detection would help but it might take a lot of time so CCP has tried slapping this nerf on as a bandaid.
---
I've always said if CCP ever felt to expand regions and add more space that they should do it slowly with system wide ship restrictions. Gates that only allow t1 frigs for 3 months. Then t1 destroyers... Then t1 cruisers... You get the point.
---
I would stick with the 200s, I've blapped Proc drones with arty, so with faction ammo you should be good to go. 
---
And I don't doubt you can kill it's drones, I doubt you can break its tank in any kind of decent time.
---
10 out of 10 would keep glassing again
---
I'd like to see them meet the NJED heron /u/bluedagger
---
CCP nerf hammering stuff is why I quit the first time years ago. 
---
So now they're planning to do the same to the VNIs? 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Everytime that happens some of the client base get pissed and quit like I did. 
---
Others just find ways to do exactly or mostly what they did before. Like our friend here said:
---
 [traffic\_cone\_no54](https://www.reddit.com/user/traffic_cone_no54/)3 points·[10 hours ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c443if/will_we_see_more_verity_in_ratting/eruuwz6/)
---
so the change wouldn't really affect you much then, just change hull and keep doing what you're doing.
---
I'll never really understand why CCP deliberately pisses off segments of their customer base.
---
The people bitching about this, or bitching about something else or are bitching about whatever they bitch about
---
are never as likely to leave as people are likely to leave who get whatever their particular flavour or definition of fun 
---
either fucked with or even ruined.
---
The times they fucked with my personal fun, I pretty much created workarounds within 48 hours or so, but eventually
---
said fuck it and left, thereby costing CCP about 5 years times 12 times whatever cash plex (the original kind)  when for other that time.
---
It was about $20 US when I left, so you do the math if you want to. Sure I'm just one guy but I wasn't the only guy.
---
Anyway, driving off customers is NEVER smart because it literally costs more to get a new customer than it does to 
---
keep and old one. Always.
---
That's just basic business no matter what business you're in. This I know from direct business experience.
---
No I won't spout the usual "Eve is dying" crap because people have been saying that for years. Only time will tell.
---
I will say though deliberately pissing off segments of your client base does increase the odds of that happening, again,
---
no matter what business you're in.
---
6. NEVER not buy a mining permit, and stay compliant to the New Halaima Code of Conduct while in highsec*
---
Is this guy all right?
---
I've been wondering myself why people get so butthurt and as you say work for CCP for FREE! Either hunting botters or bitching about botters or whatever.
---
Yep.  It has been a lot of fun seeing my big toys in big fleets at full graphics....or any ship in a big fight.  Looks so much more...well...epic.
---
It won't. more nerf bullshit
---
i only see positives there tbqh
---
&gt; Log in rewards are mostly okay because they encourage players to *log in*. 
---
You don't even have to log in to the game to get log in rewards. Log in rewards are awarded when you log in to the account and it takes you to the character select screen. I can set all of my accounts to log in at once and go no further than the character select screen and I get the log in rewards.
---
&gt; This is the game telling players if you park your ass at the place where nothing happens day after day, your odds of getting a "this is EVE" level fight *in the future* goes up, which is flaming pants on head retarded. 
---
I wasn't aware there was a single place you had to park your ass to kill an NPC. If you want to camp a noobie system because that's the easiest place for you to do it, that's your choice. 
---
The argument about losing out or falling behind is also a flawed one. If you want to argue that then everyone who doesn't fly around with +5 implants in their head all of the time are losing out on SP they could be getting. I don't see how this is any different. It's a choice you can make. 
---
All of that aside, I don't think this is going to be structured like the dailies from the last time they tried it. I'm waiting to see what happens. I'm not going to shoot it down right off the bat though.
---
A relic from another era
---
FUCKING BOMBERS BEING SUCH COWARDS WHY WONT THEY BRAWL ME DOWN
---
Im sorry for your skills but I agree with these changes from ccp and applaud their efforts to actually fight bots rather than sit comfortably by

You do realize where you're posting right? 
---
This echo chamber is part of what's removing content from they game, but self awareness isn't something people that wear blue baseball caps have.

yes because surely the domi wont be pre aligned already once on site
---
Scam buy orders don't exist.
---
We should get better payout from D plexing.
---
Well if you can kill a hauler without any negative consequences (for yourself) why not shoot it? Why bother with a cargo scanner which takes away valuable fitting slots when the result of the cargo scan doesn't change the outcome (for you). 
---
Either they get loot or they go away having lost nothing.
---
Also, being a "pirate" and going around killing ships is a big part of the game for many people
---
Well to be fair, it’s just your ships vs structures

---
I have one of those somewhere, one of the EON issues came with a pack I believe.
---
CCP could have devoted time to creating better systems for bot detection, instead they decided to throw legitimate players under the bus.
---
I don't think this change should not be applauded, they took easy route.
---
Why not just dock up lol
---
Probably had something epic to say too like “I’ll buy for $200!”
---
Sadly I'm posting jn a thinly veiled effort to hopefully reach the eyes of a CCP employee because everyone knows they don't read their own forums.

---
Buy extractor and reinject into T2 gun?
---
Just got accepted !
---
I would love to see a video of that
---
Bot detection as you put it is not simple and almost impossible so taking measures that are realistic and slow it down/make it less viable are far better,  no game that suffers from botting can usually eliminate it entirely just make it not worthwhile to bot, take examples such as wow or runescape which were heavily botted at times and the solution was always to make the game less viable for the botters before they could tackle the long term project of the bots themselves
---
\&gt; The higher the total SP your character has, the less effective the skill injector becomes until it is almost entirely useless. 
---
Clearly a change they should implement immediately!
---
Oh wait. They already did.
---
Bot detection is absolutely not the problem when bots pay for themselves in days or even hours
---

Plex mechanics are old. And haven't really changed much during the years. Except they deleted ability to slide into plexes while ago. Wtf was that about? Who wanted that change?
---
Only problem with the plexes is that they favor frigs and dessies too much. You kinda have to start doing bigger ships than just frigs to get anywhere in this game. Frigs still have their place, but...

---
I've talked this over with a friend, and I've narrowed it down to only requiring 2 toons. Please let me know what is stupid about this plan.
---
\-Sabre on out side
---
\-hecate on in side, 5k off gate
---
\-both cloaked
---
\-once the transport jumps in from the hecate's side, the hecate decloaks and jumps the gate, while sabre lays bubbles
---
\-both burn to the transport to try to decloak it once it moves (i'm familiar with this process)
---
\-hecate DPS and the sabre's should be plenty to take them down. the hecate's dual web (and possibly a sabre web) should hopefully prevent them from afterburning back to gate.
---
There are potential holes in the plan, though:
---
\-not enough webs to stop them from afterburning to gate
---
\-destroyers aren't fast enough to decloak the ship: both go about 2.6k a second, so I think it'll be fine
---
\-the transport can MWD away from the spot they cloaked faster than we can get there
---
\-they warp/MJD ASAP after jumping the gate, potentially dodging the bubbles, or avoid being scrammed (because of sensor re-calibration from the cloak)
---
That should work, depending on how tanky the transport is. The only way i see it failing is an overprop + max tank fit just managing to AB back to the gate despite your webs, which is why i suggest a daredevil.
---
New players meaning actual new players, not the new account you spun up, transferred 5 bil to, planned out your skill tree and book purchases, dropped implants in, and then left alone for 2 weeks. 
---
Actual new players are not dropping the SP or the money to get into a ratting battleship, damn sure not a smartbombing mach or a domi with good heavy or sentry skills. Actual new players are probably fucking around with mining or exploration for a couple hours a week, affording a vexor, buying said vexor, and maybe upgrading to a vni if they are feeling ballsy with the 150M that took them weeks to get.
---
Vnis nerfed - out of date info here
---
So the 64bit works for shitty internet better than the 32bit pretty much
---
the only thing missing from plexes is a BC sized plex; BC combat is really fun
---
Large are awesome at providing large fight arenas that favor good positional plays and prevent cap escalations (yes you can warp them in but no cyno, and warp in based on warp in beacon distance.)
---
Medium allow cruisers to dodge t3 cruiser fleets and BC/BS escalations.
---
New players decide if the game is right for them very quickly, then either leave or subscribe rather than playing as an Alpha long term. Of course, more Omegas is fantastic but [we think many of the players who leave might be willing to stay around if subscription didn’t feel like a requirement.](https://www.eveonline.com/article/clone-states-the-next-steps)
---
Isn't the actual reason that they are shit scared to fuck with hangers because the code may result in iems and hangers getting totally nuked?
---
Thank you very much 🙏🏼
---
Lmao my apologies
---
If its not too difficult, why is your hunting dependent on a cyno?
---
&gt;My point is ismply that the cynos timer hurts hunters more than it hurts the defense.
---
The umbrella is dependent on instant cynos. This is the main defense for rorqs and ratting caps. If there is a delay, it is weakened. This gives you a chance to kill something you might otherwise never have the numbers for. It also gives tactical value to have large ships locally accessible.
---
What is the actual similar effort counter to instantly appearing ships in overwhelming numbers that isnt a cyno? Cynos cause n+1 and lack of fights.
---
You realize this is just a game right.
---
Thank you for replying so much! I will try testing this out tommorow.
---
Your game unfun. Not theirs. XD.
---
Why you should fight back? It's called self respect.
---
they’re not deliberately pissing off sections of their player base you fuckin imbecile, they’re trying to balance the game and reduce the amount of botting that occurs
---
NC, my hero
---
I used to be a new person like you
---
Then i took PVP to the knee  
---
In all seriousness losing ships is probably the coolest looking thing in eve, second only to a station going kaplooey.  
---
Keep flying and have fun!
---
See that little green box at the top that says "ON"?
---
Yeah, click that.
---
you do realize why its so hard to identify a bot vs a player?
---
specially in a UI window based game like EVE.
---
bot detection programs rely on looking at input commands,  which are nearly perfectly identical to any player ratting.   specially when they afk rat in a VNI  (its easier to find them when they using an active turret ship)
---
by forcing people away from afking ratting ships bit by bit.  and into active turret/command ships.  not only does it make it harder for programmers to make bot programs that can calculate what to shoot first based on position.     but it also makes it easier to see what players go through the exact same targetting routing with routine click per minute.  aka a big indicator of a bot.
---
Y'all are elite
---
hunting with only 1 pilot flying through the systems reduces the alert dramatically.
---
and rorqs hardly need instant cynos. First off, a defensive fleet would have to be always perfectly ready, and rorqs have the panic module that will keep them alive a while.
---
So, like I said, it hurts hunters more than it hurts the cap umbrella.
---
Basically any kind of solo dropping would be entirely dead as well.
---
All, to make the cap umbrella 1% less effective.
---
&gt;Arguable, as the game is in a pretty bad rut due to CCP's incompetence. Some large groups have unitedly quit the game altogether due to CCP's before a mentioned incompetence, but as a new player you might enjoy it?
---
Yeah, but what are they quitting and going to? Like it seems like Eve is unique enough of a game to where they won't find something "better". I just find it odd people would be willing to leave, not that it matters much. 
---
Less people to gank me, right? (silver lining)
---
&gt;If I started eve right now, with my knowledge, with nothing, it wouldn't effect me too much. This isn't because I hardly play any more, but my personal knowledge of the game can carry me to my current level in a month.
---
So essentially, if I learn the ins and outs, the right places to go, the right things to sell, etc. It's just a matter of learning those things, before most players get burnt out, right?

---
How are Alphas meant to even begin to get involved in PVP when all the recommended fits are T2? They can't, really. And considering that EVE is largely centered around player conflict, going ham on T2 gear would just fuck the game. I'm talking about all the loons in here, dicking on Alphas.
---
Got more windows open than a Mcmansion.
---
Any idea how long the pull was?
---
You can extract as an alpha: Only skills that require omega. So if they make T2 mediums a omega skill you can extract the SP above the line.
---
I use filters. I buy everything in bulk from jita and have it shipped to staging and use the multifit option for building everything.

OLMECA GOLD DRAIN THE SWAMP

Plenty of newbro groups that can take you in and help you. I'm biased, so I am going to recommend Pandemic Horde.
---
There is also Brave Newbies, KarmaFleet, Brand Newbros, EVE University.
---
thanks alot!!!
---
Looking in task manager after closing eve and the launcher ( set to close on close) shows that it's still running.  I have to go kill the task before doing playing other games.
---
Somewhere with his taco hat collection
---
Gila
---
cry some more pls
---
I ran a fleet of alphas and partial omegas in a fleet yesterday even with t1 weapons those alphas whooped some ass with us for solo alphas wouldnt be as good tbh
---
I didn't know that, thanks for the correct info.
---
you could have spent the 5 minutes to learn how to do motion tracking...
---
Id strongly suggest you read up on the corps prior to blindly joining / eve uni is a high sec all rounder, 
---
 karmafleet = goonswarm it takes longest to get in,  it has probably largest network of support in terms of ship replacement /mentor and training programs running most days   
---
Pandemic horde = part of panfam, they are on the recieving end of a losing war, less support than goonswarm and occasional training 
---
Brave newbies I know little about but they are small gang type stuff smaller more friend based than the other 3
---
&gt;hunting with only 1 pilot flying through the systems reduces the alert dramatically.
---
If they are monitoring the systems, why shouldnt they see you? You want every ship to be completely deceptive in terms of the actual fighting strength it brings. All this does is reducing the number of fights taken.
---
&gt;and rorqs hardly need instant cynos. First off, a defensive fleet would have to be always perfectly ready, and rorqs have the panic module that will keep them alive a while.
---
But they have cynos for that purpose, and a defensive fleet does not have to be "perfectly" ready. The panic module is broken and should probably be deleted.
---
&gt;So, like I said, it hurts hunters more than it hurts the cap umbrella.
---
You say that, but the arguments compared to essentially dismantling the umbrella, getting rid of bait drops, instant safety, n+1 to some extent, and the concept that the largest ships in the game are effectively the fastest, are weak if they even exist.
---
&gt;Basically any kind of solo dropping would be entirely dead as well.
---
Good, it is incredibly abused. The accuracy if seeing what is in a system is basically non-existent because of cynos. If I see you have one ship, that single ship should not instantly become 50 carriers.
---
&gt;All, to make the cap umbrella 1% less effective.
---
Far more than that. A delay would have beneficial side effects in that it would probably cut down on cap mining and ratting since there is no instant protection. To somewhat encourage this, blops could have a delay reduction bonus.
---
o7 If you ever want to get back into EVE to see all it has to offer let me know, I'd love to get you to where you want to be.
---
o7 my bad, carry on.
---
The stations should be charging rent.
---
After all the hate I’ve received for my post, I really appreciate your comment and hope for the same thing!
---
Can't they just put a fucking letter on the icon or allow that feature in colorblind mode? Even with colorblind mode I still can't for the life of me distinguish those damn icons. Put a G for Gallente, A for Amarr... something.
---
&gt; You say that, but the arguments compared to essentially dismantling the umbrella, getting rid of bait drops, instant safety, n+1 to some extent, and the concept that the largest ships in the game are effectively the fastest, are weak if they even exist.
---
It only gets rid of bait drops. It does absolutely nothing for any of those other things.
---
&gt; Far more than that. A delay would have beneficial side effects in that it would probably cut down on cap mining and ratting since there is no instant protection. To somewhat encourage this, blops could have a delay reduction bonus.
---
Hardly, most of those don't die in 5 minutes anyway, except when getting hot dropped.
---
no clue.. its not my moon lol probably pretty long tho
---
the golden secret though is not to make it your job. Don't pay for PLEX with ISK unless you have massive surplus because it will become your eve life goal, to fork up that monthly 2.2 (and rising) bil for plex.
---
Just give CCP the damn 15 bucks (when you're ready for omega) and enjoy the rich and vibrant sandbox.
---
&gt;I look forward to small balances to frigs, dessys, cruisers, and all other ships so that the meta inside FW plexes remains ever changing and rich in content.
---
Been looking forward to that for a few years now.
---
&gt;and changing Plex timer mechanics so that players are strongly penalized for running from fights inside plexes.
---
Good idea, lets fuck with the newbro in his Rifter that ran from a gang of HG-something Worms/Succs/DDs. This idea isnt remotely possible with the current balance even with small changes.
---
&gt;Thank you to all the CSM members, CSM candidates, and other players that have not forgotten about FW.
---
Pretty sure CSM members have been aware of FW issues for years, but nothing gets fixed. Either CSM or CCP is useless.
---
Wasn't this posted a few hours ago?
---
most titan pilots will have a nestor in its SMA
---
No, it doesn't affect internet much.
---
It affects your computers ability to handle all the visuals and processing it needs to do.
---
You're making a hard argument there...
---
Alphas have loads of restrictions for all kinds of reasons.
---
How do you make the argument they should have t2 drones but not whatever other X thing they can't use?
---
You don't need t2 drones to be viable.
---
Pretty simple fit one med shield booster one em shield resistance amp and the stereotypical vni modules drone damage amps and for rigs use the shield amps and etc etc
---
No lasers no sentries
---
You can use lots of t2 fits for small ships as alpha.
---
&gt;It only gets rid of bait drops. It does absolutely nothing for any of those other things.
---
Explain how it doesnt.
---
&gt;Hardly, most of those don't die in 5 minutes anyway, except when getting hot dropped.
---
Then you had your chance. Caps shouldnt instantly die to small stuff.
---
&gt;You basically want to completely destroy a style of small gang combat to do basically nothing to the large alliances. you clearly have no idea what you're talking about.
---
It protects small gang and solo. You want guaranteed kills by being able to instantly teleport a ton of ships. What is the similar effort counter to this that isnt a cyno?
---
So maybe you aren't sure what you are talking about?
---
Yeah. It's a crosspost of the same post.
---
Subscription is a requirement. It's a subscription game.
---
Yes, if you give your product away more people will buy it, but your business won't last very long like that.
---
I'm aware, but there are elements of the community that argue that Alphas should never use T2 gear.
---
So wormholes
---
Or maybe it's difficult to fix?
---
There are gneiss rocks in wormhole space that are 1,000,000 m3 big. You can afk on them for hours with a rorqual. So come to wh space you filthy krabs so that I can farm you :)
---
That would be max duration.
---
Moons have fixed asteroid sizes that increase with the duration of the extraction.
---
It’s so cute, isn’t it?
---
You have to use webs on the warriors to kill them if you are using autocannons FYI.
---
Also, Daughter aggro gave the drones +1.
---
Join a corporation.
---
Individual standings don't matter, only corporations average standings.
---
I’m gay
---
&gt;Or maybe it's difficult to fix?
---
Maybe they just dont want to?
---
&gt; Caps shouldnt instantly die to small stuff.
---
But you also aren't letting us drop capitals on their capitals....
---
So you want carrier ratters and rorquals to be safer?
---
&gt; It protects small gang and solo
---
How? Those situations wouldn't be any better off against people just waiting a system or 2 over.
---
The nullsec security umbrella is way better off with the fleet needing to move through systems.
---
You keep claiming to help small gang and solo while only helping the mega coalitions.
---
Sure.
---
It's actually quite difficult to help new players, even for the helpers.  New players are only occasionally in much of a position to help one another.
---
For example, it takes 4x as many market slots to stock items for a gaggle of new players than it does to stock a hub for players a season or two old, who are accustomed to using T2 as a standard.
---
One fairly obvious solution was to make meta 1-4 into sidegrades rather than upgrades, and allow players to use invention well before T2.
---
Well, I don't see you presenting any good fix options.
---
So, I guess nobody cares.
---
Thanks I appreciate that! Basically I just want to know what ship and fit I need to fight level 1 security missions and I'll be on track again! o7
---
Have you ever actually done a bombing run?    
---
The way you typed this response tells me that you have not.  The re-cloak time is not instantaneous, I can tell you that much.  With a proper set up, you can bomb and warp off to a ping, however.  If you mean Focused Void Bombs, that's another problem entirely.  Aiming a shot, flying in a STRAIGHT LINE while you wait for it to tick to a perfect distance and letting loose... THEN warping around / resetting.  
---
There is nothing quite like it.
---
Because that discussion has been had many times in the past and CCP ignored all of it.
---
backups, m8
---
Yawn.
---
Cared enough to comment
---
Infact they can do it better and faster usually especially when it comes to minigames and puzzles..  All that would be achieved is slowing down real players and no changes to bots
---
no it just stops the client hitting a dram wall and closing / being unresponsive
---
My total net worth is something around 120 billion, so my titan represents about 75% of that, and I bought my titan with exactly this purpose in mind, I absolutely do not make enough money to replace it anytime in the next 6-12 months. If I could it wouldn't have any magic to me at all. 
---
I would say I'm in a small minority, but your example does not hold water for all people, your statements are very generalizing and imply that there is no such thing as a risk-averse person. My first Hel cost me 95% of my net worth when I bought it, it was hypered so nobody was coming to save me, and I dropped it wildly 3x+ a day, and gated it from place to place with only my interceptor to scout to save fatigue because I would drop it so much. 
---
For some people risk is a thrill, the only one I could ever get out of the game anyways, knowing that I had to do everything right or I was going to lose everything, was the most fun I ever had in the game.
---
&gt; Did you know that it costs five times as much to attract a new customer ? Because it does. Five times or MORE.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; You can look it up, although I know from direct business experince
---
[Citation needed]
---
&gt;But you also aren't letting us drop capitals on their capitals....
---
Nor are they allowed to drop caps to instantly defend, but you can drop after the delay. Are you saying a cap should die to a pack of no risk retris within 2-3 minutes?
---
If they are allowed to drop, you basically always die unless n+1 (but then you are not a small gang).
---
&gt;How? Those situations wouldn't be any better off against people just waiting a system or 2 over.
---
Because with a delay it is possible to fight stuff without risking instant uncounterable death. Particularly true for brawling.
---
&gt;The nullsec security umbrella is way better off with the fleet needing to move through systems
---
Why are caps often fitted with cynos then?
---
What is the similar effort counter that isnt a cyno?
---
&gt;You keep claiming to help small gang and solo while only helping the mega coalitions.
---
I have explained how they are helped. You seem to disagree because you have a sense of entitlement to guaranteed kills by having a blob on standby.
---
Good for you.
---
I've been trying to get into it, doing some readings and looking at the regions on the map. Any advice and recommendations on what faction to join?
---
Yes, we get it, you don't have to post it for the second time
---
Alphas are not legitimate players. They are not paying for the development of this game, paying players are. So I give a big fuck off to any alphas bitching about this change.
---
Anyone 'member drakes?
---
Waaar
---
There are many of us that believe you (the alpha state, not the person) shouldn't exist at all.
---
Alphas shouldn't have access to Eve.
---
What did you hope to achieve by doing that?
---
Or access to the game at all.
---
20 K +  bpc.... so may cans.
---
And fix the industry blueprint loading while you are at it.
---
That's never how Alpha was intended to work. Alpha accounts are meant to be fully playable as only Alpha if you so choose. It was meant to remove the subscription barrier and get more players in game while still encouraging Omega subscriptions by locking features behind a paywall. 
---
 I agree with trying to hamper botting using Alpha accounts, but your suggestion about it being just an extended trial account is incorrect.
---
you don't have to penalize the newbro specifically...just the side he's fighting for.
---
Ignored? Or didn't find a good solution?
---
got a vindi fit?
---
Add two more plex sizes, BS size and something so small faction frigs cannot go in, alphas and newbs need a place to learn. 
---
Delete missions from FW, there is zero need for them, all they do is screw the LP markets for the players actually playing FW. 
---
Add more incentives to the most active corps\\alliances, something like the ability to pick a "focus" system that boosts LP would give some organization to the active players.  
---
Good post, keep posting until they hear us, lowsec and FW should be the main space for new player retention.
---
Lolwut?
---
I fly alone.
---
Wow you really missed your mark there.
---
&gt; What is the similar effort counter that isnt a cyno?
---
Of there are no cynos they just need to bubble gates. And the threat is removed entirely. Even more afk ratting and mining in capitals.
---
You can already cyno inhibit the defense if they aren't ready which they generally aren't.
---
It's just shocking how little you have thought through this plan.
---
This change would only help the coalitions and hurt anyone trying to attack their soft underbellies.
---
No they were not
---
LOL I’ve lost one so far and my heart almost broke lol. But now I know these low level ones are mostly expandable
---
Oh man I miss POTBS
---
This did not make any sense at all.... You turned a great movie into aids, even attempted to make goons out to be good guys? lol
---
Once I learn what this all means I’ll be certain to come back to this comment
---
its a shame you only use a very small portion of it then
---
*cough* phear not again! :)
---
I remember when the circlejerk was in full effect saying how it wouldn't make a difference in FPS. I'm happy they're all wrong.
---
they should make it impossible to come out of warp at any location closer than 10km from a date
---
Ignored.
---
No karma fleet is recruiting? Is this even a goon post
---
Please. I have 65 tabs on my phone alone.
---
So you are saying in both cases, without a gunner, the Small Gang is fine?
---
And if they have gunners, then you lose some ships to a keepstar.  And you might or might not lose some to a pos gun?
---
Seems fine?
---
So like wibla but for gsf eh
---
That is changing the proposal.
---
Is it reasonable to be punished in some way for not fighting something that you have no chance against?
---
If you forget about isk coming your way if you have to wait longer than 20 minutes I don’t know how you do business.
---
For profit I have to wait for the once or twice a month I fly 6 industrials out my hole full of gas, PI, sleeper loot, and random crap I built, contract it all to Jita, fly there, and get it all sold.
---
&gt; bot domi's would be much more catchable though due to their slower align time
---
I see this meme repeated constantly by people who have not hunted Dominix bots.
---
They already exist, so please show me how easy it is to catch Dominixes that warp to sites at 100km, drop sentries, and snipe at rats from 80km away.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/77100425/
---
They pull drones instantly as soon as you are in system, and you start a 10 second timer before they warp off, during which you need to dscan, warp, land, and burn at least 70km (with an overheated faction point) in order to catch 'em.
---
I've been winning at eve since roughly Ascension, is it worth getting back into? Hows the state of the game right now?
---
All of the factions are exciting now that a lot of Gallente pilots moved to nullsec. Create and/or seek out your own type of fun - there's larger F1 style alliances, but there's also small corporations trying to make a name by turbo killing everything around them. Think of what you're most excited about in FW pvp, then ask for that in recruitment channels. Weigh responder's killboards and just pick a couple and go for it. If you're not happy within a few days, change corporations. Rinse and repeat; you'll find your match
---
Yeah wow. Looks so good. Love that big congealed ball of spikey metal in the space. Thanks.
---
Evanova is amazing
---
Probably a super complicated algorithm to decide what ads to show you
---
They would basically be tiny versions of the development of Eve. So people could continuously get a taste of how Eve used to be. Yes we had battleships when the game was released, but it would be nice to start small. And work up to battleships. Then after a while give tech 2 ships access. The last last upgrades would be capitals and structures. 
---
Just an idea. I think it would grow the game.
---
because nobody gives a fuck
---
it's a subscription game, so subscribe.
---
stop pretending your trial account should have the same access to shit the rest of us pay monthly for.
---

He had a better amount of first-round votes and a lot of transfers from Gobbins (541 at the final round). But Steve had better transfers over Sort (Steve transfers - Sort transfers) from candidates other than Gobbins.
---
40+ from Dunk
---
40+ From Vily
---
100+ from Killah Bee
---
170+ from me
---
Basically, if I did a worse job and needed some of my transferred votes then he wouldn't get in. Which shows an interesting kind of mutual synergy between candidates sharing overlapping voter bases.
---
&gt; your suggestion about it being just an extended trial account is incorrect.
---
that's not a suggestion.
---
alphas are just trial accounts that don't expire.
---
&gt;battleship that costs a ton more than a Battleship.
---
The fact that there's actual free-to-play kind of makes it more alarming now, though.  A lot of gamers will play absolute shit for a while just because it's free.  The 3 month retention isn't that surprising, but 90% loss in the first WEEK is pretty nuts.
---
I think they've put too much stock in being able to make up lost revenue elsewhere, AKA cash shop, mobile projects, and the dozens of other failed projects they've tried to make.  I think they're just starting to hit the breaking point where they're such low numbers that those other ventures need to pay off fast, but its not going to happen since nearly everything else has been a failure.  I'd bet there some serious panic at CCP.
---
Was there any more news about pirate implants other than what's on the slides
---
I think that's part of the problem.  They try to coddle in every new version of the NPE over the past couple years, and it just sets up expectations for something that EVE is not.  This makes it even bigger system shock when the short NPE is over.
---
If the sub wasnt a requirement how would CCP make money? I honestly doubt people leave because they feel like they need to be subbed vs leaving because they just dont like the game.
---
Check out solo PvP videos from Blights Wretch.
---
https://www.youtube.com/user/KnightSmiley96
---
you disgust me.
---
So there do exist players who only log in for events. I call them ping warriors, I'm sure others have same or similar names.  They have a lot going on in life or just at their version of end game so they log in for what could be major battles or important meetings. 
---
As to get them to play more often. I'm sure theres a combination of things that could help. Different event, new items. Maybe they dont have a solid group to play with?  Itll be different for everyone
---
...why?
---
I actually inject test. It's good shit.
---
&gt; And I honestly think that the only way to achieve that cool factor to  get people hooked on the game is to provide them with a short cinematic  story at the beginning. With more voice acting and such. 
---
They already tried this with a NPE iteration a year or so ago.  It doesn't help with retention; it may actually make things worse.  Basically it sets up expectations for something that EVE is not, and as soon as it ends, the player feels like they're dropped into a different game.
---
Dare I say he was... judged?
---
Serious question: how has CCP killed HS missions?
---
get closer?
---
I take them down with a single Dominix solo. It's not for everybody to do though. 
---
[Did you look at the wiki entry?](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Forward_Operating_Base)
---
Nah, let's go back to before, when warping was always to 10km and you had to have a bookmark collection of the 0 on gate locations.
---
For Science!
---
You know. I try hard, Every day I wake up thinking. How can I disgust Dave. It's a never ending thought for me.
---
But also, for a new player, have perfect powergrid means almost nothing.
---
Wow about the FPS was very obivous. The problem is related to TIDI imo
---
We need a black magic over that
---
Why would you bother trying to do PD beyond Lvl 500...?
---
Pretty sure he's a dude, i think he face cammed at one point on his youtube
---
Except it isn't really free to play and those people that will play shit free to play may just run because of that
---
Karma, because some people have no other significant achievements.
---
I contemplated just starting over on an alt and getting a second, third, ... 7th marshal. But honestly I prefer just to stick to one toon. That said I am hopeful CCP adds new rewards above 500
---
Yeah, the numbers themselves aren't helpful without data on why these players are leaving.
---
More than a few will be simply because what EVE is is not at all what they wanted.
---
Some will be because they can't figure it out.
---
Some will be because it's hard.
---
Some will be because the fun stuff isn't clear.
---
Have to figure out the numbers for each of those.
---
Level 1s are super easy, 95% of them can be done in a T1 frigate.  You should have a few T1 frigs from your tutorial agents.   Ratting (security missions/anomolies) in EVE are weird; you often face huge odds (like 10-20+ ships VS you) but that's because said ships are so much weaker than yours.  In L1 missions you can usually oneshot most enemies with a volley from your guns on a T1 frigate.  If you fit out a destroyer it is completely overkill for all L1s, and can do most L2s without an issue.
---
The default UI has a chat window, your ship modules and the overview...
---
It's actually pretty bsrebones.
---
The issue is just that the overview can be daunting.
---
I'm going to put this in to perspective..
---
Myself..along with basically everyone I played eve with quit after wormholes were royally fucked. Most of us were working age and could afford 100 dollars a year for a sub... I personally spent 500 or so dollars a year paying for this game at my height.
---
Ccp didnt care what paying customers had to say when they nerfed w space and killed w spaxe content by creating rorqs online.
---
You are sitting here crying about ccp essentially nerfing ratting ships for your free alpha account and act as If you provide something for the game.  
---
So go cut your neighbors grass for 20 dollars and you can afford a sub... or quit.
---
So that people camping the novices in instalocking lokis can get more “content” ofc
---
Pretty sure since CCP doesn’t actually play the game they just look at statistics out of context to make decisions, or just randomly do stuff, one of the two
---
I mean a max krab super selling escalations and using an ESS can get what, ~400m/hr?
---
VNIs are easily 60m/hr and for the price of a super and a super pilot, you can get 4 or 5 vnis.
---
Yeah, MMOs are mostly dying except in the Asian markets.
---
The scope of conventional game is growing large enough to cover a lot of the appeal of an MMO while maintaining a crafted gameplay experience, all while MMOs are bogged down with fetch quests and auto players. (It's really wierd how many modern MMOs seem to be built with not in mind, if not outright designed into the game)
---
One issue there could be that it gives false expectations.
---
Terrible highsec corps are probably the worst thing.
---
Noble work tbh
---
We the players are welcoming and help you all ease into the dog-eat-dog world of New Eden. Mostly because we could always use more PvPers to spice up the world.
---
Fly safe. o7
---
AT tournament teams, and those who support them.
---
Look how serious you took that comment. I couldnt imagine how awful comms would be with you.
---
autism
---
Those expectations are already there, the people trying the game and quitting within a week are doing so because they found the game to be nothing like what they expected it to be from the epic trailers and news articles about the game.
---
Did CCP ever provided numbers about that NPE experiment? I never saw it, that's why i'm asking.
---
Because honestly i'd be surprised if things actually got worse after that. I wouldn't be surprised if it didn't change anything, because in that case i'd make the argument that it was too short, and didn't lead into anything interesting. In fact if i'm not mistaken after that NPE tutorial was finished the game told you to do the old career mission system, which is fucking terrible, i almost fell asleep doing those when i first started the game because of how boring they were.
---
But yeah if things actually got worse after that experiment then, I'd honestly say that this is hopeless, because i really don't think that just improving the UI and making it simpler to understand will improve the player retention issue enough to actually actually get eve growing.
---
Or maybe a better alternative and perhaps cheaper, is for CCP either to automatically throw new players into the Player organizations (like Horde/Brave/Karma fleet etc..) or for CCP to manage the new player corps that clones are created into, and try to push actual player engagement within those groups.
---
yeah and a custom  created overview would still be overly complex for a new player anyway which was my point. 
---
Only way to fix that is to actually do a complete overhaul of the overview system which is something CCP has hinted at in the past, but never actually made any serious attempt at doing it.
---
I miss it too. Best Travel Ship.
---
Shoot back.

&gt;some of the best pvpers have hundreds if not thousands of ship losses
---
How else would they develop the experience to become the best?
---
I like great addition
---
Something tells me that you're in an Imperium alliance larger than Initiative.
---
Is 32gb of RAM common these days? I build my rig on a budget with 8gb six years ago.... it is getting a bit long in the tooth.
---
Problem is that isn't sustainable long term. It's a one-time content injection.
---
a minor issue, but i could tell how technically bad the team was by their inability to make a UI that can handle 1000 items at once without lagging like crazy
---
.  Level of competency i would expect from junior developers.
---
&gt; Also how much crew these ships have. Supercapitals have crews of hundreds of thousands if not millions.
---
[Officially it's much lower than that](http://wiki.eve-inspiracy.com/index.php?title=New_Eden_Crew_Guidelines) - even Titans in standard military configurations aren't designed to house a million people. (Although you could probably fit that many on, it might be too taxing on the life-support, the plumbing or whatever.)
---
This game is meant to be subscribed to. They introduced alpha a couple of years ago as bait to entice new subscribers.
---
What do you mean would be? It is a thing.
---
Plenty of nice folks if you are polite. Hell, i ventured into my first WH after a week, got blasted, asked nicely if he could teach me stuff. He taught for a bit and dumped 50M isk into my account without a word and logged off.  I was so astounded as a noob i sat in my home station for rest of the day looking at the figure. I mailed him to say thank you but never got a reply.
---
Haha I find this very funny
---
I'm sure every PvP corp has ping warriors, this isn't a new phenomenon. I'd imagine the active count could easily triple or more if every group pinged simultaneously at a good timezone crossover.
---
How everybody just thinks of a missing reward and nobody about that minigame actually being useful for reallife science. 
---
Also some people actually play games just because they enjoy it, that includes stuff like Project Discovery.

What fit do you use in your domi?
---
Also, do you just warp on the structure?

i am smashong d-scan in highsec even with weapons .

I'm amarr, I used a punisher. I had 3 guns fitted an after burner and repair. I tried it with a web, warped out tried it with a shield booster warped out. I tried to take the group of 3 first without aggroing the other 7 but even after a full 2 minutes I hadn't gotten close to killing the first ship I locked. I'm clearly doing something wrong as I destroyed all the tutorial ships in basically one shot. Hope this was the right sort of information.
---
State of the game is good. There’s a little bit of lack of big wars because like 70% of nullsec is friendly, but i don’t really notice outside this subreddit. Wormhole space is great, which is what I’ve been doing recently, and there’s lots of new ships and content because of the triglavian expansions that were released recently.

My 64-bit Win7 still doesn't indicate anything but the 32-bit launcher..

Finally wouldn’t need all my alts in the same corp for easy asset access.
---
Okay. Well, if you have some new way of getting rid of bots, we are all ears.
---
People thinking they’re going to be catching domis or any other bots easier are a wee bit deluded.
---
Well, first stop mining.
---
Why are you so concerned with fun when you've just been shooting lazers at the same rocks for so long?
---
You have seen the abyss.
---
I’m just arguing you can figure out the isk/hr for anything, mining, huffing, or any type of ratting.
---
I know how much C28 my Ventures huff, I can say I made 120m in the last hour huffing some gas sites, I just don’t get isk till someone buys it from me.
---
I can even figure out the actual effort isk/hr of doing PI, you just divide your earnings by how much time you spent cumulatively on that task.
---
I know someone had just posted it previously, but they've played before so wasn't sure if it would apply:  
---
Is the game worth getting into if you're a newbie? I don't really play well by myself, so I usually try to find or start my own Clan(or Corp, in Eve's Case) - how easy is it to get into a Corp? Are the rumors of spreadsheets really true, do you need'em in order to actually 'git gud', I guess?
---
I don't know who Olmeca is    from his YouTube videos I certainly think that he has some grandiose ideas and I don't think they're going to get much done with CSM this year if they allow him in the meetings because he going to whine and complain because he has a special type of snowflake we'll probably lots of money in real life
---
and my argument was 
---
\&gt;in one case you get a fixed amount of isk per activity, in the other you don't and you need aditional work to get actual ISKs.
---
I was never saying you can't makeup a number of isk/h for any activity.
---
You can get 32 gb easy now. They make 16 gb sticks, picked up 64gb recently for my rig.

Isn’t that the PL “hacking” their titans out of bubbles meme?

yeah and 40000 and 40(00)0 are also different because you add parenthesis :big_thonk: What's the point ?

Hey I'm just seeing this post. If you don't like your people botting. Awox their botters, give blue intel to hunters, kick the corps that are hosting these bots, raise their rent. Dont go "aww man bots :("
---
You wanna prove you're helping against botting, do something about the botting issue
---
Pretty much never use Hail in small autos.
---
Yet to try it, great to hear all the positive feedback though.
---
It's because all the qol changes.
---
Before having multisell, multibuy, no clines to be updated, autofits etc. all those took time. So you could be logged inand have something to do, buttons to push and maybe find something else to do. Now tou can do all those in 3 mins so what s the point of logging in if there s no foght yet?
---
Ok, it’s isk with more steps.
---
It seems like it is! A couple of weeks ago I upgraded from 4gb to 8gb )) I didn’t notice much difference, but I play on potato so..
---
and variable.
---
Anything that causes you to put a fame down, walk away for a day or two and come back, is an issue. That's the EXACT SAME THING they use in predatory micro-transaction mobile games. Skill injectors are basically our predatory thing.
---
besides most fuckers seem to not stand the presence of alpha guys I agree with you, everything CCP takes away from alphas is detrimental to the game since it makes the game less appealing to them, why would I waste time in a hard game that really limits my options to just find out if I want to pay to maybe keep playing?  
---
I feel like CCP saw people ratting as alphas as a dangerous activity to plex price and the possibility they have to go omega without paying.
---
Im omega btw
---
"easily"
---
The day I buy a mining permit is the day I uninstall EVE.
---
Very easy. Honestly probably as easy as it’s ever been. I joined a little over a year ago and am having a blast, not much has changed since then. There’s all this new trig stuff, and the new jump bridges, but that doesn’t really effect a new player that much. Most of the trig stuff is high end pve, so you can look into that later on, and the jump bridge changes won’t matter to you unless you become a stratop FC, which again, won’t happen for a while, if ever. 
---
There’s also lots of new player friendly corps. As you can probably tell by my flair, I recommend Pandemic Horde, but it’s far from the only option. Brave Newbies, Templis Calsif, Red vs Blue, and POS Party are all very good corps that will accept you right away. 
---
Spreadsheets are only important if you do industry. If you like them a lot and enjoy setting up code things, then you should probably look into industry after you get set up, but 99% of the players just ignore that stuff completely
---
I know exactly what I’m getting for blue loot, gas and PI moves around a bit, I was in a hurry to sell one day, that day was a 20 day low in sales volume for the commodity, that was a bit of a loss.
---
I didn't even know this game existed. I'm curious now.
---
That's because your are off topic. The question was about killing rats for bountys, and mining roids to sell them for isks.
---
If you don't read the question I'm afraid your answer has zero relevance.
---
And there is A LOT of cytoplasm.
---
I feel like for an intermediate player it starts to mean something though, which is where the "grind" should come in - new players should be able to get "up to snuff" in exchange for doing things that teach them the game, but "up to high level" in exchange for doing things that push them towards needing the skills.
---
It has become autistic forced habit.
---
Please add this to the ship hangar as well. Or at least station containers that work in there. Just anything to reduce the list to a manageable level. I pretty frequently deliver ships to myself that I don't use often, but more than not at all.

what are you trying to say? I'm not sure I follow your point

I think you meant to say enter an Asteroid Anomaly.
---
The "fix" with sliding was accidental when they changed other stuff about the plexes and they dont know how to get it back 😀
---
I see. Well, no doubt the infrastructure is capable of handling it well enough, I’ve never had an issue with it. It’s going to be the outliers, and they’re always there, it’s EVE after all, that have that stupid large stack of stuff in one station.
---
Do you know how to link fits? I could take a look or give you some suggestions on one to try.
---
Also make sure to make use of the rookie help channel in game! People there are pretty great. Small question or big.

You can always test it on Singularity if you're willing to wait.

Löst 5b in ships last week. Im immune now

I'm not so sure about fps improvements. 64bit only allows client to use more memory, so fps will still be tied to CPU/GPU. Stuttering however, should be reduced greatly.

Easily explained away by saying you're siming in pilot training.

He said he thought about it but didn’t have the isk, since cloaky camping Delve is not very profitable with no one ratting in it

Yeah, you get used to the ship losses, i lost three battlecruisers in under two hours the other day, but hey, insurance.

If you want your ship to live longer than a year dont undock it, i have a logi-cruiser in my hangar that i havent undocked for a year thats still alive. everything else from that period is dead or sold :)

Well, it’d be better than the current goon strategy on naming things, because “the war of summer 2018” is not any easier
---
&gt; The winners decide the name
---
As you can see, it doesn't work quite as well when you cannot physically silence the other side. And ofc it won't work at the moment outside your side's media when said war losers are nowhere near having to lay low.
---
Okay so in the past there was a 1000 item limit for ships and items separately.  At some point they combined them so you could only have a total 1000 ships + item stacks.
---
As someone that had probably 500+ fitted ships in one station, I had to have alts fit ships for me because I simply could not have modules/rigs/ammo sitting in my hangar to fit new ships.  For a time I got around this by trading everything to one character because it would allow me to surpass the 1k limit.
---
Until the day I logged in and the node crashed....and it continued to crash every time that character entered the system.  CCP stepped in and told me not to enter that system until after downtime because I was literally crashing the node because I had too much shit.
---
It speaks truth does it not? Unless we called it the war of summer 2020 now.. Its not inaccurate
---
It looks so good now
---
That doesn't really mean anything to how it feels to the player.
---
But my point is just that the "magic 14" aren't really super important in those first few weeks which is the main concern.
---
It's hardly even a bandaid on that issue.
---
I just want a name for that war. It was the biggest war in terms of Titan battles ever, involving literally all of nullsec and some of lowsec (Snuff and FedUp), but somehow nobody thought of a good name for it?
---
Thanks a lot!
---
So what should they do about potential candidate from that goon WH section, whatever it is (was?) called - just for example?
---
When CCP confirm a bot, they should ban one random member of their alliance from r/eve.
---
Keep up the good work. Fuck Dave.
---
No... It would be ever expanding. New regions like every 2 years.

Especially whose voting is organized.

PanFam, they'll log in but we're still working on getting them to undock.
---
lmao what the fuck are you talking about? this nerf largely affects AFK ratting, which by design isn't something you'd enjoy doing, while actively buffing PvP and those who are active when ratting. also, nobody gives a fuck about your post grad degree when you're sperging shit like this on the internet, get fucked you idiot
---
Remember "WH candidate" that quickly turned into basically a goon CSM member shortly after getting elected a few CSMs ago? You would just see more stuff like that, except less spontaneous.
---
Aren't too bright are you? Idiot and post grad degrees and multiple successes in various areas of life are mutually exclusive.
---
I used small words to make it easy for you.
---
Get in contact with pushx or redfrog, im sure their JF pilots can fly carriers too.
---
What was about his previous term(s)&gt;
---
cool story, all those post grad degrees and you still can't understand something as simple as a VNI rework in an online space game
---
“At the end the Imperium had more pressure “
---
Meaning cyno-in 200 more dudes to make it  3:1.
---
In this case it would be gold frog.
---
If you are not able to support your titan maybe you shouldn't have it ?
---
I mean, they weren't even in the best position to exploit the changes that brought current iteration of their empire to the top, compared to other null forces. I don't think we can say those were played straight into their hands.
---
Yep pushx has moved caps before but you have to talk to them in their discord
---
Considering you can always make sure your candidate does not have any "official" in-game ties to your alliance, yeah, it's pretty hard.
---
People seem to be converging on 16 for gaming PCs.
---
Second.
---
A domi can always rat pre-aligned to a citadel, right? Also they can fit a mjd and even a cyno. ;)
---
Another thing to add to the soundboard to scare my corpmates. :D
---
There's always one fucking guy lol
---
Paid 'newb' spotted
---
2mb puts you already ahead of the Australians.
---

---
Haha dude, PM me... ;-)
---
i mean.. you dont have to tell me that.. but apparently thousands of eve payers dont understand it. so why not tell that a newbro that said he is in fear of getting killed?
---
i dont think 64bit and visual have anything to do with each other....
---
I couldn't find the CCP dev Q&amp;A at Eve North on the CCP stream VOD, was it recorded ?
---
No. Managing heat is one of the few skills this game still requires. You also seem ignorant of some basic overheat mechanics. Maybe learn how it works before asking for more crutches? Before you ask, EVE UNI already has a decent wiki on heat. Read it.
---
I understand quite well. I also understand it won't do what you lot think it will for various reasons which I alluded to. Or did you miss that part?
---
I'm saying I agree with you, SP time is hindering new players. They stop playing to train and never return.
---
You can always use faction drones, dude.
---
Lets take one of the few piloting skill components out of pvp, great idea.....
---
Roll out next alpha char - help silence and get the reward.
---
This might surprise you, but I agree with your post 100%.  
---
Having said that, however, I would point out that in deliberately accepting the risk of loss, you reach the same endpoint that most people use isk to achieve.
---
When I started playing Overwatch, I made the conscious choice to be ok with losing. For me, I play Overwatch not to win or lose a match, but to play well. I don't care if I lose a match because I know that I, at least, played well and had fun. Some of my favorite moments have been in matches that I ultimately lost, but was able to look back on with enjoyment because of what I had done personally.
---
Similarly, when you drop your hel/titan, you're doing it for the thrill of the fight, which stems from the scale of the potential loss. Without the scale of the loss, there would be no thrill. But, because you accept the potential for loss, if/when you *do* lose it you won't rage quit the game because you accepted the risk as part and parcel of getting the thrill.
---
Thus, I imagine that if/when you lose it you will simply buy another one when you can and do it again.
---
  
---
When most people say "don't fly what you can't afford to lose" they refer to isk, but what you've just pointed out is that what's really important is to be willing to *accept* the loss. In your case you *can't* afford to lose your hel/titan in terms of *isk*, but you *can* afford to lose it in terms of your day-to-day playing. 
---
This leaves me with a genuine question, however. You say that if you could easily replace your hel/titan, it would lose the magic of being a high value asset, but if you were to lose it, you would be unable to do a drop for quite a while. Assuming you're willing to take "risky" fights and not just ganks, wouldn't you enjoy it more if you could grab a new ship and get right back into dropping fairly quickly? Or is the thrill worth the long "respawn" after a loss?  
---
Or do you only fight mining barges in delve? lol :)
---
just sell it
---
Heat management via the gui is a real issue for people with poor eyesight. I often have no idea if I have toggled heat until I start getting damage to modules. I have learnt to cope with it now but an audible cue whenever heat was engaged or disengaged should be a game play changing thing for me and the other x % of the playerbase who wear glasses.
---
cant asset safety from stations only citadels mate
---
&gt; the novices
---
They still exist?
---
maybe it'll have The Black Lotus in it.
---
If you want to lose your drones each time you warp off, sure. But this a meme and doesn't actually happen.
---
I've never seen a botting Domi use Heavy Drones, their return time is absolute trash if you're ratting pre-aligned.
---
I don't know where people are getting this meme idea from, but it really just sounds like nothing more than armchair piloting. If you tried this in practice, you'd get frustrated at how much time you'd waste pulling the drones back.
---
Oh, your citation is a google search. That's what counts for "direct business experince" now-a-days? lmao
---
Prove me wrong. I await your failure.
---
&gt;Another alternative is to go talk to E-Uni (EVE University).
---
I've heard good things about them.
---
So what if you do?
---
It's not a nerf, its actually a pretty substantial buff to the VNI.
---
They died. Times were hard and they couldn't keep up
---
Raptor, Taranis, Crusader and Claw aren't nullified anymore.
---
Crow, Ares, Malediction and Stiletto still are.
---
That requires having a pulse and iq higher than a brick of cheese.
---
Beautiful shots!
---
Are you a sloth? Be honest.
---
"Good idea, lets fuck with the newbro in his Rifter..."
---
This.  Or even the old bro sitting in a plex in a tormentor when some pay to win tryhard warps in his  HG-something Worms/Succs/DDs...
---
Or the blob comes... for you.  No thank you.
---
So that way imposing the penalty will be effectively delegated to whoever is the biggest and most invested entity on that side that will no doubt end up - best case - hoard those newbros under its wing and tell them when not to play the game.
---
From the image, it seems that there are indeed vacancies opening up.
---
lol no, but I've been on both sides of bumps, so I *do* know what I'm talking about.
---
You also got random wormholers who voted for you, because you're better than the alternatives, even if you aren't a wh candidate.
---
What's the best way to get stuff out of lower asset safety?
---
Basically: took a 5 month break from EVE and when I came back my alliance dissolved and all my stuff is asset safetied out to a system being camped.
---
This cant be too uncommon, so surely there must be haulers that specialise in moving asset safety to jita?
---
Alternatively I will be flying a jump freighter by December, any tips for first time JF pilots? Mistakes to avoid?
---
Thanks
---
K. You missed the point of my post entirely.
---
ISK limit Alphas.
---
Ohhhh this hits too close to home. Haha
---
Its the easiest thing to avoid. So I don’t think you do.
---
Please expand and specify because I'm interested in your opinion on the matter.
---
So when I saw the VNI nerf the first thing I though was, 
---
"cool they are nerfing VNI alpha botting. I will just tell my newbros to swap to using Gilas, they will still have T2 medium drones."
---
Then I saw this nerd for the T2 medium drones.
---
Now it's just gonna take my newbros longer to train up.
---
Possible. Ah. Unless you, like me, realize there is no solution and were commenting tongue in cheek. Is that it? If so. Good on you.
---
Wardec mechanics.  
---
Corp/Alliance without structures can't be wardecced.  
---
Put your structures in a holding corp. Drop alliance, which has structures in different farming wormholes. You can't be wardecced and can move around freely in Highsec.
---
You mean when you see a domni on Dscan ratting, you dont auto warp to 100km?
---
¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
but they are, because they give new players a feeling of progression into the midgame, or "real eve", at least in my opinion.
---
Then why would the main Corp leave?
---
I wish you could change the colour from a bit brighter than normal green to something else, or change the overheat effect to something else entirely. My eyesight isn't bad (maybe its worse than I thought!) but I really struggle to tell if something is overheated, not even including the distraction nature of combat.
---
Faction has higher HP and Tracking, T2 has higher DPS and speed. Then you add the specialization skill damage bonus
---
Cause they have all the other medium weapon systems as T2.
---
You can always go back to free WoW... oh wait!
---
Salty
---
Don't use a JF. You're going to die. People in your situation are _exactly_ the type of people campers are looking to kill.
---
Go to the station, do an evepraisal, find out what's the most valuable shit, pull it out and make a public courier contract. It doesn't even have to be PushX or Redfrog or whatever. Slap some collat on it, set it to a good time to complete and just forget about it.
---
Congrats, you warp to the site at 100km, and now landed 160km away from the Domi at some weird angle.
---
Maybe you get lucky and know which of the structures they undock and warp to the Anomaly from. Maybe you're lucky and it's in line with the gate, so you land close on top of it.
---
Or, maybe you get the worst possible warp in and land 200km because the Domi warped to the site from the opposite direction.
---
Just keep in mind that there are people out there that specialize in camping high-volume asset safety stations. And they know what they are doing.
---
Find somebody who knows low-sec mechanics through and through and get them to help you out.
---
For drones, use titanium sabot
---
I didn't look at your user name and was about to comment that these are up there in quality with Razorien screenshots. You still on top :D
---
You have two options:  
---
1. Move all structures out of alliance  
---
2. Move all structures out of main corp and drop alliance  
---
I guess it was easier for Novac to use second options. Additionally being in an alliances is not important for most wormhole groups.
---
This seems like a lot of effort to create well wormhole space ( or shattered wormhole space ), like people that don't currently fight / life in a shattered are likely not gonna move into this new shattered without scanning.
---
Those aren't wormholes.
---
Imo they could delete the ore anomalies from null altogether. Why even have asteroid belts if they are pointless. Removing them would provide incentive to hold good truesec systems and potentially drive conflict
---
CCP also says a missile the size of a 3 story building weighs 100kg okay
---
Also, I read that as that you can park your ship outside for everyone to see, without risking it (as long as the station is up). At the moment a lot of WH entedies often leave their dreads outside to let others know that they are willing to defend their hole, or that they have heavy weapons in here for the case you try to put down your own structure
---
&gt; so what s the point of logging in if there s no foght yet?
---
make your own content instead of having someone else do it for you?
---
When heat first came out, it had a faint module glow and no vivid green tab at the top at all. They quickly added that. No changes to that UI since AFAIK.
---
Use shift + click instead of aiming for the overheat bar, that could help a bit!
---
it really should glow yellow or orange (but I worry the orange will be confused with the red for single-cycling)
---
one of my alts too is able to fly a JF (no money though, so I can't :D ) . So I'm interested too.
---
What I already know :
---
- You'll need at minima a cyno alt on another account
---
- never "warp to" when leaving a station, always align first, then warp. See that thread : https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c0yd5n/how_do_you_gank_jump_freighters_in_a_nyx/ . I did not know it was possible, so that's one less thing that will surprise you.
---
fellow six year old rig club. my GTX580 is just not doing so hot anymore.
---
8gb is below the base line if you have 32gb on board. My system typically hovers around 11gb with chrome being the biggest hog. RAM recovery depends on total available - the more you have, the less you have to page to HDD. 8gb is a-ok still for most things, though...
---
It's the shift button that's being eaten.
---
Scams, scams as far as the eye can see
---
To the left here we have jita local scams; where people will flood chat saying that you can get sweet sweet deals if you're fast enough.
---
To the right over there inside of the station you can find contract scams; they will list "Fire Sales!!!!, Hanger clean out!!!!" And the like, usually bundles of items that to an unsuspecting player looks good because of the few faction and other shiney loots but is actually listed for 300x it's actual value
---
And if you notice the small little things running around shouting "Double your isk now!!!!" Don't give them anything, it's just a con
---
A well piloted JF is gank immune. The most important part is having a good spot to cyno in on a station with a good model (good ratio between model size and docking radius)
---
The other guy is right though if it’s a high volume station then the courier services will get your stuff out.
---
This is the best way to deal with the situation.
---
move your shit  5minutes before downtime,this way saved my 100 praxises out of  delve,bought them cheaper than jita throught friend who lives there
---
Way to stick it to the man.
---
Keep doing what you're doing doing and if someone dumps some isk into your lap buy a few load outs of the ship you were flying, you can do better next time and will learn, don't go and dump it on one or two ships.
---
There's more to life than gay internet points.
---
Drop fw, move carrier, join fw.

Bless the guy who making eve memes, you’re very cool
---
Social commentary.
---
Love you bro.
---
I agree although I think being in the FW area while not being in a militia is much better unless you're a new comer and need isk. More targets is just mandatory.
---
Not for you, evidently.
---
Not everyone flies t1 frigs with only two modules.
---
A VNI with 5 Ogre IIs (no mods) does 475 dps and has piss poor tracking. (25% from Gal Cruiser V isn't going to make Ogres track good.) It also has no tank bonus.

The New VNI will have 2 Ogre IIs, 2 Hammerhead IIs and a Hobgoblin II as its drone loadout. And 3 Heavy Neutron Blaster IIs in its highs. This combo loaded with Void M does 567 dps with no damage mods. On top of that its drone tracking gets buffed from 25% to 50% at Gal Cruiser 5. It also gains a 50% bonus to Medium Hybrid Damage and Tracking. On top of all that extra damage and damage application it gets 37.5% bonus to local reps. 
---
So you lose some drone damage but gain huge blaster bonus. The tracking bonus is also deadly on rails, with that huge bonus and only using 3 turrets the normally harsh fitting of 250mm rails/neutrons won't be so bad either.
---
You are trolling right?
---
Meaning to multiple clients at the same time. Not remotely executing commands
---
TLDR: So nothing died.
---
Yeah those who can do that benefit from those qol changes. I was talking about those who can't or don't want to make their own content for one reason or another
---
I like to think part of cva's soul died a little.
---
I doubt it. If game is bottlenecked by ram it would stutter, not drop fps. In big fleet fights however, 64bit would help since game could load much more resources for all the things happening on screen.  
---
This is just my understanding, if someone could elaborate on that it would be great.
---
Hell yes downvote the opinion this man has
---
I heard that people who opted in to the 64 bit beta had their overviews and configs wiped. Is that still a thing? I would like to upgrade but not at the cost of having to spend hours remapping all my controls, settings etc..
---
Some very nice pics there.
---
Just disable the heat if it's about to burn something (with ability to override it for people who like to play dangerous), would be great QoL improvement as well!
---
Imagine, you're all waiting for the moment to get the fuck out.
---
And it doesn't come. And the enemy lands. And you're still bubbled. And WHAT THE TIPANNY FUCK and oh hey the bubble's dropped. And you see all your boys cyno out under the very guns of the enemy caps. And then you start to warp away yourself.
---
Oh hey, no one tackled a fukkin thing.
---
It was like outrunning the cops.
---
Oh no! That doesn't sound good!
---
I post less frequently these days but it's nice to hear I'm not all washed up just yet. ;)
---
That’s because in a Domi you use sentries and can insta pull drones and warp
---
Restored deleted comment, since reddit app is awesome...:
---
I dont think ram would increase fps.
---
&gt; but even an upgrade to twice that will bring noticeable improvements with it
---
No it won't.
---
Evedroid is pretty cool app for android.
---
tl;dr ccp made wardecs absurdly cheap, the counter mechanic of killing their hq won't happen as you need to counter-dec the aggressor, which defeats the point on so many levels
---
So novac adapted, left their alliance, and is immune to wardecs. :shrug:
---
Typically i would hold shift and click on the module since i'm not accurate enough to hit an F key (maybe i'll rebind this to my mmo mouse, but changing profiles between EvE and WoW is a huge pita.)
---
For most things its fine to realize 1-2 seconds later that for example i'm not orbiting yet and click the onscreen button when the keybind failed. But for this the button is so tiny and hard to hit on top of the 1-2 seconds being the difference between just running out of heat and burning out your guns.
---
Like just jump in to region, buy stuff from market and asset safety it out.
---
Fuck, I was going to comment that. R/magictcg is leaking
---
That's... literally the point... ?
---
Botting Dominixes all use Sentries and warp to sites at 100km away. I have seen exactly _zero_ use Heavies, let along this Horde dude's armchair theorycrafting about ratting while aligned/MJD/Cyno'd or whatever.
---
My comment was that people who say either:
---
1) Catching botting Dominixes is easier than catching VNIs "because they align slower", and
---
2) People saying botting Dominixes will just krab while constantly aligned,
---
both have never actually hunted for botting Dominixes, because experience would very quickly show them why it doesn't work the way they think it does.
---
If I'm ratting prealigned, I'll be like 10km away from the center of a haven so the heavy drones can return quickly (drone nav computer in the mids). If someone appears on the grid before the drones return, I'll just hit warp and leave the drones behind.
---
If I'm ratting at 100km using sentries then I'll fit a mjd for easy escape (scoop drones &gt; mjd &gt; warp).
---
Tell him to fuck off, goons already have a candidate for another section. It doesn't matter if its a goon wormholer, hes gunna do whatever mittani says anyway because goons live to suck their leaderships peepees
---
They take 20min once you land on grid at the gas sites.
---
&gt; If I'm ratting prealigned, I'll be like

&gt;If I'm ratting at 100km using sentries then I'll
---
Cool, I don't care how you want to armchair theorycraft. You knock yourself out coming up with these hypothetical scenarios. I'm talking about bots and how they work.
---
I quit a long time ago and never fully got into FW when it was new, but the only real arena 'pvp' I found in the game was when incursions came out.  Even in highsec, it was pretty fun to compete with another group for a site's payout by doing more dps.  Opened up plenty of design ideas and led to things I'd have never done otherwise, like an auto targeting system on the spare high slot of a nightmare so you could lock 2 more ships.
---
I've always thought that's a dumb argument. 
---
Having an additional sound effect has nothing to do with "skill". It does not provide any more information, it just presents the same information in a better way.

2/ fighting off the Imperium in KVN.

Twas a proper 1v1 at the sun, it was.

(Iron Armada did fight well against T-C, what boggles the mind is why they need to spin such a patently false narrative on top of that. Oh well)
---
Championship is the best ship!
---
PushX or %JBV sale. If you want, PM me with an evepraisal of everything &amp; an ask price - you've moving on to a new alliance that lives in new space, right? You don't really need or want to keep any of your old gear.
---
Depending on the site you can usually just warp off after they spawn. In Venture/Prospect at least.
---
Being able to pay attention to multiple things in a stressful situation is a skill. Bad players will often not realise their drones are being killed, not pay attention to heat, not realise a module is on/off/ out of range. Shit like that is what decides who wins and having a sound for something overheating takes one of those things away (although it will distract them from other things)
---
eve has sound?
---
vvvvvvvvv shit im typing in the wrong window
---
Warp on the structure and not at 350km and start bashing.
---
Speaking of which, how much time did it take you to reach 500?
---
You really are a cynic, John.
---
It's not a real war, and I'm as grr gons as anyone.

But these are still beautiful pics. Thanks for making them.

Who's John?

The launcher itself is a 32-bit application.  If you go to the launcher settings menu, under the E in the upper right, choose Settings... and look for a checkbox that says "Run clients with 64 bit."  Make sure that's checked and click OK.
---
From then on, you should be running the 64-bit client.

This isn't even a fight. This is just more risk-averse null games.

KK 
---
thanks!
---
Exactly this. I started having way more fun when I stopped caring. Buy a shit load of cheap ships when you have the isk and learn how to fly dangerous. Your killboard will look shit for ages, but you'll get the hang of things.
---
That was bad.
---
I'd debate point 3. The biggest price to me is the corpse. I will ALWAYS go to pick up a corpse before loot. It's my hobby.
---
Did NC lose another keepstar?
---
Yeah it does. Right now more and more games are getting to the point where they will max out 8GB if you have a browser open on the side. Two eve clients and a web browser will crack 8GB when there is a lot going on. There are other games besides eve that are beginning to struggle with only 8GB of ram. The problem usually isn't the game but the game running alongside a bunch of other processes that all eat up RAM.
---
I'm not saying 16GB of ram will suddenly solve all your problems and give you 600 FPS, that's not its job but it will cause things to go smoother overall.
---
All my chars are in +5. When i logi, i switch to clean clone (or some other specialized one), and before i log out i switch back into +5.

Most people in alliances I have been to do the same. There really isn't a good reason not to.

When you warp to a mining site but someone already warped in

---
Just watch out for people stabbing you in the back, big problem on some horde fleets.
---
If you want to make ISK than look into incurrsions. You need alpha account and you can make 30mil every 15minutes.
---
Use faction drones as they're typically better for PvP. Only lose a very minor amount of dps but faction drones have more ehp and various other better stats over T2 drones.
---

This is awful. Jesus christ.
---
Most of these "players" are alts.  
---
I also think your post confusing, either you are active (which means you are logged in) or you are not (which means you are only logged in to reddit).  
---
Sure, there are many people out there who only log in for fleets or events.  
---
I think most of them are not logging in for more, because they simply have something else to do (family, work, etc.).  
---
These players will not suddenly log in, no matter what you do.  
---
The second group is players that usually have been out in space for years and are now playing other games. They log in for fleets or events, because of the experience, but don't participate in the everyday grind between them (I know many people in this category).  
---
The third category are players who are waiting for EVE to change in a way that fits their play style. No amount of pings or events will bring those back, but they are out there, watching and waiting....
---
There should really be a way to "compress" multiple T2 BPCs into one with the combined number of runs. Would also make building smaller T2 stuff more fun since you wouldn't need to login every two hours to start new jobs.
---
change your modules shortcut have more easy ones, EG qwer
---
there was a suggestion on the official forum, but seems nobody actually cares.
---
DONG
---
Yes, actual new players have access to billion of isk within a week of signing up, so long as they bother to research isk-making. You're right, a lot of newbies go straight into mining or VNI ratting, but that's because they are given bad advice and they don't bother too look up stuff. VNIs are shit isk on a small scale. Only once you have a number of them do they start to make sense. One account? An Apocalypse with newbie skills will basically do better, cost about the same, and develop a more valuable set of skills. 
---
I don't need to siphon a single bit of isk to a new account. I barely need to buy a couple skillbooks and go for a stroll through lowsec. There's a ton of isk to be made in EVE.
---
Just adapt bro
---
ECM breaks all targets except the lock on the person doing the target breaking. That turns the "blind" into a "taunt" mechanic, but the ships are still tanked like their hulls are wet tissue paper.
---
Totally agree the should stop the lp mission and up the complex lp so we will have more people on space in complex :)
---
Yes, this, PushX would have my vote though. OP, do NOT use a JF if you are not 100% sure what you're doing, otherwise you are sure to end up on zkb. You are smart enough to ask before doing; be smart enough to just move it via pushx setting a fair collateral

shit in local too
---
As /u/keikira mentioned that doesn't only kill botters. It kills semi-AFK players too. You might not agree with that playstyle but as a way to make ISK during the week to PVP on the weekend I feel it has a place.
---
When u pay for it, then you can complain about it
---
Unless it’s been edited he never mentioned heavy drones before my comment. He just said you can rat pre-aligned and fit and mjd. All of which is correct, you can do it with a sentry Domi. He didn’t say it would be easier to catch botting domis and they should be pre-aligned to a station or citadel anyway so....?
---
Runs to jita/amarr were the most nerve-wrecking things ever.  
---
"Everyone can see me, everyone knows I'm here.. This is wrong"
---
Wormhole life is clearly made for the paranoid and introverted types, pretty fitting I would say.
---
As an alpha 442 DPS with alpha max skill and no pimp fit (4 DDA t2, amarr drone)
---
As a omega it s 712 DPS with perfect skill with same fit.
---
442 DPS give me 10M ticks
---
712 DPS give me around 15M.
---
Please educate us in your glorious ways of determining if something is an AFK VNI ratter and a VNI bot?
---
mind you don't cut yourself on that edge
---
i have a pvp fit around 1000 DPS so if you do the same for ratting in kinetic weak mob, it can be good yes ;)
---
It just reset the arc :)
---
Very much so, and even if you didn't display any of these tell-tale signs of a wormholer, if you ever tried living elsewhere in new eden it alwals feels exposed.
---
HTP runs away, smugposts on reddit about it.

Seems about right :D

very much yes

my soul died reading this

&gt;2\] What is a DSCAN and why can't my Algos not do it ?
---
Every ship has a directional scanner fitted as standard. To use it, click the "Scanners" icon on the left of your health meters and select "Directional Scanner". Use it as you see fit. [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Directional\_scanning](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Directional_scanning)
---
&gt;Most questions I have googled but the first one is still a concern as I feel like a brick in a fleet action.
---
Don't worry, most fleets come down to just anchoring on your anchor (using Keep At Range 1000-2500m from the designated fleet member) and hitting F1 on whomever the FC designates.
---
&gt;wasting ISK on replacement T1's
---
T1 industrials and T1 light ships are pennies to most capsuleers, don't worry. Most corps are going to be happy you're losing them, because every loss is a learning experience.
---
Thanks! I hate it! :)
---
I just quoted CCP word for word so if you want that question answered you should ask them.
---
Man, imagine if goons came up with this for WWB
---
&gt;because nobody gives a fuck
---
Thanks for being honest.
---
&gt;it's a subscription game, so subscribe.
---
Not according to CCP.
---
1) Watch youtube videos of solo PVPers, that's manual piloting. You don't need it in fleet combat, as you are only expecter to push aproach (to your anchor) and F1 when told.
---
2) Directional Scanner. It opens with the map and the probe scanner, deatach it from there and leave it in a place you find comfortable. Most valuable tool ever.
---
Extra: they are handing Frigates, not Freighters.
---
Extra2: Either you are bad at looking/asking for info or Horde is slacking really hard.
---
You're wrong.
---
 https://youtu.be/Ke3ROIFB3Ms manual piloting part 1. You tube should bring up part 2 automatically.
---
https://youtu.be/tSiMqNOuSX4 dscan tutorial

The videos are good. Finding a corp with people who actually use the manual piloting techniques and know other related mechanics is even better.
---
There is a whole world in eve outside of F1 pvp. This is just the tip of the iceberg.
---
Pirat gonna have to adapt to wardeccing nothing but null blocs
---
Wait they're fine with that nevermind
---
And if I say I'm a woman, it doesn't make me a woman.
---
It's a subscription game, it has been for about 16 years.
---
&gt; New players decide if the game is right for them very quickly, then either leave or subscribe rather than playing as an Alpha long term. Of course, more Omegas is fantastic but [we think many of the players who leave might be willing to stay around if subscription didn’t feel like a requirement.](https://www.eveonline.com/article/clone-states-the-next-steps)
---
Your pics are hands down the best, as always. 
---
Also, it says a lot about the game that the most spectacular shots going right now are of an uncontested structure bash.
---
And lest anyone accuse me of being salty, it was every bit as broken when we did it to everyone else as it is now. We need conflict drivers back in the game!
---
how do you turn on this 64b client ? because i checked it in the clinet settings menu , and it still shows as running on 32b???
---
I hope you get a planet named after you(r character)
---
If this was a subscription game then you'd have to pay $$ to log in which isn't true. Even in dev vlogs they said they expected the meta to change as as Capsuleers new and old create alpha clones to impact New eden.
---
they did, and reactions were the same as now, we all the same lemming herd
---
Precursor ships seem to be all of the rage these days. I'm honestly not super sure, I mostly play total war: warhammer II these days.

No, just no

IF anything the number of ppl leaving changed probably.. maybe .. With such a low number even the slightest changes to the game that make the small group of ppl leave can actually be pretty dire.

Wow is also f2p, then.

irrelevant, you need at least 5.5mil SP to extract and an Alpha is capped at 5mil SP...

Not if you trained some SP while temporarily omega. Or you use alpha injectors.

Thank god it was just "vvvvvvv" you typed in local not "www.xxx-movies.com" .....
---
It's the exact same thing.
---
Trial has no time limit, and access to content is limited by a paid barrier.
---
In eve's case it's skill levels, in wow's case it's character level.
---
It's literally the same model for both subscription games.
---
I'm one of them. Because i am bored, and looking for content takes time, that i prefer to enjoy IRL.  
---
And because we're at war, so krabbing will wait.
---
Nice. Any idea when the final timer will be?
---
So, reasons having nothing to do with what area of space candidates has expertise in or what kind of gameplay they actually participate in, I see.
---
I never feel alone, 'cause I have my alts to keep me company. I do have issues when I see neutral faction battleships in high sec... muuuust...  tackle...
---
Just the armor timer for their abandoned ship spinning deployment.
---
Well, you can't fully inhabit shattered wormholes, they (as well as wormholes in general) have different limits in place, they live by different rules, including no local and no consistent traveling routes. Those are kind of a big deal for nullsec and even roamer/whaler/whatever types.
---
I'd say it's hardly an idea which steps on shattered space toes.
---
(Noob question) If a planet is used by multiple people for PI/PP. Is the yield per player smaller?
---
because hunting bots is so much fun right? completely comparable to fighting real players right?

That's just not true. We were just trading better.

&gt;Don't use a JF. You're going to die.
---
I agree that it's probably not a good trip for a first-time JF pilot, but I'd like to point out that unless something unpredictable happens like a disconnect or a power outage a JF *who knows what he's doing* is 100% safe, no matter who's camping the station.
---
When Goons/Null blocs learn to put the games health over goons winning we can do that, but they never have, and never will. You 100% know that even if goons had the best representatives from each area of space, they would still advocate for whatever change made goons win the most, even if it fucked the game. To believe anything else makes you incredibly stupid and naive.
---
First off: don't be ashamed of being new. Lacking knowledge about things is perfectly normal in the beginning and it is a rather slow process. For your first question, a video from 2017 is still quite valid for the most part. While minor fitting and balance changes have occured over the last couple of years, 2017 still works quite well. The general principal in PvP and PvE are still pretty much the same.
---
Don't feel stupid about asking questions to your Corpies- it is normal to have a lot of questions in EVE as it is very complex game with a lot of mechanics, especially when you are in a Newbro friendly Corp! Many players in EVE try to connect with new players and explain even very basic things.
---
Regarding 1), if you are still quite new to EVE manual piloting is something that comes with time, and nothing you have to be concerned about in the very beginning. It requires a great amount of IRL skill &amp; decision making ability to act right in every situation. Try just orbiting the target with the tools EVE gives you, learn to manage your modules; tank, damage, heat, etc. and slowly work towards manual decisions in your ships piloting. A lot of things will make more sense the longer you play, exactly things like velocity, transversal, appliction and so on, but they shouldn't matter to you much in the beginning.
---
Regaring 2)
---
Im just busting your balls :) I bet it looks awesome though, crazy to think about though for sure.
---
But remember how removing nullification for combat ceptors totally fixed null sec?
---
Yeah no, if the station's being camped there's no way in hell you should light a cyno on said station and jump to it unless you want to find your JF appearing at the sun.   I don't care how skilled you are.   The only way around this it to tank the hell out of your cyno ship and hope it lives long enough.
---
he actually believes it too.
---
lmao how do you get this mad from one person in a game
---
This actually doesn't matter at all. Once you click jump in a cap or JF, you land at that cyno even if it dies mid-jump.
---
Landing at the sun ONLY applies to taking a bridge and not to jumping a ship.
---
Therefore you can undock, use station invuln to get into position, have your JF ready to go, and light/jump in the span of time it would take for them to lock and pop even a corvette. You'll still be fine.
---
JFs don't appear at the sun.
---
That "mechanic" only happens to ships going through titan/blops bridges, not to caps that use their own jump drive.
---
You'll either end up next to the dead cyno ship or get a message that the cyno is no longer available.
---
Can confirm, I have seen this done successfully only a few times, and most of them the JF lands just as the cyno ship goes pop, or the trip was made during the camper's off times/just after DT
---
In lowsec, yes. 100%. On an npc null station, you can get the undock bubbled and you might be hard screwed if it's a kickout.
---
swore I saw him in a video, i guess i'm tripping
---
How brave of you to speak up now.
---
well, you have to deny structures anyway ( allowing them allows local ship construction ).
---
I mean your simulating the lack of constant travel routes in your own idea. 
---
the only real difference is adding local and making you scan a tiny bit less. 
---
Living there would be like living in a C-13 with local really and given people are not standing in line for c-13 live right now it seems well there might not be as many people moving there as you picture an especially if going afk for a couple of weeks could mean the system is gone.
---
Let me tell you about pre-anomaly days and belt ratting
---
How to tell a difference between a static and a wandering wormhole?
---
This is why I prewarp all gas and ore sites in someone's hole if I don't care for them.
---
inb4 new VNI ends up being even better than the old one because there's this anom X that everyone forgot about and hasn't been nerfed by CCP since it wasn't viable before because of too many frigs but now becomes super viable since tracking bonus too stronk.
---
please no. how much casual this game should become?
---
Thanks for the info.   
---
Please don't blame my corp. They are very helpful. I am sure the issue is with me.   
---
I fly a frigate like a freighter LOL
---
Congrats on joining the block least hostile to Snuffed Out in the strategic sense.
---
not enough americans on the csm for this to happen
---
Recently happened to me as well. What I did was fly in in an interceptor (fit with probe launcher). Create instadock and off grid undock bookmarks for the station. Scanned the system once a day until a WH opened up to HS. Flew in a blockade runner to get expensive stuff out through the WH. Came back and someone else was selling an Orca firesale for 200 mil under Jita. Bought that and packed up the rest of my junk and flew it out. Then finally jumped in with a Bowhead and got all my fit ships. I could've contracted it but it seemed like a fun challenge and I was bored.
---
Thank you 
---
I will watch those vids.
---
That's what they attempted in "community" fits. Where they give players fit examples. But I haven't heard anything about that for months now...
---
You mean in the game where almost every third-party tool runs in a browser? The game which is built on communities that have their long term communications in forums on the internet? The game where people regularly send links with useful information (or dumb memes) to each other?
---
You do you, then.
---
Look up your system on something like [anoikis](http://anoik.is/), if the wormhole type is the same as the static type, that is most likely your static connection, otherwise it is a wandering connection.
---
If you find it link plz. I would want to see also.
---
Nobody speaks up when the breakage benefits them, I'll be the first to admit it. We didn't do it in WWB, Goons aren't doing it now. Doesn't change the fact that conflict drivers are being slowly but surely removed from the game and there are less and less reasons to fight regardless of who you are.
---
&gt;He's a good CSM member.
---
Lmao, good one mate.
---
o7, thanks for the suggestion. So I've found a C2 with HS/C3 Statics. Was wondering what sort of things I should be checking before moving in? I've looked on zKill, not much activity. There is one structure owned by a 3 man corp, not very active either. Looks like a good home for my untrained eyes, maybe I'm missing something?
---
Such sweaty on the Thames.
---
Maybe, but only because if the time basis.
---
Without them it would just be different skills.
---
But drones aren't really a primary weapon system.
---
A little detail, trig stuff is not quite high end pve. You can run T1 and T2 pretty easily as an alpha. Starting at T3, you start needing pretty good skills, but nothing crazy. You do need a ship worth a couple 100s of mil, so it's not the cheapest thing to buy and run. I'm pretty sure you could've run them as an alpha, but since they're going to remove the ability to use T2 medium drones for alphas, you're probably not going to be able to run them anymore.
---
If you're an omega, even T4 and T5 don't really need that many skills (just good overall skills for things like shields, drones, armor, etc, but nothing crazy), but they do require a pretty expensive ship.
---
Thank you.   
---
My questions and such stem from flying in 0.0 sec. Gate camps and NPC's are rather abundant and every time I get gate camped and have to ask for a new ship I feel that I should have learned something or done something different like not fly on autopilot.
---
Use transport ships with instant undocks and cloaks.
---
Imagine if Alphas weren't able to:
---
* Join a corporation
---
* Talk in local
---
* Leave Hisec
---
* Form or join a fleet
---
* Do abyssal sites
---
* Have more than 10 million ISK in your wallet
---
* Fly anything other than a Corvette or Shuttle
---
* Attack Omega accounts
---
* Talk to Omega accounts
---
Because these are the restrictions that WoW imposes on their Starter Edition which is a glorified demo. Alphas clones are very very far from the position free wow players are in.
---
Just take a look at what one of the restrictions are.
---
&gt; Characters that are ten or more levels higher than you will not see your /say messages
---
In wow, a starter character basically doesn't even exist.
---
In Eve, Alphas can create corporations, wage war, fight in fleets, actually deal damage to other players, trade with people, scam people, and much more. They're a part of the community and you seem to think that alienating them is fine and that their existence is meaningless when even CCP themselves say the exact opposite.
---
Prostitution is lucrative. Even in space. Maybe especially in space, where noone can hear you cream.
---
That website is awesome thanks.
---
Agreed. Fucking sheep give this advice to everyone then bitch about the blue donut in the next thread.
---
And default task manager doesn't even compute the right sum over (Chrome's) multiple processes, AFAIK. It just sums working sets (physical RAM taken), while real Commit Charge* will almost certainly be larger. Though you can't simply sum Commit charges, since some parts of them could be shared between processes.
---
\* - Process Explorer term, amount of memory Committed from the global system commit limit.
---
0.0 is a difficult place to learn slowly, but you shuld not give up!
---
Getting camped because of the use of Autopilot is easily prevented by just not using Autopilot :), easiest way is to just press the jump button the yellow marked gates! It is one mere click per system but provides much faster travleing &amp; safety. Give it a shot!
---
T1 ships, especially fit with t1 modules are super duper cheap.
---
Just get insurance on all of them and go learn.
---
They die, you get paid, your Corp gives you a new ship.
---
Make a personal business out of insurance fraud.
---
You can apply to NASA now
---
Me, an Asshole: Always initiating warp to gas sites as I'm scanning. I like to keep my fellow wormholers on their toes.
---
Wormholes are fun, even if you only have one account and are relatively poor.
---
Doing them solo can be very difficult, I would recommend joining a corp and getting into them that way. Also don't be afraid of the krab, it's important to keep the isk flowing so you can fly blingy ships
---
Halve the ticks from anomalies, buff the ESS to compensate.  That'll be a huge boost to small gang and roaming.
---
You clearly never trade or do more than one activity with different needs.
---
you this mad about olmeca getting elected?

---
Faction warfare is a place for pvp pilots to really flex small gang/solo skills in a non hotdrop enviroment. You still get micro blobs of 20/40 guys once in a while but honestly I think it's the best place for small gang.
---
That said it needs a lot of changes, counterplay to missions, no stabbed or venture plexing, suspect timers for plex combat, and a little more spotlight
---
So many space thousandaires in one shot.
---
Then they should just pay for the game if they are going to bitch about it.  A majority of them mainly do explo anyway.
---
Guilty!  Bitter old vet hanging out in my hobby looking for the elusive gf
---
So they are both subscription games with unlimited trials where content is gated behind a subscription.
---
you are required by law to forget that phrase after you turn fourteen  
---
turn in your posting licence
---
there's a difference between increasing starting SP and making it easy to EARN starting SP, since one is "engaging" and the other one goes entirely unrealized by the player
---
Are you fighting in groups or solo?
---
I spent a lot of time soloing in FW space and I thought plex mechanics are horribly mundane.  There is literally nothing exciting or dynamic about them -- it's the eve equivalent of queuing for a 1vs1 duel arena.  
---
Sure, it's not quite as simple as this, but mostly you're just sat in a plex or jumping from system to system until a fair fight presents itself.
---
I found it incredibly disappointing that, in a rich, dynamic, open-world sandbox, the most effective way to find a decent fight is in these little arenas.  It's really not what I was after when I signed up..
---
Look ma, I'm in the photo!
---
10/10 day. Will attend again.
---
World's most expensive fish and chips though.
---
Contact me in game and I will tell you how and even help you.   Dracvlad
---
BR 1 tho o.0
---
Seems like a great idea!
---
IKR? £12 for something I can get at my local for about £5 tops.
---
You could have used that power for great evil, methinks.
---
Ew.
---
Oh, you sad little kid, can't even understand other people enjoy different things.
---
Actually annoyed that majority of votes are coming from alts.      
---
Aka you have an "elected body" but your number of votes is equal to how much omega accounts you are running.
---
It was £14, before you added mushy peas.
---
Ouch.
---
Improvise.
---
Adapt.
---
Overcome.
---
And we did it all without having to drink our own piss.
---
Where are you and what do you fly? I'll help you out and bring the PvP right yo you :)
---
Just contract it to someone for a fair price, he'll hop in, undock, you light the cyno and he jumps and docks at the new station, contracting it back for the same price. Plus an agreed service fee.
---
Can't get scammed that way. If he keeps the ship it's just like he bought it.
---
Don't leave it in space for anyone to board.
---
I'll help, if I can.
---
Did you not even read the dev blog I linked? Alphas are not trials.
---
&gt; Being an Alpha is often described more like an infinite trial period than a true free experience ... That’s where the new skill list comes in. By expanding the amount of skills available to Alphas, the free experience will be much deeper and more powerful. We hope that with a stronger free experience, we see more players staying around to play as Alphas
---
This is an interesting take - I'm leaning towards just making a courier contract since it's the asset safety for one of the major alliances and it's heavily camped.
---
If I do end up moving a few select items out myself I'll probably do this way though, thanks
---

Who's wearing the exact same Fatbee t-shirt in all three photos?
---
Damn nice pictures.
---
Eve is so beautifull :'-)
---
Oh look, the marketing and PR bullshit I mentioned earlier.
---
You are correct. I agree it would be difficult for you to imagine anything.
---
Ticket's delay is directly conected to how difficult the issue is to solve, losing a ship because of a server side error and payment related stuff usually gets answered quickly, but things like bans, scamms, stolen accounts and such take much longer.
---
The config and overviews were wiped as a result of signing up to the beta version of the launcher, not the 64bit option.
---
It's a standard option on the normal launcher now, and it's not wiped my overviews at all thus far, and I've had it on since it came out
---
Yeah this, I recently put a ticket for launcher and login issues I had a response within an hour with a solution
---
No Kendarr in the picture ? 
---
Feelsbadman
---
no im not in nc, im not even subscriped to this game since months before this war started

I'm pretty sure at least one of them killed me in my journey in eve

Yeah.... for a minute, until anyone smarter than a robot programs the bot to be able to do simple, on screen prompts.

Nice spin. It's almost impressive that you managed to fit a version of: *"didn't want that ihub anyway"*, *"made you form!"* and *"dirty blobbers!"* all into one post. - Linking to old cherry-picked BRs and unrelated super kills took it a bit over the top tho. Quite cringe worthy.
---
Meanwhile, however, Provi-Bloc support staff is busy utilizing the massive amounts of local salt you dropped on us to preserve our meat reserves. They're estimating we'll be set for a couple of decades.
---
Tuppenny.

as in two pence.
---
Lol so no
---
Hello pax
---
how difficult is it to learn/access the mini-meta? i tried FW before, but gave up because it was difficult to get into the 'clubs' to access information.
---
I would have had the halloumi, that was 12
---
Tbf, he was the one taking the picture
---
You don't have to access all the content for a game to be free to play. What are you even saying?
---
Argue all you want or don't. Nobody seems to care about bringing players into this game anyway. Everyone including yourself is on some high horse thinking Alphas shouldn't even exist. Awful thinking.
---
Pictures like this make me question if I want to be playing this game.
---
The Hydra and the Tiamat?
---
as a wormholer I occasionally attempt to d-scan while docked ... in different games.
---
that would be me.
---
The diversity is mind blowing
---
Bombers bar is actually doing mostly stukas atm, but even stukas wont be able to brawl 50+ caps and a subcap fleet. You can stay on field longer but you wont be able to brawl the enemy. In the end the nullblob always wins because its their home and they can jump in stuff and reship endlessly. You can then decide to leave and cut losses or to stay on field and brawl without any chance, wasting the individual fleet members isk for no reason.
---
I'm telling ya man, theres something in the food and water here in the US. A bunch of goons and no wildly obese ones?
---
No but they're still a secondary medium weapons system.
---
Gal: Hybrid/Drones
---
Cal: Hybrid/Missiles
---
Amarr: Lasers/Drones
---
Minmatar: Projectile/Missles
---
see, no one cares
---
Great picture!
---
Just ask there no stupid questions.
---
That what a person who brings a 200 million frigate to fight T1s would say. I haven't had a single balanced fight in FW. Either the other brings a extremely strong frigate or that person is a bait for the rest of the fleet to warp in.
---
they keep alfius in london with exact that pose and clothing to safe travel costs
---
Woah, well done! If science were a person, I'm sure you'd be it.
---
That one guy awfully looks like Jintaan. Jintaan part of NWO confirmed
---
You sir, nailed it.
---
I've made Billions doing Project Discovery, but it's much slower isk/hr than almost anything else in EVE
---
10/10? So it was an escalation... Any good drop?
---
That was not the intention by CCP and the article linked for you states that CCP increased the skills available to make it viable long term and not feel like a trial. You can't do everything as an Alpha, but that's the same as any F2P game. 
---
Eve is a F2P game with a subscription model now. Sorry to burst your bubble, but Eve is F2P.
---
You're still powerful as Alpha.
---
Now you have to actually play the game and be active.
---
It's holding up well. Do you wear your colors year-round or only for special occasions?
---
I'd be fine with that. My hope is that we as a community find a couple dozen planets and we get naming rights. That said I can see it now, Planet Jita, Planet Test, Planet Goons....
---
Yet nobody is on message boards and forums whining about how much skill training they're losing by having to swap out of them.
---
Now that is VERY interesting.   I wonder if the difference is accidental or intentional.
---
\#dreamjob.
---
TAPI must feel like they owe CVA after they took all their faction forties!
---
How nice of them to give something back to their allies.
---
He doesn't make me mad though lol.
---
"TUTORIAL AREA" somewhere constantly on the screen.
---
this sounds pretty salty.  
---
show me on the rifter where the bad man touched you.
---
Thank You Good Sir. I really enjoy doing Project Discovery just because I know I'm helping to find actual planets.
---
Sure, explains all your comments about him
---
According to Olmeca, most of the players in Delve are also bots.
---
Yeah, large plexes are my favourite.
---
... because they are surrounded by blues on all sides?
---
it's a part of my standard t-shirt rotation.
---
Eep, yeah, that didn't come out right lol.
---
I did actually upgrade my graphics card about 8 months ago, not because I needed too, but there was a good sale going on. My "old" graphics card is up and running on another PC.
---
Too few Americans. Check out the photos from Eve North. We are truly a race of giants.
---
No, not even close.
---
he's the photographer until he rejoins an Imperium alliance :P
---
&gt;... because they are surrounded by blues on all sides?
---
And they can be surrounded by neutrals by all sides.  The daily aggression and current war between TEST and WinterCo, living side by side each other, is an example.
---
I've actually done Project Discovery in Abyssal sites....
---
Think this is pl/nc current model with pH becoming the new overload.
---
I think that's the only actual sentence where you made sense.
---
No.
---
That would make it bit too easy. You could overheat everything in each fight and not worry about it.
---
What were you expecting?
---
An opportunity to use stink bombs, eggs and milk has been missed. :(
---
They've already increased base sp a few years ago. I don't think that's the problem. A new player doesn't see the difference of he gets 400k sp or 500 at the start. He will only really see what he gains and couldn't do when he started. So increasing training speed might be a positive thing.
---
But ccp have improved new player experience alot in the last few years. The tutorial used to be absolutel garbage. It would be interesting on how the player retention changed in all those years and if better tutorials/more free stuff/etc. actually improved it.
---
most likely sugar
---
Indeed.
---
Seriously, I have fond memories of all this.
---
Its gotta be something...
---
Lol
---
I’ve got 128, which is severely overkill for gaming, and I rarely see above 16gigs being used. I’d probably upgrade if I were you, but wouldn’t go crazy. It’s possible we see DDR5 hit shelves in the next year or two, and that’s when I’d upgrade to 32/64
---
&gt;surely there must be haulers that specialise in moving asset safety to jita?
---
There are. As someone who's active in the haulers channel, contracts like these pop up sometime and are typically in need of an (experienced!) jump freighter pilot. One name that comes to mind is galactic hauling solutions inc. - they have a set price and can get the job done for you.
---
Hauling it yourself *is* possible but if the station is camped and you have no experience, probably better not to try unless you're willing to spend a lot of time reading up and hauling to non-camped stations beforehand.
---
\~3000 losses here o7
---
Any particular reason you cannot say the same about audio notifications? Audio notification + press of 1 button is basically same thing I am suggesting.
---
It was very different in the beginning. You didn't have the game telling you to slow down all the time and there was no daily limit. If you make a point to do 5 levels a day you'll have it done in a few months. Honestly I spent way more time on it than any sane person should, I could probably figure it out if I go back and check the dates of the screen shots I took of each 100 level increment.
---
That's even less sustainable for a game whose playerbase, at best, stagnant.
---
Damn, mine lags on 16GB with 6 clients open.
---
The devs will be dying of laughter if they didn't touch the graphics and everyone is deluding themselves that it is better because of a coincidental +5 FPS ;D
---
This is flawed thinking and I see it in other similar games as well.
---
Ultra niche/specialised games don't work this way. This isn't a generic battle royal game that are a dime a dozen. There is only 1 Eve online, there is nothing even remotely similar. If/when eve dies, the concept of Eve will most likely stay dead or lay dormant for many years.
---
I see a \*similar\* argument ("this game just needs to die so a better dev studio will pick up the liscense") in other games and that's just not how it works with these kinds of games.
---
That said I'm sure the more nihilistic people out there don't care. Burn it all down, salt the earth, scorched earth. It needs to die and stay dead because I'm bored and no one else should enjoy something I no longer enjoy. I'll move on to the next niche game and advocate for the same thing. Niche game because there is no point in killing a generic BR or Moba game because nothing of value is lost. if a game like eve is lost then something much more unique will be lost and there is a certain sense of accomplishment in that. Makes one feel special being part of the reason why something unique is forever lost. Like making a species extinct.
---
\&gt; They make no logical sense as a concept(submarines don't launch smaller submarines to attack ships)
---
In any computer game there will always be a balance between realism and game mechanics. And who's to say that ships of the future wouldn't have semi-autonomous agents? Drones are used IRL in civil and military activities more each year, and these will pale into insignifnance compared to what will be used in 20-30 years time.
---
\&gt; They have no fitting requirements, use no cap, use no ammo
---
There is Drone Bandwidth and Drone Bay Capacity. And the all important fitting slots (low, medium or utility high) that will improve drone effectiveness if the pilot opts to sacrifice slots. And drones may not \_use\_ ammo, but rather like your ship, they \_are\_ ammo.  And fighters, being somewhat different to regular drones, \_do\_ use ammo and must be refuelled if you want them to be most effective.
---
\&gt; They pretty much completely ignore EWAR
---
Drones and fighters can be jammed. For example, it's common practice in PVP fleets to bring a jammer or two to incapacitate a Rattlesnake.
---
\&gt; They are the only weapon system that has all three sizes simultaneously - a large turret fit Battleship will have trouble hitting smaller ships, but droneboats can simply launch smaller drones and remain just as effective
---
Except that unless it's a dedicated droneboat BS (Dominix, specifically), drones of a different size will be unbonused and will thus have limited efficacy. Likewise, many ship types are only bonused to drones of specific sizes.   
---
\&gt; Sentry drones lmao what is this I don't even
---
Sentry drones are highly effective in certain classes of PVE e.g. clearing C3 wormhole sites with remote repping sentry Domis. And in certain classes of PVP fleet doctrine, e.g. kiting Ishtars with a wall of  sentries is very nasty.
---
\&gt; Auto-aggro and assigning drones are beyond broken
---
Just because a feature in any product contains bugs doesn't mean it shouldn't exist.
---
\&gt; They have unknown, but likely *gigantic* impact on game performance, since they basically multiply the amount of "ships" in any battle by 3-5x
---
CCP's engineers and performance testers are likely to be very aware of incremental effect on performance as the number of game objects on-grid increases - it's their job to measure and understand these things.  And when the grid is extremely busy (large scale fleet engagements), Turrets \_and\_ Smartbombs have a significant impact on TiDi. For instance, when griding down citadels and sov structures, it's usually fine while the Supers let their fighter bombers do the meat of the work,  then when all the subcaps start shooting to whore, everything slows down.
---
A big problem too is single core performance. Ironically a lot of higher end machines use beefy multi core processors, which can struggle in applications like eve due to it being single core. 
---
For example, my machine gets 4-5fps when it’s a 3K person fight. Potato or not. I have a i9 9900K and I’ll sit at basically 100% usage on one core, and the rest are basically idle.
---
XD
---
Should have crossed the river, there's a great chippy about 5 minutes walk from Waterloo.
---
Quickest solution that I desire:
---
Zoomed all the way out? Can't really see the ship models and textures anyway? Turn them into simple elongated pyramids of different sizes.
---
I don't think alphas shouldn't exist.
---
I'm stillng you in a subscription game we don't give much of a shit about trial accounts
---
can you check a corp tax rate without being its member? or even better, is there a way to do it outside of the game?
---
sell it! I'm sure someone will want it.
---
So then the point has nothing at all to do with the skills in question?
---
I love how the biggest nullblock is so triggered by one person getting on the CSM.
---
Still means nothing.
---
Of you shelter people from mechanics, they'll just be confused when those mechanics appear, even if one is a tutorial
---
You forgot about the part where Sort sucked major goon dick to try and get on their CSM ballot so he could elected but failed.
---
Dead Coalition in name and Dead Coalition in Influence.
---
Im crushed! &lt;/3
---
I understand what you’re saying. I’m thinking of giving the guy who did it the satisfaction of your tears. And to not do that.
---
We’re not disagreeing on corpse collection. I have advocated, at Fanfest, for a dedicated ship in which corpses could be collected that could then be sold, in a black market type situation, to the Sleepers \[which some of our number thought was a *ewwwwwww* idea :-)\].
---
I have at that same time advocated for a module to extract head metal from corpses such that it could be reused / sold on the market.
---
growth hormones in the meat.
---
That looks like an amazing time!
---
What the combined titan count?
---
see: axolotl
---
Isn't Sort history to basically be who ever is powerful's bitch to survive ?
---
You dont want to get connected to normal looking people?
---
&gt; well, you have to deny structures anyway ( allowing them allows local ship construction ).
---
Or you can come up with some other excuse to stop large ships from being undocked tbh. Or apply some other limiting factor slowing creation of bulky assets down at first. This is going to be arbitrary, probably, but denial of structures will indeed put these systems into the same place where shattered wormholes currently are.
---
&gt; I mean your simulating the lack of constant travel routes in your own idea.
---
In my opinion there's a difference between living in a bubble that connects to random systems every several hours and basically a nullsec region that has a constant topology until it effectively disappears in like 1-2 years.
---
I should stress it that we are talking those periods of time and not some couple of weeks. The entire point is to simulate a process of people gradually settling down, going through some kind of a political process and moving out by the time it would become yet another established nullsec region.
---
As for stuff going "poof", well. We have all kinds of ways to handle the situation, from applying asset safety to waiting until region reopens to deciding that there are already regions for people who would rather live in classical null.
---
Supercapital botting and Rorqual Mining Fleets... Thanks to SP Injectors and these you won't get any deflation anytime soon. The only thing it will happen after VNI revamp, people will begin to use Dominixes, their income per hour will decrease and amount of risk will increase. And supercapitals and rorquals will just stay safe under supercapital umbrella. So capital multiboxers will earn more ISK while subcapital users earn much less... Great balance eh? :)
---
So in time subcap pilots stop subbing &amp; ingame plexing their toons while others just keep multiboxing :) CCP probably know this trade off and decided to go with multiboxers with 10 subbed toons :)
---
It's hardly a minimal amount. 
---
Pro-botter is a silly Hill to die on.

And you are progoats personal army, providing for his stream income that pay his hot-pockets, so where is the point? If you wann have your own army, you would have to put in a lot more effort than into this shitpost ...
---
It should be in the info tab about the Corp under one of the headings. Not sure about checking it out if game though
---
xD
---
Real question is: did you get an auto-reply?
---
I am currently using 17.3 GiB / 62.8 GiB of RAM, have done so for years. Would hate to have to go back to 16GiB or less.
---
You can check the tax rate on [dotlan](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/corp)
---
Found his KBs. He's just a VERY shit pilot. Lost 4 VNIs, 1 1 jump from Horde staging while he was with them. After leaving lost 2 in NPC corp in Lonetrek and Pure Blind. Lost his latest one in Provi two and a half days ago. His other toon lost three Ventures to one person in less than 1 hour. He's currently on his third null-sec alliance in three weeks.
---
You don't always just push v?
---
I love this community
---
You forgot the part that is coming next, right after Goons superfleet goes back to Delve.
---
In really tight situation you might not hear the sound. Or hearing it might make you panic and do mistakes. Or might not have time to turn overheat off if busy pressing other buttons. Making it automatic would be too easy.
---
I'd make them all sleep like in the transport ship in 5th Element.  Much fewer m3 per person
---
Just don't make it a "must be on" feature for whoever doesn't want more sounds.
---
There is no question too stupid for the newbeans channel so ask anything and everything. You obviously want to learn and NBI people will like that attitude.
---
As for wasting money on T1 frigs, if you can learn something out of the loss its not money wasted, its money well spent. 
---
Some one has already linked some Chessur videos, those are good, also check out some of the solo pvp people on streaming sites.
---
Or they could just roll the dice and the whiney bitches can HTFU or quit. My bet is they'll shut up and toe the line. IF they haven't left by now  then they're not going to over some dumb shit like this.
---
Just transfer the Corp out of alliance and blue your Corp with the holding Corp and allow docking rights. Now pirat doesnt exist
---
&gt;that would mean I would have 40-50 hours less for playing EVE every week
---
It's also less time for playing eve the fact that you have to spend like 30 hours ratting with each account. It's 15 usd per month, 50 cents an hour based on the fact that you have to rat for 30 hours per month. Just don't spend those 30 hours ratting, instead find something that pays you more than 50 cents an hour and pay the suscription. You do have to to pvp, you just don't want to and you're trying to find excuses.
---
Now wonder he complains
---
me and the boys being guy being dudes
---
So like I said, your actual view of situation has nothing to do with representing areas and playstyles, like the original idea sounded at first, and everything to do with in-game politics. I get it. Should've just go with it and save everyone's time since that's nothing new or interesting.
---
One last thing, though. Don't forget that regardless of how we vote and what CSM folks have to say, CCP is completely free to do whatever they want. CCP does not need any rules accordingly to which they could tell goon (in this case) representatives to fuck off should they think said representative's advices won't benefit CCP. Since, you know, they can already do so, but apparently they don't agree with "grr gon".
---
I wouldn't call it triggered. The guy is a moron and won't last lol.
---
I guess that explains your replies to me as well then?
---
Go back 5 years and you could mentioned many more wars off the top of your head.
---
Lmao don't even know who you are mate
---
Who is that Terrorist in the middle? Qwanza is dat you?
---
The origin station is the one being camped, not desto station.
---
plex mechanics are good when there's opposition.
---
Not that great when you're there alone waiting for a timer to tick down.
---
Structure bashers are complaining about tediousness, how about try 150+ uncontested button orbits for 10-20 mins to cap 1 system.
---
Who?
---
Fuck man, I really wish I could salvage shit from pods. It's shitty that I can't. 
---
I love the idea though! I've got thousands of corpses. Wish I could sell them.
---
I think sort is trying to forget that part already too.
---
Omega is 15 dollars per month. I don't care if you work at mc donalds, it's still pretty cheap. You end up more stressed by the fact that you can't have what omegas have, that having to do a couple of extra hours per month in order to pay the suscription.
---
When they disabled warp stabbed ships taking gates.
---
But they said it was a bug, so they're not looking to re-adding it.

That was our ballot header yes. People were also told that the order of the first 2 does not matter as long as they put those 2 first. Obviously the excitement for the csm took a little hit within the init family recently so how many actually voted and so on is hard to tell.
---
If your main argument that its fine that goons own CSM is that "well ccp dont have to listen to them anyway" then you are just admitting that goons are making the csm functionally useless. No wonder the game is dying when the players elected to communicate the playerbases wishes to ccp only care about winning the next war. And you defend this practice because apparently thinking the worst corp for eve onlines health in history is bad is just "grr gons". No, my points were meant to be in tandem with mandating 1 representative from each region, they are not mutually exclusive. And infact other than nullsec I doubt goons know much about any other region, every time they try to go to lowsec they get fucking trashed.
---
Judgemental much?
---
Be pirate, shoot them all.
---
Tnx to exploiters, that was heavily nerfed.

Yeah someone in my guild (sorry for using a wow term , not caught up on all the proper terms just yet) sent me 5 mill and they answered a ton of my questions. Seems like for all the drama you read about this game on websites , the people are actually very friendly.
---
@everyone
---
Probably bait but afaik they weren't on the pie-chart of shame so i don't really know why people think they got tons of botters.
---
Huh. Neat.
---
&gt; The TL;DR of this post is that no one should kid themselves. [EVE is no longer](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/aqnz8a/from_sandbox_to_skinnerbox_the_casualization_of/), and has no chance of ever being again, a difficult/tryhard PVP game. The developers don't want it to be and the vast majority of the player base loathes the idea.
---
i just watch overview, non mining ship warps in? warp
---
one day im probably going to be destroyed by bunch of bored players flying ventures fitted with guns
---
With the insurance does it happen automatically ? I paid for it but never saw anything happen when my ship was destroyed.
---
Hahah thanks for the tip ✊🏼🙏🏼
---
I'm already pretty chill, lol.  It's just rather unusual for a character bazaar ticket to go unresponded to for over a week (not even a "we are looking into it"), so wanted to see if it was just me or not :).
---
Going six month over the time I thought I would be in the UK with my family. Want my ugly mug in next years photo for sure.
---
FW missions are bot ridden cancer and definitely need to be nerfed.
---
Too bad all those CSM candidates didn't get elected.
---
I daytrip back to FW regularly. Shamefully, I used to do a lot of stuff for galmil. They have become an embarrassing cesspit of bots and toxicity.
---
Not sure if this is goonswarm propaganda or if you’re being legit. Either way thanks for the information.
---
Is there any summary of the invasion mechanics effects? E.g., differences between stages and foothold/perimeter/adjacent systems, whether or when will the trigs attack structures, etc.
---
Do they roam all the systems (foothold, adjacent, perimeter)? Do they attack people on gates / travelling through the system? Do they also attack pods?
---
Looks like they're renaming stuff and creating a proper executor corp.
---
By regular adaptation and changes this is not an issue.... Introduce a new puzzle daily if need be. 
---
If bots could get around everything then the internet would be a cesspit and you wouldn't even be able to use Reddit.
---
sir, you made me LOL, have your upvote !
---
That's great for small gangs but doesn't change actual conflict generation between entities
---
The other 14 accounts are not on the launcher because he wants to look like a new player.
---
Jintaan was not there
---
tangential, but I always think the missile guidance computer has heat damage from the red bit on the icon
---
We really do try, the game doesn't really offer much on its own, the playerbase had to adapt.  Just like everything else in eve, it's player driven. :)
---
I wish you luck with Horde. Just keep your head down, and if you hear something that sounds like Sieg Heil it probably wasn't. Right?
---
There is a wide spread concensus that Iceland needs fixing.
---
CSM have been kicked from their position in the past and if its early in the term they would get replaced by the next best candidate which would be sort dragon in this case. Other than olmeca i dont see any of the guys getting booted tho but you never know with ccp ofc :S
---
I had that happen once, it was pretty funny when the smartbombers decloaked.
---
@weebs @kilo
---
Welcome to PanFam!
---
Same to you, but here you are, always hitting that reply button sticking up for daddy Olmeca.
---
Hello Anjin!
---
The only thing I can think from that picture is:
---
I wouldnt want to be the guy that bumped at 10k m/s.
---
Good news. FW seems to have gotten a little spicier over the last week with us kicking CALSFs bots out of Frat space and sending them back to being Jackdaw botters in the wz.
---
To expand on this: If you come to Eve with an open mind and a willingness to learn, then despite all its flaws, it's a really rewarding experience. It has a great depth of mechanics and some of the people you'll meet will be friends for life.
---
I've noticed. Enjoying the content. 
---
Still needs to be fixed.
---
I can tell you how many are inside a NC keepstar.
---
Yes, that is how the yeld is calculatrd aside from security status of the system.
---
safety asset doesn't go to nullsec
---
@all
---
Well if your goal is to meet girls, I don't think you should play EVE. Otherwise I don't see any issue not to.

The irony is, that Goons are most often the culprits of these dirty deeds.

That is way more true than the above.  Pathetic Lamers and Never undoCk DOT are Gobbins bitchez and cannot survive without the baked beans !
---
BOOM there goes the nerdhood.  
---
OK who´s mom took the picture?
---
Yeah Gotg krabs in Delve instead and get 200 more Titans to plug into the norths gaping ego hole.
---
out of my 6-7 tickets last year, only one hasnt gotten a reply in the first hour (it took a day), depending on how "stupid" or without ground your ticket is, it might have delayed reply, just remembering custommer support 6-7 years ago gives me the cripes, huge improvement

You just have to meet the right dude, hop on ts with him and he can ease you in if he choses the right words.

---
More the hole in motivation to do dull, repetitive semi-afk-multibox-Mining as only way provided by the Meta to be on that level.
---
Is normal for account related things to be investigated with time attached to it. Sometimes it can be easy peasy other times not so much.
---
Lets say this character sale is being done by someone who hacked someone elses account...now there is a big wrinkle not only is CCP investigating the hack...and the "scam". But they also get to wander down the rabbit hole of the account and see who and where if any assets flowed out to. 
---
More over CCP could be also finding what assets if any should be returned to the account in question.
---
Or maybe...the guy who tried to scam you made up the hack because he got caught in a scam and is now trying to backpedal his way out of a ban.
---
Or maybe GM staff is understaffed on account of it being summer and people in Northern Hemisphere tend to vacation more in summer months than Winter.
---
Best bet is to just follow up with the ticket. There could be a hundred reasons why its taking so long...heck...maybe you are trying to scam bet you didnt think of that did ya!
---
This too....
---
It is.
---
Yeah that’s another great change by someone who doesn’t play or like to cater.
---
Tell that to KillahBee who is publicly shaming pl/nc for not joining fleets and lacking the numbers to fight back the enemy.  Elite pvp pilots stay docked.

Ask in the haulers channel how much isk you should pay normally for your stuff to be transported and increase the offer if you want it faster.
---
Also split your stuff into manageable stacks whenyou create courier contracts. Ask in the same channel aboutnthis
---
What with you getting downvoted? I upvoted to help counter.
---
Sort Dragon is the sole owner of the elusive Tech III Adamantium knee pads.
---
Ecks Dee
---
On top of what others have said, it's also summer in Iceland so there's a lot of vacation time being used and I'm sure CCP is no exception.
---
When I was in Iceland a cab driver said to me that they only get about 2 weeks to a month of good weather so they all tend to get out and enjoy it while they can.
---
I think you missed something about kickstarter/pseudo rmt
---
Interesting Idea. If you have sovereignty of a system why cant you rename the moons? I mean you effectively own them now right?
---
Why couldn’t you just dock? Wound seems self inflicted.
---
Should never had access to T2 mods anyway.
---
Yeah, I know, that's part of what OP is saying needs to change.
---
In my opinion taking plexes should always work as offensive plexing does: you need to kill enemy NPCs until the timer ends, no more sitting there in unfitted ships.
---
Missed out on the best part
---
Hey dude. If you're a newbean (Pandemic Horde member!) reach out to your bros in Horde. They teach this stuff on the regular. Don't feel stupid, trust me - learn. Ask anything. Don't be That Stupid Hordeling who's 4 months in and don't know anything but how to run his injected rorqual and maybe vm box some bots.
---
If you're not in Horde - still ask your corp. This game has a steep learning curve, don't be ashamed to get some help climbing it, even with the very basics. Honestly, the very basics are the hardest part to get your head around.
---
Also don't worry about wasting their isk, bot taxes get you shitloads. Those t1 frigs aren't even worth a minute of all those vni taxes. :)
---
&gt; lacking the numbers to fight back the enemy
---
Attacking with 3:1 in sheer pilot numbers and then complaining enamy lacks numbers. Also being literally patched to victory by CCP (with Lifeblood), as now there is only 1 viable way to be capable financial and in Titan Numbers, and that is dull, repetitive mining, something so thrilling that even you goons afk and partially bot it (TACO/NEAR2). It is clear that 40+ guys like me (Lowsec-Dweller, i hate all of you nullsec scrubs ;-P) with 5-10hrs max a week playing time wont do that torture to themselves and before Lifeblood there was a way of getting income just by being competent in taking and defending towers. Now it is: LOL you didnt inject 5-10 Rorqual Alts and mine multiple hours a week ... get fucked ...
---
&gt; it's a subscription game 
---
Sorry, but Eve is F2P, has been for some time. It has a premium subscription model, but the game itself is F2P with many things locked behind a paywall. It also has an item shop as well. 
---
Stop living in denial
---
From your several comments in this thread it's already obvious that you are seriously retarded; but that aside, do you really think goons are gonna allow GotG to crash in their couch?
---
Ship spinning/being logged off/losing tons of ISK - all are more fun than fighing a sov+structure war these days.
---
No shit eh? I hate it when we roam to black rise and go "ooh, 10 in local, all galmil...it's all pulling bots fuck".
---
It does nowadays. 
---
Eve is also F2P. Get with the times
---
Wow. Does this turn off when eve is running, or does it still attempt to do background rendering and cause more shit?
---
None of that requires 30 tabs on a separate screen.
---
I advocated to have a room in the CQ: one for ‘our fallen brothers’, one for ‘our vanquished foes’.
---
Bwahahaha
---
\&gt; A bunch of goons and ~~no~~ only a few wildly obese ones?
---
irc superiority.
---
Too many
---
If you think this sample resembles wildly obese goons, man have you got it good.
---
Thanks bub
---
Ccp releases like 50 shit worthless items a year and it's too much effort to sell them.
---
They should increase our inventory limit for each useless item they keep releasing
---
No F2P game allows you to access all content without paying some money. What kind of stupid fucking idea would that be? 
---
Let's take a look here:
---
\-Can log in and play without having to pay upfront: Check
---
\-Item Shop: Check
---
\-Able to make purchases to unlock progression beyond standard restrictions without a subscription: Check
---
\-Premium subscription model that allows you unlock all content without restriction: Check
---
Looking like every F2P game I've ever seen
---
What happened to neutral logi in hisec? Do they get concorded now? Or do they just go suspect?
---
This seems simpler.
---
 No F2P game allows you to access all content without paying some money. What kind of stupid fucking idea would that be?
---
Also I miss you when can I expect more videos
---
your wingspan is showing
---
Well personally I dress mine up and have dinner parties. You'd be surprised how witty corpses can be when they're wearing the right hat and monocle.
---
Hey, maybe we are all underestimating Sort's sucking capabilities...
---
Warping to a gate after spending a while in a wormhole.
---
"Oh shitt neutrals on the gate, I'm going to get blapped".
---
What if some base line skills were granted as a specialized injector for completing a set of missions? A la COSMOS arcs?  
---
They would inject a level 5 skill set by CCP for that particular arc? Combat / Mining / Exploration etc
---
But then, can't the same be said about NOT having the sound?
---
Having no sound notification might make you focus too much on heat and do mistakes elsewhere.
---
Having no sound notification might force you to make mistake and burn your modules while you are busy pressing other buttons.
---
That's question of taste but i find it quite easy already. Want to spend less attention to heat - just turn it off early, way before you're in danger. Want to be 100% safe - avoid using it altogether.
---
On the other hand, OP seems to appeal to casuals, and for those automatic would be the best solution as it evens "skillground" between them and people who have better abilities.
---
Or a cloaked dude ready to tackle you.
---
I totally forgot about inventions and BPCs. But that makes it super horrible.
---
He's on his third nullsec alliance in three weeks. Don't expect much from him.
---
So wait, Eve's chat client was more reliable today?
---
It's easy as a new player and there are many newbie friendly corps around.
---
The spreadsheet thing is only needed if you want to get deep i to manufacturing, trading, etc, otherwise you will never need it.
---
Asking questions is never stupid, join us in gem standing on mumble.
---
End reduction value = 1 - (1-40%) \* (1-6%)
---
Tell that to the ships whose primary weapons system bonuses apply to drones and not guns.
---
Part of the reason drones and drone related ships  are constantly under scrutiny and being adjusted because CCP wanted them to be a primary system....and now they are.
---
I've heard he can suck a tennis ball through a garden hose.
---
Yeah nah
---
I was sure i tried that? Apparently not. Still seems wierd as to why it should be different for strength on one side and acquisition/deviation on the other... But i guess EVE has wierder stuff as that :)
---
Prolly doesnt help they keep gutting their staff consistently.
---
Or seeing something juicy decloak after jumping and being furious as to why you can't scram &amp; web the fucking thing before it gets away...  
---
Only to realize you thunk ahead and switched safety settings just in case this thing would happen.  
---
Saved me countless billions that never got concordokkened
---
Yup
---
... right?! ... this is going to be a long day
---
Will that be enough though?
---
It is red, it is phone and it has Batman on the other end of the line?
---
Guessing right?
---
Imo, the best thing you can do (after reading all the guides/watch videos that people post here), is to simply go out and try to solo pvp.  Head to lowsec (black rise prolly) in a frigate till you find a fight. Youre gonna die several times. This is okay. Keep doing it and keep learning. Convo the person you lost to and ask what you can do to improve
---
God speed
---
Do you also ask your kids why your phone is so slow?
---
It's only horrible in theory.
---
In practice, it's a fucking nightmare, you have to move to the station to remove BPCs from the destination can in order to be able to deliver the copies/ invented.
---
Also, just on basic modules and cap modules alone I personally have 900 researched 10/20 BPOs. excluding charges, drones, fighters : those are in their own can ; ships; and structures, deployable. Whenever you try to scale up a bit, it starts being a fucking sucktard piece of retarded shitness my ass. AND I'm pretty cool right now.
---
When you need to have 10 of each fighter BPO because they take 10 fucking eons to build by batch of 1000.
---
You need to copy them to build T2 fighters
---
and then to build T1 standup fighters with them.
---
Which you then use to build T2 standup fighters.
---
AND IT FUCKING COMPLAINS YOU DON T HAVE ENOUGH ROOM WHILE YOU JUST LEFT THE STRUCTURE AND ARE GONE 30 JUMPS AWAY SO YOU CAN'T DELIVER THE FUCKING JOBS AND YOU NEED TO START THEM NOW BECAUSE IT S TIME TO LEAVE .
---
I'm not a violent man, but \*sometimes\* I have some ideas of murder.
---
Rorqual mining only, vet back in that colossal
---
When we start talking polarized faction battleships, my response is "rat in fucking caps"
---
Not as fast lol
---
Did you take this photo with a surplus soviet camera off of a Chernobyl roof robot
---
Get rid of serenity nerds problem solved *back to krabbing guys!*
---
&gt; that favor good positional plays
---
even as someone who really likes plexes this is the one thing i can't for the life of me agree on, the inability to get warpins, bounce on grid etc because of deadspace is horrible for positional plays and splitting grid against larger targets. What ends up happening is that everyone either brawls or sets up way ahead of time in a distance that people can't really catch up without dying in the process (looking at you mr orthrus at 500 km off the beacon).
---
Doesn't mean the whole thing is bad, i still like them very much and there are ways to kinda deal with it, however most of them (with the exception of chain booshing i guess) is basically "dont engage". Things like this, the ability to get cloaky/dscan immune ships into plexes and the bumfuck retarded decision to axe plex sliding are the things keeping it from even higher praise from me really.
---
lol those names aren't even clever
---
It isn’t much but it’s honest work
---
Doubt Batman will give a fuck about it tbh.
---
we all saw how true the "it was a bug" excuse tends to be with the 2 letter search, you know the one they fixed after saying countless times to several key members that it was a bug and there was nothing to fix.
---
If CCP can, maybe they can make specific zone that only capsule can come, then players will be given ships by NPC to fight to each other so no benefits from gears, only experiences and skill will decided who is winner and newbie will not to worry about money if they lost the ship during fight. This zone may require LP to come and there is restriction for number of times you can get ship.
---
More than 50% if bots use one programming sub structure to operate. Look for the one sub structure and ban based on it. More than half the bots are fine right there.
---
Heaven forbid there's actually content that favors small ships...
---
If I´m not mistaken, by now you can already use every T1 module at the moment of character creation. You don´t have to skill into ABs, eWar modules and all those stuffs anymore, so training should only increase the effectiveness, not talking about bigger ship classes of course
---
Bots are CalMil atm, warzone flipped
---
I think they lost a random heron and a sabre that de tethered for some reason. It was honestly a nice change from fighting fraternity, understanding what we were being called in local was a refreshing improvement.
---
Seriously, I knew these guys were bad, but what the actual fuck?
---
not like it would be hard, all they'd have to do is replace the current gates with accel gates, push comes to shove just use "permanent whs" to get the mass restriction. Not like it would ever happen cause why would they add more space to a game with arguably too much space but still
---
GNI is not actually that bad when you ignore its ecm bonus.
---
But linking a t1 frig kill won't showcase that.
---
Not using slack smh
---
Should be, but for some reason I saw a bunch of gal bots last night.
---
I'm a simple person, I see 3D printed Eve ships, I upvote.
---
Truth_hurts
---
No idea why the picture wont show up in the r/eve but it will here =( #redditnoob
---
there's a difference between removing them and letting people grind them, since one gives a direct-reward feeling of progression and "passing flight school" and the other they would have never noticed.
---
No need for the fleet to go back. Can't they just make another one?
---
You've already been able to turn off the other sounds, there is a little menu to the lower right of capacitor and manage alarm settings there.
---
Tbh I'd AWOX em if it wasn't for the standings hit
---
Does anybody have a market-driven "what should I prioritize when mining" website that has moon rocks with regular ore? Ive seen a few things online but they dont seem to mix the two ,and im not sure why.
---
Yes, but alpha bots can´t use Ishtars
---
I meant the people behind the ships... you know, those that will eventually get bored of glassing Tribute.
---
90% of people aren't even getting to that point
---
We killed a coveter, the praxis that came to save him, and some other stuff before skillfully losing to an Armageddon and 2 proteus's. Was great fun and would do it again!
---
I played Eve for years without having finished the magic 14 and had plenty of fun. So did thousands of others, especially 5+ years ago.
---
Better than most streams.
---
Great news for you there are still a bunch of regions left.
---
not only the 14, no, this applies to basically every skill.
---
but  because it's eve and skill training is a core part of the game, we can't just make every skill grindable (unless the game philosophy takes a big change, up to CCP really), so we only give newbies a little "tease" of skills they can train themselves, bypassing the time limit - skills that are absolutely core to every ship (the magic 14), and maybe some bonus skills depending on their race (they could for example complete a big arc in reward for their racial small gun or frigate to V).
---
If the newbie doesn't want to, he doesn't get the skills, but if he does, he is thrown into perhaps challenging objectives that will require him to learn more about the game, the intricacies of fitting (Good thing we gave you powergrid management V last mission!) or whatever, thus reeling them in by giving them more and more advanced tastes of eve outside of "lol sleepers, btw here's trade 3".
---
We'll do it again next week maybe.
---
Yeah Nighthawk really need more mid slots.
---
Well I guess you're in luck, I plan on printing the whole SOE line once I get the models mesh repaired
---
Isn't that all of them?
---
I'm not casual, I'm handicapped, so I'm slower than a normal player, and there is a lot of times I've accidentally overheated when I didn't mean to.
---
You can disable the other sounds with the menu beside the capacitor, I just want to add another alarm to the list. If you don't want to use a feature like this, you could disable it.
---
Found the nullsec dude lmao
---
Then change the hot key to something else.
---
CCP devs who are doing the tickets, just close them all day long and wait for their wages.  Don't expect them to actually do anything about it. This company very smartly fired its whole community team and honestly don't give a fuck about anything but your wallet.
---
Until you have network splits ... although, it is funny to see what people talk about when it is just a fraction of them and then it tries to re-feed the conversations into each other.
---
I lost a ratting machariel to one of my alts once.  Instead of assigning the alts drones to me, I accidentally hit F and didn't realize I was getting hit by them until I saw the lossmail.
---
Deleted Last Post because I fail at reddit and don't know how to post things properly.
---
By too much effort, you really mean worth Jack shit.
---
Comments like this are why I voted for him on all accounts. Goon krab tears best tears.
---
True, though aren't all the big entities fighting right now?
---
It's still disgusting.
---
Oh, you're not wrong, but there's a number of folks out there who don't have cap skills, or don't want to fly caps at all. And there's just something special about a polarized battleship, or a fully blinged out Talos. They're just damn fun.
---
&gt; ... so that players are strongly penalized for running from fights inside plexes.
---
When you spot a rock coming for your scissors, why stick around? Go find some paper.
---
Nice looks like you guys had fun.

dont really join a faction, join corps in said factions. Those are the recommendations i personally have:

I'm in your alliance, I'm Wednesday Antoinette.

Worm Holes with their mass limitations?

Which is fine, I still want the alarm.
---
&gt; Eris : has anyone ever seen this ship in space?
---
I see you and raise you an Echelon.
---
kk, you log your Alpha alt, my turn to farm it.
---
Is this refering to gankers? Are combat drones not a good enough defence?
---
&gt; ... and something so small faction frigs cannot go in, alphas and newbs need a place to learn.
---
How do you stop the faction modules and implants?
---
tfw high sec plebs don't know the difference between a rev and an avatar

It continues while in the background and unfocused. I'm not sure if it does it while it's minimised to the tray icon though.
---

The only importance of alliance is a nice logo on the citadels. When is CCP going to give us better corp logos?

So Dunk is going to campaign against the "Kiting" Meta and if he is successful we can finally resort to the really fun things in EVE, krabbing in nearly full safety and frome time to time some fixed fights at zero speed in v-3 at ge gate ...

I like clicking rocks. A rock doesn't shoot back, and if I don't click a rock soon enough or fast enough or if I click the wrong rock or at the wrong distance from a rock or I brought the wrong equipment for the rock guess what- I've let no one down and no one's mad at me.
---
I love how salty some alphas are because they think they're entitled to a free game
---
Now that is just toxic for no reason. Those changes fit perfectly on the VNI rebalance, and gimp the next option the bots will cling to, Gila.
---
&gt; If your main argument that its fine that goons own CSM is that "well ccp dont have to listen to them anyway" then you are just admitting that goons are making the csm functionally useless.
---
Not quite. Not just CCP has no obligation to listen to CSM, they also has no obligation to accept anyone on CSM regardless of voting results. If CCP thought that latest CSM compositions are somehow harmful for whatever reasons, including, they would instead bring people they trust. Holding the board of representatives they know aren't worth listening to anyway is not something I think CCP would do. It's not free after all. I believe that means CCP are content with feedback they are getting from CSM. This means they don't see political allegiances of these people as a problem, which in turn means initial idea of reserving CSM chairs using playstyle expertise as a criterion could be seen as constructive, but not as a mean to limit some powerblock's representation - CCP simply don't need anything to help with that because they don't want such limitations.
---
If you or someone else must insist that this is precisely the problem, then it's worth saying this directly instead of beating about the bush, talking about playstyles and fields of expertise.
---
&gt; And you defend this practice because apparently thinking the worst corp for eve onlines health in history is bad is just "grr gons".
---
I don't defend anything because I'm only here to have a discussion. I used "grr gons" simply as a shorthand for problems you suggest they represent and cause.
---
As for my personal stance, if you care, I do not believe that true sandbox can end up any differently than in a state TQ or Serenity seem to be nearing. So you can guess how much passion I have for "let's fix EVE" initiatives. Like I said, I'm here simply for the discussion, to see arguments and to try and maybe pick on some of them. That's all.
---
&gt; And infact other than nullsec I doubt goons know much about any other region, every time they try to go to lowsec they get fucking trashed.
---
That may be true at some point, but I don't think the latter fact was ever relevant. They failed to exert their power over lowsec when lowsec moons mattered more, true. But lowsec voltron is not the only thing they fought against, and I can't even call B-R a conflict against lowsec entities.
---
All of that took place too long ago, very little is the same it was at the time, including goons as a power.
---
Speaking of which, changes they've been through are sorta relevant to the topic of supposed use of CSM to tailor the game to themselves. When first changes which current state of EVE is widely attributed to hit the server, goons weren't even in the best place to use them, compared to other entities. They just seemed to be the guys that cared the most about coming to the top in Null. If we go even further back in time, we can see them being one of the first to radically change internal policies (which is when they started to accept krabs on industrial scale) to fit what they though was going to be the new meta.
---
With all that in sight, I don't think that some single meta (i.e. safer null) is what puts goons wherever they are and what their CSM guys strive to keep. Metas tended to shift and goons always followed first and with the most energy. I think that we're just trying to attribute their ability to work towards their goals in the game that comes out of CCP's workshops to them rigging said workshop.
---
I mean, I agree that changing the meta to which goons are currently adapted the most is not something that benefits them, and maybe they would oppose it (assuming they can), but somehow I think their overall structure and management abilities will again be more important than current setups they maintain.

Key bind for d-scan is V
---
Some people use it to see a narrow area of space (used with the solar system probe window sometimes), other use its 360° at fixed ranges to tell what's around them far off. Play with it.
---
we're at the third(?) 100% player run committee for fw changes, there's been several in depth compiled lists of changes sent to ccp from both those committees and individual "famous" figures in the warzones, literally all of them ignored, with maybe the exception of a single patch almost a decade later to keep fitted wc stabs from plexes, and they managed to break insta gate sliding with said patch.
---
you probably think you sound cool saying that but you just sound retarded.
---
Looks like you have a few minor issues, but not bad overall. 
---
The bottom looks like maybe not enough support structure. Notice the globs of material
---
I'm not sure what the lines at the top are from. Maybe ringing
---
Head over to the 3d print subreddit. There's some real experts that can give you some advice to dial it in and improve the overall quality.
---
Wish i could make it.
---
Never not warp cloaked
---
You can do PVP with meta module fits without any problem
---
Don't know about Blood Raider, but I took out a Gurista one in Caldari space last night solo in a rattlesnake passive fit. They key is resistance to the damage they deal to you. My fit had 90% thermal resistance and tanked all the incoming damage with no issues. Shield held steady at 60%. Once the fob was down (about an hour and a half) I mopped up the fleet with drones (another hour and a half) and that was it. Fit was torps and tank. I had 0 capacitor for the most of the fight but didn't need any to begin with.
---
I did take out the fleet logi and ECM ships to make my life easier.
---
The fit:
---
`[Rattlesnake, FOB]`
---
`Caldari Navy Shield Power Relay`
---
`Republic Fleet Large Shield Extender`
---
`Pithum A-Type Thermal Dissipation Amplifier`
---
`Republic Fleet Shield Recharger`
---
`Torpedo Launcher II`
---
`Large Core Defense Field Purger II`
---
`Ogre II x4`
---
`Hobgoblin II x5`
---
`Hammerhead II x5`
---
`Inferno Rage Torpedo x5000`
---
Full tactics:
---
Warp to zero, start shooting torpedoes at the fob, kill any Osprey and Gila that appears with drones, tank all damage and press f1 when torps reload.
---
At a certain point the mining fleet also landed on me, fortunately frigates only, so I took out the logi and ECM frigates with drones and went on with killing the fob.
---
In all honesty, this was one of the most boring things I ever did in EVE. The only reason I did it was that corp wanted to mine safely.
---
I also use Evedroid. For creating fittings it works great. My only problems are that it seems to crash when viewing item descriptions (which is OK because the app autosaves), the skill queue no longer shows the correct current duration for each skill, instead showing the amount before any training is done on it), and you can't view market prices :/
---
sure, but what you are describing is different.
---
I swap out of them to have fun. It takes 10s, (session change timer).
---
What you are describing is 30min per character, per day. 
---
Huge difference.(hell even if its 10 min per char)
---
dont forget failing to get on the csm cause botters dont vote

I'm still of the belief CCP had evidence of stuff, but their lawyers pulled them back, warning of the cost of a lawsuit (in another country, which means hiring another firm) by somebody who could represent themselves. That even if they won, it would still be costly in reputation. 
---
As noted from the AMA at Eve North. They want to release 3d models of their ships for those who do 3d printing, but their lawyers won't allow them because it opens them up to those assets being used by others for profit. 
---
It seems the law division at CCP has a lot of sway. The whole backtracking in the press release for that reeked of legalese in the language used. Even if they were correct to ban, it wasn't going to be worth it if bogged down in lawsuits, and potentially opening the door to more.
---
Think of it this way. 
---
How many fucking moons would be named the n word. For the sake of preventing confusion, ccp wouldn't enable that sort of thing.
---
Wait, I was supposed to shield fit my Rook? No wonder why I died in a pit of fire and autism :BIGTHINK:
---
There is guy who bought off his ally and coalition for 6 months when they lost several keepstars ,and all was pointing they will lose more,still most of his coalition partners are trying to show him as a bad guy...

I have mine set to 360 and mapped to a macro key on my mouse. Made a nice difference just having to bump my thumb.

do it even if you do care for them

keep them on their toes and checking sites before warping

Alright so here is the thing: More ram doesn actually change much since it has not much to do with graphics, in fact textures arent loaded into the ram but into the gpu vram
---
So no, more ram doesn mean more FPS, it only means (no matter the graphic level) that the client can handle more complex scenes.
---
Then again, thats assuming you arent using a toaster because then yeah it may actually make a difference
---
The 'partners' that fought for him in that war?
---
And when the heat is on his krab&amp;bot emire, he backstabbed them immediately to please the Goon masters?
---
The bottom part of the ring was a little too high off the support and it got a little messed up. I'm planning on  slicing off the ring part and assembling post print next time, hopefully that should fix that part and clean up the print in general
---
oh god, this would be bad for me as I use overloading every fight pretty much and in no way do I want to hear a bunch of related alarms. I indeed already know I am overheating because that is the command I issued. The hit point alarms are to inform you something is happening to your ship that you may not be aware of. Totally different use cases and I do not  ever see a need for an alarm here. Could the UI be improved to better help manage heater, god yes.
---
Wouldnt mind a technical explanation (im not saying im right and disputing your tought on this, im just trying to know why :)  exactly)

What about drone models or missiles? I presume that their positions must be kept in memory, so you can reduce memory usage by using potato mode (I presume).
---
I think one time, they were doing some changes and they ended up punting entirety of eve into one hangar by accident(thats all the ships and items)
---
That was a year or 2 ago, i forgot.
---
You know stuff like this.
---
Do not challenge them on this, mkay?
---
Next time around we might be facing the first ever bot on CSM, when Omist and Branch bots join hands and develop this mechanism.
---
The antiheroes
---
Yes, theyre position, turning down the graphics doesn make the drone dissapear therefor the position still has to be saved
---
Yet, here YOU are, still unable to provide a single good fix option.
---
Imagine fitting ecm when damping exists
---
shut up loser
---
I like to make a note of system I pre-warp and check their KB. I've racked up a few PvE kills on ventures :)
---
Because they don't have the balls, at least you did, props btw
---
Eris ... agreed.
---
I liked to fly it as fleet tackle so both my fleet, and the enemy fleet, could laugh as I flew my pod home.
---
Heck, at lest give it back the split 4/4 turret &amp; missile launcher high layout ..
---
You will not make the ECM ships great again by giving them shield resists. What you do by doing so is turning them into PVE ships
---
I am using ECM from time to time to disrupt logies / break spoolup / protect cyno inhib from fighters (in notank kitsune and armor rook/falcon). Damp is cool but it doesn't cover everything ECM can do.
---
My group uses 6 RR domis with 3 reps 3 cap. Passive tank them specifically for the damage type of the NPCs. Warp to the structure at zero, attack with drones, and orbit each other at 500 to stay in range. Just rep until the structure is dead then clear NPCs and warp out.
---
You got my upvote. Please don't do the "daily reminder thing" which is really annoying. Let's just call it reminder ok?
---
Also Hella mit Pfirsich schmeckt am besten.
---
Nah yeah
---
Do you have any idea what you "earn" from this?
---
In Domis the BR FOBs are pretty simple...  
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
* We warp the fleet at 0 on the FOB
---
* Target all our Fleet mates and get our Cap Chain set up
---
* One of us drops a can and we all set up orbits at differing ranges on it so that we keep well within rep range of each other
---
* While doing the above we’re also targeting the FOB, launching and engaging our drones on it
---
* We focus all our DPS on the NPC Structure and ignore any of the ♦ (diamond) Rats
---
The ♦ Rats are decidedly nasty and depending on which spawn you get things can get pretty hairy. The Rats switch targets frequently and it can be a fairly demanding fleet with trying to keep up on reps. Team cohesion is paramount, if someone is not paying attention things can go South very quickly.
---
We run with heavily armored RR Domis fitted with MJDs for the escape. The Microjump Drive is mandatory should you want to disengage from the fight at any time or at the end, once the FOB has been destroyed, because the ♦ NPC ships do not disengage right away.
---
Thank you! Didnt know of this feature! :D
---
its not about punishing someone, its about having negative consequences for the risk of taking a plex you can't hold.
---
I barely got over the eve learning curve and trying to understand PD was gonna make me take a break from the game again lol, grats man
---
"has no obligation to accept on csm regardless of votes" pretty wrong, playerbase would be very mad. I never said goons were only where they were because of csm influence, but you know they will lobby against changes that fuck goons over, even if its good for the game. And if a goon csm went against that mittani would get him kicked from csm next vote by telling goons not to vote for him. because as i said, goons just suck their leaderships peepee. You are really just restating my points and agreeing, but saying that well goons would win anyway so who cares if csm is irrelevant. Monopolies are bad for a reason, and goon thoughts are the biggest monopoly in eve because they just do what leadership say without thinking, otherwise they wouldnt have voted in 5 dudes who have the exact same game knowledge (which is very narrow)
---
ok

There is a reason why CCP made this in-game item.....

Help me convince my wife to play eve. She's a new gamer, who got hooked by Horizon Zero Dawn (which she cleared twice). Now she wants to try out MMOs. We tried Final Fantasy 14 but she didn't like it, which meant WoW was also out. She began asking me about the 'spaceship' game that I played years back, but I don't know how to explain to her how different Eve is to what she has played. I want her to try Eve and play the game, but from what I remember, I have very little hope of her continuing after briefly undocking, seeing the arcane UI, then trying to warp to god-knows-where before dying immediately to rats/newb hunters.
---
Any and all advice are appreciated.

He suck-started a leafblower once.

But t3c don't exist in medium plexes and below in fw
---
Well you get isk per slide based on your accuracy level. If you have 99% accuracy  you get 99,000 isk per slide. 60% accuracy you get 60,000isk per slide. Then you get a crate every level which has 2 skins. Honestly they are about worthless now. You have a TINY chance of pulling a stack of plex (1 to 10) but it's rare. Then you have the big rewards of the 1 run BPCs (Marshal being the big payday)
---
I made a lot of isk off of it early on because I sold a TON of skins before they became worthless.

lol. Eve has one of the steepest learning curves of any game. PD is it's own learning curve on top of it. It's definitely not for everybody.
---
yes
---
It showed up in the post, but not on the r/Eve subreddit as you scrolled through it. It just had a link. #I suck at reddit
---
I just use a vpn and VMs to run multiple alpha gilas which is much better than spending irl money on this shit game lmbo. I'd recommend this over try to do something against the eula.
---
It is possible.... 
---
Though a corp mate got politely asked to stop doing it by CCP when they noticed it.
---
Abstract a bit please. I doubt the exact change to the widow is important to him. He just wants it changed in a way that it's more useful than currently after the ECM changes.
---
Personally, I'd like better resist profiles for the T2 battleships in general. Just imagine a widow with the natural resist profile of a Rook. You'd close the EM hole with a hardener and otherwise use adaptives and have a great tank. (It doesn't have to be this extreme but please better than the current stuff.)
---
see also https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Natural_resistances#Black_Ops
---
I'm not in goons and fyi I love what he do and try to do the exact same at my scale, what he do is not the issue, who he is, is one.
---
For example he is the kind of person to "mute" people who disagree with his vision of the game, that's a big issue when you know CSM are elected to represent the community, from this fact only he is losing half of the feedback.
---
But for me the biggest issue is his ego issue, like really I can save in favorite this discussion and come back to you soon as Olmeca will fucked up something, I'm 100 % his presence in the CSM will bring a lot of drama and other stuff like NDA breaking, it's almost like having a xenuria and that's why I think, The Imperium stop supporting Xenuria, sadly Panfam decide to support people like gobbins or even worst, Olmeca. (And don't get me wrong, I'm pretty sure Killah bee will do an amazing job and need more people of his side of the coin, just not people like Olmeca)
---
I think it’s more of the point of overheat and the risk/reward if offers.
---
You do realize you are Provi-bloc, And can't even contain Provi, right? Eventually even Test will get tired of holding your incompetent hands.
---
What you're doing is against the eula too...
---
Why not just fight the wardec?
---
Free high sec dumbs kills.
---
what if i want to do reddit pve instead?
---
The weirdest ones are the plexing bots. They're getting smarter, and they've started actually fighting back if they have an autowin matchup. Turns out plex fights are so linear that it's only like a 10 node decision tree for most matchups, so the simple ones where it's 2-3 are just braindead easy to bot.
---
Might just be an alpha alt tbh
---
I'm working on printing some of my favorite ships atm. The Malediction came out great, but broke apart when taking off the supports (I think altering the angle will make a big difference on that one). Yesterday and the day before it was the Nidhoggur, which is not an easy thing to print well (so many thin "armor" walls). The second one came out pretty nice, though trying to get the supports out of the fighter bay area in the front hasn't been easy...everything else looks good.
---
No a GM told me it's fine
---
I'm not an Alpha, I'm just correcting what seems to be a distorted perception that veteran players try to cling to so that they can still feel like they're part of some special group that plays some special game. 
---
You're not. Get over it
---
Nah. I tested the shit out of it since it took about half an hour to actually kill me. When I sent drones out 1 at a time, or killed prop, same tick, it would go to heated point orbit and focus drone(s). If I pull them it would immediately go back to trying to minimize transversal and dps me. If I heated prop it would react immediately to the slingshot. That was the entire decision tree, I repeated it about 50 times and reported as a bot.
---
I think the main issue here is you touched a SLYCE Procurer, nothing to do with tracking.
---
This reminds me. I was wondering that too. I am from a third world country and it seriously sucks that I have to pay in US $ and could not pay in Rubles which was cheaper and more reasonable for me.
---
I will have to try this VPN thing out.
---
The short answer is that people who don't live in highsec live in other parts of space because they prefer those mechanics.
---
The longer version is how many of the highsec fighting mechanics are super annoying if you don't specialize in them. The wardeccers don't really fight but mostly gank at tradehubs. If a fighting force approaches them they usually dock up.
---
Also a player wouldn't have taken 30 minutes to kill me, they'd have ignored the kited-out drones and just burned me down in about a minute.
---
It's like the Chinese singularity
---
The removal of passive moon income was one oft the biggest nails in the coffin of EVE when it dies. It removed a complete playstyle and the group cherishing this playstyle (see massive decline in logins despite login reward actions) as there is no alternative anymore to grinding static PvE content for the majority of your online time.
---
That's just awfully boring tho tbh.
---
That's what we're starting to see, yes. Except much like I warned World of Warships about, it's not just China (who are banned from WoWS NA) botting, most of the bots in warships are in fact American players.
---
So Alex swallowed everyone one of their loads? wow. Just... wow.
---
It's not different; you're choosing to lose out on SP that you would otherwise have accumulated if you would have left the implants in so that you can roam around for fun and not lose your implants. You're choosing fun over SP which is exactly the comparison that was made earlier. 
---
You trying to make the assumption that players who stick around are going to have your same outlook on it is such a false analogy I'm not going to bother debating it. You don't know either way so you lose your entire point on that argument.
---
I do love the Nid/Hel but 3D printing those on standard extrusion based printers is a huge PITA. I had a Nid printed in a SLS machine before that turned out super nice, but I have no idea how to begin printing that with my FDM machine lol
---
Are you also farming downvotes?
---
A GM will not discuss the EULA with you or tell you, if it's fine or not. Did you read it?
---
I recommend you delete the comment. You're admitting to break the EULA. xD
---
Is Null Sec Going to be infested with Myrmidon's and Potatoes?
---
I have actually. Name one F2P game where you have access to everything without paying 1 cent. There are none. There's always incentive to spend money, that's the whole point of microtransactions T
---
rying to make a claim like that without a single point to back it up just goes to show that either you don't have one or you're so entrenched in your line of argument that you're not even going to bother with silly facts.
---
Is it possible to skip the tutorials and get the small skill injector ar all the skills/items that you would get completing them normally?
---
Black frog freight or PushX
---
And i'm not playing the game, but that doesn't make the salt you're spilling all over this thread any less amusing
---
Is Anybody Out There ?
---
No they won't necessarily see iron vs atlas war
---
You re dumb
---
Best t3d would be jackdaw for this, but it can't snipe as well as the Orthrus, nor can it clear the rooms as fast.
---
Orthrus has an insane missile velocity bonus that will almost always win, and at top skills, it's just good enough to kill the Serpentis 4/10 boss.
---
The jackdaw wins in rooms with lots of npc's where the limited ammo capacity of RLML's is a downside. 
---
For example, in the guristas 3/10 (or angel/blood since they are about the same site), Jackdaw might win on the 2nd/3rd/4th room, but if both ships enter final room at about the same time and the Orthrus switched to CN ammo it will be able to headshot the boss frigate before the jackdaw, unless the Jackdaw is really on the ball and has some kind of long range sniper fit.
---
Rapid Lights will also win every contest on a Refuge/Hideaway.
---
The fit that i used back then was something like RLML's t2 + sisters probe launcher, Corelum c-type mwd, gist a/b large booster, pithum c-type invul, republic fleet large cap battery, sensor booster, and the lows i think had at least 3 damage mods, LM-905 and RL-1005 implants, and i think the 5% for cap capacity or cap recharge as well.
---
With blue pill standard, it could tank final room of serpentis 4/10 for a little while.
---
PS: Not sure why my comment above got downrated, i have a few yrs of experience running hisec anoms for escalations in hisec, focusing on probing and running 3-4/10 sites and also doing sleeeper caches where i could (Orthrus could probably work in those too, due to the recent addition of better hacking implants).
---
That’s my favorite item in the game
---
Good point. Though aren't they a bit costly comparably?
---
Rorqs have been nerfed hard, now other people won't be able to compete with superfleets like this or mine up enough to compete :D
---
Isnt there a sliced model (like 2 halves) on thingiverse from the astero? I found its much easier to slice the models along an axis and glue them afterwards
---
No kidding? The more you know.
---
Options have been presented for years. CCP and CSM do nothing about FW no matter what gets suggested or how bad it gets. I really think that neither give a single crap about FW and they would delete it if they thought nobody would notice. Instead they leave it to rot.
---
Ignored. Blatantly ignored.
---
Usually just section it out in to multiple prints. 
---
Most people just unbox their 3d printer and take of running with it. You can get some decent prints, but you'll get some great prints if you dial all of your settings in and level the bed. I also use a silicon carbon tempered bed to print on.
---
Sort turned on Test to help the CFC in Fountain. Sort turned on the CFC to keep his space after the Halloween War. Sort turned on PanFam when the Imperium were coming. And he will turn on the Imperium the next time it's politically convenient. Why is anybody surprised?
---
Do you really think the corax needs a drone bay? I feel with destroyers, they should stay focused on one weapon type.
---
GG boys!
---
I got the joke.  Worth the upvote lol.
---
I'll even give you three right of the top of my head: Tera, Aura Kingdom and Vindictus. F2P mmorpgs don't block you from anything, they just lock it behind countless hours of grinding.  
---
In EVE no matter how long you grind, without going Omega you will never for example have access to capitals.
---
Just because you spend money doesn't mean you get extra content.
---
For example, cosmetics aren't content, or experience boosters.
---
Not enough quotes of trump asking for evidence and saying there is no collusion.
---
Just sort by new and post pings on reddit instead.
---
It's not salt. I'm arguing a point, a very valid point. Rather than try to engage and point out where I may be wrong you want to go directly to trying to insult me which shows right away that you have no valid argument to offer to refute my point. So why are you even bothering to respond, unless I've struck a nerve? Are you one of those special people that needs to feel special?
---
What did you expect to find, on a fucking island with a majority white population?
---
So kind of a FW style Abyssal space then? Make them less temporary and not inhabitable putting them between a kind of WH space and Abyss space creating a different instance environment to act as plex points. Is that what you mean?
---
90% of them are dead cheap. There are always some exceptions (guns that are used a lot for example) but usually meta modules are cheap.
---
generally alarms are NOT used to indicate a user action. ex: overheat guns on a frig, immediately get alarm. alarms instead are used to warn the user a parameter is out of tolerance. since heat damage is so quick to progress the user experience would be: user overloads &gt;&gt; user hears overload alarm almost immediately. this is not how an alarm is used. this would be more akin to an alarm for low ammo that it would be compared to shield/armor/structure alarms.

Top of section 2 of the [EULA](https://community.eveonline.com/support/policies/eve-eula-en/)
---
&gt;You may establish more than one Account for each copy of the Software licensed. You are however not allowed to play EVE by using more than one Account at the same time, unless you pay a subscription fee for each of the Accounts you intend to use for that purpose. 
---
What you are doing is clearly not permitted.
---
&gt;A big, safe, empty space. This is what’s in my head  
---
I lol'd
---
I guess you use the launcher and then let it go into the background, without doing anything more. Unfortunelatly, it will generate this CPU spikes.
---
But if you minimize the launcher &gt; **and I mean MANUALLY minimize it with the button at the top-right of the window** &lt;, the launcher don't consume as much CPU, spikes are less frequent if not enterily stopped. Hiding it behind another software != minimize it.
---
Apparently when (really) minimized, it realizes that it don't need to show up this damned fading ads. I don't know if it is because Windows don't permit a software to know its status, or if CCP didn't do it right.
---
...You also have the option to activate the "Minimize to tray on close". It gives the same result but you have to MANUALLY close it by the cross at top-right, so not really different from previous solution.
---
Or... an AutoHotkey script can minimize the launcher automatically if you happen to hide it without really minimizing, if the habit of send it to the background is too hard to remove. Something like that :
---
    #NoEnv  																; Recommended for performance and compatibility with future AutoHotkey releases.
---
    #Persistent			
---
    SendMode Input  														; Recommended for new scripts due to its superior speed and reliability.
---
    SetWorkingDir %A_ScriptDir%  											; Ensures a consistent starting directory.
---
    
---
    SetTimer, KeepLauncherMinimized, 15000  								; Setting a Timer to launch the procedure each 15 s, it will happen until the script is manually closed

Perhaps drone booshing npc's which have a fairly visible spool up animation, so if you don't reposition your drones they'll have to burn back before you can resume dps.
---
I'll be on for a while today if anybody has any questions about Project Discovery.
---
Making a peace after month of conflict; while bleeding player and loosing hard the war is not backstab.
---
The dumb moove comes from Elo and Gobb in reaction of the deal.
---
He's also botting as a point to CCP so there's that.
---
Can't have netsplits if you only have one server :smart:
---
Why mine? 99% of all items on the market cost less than the minerals to produce them. Just but shit and trade. The economy is so broken that mining is literally useless now unless you are rorq mining in carebear null. Those dumbfucks will mine 200B in minerals to build a 100B titan. What's really fucked up is that they mine so much that it isn't even noticable. #NoGapProblemsHere
---
You can fly cool stuff from day 1 some of the most fun I’ve had have been in t1 frigates and there so cheap you can lose a load of them and still be fine, 
---
Also Making eve easier will just make players less invested in the game because they didn’t earn what they got. getting that new shiny ship won’t mean anything to them I still remember the first time I got in vagabond I’d been training into it for more than 6 months I’d felt like I’d accomplished something worthwhile, fast forward 11 years I can have a titan toon day 1  of the character and it means nothing to me
---
Wouldn't afk ratters just move to smartbombing?
---
Holy shot cry more you ficking nullbean carebear shitler.
---
You answered your own question
---
Granted, Eve is a somewhat unique and niche game, so the way they implemented their F2P model had to be somewhat unique in it's own right. Yes there are skills you cannot possess as a F2P player, but that has more to do with the detrimental effect they would have on the overall game. For example:
---
\-Inability to cloak as a F2P player. This would have a profound effect on allowing this for free accounts. There would be endless amounts of cloaky scouts/campers if they allowed this. It would be game-breaking. 
---
Eve doesn't do progression the same way as other games so the F2P aspect had to take that in to account as well. 
---
I'll use one of your examples: Tera
---
Item shop sells a 90 day elite status voucher that allows for double XP(double training time anyone?), double weekly dungeon limits, 2x crafting speed, fast travel, extra broker slots for selling items, discounted fees etc. 
---
As you can see, there are a some similar and some very different benefits for premium subscriber access. Some of those like the broker limits and fees are implemented as skills in EvE. No, it isn't exactly the same, but it can't be given how different the games are.
---
CCP implemented F2P in the most sensible way they could without breaking the game completely. The original interation was more like an extended trial, which they admitted, and they went back and revamped it to include more things so that F2P was a viable option and didn't play like an extended trial.
---
Sadly, sometimes the "look into it" is closing the ticket with no reply, and "eventually" can be 3+ months. Really no guarantees, esp. with things related to account hacks/bans.
---
Why would olmeca (or any of them) get.booted?
---
I don’t understand how anyone can stand to not have a sub. I have alts that I have omega on I just can’t handle being told I can have that next level.
---
Almost all of them do. Even Fortnight has the Battlepass. I've explained a bit more in another response if you want to give it a read.
---
The difference is that jump drives are immediate while jump portals last 20 or 60 seconds.
---
You cannot activate either module when the cyno is dead. Since jumping is immediate (any delays are just loading and session change times) it means that you will always jump to the cyno if it's alive or don't jump if it's dead. There is no actual room for the cyno dying between activating the jump and jumping.
---
But jump bridges will always stay active for the full cycle time. If the cyno dies during the portal generator cycle time, it won't shut off. Ships can initiate the jump after the destination cyno died or expired. In which case they end up at the sun (or sometimes some other random coordinates, but I forgot what exactly the conditions for that were).
---
Seems like it, couldn't hack a can, couldn't dock and now can't log back on either
---
Did DBRB accidently dive out a concourse window instead of boarding the plane?
---
black screen when trying to log in? if so yeah same here mate
---
Yes. Stuck in jump tunnel. Relogged and cant log back in. RIP
---
Uh huh.
---
Got the last hit but server died before km was processed
---
Yep everything froze
---
Well, they normally respond within a day or two and I've always had excellent results, so I'll let you have your opinion on that matter.
---
Indeed
---
yeah 150s gate jump then dc on a alt, main is okey 
---
some ppl cant save fitts and have masive lag
---
can confirm, [eve-offline.net](https://eve-offline.net) usercount is also increasing at a high rate
---
in an abyss site RIP
---
seems like the server itself is fine, but some of the services are experiencing issues.
---
https://eve-offline.net/
---
Well... The UI is a thing for sure, as is the murderous learning curve in the beginning. No way around that. Eat it or leave it. 
---
Dunno how long you've been away, are you aware of the alpha clone status? Basically an unlimited trial without subscription fees. Skillsets are limited but it's considered a viable free to play option by many ppl.  
---
First, let her play around with the character creation. Take your time with this. Let her tinker with the races and bloodlines and facial options. Might keep her amused for days. Have 2 computers? Participate in the fun. Heck, I could keep myself amused for days if not more. Maybe I should. It's irrelevant but it's fun. A minivans of it's own.  
---
The tutorial missions for newbros/newboobs aren't all that bad. Let her do them. Some epic arc comes next. Again, if you have a 2nd rig, assist her if necessary. Eventually gank her. Lolz.  
---
And last but certainly not least, encourage her to use the in game chat channels. This might be the most important thing of all. Don't explain everything in advance, let her figure it out on her own. Make her ask for advice ingame. Let her experience the most awesome and newbro friendly gaming community there ever was. 
---
If this doesn't work out, EVE is not for her.
---
My clients aren't taking commands, but my afk ratters are still doing their afk things.
---
Rip
---
I lost an Orge II because I couldn't get it to return to drone bay.  I demand SP.
---
Ooo, zesty!
---
Triglivions won
---
the chat server is running as expected.
---
Following up on a ticket actually slows it down, they respond by last response, so replying just tends to push them to the bottom of the pile.
---
On a side note, apparently all I had to do was ask about it, just got a reply and resolution about 10 minutes ago.
---
And? WiNGSPAN has a collection of the best stealth bomber pilots in the game to this day. Not sure I see the point of the reply.
---
Couldn't make bookmarks and can no longer login
---
Yup... Don't know if it's just a personal feeling or a fact, but it feels like the server often has issues these days, and it feels like there's more disconnects than ever before.
---
Maybe just a feeling
---
I use splash top. The free version lets you connect from the same internet connection that is great for playing market pvp while in the rest room. The paid version lets you log in from anywhere it’s really handy to get the next job running or check the market
---
&gt;Granted, Eve is a somewhat unique and niche game 
---
VS  
---
"EVE is not a special game"  
---
...can you make up your mind before trying to argue a point?
---
I wonder how many excav deathmails we can manage to get this time.
---
So many good market tools died. Eveernus evecentral evemarketeer is looking like that.
---
Folks have been saying eve has been dying for years now. All the haters didn’t listen. Where are all the “Reeeeeee” posters now?
---
I spent 5 minutes able to lock, shoot, manual pilot, do everything.  Except warp.
---
Very kill
---
awesome im doing an abyssal site cant launch my drones or reload my weapons... im going to timeout and die and lose my ship
---
well thank goodness it wasn't just me.  my friend was like "uh I can't load ammo"... "Uhhhhh. i can't recall drones"   
---
i suggest we dock. can't take gate.   
---
can't logoff.   
---
Lack of content triggered a fail-safe and crashed the server, triggering out of game content
---
**I'm on to you, CCP**
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Thought it was just me, couldn't launch drones, dock, or jump lol
---
much kill, many ded, f
---
Your trying to make me feel obligated for something I had no knowledge of. Stop itttttttttt!!!
---
All Your Bots Are Belong To Us
---
get her onto pvp by practising with her ? undock together, got to a quiet place, then try to murder each other.
---
le sigh
---
client or server?
---
It's so bad i was forced into watching the movie Legion
---
&gt; Caracal navy issue: it needed a fitting buff so it could fit tank with hams, not drones. needs fitting buffs / 4% shield resist bonus
---
YAS PLS
---
Seems Olmeca is having an immediate effect
---
yes - from EU
---
got kicked while using stargate... countdown from 180s then session timed out.
---
´F
---
Imagine being this clueless.
---
yup, I had local in a wormhole for a minute then it died
---
That's how player retention for newbies low.
---
22% tidi in mostly empty hisec system right now
---
Oh shit... They should definitely comp you for that. No fault of yours.
---
Skill Points!
---
I want Skill Points!
---
it's actually been getting better the last few months. around this time last year until christmas this was a weekly thing
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
It will work
---
You can set up a virtual drive on your pc to run multiple alpha clients or you used to be able to unless they clamped down on that loophole? One of my friends put me on to that idea about a year ago only used it once ended up just using my 3 accounts as omega

We're currently investigating issues with Tranquility's database!

More information as soon as we have it!

Server restart incoming soon, please secure your characters as best you can!
---
Also died in an Abyssal Sight.  Do we get that ship replaced?
---
They’ve been saying EVE is dying for years.   It finally happened
---
I marked ur mom as NSFW
---
 I demand to remove the  **auto-aggression** NPC on my drones!!!
---
I think you know the difference in those two statements. 
---
Saying Eve doesn't do their progression system the same as 90% of games on the market and therefore has to have a different F2P model is a different statement than implying that Eve is a game which takes a superior intellect and only Mensa level individuals are capable of understanding its intricasies, which is the view widely held by the Eve player base.
---
It seems more frozen. It's been sitting at exactly  **21,607** for a long time
---
gib sp
---
more LP payout for plexes will just make yield/LP go down.   
---
but i see what you're getting at and i like it.
---
finally i can go play a fun game instead
---
Eve has been dead for about 7 years
---
Oh hey, a new spiffy launcher PA system.
---
Hercules was not there in fountain at this time. However I was and I can say that while the culture was already on its way out the actions that iron did to secure a beachhead for Goons pretty much pushed them out completely so yes iron did have a part to play in the operation but we did not solely kick out the culture
---
Classic
---
So its your fault that the server died!
---
Well part of the game is knowing when to run away :P
---
Insurance is a cash payout instantly paid directly to your wallet upon the loss of a ship.  Even if you don't insure you get a small baseline payout.  Platinum insurance (which if you're bothering to insure, always get the best) can net you as much as 1/2 of the hull's cost. A Ferox for instance currently runs about 35-40m for the hull, 8m for the insurance, and pays out 29m.
---
Insurance lasts 3 months and is always profitable if you lose your ship in that time.  T1 ships insure better relative to their value than faction and T2 ships.  Basically any PvP ship smaller than a cap is worth platinum insuring as a matter of habit, especially T1 ships.  Even if it's a small payout, it's basically free money as long as you lose that ship within the time frame, and you will if you PvP at all. 
---
PvE ships usually are as well, but they *should* die less often so it's less clear cut.
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
i  tackled buzzard with  porpoise when this happened
---
Via Twitter, eve_status says server restart incoming and to "secure your characters as best you can"
---
...lol
---
Finally they completed invading new eden entirely.
---
GG Triglavians.
---
Of course it's down ... because keeping an infrastructure that is stable apparently is too much to ask from a garage company like CCP.
---
Can feel you, it hurts
---
eve podded
---
i am shit at PD, i'm just at 65% and can't get really higher.

Any tips?

But they use corn syrup instead of real cane sugar

Trigonions*

It was a nice Deimos, goodnight, sweet prince &lt;/3
---
your right, as time passes i'm wondering wtf.
---
EVE is not dead, not until late 2022 so please hush!
---
Kind of like the dragoon?
---
Reminder the Enforcer is still the most pointless ship in EVE.
---
I can’t tell if everyone missed the sarcasm, or just being double sarcastic back. Criss Cross?
---
too soon?
---
Twitter eve_status says server restart incoming, and to "secure your character as best you can"
---
Thanks for the help, I linked my fit and it was terrible, now i bought all these crazy good guns and i should be ready once i get the skills trained up!
---
Did someone say free SP?
---
It's being used as propaganda, goons like to pretend Horde is a dystopian hellscape because it serves their narrative and pushes players into *their* new player alliance.  Most of them have the good taste to leave the politicking out of new player threads, unlike this guy.  The odds of you being awoxed (attacked/killed by friendlies) is incredibly low, especially if you don't fly blingy ships.  I see like one or two awoxers reported daily, in an alliance of 17 thousand people.  Horde accepts all comers who aren't specifically blacklisted, so we are prone to getting "spies" within the alliance, but that's the price we pay for being as easy as possible for new players to join.  We've been doing it for a long time, so we're used to working around it.
---
Kangarooskin, Camelskin, Koalaskin, Tasmanianskin...
---
Most bots already moved from VNI to Domi before this half-assed nerf.  
---
CCP chasing their tail as always.
---
Thanks. So how many people on one planet makes it want you move?
---
I meant an alarm for when the heat reaches a certain point...  I guess I didn't explain it very well.
---
I'm disappointed the Concord ships have a visible Drone bay, but don't actually have drones.
---
&gt;implying that Eve is a game which takes a superior intellect and only Mensa level individuals are capable of understanding its intricasies, which is the view widely held by the Eve player base.  
---
That hasn't been the point literally anywhere in this thread
---
Oh good, it wasn't just me. Thanks Squizz!
---
its toronto right? so im assuming that's maple syrup
---
They'll give your ship back
---
So instead of dealing with the wardecs like a real corp they decide to game the mecanics...no respect for those losers.
---
If he cant stop the krab then he will stop the krab from logging in. I knew my csm vote wasnt wasted
---
They won't even reimburse when they shut it down themselves?
---
Meh, just 4GB? My Firefox can do more!
---
[http://oi67.tinypic.com/2mx3dhl.jpg](http://oi67.tinypic.com/2mx3dhl.jpg)
---
And the algos which are drone boats, drones have a fixed dps ceiling, other dessies pump high dps/alpha numbers, which can be increased with drugs and implants, imagine adding drones to the mix.
---
Pls help to fix fw.
---
It can stick on the same number for a while in situations as this when the TQ databse is borked and reporting cached values. Then suddenly it jumps.
---
If they detect a server fault the can/usually will reemburse altho you oblt get the mods that DIDNT drop from my understanding.
---
How he backstabbed them,by buying them off for 6 months?in war they where loosing?
---
CCP is going to release Eve 2 on unreal engine, so they’re killing this one.
---
truncate table *;
---
Sure that's SOP, but they have outright stated before they won't reimb abyss for anything; I'm just not sure how that interacts with ccp taking the server down.
---
Triangles*
---
8GB is fine if you’re running Windows 7 and don’t leave a lot of processes open, but if you’re on W10 and leave a lot of shit open it’ll cause problems.
---
If you are worried about gaming performance it makes little difference if you have 8GB or 16GB or more. Hell, a guy ran Star Wars: Battlefront which had a 16GB minimum req on 4GB of RAM just to show how bullshit RAM requirements are.
---
We use it as an entremly fast cyno ship that can also take the BLOPS.
---
Don't know the exact numbers but i wouldn't worry about 10-20 characters doing PI there.
---
The problem starts in places with public access like hisec or crowded nullsec sov space.
---
Even worse if the place is cloaky camped to the point nobody risks their ships ratting and do PI instead.
---
1) Give combat ceptors more cap, they have worse cap regen than a T1 frigate WTF CCP
---
2) Make small arti and small railgun on par with beam, retribution is so powerful there is no point trying to kite with wolf or harpy
---
3) Caracal Navy needs more fitting
---
Well servers back up, logged in for my Deimos to be safely in space. All a bad trip apparently, overdose on Pyrolancia boosters.
---
Thats the thing tho. They wont if you fuck up or get logged out or net hiccup whatever but if THERE SERVER goes down they will. Something about its not my fault and unforseen consequences. Blah blah.. I thinks abyss is a dumb waste of isk but thats my opinion.
---
They swallowed the hook
---
Good shit. I run in cheap stuff so I don't worry too much about it.
---
Great, you jinxed it!
---
What programs are you using to get your models?
---
I have a station container named "Junk" for those skins. It's supposedly worth almost a bil but no way am I taking the time to sell off all that crap.
---
how do I submit/petition a ship reimbursement ?
---
Tetrahedrons\*
---
Yes but have you ever tried to Dscan in real life
---
:ackshually:
---
it does happen to caps using their own jump drive.
---
I'd say let her complete the tutorial by herself. Be there if she has a question/can't figure something out. It should give basic understanding of targeting, activating modules, warping etc. Then take her for some level 1-3 missions until the warp/module/hp/etc management is somewhat decent. Then (or maybe the setup for this should be the step one) buy 20 cheap and simple t1 frig fits (buffer tank, mwd, scram, guns f.ex.) and courier them next to active FW lowsec.
---
Set death clones there and go out and explode. Don't hesitate to convo the people who blow you up, they will have tips and I'd say most will also have sympathy for you if you let them know you're in the process of introducing someone to eve :)
---
It took you two days to come up with that?
---
Nah just 5 seconds
---
Ok
---
They are talking about sleepers, they are very powerful npcs. A mining / gas ship would stand no chance against them. In gas sites inside of wormholes they will warp in after ~ 20 min
---
What?
---
The original had really bad lighting cause the sun was infront of the camera blame alfius for picking the spot :P
---
Me too. Rather annoying. Then all of a sudden all my warp commands came through at once... Then it crashed.
---
About a year ago I did some live streams of Project Discovery. [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmk23hynfJB0FVfj8GZGTiA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmk23hynfJB0FVfj8GZGTiA)
---
In a nut shell, if you think there is a transit, mark it.   
---
It's better to mark some transits than none, you get partial credit for the ones you do get right it's not as simple as either totally right or wrong.
---
As you keep doing the slides you'll start to notice what to look for. That being said, I still get them wrong from time to time. I'm not perfect at it.
---
Run wire through it for leds and sell eve online desk lamp. Quit for job and count your paper.
---
Drones would greatly improve the Enforcer too.
---
I think you open a support ticket. I've never had to so not really sure.
---
It's the point I was making about the pretentiousness of the Eve playerbase, which seeps in to almost every issue that comes up in regard to game changes. I think I've seen more than enough "Fuck you, pay to play the game or gtfo" comments in this thread. 
---
Are you going to continue to try to nitpick every little facet of every statement I make and force me to explain myself in an effort to try to confuse the issue, or can you maybe try some common sense?
---
When I first started I knew the price was going to tank fast so I took them to Jita and sold what I had for about 3.5b. The second time I went to Jita with 3x as many skins I might have made 250m. With the crates not dropping anything but skins I knew they would become less than worthless very fast. 
---
I haven't checked the value of the less common ones "T3C, supers, etc" but from what I last remember they were dropping fast. I honestly haven't even been opening the crates anymore, I've been hoping CCP will change the loot from them so I can open them and get something at least worth something. Until then I've got like 400 of them just sitting around (200 I haven't even redeemed yet)
---
Although all that being said, there is a SLIGHT (like 1 in 200) chance you'll get a small stack of plex when you open one.
---
Do you think of a possibility that these newbies have come from another dimension of EVE universe, and in that universe its possible that they are you, and you are the target so he knows what you think?
---
is there anyone left to turn to though? #allofeve litereally hates him
---
Our logs show nothing.
---
Never seen maple syrup before eh?
---
Apples and Oranges
---
100% weve got the best of the best
---
Tetrapacks*
---
Your brought up another comment from another chain in this thread where I was addressing a different facet as it pertained to the issue. So yeah, apples and oranges
---
You don't need a browser to play eve but there are tons of out of game resources you may wish to access to enhance your game. Depending on what you do in eve you may need a browser on another screen to retain sanity.
---
Not true. I've been reimbursed.
---
Thats fighting fire with fire
---
Domis exist.
---
You know, for that Phoenix, I just realized the bomber pilots coordinated their own FVB runs, we didn't have to prompt anything.
---
thank you, will have look later.
---
Trigonometry*
---
Yeah perfect example of knowing how to be more than an F1 monkey ;)
---
miss you &lt;3
---
no problem. Good luck with it!
---
AFK ratting is completely fine for me. It has huge risk factor involved so i dont see any issue with it.
---
Never had an issue with tickets. No reason to be so negative!
---
Beautiful. Definitely listening on my way home.
---
This is a terrible idea. It just swaps one meta for another.
---
Then every year... the concept remains the same... new space, new places to explore, new content. All great for this game.
---
If you feel ready to jump into more difficult missions let me know, I'll show up and provide assistance if needed.
---
well mineral prices in general are going up. then again that'c cause goons stopped mining and are working on killing the rest of eve.
---
Yeah, the whole rig does alright for web browsing. Once I find a good job, I will be upgrading to something that can handle VR and call it good for another 5-10 years.
---
Do that in addition to other mechanics. Bot free is the goal.
---
Friend.. You must be new here.. Alphas are the extension and rework of the 15-25 or whatever day trial model that failed to be used for more than alts 80% of the time.
---
Alphas are more than welcome into the game they provide you with access and basic skills to learn the vastness of eve. So yes its free to play. But thats simply for you to gain access and learn. Of course CCP would say its "viable" play style. It is but you cant mine for shit a venture dosent get you very far. The point is for you to get invested, to want more, to SUB-FUCKING-SCRIBE. 
---
Now im not against alphas but at some point you have to realize your limited. I appreciate the sentiment CCPs changes provide with the VNI rework alpha drone afk vni will be hilariously usless. But alphas have access to small t2 guns maybe meds? Thats MORE than enough dps for a newbro. Just go amarr lazers lol.
---
Petition it?
---
I remember CCP saying this is actually way harder to implement than people realize, or else they would have done it.
---
Fucking nerds :D

My first thought whenever someone calls em Trigs
---
I just got to london for 3 days! I'm not in imperium, but that's good timing
---
I think its a great concept.
---
Obviously needs alot of considerations for individual systems and the likes, but interesting nonetheless.
---
Just because you can post, doesn't mean you should.
---
Who was provi FC?
---
Yup, those CONCORD guys don’t like anyone!

---
“Eris : has anyone ever seen this ship in space?“
---
Yeah, a wolf rayet wormhole
---
Honestly I think it would be interesting if all modules added mass to ships. The effect doesn't have to be huge, but it could add another interesting dimension to ship fitting and balancing.
---
Yup meanwhile uses VIP login to go steal abandoned excavators in systems
---
From the striations of the plastic, did you print this upside down?
---
You would do better and work with the support by minimizing overhangs. That means, in the Astero's case, printing it with the ring down, and the nose up, like a rocket. You should see better results that way.
---
Is the cute one u/AXSAmazingJay?

Hello there!

I think this guy is already theorycrafting for that eventuality. https://zkillboard.com/kill/77460208/
---
100% third this. Ive made two practicly life long friends from the corp ive built. Some times we dont talk for a while life gets busy but we always find the time.
---
Its as easy as someone moving into your home system to make friends. Thats what this game is about comumity. Nothing would get built if we didnt work together from Goons to the smallest wh or hs corp.
---
I left horde to just go learn pvp in FW.  Didn't learn much in horde except how to be a meat shield and to align before warping.
---
That's not their fault they gave me everything I asked for but I just needed to learn the fundementals of the game so I left.
---
I've learned a ton since.  Haven't killed anyone but not dying right away and finally starting to learn the ranges for my setups.
---
I thought I had to join the FW Corp to participate but I was wrong so you don't have to leave the Corp, you can just go to FW space.
---
Just keep not mining and let the market supply go down. Bots will always be a thing but a little change is good. Peep all those corps with mineral stock piles for when prices rise.
---
But snake pod still exists
---
I like to fly a polarized version in low sec. No one knows what it is/does so they just eat 1k dps.
---
Trignikers
---
Lol love it
---
Hmm i wonder how much dps a polarized one gets in a a wr
---
You are correct the characters will go home, they will just leave the supers in the north.
---
Corax is shit though
---
Do your patriotic duty and only use purr Vermont matke syrup rather than that dirty Canadian stuff!
---
Modules adding mass to a ship would add an extra dimension to ship fitting.
---
Get her involved in the community. Don't walk her through, make her ask for help in the newbro Corp channel and suchlike.
---
Take time playing the character creation minigame, she might like it.
---
I had written a much more comprehensive high effort response but it got lost. Twice. Can't be bothered to rewrite again. Sorry.
---
Every F2P games goal is to get you to pay money, either for items from their item shop or to purchase a premium subscription. 
---
The F2P model Eve uses restricts certain skills because without those restrictions there's nothing to stop someone from creating an army of alts that can mine, run PI, and multibox content to make absurd amounts of ISK. It's something that other game developers don't have to concern themselves with to the extent that CCP does given how easily multiboxing scales with Eve. Game mechanics or the way the UI works makes it more difficult in other games and doesn't scale as well. Not to mention the number of AFK cloaky alts you would have if you allowed that skill. 
---
Still doesn't make Eve not F2P. It just has to approach it from a different way to ensure there is incentive to pay money and it doesn't break them game with armies of alts.
---
CCPleas and more rewards at some point.
---
&gt;Eris : has anyone ever seen this ship in space?
---
Yes, longdrinks hero of syndicate used to roam in one and kill people who had no fucking idea what it was.
---
I tried a meme fit on an alt a few months ago but Jesus fuck it's a bad ship.
---
&gt;because they think you're a meme dictor.
---
theyre right tho
---
How about cargo weight too?
---
&gt;2) Make small arti and small railgun on par with beam, retribution is so powerful there is no point trying to kite with wolf or harpy
---
???
---
Rokh needs some help it sucks in pve and pvp and Naga is better sniper
---
Didn't need to in the end, ship logged back into high sec
---
Reddit has an edit function
---
I've been asking for a long time what the next phase of Project Discovery is going to be. I'd like a change to the reward system, currently these crates are worthless. And anything past level 500 is just for the science (although I don't see that as a bad thing, but it's good to have bigger and bigger rewards so people keep going)
---
Personally if they just added rewards past level 500 and started dropping things other than skins from the reward crates I'd be happy.
---
Bermuda triangle won
---
I saw a Golem single handedly destroying a fleet of Triglavian ships. I emailed him for his fitting but no response. I suppose he wants to keep it a secret. Anyone have any idea what his fitting may have been?
---
[Did Someone Say...] Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker?
---
I downloaded the export of the 3d models from the game and then edit them in Maya
---
Decent
---
The Ishkur makes a fantastic little ship to bait mission runners in.  They think it's just a frigate, so they aggress.  You kill their drones then murder them after spiraling in.  I love it.
---
When exactly was this?
---
its what you get when you have developers looking at the ship that like 90% of ns botters use...
---
&gt;ui being shit is risk/reward

If joining a corp is an issue I hear provi is ok but burning currently. Secondly you could just go to wh space and learn about that instead. Maybe even convince your clan to play there as well. NS is stale and boring and only good is you want to Rorq mine afk for days.
---
That being said you can do that in WH space with proper security.
---
Wh space offers much the same isk making potential but way more small corp or solo pilot friendly not as many neuts to kill you usually. I would recomend exploring a c1 or c2 in a cruiser till your comfortable with the mechanics then raid c3s with a bc or t3c. Or gila.. If your clan wants theyre own system to call home WH space is easiest to shack up in and not get 1000000 titans dropped on you.
---
Can msg me for ign if interested I operate out of a c2 static hs and c3 connections.
---
i love brawly meta.. scram / web ... light cyno... loot brawly idiot.

If he counters... luckily for me I have my super umbrella to protect me.

People will still work with him, or anybody else, if they feel it helps their strategic goals.
---
Dont think a drone bay gonna fix that :P
---
heat damage is only applied at the end of the cycle mate
---
Kinda a shame that Eve can't set aside their squabbles for a moment to dumpster a coalition truly deserving of it.
---
Oh well.
---
I died to a 200km armor cerb before I could see it on my overview
---
Corax is still in a weird place, mostly because of its bonuses. Everything else about the ship says brawler - midslot heavy layout, fitting that makes it hard to use light missiles, slow as heck - but that explosion velocity bonus is only really useful with light missiles because rockets already apply so well to webbed targets. That bonus just doesn't fit with the rest of the ship.
---
My own preference would be to just swap the application bonus for a fire rate bonus. Even in cases where the application bonus would have been relevant the extra DPS from the fire rate bonus will at least partially compensate (smaller fraction applied, but of a larger base dps), and in other cases it just is a straight up buff without having to do something unthematic like make the ship faster or more agile. This would actually give a meaningful distinction between the two missile destroyer hulls - the talwar is the slippery one with good speed, a more lowslot-heavy layout, and the mwd bonus, and the corax is the slower one that grabs you and beats your face in with a brick.
---
Working as intended
---
Could've been faster if you'd just rehashed your tired old 'lol salty' stuff.
---
Sort would have gotten on his knees for goons regardless, would have delayed it a month or two at best. Anyone who thinks otherwise does not know Sort's history.
---
For a group that can't contain provi we sure seem to hold alot of it...
---
I would advise to invest in tube of sunscreen or two.
---
lmao too real
---
Thanks, that's what I was thinking and hoping.
---
These are some pretty dope screenshots.
---
FYI I do NOT endorse this event or product.
---
Wanting to do this as a WH group as well but am wondering, what are you guys doing about corp hangars?
---
You should rotate more often if it still looks that good :P
---
What's really crazy is test and frat were there which means they are working with pan fam. Interesting.
---
Both rats are worth the same. Lewt from cans is garbage in both usually.
---
the bugs started other day i stop mid warp and take a minute to warp
---
FW plex were intended to be pvp arenas. Or at least focal points for pvp. Same reason FW missions have warpable beacons. It actually worked with plex though.
---
I just go there with my loki load everything up create a insta undock and they are left to dust.
---
I'm sorry to inform you that the Widow has recently taken that crown.
---
Yep that’s the way I printed it, nose straight up. I think some of the supports weren’t perfectly level with the ring and that’s why it messed up a little
---
Ok so c1 takes at best a cruiser c2 takes a good fitted cruiser or shit fit bc c3s take t3cs or gilas to run. 
---
Stick with c1-2 till you understand the mechanics. Dont hack the cans and dont salvage the wrecks unless your doing it while your clearing the rats its not worth it to go back. Maybe salvage for c1-2 cuz nanosribbions can give you comparatively more lewt but C3 sites not so much the blue lewt is just worth proportionally more.
---
That all being said. Just take a stratios to a c1-2 armor fit and you should do fine, c3 sits are out of its league tho it cant dps enough to kill them fast enough. C3 sites you want close to 750+ dps to run them well.
---
I live in a c2 static c3 hs if your interested message me we can talk.
---
deviation is also reduced by your strength
---
 
---
I think it's something like deviation =maxdeviation\*(1-40/100)\*(1-6/100)\*(min(probestr/sigstr, 1))
---
That means that if your probe strength is lower than the sig strength, you can reach your max\_deviation (which is smth like radius /2 \*0.6)
---
It's still a Black Ops, it can play soccer mom for Covert fleets.
---
I wonder how much FRT paid him to move to Eso?
---
Good explanation for RPing and server shutdown. Took a few too many boosters and blacked-out for 45 minutes only to wake up in the safety of Hisec.
---
Uh, what?
---
I have started warp to a gas site, cloaked in-warp, checked the site, and come back and still had the full delay. 
---
My experience is that it starts when a visible ship is on grid with the gas site.
---
An escalating two-party conflict being cut short by an overly girth third-party? Well CCP you’ve managed to replicate real players pretty well to a fault.
---
Does anyone know if NPC Sotyios are seeded on the test server? There are some older posts indicating that they weren't, initially.

LOL, we got a super slick expert here... why do you think this isn't widely understood? as I stated in my example of using small guns, the warning would be quite soon after activation. this is also the case for oversized active mods, and many other situations. no where was it assumed this is instantaneous, but instead suggests this alarm with most always be very very soon after activation.
---
That's about the wrongest way you can go to fix FW.

Forgot using the widow as ecm and it becomes good. Fit it like a solo sin with rhml or torps.
---
The guy that followed my corp home greatly underestimated us. Droped a structure and attacked all of ours. Showed up with 4 ships for his structure timer where we showed up with 35. It was a good time.
---
There's no voice acting at all at the start? Wtf
---
Wiener J Allyn
---
&gt;presents the same information in a better way
---
pretty deep assumption right there...
---
It's actually really easy to multibox alphas, but it is not permitted by the End-User License Agreement and therefore CCP could mercilessly ban you for just trying it, if they wanted to. And, uhh, yeah, I can pretty much promise you that the search for "all alphas that have multiboxed at some point" would be ridiculously easy for them to do.
---
Outch! No tidi and we miss that ;/

Maybe you should close the 20 tabs of google chrome? Use something a little lighter if you have to browse the internet while playing like Edge or Firefox.

You are one self-centered egotistical narcisist. Good luck!

this would just make fights even harder to come by, the nano gangs exist becasue you can pick a fight against a larger force isolate a ship or 2 kill it and stay out of harms way, it takes skill because most kiting ships are way more fragile than brawlers the margin for error is much smaller
---
brawling has always been and still is fine for the group with more guys or the bigger batphone, you can see it in doctrines the bigger groups use
---
how else can we avoid getting crushed by the rest of the incoming gang  or the cyno/super cap umbrella?
---
iv been in plenty of situations where a fights broke out and in respose the enemy group has dropped a fax on grid there's no way for small gang to brake fax reps and if we were brawling we would all be dead

what is it with CCP they have a whole bunch fans who would buy their models, but they don't or won't do it.
---
Best part was that they gave the runners up a drink too. Great to see good sportsmanship after a good win.
---
They have actually added this to the capacitor menu for jump capable ships, but I still suggest pilots map it to a key so that you can use it when docked.
---
By your tag, Im pretty sure it is not going to work :P
---
Also, like the guy who replied to me said, you can do quite a bit of the trig stuff as a new player, either ninja salvaging in high security space or running frigate sized abyssal dead space pockets in a group. However, I’ve never done either of those so I can’t really say if they’re worth it compared to the other methods of making money. Definitely worth looking into, though
---
can try ship scanning them to get an idea, and if you do a look at you should be able to figure out what kind of missiles they are using.   Marauders can fit very beefy tanks with bling, boosters, and implants.  I'm not familiar with the content so any fit I'd make would be complete guess work but I'm guessing it's pretty close to a reasonably standard fit.
---
They'd get a

Yeah but that doesn' fit the narrative of sort the backstabber and *** sucker and eve players love stories and myths about other players

They're still structures that exist in space and thus can be wardecced

Ha!
---
Nope, it just clears tjem lot faster.
---
Yes
---
Ayy lmao. They were deserving of some ego deflation as well, but at least they don't pay forty faction forts to stop getting shot at.
---
A super can kill the rats a lot faster. You don't get better bounties or loot, just more
---
We were going to do that first but we couldn't find them in time to work out the plan beforehand. All worked out in the end tho!
---
i used to run upto 9 rorqs, had many builders and queues constantly producing.. but I got out before supers dropped below 15b / hull. And with the changes im glad
---
This is true, but it was true before. The gap was widening and that needed to end.
---
Nope, but that's an easy mistake to make.  They often put the "made in Canada" label really small.

multi fit doesn't fuckin work when all your shit is in cans

Bill Cipher just killed my spaceship game, wat do?
---
You sir, should open your eyes :) But sure, I'm sure you can spin any narrative you want.
---
Not even just poor eyesight, sometimes the backdrop and icon  makes it really hard to detect the heat level or if you're heating at all.
---
Clears sites faster=higher ticks (20min payouts are higher than a normal carrier).
---
While I don't disagree with your overall point I do want to say that multiple drone boats are awful at ratting in one site. When you don't take aggro, your drones don't attack. You can't set assist because you don't know who will get it any given wave.
---
Also, didn't you just batphone multiple entities for a first sov timer? LOL mkkkkkk
---
This was super early on, though. I think this changed in like 2005 or 2006?
---
navy battleships, especially the tempest
---
ccp save it it's shit
---
As someone who's seen bounties from both first hand I can tell you you can get much better ticks with a super vs a carrier. 30mill or so in a carrier, while supers can get an upwards of 50mill or more.
---
Sort would have been fine in AU tz vs imperium with panfam help, he knew that, goon leadership knew that. Same for panfam. But separated, even in AU tz it s too low compare to us.
---
I cant imagine how the goon leadership were happy when Gobb and Elo try to attack gotg in Branch.

Ok but why are two laying down?
---
I think Retri being so powerful a kiter isn´t entirely down to small beams being so much better than the other weapon types (they are a bit stronger, but not THAT MUCH stronger).
---
It has a very strong cap regen, which means it generally doesn´t need to compromise its fittings with cap mods.
---
Amarr T2 resist is the best armor resist profile in the game, making it the tankiest of them all.
---
Very good slot layout for a kiter.
---
Decent fitting resources.
---
You could "compare" it to the Wolf, if you will, and while the Wolf has the same slot layout, it is severly let down by its atrocious fitting resources, "meh" projection, and a bad resist profile on its armour.
---
Can´t fit shite on that thing, no DCU, no rep, nothing. You can fit all that on the Retri effortlessly.
---
Oh, and the Enyo needs more CPU, can´t get over how fitting rails sucks up virtually 50 percent of the CPU. Good luck making use of that 3rd mid.
---
Marry her, right no... Oh, nvm
---
Ishkur and eris can both be great in pvp, I like the ishkur’s tracking coupled with its speed.
---
Yesterday
---
You know the deal was 6 months for himself, 1 month for everyone else right? NC, PL, and PH did not get 6 months of protection
---
Yea, or the module itself starts changing colour / flashing.
---
I wouldn't call what the vni lost in speed, utility highs, and drone damage for tracking, tank, and gunnery a pvp buff. I'd call it neutral at best, I liked the old vni for kiting gangs.
---
Ishkur's honestly very strong, I feel it could be lacking a drone tracking/speed bonus to allow it to fight frigates. It punches up EXTREMELY well, but in the jaguar tackle meta being able to kite drones against it makes it very vulnerable to 2-3 man gangs. If it could haze tackle well I could see it having a niche.
---
Corax I agree, couple drones would make it a top tier scram kiter.
---
Caracal Navy: Better than people think already, but yes, needs to be different not just worse osprey navy.
---
Widow &amp; Rook: yeah they need to be able to do stuff in a post ecm world.
---
Eris: It's good for murdering bots. They're otherwise complete fucking trash and either need a redesign or to double down on the dps so they do significantly more than a hecate/catalyst.
---
None of that makes sense. There's only ever a "first sov timer", there is no second timer for fozzie sov. And no, there was only one batphone there: Legacy (TEST and their allies)
---
I'd like to go with the hidden option C
---
And say siz Rorq alts?
---
And those are rookie numbers.

---
I was expecting more neck beard.
---
Because the north can deploy their supers to delve, and have a field day dropping on anything that moves. Goons can’t be everywhere at once. If they completely burn the north then we’ll start burning Delve until they go back. 
---
It would honestly be pretty fun if they did that, but it would completely mess up their rorqual mining, so it won’t happen, they’ll deploy back to Delve again sooner or later
---
Highsec incursions only have 1 focus now, and there was much wailing and gnashing of teeth from the carebears. I'm sure there's still some fleets running though.
---
Go ti his killboard. He may have lost it.
---
sounds like a good way to waste 2 billion isk though
---
Tribbing won
---
You just can't wait for WoW classic, can you?
---
So what you're telling me is you'd like an eve meta with brawlers and snipers, no kiters, because kiting becomes impossible against anything same size or down.
---
What do you do with scorch, make it weigh a billion tons?
---
Right now brawlers &gt; snipers &gt; kiters &gt; brawlers, and this works reasonably well. If it just becomes snipers vs brawlers, one will always be more powerful than the other.
---
To have a better time engaging on kiters:
---
* Bring fkin links
---
* Bring fkin combat probes
---
* Bring enough tank to burn in on them
---
* Limit their escapes by bubbling their likely warp outs
---
* Bring a range bonused ECM ship or a sniper to create pressure and prevent focus fire
---
* Accept that this is eve, and there will always be fleet comps that helldunk yours. If it's not a counter comp, it's 100 fucking supers, or a boson, or hotdropped smart bombers or whatever the fuck you feel like dying to today. Sometimes that happens. Sometimes you catch the 2b tengu on a gate with 10 hecates. That's eve.
---
I love rollin in hecates and brawl all the time. Sometimes it doesn't go ideally, sometimes it's a great time.
---
*americanly slurps on his dr pepper with lemon*

I could hear the dialup sounds for the president in the last two lines lol
---
Sounds about right. I started at 06 and people were still bitching about the nerf and how CCP should fix their servers (the change wasn't because of balance but because each drone stressed the server and caused lag in "big" battles). One veteran in my corp was miserable about the skill points he "wasted" on the "now useless" drones :P

plenty of other things to use with nearly the same skills, but sure, threaten your subs and cry yourself to sleep like a good little troll xD

yes, buff my ishkur! Love that boat!

Also supers shit on NPC dreads
---
 This is a great example of the emergent gameplay that can result from taking the reins off the NPC AI .  CCP said unsub. We are not needed.
---
With CCP claiming early on that this expansion will forever change Eve and some of these clues I suspect a few things.
---
1) I suspect that triglavians will get a full ship tree from frigates to (at least) carrier sized ships (excluding t3 destroyers/cruisers). I suspect this because of how the ship tree UI is built so far. Compared to all other trees (ORE being the exception) the UI design layout/structure/skills required to fly the trig ships most resemble that of one of the 4 primary races (amarr, gallente, cladari and minmatar). Everyone knows developers love templates.
---
2) The video's statement, "You shall join the flow or be extirpated" leads me to believe that once the final-final invasion stage has been completed, Triglavians will be a starter race for new characters in which their backstory has to do with finding your own place/purpose. Said characters will be able to engage in new invasions against other capsuleers with similarity to how faction warfare works currently. Claiming systems and PVP for the Triglavian race.
---
I realize #2 is a bit of a stretch, but every other major MMO has released new player races/classes with expansions, and CCP has never done this. So, I suspect they may be following in those footsteps. NPC Trig invasions will (hopefully) continue on and perhaps even aid players in Trig faction warfare. It's the only things I can imagine that would "forever change Eve".
---
This would just kill long range ships and make everyone just brawl... chaning one for the other is not balancing.
---
I also like to brawl way more than I like to kite, and that's why I fly in places where I can do it more comfortably and use fits and tactics to be able to (sometimes) survive the usual kiting bullshit you find around.
---
Adapt or die. Stop botching.
---
No. Fuck off.
---
&gt;Because the north can deploy their supers to delve, and have a field day dropping on anything that moves.
---
You understand they have the production to have one in the North and the South right? Have you seen delve super prices?
---
&gt;Fun fact: robots are better at some
---
SOME, there are plenty of activities out there that are not easily automated. also keep in mind bots in each are super simple, and IMHO are only this year starting to show decent dynamic behavior, but even those can be considered very simple logic wise (no machine learning, usually identifier dependent). Where as the Captcha side increasing uses AI to detect bots. A good example is when I setup a bot crawler to trigger the google captcha for a negative test. That method worked for about 3 runs then the backend caught on and this method was invalidated, doesn't work anymore.
---
Is this old news or am I having a *deja vu*? I swear I've heard about this... idk, a year ago or something like that?
---
&gt; (the change wasn't because of balance but because each drone stressed the server and caused lag in "big" battles)
---
This is also why drone bonuses are typically 10% and include drone HP.
---
Any reason someone would want to buy my 2.7sp alt born in 2003? I got a decent price offer for him solely based on his DOB. Is there something else I'm missing? Or is it just a prestige thing?
---
Your ship should be on the center of the screen, and is marked by a small light grey "square"... I don't think you can change it.
---
He has no kills/losses since Oct 2018.
---
That looks awesome!
---
Happy for you and congratulations on your election! Hope you really get to make difference that the community in Eve-online so desperately needs! o7
---
old Chimera best Chimera.
---
it looked like a ship designed to command a battlefield.
---
new one....looks like some minmatar starbase forgot to use duct tape on a support beam
---
Yes, thank you.  But often time gray fades into the background.  Also, some times my camera is repositioned, especially when I click on other objects in space.  When I change the angle I can't find myself.  I have to switch back to my ship to view it, which causes me to loose my bearings to tpe other ships.
---
People don't brawl because you get caught and die if you brawl. Unless you have strong range control (dualprop and web), you have no way to extract if you get blobbed.
---
posting 3d printed eve ships to reddit is like a never ending karma farm
---
Goons don't understand POS mechanics, not really sure they're up to jumpclone mechanics, either.
---
It is paid immediately directly to your wallet

Idk why is this getting downvoted.
---

It's still widening.
---
Seek help. Seriously.
---
I agree.  Nice idea.

Who knew that losing space was the same as being dumpstered and having our ego deflated.

If you are getting 50m ticks in a super then you are doing something wrong
---
The only one showing any levels of autism is you. Alch yourself.
---
You’re just saving me 15minutes tbh.
---
Alphas won't be able to use t2 drones next patch too, so botters probably wont use them
---
You mean the Panfam that bled for Sort, lost supers for Sort and his shit coalition only to be repaid in him sucking goons off to save what isn't worth saving.
---
Don’t listen to them, it’s a legit warning pandemic horde has such a streamlined recruitment process it’s easy for enemies to get alts in to sabotage fleets. So be careful if you suddenly start warping randomly
---
Yeah - he cares about the game by backstabbing the last wild unpredictable nullsec alliance.  
---
Fuck that game care.
---
Let this happen 100,000 times, apply machine learning algorithm, develop super potent AI, send into Delve.
---
Same here.
---
What made the difference for me was finding a corp that operates in my timezone.  Whom had helpful players.  Offered me free ships to fly (had to give them back after the op).  Afforded me opportunities to make ISK in the game when no fleet activity was going on (ie ratting cruiser).  Also a constant use of the Eve Uni Wiki, and countless youtube videos to help answer questions.  It took persistance on my part, friendlyless on the part of my corp, and a willingness to be patient with the process of learning the game (and stop worrying about my killboard).
---
Oh boy, it's Eve Online's Going Out of Business Sale!
---
It may come as a surprise, but many people have started playing this game because "cool space game" without reading the eve encarta 25 volume set first.

I don't suppose you could tell us what they were called?

I went on a clone soldier hunt the minute it came out. It was great. I think I got like 30 or 40 random dudes in solo T3Ds and cruisers eating shit to a dual rep hecate with combat probes. :P
---
Oh, and I think I killed some npcs too.
---
Do you have your tactical overlay on ?  I get lost too sometimes but its pretty easy to right click &gt; look at ship if you camera gets focused off of your ship.  Thats the best I've found so far.
---
biomass your account
---
This is reality, and I'm not sure what other games people are familiar with (pac-man?) if they haven't seen this trend in the rest of the industry over the past decade.
---
I think everyone should experience belt ratting.
---
Ill biomass on my 1 year eve anniversary dw bro
---
... even when no one's in local. ;) har har
---
Is that really unusual? Do you have any sources for that? Sounds pretty usual to me...
---
That's sounds like a good price but I'm broke as fuck XD
---
This is a good breakdown of what's wrong there with the rest of the industry, and how applying that to eve is so much worse than in any other game. Even a moba where these dailies literally tell players to troll games and int lol.
---
What is it?
---
If we limit it to new players it'll be easier on the rest of the game.
---
WTM are still going, think the channel is "WarpToMe Incursions". Not able to log in so can't check
---
Yeah, I fly with it all the time.  I have tied also auto switching the camera as well.  I don't know why it would be a big deal to assign an icon to my own ship.  Seems rather simple.
---
No, I cant...
---
Prettynsure it is, I've also seen this before...
---
I have been pulling my hair out all day, what ship is the one that survives out of the original 3?
---
Oh man, if you were interested in selling some, hell yeah would I buy one! Love it :)

https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Skills_and_learning
---
Lots of info there. Basically the books in the market are the different skills. Then you train them I-V. You can speed it up by using implants that boost your attributes, optimizing your attributes to what your training, and injecting skill points directly with skill injectors.
---
buy skill injectors.
---
use implants that increase your attributes like perception, willpower, intellect, memory, and charisma.
---
become an omega.
---
those are the only ways to increase skill training times, short of buying an already trained character (not account, character) from another player.
---
Only Prestige, 2.7 is nearly nothing.

Seems like it was quite a bit bigger than this one.

I don't play anymore, so I have to resort to searching for "provi" every so often on reddit just to find out what's going on. :-)

Don't give them ideas.
---
Hmm I do have some praxis in asset safety Uemon, any fits you like most?
---
30mill in a carrier? Dang thats bad
---
&gt; Looking like every F2P game I've ever seen
---
then you need a bigger sample size.
---
&gt;What kind of stupid fucking idea would that be?
---
one where the game is fun to play, and the microtransactions are entirely inconsequential to the content - they're purely cosmetic and such. 
---
which, is most successful f2p games - since people don't want a game where they must open their wallet to experience the full game and/or be competitive.
---
I dig this. I know its not like PVP PVP. But I like the challenge the NPC diamond forces give. I wish there were more interactions like this so that we can be the third parties. It would be good for up and coming folk who want to practice some small team tactics.
---
Yeah like have a constant pressure against everyones citadels so it becomes annoying to defend them all.
---
It is. I think that writer and Burger talked at EVE North because there was a segment on the development of the EI.
---
Also the Massively Disclaimer...and the EVENORTH Tag...tipped me off.
---
CCP talked at some length over the evolution of the NPC AI and that there were still somethings they wanted to play with.
---
Hopefully that next step is FW AI Fleets.
---
A good mix of the solutions would be to keep base SP as-is but lengthen and broaden the tutorial and give out skills (as they already do) for completing certain objectives.
---
My dream would be a 60-hour tutorial/introduction (with the first 1-2 introducing all the game mechanics and the rest being optional fluff covering the story of New Eden) at the end of which you have the Magic 14 all to V. It would be a massive amount of story content which would get players engaged in the lore of New Eden. It would solve the problem of increased base SP making the game easier for bots, and it wouldn't be burdensome on new players because only 1 hour would be devoted to new mechanics and the rest would be some long Epic Arc.
---
They need to add this AI to FW.
---
(x2.8\*10^(10))

all of these are on my list :P

Somebody give this man the super keys so we can have a swift end to this war.

Hi Newbro -

I would give you the direct links, but I am on a computer that can't get you to this website.
---
Google -&gt; EVE Uni implants  
---
This should bring you to the EVE Uni Wiki.  EVE Uni Wiki is a great tool to find answers to most of your questions.  I highly suggest you take a look  It helped me a ton with many many things about EVE.  Good luck.
---
My recommendation is to get EVEMon and build yourself a queue.
---
Make sure you're training core skills first, CPU/Power grid management, navigation, warp drive operation 3, high speed maneuvering and afterrburner 3. Most of those are just quality of life skills, they make the game much easier to play.
---
After that, focus down your preferred path. Mining, guns or exploration and you'll find the flexibility you get from those core skills a massive improvement. One thing to note though, when you go down a weapons using path you'll want to have Weapons Upgrades and Advanced Weapons Upgrades trained up as well. There are also a number of support skills for each weapons system I can walk you through if you need.
---
Beautiful.
---
Hi fsh

I'm just talking about JF usage in general, not asset safety pickups specifically.

Eve needs smaller groups to stay interesting. Forcing people to join larger groups to "support" their Titans hurts this
---
You mean like when the game engine rolls a die to see if your guns hit, penetrate, get a glancing blow or miss - You just don't notice that your guns did nothing for x seconds when they rolled a miss.
---
Week 1... NPCs attack citadels and player characters.
---
Week 4... NPCs find long-lost legacy code for in-game browser, find a way to register for Reddit, start posting anti-goon memes.
---
Week 12... Most of Imperium running scared. Any cyno that gets lit that brings in more than 5 titans immediately spawns 300 NPC officer dreadnaughts.
---
Week 20... CCP confirms things have gone too far but won't say how
---
Week 23... NPCs rig vote and elect 12 NPC characters to the CSM.
---
I wouldn't suggest flying anything shiny solo for this
---
But a brutix navy issue that's hull tanked &amp; fit for gank or hurricane fleet issue set up for autocannon kiting are pretty good options. If you wanna try and cheese it, drake navy issue with HAM's and dual web + large ASB's can be pretty threatening.

I can drop you fits in game later if you haven't decided by the time I'm home &amp; able!

Diamonds didnt bat-phone the drifters, drifters were in the neighborhood and they hate everybody
---
I’m new too, but a good tip for this is to never use autopilot. Always right click and select jump on each gate. An even better tip is that if you jump into a system with hostiles in local chat, don’t warp directly to the next gate. Instead, find a structure marked “perch” with that gate name in it and warp there instead. The perch is probably about 1,000km off the gate, so you can see if it’s camped before you warp there to jump. 
---
So keep an eye on local at all times when traveling, and watch your corps “intel” chat channel for a warnings about systems you haven’t jumped to yet.
---
Brawling isn't really dead, you just need to know tricks like slingshotting &amp; skimming your transversal to make them unable to track so you can get close up. Warp games are also a good way to get people into your engagement range, warp to obvious celestials at varying ranges until they land right on top of you.
---
Ships good at this are like the Taranis that can sig tank incredibly well and pump out silly dps for its hull, Deimos that's one of the fastest cruisers when you run heat on it &amp; can easily tank most kiters for literally ever. The Hecate is also a great one since it can fit dual webs and combat probes for pretty much total control over how it engages, while having a &lt;2 second align time to avoid camps.
---

Look mate there's a lot of people that run incursions to fund their pvp. Incursions getting shat on is going to take a lot of content out of the game from Wormholers to lowsecbro to nullbears. 
---
There's loads of people pissed of with the general direction of the game and loads are unsubbing. Incursions getting the nerf bat is just the icing on the shit cake for some. I've not seen this many people say that they're unsubbing since the massive Jita protest of 2011.
---
Chrome remote desktop, its free, has a mobile app and is the tits.
---
Ok, I just can't let this one pass lol  
---
So, okay... Provi sucks, right? I mean, everyone always says that, even when they held the entire region and parts of Catch, too.  
---
Terrible, shitlers, just a total waste of nullsec, only there cause nobody else wants it, etc.  
---
Yet, the entire time I was there, you were also there. Except in lowsec, getting your content by riding Provi's skirts. You know, that terrible coalition that everyone makes fun of?  
---
That's the level of competition you chose for yourself. For years.  
---
I mean, that's a totally valid Eve thing to do, and you gave Provi something to do while they gave you something to do, but to be shit talking along the lines of "you're provi, do you even realize how bad you are?" when for years, your own gameplay has revolved around being the adversary for that same group?  
---
The lack of self-awareness is astounding.
---
I've got a friend or two that are going with me, Brutix navy looks good, but i dont really like ehp tanking, active and kitey are more fun. :p
---
Can definitely see my titan in there. Nice Shots.
---
No shit wizard. Gank them. Novacc is a a WH corp. Bust out of a WH and gank em.
---
I agree with most of these
---
But I feel like you could focus the Corax into a better role. Right now it's in a weird spot where the only thing it does well is tank. I think giving it a light missile application bonus would secure it into a small fleet anti-support role, for example.
---
THIS IS EVE !!!!
---
Thanks bud
---
Thank you very much for the information
---
Running a rail brutix with a command burst is a good, cheaper option then. The brutix navy can pull off the same very well but it doesn't wind up being much better than the normal version for that kind of role. Also being not blingy means more people will engage you without blobbing - which is a plus!
---
Thanks for easing my concerns
---
do you get anything besides isk and crates after level 500? i remember seeing an in-game rank for somebody who'd got to lvl 1000 in the first phase.
---
We shot a fort but didn't have critical mass to win the subcap and cap fight within range of the cva fortizar and didn't want to get into a standup dread fight at 0 since that is kind of retarded with equivalent numbers of dreads on standby from both sides.
---
Only CCP can tell, that's what the comment made was stupid.
---
ty for the tips! ill take those fits into consideration :D
---
Should whelp all your ISK by sending it to me. :^)
---
no u
---
Naw. Brits still make fun of fat fucks. Here in the US people just get fat and no one says a word cuz they're scared of being kicked out of the herd.
---
No one wanted that change.  It was originally a bug that was left in.  However, they changed something and the bug went a way, and they aren't sure how to implement it back without breaking things.
---
CCP: Scratch this. We will just introduce more triglavian or XXX faction ships.
---
One of the few ships that can name-tank.
---
"Guys help I'm tackled by an Eris"

"An Ares?"

"No an Eris"

"What's an Eris?"

Jokes aside, my corp uses them occasionally.  I'd guess for high dps on frig fleets.
---
Shoot me a mail in game and I can give you a fit for aaaalmost any ship you'd like to fly. 
---
Hope you have fun on your welp roam and happy birthday!
---
Not enough cap to keep one small repper going hurts kiting wolf really hard
---
The cap regen on retribution is so good it's like retribution has a third hidden mid slot with small cap battery fitted
---
How about some Agency drugs? 45mil for a Hardshell IV could use some adjustment anyway.
---
This one isn't perfect by any means, but if you want it DM me an address and I'll ship it out
---
First and formost, play the game you want to play.  Not the game your copr wants you to play.  If you need to find a new corp that allows you to focus on industry in exchange for some of your proceeds and services.  That being said, when you venture into more risky space, security becomes an issue, especially with mining operations.  So they may want you to contribute a bit to the security aspect of the game.  There are two concepts you just have to accept out of the gate.
---
1. You will certainly lose your ship.
---
2. Its going to feel shitty.
---
The silver lining is this, fly what you are willing to lose (especially if you are paying for it yourself).  Every fleet needs tackle, and it is the most important role to learning how to PVP.  It takes patience and it takes awareness.  There are many youtube videos on how to tackle in EVE.  The skill requirements are quite low, and you would never need to go back frigate skills to do the basic job.  If you want to make it a bit more advanced you would train for interceptors.  I generally follow the certificate plans for the frigate that matches the interceptor role.  You can't go wrong with training those skills.  Certificate level 2 or 3 is adequate for most fleet tackling.  Another role you can fill is an Electronic Warfare role.  Here are some searches on the EVE Wiki you can look up for more reading.

You should try doing the Chimera. And then when you're done, you can place it on a stand and put it on your desk.
---
Nice job, btw :)
---
It already has an application bonus
---
So is this the reason server crashed earlier today?
---
Calm down goonminer.  I recognize Goons' dominance over the economy.  His impact is still large scale considering the amount of isk he's made/destroyed, the number of systems he's camped, and the effort that's gone into it.  I'm not saying the man has GSF on its knees.  You can go back to your spod field, satisfied that your economic dominance is understood.
---
Honestly they've dealt a huge blow here in removing one of the only alpha-capable AFK farming ships. I think we need to take a look at how the June changes effect things before we start thinking it's ineffective.
---
I personally think one thing they could do in order to reduce this issue is put a time cooldown on skill injectors - one every 5 days would make training an Ishtar bot take 1-2 months with injectors and make having the bot banned a much bigger inconvenience. Not to mention now that the VNI isn't going to be very good at this basically puts the Ishtar and Dominix into that role, with the Dominix being much easier to kill due to its lower agility and both of these ships have much higher SP requirements to run havens.
---
Thanks! I plan on moving to capitals once I finish the SoE line, capitals just have so many thin armor plates that are such a PITA to print lol
---
Out of curiosity, are you doing this with Caldari Battleship V or with a lower skill level? I'm trying to see exactly how much DPS you were facetanking with this thing.
---
Do you have target motion prediction trained? It will give you a tracking bonus if you don't.
---
Aside from that the rest of the advice in the threat covers any other points I had
---
We all know that I'm not.
---
There's a space between the Exterminatus and the Illexis but yes!
---
People are assholes
---
You are correct
---
So it does - my bad. If they make that stronger it might wind up breaking the meta.
---
Maybe just one more low slot and a little more cpu, then. Give it room to fit an ancillary power core &amp; more tank or a second BCU and less tank.
---
Yeah the regen sucks ass but its guns dont use cap, so it isnt as atrocious as, say, Enyo
---
But Caracal NI got a HUGE buff with last patch. They must have carefully been planning this one as it turned the tables entirely.

Is sp farming actually profitable?  I did some numbers and to SP farm 4 injectors worth a month, you make about 1b isk profit, but if you add in a plex, or mct then there is zero profit.  am i missing something?

"He was loaded with cyno I swear I saw it"

Ideally you want one without a resident at all. Otherwise, at some point you'll have to contest the hole with that guy, and he probably knows more about wormhole space than you do.
---
If there is an existing resident you're probably better off trying to shoot that structure immediately rather than getting set up and then having a fight when you have something to lose as well.

---
It's really not that big of a deal - most of the people doing that have enough isk to afford about 6m a drone bay and buy faction drones for almost the same damage stats and increased durability anyways.
---
Though I do agree they should probably get their SP back, that's fair.
---
Week 37.. The original programmers/developers of all the legacy code come back to work at CCP due to shadowy, but credible threats against them. CCP forced to pay them due to similar threats until all decade old bugs are resolved.

Or just use them to control how many citadels are in a region.
---
The only cheap way to train skills is over time. You can use implants, specific boosters (drugs) that come out for special events, and skill injectors to speed up training, but of course, those are always in demand and can be pretty expensive.
---
Skill books are somewhat related. You start with a certain number of known skills, which you can train up to level 5. Some levels of some skills unlock the ability to train other skills that your character doesn't know yet. You need to buy a skill book and make your character read that book in order to know that skill before you can train it.

For example, once you train Light Missiles to level 5, you unlock the "Light Missile Specialization" skill, which lets you use T2 missile launchers. However, you can't train "Light Missile Specialization" right away; you need to read the skill book first.
---
Well, I guess Eris has its own 800dps niches until CCP introduced Hecate and threw balance out of window
---
My point was more if you are one of these smaller groups do you even need the titan. At the same time i'm not against this mooring ability being on fortizars I'm 100% against it being on any other structure.
---
You misspelled Primae.
---
Cybernetics(implants) and biology(accelerators) will help you train for other skills quicker.
---
Yea that was a nice brawl over a forti armor timer. No batphones involved on either side, and we actually got to shoot each other in the face for a bit without any shenanigans so that was good. - We obviously had an advantage, it being on a CVA Forti grid. They eventually elected not to escalate and retreated.
---
There wasn't really any strategic or any other importance to it, so nobody felt the need to post an AAR publicly. It's one of those structure timers generated for content, and it turned out pretty well for everybody.
---
Autocannons are the 2nd best tracking weapons in the game. You probably had bad ammo loaded (hail) for the situation at hand. Load titanium and you’re outcome will differ.
---
meh hardly a war tbh
---
That is only because the elite peeveepee guys don't want to fight.
---
And what says "cool space game" more than AFK ratting in a VNI, right?
---
There are skill injectors that let you trade "credit card" for skill points.
---
It would be better however, to not waste that on your first ever character... take the time to learn the game before throwing your money away.... otherwise you will just lose everything you have because some bad person* will blow it up.

Yeah, I'd much rather give it a bit more kinetic DPS or a shield resist bonus.
---
I think there are three apporaches to skill farming.
---
1) You can skill farm / extract toons to get 'free' Omega accounts, so that you can use them for cynos, cloaky alts, etc. Depending on the prices of PLEX, MTC, extractors and injectors, you might make a small profit or be slightly ISK-negative.
---
2) You can skill farm a small ammount of toons, with minimal effort (i.e. buying from sell orders and selling to buy orders, not timing the buying / selling etc) and combine it with some passive income activities (usually people sugget PI) and make some profit. Again, depending on prices, skill farming by itself might not always be profitable, but with the passive income from the other activities, it's generally profitable.
---
3) You have loads and loads of accounts that you skill farm. You have enough capital and time so that you are able procure PLEX / MTC / extractors at the lowest cost possible and sell the injectors at the highest possible profit.
---
The TFI isn't that bad, it's still a great heavy armor arty platform.

dreads welp pretty effectively. Waiting to see a like 500-1000 dread bomb on a supertit fleet. Stuff will die hard.
---
The only breaking news would be someone suddenly caring...
---
Yeah. It's a double edged sword. If you favor too much small ships, you might make it hard for FW groups to grow into bigger things. And I think that is what has happened.
---
What was the nerf?
---
I care...
---
I appreciate it. Thank you.

---
A war with cowards is still a war.
---
yea. based on what i am seeing, i could get a second char opn an account i want to plex, have it sp farm and be just shy the ammount of isk for a plex and a mtu, i'll have to see if its worth it.  my biggest issue is i want to use the toon for other stuff, but meh.  thanks, thats about what i thought
---
It's a 3 man corp, CEO seems to be biomassed and have only seen 1 person in the structure all day for a few minutes before DT. Might look into evicting them
---
Not wrong
---
So there is no way to actually check that the client is 64-bit and running? Like GraeWraith, I've enabled the checkboxes but I've never been sure if I am running the 64-bit client. (I have 64-bit Win10).
---
No, that's about right if you're fit to survive a drop and get saved by the umbrella.  If you aren't you have to do a lot of sites to recover the cost of your lost super.  More sites than anyone without a bot could possibly stomach.
---
What he's saying is,if you any move your Titan with 100s of other Titans, you shouldn't have one. After all, what's the point in having a Titan if you can't helicopter dick it half way across New Eden to shoot an unarmedstructure, occasionally bridge your structure bashing fleet or make a laser light show. Lern2titan non-nullblock plebs.

&gt; Imagine if an NPC reached out to you and asked for your assistance rather then you talking to them first. It would be a highly time sensitive mission obv, but cool all the same.   
---
It would be but....it would also likely blow up the servers.

The sheer volume of mail as every NPC mailbombs every player they have ever had contact with for help would kill EVE.

If you open Windows Task Manager (right-click the task bar and choose Task Manager) while the actual Eve client is running, you'll see on the Processes tab either CCP ExeFile (32 bit) or CCP ExeFile.  If it says CCP ExeFile (without saying 32 bit) then you're in 64-bit mode.

We should call this "The boring war".

When are you guys gonna be done with all the region's structures btw?
---
Why waste your precious gaming hours to do stuff in HS if you are a WH group?
---
Anything the Goon absorbs is the best addition 😑
---
Did you notice the wardec groups gaming the mechanics so that you can't actually kill the citadel and end the war like it's supposed to work?
---
Depends if we go after other sandcastles next door I would guess.
---
Truth be told, if DeadCo FC's were not stupid enough to jump battleship into bombers at every occasion, they wouldn't have burnt out themselves that fast.
---
Also a lot of the timers were lost due to the inability of deadco to cycle jammers.
---
For some people, sure. I could say the same sarcastically about any activity in the world and it would hold as much weight. But that wasn't the point. The point was a lot of people dive into the game and learn as they go, and the VNI is a path of little resistance. It is common, affordable, and accessible, and this hurts the new clueless player much more than the veteran with more knowledge, skillpoints, and startup capital. If the change was to combat botting, those same bots can just jump into ishtars, gilas, hulks, etc.
---
Does't war normally have at least 2 fighting sides?
---
same way they stop players from interring sites with stabs?
---
You would think so!
---
Yeah keep shooting sctructures instead of people. Monkey's.
---
no, that's the honey
---
the maple is corn syrup.
---
Yeah, you'd think it would be a simple thing, but the eve gui actually has very little in it's granularity (well, kinda; I'm simplifying). To my knowledge there is no difference in identifying "my ship" vs just "a ship". So, if you were able to figure out how to change the ship icon, it would change all of the ships, thus defeating the purpose of changing it to make yours stand out. 
---
If you want to learn more though, I'd recommend getting into one of the overview mod communities like ZS Overview, SaraShawa, or Rakapasersorhoweverthefuckyouspellit. They have in-game channels and Discords you can join.
---

You've made two completely unsupported statements and want to call it a day on that huh?

&gt; then you need a bigger sample size

This is what's called a casual fallacy. You simply make a generalized statement  without any sort of supporting statements to hold up your claim. 
---
&gt;one where the game is fun to play, and the microtransactions are entirely inconsequential to the content - they're purely cosmetic and such.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;which, is most successful f2p games - since people don't want to invest long term in a game where they must open their wallet to experience the full game and/or be competitive. given how many games out there won't cost you a penny to experience all of the content - i can't say i blame them when they have so many options.
---
Again, you're saying a lot, but not really saying anything. Point me to a specific example of what you're referring to and I'll be happy to continue this discussion.
---
More like "Krab Run"
---
there used to be more incursions that spawned in high sec...three i think.  in the last patch that was reduced to 1.  it is a major hit to a lot of high sec alt bank accounts.
---
Best ship design in the game overnight and without asking for it became the worst design. Of all the things ccp did why did they take this awesome looking piece of marketing and make it so damn ugly
---
Would you fuck off with the narrative pushing?  There's plenty of other threads for that without trying to force feed a newbie your particular brand of koolaid.
---
With decent skills you can do a c5 site incl drifter within 30ish minites in a solo nag. Thats about 1,2 bill an hour
---
i ran a logi alt with WTM until the last patch.  the number of high sec incursions was reduced to only 1.  with 4 incursion communities now forced to fight over sites i pictured a massive clstrfk and moved that alt over to another isk making activity.
---
What makes your brand of kool aide more valid then any other?

---
Well, you could assign all sorts of variables. Such as individual agent standing, standing with the agents corp, your standing against the targets there asking you to deal with. It also doesn't have to be every player, every time. Remember, these aren't instanced. You don't want 200 people to turn up to one area to clear one of these (or maybe you do?).
---
It in some way needs some kind of targeting system for the player to say "yes I want to take part in this". Though randomly being given a mission generated mission to go and deal with something like this is possible too, I feel like it loses a bit of the intrigue to do so.

---
C5 Dread Ratting works well for getting large injections (i.e. billions) of ISK every few days, rather than being a continuous stream of income the way nullsec ratting can be.
---
One Naglfar can take out a C5 site in around half an hour. Including the Drifter battleship, that's 550-650 million per site, 2 sites per hour. A lot of the time you'll only see 1 or 2 sites spawn per day, but that's still over a billion ISK a day for an hour's work, and then you spend the entire rest of your play time on other things.
---
At this point ANYTHING would be better. Hell I'd take metal scraps. At least they have some value.

No. Sadly level 500 is the last great reward (Marshal) I'm hopeful they add some new rewards in the future, but seeing as how were 2 years in and they almost refuse to talk about it except in that it exists... I'm not expecting much.

As long as titans can bridge, then they will be valuable to groups that can't support them.   
---
If a new ship was added that could bridge, however, then the groups that only need titans for bridging could use the new ship instead of needing a titan.
---
I know a guy who rates PVPers skill by how many Sabres/Maledictions/Bifrosts they feed per day (with their alts). 4 light tackle ships per day is considered god-tier.

Strength is multiplicative increasing, while deviation/time are multiplicative decreasing. By nature, Increase and Decrease math doesn't work quite the same.
---
The video game HardWar: The Future is Greedy featured autonomous persistent NPCs which
---
flew around doing their own thing in their own motivated interest. 
---
Some bought low and sold high, others scavenged wreckage, others would pirate those with a juicy cargo hold. There were also Faction NPCs which practiced NBSI using a rudimentary standings system (they either loved you or they hated you depending on who you killed last). As dumb as they were sometimes, they would even show a measure of self-preservation, fleeing for repairs if they got too damaged. 
---
And if you hurt them and let them live, they would remember. They would be outside your hangar waiting for you when you undocked. They would chase you down and hunt you. And when you killed them, they were permanently dead. The game would spawn new NPCs to take their place, as part of an economic simulation universe that would run itself without player input.

My long running thing was find a cap for rorqs per anom/grid. Maybe 3 as it seems like a kinda nice number. Maybe even 2. literally some blurb about how the industrial core distorts local space in a way that means having more than X on field causes bad things so won't work, OR so if you put more than 2 (or whatever) out the effectiveness of mining halves, and halves for each additional one.
---
The hit chance and hit type roll depend on ranges tracking and so on so you can work to avoid them. The ECM is pure RNG after the hull bonus and skills trained. And it also used to make your ship completely useless now you can at least shoot the thing that's ecming you.

 Strength is multiplicative increasing, while deviation/time are multiplicative decreasing. Increase and Decrease math don't work quite the same, but in a way they feel the same.
---
In both cases, you have a series of multiplier effects. +50%, +40%, +6%, etc. In both cases, they work by applying the first effect to the base value, and then applying the second multiplier to the value that resulted from the first multiplier. (Or worded another way, for decreasing effects, you apply the first effect, then apply the second effect to whatever's *left* after the first.)
---
For increasing, this means you're taking 1, +50% = 150%, +6% = (1.5\*1.06=1.59; or 59% total increase).
---
For decreasing, this means you're taking 1, -40% = 60%, -6% = (0.6\*0.94=0.564; or 43.6% total reduced).

---
Another great post. Keep them coming!!
---
What you describe is part of the problem - because this is the last way of being able to punch above your weight (numbers-wise) in somewhat reliable way. Another 9-IIBL (for those that don't remember: CO2 supercap response baited out by few dreads, then deleted by a dreadbomb) won't happen with sheer amount of supercaps being in single jump range, repeat from obliterating 20+ Rorquals in Delve AUTZ won't happen for exactly same reason, there's barely any way to heavily punish small mistakes made by individual players or FCs under time pressure. As of now, if a group gets large enough, moment-to-moment safety becomes a state (you are safe) instead of being active process, and for someone to lose something meaningful requires multiple serious mistakes made at once.

Moro’s is probably third out of the 4 non faction dreads due to range issues. Think general consensus is nag &gt; rev &gt; Moro’s &gt; phoenix

The path of least resistance will change according to the meta, as it always has. You speak as if the VNI has always existed, which it has not. Change happens, HTFU and adapt.

Realistically it would be week 1 attack,  week 2 realises the futility of attacking delve, week 3 does away with dread npcs and spawns npcs Rorqs / joins the imperium

no, I only noticed some whiny shitty corp that is afraid of going out there and fighting PIRAT. After trashing them several times they were done touching our stuff and the wardec just ran out.

---
To be honest I’m not 100% certain why the Phoenix is considered worst, I haven’t looked at the application. My gut says it’s rapid torp application is rather shit, and one of the upsides Of the turret dreads is that when the new wave spawns, assuming you’ve set up your warpins correctly, you can pretty quickly blap the battleships with the anticap fun dreads and then switch back to the avengers, which the xl torp phoenixs probably can’t do. I’ve only done a bit of testing on sisi while some characters train up into proper dreads so someone else can probably speak more to this who’s run the sites more
---
It did happen, once, because a (non-Horde) FC screwed up and the titans screwed up at the same time.  If one of those 2 things doesn't happen, nothing dies.  But it's completely fucking irrelevant to a new player, who doesn't have a titan to awox.  No one is going to "stab him in the back", and it's not a "big problem" on Horde fleets.  That was your original lie, just in case you forgot in all this goalpost moving.

Hey all I’m saying is, it does happen, you can deny it all you want but a quick google search of “pandemic horde awox” will give you plenty to look at showing it’s been a problem with your alliance for years, don’t you think someone brand new to the game deserves to hear everything about the group they just joined.

&gt; The argument about losing out or falling behind is also a flawed one. If you want to argue that then everyone who doesn't fly around with +5 implants in their head all of the time are losing out on SP they could be getting. I don't see how this is any different. It's a choice you can make.  
---
The argument isn't a flawed one in my opinion since while what to do in the face of opportunity cost is a choice for the players, which opportunity cost scenarios you present to the players is a choice *for the company*. The fact of the matter is people *have* skipped out on fights for fear of losing +5 implants. You can't create a scenario where consequences matter and then expect players to not care about the consequences. +5 implants let you acquire SP faster, so players use them. They're also expense, so players want to save them. *In some cases*, certain players will weigh the potential outcome of losing their expensive implants over the alternative outcome of missing out on a fight, and decide their implants are more important. So, if your goal as a company is to promote players to take part in as much PVP as possible, then learning implants go explicitly against that goal. You can't expect players to not care about losing them when you've designed them to be something worth caring about. The smarter move would be to have never designed them this way in the first place.  
---
Learning implants have been around since the beginning of the game, so it's just something that we've all gotten used to, even though if you step back and look at it from a game design perspective you can see how they're bad for PVP. Same goes for dailies as they were designed last time. Players can choose to ignore the SP, but CCP could have in the first place chosen to not design an event where the easiest way to complete it is to go sit at the most boring part of space and otherwise not play the game. *Some* players are going to do this, because you've incentivized them to do this. If you don't want that kind of behavior to proliferate, then best it's not to promote it in the first place.  
---
Maybe there's a way to design a daily event that incentivizes players to get themselves into scenarios that increase the odds of PVP. I thought some of the gala events were alright in that regard, since they created spaces that gave contestable prizes that players wanted to fight over. But I don't have faith in CCP to design a daily event that doesn't accidentally end up pushing players towards unhealthy behavior and/or unnecessary resentment.

Oh good idea, thanks!

Fucking cool!

Frigs are like 50m long or less, a Nimitz class carrier is 333m long. 
---
It’s probably closer to some CRuisers/BC’s
---
The problem with most Navy Battleships isn't that they are bad necessarily, but because Pirate Battleships are often cheaper and more effective due to being pirate vs navy, thus making them often pointless outside of using them for memes or tournaments.
---
Why fly the Navy Megathron when the Vindicator exists with more power and 90% webs at a lower price etc.
---
Settle!
---
This looks pretty cool, could you do a rifter or perhaps a carrier? I'd pay for one of these. Then I could paint it myself...let me know
---
So we agree.
---
looks like a real hot dog cart.
---
Lol imagine taking the ECM role away from the widow when all the black ops are vulnerable when dropped, in a  dead meta where they can’t be dropped anymore, and then forcing them to fit shield even more so and lose even more mid slot utility. All so what? Were they too squishy before? Is that why people didn’t use them? 
---
Leave them as is for AT. Oh wai......
---
You can pick one, but you'll be hated by both sides either way.
---
I have seen them using cloaked gilas
---
At least VNIs are predictable
---
Dude in the very back never anchors properly
---
Im sorry but moon changes were and are fun for me. Nothing better than dropping camping enemy mining ops . There are 3 big alliances that suffered from the changes. Pl NC. And BL the rest adapted nicely. And also it doesn’t take that much time to mine a moon and it can. Be fun if ur drunk enough lol .
---
Remember when you were limited to whatever race you started as for ships
---
Remember when you couldn’t fly battleships as an alpha 
---
Stop crying please
---
Can't you just fly an isktar though?
---
It doesn't sound like a very self sustainable source of food
---
By responding you seem to care?
---
Seems to be working for them. Look at PL / NC who were limited to vouch recruitment for the longest time. Now they've fallen behind.
---
That is awesome
---
I mean sure, you could always choose to not cater to a part of your customer base and hope your business survives anyway. But if making those kinds of decisions contributes to the downfall of CCP's flagship product, then that's on CCP for being such whiny bitches that they couldn't even temper their own egos long enough to stop leaving money on the table.
---
Yah my German hisec pals are always fun to chat with and they always buy my bulk outputs to this day. All came from randomly chatting and duelling them in the 0.6 I used to use as home.
---
My best friend in Eve and I lose touch for months or years when one or both isn't actively playing. But we always keep track. In-game buddy lists for all our alts, Facebook, Instagram even.
---
Sometimes we go a week or two without being productive or getting anything blown up because we're basically just chatting like a phone call all evening.
---
I don't often chat about Eve things at all actually unless a request comes at me or I am in a fleet. It's more like MSN or old MiRC chats for me. Last night I had an hour convo with a corpmate about nonprofit finance and legal frameworks.
---
When I get 'bored' of playing Eve (aka my head is stuck inside one or few playstyles) I really like to take on newer players than me as a mentor of sorts. They don't often corp together with me for long since we don't have organized PvP roams and rarely raid WHs together... But that's fine! They gained what they needed to move into a useful role somewhere else. Many of them have surpassed me in SP and isk, and especially PvP skills. Awesome!
---
My contacts and buddy lists are PACKED. If you want to grind in silence or get anywhere substantial as an individual... There's other games that would be more rewarding.
---
Is there a channel in game for mission runners? I'm a mostly casual player looking for a casual way to make some isk that isn't exploring all the time. I wouldn't mind salvaging for mission runners or ratters or even participating in some small time fleets when I've got the time for it.
---
I have heard of Spectre Fleet and Bombers Bar but have not checked them out yet. Is there some sort of channel like that for mission runners or ratters as well?
---
Thanks!
---
Aka "I'll pay you forty Fortizar to shoot my allies instead of me after a one month delay so I can narrative this as TOTALLY not a backstab".
---
&gt; ... but this is boring.
---
Are you in the war?
---
This is Eve
---
Lol pirate
---
don't forget the salt and fat!
---
I'm sorry but just because you want to believe it's not F2P doesn't make it not F2P. CCP announced it as F2P and when you compare it to how other games have implemented trials or a F2P option, it has vastly more in common with a F2P game. 
---
Sorry, but in 2019 EVE is a F2P game

&gt; One of the most revered holy sites of the Blood Raiders is located in the constellation OK-FEM, called the Pagera Manton. The Pagera Manton was a giant space-ship that was at the head of a massive Amarrian exploration team that had ventured into unknown lands hundreds of years ago. A malfunction in its warp-drive stranded the ship, far away from the rest of the fleet. During that time space-communication was not as sophisticated as today, and it had no way of contacting other vessels of the expedition. Years passed and the crew had finally lost all hope of survival. Food supply was running dangerously low, and it seemed that starvation was inevitable. It was then that one of the officers, an Ammatar by the name of Kalorr Makur, took matters into his own hands. He staged a successful coup against the commanding officer of the ship and had his most loyal followers bind and gag the dissidents inside a secure chamber under his control. These unfortunate souls became the crews new food supply, unbeknownst to most of the crewmembers. For over a year this plan worked, although Kalorr did have to turn to his own followers eventually to replenish his stock of human meat. 
---
Over a century later the ship was discovered by Blood Raider pioneers scouring the distant solar-systems of OK-FEM. They found the remains of the crew, and more importantly a few dozen gigantic tanks encasing millions of liters of blood. Unbeknownst to them the blood had been collected by Kalorr who dried the human meat before consumption. The blood had been meant as a final foodsource after the meat supply had run out, but was never actually consumed as the machine responsible for recycling the air supply malfunctioned which caused the remaining crew to slowly suffocate. Fortunately the blood containers were kept in sub-freezing temperature, which despite over a century of decay were still up and working when the Pagera was found. And not only that, Kalorr Makur's body was discovered in its very own container, along with his closest allies. 
---
News of the find quickly spread through the Blood Raider territories, and their revered High Priest at the time declared it a 'gift from God'. The blood was stripped from the tanks and brought back to the Blood Raider headquarters for examination and ritualistic purposes. Kalorr was cloned, using genetic material retrieved from his body taken from the Pagera, and he was immediately instated as an officer of the Blood Raiders. Years later he was even made into a saint. 
---
And to this day the Pagera is closely guarded by Kalorr and his small army of clones, extremely loyal to the Blood Raiders. Drugs, many generations of cloning and a terrible history has rendered the former Amarrian traveller completely insane. And despite the Pagera being a popular point of pilgrimage for the members of the Blood Raider organization, few venture there outside of large, heavily armed groups. Kalorr is known to pick off stragglers for his sinister rituals, no matter to which religion or organization they belong to. 
---
You can find this in-game by clicking on the OK-FEM landmark on the starmap, located in Delve.
---
We will have them mining in Rorqs in no time.
---
119, not 120, downvoted for false advertising. 
---
In reality pretty much all of these seem like good changes, I didn’t see one that was unnecessary/bad.

There's only one spawn so all the incursion communities that were spread out are now packed in to one focus. So you've got up to 6 fleets trying to run 5 sites when there's a respawn timer of 7 minutes per site. The site times are roughly 7 min TCRC, 12 NRF, 15+ TPPH. With contest which happens all the time now site times can be  
---
4/5 min TCRC 5/6 min NRF 10 min TPPH (3 rooms shit site). 
---
So even if you're in the good fleet and winning contest all the time you're still sat around waiting for spawns half the time as the respawns can't keep up with so many fleets running. Which is really screwing over the newbro communities like WTM. With losing contest all the time at peak times. They would be better of afk VNI ratting a single account rather than run incursions.  
---
Then if the focus gets popped you could be waiting 36 hours for a new one to spawn. Which is really fucking over the people who have a limited amount of time to play. As before they could login and nearly always find a fleet.  Now if they login there might be no incursion to run over the weekend. 
---
Incursions also spawn occasionally on highsec Islands. It's not happend yet but if it does it's means no one will likely be running highsec incursions for up to a week. Possibly two or three weeks as the Island spawns tend to come in waves. 
---
It's a nightmare atm i know loads of hardcore lowsec pvpers that use incursions. Just mainly for the sec status gains with the ISK being a nice little bonus. It's going to fuck those guys right up as it's going to be harder to pvp in lowsec without spending a fortune of tags.
---
So then why are people downvoting me and saying that's the old shit? XD
---
Idgaf about them but it made me think I was wrong and it had changed wtf
---
The wannabes that attempted to CSM for FW/low were not real players... just streamers and discord trannys looking for fame. If they reached out to the real players in FW we could have had a candidate.
---
Is there any way of seeing when/if skins are coming back? Specifically I'm interested in the bloody hands minmatar skins.
---
added the new 115 to fix it.
---
I don't like all of these changes and there's a few that I think are trying to bandaid mechanical problems but I can't see giving the snow globe a good hard shake as a bad thing.
---
I remember training up a Caldari for that the dank Meta4 RLML Caracal fleets.
---
I am currently printing another, hopefully better, astero for the next 16 hours but I can give a rifter a shot next!
