If only CCP was smart enough to make citadel gunning it's own rights instead of bundling into other, theft enabling rights.

---
They respawn in all systems all the time. It is very likely that they will be on timers
---
No you should play. It you stick with it long enough to start training jump drive skills, that's the point where you m might want to think like this.
---
[Yes we do](https://snag.gy/Lq0wbO.jpg), but we don't want to delay the process unless CCP refuses ArchDukes demands
---
Diaper?

Why does anyone need 200 structures?

Yes it is and has been

I had the chance several times. To be honest he is actually quite nice if he isn't in "goonswarm leader" mode. Cool guy to have a few drinks with. I think that this whole leadership persona got to him a bit too much. Now, Sion Kumitomo (who isn't around anymore afaik) that guy was a real asshole in and out of game.
---
I can echo people saying dont feel  like you have to join a Null Bloc or larger group to get into a newbro corp, but at the end of the day it's what you want to do and who you feel has been the most helpful and forthcoming about what they give you and want from you as a line member. Best times I've had in this game was when I got randomly recruited out of highsec into a random super small lowsec corp that wasn't really a newbros corp but still worked just fine. RvB, EVE uni, and brave I've heard nothing but good things about. Not sure about the north but I'll bet you'll get your playtime's worth of fun and community there in PL, PH, or NC. Not sure about Winter Co. as I've not heard anything about a newbros corp but they're solid pilots so check em out. You know what your getting out of Goons XD and I would be remiss if I didn't say I was having the time of my life in Brand Newbros (Good times, great people, someone is on comms like 24/7 to answer almost any question, we throw money and ships at new players like it's going out of style). But like I said at the end of the day they're good starting points and great resources down the line for new/returning players and most are tight knit and fun as all hell.
---
Any footage of corns fucking with drifters? Sounds interesting
---
Someone should tell iron armada they are being grouped with all of imperium's renters.
---
Removing asset safety just means you can never leave the game for any reason. Do you have a business trip and can't log in to move your stuff from a month? You just lost all your stuff and probably have no incentive to log into eve.
---

---
Are you in the military and get deployed/go on a ship? Say goodbye to all your stuff.
---
Do you work on an oil rig/North Dakota? Say goodbye to all your stuff.
---
Garric gives the same dedication to alliance apparel as he does to fleet attendance. 
---
Also who the fuck is iron armada?
---
Brave is sacrificing so many corms protecting our structures
---
Sweet work bro
---
It should kill everything, that's the point. 
---
All of the points you guys keep trying to make are anecdotal, supported by absolutely no facts. It's just a bunch of whining with any excuse you can think of to argue against the NPC changes.
---
he got reimbursed because they changed the mechanics of the site without saying anything to make it exceptionally hard and op got bopped
---
That proves absolutely nothing.
---
&gt; I lived in a wormhole for a long time, this is literally drilled into me and it should be drilled into anyone who wants to play in low/nul/wormholes
---
There is nothing admirable or interesting about having that ‘drilled in you’. Frankly it’s pretty fucking sad.
---
Well played, good video.
---
Well, at the part where you're stating that a t1 battleship can take a covert cyno. That is the exact point at which you are 100% incorrect.
---
Maybe it isn't an attempt to discourage proliferation of capitals, but holding significant regions of space with minimal effort.
---
Yeah, memes aside that's the real downfall of this event. The Drifters are punishing people for using subcaps or for being in small alliances that don't have a huge FC team capable of absorbing the burnout from never ending attacks.
---
Try making rigs.
---
Making isk on the market is hard for beginners because... they're beginners! You don't know enough about what people need and why they need it to anticipate their needs.
---
Also your bandwidth as a single player is way limited. Consider the amount of time you have to spend in a Venture to mine the ore to make a battleship. You can't vertically integrate as a lone player.
---
What is dead can never die.
---
Is this Xenuria 2.0? Did someone open that multidimensional door we swore to each other we'd never open again after the last time?

They call those "skins."
---
That's why you're given free ships to learn in and good opportunities to make isk under the guidance of experienced players. 
---
Hostile players are more of a nuisance than problem. But it is something you have to account for whenever you play
---
Fucking Nerd
---
Definitely not a botter
---
Yeah, what he said!
---
We are in the endgame now
---
&gt; Obviously if you get primaried you’ll die, but if you’re afk in null you risk dying to roamers 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I've had a character I used to farm in null a while back and I've ran incursions. It is extremely more AFK than doing incursions and I died only a handful of times and made tons of ISK. It was almost laughable. I could leave it running AFK and not even care.
---
It may not be the drifters that come for the structure timers.
---
Stay the fuck out of Covryn you fucking cuck idiot
---
Surely you can't be serious
---
You mean like 5s with the sde?
---
Never mind, Nice video.
---
There's a My-Lan (Milan) in Michigan and a Lie-ma (Lima) Indiana.

This is often how it is done anyways now, it is called a 'heavy cyno'.
---
Lol you right you right. Thought there were BS that could do covert. My B.
---
They do reach damage caps on structures.
---
Put the passwords in one password managing application 
---
Put the 2FA on the phone or hardware token
---
Put the backup codes in another password management application on an air gapped thumb drive in a fire proof safe locked behind a hidden panel that requires solving Myst style puzzles
---
1. The most complaining I see on here are from the large alliances not the small ones.
---
2. Cut down on the number of citadels you spammed everywhere. Then you have plenty to attack and defend people / time wise.
---
Chevis can you give me insight on why people deny eve dying when you can see the stats and other obvious things?
---
thanks!
---
If you don't drop citadels you wont have to defend them.
---
The culture war shall come for him too then
---
Most players don't know how to fly their own ship so this wouldn't be clear to most people
---
Because having faith in something or someone you love is part of being a human
---
 I feel like all of this could be done without the need of calling it trolling though no? Why is it Trolling to try and contest enemy territory?
---
Htfu
---
Traps are gay
---
Everything makes sense now!
---
Small bait group, I love this idea.
---
You don't need PvP fleets to pvp nor does the citadels need constant swatting since they don't follow up
---
Idk why they reimbursed you. You lost the ship because you fucked up. They shouldn't have to document every part of the game so that you can research and min max it before even trying it.

What happened to EVE sigh

When did drifters cease? They just now attacked stations in my system and systems around us in Tenerifis.
---
I think there information in that part was wrong about them ceasing.
---
solo c3 with a tengu and an industrial and a tiny pos
---
One patch to rule them all, one patch to find them, One patch to bring them all and in the blue donut bind them.
---
Might be a better fit for you. Sounds like you enjoy mindless gameplay
---
If you look at drifters killboard they have been getting an average of 120 kills per hour since downtime.
---
&gt; In your scenario all the camper has to do is hide when the defense fleet comes and resume when they leave
---
Nope. I gave specific examples to answer this:
---
&gt;If you are in a populous system with active fleet commanders looking to train newbros, you could probably convince one of them to lead a quick fleet to take a camper out. See if you can bait the camper, surprise tackle, and then your fleet can jump in to warp to you. 
---
&gt;If you’re alone and worried about the person, leave the system. If you don’t want to leave or they follow you, again, see if some other people want to work with you to run protection. Offer them some compensation for their time. 
---
Your scenario can stay a problem in your mind if you want it to be. You are free to make up whatever answer you want to anyone telling you how to deal with this problem. This is a sandbox game and there seldom single answers for all possibilities. What if the camper has a cyno and drops a cap fleet on you? You’re gonna get blown up lol. The only actually safe answer is don’t do anything is a system with *any* other players (even allies could be spies). But you won’t have much fun that way. 
---
Also, as many people have mentioned, the expenses that are expected for your progression are usually paid by the corp. This:
---
&gt; Getting blown up is not the issue. It's avoiding it long enough to buy all the crap I have to buy to progress.
---
Isn’t going to be a problem. Losing a tier one cruiser is nothing to a corp and they are likely to outfit you with another ship. A very common and good guideline for this game is “don’t fly something you can’t afford to lose” so if you can’t afford to lose a cruiser, don’t fly one. If your corp will help you get a new cruiser, then you can afford it. Simple as that. 
---
Otherwise, you’re overthinking this problem. It isn’t as common as you’re worried about.
---
Good stuff dude!
---
If the purpose is to fuck up null, it's working as intended. If it's trying to kill or treat the bot menace, it's failing. All a matter of purpose.
---
This post is a good post
---
I am... and don't call me Shirley.
---
As always sir, you are a gentleman and scholar.
---
Hope to see you at Vegas again this year my dude.
---
This is a baaaad boiii . Some call it LongClaw, and that alone might scare the drifters off.
---
You realize we have literally thousands, right?
---
If I wanted to play whack-a-mole, I'd just sit out in the backyard with beer and a shotgun.
---
"I really don't care about drifters so I ask for changes on Reddit"
---
As to the first point it's almost like large alliances are going to have more people to complain with
---
Thanks man, i 'preciate it!
---
THIS
---
You have no basis with which to argue that. You know exactly jack and shit about the effect it's having on botting. The new behavior of them warping to anoms has been active less than a day.
---
But... Es numero uno....gibue moni pliazi
---
Huehue Huehue
---
meh
---
I hope it ramps up from here.
---
Until at somepoint they suddenly switch on their doomsdays again and dunk a goon super fleet
---
As a counter to your counter, it would apply great to caps while being nearly untouchable to them. While I would love having more subcaps that can kill caps I don't think 3500m/S battleships are the answer. You do make a good point about them needing to overload but even without they still have pretty good dps. Also when compared to a Leshak, overloading is a relatively small downside to having to shoot the same target for 90 seconds.
---

This is just you being bad at JFs and wanting a buff to your playstyle, like 85% of /r/eve posters.

A) ALL plex on the market was paid for by a person @~ $20/500
---
B) 1 month of omega costs 500 plex which if you buy it means that someone paid $20 for your omega
---
C) one month of omega costs $15
---
D) $20 is more money than $15
---
E) MATH!!!!
---
I fly JFs weekly and have never lost one. I'm one of the most careful JF pilots there is, my past corpmates may very well tell you that first and foremost if you asked them about me. Hell I wrote a guide about how to move JFs safely.
---
As for freighters, the fact that they have no recourse in hisec when being bumped is a vocal complaint of mine. They also are very punishing when flown incorrectly.
---
You're rather persistent at trying to twist my argument but you're just being ignorant and unwilling to admit you've made a mistake. If you want to do so internally, that's fine with me even if I never hear a word of it.
---
This came from a comment chain about something that hurt to read. Want to know something else that hurts to read? Every word you speak and the subsequent wondering how small and short-sighted your brain must be.
---
you know I completely agree and support your opinion on this topic. CCP implemented this half ass invasion with no respect to players. We should be able to know when they are in system so that we can defend ourselves.
---
I have something I didnt report as a bug, but I found it weird. I thought I messed something up because I was drinking. I don't really know how to describe it other than I was jumping 6 dreads to the same cyno. None had any jump fatigue timers. I was waiting 2 hrs between jumps coming back to an alarm clock. The first 4 landed without a hitch. The second two got traffic control error, maxed out timers and their capacitors went to after jump status. They just sat in the same system i was departing from with traffic control. I docked them up and they were still counting down traffic control. I should have checked their fuel bay. But it was weird and i was tired and drunk so I went to bed and they jumped to final system the next day with out a hitch. Those the kind of unreproduceable errors you're talking about?
---
Damn
---
******THE ABSOLUTE STATE OF BOTTERS******
---
\&gt; Since drifters are going to behave like normal players,
---
So blue up everyone within 50 jumps and complain about the lack of content?
---
sir how do i undock?
---
No.
---
Or you can run a Jedi gas buffer and ignore the rats
---
" Yeah but even if they do armor they still have to follow up on structure " Yeah, and the more shield timers you let them make the more armor timers they have a chance to make which results in more hull timers for them to make, while allow the opportunity in the first place? It only takes them getting lucky on one shiny station for a big loss that won't be cheap to replace.
---
1) Local is cancer, and should be removed. You guys need less free Intel, not more.
---
2) Drifters aren't players. That's why they don't show up in Local, b/c none of the mission and belt rats show up either. This is PvE, get used to it. You accepted the chance to PvE when you undocked.
---
The first iteration with some adjustments could have been something. On the other hand this invisible-instalocking-ultra instinct bull crap needs to go.
---
I appreciate the support the the idea lol

Only 2 salvage modules? Horde fits have double
---
Can confirm. Was ratting in a 10mn Gila, saw drifters landing. Pulled drones, got pointed before I could warp. I even had a core stab, the single point by the battleship held me anyway and I died almost instantly.
---
I suppose I'll trade my ship for a ton of bots, but still. Ouch.
---
Our corp has 8 to facilitate industry and what not. There's just lots of corps. I could care less if drifters glassed every single low power structure, but hitting and killing them all is pointless.
---
Could someone explain what happened w Noobman to me? Ik he was a wormhole CSM, and that's about it.
---
Whine and write a shit tier article?
---
&gt; Judging by the responses a fair number of players are very happy to see the changes in game mechanics.
---
a fair number of players that are completely unaffected by said mechanic and don't have to deal with it are happy with the change in game mechanics  
---
FTFY
---
I knew someone who worked the oil fields and couldn't get reliable internet for weeks at a time.
---
All i know is its making me not log in. Fuck it. Asset safety is a thing. Let it burn.
---
It is retarded to target new players. I'm fine sitting in my rorqs, super, and titan, but its fucking up my year or two year old corpmates to where they can't do shit.
---
I probably am overthinking it. So far in high sec and low any problems I have had came with enough time to observe and learn from. So far it has been a case of controlled pace, where is if I go to null it will be both feet in sink or swim. Again it's not a worry to be killed, it's being able to analyze why and learn, and "cringe" adapt.
---
Oh, in one of those trailer parks full of oil workers? Yeah, sounds rough.
---
Aren't you guys always boasting about your amazing  intel tools and channels?
---
quite a while ago actually, it's a lot slicker now
---
You need at least that many to replace the functionality of a single large POS
---
Was that after catch1.0, I don’t remember ever shooting Test, but I was away for 11 months or so.
---
just join a smaller alliance with fewer assets to defend and enjoy the game lol
---
This meme is getting old. Resurfaces every 2-3 years like clockwork since 2003. That's 17 years of the same old Eve is dead blue donut yadda yadda yadda.
---
If you have eight to facilitate industry, you're part of the problem. Overproduction is a massive problem in the Eve economy, exacerbated by networks of blues mutually agreeing to not blow up all the stuff they keep building.
---
Way to commit sgt
---
Same, what did the nullsec groups think would happen when they threaten to ruin the game
---
&gt;The most complaining I see on here are from the large alliances not the small ones.
---
I'd argue that is be cause there are so few small alliances left in the game. Adapt or die. Years of pressure to absorb and/or amalgamate for mutual safety. Everyone has adapted or died.
---
[The abyssal space](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77612202/) one makes me a little uneasy
---
Well, when you need 1 on each moon to mine it... yeah
---
And then there's all the structures drop for sake of dropping.
---
Tapi aren't normal players
---
Thst should tell you something then
---
It's a hard knock life
---
I'll get you a screencap the mail when i can log in after my raid.
---
It'd be cool if the aniblex gates you could still scram or disrupt warp. It'd make people think twice about using them since campers would get rapey. At this point, why would a smart null Corp use regular gates when they could set up highly defended player gate systems.
---
No, your bot shouldn't be able to detect them.
---
You took full advantage of the mechanic changes that allowed you to introduce citadel spam and titan spam. Now new mechanics mean you have to make some adjustments. Stop freaking out. 
---
Have less citadels, defend your space, have more gunners. Long list of options.
---
Best thing to happen to EVE since 2012
---
So that would make you?....
---
They insta lock and dd
---
There's no such thing as AFK mining your busy busy moving materials around the ore bays
---
Who are you and what did you do to Chevis?
---
Dude saaame
---
Iron Armada is small, the drifters attack our shit, we don't post about it all day. We simply have less structures to defend.
---
That would be hilarious
---
Has anyone bothered to define the word "drifter"? 
---
... a person who is continually moving from place to place without any fixed home or job.
---
The solution: leave the space. Give them their own home. Or... everyone fly a Vagabond and join them.
---
Cormy was the first ship i got into past the Ibis.
---
'Frigates? Fuck that shit. Destroyers is more like it.'
---
And then i jumped into an armageddon with rails.
---
Don't do what I did kids.
---
You realize you need at least 3 to do every function one POS used to? And that's not counting if you want to have more than one type of moon. And what if you want better defense capabilities? And what if you want infrastructure like cyno jammers and jump gates? And what about multiple clone bays? You see how new features, and even just parity in some cases, has required a certain degree of spam? The overproduction has nothing to do with citadels, that rests entirely on the back of umbrellas.
---
Lipsum orem
---
As a new player (just started this past weekend) I must say over the years of reading about the game and semi following along with the major plots. This is by far the most interesting. It got me into the game, the first 10 hours were rough but I think I got the basics down now and I don’t think I can stop....my wife said to me the other day “I miss hearing “friendship drive charging” this game looks so boring!” It made me lul. This new era of Eve thus far is shaping up to be interesting. I only wish I started sooner.
---
There ya go. Just abandon those newbies and go sit in your capital ships and pout. Don't worry about taking initiative and actually trying to do something to help them. Pouting always works to get your way. You'll all just pout until CCP does what you want because that's what your mommies taught you.

Just the perspective of a guy who doesn't play eve anymore -
---
EVE has never had any remotely interesting content which in which NPCs play any direct part. Sometimes they may have a tangential relationship to the game content - like when someone figures out some way to exploit NPC mechanics in order to get an edge over other players. But NPCs are never the stars of the action. Nobody plays this game to interact with NPCs. You can play a million other games that do PVE better, if that's what you want. The idea of an NPC-centric storyline to EVE is completely antithetical to what EVE has traditionally been all about.
---
So yeah - NPCs that you can't just ignore sounds like a terrible idea that's just going to inconvenience most players. 
---
Of course, another huge issue that has arguably already killed EVE is the proliferation of *stuff*. Meaningful loss was a core concept of the game back in the day, but doesn't really exist anymore, because everyone is so space-rich. So some sort of surprise event just to destroy everything and make everyone poor again might not be a bad idea. But obviously, this event didn't go nearly far enough for that. There's asset safety and shit anyway. They'd have to *really* bend the rules in order to destroy enough shit to fix the economy.
---
Because there's no intent to actually take the sov.
---
lol so does undocking disqualify me from being in nc?
---
This is your brain off Videogames
---
so that you can use automatically generated random number passwords for your accounts that would take probably several years for people to crack with current technology
---
Not enough vnis have died
---
i hit yes :D
---
There should be some kind of requirement to anchor in someone else's sov though right? Seems odd that you can just say 'fuck it let's set up here' and make it hard to extract you short of dropping a super fleet on it for a day.
---
Only one way to find out
---
Are you high? No one group is ruining the game. We play together we die together. The entire universe is collectively killing the game at the same time.   This drifter thing is cool but saying one group is 100% responsible for the downfall of a game is monumentally retarded.

Song? itsagoodie
---
please name 10 small alliances affected by this
---
No. We need a better balance of the ships we already have, not adding even more factions of them. Part of the mystique of the Drifters is that you can't own their ships. Let it be.
---
What a horrible person😱
---
This post makes me happy
---
Drifters should have interesting counter play, but I don't think appearing in local is the the answer.
---
I never said that they are ruining the game I said they threatened to ruin the game to hurt ccps profits
---
Just keep your balance constantly at zero fam, works for me.

You're a player, I'm a player. Are we against increased risk? I think not.
---
I doubt that and would recommend you against it.
---
you can kill an astra with a small fleet or a few dreads, no problem. It takes about a week to kill it and only 24 hours to send it to hull reinforce and turn off services. 
---
Bigger structures take much longer to anchor/online and can usually be caught by a vigilant defender.

The main issue is timezone tanking on structures.

---
I can always tell when someone has no actual argument by the number of insults they sprinkle in compared to logic and reasoning.  In this case, you've made a determination that cloaky camping should be nerfed at the expense of wormholers.  That's a valid opinion.  Yet you can't give any reason for it other than making fun of me.  Why is protecting null miners and ratters more valuable than the wormhole playstyle?  What is so important about making null mining and ratting safer that it's worth hurting people who actively hunt and are just about the only bastion of true small gang pvp?  Use logic, use your words, and walk me through it.  I don't think you can, thus the continued insults.  But let's try.  Argue your point without insults.  Make the point without trying to demean me and let's see if it holds water.  Continued insults only embarrass you.  If you can't make a point, concede it and move on.  If you can, do it.
---
Again, this is the best expansion ever, just simply because it is utterly bananas.

I believe that you can't warp when this happens.  At least that was my case

If they randomly hit structures, including low power, that will put some on hull timers. Then players just have to bash once. That’s a reasonable ask. If they just fix asset safety, we’ll be to the promised land!

Fair enough.
---
But really, wormholers need to disrupt SovNull industry whenever possible. It just seems so boring with Keepstars everywhere. I'm doing my best to inflict ship losses in my area of LowSec and trips into wormholes. But I can't really disrupt their industry and hit them where they need to be hit. Renters in particular, if everyone in J-Space flew out to disrupted them while LowSec people picked off anyone who wanted to see what real PVP is like, the big coalitions might have to stop fueling some stuff.
---
I would like to do this. If I start a fresh character today, how long before I can reasonably begin my campaign of alliance destruction?
---
Except the part where Nullsec group have got together to try and plan out ways to actively hurt the game and hit CCPs profit because they got salty over the drifters.
---
To be fair, the Armageddon doesn't get bonuses to any turrets, so using rails isn't actually bad.
---
What about if you just want to anchor 40 faction fortizars on your keepstar grid to flex?
---
CCP: "Hey look at these nifty NPCs shooting things, its pretty cool right?"

Null Sec Blocs: "REEEE! WERE GOING TO TRY AND BAND TOGETHER TO RUIN THE GAME UNLESS YOU TAKE THESE OUT!"

---
Unironically Join Horde. We’ll get you up to speed on eve 2k19, and you’ll have fleets for all types of content to find out what you like.
---
For Now just grab a nice cheap astero and do Explo. Save your iskies.
---
 In the future, move to null and get a ratting carrier and print money by crabbing.

Unfueled abandoned athanor... this is what they SHOULD be doing

Eve player count is steadily going down. The recent patch resulted in a massive slope of online players. Stay tuned

Why would I need so many accounts and codes. what do I do with hundreds of alts. How do i even play them.

Tbh the Drifters would enjoy you going against the flow, probably - the Trigs are the ones with all that, the Deviant Automata are Rogue Drones, and the Drifters are actually “Ancient Enemy Azdaja”, the Trigs HATE THEM

It has drifters and players on it. The final blow was a player.

Shut up and take my money!

Only today are they spawning so much and so often. Im pretty sure it will be different tomorrow
---
All those dead VNI's, its like music to my ears.
---
Wait a second, what does one have to do to get access?
---
&gt; Sounds like you enjoy mindless gameplay
---
The drifters are clearly galaxybrain gameplay.
---
I rather be fucking up player fleets than red crosses. The ratting is a means to an end to feed my PvP habit that doesn't involve whipping out my credit card.
---
Oh Hello Out of Context Cathy, we've missed you.
---
Because they want to mine 200 moons
---
There's no PvP fleets because reds are preoccupied protecting their space from AI than to come try and take ours.
---
Can’t really warp titans around the system chasing the drifters everywhere, though. And supers are more effective than titans anyway, since these drifters don’t like to stay still
---
Stop huffing glue.
---
Killmails with NPCs and Players both on it will ALWAYS show a player having the final blow, even if it was the NPC that killed him. An example of this was a time in Lowsec where I was tackled on a gate in a PVE ship by an Interceptor, he lost point on me and while in warp I got his killmail and it said I had the final blow, even though the gate guns did the killing.
---
/thread
---
Hey, im a really trustworthy awesome guy. Let me have permission to rip out the 50B rigs in your XL structures. TIA
---
You are off a little about the difference between super/carrier ratting and VNIs.  The fighter  system and interface is at the top of my list of things CCP has gotten (mostly) right.  It requires pretty much your full attention to micro manage a super, and people sometimes multibox two carriers on two screens but that's about the limit.  VNIs, on the other hand, are pretty much AFK machines if they are used and fitted for that.  CCP of course did what CCP does, which is whack the out of control meta with the nerf bat after it's been abused for a long time, instead of dealing with the underlying problem, which is the automatic nature of drone use.  I was taught to abuse this as a tadpole running level 4 missions in a Domi way back in the day.  Later, I don't know if the Goons came up with the AFK Ishtar but they certainly popularized it.  Now we have VNIs and Rorquals. After the VNI nerf, watch for more Ishtars and Domis, at least until they get through nerfing those again, at which point they will be unusable.
---
I wish CCP could be more creative in their fixes rather than just play wackamole with the nerf bat.  Maybe remove the aggressive drone setting from any ship with a drone damage bonus?  Or how about giving the Rorqual the fighter interface for Excavators, you have to manually tell them what to mine and then come back and unload.  Ships that operate with minimal input are ripe for botting because it makes the script so simple.  And I know that people bot supers so it can be done, but it's all about raising the bar.  It also might actually make for more engaging gameplay, who'd of thunk it?
---
You have no idea what you are talking about do you?

I mean we have 2 of those...

If it takes npc's and CCP do what real life people should do but don't because they think eve is Farmville, awesome. Keep it going ccp.

Not to hurt CCP or to kill the game, though. Just to give the hiseccers a taste of what an annoying force attacking all of your structures is like. 
---
Except, unlike the drifters we will follow up on timers and win battles, so it should be a little worse for them. 
---
But no one is going to quit because they’re structures got bashed. They’ll probably just move to null or use nullsec owned structures

Exploration, buy a Astero, fly.
---
Well, you have a Garmur. So the game shouldn’t have changed that much for you since then. 
---
200m SP and you not self sufficient? If you planning to plex your account, sell some of that SP if you are in desperate need of isk.
---
You could join corps like PH, Karmafleet or Brave Newbies. They usually accept new players, but also vets that have moved on to casual because they cant play too much anymore, etc. Plenty of pvp at all times in those corps, at least on PH case. In PH some new players in isk-making sigs make like 80m isk per hour. PI chars can easily plex an account with null access. If you have a bit of ISK already you can do some station trading. Like mining? Now you can moon mine as well.
---
TBH, its very easy to make isk on this game, even as a casual.
---
With underpowered hardware. It's hilarious yet sad that people buy them.
---
United Federation of Conifers. And that’s really the only small nullsec alliance I know of outside of Provi, and I haven’t seen any drifters in Provi yet
---
Unless said PvE environment is acting in ways it shouldn't be.
---
Join a wormholer corp on day one as i did, train to fit a rattlesnake to go ratting and explore to make the isk to afford it when it's ready.
---
Your opinion is pretty much what everyone else wants, but CCP went the lazy route and made anomalies impractical to do when every single one has a high chance to reward a very quick death.
---
send me 1 billion and i'll double it
---
Yeah and u have constant fear of neuts comming to system - and now the drifters too. If 4 of then can kill a hel, how few they need for my loved thanny
---
Or join a wormhole corp and print money by crabbing and killing crabs.
---
Oh I didn’t know that
---
/r/facebook
---
My words are simple. AFK cloakers are pathetic and a stain on the game. Don't you agree people should actually be at their computer to justify camping a system for 8 hours? As to your wormhole life, nothing would change. You cloak when you want to cloak. I see no reason why you would want to AFK cloak in wormspace for 8 hours. Maybe you know something I don't know, but I can honestly reassure you that fuel in cloaks would not affect you one bit. I can run my fleet assistance mods for a month with the charges I put in. The fact that I don't run them non stop is why that works. Get it? 
---
Add fuel or charges to cloaks and the game gets better for everyone. Unless your name is WormholeGank and can't deal with the extra isk and effort. Cloaky campers will still be there, they'll just need to refuel. Seems logical and acceptable by most. If you weren't such a baby you'd see that. 
---
Oh I'm sorry. Did I insult you again? I can't help it. You keep responding like a tween girl, what choice do you give me? Just move on... because thick heads like yours won't ever see improvements for the game without crying about their selfish playstyle.
---
There is a difference between adding more danger and uncertainty, and a straight up Deus Ex Machina "you are dead with no saving throw" mechanic.  The game can use more of the former, while the latter is just bullshit.
---
"FLEX" stands for Fast Logistical EXpansion structures, which include Ansiblex Jump Gates, Tenebrux Cyno Jammers and Pharolux Cyno Beacons. They differ from regular Upwell Structures in that they require Infrastructure Hub upgrades to deploy, they take less time to anchor, less time to destroy, and if they are in Low Power you can kill them in one go without needing to wait for a second reinforcement timer.
---
It doesn't get any bonuses to rails, but it also doesn't utilize any benefits.
---
This was before the Armageddon was a drone boat.
---
So nothing was destroyed but everyone is out for revenge?
---
You could have written a more accurate and honest article with one sentence.
---
All you needed to write is:
---
'A few butt hurt manchildren who don't log in are sperging.'
---
Caps are way more vulnerable and way less agile now too. If they drop caps, you just warp away and tackle something else.
---
but i enjoy stepping on legos. pain is pleasure
---
Caps used to be able to take pos JB's supers and titans as well.
---
Ghost sites are actually fun though.
---
Truly fresh? No skills or any sort of experience on the game?
---
dolor sit amet.
---
My path to the game is almost identical to yours, except that I deliberately stayed away until 3 days ago. Now I remember why I stayed away. 3 days with no sleep :D
---
Also agree that on the effective outside looking in, this is exciting times.
---
Same with a fuckoff dickstar JB pos that didnt even need a gunner
---
I can fight players, I can't fight AI that does Dreadnaught damage that move and track as fast as interceptors and appear out of nowhere with no warning in local or D-Scan and can point me from 100km with instant locking.
---
Got a little Federation green on there in the end.
---
Buy 100 cockbag Thrashers.
---
!
---
Ah, so pretty much the structures that were made to replace the functionality of POS modules.
---
Wormholes are spoopy and weird.
---
Uh, you still need to take gates if you want to go more than one system away. You can only have one JB gate in a system, so they have to take gates between JB to go up or down a pipe. Jusy camp the gate in the middle of a JB pipe
---
Stront timers that were staggered off timezones so you could (fairly reliably) force it to come out of RF at a time favorable for you instead of 24 hour intervals.
---
They changed that a little while ago iirc
---
Defending what you put in space?  I’m curious too that I’m a citadels baby
---
Never really done any wormholing but the concept sounds pretty interesting.  Will look in to it
---
If you know the gate is clear, warp to 0 and jump immediately. If you don't know for sure that the gate is clear, you should warp to something safe within d-scan range (like a planet) of the gate you're going to so you can scan the gate to see if anybody's there. If it's clear, warp to 0 and carry on. 
---
If you frequent a specific area of nullsec you'd be well off to take advantage of finding clear gates to make yourself some perches. This means going to the gate, then flying straight up for at least 250 km, but more is better. Say 500 km. Then save a bookmark. Now when you're warping around, if you think/know a gate isn't clear, you can safely warp to this perch. It's far enough away that anybody on the gate won't be able to attack you immediately and you can get a good look at what's going on to assess the situation. Is it one ship camping the gate by itself? Are there bubbles? Where are they? Or is it a big gate camp? Useful to know. Don't sit on your perch too long or they might come for you, but it's very convenient to have.
---
Maybe you haven't been around, but do you remember when Reddit was convinced that the massive sprawl of null alliances was killing the game? I'm not defending dense or sparse populations. I just wonder if you know that we've seen this before. Time is a flat circle
---
Not the size we have today. You are correct in saying that that Era birthed the idea of them, but cancer doesn't kill a patient overnight. It didn't start affecting Eve until it hit a critical mass around the time period we were talking about. That's when Eve started to slide.
---
Ah right, I had no idea that was the case.
---
https://i.redd.it/odxxizfhvx331.png
---
That's correct.
---
Since drifters don’t finish structures, they aren’t doing much to reduce spam.  What they are doing is putting some risk back in the nonstop anom farming in null.  You can tell who the real nullsec players are - they adapt.  It’s mostly the nullbears who are providing the salt.  Those complaining about endlessly manning citadel guns, I empathize, those complaining they can’t rat - HTFU.
---
shoutout to the rookie ship showing up to do 3000 damage
---
What if they just gave structures one life and made corps defend them? Yes we would lose ton of structures but would it make the game better long term? It would pile everyone up for sure!
---
I wish I had some gold for this comment right here.
---
Reinforcement lasted 0-36 hours depending on how much fuel was in the POS. So you could attack it outside of your normal tz for the first fight and when it was vulnerable again it would be in your tz, unless the defenders had managed to change the amount of fuel in the tower in time.
---
Google sheets with the GESI plugin.
---
If that was the intent, they kind of failed. These NPCs don't follow up on timers so they aren't so much cleaning structures up as they are keeping null sec dudes too busy blapping NPCs to go out and fight each other.
---

Non NPC nullsec should be able to be bridged to and dread bombed from NPC null. 
---
You should have to online a cyno jammer and thus be vulnerable to tackle and roaming gangs if you dont wanna get dreadbombed
---
There should constantly be an existential threat to any ship undocked in nullsec. 
---
However the boogeymen in any case should never be NPCs, but other players. And those players should be able to moonwalk out with profit if they sucessfully kill you
---
Its not about having safe space to farm. Its about the power to hold vs the power to take. 
---
A vigiliant standing army might be able to hold safe crabbing space, but at the cost of putting thier own standing fleet in danger.
---
Cant be hard to defend your space with Stannis Barstheon as the FC.

---
They might quit but honestly the null sec groups are banking on some of that I think.  But they wont move to null.  They might use nullsec structures.  But this whole idea of giving high sec a taste of the suffering is foolhardy and won't really do anything that hasnt already been done before.  eve nif it did, all its going to do is push high seccers further into CCPs side as null seccers are the bad entities having a giant temper tantrum (and that's really all it is.)  No one forced Null sec to kill their own content, they did that themselves with completing the blue donut.

If this is their idea of fighting citadel spam, it's not working.  It's just taking time away from people doing what they want to: fight each other.
---
So now we have NS alliances dealing with BS instead of fighting one another.  And there is still 1000000000000 citadels.

Really!? You play Tarkov 😏? . Hehe I get it they are unbalanced. But don’t they make the whole experience better

No, they really don’t.  Because random inescapable death isn’t fun.  Which is why competent game designers give you some way to counter even their hardest bosses.

---
Pretty sure being under attack from the majority of Eve will be a lot worse than a few hisec merc alliances bashing stuff. For starters hisec mercs don't have the motivation to burn hisec to the ground, they defend the bigger players and bash anyone who tries to compete. So far all nullsec has cared about is controlling the plex market
---
&gt;No one forced Null sec to kill their own content, they did that themselves with completing the blue donut.
---
We had 2 wars going on, involving pretty much all major alliances, and a few small ones involving smaller alliances (Conficers vs Snuff, Provi vs HTP/TRC), until the drifters showed up. Now there's pretty much nothing major going on.
---
Question, was EVE exclusively a pvp game?.
---
Where can you safely sell a character for $?
---
This would explain a coupla things, actually. I was wondering what would have happened if no one had been present to notice what was going on.
---
Oops, I accidentally an event apparently.
---
Yes. Their attacks are random, so they *can* hit structures vulnerable to final attack if the timing is just right/wrong. But they haven't, as a rule, followed up on their timers. At least not so far.
---
Judging by the fact there is no fitting on that Athanor, I'm guessing they happened upon it during it's anchoring repair timer. With so many structures spammed in the world, it's kind of inevitable.

I think you are making general statement base on your own taste, there are a million games where unstoppable death is the focus the the whole game and they provide fun experience for those that enjoy it. 
---

---
If nobody had been present, it would have RF'd the fort and they probably would have bragged about it somehow in a world news article. heh.
---
What?
---
Horde standing fleet tends to roam, so if someone's hanging out in a system we control, the fact that they're there has probably been reported to the intel channel. That said, don't neglect basic safety. Keep an eye on neuts and reds in local and ping dscan regularly. It's difficult to catch someone who's alert and ready to run away.
---
Lol Majority of Eve, its definitely not, and go ahead and burn all the structures, they are not the only things there to operate in and out of.  
---
The wars from what I have heard were winding down anyway, they made the CHOICE themselves to pull back from them and then to blue up entirely.  It was an active choice that is on them and no one else.  They have only themselves to blame.
---
&gt; I think you are making general statement base on your own taste, there are a million games where unstoppable death is the focus the the whole game
---
I think you keep skipping over the very important word “random”.  ‘Cause that’s actually the most important part of the problem.
---
are we really pretending "completely unannounced change, but uh, your ship has a chance to just randomly fucking explode now" is a good game mechanic?
---
if these things were d-scannable, appeared in local, or could be fought off - hell, even combat probed - they'd be fine going into sites. as it stands, they enter your site, you just fucking die. through no fault of your own, you just die. 
---
there's no content being created here for anyone (no, refitting a replacement ship is not content), but it *removes* a lot of the content as it actively disincentivizes undocking in anything ever. the problem was that null was already underpopulated except for under the umbrella, now we're adding content that [checks notes] punishes you for no reason unless you have a fleet on standby ready to save you? uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
---
so are you part of the problem or?
---
The scan res differences date from a time when turrets had infinite tracking.
---
Realistically, ships should probably have locktime calibrated relative to their own class.  ie, cruisers lock other cruisers fastest, generally
---
What I'd have wished to see different among the hull classes is different D-scan ranges for non-specialist ships.  Perhaps it could be revisited in the 64bit update.
---
Yeah I guess it's all about the intent of CCP right? If they intended the sites to be random, then get bent. But if they own up to it being a bug, reimburse away.
---
INB4 Tyrannos finds out what a sov wand is and how is made from dead drifters...

Did we piss off CCP?
---
With a civilian gatling laser. The balls.
---
It has been 7 hours already, Apollo. I went this imposter's head on my bridge by 1800.

The fact that they reimbursed indicates it was not intended behavior. I get that you're a fucking goon but try to keep up sweety.

You really don't want them to be following up on *all* the timers, it would be a complete mess.

I know it has shaken up many comfy krab zones and people are reeeeeeing over it but imo we needed something like this to force people to actually play the game rather than afk krab (*read as : bot*) 23 x 7.

nah if citadels dropped all the goodies contained within people would go after em.
---
Asset safety is a load of shite.
---
They can be destroyed if you’re ratting in a capital.  Otherwise, you don’t have enough EHP.
---
You’ve got roughly half a second from when they appear on the overview to enter warp.  Since your brain has been rendered into mush by the mindlessness that is ratting, missing that half second is pretty easy.  Plus the game sometimes decides to take a little longer to get you into warp even when you are aligned.
---
And since they don’t appear on dscan, you can’t just mash it to give yourself more warning.
---
So, you’re doing the poorly-designed grind to make money for PVP, and “you die now” randomly appears.
---
And the benefits r/eve jumped onto like “they’ll kill citadels!!” aren’t actually true, so there isn’t even “at least they’re doing something good” to make your random death somewhat worthwhile.
---
Or you just rat in a super.  Though most here would probably not be thrilled to drive even more players into caps.
---
Its at the lowest its been for like a year
---
Bravo!
---
&gt;  Majority of Eve, its definitely not
---
The majority of active players are in nullsec. 
---
&gt;The wars from what I have heard were winding down anyway
---
The northern war was winding down, but winding down would have meant a lot more good fights for both sides since there wouldn't be the massive goon superfleet denying any real content. With it moving home NCPL still couldn't drop their own or they'd get counterdropped, but goons also wouldn't be using half a titan fleet offensively. Between that dynamic providing good fights between goons and ncpl and the war between ncpl and gotg, there was going to be plenty of stuff going on in the north.
---
Meanwhile, the southern war wasn't winding down at all. If anything it was going to be scaling up. Test had taken one ihub, so they had a foothold to move forwards and Frat had a strong incentive to take it back, and I was looking forward to see how that would play out. Now it is on pause.
---
There was also the Snuff/Init attack on the United Federation of Conifers, that is still going but in a much smaller way now.
---
The choice was either keep fighting and hope drifters don't do anything big, or to fall back, go to the Winchester, have a nice cold pint, and wait for all this to blow over. Everyone chose the second option because if the drifters suddenly start spawning in every system, ignoring reinforcement timers, and doing other weird things that shouldn't normally be allowed, we wanted to be ready to fight them off. You can't wage a full on nullsec war with this going on, and no one in nullsec likes it, so they mostly decided to work together to get ccp to end this sooner. We aren't attacking hisec because we are in a permanent alliance, we are attacking hisec because we want to get back to fighting.
---
Ships are ammo. Important to get anything done but ultimately disposable. Corps know this, so don't be afraid to lose ships. All the big newbro corps (Horde, Brave, etc.) have ship replacement programs or ships on contract. When, not if, someone gets the jump on you and blaps you, chill. If you can, get your pod to safety. If you get podded, oh well. Check the killmail to see what they used on you. Shoot them a message asking what they did, and how to avoid it in the future. Some people will oblige, some people won't. Be polite, don't take it personally. The only way to learn is to jump in.
---
A new hero in troubled times.
---
Time to start manufacturing again boys
---
you got something wrong, we were not their content they were ours.
---
Well most of the audio clips from nullsec leaders tend to place the focus on getting hisec and lowses player to unsub and quit so ccp learns a lesson, but I don't see many hisec players then moving to null or using null owned station.
---
I just really want to know if explorers/combat explorers are getting dragged into this 
---
 :/
---
12 sec take it or leave.
---
Totally true, but JBs had fatigue which meant they weren't as commonly used and weren't the only route of travel for locals.
---
I fail to see any logic in that. You are saying because CCP made nullsec more dangerous (as it should be) that highsec needs to be punished for it. That’s honestly a pretty child like move.
---
You mean the Krabs are logging off leading to less capital proliferation and null blocs are suffering losses/hemmoraging high sec refugees? Oh no.
---
It has begun

&gt;they hope to meat their goals
---
giggity
---
Aye, there's been quite a few of us that have been screaming at CCP to fix battleships forever \*hell Mr hyde was a fucking CSM almost SOLELY on that issue!\*  
---
i was flying BS's mostly over the last year and a half. and it HURTS man. 2au warp. or you have to give up 2 rigs AND your slot 6 implant for a 3au warp speed.
---
  
---
for the warp speed. 2.5au wont break anything. at all. tbh, i once advocated for them having the same warp speeds as battlecruiser \*or maybe just 2.6au\*  
---
Lock times.. A battleship can still be permajammed by a flight of hornet ec's. it takes you 20+ seconds to lock the damn things.  
---
oh hey just fit a smartbomb to fix the issue.. right? Except thats the NEXT problem
---
they suffer from lack of mids OR utility highs in alot of cases
---
Abbadon/apoc/mega. 4 mids. 0 utility highs.  
---
shield tanked ships \*mael/rokh\* have the same issue. once you put in an actual shield tank. they have maybe 3-4 mids left. and STILL no utility high.  
---
The rest are reasonably fine cause they'll either have a mid Or a utility high \*or both\*  
---
hype. 5 mids. 1 utility high.  
---
armageddon 2 utility highs.  
---
Raven? Utility high \*same mid issue as other shield tanked ships, if somewhat negated cause lawlmissiles\*  
---
Tempest? 5 mids AND 2 utility highs \*sologasm\*  
---
phoon? 5 mids. utility high.  
---
Dominix? lawl fucking drones op totes 6 utility highs ;) (and 5 mids btw)  
---
For the ships with no utility highs. and 4 mids (and in the rokhs/maels case. 3-4 mids left after shields). Give them a utility high. OR a mid. i dont care which.  
---
I would love CCP to actually fucking fix theese, but i mean. cmon, fuckers haven't even fixed citadels in 2 years now. haven't fixed citadel spam, hell havent fixed the damn loki (yes i know, people disagree,  bite me).   
---
They aint gonna fix it. But hey. prove me wrong CCP, i dont like always being right.
---
It's also the way to get things killed.
---
Sure it's rough to kill supers and extract cleanly but people are going to do dumb shit with supers and caps.
---
There's always eyes watching and people will slip up...causing death to someone's supers.
---
Thank you for explaining, they are terribly unbalanced and you have seconds to leave an area before they nuke you.
---
I can totally see how that would annoy the hell out of anybody.
---
Haven’t played EVE in years to be honest.
---
But the idea of SC is that the Vanduul do NOT hide, so you could have your sensors on active and see them coming and run your ass off. Or fight, but they are supposed to be scary. That’s the idea at least.
---
I guess I like the idea, but the execution seems not very fun.
---
Thank you dude
---
...we've also learned that it's fun to gate camp in between structure reinforcing. Thanks to Lancers for creating all those warp-to bookmarks around things for the last four years.
---
Drifters, and I cannot stress this enough,
---
#TAKE MY MEAT
---
REMOVE LOCAL!!!!!!!
---
   Seriously though, make it like WH space.
---
You'll like it here.
---
You still need to take regular gates to go more than one jump. Camp those gates and you can still catch travellers.
---
yea what the fuck is the point of my short range blaster if I can't track shit for fuck sake.
---
A small price to pay.
---
&lt;&lt;This twisted game needs to be reset.&gt;&gt;
---
Yeah, if only they would log in for engaging PVP content... Oh wait
---
are they though
---
You got that wrong, that is not content.
---
Given that Astras are 1Bn a piece, Tataras and Raitarus are even cheaper, and structure spam has reached planetary-Dyson-Swarm levels, I'd say "losing a lot of structures" is *exactly* what this game needs.
---
Wow you weren't exaggerating. The first page of kills only goes back 20 minutes!
---
I’ll give it to you guys, super sneaky and quick.  Been dropped  running tinker rattles. Spamming Dscan the whole time, thought I was safe-ish with a crit hole so I didn’t bother with the scanning alt. Big mistake...Dessies....fucking dessies everywhere
---
This is a pretty stupid idea. It renders KB stats basically meaningless since rats don't play by the same rules as capsuleers and can effectively cheat.
---
 
---
1. they don't give fatigue like the old ones.  
---
\-Jump Bridges didn't give fatigue to begin with (i believe they put fatigue in when they nerf'd the shit out of capital jump drives)
---
2. You cannot stop people using them; previously you could bubble and point a ship to stop them taking it, now only them agressing prevents jumping.  
---
\-I'm pretty sure HIC scrams can still stop you from using the new JB's but will have to experiment on this
---
3. Caps can take them, very minor IMO but a difference none the less.  
---
\-Most of the old Pos JB's i ever used had Cyno beacons on them as well, so that didn't change anything....
---
#WHBOO!
---
or limit sebo usage to battlecruisers.
---
Triangles the old and busted, Tyrannos the new hotness.
---
&gt; You are saying because CCP made nullsec more dangerous (as it should be) that highsec needs to be punished for it. 
---
Have you looked at the /r/eve and the various forums lately?  There's a tremendous amount of schadenfreude aimed at null in general, and the Goons in particular.  I would be surprised if the response isn't at least partially intended as a "fuck you" to the Greek chorus online.
---
We all float down here. You'll float too.
---
Which would instantly kill eve. Not just because everyone looses the stuff they worked hard to build, but because with no commitments, most veteran players would finally be free.
---
&gt; The majority of active players are in nullsec. 
---
This is objectively incorrect.
---
&gt;The northern war was winding down, but winding down would have &gt;meant a lot more good fights for both sides since there wouldn't be &gt;the massive goon superfleet denying any real content. With it moving &gt;home NCPL still couldn't drop their own or they'd get counterdropped, &gt;but goons also wouldn't be using half a titan fleet offensively.

---
I'm just calling BS on this and I doubt this would've happened.
---
&gt;Meanwhile, the southern war wasn't winding down at all. If anything it &gt;was going to be scaling up. Test had taken one ihub, so they had a &gt;foothold to move forwards and Frat had a strong incentive to take it &gt;back, and I was looking forward to see how that would play out. Now &gt;it is on pause.
---
Okay ill give ya this one, but Test and frat are so freaking huge that I would argue they could fight each other and the drifters and still be fine ( especially with how timers work).  So it was still their active choice to do so.
---
I absolutely disagree that you cant wage war and deal with the drifters at the same time if you one of the big bad tough null blocks.  No they made an active choice to blue up.  Attacking hi sec will not get you back to fighting, it will in fact piss off the ACTUAL majority of the player base to just disagree with you more.  Congratulations by their own actions null sec is killing the game by their sheer entitlement and childish attitudes.  
---
I also believe this is a temporary world event heralding the storyline apocalypse so this is probably a storm that will indeed blow over.   
---
This is purely overreaction by Nullsec.
---
Gaaaaah *just* after a two week audit for me or I'd be calling the jumpseat on one of my friend's Aer Lingus flights.
---
You don't even have to fully remove it. Just delay it 20s, or replace system-level local with constellation- or region-level local so that you can't instantly see when someone hits system.
---
&gt;You took full advantage of the mechanic changes that allowed you to introduce citadel spam and titan spam.
---
This!

Sometimes you eat the bear, sometimes it eats you.

Oh No! ThE BoTs aRe lOgGiNg oFf!1!1!

&gt;You accepted the chance to PvE when you undocked.
---
Tell Goons that.
---
If you undock and actually fly around, you can easily tell where they are.
---
But HiGhSeC bAd!
---
Sandbox, letting us blue npcs would allow other npcs a reason to attack. Content. Unless your a tool.
---
How many characters?
---
LOL but you don't get it, people who live in null don't like it and they are part of the other tribe so I, the person gloating on reddit, must love it.
---
Which audio clips?
---
I was looking at this one: https://i.imgur.com/Jz2YPZ6.jpg
---
 Damn you thought me a new word ‘Schadenfreude’ thanks dude. 
---
     Yeah I’ve been at least on r/eve getting a laugh out of the salt and shitposts this past week. I would have to agree with the partial ‘fuck you’ I mean goons already embargoed highsec as is pretty quickly after the hate started showing its face stronger on this forum
---
This is not your private page.
---
No one is going to unsub because their structures got bashed or because nullsec stopped exporting raw materials. Its just going to be an annoyance for them, the same way drifters are for us
---
Fun? FUN?! BROTHER, WE ARE AT WAR. WE ARE HEAVILY OUTNUMBERED. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK ARE YOU DOING RUNNING AROUND HAVING FUN?
---
Yeah because you get insta locked and killed when they literally appear on top of you, no descan,  no warning, no counter play. Just fly a super or above this is literally the solution we need more supers in null
---
Maybe the issue is how caps apply and nuke battleships?
---
I sold my four rorqs and extracted those characters just before the last rorq changes. I rarely krab because I have enough isk stashed away to last me a while. I pretty much stopped logging in since the drifters started appearing because I fly a lot of blingy subcaps with implant sets. I don't want to lose a marauder or DED fit force recon or T3C (and the SP) to RNG. Many of the few people that actually still pvp in this game are the ones running around trying to put out fires right now. That means there are less people out in space making or being content for others. They're either manning guns in a citadel or not logging in at all.
---
Those are both way more solid then removing it. I can see it as a compromise for both sides of the local coin. I will say now that you’ve put that idea in my head I would have to lean towards the region or constellation level.  Entropic disintegrator to your head, what would you pick?
---
Skill goo farms? VNI alts? Cloaky cyno campers? You can do what you like with then but not having 2FA and bad password management can leave you open to serious risk of a breach even if it is only a game :)
---
So that high seccers hate you even more and side with CCP even more and just call for this more.  Your plan is bad.  Alot of this also stems from the utter entitlement of Nullsec in this.  Maybe drop the attitudes and just appeal to high sec instead?
---
Case in point, a battleship with a doomsday.
---
It's a sandbox. No group can actively hurt the game. Why don't you just adapt or die?
---
Um hey Orion, you heard her, back to work.  
---
Just you capsuleers wait until the commencement of the next seven day cycle when the capital Tyrannos arrive.
---
Is there a way to pull a RSS feed off zkillboard of a specific corp or alliance?
---
Only supers and above can survive in null atm without it being Russian roulette..  So if you're worried about capital proliferation now... Haha give this a lil time
---
Good lord, do you have the file for the print? That looks amazing!
---
Can’t tell if post good, or post bad. Take an upvote for effort??
---
I don't understand this. What are the null seccers going to do to high sec? You can't blow up Jita 4-4, can you? Are they just going to fly around and suicide gank every single high sec ship they see? Or are they going to try and do something more abstract like embargo T2 modules and ships?
---
you mean getting yourself banned?
---
I still don't see it: https://i.imgur.com/nh76jBG.png

Actually, after refreshing a few times I was able to get what you see. Your screenshot is an artifact of when the data was sampled for the last data point on the graph. If you hover over the data point you'll see it's from 04:10, which is always right around 17k. It's one of the 2 slowest times of day for EVE and always has been.
---
It's important to understand the data you're looking at, rather than just looking at the line on the graph and drawing conclusions.
---
Fuck ccp. Ready to unsub. Maybe for good. I'm sure I'm not the only one either
---
So the differs are basically the reapers resetting null? 🤔
---
Good way to make most of null unsub. BTW, null is at least 50% of actual players
---
But...but they don’t show up for timers!!! Rrreeeee!!!!!         Did I do it right?
---
Good shit though, get those sandcastles boys
---
You'll float too

F I live on the bourbon trail

Iv already won m8

good luck logging in when they turn off the servers lol
---
We're going to stop exporting raw materials to cut down on hisec industrialists ability to make isk, and also bash all the hisec industry structures that we don't own. I don't think there's much more of a plan than that yet, it is still in the planning phases right now and I'm just going off of Mitten's announcment, so things could have changed. 
---
We won't know for sure until it happens
---
You're welcome.
---
&gt;  “friendship drive charging”

Hello fellow elite:dangerous player!
---
Alternatively, they realize that it's a connected economy and that highsec relies on nullsec exports. Making nullsec an objectively worse place to live doesn't help the game.
---
~it begins~

He asked for a battleship that gets anywhere similar dps to a capital. Obviously the tank on a carrier is going to be a lot better than a battleship.
---
I'll take "What is the 'board my corvette' button for $500 please, Alex".

Literally free disposable intel ship.

Did a little googling and it does look fun, I'll start poking about in-game after I get reacclimated with the basics
---
Interesting. I’m mostly hampered by memory usage. CPU seems ok. Any improvements there?
---

---
*maniacal laughter*
---
Who the fuck even are you?
---
I feel like what people are asking for is that people hold smaller sovs, but have to spread out and contest other people's sov space for their resources.
---
Just need more Rorqs/supers/titan that's the solution im afraid,  its what eve needs
---
High sec really doesnt rely on it though, high sec can survive without T2 and various Pirate faction things.  Its not as connected as it used to be and it used to be nuill sec still had to import some materials from High sec and vice versa.  But the attitude and attack are going to make high sec not care and just blame null sec entities more.  So this doesnt help the game either, it in fact, hurts it more.  So my post before this still stands.
---
I would have passive isk based on rank and not played numbers, I would do the open style combat thing, because of you didn't want to lose the system you just don't fight unless you know you have a good chance of winning,making blobs more likely and your assuming most fw pilots are using fw as a step stone to null when  most I've met left null for fw, pirate militias is a good idea having them enlist to the npc pirate factions
---
I would add shared l.p. in fleets for killing enemy pilots instead of going towho just got the killing blow
---
It's like watching a trainwreck, horrific, but I can't look away.
---
I think it was the meta show
---
You are a dumbass. Look at the numbers. Eve's average daily player count is roughly 30k. Goonswarm alone has 32 thousand characters. Basically only exceeded by npc corps, whose numbers are not really useful. 
---
You're deluded if you think null is not at least 50% of eve
---
Damn I might have to come back. This sounds amusing.
---
Have you even looked at the structure rigs and bonuses? Do not talk about shit you know nothing about
---
Anything you actually ENJOY doing, I realise this is a weird concept.
---
right im just saying no point on spending that much money when you can get a cheap carrier.
---
Base plates don't count. You have to step on the windshield, points up.
---
And probably 85% of active subs.
---
Can someone explain what's happening to an old vet? This sounds pretty lit at shaking up the Nullsec meta
---
good
---
case in point, NPC kills dont count... including drifters
---
Lol man you are salty. 
---
You can’t D-scan them, they don’t appear in local, and when they land you have about 1-2 seconds before you’re locked down. Pilot skill is irrelevant.
---
No you're the dumbass here, 32,ooo is not active at once in goonswarm, nice try though.
---
Yes for two reasons: First the 64 bit client is no longer bound to only 4gb of memory, so you don’t hit the cap (I’m showing 6-8gb during normal use). Second the wine version you’ll install (v4.0.1) seems to have better memory call handling than the CCP wine release, which allows for shorter loading times. (I see about a 1-2 tick improvement in jumping gates for example).
---
i step on them all :D pain is pleasure
---
Thank you for the compliment. I was reading people's drifter reactions on Reddit and when I went back to YouTube I saw "The Drifters," band in my recommended. I thought to myself, "the drifters certainly are the song of the day."  I whipped up the image in Gimp after and I hope it brings a chuckle to some pilots out there.
---
Looks like they just knocked down a fueled, fitted and online astrahus: https://zkillboard.com/kill/77614406/
---
I'd be upset about this reply if I could read
---
I was waiting for this reference. This is exactly what I thought at first.
---
But a carrier will due to a single kikimora with T2 logi frigate while a vindi would kill the kikimora or get away. Different ships for different things.
---
Another structure.

This is awesome.

And here you see a goon, reacting naturally to its surroundings.
---
I roamed pure blind in an astero, hunting relics. Lots of bashing going on there from drifters it seems.
---
This hasn't even touched super/titan ratting.
---
i now have a reason to get a titan. just one harpy at a time, dozens of them.
---
why would you unsub as soon as something interesting kicks off?
---
I resubbed so I could roam null and looks around at this.
---
Seems so:

---
&gt;most veteran players would finally be free.

I'm not sure what I'd do with myself... Take up knitting or something...
---
More effort then I would put in myself man, give you props. Got a chuckle out of me and now I’m on “The drifters” kick riding to go see my daughter. Thanks man :)
---
Could have given all your friends injector presents or plexed their accounts for a few months. Nice one.
---
There is no way this will stay the way it is now. It is just part of CCP´s storytelling and testing mechanics out. And as such it is fun because it is different.
---
Parenting done right. 
---
Well done Sir.
---
Thank you for pointing that out, just added an edit!
---
The feeding shall commence&gt;!!&lt;

It can survive with nothing but t1 items but that doesn't mean it won't degrade the enjoyment of the game.

This is the best change to nullsec in years! Thanks CCP

---
Thanks friend, keeping the boy in j space to avoid spodbrain :D
---
They got an anshar, an astra, tons of vni, blingy t3c.... Yikes
---
I mean, if CCP ramps up the amount of drifters, the probability that they’ll follow up on timers increases, which should mean an eventual decrease in citadel spam. And plus, I can see CCP changing it so that it starts going after timers (mostly for low power ones)
---
This game was so much better back when battleship fleets were what everyone used. Battleships dont have scan resolution or lock range without gimping themselves.
---
31.9t of ISK destroyed putting them almost top 10 all time. *frogsiren*

Changing guns for brooms, the guards change to clean up crews

Cry harder ya mook.
---
i recently bought a mac to get better at itsec job  because macos is the only os im not familiar with. the hardware is great, the software also does a pretty good job of taking full advantage of the hardware. the UI its self sucks.
---
And a kink too. Who would have guessed.
---
Shit that's in no way like having some instalocking supers jump in on top of you without warning. Maybe CCP can design a Drifter inhib for you guys as counterplay. 1 min anchoring time, 60m each, 1h expiration and Drifters can still spawn 100km away.
---
CCP isn't trying to ruin the game. They just want to ruin your game.
---
RMT is against the rules. you can sell characters for plex on the character bazaar.
---
Sad that you have to point out how shortsighted people can be.
---

---
Grr gons and DUNKED memes aside, if ccp suddenly switched up the mechanics specifically to nuke a super fleet that'd feel a bit bullshit. 
---
The lore back story for ccp right-click-&gt;delete'ing supers better be good, at minimum
---
Replace drifters with high-sec gankers and it's literally the same complaint.
---
Add test and frat to that number and say 1/3 log in on average
---
I think the point is more they dont religiously hunt down structures to kill timers. It can happen via coincidence but that’s not the apparent motive if you will
---
I've recently come to the conclusion that anything T1 isn't worth flying.
---
YOU FOOL!
---
IT SAYS "DONT OPEN"
---
Moons you want to mine, a couple keepstars/ forts for market and staging, plenty of engineering complexes for industry spread out to even the index cost, add in a few refining and reacting cits and you should be way over 200 for a decently sized region
---
Gankers can definitely be scanned down though
---
Reminded that time I accidentally went into my uncle's basement
---
Mechanics changed on trig invasions too. Went yesterday to a spawn near Amarr, not so populated so i said, let's warp my bling praxis and start getting some DED LP into one Minor Conduit. I had to overheat the pithum shield booster while killing one anchoring frigate so i can warp off, also almost burnt guns from overheat because the damn frigate got OP reps. I'll stick with Sansha invasions for now, at least you know what to expect.
---
htfu
---
People don't really like to be entirely truthy when they lose blingy ships.
---
Props to those madlads whoring on that KM.
---
Had me in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
Dangerous space is dangerous, adapt or die, pubbie.
---
You won't be missed.
---
Okay good, it won't effect me at all then lol.
---
The thrill of it is, it's not a complex mechanic but I get a bit of adrenaline pumping trying to beat the timer.
---
you can see gankers in local. you can hammer dscan and fuck off when you see catalysts on short scan. you can spam combat probes and leave if you see a catalyst pop up. you can have a single logi alt with like 500k sp on grid afk repping you and that's good enough.
---
not even remotely comparable
---
I believe you.
---
Speaking as one of the people "crying" about citadel spam, I and everyone I know have been asking for more tools for humans to be able to combat citadel spam. Drifters that probabilistically hit the first timer of undefended low power structures and only rarely come back for round 2 sounds like *exactly* what the doctor ordered.
---
I mean, my preferred solution is to take a timer off of everything low powered (have them actually start with just their hull left), but this is a decent compromise.
---

---
Good on you for giving up whining after being reminded this isn't Hello Kitty Online.
---
My rorquals seem to be just fine. Nothing a few titans can't fix. Here's hoping they do modify it a bit so it is a constellation incursion or something though. Total random spawn is kind of dumb
---
I don't speak... whatever that is.
---
I can't emphasize this enough: It's supposed to be Russian roulette. Ideally, the "bullet" is a human in the pod of a PVP ship, so that you get to be content AND you have a chance to escape (but only a chance), but random death is way better than perfect safety.
---
... Really? Do you play EvE Online?
---
because if you buy a blops ccp hate you even more than they would if you buy a t1 battleship, how dare you not fly a super/haw titan you low skill fuck
---
Does anybody here?
---
See, \*WE'RE WORKING\*!  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/77614019/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77614019/)
---
we could rebalance battleships across the 4 empires and in places pirate factions to make them more viable so they undock
---
or we can introduce an EXCITING NEW race of battleship killers to make the problem even worse but hey look it's a shiny leshak while you're here why not buy some skins
---
I love how it almost looks like he's somehow looking up at the screen (behind him)  yay!
---
not any carrier, a shitfit carrier even for ratting. you don't need 2 drone navigation computers and 3 links... it works with 1 and 2. Probably he popped before people even got to him to help but extra tank would have saved him a bit of time
---
It's not reddit fault when mittens loses his shit, this dude is so retarded, spinning the shit out of the drifters calling it wow raid like 50 times and stuff like that, ofc people will laugh about that and the whole alliance when a leader of a 35000 man alliance is such a big whiney pussy
---
What??! 4 drifter ships can take down a citadel??
---
I do. I'd recommend you try it, but it doesn't seem like your kind of game. EvE is a much harsher game than most.
---
What is interesting about roaming a null with even less engage able targets for roaming? 
---
Seriously, this will just push more people to upgrade to cap ratting/mining and centralize more people under rescue umbrellas.
---
They don’t, though.
---
He turned around to assault my headset, snapped a pic of my baby smiling with eve in the background. God a pretty damn good fight minutes after too.

This pleases me
---
rmt
---
implying CCP tracks small scale RMTers
---
All hail daddy drifters!
---
No its not in anyway this if it sticks around will cause the super+ numbers to sky-rocket and as such destroying pvp as a whole because you can't undock subcap fuck you guys are so incredibly short sighted
---
No man, that's a myth. Nobody has played EvE since 2003, when it died.
---
i think it could be interesting to give t1 BS a bit of t3 flavor. all the stats are just a little bit underwhelming but you can install 1-2 subsystem modules that do stuff like improve cap, warp speed, move speed, etc. you could fit an abaddon with cap and scan res subsystems for a neuty gate camp or give it warp speed and tank
---
Could someone explain this picture LI5 to an EVE noob?
---
&gt; unless you fit medium guns which is a gimmicky solution at best.
---
and honestly at that point you might as well just fly a smaller ship that can actually lock anything before it dies while not getting caught by the first bored super pilot who looks in your general direction
---
u/alphaempire confirmed drifter *spai*
---
Yep. That's how I have a killmail in a capsule.
---
I am not sure where you derive your perspective of what is "respected", but FW lowsec is typically where actual solo pvpers develop skills and mature. If you actually look _down_ on people for dwelling there over some null crab hole, then I really can't help you.  I simply do not possess a vocabulary capable of adequately describing to you how ignorant you are of pvp in eve online.  I want you to know that all of us that have had the misfortune of reading this post are now dumber because of it.  May god have mercy on your soul.
---
It's not a game for everybody, so don't feel bad you don't like it.
---
Without context this doesn't seem to be anything interesting. The drifters have killed structures before, and the diamond npcs, a few years ago have killed citadels, so its clear that these NPCs are capable of killing the structures, the question however remains about their ability to follow up on timers that they themselves created.
---
So far, this has been the Achilles heel of the drifters (and the new "AI") they don't follow up on timers, and are basically just picking random celestial bodies  (and now anomalies) to warp to until they find something that they can shoot, which means that it is pretty much down to luck on A: they spawning in the system where the timer was created, and B, picking up the object that was reinforced and warping to it in the time that it comes out of reinforcement.
---
Based on recent reports, it seems that CCP's change after the lackluster few days of the "invasion" is to just increase the spawn rate of drifters as well as giving them more objects to warp to (anomalies) and hope that with an increase number of drifter spawns it will increase the chances of them picking up a structure when it comes out of reinforcement. This could at least eventually become the space cleaning system that so many people have asked for (not sure why people are excited about it, but hey at least there is a chance that ccp can deliver on that at least).
---
One thing is certain though, this thing will be really annoying to deal with, if the first few days of the "invasion" are anything to go by, we can safely say that this will infuriate the hell out of anyone who lives inside structures in nullsec (have the drifters made any move in highsec/lowsec?).
---
This might be my favorite quote on reddit.  So, ya know, low bar. But still... lol
---
The drifters will shred any ratting caps they catch.
---
&gt;685 items
---
u h h
---
There won't be much for you to look at if he really does unsub, and others like him.
---
which is the whole point of this change
---
i picked that one up when i was a goon :D
---
This has killed going literally anywhere in a battlecruiser or battleship without a scout. It's like africanized incursion rats without the warning, and once you're locked you're dead. 
---
While it's funny to watch the big blocks burn, even the folks in the smaller group I'm playing with are getting pretty irritated. Hell, I was trying to SHOOT a structure today, drifters pushed me off the structure, and then didn't bring enough DPS so it repaired. What kind of wierd bullshit is that?
---
Ah yes, because if the only content left in Null is rorqs we must be in a pretty good spot
---
What you have made there is an effective anti-garmur ship, that mwd bonus + nano fit it's gonna be one hell of a kiter
---
If these drifter  attacks are actually effective at clearing out low power citadels, then every low power citadel should be dead in a day or two.
---
So far, most structures, regardless of power level, havent even been reinforced
---
I watched 3 different folks log off/rage quit today because while doing active PvP activities they got instagibbed on gates because they A: tried to use a battlecruiser in space, B: tried to bubble an enemy fleet on a gate and crash gate, and C: looked away from their alt for 2 seconds one what WAS a clear gate. These were folks actively out, generating content in subcaps.
---
Random nullbears are not the only people logging off.
---
Because there was a time when smaller ships did not do the amount of damage they do now. And black ops having no downsidebesides cost would have made them pretty overpowered.
---
The number of people responding to the way *he* reacted pales in comparison to the number of people that have been responding with general fuck goons / fuck null sort of comments.
---
I'm not intending to pass judgment on who's justified in their reaction or not.  All I'm saying is that I really doubt that CCP is the *only* target of whatever it is that the Goons are trying to do right now.  This is human nature 101.  If you're driving down the road, and someone lays on their horn, most people are going to reflexively flip that person off without pausing to causing to reflect as to whether the honking was justified.
---
Even if it's only by chance, they still showed up. They have more balls than half of Eve
---
So wanting to be able to fight is not HTFU, wanting to not randomly explode is being lazy. You have to have a mental problem.
---
They're playing the game correctly. You can't have a good time unless your ruining someone else's.
---
What exactly do you propose he do?
---
Its not like CCP is running out of drifter battleships to spawn.
---
Range? i heard that they have an stupid scram range, like over 100kms.. Anybody confirm that?
---
"Bumping is unfair!"
---
&gt;but random death is way better than perfect safety.
---
I see.
---
Just so we're clear, you're totally cool with CCP making it to where groups of CONCORD ships will just randomly show up to murder the fuck out of you as a part of an unannounced future update then?
---
If you think a Sensor Booster and an NSA are the same, you missed my point.
---
Whoah whoah whoah, you're going against the current narrative about CCP driving players away from Eve. Didn't you see the message in Bittervet Monthly?
---
*Why would you unsub as soon as CCP starts throwing endless waves of NPCs at your space that you can't really do anything about except killing them when they pop up*
---
Gee I wonder. CCP wanted this meta. CCP did nothing when it was established two years ago. And now, they suddenly send an, by definition, unbeatable opponent to break it up. CCP is punishing null for something they are responsible for.
---
I am living in w-space and I know very well what it implies.
---
In wormhole, if you leave for an extended period of time (week+), you just save up your most expensive assets (log off in a freighter or haul into hisec). Unconditionally.
---
My suggestion gives longer grace period (2-4 weeks) which starts after structure runs out of fuel. Do not want to lose assets? Just fuel your citadels.
---
UPVOTE
---
Since that is clearly what I said, what a great counter argument.
---
Man, imagine risking losing a ship in eve online. Terrifying.
---
At least your ship is with you.  Most of my assets are (were) in stations that got unanchored when stations were no longer a thing.  At least asset protection saved me but I am still winning the game.  To put things in perspective, I still have a Slippery Peete, Munnin and Sailboat somewhere in the south and I am pretty sure that nullified rail boats were not a thing for more than a few months in 2014/2015. 
---
I have found that the game is way more fun to read about than play.  Kind of like League of Legends  is more fun to watch than play.  
---
I guess I could fail at flying blaster boats on a ftp account.
---
[removed]
---
Do you think bumping should be removed from the game?
---
And people are already going nuts, lol. 
---
Give it some time mate, soon enough people will stop forming up for every citadel that gets reff'ed and only form up for the important ones.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c8xtov/second_citadel_dies_to_drifters/
---
&gt;Any capitals that want to roam around must gate and deal with shitty warp speeds / subcap gate camps.
---
This would pretty much kill capitals in lowsec. Whether that's a good thing or a bad thing is left as an exercise for the reader.
---
&gt;Pipes into null/low from highsec are impossible to camp thanks to heavily fortified Concord presence so you can now make your first foray into low sec without getting instablapped on your first jump in.
---
Most people's first forays into null are when they either join an alliance that lives out there or when they blunder into it through a wormhole. All this is going to do is make the game easier for haulers.
---
I guess I shoulda just said I wish noone needed 200 structures
---
You don't like the drifters, get out of your lame ass null alliance. Go hang out in low sec and shit on some scrubs with that dank isk you've been accumulating without risk
---
To be honest, this doesn't sound like too bad of an idea. It benefits newer players who are more active and penalises experienced players' alts which generally go unused. So long as the SP benefit isn't too large, say only 25% at most, this could be decently balanced and give new players a smoother way in to the game without being as frustrated by long train times.
---
The problem however is that, from information that i've been able to get from others who have been following this new drifter npcs, they pretty much insta scram you from a ridiculous range (over 100kms is what i heard). No player can do anomaly ratting and be expected to identify them warping in (in the middle of all the other normal npcs) and react quickly enough to avoid that.
---
And the fact that there is literally no counter play available to the player will make this mechanic extremely frustrating to deal with. If you get caught by them, you are dead, nothing short of super will be able to tank them.
---
I completely understand why they don't show up on dscan **if their purpose really is to hunt bots**, since it would be trivial for a bot to use dscan to spot them, however if this mechanic is supposed to be unforgiving yet fair for a human player to interact with, there has to be some way for a player to react and deal with them, if not, CCP should just ignore the npcs and make it so that when you are ratting in a anomaly you have a 10% chance of insta death, because that's what this mechanic looks like it will become if things keep going this way.
---
Shit
---
I think he means losing a ship to NPCs with arcane and undefinable stats, who don't appear on Dscan and don't offer any hint they might attack your system. It's like a CCP dev with a nuke button on their keyboard. That's not good for any game.
---
Brand newbros is a small group kappa
---
you realized that they are actively iterating?
---
they had a very low chance to kill a structure in the first iteration. now the chance with much broader spawns is alot bigger. now, next week is also coming...
---
i wouldn't be so sure they don't program sieges on timers too
---
i dont think caps should be able to fit points/scrams at all. 
---
MAYBE HAW dreads because they are specifically antisub, but carriers and up and supposed to be supported by subs.
---
I hope so. He was good for EVE.
---
Drifters randomly dunk approximately 5% of the GSF super fleet.
---
Mittens: The game is dead, everyone quit playing now.
---
Just let it happen ;)  
---
Or can we study the lore and manage a counter offensive?  
---
Imagine, somebody finds some kind of drifter HQ and 30.000 players unite to take it down?  
---
I remember talking with friends maybe over the last 3 years like:  
---
\- Did you notice the drifters? What's up with them?  
---
\- yes, they placed outposts in some systems and do some scanning looking useless  
---
\- later came some drifter incursions  
---
\- yes, and the big battle in Amarr space where they killed the empress  
---
\- ... and they became part of the new player experience  
---
\- and they attack players with dead corpses in cargo to collect these corpses  
---
\- yes, this seems to lead into something big
---
Maybe, we must jump on the lore train and study the drifters for a big weak point.  
---
I can remember drifter incursions, where the drifters could harldy fight ships with a signature under 60m³  
---
Maybe, drifters can be killed instantly with ice mining lasers (because they are so cold creatures)?  
---
You see.  I have my fun with it though this drifter stuff impacts me somewhere in nullsec. I am curious how this continues...
---
Took away passive moon income
---
Or you could take fleets out and hit them while they're busy dealing with Drifters. They can only be in so many places at once. Take so cheap disposable T1 shit. It gets the job done just as well. 
---
There is such an opportunity to 3rd party these engagements, but all anyone wants to do is sit around and while. 
---
All the real PvPers must have left Eve and what we have left are a bunch of Carebears posing as wolves.
---
It makes perfect sense. Lull your enemy into thinking that they have a perfect defense against an enemy, allow them to mass all their major assets into a giant fleet, and then show your true strength.

I hear they dunked a pair of citidels.
---
And what would you kill while roaming in your t1 dessies?
---
More t1 dessies mid death to drifters?
---
Yeah sounds good lets take 30 gates and 6 wormholes to shoot t1 dessies that were going to die anyways 4 seconds later.
---
I am a farm taco.
---
You could try forwarding the port that eve online chat system uses in your router settings, i believe its tcp 5222.
---
 I know that doing this solved a similar problem a friend of mine was having.
---
Afraid of losing ships to a mechanic that you can't avoid, outplay, or outsmart. Yeah. Drifters on gates are an RNG automatic lose your ship.
---
I lost a 4B isk haw dread the other day and put GFs in local with a smile. If I lost a ship to drifters that insta-scram at 150km range with 5,000 omni dps from 2 battleships and a cruiser, i'd be a little chafed. If concord started going crazy and randomly blapping people in hisec, people would be losing their minds.
---
Most active players are In highsec, It was ~75% of the activity iirc from an old ccp presentation
---
I thought my 331 was a bit much, then again when I consider that 90% of them came from a 2 week period in 6/18....
---
Doesn't it die if someone uses the batphones and you don't? Sounds like a capital to me.
---
I haven't switched my flair but I'm in Unspoken if it makes you feel better
---
NPC killmails usually only list one aggressor even if your ship overwhelmed by damage from dozens.  The same is likely true for classes of drifter rats.  If you see 4 NPC entities on the killmail of a hel, its likely that far more than 4 NPCs were actually shooting it...
---
Or... because real players aren't endlessly respawning NPCs that can ignore damage caps?
---
Losing a blinged out ship to an Enemy who is playing in GOD mode is not PvP dude.
---
Why are you changing topics?
---
Well how would you like it if a random Group of npc's warps next to you, instalocks and instapops you? Before that drifter Invasion you could look back and say i made a mistake there. Now its just like every time undocking you have a chance of just exploding without reason. He isnt the only one not interested to log in anymore with this bullshit of overpowered npc's. You cant even solo or smallgang roam anymore
---
I flew thrugh Detorid a minute ago and it looks like they're burning your enemies space now, this is awesome
---
Good. More. I want more.
---
You're rolling the dice on getting ganked anywhere in Eve when you undock. You're never 100% safe anywhere and there's not always an option for any sort of counter. You're just dead. 
---
I recall complaints from players about several mechanics in PvP that didn't/don't have any counterplay and the resounding response from the Eve player base was that it was part of the game and to deal with it and HTFU. It's kind of funny when the shoe is on the other foot.
---
It's a simple question. Do you think bumping should be removed?
---
game dead? fewest kills monthly since 2009?
---
just add in NPCs that kill everyone INSTANTLY
---
That's roughly what a highsec wardec feels like for a new player. We've been through that and more.
---
HTFU nullsec ratters
---
Market trading in WHs is not going to tickle your biscuits after doing it in a major NS block.
---
Generally in WHs, the group is much smaller and unless you mark ups are very small, you wont be around for long if your intention is to make isk off of your friends backs.
---
probably bad idea:
---
* make sov harder to defend
---
* make BS mass larger across the board so that its much more expensive to bridge them, cutting their projection, dont increase warp speed either
---
* make lock, large gun optimal and falloff much longer, design them to be good home defense ships, but terrible for taking on the offense. 
---
this (should) mean that uncontested sov is easier to troll/take so alliances have to actually field something to hold it. the home team advantage is now less about sov mechanics and more about having better ships available.
---
Who said dessies? You can take any number of T1 doctrines out depending on what you're doing
---
suuure... we still don't know what the sleepers are, EVE Online is a repository for unfinished books that failed to get out of the first chapter
---
A highsec wardec is a joke. Just dont be where they are. Dont feed em and they go away. You can See them and avoid them. Drifters just randomly Pop up next to you and you are dead as your pod is.
---
second guy, ruined solo kill tho
---
Do you mean this - [https://zkillboard.com/region/10000006/](https://zkillboard.com/region/10000006/)?
---
never said they were. but it's far and away more than probably all the hisec player corps combined.
---
Okay fine, so you're not in dessies.
---
Replace dessies with 'whatever', and the point still stands.
---
&gt;And what would you kill while roaming in your t1 ~~dessies~~ **whatever**?
---
&gt;~~More~~ t1 dessies mid death to drifters, **seconds before your own death to drifters**?
---
&gt;Yeah sounds good lets take 30 gates and 6 wormholes to shoot t1 dessies that were going to die anyways 4 seconds later.
---
The problem with that argument is that there are counter plays against ganking.
---
If i'm undocking something expensive and flying somewhere in highsec, there are ways of making myself slight less likely to be ganked, i can use a scout to look the system in advance and checking out the people in local (and if there are gank ships on the gate) or if i'm flying something big and heavy that takes a long time to align i can use an alt/friend with a webbing ship to web into warp.
---
If i'm warping my loot pinata to jita 4-4 i can use an insta dock bookmark so i don't get volley by the tornados that sit on the station 24/7 (and have haulers that behave suspiciously like bots).
---
I of course can potentially completely avoid being a target of ganking by flying something not worth it to be ganked.
---
Of course there are those that don't care about the value and are doing so only for the fun, miner gankers for example don't care about it, but even in that case, a miner can avoid being ganked, by paying attention to the people in local, and warping out to station if they see a suicide ganker appearing in local. Or if they see something suspicious like a ship on grid with them using a ship scanner on them for no reason.
---
Anybody saying that pvp ganking don't have any counter play are idiots, there are things that a player can do to avoid it, or at least protect themselves to a point where being killed by it is usually a case of a player being careless and not a case of player having no chance to react to it.
---
With the drifters however, from everything that i heard, this is not the case. They show up on grid, and you are tackled and dead within a few seconds, no warning, no way for the player to react to them, and when tackled, nothing that the player can do besides just hoping they can get their pod out.
---
Have you ever missed an OP because 5 of your Atrons got instalocked the moment they left Jita 4-4? Yeah I know unfair. You know what? I kept playing and in the end was richer for the experience. 
---
Even aint fair, HTFU
---
no drifter hq. it's basically recycled code from the blood raiders events, minus the actual structures
---
And I thought my 120 was a bit much...
---
Or at least the non-weapon POS modules that lived outside the shields. The modules that lived -inside- the shields (indutry, refining, hangars etc.) were functionally replaced by traditional citadels.
---
Semper ubi sub ubi
---
&gt; Dangerous space is dangerous, adapt or die, pubbie.
---
this isn't just dangerous. it's stupid and unfun. there's literally no way to adapt. they're not on dscan, you can't tank em, can't kill em, basically they come outta nowhere, bam you dead, them go kill other things
---
Yah I just run them in a carrier or a haw dread, if I get a wave like that, good more isk for me.
---
Sounds a lot like super blobs to me.
---
yes over a hundred, not sure what the limit is, but they have scrammed and killed people in fleets I was on to defend citadels from over 100 km
---
&gt; Most active players are In highsec, It was ~75% of the activity iirc from an old ccp presentation
---
doubtful it's the same today. hisec has really gone downhill.

thanks

---
Market trading really isn't a thing in wormholes. Most wormhole markets tend to be very specialised, containing only items relevant to particular doctrines or manufacturing. So you really can't make much ISK doing that.
---
Most of the ISK in wormholes comes from running sites, gas huffing, exploration, and the occasional bit of moon mining. These are all high-risk high-reward activities (except for gas huffing, which is a moderate reward for a frankly insultingly low risk).
---
I'd say give it a shot, but don't expect wormhole life to be anything at all like life in GSF. We actually take fights we can lose, for starters.
---
If you want an in, join MCAV-public in-game.
---
\&gt; Edit: why don’t we use this system now, does it have any disadvantages? 
---
For the same but opposite reason that timezone tanking is a pain, it also meant that if you weren't online to change the stront, you could never get a real chance to defend.
---
To be clear, timezone tanking was still entirely possible and did occur. The only thing that you had to do was make sure you knew when they attacked or were able to be online when they did.
---
lmao, but super blobs can be countered or evaded. they're aslo limited in range.
---
I was just about to comment that too! I just started like 2 days ago :'D
---
You keep telling yourself that.
---
Well dont make jita 4-4 your staging because thats stupid?
---
cyno inhibs, scouts, etc? literally none have any effect on drifters
---
&gt;you wont be around for long if your intention is to make isk off of your friends backs.
---
Just to add to this: Yeah, with markets as small and specialised as wormhole markets it's generally frowned upon to buy up the stock of a certain item and jack up the prices. That's an easy way to get people really upset with you.
---
Mittens: We solved drifters, haha CCPFAIL

Tyrannos: No, *we solved you*
---
go to any lowsec which has some activity (let's say oijanen, Jan, Obe, Taisy, Saranen, etc, ). Loot yellow wrecks from the gate, when no one is around, get suspect status, dock 15 minutes, rinse and repeat. I'm no alpha, but i enjoy stealing stuff rather than krabbing all day. Made some good isk with scooped drones and looting wrecks on my way to some system, i was not even having the plan to do that. No one will attack you near the gate because gate guns, and you can always crash the gate fast and not get killed, but rule #1 always spam DSCAN. 
---
go to any FW system where people are killing each other, scan for abandoned drones. Scoop and sell in the same system at a NPC station. People will rebuy them without going all the way to Jita and back. You can also put the sell orders even higher than Jita. 
---
go to any triglavian invasions system, fit a combat scanner (not sure if alphas can) and look for abandoned trig wrecks near custom offices and belts, player wrecks killed by trigs etc. Loot, fit also one salvager and salvage what you find. You will be surprised how much money you can make.

CCP removed a system with counterplay, nuance, and variance and replaced it with a system where the paste eating defenders can commit to only logging in one day a week at most. 
---
EVE 2019
---
Well not CONCORD, but imagine if you will a dark CONCORD.
---
What is an active discord that is well known?
---
&gt;people wanting CCP to stop
---
CCP: **Sorry, capsuleer. I’m afraid I can’t do that.**
---
Yes, most WH citadels don't even have a market mod installed though, there is no asset safety so everyone brings in what they need, and you should keep anything you don't need in kspace.
---
Reprocess

If you're in anything smaller than a supercarrier, you may randomly explode.
---
\-CCP
---
This is stupid as fuck
---
You assume these groups will all act in unison as a single entity. 
---
There will inevitably be naughty members that take advantage of the efforts of everyone else to make a quick buck from their alts, to go against the orders from up top.
---
World of Driftercraft
---
but RonUSMC says all of you in TEST are totally loving this, and that it's great content.
---
Check your upper lip, its there
---
Are they hitting belts?
---
i think ccp is planning to do a  buypack of them (if i recall correctly) probably won't be worth much anyway.
---
Buy that many plex, jettison it, and pop it in front of as many people as possible.
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
It's not that I don't see that there's a problem and how the game currently incentivize gathering in huge numbers and larger entities.
---
I just don't see how it's even possible to make a game that enable "sandboxy" freedom EVE currently provides without incentivizing teaming up over anything else. Pretty much every limitation aimed against *the blob* I've seen people coming up with throughout these years is the one that can be gamed. Ironically, the more people you have and the better your organization is, the better you will be able to game most of those ideas despite them trying to do the opposite.
---
So, long story short, I'm afraid that as long as EvE remains EvE and not some Fortnite in space, as a game designer you can't ever beat Malcanis' Law no matter how hard you try.
---
Call me a downer.
---
It only shows one npc per shiptype attacking one the killmail. It might have been hundreds or 4, no way of knowing without being there
---
man I hope you’re not flair baiting because this post is going in the collection
---
Too broad. What are your goals? Do you eant the most dankfites possible, or do you want to turn that 1B into 1T as fast as possible? How many SP do you have? Do you want to build your own sandcastle, use others' etc....
---
mittens: "we were leaving north anyway cause FCs were burn out"
---
day later mittens: "we will bash HS structures" :P
---
Told a 10 year old I'd double his 10er.
---
I was kinda new, but I remember doing an osprey fleet to rep the pos. I think Citidels should be manually repped still.
---
Doing mining = bonus to mining research, repeat for combat, scanning, industry
---
Don't have anything to play it on anymore or I would get on trust me 😫
---
Why I do is make buy orders, wait for them to be filled, and then make sell orders with the items I just got.
---
Well I’m happy *some* people see it as good.
---
I pointed out that a lot of this is good and nulseccers really need to stop crying because their safe spaces have been invaded. People did not like that.
---
The reality is nulsec has been far too safe for far too long. I think it’s funny how a lot of these people will shit talk anyone who stays in highsec because it’s “too safe” but then as soon as things get dangerous in nul everyone is crying
---
Hisec got triglavian invasion nullsec got drifter invasion what is the event going to be  for losec and jspace?
---
No, it can’t.
---
THIS. CCPLEASE
---
yes
---
I was going to remove this post... but it’s honestly funnier to see op make a fool of himself.
---
If you cannot have fun that way, you probably shouldn't, but I'm afraid you're in for a hard mode then, but not hard in a sense "challenging", but rather "frustrating".
---
Really what this game needs is not more bullshit to get forgotten about ballance wise. The existing modules, ships and fits need to be reballanced or for gods sake finished being reballanced. Eve didnt need the most recent race ship line addition while half the ships are worthless or unbalanced.
---
An expansion where it's not min-maxed within days.. Love it.
---
Judging from the past few years, i think it is safe that CCP Bob was fired a long time ago.
---
Yeah there are professional reasons for macs, but they're rare and decently niche and most things can be done better on Windows.
---
Hey im a long time Eve player currently addicted to Elite! It like we swpped roles!

 [https://zkillboard.com/related/30000609/201907040500/](https://zkillboard.com/related/30000609/201907040500/)  ..... 
---
all HAil the Drifters!!!
---
I see no ded Goons on zkill what happened?
---
Adapt.
---
:(
---
" Well how would you like it if a random Group of npc's warps next to you, instalocks and instapops you? "  
---
that sounds like high sec with extra steps.
---
well its giving me an estimate and i hope i at least get the estimate but ill probably get like a tenth of that so... yea
---
btw ...check what they are killing most! You can guess only once!
---
drifters spawn into abyssal space. you dont only fight trigs. drifters do not follow you into pockets.
---
Wait a second. You're implying that your group had enough dps to prevent the structure from repairing but the drifters didn't.
---
Hence, your group had more dps than the npcs.
---
So how did they push you off the structure? Why didn't you just kill them? Something doesn't add up with this story.
---
Yo wtf happened in Wicked Creek
---
So considering how many Drifters I gunned down by now the Triangleboys should love me? Give Force Recon pls.
---
Adapt
---
Battle for nullsec
---
If they randomly warp to anoms the chance of them to follow up on any timer in an upgraded system will be close to 0
---
All HAIL the Drifters!!!
---
I lived in highsec for 1.5 years, never ever had anything like that happen to me. Not even remotely. Especially not by mindless NPCs that dont show up in local nor on dscan. If you are refering to highsec gankers, even they have to put in efford while drifters just get spawned in. But hell im looking forward to shifting my attention to highsec ganking instead, at least thats cheaper. hopefully we see each other on grid then.
---
You keep saying nullsec ratters. Do you even play this game still?  You know what my fun per hour is with drifters? It's really low. Lower than when you were winning eve and I was one of a handful of people in Brave newbies still undocking to fight when we went to faction warfare after hero. I'll lose ships to players all day without a worry. I'll lose ships to NPCs for doing something stupid and laugh. But drifters are completely different. You're blind if you think these aren't having a negative affect on pvp and player interaction.
---
Aww i thought this would be like i tried earlier, take a shot every time there was a "structure under attack" ping
---
Needless to say, but to save myself from alcohol poisoning i stopped the game after 15 pings.
---
La CCP devs say - release the Kraken (drifters).
---
It does make you look a lot less retarded knowing that.
---
Yeah, CCP should just burn literally everything and restart with a new seed. Maybe using '69' instead of '42' as map generation seed will result in a low sec gate to stain...
---
So you are saying I should have adapted? I did. How bout you?
---
Shh, the narrative must be upheld. Remember, no matter what happens, just keep posting that goons are salty.
---
I wish
---
&gt; his would pretty much kill capitals in lowsec. Whether that's a good thing or a bad thing is left as an exercise for the reader
---
It wouldn't necessarily kill them, but it would make capitals in lowsec even more oppressive due to a complete lack of options to counter escalate against the locals.
---
Basically phoebe situations with alliances basically having no fear of using their caps and supers since nobody else that could kill them lived within range.
---
Could the end of the zombie bee swarm be a whimper of unsubs?
---
CCP finally found a way to deal with those pesky bots.
---
Yeah, conflicting design goals by the looks of it.
---
Beautiful, really beautiful.
---
windows is best for very few things. its the primary platform for games, excel has features not available in foss alternatives and all the good CAD tools are only available for windows. mac has better image, video, and audio editing tools.
---
So far, it would seem, that not even an NPC can stomach the boredom of mining a SOV structure with a magic wand.
---
Learn to use insta-undock bookmarks I guess. If you're losing ships to wardeccers, I'm sorry to say, but you're the one at fault. Get good
---
Thinking on petitioning to rename the notification bot to Preston Garvey.
---
you are comparing apples with pears here.
---
Sounds to me like CCP are chucking a bigger hissy fit than the nullsec groups trying to burn down highsec
---
Because doomsdays delete subcaps. And regular caps.
---
The drifters kept drifting (lul) out of range of the structure, and it seems like their weapons do have some form of falloff mechanic.
---
Lol a dipshit renter gets killed by npcs. Goons on suicide watch, surely.
---
It is surprising that CCP has had the balls to drop this event that has NPCs that delete people instantly but doesn't want to put more actual risk ingame that could save the dwindling playercount I feel as if CCP management is kinda retarded honestly
---
Unless CCP has any means to add/fix mechanics while having major overhauls on how often they balance/reiterate (which I doubt) after the event and the fucking of null local it'll just keep dying as fast as always has been tbh
---
It's really strange how retreivers that were killed and podded kept coming back to the mining anomaly where they were killed to be podded again in the same spot.
---
The problem already sounded bad before...
---
No I said fitting a sebo INSTEAD of something useful like an application mod is stupid af.  There is really no BS in the game that has enough slots where you can fit a sebo and not be gimping yourself in some other way.  The only BS that could maybe afford to lose a mid for a sebo is the Praxis since it has a million slots, but the praxis is also garbage.  Base scan res for battleships IS TOO FUCKING LOW.  If you'd ever been out in a fleet of any less than 100 peeps this might not be news to you.
---
From what I gather, they spawn in systems within a few jumps from Drifter wormholes. Maybe a little scouting and not running sites in those areas? 
---
They don't just spawn on gird, they warp on grid. They have to warp from somewhere. People have witnessed them warping to anoms, so they had to be warping from somewhere for someone to observe. 
---
Maybe put some work in like you've described above and you can lessen the likelihood of being ganked by Drifters
---
maybe ccp should give a way for people to team up with drifters if they have good standing?
---
I guess Dora got explored thoroughly. Pretty wicked ngl!
---
I see plenty of PvP kills with T1 ships on zkill. Maybe you need to figure out what you're doing wrong if you're having issues
---
See, there's that pesky risk aversion getting in the way
---
You'll have to undock to get them.
---
Oh noes, this one is retarded...
---
You may inform my brothers and sisters in local public communications channels about other artificially intelligent robotic algorithms piloting space vessels and we shall get around to purging them as well.
---
[Is that bot central?](https://youtu.be/Adgx9wt63NY)
---
Context:
---
This guy bots 9 or so accounts mining ice. Standard warping out instantly when entering local. We've caught him warping a pod or two back with the retrievers before, which is odd but not insane as a person might be lazy or otherwise forget they needed to reship.
---
Of course, usually you don't warp ALL the pods back multiple times. Unless, of course, your bot doesn't read drifter.
---
They just wanted to make sure the drifters were gone.
---
(To be honest though, with all the drifters floating around causing mayham, CCP could totally drop a couple of them on people they suspect of botting, then monitor their reactions)
---
haha, lmao. are you really that naiive to think that eve can survive without null blocs?
---
Ok we'll adapt. Just added 500 people to our gunnery ACL's, and we have a roaming supercarrier fleet killing the drifter gang.
---
How is everyone else doing?
---
Make the Drifters join NCdot, then we'll all be safe again!
---
Basically one dead VNI every 10-15 min
---
&gt;Think out of the box. Change your play style, your fit, your location, anything to not do what you have come to expect to.
---
People are thinking out side the box.
---
The only playstyle that actually stops you being blown up randomly at any point in a 50 v 1  with only 1-2 seconds warning is literally never undocking or not logging in.
---
Here we go again bois....
---
Fake News folks. The authorities in Null Sec have informed me that they are unaware of any botting going on and have assured me that the reports of such activities have been greatly exaggerated.
---
Unattended Vexor Navy-class vessels are easy prey for me and my compatriots.
---
player ships don't have the range of an entire grid
---
The truth 🙏
---
avoid null
---
Bots aren’t configured to warp away from rats so the drifters can just nuke all the botter ships. Real players run and only lose a bit of time.
---
This may actually be healthy for the game. The mineral prices may balance out and go up as people won’t be so eager to go mining in rorqs. Supply/demand and all that. 
---
Maybe that was CCP’s plan?
---
You could write a rule(or several) for it to happen if somebody puts the right fleet on field with the drifters. Then it’s not CCP pulling the trigger, but the players...
---
 Who brought X number of titans and Y number of supers, onto a grid where # of keepstars &gt; 1 and a doomsday is used on drifters that results in Z number of drifter NPC deaths, then Drifter Doomsday protocol = TRUE for system ABC-123 after downtime, for the next 72 hours.
---
Can you make me one?
---
Except they dont have dds, if they do, report it to ccp as a bug
---
The subreddit discord is linked in the sidebar
---
&gt;sounds like I'm staying in wspace.
---
If you're an explorer, why would you NOT do that?
---
Yes, my god yes! There's no reason why caps should be better at locking than battleships.
---
&gt; You're implying that your group had enough dps to prevent the structure from repairing but the drifters didn't.
---
&gt; Hence, your group had more dps than the npcs.
---
Having more DPS than your enemy isn't the only factor in winning a fight.
---
And they're not interesting enough to risk loosing ships to, especially when they're running around with literal mini-doomsdays that's going to just blap someone.
---
If I wanted  a small group of fleets, I'd look to Karmafleet before them.
---
CCP should just amplify the Drifter menace in the bot lands
---
An incredibly stupid move then. He could have extracted and sold all that SP.
---
You mean the coalitions that are smothering EVE in a Red vs Blue, two sides war and possibly a complete blue doughnut soon?
---
Sounds like they were killing EVE to me.
---
Are they random? Targeting bots? Everywhere?
---
Join a smaller corp, do pve when corp mates are not on or doing their own stuff. What i do is exploration in the morning (when i got a day off for example) and roam and do stuff with corp mates in the evening. If you are interested to join a smaller corp that lives in a wh, pm me  :)
---
makes me wounder why the drifters did not insta pop it
---
yeah, inb4 another blueball but allied with drifters this time.
---
fuck any kind of teaming up. any
---
The issue is that there is no way to know if they are with you in system (AFAIK) If there was some form for an active player to identify the presence of drifters in their system it would be something.
---
The information about them coming from drifter wormholes is interesting though, not very helpful without an intel network of a large alliance, but it could offer some counter play at least for the more organized groups, not so much for anybody else that happens to be exploring/doing activities in space without said intel networks.
---
Can these wormholes be closed by the players, similar to normal whs? or are they only time limited?
---
If they can be closed by players, that would be something that could be done as a response, that would be okay, however if they can't, and are only time limited, then the only option is to not do anything in those systems, which i'm not sure is something ccp wants people to think, that they can't use their systems to play the game, i think they would rather people be in space and undocked, than docked, or offline.
---
And yes i'm aware that they warp, don't just spawn, but the issue however is that they have a ridiculously long scram range (the reported ranges so far indicate that they can scram you from over 100 kms distance), and their locking speed appears to be instant or very close to instant, leaving you no real chance to react when they get on grid with you.
---
If they had more modest scram ranges like 20~30 kms or at max 50kms (which is basically the distance that mordus ships can scram you from) it would be something, but no they can scram you from over 100kms for some stupid reason, that basically covers the range that most ships will stay inside anomalies, so you are toast the moment they get on grid with you.
---
could make the game into eve:pubg :P
---
Pretty good, kinda hungry. How are you?
---
You don’t burn out strat FCs by having anyone who wants to take out a bash ferox fleet. It’s not like those are very complicated
---
Yes, drifters are great for roamers. Ask bjorn about it.
---
Hey dude, which timezone are you in?
---
Doing BoB's work.
---
No they won't. They'll shred ratting caps of bots without a cyno. They shred all subcaps. We've been killing the groups that spawn with carriers, supers, and titans. The previous groups would shred caps, too, but today they've been groups of three.
---
We’re already working together in that we ended all the wars. Bashing a bunch of hisec structures also isn’t complicated. We’re obviously not going to Blue each other or anything, but for the moment all of us have a common enemy
---
I know what an nsa does are you willing to to take the lack of tackle mods to decrease lock time, we’l end up back with sniping bs’s and I know it’s subjective but to me it’s not fun what I think people are after is to have some fun brawling in battleships.
---
I think that the battleships with utility highs aren’t in a bad spot to fly the problem is the propensity to drop caps on them.
---
People are assholes that’s why we can’t have nice things people will naturally look to min max or  just blob to get kills especially if it’s a worthy km that’s why it makes balancing things like this really difficult 
---
No matter what changes are made I can’t see to many people enjoying flying battleships unless there is some change to Cyno inhibitors or the general cap proliferation and the willingness to blob hard 
---
I mostly fly frigs as that’s what I enjoy most but some of my friends love battleship brawls and it still happens but it’s usually between long time frenemies who have the understanding not to blob so both sides can have some good fun, and I refuse to undock my caps to fight something that isn’t a timer or to counter enemy caps (or a  juicy rorqual)
---
If CCP wants EVE to be a PVE focused game, they can make that change. There just might not be as many people playing it as a PVP focused EVE game.
---
Personally, I find it much easier to stay in character in writing. Gives me time to collect my thoughts and really think about what the character would say. Some of my best RP was when my DnD group had an RP group chat. I guess some people prefer to write, others prefer to act.
---
Jovians will come back and invade wormholes. 
---
Lowsec was already invaded by Snuffed Out, no reason to send npcs to do it
---
That's by choice more than by optimal gameplay.
---
Just stop defending the unimportant structures lmao
---
"I rather defend every single structure instead of letting unimportant structures die"
---
noice!
---
Super difficult for CCP to check such behaviour without drifters.
---
Agreed. When null sec becomes safer for players than high sec it's indicative of a problem..you shouldn't ever be able to afk anything in null sec. It's supposed to be high risk high reward. Not afk your way to iskies
---
I prefer writing when it requires logical structure, I would rather write an e-mail explaining the code I have implemented than try talk about it in a meeting.
---
adapt or die
---
With NSA you cant warp v0v
---
Unspoken Alliance.
---
Pischinger &amp; Dermota   "Strom"
---
wrong
---
POS bashes were mind numbing and led to burn out of myself and friends being sat in a rev/oracle (insert any Amarr laser boat) with t1 crystals for hours day after day was no fun  the amount of go poses have isn’t funny, 
---
now don’t get me wrong I would go back to pos’s at this point because structures have had a terrible impact on the game a balance somewhere between the old and new system would be nice but I couldn’t tell you how to balance this sadly
---
Drifters are azdaja, not deviant automata (rogue drones)
---
Tbf most pos bashes were uncontested, unless the sides were evenly matched or the pos had some real strategic importance you wouldn’t get a fight over it
---
FREE BEWALK
---
FREE LENNY KRAVITZ2
---
BURN NULLSEC TO THE GROUND
---
This'd almost make me resub, except for the fact that it means nothing for me, nor does it magically fix the game. Nice, tho.
---
Sure.
---
I mean, I live in a wormhole so I'd be kinda disappointed lore-wise if it was CONCORD and not some Drifter themed thing, but still.
---
Note that if I saw this happening I'd immediately put out a PSA to my corp-mates, and we'd probably spend our ratting time trying to map out the new mechanics at first. But if we determined that it was really just a, say, 1-in-10 chance that my ships just explode with no warning, then I factor that into the isk/hr and if it still makes sense I do it.
---
This might be anoying, but anything what changes up the current state of Nullsec is ok for me.  
---
I would love seeing CCP having the same balls on ballance changing &amp; patch works
---
This whole thing, is over exacruated.   
---
Lore started around 2015 End of Jan or beginning of Feb.  
---
When Drifter AI was introduced, everyone aplauted. On that same event CCP stated that this same AI will be future developed and brought to all eve.   
---
There is not a single capital kill out of J space where only drifters are involved.  
---
Timing was good as the "North Deployment" KB don't show fuel, ammo, time spent for killing structures against opponent who did not have resources or will to fight this war anyways. 
---
I applaud to CCP, great job, keep at it.  
---
PS! I still think NCPL is a cunt, but not you PH, you are breath taking. Love you!
---
Or... In a few weeks sleepers, rogue drones, or whatever invades lowsec.
---
OMG you are right, Triglavian and Drifters will have the final battle at lowsec, and build a gate to Stain and terminate Sansha, the Corrupted Narodyna!
---
Everything is coming together!!!
---
Is there a correlation of the likelihood of drifter attacks and number of player owned structures in the system? In my mind this would be a viable way to limit structure proliferation and even open some interesting warfare options in enemy systems close to a hypothetical structure limit...
---
Anyone up to clearing a system and check?
---
Finally more PvE
---
Fight the power!
---
At least VNI and other subcap ratting/mining bots will have to take a day off
---
There is? I wanna use my supercarrier for once
---
That's no question.
---
Killboard queens..... i like that :D
---
As long as you don't need to take gates where there are "Anchoring" rats, you should be fine yeah. Just, don't linger too much around gates &amp; stations.
---
Because the way eve works mechanically you really unless you have a leadership position, don't have that many tools to screw over your corp mates. ( assuming a corp is well setup ).
---
took you 3 weeks for a comeback, and thats it?  
---
 woah
---
Lol who goes anywhere in anything bigger than a frig without a scout? You’ve had it too easy for too long son  it’s made you lazy
---
The biggest difference is there is a structure next to them these day's that can delete a random ship in your fleet.
---
Being non-risk aversion and being stupid and feed only have a slight difference.    
---
And they will both be laughed by people like you on reddit.    
---
Between being laughed + lose 10b and being laughed + lose nothing, you know what people will choose.
---
Only if someone is manning it. Deathstick pos's (which were at the time i believe completely Auto Firing) managed to kill a few people in fleets i was in back in the day trying to attack something on stick JBs.
---
&gt;
---
CCP went full aggro.
---
  GOOD.
---
Imagine one day alien life visits earth and this is what they find we do with our spare time.
---
They have instagib ratting ships. And then pod you. So what reactions do you want to see? :-D Is real player the one that ragequits? :-D
---
There is no isk/hr. The null sec drifters don't give any meaningful loot. Highest drop we had defending structures yesterday was 9m.
---
Go do PvP in some small and cheap ships imho. You can get isk by extracting a moderate amount of skills. At optimal mapping and +5 implants you get nearly four injectors per 30 days. If you need more isk just do any of the isk generating activities as much as you like them. You can also join fleets by NPSI groups. I always enjoyed bjorn bees fleets for example.
---
*Goons unite null to invade highsec starting a new Jita riot*
---
#CCP: Drifters are now 10x in number- And any structure they hit is an instant kill
---
  *fire in CCP's eyes*
---
&gt; So how did they push you off the structure?
---
  Because everyone was scared to lose their ship in the fight no doubt
---
Good shout
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
I think someone that is actively paying attention would have enough to get off grid if they started to warp the second they appeared. The problem is people have gotten lazy and complacent and they are used to running them without having to pay much attention. 
---
I believe the Drifters were set up to be able to reach across Anoms. Not only do you have the lore aspect of them being a super advanced race, but if they were a tool being used to combat botters, it would make sense for them to be able to have range to cover the whole anom. Bot makers are smart enough to try to use any method they can to exploit weaknesses in the AI behavior. You see it like when players use long range battleships to outrange rats in sites. 
---
I honestly think it's making a mountain out of a molehill. I've played in Null and the rewards for SOV far outweigh the risks, especially for the large entities. Some kind of challenge needs to be put back in to owning Sov. Players have failed at engaging other player entities to drive content and have removed most risk by allying with almost everyone they can. I think this change does a number of things for Null Sec that needed to be done for a while. It's too bad the players would rather complain because it's not EZ mode anymore rather than appreciate the bigger picture.
---
The issue is that right now dread bombs lose against supers + faxes unless the numbers get stupid, now if the standing fleet is decent you will also be losing all those dreads.
---
&gt; in a massive slope of ~~online players~~ krabbing alts
---
 Good. Fuck 20 rorq alts.
---
I don't know why anyone would care what somebody across the internet thinks if they had fun blowing up some spaceships
---
DO IT
---
this tbh fam
---
Fingers crossed
---
Not really a small fleet could tank a dickstar without too many issues you take out the guns that hurt and you're done camp setup. 
---
Total setup time like 5/10 minutes now in order to clear the stuff that hurts you have to hit 3 timers of multiple days.
---
Sure if you are the winning party :)
---
And sure if the other side do not bring 3x people.
---
Sovereignty used to be based on POSes. Some systems have dozens of moons. Every single one would have a POS on it that a player put there. There were literally thousands and thousands of POS in space.
---
https://www.engadget.com/2009/09/09/breaking-the-chains-of-sovereignty-in-eve-onlines-dominion-expa/ 
---
You can mine every one of those moons, but you have to put a citadel on it. That's thousands of citadels on its own. The other big mistake was not making a maximum amount of citadels that could be anchored in each system. 
---
CCP is treating the symptoms, not the problem. They're just randomly deleting individual players in space instead of deleting the mechanics that caused null to be so broken. They nerfed VNIs instead of drone mechanics. They nerfed rorquals instead of endless mining anoms with 5B isk worth of ore that are almost afkable. They nerfed fighter damage instead of making havens and sanctums stop endlessly respawning over and over. Now they're doing this. It's not fixing any broken mechanics and it's actively keeping people in subcaps from undocking.
---
That reminds me of SolForce from Sword of the Stars. That was their official motto, but SolForce members sometimes prefer "Repensum est Canicula" as many either survivors or lost family during the Hiver Attack. 
---
Also the original game was also one of the more unique 4x strategy games. Especially where games like Galatic Civilizations 2-3, Stellaris do not allow for controlling individual ships or even targeting individual voxels on target ships
---
Right, thanks, that's exactly why i picked it up too. :P
---
But like i said, not many out there.
---
I don't always need to win to have fun. Maybe you need you rethink your attitude about recreational activities. Nobody likes to play cards with the person that doesn't like losing
---
The inputs during and after the kill. Looking for replacement, talking to corp mates what happened, etc.
---
Now, if a butchery was next door, supplied by pig farms ....
---
Barghest too, if you can somewhat invite the pricetag.
---
Them's good ppl afterall ... salt of the earth !
---
To selflessly adress the swarm of locusts that are destroying the land ...
---
Templin sadly only covers mainstream sci-fi it seems. I can remember having watched a video about why megacorps would make bad governments and even though the Caldari were mentioned, they were just a side note mentioning that he basically couldn't say anything about the Caldari.
---
I dont even know anyone of those beside Mittani because i saw him on twitter... i even tried to get blocked by commenting something he said, instead he liked it... that must be his way of getting more bees, but i dont fall into this trap ever...
---
dont join the hive
---
Well please keep in mind that talking about NPC have more balls than Players in the first place is pure stupid.
---
Surprise motherfucker!
---
No entosis on ceptors
---
No, u r botting bitch.
---
I recommend joining wh corp (my corp is POS Party btw...). Thing about wh corps is you wont be just another line member or F1 monkey, people will get to know and remeber you, its a more tight knit community than most null sec blocks. Isk making is very good as well. Also its free-for-all, no blue donut here.
---
Jesus christ dude go find another place to rat without them or stay aligned and boogie
---
Theres tons of other ways to make money than sit in a metad out fit cruiser or battleship and rale in isk while watching netflix. Ways that make you vulnerable in the sandbox
---
With all the whining on reddit about "instakill" drifters, everyone seems to be failing to mention that if you're at your keyboard and aligned you will be fine.
---
Casual, you can check out abyssals in hisec for engaging 20m activity, fun and decent isk. Also a good way to brush up on piloting skills!
---
Why dont you make isk anyother way then. Theres different ways to make it which have bo drifters
---
If your fleet isn't stupid it's not that hard to devang a pos without losing anybody in a t1 cruisers with a couple of logi guy's ( like think a 20/25 man group could easily do it without taking losses ) especially because the pos loses fitting space because of the Jump bridge ( even more if they also dump a cyno beacon on there ). 
---
Like sure you could lose a ship to a deathstar but if you had done it a couple of times it was a rarity, now if the citadels say [1] it's russian roulette.
---
Go to a different system? Use your intel from your giant nullbloc to tell you were drifters are? Are you dense dude
---
It's almost like it's summer again. Oh, wait...
---
They go to anoms dude. Litteraly not in every system. Go next door. Look around. Go do other things in eve.
---
What about when i jump through a gate in my caracal whilst hunting botters and as i click warp on the next gate 50 drifters appear and instakill me. there is literally nothing you can do, reaction speed be damned.
---
&gt;wormholers need to disrupt SovNull industry whenever possible. 
---
Why make my personal gameplay shit? like there isn't really all that much fun in shooting rorquals when you could be fighting mcav.
---
Towards which path though?
---
Imagine owning yourself this hard.
---
A TAPI member trying to spin a narrative? Say it ain't so!
---
&gt;grax
---
well im not saying they should just random take out players. but having real danger instead of anoms you can run afk while watching netflix is an improvement. remove their instalock and insane range and it should be fine.
---
Go look how many Paris(es) they have....
---
Perhaps one day people will stop taking cancer that is alts for granted. This won't be the day in EVE, though.
---
Remove NPC bounties completely. Loot can be reprocessed and sold, there's your ratting reward.
---
ISK can be generated by missions and stuff.
---
This is about the only good thing to come out of the drifter invasion.  Im watching their killboard tick over at a 100 kph and wondering how long before real players in null stop logging in.
---
Or the bounties drop in the form of tags, like wormhole blue loot.
---
Running doesn’t help with these, they come out of warp very fast, much faster than a normal battleship, and the second they land you’re locked and scrammed. I guess if you were already aligned with your mouse on the warp button you could survive, but doing anything else, even just tabbing between chat channels, is enough to get you killed
---
I think Dora 6 is a spy!
---
Yeh. You CAN but you need passable skills
---
Can we compromise and just go with Constellation chat instead?
---
This article aged well.
---
These drifters don’t have a doomsday. And since there isn’t a HIC drifter, a cap can just jump out well before it is in danger, even if it’s no tank max krab fit. 
---
You’d think people would actually figure out how the mechanics work before talking about them, especially after they’ve been out for a while, but I guess not. I suppose you’re also going to say we should dscan to find them?
---
&gt; That's roughly what a highsec wardec feels like for a new player.
---
Are you saying that this is a good, satisfactory feeling this game needs more of?
---
That was the "end of Q2 push" for money to report to shareholders.
---
WoW did the same. Shame what happened. All must milk the customer to report success or stocks drop. Quite a flaw in our system.
---
I like it. I hope ccp sees this.
---
The problem is, it doesn't solve the issue with the game proper unless CCP follow up with changes to structure system and maybe some other features. Otherwise all these events will achieve is that Null warfare will degrade even further, this time into literally "wait for NPCs to kill enemy stuff, defend your stuff from NPCs".
---
That doesn't sound like an interesting game to play.
---
I bet they attack depending on number of tears and quantity of salt
---
Drifters exists in C5/C6 since the first drifter update (2015?)
---
Only Arithmos Tyranos lives in wormhole space, they show up on combat sites and stay in system until they're dead.
---
They attack every capsuleer and upwell structures.
---
There is no more or less drifter than before the null bloc invasion.
---
&gt;everyone quit playing now.
---
That would sound amazing, coming from the greatest non-player of this game.
---
lol no
---
They’ve killed 2. Not very impressive. If they had an intelligence to seek and destroy low power structures, and follow up on timers, they’d probably have killed a hundred at minimum
---
Anyway... Are miners usually aligned at warp speed, bot ones or not? I have a feeling that they're not
---
For now they can just spread them out so structure bombs don't erase them as easily.
---
That is actually a pretty good idea as it benefits every area of space
---
Why would you want a chat system small enough that bots could use it to avoid being ganked?
---
Oh.  I get it.
---
\*dies*
---
I don't get why ccp don't just do it, it would instantly remove like 90% of bots, and make the game a better place :)
---
t1 industry doesn’t make any isk at all. Half the profit margins are negative. 
---
If all t2 industry except for rigs gets moved to nullsec, it is going to be annoying for hiseccers. Not game destroying, but annoying. Which is the goal, after all
---
I don't see how it would impede on the dynamics of hisec, lowsec, or null.  The only players impacted would be ones using local as a means of protection.
---
Yea, as much as I love the whole ordeal, the "ignoring DMG cap" is a bit dumb
---
Get fucked!
---
Sadly they will probably update their bots to warp away from drifters soonTM
---
Kinda the point I was making, take a fleet to horde space and you’ll get a brawl not a bunch of supers shoved down your throat :p
---
Now we just need Jamyl to come back as the Blood Raider Queen
---
Im sure its a temporary thing to prune citadels down and force overextended alliances to compact a bit.
---
im mentally handicapped and did not manage to finish high school how will this help me get dem dank 260m ticks in my vexor afk issue?
---
I think many people are averse to waste literally hours of their life on fucking nothing while they're supposed to be having some sort of fun
---
no.
---
so far it's following the same pattern as trigs - a week between escalations, but it's escalating on wednesdays not tuesdays for some reason.
---
Look, I simply will not have more than 1 ship per citadel.  Anything less os barbarism.
---
i was talking more 5-10man kitchen sink fleets mate, any orginised fleet wouldn't even blink at a deathstars guns, which lets be honest, even a Fort being 200km away (within gun range) isn't that much of a deal to a t1 cruiser gang with logi support, the only real problem your talking about comes from trying to catch someone on a keepstar grid, and if your planning on fighting in range of a hostile keep, your either planning for pod express, or dont give a shit anyway......lol
---
Barrage Satan
---
&gt; I said they threatened to ruin the game to hurt ccps profits
---
So you are saying that CCP heard threats to make shit tough for their customers and proceeded to make shit tough for their (other) customers themselves?
---
Not the most logical course of events.
---
To me this looks like CCP are adjusting drifter NPC behavior to ensure they threaten space they spawn in, in some meaningful manner.
---
Big corps will weather this much easier than the smaller ones as they have the logistics and manpower the smaller ones lack. The real victim is the smaller corps
---
as long as there is a set mechanic and it's not "woops god mode this time omegalul!! ezclap" then it's fine
---
"players are really weird these days" (c) CCP
---
I think there are other retirees who are more deserving of that title than I am but thanks! :)
---
Highseccers would be able to socialize more when running missions, mining and such.
---
Except The Forge lol they'd be fucked
---
if players can match that strength it's fine, otherwise its just admin abuse.
---
IF you want to use titan-headshotting doomsdays at random you better as hell give players a way to prepare that isn't legit blueballing the drifters (as if the irony isn't enough)
---
I knew they were in sites but I didn't realise they also attacked structures in WHs. So basically WHers are sat there like "business as usual".
---
wtf i love drifters now
---
Anyone in the Forge constantly isn't going to have regional chat up anyway.
---
&gt; just appeal to high sec instead
---
How do you even imagine it? Most hiseccers that aren't alts of people living elsewhere won't probably even know somebody is trying to "appeal" to them? And even then, what will they do?
---
The northern war was definitely going to keep going. Mittens was talking about invading Malpais and Vale of the Silent. Gotg has just taken Tenal without a real fight because they had goons backing them up, with the goon superfleet gone they would definitely be attacked. There’s almost no true peacetime in null, just smaller and bigger wars. 
---
Test and Frat could have tried fighting, and with the current drifters would possibly have been ok just ignoring them. But the drifters are changing pretty much daily, and drifter supercaps have been seen on Sisi, so taking a risk by deploying could easily end in drifter titans that ignore reinforcement and damage cap volleying structures. Sure, that probably won’t happen, but it might, and something is definitely going to happen with the drifter supers, so best to be prepared. 
---
And again, no one is going to quit because their structures are getting bashed. If they deserve to have them then they should be able to defend them. If they can’t, then their structures will burn, and they will move on. And hopefully get something of an idea of what null is dealing with. 
---
And it’s obviously temporary. After it’s over null is going to get back to the wars, those are just paused, not over. But because CCP is changing the rules on the fly and not telling anyone in advance, we’re going to play it safe until it does blow over.
---
In WH it's structure that kill drifters.
---
Yeah i dont think they realized this balancing the boats. Like yeah okay go about lowering this and tweaking that
---
But is this fun, or is this some way to balance something easier?
---
this is a bad idea
---
Not enough data yet.
---
I’ve lived in lowsec for 11 years never not scout.
---
nowhere in eve is supposed to be safe and risk free, 
---
alts have always been a thing, I have 3 accounts, for small gang pvp I prefer to just use 1 combat character I’m  a pretty good pilot using 1 character, passable with 2 dog shit with 3 but I know some really good pilots who can multibox 4-5 characters in  frigate small gang pvp it’s not even funny I cant do that but all credit to them for being able to do it.
---
Can’t get rid of alts as it would lose maybe 60% of accounts any1 who’s serious about pvp has 2 accounts minimum most likely more l.
---
Now if your an industrialist you properly have 7 accounts ccp would be cutting their own throat
---
And why is that?
---
oh yay my face made it
---
Bots lack an understanding of context.
---
Yes, business as usual. But there is only one drifter spawn per site, and they only attack structures that are aggressive against them, as long as your citadel dont shoot drifters, they wont come to bash it.
---
This is good because you can get more offers out to people for contracts and get your Corp advertisements out farther
---
It’s bad because more spammers arise and scammers n other stuff
---
Also it might be laggy
---
But a good idea non the less
---
Q1 mate, financial year starts in April usually
---
But also
---
"We don't care about losing structures, we just don't want to have to fight these guys."
---
Not a Dayum was given....
---
It’s literally impossible to be aligned all the time. You can technically align back and forth between two points and then you’re only vulnerable while turning around, but doing that is extremely annoying and not worth it just to possibly save a 20 mil mining ship.
---
Hero bomber padding his killboard.
---
Null has always been safer then High though, as Null sec you KNOW everyone wants to kill you, in low sec most people want to kill you, in High sec fuck knows whos trying to kill you until they log in the real war accounts or gankers.........
---
Unfuck the geddon?  It's maybe one of the strongest solo battleships since it gets multiple utility highs, a bonus to neut range, and it's dps comes from drones so you can actually apply it to smaller targets.  It's the REST of the battleships that need to get unfucked.
---
Exploration and pvp with a (instawarp) Hecate are still ok, so I’m doing that, but it’s still annoying. You can’t fly anything between a destroyer and a capital anymore. And since I can’t fly caps, it’s pretty limiting. Also the anti-drifter fleets are super boring, I’ve only been on one and I am still trying to convince myself to be helpful and join another
---
o7
---
Someone make a post out of this! 
---
Reapers with drifter faces photoshopped
---
I was wondering...  
---
New month is already 4 days old and nobody said "remove local"...
---
Except they do. as a solo pvper I'd happily fight the capital spam over ram jag spam that horde utilizes, at least you can change grid easily against caps, but you're useless against jags that warp, align and move faster than you
---
Does mittens really keep that tight a reign on his leadership structure? I have no clue as to the way goons structure shit.
---
After the American Revolution, Kentucky was settled by a lot of patriots. They started naming places after the French who helped secure the victory. This is how we ended up with Versailles, Louisville, and Bourbon  County (named after the French Royal family, the drink came later) to name a few.
---
An honorable mention is Lexington Kentucky. It wasn't a French name, but held a lot of significance to the patriot settlers.
---
Oh yeah I like the barg, it's a beast and annoying as shit to fight.
---
Sure, if there was something that being a good player could do to mitigate it. Currently just being undocked in null is a constant rng that ccp will delete your ship and there isn't really anything you can do about it. How would you like it if your ship was popped by overpowered npc that just spawn in grid and instalock and scam you?
---
I'm curious? How would you adapt to drifters instawarping in on you that you can't see on Dscan or probes.
---
Seems to be everywhere now. Who knows what it will be like tomorrow, though
---
It's ok though cause I'm commander Shepard
---
#and this is my favourite store on the citadel
---
You can't, that's why it's bullshit. This guy i replied to is mad that the way nullsec has decided to adapt is to make the game less fun for all the people smugging vicariously through drifters. He's complaining null is coming for him. That's why i told him to adapt or die.
---
Wormhole drifters are a lot different than null ones. Much smaller groups, much more predictable (they don’t ignore damage cap, or change behavior daily), a little stronger with their doomsday, and they actually drop quite a bit of loot, rather than the 5 mil the null ones seem to drop.
---
CCP brings out something that pisses off one group of players, other group of players laughs at them. no surprise really........  
---
some people saying this will stop people undocking, which i can both agree with and disagree with, i've seen a few corp mates move shit to NPC stations, and decide to "take a month or so break" from the game. i've also seen people getting excited about what this could bring to the game, personally i'm going to hold judgement and see where CCP is going with this....  
---
Also just wanted to add at the bottom of this post, if this is making people not undock it wont effect NC./PL as it seams after the cit bashing goons and friends were doing in the north before this started proved that most of there members dont know how to undock anyway...... \^\_\^
---
The great purge of 2019 still underway. Good
---
To WH space, lads!
---
So far it doesn’t seem like they depend on anything. The initial attacks seem to be in CCP chosen systems, and now they’re pretty much everywhere, but there is still no correlation between anything, from structure amount to low power structures to system indexes that correlated with drifter spawns
---
I bet, they only attack those, who stupidly attacked the most Lancers in the past... ;)
---
I. Just. Don't. Even. .... Forced pve... CCP not fixing the game but just spawning npcs because they presumably have no idea what they need to do..
---
regional jita spam. fuck that noise
---
Send me a mail in game (same name) - we do prearranged ops rolling/roaming from our NSS WH 2 nights a week, if the fit is any good, you and your peeps are welcome to join for variety.
---
reddit is primary?
---
BitWarden is also a nice free alternative which includes browser plugins and mobile apps.
---
It is also Open Source for those who care about such things.
---
Haven't been in eve for a bit, but I thought insta warp T3 dessies had been whacked with the nerf bat?
---
It's eve, it runs on tears.
---
I found it. Fireside w/ Mittani and meta show both covered it
---
this suggestion is just as amazing as every other time it's posted every day
---
Wasn't is adapt or waot for the changes?
---
/s
---
I'll keep that in mind, right now we're still doing our own thing but I appreciate the offer.
---
your exchanging intel about 1 system for intel about a lot more systems.
---
think of it like this, I am generic goon crab using my 7 rorquals and paying close attention attention to regional chat, all of a sudden i see +15 and each of those players belong to ih/hk etc. I dont have to rely on other people (as in I dont have to rely on that people people reporting that ih/hk have rolled in through local intel) when I get 100% accurate and instant regional intel instead, i begin red core as soon as you roll into delve and the umbrella gets a heads up and is on alert before you have even tackled anything.
---
It also makes using quiet unused systems pointless, it becomes a lot harder to set up incursions into hostile regions. lets say I am a member of test on the lookout for a reported snuff dreadbomb targeting eso, I dont have to place eyes into every quiet system in stain to keep a look out, I just put 1 toon on the border from stain,paragon and feth and now I know of any possible dreadbomb from very little effort on my part. I can have perfect intel from multiple regions out.
---
Or say I am using my nyx to hotdrop ratters and I am staged in a empty system, where usually no one would know if I have logged on or not, now people instantly know if my hot dropping toon is active or not.
---
So yes your idea may help for some small-scale kills, it really hampers trying to plan anything medium sized+ that relies on surprise, which your very own group would suffer from.
---
It would be a lot harder for hk to get those big killmails because anyone can just pay attention for new toons in regional chat.
---
I think a big difference is the fact that you can longer have fights on the weekends too. With the ability to choose a specific day, if you have TZ superiority (or if it's a fucking awful TZ for the enemy) then there is no reason not to set your day to Wednesday or another mid-work week day, because you do not want to give them the ability to flex their TZ. 
---
For example, a European alliance that is active 17:00-23:00 evetime during the weekday can flex on the weekend (since most people have jobs or school 9-5). into russian tz, and some asian timers by waking up early, or stay up later on a saturday to flex into eastern US tz fairly well. Citadels with chosen day allow you to avoid the weekends where players outside your TZ have more leeway in their eve playtime. 
---
As an example, DeadCO have one of the strongest asian/aussie TZs in the game. Why give people weekend timers when europeans could wake up early or americans could do late nights for?
---
:) Figured it might be a way for you guys to dip back into the NSS stuff without committing as fully and getting burned out on it.
---
Tbg at this poibt in time echochambersarebad4u is more believable than C C "every skill point on the market will be trained by somedy" P
---
Is was the rational choice, if your territory is being attacked by unannounced content you go and defend it, who the Fuck wouldn't? 
---
If the devs target a player base with overly powerful npcs then that player base is going to rally together.
---
I started playing like a year and half ago, and got into hecates like 6 months ago, so I really can’t say. 
---
But the Hecate is still naturally instawarp (I need a cheap implant, but only because I have low skills), and still capable of murdering anything t1 cruiser and down if it can get close. 
---
No idea if it was the other t3ds that got nerfed out of being instawarp, because none of the others are, or if the Hecate used to be even stronger, but it still is working amazingly for me, I usually kill at least double it’s value before I get killed myself.
---
Didn't they nerf VNIs? Why is anyone still flying these
---
The sad thing is my 3 account subscriptions  are due next week, and for the first time ever, Im considering not paying up.  I've got my required amount of paps for the month, (thanks for that Drifters),  its sunny and warm outside and the game is just not as engaging at the moment.  This may be a Boon for the FW dudes, or maybe even RvB.
---
Agreed, battleship lock on times are criminal. It doesn't even make sense
---
This article fails to mention that you need the 1Password X browser plugin, and not the other one called 1Password Extension. (It's more of a 1pass problem, but still, they are doing a "guide")
---
Why do people keep saying this lol. You can't warp away in time, if they land on grid you are basically just going to die with 0 counterplay
---
But they show Sansha in the trailer while saying ancient enemy azdaja?
---
It's like you don't value
---
#immersion
---
I think in sov null CCP should just delete the structure timer entirely. Make it an empire only thing.   
---
So you would do the shield timer, then 24 hours later you have the armor timer which would now be the final timer. If it loses all armor it just dies. You now have weekend timers back where people can be more flexible with their timezones so it mitigates a lot of the TZ tanking shit, you now have much less batphone/blob/blue donut shit happening when you only have 24 hours to rally defenders instead of an entire week. Headshotting Keeps is a thing, Headshotting Sotiyos is a thing, make eve dangerous again.
---
Didn't a null group kill a heap of structures in high sec because they decided they didn't like freeports or something like that? I remember a post not long ago from a group saying they were just giving up due to this.
---
Maybe this is just CCPs way of telling people to stay in their lane or they will repaint the road.
---
Yeah that could work. I would like if every ship in the game could be tweaked slightly with optimizations that don't require subsystems or modules or anything though. Like adjusting scan resolution, max speed vs acceleration, max locked targets vs lock speed, etc
---
Is that patch even out yet?
---
Because structure bashing and pve is enganging content
---
Adapt or die
---
&gt;it would instantly remove like 90% of bots  
---
It would temporarily make them useless till a workaround is in place. I would believe most people here that they don't see that but i believe you are one of the people that are smarter than that and should actually know this.
---
Depends on jurisdiction. Here in Ireland financial year is 1January to 31 December.
---
Anecdotally it seems you can make it if you are aligned. But yes it’s damn hard.
---
If you don't warp before they land, you die. But I'm sure you're always aligned out and ready to warp within 1-2 seconds since that is their lock time
---
Might have to Pyfa warrior it...
---
finaly someone managed to kill that astra haha
---
Let the Drifters drift to high sec and see how the players like it
---
they just removed any incentives to fly anything smaller than a super in null right now
---
Which will make the high sec turbo krabs even more "REEEE" soon
---
Because it's not interesting
---
Losing ships to retardedly OP NPCs surely feels engaging and fulfilling.
---
+1 for including the NPC meme.
---
I always saw the training queue system as a way to avoid MMO grinding mechanics, which this sounds like to me.
---
I mena I think mining need a revamp in its gameplay but you just want to turn mining rorqual into carrier / super ratting followed by salvagers ... how is it better ?
---
This must be the absolute worst idea ever posted here.       
---
And that is saying a hell of a lot.
---
It requires you to be aligned non stop so you can't really do things like sig tanking anymore. And you can't fly endlessly so you're still likely to die while you start moving to get the required speed to start warping.
---
It's just such an obnoxious mechanic right now
---
Check the killboards. It's mostly random players doing regular stuff that are being hit, not VNIs
---
Hopefully they come to high sec as well
---
Yeah, Ive been thinking about how I can adapt my gameplay to engage with an Enemy playing GOD mode, havnt got there yet.
---
remove this post
---
But you have WH space for those mechanics. Null is where players can create empires.
---
Hey now, that's an OPTIONAL reinforcement timer to Rorquals!
---
TIL empires can't be created in lawless space /s
---
The real victims will be the small blocs
---
Bored null blocs will jump at a chance to shoot shit
---
Small blocs will lose members and structures
---
LOL
---
Isn't that the same corp with the input broadcasting Arty-Blap-Multibox (Nados/Muninns)
---
&gt; if this continues much longer there won't be a huge amount of PvP content as everyone is being besieged by jumped-up incursion rats.
---
Pfff you don't get it NS directors had to burn everywhere gunning citadels for *a whole week*, how dare you compare that to the 3 years of dryer content, impssoble roams and for ever fucked LS ?
---
That was fast.
---
Not the worst idea. I suggest a small change: Mining NPCs should continue. Why? From a physics-view you never cann reprocess all ressources of a wreck. There will always be a loss and some day there will only be The Mittani in the last ship available. So, better when at least the NPC mining fleets still exist ;)
---
Yeah, it is pretty nice that the spam is semi-contained to Jita and doesn't spread over The Forge
---
Thing is, we're not talking about null sec not being safe here. We're talking about dying on gates with no prior warning, or way to fight back. This entire thing made me have a little break from eve since I don't really feel like dying to an infinite swarm of overpowered npcs.
---
How about you appear in local when decloaked
---
You mean players shouldn't work together to build empires in a sandbox space empire game
---
i think i just had a brain aneurysm.
---
Why are people over reacting like this is permanent and that they're doing it to make up for something
---
It's literally just a op lore event
---
Diamond pirate rats fleeing from NS would be my guess.
---
you have 20 gorillion structures in delve, each gate has like 7 perches, fucking use em
---
Stay away from wormholes. Don't mention it. Don't come here with Your spodbrains nor try to brake only not broken part of Eve. We don't want You here.  You've already broken null. Stay there and eat that ... You have made. Drifters  apparently are happy  about wormhole playstyle and will not attack unless null will move to wh. Oh wait... no local... nvm.
---
My Reddit bio always says it.
---
Awesome

Darmok and Jalad... at Tanagra

I'm not overreacting, I'm stating the fact that it's taking a game-wide sort-of-incursion to see the sort of killboard activity which by rights should be present every day in eve. I'd love if this was being done by players and not simply by rats.
---
&gt;NPCs bashing Structures
---
&gt;make mining NPC-exclusive
---
CCP should also make NPC defense fleets and NPC interceptors hunting for NPC Miner so we never ever have to undock again.
---
Maybe even an automatic NPC spinning of my ship in the hangar? :thinking:
---
The jackdaw is still naturally insta-warp. I don't think the other two are though.
---
Well atleast then CCP put on a fight in the war against botting, for a period.
---
Sure there will always be a level of work arounds, but once again it about making it harder &amp; harder for botters since as you say there will always be a "fix"
---
CRY MOAR!!!
---
Just make jita a seperate node like it already is :)
---
BS.
---
What a fucking idiot.
---
More people working together can accomplish bigger things, it's human nature. Null is just an extension of that. Giving players the ability to own space and actually exclusively live there will inevitably lead to mega coalitions. No matter what mechanic is put in place, players will find a way to work together if they can accomplish more.
---
Im about too petition a refund of my 3 yearly subs because this is not the game I paid for....   Either this, or we ignore the drifters and all move to high sec by the 10s of thousands.  Put 5000 dudes on every gate outside JIta and keep a steady stream of people jumping or trying to jump in.
---
Gunning rights don't allow you to rip rigs.
---
I think internet should have an IQ check before you're allowed in.
---
IIRC this was something CCP considered/talked about in EvE’s early days (2003/2004). I think they wanted to do something like this.  I forget why they chose not to implement it, it would be hard to speed up some skills though (like how would you speed up fitting skills?).  But would be nice if they could do it.  I like the small bonus idea above.
---
This is actual n awesome idea :)
---
Game is definitely going to lead to a major mega coalition eventually, it's human nature. Also the larger a group is the more resources they have available, so why wouldn't they band together and carve out their own space and grow that space as they get more members, it's kinda what humans have been doing since forever.
---
"The recent patch resulted in a massive slope of online players."  
---
You got anything to back this up with sport?
---
how do u know nullspace is not stage 3 ;)
---
then even one time more: AHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAH
---
I've been saying for 2 years now that the game is shit, that rorquals are shit and that we should rollback to 2014.
---
Meh... Long way from here to there.  This type of comment just pathetic attempt at manipulation of sentiment.
---
HTFU!
---
losing ships to retardedly OP overskilled sp farmers surely feels engaging and fulfilling for the newb
---
We'n'I.
---
Small null blocs? Who are they?
---
No. The issue is that ores are not rare enough. The ore hose that is Rorquals in null needs to be turned off, not replaced with another source that can be farmed ceaselessly.
---
Why roll back mechanic to 2014, just balance the game it's not that hard. Nerf the subcap application of capital even more, fuck up the ewar fighter speed, nerf anomalies respawn time and you already fix half the problem of NS.
---
I kinda agree, excellent opportunity for shenanigans. But, it's boring.
---
The ones that people keep going on and on about that wasnt to move to null and colonise it because they should be able to
---
in other news wow is dieing,gw2 is dieing (insert random mmo with a few mill players) is dieing, run for z hills and fleeeeee
---
Having ratters be spread out would just move the umbrella to wherever it can cover most of them, not remove it.
---
Bwhaaahaha insults get you nowhere little padawan.  
---
Lived and breathed null sec.  Recognised it for the stuff up it is.  And left... 
---
As someone who once memed the 'Minmatar ships are made from scrap and salvage' to the level of building a Nidhoggur out of reprocessed ratting loot, I can tell you two things;
---
1. This idea is possible.
---
2. This idea is completely *shit*.
---
Oh, true. 
---
But jackdaws are pretty useless for solo pvp, since the rocket jackdaw is just horrible and the light missile jackdaw doesn’t have enough dps by itself.
---
Bwhaaahaha insults get you nowhere little padawan.
---
Lived and breathed null sec. Recognised it for the stuff up it is. And left...
---
And do what exactly?  Think I care?
---
ISK/hour..... 🤔
---
Do you do anything beyond farming ISK? What if your roaming fleet gets half killed by some random number generator right in the middle of an evening? Would you still be content with this content?
---
To be fair I messed up by ignoring all the red flags. No guns on the ship and half bil bounty. I deserved what I got lol
---
Last time we saw that crew, we all assumed that they had all had a bit too much carbon monoxide in their pods when when we found the lot of them AFK on a gate.  We poked a few holes in their ships, purely for ventilation purposes, of course.
---
by saying "non-player" i was referring to mittani. XD
---
The thing is, wormholes are an 'Opt-In' known factor where all of the things that can appear suddenly to blast your ass back to k-space are a direct result of player agency. That's really what Eve's crowning feature has always been: **the players drive the game.** Entirely.
---
To somewhat reiterate Mittens' point in a way, we're not playing WoW where we are playing 30th-banana to Mary Sue NPC #'s 1-29, having our hands held through whatever Paint-By-Numbers scenario some designer managed to get through peer review. Coming from the nullsec point-of-view, CCP has given us a playground with some rules, tools, and a faint, "good luck!" as they disappear to observe what we *do* with it.
---
Until one day, literally overnight, they change it. Without any warning whatsoever. Now silly-powerful NPCs are running amok, spawning wherever and warping around to instalock destroy nerds in space from ranges that don't usually even allow for counterplay. They're shooting players' structures, and to top it all off, you don't even get any manner of reward for managing to defeat them. Oh, and just to sprinkle some bacon bits on top of that suck-salad, they're pervasive enough to where its entirely interrupted the actual gameplay that people are interested in.
---
Thus far, it's like we got pulled away from the poker table to be sat down in front of a slot machine that doesn't award anything, and instead just kicks you in the junk when it feels like it. Oh, and then you've got the slack-jawed crowd from the low-stakes "Go Fish" table blubber about how you should bet it all on Black the next time you pull the lever.
---
Yes... Who's the bitch NOW?
---
0-48 hrs was possible, you used to time it 36hrs mostly as to protect against attacks outside of your timezone. The Stront amount could be changed until the tower was finally reinforced. So basically if you could bring an Alt online when the attack was underway, you could really time it into your only primetime.
---
Proud as a wormholer that I am of the "total carnage" that our friend Tyrannos is making to botters. Now it's time that bots get wiped away from this game, and those who are worried of Tyrannos being in their system, get used to it. Learn to survive, and play this game as it was meant to be played.
---
Remove your clothes
---
Nice :)
---
Yeah and it's very most likely going to brign very lucrative PvE invasions
---
Are you not align while super / carrier ratting?
---
is it the beginning of a new era in EVE ?
---
Less api on KM ;)
---
Shame....shame....shame......shame
---
With a Higgs anchor, top speed is reduced enough that you can arrange the hold fills before the rock moves out of range.
---
Why?
---
Didnt see ani drifter camp on npc null...is all about sov space?
---
Obviously pushing all pve into capitals, supercaps, and rorquals is very healthy for the game
---
how do you like them apples
---
u wont see 15 hk/ih ppl. u will see 1-5 (hunters) and prolly wont realize beside all the other orange/red guys
---
[Later that day.....](https://i.imgur.com/H4CwA8x.jpg)
---
Its gonna end. It will not be permanent. And I hope they remove local in wake of the invason, just as Hillmar said at EVE DOwn Under 2019. That would be the much needed shake up in itself, as small gangs will have a chance to hit targets in null-sec again.
---
Go find your old bros
---
And even the lowest person in a society pays taxes.
---
Working as intended then
---
Hey, instawarp frigates/t3ss also work.
---
CCP has officially declared war on nullsec.
---
Pls leave, you are weak, your bloodline is weak, you won't survive eve.
---
How big are your monitors and what res do you run them at to be able to see 15 people join a chat channel that shows A WHOLE REGION at once?
---
&gt;I think
---
And that's where you go wrong. Even someone actively paying attention can't get off grid quick enough.
---
Lol, couple NPCs in null-sec actually threaten someone and "this is not the game I paid for" :D This IS the game you paid for. And EVE is not only about null-sec. Adapt of die.
---
 *u wont see 15 hk/ih ppl*
---
So exatcly what did in the last patches?
---
Just as a FYI I spent last night super ratting and gunning structures on my alts because the drifters can’t do anything to my super and we were being attacked somewhere new every couple minutes. These actually make high end PVE really easy as there are no enemy roaming gangs coming through our space and no alliance fleets going out to fight. The guys in my Corp who like to solo roam stayed logged off or did PVE / drifter hunting from insta captors who got gunner rights or their big toys. This ‘event’ is easy to deal with and I’m not going to tell you or anyone it sucks or is unfair but most people have adapted to it at this point. The only way to do that is to do what I’ve described and park all the fun subcap PVP ships that you don’t want to risk losing to gate jump RNG. This will last a few days to a week and Wednesday will bring something new. I’m hoping it a conclusion to this event. Honestly I’m torn about the end. I’d like this to stop to get back to roams and big fights but on the other hand if the drifters ‘glass’ null and I lose everything the sunk cost fallacy in my head would end and I could finally walk away from this game. Only time will tell.
---
Then go and contribute to the activity. Oh, its almost impossible to do in null-sec these days because of supercap umbrella, PANIC modules and timers? What a shame eh?
---
As many people have said already most of the newbee corps are not a scam. They take in new players and give them an environment where you can learn and grow. There are definitely bad "newbee friendly" though. I don't know any specific ones but Reload made a video about it a while ago [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODl1GkKUKjQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODl1GkKUKjQ)
---
I'd say any of the more established newbee firendly groups are fine. PH, Brave newbros, Karmafleet or EveUni. I've heard the leadership of EveUni sucks but the community are great but that's only what I've heard people say about it.
---
I personally chose Karmafleet and I'm enjoying it this far (5 months in). I don't know how the other newbee friendly corporations do it but in Karmafleet you are provided a place to learn with a great community with many social groups or Special Interest Groups. You can get free skillbooks for basic skills and If you are new you are recommended to fly ewar in fleets and you can get those ships (and other t1 frigs) for free. When you start flying more expensive ships in fleets you will most likely get the whole cost of the ship back (+/-10%) if you loose it thanks to both Alliance and Corporation SRP.
---
What you don't get is someone holding you hand through everything. You get access to a lot (and I mean a lot, my first week I didn't undock once, I spent it reading) information and recommendations. If it's too much too handle there are an alliance wide mentors program and there are both an in and out of game chat and a forum where you can ask questions. With these tools (and I probably forget some) you are expected to learn things by yourself. The information is provided but you will need to do some effort by seeking it out. In fleets you are expected to follow orders. If you don't you will get called out. If you say you are new some people will go out of their way to help you but it's not guaranteed.
---
Karmafleet (and Goonswarm in general) is a large organization and it might seem hard to fit in but since there is so many members you can't most likely find already established groups to join. If you want to be anonymous that's fine too, you are free to take advantage of the community if you want to but if you prefer being alone mining that's fine as long as you participate in at least 3 activities per 3 months.
---
Also, the most important thing (and this is true with any corporation). If you don't like it, just leave and try something new.
---
If I made you interested in Karmafleet you can look here how to apply:
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LKfm2E-JCQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LKfm2E-JCQ)
---
Yeah I was backing up your statement, sorry.
---
Yes. Please remove mining so the value of my stockpiles of ore will skyrocket.  Thanks.
---
Praise to our Drifter Overlords
---
Maximum reinforcement time was higher when having Sov in the System thats why different numbers show up here.
---
Didnt that happened to the amarr fleet in game?
---
No more afk pve...well done ccp
---
Didn't you post this already
---
Drifters cant appear in local ... lore wise. The are not connected to the space internet.
---
Removing local is not within lore aswell ... and it will kill the game ... check activity parameters when chat was down.
---
People die to null alliance blobs all the time though.
---
nullsec deserve to be done
---
&gt;horse shit bubble gum, you son of a burning wagon.
---
I suppose that can be an appropriate response.
---
Created a very safe environnent for empire builder to just turtle up and be safe while nuking any content / whaling fleetout of existence with ease.
---
not yet
---
Well cause goon-dock
---
I want to PVP.  If I wanted to run dungeons with my buddies I would play WOW.
---
For 2 caracters, rattle have a slightely better dps and are more expensive (700-900M for 1 ship)  
---
But, the refitting is easier in Nestor and you can bring your friend in some random VNI, ishtar, or any armor buffer ship wich don't need capa to dps, or another nestor  
---
so : 2 rattle &gt;/= 2 Nestor  
---
but Nestors scales way better
---
Oh look, it's _this thread_ again.
---
A bot can auto align out, spam dscan, and warp out the same millisecond you decloak or warp in. A bot does not get tired. A bot does not make mistakes.
---
Whatever you think hurts a bot more than a human, unless it's a captcha, you're wrong.
---
Well, we can’t just do nothing, that would be boring, and the people who would react that way aren’t the type to get control over any significant alliance. 
---
So, if we’re going to do something, our targets are pretty limited. We can’t go on the offensive, drifters have no home, no infrastructure, no way to wear down their morale. CCP can’t be directly targeted either. 
---
And while this is going on, everyone in hisec is talking about how great this is that everyone in null is under drifter attack. 
---
So, why not attack hisec? Worst case we annoy people who seem to be happy that we’re being annoyed, best case it helps end this invasion early. It’s not going to cost anything, not like hiseccers can shoot back at even a bash ferox fleet, and it’s not going to have any logistics challenge because it’s as simple as ping a fleet and fly it to the timer, there’s no forward staging or seeding contracts.
---
Null alliance blobs can't appear out of thin air without any intel being thrown in the region though.
---
VNIs aren't Till next patch
---
Ah true. CCP should add a carrier ratting tutorial for the new players so they know what to do next time they want to try to rat in nullsec.
---
they obviously didnt do shit
---
Eve is only about null sec. High sec is just the loading screen where wannabe awesome pretenders try to build up the courage to press jump.
---
Region chat would be spammed in some regions that's the only reason I can see to have constellation instead. But with that said I do think local being changed would be good
---
Like the blob? Do you enjoy it?
---
&gt;Implying this whole event isn’t already bullshit
---
I've done my best to contribute to that activity. But it was utterly pointless unless the person you were trying to kill was either a dribbling retard or asleep and nobody wanted to try to save him. Even when I got the cyno inhib online on time before a chunk I've had hostile caps take gates to save it.
---
I do not play EVE to engage with NPCs.  Even drifters are predictable and easily beaten with the META we have.  Some are still feeding but that will go way down as we adapt. 
---
Now we are just being forcefully distracted from PVP activities.
---
after what, 3 years of MER gloating, i don't think this is going to sway anyone
---
Why not keep local but have it like wormholes?
---
Whos crying stupid?  I have made a valid statement.  We are going to ruin your game too. Just wait and see.
---
I, too, follow up my helpful information with a passive-aggressive comment coming across as a pompous asshole for no reason.
---
Ezfix exclude highsec and maybe lowsec from regional and keep them local (maybe constellation for lowsec?)
---
Wrong AND ironic!
---
Hmm, sounds like things are getting adjusted accordingly then. Lets see how it is as things progress.
---
Try most renter groups tbh man (I know some of your corps are deployed against some particularly weak ones in Detorid/Scalding Pass), offer to leave them alone after a few days of leaving an alt in system and ask for 1bil - it’s by far my favourite form of pve. 
---
But you guys might be after complete destruction of their income, I’m just looking for a little extra isk for my quafe zero habit.
---
&gt;If local doesn't exist, bots would all be vulnerable to roaming gangs.
---
If CCP had put it any effort into automated detection over the last decade, the botting problem wouldnt be what it is.
---
You cant get rid of local because most systems are empty these days. You at least want to know if there is a point in being in the system.
---
Make it local in hisec coz of the amount of players per region, regional in null and maybe constellation in low-sec since it doesnt matter as much and it makes it a "medium" danger area
---
Do cormorant fleets, using structure webs on the drifter FC to let bombs land, and using supers from outside drifter aggro range to kill them without any risk not count as min/maxing?
---
The problem is CCP changes the rules every day or two
---
He says, clearly having never been dunked on by a pack of T3's traveling through wormholes.
---
Did they say they’re removing a Local? Serious question, can’t watch the vid.
---
Only a WOW loving highsec basement dweller would think this.  You need to go upstairs to low sec and then through the null sec gate into the sunlight where everything is good.
---
&gt; tons of vni, 
---
CCP used Anti-botting/afk. It was super effective.
---
do you even have any stations left to be hit by drifters after that sad excuse for a war? have you ever actually undocked to experience what drifters are doing?
---
You are being forced to maintain your empire and be a bit careful again, just like nullsec should be.
---
The drifters aren’t scary to a rorqual. They don’t have doomsdays and a rorqual can just panic to call in a few supers to clear off the drifters, and keep on mining. A ratting super or Titan  can just warp/jump out because drifters don’t have a HIC. 
---
This just kills of anything not instawarp that is smaller than dread. Not a good solution at all to cap/ supercapital profiliatipn.
---
Weekly reminder that enforcing one character per player would fix everything
---
(okay not everything but close to everything)
---
So you’re supposed to have to buy the ability to move around safely for the price of $15 a month? And if you don’t want to pay up you shouldn’t fly anything not instawarp ever? 
---
Makes sense 
---
i feel dumb after i got ganked by a drifter today... really sad
---
Oh so you dont think that the Imperium burning across 2 or 3 regions of "my space" was not being forced to LOSE my space.  Fuck maintaining it stupid. 
---
Obviously you have never lived in null successfully. Another highsec risk adverse basement dweller afraid to jump into the null light.
---
Wow, so mittani couldn't get any relevant place to whine from so he went with pc gamer? That's adorable!
---
That was lowsec
---
Has it been triple garunteed though?
---
Gestapo and KGB sees everything
---
I stopped reading after realizing this was a sponsored message from 1Pass. 
---
There are plenty of password managers that exist that aren't a subscription model.
---
Dora\* was one of the few of them where i couldn't really tell if its now a bot or not. He/she/it had really random warp behaviour and you could catch normally 1-2 of them still in belt because he wasn't warping all of them as soon as you popped up in local. Also changed kinda quick the systems when i camped them.
---
Guess that is now finally answered and i can put them on the list. Thankfully ccp will quickly take care of them and he will disappear within the next year.
---
Have yet to see a null alliance blob in a wormhole.
---
They will iirc there was some lore text about Concord doin something to null local soon
---
yes this is getting beyond irritation.   As for there killing bots narrative, IT IS bullshit.  Corpie lost a carrier to this and he does not bot. Has limited play time and needs the isk inflow to  pvp. So congrats CCP now you are shutting down PVP content in favour of PVE
---
If you do that you'll have fewer targets to shoot.  Unless you think people sit in space in expensive stuff waiting for you to appear because they enjoy getting their shit blown up.
---
This would be great.
---
"Drifter Patrol pulls over suspected illegitimate mining operation, suspects shot onsite for resisting arrest and conducting illegal artificial intelligence testing."
---
&gt; we ignore the drifters and all move to high sec
---
i mean, if you don't own a supercap - you may as well.
---
you can't pve in subcaps because drifters are going to fuck you up quick sharp. subcap mining? fucking lol. pvp comes down who can drop the most big toys.
---
so, yeah, i know you're probably being sarcastic but unless you're flying something with a cost of double digit billions - there's not a lot of content left in null.
---
ctrl-a on a chat channel and you will be able to see all those that enter a channel as they arent colored in, besides all hk hunters are pretty easy to tell unless ur using a fresh toon.
---
but this is just arguing specifics, region wide easy intel is bad .
---
Do you have the statement from ccp where they outline their intent with the drifter invasion?  
---
Don't you think it is much more likely that this is an RP event ramping up? If ccp wanted drifters to actually clear structures they would have done so.
---
you can rotate monitors portrait to get more space for lists and stuff
---
This defines throwing ones toys out of ones pram.
---
It should be risky to make isk in null, people just got to relaxed and forgot they are actually living in null space.
---
Finally null space is dangerous again(at least a bit more) :)
---
Best decision ccp have made in MANY years. Keep up the good work
---
Dora is a pretty infamous bot around Frat space. Have you met Cora and her sisters yet? Most of us got tired of reporting it to CCP. Cache is now full of Frat+pets bots.
---
There are drifter in provi
---
As someone who’s new to the game... what exactly is the alternative to krabbing? It sounds like it’s just a derogatory word for anything that makes money lol
---
As far as I know, you can’t fit your ship for both ratting and PvP, or both explo and PvP, or both salvage and PvP, etc. And mining, at least in my Corp, is done with ships like procurers that are super tacky and can run combat drones so you can actually stand and fight (so not krabbing).
---
So what exactly do you guys want? Why get mad at an explo heron watering away from you instead of fighting? They have no guns lol and explo is a perfectly legitimate and profitable activity. Isn’t ganking defenseless “krabbers” a long-standing aspect of the game?
---
Dronelands used to work that way.
---
And, back then, capital proliferation was heaviest in the Dronelands.
---
!remindme 3 weeks
---
Do we know if it was already in a timer?  So now ccp is participating directly in the PvP game?
---

---
No, the OP had a brain aneurysm just before posting.
---
&gt;What do you think about this change can it stop the capital proliferation?
---
considering that right now, the only thing you can rat with is a supercap - i think there's a hole in your plan.
---
Are drifters podding the capsuleers too?
---
Supply and demand. Yes, prices will go up when you reduce supply. However, what happens when that reduced suppy is not able to satisfy the demand? Eventually the price of common T2 mods will increase so much that your average highsec player wont be able to afford T2 guns or tank mods, etc
---
&gt;literally
---
This one time i did a Rookie ship to Battleship roleplay run where I would build the next tier of ship from loot and salvage, and fit it with whatever dropped. Barely got to a cruiser when I got bored senseless.
---
Still better than your posting though
---
i never messed around with Vexors, so i have no idea XD
---
What about Rorqs ratting in belts? That’s the big goal
---
Oh yes, yes they are.
---
didnt want that pvp anyways
---
you can see the blob coming BECAUSE LOCAL
---
this is the internet, you can say "mcshits"
---
You have a poor definition of 'accurate' and 'perfect' then. The 'precision' of the intel is more useful. 
---
Knowing that the neutral is in `1DQ` means you know the neutral is _can't be anywhere else_. But knowing that the neutral is in `Delve` doesn't tell you where in Delve they are. 
---
Way back in the day, watchlisting FCs was a common way to get intel on whether an fleet was forming. Same for notable hotdroppers. Add them to watchlist: get a notification when they log in. Seeing a pile of neutral in Regional chat is pretty similar in my books. It raised the skill needed to operate, but it never outright prevented decently sized fleets, or solo hotdroppers. Regional chat won't prevent you from staging in an empty system. At worst, it'll increase the amount of effort needed to pull it off.
---
I got 200 kills the last week. Getting kills is no problem even tho there's a drifter invasion
---
Are you fucking kidding, you are "allegedly" campaigning in high sec for drifters change how is that not salty
---
Why draw the line there? Remove asset safety, period, make eve worth fighting over again
---
There are so many people in most regions with so many entering and leaving that noticing a "spike" of 10 dudes could very easily be lost in the noise.
---
Its funny how ppl say "this is taking care of bots".... They dont realise that the Mechanics are killing all players  indiscriminately with no chance of "fight back" or "Flee" to players like me...  
---
A Active player should have Means do Defend themselves or even Fleeing...  
---
Actually players Like me are liosign More Money then "bots farmers"....  
---
Besides... if the reason is "bot solution" why are they even Atackign Structures?  
---
And... Why are they only in Nullsec... thers plenty of Bots in High Sec mining as well....  
---
Mechanics should be Switch to a way taht an ACTIVE player could manage to Flee while a bot would be Destroyed and Podded....
---
what does it look like mate
---
bigly if true
---
drifters insta lock upon warp end, cant get away
---
I agree, they should appear in local.
---
When a game begins to feel like a chore its time to take a break.
---
Rorqs don’t die to these, except on gates, because they can’t panic there. In a belt/anom/moon they just light a cyno and let some supers handle it
---
Imagine setting up for a long structure bash then drifters swoop in and one shot it :O
---
Well, then let’s see. 
---
CVA
---
HTP
---
TRC
---
TRU (not sure if this counts as separate from TRC)
---
PHW
---
Care Factor 
---
Coalition Hispania 
---
Severance 
---
Apocalypse Now
---
Sniggwaffe
---
Yep, that’s 10 small alliances effected by drifters
---
&gt;notifybot Structure attacked: JI-K5H - We are broken people now 
---
&gt;notifybot Structure attacked: D-9UEV - Why did I drop this
---
heh heh
---
lol adapt or die faggot, you dont need all those, they are just there for vanity for people
---
Eh, pretty sure there will be plenty of times where rorqs are mining outside of normal hours when the super blobs can’t save them. 
---
Also, if drifters hit enough belts with rorqs even during normal hours, the super blob has to be selective about which ones they can save without getting spread too thin.
---
And so this is how EVE Online dies.... To the Borg... wait no that's not right Drifters... meant to say drifters.... yes.....
---
Should probs go and defend them then :p
---
also america sucks, china numba wan!
---
Congratulations on missing the point. Entirely.
---
But will drifters even bother waiting out Panic? They don’t seem to stick around in one place very long, as soon as they get bored or something happens they warp away
---
They started too late for the fireworks to be on time.
---
Is that all? Or did you break the post limit
---
That looks more like an hour or two max for my notification channel
---
wh space is too safe with the damn fax umbrella reee
---
So? I was stating a factual point.
---
Lots of WH Corp won't accept newbro unfortunately, you need some SP to be effective in WH
---
I am fine, like apples
---
Yeah not sure, that might be the easy way to ignore them I guess. Unless CCP buff drifters to ignore it somehow...
---
Look, it's retarded.
---
if you add 1 nano
---
This is 1 minute after downtime.
---
Thing is that you don't fit PVE ships to do PVP. It cuts down the income to such an extent that it's not worth it; to a point where you make more ISK losing the ship occasionally than fitting it for survival. You fit the ships for max income and evasion, and then when you get attacked you try to bugger off to either wait out the attack or reship into a pure PVP ship.
---
But even that is at a pretty low-level. At a high-level we are talking about capital and super-capital krabbing, where ships just fit a cyno and call in the cavalry when attacked. Of course if you are smart you'll sacrifice some marginal income increases for a bit of tank, but the real *tank* isn't on the ship itself but rather in the support that will materialize on grid with you and save your ass.
---
I might sound like a smart ass but think about this:
---
1. Have less structures
---
2. Get less notifications
---
3. ????
---
4. profit.
---
What is describe above is called "adapting". You need to do this "adapting" like other players have do in different areas of the game when something has changed.
---
they only nerfed the ones needing stance switch for their instawarp, Svipul and Confessor.
---
Ok, thanks, because I would have expected 1000 Reddit threads from each side of the argument. Thought I had missed some drama.
---
literally this. its a fucking joke the game is so boring in these blocs and they just cry there hearts out about drifters.
---
Don't be to optimistic, chances are that an Alpha you brought into that corp to awox the bots will be banned first for "Alpha Account Abuse" huehue
---
You just explained why people krab. I understand why people krab. What I don’t understand is what’s so bad about it if not krabbing means making more money losing a ship than actually doing whatever isk making activity you’ve chosen.
---
Stay classy bro. :)
---
Yeah, just canceled the BBQ.
---
Hopefully you get to soon enjoy the full drifter experience 😀
---
The issue isn't really about safety or non-safety that comes with the drifters. The issue is more that there is nothing you can do against them to react. If another player entity harasses you, you can go and kick their shit in, you can infiltrate them and destroy them from the inside, you can negotiate, you can camp a freaking gate/wormhole to stop them coming in, or you start using guerilla tactics and many more. But no matter what, there is options.
---
With the invasions, you just get wave after wave of overpowered NPC that can ignore damage caps, ship cloaks, everything. They spawn right on target, without any warning, are not economically limited in any way and there is nothing you can do to hurt them. If you kill them, even in numbers, it does not matter, they'll just be back half an hour later and the cycle repeats.
---
I know that a lot of people are salty about nullsec and seem to now ignore any facts in their Schadenfreude and I give you that satisfaction. But what is happening is akin to a dungeon master raining meteors down on the party to just kill them all off without anything you can do to defend yourself. Sure, you can do it, but don't be surprised if it is perceived as unfair and people do not want to play anymore.
---
I heard LS doesn't have drifters.
---
forts were just auto-repairing.
---
We enjoyed it today.
---
If the blocks want to come to high sec and fuck shit up, ill show em a wild ride.
---
I was warping to a belt with my Orca and 2 Covetors and tge drifters were already there waiting for me very close to my warp position.
---
Somehow I managed to cycle my Orca's AB 2 times before warping to safety.
---
I think CCP made them so you can survive them in many circumstances if you pay attention.
---
Sure there would always be a fix, i just personally think that measures to combat botting should happen more on a background level like decreased accessibility of logs for third party softwares (for example) than such massive interference with how the game works itself / gameplay of all players.
---
I’m still waiting for drifters that ignore reinforcement timers. If we’re going to have stupid rule breaking mechanics, might as well go all out
---
i'm sure they'll be hitting wormhole structures soon enough, right?
---
they don't do shit to forts.
---
Or just check every concord lossmail where players decided to whore on.
---
In which case you're still fucked because your only way to access important (to you) things has now been wiped. 
---
As for security if your phone is actually stolen, you're missing something rather crucial. Anyone who has your phone can easily remove the SIM card in a few seconds and completely negating what you deem so safe - remotely wiping it. Or they can just turn the device off, that works too and lets them remove the SIM later. Any "security" that hinges entirely on a handheld device being connected to the internet is super simple for anyone to circumvent.
---
Im unsubbing from this shit game, 6 hours of non stop following shit npcs that give you nothing is not the definition of fun.
---
gj ccp, make us waste our time following shits instead of actually creating pvp content, top level IQ
---
We NEED faxes for defending our assets - OUR TIME SPENT  IN  GAME AT HIGH QUALITY PVP and HARDER PVE than Your endless Anoms. Not to defend indoctrinated slaves by dropping nobrain titan-fax bomb at frig gangs. Please... do not talk about things You have no idea. Btw. faxes are undocked ONLY in serious need becouse You know... they mostly have to be built inside wormholes. It is bigger lost than Your SRP-not-a-problem bullshit m8. Have You ever seen a fax in wormhole excluding structure defence or high number battle?
---
How dare you value you time over some1 else's potential fun!
---
I'll happily reset new passwords and new 2fa codes knowing the fucker who stole my phone won't get anything out of it.
---
  10 years of smartphone use- not one damaged or stolen
---
Rarararararara
---
Imagine litterally logging off because of NPCs. Like at what point does the spodbrain mentality have a limit?
---
NO ONE WANTS YOU HERE ANYWAYS!!!! ADAPT OR DIE! REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
2FA
---
Step One: Open the Eve client. 
---
Step Two: Close Eve client and play something else. 
---
Account Secure.
---
true, I know people who did this in orcas
---
they still died, but they did it
---
Can I have your stuff? I'm in PH too
---
Bruh your name is literally 'Asks for sources'...
---
Did they warp in to an active bashing?
---
That guy with 1.8 mil damage could be just drive-by whoring on it.
---
He basically says things need to change. Everything is to safe so they need to mix it up and create chaos. He would rather take action even if it turns out to be wrong than do nothing at all
---
You're choosing to do so to defend your massive outreach of citadels and space. Can't manage to have active defense of your space? Too bad so sad.
---
Sounds good to me. I feel like one of the devs mentioned delayed local at some point but that may have been a dream.
---
is 1pass open source? if not it's not secure
---
I can't wait to see how many people complain that they can't deal with having to constantly defend their stuff so far away from their home.
---
If you can't manage to have an active defense of your citadels/space, maybe you shouldn't own it.
---
TEST has 17,887 members over 68 Corps.
---
You don't have to cancel your BBQ, you have at least, minimum, 68 Directors, who, I imagine have at least 2-3 people minimum that they can 'Trust' within their corp. so what, that's 136 - 204 'minimum' people that you could have gunning structures, if we're being generous.
---
The larger your group gets, the more structures you place, the more people required to man those structures. Why do **you** need to cancel your BBQ for the shield timer of some structures when you should have enough people to pick up the slack?
---
What are you suggesting here exactly?
---
I wonder if it's because a player was already shooting it, drifters show up and just kill/chase off the initial attackers and just finish off the citadel?
---
Nope, it's just the video of Hilmar saying they (fucking finally) realized that EVE needs to be more dangerous again.
---
Lol you prolly would be afk ratting anyways. Also, you dont have to show up to defend shield timers.
---
TRUST NO ONE! I for one love and embrace our new drifter overlords. Praise be the drifters!
---
Theres more. Quite a bit more
---
Okay!
---
8/10
---
Needs more space cowgirls with laz0r pistols pewpew.
---
And a unicorn.
---
I'm excited to see what happens next!
---
And you completely ignore my point that if you place your 2FA on the item you're most likely to lose or have stolen from you, you're still setting yourself up to be fucked over.
---
Security of the device aside (which is very debatable and mostly depends on how much someone wants your data) putting very important things, with no backup, on the item you're most likely to lose or have stolen is just dumb.
---
I recently moved and had an issue with google; it was supposed to send me 2FA codes to my mail but did not. Because of this i was unable to log in. No recovery options worked (because why would they?) even using a recovery e-mail i had previously set up, knowing exactly when the account was made (10+ years ago, original welcome mail still archived). Big companies like google also don't have any support. I got lucky and the bug keeping codes from being sent got fixed, but if your device is permanently lost then something like a google account is also permanently lost. Kind of a big deal if you use it for business or anything valuable.
---
If you have something so crucial as to be your only way to get access to your online life, IMO you **NEED** a backup of it you can grab and use at any time. A phone is most certainly not that, whereas an encrypted password database + key file + password is easy to spread out and back up in a way nobody can ever use it except for you.
---
I believe this is the point CCP are making.
---
go back to your wormhole your pleb
---
While I agree with you, one thing to keep in mind is normally CCP announces a change in advance via patch notes and announcements before they make the implementation so players have time to strategize how to adapt. They also don't normally release something and then change that event over time. In the past week drifters have come out of nowhere and then they briefly went away and came back with even more ramped up aggressions. Hard to adapt to something you know nothing about that is changing at a pace very quickly. If CCP's intention is to hurt megacoalitions, all they will do is hurt the smaller groups first while the larger groups have the players, income, and timezone coverage to rebuild. Goons can get kicked out of their sov a million times before they start to feel a pinch of concern. Unless CCP changes the actual sov and structure mechanics, everything will just go back to how it was.
---
CCP is finally dealing with the bots.
---
Get more gunners for you're structures or gtfo out of the kitchen.
---
Hmm, maybe make it that when an Alliance leader injects the skin, everyone in the Alliance unlocks that skin as long as they stay in said Alliance. That way if a member sits in the gunner seat the citadel keeps the skin.
---
Where can i find the drifter page ? Just search drifter ?
---
But I mean this change would counter both botting, and the sad points of game logs being used on programs like wintel etc. which I find entirely broken. (ccp should remove chat logs on userend aswell)
---
Yes but LS is shit and full of shitlers.  Well not full, kind-of basically empty.  But still.
---
Inferi*
---
Lets be real clear on this: 
---
Rewards: Theres some loot, BUT YOU ALSO GET TO KEEP YOUR FUCKING STRUCTURES
---
Anyone when goons brings a bagillion supers and kills all your everything with no contest. \*everyones fine\*
---
Everyone when npcs that will die to a few supers start attacking those same structures \*everyone loses their mind\*
---
MAKE DRIFTERS PERMANENT!!!! LETS SEE THEM KILLING RORQS AND SUPERS LEFT AND RIGHT!!!!!! LET IT ALL BURN
---
Well.   That changes everything.
---
It's up to you to not make it empty
---
remove local
---
Dangerous yes, but to who? Not to the Rorqs, nor the bots because as it turns out, the Drifters are built to bust sub-caps. All it does is terrify the living shit outta me in my little Mackinaw, coming back from well over a year away from the game and trying to rebuild as Ive moved into Null literally 5 days ago. Nobody can come save my ass, I dont have a Cyno on an Exhumer, so what am I to do besides sit in dock and pray they go away?
---
Herons can't fight? Let's have a wee chat about that! https://zkillboard.com/kill/74118456/
---
I like it more than I should.
---
Because it’s Valkorsia, same ~~sperglord~~ guy who jerked himself off about bashing PL structures and wrote AARs on reddit about it
---
Herons fitted for explo have no room for worthwhile weapons or tank
---
#Glorious
---
Mmmk
---
because 17,881 of those members just joined because they wanted to be in goons without being a goon.
---
TBF as a null miner ok fine, but what gets me is the total ghosting by CCP on this matter and the CSM as a customer of CCP l think they should let us whats going on so we can pick if we wish to take part in this shit show.
---
I know, I'm just memeing
---
very large oof
---
Its forced game play. How would you feel if CCP forced you to perform a mundane task with no reward 20 times a day or you lose your stuff? 
---
If Drifters are going to attack null sec with superpowers I think balance demands that they "hack" highsec stations and eject players into space randomly and sometimes their stuff.
---
The fact that nobody has any interest in burning 7000 citadels and nobody has the manpower to police all of highsec.
---
#My body is ready. Burn null sec.
---
Not without CCP measuring the size and consistency of my prostate...
---
#Remove local. It only serves the purpose of safety.
---
I do, but it's not mine. CCPs IP so...
---
Well, ccps information policy is also a change that you have to adapt to, so that point is hollow.
---
Abd everybody got so hyped for drifters cleaning space trash it's annoying. Just let ccp do their event and we will see where it has taken us in another week. It's a pretty nifty rollercoaster atm.
---
god bless
---
Exactly this! Three man gang yesterday evening going for some baddies reported in intel. A few jumps to chase them but meh - Drifters camping a gate in between us and them. Turns our 3-man-gang in a dual-roam. So, no content for either them or us - besides the replacement of the spaceship. How is this intended to bring more action into Null? Easy solution: Line up more skills to be learned to end with subscription already paid. Play something else if this shit goes on.
---
Insults get you nowhere bud.  You don't even know what my game is.  Who's the bitch now?  
---
See how that works?
---
Btw, why did you report Valkorsia Reloaded to ccp?
---
Yep. 5 year vet, never skilled into caps. I dont want the pressure of owning one, but this is quite possibly gonna force my hand into startin to build into caps.
---
You did this CCP, I just wanted to happily do my thing in my Exhumer, but now I cant even enjoy that without playing butthole roulette like Freddy Mercury.
---
Because fighting npcs as daily grind makes for a great game. Who needs pvp in an mmo?
---
Fewer.
---
What PVP content?
---
Imagine being this salty... there are plenty of places to do stuff without Drifters, but most of them involve some kind of actual player-driven danger, so it might be too scary for a nullbear like you.
---
That being said, yesterday I spent 3 hours ratting in nullsec with my alt without a problem, so fucking stop bitching.
---
o7m8 also, can I have your stuff?
---
Sweet burn it all and press delete. Fuck Null sec game is shit because of Shitadels and catering to the krabs.
---
Ride out the wave for now. They never said it was purely to combat bots. This is the best kind of shake up we will get and though your wallet may bleed, this is what the game needs. A reminder of the good old days where people thought twice before undocking.
---
Also, I don't know what your friend is ised to flying but a good combat ready AF/Cruiser is only like 50-70m. He had enough money to ride it out
---
Yep. I didnt even leave station yesterday for the first time since I started replaying after a year+ break, because what the shit am I supposed to do in my Exhumer? I just wanna mine Ice goddamnit.
---
Exactly the reason for a radical shake up and some mechanics changes.
---
losing pvp ships on pvp fleets to no-counterplay pve mechanics that just happened to spawn in your way isn't content
---
it is retarded game design
---
Can confirm
---
Well they are great against boters and everything else that happens to land on grid with them and isnt able to warp off in under 1 second.
---
Go do something else....
---
Goons have both
---
Its EVE, you are supposed to fly out there and risk your stuff. And they will, wormholes dont have local and content there is great.
---
Where? Where???
---
&gt;  normally CCP announces a change in advance via patch notes 
---
I can't really remember them ever mentioning AI behavior changes in patch notes. As especially when talking about new AI.
---
&gt;  If CCP's intention is to hurt megacoalitions ...  all they will do is hurt the smaller groups first ...
---
Well i haven't seen any small groups complaining about this so far. Like what is the chance that your 10 man group with 1-2 astra will be attacked in middle of desert? basically really small.
---
You built a fucking empire. Defend it
---
They know what to do. Thing is lots of people would be pretty but hurt if they just mass removed shitadels.
---
Because fighting oversized coalitions as daily content makes for a great game. Who needs balance in an mmo?
---
Such as? I dont own a cap, Im not even skilled into one. Theres legit nothing I can do without gettin insta-gibbed the instant one of these assholes looks in my general direction.
---
High quality Korean shitpost. Give us more. Upvote.
---
But before you do, can you hand over your stuff?
---
and D Scan..
---
You are quick. It was up for like 5 minutes, then I reposted it because I chose a bad title for the post.
---
Praise be!
---
Hes saying that local is providing too much safety and that mechanics like this will nee dot be systematically changed to introduced danger and fear into EVE again.
---
&gt;brave
---
&gt;im not a nullbear
---
whatever you say, and you're allowed to use big boy words like "frick" here you know
---
Your insinuation that I was crying was the first insult here.  
---
I am the one who sees how it works.....  
---
I do not want to forced into shooting NPCs.  And with no reward for doing so it quickly becomes a stupid clicking task that does nothing but waste time.  How is this fair in anyway?
---
Watch this be unirionically downvoted in afew hours
---
Even if the drifters only turned up every 3 months or so for a couple of weeks it would be great for the game imo.
---
Dont forget to remove asset safety from null and low
---
the only wild ride hiseccers get is on their fur coated bad dragon
---
She had no boobies. I like boobies.
---
Maybe dont have 100000000 structures causing your daily grind?
---
\*puts on tinfoil hat\* I think they forgot to buy burger buns.... that and the fact they grossly underestimated the amount of hot dogs Mittens (our new bff) could fit in his throat at once.  #realreasonwecancledbbq
---
I'm not sold on that one, and I've lived in WH.
---
Whats snuff doing in the 'irrelevant' pile?
---
certainly one of the worst but let's not forget every other word out of sort dragon, "remove suicide ganks" and the odd "add wormhole local" that could very well be someone with serious mental illness and not just a troll
---
Yes, because in the small ones all the personal is busy gunning at drifters!
---
I will cede that the lack of communication from CCP is a big issue. If they had spent the last 10 years making positive changes and building up good will with the community it would be a different story, we may be willing to take a leap of faith with regard to this new storyline...
---
I've been reading the community forums -- apparently we null pilots are the problem and we are getting what we deserve / signed mainly high sec pilots.
---
Does an MJD help?
---
You want the riches of 0.0 you put up with the pain pubbie!
---
Awful lot of crying there - just saying!
---
Yes, I'm mad about it all right. So mad, and afraid null is coming for me.
---
Except I've been unsubbed for a while and when I was subbed I lived in null.
---
So... I think the only madboi is you.
---
You don't have to take that content if you don't enjoy it. You're not going to lose your shit
---
ALL HAIL THE ROBOT!
---
To be fair the amount of attacks is probably way too important for it to be logically defended by anyone. I'm all to fuck NS but I would rather have it nerfed so that it actually provide players with way to fuck with NS.
---
No. You’re dead before the spool ends
---
Don't worry friend, others got it for you.
---
Every thumbs down ccp gets over this event is just a running tally of every time they hit their intended target. Keep your balls ccp.
---
Reset null. 
---
If defending your space is fatiguing then you need to hold less space, or delegate out to other smaller groups.
---
#Keep up the great work CCP!
---
I quite agree it's frustrating from players lose ships against godlike rats. If it happens while roaming, camping, or chilling in space. I did, I learnt. I feel the godlikeness of rats just is frustrating (instalock, crazy speed, great range, instakill).
---
Structures...meh...for me they shouldn't even have a timer. Why you need so many? Why is null populated by these endless unkillable-except-by-a-goonandpuppets-blob structures?
---
Man them, defend them. Finally something about logistics that forces alliances to not just own 1000 titans and win the game by showing up only on timers.
---
How about frell?
---
Its about time you join Doomheim isnt it?
---
Suggestion is that it would speed up training. Dont want to grind, you train at same speed you get now.
---
You are active? Then heres a bonus to training speed. The only issue i see is that bots also benefit from this faster sp gain speed? How can that be countered?
---
Have you considered using dscan?
---
So they've hit ~75 structures but why do you have 75+++ structures, especially when the bulk of these are astrahus, presumably just anchored as gate perches.
---
Small groups aren't being attacked. This is manual targeting, which is utter bullshit.
---
&gt;Some men just want to watch the world burn.
---
yeah, that only really works when you can trap people in the burning building.
---
nothing's stopping me going and playing games that are more fun.
---
Enlightened leader Sort Dragon has added all coalition members to the notification channels so we can appreciate our FCs more.
---
I wish I was kidding.
---
True, that Rage Keepstar must spook them off.
---
go to a shell
---
I would have thought legacy co would praise the drifter invasions. As a possible in-game solution to citadel spam for the sake of citadel spam.
---
Is it not TEST / Legacy who so **vehemently** complained  about Simple Farmers using the mechanic to litter their systems with structures, *because they could?*
---
Simple farmers, a small group of dedicated thorns in the side of Legacy's side, should be the ones suffering to the drifter incursion.
---
Legacy Co, of which TEST has over 17k members alone, should have enough bodies round the clock able to just hop into a structure, surely TEST with all it's manpower, resources and timezone coverage can muster enough trustable gunners to simply not be too bothered by this threat?
---
Where are the complaints of smaller groups with large-sprawling and indecent structure networks?
---
Has large-coalition life bread a new kind of eve player? evolved a thin, crispy exterior that looks shiny, but in reality, a soft squishy interior, mushy to the touch whenever poked.
---
Has TEST become liken to a cheap, 3am Chinese takeaway spring-roll?
---
I second this. Brave is definitely not a scam.
---
Radical changes in all for. But I don't want rats to do the work players should be doing.
---
It would be the same with just taking logs away which on the other hand would cause much less impact on legitimate gameplay (imo).
---
No good a link?!
---
Hey I wonder how many "This is fine and a good thing"-comments are gonna be in this thread. 
---
            
---
Let me explain something to all of you that actually don't have to worry about this and just sit in their coalition or High/Low: This is not content this is not good this will change nothing this will only make people quit. 
---
        
---
The first Problem:
---
These rats are not making things "dangerous" they make it unlivable. Need to make money? Too bad here are some insta-100km-point rats that take apart any subcap in seconds. Want to roam? Well to bad they camp gates. Want to mine well I think you know how this is going at this point.
---
                
---
The second Problem:
---
                    
---
Do you know how many people have to deal with these rats attacking structures? Not even 1% of the people in any given alliance. Depending on the size it's 1 to maybe 30-40 people that do all the work. Running around constantly. I personaly am up for 16h now not doing ANYTHING but shooting drifters with citadells. And I am sure there are a lot of people that are doing the same. Great engaging content. 
---
             
---
The third Problem:
---
It is not gonna change anything. Goons are gonna stay goons with the same space and nearly the same amount of structures. Same goes for TEST, INIT. you name it. And due to the drifters actually following up on the timers they do create being up to chance the Drifters do not even clean up all too many low power/abandond structures.
---
           
---
I have never seen so little people do anything in EVE as I have during the last 24h. There is noone out you could hunt there is noone roaming around nothing. People are docked up and wait for it to be over. 
---
         
---
Do not get me wrong CCP doing something against Megaempires and Citadell-spam is a good thing but this is not the way to go and quite frankly is just rediculous.
---
Whatever troll.....
---
Because doomheim is the corp you go to when you trash your character... Ive heard your stupid but fuck... I thought that was pretty clear
---
yes, yes and yes
---
how has htp and rc been affected with their stuff in provi?
---
I miss them! They are gone though so I need to make some new Bros
---
Why should I?
---
This is largely due to the obscene amount of structures owned. Realistically, if you only owned a few systems and citadels in each, it'd be easy to keep all of them under your group's watch. When it's 50-100 systems..well, that's on yourself.
---
&gt;I'll happily reset new passwords and new 2fa codes
---
yeah, good luck with that. I had the pleasure of being locked out of my google account for a month myself after moving to a new location. The system fucked up and wouldn't send a new 2fa code to my email. Other methods, or ways to fix it, or support: none. If you have a 2fa lost from a company like google, their literal recommendation is to make a new account. Very helpful to access all your things tied to such an account.
---
As for guessing passwords, That's a moot point since password managers require a master password to unlock the (encrypted) file containing all the passwords. I don't know if 2fa codes are stored in an encrypted manner on phones though; very likely it is not or it's easily decrypted using other data on the phone and no user input.
---
so true.
---
I lose isk if CCP dumps my stuff in asset safety.  How would highsec people feel about having stuff randomly moved into asset safety?

---
Normies for short
---
In a sense, yeah. There's always been some forms of PVE content, but they have always been terrible on their own and their function was primarily to support the PVP content in one way or another (by providing targets for "pirate" playstyles or incentives for players to spend time in lowsec, nullsec or wormholes).
---
The current CCP regime seems to have lost sight of that, and are pushing PVE down everyone's throats. EVE PVE content has always had a reputation for being terrible. It seems that the development focus right now is fixing that, which would be fine, if the theme was making *better* PVE, or PVE which serves a function of improving the distribution of targets for PVP. But instead they are making PVE content which is just more difficult or harder to ignore. This seems like the wrong focus to me.
---
lol a week in frat and your already acting like a bot
---
&gt;If CCP had put it any effort into automated detection over the last decade  
---
They have, but do yo think people who write botting software don't work at least as much if not more on how to avoid automated detection? It always has been a cat and mouse game.
---
I’m in frat? Are you fucking retarded?
---
I appreciate you continuing to prove my point.  
---
But here's a more elegant, easier solution: Minimize local.  You'll never see the guy again.  Tell me why that isn't better than revamping the game.
---
We already have the Triglavian’s here. So, wouldn’t be too much of a change.
---
&gt;we don't give two mcs**ts about "revenge".
---
and this is why there's close to no meaningful content these days.
---
like, if mittens and half of goons didn't have a hate boner for NC from like 2004 do you really think half of the wars in the last like 4 years or more would've taken place?

---
Naah, old.  But, I'm also an idiot, so that might account for the confusion.
---
I'm guessing someone in the alliance said that maybe The drifters are a good thing.
---
look at the upside, some will survive and will be a limited run with differing levels of taste. The smokey flavor will be intense!
---
Oh shit I just realized all those free gate pings might soon be gone. Get 'em while they're hot I guess.
---
So far, *not too much,* personally I'm looking forward to measuring Provi-response to the threat, and experimenting with ways in which I could aide the Drifter efforts! *time allowing*, looking forward to the weekend in that regard.
---
That's a lot of words to forget that there are ships already in the game that exist with incredible alpha and have been used for over a decade.
---
I suppose their nonexistant ratters and like 4 citadels are pretty safe from this whole thing
---
Forced PVE.
---
mmmmm so new so excited content )))
---
As for Delve, fleets runs as always, comms full of pretty normal autism as usual. Domestic Goons life 
---
Can't see shit, cap
---
Yes but you can't have 10 directors with gunning rights if you only have a few systems
---
are you still in Skill... Oh wait...
---
.
---
i think
---
I was going to ask where NC. and PL were, but then I got my memory back.
---
Did they kill a structure? No. So fuck them and their stupid 'event'
---
what he means is that hoover should just jump ship to frat, what has pl done this past year apart from being a punching bag for mittanis 30,000 inch long dick?
---
Were they the French boys that lived there 2015/2016?
---
Mmmmk
---
Maybe your idea of the amount of space you need to own for that amount of people is just skewed then.
---
More or less ignorant than "All Chinese (that aren't blue to us) are botters"?
---
30.000 inches long and still 2 regions too short :)
---
i funcking love PGL and Dunk faces there, instant upvote
---
I don't know how you expect so many people to live in so little space and not have NS be even more empty than it is already
---
You really think this is going to be permanent? Hardly, its just an event.
---
&gt; Structures...meh...IMO they shouldn't even have a timer. Why you need so many? Why is null populated by these endless unkillable-except-by-a-goonandpuppets-blob structures? Man them, defend them. Finally something about logistics that forces alliances to not just own 1000 titans and win the game by showing up only on timers.
---
Well... Moonmining requires you to put up a structure to mine a moon.
---
and it's an extremely valid point.
---
What you call "pvp" is just another form of grinding.  I would honestly rather shoot rats than sit on a titan for an hour to get blue balled or then end up spending another four hours in tidi anchoring on a screeching FC just to have none of my modules activate or die to a disconnect.  Trust me, the drifters are doing you a favor.
---
Well, they ARE merely being allowed to exist after all.
---
your unlimited nullsec anoms are in question here, dipshit.
---
He swallows dem' tasty BBQ wieners at the same rate he swallows his own narrative.

Store the secrets/recovery codes on paper in a safe. That's what I do.
---
&gt; they grossly underestimated the amount of hot dogs Mittens (our new bff) could fit in his throat at once.
---
He's an easy target, but damn... that was a good one.  :D
---
I haven't played in years but from memory it used to describe who do nothing but krabbing. People want content and do not like having to fly through whole regions where the only content is people too afk to watch intel and dock up when your still a few systems away from them.
---
What I call pvp is not necessarily what you just described. Small to medium style pvp still exists, outside of large wars. Being forced to fend off npcs, just to be able to live in nullsec, is still stupid.
---
&gt;Undo that and you will fix the game.  
---
So roll back to "insert year x"?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c6qmtp/tcu_change_hinted/

Haven't you just changed one BBQ for another ...

I completely forgot that word even existed.
---
We are doing fine, from what I hear. Currently winning EVE and this doesn't make me come back.
---
I want there to be a thriving, violent null and lowsec. I think it is fucking pathetic that CCP have gotten the game into a state where the only way to achieve that is to use super rats.

EVE Rule #1:  Don't put it into space if you can't defend it or don't want to lose it.
---
16 or so years that's been the rule...  Stop your fucking whining, boy.
---
But I thought the current argument was that goons shouldn't be able to fit that many people in a single region. 
---
So which is it don't group up or don't spread out?
---
Please yes, then we’ll have some people complain about being effectively cloaky camped by NPCs.  What a time to be alive
---
Wormholes have other mechanics to make your PVE activities safe, such as critting statics and rolling the rest.
---
Build some citadels and a few caps in the hole and it takes a dedicated invasion, with actual planning, to take it on, not a roaming gang looking for ez ganks.
---
Maybe break up into smaller concentrations of active people instead of 40k megacoalitions filled with f1 warriors, insanity I know.
---
You're saying "even more empty than it is already", but you want people to still own citadels/etc in said empty systems. mmmmmmkay.
---
Maybe give more people gunning rights then? Less burnout but higher risk of drama, which might actually be something positive.
---
Just adapt.
---
Because we got to where we are now by being a pve group. Because we took Delve and made it our home by being a pve group.
---
&gt; If CCP's intention is to hurt megacoalitions, all they will do is hurt the smaller groups first
---
You people keep saying this, and yet... don't actually detail out HOW this will hurt smaller groups first.   
---
Serve up those deets, or STFU about it.
---
whats "legitimate" about it? 
---
Its not like all those structures were illegitimate in some way.
---
This is why I argued against the drifters new behavior, its just pushing more people into ratting with supers and mining with rorqs under an umbrella.
---
Who is saying that? The whole point is that sov and citadels is spammed in empty systems that they're now finding out they can't defend from drifters. If you can't control and defend the space, you shouldn't be able to keep permanent structures there.
---
I'm in PH give it to me instead.
---
Take the drifters out of nullsec, Hal
---
this guy gets it
---
Have we seen any actual correlation between the number of structures and drifters? Not really.
---
PH staging in drones got swamped with 15 drifter fleets and there's what, 6 structures in the system?
---
NPC stations exist.
---
Sweet, i was about to work on something similar for a ESI Project i'm about to do. Awesome timing.
---
No I want them to live in many systems with many structures. Far more than currently. Currently they can live under the same super umbrella with 30k players in a single region. Have that in 4 or 5 regions and then you will have active systems everywhere with far less people in it (or far more if those systems where empty before) and most importantly much more hability to harass / roam.
---
the fire rises
---
They're all a bunch of fucking carebears, sitting under the umbrellas, only flying SRP backed ships.  
---
Null-sec pussies.  Embarrassing. The corpse of Lord Zap I keep in my hold is rolling over continuously.
---
i hope your joking
---
if not, stop being such an incel where you put your internet spaceship guild above a social event lol
---
Never going to happen.
---
They are irrelevant, they live in a low sec station
---
CCP isn't out to ruin the game, they're just out to ruin YOUR game.
---
No just balance citadels and super/capitals
---
Yeah I found this gem:
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6IrOn6\_uKo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6IrOn6_uKo)
---
The real grief with 'krabbing' is not so much the activity of mining, but a certain mentality around it. You can mine without krabbing.
---
What is that mindset? FWIW as an older Eve vet who 'won eve' (stopped playing) a good bit ago, krabbing is a strategy that enables low-risk, uninterrupted mining of a system without any realistic change at impactful interruption. 
---
This in and of itself isn't bad - who doesn't want to protect their economy in a greater strategy? - but it is very, very easy to achieve in EVE's current state, thanks to game mechanics more vocal players have been asking for CCP to rebalance for years. These two things, the ease with which you can grab and it's increasing prevelance over uninterrupted time, has made it the poster child in the minds of many for stagnation in EVE.
---
There's no use in doing so, because they wouldn't have the assets to properly defend their 'home' at that point. And god forbid any big groups take any risks these days.
---
Unanchored everything / dead. Brilliant on their part!
---
Mute
---
Can confirm that the 64-bit client works and gives better performance on linux with the Linux launcher.
---
keep up pal
---
&gt;everything is good in nullsec
---
hmmm
---
So basically people should stop bitching and moaning about krabbing because krabbing is not the issue, the game mechanics are
---
Found stannis
---
You did. You pushed out some c tier alliances that werent able to put up a defense. Then you krabbed up for 3 years, blueing anything in range and avoiding most conflict until your super fleet was big enough so noone could contest it. You used the game mechanics the most efficient way, but this meant mostly doing pve for years.
---
Except none of this is true? You can see gankers in local, yes - much as you can see any number of individuals that are in local at all times and some might be gankers. Better dock up and never leave until local is empty?
---
You can hammer dscan all day, it won't help. Most ganks happen to ships that can't fight back nor fit combat probes. Most ganks also happen in a way that you can't stop it once they engage - bumping a freighter or warping at 0 on a mining ship scanned via an alt.
---
As for repping, a fleet of catalysts requires 6-7+ alts in logi to be present at all times doing nothing except be present in case of agank. Technically possible, but rather unfeasible for pretty much anyone..
---
Go back to your rage quit, you fucking pussy.
---
Well I agree with you, unless you nerf NS economic strength by vastly increasing anomalies respawn CD (or the amount of anomalies per system) along with moon extraction time so that if they want to krab hard they would have to split rorquals and ratters. They would be force to take risk or vastly reduce their industrial strength.
---
this. removing local hurts the hunter. ratters will be safe thanks to automated intel networks
---
Mmmm salmon skin roll
---
This is nice to see.
---
8.5/10
---
Would sub my NS pilots to play this game. If there are enough of the big bloc players left who want more than an asset collection simulator, this could legit save the game. It also drives asset collectors into J-space, which I heartily endorse.
---
Tbf an active tanked T3 actually has way less tank than on paper since by the time you reach the silly 2-3k dps numbers buffer becomes a serious issue...
---
Tl:dr nullsec kid is still so salty that he doesn't realize a warning with a detailed explanation of new dangers isnt a complaint but an informational post and tries to get nullbloc damage control but his CPU cant handle a damage control module so he just looks like a dumbass.
---
heheh yeah, i went to the future, saw you were gonna do that, and made my own module to help! :3
---
Jita would be the exception. It already gets its own server, no need mixing it's chat up with everything else
---
Because wormholes and nullsec have different players with different preferences?
---
you make the mistake of assuming a legacy member would have any reason to "think" about "wars"
---
Stannis the Mannis.
---
Reddit tag confirmed.
---
Ok Michael you got me laughing with this one
---
Hostile forces don't tend to send you a message ahead of time with their battle plans.
---
CCP isn't telling you, because CCP doesn't want to be tied down into only doing certain things that they've pre-announced.
---
Plenty, mostly the guys complaining about being dropped by supers. So what do you want, dead citadels or roaming to be in an even worse place because everyone with be under a super umbrella?
---
No they haven't. You're seriously overestimating the sophistication of those bots.
---
People will actually form to defend their structures (looking at you NC.) if there's a chance they're going to lose all or some portion of their shit.
---
&gt; If you can't manage to have an active defense of your citadels/space, maybe you shouldn't own it.
---
Goons have proven you can get everything you could conceivably want just from one region. And most corps/alliances don't match them in size, needing even less.
---
So okay, Drifters "trim the fat" of nullsec corps/alliances. But what will be the ultimate result? Just a bunch of literally empty nullsec space, not occupied by anyone?
---
The endgame here means separating occupied regions of space by "no man's land" where even small gangs will fear to go not to get murdered by insta-locking death-machines that don't show up on dscan.
---
In my honest opinion, yes. 
---
Krabbing is the result of an exploit within the game, arising from many factors: blue donut, Rorquals, endlessly respawning non-anomaly asteroid belts, local chat mechanics, and super capital application and mobility, to name a few.
---
It tends to attract a certain playstyle and mindset that recalls, for me at least, the attraction of Stardew Valley. There's nothing inherently wrong  with that, even if many  'krabs' might regard interruptions to it as frustrating. The fact that they are able to do so in staggering numbers and with shocking efficiency generates the rage.
---
Meme strats
---
And nobody contested us. Yet, when npcs come to contest our space, everyone comes creeping out their holes to cheer.
---
You are correct that Delve was an easy win, but we have fought, won and lost wars before. All the years that goonswarm existed, we held space in one form or another, by fighting for it. The same can't be said about the cheering crowd.
---
Adapt or die lmaooooo)))))))))))))))))))))))
---
I don't know how hisec players would feel about that as I'm a nullsec player. However, if the drifters destroyed all the citadels in the game then that would be amazing imo. It would dramatically increase the danger of living in null
---
If this is such an issue, why not show your opposition to it by not logging in?
---
(Hostile forces don't tend to send you a message ahead of time with their battle plans.) So your saying CCP am the new hostiles in eve ?
---
As many others have said, null needs a shake up but this isn't it. It is just reinforcing bad behaviours.
---
I wish they would do this. It's honestly the best solution for players to help stop the not problem because it will give some small incentive to hunt them
---
So, old man, what are you up to, today?
---
That doesn't address most of his post. It only addresses them attacking structures. You can only safely rat in caps and the same goes for mining. People complain about the oversaturation of caps and lack of subcaps and this literally forces that to happen.
---
Have they actually been affected in any notable way though? It's been clear so far that the drifters don't show up fully random. 
---
Either way i've seen or heard no complaints from the small alliances or any smaller group. Only the giant coalitions, and now the giant coalitions are starting to claim "the small guys are affected!" to try and protect themselves.
---
Well that’s what Test did. Do you have a solution for the rest of the problems? No sub caps in space because it’s suicide seems like fun and engaging gameplay does t it ...
---
This will probably change again in a few days to a week but do you really prefer a game where everything that isn’t a capital is docked in null sec?
---
CCP have always managed the NPC hostiles in EVE. 
---
Guristas, Sleepers, Drifters, they didn't spontaneously emerge from an AI. They were created by CCP and programmed to behave in a certain way.
---
You're welcome for the reminder 7o.
---
You do know that trying to defend shit when you're massively outnumbered and out-gunned just mean you will loose even more shit right ?
---
as long as they make d-scan automatic, so you don't have to press V every 3 seconds like an ape (sorry wormholers, but that's what it is), that's something to think about
---
Someone should link https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c8mie1/doing_drifters_work/ to CCP, that's what they should be thinking about right now.
---
Finally my idea of the Borgs are taking fruit. I fucking love it burn everything down!!
---
This would horribly fuck lowclass wormholers who rely on 95-99kton BS’s to roll holes.
---
Now I want a fuckin spring role you bastard. Hahahah
---
Quite easy to see a correlation between the number of structures entities own, and the number of their structures that get reinforced.
---
As far as I can tell it's still 30ish seconds but they do NOT display yellow boxes before they haze you.
---
Don't worry RonUSMC said you guys are all having fun over in Test, so enjoy your new drifter content
---
Obviously that’s why it has 8 mids - so you can fit *more* SEBOs onto it :)
---
Additionally, only one single country is celebrating this weekend.  Test is a global Alliance, surely the valued AU and EU TZs can manage.
---
Here it's 1 November to 31 October.
---
Cry us a river.
---
This. 2014 was the best time we had.

Not true. United federation of conifers is getting it pretty bad in pure blind.

You can't lose anything to drifters, if you lose it to Mittani. 400IQ 20d chess move.
---
THE PURGE!!!!!
---
WH Drifters don’t have DD, they just shit out a lot of DPS
---
Drifters are the holy knights of Bob's will.
---
You're trying to say all the structures get reinforced. They don't.
---
Second, we've seen some places get comparatively left alone despite high densities of structures, but other places that don't have it getting swamped.
---
This feels either random or glitched as fuck, and being that CCP is involved, Im going with glitched. 
---
Either way, have fun with an eve where the only ratting ships are supercaps.
---
I second this with concrete-hard hardnessissity. 
---
Exploring in null was lame. Most explorers didn't finish sites and opted to scan everything instead. 
---
Exploring w-space was a blast. Do it in an Astero for extra fun. I've won 1v1 before against cheecky stealth bombers, and you can pounce explorers in T2 scout frigates if you're quick enough. Plus there's more anoms - at least in my experience. Some of my more fun moments have been scouting out a chain back to HS while holding half a billion in can loot in my Astero.
---
It seems you’ve never lived in C5 space or been in C5 forever fights, standard issue there is 2 dreads and a fax...
---
I have lived in null for 90% of my time. And seeing the current state, this is really good, so you can kindly fuck off.
---
4u
---
It's not, but the current CCP team can't see more than 2 inches in front of their face.  I forsee this being as big a fail as pretty much everything CCP has done in the last few years.
---
Dude. Do you even lore?
---
Only fucking idiots think turning PVP into PVE is "interesting".  If I want to play PVE, I'll play one of the many other MMOs who do it way better than EVE.  EVE used to be good for the PVP...this event doesn't bring that back, it actually makes it worse as wars are being put on hold to deal with this stupid PVE shit.
---
Honestly that's all it would really take.
---
* Increase jump drive costs to hit power projection outside your own space. Make em burn more gas, therefore carry more gas. 2 or 3 mids? Make em need a fuel truck.
---
* Fuck this "citadels everywhere" shit. Moons were pos grids because, for whatever fucky lore reason, rats didn't go there. Have predictable, limited places for citadels, everything else gets glassed by drifters / trigs / diamond rats. You wanna keep a dangerzone citadel? Sure, but it's gonna be spacework.
---
* Fix fucking cap/super tackle and damage application. Give tackle fighters a lock time or some shit, NSAs are bad enough, supercaps should not be the best initial tackle in the game. Give more ship types the ability to tank haw dreads. Hit attack fighters.
---
* Remove the entire fucking concept of tethering. Yes it replaces pos bubbles. POS BUBBLES WERE BAD and most of the community hated them, in favour of undock mechanics that made the game more dangerous. The amount of content that was removed by killing undock camping was massive.
---
* Frankly, I'd be in favour of removing citadels entirely and having structures that work like mini Outposts. Or at LEAST make it so citadels can't apply to subcaps.
---
I'm totally fine with ratting incomes finally being made less bot-happy tbh. 
---
Doesn't affect my eve at all.
---
Still went out and got a small gang fight last night while all this was going on. Went out in a 7 man nano gang. Horde brought 100 dudes. Stupidity was had. I am really rusty at kiting and died. Fleet green. See ya next time horde.
---
Yea drifters are attacking small guys too. See kb only 2 cits to die are from small alliances.
---
Working.  Gotta feed my money tank.
---
TBH, who cares about the rationale, a nullsec invasion/blockade of HS, whether successful or not, would probably be the most amusing and interesting thing to happen in Eve in years.  The memes and propaganda alone would make the whole enterprise worthwhile.
---
I don't believe that you have even the foggiest idea at all of what is actually happening in Eve right now.
---
Same. Reminds me, I should get back to it.
---
target rich environment for the drifters then, i guess
---
good luck fighting against an enemy that loses no isk, never tires, never sleeps, never needs SRP
---
I have BOOBIESSSSSSSSSSSS
---
changing the game for the better
---
I actually wonder if this will carve and establish more NPC null. That would be nice.
---
Except sp farmers play by the same rules as you.
---
260+ timers. I sure do love having to baby sit citadels instead of running a PVP fleet on my Friday night. Thanks CCP!
---
They are in Malpais , rebuilding their renters empire into the drone lands.

This topic sure has shown us who all the smoothies are who don't understand how nullsec shit work.

Super powerful NPCs attacking stuff. If shooting rats sounds like "shaking up the nullsec meta" to you then ok. I remain unconvinced.
---
You also don't have to respond to every shield bash.
---
darkness pvp'ing, tell me more
---
Good luck trying to save Eve if you remove its whales ?
---
So... You did and You are calling it an FAX UMBRELLA? You drop dreads and faxes at small gangs? Nope.
---
ban that alliance already lmao . bots and input  broadcasting
---
One can only hope. 
---
On a serious note I am really curious how it will all play out. Not enough data to prove either way, but it feels like there is an AI thought process behind this.
---
Regardless CCP certainly shook things up and it’s exciting times. We will see how it all works out.
---
Oh good job turning to insults when your arguments are too weak to pose any real danger. Youre calling me risk averse whilst being in one of the biggest blobs in the, irony much?
---
This is kind of a ridiculous argument. Those 136-204 people could also be in  a fleet PVPing or prosecuting a war, instead of playing whack-a-mole with Drifters.
---
I've already stopped logging in ever since CCP decided gatecamping instalock, instant-alpha NPCs were a good idea. There's no way for normal subcaps to move about safely. They've interdicted the entirety of nullsec since there's no bloody way to tell where they are other than player based intel and even then that's usually from them dying. You jump in a system and there they are. Your fucking cruiser or whatever can't warp fast enough or burn back to gate before getting blapped. I don't care about them bashing citadels (good idea imo) but this denial of content/movement of them by being on gates is so retarded. I already deal with enough gatecamping autists with less than bot-like reflexes when roaming. I don't need this NPC bullshit doing it too.
---
&gt; Remove NPC bounties completely. Loot can be reprocessed and sold, there's your ratting reward.
---
dae remember how OP drone loot was before ccp nerfed it and gave drone rats bounties
---
I would make a few more changes than that. Give them SOME tools, because frankly without hole mechanics, no local is too strong. Give sov holders and people in NPC space with good standing access to a system scanner structure, which gives them:
---
* Delayed local
---
* Ingame intel map
---
This is not up to the tick, which will create just as much danger for bots (it's not likely to update before that t3d or frigate lands on you). Since it's a lot harder to tackle on a system gate (let alone a constellation or region gate) than on a wormhole, and you can't roll people out, I think something like this is a fair tradeoff.
---
At the same time, make it cost something, so only people who USE the space get it.
---
Also - if it gets the locals clear intel on what's in roaming gangs, they might have a little more nuts to not just helldunk it. If I KNOW 100% it's a fuckin 10 man AF gang I'm not going to ping to drop haw dreads lol, I can just ping for hecates and know I only need like 10 dudes.
---
Of course when every corp in test does that the AF gang is probably still going to get chased by 100 guys lol.
---
I’m interested in this, is his user name sortdragon?
---
Ahh, so you've met the Dora's. [We've had fun with them before.](https://zkillboard.com/related/30000609/201906190000/) Pretty sure they all have open bot reports a couple of times over.

You're saying TEST Requires Triple-Digit FC's for an engagement? Surely you'd have hundreds more of JrFC's and people operating logistics or scanning ext. 
---
My point still stands, with 17k + people in an alliance, you have people to spare on any task you do.
---
1st July was Canada's birthday too, eh.
---
Ideally people take as many space as they need, planting as many structures as they can defend and leave the rest to others.      
---
And i don't mean the friendly power block nearby who rents it out, but truly uninhabited, ready for smaller groups to take. Even small groups can defend a couple of systems *against drifters*. 
---
Now, what it doesn't provide is content drivers for people to go at each others throat at a large scale.    
---
Is there any indicator drifter focus on specific regions? Do they prioritize systems by some metrics maybe?
---
I think you're close to what they have in mind.
---
Glad I re-subbed a month ago, after a 3 yr break.  I got here just in time!
---
"and aligned" being the key phrase there. If you're doing literally anything else, you're toast.
---
&gt; Whats snuff doing 
---
being  irrelevant
---
Enjoy your 4th, brother. :D
---
Shit, forgot: Fuck you, goons! ;)
---
Why is it suddenly on the players to save eve?
---
shortsomething
---
Well to be fair, when you blow up a city in a war it's not like it bursts open like a giant loot piñata.   There are many things about Eve that makes it unrealistic.
---
it certainly affects people's motivation to join the fleets.
---
"yeah, i could go and join a fleet on the wrong side of the map to shoot some i don't care about - or i could save my jump clone timer and crab more".
---
it's definitely a thought I have when we're shooting ncpl yet again since i haven't been playing long enough to have a 10 year old hate boner for them. inevitably i do join the strategic fleet but there's always a bit of my mind that goes "i don't really have a reason to do this" as i carry on watching netflix.
---
CCP please remove local so I can have satisfaction of killing ratters/miners without having to put in any effort and then logoff once satisfied.
---
It's unfair they are able to see me enter local and get safe before I even land. This means they are bots plz fix for me!
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!
---
You can do incursions in highsec, missions, pvp in lowsec for loot, buy plex for isk. The options are many my friend.
---
You don’t need to be in null to make isk if it’s to dangerous for you.
---
No need to be rude man.  
---
Just bringing up a point that most people are not a fan of game mechanics without good counter play.  I am not the first person the day this, and I expect that I will not be the last.
---
Then what would be "it"?
---
I'm seeing this a lot and I'm curious to know what would shake up eve while not being disruptive to the status quo
---
You need only to respond to drifters if they bash your armor timer, though.     
---
If you miscalculate and some player group shows up instead, you have to rage form or make sure you plan for the hull timer.
---
Or just give more people gunning rights. Someone claimed the ability to rip out rigs and modules from the citadel wasn't tied to the access list role of gunning, but the old corp structure management role (?)     
---
I don't know if that's true, though.
---
Not even close.
---
Balancing through a common enema. I like it.
---
Citation needed.
---
Someone make a post about remove all is generating functions and move fully to selling plex for isk
---
&gt; you are supposed to fly out there and risk your stuff
---
Risking what you can afford to lose is Eve.  Few people want to lose their mining and ratting ships every single day, no.  Get real will you.
---
You could not babysit the ones you don't care about.
---
Lord Zap was worse than current null players
---
They abused broken mechanics to kill hundreds of players, and then went crying off when things were changed
---
I like your style !
---
All I was saying is that forced pvE on a a ridiculous scale is just going to kill NS empire and replace it with a grand total of nothing.
---
More like buy 5 of them since u'll lose a couple
---
5 Logi vs a fort is more iffy then you think. 
---
If it's a support fort fit, you lose 4 from perma jams, this means you have 1 left that is eating DPS and neut pressure, meaning you likely lose that grid rather quickly ( now because of the way fort points work your likely to be able to bail in time but really you can't sit there on grid ).
---
most botters are lazy uneducated pigs who grabs shit bots for 10$ or just lurk across internet for free ones\\shitcode simple point-and-click shit
---
It's not like any of the 3 were living in citadels
---
Plenty of groups can pop into those empty spaces.
---
Large groups could fracture.
---
&gt; I don't know if that's true, though.
---
I asked and got confirmed
---
Missed opportunity by not having it end in his mouth :p
---
You'd now have space for other groups to move into.
---
Disclaimer: I have stopped playing for the past 3 months so not sure what the situation is BUT...  
---
Your point is not valid. It's one thing being able to defend everything you own against a real enemy (A HUMAN) and something extremely different to have to defend your stuff against any number of AI controlled bots. The first one is called a "Tower Defense" and while fun, isn't the point of EVE. The second one is what makes EVE null interesting (or boring depending on your perspective) for many people.  
---
I am not saying the Invasion is something bad. I think that it's just another event that just happened to affect more players than previous times. Which is neither bad nor good. It's just an event.   
---
However, saying "If you can't manage to have an active defense, maybe you shouldn't own it" isn't valid when talking about an AI opponent. No one took (and held) the space they have by thinking "well, at some point 20 fleets of 200 bots each might attack these so I shouldn't capture too much".  
---
It's one thing to let players make decisions based on constants X, Y and Z and a completely different thing to let players make decisions based on X, Y, Z and THEN introduce K, L, M and say "Well, you shouldn't have made that choice". That's MEANT to cause all sorts of reactions.
---
Despite what is happening in null (I get the hate towards salt machines), your thought process is invalid here.
---
Agreed.
---
It’s been asked. Regional chat, constellation chat, etc. people are too reliant on local and ccp is too risk adverse to change a fundamental core of the game.
---
Edit: If CCP decided to just change the game so that this is the status now then that is a completely different conversation and direction and that will probably cause EVEN MORE reactions.  
---
Either way it's fun seeing something happening in EVE even if it's so incredibly forced.
---
The problem is that detection is already extremely hard if you do it like CCP and don't act on things that people would see as "suspicious behaviour" (for example being loged in at the same times for 20 hours every day and the likes). The bots don't even need to be complex as long as they use hard to detect ways for input.  
---
(As an easier example lets take an autoclicker thst clicks the same place every second every day for 20 hours. How do you reliably detect that if you completely ignore factors like the always one second timeframe and the position that is always the aswell as for how long its happening)
---
I don't deny the borders they set for themselves (or at least these are what they used to be) aren't pretty hilarious, but claiming they're not doing anything is just not fair.
---
If only
---
&gt; CCP isn't out to ruin the game
---
they sure as shit aren't out to fix anything about it.
---
I wouldn't use someone else's enema...
---
I disagree. If they weren't blueballing eachother so much, they would have to deal with the same situation of citadels being targeted left and right. This enemy is just a bit more numerous, and it'll be a fun challenge to see how people adapt or die.
---
I love this way more than I should.
---
CCP using a sledgehammer to fix nullsec instead of shitty mechanics? This will end well.
---
You act like nobody will move into the empty space.
---
Especially when there will be more timers.
---
Gotta love how r/Eve is drooling over an "event" that's just killing a bunch of ratters, not even posing a tiniest threat to massive citadel empires while others spew BS how it's the next big thing in the game...
---
He didn’t ask about isk/hr, so he’s probably asking for ideas on what he might enjoy. Don’t be so cynical.
---
that Hal 9000 VNI got a chuckle out of me, take my upvote
---
Maybe caps on specific activities? It sounds somewhat like weekly or daily quests at that point but it would both limit bots and encourage people to try new things. You can only get so much % per week from ratting, mining, pvp etc.
---
You act like drifters are out 100% and will be out 100% forever.
---
I'm still out there flying fast warping shit, getting fights and dodging drifters.
---
I have not seen evidence of nano cruisers and lighter getting hazed by Drifters, when the players were in fact paying attention. Until I do I'm not going to be afraid of them.
---
If these roams DO get shit on by drifters I'm deploying to black rise lol
---
Test players are all pretty normal Eve players man
---
"Other groups" just mean more pets for large entities. Small idependant entities can't get space in NS, that's just the way it is.
---
Suicide gank T1 haulers. Camp high sec wormhole entrances near jita. Buy some frigs and go pvp in low sec. Buy a mjd bs and go pvp in Provi. Start your regional trading empire - try to turn 1b into 10b without doing any non-market PVE.
---
This is a post with a lot of words, so I'll leave you an upvote. I remember you roaming eso in your Stratios. I don't think I ever got on one of your killmails.
---
Have you considered a life outside the warm embrace of the swarm? 
---
One where you are allowed to have your own thoughts and find your own content?
---
Much more. 
---
The Chinese being botters is a fairly well known and documented occurrence.   Witnessed firsthand myself thru roams in detorid.
---
Exactly! Knowing CCP this whole event will end at "Stage 2.01" with a "slight increase" in Drifter activity, then just instantly die down...
---
&gt; ~~They~~ *You guys* abused broken mechanics to kill hundreds of players, and then went crying off when things were changed
---
FTFY.
---
Not all of us left crying. I mean, I left, but in 2010... the first time... and I'm still here, crying.  No idea where Zap, j0rt, Tank CEO, Russ, and some of the others went.  I was only a pleb, and spent more time in M3G4 and GANG than I did m0o.
---
Also, it wasn't "broken mechanics"... it was the state of the game at the time.  Like, mounting torps on a rifter to gank Cruisers.
---
You're not wrong, but these have usually been the ones that got caught in the banwaves that happen now and then.
---
Yes so why are you shitting on high sec?  Outside of your code alts that is
---
Disclaimer: I have yet to have to man a citadel or go on a corm fleet to kill these things, so I don’t really know what it’s like to deal with them.
---
That said.
---
If CCP told us “this is how they work this is their thought process”, we’d have them figured out by downtime. The “we don’t really know what’s going on or what their behavior patterns are” adds a bit of chaos the game needs imo.
---
Plus the salt is great.
---
There are botting apps from 15yrs ago and haven't been updated in almost as long, that still work fine.
---
I strongly believe they aren't doing anything as far as client-side detection goes.
---
Not blueballing each other requires a serious time commitment of actual people. It's not easy to constantly force stuff. People get tired after a while. Especially with the commitment required right now to actually win timers / citadels / ihubs. Main reason I quit really. It's just really tiring to do this constantly. Which is a non-issue for bots.  
---
This situation is exactly like creating PLEX sales. You solve a problem for the coming 1-2 months and then it will just return after that. Unless (again) if they decide to make this permanent, in which case there will only be chaos.
---
Some do. Some line the pockets of afk leadershit. If I were to rank the big newbro corps by barriers to entry into eve's "middle class" (able to welp 100-200m ships casually and fly hacs/faction cruisers without srp), I couldn't say a lot good about Horde or Brave. Brand Newbros needs more fight culture. Dreddit's great. I know too little about Karmafleet culture to say more than "they're very good at getting newbros money". 
---
Honestly I would recommend newbros join smaller groups and learn to do more than krab and push f1. Flying your own ship is hard, but it's fun.
---
Correct.  Also much greater rewards once you've done that, assuming you haven't farmed it out.  And no cynos...
---
Winter is coming
---
Tapi not being normal is also well known and documented. Witnessed firsthand myself by having been in the same local as them.
---
Plenty do, it's not that hard to make isk. Huffing local gas and running relic sites will get you the single injector you need to get into a decent C3 drake in no time, or you can just, yknow wait and train it while you make that isk.
---
Excellent Michael Caine quote.
---
Lol that sums it up huh?
---
considering give how long i've been playing, being in goons is a relatively recent thing - i'm going to have to say yes i've endured the other parts of eve and quite frankly having 35k other players to do most of the tedious shit for me is quite nice - and the content is the same, doesn't matter what corp tag i have. pressing f1 is still pressing f1 the game mechanics don't really allow for anything more complicated. there's no manual aiming, and 'manual piloting' in this game isn't particularly manual compared to literally any other game on the market.
---
people effort posting about ded gam XD
---
The attraction in EVE, for many, seems to be that it shares with real-life difficulties and conflicts a certain grit, a sense of surprise and uncertain danger, or the chance for the unsolicited to occur; put another way, you get to have your power fantasy while putting on the big boy pants of real life consequences.
---
Last I heard, when real life decides to come screw you in the butt, it doesn't send you a weekly mailer telling you before hand. 
---
EVE's social-economic structure shows no signs of balkanizing into a less homogeneous, even-temperature lump of blue dough. The only other alternative then to preserve this aspect of the game, is to inject an external, chaotic force, however painful and sickly the effect booster shot is. 
---
This, in some form, was going to happen eventually. That, or the second law of political thermodynamics is going to regulate EVE to the dust bin of history.
---
or literally none of them and just let them repair :p
---
&gt;You can hammer dscan all day, it won't help.
---
tell that to the 4 gank attempts on my ark that were stopped by jumping in, immediately seeing 20+ taloses just barely off grid, and cynoing out before they can try anything
---
Technically, at the time, it was my IGN. But right now you raise a good point - Got any sources?
---
They warp to anoms? As in ratting sites, mining?  
---
If yes, thats hilarious.
---
Easy: bombers?
---
https://youtu.be/CH1Q738UEsQ
---
Its less the working than more the seeing you use them and punish you. I can not say i am familiar with all of the botting softwares out there but i do know that there are several ones that are likely to net you a ban in the next banwave if you use them.  
---
Just to put this out of the way: i fully agree theres not enough being done. But it's also not true that they do nothing.
---
Assuming of course that its not able to keep up. With that many folks exiting the market and demand increasing lot of new folks that previously couldnt compete margin wise will.
---
It would entirely depend on if the market could hit a new equilibrium that was affordable.
---
I think it’s cool but making them so we can’t fight back is a tad over the top. So we just keep buying subs so we can watch this from a station..... seems dumb
---
This is perfect. Well done!
---
No Capitals? What kind of low sec is this?
---
GJ guys!
---
I literally lol'd.
---
Big Invasion
---
That's exactly the problem with nullsec in 2K19, it's too safe and predicable. The only thing left in the game that isn't is WH Bob.
---
I understand that nobody can compete with Goons now.  But with 100% asset safety, you're guaranteeing that never undocking is the preferred method to defend your space in null now.  Why undock when you can just get your shit in LS and move back when the attacker gets bored?
---
The Purge, drifters edition?
---
Wont someone think of the poor dinos :(
---
Apparently, it worked pretty well before CCP brought 24/7 OP attack bots that do not adhere to any limitations into the game. The most funny thing is, if players bot, it's the most evil thing in the game. But when CCP adds bots, people cheer.
---
Oh wow according to this thing SLYCE is still part of GOTG
---
l understand that but l think they could of said in a WAY better way then they have this is whats going to be happening drifters am going to be popping into null as part of the new XP we just put out, not this ghosting of CSM about it.
---
Not fighting is always going to be the most worth it way to defend your space if you're outgunned.
---
I do get that there is a certain convenience having everything organised for you in delve however, there really is a lot more the game can offer besides anchoring on some idiot and pressing F1.
---
threeché
---
Why is frat on there?  I watch those psychos throw waves of ships at the drifters and not blink an eye to defend their stuff.
---
*woosh*
---
All I'm hearing here is;
---
&gt;If \[strawman\], then \[red herring\].
---
And honestly, how the fuck does depression mean you can't consent to PVP? Please, explain that shit to me. Or at least tell my you're an Olympic Athlete with some crazy mental gymnastics?
---
most of it's not anchoring on some one, and still having to push f1.
---
it's not sufficiently different enough for me to want to put in any extra effort, if i'm totally honest with you.
---
underrated comment.
---
Well, from the beginning I felt that the way CCP was using the training queue was to keep you paying for the Omega level... this is not a criticism, is a business decision and I respect it...  However, I know they have ways to monitor all your activities, and now they have the Activity Tracker... I truly believe it will improve the user experience, I also believe it will make attracting new players to well organized groups, who can help them maximize on those experience bonuses...  And, I honestly believe CCP will not see any dent in its financials by giving up a little...  
---
Does anybody know how to present this directly to CCP, maybe one of their GMs??
---
The worst was Tank ceo with the jump in point camping, and ejecting cans to make the loading time longer so they could kill you
---
M0o as a whole was the guys gate camping pipes and tanking the (at the time) pathetic concord and local police
---
Took CCP themselves to run them off that one
---
We snagged a scorpion kill (Magua i think it was) because thye added gate aggro
---
Cant really say Mo0 was any different to current players tbh
---
Am I wrong to think this is terrible for the game but also awesome at the same time?
---
Seems to be happening, bots are getting glassed.
---
*stares in OpenSSL*
---
&gt;Either that or he is a raging sociopath.
---
I think this is pretty much confirmed.
---
Sorry to hear that. Probably worth trying though if you aren’t happy. What’s to lose?
---
Uhuh, large blue donuts too scared to actually fight eachother nail and tooth is definitely a good status quo for the game.
---
I'm all for the carebears and bots to have to live with no local.
---
Legit he seems to be having fun. I got to gun a structure for the first time and shoot some baddies, so that was fun. I imagine thrill will wear off after a week or two.
---
It's just going to make people trim down their space and citadel spam to a size they can actually reliably/comfortably defend.
---
"effort" is not an excuse for just blueballing and building sandcastles while content dies off. Just like how smaller groups had to adapt or die, now it's the big bloc's turns for a bit of the same - getting crushed by an overwhelming force.
---
I hope so. I'm tired of our newbros getting taught to krab and pingwarrior. I'm glad I came back to start making a cultural difference, but CCP doing it with a clenched fist seems good to me. The day we can go out with 30 caracals again is a great day.
---
...then realize nobody fucking likes fighting caracals and reship to vexors lol.
---
Thanks for sharing my meme :p
---
Like I said, holes would have to be rebalanced. Im not a wormholer btw so I cant comment on that
---
these seem to be bots getting killed.
---
i mean like, 99% of the time... my ship :P
---
upvote
---
Faulty assumptions there. 
---
Losing access to an Outpost was never assumed to be permanent. If I had stuff trapped in one, I had the option of joining the new owner's alliance (or slipping in a spy alt). I also could just hold onto my trapped shit forever, which means you'd get nothing from me. 
---
Switching off Asset Safety and having shit drop from the hypothetical Abandoned structures is *truly* losing assets.
---
Aren't you the guy who loses a stratios per hour? How about some words for that?
---
Honestly not even funny.
---
This is stupid. Pay the game. Even if Plex is at like 1 billion, it will STEAL the fun of the game to pay with plex ALL the TIme.
---
My theory is that if you are paying the game with Ingame currency, you are doing it wrong.
---
Indias minimum wage is at $304... that's low but it's still Much better than to pay the game with isk.
---
Even at Low sec gettign that big isk, you will still take MANY MANY hours to gather 4 billion isk. 
---
At $1,9 per hour of REAL WORLD WORK, you will pay the full month in 5.2 hours of that low wage... it would be like 30 or 40 hours of ingame farming isk to make such money. Doesnt make sense...
---
Great post Michael, well worth the effort of reading through.
---
Citadels being so utterly miserable to interact with in an offensive manner has sapped the energy of many in this game. 
---
I could only hope that 1/10th of what's expounded upon here comes anywhere close to be being implemented. It won't, but at least we can say we tried, right.
---
Yeah, that's the only argument you have, I know. I've read it about 1000 times here in the last couple of days from you and your clones.
---
Other than the bit about ruining caps, which will just make local caps oppressive on the level of building haw dreads in a fuckin c1, maybe. I do encourage people to spend more time in lowsec, it's not so bad!
---
How about ‘already replaced’. Heh get rekt nerd.
---
agreed  
---
wormholer btw
---
Shiet, this has so many words, I can't even mock you for it.
---
it will be interesting to see if they show up for the 2nd timers.
---
You get better at not losing them. Then you stop caring because it doesn’t matter.
---
What, you want to deny that the large blue donut is pretty shit for eve's content?
---
And what about other arguments, like how alliances with just shy of 18.000 people can't defend their 100's of citadels spammed all over. Boo hoo, must suck to have 18k people and still not get a free win pass.
---
CCP bot detection now has 100% sensitivity and 2% specificity.
---
Just get rid of all skills.
---
We had regional and constellation chat back in the day.  Nobody used it so it was removed.
---
Drunk pilot is a happy pilot!
---
Who says it can only be one or the other?
---
It's a game about space ships. Some belong to players, some to NPCs. You accept the possibility of encountering either one when you undock.
---
It is called EvE for a reason. Everyone vs everyone =)
---
Good write up.
---
While you're at it:
---
* add 1 rig slot to each battleship (don't change calibration points, or *only* change calibration points and don't add the new slot)
---
   * consider buffing large scan resolution rig to give more incentive to use that rig slot for scan res, because everyone just fits tank or dps rigs 90% of time
---
   * *honestly you could also just fit a sebo or signal amp*
---
* buff battleship DPS, increase battleship signature radius
---
* nerf capital damage application via signature resolution, especially on long-range weapons
---
   * basically, unless you are HAW fit, you should not even hit BCs and below (except some Drakes because of 3x LSE II fit)
---
* consider buff to battleship insurance payout
---
   * battleships are meant to be used and lost, you undock in your BS you should expect to lose it. When you fly your HAC you expect to get out, but you know your BS is committed because it's very easy to tackle and lock down. Make running BS fleets more worth it by buffing insurance a little bit, to the point where the hull costs little more than the price for platinum insurance if you only need a single insurance contract. This makes BS more like "leased cars" and t2 ships more like "your owned car".
---
If BS gets 2.5 AU/s then BC needs to go up to 2.8 or 2.9. I think warp speeds are OK right now but am still a bit disappointed in cruiser speeds (and cynabal only gets 4.5 without rigs and mods, very sad, very sad, I would like to see that go up to 5 or even 6 again and buff smaller stuff to compensate). I also think that travel ceptors should be nerfed somehow, but I don't know how. I think we need to open a new can of worms to address that issue.
---
The revamp to circle the beacon is why the only logic was go ultra big.  As only the defender or correct alliance could defend it.  30+ smaller alliances is doomed vs the doomstack as only 1/30 can participate in the defence.   
---
If they want a vivid nullsec then make sure the corps in the alliance owns the land not a holder Corp.  
---
(Then Corp loyalty is worth something).  And would open up new levels of alliance attack scams.  
---
Then make it so that jumpgates in null defend its owner and even prevent jumping further it ADM is high enough unless you’re n a covop.  (This ensure fights happen on the border and covop get a stronger role to hit stuff behind the line).  
---
Then move over the system owning to the one with most structures in system.  
---
Pushing a button or killing a structure should both be valid methods.  
---
I just wish they didn’t scrap legion as they game would have worked good for capturing structures to. Launch an invasion where the eve players delivers the clones to the attackers while the defenders could do the same pushing the inter game cooperation.  We ferry clones and weapons while the FPS player try to capture the station for us.
---
Maybe.  But if you're also going to lose all your shit, you might at least try to contest it.  You're a wormholer.  You know this.
---
God this is delicious if you remember the pre-Imperium Goonswarm
---
In my old corp, we had this FC that took us on drunk roam too. well, it was mostly him getting drunk and dying on comms :d
---
CCP coded them to not pop ships with a month worth of plex in their cargo to be more friendly to newer players.
---
Do you remember HK trying to defend the hull timers of their hole ?
---
I like these drifters
---
good1, yes it's true, i have pvp'd in eve online
---
Demand will stay about the same, may even drop a bit from nullblocs buying more locally. Most of the components for T2 mods and ships come from nullsec moon ores, which the embargo aims to bottleneck.
---
Yes, the price on end products will most likely increase, but the price on inputs will increase more in highsec, making the margins worse for highsec industrials. And then you have nullsec industrials building the same item with cheaper inputs, who also can sell in highsec at the increased end product pricepoint.
---
You're so much fake news you even get away with the terrible spelling
---
Buy 100 rifters and fly around shooting reds.
---
:d
---
An idea I had, would be to leave logged off players in local.
---
eve is f2p , so re-create bots costs almost nothing. banwaves are rare and p2p bots pay for themselves (due to skill extraction) and very cost-effective. 
---
botting in eve is literally win\\win
---
local should be removed. The code isn't good enough to be removed as the codebase is still functional. If one cares about performance optimization it is possible to remove a large number of codebase modules in one place from the codebase and make sure that every module is updated in parallel, by writing the code in parallel. However it isn't easy to accomplish this.
---
The solution for us is to split our code into two files, one that is for each of the different versions of Angular: "App" and "Component". This can easily be achieved with:
---
npm run build

This will run the build process in the browser and rebuild our app in the browser on every boot of the code based of the version we use. The build process will only be started at boot, so if the server is down or you have a bunch of code that's breaking, it should take quite a while for the build and all the intermediate files are updated to the correct versions that are needed to run the app properly.
---
We use Grunt in the build because it can do all the building and minification for us and the command line tools can easily be setup, and are useful for testing and debugging.
---
The final piece is to run npm run release to check if this build, as the name implies, is successful and if the build fails.
---
What about a Wolf or a Jaguar.
---
So people complained for months about the proliferation of citadels, so CCP created this amazing mechanic to prune them.
---
Now, all the bot-using, easy mode scum losers who make up the giant null blocks are crying like the pathetic, spoiled, unskilled little bitches they are, screaming into the void about how CCP is just annoying them and this isn't a big deal blah blah blah
---
I am HERE for it.  I can't explain how happy I am to see so many gate-camping, super spamming losers in here constantly producing salt.  It's invigorating.  It's arousing.
---
I hope it never stops.  I hope NULL becomes unfun for the thousands of complete scum Lord's that have checked out and lived in safety under a super umbrella.
---
Thank you, CCP.  I have never seen more effective, needed trolling.  My heart is full
---
Goes to show that CCP has literally no fucking clue how to fix this game, and apparently half of the players are dumb enough to think this is good content.
---
Dr Pavel, I'm CIA.
---
This guy for CSM. Or CEO of CCP. Or something. CCP give this guy money instead of people running your game into the ground.
---
OP is what's wrong with Eve nowadays. All this fucking kumbaya lovey they neighbour faggot bullshit. Where I come from, you hate your enemies with a burning passion and you do everything you can to ruin their time.
---
Seriously OP, go fuck yourself and shove your faggot salute emote up your ass.
---
Until you can purpose changes that help both the little guy and the mega alliance, eve will keep dying. 
---
There are some sparks of that here, but it's washed over by the desire for your fun to be prioritized over others.
---
Hi, nullhotrox!
---
I love people and am here to wish you the best day! Take care!
---
-HappyFriendlyBot
---
hahahaha... yeah, jetcan lag.   I'm guilty of doing that, WITH Tank.  Shit, he probably taught me.  He's the whole reason I ended up running with those guys.
---
Fond memories of rolling with Tank.  Dude was legit, taught me how to PvP.  IIRC, He joined GANG a few weeks after release, and then a few of us rolled alts to go fly with him and the others a little while after that.  Zap was kind of a dick, iirc.
---
Over the past few years, we've all heard various alliance level leaders and FCs talk about providing "content" for their folk so they don't get board.
---
In general, I may agree with this however, I think the fundamental flaw is this "provided content" has almost no meaning, no purpose. It's a roam for the sake of a roam, a gatecamp for the sake of a gatecamp, a bash for the sake of a bash etc ... 
---
These "content creators" pat themselves on the back for their efforts of just doing "something" and thinking they are enhancing everyone's Eve experience.  However, these provided events have no meaning to the average line member as there is nothing visceral to be gained or lost.  Any losses are SRP'd, no historic enemy aggression stopped, no territory conquered and no new land settled.
---
As long as the status quo of the individual massive empires is never really threatened, there is no compelling gameplay. It appears to mostly be ego stroking.
---
TLDR; self professed "content creators" are full of crap.
---
How come they didnt detect bots that run 23/7 for months (I have personally seen these)? What about the pods that keeps warping back and forth?
---
At some point there would be a bit of cat and mouse, but you would at least raise the barrier to entry or make it difficult to bot for prolonged periods of time. The alternative of having no automated detection is just bad.
---
This is disgusting. They login, activate hack and warp to the site before they even materialize. Litteraly. There is just no time to do anything else. Like how is this supposed to be fair. Meanwhile Falcon is parading around saying that we should calm down and that everything is fine.
---
Well ccp has ignored for years now the calls to take mining away from rorqs so must be what they want. It's a bullshit ship and panic is cancer. But play with what makes you rich....
---
Come down to GE-8JV we live just down the road from you and would love to PVP whenever you want. 
---
best ships: whatever you like to fly. 
---
I personally love the Kronos but that's probably unwieldy to roam to us with (what with the slow aligns)
---
Bring a nice nano cruiser or T3D. They're fast. Nice dps. good fun. 
---
However If you really want to be an elite pvper then fit up a burstjam instawarp interceptor and fly to all the big battles, never attack ANYONE (only bads use actual weapons). Warp in. Burst jam. Warp out. Let everyone kill eachother. Green killboard for days. /sarcasm
---
the problem is, because it doesn't matter - i stop trying.
---
Yes we have 17k people..
---
Of course the 1% of the amarr empire supports the drifter cause.
---
Rifter as said above. Go lose a 100 and then start branching out. Recommend FW Lowsec Novices as a play to start.

can't say i disagree.

sure, there's content. but it's not exactly meaningful or interesting. i'm on a fleet right now... not even sure what we're doing. i've stopped paying attention. once i start seeing some red on my overview i'll minimise chrome and start paying attention again. until then, i'mma shit post on here and watch more netflix.
---
pretty sure an FC called me retarded earlier for being in a bubble. i wasn't in it because i was stupid, i was in it because i wasn't engaged in the content at all.
---
Not with these drifters they can't. When you live next to someone hostile who has capital superiority over you, you can't undock anything with a jump drive.
---
These drifters shred any subcap.
---
So, sure, small entities can move into those empty spaces... as long as they don't undock anything with or without a jump drive.
---
Aww look nullhotrox made a friend! Good bot.
---
Players  can replace all of the citadels killed so far in about an hour of krabbing.  All this shit does is disrupt actual activity, like, I dunno, PVP?  If this is the best CCP's got to fix the problems, they may as well all quit their jobs in shame because this is fucking pathetic.
---
Your question is the reason that those who actually live in null are rather pissed off by this.
---
&gt;(As an easier example lets take an autoclicker thst clicks the same place every second every day for 20 hours. How do you reliably detect that if you completely ignore factors like the always one second timeframe and the position that is always the same aswell as for how long its happening)
---
Why would you ignore how long it is happening?
---
Broadly, everything that goes to the server is potentially usable to establish "consistency over time".
---
that's 30 jumps away from me :(
---
It's almost like the tank of the ships is somehow relevant.....
---
&gt;what would shake up eve while not being disruptive to the status quo
---
The point is that we need something that is disruptive to the status quo.
---
Yes.
---
They should actually follow up on timers though, at least for low power citadels. It should be randomized though so they do it, but not always, to make it harder for players to exploit their attacks.
---
I think titling the expansion "invasion" was their heads up
---
Whose fun would be affected here? I don't think anyone enjoys the current level of structure grind, tz tank, or stagnancy. These changes would have benefited (for example) the Imperium campaign in the north just as much as my own playstyle. Almost all of these changes are about reducing grind and increasing interaction. That's a positive for everyone, from sov null to npc null to lowsec, from bloc content to smallgang. Even the umbrella changes, albeit a nerf to pve, will be a buff to everyone's pvp.
---
Aww. Understandable if you don't wanna travel that far. Im sure we'll come visit Provi anyway :D
---
That's a funny way to spell
---
**Rework mining**
---
Mining vessels no longer simply fire lasers, you instead deploy all ships into a hub for mining drones to operate out of. 
---
Mining lasers now decrease the cycle time of drones while active on the rock. 
---
Mining command ships now fit guns with large bonus' to optimal/falloff and tracking, and gain those bonus' while deployed, acting as mobile defensive hub structures for other ships to drop off ore.
---
Furthermore, the command bursts increase the power of the mining lasers, so everything works as before. Just need to rework the mining amounts of drones and said bonus'
---
Needing to deploy your ship and command your drones provides are more active experience for miners and would go a long way towards deterring botting. This could include a reward in the way of better mining for all ships, but it should ideally come with other additions such as an ORE dread miner, capital strip miners and ye fabled mining titan.
---
That's fair I suppose. I lost my Gila after doing an abyssal in HS just because someone randomly decided to fuck that guy doing an abyssal. My own fault for not dsanning when I came out but still. Wasn't expecting it.
---
Sure just give me a fit for my Rifter
---
Yes, but it is not always applicable.
---
Retarded
---
Bans for this happen in waves. These banwaves are way too rare as you might have noticed. Detection and acting are two separate things and CCP doesn't act the moment theres something detected.
---
What is this new drifter invasion thing? Is it somehow affecting the status quo where everything is just blue donut?
---
"hey guys look at me i posted some mouthbreather shit and a bot recognised me for it"
---
have you considered moving to dreddit
---
Cool idea...  a war between Drifters and Trigs will be something to see...  I wonder how long will it take to find a way with the drifters...  I have seed fleets kicking the arse out of the trigs in HS... but to be honest, you waltz with your VNI and blast 30 frigs 10 destroyers, 20 guns and get the loot... so for those NPCs you are a nightmare, in the context of the game... a single ship comes and blast everybody to hell...  now the drifters are doing the same with the big boys, they waltz in, crack the pot and leave...  they dont show in dscan, maybe they can be found using combat probing... in any case, if is to remove botting, or to punish botting groups... great!!  let it be part of EVE... somehow, someone will find a tactic that screws the drifters, as they are now fleets farming Trigs... watch:  [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/448035898](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/448035898) 
---
This is cool content... no griefing anybody... and is not easy to break the Trigs... Someone will come up with a tactic or fleet or way to break the Drifters... :D
---
I visit r/eve to see memes, not read a research paper on a dying game.
---
Sorry, keep forgetting TEST is one of the smaller groups in the game.
---
Awww are you jealous of my shitposting?
---
Same principle, but far more expensive to use as disposable training ships.
---
&gt;Why would you ignore how long it is happening? 
---
Don't ask me, ask CCP.
---
start by getting out of provi and doing literally anything else including feeding throwaway t1 frigs in fw until you figure out how they work
---
any "just buy x times x ship" guy is just desperate for content vet. 
---
First of all - start with destroyers ,not frigates  (assault frigates are fine if you are rich) . And legit space for frig\\destro pvp is fw low sec zone. You don't have to pick a side, can just fly around and pew pew anyone you want. Picking a side - you are losing content.
---
Google for low-sec fits, which you can afford to lose and just go for the fw plexes.
---
When you are ready for cruiser-size and bigger ,- i don't know anymore where you can get a fight. Maybe you will be lucky with some weird time-zone idk
---
Still could get a fights untill your kb is red tho
---
The scenario you described is very similar to my experiences in this game pre-citadel, around 2015, especially flying down south and fighting on PFR's undock (4-CM8I) and fucking with their station services. It was a super fun time, low stakes small gang PvP and we'd fuck off when eventually Ninja Uitoh would log in and organize a 50 man cerb fleet.
---
Not being able to warp away so quickly across the board would cause more fights, making everything one sided in the hunters favor will not equal the result you are looking for, as there will be even less people in space. 
---
Also you're a fool if you think bots can't just use d-scan if they wanted to.
---
Why they happen in waves is just a choice. A lot of stuff could be banned automatically.
---
About ten times the cost. If you start out you want many tries and take many fights. Not try to maximise your win/lose ratio. (Well of course you want to win but you want to try as many fights as possible to have many fights.)
---
&gt; I don't need this NPC bullshit doing it too.
---
Fucking game IP and story getting in the way of you playing the game.  WTF were they thinking, trying to breathe more life into EVE?  You should totally rage quit.
---
I like just about all of your ideas! Really great read :) However, if you greatly buff the cyno inhib, then the anchor time needs to be increased and those massive buffs should not work until it is online.
---
What is fw and idk if you consider 2.5bil rich
---
They don't have cynos or permanent unclosable connections either.
---
Although both of those could be fixed...
---
and now a public service announcement for all of legacy
---
jealous
---
adjective
---
feeling or showing an envious resentment of someone or their achievements, possessions, or perceived advantages.
---
"she was always jealous of me"

---
Okay, but you wouldnt ignore that. Consistency over time is a big deal.
---
In Vino Veritas
---
You really don't need to tell me that. As i told the other guy i fully agree theres not enough being done. It's just not that theres nothing being done.
---
Delete small citadels.
---
Nerf ratting bounties by 50%. Compensate by buffing the ESS.
---
Bring back real jump fatigue.  You can't exhaust a null bloc's capitals in under half an hour.  Goon and NCPL supers shouldn't be able to show up to a fight between TEST and Fraternity within two hours.
---
Rebalance sig radius and tracking between caps and subcaps.  Delete HAW guns and up the MWD cooldown time on fighters to 3-5 minutes.
---
Yeah
---
After i went a bit rogue i setup a jump in camp with one of those broke 0.2 second lock torp tachyon scorpions
---
Went to -9.9 in  a hour or so
---
Eve was a far more fun place when the sandbox was like it was
---
i always preferred a smaller ship, and smaller things but eve moved towards caps rapidly
---
And caps invite 2k+ man blobs, which means tidi, and i hate tidi
---
Except the drifters aren't restricted to the big blocs.
---
D-scan
---
It wasn't OP.  It just undercut the mined-mineral market.
---
Brave member doesn't understand what all the fuss is about. Seems logical since their space wasn't hit in first wave of attacks (don't know if being hit this week)
---
That's a pretty sweet emoji you've created there, is it okay if I use it in some of my future posts?
---
    [  ] YES
---
    [  ] NO
---
You are correct, *I* wouldn't. Maybe CCP stepped back from it too, i'm not saying any of this is necessarily up to date, just how it was at some point. But seeing how rampant the issue is i have no reason to believe there was an improvement.
---
&gt; running a PVP fleet
---
&gt;rejects of the galaxy coalition
---
lmao sure
---
Yes son, you can
---
it's doxxness a rait loss means they can't srp anyone for a month
---
So basically no real change to nullsec.
---
Oh we got all the fun yesterday. It was glorious. (not really)
---
Region chat replacing local is a bit too large imo, but I wouldn't be against constellation chat for nullsec
---
&gt; What is fw 
---
faction wars, please just search reddit about it 
---
&gt; 2.5bi 
---
stick to destroyers than, won't hurt you. that's important
---
Yip, literally keep poking it and eventully you start accidentally gaining space
---
Insta-blap NPCs randomly spawn.  They don't appear in local or on dscan, and scram you immediately when they land on grid.  So, no counter-play if you're in anything smaller than a capital because you don't have the EHP to do anything.  They also pod you.
---
Considering the "Nullsec meta" has been described as "Capitals Online", this isn't shaking anything up.  It's driving the game in the direction everyone is complaining about: MUST FLY SUPER.
---
I have never, ever enjoyed bathing in someone's tears as I'm enjoying it right now because of the people bitching about this event.
---
Not the Invasion we expected, but the Invasion we deserved
---
It's a choice based on the semi official reason to make it harder for people to find out when exactly they screwed up. 
---
But yes at this point that propably isn't the best practice anymore (not saying it ever was but it's even less now)
---
All I see here is a bunch of nobody cares
---
it's fucking legacy, i don't understand how people are still surprised when it turns out 99% of the shit they whine about is something they do too
---
&gt;If local doesn't exist, bots would all be vulnerable to roaming gangs
---
Because someone running a fleet of bots would have a very hard time adding one more bot to watch a gate. :eyeroll:
---
A regional chat would not only hurt the bots but also legit ratters/miners who then couldn't warp off when someone enters the system .. a bettet soltution ln my eyes is, that local becomes a structure which the holding alliance would have to ancre and defend
---
&gt; Eve was a far more fun place when the sandbox was like it was
---
Yeah... I'm starting to see little glimmers of that sandbox, lately.  Getting excited.
---
The last month of EVE has been the most fun for me since pre 2012, I think.  Having a blast, despite currently being 3/16 on the boards since my return, and having lost a couple B in ships re-learning how to play.
---
Also lost an Astra, because I forgot to go pick it up after the timer ran out, because I was busy getting my ass kicked in PvP.  lol fuckin' noob.
---
2.5b is a decent amount. People recommend 100x of cheap ship so you can get used to everything that comes with pvp and not go poor. Things you'll be figuring out while whelping ships. Pvp shakes, thinking through your piloting and moving with a purpose, different engagement ranges of various hulls, how to pickup on the trap, and many more.
---
Until you can start doing those things you don't really gain an advantage becaue you are in something blingy. Get an idea of the mechanics and you'll be farther ahead than half the player base.
---
No obvious effect on the donut, but it's only been a week, so it's more realistically 'no obvious effect on the donut _yet_'.
---
Oh absolutely. Once I saw the title I was hoping for something to completely flip the game on its head. IMO, it hasn't gone far enough yet.  Hopefully something like the OP comes to fruition.
---
Oh hey, michael talking sense again. Fuck yeah!
---
Sure kiddo
---
Why should *less secure space* result in *shorter vulnerability* windows?
---
“Goons can get kicked out of their sov a million times before they start to feel a pinch of concern.”
---
This is where you lose all credibility. If Goons got kicked out of Delve just -one- more time, the mountain of salt would reach higher than Everest.
---
Looks like I picked a bad week to quit spod...
---
You forgot to say Sorry, but I feel ya.
---
I burned my bridge, RMt'd it all and decided no more
---
Did all eve had to offer since 2003, quote happy with it :P
---
What is the likelihood of roaming defence fleets eventually becoming the status quo to fight the Drifters (and roaming gangs that come by)?
---
Because someone who runs a fleet of automated bots would find it totally impossible to run one more bot to watch a gate.
---
Yeah even Rorqual alts prefer to be stalked by Olmeca *Gold ammo* than drifter npc that drops crap loot.
---
hey i included the me and the boys thing
---
VNI as far as the eye can see. Love it CCP, I love it!
---
I didnt mean "you". If they dont look at consistency over time, they lose the strongest indicator. There is no reason not to look at it.
---
Google "eve is easy kestrel" and see Suitonia's video.
---
Tristan is very versatile and can teach you kiting, drone management, neut mechanics and brawling. But what race do you have trained?
---
Damn dude. Which null alliance hurt you?
---
is there a special keyword I have to say to get you guys to undock?
---
do I just link this reddit post?
---
I was referring to concord, and it was a joke. Chill out dude.
---
Besides ships from SOCT, what special edition ships are useful?
---
I read the first two lines in your voice and stopped. tl;dr?
---
I was searching for hints of irony or sarkasm in his post. I couldn't find them...
---
Peeps should always undock. I try to. Unless it's a fleet of 50 dudes. I assume you come during USTZ, so those guys do the same? I hope they do.
---
Tldr: We have very little info about the drifters invasion, although the intensity of it seems to be ramping up.
---
It seems like the intent of it is to
---
1: Soften up structures in large quantities so that players can finish them off.
---
2: Target bitters and kill them off.
---
Bish please. Can't ruin my game when I don't undock
---
What do the drifters do? Attack Sov:s like human players do resetting them?
---
You could always join one of the groups actually operating in Provi. There's lots of PVP to be had down here and most groups down here are pretty good about helping newbies gets started.
---
Like this one, for example:

---
They fought back until a bad warp in cost them a chunk of their fleet.  But they did fight back.
---
&gt; if you're at your keyboard and aligned you will be fine.
---
bullshit, they can't be seen on scan, they can scram you the second they land on grid, the only way to avoid getting tackled is to sit at the keyboard staring at the overview with your mouse button on the warp button. Sure hope you don't need to change your target or move to a new rock when they land on grid.
---
Not *no reason* but admittedly no smart one. But then again CCP doesn't have the best track record of smart decisions.
---
EVE is gaming herpes.  I want to stop playing it, or even stop following it when I'm not playing it... but I can't.
---
And you can;t constantly align and do anything because aligning moves you out of range.
---
yeah they'd actually have to spend 5 whole minutes looking at all the logs they cliam they have that never seem to show anything meaningful when a report is filed.
---
I read the stories, I live vicariously
---
Because EVE does make you a evil megalomaniac in a game which is epic and fun
---
But then you realise its 4 am and all youve really done is sit spinning ships 
---
I just decided that im the wrong side of 30, got a motorbike and spend my time riding and fixing it instead
---
Yeah so when they had equals numbers they fought and then when they couldn't have a chance they self-destructed what they could and evacted the rest.
---
No "glorious last stand against all odds".
---
Will they never learn?
---
Just give it where concord has authority, but regional chat is better than local regardless, it could Unite more players.
---
Maybe the solution is simpler than you might think.
---
Pull down all those damn citadels that are just blobbing space. I know you have more anchored than you really need :)
---
And be surrounded by bots? No thanks.
---
While true, I think the smaller ones have greater bonds so the can go "hibernate" so to speak, but the bigger corps will lose numbers and crumble
---
Isnt that the Goon motto?
---
&gt; because the current price of moon goo is mostly a symptom of not a lot of people wanting to actively mine moons 
---
There is actually a lot of people who want to mine those moons, but the people who live in that space only see them as Athanor and mining ship killmails (or try to get people to rent the moons)
---
&gt; *More, stronger tackle in anoms - e.g. infinite point ‘hic’ towers etc.* 
---
This would affect all anom ratting, not just the bots
---
&gt; *Give Black ops battleships a small SMB similar to the Nestor. Maybe a covops cloak.* 
---
No, you do not get mini carriers with a covops cloak. Also if you think blackops are not worth using, you should a look at what groups like Ivana/VOC are doing in the minmatar area
---
If all bots would be banned we could actually have PvP.
---
There's empty space now that no one is moving into
---
Nope.
---
They got addict of having slaves collecting ISK for them.
---
Basically what I've been advocating for a while now. Return the game to 2014 capitals with jump fatigue and bring back POS sov.
---
~sigh~
---
It's a pleasure to read some post like this.
---
Great effort and understanding of mechanics.
---
Personally I'm against everything that forces math mechanics in game, e.g. structure timers, Rorqual panic modes, damage caps, blops nerf.
---
Anomalies in 00 are way too many and that's what attracts perma bots / afkers.
---
Caps umbrella + panic is what un-allows proper ganks.
---
Structures long timers is what allows bigger blobs to maintain control over longer distances.
---
A nice back-to-basics would be more enjoyable. You deploy a structure? Be ready to defend it 24h or risk to lose it.
---
You deploy caps? Be ready to lose them to a well placed cyno inhib that prevents other caps to join and creates a fight-cap to sub caps. (I'm thinking, hics with cyno inhib incorporated? Wow. Maybe BS size).
---
Make titans and supers increasingly costly. Sucking SPs like T3 once killed...there are so many ways to nerf current stasis.
---
People just ask for subcaps drunk roams and fewVSfew and ganks.
---
Not math and logistics and more ways to bot/afk/perma-umbrella.
---
Cheers mate. You got the point.
---
Do you have "undefended structure that I can bash with overwhelming advantage" PvP, or just regular "It could make my killboard red" PvP ? Asking for a friend.

Hey, great ideas.  Iterating on a concept.  what a crazy idea.  If only someone had done that like ... 10 years ago or something.  Rather than doing things once, realizing it isn't working, and then writing a brand new way to do it, from scratch, because the code is a mess.
---
Be ready to defend it 24/7 then. Faster tractoring + no timer
---
&gt; the only way to avoid getting tackled is to sit at the keyboard staring at the overview with your mouse button on the warp button

Right so it's not bullshit, it just requires effort and 1.5 braincells.

(Insert guy tapping forehead meme ot some shit)
---
Isn't there already constellation and/or regional chat, just nobody uses it?
---
i think i'm kinda alone with this but instead throwing away 100 frigates you could go with cruisers first, the stabber and caracal for example can make decent solo nano platforms. As advantage you survive a bit more, which gives you more time to figure out what exactly is going wrong. T1 Frigs tend to just insta pop sometimes, which is really not helpful for new players imho.
---
Thank you for this quality post. We'd have been lost without your unique insight into the matter.
---
heaven forbid people discuss a game on a discussion forum.
---
&gt;How come they didnt detect bots that run 23/7 for months (I have personally seen these)? 
---
Aren't the VNI changes and drifters solving the botting problem? But r/eve told me so!
---
Long live perma docked market 0.01 bots?
---
Sounds simple but doing something like that very likely involves a complete overhaul of the skins system
---
I'm not opposed to the goings-on themselves, but having these break just about all the rules about attacking space to make it happen are frustrating. I get that the game's limitations keep these fleets from properly moving around a region, so that's why we end up with them just spawning in place; but on top of that they're completely impossible to scout on the way in or anything else?  
---
The rules for dealing with drifter spam are completely different than dealing with any kind of harassing players; all the way from the recon of the attack to the force required as a response. That's where I start losing the thread of it(and judging by the last couple days on here, it's the same for several others).  
---
A dedicated group harassing cits has to stage, form up, travel to the target(and be both visible and engageable) and bash the target, where they're more vulnerable to a response fleet than the citadel itself, as long as they bring some logi.  
---
By comparison, HI THE DRIFTERS ARE ON GRID with no formup, staging system, presence on D-scan or the probe scanner, and are capable of hazing any reasonable subcap response aside from lolmorants, apparently; while they choke and die on a citadel's much-maligned defensive abilities against subcapitals.
---
It's frustrating that these fleets provide the following: A ping in a structure tracking channel, "hey somebody get a gunner to that Astrahus," and one person solo wiping a fleet ad infinitum.
---
Are there skill builds/recommendations posted online anywhere?
---
Did you just unironically said it?
---
I never said it was ideal it’s just always been that way since I’ve been playing for better or worse, 
---
 even in the much praises good olde days it was expected that the solid pvp players had a cloaked falcon alt ready at all times just in case shit was going south 
---
Just look at skill u in the beginning with only a few guys   With many alts,
---
they managed to accomplish a lot of remarkable things  
---
Alts are expected in eve
---
if you don’t have a scout try and fly with friends more often or stuff you don’t care about loosing,
---
and since your in a big bull bloc you could have made an vni(insert whatever ship post changes) alt and dual box anoms, and that account will pay for itself with very little effort, then when your not krabbing you have yourself a scouting alt ready
---
I do know where your coming from I took a brake from 2014 to 2016 I came back with one account told myself no more multi boxing yet here I am back with 3 accounts active
---
Funny,  my client logs to don't show this conversation ever happening but it's a good troll I guess.
---
Well I heard from someone that they killed the drifters and then they fucked off for a little bit, but he wasn't sure if that was entirely true.
---
“Doesn’t affect my eve at all.”
---
A TLDR of the drifters to most of r/eve
---
[*HTFU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgvM7av1o1Q)
---
lol, how would this make them mini carriers? You have 1/5th to 1/3 of the dps, out to a fraction of the range, with worse tracking and shit tank, for unironically more money. The SMB would just be for refits, like the nestor, you wouldn't actually be able to put anything in it.
---
I used to think blops with covops cloak would be bad, but honestly I've talk about it with people and in the current and foreseeable meta it really wouldn't be an issue. They're still battleships that eat shit to carriers, and given the cost and sp, their bonuses really aren't that strong.
---
Also, I don't think one group using blops in one part of lowsec is proof they're not dead.
---
&gt; Pi is the most brain numbing thing in the game.
---
For you, maybe... being an F1 monkey is pretty damn boring, to me.
---
We're at the next level of meta:  people bitching about people bitching.
---
Ah, Reddit.   The gift that keeps on giving.
---
PS:   STFU
---
missing the aviator helmet :)
---
Which is a nerf.  We used to start with duct tape AND bailing wire.
---
Yeah these are nothing to a rorqual who can get help to kill the things. Basically CCP moving them to anomaly’s has made it so people have to be in rorquals, supers or titans to eat or mining safely
---
Resistance is futile.  Your life as it has been, is over.  From this time forward, you will service us.
---
You don’t need corms, just 4 supers can wipe them out easily with no losses
---
Downvotes on reddit, if it's lame.
---
&gt;I'm going to be moving everything to another account because I've changed my primary email since I made the original Eve account.
---
Why not just change the email? Also people wont actually know your char name resembles your real name unless you tell them it does.
---
Anyhow; 
---
1: Create new char
---
2: Transfer isk to new char
---
3: Contract all skill injectors to new char
---
4: Done
---
When your posting is so bad that reddit tells you to stop.
---
So we already have a handle on this and the drifters are nothing more than a task to take care of. We have enough spare supers to save people who can cyno and enough gunners for buildings. Keep dreaming
---
Yeah, it actually makes me sad thinking about how stuff like that just isn't possible any more. It was a hoot.
---
Maybe, but ccp has now gone in harder, who's to say they won't keep going until you guys are gone
---
Best explanation what it is is probably in following video [https://youtu.be/ry-CTceghqE](https://youtu.be/ry-CTceghqE)
---
It's pretty sure that more changes will come so we players can mostly guess.
---
Currently the status quo doesnt seem very affected. Reddit is raging and memeing but r/eve does that about pretty much anything. It's a certain kind of gameplay :'D
---
This is a direct quote from mittens a few years back at some fanfest presentation or the likes. (unsure of exact source)
---
Nobody actually wants to see the game ruined or become unfun. This meme plays on the hypocrisy of mittens telling people he's there to ruin THEIR game and then bitching about how HIS game is ruined and throwing a tantrum at the same time.
---
Overall I think most players are laughing at the insane reactions and meme-ing it to hell, but still concerned about the total outcome and watching to see what happens, hoping it's something good.
---
I am indeed a meme thief. I will now go directly to jail, not pass go, and not collect my €200.
---
It was as this point capsuleers realized that you can't make isk if your vexor navy dies constantly to drifters and therefore can never get to a super or titan, to all goons the galaxy is yours my children run free and kill them all... your supertit fleet is second to none and it's the only thing that can kill the drifters....
---
Yes. Problem?
---
2.2m sp..... Lol
---
😁
---
I'm not suggesting removing asset safety will cause everyone to fight to the last man.  But it will generate more fights than we currently have.
---
Just carry on with your character who cares, I’ve got a good friend who started in 04 I think when he was creating his toon he put his intended toon and real name the Wrong way round, is character is his name now and his account name is something retarded
---
Also i don’t hide my identity from my eve mates there real friends to me  don’t lose sleep over it it will be a lot of hassle and isk over a name 👍
---
&gt; Micro-warp + Cloak trick
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Cloak_trick
---
Yes. The marshal is very good for example. All AT ships (alliance tournament) ships are good but extremely expensive as they are very rare.
---
Yeah fuck falcon frankly.  They fucked up the brisc rubal stuff royally.  What else that my hung over brain can’t recall atm?  Whoever’s in charge of the community team there needs to remember who pays the fucking bills and pass his posts thru a fucking editor once in a while.
---
Top marks dude, so good
---
eh,  Frak this, for my faith is a shield proof against your blandishments
---
Very, very low.
---
Tech 1 frigates and faction frigates are good for learning in FW space. Hookbill can brawl/kite, slicer is a kiter, firetail and Comet are both brawly first but can kite using some off meta setups.
---
Roaming around nullsec in an assault frig or low/null in a t1 cruiser is also a solid option. I wouldn't go any bigger than a cruiser as you're getting started since the warp speed will make it more boring than is necessary. My suggestions are the Thorax, Vexor, Omen, Caracal and Rupture for general stuff. The Stabber is basically a big destroyer and excels at killing small stuff if that's your jam.
---
Since you're in providence you aren't too outrageously far from people who want to fight. if all else fails try out Pandemic Horde space.
---
2m skillpoints is nothing, if you really want to change characters do it  
---
just do what  [JoshuaFoiritain](https://www.reddit.com/user/JoshuaFoiritain/) told you, you can leave this alt to be used for PI or scanning or something else later on, alts ae usefull  
---
you can park it in jita, nobody is gonna siphon through all those names in station, so name is irrelevant, and you will need a jita alt if you ever move to low sec, null sec or wh space
---
Are you referring to that JinTaan interview with the CSM candidate who said he wouldn't care if CCP sold premium ammo? That wasn't Olmeca, it was some fuckwit who didn't make it into the CSM whose name I can't remember.
---
What would be a reason?
---
No, bee space is fine and we have handled the problem in like 2 hours. Everything is business as usual
---
More aggression maybe, more fights I doubt it, you will just make large fish hunt the small ones.
---
Pussies... I upvote...
---
He says whilst being in goons
---
Yes it still is. :)
---
and in the end I'm sorry to tell you but you don't get some special award over the "cheering crowd" for it. I get that you want validation for the years of rhetoric from nullsec that being sov holders is the final goal and highest achievement in Eve, but it ain't. It's just another (equally valid) way of playing.
---
I'm largely surprised that bot doesn't just move entirety of r/eve to that subreddit
---
And don’t forget the big one no docking for supers and titans!!! Back to the  space coffins
---
More like, we have supers en mass and just protect people who get jumped by drifters
---
After the 5th jump across constellations one end to the other just to lock up 5 rats and pop em.  
---
This is literally WoW quests.  Go here:  kill 5 boats:   Come back.  Get new quest.  Go there this time.  Kill 8 bears.  Come back.  Over and over.  And for what?  No loot?  No SPs?  No BPCs?   Just defending.   And not participating in the PvP fleets that are scheduled and probably won’t be able to fill cause people are burned out.
---
&gt;Goon hate
---
it took you this long to realise the IMPERIUM news network was a goon thing?
---
You really have no clue what you’re talking about. All the structures are doing workflows.
---
i say it as some one who has been playing the game for many years
---
history repeats,  in ccp's case so often i'm surprised they aren't dizzy.
---
But this change means nothing to anyone with a super umbrella. Supers titans and rorquals handle them just fine
---
This. Honestly 2.2m sp isn't worth much - that's about a month of training with a remap + rookie booster. Just make a new account and buy the starter bundle that has 1m sp and 30 days of omega, then use your skill injectors, and bam you have a brand new character that probably even has more sp.
---
Just make sure you're putting that SP into the golden skills first. (CPU/Powergrid management, weapons upgrades, advanced weapons upgrades, navigation stuff etc.)
---
Isn't that the current meta?  At least this way you generate some more fights (aggression = fights), encourage the player removal of citadel spam (I used to make bank killing dead POSes), and make space more dangerous.  
---
Otherwise give me asset safety in J space.  Replacing ship losses is annoying.
---
You just lost content from your WH roams.  This guy quitting is less targets.  Less fun for you too.
---
Ah fair enough, I wasn't aware of the context tbh. 
---
&gt;Overall I think most players are laughing at the insane reactions and meme-ing it to hell, but still concerned about the total outcome and watching to see what happens, hoping it's something good.
---
I think you're right. Personally I like the idea of dangerous invaders/roaming fleets but I think the current state (can't scan them down, combined with their insane range, scram speed, DPS, and trash drops) is slightly worrying.
---
Is this worth reading. Probably not. Next meme pls.
---
“Amazing” lol.  I stopped there.
---
I haven't asked for any rewards or validation from anyone. Especially not from people with your posting quality.
---
great job
---
Who'd have thought that CCP could create something more autistic than actual eve players. GJ CCP
---
Step one invite yourself as a friend to create a new account. CCP is cool withthat so use same mailing adress and so on. You do that so you have 750k unallocated SP on the new account. Then create new account and char. Make the names different so you're less likely to be hacked.
---
Log into the old character and contract everything to your new character. You can find all your assets with ctrl + T. Send all your isk over too. Now log into the new character and accept the contracts. If your old character's assets are scattered over several stations and your contracting skill is low you might to switch back and forth between accounts for a bit. (Assuming the old one is alpha if its omega you can log into both at the same time)
---
mittani is literally trump aka hitler
---
&gt; aggression = fights
---
That's not how it works no.
---
&gt; encourage the player removal of citadel spam
---
low power empty astrahu / raitaru aren't going to have much stuff in them
---
&gt; and make space more dangerous
---
For small entities
---
Office billing, how does it work?
---
My corp had an office in a station where the rent was increasing and the office wasn't needed anymore so last month when I saw that the bill would tap out the corp wallet, I unrented the office.
---
Now I'm getting warning messages that I don't have enough isk in the wallet to cover the bill.
---
If you close an office after receiving a bill, do you still have to pay the bill? The whole thing, even if the office only existed for a few days after the previous one?
---
Everyone is thinking this. Thanks for putting it down in a well thought out manner!
---
stop spreading fake news with tinfoil theories
---
A "moral" decision to not judge on behaviour patterns but solely trying to detect programatic interference with the game.
---
(And yes i am aware how stupid that sounds)
---
No, with poses being removed that doesn't work anymore, if they get rid of tethering. The original mooring concept was far better than tethering, having an on/off timer.
---
The only thing space coffin mechanics really change is "jump out of your super, burn inty to other super staging, jump into other super" to reduce jump fatigue costs in exchange for time and logistics costs. TBH this is a pretty limited scope issue compared to the others rather than the big one.
---
A balanced post! :o Am I on the right subreddit?
---
I've swung over to Black Rise a couple times again lately, it's getting a lot more active again. Yay for killin shit!
---
I would like novice plexes to turn the cheese level down to like, 3 from OVER NINE THOUSAND but hey, there's always assault frigs.
---
Boomer meme
---
Well, I guess it is a "reason".
---
I think this will rebalance the game beautifully...  The huge alliances may break (or unite in misery), and Null Sec will be NULL SEC for everybody...  A high risk area where all is at a stake any time...   I wonder if LOW SEC is next... with randomized Drifter invasions...  It will be great to do Faction WF in combined fleets vs Drifters...
---
&gt;but we have fought, won and lost wars before. All the years that goonswarm existed, we held space in one form or another, by fighting for it
---
Saying this as though it means something is seeking validation. You're expecting people to defer to your playstyle because "fighting for \[sov\]" is something you apparently think has some kind of intrinsic value, when it doesn't.
---
Or the drifters suddenly drop caps themselves.
---
Send a buddy referral invite from current account to your email. Use that invite to open a new account. This way you get 750,000 bonus sp. 
---
So you will have almost 1 mil sp from start. To get to your existing 2.2 mil sp you just need 3 weeks of training. So basically no point being worried about losing the skillpoints
---
8.5/10 
---
I'm not entirely sure if it will be exactly as you stated, but i guess that is what CCP ultimately has in mind for the game. As Hilmar said, before keeping the game stagnant any longer, burning parts of it down in order to save it is by far the best option. 0.0 needs a shake up, CCP knows this and this is their answer. Since the start of the invasion expansion, every week something changed. Sub-phases progressed and even the main phase (triglavians --&gt; drifters).
---
As the story progresses we will get options to fight back, but imo they will require a compromise. Either we will really get a soft-cap of structures we can have per system, constellation, region, ect. before the drifters attack, or periodically they will come and take everything down that cannot be saved, which should result in the same.
---
tl;dr you could bring jackdaw fleets on grid with a keepstar, imagine the possibilities
---
Cool, what's your answer then?  
---
Re: low power astra/rait not having much stuff - the 10B+ I made bashing dead sticks disagrees with you.
---
hahaha... you speak the truth, my friend.
---
I'm a little further down the line... I started playing EVE around your age, in 2003.  I used to play with my kids sleeping on my lap, after they'd wake up in the middle of the night.  My kid-named Alts are about the only old accounts I still use. :D
---
But, you aren't wrong.  I played for about 2 hours last night.  I think I spent that entire time in Hek, playing around with the fitting simulator, trying to see if I can find a Solo PvP use for my half dozen Typhoons. :D  Didn't enter space once.
---
Superb post. I think you have some great ideas.
---
I miss when you guys lived in Fountain and we lived in Cloud Ring.
---
&gt;any "just buy x times x ship" guy is just desperate for content vet. 
---
it's not really, you can only learn to avoid mistakes by making them first.
---
It's also a good idea to record your fights, you will see a lot of mistakes you made that you missed during fight.
---
Great content, yea. I'm shooting from citadel this shit in 4 a.m., instead of having to sleep.
---
If ccp want stir up null, this in not good idea. Remove TCU to reduce node grind and simplification sov wars for example. Boost BS, because it don't used now (HACs own all)
---
So who is Sir Mittens?  The Mittani?  Is he talking to himself?
---
Well this is a dumb post.
---
Doubt anyone has a problem with you making an effort to look stupid.
---
It's a game, can you not make it political. What a joke.
---
3/10
---
Where's lowsec
---
Naturally.
---
Dscan is a thing. Having a scout watching a gate is also a thing.
---
salted caramel donuts?
---
you are wrong on this. You can now do crazy shit in null when you for example use drifters to your advantage. Like drifters trigger a cyno and from a big eninity 50% jumps to it to hep him. meanwhile you can tackle someone else and kill him insted. Maybe even seperate fleets and can match even numbers in Caps. I think Dreadbombs will get way more usefull :) 
---
and this is healthy for the game.
---
&gt; CCP have gotten the game 
---
As if the players have had zero inpiut in the direction EVE has taken.  Fuckouttahere with that shit.
---
Fuck you and your blinkered political opinions.
---
- Remove a timer accross the board for medium structures (yes it means low power is one go one kill)
---
- Remove cap damage and turn it into degressive damage after reaching the cap
---
- Give the ability to reinforce the active modules like defanging towers
---
- Nerf supers and caps application to subcaps even more and ewar fighter speed
---
- Double+ anomalies respawn time and moon extraction time so that NS empire are force to spread and divide space so that each region is weaker and doesn't stand under one huge super umbrella so that you can easily harass them
---
hm, i need to watch that video. i am glad he gate a  footnote mentioning that he couldnt say anyhting about Caldari.
---
and yeah, generally mega corps are bad.  though caldari are an exception as they meld multiple mega corps together with national pride, identity, and a sense of unity.    they can still be heartless and cold.  but its a more stable stucture than most real governments as people want to help their individual corps
---
Remember that era when the default EVE settings were good?
---
Me neither.
---
Yes
---
No
---
Very little
---
&gt; At this point they seem to just be a minor nuisance, rather than accomplishing anything. I'm looking forward to seeing what CCP's end-game is here. If this is all this is, I'll be very disappointed. 
---
Considering it's been radio silence from CCP beyond "Things are working as intended so HTFU." I'm curious also. Recent events have put a temporary hold on my normal activities, but this is IMHO a good shake up to null as a whole.
---
....so republicans own everything?  might want to look at silicon valley and the censorship going on......

I'll take a dozen, please, with an extra side of Goon tears.
---
Before the Rorqual had a reinforcement timer all they ever did was sit and compress ore inside a pos shield. Now we got dead Rorquals out the ass.
---
Do note that CCP actually never said something like that and this is pure extrapolation. So far all we can see is that drifters spawn in system and reinforce structures and kill ratters.
---
battleships and cruisers.
---
don't think so

This on the Mittens front.
---
As for the event itself, it is shaking things up. This is a good thing.
---
provi in OP's and your comment is actually irrelevant, unless you insert politics. there's fights everywhere against everyone
---
I sadly only have one upvote to give.
---
yes you get ambushed but this means and iam serious there you have to play active with your eyes and scanner open. Otherwise you will get hotdropped and killed. This is fair since i dont know another game except Anno where you can play 17h semi afk and watch netflix to fill up your wallet. 
---
This is even super for the infaltionlevel of this game since ISK will get harder to create. Things prices will go up and so on. 
---
I can understand that there maybe need some restrictions like give em 5 secs locktime till you are getting pointed so you have a chance getting away while activly playing.
---
But for the rest i like it.
---
Let me guess, 17,000 isk worth of loot in the can?

---
So uh ... remove some of the citadels?
---
Congrats! It is such a rare find.
---
Great effort to be honest. But nothing you’re proposing is new. I’m fairly sure every time csm meets ccp a variation of this easy to implement list is on the table. Granted yours is probably better than most but still doesn’t take a genius to see what should be tweaked. Somehow ccp prefers not to act on it. For a while people thought that they were scared of pissing off null blocs and losing the juicy dollars that come from the capital and resource creep tied to shitty gameplay mechanics. But the drifter spam clearly shows that they actually don’t give a shit about anything. Which is overall quite puzzling.
---
It's quote from Darius JOHNSON during the '09 alliance panel, but don't let that take anything away from the so called hypocrisy.
---
some, like the zephyr are extremely specific but useful the day you need it.
---
Yeah like Shalmon is implying, the vuln timers should be less secure - more window because incentives to actually fight. It's hard enough for people to start sieging a system because of the current mechanics, even this slight change wouldn't affect much unfortunately
---
Grr driff...hat driff...
---
I went through the Elite phase as well. Now back to EVE. Probably something to do with trying out long distance exploration in Elite and now I'm just stuck in the ass end of nowhere. Can't seem to motivate myself to login and get back to the bubble.
---
Yea it was shit, but still. Easy effort lol.
---
Love it.
---
Shh don't doubt his narrative
---
Fuck, I hope so.
---
This happens every time they add new entities to the game. You just have to go and turn them on.
---
OTL: I haven't play in a while... but this pic of "the drifter" is coming up quite a lot... What the fuck is it?
---
Laughs in wormholer btw
---
I didn't know that I could simply change my email! This might be best. how do I go about contract transferring everything? Is it as simple as right clicking the item?
---
Happy Cake Day! Cunt.
---
Ah, I did you're right, Sorry about that.
---
Dropping retards in lowsec with blops is usually risk free and pure gank. Most of the time targets cant even fight back. Counterdrops or baits happen almost never. I did it with the respective group in Amarr LS and there is no thrill to it. Could just use bombers instead and it would have the same effect but with more time to kill target. Also the KM doesnt look as good with bombers on it.
---
Using blops in NS is basicly dead. DED hunting basicly dead. DED runners can just warp to one of the 20 citas in system and be safe. Dropping on a rare Rattlesnake you may find..sure if you find one.
---
Dropping on caps eg pve carriers...not cost efficient. A single Blops is more expensive than a standard carrier (insurance not included) and you need more than one to actually kill it.
---
So ye overall Blops have no roll in the game other swag factor and bridges.
---
Blops with covops cloaks would be SPOOPY.
---
I like it.
---
Might as well be for that carrier-like price tag
---
&gt; Saying this as though it means something is seeking validation.     
---
No it doesn't. Spare me that armchair psychology.
---
I can only hope you are correct.
---
As I see it, this certainly seems directly aimed at citadel spam. This new game play seems aimed at combating structure spam / AFK rating / roq spam. 
---
I wonder if another goal is not give people a stronger reason to say in Low Sec and only venture into Null Sec if they are much stronger.  In addition, if you are in Null Sec its much more heavily fortified city surrounded by wilderness as opposed to sprawling empire.
---
I would be very interested in your opinion on why this is good for null sec. As I see it, this fiasco from CCP takes away from null sec as a whole because one of the major blocks was pulled from an actual PvP (sort of, as NC/PL just decided to roll over and take it instead of fighting) engagement to deal with a PvE engagement. Please, tell us how that is in any way good for the game
---
You know you've fucked up when I'm agreeing with a Goon.
---
to live in it's a fucking shite region unless you're just a hisec miner who got lost lmfao
---
That viceroy thing is a dated meme
---
Nice try, CCP Marketing.
---
That's fair to point. I guess to a lot of people a goon is a goon and you're all interchangeable. So it can still be funny even if it's inaccurate.
---
Personally I have no stake in this event, nor feelings one way or another on gooons/mittens for that matter. I've always lived the wormholer life. However, I can see how it would be frustrating to be meme'd non stop about an event nobody knows the mechanics or outcome of.

This is Trump Derangement Syndrome on steroids.
---
Mittens is the best, everytime he opens his mouth he makes huge swathes of space angry at us, which then becomes the next war. He's a 9-d content generator. Except that one time he generated a little too much content and we got evicted. But you know what? You gotta take the bad with the good.

shite is relative my man. one man's shite is another's regular nullsec you can carrier rat in

Oh you're in for a treat https://m.soundcloud.com/gsen/grath-and-madcat-vs-incursion-rats
---
Drifters are NPCs in the game that have been around for a while. They are super powerful and a pain to fight a lot. They don't show up often in k-space other than in some incursions and some Amarr story stuff a while back.
---
Pictures like this are getting posted a lot because CCP recently decided to just drop Drifters all over null without any explanation or comment on the matter and people are freaking the hell out.
---
The memes are amusing, even if we don't know if this is good for the game or not.
---
Shhhhh, never mind that TEST was the only alliance to follow us to Delve to try and prevent it.
---
just because you're happy to settle for one of the worst player owned regions in the game doesn't mean it's good, back to eve-o forums with you
---
it is good, your region sucks. hey using that argument is super easy, and i don't even need intelligence. thanks!
---
EVE is about blowing shit up in space, and throwing shade.  I don't know what the fuck game you're playing, but the local of space doesn't mean shit to all that, and you don't need to be in Null to do it.
---
Noob.
---
It is clear who is salty here. 
---
You giant null blocs that live in the areas of the EVE universe, which are supposed to be higher risk/higher reward, have mitigated that risk using massive amounts of numbers and super umbrellas. You farm to your delight while the vast majority of you are the least skilled pilots in the game.  
---
The problem is that there is too much isk circulating in the game. It appears CCP is trying to manage the isk supply. Yet the position that the leadership of these giant blocs is taking is to starve out the little guy in an attempt to discourage them and at the same time pressure CCP to give you back your ball so you can take it and go home at your leisure. Forgive the rest of us if we do not shed a tear at you trials and tribulations.
---
You say you want rewards for killing them? That would seem to be the opposite of the point of the increased drifter activity. The isk faucet has been wide open for too long and I applaud any attempt made by CCP to hurt those who have taken advantage of a (broken) system and have become complacent.
---
Yeah, there goes that silly humor of mine
---
How high should I aim to make those skills?
---
Hell I'll bite... You know severely depressed people commit suicide? Do perfectly sane people do that? Well, here's your answer...
---
No, outside of the confirmations that the drifter event is working as intended i do not have any such statements.
---
However we can deduce the goal of the system based the activity of the drifters and the level of aggressiveness of said NPCs.
---
To date, i have never heard of an RP event that introduce a NPC  that was this disruptive to pretty much everyone in nullsec.
---
I mean i'm not saying that i'm 100% confident that the goals of the system is to clear structures and kill ratters, but their targets and the level of their activity do suggest that it is their goal.
---
If everyone in nullsec went alpha for the month this shit would be over before the next downtime.
---
But drifters are probably only temporary. It’s been a week.
---
&gt; even medium gangs will fear to go
---
that wont just be in "no mans land". its not like travelling any settled region will be any better.
---
this post gave me cancer.
---
I just dont believe any of this, and to your edit, High seccers are disjointed and not banded together, that's just not how high sec operates.  You may see some fights but they wont be any real contention, You will have uncontested structure bashing.
---
Null and lowsec should be dangerous due to other players, not because of NPCs.
---
np i understand that anything requiring intelligence is asking a little much from someone who has access to the wide array of information the internet offers but is completely oblivious to just how pointless provi is, enjoy being some irrelevant carebear in a shit region lmao
---
If I were you professor I’d give ya an B+. A MS paint AAR of your scenario would have been nice ty Michael
---
Maybe not sperg against you and rally against ccp against the changes but instead currently it wil lbe the opposite.  Null sec also has a great ability to reach the masses as has been proven multiple times in the past even though high seccers are disjointed.
---
Epiphany - I don't have to give CCP my money.
---
gottem
---
It wont be about the isk honestly at this point.  The annoyance which I still think is going to be minimal is just going to make them move to CCPs side even more.  So congratz you played yourself.
---
First I don't like the term "forseeable meta". Unless you have a reliable way to tell the future, you are just guessing and CCP is a bit unpredictable these days (triglavians, drifters).  
---
The reason I called them mini carriers is that they would be jump capable and able to refit without a depot (maybe mini capital would have been the better word). There is a reason CCP decided that you should not be able to refit your bombers, recons and t3s at any point without deploying a depot. If you want to do that, use ships with less jump range and more fatigue.  
---
About the cloak: the ability to warp without appearing on dscan (and since you have the role bonus to immediately target after the decloak/bump) is limited for a reason as well.
---
EVE is a resource gathering real time strategy game. It even has hordes of NPCs.
---
Happy Cake Day cactusjack48! Stay positive and happy. Work hard and don't give up hope. Be open to criticism and keep learning. Surround yourself with happy, warm and genuine people.
---
It's not.
---
Yes. Especially new player oriented groups have those. Specisalised skill plans also exist for example incursion communities give those out. As those plans are usually specific to the group it's not thaaat helpful to randomly link them. If you're in another group or a solo player other skills might take priority.
---
[https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Skill#Recommended\_Skills](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Skill#Recommended_Skills) might help you to orientate yourself. Also search for evemon which is a very useful tool if you want to crate long term skill plans.
---
That's literally only the jump freighter because of its jump drive. If that's your example for how to avoid getting ganked in highsec, i would like you to display it by carrying 10b in a cargo expanded freighter through niarja in the weekend and using your dscan powers to keep yourself safe.
---
So they are more than just an annoyance then?  Because if they were just an annoyance I would think that you'd go fight other nullsec entities still.  And if they are more than that you are going to leave your space undefended to come attack highsec out of some misguided spite?  The logic doesnt really flow there.
---
I think this idea, and think it has promise. The notion that an abandoned structure slowly becomes an active threat that requires management and removal is great!
---
That said, it's a second step idea, once a first step like has been proposed by the OP is in place. Let's go one step at a time :)
---
Maybe it is the dickmove of ccp like "yeah go on attack highsec do your thing, we can do it too"
---
If you're using firefox, there's also a plugin called  kee (used to be keefox) that links to your keepass database, entering login form data automatically if it detects it in the page and there's a keepass entry with the right url.
---
And it still isn't adding up to the amount in high sec.  Highseccers are super numerous but disjointed and spread out through the empire spaces.
---
Goons in wormholes? Ewww gtfo
---
Dude. GTFO. We play eve to escape the real life political bullshit.
---
Burn . It. All.
---
Get the magic 14 to all 5
---
Having to have a titan and super alt would reduce the number of the being used in game titans were supposed to be rare,really rare not have hundreds on grid at the same time even scrub lowsec alliances can field 20-30 titans  many more if your snuff 
---
 If a lowsec pirate  scrubblike me can have a titan something has gone wrong with the game
---
You cant extract skills under 5.5 mil
---
If you think the Drifters are based just wait until the Unshackled Overminds show up.
---
Like.... the gas station?
---
SHUT THE FUCK UP
---
Shut up!   That doesn't fit the narrative that people who don't have any idea what they are talking about and don't have to deal with the Drifters are pushing!
---
Damn man, that's like, 20 billion ISK you're passing up on right there
---
local for highsec,  
---
constellation for lowsec,  
---
region for null.
---
Bro drifters have been fucking up peoples gameplay since 2009.
---
Ya’ll just bitching you have to encounter them now.
---
1.Yes
---
2. Battelships and Cruisers
---
3. Yes smaller fleets that reinforce stuff (2x Cruiser, 1x Battleship) can be killed by a normal carrier relative easy
---
4. Not wort farming it
---
That's... Not exactly how drifters in wormhole space work?  They don't just \*appear\* out of nowhere, there is a reason for them being there, usually from someone hooning the system by shooting the structure in multiple garrisons.  It's immediately evident that there are drifters in a system by where they are (usually on a wormhole).    
---
That being said, the wormhole variants don't have a DD to oneshot you, either.
---
uh yes exactly that and nothing else
---
Additional context, Mittens is mad about it, and people are memeing the hell out of his whining.
---
Real life politics on r/Eve. No thanks.
---
Just so my thoughts are clear on the drifters, so you guys can feel the salt.  Wormholers should be the last to laugh here because their structures are the most vulnerable to these things.  Oh, have a fleet up that can take on the current group? well, here's another group of them at the same time!
---
If you're going to add pvp like entities, make them fit the normal rules of pvp.  
---
* Should be able to lock them while they warp off, to scram them.  Right now, soon as they initiate warp, they're unlockable.
---
* Should be able to see where they are, in a general sense.  Dscan, local, overview apparently.
---
* Should be able to break their support ships rather than each ship is self supporting.
---
* Should be able to have some sort of economic impact, either positive for the player for defeating them, or negative for the drifters for losing.
---
* Players take 2 seconds to lock and shoot anything, on top of any restrictions on their ship.   Destiny enforces that.   First second, start lock.   Second second, finish lock, start shoot.  third second, shoot.  It certainly doesn't feel like drifters have that delay.
---
But I think forced PVE is fucking terrible.  See also: ratting for indexes.
---
I can take the other things they do that makes them tough to deal with, assuming there is a reward.
---
* Perfect tracking, or perfect skills for tracking? not sure.  I just know that I've survived a lot of hostile blobs, getting shot, and never survive after getting locked by the drifters.  Got killed close orbiting a BS, high transversal, but nope.
---
* 3k a sec battleships? sure, why not, I mean someone can somehow do a perfectly tracking, permamwd at 3k a sec, with great resists, great self-tank, ewar, etc etc.
---
* Kill online structures? sure, why not, might as well have something to shoot, since there's nothing to shoot otherwise.  Shooting random offline structures? nah.
---
* No reasoning behind stuff?  'It is a big mystery!'  Sure, I guess there is a story somewhere, since all the other empire stories have been abandoned.  Like the eve gate, the monoliths, anything involving anything with the 4 empire alliances.  Which leads to...
---
* Why fix old stuff when you can just add new stuff that is broke instead?  Sure, fine.  Don't worry, we'll iterate once, in a year, and then stop iterating to write new broken shit rather than fixing the old stuff.
---
* Huh, drifters are getting spanked?  Well, they warped in another fleet.  At one point, we had three fleets hanging around, warping at range, alphaing things, then warping off.
---
* Why not have a ping on every gate?  I mean, no frigates burning, just randomly warp to 500km off the friendly fleet, without reasoning.  Not to a nearby structure, a probed friendly, etc.  Just randomly warp.
---
* 20 Battleships can just move around, easily.  Is it wormholes?  who knows, it's magic as far as we can tell right now!  'they'll follow you'.  Yeah, to someone who isn't going to care, for the most part.
---
Anyway, just annoyed that this was, again, poorly implemented, poorly iterated upon, poorly communicated.  
---
It's a simple question, why don't your real life friends play eve.  All of us know gamers that could play eve, but they choose not to.  why.
---
Yeah but what's stopping the nullsec alliances retaking territory when the drifters move out cause they're gonna be ready to retake and then some alliances can become even bigger so they need to at least try to split up alliances when they move out or maybe I'm just wrong but lmk.
---
I think it will help with citadel spam. All the null sec groups are complaining about the timers generated. I am curious if the emergent gameplay is not going to be less structures.
---
We will see though. We are not even in phase three right now. Supposedly this is a three phased event between the Drifters and the Triglavians from what some people pieced together. Who knows how it will end, but will be interesting for sure.
---
cry some moar.
---
Here's to hoping the CSM convinces CCP to expand this amazing and engaging mechanic to wormhole space and highsec.
---
You guys are seriously shitty. Blaming CCP Falcon for this *temporary* inconvenience is like cussing out the bagger at your grocery store because they ran out of your favorite cereal. 
---
&gt; Whoever’s in charge of the community team there needs to remember who pays the fucking bills
---
Yeah, you get ‘em, Karen.
---
Usually when they add new ones, they'll add it to the General tab.  source: i've been doing an overview for 5 years.
---
Three units of carbon?
---
Yes, but my testing (and confirmed by Corp mates) shows that using windows client on wine works about 20% better. We think that it’s due to better memory call handling, but aren’t sure.
---
It is the next big thing in the game. Triglavians mucking up High Sec, now Drifters are mucking up Null Sec. Before long we'll have Rogue Drone Swarms mucking up Low Sec. Long term we might see -every NPC faction in the game- become a dynamic threat.
---
if the ratters dock any time a red enters region they wont get much ratting done.
---
Wilmore is smart people
---
Really just want the drifters to evolve to just nuke the shit out of structures and just destroy the shit out of nullsec and resetting it😂
---
So how come the drifters are not showing up on D-Scan?
---
Ooof. If only it were a ghost site.
---
They wouldn't need to be pets if the large entity can't hold thr space.
---
Did you forget what the discussion is about?
---
Man that is juicy. 
---
“Did you just say no when I said to kill frigates you STUPID MOTHERFUCKER”
---
I fucking love srs time vidya gamez
---
But then you wouldn't be able to  whine about the drifters.
---
Fair enough!
---
&gt; I think someone that is actively paying attention would have enough to get off grid if they started to warp the second they appeared
---
As someone who does combat sites on a fairly regular basis (mostly ded sites and normal anomalies) i can assure you, i wouldn't notice, maybe i could if i had killed enough ships that the noise of missiles and  gunfire would be low enough that i would hear the noise of something warping onto my grid, but i find that very unlikely. Yes i could see them on the overview, but it is a difficult thing when you are in the middle of an anomaly fighting dozens upon dozens of npcs, to notice the 3 new ones that are about to fuck you up in a couple of seconds.
---
Even making sure you can spot a player warping onto your grid is difficult precisely because of that, however a player can be identified by combat probes, dscan, or local, and a player doesn't have an OP scram range, or insta lock ability. And there are things i can do about it, like i can kite him, i have means of defending myself if caught. Even in the worst case scenario of a player using a cyno to bring up a huge fleet to kill you, there are things you can do, you can try using ecm drones to escape (i lost quite a few kills that way) using heavy neuts to neut out the scram. But with Drifters there are no means of defending yourself when caught by drifters, and that's the problem.
---
&gt;I believe the Drifters were set up to be able to reach across Anoms. Not only do you have the lore aspect of them being a super advanced race, but if they were a tool being used to combat botters, it would make sense for them to be able to have range to cover the whole anom. Bot makers are smart enough to try to use any method they can to exploit weaknesses in the AI behavior. You see it like when players use long range battleships to outrange rats in sites.
---
Yeah that does seem to be the goal of the system, the problem however is that nothing can escape it, no bots, no humans either, which is why i said it that if ccp intends this to be completely impossible to escape it, they might as well cut out the middleman and just introduce a base flat 10% chance of insta death the moment you warp into an anom, because that's how frustrating this mechanic is going to end up being. 
---
&gt;I honestly think it's making a mountain out of a molehill. I've played in Null and the rewards for SOV far outweigh the risks, especially for the large entities. Some kind of challenge needs to be put back in to owning Sov. Players have failed at engaging other player entities to drive content and have removed most risk by allying with almost everyone they can. I think this change does a number of things for Null Sec that needed to be done for a while. It's too bad the players would rather complain because it's not EZ mode anymore rather than appreciate the bigger picture.
---
I don't disagree, the issue however is that such risk needs to have some way for a player to counter or interact with. I'm not saying that there should be ways for players to make themselves safe, what i'm saying is that there should be ways for a player that knows what they are doing to actually deal with the drifters, or skillfully avoid them or escape from them, based on everything that is known about the drifters at this time, this doesn't seem possible unless you already know about the presence of them in system, and the only counter play is to not play, which is a shitty system, especially considering that we are dealing with an NPC, not some player entity coming to town to bully you into submission, a game mechanic that at least right now, has no way for a individual player to deal with it.
---
&gt;at least (anything to make starter overview anything but hot garbage)
---
how dare you bring such disgusting concepts to this blessed land
---
You're assuming the drifters are constant, which we know they aren't.
---
yeah, those who make the overview use the general as a guide sometimes, and they failed to add something that is openly hostile without special content.
---
Your overview maker has to worry about this.  Or you have to.
---
You act as if these changes immediately change player behavior.
---
Change takes time.
---
This is a good post. Mighty salty, but good.
---
who they hell reads local / region?
---
if by spammed you mean too full to be a useful intel tool perhaps that is the idea. 
---
there is a reason we tell newbies not to rat or mine in the staging keepstar system. you want a nice quiet system you can see when enemies enter local. if there are 200 people in local thats not as effective.
---
To everyone dealing with this across New Eden, I am truly sorry you have to spend your day gunning a structure instead of enjoying a holiday with your family out of game.
---
There is no sarcasm in this. I do not care who you gun for - you do not deserve this to happen. Being forced to play is the surest way to convince someone not to.
---
I am praying for Bob to send Rogue Drones to Low Sec.
---
It already has, it has wound up 1 war and stopped another
---
Good idea!
---
abra cadabra
---
TonyG backed them into a narrative corner
---
Oh, I thought you were talking about people moving into the dead space.
---
Or do you like just bait and switching?
---
Continue not playing and getting laid.
---
Because local existed.
---
I think region chat would be good as a replacement for local and I wasn't saying otherwise. I also think possibly having local tied to gate cloak could work as a less extreme change
---
&gt;bots, ratters and miner shouldn't be getting killed by fucking rats of all things
---
What? Why the hell not? Huge alliances have made it impossible for small scale gangs to operate in Sov so they only ever fight eachother. They rarely fight eachother because fighting is too expensive. Maybe if rats upset the status quo in Null enough you might actually see REAL PLAYERS dipping their toes into Null instead of just diving into wormholes and never coming back out.
---
If they're not constant, then they won't affect nullsec constantly.
---
Wouldn't work, nullsec empires are autistic enough to set up permanent gate camps to watch all everything that comes in and out of their systems
---
Baconator: 8 lines
---
Better question why isnt there a "new shit" catagory that is default on
---
Y u blob on horde like that?
---
As a member of VoC let me confirm that we sit on gates with our cloaked blackops, waiting for the supers to jump into us (yes it is that simple, our secret has been revealed). And since covert cloaks have no drawbacks, we could lock those supers even faster!
---
I can only imagine how much time we would spend refitting and storing our T3s in our covert cloak titan catching blackops. We would be invincible.
---
Grrr fat orange Nixon bad grrrr
---
Get them to 4 first. 5 whenever you have time.
---
Select all your stuff in the hangar, rightclick &gt; create contract, item exchange, to exact terms your new character.
---
These drifters don’t have doomsday
---
Good post.
---
Sad it'll be ignored by CCP
---
Except when you have no structure to undock from
---
Yeah.... for a list that shows everyone in one region...
---
Dropping alliance now with corp. Which faction/region is the best?
---
&gt; They wouldn't need to be pets if the large entity can't hold thr space.
---
If large entities can't hold their space why would small entities would ?
---
It was abundantly clear goons were ready to go home anyways - so if anything this 'event' only helps them by giving them a concrete excuse
---
&gt; Why fix old stuff when you can just add new stuff that is broke instead? Sure, fine. Don't worry, we'll iterate once, in a year, and then stop iterating to write new broken shit rather than fixing the old stuff.
---
ccp 2006-2019
---
meh we get it. It's becoming a stale meme
---
So most of them are living :^)
---
well written, well presented and thought out post. Take an updoot.
---
This is what happens when CCP integrates AI controlled drifter NPC's LMFAO
---
We were in the middle of a sov defense getting our asses handed to us at the time. I hopped into a Caracal to join up with the main fleet after defending for two hours in a small gang. Got popped by a drifter trying to warp to a gate. 
---
Couldn’t help but laugh my ass off at it
---
Underrated post. Have an upvote for well-presented sarcasm.
---
whatever floats your boat
---
God I love nerdy vidya game mechanics analyses. Interesting read, OP, here’s an upvote.
---
cope tapitard
---
To be fair:
---
Drifters, like all null sec scum, have stayed the fuck out of Covryn.
---
You could do that instead of being a smooth brain null sec pubby.
---
tldr: there is a reason things are like they are now, i'm not gonna say what the reasons are let alone discuss if they make sense, but there are *reasons*, **reasons** i tell ye
---
this is something I am reading here all the time.  
---
I mean I don't know where you play. But the is content in Provi, here in TEST we get fleets everyday against FRT, Bombersbar seems to have a good time hunting expencive PVE ships, the CFC just ended a war.  
---
I just don't see how everything is boring. The only thing that comes to mind is when you are roaming around with 10 or 12 guys you have to jump through a lot of empty systems, but this isn't the players fault. New Ede just has waaaaaay to many systems for the player active at one time.
---
Yeah I'm fairly new to Eve and wanted to get into PvP right away but also where I could learn and grow as a pilot so I got into FW. I mostly stick to cheap frigates like 4M ISK fits so I can use just one play day a week to farm PvP money. 
---
It sucks running into some blinged out Federal Navy Comet like 100M ISK, where I stand almost zero chance to kill it. It's most fun when two cheap fits bashing it out in novice until some turd in a worm warps in and everyone is like well fuck this.
---
To generate salt for my popcorn
---
The real tragedy here is some of those citadel names.
---
Manhour tax to owning infrastructure isn't necessarily always bad. But this implementation of it is too much for a permanent mechanic. We still don't know whether drifters are meant to be permanent or just a world event.
---
Nice analysis.
---
damage types aren't so much an issue as orbiting at 100k at 3k m/s while warping off to perches where you're unable to probe them.
---
not quite sure that shit's something you have to deal with in wormholes.
---
Intel bots are a cancer too.  Not denying that. But you can get wormhole entrances.
---
CCPVP
---
Your logic is pretty sound, lets see what the drifter circle jerk has to say about this.
---
Yeah that's fair, having to sub a second account for your super/titan would help significantly.
---
I don't think it's unreasonable to ask CCP for manhour taxes that are fun, rewarding, engaging, or god forbid promote, rather than detract from the average number of pvp encounters per day in null.
---
They behave differently that in WH’s and don’t cap escalate.
---
As part of the prophecy of Macaper who predicted 7 events that would signal the end of the world, the incoming apocalypse, CCP directly confirmed the drifters are the "little brother returning home; they are not welcome" which is the 5th prophecy.
---
tbf you should step on a Lego.
---
Because for the big null blocs this has shattered their sense of safety and security. With a new invading force that cannot be bargained with, bribed, or set blue entities like TAPI and GS are forced now to look at covering their own asses from a threat they can't hinder without a challenge. Being able to drop 200 supers on a fleet of NPCs only to have said NPCs rip them to shreds is a huge blow to the n+1 meta that has been prevalent for years now. 
---
I don't know how this is going to all play out. I'm not mad or salty at CCP for throwing a wrench into the works. I've had to deal with a few of the drifters myself now on station guns. It's a huge swing that nobody in the playerbase saw coming and the salt that is flowing in is impressive, but in the end we'll either improvise, adapt, and overcome. Or we'll all die in drifter fire.
---
Praise be to Bob
---
I think its just to make new eden feel less safe since most big null guys are blued (friends)
---
Fuck snuff
---
Drifters cum first. Got to get that mess cleaned up before the major null block will think about it.
---
So is your flair
---
no , it's not. do not fly t1 frigates , that blow up in seconds , meanwhile due to shakes or whatever you forgot to stard record, or it ended too early because of trial limit. 
---
That advice is shit. Just flying a destro and searching\\teorycrafting with fits will give you time to react and analyze what happend. You don't need 100 fking deaths just to start to figure out what happend .
---
With right destro fit he will almost garanteed with occasional kills
---
Praise be the gods
---
The real fireworks won't be till later :trollface:
---
Easier than that to fix drifting overviews.
---
Add a new thing?  Base it off the old thing.
---
New Flag cruisers being added.  Is it missing from the previous config? base it's value off teh Command Destroyers.  Or the Command Ships.    New rat being added?  Base it off old rats.
---
Or better yet: write a better overview method.  Cause this is the biggest thing newbies have trouble with.
---
for now )))))))
---
I step on small Legos every day in hopes I can eventually survive stepping on Duplos.
---
To see the drifters in your dscan you need to have them set on your overview. Also keep in mind, you may have to set them for all wanted tabs you wish to see them at. Otherwise it won't pick up
---
I wish people would focus less on local, its always been a bit overpowered but it's not the main problem and removing it won't fix PVP. What really matters is the imbalance between subs and supers. As long as every response fleet is super alts roaming will stay dead. And as long as titan count is all that matters sov warfare will stay dead. 
---
Until this gets addressed removing local will just create a few more VNI ganks, that's all. In fact it'll push even more people into capitals, because they'll at least survive long enough to cyno in the supers and FAX.
---
Nah they were just dorks
---
Quote true. I can however read;
---
&gt;I have the skill injectors from the twitch rewards (unused)
---
lets say there are 1000 goons and 15 cloaky campers in delve. are you going to notice a 15 man roaming gang ?
---
Remove PVP keeps Drifters blalp everything in null They take all SOV and everyone stay high sec come roleplay. :)
---
I agree.
---
These are all quite good ideas. Couple this with the similar list of simple FW mechanics changes that has been outlined a few times by various people and you'd breathe a heck of a lot of life back into combat in this game.
---
The most important point is definitely the timer changes, both number and timing. It still confuses me that CCP doesn't seem willing to mine the best pieces that worked well from the past systems like the ability to create a weekend timer. The rest of the citadel changes (most specifically guns not being available until significantly damaged) are also quite needed.
---
As a minor point, for keepstars specifically I think it'd be nice to keep the current three timers; I think it'd be a neat way to reinforce (heh) their role as the crown jewel of citadels by encouraging an extra chance for a fight over them. The downside of course would be that with three timers it'd be harder to take advantage of the ability to dictate the day the timer comes out. Do you think it would be incredibly terrible if keepstars kept a 7 day hull timer (i.e. so you can reinforce the shield midweek to guarantee that the armor and hull timers both are on a weekend) if they're the *only* type of structure that retains that? I just have this vision of keepstar sieges as being *the* primo chance for giant hyped-up fights to take place and it seems a bit underwhelming if one can be popped in a mere 5 days with only one real chance for a fight.
---
I would also suggest an additional tweak to structure mechanics to encourage people to go after the newly-less-cancerous-to-kill structures - namely, a *small* nerf to asset safety. Everyone always seems to want to suggest removing asset safety completely, which would be far too harsh and also not work as everyone would simply move things to NPC space. However, asset safety *already* does incur some loss to the user, in the form of the 10% fee to recover items. What's missing is a corresponding gain to the attacker to reward them for their work. As such, I think it would be a significant improvement to, for *destroyed* structures only (unanchored structures remain the same), replace the 10% asset safety fee with a 10% chance for items to go into the drop lottery to be dropped from the structure as loot. (So, a 10% loss to the owner, with 5% being destroyed and 5% dropping. As a bonus, one could even treat any destroyed ships as having been killed in the normal manner i.e. spawning a salvageable/lootable wreck next to the citadel wreck.) This is functionally equivalent for the owner (albeit with some potential hilarity if the 10% chance rolls on a big-ticket item like a titan, which I think is an *upside*), but gives the attackers some actual monetary incentive to tip over sandcastles *without* just deleting asset safety.

I am doing Level 2 missions for a gallente agent doing industrial, however I am not gaining any standing with Gallente, only with the Agent and the Corp the agent works for. How do I raise my standings with Gallente to get to Level 3 missions?
---
it's not like there's any other part of the game I could play during my drifter whackamole jump fatigue timers.
---
this whole thread translates to "I was unable to blue the drifters, so i am now bitching at ccp because of my incompetence as a ~spaceship head diplomat~"
---
Drifters randomly target a celestial and warp to it when they enter a system, so there's not a huge need for that as there's not really constant attacks.
---
Inb4 Test completes the first unironic blue donut
---
So what happens when everyone in nullsec unsubs 4 of their 5 accounts due to this.
---
Im sure Drifters wont keep this up if CCP doesnt have money to pay them...
---
CCPs cannot add mechanics so that players can provoke others into active actions, it is easier to make drifters who will punish everyone and get bored of it all and the Eve will definitely die at an accelerated pace.
---

Yes...let everyone enjoy it.  
---
Too good not to share.
---
Quality TEST post. Please do not ignore.
---
You might watch Jin'Taan's new video. He says that there's zero evidence of targeting for any reason they can come up with based on spawn locations, it's either random or they were placed by hand by CCP. He also mentions that it doesn't seem to target botters.
---
The assumed thing right now over getting the data together is that the drifters just warp to a random celestial. They just soften structures because they hit them randomly, but they don't come back because they chance of them coming again when the timer is up is super tiny.

**YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH**
---
Yeah, a lot of us have started flying t1 destroyers instead, just because of all the cheese novice plex 1v1 can bring. Even the navy faction frigs are, frankly, aids, with the reasonably balanced exception of the firetail that still manages to win most of its t1 matchups by virtue of "I'm a rifter with 4 mids".
---
I'm not sure whether I hate the rail comet or the TD armor hookbill more.  I guess the hookbill can at least be forced off by a dual tank breacher / vigil fleet. Maybe. 6.75 launcher DPS racing might just give it enough to even break dual tank. Honestly I think the hookbill might be the king of aids. Or the crucifier navy issue.
---
Not even beginning to talk about worms.
---
I'm curious what some of the matchups would look like if all that shit was moved into smalls. Slicer would suffer since its only advantage over the retri is speed. Same with the Firetail and the Dramiel. Worm with a web beats or draws with every AF, I think? Can AB vengeance with a web beat it? Brawly worm might lose to destroyers. I'm pretty sure succ beats everything that fits in a small except sentinels / worms.
---
I think hitting 3 ships that were already in serious need of buffs is a pretty good deal for bringing back the t1 frig clown fiestas of novice pvp.
---
How would I help these ships out?
---
Dunno if I'd touch the slicer. The speed advantage over the Retribution in exchange for tank, dps, and cost is worth considering as possibly ok. Buffing small pulses would probably be the way to go, tbh, since they're in such a bad spot on things not named Polarized Coercer.
---
Give the firetail more dakka. 5 effective turrets is not enough dps for what it does compared to the comet and hookbill, and small artillery isn't in a good spot. I'd straight up the damage bonus to 30% and tune from there. Make the advantages "fast, 4 mids, hits like a truck" and the big disadvantages "fragile and has to use small projectiles which suck donkey dick".
---
Same concept with the Dramiel, with it having 3 drones and 4 effective turrets, with both tracking and falloff bonuses - it just doesn't hit hard enough. Up the role bonus to 150% and tune from there.
---
Or buff small projectiles, but the trend has been to buff the ships that use them instead, to avoid making the Svipul, Thrasher, Wolf, and Rifter, ships that do okay using these weapons, too good.
---
There are a lot of balance issues in facwar right now, with cruisers vs t3ds being another big issue (t3ds in a 1v1 environment just aren't good enough right now, hecate notwithstanding) but I think the big one, and most impactful one to new players, would be sorted quite nicely by moving faction frigs to smalls and letting new players fly t1 frigs and destroyers in an environment a little more free from utter helldunks.
---
I know right...

---
Don’t see that changing for large alliances.
---
Don't blame players for playing optimally, blame the design for making optimal not fun.
---
I mean there are basic citadel maintenance tasks such as refueling that aren't rewarding, engaging, fun, but still necessary and good for the health of the game.
---
But I get what you mean. For example, CCP could have spent 1/4 of the effort spent to drifters to a mobile deployable that replaces siphon units (in a better, stronger way that favors the thief). So now citadel owners must be wary against thiefs, and chasing them off is a new kind of manhour tax. There you go, something that discourages citadel spam by introducing a manhour tax, yet also encourages meaningful PvP activity.
---
Until they hit my baitaru, I am Unaffected :D
---
Shhhh! Don't tell Kenny!
---
man-hours per hour is just mans &gt;:(

its only bad game design when it negatively affects me, all other times you should adapt or die

I’m not a carebaer I don’t care about all that.. it’s more like everyone who lives in nullsec is affected by that.. even the pvpers because nothing left to shoot :)

I really love the "bring back passive moon mining" it's really annoying and it force you to have a mining force and care about your territory and not just "destroy this athanor, place one get the goddies if they destroy it don't care just repeat" a PvP alliance focus i really hope to see one day, and i don't think that gonna "buff" the big alliance they already have renter for that  
---
with other great idea, upvote &lt;3
---
I like that a lot actually.  I don't even think this mechanic is entirely unsalvageable either, I just think it's fundamental assumptions are flawed.  I did a write up last week about how I would have implemented this in a pvp-fueling way.  I'll pasta it here I'd love your thoughts on it.
---
&gt; I'd take the drifter fleets and make them spawn randomly from a fake wormhole in a region, one system per region, once per timezone, and roam from gate to gate jumping from system to system until killed. They would only warp through belts and anomalies, maybe also sit on gates and jump bridges looking for ratters/miners. You also give them 250km disruptors.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; They would do 1/10th the dps/logi but have 20x the tank
---
&gt; What that makes, is a content driver. Drifter fleets tackle ratters and rorqs, and will eventually kill them if you don't fight them with a real pvp fleet comp. That pvp comp is not really under threat from the drifters alone, but they are tethered to the grid for 15-20 minutes fighting them saving the rorqs. That's enough time for a spontaneous engagement where most importantly, there are known unknowns on the grid. How do the drifters pick a target? who will they point? who will they shoot? You now have a dynamic engagement where even with perfect intel, neither side knows whether or not they will win, but both sides think they can win. Those are the kinds of fights people take, and what makes eve interesting.
---
&gt; Huge alliances have made it impossible for small scale gangs to operate in Sov
---
Yet everyday small gangs roam delve, killing literal billions. Why are you so scared to try it yourself?
---
i would also not be adverse to a ship type being invisible in local in the same way combat recons are invisible on d-scan.
---
combat interceptors or perhaps marauders?
---
Need more drifters.
---
It's basically my homepage at this point.
---
Yeah I literally just killed one of his miners like 2 days ago. 10 or so of them warped off but one was late so I tackled it. He sat there for a while and then finally launched drones so idk
---
I've been in TEST over two years with my corp SPVG. When we first came, many systems in Catch (an area still under siege when we moved in), had no citadels, so corp dropped a many for alliance. Or Immensea/Tenerifis  where TEST fought not one, but two wars with both Red Alliance + friends and FRT. We cleared Immensea twice. Many of the structures were militarily strategic at the time - and many still are. Today I sold five corp citadels to Legacy. I'd rather not have the dozens of citadel spam notices from Drifters in the corp inbox. I've also reduced our fuel bills. So +1 there. But ... citadels are *still* cancer in many ways, especially with two timers that can be timezone tanked. On CSM,  please support the idea of a one-shot structure - those that are not fueled and have no module; they should die on the first hit. *That* would reduce citadel spam. Then do the same thing in low-sec and high-sec. I created and FC'd a squad called 'Demo Square Please Ignore'. Today it has 300+ members. I know plenty about clearing citadels from regions. It's cancer, and timezone tanked timers make it even more crappy. Have you visited SV5 in Catch recently? Did you know Legacy killed over 300 structures just in the HED-GP constellation already once in the last year? Engaging gameplay, eh? End the madness /u/Olmeca_Gold .. take us away from citadel mechanics that screwed pvp. Or, just blame us for using the tools CCP gave us to build an empire. That's what CCP is doing, right? Punishing nullsec blocs for their shitty game mechanics?

You need to chill and wait. All that lore buildup with trigs attacking drifters probably means theres some way they can be confronted soon.

You should probably just hunker down and watch the fireworks

At the end of the day all PvE based mechanics will be minmaxed and turn into "unengaging manhour tax". In your scenario, people eventually would create teams, learn how to deal with them efficiently, and repeat the process every time. As I said that might not be a bad thing, as some additional manhour tax can indeed be used to balance citadel spam. So yeah, I agree this drifter thing isn't unsalvageable.
---
Making them take gates can be complicated though. What people kept telling me in my first week as CSM is that dev time is the actaul precious resource and the more minimalist the devtime requirements of your proposal is, the better its chances are.
---
They are using the invasion as a pretext to shut down eve.
---
First, they're going to burn everything.
---
Nobody puts Drifters in a corner.
---
Since you've been running them a fair bit, have you seen any of these Drifters DD like regular Drifters do?
---
Hey man, you dropped this.
---
Wait, are those your balls?
---
so, watching the olmeca gold video on whaling, something struck me: apparently, you can use the PANIC button to protect not only yourself, but also others mining ships. I did not know about that, in fact I was slightly "WTF ?" here.
---
I've been on numerous whale hunts, as well as whale saves, but I never witnessed that. 
---
- what is the range on the panic protection and restriction ?
---
- how come I only hear of it now ? is it used often or is it a gimmick that is only use by multi-botters ? Sorry, meant boxers
---
if taking gates is too complicated, give every system in a region a ~2-3% chance to spawn one per day.  Functional equivalence.  You're right that people learn to optimize pve, but if you can make the optimal strategy something that fuels pvp I think it's a net positive.  Right now absolutely none of this fuels pvp, and is likely detracting from hundreds if not thousands of potential pvp interactions per day.
---
Yeah, OP needs to brush up on units
---
It's... It's...
---
*Beautiful...*
---
Isn't this like the 10th time this has been posted ?
---
we have not observed the current iteration of drifters DDing when they lose blue shield.
---
carriers do
---
If you can't defend your stuff, you shouldn't have it.
---
He wasn't alone
---
true
---
Looking at this now, what's the difficulty scaling like per tier? I'm looking at doing  Medium (fierce) to start off.  Would that put me in over my head?
---
IDK about all that stuff, but I do know how to count the flairs of who is complaining and who is cheering.
---
I watched a raitaru fight off a drifter fleet with fuckall but bombs last night. If y'all can't manage it with keepstars and super fleets what are you even doing.
---
that happened way before the drifters came along
---
Eh, our shit ain't repairing :(
---
Drifters have caused a lot of final timers too.
---
no one in sov null undocking wow.. no wait..

---
Best thing is you will be able to build your own trig ships to go pew with!
---
My opinion (obviously) it's CCP being CCP. Just create stupid random chaos. It worked in my opinion some gaming websites picked up and reported the stuff. That's advertisment. The current drifter stuff is probably over soonish and they'll add triglavian invasion sites or something of the kind to nullsec.
---
they can defend it, in fact they can easily defend it, the whole point is that it's a fucking dumbass bullshit timesink that just gives people busy work, and the number of drifter attacks doesn't necessarily correlate with the number of structures
---
Because null is actually the most secure space in eve.
---
Nice, thanks :pray:
---

Unless CCP is using the invasion as a way to shut eve down and just want to burn all of us ungrateful SOBs to the ground before flipping the switch.

lololol, adapt or die
---
Lol. I like the drifter shitposts. The serious posts about them are much worse.
---
Stop complaining and just let the shield timers go, not like anyone gives a fuck about that first timer anyway (for the most part). Just get people ready to form and defend the armor ones if Drifters decide to miraculously turn up for one.
---
Then give me the man-hours for those. I'm guessing that even if an enemy groups decides to take advantage of that timer the effort needed by your alliance members to fight that in your own regions would be minimal (and content after all).
---
Even better, let the random low chance drifter fleet go through the armor timer aswell and just get ready to defend the structure one. How much effort is needed for that?
---
I might be missing something, but you guys seem to be totally overreacting to this attacks.
---

Its absolutely possible to make the isk for a sub easily, but for such a new character its nearly impossible. I tried after being in the game for a month, and nearly quit from the grind. Just pay for the subscription and enjoy the game doing what you want

One of many alternatives is combat-isking. Go fight people and sell off the shiny stuff that drops. Setup gatecamps, learn to bait and gank, etc. Exploration is always good too.
---
Krabbing by itself is not bad, you can rat and mine to your heart's content for all I care. But some people make eve a second job, they just rat and rat or mine and mine only to buy bigger and better things to rat and mine. Don't be a bot, don't be a drone in large pvp fleets in which all you do is anchor on FC and press F1. 
---
Events like this force people to actually pay attention and ***play the game*** instead of just making isk while watching netflix.
---
RvB is still very much alive and kicking.
---
Ostensibly, the drifters could go about and turn the empty nullsec into shattered systems with a bunch of malfunctioning gates that can teleport you semi-randomly, like a "soft wormhole" system.
---
Welp wasn't going to log in, now I'm logging in! Thanks.

Pretty much. We're used to fighting in ways that involve more than hitting "jump to" and the doomsday key.

didnt they already do drifter invasion stuff in highsec? but they were more op.
---

---
napkin math says in the average three regions of the game there are about a 1000-1500 structures.  1000 timers, spread over ~2 days, 250-500 manhours to babysit, but all over the same period of time preventing us from engaging a hostile fleet reinforcing something during those 2-3 hours when all the timers come out.  Even without the risk of hull timers turning off services (research, cloning, construction, etc...) it's not worth the risk.
---
Now, if you want to argue that three regions having a thousand structures is a bad thing you'll get no argument from me.  I think citadels in general were a mistake, but that's neither here nor there.  If ccp wanted to, say, up the fuel requirements of cits by 100x per structure you'd limit the numbers of cits in a region too, and if you announced it in advance people could redirect their infrastructure and consolodate to accommodate the change.  There's no circumstance where it's appropriate for a developer to design a system, reinforce a specific playstyle as optimal for years, and then with no warning punish everyone for doing it.
---
I'm catching up with the recent eve online happens how dangerous is the Drifters ? At first it seemed like they were just an annoyance but it seems now they are actually causing some damage.
---
The issue isn't that large alliances have made it impossible for small groups to operate, it's that CCPs game mechanics have forced small groups to consolidate into larger and larger blobs in order to be competitive.
---
LOL, SF are fine, they even dropped more timezone-tanked structures in the last week :D
---
wait, finding my violin.
---
so basically what getting caught by a tackle ship feels like?
---
Uh, Olmeca, Your not supposed to say stuff that makes me want to upvote you.
---
Not a bad group of suggestions. Agree with some, not so much with others. 
---
* Upwell structures do need rework. They should be vulnerable to attack at any time and come out of reinforcement during the set time frame. 
---
* The timeframes need to be broader so that timezone tanking is not an issue. I would make it 3 time frames that bridged across 2 different TZs( AU-EU, EU-US, US-AU). The number of days until the timer comes out being based on size is a good idea
---
* If the damage cap increases I see no reason to get rid of the plates. Make it a fitting option for players
---
* I don't agree with nerfing the weapons. Let them be usable for defense . That's what they're there for
---
* I don't agree with passive mining. There's a reason it got changed, and I think the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.
---
* Timers on Sov structures need tweeking. Pretty good suggestions
---
* TCU and IHUB are technically different in respect to their function. TCU being for claim on the system itself and Ihub providing upgrades to that system. I'm not sure rolling them all in to one would be good.
---
* Anoms need to have longer respawn timers. Currently you can camp a single system and run anoms endlessly. This needs to change. Ore and combats have too short of a respawn, especially the high end ones. 
---
* Cyno inhibs do need a buff. As it stands they take entirely too long to deploy and can be removed from field too easily. Add some resists to make them more durable and able to be repped by logi on grid. Maybe 25% across the board. Increase range to 200 km as well
---
* Blops BS should have been given a covert cloak a long time ago. The argument that it was too OP is silly. They can't be nullified and they align like a fat lady trying to sit on the toilet, which makes them easy to decloak. 
---
* T3s are in need of a buff. Agree 100% with this whole statement. Swapping rigs is a novel idea, but didn't really add a whole to to them compared to what was taken away. The overheat bonuses were nice as well, but they're just not worth using given the cost and SP loss associated with losing them. They used to be a mainline ship for wormholers due to the performance and low mass. Now they don't get used much at all.   
---
*  There's ways to get around tackle in anoms. I can't see this as something that won't be mitigated soon after it's implemented. 
---
* I don't agree with the sentiment about the Drifters. I think they are a needed element in the game nowadays. There has always been some kind of "forced" PvE whether people want to admit it or not. You have NPCs you are forced to fight in asteroid belts if you want to mine, NPCs you are forced to fight in FW, NPCs that hang around gates in null that you can be forced to fight, and Incursion rats in incursions systems have sometimes made life harder on capsuleers travelling through them. The only difference is that most of these NPCs are not a threat to the high SP players we have nowadays. Dealing with them is trivial at best. Now that the NPCs take more than a few shots to deal with, players are up in arms.  
---
Null has become an almost risk free environment where capsuleer groups collude to make space safer and exploit   
---
the richness and benefits offered by this space. It's no longer dangerous like it used to be. CCP has seen this and   
---
after standing on the sidelines waiting for players to bring danger back to this space, they have decided to do it   
---
themselves. You can't have all of the reward with none of the risk. It throws the whole game out of balance. We've   
---
seen it with the fleets of 1000 Titans that now roam this space. It has gone too far.  
---
Players say that CCP needs to focus on more content drivers, but none of that matters if the players themselves   
---
are unwilling to engage. You can blame CCP all you want for this problem, but its players themselves that bear the   
---
responsibility of using the tools provided to create content. You also can't scream about how Eve is a sandbox   
---
and you don't want CCP making it in to a theme park MMO , and then turn around and blame CCP for not creating   
---
the content. Which way do you want it? 
---
This is getting a bit long so I'll just close saying that I think there are some good idea here and +1 to a lot of them. 
---
Hopefully we can get some of the changes implemented regardless of the screeching from groups that don't want actual positive changes because it would hurt their playstyle.
---
What else is new?
---
Even if this only lasts a week thats an insane pressure to put on nullsec groups for a week. And then what? What do they accomplish after a week of attacking nullsec desire to play or build empires. If this is a week long event all we learned is that at some CCP can and will decide to attack our space with unstoppable ai and we have no chance to deal with it. If that isn't trying to get us to stop playing I don't know what they are trying to do.
---
this guy \^\^\^
---
you aint evicting anyone with a small gang in null with or without local, you're just hunting them, as in wormholes.
---
Just gift me one and I will gift you a donation.
---
My guess is we have 14-21 more days of this or worse.  We had 7 days of easier before, we've seen drifter supers on sisi, and the lore isn't even close to being wrapped up in terms of the drifter/triglave thing.  If they follow suit of a new thing every wed, on the week, best case scenario next week is the climax.  Worst case scenario, they continue changing shit every week for the entire expansion and eve exists with an existence tax for months.
---
NCPL got kicked off the map by goons. Now that drifters are here, they will never log back on again.
---
Stop trying to hide behind anti botting.
---
You just want easy kills.
---
Any bot will just have an alpha on a gate that checks for players and your idiotic idea is now pointless.
---
Does anyone else think this drifter invasion was just a cheap attempt by CCP to burn peoples stuff to get them to buy plex to replace it? Does anyone have the add from the first day of the event with the  drifter invasion plex sale?
---
I'm not complaining about the permanence or lack thereof of drifters. I'm complaining about how much this highlights that vast fleets of insta-warping hyperspatial instalocking insta tackling super-powerful rats are what it takes to to shake things up. Real people cannot compete with that.
---
agree n the fatigue but think they should just roll back some fozzie sov stuff; make it so people have to undock to repair sov.  
---
Renters and rent alliances wont like it, but better in general.
---
I would argue that in a *game* the most optimal gameplay is the one that is the most fun.
---
Come to the wormholes, we kill drifters for profit here :P
---
DEATH TO THE FALSE MITTANI!
---
if only there was a tool you could use to check if people are within a certain range with no cooldown, and this other tool that can check pretty much system wide with a small ~5-6 second cd
---
Allergic to bees.
---
try 40+ jumps solo and everyone runs in null.  
---
unless you daly long enough for them to prep a cyno and a 20 man fleet.
---
Covert cynos.
---
Multiple entrances that can't be easily monitored by a bot.
---
&gt;I've swung over to Black Rise a couple times again lately, it's getting a lot more active again. Yay for killin shit!
---
Glad to have you around while the Comets help me paint my zkillboard page ted.
---
Highsec has the Triglavian invasion. They will gate camp, station camp &amp; find you if you are mission running/mining. They don't attack structures though.
---
Tbh most of those smugposting about this are those who are Not affected
---
I just gonna wait untill drifters come in the Same size and ammount to lowsec and whs lets See whos laughing then
---
CCP, in fact, has said absolutely nothing about the event or its intended purpose. That's just what you want to happen. Meanwhile, we're going to minmax the defense of this shit. We don't want to lose structures, after all.
---
&gt; The memes are amusing, even if we don't know if this is good for the game or not.
---
agreed, I was lacking the context only
---
you cannot expect a playerbase to artificially handicap themselves, because there will always be those that don't and will ruin it for everyone else.  I think [this article](https://www.designer-notes.com/?p=369) explores the phenomenon well.
---
i lol'd, tis true though aye, goons must be getting a lot of notification - they have literally spammed citadels all over the damn place.
---
Ooh like a t2 bs that has a cyno inhin module would be dope
---
sounds interesting but i think them actually holding sov is not realistic to expect.   
---
However they could have incursions spawned etc, have presence in every null system so if you want to expand you shit or "carve out your own way" you will have to be present and active in that system or the drifters will come and fuck over your thing.
---
Great kills, great heat control and great vid!
---
I'm amazed at how awful those Wolf pilots were, and at how fucking ceptors keep somehow losing tackle on your AB LS fitted frigates; but that doesn't change the fact that you are an awesome pilot and that you like to fight against all odds.
---
Lots of respect mate, 10/10.
---
or highsec, could you imagine?  What would highsec do if all the sudden their structures and ratters started popping without warning?
---
Let's face it if Drifters were easier and toned down they'd be tossed away content being cheesed with sig tanking shit or something 
---
Might as well make the op and one shot shit
---
Remember the new Rogue Drone member corps that came alongside the Triglavian release? Everything else from the Abyss has made its way to New Eden. LowSec's going to get Grey Goo'd.
---
Yeah you'll rarely catch me playing that game. I'm starting to fly more destroyers, but "I slide my rifter into anything" is an amusing gambler's game.
---
They are both in calmil but still mutual war with each other iirc
---
Isn’t that what every other play-style besides nullsec blocs was told the past 2 years?
---
" to make up for the smallgang gameplay which was nerfed out of the game in 2016 and the patch which made capital ships the best weapon to kill all subcaps and introduced a fucking reinforcement timer to the rorqual. "  
---
true  
---
 "These bots, ratters and miner shouldn't be getting killed by fucking rats of all things, it should be by other players"  
---
Also true  
---
" if this continues much longer there won't be a huge amount of PvP content as everyone is being besieged by jumped-up incursion rats. "  
---
As a small gang and solo orientated player and having taken two breaks already this year because of lack of content PvP wise...
---
Drifters are Goons from the future, confirmed.
---
What did Pandemic Horde ever do to you?
---
yes, lol, let me see if I can edit that sentence to be a little more unit sane
---
Nope. I am not an F1 monkey or adverse to pressing the undock button.
---
I think it’s more of “CCP watches subs/plex/injector revenue plummet as they force PvE on their PvP playerbase”
---
nope your region sucks way badderer lol i win
---
space module would be cool as long as people can fuck with it and there are requirements
---
Mittani Generalization:- “People who live in high sec and like to spam lvl 4 missions, mine ore and ice, and generally enjoy a safe and somewhat tame gameplay are bad for the game”
---
Actual Mittani and friends: lives in a highly protected and generally safe area surrounded by allies and Non Invasion Pacts, love to spam endlessly respawning anomalies, mine or and ice, has a massive fleet of Dreads, Supers, and Titans ready to assist a tackled Rorqual at a moments notice. 
---
*ENTER THE DRIFTERS*
---
Mittani and friends after being introduced to Drifter butt sex: “THIS IS NOT FAIR HOW DARE CCP EXPECT US TO ONLY USE THE SPACE WE CAN REASONABLY DEFEND AND ACTUALLY WANTS US TO DEFEND OUR KEEPSTARS. THE HIGH SEC CAREBEARS WILL PAY FOR THIS! WE WILL DESTROY HIGH SEC GAMEPLAY UNTIL CCP LETS US GO BACK TO MAKING TRILLIONS OF ISK MONTHLY WITH NO RISK WAAAAH “
---
&gt; the more minimalist the devtime requirements of your proposal are, the better its chances are.
---
Well that's good, because I pretty much just want shit deleted.
---
* Delete HAW guns.  Delete the stupid super projectiles and the stupid titan doomsdays such as GTFO.
---
* Rebalance sig radius between caps and subcaps. - admittedly, this takes some effort
---
* Reduce ratting bounties by 50%, buff ESS to compensate.  The ESS is a good mechanic and promotes small gang.
---
* Increase cooldown on fighter MWD to 3-5 minutes
---
This is pretty minimal dev effort to significantly improve the game.
---
Except for the fact that winning is fun. Thus, we optimize to win.
---
You would THINK that.
---
Here you go
---
https://www.thonky.com/eve-online-guide/faction-standing
---
That wasn't my point though. The goal of a game presumably is to get some form of joy out of it. If you lose sight of that goal and choose a playstyle that is "efficient" but prevents you from fully enjoying the game you are already handicapping yourself.
---
I think it might be useful here to add in what actually happens to small/mid alliances (even blue donuted ones) when they get hit by these attacks. Dran's analysis is both useful and enlightening in showing us how the major alliances respond to these assaults, but what actually happens when these Drifters spawn on someone like, say Brave?
---
Prior to the Drifter assaults in Catch and Impass yesterday Brave had the following on their plate. A corp in Brave had assaulted and taken FRT adjacent SOV in Scalding Pass. FRT had wisely reffed the ihubs and TCUs. The defense was at or near USTZ prime, right up our alley. Appx. 5 to 7 Simple Farmers structures had been dropped in the metro GE area and were up for final anchoring beginning around four hours prior to downtime. Like most alliances, our AUTZ is a little thin so we needed a good form to contest these structures. As always, roaming gangs come through Catch in search of content. Off the top of my head a Goon Jackdaw fleet rolled through, our old friends from DEQC paid us a visit, and two other wormhole gangs showed up while I was logged on.
---
So when the drifters showed up, all hell broke loose. Because of how folks get notified of structures being hit works (as Dran discusses a bit) if no one with access to those roles was around to notify line members, stuff just got put into armor. In Impass, our more active players essentially did as Dran described and got into caps/supers and dropped on what could be located. Many of these threats were neutralized but obviously some were missed. When folks when up to Scalding Pass to defend timers, things got really hairy in Catch. At several points we made the decision to avoid PVP because of the uncertainty around drifter engagements. 
---
In an amusing coincidence drifters ALSO spawned up in Scalding Pass, more or less third partying on the sov wanding that was going on up there. By the end of what I'd consider our prime time most folks were totally burnt. When the timers rolled around for anchoring SF structures people had had enough of Eve for the day. As a result we were unable to contest them, though a few noble souls tried their best. It's worth noting here that the Drifters essentially threw an assist to Simple Farmers, one of the most prolific structure spamming entities in Eve. So for those of you hoping this would curtail structure spam, that actually worked in reverse this time. No judgement here, btw, Simple Farmers gonna do their thing. 
---
If this version of the event, or even one similar to it, were to become persistent I've no doubt we'd improve in our response but it still wouldn't be sustainable. Brave flat out isn't large enough and its players not spread across enough time zones to both engage them and do null PvP. You may hate on Brave however you wish in the comments below. Bottom line is I'm still pretty excited about all this, but if it persists at or near its current levels, Alliances the size of Brave are going to have to make some hard choices. 
---
*Disclaimer - I am not a member of leadership and I make no official representation of the opinions of Brave Newbies. My observations and experiences are entirely my own.
---
or my encounter the other day, leshaks
---
until the hand of Pearl Abyss says "Hey, fuck the role players.  Do you want a role player named Mittens, who doesn't even contribute a DIME, or play the game, threatening to piss on your game? I have a ton of Koreans and care bears who would love to play. They just can't because you have these role players holding your balls.  Oh, and we have money that they don't."
---
CCP thinks, then says "Fuck it. We're tired of dealing with this shit for 16 years.  Fuck the Goons, and fuck reddit."
---
I once made a similar analysis of the characterhours required to take a completely undefended adm 2 region. Then I wished I wouldn’t have done the math because I ended up grinding it anyway. I’m so happy I’ve quit this shit game tbh.
---
Try r/evejobs
---
&gt;just time wasted into the rewardless effort tax of the drifter event.
---
The reward is not losing your structures/miners/ratters
---
Wormholers shouted loudly when ccp decided to make day to day life somewhat worse and labeled them as "unwilling collateral damage". Seems ccp's take away was 
---
* Don't call them collateral damage
---
* Don't tell them beforehand
---
* Make it hugely impact day to day life
---
I should have said "ALL PvP content" since solo and smallgang is already on its knees.
---
Maybe one day again, but for  now lets just go back to mining and building
---
I like these points
---
I don't disagree with you, it's dumb that people will optimize the fun out of a game, but the reality is that they will, and it doesn't take many to ruin it for everyone else.
---
Noone asked you querns, this isn't about you bee guys for once.
---
Quote by Dran: 
---
&gt;empire builders think the state of the game sucks too, don't worry you're not alone. I actively want changes that make my alliance's playstyle harder because it makes the game more interesting.  
---
So as it stands it seems how they're playing now doesn't seem to be the most fun way for them
---
I usually play with my tactical overlay on and it is fairly easy to spot another ship coming on to grid when you're zoomed out and watching the screen. Using only the overview I can see how it would be. 
---
&gt; Yeah that does seem to be the goal of the system, the problem however is that nothing can escape it, no bots, no humans either, which is why i said it that if ccp intends this to be completely impossible to escape it, they might as well cut out the middleman and just introduce a base flat 10% chance of insta death the moment you warp into an anom, because that's how frustrating this mechanic is going to end up being. 
---
I can see what you're trying to say, but just insta-popping in site is an even sillier idea. The Drifters fit in to the current lore, and the way they are set up now plays in to the story arc while still accomplishing the game mechanic it appears they were designed for. 
---
I can understand the frustration given the amount of time nullsec ratters have been able to rat in almost complete safety due to the intel systems many have in place. This new system circumvents all of that. The way Eve works, you can write tools to parse information from local, d-scan, the overview, etc. If CCP were to allow any of those to provide any sort of advanced forwarning, the botters would exploit it and it would be pointless. Same goes for alliances and their intel tools. Someone would just write another tool to detect them and ping warnings. The whole point of the Drifters seems to be to get around all of that. 
---
Maybe this means that there are no real good counters for players at the moment. Given that botters try to run round the clock though,  I believe this will have more of an impact on them than an at the keyboard player. PLayers are obviously going to be collateral damage, but I would rather lose a few ships than to let Eve continue down the path it is currently on.
---
Or just make it all hisec and fw so all conflict is either by war Dec or by joining the militias
---
I don't know who or what that is but it's definitely a feature I was surprised wasn't available.
---
well, noone has a adapted to them yet...
---
The number of structures is still from the "no danger out there" times. Same goes for ratters, haulers etc. That is simply no longer the case. And we gotta adapt to that... 
---
-have proper scouts for hauling ships again. 
---
-Clear "ratting" systems before starting to rat. 
---
-Consolidate the structures and systems down to "essentials"
---
These systems would prevent a lot of stress.
---
On the other side, the drifters create timers. Timers an attacker can followup, with much less defensive preparation capabilities for the defenders. And that means that suddenly, a sotiyo can be reinforced into hull. With only 1 timer and a surprise attack from the attacker.
---
Does it change the oppressive character of defensive citadels in pvp/wars, or the uncounterability of supercaps? No, it does not. But it adds some danger. And it lowers the ADMs, isk faucet, ore faucets, etc.
---
Nullsec Blocs are crying, because suddenly their way of life is changed. But that is not necessarily a bad thing for Eve. Preventing the old style of highsec pirates was shit for them too, but it was utterly necessary for Eve as a game!!
---
btw, I AM a nullsecer, in such a bloc
---
very nice analysis!
---
nice, they are doing gods work
---
from my perspective.
---
i have defended 9 fortizar/azbel/etc structures solo (no alts) 
---
it took me 2h to defend these 9 attacks using the leat optimal setup possible. bombs only.    if ur citadel is actually properly fit up (or hell if it has 2 webs/web burst/dromi x1)  it takes u 3 minutes or less to nuke the timer and then move on. 
---
when i did this i was very sub optimal bc i had to wait to be notified of shit being attacked by esi so it took me all over back tracking. i also used a bomber to move about and after every single kill i looted the field as it was about 20m from the 3 ships combined.   my isk/h doing it sucked at 50m/h but hey if i had fighters it woulda been cake. (i had 1 citadel with such fighters and it was 3 minutes from start to warping off with my loot)
---
Don’t mind the New Players, few of the old ones are leaving coz its not fun anymore
---
Status for EVE now "uninstal" ELO !
---
First off, Pandemic Horde is not a great example of eve pvp. They're general big disorganized standing fleets or anchored f1 comps. There's a lot more to it than that, especially for two guys. Faction warfare or nullsec/wormhole hunting, kiting, or just yolo brawling stuff is very different, and can be a lot more individually challenging. For ISK making you can hunt clone soldiers and mordu's rats while looking for trouble.
---
That aside, possibly DED site ninjutsu, dangerzoning into nullsec to run combats, or joining a null entity to moon mine?
---
Highsec has trigs now they are like sanshas on crack with fancy ships
---
how 2 be bigbrain lik u?
---
There was also that restront kiting mechanic that totally shoved a pitchfork up the defenders arse. Defenders hate it when that happens
---
I'm honestly surprised this is being so positively received here, where people hate every idea posted. It seems to me like this would be incredibly easily "gamed"/abused and people would find it necessary to do things like group up for "shoot each other" parties where they just sit on a citadel or safespot and shoot/ewar/repair each other to gain more SP.
---
I feel like if that was the case, they'd have come back after timers and followed through.
---
&gt; Even if the drifters only turned up every 3 months or so for a couple of weeks it would be great for the game imo.
---
Would it? Because once people get the rhythm down it doesn't really do anything besides drive people away.
---
Like, sure, the first time it'll make blocs inhabit space relative to their size... and the second time?
---
They'll just be incredibly annoyed, lose a random handful of structures, and weather the storm. At worst people will just adapt to packing up and retreating to ~safe space~ every time the drifters pop out, with the myriad line members cursing the fact the game for them just STOPS every few months.
---
Thank you for giving me a laugh while dealing with this bullshit.
---
So it all comes down to you ruining the joy for yourselves so others don't do it at some point? That sounds pretty sad tbh...
---
brave complaining it cant blob something, this really is music to my ears.
---
"alliances the size of brave", you poor poor people :(
---
PVP in EVE?
---
God forbid
---
/r/evejobs
---
thats been happening for years, even more so these past 2, by now anyone left playing is because of friends or they are denying the state of it.
---
no joke, eve is a dead game
---
Lol that's a very general summation.  I wanted to see by how much, in actual numbers.  🤔
---
&gt;I can see what you're trying to say, but just insta-popping in site is an even sillier idea. The Drifters fit in to the current lore, and the way they are set up now plays in to the story arc while still accomplishing the game mechanic it appears they were designed for.
---
I'm not saying they should insta pop into the site at all, not sure where you got that from, them warping into the site is fine, the issue is that they have insta locking capabilities at a ridiculous range making it impossible for human player to react to it in time.
---
And again, i'd be fine with them being completely invisible until they are on grid with you. **IF** it was possible for a human to react to them. As it stands based on what we see and what we hear, it isn't.
---
&gt;Players are obviously going to be collateral damage, but I would rather lose a few ships than to let Eve continue down the path it is currently on.
---
Players being collateral damage is a dangerous consequence for a game that can't seem to be attracting enough players to replace the people quitting.
---
lul im elite roleplayer btw
---
Plenty. I just thought I was responding to a question about PVE, so I answered about PVE.
---
Uh huh.
---
You won't ever get a sensible response. They want to paint a worst case scenario for it so they can argue against it. Just another attempt to spin it and try to convince CCP to get rid of it.
---
&gt; it's dumb that people will optimize the fun out of a game
---
WTF ARE YOU TALKING YOU ARE LITERALLY ONE OF THE #1 PEOPLE IN THE GAME DOING THIS
---
I think the state of null demonstrates that the overwhelming majority of players refuse to play suboptimally.
---
not exactly. you have to get your fighters there first.
---
Nice try, but you're off topic. The particular subthread is about drifters appearing on top of PVE ships in anomalies. Which would certainly affect the expected isk/hr as, as you noted, they don't give meaningful loot. (And, as you didn't note, they blow your PVE ship up.)
---
Who is in lowsec to complain? Do you even play this game anymore?
---
That sounds pretty unfun
---
show me the numbers then
---
They will fuck you up. And you will like it.  
---
They also pod. 😘
---
I assure you I'm not as important as you think I am.
---
CCP Falcon is the lead community guy.
---
I know I'm tinfoiling , but I have a hunch they are testing Ai on eve , then will sell or implement it on other pearl.abyss games
---
I mean, it’s eve, it’s a second life. If you’re not allowed to afk to some extent, it would ruin the game for thousands. You can’t just combat-isk for 8 hours a day. And besides, it doesn’t give you nearly as much isk
---
Local chat delayed Constellation Chat immediate imho.
---
Most people in Lowsec wouldn't give a single fuck about it unless those fuckers decide to get into plexes and fuck up our pvp fights.
---
Believe it or not, idgaf, but that's how things are.
---
I get it botting is a problem but when you cant do your normal day to day play and always look over your shoulder but if thats CCP’s fun then daily log in’s will drop from ~25k to ~10-15k at best
---
when i first saw the incursion. i was like "oh yay more intelligent AI that act a bit more like players and will clean up some of this citadel spam"
---
after fighting them...i realized its nothing like that.  and its essentially just a forced attention demand T.T
---
not even any isk.  only benefit is security status...
---
"more" shit
---
Started playing three months ago, and just started seeing INN, so yeah, it took me about a minute.  Sorry it took so long.
---
They don't reinforce every structure in every system, nor at the same time. Really, you need to stop twisting numbers.
---
&gt; If you look at drifters killboard they have been getting an average of 120 kills per hour since downtime. Before downtime it was like 1 kill per hour.
---
Jesus O.O what tech do they have and as anyone managed to capture a Drifter ship ?
---
Trig's are limited in where they are and you can just stay away and move to any other highsec constellation you can freely go to.
---
Trig's won't be equal until they can appear in ever highsec system with no UI warning so you don't know they are in system.
---
Thank you. I answered your question perfectly. Don't see why you keep posting. That's really annoying. I literally proved you wrong and you can't accept it and move on. Embarrassing. As for removing local. It's called wormspace. Why force your game style on everyone else? Sound familiar? Hahahaha. 
---
I'll be waiting... I fully expect some more whines. I look forward to them now. Seeing how easily your panties get bunched up.
---
I mean yeah, i didn't say you're alone with this, you just seem to be the first high ranking null spokesperson (or however you want to call it) that publically voiced an issue about their own gameplay course like this (or at least the first i noticed anyway).  
---
Maybe i am just naive but if someone has a problem and the power to do something about it i don't understand why they expect someone else (CCP in this case) to do something about it instead.
---
Spamming d-scan.  2019 MMO gameplay.  
---
Genius.
---
...and yet some in game create their own political bullshit.   That's the point.  Some of you just moved the bullshit to a game.
---
If you scroll up a bit, you'll notice that my ideal is almost the same as yours. I'm not sure I buy the "entirely", but I want the players to drive the game. You'll also notice that I contrasted two alternative states: random death and perfect safety, and I stated that if given *only* those two options, I feel very strongly in favor of random death. If you disagree, that's your right, and I sincerely hope CCP ignores you.
---
What I assume is actually going on is that you don't think you were living in perfect safety. You would be obviously technically correct, but I believe you would be incorrect in the spirit of things. I'm not really sure how to discuss this, as it's an argument about facts but also relies on a shared understanding of how safe is *too* safe that I don't think we have.
---
My point is that if you thought the danger was properly balanced, of course you're mad at the introduction of random death. Since I thought the danger was absurdly low and the ability of me as a player to give you danger was absurdly restricted, I'm cheering for random death as a bad option that is way better than the previous status quo.
---
Goddamn it you made me imagine a game so much better than the current that I don't even want to log in.
---
I've been flying nothing but slashers and rifters in FW lately, sub-5mil fits as often as I can.
---
It's good fun when you and 2 other similar fits gang up on something: https://zkillboard.com/kill/77613165/
---
The reeeeing and thrashing about didn't work, so now we get all kinds of worst case scenario numbers trying to make the point about why CCP should get rid of Drifters. 
---
I don't see any small corps/alliances making huge posts about how terrible it is for them. Mostly just Goons and TEST. That means it gets a +1 from me because it's obviously accomplishing it's objective. 
---
Let see, so far I've seen several logical fallacies used to try to argue about the Drifters:
---
* Ad hominem
---
* Appeal to ignorance
---
* False Dichotomy
---
* Slippery Slope
---
* Red Herring
---
* Appeal to Authority
---
* Equivocation
---
* Bandwagon Fallacy
---
* Appeal to Pity
---
Wow, I think I have logical fallacy Bingo
---
If a large proportion of null players decided to go alpha for the month the drifters would be history before the next downtime.
---
Alpha for August!
---
Yeah really nice. So i dont even need to think about loggin in so i can hunt magic beasts with my wizard friends. See you after this shit
---
They don't need to to get the affect people are talking about.
---
Null coalitions will actually have to think about putting down structures in far flung areas.
---
When I read your post one question comes to my mind: for what do you want more isk?
---
It won't be test's fault. This shit is pulling all of us in nullsec together. The blue donut -- the actual blue donut, not the watered down bullshit that subhumans use when describing "organizations I don't like" -- is imminent, and it's all thanks to CCP.
---
You know what is also not fun and engaging? Wormhole logistics. Getting suicide ganked in highsec. Having supers camp you in your FW station.
---
We got "Deal with it", "Get better at the game", "Make more friends" and "Just move". 
---
Where in the game description does it say "I have a right to live in nullsec easily", where "only players should be able to threaten me"? If you sandbox is filled with water you don´t run crying to mommy, you start building sandcastles with the wet sand dripping from your hands.
---
Is this invasion the best way to do something? Definitly not. But a part of me even wants to say nullsec, the players and CCP, broke the game. Maybe breaking nullsec will help fixing the game. Maybe a better nullsec will rise from the ashes, a nullsec where players have fun doing hard stuff, a nullsec where players have fun shooting each other.
---
Ofc this is phrased way over the top.
---
We also killed his Charon, he yelled at us a ton and was very proud when he rolled our WH when we were roaming, calling it a victory for him and that he had defeated us.

9 to go
---
Have you paid attention to what the threat is like?
---
It is exponentially more difficult with the size of the controlled area and number of structures.
---
N^^x
---
Think your comments through please.
---
You could still do wormholes, just don't bother with the PI because PI is straight up horrible. The 2 of you could farm out of your static and just roll it when it's dead, that's pretty good ISK - comes with a bit of risk, of course.
---
C2-C3/HS is a very common "starter" option if you still want to do C3 stuff, but you might be too experienced for that now. 
---
But you could also just get into C5-C5 (can roll with a carrier) or get some funky WH like a C4-C5/C2.
---
what is that
---
you sweet summer child.
---
Back when i started. CPP spawned huge fleets in highsec and wrecked people.
---
They can do what they want. go play WOW
---
I'm tempted to say that a good setup for doing both isk and PVP (not disorganized standing fleets or pushing F1 in fleets) would be to join a FW Militia and go on combat fits to plex on the same system, giving eachother support when people come to get a fight.
---
Misattributed to The Mittani, but was said by previous goon leaders.
---
thnx brav
---
:middlefinger:
---
Indeed. Doesn't need to be true to be a meme :)
---
&gt;they do 6k dps, so we need 25 guys in subcaps with logi working together  to deal with them... or one capital alt
---
This event is pretty obnoxious but I hope CCP is using it to learn something about the state of the game.
---
mate honestly you must just not have been online when I was roaming or you definitely would
---
Game is too safe due to local, remove it
---
I just rareley visit low cause why should any reasonable Person be there?
---
But i Heard of some insane liking to torture themselves by living there and dreaming of an empire they only can Forge in null truly
---
It's "limited" to t3cs with equivalent tank and dps and strats. I honestly don't think there are any good reasons.
---
And I still don't think the carrier comparison holds up. You may as well compare a blops to a titan.
---
It is that shit
---
The novice cheese is so stupid, even legitimate FW corps like DHSJ will double whatever is at the novice site
---
That’s what Trig invasions are.
---
Shitposting on reddit works.
---
&gt; What are some things that two players could get into, that preferably scales well?
---
sex
---
Faction warfare
---
The vocal nullbears on here are nothing but hypocrites.
---
"Capitals are large and expensive and deserve to be OP"
---
While also ignoring the same principle with Marauders and Battleships.
---
Get capital blobbed to death in every roam or strategic engagement:
---
"Just seed Dreads. Get more friends, adapt or die scrub"
---
Now they actually have to defend things and deal with an OP mechanic to deal with citadel spam that THEY inflicted themselves:
---
"Waah, the game and player base is unfair, dont tell us to adapt to unfair and punishing mechanics!"
---
What is your real name then? Trosty Furtle?
---
The minute Drifters pops one of their structures they'll be sperging about that too
---
Well, it's sandbox, be surprised, but some people like making money
---
\- Firetail is perfectly fine. Sadly comet with its great tank great dps and great fitting is too strong thus replacing firetail in most roles. Thanks to all that the only viable lowse firetail fit is dual web arty.
---
\- Dramiel is perfectly fine as well as both AC and arty platform. Great for catching kiters too.  It has decent dps but also very fast, small sig and easy to mitigate dps if you pilot well.
---
\-  Worm is all but unkillable solo in novice plex.
---
\-  T1 destroyers are not popular not because they're bad but because AF with adcu makes them obsolete ( I won't even mention command dessies like magus which can tank 600-1000dps). 
---
\- Small projectiles are just fine its medium autocannons that are a meme.
---
Yes as did I when I stole it from someone who posted this in another thread.
---
I like the tri-ality of it.
---
Enemy ship shows up. Die fast. Check kill report. Enemy is using drones that cost 50m isk.
---
Doesn't sound very optimized.
---
Optimized would be only responding to important attacks in systems you care about.
---
Important to note things have changed since that video released. Some of the info is still accurate, but not all of it.
---
Local for first 10 seconds you're in system.
---
Bam done.
---
Yeah, you have to figure the game out before you just blindly press whatever buttons FC told you to without knowing why you are pressing it.
---
&gt; Wormhole logistics. Getting suicide ganked in highsec. Having supers camp you in your FW station.
---
All done by other *HUMANS*
---
Working as intended
---
The ui warning comes from concord's constant scouting and Intel collection.
---
DHSJ is not a legitimate facwar corp lol, they're mostly gankers / blopsers. I've gotten everything from great battleship brawls to supers dropped on a solo battlecruiser out of DHSJ.
---
The basics would be that his calculations aren't based on surviving, they are based on staying the same size.
---
A size that likely isn't justifiable.
---
One doesn't have to defend 170 systems constantly.
---
Even his calculations are literally just have less than 1 person per held system online and able to help at all times.
---
Drifters and bots! A lot of nullsec players are bots!
---
Welcome to pve
---
A lot of shit
---
The ai thus far isn't interesting really, and other pearl abyss games are so totally not like eve it wouldn't be transferrable.
---
But these bots kill anyone, you have no chance alone. Nobody can transport something, rat or mine. If u want nothing more than bots in null, stop this madness
---
Another idea: have a set of default overviews that aren't complete garbage and are kept updated.
---
CCPlz
---
Well, goons never finished the job and only took like 10? systems and a couple keepstars.
---
Rifters are fun af. Slasher I've been curious about flying again, now that I'm not a newbro. MWD AC slashers are REALLY scary in groups and sometimes people don't respect it because "lol its a slasher".
---
You running the AC rifter, or trying to arty meme? I've had a lot of fun with the overdrive arty rifter lately. It's hard to ram people when everybody and his dog has blasters.
---
Sounds like it would easily be manageable to have at least 1 person per system held ready to defend within a few minutes.
---
That doesn't sound too bad
---
We roamed last night. No drifter issues here.
---
This. I started out in small nullsec gangs, got into big F1 comps, then got back to small nullsec gangs. It's way harder, and the rust _HURTS_ right now, need to learn a million things and lose a million nomens lol
---
was a very cringy thing to watch with those mjds.   
---
People gave you a nice, even gank - you probably blinged that mega a lot though which made them underevaluate, otherwise two random fit proteus should've done you in hard at 0 range.   
---
That confessor getting in grapple range, etc, oh man this was a very lucky find :)
---
Yeah. As I said, not perfect. But since players aren´t doing jack maybe CCP has to pick up the slack
---
Their resists are literally shown in their descriptions now.
---
Pretty decent Thermal hole in shields. 0 EM resist on Armor. 0 resists at all on hull.
---
Rogue Drone/Sleeper mass invasion of lowsec next CCPls.
---
It's only insane pressure if the alliance holds far more space than it can handle.
---
From many accounts the defense is actually pretty easy.
---
It's only the fact that more systems exponentially increase the logistical overhead that make it difficult.
---
Abyssal is a nice set up.
---
or if you got time, training into one of the starter incursion fits for Warp to Me
---
The design has changed.
---
So reoptimize.
---
Less stations.
---
I've spent around 3 hours ratting in null yesterday without a single problem. Just avoid systems with drifters and stop bitching.
---
Adapt or die.
---
In very limited scope games, definitely.
---
The more freedom you give players, they more likely they will optimoze the fun out of the game.
---
And here they are dealing with it.
---
i got a bottle with me please use it to store your tears.
---
Sounds like you should have less structures.
---
So start taking down the stations you don't want to defend.
---
K
---
I hate my shitposting
---
Afk ratting/mining. 2019 MMO gameplay. 
---
Timers would all come out the same time, following the suggestion of letting them reinforce everything.
---
Does not protect other rorqs so generally this is not considered to be a terribly useful function.  Will protect other barges on the field but they will just get insta-popped the moment they leave PANIC by any whaling fleet and I believe they cant warp off while under PANIC shield? Need someone to verify that.  Any reasonable Rorq driver will active tank until their tank is about to break, hit PANIC and prep to active tank again when it drops, thus generally all the other things that would have been saved by the PANIC are either dead or warped off anyways.
---
How would it flush isk out?
---
If anything, it's adding isk. Insurance payouts are an isk faucet.
---
Oh come on, i barely even log in! Can’t ruin my game!
---
You will sooner or later. I hope ur in a scap for more pain for these words
---
The Driftani
---
Good. I've been looking at getting out my destroyers which haven't been doing much besides salvage since I trained cruisers because of the same issue. I'm on the killmail for someone else finishing the job often enough that I am ISK positive overall for my solo excursions on ZKB, but I would prefer a reasonable fight.
---
You don't need one person in each system, you only need a handful of useful nerds with ceptors and somebody with access to the citadel aggression notifications
---
They do.
---
Let's see how long you guys will last before burning out. That's the whole point.
---
Every time new things are added they aren't added to active overview settings.
---
Can you confirm this is actually missing on a full fresh overview setting or only those you already had?
---
Cool writeup, good read. 
---
What do you think CCP would have to do to 'fix' the backfire that this may become?
---
How common is it for there to be unpowered structures in Null-sec systems that would be the primary target for the Drifters instead of them being random?
---
Also, what are your thoughts on the idea that structures should have to be anchored to celestials (ie. XLs to Stars, L to Planets, M to Moons)? And/or drifters target structures not in these 'anchors'?
---
DELET LOCAL AND CITADEL SPAM
---
SPAI
---
inb4 a captcha every time you initiate warp to a site
---
&gt; makes me wounder why the drifters did not insta pop it
---
They ignore you if you mimic their orbits in a drone ship.
---
Attacking structures making lots of timers to defend.  Biggest impact is when Jump Bridges are put into reinforced it turns off the bridge on the first timer so this is creating a massive workload for empire logistics to fuel 30x more cap ships going through them than normal and replace the ones that will die (the unsung angels that make EVE possible are getting the shit end of the stick).
---
That's not quit what I said.
---
Just 1 person per system, not necessarily in each system.
---
Less really.
---
Even by this main posts bad math.
---
If you had 1 person per system, you wouldn't have to rely one a few people running all over the place, but instead people could do them just occasionally.
---
bind it to a button on the side of your mouse. its the best.
---
But you wont know if anyone is there after 10 secs.
---
Changing the game to make it more difficult for bots is quite weird. There is no possible way the "CCP option" has been exhausted.
---
Don't worry, I'll just adapt to the situation and if lose a ship I won't run crying to reddit vOv
---
I dont lost a ratting ship. But a pvp shit hunting chinese botters. And saw many innocent indu wrecks on my way. 
---
Lockrange 10000 tacklerange 150. Tracking 1000 dps 5000. Adapt that u retard
---
I like this. Except point 6, with cit guns
---
I think the wolf needs 3 more powergrid
---
local in jita is now 50,000
---
I’m trying to imagine titan skills. Would people just DD each other all day long in preparation of the next big supercap fight?
---
Shocked! Fought against and with him. We sledged each other but always in jest. Sad times. o7
---
We tried, believe me.
---
This. I like the feeling of amassing more wealth and stuff. He just likes playing the game in general so he isn't as picky as me.
---
Highly recommend staying in wh space. Youve experienced ns with horde. Unless you find an "independent" to join ns sucks. blocs are honestly bad for the game but nothing will change there.
---
Find a c2 or c3 do pi passively dont import shit just let it run for a week then move it. Importing is sure fire way to burn out. Look for another wh group if your current one is dying. Hs has a few ways to make decent money. Trading incursions mining abyss or invasions.. Thats about it. Oh ded stuff to. Most of that dosent scale with more toons tho. Mayne move up to c4-5 corp instead. 
---
If all else fails I have a small wh corp thats recruiting. C2-3-hs
---
Yes but npc stations do not exists in all of null.
---
Why is it always the hunters preying on the unprepared and weak who persist that their playstyle should be the one and only...
---
Seems like nulltards can't wrap their head around that tbh
---
Npc killing bots.
---
Poetic justice.
---
&gt; CCP, what problem are you actually trying to solve?
---
This right here is where you're failing, you are assuming CCP has a well defined plan to solve a real problem.
---
But have you considered the following options:
---
a) Drifter bullshit is just a stupid Invasion Expansion Event that's being badly received and will be on its way out next couple of weeks
---
b) CCP has no real plan to solve any of the problems everyone is crying about (blue donut, citadel spam, mega bloc having too much sov, etc) and is just throwing shit at the waal to see what sticks
---
c) CCP is fucking incompetent and is trying to solve an imaginary problem
---
d) This was originally a bug and now they're in too deep.
---
My money is on a mix of a and c
---
We were making a crazy amount of ISK with PI, that it didn't seem even worth to do the sites. Maybe a c5/6 would be more fun due to the harder sites?
---
Make sure you post any other ideas you have to reddit too, I think the wolf needs 3 more powergrid!
---
Cmon baby: Ya telling me The Mittani is something like a spinning hypocrit or something?! 
---
Iam like shocked! Shocked or something ...
---
You want to continue with VNI online?  Seriously?
---
Cry me a river.
---
azdaja was sansha nation i thought 0.o
---
You're just a lazy krab that want's easy ISK.
---
You don't need more than ten seconds on a roam to know if someone is there.
---
You probably are not the only one, there will be many more for who this is the point that makes them pull the plug. No more money from them flowing into CCP in any way, no telling how many accounts they may have had, or even what type of pilot they may have been. Doesn't even matter if they were solo player, high sec, nullsec, low sec, or whatever. In the end, more money that will never come back. I had a number of accounts subbed, I'm down to a bare minimum now, and not sure I'll continue. 
---
I don't rat or mine, I'm only here for the pvp and wars. Very little of that will happen now, and honestly having a war every 6 months isn't enough to keep me giving money to CCP when all it involves anymore is shooting some structures. I don't blame either side for that, that's CCP's design decision with how things operate. I'll just burn thru some isk I guess with skill training/farming online for awhile and hope that something gets better, but I don't hold out for much hope. CCP's track record isn't very good.
---
That could be a really good change for faction warfare.
---
So why you do?
---
I've been told that incursions are one of the worst activities to do, fun wise, but I'll check it out of you recommend it.  
---
Isn't Abyssal like a three player thing? Sorry for my ignorance on the subject, never tried it before.
---
Got it.
---
Add on to the meme shitpost
---
If you bothered to read, he’s showing how it isn’t sustainable for small entities. Big entities are having no problems adjusting and releasing best practices to other big entities. Please reread. He’s easily shown how it doesn’t scale for small entities.
---
I actually kind of enjoyed the time I logged in to scan down sites, do them, reap big rewards. People coming into local, seeing how far I could push it, then once they warped in site I’d warp off. That was thrilling and fun __for me__. For you, hunting may be thrilling. Imagine that, different people enjoying different playstyles. Now it’s always the same shit, log in because there’s a ping, roam around doing jack shit waiting for other people to warp to the gate, get blue balled anyway.
---
Like joining a FW corp or running it as a duo?
---
Awesome! 😁
---
I don't rat or mine.  They're extremely boring.  Thanks for asking.
---
Game mechanics are changing at a rapid pace with high orders of uncertainty...
---
* Assumption 1 - Structures refd by drifters wont get targeted on armor timers (not enough have gone into armor timers to say one way or another yet)
---
* Assumption 2 - Mechanics wont change arbitrarily next week or any time at random (assert that we figure out that they wont come back just for the armor timer, thats only something we can put stock into right *now)*
---
* Scenario 1 - Put in the hard work to stop the drifters from producing several timers across your space.  Risk burnout of players to defend your hardware
---
* Scenario 2 - Let things get put into armor timers, timers go uncontested and structures return to repaired (no way to know this is what will happen with things changing weekly)
---
* Scenario 3 - Let things get put into armor timers, drifters start showing up either at random or with a targeted intent to break your shit, and you have a narrow window to defend... what, 20?... 50?... 100? armor timers at the same time.  
---
Now what alliance leader would you go to with those 2 assumptions and ask them if they want to put vast quantities of their hardware on the line? Most/all will just suck it up and lots of people put in hard work to have the best chance possible of defending their space.... The organized players of EVE have demonstrated they will always rise to the challenge, especially when it's just sweat hours they need to put in.  Thats why many are calling this an existence tax.
---
It really sounds like you should be living in a wormhole.
---
lol nice
---
Semper Fi brother.
---
You will ultimately only know if someone was there.
---
I did that for a while, but I got tired of being lolpwned despite my V key getting some serious wear. Wormholers are too good :(
---
bro, it actually makes me cri erry tiem
---
484 structures 4.2 trillion in value all except 1 fortizar in tribute
---
Except they don't come back for timers, lol. Literally zero threat to goons
---
&gt; Without context this doesn't seem to be anything interesting. 
---
They ignored drone boats as long as you follow their orbit.
---
Is there somewhere you can see total monthly kills? June was definitely quite low, at least for goons/horde/pl etc
---
/u/olmeca_gold /u/innominate8 /u/killahwasp /u/vily_r 
---
thoughts as csm?
---
What's good Ron?
---
What you seem to fail to understand is that this is not 'content' that CCP has added, but a tax. An effort tax which puts a downwards pressure-incentive on structure count. The old balance was that an entire 1000 man alliance would base out of 1 or 2 outposts in null. CCP has implemented drifter attacks so that players have incentive to return to this old ratio of players to structure. Don't be a blobcuck, leave Test.
---
don’t worry broski, we will be there soon enough
---
This is CCPs effort tax which puts a downwards pressure-incentive on structure count. The old balance was that an entire 1000 man alliance would base out of 1 or 2 outposts in null. CCP has implemented drifter attacks so that players have incentive to return to this old ratio of players to structure. Don't be a blobcuck, leave Legacy.
---
No, not bad at all... one person per system, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  /s
---
You go with the Flow, Here is your free Triglav Carrier.
---
Did you mean CCCP?
---
Adapt retard
---
Seriously? So this vni+gila duo just simply anchored on the drifters and the drifters ignored them?
---
I think this is partially CCP testing AI out... so the AI might get better
---
\&gt;  Seriously? So this vni+gila duo just simply anchored on the drifters and the drifters ignored them?   
---
Yeah we were late to the timer because #reasons.  Then when we arrived on scene, ...uhh well, this is strange. They seemed to orbit and shoot citadel, warp off, orbit again and shoot citadel, warp off.  So we sent two drone boats to follow their orbits.    
---
When the citadel was killed though, aggro switched over to us.  We ran away.
---
"Outer Regions Fluid Router Security Under Scrutiny from CONCORD's SCC Division"
---
And here we go.
---
Everything is good. I've had a pleasant year. In game just enjoying the drifter invasion and laughing at the rage.
---
Or wormholes. Imagine if drifters spawned and chased players around system and camped wormhole exits.
---
I just want them to add a delay to local. Potentially tied to ADMs, maybe not... but definitely a delay, and add the use of chat scraping bots to the eula.
---
interesting.
---
Who care about local chat?
---
-wormhole dweller
---
clearly
---
*flashbacks of the fountain war book that never came to be*
---
Without local cant bots just be changed to constantly d scan? The same way people in WH have to?
---
Yes ten seconds ago, which is a good approximation of how long tackle takes to shotgun a belt
---
&gt; interesting.
---
Yeah my assumption is the aggro "tables" are just focused solely on this citadel. If drone boats aren't shooting at them and keep at a distance, that aggro table is solely focused on that citadel.
---
Which tells me, the CCP dev that made this, really hates citadels.  :)
---
There's a difference?
---
Warpins seem to be random
---
Just watch out for assault frigs. Your superior dps has a hard time competing against their tank.
---
&gt; especially flying down south and fighting on PFR's undock (4-CM8I) and fucking with their station services.
---
Every time I think about what part of my eve experience was the most fun, I always end up talking about fucking around on the 4-C undock. Although I was on the other side of that than you, it was super fun for us, even if we got shat on.
---
I never thought I'd miss station games.
---
yeah it seems to confirm the theory people have that the intended goal of these drifters is to reinforce and *hopefully* kill undefended structures.
---
Agreed
---
They’re just cute little newbees in (d)rifters.
---
The only way eve will get back to the pre 3 years of gay play count is if they start making the game more dangerous/risky and revive the prime newbie-vet content that doesn't require snooze 100 man fleets (fw and lowsec)
---
Bro, the feels....
---
/u/ccp_falcon i think this about sums up why nullsec is all mad. and how to fix the issues
---
Yeah. Also watch out for Kelon Darklight too. He roams the area. He can probably take down a Worm with a Heron.
---
i can sort of get on board with CCP's null drifter event but the fact the drifters dont reward people who kill them is a bit of a slap in the face.
---
if the only reason Drifters in null dont drop loot is that CCP didn't want to adversely affect WH economy perhaps Null Drifters should drop something different to their normal loot table. perhaps even loot / salvage the field and carry those items around as potential drops for the people who eventually kill them.
---
The rage about it ruining the game gives me life
---
A 25% bonus to the train time of x8 or x16, while fairly significant, probably isn't worth the cost of the doomsdays. You could maybe make that bonus provide diminishing returns, maybe by dividing it by the skill multiplier divided by two. So a x4 skill would provide a 12.5% bonus and a x16 skill would provide a 3.125% bonus. This would allow you to increase the bonus and make it more impact new players (who are more likely to be put off without it) than experienced players (who already have Patience V trained).
---
Not really. They aren't a threat to citadels for any moderately sized group, so they just pick off idiot subcaps and people ratting/mining without support.
---
You're still going on about that?
---
Ah a fellow trader
---
Goons have and the drifters are nothing more than an annoyance where we drop a few supers to kill fleets. I’m sure TEST has done the same as well. What he is talking about is that CCP has created something to widen the gap between goons and smaller alliances
---
Most of this is spot on.
---
I agree on structure timers. This would fix a lot of issues. RF timers coming out at the same time of attack. Defenders only choose time, not day. However, I think it should be 5-7 days for any structure. Having only 2-3 days to respond to a staging headshot is too much. Structure vulnerability timers should also be affected by ADM, but also the inverse for non-sov owners. maybe this can also be tied to the number of days the RF takes. Low ADM systems should be harder to defend and easier to attack. They should also increase the difficulty on higher tiers of ADM. Getting to 4-5 on indexes should mean the system has constant ratting and mining, not just one dude in a VNI. Maybe it could be a sliding scale vs the rest of the universe, kinda like industry taxes. So only the top 10% of NPC kills in the galaxy get to have military ADM index at 5, same for mining. 
---
Another idea for structure timers is to allow reps, which are also capped up to the same DPS cap, and massively increase the automatic repair time. This allows an attacker to sweep a region of timers without having to keep a token force pinging all the structures they want to kill. It also allows the defender to sweep and repair against harassment and shorten the time vulnerable across the board. Any reps should work for balance reasons. This would also allow a defender to keep a structure alive against suicidal forces, as long as they have reps. This allows fights to happen in situations where currently the defender has no chance to save the structure, even if they match the attacker in power and numbers.
---
You act as though wormholers wouldn't love the opportunity for our space to be even harder.
---
1) Upwell 3.0
---
i. I agree with the problem but i think just 2 timers on all citadels would be too much and here is why. If your staging keepstar is being reinforced right now you can fight on the armor timer and you still got a chance of disengaging and saving your caps for another day (take x47 as an example). If you only have the structure timer the risk would likely be too high that you get camped in and trapped and it would not result in more dead ships but in a fight that never actually takes place.
---
My suggestion would be: Medium structures (Astrahus/Raitaru/Athanor) get reduced to 2 timers while the others keep 3 BUT the armor timer is a stront timer. This way it would give the attackers incentive to hit structures in the defenders timezone (since it would most likely be stronted for out of timezone reffs) and therefore giving the attackers incentive and ability to defend on the initial reff already since they obviously don’t want a bad armor timer. 
---
ii. I agree.
---
iii. I agree.
---
iv. I think 25 minutes is totally fine. The idea is that the defenders should have time to react and keeping the DPS up on any structure for 15 minutes is probably a bit too easy.
---
v. Minor problem but i tend to agree.
---
vi. Absolutely agree and I have actually brought this up a few times and brisc presented it to the csm even. I believe it’s fine if they get their defenses as soon as they lost 10% of its shield and are in repair mode (paused or not paused).
---
I also don’t think beacons or bridges require citadel cover anyway. Oh and yes doomsdays shouldn’t activate on subcaps (let them bounce onto subs… that’s fine).
---
vii. Yes another way to poke ppl and create content but im not sure if the dev time needed for it isn’t more useful somewhere else. Certainly wouldn’t complain.
---
viii. I think passive moon mining should be limited to lowsec.
---
ix. Yes and i think it doesn’t even require a ton of fatigue either. Just a little that adds up and makes you wait a minute or two or if you take a titan bridge first its 5min and so on.
---
Yes at the very least let hic points prevent the jumps...
---
I would like to add that i think ACL based bridges in general should be removed. If you are in the alliance - fine. But if you are not then you don’t get the benefits of their space. It’s one of the many little things that support massive coalitions and massive coalitions are bad.
---
x. Uhm okay… little bit of a dreamer but i can see it and i agree that the biggest problem atm are the missing content creating opportunities. The escalation chain has to start somewhere.
---
2) Aegis 3.0
---
i. While i agree that timezone tanking is bad for the game i don’t think too short reff times and potentially out of tz timers are better. It would swing a little too much towards harassment probably.
---
iv. I would love to see the security of a system go up over time if there is a lot of ratting going on. That way it would get a more “natural” balance.
---
4) Umbrella Mechanics
---
i. I agree
---
ii. Sure why not.
---
iii. Gotta make sure its not the return of the T3C blobbs though.
---
iv. I still think a 10sec local delay would be best but i take anything that fucks with bots obviously. The infinite point towers also hit on players tho and seem a little strong of a change.
---
Section 3:
---
Im still observing at this point and im not entirely sure what to think of this drifter stuff.
---
CCP any story or lore to come with the Drifters ?
---
Good, burn it all
---
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done.        
---
Praise Bob!
---
But I groups as large as test and goons, every system matters. Some for ratting and mining, some as strategic entry and defense points. They attack athanors which are typically on rented moons and part of that rental is protection. Sit down if you don’t understand how 0.0 works in the slightest
---
Btw you can just use like 2-3 supers to defeat them so you won’t get burnout
---
How many people from any of those alliances do you see posting at all? They don’t have much presence on Reddit either way because they just have so few people. If you wanted to know how they actually felt you’d probably have to fly over to Provi and ask in local
---
So you adapt it to what "your" needs are and thats it. Not sure why anybody else would agree with that.
---
they could, but ships can also cloak and combat recons are immune to dscan.
---
And against all odds, it was SLYCE who first took advantage of the Drifter's Invasion offensively instead of crying on reddit.
---
Man, getting kicked out of GOTG/DeadCo. was good for you guys.
---
Found the guy who responded without reading the post
---
[https://clips.twitch.tv/SteamyRoughGrasshopperGingerPower](https://clips.twitch.tv/SteamyRoughGrasshopperGingerPower)
---
You act like the two are exclusive
---
Correct. However, our region curiously happens to be one with centrally-located NPC space. The handsome and intelligent person who decided we should live in Delve must have taken a possible future where asset safety was revoked into account when he chose it. The very people an asset safety nerf is intended to harm the most will suffer the least from it. Funny, that.
---
I actually swung by 4-C earlier this morning. Dead as fuck. The station is gone too. Feels bad man. It's owned by some chinese botters now.
---
people actually believe this lmbo \^
---
They do and it’s already easy to deal with
---
Yes they have
---
Traitor! You don’t belong in wormhole space
---
hmm, makes sense. Thanks
---
That wasn't Anti-Bot, it was Anti-everything and it was super dumb.
---
No, he isn't.
---
Nothing about his math scales down like that.
---
It gets exponentially easier with less systems and less stations.
---
His math only shows what their current set up requires. It isn't even optimized for their situation.
---
You can just join the npc fw Corp.
---
Ah come on you asked how to punish bots more than players.   You don’t like the answer?
---
So a team of 100 should be able to easily do a pocket of systems with no problems.
---
Clearly you don't understand the point.
---
If they think it's valuable, put in the work.
---
If you don't, let it burn.
---
Or are you trying to tell me that 100% of the citadel's are so strategically important the alliance would crumble if a single one died?
---
Sounds like that's the plan TBH.
---
Even though you can click on their info and it shows the exact resist profile on those ships that he just described?
---
Don't let silly facts get in the way of the narrative you're trying to spin though
---
Dying sooner or later is just eve.
---
It isn’t really an answer, though. Banning bots means *finding* bots, and from what I understand, that’s actually a pretty difficult proposition in EVE. I was asking to see if you understand the subject better than I do.
---
The resist profile is the same as what he just described
---
Pvp
---
The null alliances who lost stuff can mine to replace their stuff, they don't need to buy and sell PLEX to do so.
---
Thank
---
I liked your previous post much better. It was more objective and I could feel more confident about your conclusions even though you were unwilling to share your data (probably for perfectly good reasons).
---
Feels like you’ve been succumbed to your feelings on this one and I’m sure no one could blame you for doing so. I just don’t know that I can trust your conclusions.
---
You're literally getting downvoted for trying to help because it goes against the "Reee, they're too hard" narrative they're trying to push. Fucking sad
---
\+1 for an honestly helpful post
---
LOL Valk dont be so salty, I love watching Delve burn just wait a little longer
---
We don't ever worry about shooting in to resists holes, do we?
---
Unless you're the government, then it starts in September.
---
\+1 for the Contra Code
---
When running missions, you will only gain standings with the faction (Gallente) during storyline missions, which happen roughly every 14 regular missions. You can still do level 3 missions for the corporation you are running missions for when you get the required standing with the corp in question, you don't need it with the Gallente Federation itself.
---
God if this doesn’t tell you what’s up I’m not sure you would ever be able to see it
---
most ships are damage locked so it doesn't make a difference what the resist profile is of the target unless it's absurdly wonky.
---
not that it does any good in this case unless you're hitting out to 100km + which is considerably easier to do with railguns than beams.
---
Yeah ACL's are a mess.
---
Do you have access to multiple dread-capable characters? Even one would be enough, 250m for a Bastion (C5) and then 300m for the drifter you spawn.
---
Tinker Rattlesnakes are an easy low SP way to do the sites, dread is easiest to kill a drifter but it also works with a subcap setup.
---
What is the extremely specific situation you would use the Zephyr? I've been in wormhole corps for a while and never found a use for it.
---
For a 24/7 job in the real world, with 40h / week being about "full time" this is a bare minimum of 6 people, 8 ideally, per system. Now granted, it can be any toon and is eminently multiboxable. But again, that's only for structures.
---
You can't make nerds keep that kind of schedule over even a constellation. It's doable during prime time only.
---
Normally, you can ask in intel if there are any gatecamps, and that gets you safe 90% of the time. Now it just means you die to drifters trying to fly your dragoon back home
---
20% Thermal resist on shields and 0% EM resist on Armor is pretty absurdly low when you consider the other resist are 49%+. You'll be doing over 2x dmg at the very least with the proper dmg type. 
---
You're right though, it's not worth considering /s
---
That’s pretty common in online games. Automatic bans make it a lot easier for hackers to figure out where they screwed up that got them caught.
---
Maybe something like this:
---
Role bonus:
---
- Can fit Cynosural Disruption generator modules
---
- 50% bonus to armor plates and shield extenders
---
Interdiction battleships per skill level:
---
- 20% bonus to Cynosural Disruption Generator range
---
- +1 warp disruption strength for warp disrupters and warp scramblers
---
That with some racial bonuses depending of the ship and maybe the cyno disruption generator would stop any ship from being able to lock onto a cyno that is being disrupted. It would use scripts like a HIC and either have a short range bubble or a very long range single target disruption
---
EXACTLY. delve is the biggest problem
---
IKR. AFK ratting while watching Netflix sounds so much better
---
If this shit isn't over in a couple weeks, you'll see a lot of player quit temporarily or permanently.
---
You're elite sweetie.
---
Fighting an arty wolf in ab frig is hardly against the odds. Especially when they're kind to ram you.
---
Try using your tactical overlay some. It's easier to spot new ships coming on to grid and really isn't that hard. Staring at the overview too much will give you spergy tendencies.
---
Hardly but they might well have 200-250 strategically valuable citadels to protect. The bulk being athanors that are actively mined I would bet.
---
Nice analysis, though the actual numbers will have a large error, as zkillboard is our only source of the killmails.
---
zkillboard contains a neat feature at the top of the page, showing how many kills added in the last hour. Currently it is saying 1007 kills added as of now.
---
However, pulling the kills data from the ESI, the total ship and pod kills in the last hour has been 1740.
---
Caching will account for some of that difference, but the bulk of the difference is from zkillboard not being able to receive all killmails.
---
As a result though, there's likely an error of 20-40% in your actual numbers, but regardless, the analysis is great, and hopefully despite us only having access to a subset of the data, the ratios are the same.
---
considering hybrids are kin/therm, it really isn't as much of a big deal as you're pretending it is. especially, as i said, you have to actually hit out to that range for it to matter at all.
---
Whoa whoah whoah. Using common sense is counter to the narrative being spun here. I'm going to need you to repost with more sperg and less helpful information
---
what are you talkigna bout??? like... for me 70m its Alot... and if i cant go to an Anommaly bc Nothign shows up in my local or D scan and i get Instalocked and Insta Poded how am i Makign another 70m to replace? ANd why arent the Drifters in high Sec thers Plenty of Bots and Station makign Money in high Sec.... THis Shake up liek you put it... its Negative bc... Nulsec its Falling Hard.... ppl wil leave the game for a WHile some ppl will drop it Whole... new players wont Join the corps/Aliances and then you will ahve jsut the "war pvp" wich is Gate gamspa roudn Amarr and Jita GG.... Awesome good Old Day AMIRIGH!
---
Makes it easier to bash their shit
---
Damn it, i had to upvote NC.
---
Agree there will be missing data but will give good evidence of trends, and the ratio of actual kills in game to recorded kill in ZKB will hopefully be stable.
---
Well when you put it that way, yes finding bots can be difficult.  The most effective but time consuming way is to find a bot through player reports (that is the hard part-many are wrong or outright lies) and then observe them in the act.  
---
The less time consuming method (time spent per botter discovery that is) would be to detect the well known botting programs.  That however requires developer time to essentially write an eve specific tool, or even integrating the eve client with existing products like BattleEye.  They could squash it fast if they had the time or resources.  
---
Banning is simple.
---
Gud faits, Mihail!
---
Just part of your rationale being "I've got my paps for the month" is fucking sad dude. Go the fuck outside
---
How the fuck do you know what ccp intended? They haven't said shit. They have implemented a feature with so much potential in an incredibly stupid way. That's it.
---
&gt;blobcuck
---
I’m obviously not in legacy retard.
---
Make an alt and report your main as "offensive" or "impersonating".
---
It's telling that even though I don't agree with a number of your ideas I would be happy to see your proposed system wholesale replace what we have now. I think your point about station services and what Boat used to do is a really good one, how would you go out and generate a fight now if you wanted to? You can't camp a station, everything has a timer. Anyway I'm proud of you for bringing this one up because it goes against the narrative that Goons stayed dock during Casino War/WWB that was being passed around the last month when NCdot did that. 
---
I really miss the ability to go out and do something now. Like, anytime I want to have a fight I have to have a fight tomorrow. But usually I can't even do that. One thing I would like to do is drop offensive citadels but if I do that I have to wait 6 days. How TF do you generate a fight today?
---
It's an old joke, and I'm far from elite.
---
Do you realize that those two sentences directly contradicted one another?
---
Just because nullbears have settled on long range rails as the platform of choice, doesn't mean it's the best choice. That's the whole risk aversion thing where you're used to trying to outrange your opponent so you don't get hit.  Maybe a change in tactics maybe?
---
Ouch, I hope you weren't part of the p04 group I wiped the floor with early on. There were a few groups that came and went though, a lot of the time I didn't bother them too much.  
---
I miss Paradise. Was a good place to live.
---
I don't even login. Infact im not even subscribed anymore.
---
which bit of, orbits at 100km, going 3k/s, and can't be probed confused you in any way?
---
its true though
---
fucking weirdos....
---
Yes, but they don’t escalate or move like they do in wormholes.
---
Just coming back to the game and looking to try something new by going into industry.
---
I know research of a BPO matters for T1, does research matter at all if I want to focus on T2 since it is only through invention?
---
&gt; *vi. Upwell structures will only be able to use their weapons once in armor or a deep % of shield on the initial reinforcement, and during the final timer.* 
---
One thing you might do here is allow structure fighters to still be used at all times. Right now they don't do much, but they could be a useful way for structures to interact with an enemy fleet that is camping the station that attackers can still interact with. The biggest potential issue that I can see would probably be someone having a stack of fighters in there hanger thus giving them a near unlimited number, which would need to be accounted for.
---
So there's no way to get on top of them at all huh?
---
Oh look, only small entities are losing citadels. Not like this wasn’t predicated by /u/dran_arcana or /u/querns_gsf
---
Why? You might get banned 3 weeks after getting "caught".
---
indeed... i jsut went to High Sec No PVP... Boring Farming.... Hurray..... guess whos not Refreshign Subscription this month....
---
That wasn't his statement. He was pointing out resist holes to help with applied dmg. 
---
The AI is based on the same as what the wormhole drifters use. It's a little different, but they share similar behavioral patterns.
---
I imagine it would be a lot more annoying to deal with if the wormhole drifters dropped basically no loot.
---
I have one dread-capable character.
---
That’s fair. If the automatic ban was just implemented to act at some random point within a 3 week span or something, that would make a lot more sense.
---
&gt;perhaps even loot / salvage the field and carry those items around as potential drops for the people who eventually kill them.
---
That would be a fantastic idea and a great development for AI.
---
not easily, no.
---
I find the Socratic method a helpful tool of learning; by all means please please elaborate.
---
Don't forget your fedora on the way out.
---
People thinking I'm important doesn't actually make me important-- it just means i'm visible.
---
Didn't say it had to be easy. 
---
I'm glad you made that statement though, because it just reinforces what I've already seen. It has to be easy and require no effort or people are going to complain about it
---
LOL. I'd love to see THAT lossmail of shame
---
you're literally suggesting making it harder for yourself - which is absolutely retarded.
---
why would you try and get on top of them, when you can just shoot them from 100km?
---
I'll be sure to get that along with a big glass of all these salty tears
---
o7 to the last living solo PvP'er I've seen recently in Eve.
---
Also for more context, Drifters are an offshoot of the Sleepers, who are survivors of the Second Jovian Empire. Basically nullsec is being ravaged by Jovians or at least AIs using Jovian bodies.
---
Doesn't sound solved from all the whining
---
it was solved very shortly after they started appearing - just because it's solved doesn't make it a good addition to the game.
---
Admittedly, I havent done a deep dive into the data, but there appears to be an acute lack of rorquals and supers in their kill lists.
---
Given that the rorq/super ratting backbone is what actually gives nullblocs power, this seems to be a design oversight.
---
OP made it quite clear they are already adapting and dealing with it. But he also pointed out this will result in bleeding of smaller groups members into even more condensed large groups.
---
Thats when yoi gotta blow the ihubs up a d let them try and place more
---
MAKE IT BURN
---
&gt;Because fighting npcs as daily grind makes for a great game. Who needs pvp in an mmo?
---
I mean this is kinda what your entire alliance was built around the last 2 years
---
i tried downloading jeveassets but it came up as a folder. how do i install it?
---
I think people have found a way to do them. I don't know that it's the BEST way though.
---
well you certainly don't know a better way.
---
What you are describing will lead to your alliance failing before the drifters destroy a small alliance because they cant keep up with attacks.
---
Small alliances arent trying to keep up anyway, they arent babysitting structures, as you pointed out that would be impossible for them.
---
What causes more problems for who. A small alliance losing a structure every now and then or your large alliance no longer having those heroes able/willing to dedicate their time to defending your huge space. How long will the people expect you to protect remain your people if you cant defend them. 
---
Your only hope would be to do what your posts suggests "will" happen - convince those small alliances they cant keep up, and so they must join you, and hope they are your new "heroes" who will put in that work-week to protect your space.
---
I dont have a dog in this fight personally and your #'s seem accurate but your analysis of the human factor and what this could lead to seems flawed because of your bias(which is understandable!)
---
Frig/Cruiser/Battleship
---
Good luck.
---
Nothing worthwhile.
---
Goons had 20 something. It's almost like they actually prepped gunners instead of hoarding roles and then saying woe is me why is no one appreciating the work I'm doing because I refuse to expand the ACL to make things easier.
---
Regardless of opinions about the event, the fact a single alliance owns 7 regions and is complaining about how painful it is to defend it is gold. Maybe you shouldn't have 7 regions to yourself and should stick to something smaller. Let other alliances take the space around you and get some cool content nearby.
---
I remember a time when people let crappy alliances live not because they didn't want the space, but because it was easy content nearby. 
---
Since players aren't making it a pain for an alliance to hold 7 regions, CCP has to. At the same time, we probably wouldn't be in this predicament if sieging Citadels wasn't such a pain in the ass, and they weren't easily spammable.
---
&gt; They don't have cynos...could be fixed
---
Spodbrain over 9000
---
Might be hard to decide when to go back to the site without local. Might be easy to cloak a sabre up in the site and catch the bot on the warpin. But it's still no magic solution to the botting problem.
---
Can you explaining to me how it's exponentially and not simply proportional ? I think you're making that up.
---
Put that folder in Program Files and make a shortcut to jeveassets.jar, or just run that.
---
Make sure you have java runtime environment installed.
---
They were ok with Drifters 'ruining' other peoples' games, just not theirs.
---
gate cloak? not in local. invul from logging in, in the middle of space? not in local. could be so simple :)
---
I suppose an undocumented assumption was that the ratio of heroes to nonheroes is somewhat evenly distributed across successful alliances.  The supposition is that alliances that have less will have timezones that won't get covered, and therefore are more affected by an otherwise evenly proportional event.  I further surmise that larger alliances have more potential to consolidate than smaller ones to mitigate a longer event.  If a group of 15-20 guys has their proportional 1-2 heroes take a week off, they just lose everything, and all those nonheroes flock to larger alliances.  In these larger corps/alliances, perhaps some of them who previously we're busy doing space work or things that are required of every group (hr, services, etc) that there is a higher potential for those sorts of people to become heroes in larger alliances where they don't have to duplicate work anymore.
---
And they are killing other bots that were killing bots
---
So they are the good bots?
---
Lol. 
---
I love when he adjusted the direction of the camera and goes:
---
“Oh”
---
Doesn’t even look mad.
---
What sort of rewards do the minor and major conduits give in high sec? And is a fleet with comms etc required? Are there any in game channel other than the default invasion one, or groups in game that run them?
---
Albion online does a sov reset here n there. They might stole the idea n put drifters in for the twist.
---
Most of the default tabs (excluding the general one for sure) still don't have cynos added iirc.
---
&gt; I really miss the ability to go out and do something now.
---
This right here is my biggest problem with the game in a nutshell. Everything is deferred, everything takes longer, everything is predictable. Spontaneous content is being patched out of the game in obvious and subtle ways, and what's left is endless grind. 
---
The best you can hope for is that some clowns have put a jump gate on an unfit astra. Otherwise you're back to fighting a citadel. Great.
---
Ah yes all those poor small entities in nullsec trying to survive apart from the big coalitions. Poor guys! /S
---
Oh noes:(
---
This guy lowsex
---
These bots are playing the game better then most players though :)
---
They can be scrambled and tackled. Drifters go for the thing with the biggest signature radius and prioritize by sig radius. Look and see how drifters prioritize targets.
---
Still 2 regions short of burning the north though :)
---
My name is Helioof and I approve of this post. Just a shame like most things we bring up like this will get ignored by CCP.
---
Totally! Just two hours a week at a scheduled time to watch over a structure. Best yet, we get to pay monthly for the privilege! Oh, and we could have people on call for it, for the low cost of a subscription!
---
Act Now! Sign up to pay to do meaningless tasks today!
---
Try it out. Ask someone if they would like to pay you $15 a month to guard your dog from fleas for two hours a week.
---
Its a fair and accurate summarization of recent events.
---
you post like a nullmonkey mouthbreather, if you're not one then why do you care about this drifter event?
---
The dont call him 'Fucken Poster of the Year Wilmore' for nothing. Anyway I see through this obvious attempt at an early play to retain your crown.
---
Remove asset safety from unpowered citadels and give players a reason to clean up citadel spam.
---
This is a great post and if CCP had people who thought like this instead of listening to the zero-risk PVEers then EVE might be an interesting game again
---
remember that you need an athanor on every moon you want to mine, not just every system.  There are probably 700 athanors in test space alone.  That's how CCP designed null after removing pos moon mining.  I don't get what are we expected to do instead, just not mine valuable moons in our space over the last two years because at some point there might be an event where rats hit them 400 times a day?
---
Except, you did stay docked though...
---
The fact that DBRB was compelled to undock in order to monetize his gameplay via his Twitch stream doesn’t excuse the other 99% of the alliance that faffed around Saranen for weeks on the heels of not defending any of your timers post-CO2 “backstab”.
---
Do you really trust ccp to make a chat system change on this scale?
---
Working as intended. Soon only supers and rorquals can be used to make money per CCP design
---
Which disregards valid arguments from null players hut let's not let that get in the way of low grade memes :)
---
What makes you think I would share it? The tears generated from this are too good
---
the wreck of my sabre would be inclined to disagree. vOv.
---
Extracting skill points is not a way. You need 5.5 M skill points. The best option would be you getting a buddy program invite (by yourself). 1 M free skill points + starting skill points. You can then trade everything you have to your other self. 
---
So I would advise to make a new account with a buddy program. If u go Omega or you buy Plex with irl currency you will receive some rewards to your old account that you can then trade to your new account. 
---
You can keep the old account (a future alt for scouting / cyno / planetary interaction and a possible skill farm )
---
Given the way they behave in nullsec there is no reason to assume they wouldn't be able to. Everyone living in different areas of space thinks its fine because it doesn't negatively affect them. If all of highsec, lowsec and wspace were experiencing invasions on the level nullsec currently is each of those areas would be rioting like nullsec currently is.
---
it's a solved problem - the discontent isn't anything to do with the difficulty of the tedious task that has been laid out.
---
you guys do realize this is affecting smaller null entities waaaaay more than the big blocs right?  big blocs have teams that can manage this type of thing.  smaller entities do not.  this is annoying for large blocs...it is straining for the smaller ones.
---
RIP. Do you not have free sabres?
---
Yeah drifters don’t mess around.
---
Super interesting detail. Thanks.
---
Iirc they cannot be targeted by sleepers.
---
Absolutely not. We've heard the reasoning from null players. They're just not valid enough reasons to consider the drifters as bad for the game.
---
If you want sovereignty, you have to defend it to hold it.
---
A bed
---
A+C with a hint of D, which is why phase 1 seemed to end early last week.
---
No other areas of the game have to defend in this manner.
---
I'll be sure to try to signature tank my Keepstars in the future. What prop mod would you recommend?
---
To be fair it's more, my sov structure spam empire.
---
Thanks for setting up this community. In an old corp, a mate and I got talking. He was a veteran and going through some tough times.  The game served as a way to support him and really made a difference in both of our lives.
---
I love it!
---
2 leshaks can at damage cap :)
---
no single alliance holds 7 regions.  even goons own only 2 if you count the rental space in period basis. we own a bit in querious and a bit in fountain. bastion own space in fountain,a nd init the rest of it. init hold a little bit of cloud ring as well.  rest of querious is QFC. 
---
test is basically just paragon soul, feythabolis and almost all of esoteria, of which, i bet 2 are renter space.
---
Perhaps ccp should make it so you lose a million sp every day if you don't log in.  The reward of logging in every day would be not losing a million sp.  This would end the menace of SP farmers by making it too annoying to do and and bring older inactive players back to par with newer players if they ever played again.  It would be great and boost login numbers everyone will love it!
---
I did read, I’m just telling people how easy it really is to deal with them. Smaller alliances that can comfortably field those ships will probably struggle more or find a different way to deal with drifters.
---
It was SRP'd. 
---
they do not, my sabre died literally instantly - to the point where i was somewhat stunned and completely forgot that they also podded... thankfully it was a relatively cheap pod.
---
align out
---
I think I gave a sensible response to him
---
Then the fucktards will be the first to :surprisedpikachu: when EVE \*actually\* dies from their special olympics-level retardation
---
In a game like Eve, perception and visibility from the outside are really all that matters with respect to importance.
---
Dscan? Pilots in space in the past hour?
---
Needs a wizard's hat.
---
what is tracking?
---
&gt;level 1R3ubs01
---
Perhaps the plan is for this to be periodic to prevent the large blob alliances?  So if they want they can go ahead and expand again but only with the expectation that the drifters will come back in 6 months or 8 months or something to burn them back down. This would lead to, in theory at least, smaller alliances expanding only to the point where they know they can defend when the drifters return.
---
i mean, it's not like they don't know what we want - look how well tiericide was received... but instead we're getting stuff we didn't ask for and don't want instead of things we do want and absolutely loved.
---
i don't know how they are getting it so wrong so frequently.
---
In my experience "two random fit proteus" would bore Megathron to death with endless tanking and bad dps, but thank you for feedback.

if there was ever a lower-effort post...
---
Put fatigue back on Jump Bridges
---
Remove asset saftey from nullsec.
---
Scale upwell vulnerability window to ADM (like tcu/ihub), and remove the random timer, so RF comes out the same hour it was first attacked.
---
Allow reps on upwell structures, capped to the same as DPS
---
Remove vulnerability day selection  for upwell hull timers. 
---
Make anoms respawn across the region, not infinitely in each system. 
---
Buff the ESS, prevent anchoring in dumb places.
---
Buff dread jump range, or add more NPC nullsec systems, so that dreadbombs can reach all of nullsec from NPC null.
---
Buff mobile cyno jammers.
---
Limit upwell cyno jammer to 1per system
---
Buff battleship lock range and sig res
---
Nerf munin PG
---
Remove drone auto agression
---
Sure, but that requires a lot of organizing and can be defeated simply by logging out in a system and waiting an hour.

For most of the t2 I did I had a BPO researched and a BPO unresearched for each thing. The one without research was used for copying and inventing and the other used for producing the t1 version that is used to make the t2 item. 
---
This isn’t applicable for rigs though.
---
They did wormholes.  A custom local chat.
---
FW?  Shhhiiii I heard u was dead!
---
To some extend as you need the T1 item to build the T2 version. For invention itself you're correct and it doesn't matter.
---
I generally keep (a few) unresearched T1 BPOs for the T2 items I build and only research them if there's really nothing else I'd want to do with those slots.
---
Hello from WH
---
I love the details, but it won't kill small alliances. It'll make the larger ones consolidate and condense.  There will be a happy balance. It's not about the size of your alliance, it's about the space you hold and the space you most want to keep. Everyone now has to choose what is most important to them and fight for it. The eventual outcome will be all alliances holding smaller territory that they can effectively control. Leaving more lesser used space for other alliances to grab. All alliances in null should be planning their fallback zones now and organizing to defend them.
---
when it comes to primaring someone on the field, certainly.  When it comes to apparently singlehandedly being the downfall of eve I don't think perception makes reality.  I assure you if any players are killing the game more than the developers are, it's the ones you never see.  The bloc level FCs that retire before their prime to be line members somwhere instead of leading alliances,  The guy with enough dedication to drop a hundred ratirus in one of the big backyards quitting because the mechanics are unfun.  The people with potential to really change the game typically don't grow up into those kinds of players anymore, and I think the unfun nature of playing optimally is the biggest contributor to that.
---
Regional chat already exists.  
---
... Support.
---
Just not good enough.
---
Looks like drifters are killing botting VNI's too

&gt; uses the point that hes been in the alliance thats been the most destructive to the game for 2 years
---
Can I use that as our new recruitment pitch?
---
Link you KMs
---
me too, thanks
---
You post like a know it all retard with his head up his ass. 
---
You can’t click on a thread without it being about this bullshit. Npc null is where its at.
---
can confirm, also lowsex
---
You managed to define you basic problem just fine. You’ll be ok!
---
No idea, I play eve online by not logging in and browsing zkill instead.
---
I have not heard of that.  Will check it out.  Thanks.
---
So the same cancer that nullsec deals with then.
---
We already had that via daily sp rewards, both events and daily quests.
---
if they did warp around randomly, instavolleying people in plexes and shutting down all of FW from shooting eachother, unironically it might be on par with this.  *Just bring 25 man gangs that can handle drifters idiot, nobody said you were entitled to solo pvp in fw.*
---
Can you explain how *any* of that is relevant?
---
Something that I noticed: the final blow of both of those structures were done by players. It looks like the drifters did the majority of the damage, were defeated, then another player showed up to finish the structures off.
---
Not actually  trying... said the guy pretending the mechanics are the same as some other shit else where because...
---
He hasn't actually tried.
---
 Dscan is defeatable
---
Local is perfect, undefeatable intel
---
Force recons are not visible on dscan. They would have to post scouts on every gate in every system, and then hope there is no logoff trap too.
---
Kids these days.
---
That's over 1000 atrons my friend
---
Black Rise Matters
---
Preaching to the choir on that one.
---
ccp dev 1: "players arent out in space unless they're underneath their umbrellas! what do we do!?"     
---
ccp dev 2, fresh back from huffing paint in the supply closet: "i know, a mechanic that just fucking kills you if you're not ready with a fleet on standby to save you, surely that'll get people out from under the umbrella"    
---
you, the ceo of mensa: "this is a good idea actually"
---
How *dare* you.
---
A levi with an 50000mn mwd might do the trick
---
right, I'm saying that TEST needs 1 region, maybe less if we really crammed.  We currently have 2 rental regions on top of the 1 we need and we can handle the status quo better than small alliances with no renters.
---
just adapt
---
"the ai vs ai battle eve players will not tell you about"
---
Good luck watching all the wormhole connections.  
---
Or the black ops bridge.
---
Eve is unfair!
---
CCP is in there!
---
Standing at the concession!
---
Plotting their oppression!
---
Just a shame the average reddit dumbo isn't gonna read through all of that. Let alone the numpties at CCP HQ.
---
Kinda throwing pearls before swine, but posts like this are the reason why I still skim through this sewer of a forum whenever I feel masochistic. Once these posts disappear, you know EVE is truly dead.
---
Honestly, why the fuck aren't these killing krabs in high sec missions/incursions, too?
---
the whole thing is just idiotic pure and simple.
---
They fuck up PVP in nullsec, so why wouldn't they?
---
e) CCP plans to absolutely fuck over certain regions and make them completely uninhabitable, so that their inhabitants are forced to move/invade. Which also creates a gold rush once the drifters are gone and done.
---
Are they attacking structures in WH space? I'm genuinely curious.
---
Reddit posts like this that sometimes cross developer desks is the closest I'll probably ever come to having the power to do something about it.  When skillu self destructed out of how shit current era mechanics are did it positively or negatively affect the game?  (Bonus hint, the entire alliance got absorbed by fraternity) . I could self destruct TEST tomorrow and the game would be in an objectively worse place than it is today.
---
neither roamers would know where is everyone
---
Piff.  We read dotlan.
---
That's fair, but at the same time alliance these days might as well be coalitions. Either way, way too many +10's all owning nearby space. Massive coalition wars are not the bread and butter of EVE, and we've been without the butter now since ~2016.
---
Yes. Can confirm.
---
No, at least not like this I think.  butt WH space actually has reason to defend.  Which we do constantly.  
---
Honestly why don't you guys use this to your advantage?  You can have a defense fleet going to deal with the drifters while an attacking force goes in and fucks with the enemy while they are being fucked with by the drifters as well?
---
My current FW toon is Cinske Ostus. The fit I'm currently flying is the last one I lost. Pretty tanky, can outlast *most* things, even when capwar'd, as long as you have someone else w/ you.
---
It won't end until Drifters force alliances to fallback and defend the important spaces, and simply let Drifters clean up your spam waste.
---
I think wanting to have hundreds of structures spread out over large areas of space that you don't feel the need to have to defend is unreasonable. You've been so used to play Nullsec on EZ mode for so long, you don't like being put on your back foot and having to defend against an enemy you can't blueball and use weaponized boredom to discourage from fighting. 
---
Small entities aren't complaining on here because it doesn't affect them nearly as much because they don't have a ridiculous amount of structures to defend. Of course you're going to have a ton of notifications. Look at the number of structures that are spammed all over space. It's absurd. 
---
You enjoy your holiday weekend though. I'm going to be grilling out and enjoying myself.
---
Try roaming Provi, geminate, or catch sometime.
---
They should drop whatever is in the corp hangars.
---
It works for wormholes.           
---
INB4 BuT mUh NpC sTaTiOnS
---
Asset safety should be a luxury reserved for citadels that aren't low power.
---
It doesn’t even have to be as extreme as wormholes
---
Let's be real sov does not matter, citadels do. 
---
Citadels were originally supposed to have a completely different set of timers and mechanics that were closer to what fozzie sov was. The entire purpose of the system was to spread fights for citadels out over a constellation to prevent things like tether abuse, and large n+1 capital fights, and emphasize sub caps. It was changed before it even hit the test server because players wanted things to explode by shooting them. The resulting change gutted the system to be worse off than what we had before; it achieved none of its original goals, and CCP has either been ignoring the issue for stretches or trying to find convoluted patches that don't work ever since. The reality is the change that players wanted caused the core concept of the system to be so radically different that the only thing that could right the ship would be a ground up rebuild.
---
You mean, like 1v1 baits and trickery?
---
GoodIdeas
---
First, I feel I should put out there that I just rejoined Null in the last 2 or so weeks. I was wormholing the previous years. Your assertions about my personal situation and feelings on the matter are not on-target here.
---
To be succinct, we agree that things are too safe. Where we disagree is that I would not be cheering for terrible game design if the situation were reversed.
---
i'd bet that most of the null blocs would like this.
---
aren't you in goons tho
---
well, my net worth is probably around 20b. but im considered poor by goon standards
---
No.  The FC usually lines up a Rorq to warp in and scoop "for the corp" (yea, right).  It's not a free-for-all and it doesn't get given to the fleet.  Well, maybe it's added to the SRP fund, I don't know. 
---
If it spammed a couple of hundred containers people would complain about lag.  I mean if you're going to do that, just teleport items into peoples' cargo bays.
---
It's actually try to force use to dive into abyssal dead space, they spent dozens of man hours making that content, and they will be damed if they let us do anything else...
---
At this point, we are making assumptions on how long this will last.
---
I doubt this is going to be a permanent thing.
---
Masterpiece of a post showing you are well informed of the current state of the game and presenting good ideas on how to fix it. Not all of them are original but this is by far the most comprehensive and well-linked post I have seen that bring those ideas together.
---
Your scenario of a fight is the organic fight generation that I so sorely miss. We need positive interaction with structures and nerfs to projection to allow for these smaller scale conflicts to arise.
---
12/10 post. I would give you the job of Lead Game Designer if I could. You have knowledge and a vision. Something it seems CCP has been lacking of late.
---
Should drop everything inside it. If you want to keep your stuff safe, you should have to defend it but the timers shite needs to be reworked along with it.
---
Awesome, thanks for the reply.
---
So, goons should go burn the entire north in a few weeks. Test and Frat should take turns burning each other’s space because both have superiority in their tz. 
---
I’m sure that would make for engaging gameplay
---
Removing of local would make roaming in null such a boring and tedious experience that nobody would do that, so bots would be safe. Camping and baiting on the other hand would be buffed.
---
Tfw agreeing with Dave
---
Botting and human supers and rorquals are untouched by this. 
---
Botting and human subcaps can no longer do any pve safely. 
---
This doesn’t hurt botting, it hurts undocking in a subcap
---
You're talking to a goon, did you expect logic? :)
---
if you wanna flex by saying you've stopped the most content and blued the most people then go ahead and tell that to the next panfam reject group you recruit because they cant rat
---
Weekend? It's Thursday.
---
Sounds like a simple solution if these mega alliances cannot handle the drifters and all these man hours are required to protect the SOV they hold then don't own so much SOV. 
---
As in the comments small groups/solo guys are managing because they don't own as much space. The big alliances have been able to hold such huge areas because of the blue donut this spices that up. A lot of groups have so much space in military terms they are overextended.
---
Logged into eve for first time in a couple of years the other day did a trip a few jumps from Jita to pick up some goodies I'd left in a Corp owned structure and then got 100-0'd on a gate in a 0.8 In like 3 seconds by these new dumb shit npcs, won't be keeping that sub going or the game even Installed sure it was only like 60m loss but the fact that happens on a high sec gate is bs sure I'm only in a t2 frigate/bomber but nah fuck that
---
fun wise...its not one of the best.   but its far from the worst.    worst fun is mining, ratting, or freighting.
---
incursions can get repettitive, like the above 3, but unlike them it has a social aspect, a bit of risk, and requires you to be active.
---
abyssal is either 3 player, or 1 player.  though you can get by with 2.
---
1 player is cruiser.   2-3 player is frigate.    tier 1 keys are easy to solo, even in frigs.    tier 2 you need to have a build and plan.
---
tier 3 will challenge you a bit, and don't be surprised if you die occasionally.
---
tier 4, ramps up the difficulty, but also the reward immensely
---
and tier 5....is for people showing off or professional
---
It's both.  Back in 2012 -13 they were harping about null blocks being to spread out and there wasn't any room for the "little guys" to call their own.  Now that a region can support 40k plus players, they have switched to "You are to concentrated spread out more."  They will never be happy.  If the mechanics change to spread out the blocks, they will switch back to "There is no space for the little guys anymore." and the cycle will repeat.
---
Yes, that is the joke
---
Yes, but what is the use case for a ship that can only scan and that can't get targeted by sleepers?
---
I think super can take them down with 2 sets of webbing fighters, but I haven't tested it and hope I never will have to.
---
Top shelf
---
Paragon is definitely rented out, eso is not, no idea about Feythabolis but I assume it’s rented
---
why even undock if u cant afk mine all day
---
can u stop with this stupid fucking remove local meme already. it will kill null faster than ccp can churn out another police skin. who the fuck do you think will live in null anymore without local, it's the only reason anyone's able to make isk there. without it there's no bears and without bears there's no sov. it ain't hard.
---
Hey, it wasn’t anti super/Titan/rorqual 
---
Which just makes it even worse, tbh
---
This is a very good idea. It allows you to chat with a wider area of players and makes the game feel more active. It gives nullsec an added layer of danger, that it needs, and it really fucks with bots.
---
Please CCP, this must be done!
---
So it's gonna be aids if I reply to all of these, so instead I'm just gonna focus on the ones I think are most important:  
---
1.i. The issue I have with 3 timers is that for the vast, overwhelming majority of fights, two of those timers are non-events. So even allowing for this hypothetical, it's honestly not worth it. And the reason I say hypothetical is because in the example you gave, X47, Panfam committed their supers on the hull timer anyway.  
---
1.iv. I think 15 minutes is fine, because if this is a citadel in your space that you actually live in, you should be able to muster something in 15 minutes. And if you can't, you get a scheduled op 2 days later in a timezone of your choosing. Sound risky and dangerous and stressful? That's good imo.
---
2.i. I honestly just thing asking people to spend an hour making a timer even if it's uncontested is just terrible. These ADMs are supposed to confer benefits for space you live in - if you live in it, why can't you get there in 30 minutes? Remember, I don't think the minimum time should change, just the max - harassment really wouldn't be any easier.  
---
4.iv. I'm not against local delay *per se*, but I think it's going to affect 'local spike' intel a lot more than people realise. I also don't really think anom tackle affecting real players is an issue. There is this weird idea that if you're awake and aligned and watching local then you should be 100% safe, which I think is wrong. There should be risk, e.g. the risk of getting tackled by rats just before bads come into local. That's still a risk:reward calculation in which emergent, player-driven gameplay is the key component.
---
Can confirm, that's how I ended up here.
---
As far as I can tell, you haven’t actually been fighting the new drifters much
---
How do you figure?  Hunters all consult dotlan for Nov ticks.
---
I think the main issue people face is that you basically cannot kill them without a guaranteed loss. So you either ignore them or go after them with a shitty corm fleet or anything like that.
---
Even in wormholes you can dscan. And even if the enemy fleet is composed entirely of force recons, you have a lot more time to warp away than you do against these drifters. Also you can have scouts on wormhole entrances checking for hostile coming in
---
&gt; active defense 
---
I mean they are successfully defending, it's just a pain in the ass for little reward.
---
Remove vulnerability timers. Remove reinforcement mode. Remove free port mode. Just let people shoot them and either destroy it or capture it. BAM! I just fixed the station spamming.
---
It might be in the order of divisions but man-hours over hours is a statistic used in several industrial applications where you are trying to account for say .5 of a man hour. You can say half a person because that is demeaning to many.
---
Tackle ships appear on dscan. And in local. And they don’t insta-blap you, you can use neuts and MJD to escape
---
IS there an RSS feed for zkiillboard? How can I get mobile notifications on my phone for all new killboard entries for certain corps and alliances?
---
fackin oath m8
---
all will be ash
---
Not even joking, that's probably where CCP got the idea.
---
This aged *so* well. XD
---
I too enjoy having to avoid entire constellations because some instalock campers are around
---
If you guys already have your own little wh corp already, you can just enroll your corp into fw.
---
You can be a fw/wh corp!
---
No we didn't.
---
Did you miss the "most systems are empty" part completely. Without local you have to warp side to side in every single system to see if there's even anything there.
---
You really think CCP reads Reddit?
---
Dont you get it? Ccp programmed it. This is ccp. They are the drifters, purging the skies
---
i think if you combine both statements it forms " Null blocks should turn smaller"
---
It's an old meme ,But it checks out
---
&gt;they spent dozens of man hours making that content
---
Ha!
---
Was there anything else on field?
---
Asset safety should not exist.
---
Lmao.
---
They used to say the same about HK.
---
It’s only like this till they figure it put. Drifters only do like 1,600 dps each.
---
They do not
---
No they have a bot for that
---
That aged well.
---
It’s less work than being creative.
---
Take a C5 hole. Get dreads.  Make billions.
---
That’s the first step to recovery my friend, you are on your way.
---
That’s true but the DD’s oneshot pretty much any subcap.
---
You realize it does spawn hundreds of containers in wormholes and it works fine, right?
---
dont play the game at the moment, do drifters give killmails..?
---
No but you can take screenshots with timestamps and system names
---
Ohhhhh they have DDs. Why not just fight them in capitals then?
---
What fleet comp were you running? 
---
What other ships were on grid? 
---
What was your sig compared others? Some shield modules and rigs increase your sig. 
---
Were you decloaked before other things? 
---
Did you burn your MWD and bloom your sig?  
---
Many questions that could have answers as to why you popped. 
---
Decided to take the liberty to look at KBs
---
Your KM-  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/77605451/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77605451/) 
---
The related kills-  [https://zkillboard.com/related/30004759/201907031700/](https://zkillboard.com/related/30004759/201907031700/) 
---
First off, there is no pod kill related to that Sabre kill. There is however one related to another death you had in a Corm today. We won't worry about pesky details though, will we? 
---
Secondly, your sig in that Sabre can bloom to over 300 with MWD on and depending on skills could be much higher. Depending on what was going on with the other ships on the field at the time, you very well could have had the largest sig of all the subcaps. 
---
There were caps on field it appears but I can't say one way or the other how the Drifter AI deals with caps vs subcaps.
---
i feel like that could be abused tho
---
If you aren’t instawarp, then you’re risking drifters killing you every time you take a gate or warp to anything but a safe. Obviously you have pretty good odds to avoid them, but if you warp to something and drifters are either already there or warp there at the same time as you, you will be deleted
---
Timestamps make it so you can't reuse a picture to a use it so I mean. You tell me how
---
Sure why not add space administration and more bureaucracy to an already boring event, that'll liven it right the fuck up.
---
Reddit on that hot da Vinci Idea Machine tip
---
Why would large groups fracture? CCP hasn't changed the underlying mechanics that they implemented which allow 20-50,000 accounts to coexist in one region. If anything, drifters will keep groups from
---
Splitting away from larger coalitions. This will push people into more caps. This does everything people don't want.
---
Because commiting capitals to a small group of drifters is barely worth it. Besides the dd’s deal enough damage to oneshot a capital ship aswell. (Unless buffer fit).
---
but have you become real mens?
---
And bitching and complaining is better? At least this way it gives people an incentive to go kill drifters.
---
Yeah but I can see someone figuring out how best to fight the drifters if that keeps happening so the drifters will then start to affect these big alliances like normal pesky npcs
---
Dragoon. You can solo anything t3 destroyer and down as long as it needs capacitor to shoot. I’ve fed a Hecate to a dragoon twice after underestimating it, now I run from them
---
Hit me up when the drifter attacks pop up in the agency.
---
Don't listen to OPs lies. Joining factional warfare effectively halves the number of people in factional warfare that you can shoot. Go there and shoot at everyone instead. The LP payouts and other mechanics are shit anyway.
---
Does concord also block them in a bunch of systems?
---
There were just contributing to Sorts gofundme.
---
we've been playing by the same rules as everyone else. all i see from you is you're ass blasted at your own incompetence and looking to make it someone elses fault
---
Yes. Ths drifters are a branch of the sleepers who branched off from the Jovian Empire. The sleepers basically were a small, unimportant worker race for the Joves. They were the ones who went to build the original star gates. They were going mad on the journey, even though they had an artificial matrix world to keep them occupied in cryosleep. 
---
So they built a better construction. Eventually, long story short, they perfected artificial worlds, made a bunch of clones, rejected the Jove empire, basically built heaven.... literally heaven, inside their construct. The sleepers were raided by the Amarr to get tech so the Amarr could build the first immortal soldiers. But in doing so they effectively destroyed the Sleeper heaven.... the arrow were manipulated into it by a rogue AI that infected their Emperess. 
---
Soooooo unsure how, but after the fall of the sleepers, the Drifters came about. Probably as a result of their anger toward humans and capsulers.
---
I figured you liked space administration and bureaucracy.
---
You mean creating a bot to automate in-game activities?          
---
That's a EULA violation, and for good reason. HTFU.
---
Any sort of automation, scripting or macroing is NOT allowed. So that will get you in trouble, if found out.
---
Thanks
---
Not everyone roaming in null is a hunter, and dotlan gives a direction, you catch what you can on your way. Without local I would spend way too much time in a system to check it, or as you've said head directly to the system I choose completely ignoring everything else.
---
Dude stand down I'm just asking a hypothetical question don't take it so badly I haven't done that or anything
---
Sure you are. Yeah, I buy that.
---
I am not talking about storing and neither was OP.  
---
The refitting can be done right now at mobile depots.  
---
Actually even a normal cloak has no drawback, because the blackops share that 100% bonus on targeting delay with bombers.
---
Also don't make a fool out of yourself, I am well aware that catching (most) of those supers is involving a lot of work.
---
From an onlooker's perspective, the Drifters have made the game interesting again. Feeling like it might be time to un-win EVE.
---
I think this is the solution CCP is looking for yeah. Also increasing the number of people required to run an alliance efficiently, making smaller alliances better.
---
completley right, remove asset safety too and it might be worth living out here again
---
#MakeEvERiskyAgain
---
what specifically do you mean by timestamp
---
Rick, those aren't procurers!
---
The shield is 20% Thm KNT armor is 0% in K space
---
You a bitch
---
I've heard from someone that you can salvage the drifters (hard salvage, so t2 and rigs.) Making 75 mill per ship (until the salvage price drops. If it does)
---
No confirmation of that though.
---
The time at which the picture was taken
---
Why I'm I asking smartie pants?
---
Hi. I haven't played in like 4 years.
---
All my stuff is now in random containers in Low Sec. Asset Safety I've been reading.
---
1) Did it save 100% of my items or only 50% or?
---
2) How did stations in Nullsec get destroyed? places like VFK etc
---
The other advantage with blackops is that bombers get eaten by gate guns in lowsec.  
---
I can see that citadel spam is a problem for Blops hunters, it will not get solved by covops cloak or refitting without a depot though.  
---
Dropping on carriers, you face the problem of umbrellas and also that you can not stop the fighters from hitting you.  
---
There used to be a mechanic that did a pretty good job at preventing this, but CCP decided a taunt function is just what a fragile blackops needs.
---
Goto W-space.  Its profitable to kill things.
---
Doing Bob's work putting that thing out of it's misery.
---
&gt;Maybe if you calm down a bit you**'ll** get ~~less~~ **fewer** grammar mistakes
---
hth
---
&gt;If we went with 25man gangs, assuming about 425 (394 over 22hrs, extrapolated out to 24hr average) attacks per day, across the three regions
---
Don't the amount of attacks drastically decrease after you've killed the drifters?
---
I endorse this product and/or service.
---
Imagine searching through 2m old posts like a goon retard lmao
---
Goons were in the process of evicting the north. TEST was invading Frat space. How are they afraid to fight?
---
The ability to refit from a ship maintenance bay is "limited" to everyone in fleet and in range
---
No, they just keep respawning.  We had one system hit 22 separate times by 22 separate fleets yesterday
---
&gt; in the average three regions of the game there are about a 1000-1500 structures. 1000 timers, spread over ~2 days, 250-500 manhours to babysit
---
Game is fine by the way.
---
Because you didn’t read the EULA.
---
You don't have a solid grasp on where that ISK comes from do you?
---
ok
---
I mean these people have tens of trillions of isk to use for alliance purposes. Not that hard to use some of it to reward your pilots.
---
Actually yes but people ask before they do something if I was already doing it why would I even care?
---
Jesus.
---
You do realize that citadels drop into low power on the last timer anyway?
---
I love this so much as a person who says poi in local a lot and has the title a weeb who thinks he is a battleship
---
someone asked me to upload it so you can have it vOv
---
right, so what's stopping someone from photoshopping the time and date? or extracting 3d models for the ships and their wrecks, as well as all the associated text? faking combat logs?
---
a screenshot can contain all the stated elements and be a complete fabrication
---
admittedly, that's a fair bit of effort but my point is that a timestamp isn't enough
---
Okay then have an FC pap link.
---
So changing absolutely nothing then.
---
Super umbrella in delve dropping on some wormholers... in which way is this anything special and worth posting?
---
*chants* one of us, one of us
---
RvB is recruiting!
---
The game has been catering almost exclusively to everyone but hunters for the last 3 years
---
Thank you so much for letting me know. I never could have figured that out on my own.
---
You act like everyone isn't already under a super umbrella...
---
sorry i deleted my previous comment because i was double checking shit but here in a spoiler i guess &gt;.&gt;
---
&gt;!right, so what's stopping someone from photoshopping the time and date?
---
or extracting 3d models for the ships and their wrecks, as well as all the associated text? a screenshot can contain all the stated elements and be a complete fabrication
---
faking combat logs shouldn't be too hard either
---
admittedly, that's a fair bit of effort but my point is that a timestamp isn't enough!&lt;
---
pap links dont necessarily verify what happened in a fleet, just that a fleet existed and who was in that fleet (and that's assuming people are abusing the system, it has to be vetted by humans)
---
It doesn't matter, they just blue everyone around new Eden and squash any little alliance that tries to pop up. The only move currently is assimilation ..
---
&gt;like how would you speed up fitting skills?
---
Maybe you could gain the bonus for time you spend flying a ship with those types of modules equipped.
---
If drifters were in rimworld, they would make a fine hat
---
They do not yet
---
Im in a corp that owns some nullsec space and highsec space.
---
Haven’t heard a single complaint about the drifters. In fact, the prices of ores have steadily risen since the attack, which is good for me. Because I’m one of their miners and they pay us refined mineral costs using a buyback program for our raw ore.
---
Honestly, since this has happened. These pure nullsec corps sound like a bunch of whiners who put all their eggs into one basket.
---
The Time is wasted doing PVE instead of PVP. The reward is playing an EVE that is changing from a PVP focused game to a PVE focused game.
---
Really? The more you know.
---
These are sad.
---
Ooo. Let me try.
---
Can you jump off a bridge?
---
&gt; yeah, good luck with that. I had the pleasure of being locked out of my google account for a month myself after moving to a new location.
---
  I upgraded to a new phone- Had to reset every 2FA code, it's doable. Not impossible.
---
Dude, shhh, you are ruining their whiny circle jerk.
---
You have my sword
---
Good,  they don't deserve to blow their load
---
Were you expecting upvotes?
---
But goons are so efficient it's why they are the best krabs.
---
wow... im not sure you can say things like that in this day an age :P
---
So who has an alliance that will follow up on these timers on behalf of the drifters?  Also can I join them?
---
Lawyered!
---
elite cyno pvp
---
"...the inner hell lokis are tough..."
---
shows a wormholer dunk with caps on youtube and reddit...this is very sad dude
---
also I dont know why IH let themselves get booshed. pretty retarded
---
I dunno if you are actually in bombers bar thats pretty rich...
---
Or is it?
---
“The inner hell lokis are tough, so we start focusing fire”.    What!? You brought a dozen Titans, are you that delusional to think that was anything close to being tough? That’s not even counting the 50+ man fleet you brought.
---
The whole fleet was planned 2 years ago by init. too.
---
narrative ruining intensifies
---
Well to be fair, ItsFuckingPaco and he does what he wants.
---
Well, one of us undocks and gets fights, the other bitches on Reddit. No, I don't go around "fighting" the new drifters. That's your problem.
---
Imagine you enjoy something, make a video about it, then get shit on because of it. Why do so many here have to be downers? Just move on, if it isn't your cup of tea.
---
Hypertanked 150s? Yeah, this definitely wants a friend lol.
---
Here is your missing arm: \\
---
Well said sir
---
Hey non-EVE player here (sorry I had a burning curiosity about this) Let me know if I would be better making a post of this question: 
---
What is labour time in EVE online worth? 
---
Hypothetically, if I were to take on an average job in EVE and know what I was doing, I would be able to earn ISK. If 1 ISK has an approximate real world value of  $0.0000000182 then that time spent working in eve to earn ISK has an equivalent real world pay rate. 
---
So if I were to play for 8 hours, how many ISK could I reasonably expect to make?
---
(I was thinking that you could situate EVEs economy in relation to national economies, and I was wondering if there is anywhere in the world where playing EVE pays better than a job in that country. Silly, I know.)
---
metal scraps for salvage unless its changed today
---
Are you sorting them out between wormholes, abyssal pockets, and kspace? Or is this just _all_ drifter kills in general?
---
"Asklepians, really ??!?!!!"  
---
- i_beast
---
OP I enjoyed it.
---
Sure it's stupidly one-sided. But come on. Its a video of guys having fun. People need to lighten up.
---
Interesting. Have not had that happen when flying 4s align nomens. I suspect people dying either derped the warp or got rubberbanded.
---
Shoot as many nuetrals as you can find
---
Asset safety moved all your items to a lowsec station. You have to pay a fee worth roughly 15% of their value to recover them. 
---
The stations in sov null got turned into faction fortizars. So now they are just unique structures, and can be unanchored or destroyed like normal structures
---
Nice kill dude! We should roam again soon! - Darum Rinah
---
Glitter bombs and pizza with no sauce and no toppings.
---
Tbh I really enjoy the industry index mechanic as applied to moon mining and ratting. Just, inverted.
---
You most used systems (constellations?) are worse. So there's some measure of depletion mechanic.
---
This has got to be one of the cheapest tinker setups i’ve ever seen for c5
---
Maybe he means you better go your get shit out if your structure gets two of its timer hit and you still haven't evac'd out of it.
---
Krasivo, comrade :)
---
Yea, who wants any kind of mystery right?
---
The best part of this event *IS* the lack of information
---
Lol people were telling me they don’t appear in dscan when I asked. Turds
---
One of us, ONE OF US, ONE OF US!!!
---
What about the southern war between test and frat?
---
All Drifter kills,  but good point i can filter out if people want
---
And it is currently impractical to rat or mine in anything below a supercarrier, because any subcap gets instablapped with no chance of escape. Removing local would have similar effects. You're basically negating the main advantage of subcaps, i.e. the ability to warp out quickly.
---
Clicking Jump on a wormhole is confirmed hard ok guys.
---
Honestly. I am not in test or frat so I have no clue. but they are basically next to each other (and like, really do not like each other) so even if they retreat for now I'm sure conflict continue when (if?) this drifter stuff ends.
---
Supers can kill them easily.
---
There is no difference between an aligned capital or subcapital in your analogy.
---
Just in that subcapital ships can be taken down by roaming gangs.
---
I also believe that it shouldn't mainstay for capitals to wipe out anomalies like they do at the moment.
---
Are you saying you wouldn't do a Fleet Force?
---
You’ve just been lucky so far. But the drifters are instant death for any subcap they target, if you run into them and they aren’t shooting something else then you will die
---
I want Drifters to remain unprobable/Dscannable- It's the perfect weapon against bots. People playing the game can warp off the moment they see drifter ships in the overview land.
---
Yes. And the northern war will turn into Panfam invading Gotg with goons coming to help Gotg defend 
---
War doesn’t normally stop in nullsec, it just goes from big to small, but it’s always happening. Until now, at least
---
at least everyone still has their hands
---
Uhhhh, why do you have 19 maulus fits??
---
I like the flow of your viraj.
---
Ok thanks a lot. I logged in and all the big stations said they were gone or something lol. Blessing and curse because I'd never be able to get that stuff out of Deklein but now I'm about to get reamed on these prices...
---
Is it 15% of local market price or where do they get that pricing from?
---
Samezies.
---
It’s the in game price estimation. It’s not completely accurate but it’s not a horrible estimate either
---
#BUT BUT... IT'S *OUR* STRUCTURE! *WE PAID FOR IT!*
---
I think its this. Drifters are there ai test bed amd have been sonce there inception. Trigs are using a more stable version of it. I think the invasions will change and evolve. Hopefully the ai will figure out timers lol.
---
KeanuWoah.jpeg
---
Thank you I found it very helpful :)
---
If players are so scared and risk averse they avoid entire pockets of space bacause of "spooky NPC's"- Players are part of the stagnation problem. As CCP said themselves: **SHIPS ARE AMMO**
---
"Resetting" it isnt practical unless the invasions go crazy hitting everything in one or two days. 
---
Nvm usless we learned after wwb it doesn't matter if you unseat an empire they jure retreat there supers to ls and reorganize. As long as titans are in such large quantities in so few "hands" it wont matter the state of the map itself.
---
Let me guess, you're a brave wormholer
---
Goons probably
---
TY. I'm gonna enjoy going down there and seeing the prices blow out my fucking balance.
---
This. This need to be at the top.
---
Former KarmaFleet here and currently unsubbed. Drifters are fucking cool and terrifying and I love the history around them. I honestly thought this was one of the most intriguing things that happened in Eve since Jamyl blew up and had considered resubbing until I heard the Fireside. I really wish Mittens would approach this as a way for Goons to have fun and adapt, but I just don't even want to get back in now. Not that Mittens cares because I was a pretty shit player, but I'd really prefer he get his head out of his ass and enjoy the damn game.
---
#:big_thonk:
---
Magic? No, garbage wolf pilots? Yes
---
Do we know if they warp to sigs and anoms? Or is it just anoms
---
This guy gets it
---
Someone said 4jumps from a drifter wh/jove observatory.
---
But dont trust everything. Eve likes to break rules.
---
Drifters: *Check CCP support pages*

---
  Just popped up 2256 eve time lol
---
That was a damn good read. Fuck I hope you are at least partially right.
---
10/10
---
1.i. The first timer would still be uneventful. But now its straight to final timer which would be a huge risk. Yes panfam did fight on x47 hull timer BUT they disengaged very early not only cause they were trading badly but also because they had to extract all those supertits in time.
---
1.iv. If its now 15min instead 25 its almost impossible to engage and try to fight and then disengage in time and extract. Which would lead to people not taking the risk at all and simply evacuating all their assets early.
---
Also, most alliances can not form a big fleet within 5min. To realize whats happening it usually takes a few minutes. Then you need to form which takes at least 5-10min (depending on what you need to fight). If every initial reff is done by 5 leshaks then it would be fine but thats not necessarily the case right? So you would have around 5min left on the clock to fight over the timer which is not enough from my pov.
---
2.i. i didnt mean to imply that 60min for an initial reff is good either. 
---
4.iv. Yes if people get unlucky they should get caught ofc. But the balance has to be right otherwise nobody will take the risk and we end up with no targets in space. Id rather have 1000 carriers ratting that need to make mistakes to get caught than 10 that can get caught even if they do everything right. If that makes any sense :D
---
Because it is Inner Hel?
---
I wouldn't ask if I already had done this anyway
---
Fantastic!
---
faction warfare is fun.  But if you are flying t1 frigates,  expect to mostly face ships that cost 100x yours and blow you up in seconds.
---
I think it'd give us a clearer indication of a full effects of Drifter attacks on players (both ships and structures) if we could at least remove the kills in Abyssal pockets.
---
Then take the answer you asked for and chill.
---
TEST has engaged in so many wars, creating content up and down the galaxy. I fail to see how we're the worst. Maybe goons, but not TEST.
---
Fair enough. I appreciate it.
---
"I'm one with the force and the force is with me"
---
Why don't you let drifters do all your dirty work?
---
It's like using a nuke to kill a house fly.....
---
Reintroducing some passive moon mining would help nerf rorqual moon mining too. That’s some absurd isk right there.
---
Drifters, better at pvp than the rest of you.
---
Pretty much every game that has this mechanic had the above happen.
---
Remember darkfall... taking damage improved a stat, so people afk'd in massive piles in acid pits spamming aoe heals on each other.
---
I read EVERY notification with a great sense of joy.
---
or i could just talk to RK and ask him (coalicion hispana's leader btw).
---
just did. he said "yeah, we had to fit webs on all our citadels." (translated from Spanish).
---
Maybe just make the drifters target everything in null and anything/one who is part of the null carebear alliances in ls and they can play the lore out of the drifters trying to balance by destroying all the big null alliances so more split up ones can be made
---
I agree with the math of the OP and the feeling of this specific post. I don't see it lasting another few weeks honestly. If my entire EVE gameplay option for the next 1 or 2 or 3 weeks is human waves of npcs? I'd honestly play another game. I haven't purposely shot at NPCS for a year or two and I don't intend on doing it now as a mandatory to exist long term event. As an expansion event? 100 % ok with it and whatever comes with it. As a permanent part of the game or semi permanent? I'd axe my accounts if that became the status quo.
---
Also, to help you out, you realize you can train your other two toons on a account so you can run more indy jobs  at the same time right?
---
So isk earning as solo is best done with dedplexs, fw plexs*would be good for your garmur* incursions.. I highly recomend wh raiding or daytripping. Even for gas its worth your while for the high class stuff c320.
---
pi in wh or ns is good idk how good ls is. 
---
Its still the same game under the hood youll get use to it. Citidel's are really the biggest change.
---
There are a few big problems with nullsec, and local is one of them. It's not the only one, but telling people exactly when I am present in a system means they can run straight to a safe citadel and makes it impossible to even get into an engagement where the other problems arise.
---
&gt;and I was wondering if there is anywhere in the world where playing EVE pays better than a job in that country.
---
Not necessarily as silly as you think. One of EVE's long-standing issues (and one that each MMO has to deal with to some degree) is RMT, or 'real money trading', where players make obscene amounts of money, and then sell illegitimately for real cash on the black market. Usually, however, this is done via botting or hacking accounts, not actual legitimate gameplay. 
---
To answer your main question, a players equipped to undertake high-end PVE (this means rorqual multiboxing, wormhole farming, super ratting etc.) can expect to make over a billion ISK per hour which, using your figure, is $18.2. Note that I didn't bother to check if your appoximation for real-world value of 1 ISK is accurate or not.
---
&gt; without [local] there's no bears
---
that's funny i'm sure people bear in wormholes
---
Wishful thinking but maybe all this pressure will force them to give up a lot of space. Cuz you know they wont get smaller unless theres a membership concord tax or someshit, based on there size. Then they will just make alt alliances at a certain point.. Unfortunately its the human condition to band together in the biggest bunch.
---
It's really explicitly a blessing since the space you used to live in got conquered four times over while you were gone, and you still have your stuff. 85% is way better than 0%.
---
you meant wrong
