This kinda backs up what I was saying, there is not even 1 quadrillion isk in game (at the point of that chart). Furthermore only ~51T was herald by the top 5% and evenly spread out among that 5% it only comes to ~6T per person. So yeah even 10T is a “crap ton” of isk. 
---

---
Player count was taken as 175000 from [this](https://tagn.wordpress.com/2018/08/27/how-many-people-play-eve-online/) site.

---
Let's really get to the point.  We are painted as PL alts so provi has a script to pitch on the bat phone.  PL would never come to provi defense just to prop them up.  The only way provi retains anything is on the coat tails of whoever is willing to fight for them.  They will form a blob to counter the most simple kitchen sink fleets because it's the only way for them to win.  The narrative we are PL alts is their to draw people into the narrative that if they do not prop CVA up then this PL alt group will set up here which is trash.
---
What is the point of publishing this story here? Do you want a fucking cookie?
---
Release a mirrored copy of EVE as it is right now and release expansions/patches in a backwards order.     
---
So by 2035 we'll be playing EVE as it was 2003. (And somewhere around 2031 we make sure to back up our boot.ini)
---
These numbers tried to closely reflect personal isk/assets and not corp/alliance isk and assets. I'd venture to say that at this point there was most likely a multiplier of 2 or more on that number should it include alliance/corp isk/assets.
---
The *leaders* of PL and NC were asking for it by signing off in that stupid document. Why they signed up to a plan that may as well have been called "how to completely neuter elite PvP deployment play style" is a mystery.

Is it good press if everyone thinks it is dying but it’s not?
---
Things are more expensive in null but most places your alliance should have a mostly stocked market. And the easiest way to get out there is in an insta warping interceptor. 
---
Don't try hauling anything out there yourself until you understand the difficulties of moving around in a ship that isn't nullified.
---
&gt; ARE YOU NOT SEEING THE PAGES AND PAGES OF UPWELL-GARBAGE ON YOUR OVERVIEW?
---
Nope.
---
I don't have refineries showing, and most of the time my overview is sorted by icon (click on the column header) so that gates are at the top.
---
I only have large and x-large Upwell (again, no refineries) on my combat tab.  I usually sort this one by range, and occasionally by ship type.
---
Rumor has it that sort still has trouble sitting down from all the goon thrusting
---
Yep.  All he said was zeros at the end.
---
How about stopping alpha accounts from being able to go-to null sec .  Just have the gates tell them they can't like when high sec gates stop capitals from going to hi sec.
---
So then they would have hi sec and low sec to work with.
---
A rebuttal:
---
* Cyno falls under the same rules as logoff traps I specified for covert drops. I had thought that would be implied, since covert drops **also** use a cyno.
---
* A wormhole in the system in question has the best chance of success, sure. However keep in mind that:
---
 * If there are exploration bots, scanning a new sig would be fairly routine.
---
 * Given how easily you can script the PvE in this game, how difficult do you think it would be to make a script to roll or crit a wormhole? (Not difficult at all)
---
and individual sigs can field more than most alliances in Eve.
---
A home grown Eve book is on Volume 2 about to be published.  Whereas an Imperium backed Eve book never left the yacht.
---
Join Brave, Karmafleet or PH and follow the instructions they give you for getting out to them.  In most cases once you're in the corp you can set your clone home system and self-destruct there.  You'll be able to buy ships and modules out in null, no problem.
---
So my local postman filed that restraining order for stalking against me for nothing?
---
Thanks for the update and good luck for your work. Can't wait to get my hands on the final version.

I wouldn't trust someone named sonic lover to breathe properly, let alone be a game dev
---
I'm not the author, just sharing the email that just went out to backers. I loved the first book. I've listened to the audiobook about 10 times. Hidhly reccomend checking out volume 1 if you haven't
---
What about just using a Captcha on alpha accounts? On a random (x%) number of missions/anoms dungeons warped into, present the player with the Captcha on a timer, if they're unable to answer the Captcha within a reasonable time frame, either CONCORD or the resident NPC's will spawn on them and take them out with no chance for the player(bot) to win (alternatively it could just log them out and not allow them to log back in for 30 minutes).
---
Cheaper to buy in Delve than in Jita after factoring in shipping costs. Of course, the market can support there, most other groups cannot.
---
CO2
---
Because people didn't want to kill Goons the entity and wanted them to rebuild, but underestimated just how powerful skill injectors and rorquals were to drive that much industry.
---
Test/imperium most certainly do shoot each other’s rorquals
---
The space police are only around when you don't need them.
---
Amazing. Every word you just said was wrong.
---
Imperium yes. But I haven’t seen goons and test hitting each other’s rorqs
---
All that nonsense about bot sophistication is just misdirection
---
So you're admitting your post is just "nerf VNIs" with extra steps?
---
&gt;only if you count TAPI as separate from the Imperium
---
&gt;and Highsec was dominated by TAPI (which is pretty much Imperium)
---
Please do an AMA, thousands would flock to see the world's worst case of retardation.
---
How does one do that
---
Something Awful is irrelevant now, especially as a breeding ground for groups.
---
[Not originally.](https://youtu.be/rNhPig8inEY?t=4674) They built a lot of the game on carbon, but then swapped to Unreal about two years before the beta. In that same time they reduced the scope of the game and it became the lobby shooter that it was. They wasted a ton of time expanding the engine to be able to handle what they were planning with Dust. It already existed because of WoD, and the character creator was already using in in eve at that point. In the end, I suspect they decided to much had been invested with a long way to go still and made the swap to an off the shelf engine, settling with unreal.
---
daddy this is some big brain stuff
---
My money is on Pearcy
---
It is, you hit restrictions and you have to subscribe, eve was sub only for a long time, if you want to play it free they have you adding resources to the market.
---
You can get to a place where you can sub yourself and have a good chuck of isk left to do whatever with, takes some set up, but you can do it quickly with a one time payment type deal with the DLC.
---
Just wait.. CCP will release something game changing in the next 20 years. Maybe t2 titans
---
Sure they're capable of defending it today, but if you start your year-long campaign to RF the poco's believe me after well 150 times of blue balls there gonna be fewer people showing up.
---
Renter isk is basically Alliance isk earned from PVP actions which suits/suited those alliances. The backbone of the alliances who facilitate renting would rather PvP than PvE when logged in.
---
No, but you could be locked out from them.
---
You have to entosis the sov so of course you were.  The very day Progod found out PL intended to take tribute he said "well we're moving".
---
what did the mad king say when you stabbed him in the back?
---
I want ur cookie daddy :)
---
r/unexpectedstellaris
---
Concords job is more punishment than protection
---
The issue with your logic is you think that once somebody is "defeated" they are dead. Goons were defeated in WWB, and yet they exist here and now and are dominating. What is to stop Panfam from being defeated and 2 years down the road they are invading delve? 
---
Don't take this war as the end of eve. Take it as a wake up call for the other super powers. Get your shit together and start being powerful again. How they are currently operating, if defeated, needs to be reworked.
---
Well, still good luck for your work, whoever you are ;)
---
Agree, i have volume 1 on my e-book, was a very good read.
---
Every line in this except for the last two sentences was a meme that GSF/Goonfleet members would post years ago before the alliance was filled J4G spodbrains
---
this should be the highest level comment
---
Will they selectively revoke T2 BPOs from certain alliances too?
---
Bots can already do this.  Not every bot  is in a VNI.  A bot can already do pretty much anything in the game.
---
Right now what I'd consider a "crap ton" of ISK is around the 50-100Bn range. That number has gone up as I've spent more time in EVE. Back when I first started playing, a billion ISK seemed like a monumental amount that would take forever to get, now I start to krab if my combined wallet across my alts drops below that amount.
---
Your perspective really widens the longer you play.
---
I 100% agree with you
---
This is some god-tier animation sir.
---
Jump from hisec into stain...oh wait.
---
will it be available on amazon like the first one was and besides the great nullsec wars will the book be covering areas of space like lowsec and wh space?
---
Not quite correct.
---
Director betrayal killed BoB on paper. It didn't kill it in practice, other factors did.
---
An alliance/coalition is not a name in an info box. It is a group of pilots who band together for a common cause. It will continue to exist so long as the pilots make it so.
---
bounties + loot is the rest of the regions is better than just bounties in the drone lands.  Buuuut, you have to use a tractor and sell or reprocess the loot.
---
I don't consider living in goons to be typical. But whatever the community has spoken i'll erase my comment.
---
Something something glass houses.
---
&gt;CCP doesn't need to fix them because they are not broken.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Is from GSF
---
wow :( im still an ultrapoor wh boi, i have to be talked into buying a fit for more than 25m
---
I was one of the first people to start taking sov for TEST in catch, it doesn't take a genius to realize that TEST is a basically a part of the Imperium, as hard as you might try to deny it.
---
It's almost as though you just stopped reading at some point.
---
One: Flairless nobody trying to call someone out is cute.
---
Two: Nothing you said changes the fact that DeadCo attempted a defense when the Imperium attacked our space. Panfam is not.
---
Makes me think I came across a ratting Gila the other day, but his script must have been retarded since he jumped back to an acceleration gate with five of us in local and two of us sitting right there.
---
No
---
Not many of the older Goon crew left. I wouldn't be at all surprised if a majority of the current group didn't know what SA is.
---
Fairly old news, it's why there is usually an uproar when more and more people blue imperium. You know it's bad when on the meta show boat says the only place they can deploy to is against panfam.
---
Isn't the antagonist happiest when there are many people having fun in anomalies?
---
So it screws over friendlies, and the player, since the site wont respawn for a prolonged period of time.
---
Exactly.. facts are facts.. imma nobody.. and well deadco is... see above lol
---
Wormholes are a special case where entry to the system can be controlled to a degree that is not possible in nullsec.
---
It might be just that, yes.
---
Oof
---
 - Remove local in Nullsec?
---
 - Make tackle rats standard in Null.
---
 - Bubble rats!?
---
 - I also support the blue loot idea.
---
How do you loot an ESS that’s hell spawned?
---
Why?
---
Also, about 200 people would join. Enjoy not having anything to do.
---
Do you mind me asking/be comfortable answering who is left of that faction? I kinda independently came to the same conclusion a while ago and was wondering why this has never been broached by the devs. Would just letting them know personally in some way that "hey some players know this is an issue still and would support a change" help get the ball rolling on the issue in your opinion?
---
I read the first one as an ebook so I'm really hoping it gets released as an ebook also.
---
Erm, never stabbed anyone in the back, but thanks for playing.
---
EVE is no easier to bot than any other mmo. It's just that EVE's pve is so engaging that the incentive to bot is higher.
---
I'm just a fellow space nerd :D
---
Awww, Toni said no? Poor kid. Maybe next time don't be stupid?

Lololol

---
That's dedication right there.
---
Good
---
the old goons from something awful are long gone/dead  
---
current goon swarm has nothing to do with the forum, apart from the old guard who don't actually play the game
---
What is the motivation for it though. After WWB, Goons already cleared out the weak holders and traitors. There isn't a need to steal/flip anything. The only ones left are new people, miners and the loyalist.
---
Except for a few cases, it was incredibly easy to get your stuff out again.
---
When this one starts is around the time i started so im hpyed for a trip down memory lane. I hope its as good as the first one what little ive read of it.
---
This was all of Panfam's own doing, I have no pity. Their choices got them their, they got greedy right at the end of WWB and stabbed all their "lesser" allies in the back or conveniently got rid of them.
---
This I completely agree with.
---
&gt;osrs
---
Yeah. There ain't much point to having a warp core stabilizer fit at all. The primary goal should be for reducing align time to under two seconds. Unless you want to use that fit to burn for pings when you have hostiles on grid.
---
As for smart bombing gate camps. There ain't really a whole lot you can do about that. Unless you try to warp to a celestial at around every out gate online your route to check d-scan for ships. 
---
Most people just don't check or just ain't that paranoid. Unless it is a well camped low sec system.
---
Real human being who krabs 2 - 3 hours a few days a week here: 
---
Anom spawn nerfs are very annoying.  I have to constantly scan anomalies with like 3 or more people I. System.  Bots don’t get annoyed
---
Yeah but noone is going to argue rorqs have been a positive addition to Eve. They've just started an insane arms race.
---
Frigate abyssal sites will be pretty accessible, you can run them as a duo together.
---
I’ve never heard of them before, would you care to explain? Thanks a lot for the info.
---
VNIs with remote reps can be pretty fun, it's really simple as well, so you could explain stuff as you let drones kill shit in different DED, anomalies, low-class WH combat sites, etc.
---
I never list as the lowest price. Nor even all that low at all. Usually the item sells in a few hours on items with a lot of movement. .01 folks mean nothing.

Thank you!

You can at least appreciate the amount of effort this guy put into this
---
Unspoken
---
bob getting their sov dropped didn't kill bob.  it merely took away their defensive advantage and forced them to fight on even terms, where they promptly got slaughtered.
---
affects*
---
That is a far cry of what you were know for by your own motto: Win Win Win
---
Includes a rorq and a carrier, get a titan with the limited edition dlc
---
If done right, it could be simultaneously annoying and hilarious.  Drop a "mobile propaganda transmitter" in the the system, and it broadcasts a pre-programmed message into local at a certain interval.  Not enough to interfere with regular communications, but enough to be a little annoying.  Make it so that only one can be operational in a system at a time.
---
Maybe give exploration a try. Will help him learn the game a little quicker as you can start in highsec and then jump into a wormhole. And theres a good bit of progression as you decide if you wanna hunt together or not.
---
Personally I enjoyed doing industry with my friend back when he played. I had enough starting isk to put up a raitaru and get some blueprints. We also had hunting and exploration ships in there. Maybe not the best idea as he ended up quitting before we made the money back, but maybe something to consider.
---
The people shitting on TEST are, by and large, Panfam who relentlessly farmed them every time they got bored, and expected TEST to then come crawling back every time they were done.  TEST not playing along seems to have thrown Panfam for a loop.
---
Do some c3 sites in 2 praxii, cheap and good isk
---
Practice, practice, practice
---
Evertone's first experience with wormholes is magestic. I felt in Star Trek first time I crossed a wormhole.
---
I love these!!!! Keep em coming!!!!
---
seem to have a lot of dicks on your mind dude
---
Future of EVE:
---
1. Some alliance is gonna backstab someone and then crazy shit happens.
---
2. The influx of Chinese players on TQ is gonna be weird.
---
Keep in mind tho like 30-40% of the playerbase is pvp focused and the rest are skillers or equivalent to our hisec pve carebears..  
---
If it did turn out like osrs tho I’d love it, I just feel like Eve is too much of a niche game..
---
They really did need to leave in some form of passive mining in a diminshed way.. i.e. you can have the refinery auto-mine the moon, but you'll get half of what someone would get from actively mining it
---
Well, in that case it can be done similar to blue loot from wormhole sites. There is set buy orders for it in certain stations.
---
Depends how recently I went to Jita
---
*Stainguy rolls in his sleep*
---
I definitely agree with the statement of snuff, the amount of backstabbing they've done over the years. it's incredible that anyone batphones them anymore.
---
Just like you should pay for the number of people in your coep on a month to month basis right?
---
How about no.
---
I like your thinking friend
---
nah, i'd rather not subject my buddies to that
---
losing your touch....
---
Abaddon with t1 guns and t1 crystals is effective.
---
Didn't test dunk a bunch of init caps very recently?
---
Amazing how "PanFam made a mistake by turning on CO2/TEST and friends" Turns into "PanFam should never reset any blues and should try to collect more" Nice strawman bro.
---
What constitutes over farmed?
---
Red vs Blue. First one to live wins.
---
They are legit my favorite videos as well, just poking fun :P
---
Yeah this was the first I heard Imperium owning wormholes lol.
---
Left for several months and got bored.  Didnt really think my corp would move the Keepstar (yeah right), all industry, ships, PI, everything in asset safety.  Expensive laziness on my part lol.
---
!
---
Except they are becoming Goon pets
---
Another episode of: "ways in which eve is just like real life"
---
so completely change the game, got it.
---
Nah.  There's some truth in there.  I'm reasonably sure that Goonswarm are a group of individuals.
---
I actually had to look up who that was.  Looks like they fought for part of the Drone Regions and got it, so I'll also assume they didn't do that alone.
---
that's not a very good font. It reads like 'Loose lips Poo ships'
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also a fun way to meet people in wormholes is to jump in, cloak up just off a hole and say in local 'does anyone here want free candy/plex from my cargo?!'
---
it's how I joined my first corp, a wormhole group.
---
If history is applicable then it won't last. The Goons built a hell lf an empire but they'll find some way to fuck it up. My bet is an internal schism.
---
[Somehow this comes to mind...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines)
---
It really is an adventure the first few times you say "fuck it, I wanna know what's in there!"
---
it is. but honestly if they remade it witha  new engine itd be even better
---
I don't know the numbers offhand, but I wouldn't be surprised if [statistically speaking] the average nullsec resident was a Goon.
---
That’s true, It seems that the current engine somewhat limits what they can do as some of the code seems to be ancient as well, like not being able to switch characters without closing the whole game?
---
Not really because unlike in the bob day's there isn't the player count to have a larger group come in. 
---
There is also the issue of Lowsec being worthless to live in.
---
Now the only way such a coalition forms at this point is if there is a split within the imperium something I really don't see happening.
---
There is also the issue if it takes 3/4 years I don't see today's eve survive that.
---
Santa doesn't make _your_ kind of toys, doofus
---
Nothing of the sort.  Red herring dude.
---
Replace NS anom rats with rats that scram/web/actually do damage, so PvE in EvE isn't a) mind numbingly boring and easy and b) creating a bot that can succeed at pve becomes much more difficult.
---
Ok here's what you do. Send your friend off to lowsec in a terribly fit ship and get him to die in a fire. Then get him to convo one/ all of the guys that are on his kill mail and have him be really friendly, asking what he can do better next time etc. This is phase one and should get some isk coming in right off the bat.
---
Phase 2 is eventually you will find someone who will offer your friend a place in their corporation which he accepts. He then vouches you in, you both learn and grow within the corp, become useful, offer to help with logistics and take more responsibility. After about 12months+ (depending on how long it takes to gain trust) see how much access you have to corp assets and take them all.
---
:profit:
---
&gt; Goons had 600 titans last time they went north
---
And we only deployed one super doctrine (armor), the other stayed home.
---
Do you think there is any incentive for small gang players to stay in the game given that CCP pretends they don't exist?
---
Init isn’t goons. They’re just Imperium. 
---
Just because all the different goon pets and allies don’t always get along doesn’t make them independent
---
not a bad start, but it only minimally increases difficulty ratting for bots. install signal amp or sebo, Press Ctrl, click, then press F.
---
&gt;Line of sight firing requirements that prohibit shots through obstacles or allies
---
&gt;Friendly fire and splash damage, piercing damage, and chain damage effects
---
&gt;Directional targeting with non-locked hitscan firing (missed shots continue and hit targets behind the original target)
---
As much as these would be really cool if they were implemented, they'd absolutely fuck the servers in any decent sized engagement
---
Which, to be fair, is a legitimate comparison. But that's a *potential* outcome, it's not the current reality that so many people are claiming. Right now it would be totally possible to kick over our sand castles. But it would require a level of diplomacy and tact that PanFam are explicitly rejecting, so we'll see.
---
*... but it's pronounced Throatwobbler Mangrove.*
---
Also, WinterCo + SkillU + PL was pretty close to evicting test before goons stepped in. If goons made it clear they weren’t going to help test anymore, that alliance would reform and make another push
---
RMT and botting is why drones are desired.
---
I'd like to know how rally points make people isk.
---
They are 4 million to 6 million isk sites mainly of frigates and cruisers.
---
Why are they nerfed? Capitals dont run rally points?
---
How can we be sure about that?  ;-)
---
I realize this isn't exactly the same as an official CCP response, but there is a roleplay citadel sitting out in New Eden - The Farthest Shore - explicitly there for observation of the Eve Gate!
---
&gt; Its an interesting turnabout considering how much GSF/CFC tried to annihilate TEST from mid 2013 to early 2017 post-Fountain, and now they're allies.
---
You mean hardly at all?
---
Old guard here, what's up. Goons were never the first people on our minds when we made any decisions. Good try though.
---
I think that is very wishful thinking personally I suspect had well the MBC moved down south they would have won sure but I don't think it really would have matter for the state of the game, like somebody else would soon or later and likely soon have built the same crab fort be it GOTG or Test, while I do think the map would temporarily have more names that would quickly fade with rorquals coming into play.
---
I joined test when we were in hero, around 5 years ago. What have goons done to us to be our forever enemy? We were 'farmed' incessantly in catch and wc until wwb when we blued each other, and then like clock work pl was back at our doorstep. As soon as the started to put pressure on us we just left. We went all the way across the map from them. As soon as we got set up, they came down and fucked with us I'm catch where they couldn't get anything accomplished. They then left and came back to take provi stations for a month, which we took from them in less than a week. They then came back down after skillu put in a bunch or work to start trying to evict us, claiming we are gonna be homeless and yadayada yada. The 'lost' the first major engagement and then went home. Goons sent space violence down to fuck with us in wc, and that's it.   Fuck PL. They deserve to die.
---
Init is blue to goons and formally in that coalition.  Test is in legacy.  
---
Matter of fact the goons have a roam group in eso at this very minute looking to harass krabbers.
---
because they are all specific ships that can be gotten into with minimal skill requirements, very quickly and are very cheap for the level of versatility they offer botters.
---
Instead of having to train say, core fitting, skills to fly a VNI, you train frigs, dessies, cruiser a couple levels. Train a couple levels of afterburner. Then nothing but drone skills. That's basically it.
---
The 100mn shield or armor fit works for all factions, with selectable damage types.
---
Needs buffs.  
---
 Next patch...  
---
 Reduces to 40 m^(3)
---
Which is cool... but it's just observing a bright shiny wallpaper. =)
---
**gotta rat for 5 hours a day to fund my pvp broooooo, these srp'd feroxes are expensive!1!111**
---
You can find the first one online for free with a bit of googling, if you want to get a better look at it, although I definitely recommend buying it
---
It’s a huge leap to say “basically part of the imperium” dude.  
---
It’s more a matter of understanding and agreement of common philosophy but definitely not coalition/alliance members.
---
Wormholes and nullsec have and continue to operate very differently.  You can’t change topics midway and pretend its the same deal
---
I think you are giving botters to much credit. Also, I'd rather chase down a battleship then a cruiser. Either way, I think a change like this would be a good start. To bad CCP will never actually fix the issue.
---
What the fuck?
---
Didn’t Imperium kill an anchoring keepstar under a Titan fleet using boost ravens? Massed subcaps still beat caps if used right
---
You don't need any amount of isk. Most newbro corps will sort you out with ship and skill books. FireSale all your assets in Jita, then pod your self to there home system. Pandemic Hordes space is a few jumps from Jita.
---
I actually never even put in an app.   So he didn't say no, but your response proves I made the right choice.
---
Nah, they were just lazy and short sighted.
---
&gt;Now the only way such a coalition forms at this point is if there is a split within the imperium
---
Exactly.
---
&gt; something I really don't see happening. 
---
As it stands, also true. If I were in PL/NC's shoes I'd be trying to flip TEST/Legacy, because we're not actually part of the Imperium and we have a big enough super fleet to dramatically change the math, but instead they've spent the last couple of years doubling down on pissing us off. They might be able to make some headway by flipping both Init and Bastion but that has a much higher chance of failure.
---
Link me a Tapi rorq that died to goons, or a goon rorq that died to Tapi and I’ll change my post. But I haven’t seen either of those happening recently at all
---
&gt; Recent Pamfam thread asking for an anti-goon super coalition.
---
Fuck off do not put that thread on us. I am a PH fanboy and I would not want a pamfam super coalition. This is a video game anyone who is "in charge" will be self centered.

I realize that this is shitty bait and I'm biting anyways. The idea that it was one thing or another is small-minded. Reddit began by fomenting an extremely anti-goon attitude, which was easy since most Goons were on SA forums (it was this way for years before WWB). Goons did themselves no favors with the Viceroy program, the kickstarter, Digi doxxing people etc. etc. Then, Goons decided to burn Lowsec, which turned out to be their Vietnam/Afghanistan depending on whether you're American or Russian respectively. At around the same time, Psychotic Tendencies were making a mockery of SMA in Cloud Ring with like 20 dudes in Blops. So Goons effectively put their own blood in the water and unified the tribes of lowsec (against Goons) for the first time in Eve's history. And finally, with blood in the water and Goonswarm's PR at an all-time low, Lenny walked in with bags of money to coax everyone into dropping their personal rivalries and going after Goons, which they did.
---
It was a combination of a metric fuckton of factors that allowed WWB to go down the way it did, and the idea that it was "just money" or "just hating Goons" is fucking dumb, but I suspect I'm talking to someone who already knows that. 
---
My guess is that if Lenny were allowed to run his casino today, he'd have a much harder/more expensive time unifying all of Eve against Goons. In the end WWB or Casino War or whatever was about Money, PR, Pride, and Perceived opportunity. And apparently a threesome in Iceland or some shit.

I had just came back to the game years ago when wormholes were introducted. i scanned a wormhole and entered. Spent a while scanning and bookmarking. Left and couldn't help but think "what's the big deal" lol. Didn't do anything for me. Now years later I spend a fair amount of time in wormhole systems.
---
Always bookmark your entry wormhole \^\^
---
Next time cut your travel to and back by a lot of jumps. Signal cartel maps out and updates their website of all the Thera connections. A special wormhole system. That can cut travel time down dramitically.

Have a job in real life in a high gdp country. then buy plex.

I think he's saying to have them be like overseer tags or blue loot.
---
This
---
You forgot to include that it causes a criminal timer so its spammable in high sec and impossible to remove since NPC corp and war ineligible corp members can deploy them without issue.
---
".... what are you bringing?"  
---
"Our balls."
---
\- the last real elite alliance of EvE, when threatened by a blob of assorted miners, krabs and F1 monkeys. NCPL are not that alliance. NCPL have no balls to bring.
---
Translation: CCP, please nerf whatever doesn't suit my personal play style.
---
you dropped this *10e-5 #friglivesmatter
---
Im making approximately 10 bil a month off of mine
---
I never said they could or should do all of these. Just that it's possible to create a game that doesn't just result in "N+1 wins."  
---
That said, some of these can definitely be done in the current EVE Online client:
---
* Increased "spike-iness" of all damage and repairs that make large force strikes hugely inefficient
---
* Depleting resources that force moving and spreading out, decreasing localized power
---
* Fog of war and imperfect information that aid guerilla tactics and large-scale data collection
---
* Increased permanent asset loss and theft mechanics that can punish rich players
---
* Social and physical stealth mechanics that obscure identity, location, and motivation
---
* Structure sabotage, siphon, hacking, and theft mechanics that punish structure overreach
---
* Pretty much anything that decreases instantaneous force projection (teleportation)
---
Translation: This will DRASTICALLY nerf  YOUR personal playstyle so lemme low effort shit post about it
---
Very much looking forward to this
---
Thanks, but I can't take credit for the original idea, it was just one I saw in yet another 'fix lowsec' thread ages ago that stuck with me. The 'front line' idea also came from the same source.
---
The Initiative is big enough to take on NCPL why not try that? 
---
Or 
---
Goons by themself? 
---
Ohh cause there’s a chance there can be a good fight?
---
But why fight when ImperiumLegacy can  steamroll 5 to 1. I mean who want good fight?
---
Changing the security status of a system might A) not be possible B) not even solve the problem since the root is the ADM system.
---
And Sort (GOTG ) will  find another dick to suck, after his done backstabbing his previous Dick-lord.
---
Medium(low medium) quality is still good quality. Enjoyed it and would enjoy more. :)
---
If the only two options are Imperium taking a hit or TQ becoming like Serenity, I think the former option is best.

---
First time I took my time to explore. Amazing strunctures, planets. There is a place I warped that was a shatered planet. That gives you a sense of danger no other place on New Eden gives you.
---
It is a balance issue that an entity like the Imperium can even come to exist in the first place.
---
Sure, it *might* disperse, but it might not. And if it does, there's nothing preventing another *Imperium* from rising up again and again in the future. That's clearly an issue.
---
It shouldn't be possible to form entire fleets of Titans. It shouldn't be possible to turtle up in a few systems and mine trillions of ISK. It shouldn't be possible to spam hundreds of structures. It shouldn't be possible to do a lot of things, but it is -- which is a problem, and will continue to be a problem if left unaddressed.
---
Now sure, CCP can make it harder to form Titan fleets, accumulate ISK from sticking to a few systems, and spam structures -- but none of those will affect the existing stockpile of Titans, ISK, and structures. It will just make it harder for other entities to compete with the Imperium.
---
Dota 2 used to have bot problems as well. The game is free to play, but you have to play a certain number of games before you'll be allowed to use ranked mode, and you need to also have a registered phone number on their account.
---
I've chimed in with a similar suggestion for OSRS before, but never gained any sort of traction - people seem to think that burner phones will be too easy to use or whatever. Dota managed to implement it fairly well though, where online generated numbers are banned. I would imagine that similar potential exists for Alpha accounts here. You might not have to lock certain features behind alpha or omega, but you COULD lock them behind having a verified number tied to your account, with a small cooldown period of trying to add it.
---
[http://blog.dota2.com/2017/04/matchmaking-update/](http://blog.dota2.com/2017/04/matchmaking-update/)
---
The benefit to doing it this way is that you could simply blacklist numbers being used multiple times after an account is banned, and if a bot-master is sharing his number with a number of bot accounts, you could ban them all in one fell swoop.
---
One thing I'd be interested to know is how these bots are generally paid for - is it via sub money, or is it via plex?
---
I assume it's plex for the most part, so a potentially less popular idea would be to restrict those ship types to characters of a certain age, OR to block fresh accounts from purchasing plex directly off the market, unless they start purchasing a valid sub first.
---
This one might actually work out to be the softest way of doing it - 
---
You could restrict it so that new accounts, regardless of how much isk they have - can't buy plex or certain ships off the market until they have let's say... a week or two worth of play time under their belt. 
---
They could still jump into other ships and bot with those instead, but I suspect this would at least make replacing long-running bots alot harder.
---
I want faces on my ship now...CCP?
---
This makes too much sense.
---
in PL/NC position I would personally go for full blue balls then run an old school harassment campaign against imperium allies and avoid shooting anything owned by 1 of the alliances a weaker one.
---
Now I would do everything in my power ( think spies and other tactics ) to make it look like the already flipped, now the hostiles either believe that or don't, leadership really doesn't matter as much as members believing it. ( the strategy is as old as the Punic wars but still ). 
---
Other than that because this is NC/PL they can afford to be really mobile so you can hit some space and be on the other side of the map in a couple of day's whatever you do avoid the big titan engagement because you never gonna win that, you need to force small isolated fights, stock up on mobile cyno jammers. 
---
They have mostly competent line members so they have a benefit of not having to plan big move ops to just move some capitals around and not lose any as scary as this sounds i would split my forces as NC/PL because you have nothing to defend and really in you have a massive advantage in experience if a random NC/PL line member and a random goon have to FC a relatively equal fight my money is on NC/PL still. 
---
You need to devolve the war into random skirmishes, this means setting up a lot of timers and not committing on them like this isn't a short campaign it's likely not winnable but you can force a peace agreement out of pure frustration.

Captcha

Goons were defeated in WWB, but Panfam then turned on TEST and let goonswarm rebuild. Do you honestly think a group that plays the empire-building game as well as goons would let Panfam regroup in the same way? Your leadership is constantly talking about how that was a huge mistake by Panfam… Surely they wouldn't make the exact same mistake.
---
Nah, you totally weren't trying to [toast](https://zkillboard.com/kill/57770204/) with [toaster](https://zkillboard.com/kill/57770276/) rorquals in vale or anything.  I'm positive there were others, but those two rorquals I still remember.  I was helping waterboard the t3cs you tried but failed to save them with.
---
you clearly haven't ran enough abyssals or underestimate ccp's stupidity
---
So you just get blobbed in subcaps? I wish people would stop blaming everything on supercapitals.
---
I ran into the same shipyards a few times 100+ km away from Leashaks and a few times under their feet
---
What you talk
---
Went home with 60 faction fortizars top keks
---
Only after devs have been outed for no reason.
---
Good post, have an updoot
---
They would also have to bring enough to effectively counter the Imperium super umbrella... You would need to drop enough dreads that they could effectively kill supercapitals under fax reps.
---
If the last little bit has taught us anything, if you can drop an equal number of titans on a field with an equal number of dreads, and spread DD's, you don't need FAX reps.
---
Or maybe that [wouldn't be considered a mistake](https://tenor.com/view/joker-you-complete-me-heath-ledger-the-dark-knight-dark-knight-gif-4544583).
---
What if it was 6950 plex but anyone can apply a skin to a system and it lasts until someone else pays 6950 plex to replace the current skin with a new skin. Also goat.se is available.
---
Interested in them for kspace now?
---
It's funny you say that. I'm in favor of both home stations in wormholes and *removing asset safety from nullsec*. For the same reason. I want to see more ships blow up in defense of structures. In nullsec it's very easy to not undock, because if the citadel blows you don't lose anything (except an isk fee, I guess?). In wormholes it's very easy to not undock, because if you lose your pod once you're done. (This is not completely true, but I'm pretty sure every wormhole corp with a home defense doctrine has based their doctrine around not getting podded.) If I want more people to undock and get blown up, in wormholes, in high stakes situations, I need a way to make getting blown up not be the end of the road. I'm open to other ideas but the only ones I've heard so far are letting people set their home to a w-space citadel, or (more extreme) letting people jump clone into wormholes.
---
ur posts r needless clutter
---
Goons are welcoming them with open arms.  They are far more likely to side with GSF, especially given the collective nature of the Imperium.
---
Goons have a lot more in common with the incoming Chinese players then just about anyone else.  GSF has a long history of getting along with Eastern groups, and I don't really see that changing.
---
I suspect we will see a major chinese bloc form under the protection of the Imperium while they get started up.  People remember the folks who help them, and the folks who didn't.
---
&gt; This subreddit is just gonna push shit ideas. 
---
Absolutely. This is (part of) why the vote totals aren't visible. This is another tool in the toolbox of the CSM, who are quite capable of discarding our bullshit and pointing out when a gem gets through.
---
Don't you mean unanchoring?

90% of the time i rotate my camera its so I can find a portion of the nebula neutral enough so i can see brackets or because the damn star is shining right in my eye (the other 10% is ship spinning)

---
&gt;At around the same time, Psychotic Tendencies were making a mockery of SMA in Cloud Ring with like 20 dudes in Blops
---
Lenny (and some other IWI banker) paid mercenary to kill SMA since one of their leadership with his wife stole money from IWI, he then (coming from an interview he gave back then) saw the imperium cracking from the least pressure they were doing on SMA, he then realize he could actually put down the Imperium, he then paid even more people like giving free SRP for any super/titan lost against the imperium (+a lot of deal we will never heard of), for sure coalition join the hype train saying "grr goons we hate them grr (can I get some money too lenny pleaaaase)" like GOTG. 
---
The only reason people join MBC at that time was either money or free content for their leader (like really, who would not want to join a side who is already killing one of the biggest mega unkilled for many years ?)
---
&gt;My guess is that if Lenny were allowed to run his casino today, he'd have a much harder/more expensive time unifying all of Eve against Goons
---
It depend, would he still have enough money to kill the Imperium after they learn from their mistake ? Like I said above, people would only need to see some cracks to join the hype train and pretend they "hate goons" or "want to make eve better" or blabla, the hate of goons is still around, you just need to look at how fast  the recent narrative change when it come to bot for example : "Bot are bad for the game, look goons are pushing their people to bot, look how mittani yell at someone because he want to report goons", CCP peligro release data where it show bot live in renter space and most of the grr-goons alliance have renter who endup on that TOP 25 what reddit did ? Heh silence song, no one is pointing finger at the alliance on that top 25 instead they all now blame CCP for not doing their job properly and leader of said alliance start to use the exact same word Mittani was saying on that edited video "We don't have the tools for it". But well I'll stop renting about it, how hypocrite anti goons are is the main reason why I would always support goons  and the main reason why I love seeing those people getting so mad whenever you say "casino war" "Iwi" "RMT" or some trigger words like this.
---
It was supposed to be a comment on both the structure and the post.
---
Guess it wasn't very funny ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
&gt; If you have pointers on how to make the game more interesting, I'm all ears.
---
You're not getting a job with CCP after that.
---
Even if they didn’t boosh fleets need a massive nerf.
---
so you are suggesting ppl give up everything they've gathered so far? fk off
---
Sounds like we need to bring back Bobby Atlas.
---
Like the game Rust for example.. at least once a month every server is wiped, everyone starts fresh naked on the beach..
---
&gt;I'm not sure which one to join
---
All the major ones are good. They provide ships, people and content. Pick one, join it, and see if it's for you. If it's not you can always move. You're not tied to them. EVE corps and alliances are all about personal fit. 
---
&gt;how much isk I should have
---
If you can afford to fly a VNI, then you've got enough. All of the big alliances will have ways to help you make ISK. See point 1. 
---
&gt;how exactly to get out there
---
Once you've been accepted to one of the corps, they will let you know where the home system is, you can fly there. If you can fly an interceptor, do that, so you can get through potential bubble camps at choke points. In low sec and nullsec, in systems with other people in them, don't warp gate to gate so you can dodge potential smartbombers. Bounce to a celestial first.
---
&gt;will I be able to easily get ships on the null market 
---
All the major null alliances will have ships for you, both doctrine ships for PVP, and a market with other stuff. They will also have logistics wings that can bring things in if you need them.
---
[heres that pic of the Tempest design that’s referenced. It’s a hood looking design](https://i.imgur.com/VBISuUH.jpg)
---
I'd be kinda sad that I'd lost a couple of years of progress, but with the hindsight afforded to me by experience I'd be happy to get a fresh start and get into the game faster without having to bumble about sampling a little bit of everything.
---
Personally, I think it'd be kinda nice to reset the game to a state similar to how it was in 2003. Give it a fresh UI job and keep some of the modern mechanics but strip out a lot of the clutter that's developed. The game could develop further with the benefit of a decade and a half of hindsight and experience and it would probably launch with massive player numbers as people resub to try out a fresh new experience.
---
Maybe if CCP had the money (and I don't think they do, unfortunately) they could run it sorta like Vanilla WoW/OSRS, keeping this new version alongside the "old" version.
---
Where is it
---
There's always WoW classic.
---
Yes please. Whipe the server so we can all go and leave this game for good.
---
$ 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000003.50?

(never said which end)
---
I've always found explo to be a solo activity, short of sitting there is a cloaky pvp shit waiting for your friend to get jumped.
---
IT'S SO CUTE CAN WE KEEP IT
---
It has more relevance to eve than DNG tbf
---
Too complicated. I doubt even CCP knows how ma y rats it takes to raise the index up exactly 1 level.

Thank you so much for sharing all of this. I think EVE is about done were present pace to be maintained.
---

---
Why can't you understand that EVE revolves around Provi!
---
Well, i never targeted goons at all. simply stated that the CSM catered to one style of game play mainly. But over the years of the CSM Goons have dominated the seats. If you are offened by the facts i am sorry, it was not my intention to offend anyone here. I am also positive if it was NC/PL that had this huge power vacuum on thier side there would be a huge shit fest on reddit about it. its a two way street.
---
Very under rated comment. But completely accurate
---
I apply all this same logic to my board gaming with my RL buddies. When we pick up a new euro board game to try out, and it ends up not being fun because a few of the rules greatly limit the cool things we feel like we should be able to do in the game, we blame ourselves and spend our next 3 gaming sessions brainstorming homerules to keep ourselves under control so that we can enjoy the game that we paid money to enjoy. Of course it isn't the developers' fault for making shitty rules that, if followed as they are intended to be, ruin the game. It's totally our fault for trying to play the game by the rules instead of doing the developers' work for them (but still paying them for the game, of course, they've got kids to feed probably).
---
Remember that they still think it's a win that TEST stole all their forts instead of PL lol.
---
then you are talking about season mode like POE. you create season character and you start from scratch, at the end of season that char will either be gone or back to normal server.
---
season mode is fine for me tbh, you get a chance to experience the good old rookie days, but a simple reset of whole server is just too unacceptable.
---
They probably wouldn't remember the ring.
---
additionally supercapitals were the tools of the elite, ships requiring a whole 30-50m SP (minimum) pilot (in a world before injectors to boot) and could not be stockpiled risk free in a director's hangar in a keepstar, so proliferating them was significantly more difficult. So your small group could still be competitive in heavy assets with a much larger group of casual players because very few of them would invest the time and resources required to maintain such an asset

IDK it was pretty funny watching Snuff puss out with their massive super fleet cause the odds weren't stacked in their favor.
---
I though that goonswarm owned all of them. How can I get in on it
---
In rust you don’t have to wait months to train skills do you?
---
I’ve been playing eve for about 5 months now, a server wipe will basically reset all my current goals and all the money I had spent on the game would go to waste and I would definitely not be playing the game after that.
---
Yeah maybe, only after waiting several months or years for the skill training to max my favourite ships again though.

#The EVE Collector's Edition was supposed to include a CD, and on this CD would have been the original beta build of EVE Online circa 2003, which people could load and play in single player on their own PCs.
---
CSM 8 was told this was almost certainly going to happen, and then suddenly everyone stopped talking about it and we were never told why.
---
Eve can be botted using a simple macro program like AutoHotKey with color coding enabled. Because everything can be done by a few clicks and all info is flashing in your overview and local.
---
That moment when you think that PL still has alts everywhere lol, that PL is pretty dead.
---
Why isn't highsec or lowsec  in this? Bots routinely mine the ice belts with orcas and farm faction-warfare sites for LP.
---
im mainly playing this game because of what i achieved with the guys im playing.
---
im not interested in starting all over again in a ''sandbox'' with gamemechanics completely retarded as they are now.
---
''wiping'' would give me the final reason to stop playing eve and play different stuff with the guys i always played with
---
Sort Dragons been put in a dumpster lately....
---
The gate rats scram making it easier to catch people.
---
a great man once said 'there is no "winning" in eve. There is simply shooting, and posting'
---
I swear we preemptively pulled out of vale when we knew an invasion was imminent and regrouped down south and formed what we are today.  I swear panfam declared us cowards and tried to follow us for 2 years before they collapsed.... Now they take a page from our playbook and call the rhetoric against them spin.

THE HYPOCRISY is strong with this one...

Terrible. Then the eyeballs. Well played, eyeballs get me everytime.
---
I vote for the one that saved mass by not fitting guns.
---
you clearly assume ccp wouldn't be idiotic enough to include this as an actual intended part of the gameplay
---
People take things too personally - the game needs content and this personal bias everyone puts on every action kind of creates its own meta emo content, but takes away form in game content
---
Adorable
---
Nope. I just wanted to share it with people who also play the game. Sorry you don't like it •-•
---
I see the appeal. But if this ever happened that would be the end of EVE as we know it. We all play EVE because the fact that there are real consequences, stories, and outcomes that have been affected in some way by all of us worldwide for 16 years. 
---
A fresh start of EVE might be a fun experiment and a fun game. But it would no longer feel important. It would no longer be EVE. I doubt the boring parts of the game would hold enough meaning for people to keep it up very long in the fresh start. EVE is sacred because it’s single shard, and because every decision matters.
---
The game isn’t everyone starts at 0 and races to power. The game is finding your place in the world that is. Just like real life. There may be laws, governments, secret societies, inequality, etc that we don’t like, but the game of life and the game of EVE is doing your best in that system.

Exploration yes...but gas mining too. While you are exploring wormholes and come across good gas. Its usually worth mining. The skill requirement is very low to be good at it too.

Kikis are really fun but if you don't have t2 cruisers for every race I'd do those first. The variety and usefulness you get there is really worth it.

I'd use it for skills which you aren't remapped to train as quickly. I'm using mine to get some command burst skills, because I'm not remapped for charisma currently.

gorks comes from "gora" which means "hill". So Chernogorsk = Blackhill

Sunk cost fallacy is the only reason most bitter vets still play.  If you remove all the benefit of that cost most will just quit.

Never warp to the sun at 0... Use unconventional numbers like 277km or 342km. Just set your default warp to distance to something nonsensical.

They are checking out possibilities for a core engine change.
---
I've recently started learning proper game development and one of the most immediately striking things is how easy it is to forget that the players can't read your mind/intentions. 
---
I coded a basic Asteroids clone and as a work around for the player getting spawn killed, dropped a trigger volume that prevents the player from spawn if there's a rock inside of it (so you don't get thunder-dunked by a rock inconveniently sitting on the respawn point). This has the unintended side-effect of sometimes delaying a spawn for 5 to 15 seconds as a rock meanders through the trigger volume (which is confusing/annoying for the player, even though its in their favor). It's now on my list as something to iterate upon.
---
I suspect some of the attitude comes from the same sort of thing. You get massive populations of idiots yelling at you about things that they don't actually know about, it's much easier to assume that they're all wrong and ignore them. Do this for a few weeks, its a habit. And habits are hard to break.

lol wot
---
There are some tackle mobs, but for the most ran site (rock havens) there are at most 3 per wave and its random if they are web or point and they take forever to get to you so they die long before then anyways. Increase wave size to increase tackle mobs and site risk, and buff them elite tackle frigs to go 2.5-3k/s constantly and have both point and web.
---
I consider myself more charitable than that: it's just good geopolitics.

The fact that such realpolitik dominates in a game like that is what is fascinating about it.

This would make more sense if the optimal solution was not "Titans" to literally everything. With or without support. Newbros in ewar frigates were actually helpful once upon a time. Now they are largely not needed.

Haws, at least with their current tracking, were a mistake. AOE DDs were a mistake. I will hold off on soups and normie carriers until we see how their application holds up against cruisers without MWD bonuses.

Never in history has there been a shortage of miners, no matter how badly they are treated. Miners are utterly dependent on the destruction that PvP entails, not the other way around. Additionally, PvPers are capable of PvE when necessary and would be more likely to do it without dedicated subclass of farmers depressing the prices.

Yeah, I’m going to get Caldari cruisers V since we’re switching to eagles, after that I only have gallente left, and that one isn’t really a huge priority because guardians are usually more used than oineroses
---
Well, seeing as it would be step one... I would assume the bot authors would know what will happen next in the patch-game between a developer and their cheats.
---
If you spend all your efforts on an unbreakable bot detection script and wait 15 years, you're going to have to do it all over again. 
---
Anything made by humans can be broken and undone by humans. So you patch one thing a week, small, but enough to force an update for bot authors. Doing so causes a delay in the software deployment, because not everyone will think to update.
---
What was your favorite "Gatekeeping Trivia"-style question that you remember?
---
(serious) If you want to stick as a DUO, and don't want to join an allaince or corp... Your best methods of making isk are probably exploration and day tripping wh space (very carfully) in t3 cruisers
---
Yeah, I'm not trying to hash out the specifics here. I'd prefer to stay on the broad end. Instead of actually writing their bot-fragger script, I was just shitting a few ideas that I've recognized in my gaming career.
---
Ok new question, should it do anything once all of it is complete? It still shows up under suggested in the agency. It seems counter intuitive to leave complete tasks there. And I seem to be getting the same level 1 career agents over and over. I've started 2 of the military ones and they were identical tasks.
---
JDC 5 incoming for me.
---
After Career Agents you want to look for Security, Mining, Distribution, or other agents like that, not anything called Career Agents.
---
How are you warping a nonstandard distance higher than 100?
---
You set your default Warp To distance to a number of your choice.
---
Throwing a player instantly into optimal range of more than 4 heavy neuts?
---
I think I know who is more idiotic here
---
Why can't ccp just make subtle changes to the game fairly regularly ,  ones that a human wouldn't notice or have trouble with, but that would cause computer programs like bots trouble?
---
Doesn't volume 2 go through the Casino War/WWB? I'm disappointed to see he's done with the writing, I sent him a message some time ago and he never contacted me. Being head of Goon military through that time I have a lot of stories that no one else knows and could have offered a lot to this book. Bummer.
---
Ever Rat, like ever? 5 minutes of shooting is nearly an entire site. I'd say if the can detect the bot-fragger after 5 minutes of shooting the fuck out of it, that's a strike, getting you on "the list" of nerds that need to be monitored. Then your client tells CCP your input timings and your online schedule is matched with criteria to see if you are beyond a reasonable doubt a botter.  
---
All this is speculation. What you can/cannot detect is literally unavailable to the public eye.
---
Frankly I don't miss the time when I have to activate guns one by one
---
I prefer F1
---
Put that brain away, the kids are talking.  
---
but really, speculation without access to either a botter's scripts, or CCP's scripts can only get me so far.
---
Fair and balanced
---
I apologize for your inability to read. I’ll pay for your English lessons - hmu in pms :)
---
Alpha clones will ruin the game
---
Rofl loved it.
---
Don't be so naive, wormholer. We pay CCP to develop using our moneys too...
---
I was thinking about this from one of the reaction topics to this topic, so...
---
Does CCP actually have product managers?  Like, any PMs that you met?  I got the impression from some of your comments that they really kinda don't.
---
You gotta try harder trying to raise a unwinnable fight
---
in the same way combat recons don't show on D-Scan, perhaps combat interceptors could not show in local?
---
or change "local" to "region" in nullsec, and "local" to "constellation" in lowsec. a bot that safes up when someone enters region isn't going to be very effective.
---
Right... because having 100 corp members means 100 in fleet :eyeroll:. Shit, 100 people online doesn't even mean 100 people in fleet.
---
He probably just talked with Mittens and then Laz about B-R. Maybe they aren't going to talk too much about the year before the casino war and the war itself.

just because you are able to type in a higher number in doesnt meant it works.. and afaik it never worked with more than 100km
---
And now all of a sudden you realize why I quit recruiting when we let questionable people back in our corp after I screamed hell no
---
you dont...
---
Huh, I know I've been able to set it for more than 100 and have it work at least a few times, could possibly be a bug. Well regardless even under 100 setting it for nonstandard is best.
---
Thought last time mittens refused to talk to him...
---
He probably meant buy orders in the local nullsec system. I'd imagine a new player would be tempted to take 75% of the value immediately than risk hauling the effects to HS for full value.
---
PI alt on your account. That’s 1b more isk on your wallet every month, minimum.
---
 goons evac 6 regions and no one bats an eye... we unanchored a few citadels and everyone loses their minds...  
---
I guess this is what "suffering from success" looks like
---
I feel this so hard. I lived in null sec for about a year and the only truly memorable/enjoyable fight between blocks was a surprise attack from Goons onto a Keepstar with a cruise Raven fleet. (concise action report here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/7xtk67/horde_unpacking_94_keepstar_denied/)
---
The tl;dr is that the frenzy between pinning stuff down for the titans to kill while dodging the smart bombing lokis and not dying was an intense amount of fun and something that just doesn't happen in Eve anymore.
---
Lol ikr
---
I love him! Laylow and capchain are my favourites!

Third PI farm toon sits where profitable to make up difference between sub cost and injector sales.
---
CCplease
---
Tbh low class wormholes aren’t great isk, C4 living with a C5 is much better and you can always roll for new krab holes, you do need at least 2, preferably 4-7 characters on grid though (sites are worth a shitload though).
---
My market transport instawarp Maulus costs 12m lol and it's a shitfit...

I have the ebook version, he sent it out ages ago to backers who backed vol 2. pretty sure a physical copy of both versions are part of the package for people who backed the kickstarter.
---
definitely can't wait to get my hands on a physical copy.
---
It's not an eviction if the defender decides to move before you get there
---
I was hoping the scanning and the exploration minigame would be a good enough touring tests, maybe even usable for anomaly bot-proofing. From what you are saying that does not seem to be the case.
---
I think the only way for this idea to work is if the fake rat is completly undetectable by the bot. Not dying when hp is 0, hp stopping to drop when it shouldn't, repping more than it should, all of these are detectable. How to make it undetectable to a bot but not a problem for real players? I'm not sure
---
Leshaks... Usually.
---
The point isn't about keeping Goons homeless, its about driving people to quit Goons.
---
Corps/People leave if the situation turns to shit. If it kept going there would be a point where Goons would not be able to compete for a long time.
---
I was going to say social skills. Too little for a remap, too high to inject.
---
Yup. As a semi industrialist who has a ton of PVPer friends, watching them all undock in ships tagged "Gummybear Shipyards" for a doomed structure defense was a huge thing for me. 
---
Its about a thing that has an effect. Not everything that has an effect is a keepstar brawl.
---
I joined tnt, they're in the imperium so we're close to goons, great bunch of people
---
I have never mined gas.
---
I’ve mined just about everything other than the new Moon mining feature, but never gas.

I should probably be able to though. I have many harvesting skills.
---
The guy who bank rolled the WWB i knew was to hit 3.5T plus assets.
---
I do have a good argument - your posting history. It’s riddled with numerous fallacies, instances of hypocrisy, contradiction, and general bad design. I don’t have to prove this in a single comment because, well, 99% of the comment replies your posts receive (*some of mine*) have already done that. The shear amount of completely dissected arguments and disproven allegations you have is beyond enough to support the factual statement that is: you are really dumb.
---
This would force a lot of micromanaging by middle management to keep ratters happy.  I don't think it would make the game a better place, just more frustrating.
---
:)
---
It's so bad it's good
---
Then someone defeat our titan ball, we'll either go into out spod rocks or  some will quit because they didn't have enough isk to replace
---
Marshall should be eating donuts :)  
---

---
This. Exactly what I’m doing
---
NPC Stations in Teneriflis?
---
Do you want blue doughnut Imperium + TAPI  with Fraternity? Thats how you get a blue doughnut with Fraternity.
---
Control mechanics need to change. As it stands, small groups can't challenge any larger group because it's directly suicide (the whole entosis a point/capture the hill is just not possible if you don't have a pile of people equal to the other factions to play back-up).
---
Relegating control fights to deadspace pockets with limited entry requirements (i.e. you jump your 5 man fleet into a bubble with only T1 Cruisers vs the 5 man fleet from the otherside) would mitigate some of the overwhelming pressure a large block can exert (there's still the logistics of getting to the pocket gate, the large block probably has the man power to fully blockcade critical systems for a time), but it would severely limit the amount of manpower they can exert directly on the control fight.
---
Okay, have you got evidence that hes talking about selling up?
---
I had a super/titan in PL and dropping its was more laborious than fun. I think i speak for a lot when i say the smaller fishing fleets were more fun. &lt;3 penif
---
Using it to finish up having magic 14 at V
---
More please
---
This was an incredible response.
---
i'm fine with this suggestion.
---
not because of bots, because passive income is kinda bullshit.
---
I back this recommendation. You will love living in delve and you will learn a lot and make a lot of isk. But also having a lot of fun on fleets etc
---
Sure. If you're having fun, stay. 
---
I wouldn't be able to point to anything in particular that CCP is doing to help this play style, though.
---
My information would be five years out of date. ;-)
---
That said, I think this would be a wonderful question to ask some devs at the next couple of player gatherings or the like.
---
I think that is exactly what they said about NC (without the dot) a couple of months before its demise... Luckily eve is a fluid game.
---
but it into mining.
---
Why would he do that? I bet he is making money with EVE (not necessarily saying he is getting a cut of RMT, but he might). For example INN has a decent number of followers both on twitch and the website, I doubt all the income goes to support the Imperium infrastructure outside of the game.
---
can we name it the Zyborne Clock wiki
---
1) not a shortage, but supply of ships hasn’t been this high before, and stockpiles are good for your continued pvp interests
---
2) wrong, pvpers are dependent on industrialists to make them the better ships that aren’t seeded by NPCs. Even if you’re ok with using t1 frigates and cruisers, it’s going to take you forever to down anything relatively large without numbers larger than “small gang”
---
3) “when necessary” means you’re too late and now you’re playing catch-up 
---
Obviously goonswarm understood this or else NC/PL/TAPI/whoever would be able to do something about us instead of boarding up their structures when they think goonswarm is coming to town
---
What the *naff* is a skybox?

You’re probably right, but that would just make it funnier if he self-owned for the memes

50 bil would be (a crap ton) for me.  Most I think I've had personally is like 5+ without looking.   Though with folks being able to afk rorq and such my guess a lot of folks will say Trillions.

Don't join either. Go join a smaller corp or alliance.

My reasons vary, but they include competence, personal experience, membership quality, individual leaders, predictability, and overall trustworthiness. Some alliances on this list would dramatically change in standing depending on 1 person. Others I view as being so hopelessly sycophantic and/or stupid that I wouldn't want to rely on them for anything. I didn't comment on SNUFF because I'm in the alliance and that would be too biased. :)
---
The one about HACs has always stuck with me because of how random it was.
---
I've been locked in a proper travel ares (1.6 align) twice.   Chances are low, but not zero.  I think a gate camp specifically set up to catch travel ceptors with remote sebos can catch you about 20% of the time.  And the chance of running into a proper gate camp like that is much lower than that. 
---
It can be done.  Just don't put 20b of blueprints in a travel ceptor.
---
Evemarketer is delayed, usually not my by much. But sometimes enough to have it skewed from in game prices. I belive you can get more accurate pulls using ESI. There is a GESI plug in for Googlesheets you can download.

They do, sort of, or did. This one is actually answered in the [CSM 8 Summer Summit Minutes](https://www.eveonline.com/article/csm8-meeting-minutes-published), in the first section.
---
I actually pushed for this session pretty hard with Seagull because I wanted the players to understand how CCP was organized as I learned the organizational structure myself. As you can see from the description and the diagram on this session (I did both of these), CCP had both Managers and Directors. The managers oversaw individual development chains. The directors oversaw overall elements of EVE (so there was an Art Director who would oversee EVE's art style, for instance).
---
At the time, the organization was actually pretty top-heavy, but that's quite common with Agile/Scrum development shops. You need a lot of people in the middle to keep communication between teams going.
---
What if Triglavians invade delve and wreck everything? What if TEST or SNUFF flip sides? What if INIT decides to backstab? What if a RL millionaire decides that enough is enough. What if CCP introduces a mechanic which drastically nerfs infinite anom spawns in a region forcing everyone to spread out? What if new aoe weapons come out that can take out supers and titans en masse ( which can radically change the current blobbing meta)?
---
Stock pile them and never use them because ~reasons
---
I would look into daytripping in wh space. Possible c3 sites. Google it for more info :)
---
Thank you, I'll look into that.
---
The main advantage of Karmafleet is that it is Goons. The main disadvantage is also that it is Goons. Seriously though, if you goal is to be more then just another line member, look for a smaller corp where you can easily play more of a role then just an F1 monkey. If you are dead set on one of those two though, I'd recommend Horde, they tend to get fun fights in their own space as they have a culture of not just dropping caps on anything that moves (not to say they won't drop caps though). Plus, they aren't Goons.
---
Empires of Eve 1 was never that good in the technical aspects either...
---
Tbh I don't really mind being another number in the fleet honestly, at least rn. Later I'll probably join smaller I'd just like to see how null is with a big alliance
---
Tbh a lot of what I'm hearing is what I suspect of CCP.  Doesn't stop me feeling sad and frustrated about it.  Having played for 14 years I just find eve going the way of the Chinese server and I can see why now when CCP simply dont care and dont listen...
---
EVE needs big investment in lots of different places.
---
Questions  from me
---
What happened to the regular decent updates and why did the big expansions stop.  Because that's what we all used to look forward to.
---
All we get now are shitty updates...its like the passion has just disappeared in CCP offices.
---
Deja Vu
---
Miners win the game.
---
*multi-dollar media empire jokes go here*
---
Never heard of point of no return before. Can someone fill me in.
---
By just putting initiative in its title you lost all the panfam contributing :D
---
Goons also offer amazing srp even for solo losses
---
10 trillions. It is quite common to have 500b-1t nowadays, so 10 trillions starts the ball rolling for me.
---
Join Karmafleet - they are about to win a war ;)  
---
Srly, this will be an extremely interesting time in Goons. And if you don't like it, you can simply join Horde afterwards ;)
---
You are drowning in koolaid my friend, if you actually believe anything of what you are saying.
---
Small vs big is always a topic when it comes to these kind of posts.   
---
Both have their advantages, but I think the biggest misconception is, that you will always be a nobody and won't find friends in big groups. That is, of course, not true. You have to be a little bit more actively engaging as in a smaller group, that's all.
---
Fucking Garmon in the background :^)

I love how your overview is so horrendously organized that you have wrecks as top priority. Way to be a quintessential goon.

Worth noting that "klava" meaning "a keyboard" is a slang in its own right. Originally it's (most commonly) a shorthand for Klavdiya (Claudia).
---
You are absolutely right, sir.
---
Is this a trolling bait post? There is no way you are going to get a straight answer to this question. Propoganda and bias are part of eve every bit as much as breathing if part of being alive. Even asking outsiders is a horrible idea because there are non. There are only 3 types of eve players. Those friendly/loyal to panfam, those friendly/loyal to Imperium, and wormholers who hate both groups slightly less than they hate themselves.
---
In the event this isn't a troll post the only  thing I can say is it all comes down to culture. 
---
If you want to be cream of the shit, top ace, best of the best, an elite pvper that cares about kill boards then Horde is the route to go. If "skill" and ego are your thing they will help you stroke it with solid meta narratives of being the gud guys.
---
If you just want to play the game your way and you don't give 2 damns about a kill board score then consider coming to KarmaFleet. We dont care about "good fights", we enjoy bathing in salt, and every once and a while we might just drop a dozen titans on a frigate because we can. If you've ever wanted to tell the world to eat your ass then I have 3 words for you: KarmaFleet is recruiting.

---
meh
---
Luxury Yacht is difficult to get to sub 2sec.
---
Iirc it takes some very bling istabs.
---
Virtually all of the problem's in nullsec in EVE all center around scarcity of resources, or rather the total lack thereof. I do agree with the general idea.
---
This isnt that terrible of an idea. It would force renters to not just spread out different systems, but also different regions. That is, up to the point the same renters are in all of eve in different renting regions.
---
Alliances would lose a big income source I'm sure
---
Underrated comment. THIS is a great describtion of how to enjoy EVE (next to the big Empires).
---
I wonder how many freighters Fuzzmeister seeded on the webpage before going live...
---
Yes, EVE had a real TCG  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eve:\_The\_Second\_Genesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eve:_The_Second_Genesis)
---
It sounds like you might have tried most of the pve options, based on what you said about beating the game. The only thing left, and honestly 90% of the game, is pvp. Killing or being killed. Being part of one group trying to kill another. Eve isn't a single player game so of course you feel bored. If you want to enjoy eve to its fullest, the way it was created to be played, you have to join a corp and work with other players. If that isn't for you then neither is eve and its just a matter of time before you walk away. If that's the case just go now and save yourself time.
---
Yup, there are good reasons to join Goons, but I wouldn't be a member of r/eve if I didn't post at least the occasional grr goons.
---
There is nothing casual in the level of organisation in GSF.
---
"They took one WH, so they are the dominant power. They put up a Keepstar in HS, so they are the dominant power."  
---
OP just looks for ways to roll over and die...
---
How do you play the game with these without fear of losing them?
---
Goons failed to to mitigate those fleets. At least they tryed it in a fight in HED-GP which endet in a disaster and got 300+ dreads killed. To be fair it could have worked but tidi was on our side in this fight and they had HUGE problems with loading grid and stuff. And the carriers itself didnt do much damage vs the landing dreads... it was just a titans doomsday everything party. Doomsdays where to only thing kind a working in this situation.
---
Same fail on our side where the B-R slugfest where we fucked up and trying to remove dreads while they just foucsed our titans from the start. This counts aswell for the carriers there... we where basicly floating useless around unable to do something.
---
Drone Interfacing 5 and heavy drone 5 for me because I'm noob. P.S. I'm a hot girl IRL looking for a wealthy benefactor.
---
Totally agree with this. Despite the internal problems they had, they just missed to adapt. If you rest on your old wins, you won't create any new ones.
---

The towers that are used to moonlock wormholes are stronted so that it's easier to turn them on when they're needed, but left offline so they don't use fuel. But if they aren't online with a force field then they don't get an RF timer
---
Get rid of NPC-bounties altogether.
---
You switch clones when online
---
Respawn rate change just lower the people per system if you crab 24/7, it addresses on a small scale that people need more systems but nothing else.
---
While i assume that there is lots of people in eve which love to spreadsheet the F out of it, i guess a common approach would be to assign krabbing constellation instead systems to people. For the ratter this means that he needs sometimes to take a jump or two after downtime.
---
PL/NC made a huge mistake when they decided to go after TEST after The Casino War.   TEST made a great decision to move south.  They have since flourished.  Now that NC/PL don't have the largest fleet anymore they just take their ball and go home.   That's how you elite pvp.
---
Ah right, our Sigs &amp; Squads that terrorize the north since the treaty ended aren't doing any kind of PVP?
---
Training clones - Switch to a less valuable clone if you might get bubbled
---
I thought the Keepstar in Perimeter was from TAPI
---
But you already captioned it
---
I don't remember if that was the name. Even so, it just might have showed that as the name for the deep darkness of space I ended up in.

that makes sense. With max rank infomorphy synchronizing what is the CD on jumping?

Join karmafleet. We do literally everything better. Also you wont farmed every other week by your "allies".
---
No cooldown if you switch clones in the same citadel my dude.

lol

Interestingly many people still don't know. If you jump clone within the same station, clone jump cooldown is not started.
---
This is my pick for #1 as well there's a reason they aren't around anymore.
---
I warp to the sun at 0 they won’t expect it
---
It is and I never said otherwise. It was more about the strange idea of dominance of all systems of a kind by ruling just one.
---
It almosts seems like OP has no idea of EVE and just took a super quick explanation by someone who played EVE in HS for a month ^^
---
hay if panfam dies then test is next.
---
Indeed its a bug. Happend to be able to do so once or twice. Showed it to other people. Tryed to replicate it, no luck... Its like a one in one million that it accepts larger numbers.
---
Imagine believing this
---
I want I want, they should totally do that again
---
Find a corp and socialize! Socializing **is** EVE. Go on /r/evejobs  (Join fweddit tho tbh)
---
welp, i know where i will be spending my points now.
---
Both are perfectly fine. In my experience horde has more of a teaching focus but is a little stricter on what you can do, and Karmafleet is much more freeform.
---
So basically, do you thrive with structure or in a freeform environment?

Correct me if I'm wrong, but this only works on player owned stations. NPC stations don't care, and you'll get the cooldown.

Okay, let's simplify: "AoE"
---
That's how you counter N+1.
---
This is not nullsec content
---
Make an AHK that clicks between every X and Y sec, hover your mouse over the warp button and done.
---
Afaik bannable though.
---
Well deserved +1

Rally points give the 6/10 escalations and can be run in a couple of minutes in a smart bombing battleship.

PVE is at best half the game, and its the shitty half at that, find a corp, preferably in nullsec or wormhole space avoid renter groups like the fucking plague and start PVPing
---
Correct
---
that is correct.
---
I only put one up, to make sure everything was still working.
---
Set your own goals or quit.
---
Karmafleet Takes ages to get in, waiting for days to be accepted...
---
As a new player this is a long time
---
Ok E1...creepy as fuck
---
Not on fleets. But between fleets one of those has a whole lot more pvp going on than the other two
---
Bots will drop off Overseers after every site, 1:30 to drop and 1:30 back at worst. Hurts their ticks a little bit, but otherwise a minor nuisance.
---
That's fair enough. A good set of scanning skills is an absolute requirement, as well as cloaking IV. 
---
Beyond that, if your ship can comfortably fit a probe launcher and preferably covert cloak, you're good to go.
---
I'd train towards flying a decent covert ops frigate fit or an Astero. Plenty of ISK to be made in exploration without suffering the mind-numbing boredom of ratting or mining.
---
I've been living in the Drone Region for 1 1/2 years. Let me tell you, you don't want to be there.  
---
Renters everywhere, nobody cares for his neighbour, when you want to get content (in case you don't find a juicy wormhole), have fun traveling 25 or more jumps.  
---
PvE is super easy, those NPCs don't repair themself. So you might even be able to kill ships, by dealing 1dps (yes, would take an eternity, but they'd die).  
---
I'm super happy I moved out.
---
Karmafleet is a pain in the ass to get into, even if you decide you want to join you might be rejected if you have anything fishy in your API. However, they’re also goons so they have really safe rating areas and good SRP. 
---
Horde is the opposite in many ways. Extremely easy to get into, just apply in game and wait a couple hours, no API needed. Downsides are worse SRP and less safe rating, but the upside is that we live in the most active nullsec region for pvp. Our standing fleet has something to do almost 24/7 just flying around tackling and killing everything from decent sized fleets to solo hunters. I’ve moved around quite a bit and no where else comes close to what Horde has.
---
Because of the way how EvE can be played with only hotkeys, it´s really easy to write a bot. I only have basic skills in coding, but even I was able to code myself a mining bot just using AutoIt to click on certain positions on the screen, and OCR to find what I need to click.   
---
Now, this was of course primitive and I only used it on one account, but like this I could leave my Hulk mining all night, flying between Station and Bookmarks on its own, locking up roid, approach and activate Mining Laser. Should add that this was at a time before the mining barge rework
---
Don't like it as much. :)
---
So safe he couldn't even get there.
---
Depends, lvl4 missions vary in difficulty quite a lot. Easier lvl4 are semi-doable in a battlecruiser or VNI, harder with well-fitted battleship. 
---
Also depends on who you go against.
---
I just keep them on there for just in case, but the reality is im probably not going to use them.
---
L4 Burners, fly in daredevil pairs.
---
Amazing. Nubees have no fucking cue where they come from or how they got there.
---
Too vague to be an argument mate, let alone a good one. This is just more hate spewing and shit slinging. I can make toxic allegations about your posting history as well. 
---
Show me something specific. I'm pretty sure I'm right in whatever you can pull up. My reddit history can be summarized by getting shat on by carebears like you while being right.
---
I think it would already help when it would be easier to hunt down those bots. Ideas like a delayed local would come to mind, but something else I oftne was thingking about was a slight change of the warp mechanic. If I´m not mistaken, as it is now, when someone goes to warp, he will land on his target location, no matter if a bubble has been opened or not (I don´t think that has been changed). I´ve seen a lot of ships just warp straight through bubbles because it was opened too late, and this makes it almost impossible to catch bots who initiate warp the moment someone else is showing up in local. 
---
So, if it would be changed so that they would react to a bubble mid warp, I think it would at least help to hunt them down, as bot hunters already know most of the time where said bots would warp to, but can´t prevent them

Honestly, the editing in this is all over the place and the fights are not very interesting. The last few minutes were ~3 different fights edited together in a confusing manner where nothing ended up dying? 
---
The Stratios should not have such a hard time killing VNIs, you may want to revisit your fit.
---
Don't need a overview when you're just another worthless f1 pusher
---
Thank you! I have a decently fitted battleship I get around 900dps and I use faction-specific hardeners. I think I get 84% resistance in all of the armor resist depending on what hardeners I use, it may be 83% for explosive, I'll have to check. I heard the blockade missions are the hardest? So I am mostly just wandering if my tank could hold for that. I can tank every room in the 5/10 sansha without my tank coming close to being broken. 
---
I prefer defense over damage is why I am asking. I heard having a split dps and tank equaling 1000 is all you really need and since my dps is around 900 and tank seems decent enough
---
are you overestimating as you need to hide wrecks while F1ing ?
---
Tengu is good for nullsec exploration. Pretty much every camper will just ignore you because barely any of them plan to fight something bigger than an astero. 
---
WH exploration is still dangerous because of neuting Stratioses, though. 
---
Also, the sleeper relic/data sites are actually just combat sites, they have nothing to do with exploration really. If you want to run those then you need a completely different fit and strategy than for exploration.
---
https://eve-missions.blogspot.com/p/mission-list.html
---
Is a good cheat table for missions and couple of other resources can be found online. Most of the missions have contents listed, so you can see what will be waiting for you. 
---
I would say around 1000dps should be ok for lvl4's and a decent tank, which you seem to have. Yeah, you should have no problems in lvl4 as long as you use hardeners and damage to match te rats. :)
---
I love you hahahha.....
---
If you've ever wanted to tell the world to eat your ass then I have 3 words for you: KarmaFleet is recruiting.!!!!!!!
---
Triglavian incursions are coming, I'd wait for this feature and stable fleet doctrines to farm them, then invest free SP to a format ship(s). If you interested in such kind of PvE.
---
Wasn't in BoB at the time but would be amazed if morale didn't take a big hit there though, losing so much due to one person's betrayal.
---
Loots and Bounties diminish regionally as it gets farmed more and more.
---
Super coalitions are boring.  And that's coming from a member of goonswarm. Where is the fun in absolute victory. Fun is in the risk
---
If you are a new bro, it doesn't change anything for you to join either of those alliances.
---
This is only true if a playerowned structure. Not NPC stations.
---
Ye iam a newbro who whaled a bit to catch up in skills to be a Bit more useful
---
You will loose passive tank gila sooner or later in T4-T5. Use combo tank on full active tank
---
Yea iam a newbro who whaled a Bit to catch up in skills to be more useful and able to pvp and farm isk
---
Just did a couple months in eve Uni and I’m ready to move on to the bigger pvp corps. How do I decided which one I should join?
---
Check out /r/evejobs for some smaller corps as all of the ones you listed are giant.
---
If you want to suggest it, sign in, and create it.
---
Everything past the first paragraph was pretty much tongue in cheek. You are right there isn't much of a real difference. It's all about finding the group that fits you and makes you feel like you are among friends.
---
probably panfam is the just one of those etinity's which stand for their word when saying our partnership is only an temp. partnership in the first place.
---
I personaly liked to be blue with CO2 and Test. But to be fair it had a to bad outcome for eve in total. Guess what would have been when we as an alliance followed goons down south directly. Things wouldnt have changed and we still where the blue donut coalition we get called every now and then. 
---
So i didnt like the desition but could understand it.
---
now its basicly brawl till goons join the party with full force and then stand down.
---
Well PH is bit bad for newbies. Look how many inactive people they constantly purge.
---
if your determined to join one of the big ones, just pick one, it doesn't matter at all. 
---
If you actually want to enjoy eve, spend some time finding a group you like
---
Everything past my first paragraph was mostly tongue in cheek. You are correct there isn't much of a difference. They are no pros or cons. It's all about who fits your personality better and which group makes you more friends.
---
Purge? To kick inactive players sounds right for me
---
Is a big corp a bad thing?
---
Well yes, but those are significant numbers. Something is wrong if so many new people joining your group go inactive (aka quit EvE).
---
Which just means they have plenty of people afking which is only because plenty of people join it because of how easy it is to join.
---
Hard to find some if u have to wait ages
---
U think its cause of them?
---
what things to be specific?
---
There are no reasonable buy order ?
---
Most important point is where do you want to live :
---
- LS
---
- NS
---
- WH
---
All type of space offer different options starting from there.
---
Well if you rly want to know my opinion - all newbies should land in groups like EVE UNI and not in nullsec blocks , and yes i assume that it is caused by them.          
---
Throw in a random char in PH and see what is happening in there.          
---
A well "established" player can be lost in the chaos ... and newbie is lost since the beginning.
---
This is a copy / pasted message, but fell free to answer it if you have any questions.
---
First of all, take the time to do the career agent missions. It will show you many things in the game (exploration, mining, industry, hauling, etc).
---
Then, well Eve is a sandbox, so you will need to figure out what you want to do. As a new player, you are not strictly limited, but what ever you do, Eve can be dull and boring, mechanics are complex at first because of the amount of informations you need to learn but once you understand them it's generally a lot easier. What ever you want to do, try to have fun or enjoy the complex interactions mechanics are creating, so basically don't grind isk for the sake of grinding isk.
---
- Want to explore the stars alone ? Buy an exploration frigate, a cloaking device and go around the stars looking for data and relic sties. Maybe join a wormhole corp and enjoy space where frontiers change everyday, and need scanning on a daily basis. There are some newbie friendly wormhole corps that can teach you the way of Bob.
---
- Want to join one of the large nullsec empire ? Join TEST, Pandemic Horde, Karmafleet or Brave. They are all well known newbie friendly corporation/alliance and they will give you free ships, a place in fleet, and people are generally willing to teach you. They also offer good opportunities for new players to make isk (exploration and salvaging mainly).
---
- Overwhelmed by large organizations but still want to join an active PvP corp ? Try and look for a small faction warfare corp or alliance, there are plenty of them and they will also guide you, get you a place in fleet and you will enjoy endless content.
---
- Want to settle in a bit more in "security" ? Run some combat mission in HS. But try not to do that, really.
---
- Want to become the space Rockefeller ? Look into market, region trading, and all the shit. You won't blow space ships but if you enjoy raw data, data analysis (like, real data analysis) this is your thing. Isk revenue is potentially infinite.
---
- Want to mine rocks and turn them into modules, ships, ammunition ? Start mining and industry. Pro tip, don't do it alone in HS you don't have a single chance, join Goons (= Karmafleet), nullsec have way more valuable ore and Goons are basically the safest most organized industry in the game. You can also join some renter corp but that's up to you.
---
- Want to build your own corp ? Build it with some friends, maybe to do industry, or PvE, or PvP. My 5 isk : FW is a really good way to make isk and have some fight for new players. Low class WH can also be interesting.
---
A short list of advice :
---
- [This is your bible](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page)
---
- Right clic EVERYTHING.
---
- Eve is a sand box, figure out what you want to have fun doing and don't bother what other thinks. There is no right way to play Eve.
---
- Faction do not matter. Pick one you feels seems cool and then ignore it for ever since you can fly any ship of any faction without any difference.
---
- Eve is also a dangerous game. Don't use ships you can't afford to loose. Both players and NPCs can wreck you quite fast, even later in the game when you will fly big expensive ships.
---
- People will kill you. No matter where you are, people can and will kill you, even in high security space. HS is actually the worst place to be, because you think everyone is friendly when it's really not the case. Outside, it's a lot more easier, everyone is your enemy.
---
- The very same people that will kill you can also be the same people that will explain to you why you died if you ask them. People in the game are generally friendly and don't mind teaching new players.
---
- Don't get attached to your ships.
---
- Eve shine when played with other people. Don't be afraid of recruitment policies, knock at the door, join a corp, have fun with others.
---
- Learn of your mistakes, don't get angry. If you died, it's your fault.
---
- r/evenewbies it's a good place to ask stupid question. r/evejobs it's a good place to look for a corp.
---
95% of isk making is done solo. I would advise to go for abyssal sites.
---
I wanna try nullsec looks for me the most fun and most rewarding in form of isk
---
My passive Gila fit has yet to be close to die in T4 Gamma.
---
I know people that have went so far into making undetectable macros that they were at some point looking at directx call interception. Yeah, I'm sure writing "an entirely new detection method" will fool them. lol
---
&gt;its a sandbox and building shit to win with isn't exactly rocket science.   The irony here is TEST is the only one who saw this coming and said goons will just go south and rebuild stronger than before...   Yet TEST was the only one that followed.
---
I actually don’t know what’s a reasonable buyer price, since this is the first time I sell large amount of lp. For small amount it is slower but the rate will be much better.
---
Sonic vs Shadow?
---
Happy days!
---
&gt; I mentioned that some things still remain to be done, but what sorts of things? For starters the manuscript isn't officially complete yet. There's still a segment of the book that I've been waiting to tackle until I've done more interviews and had a chance to read more materials. Once I begin writing it will likely only take a few days to get everything down on paper. But because it's the last segment of the book, I decided to do a complete edit pass on the first 5/6 of the book before writing that final portion. My hope is that this will give me a strong sense of what the story still needs to accomplish in its final act, and what sort of resolution we need to see.
---
What is reading comprehension?
---
Well you are also discounting the ease it takes to get into pandemic horde, you just click apply and you in within a hour. It's the easiest null corp to get into, that part will definitely factor into things.
---
2 skill injectors
---
Their leader calls his members customers. They don't care if people quit the game because of how they are treated, as long as enough people join. Some stay, some move up in Horde and find their home there. A lot of new players however think the way Horde works is how  other alliances work as well and just quit either null or the game as a whole. A good example of practices that turn away newer players is when they at some point encouraged their newbies to camp enemy systems or run streams of enemy stations, they just get bored of the game and leave.
---
I'd say give pandemic horde a go, you will probably be in it within a hour of applying and if you don't like it then you can move on.
---
It's not going to wreck your corp history.
---
The irony of this Kickstarter update being about editing and then this makes it through. RIP
---
JDC V \o/
---
The real answer is join which ever one you want, and see if it's a good fit for you. If it's not, leave and try the other one. If that's also not a good fit, do some more research until you find a group you think you'd like to play with.
---
If the buy price is 10 or 20% percent of the sell price, that's somewhat fair. Bellow, it depends on the volume.
---
Haven’t really tried those yet.
---
What kind of ship would that want?
---
And what kind of fit?
---
2 rorquals into t2 core and some reactions
---
Honey define shit posting... k thanks I got it...
---
Currently, I can't advise for any newby friendly corp :( My advice would be to stay independent and fly with spectre fleet etc until you reach about 20m SP. Then you probably have a good grasp how different groups are and can join them.
---
My alt is in Red Federation best Federation.... Should really log it in sometime
---
There are plenty of ships and its possible. I'm running a [passive gila](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75551705/) for T4 gamma sites, but they are plenty of tutorials available if you search a bit.
---
Yes, karmafleet is one of the best managed corps in goonswarm
---
Sounds like a bad system for me, i wanna learn how the game works and not only how to camp and press F1
---
I remember when BoB owned most of nullsec, then died.
---
  Then Goons owned 2/3 of nullsec after B-R... Then slowly lost when WWB happened.
---
  Then Northern Associates owned most of null, then fozziesov hit causing their sov to drop.
---
  Swings and roundabouts. Someone will fuck up, or some drama will happen and it'll all come crashing down, as is tradition.
---
Maybe you are right
---
Unfortunately, as far as I know, almost all concord products has small volume based on data from fuzzwork website. :(
---
Bit per capita it's been pretty similar.
---
  Render when PL dropped supers *everywhere*? I still get flashbacks
---
did you actually read my post before commenting? 
---
in a "multidimensional" fleet, a newbie can always be useful since there multiple roles which are all importan. can't fly that shiny t2 cruiser yet? fyl a dictor, they are always needed. or fly an interceptor, scout for you fleet. or just grab a t1 ewar frigate and annoy the enemy logis.
---
however, the capital fights under tidi aren't that multidimensional. there is only 1 thing that matters: how many dds can your side launch per cycle. 
---
and with 3 times the titan numbers ( even more when legacy shows up to support their goon parents) the goons clearly win here.
---
you are not completely wrong, of course panfam can and probably will try to fight back and make every timer a pain for the goons. but using tidi, jammers and retarded citedel mechanics to fight a war is not what eve was about back in the day.
---
WOW the salt detector is collapsing already pls stop posting!
---
Heard of it alot but the time waiting is annoying
---
Tell that to CO2
---
Increasingly bored, at worst, mildly hopeful, at best. It's just a game. Let em burn.
---
MFW building ships locally with alliance assets is the cheapest way to get a super fleet. Who'da-thought...
---
I've often heard this idea that if you join Goonswarm you'll be a "F1 monkey" or a "goon". Only follow orders, don't think for yourself etc. but this is comming from people who either can't get passed the name, have never been in Goonswarm or have been in Goonswarm but never actually taken part of the community.
---
While being a F1 monkey is definately possible in Goonswarm it is no more so in Goonswarm than any other large null-sec entity. I can't speak for all other Alliances but in Goonswarm you are actively encouraged to not be a mindless F1 monkey. The problem is that Goonswarm is so big that there will ofc be a lot of members who don't think for themselves.
---
r/eve jobs, fly around in low sec, just play the game and you will find people 
---
If you want speed just apply to horde, they'll accept within a day or two
---
I noobed in a quintessential nobbie way and I lived.
---
You're lucky, kid. I'd rub you on my balls but that noob smell takes forever to go away.
---
Keep exploring. Get an Astero. If you are determined to make live in WH space set up a station and kit it out with what you need or join a WH Corp.
---
Autopiloting is bad, mmkay?
---
If there is low volume sell, there is nothing you can do then. Change your income method to a one that easier to yield isk from and slowly sell your CONCORD LP in the meanwhile.
---
Shield Command 5, here I come.  Charisma skills, ha!
---
Joining Karmafleet is not that bad atm. Since they fixed the website you only need to write your application, add your APIs and then wait a week or so.
---
If those things are too much of a hassle then please go somewhere else because you won't be a good fit.
---
You don't need any SP to "be useful". A T1 ewar frigate can be useful, a small tackle frigate can be useful, etc. Don't waste your time in eve trying to catch up, enjoy the game with what you have.
---
If waiting a week is too much for you please go somewhere else because we'll be better off without you.
---
BoB still control fortress delve with sov 5
---
If you're going to join and see if you fit you should go with Karmafleet first because there will be a lot less hassle joining Horde second than it would be joining first Horde and then later Karmafleet if it turns out you don't like the community.
---
I'm a former goon with 4 years membership
---
  The fuck are you smoking mate?
---
My post was corrected, the "station" part was truly misleading... :)
---
I mean, if you are trying to use war to entice someone to join you it won't work. While Goonswarm might be going to war soon, it's likely Horde will be involved in that war too...
---
I'm surprised if that's still a thing
---
Thx for your advice :)
---
To late i guess 😂
---
Ye serves those dirty pvpers right, stupid mercenaries aren’t even able to change everything that they are to become krabbing mining empire builders. Eve would be different if they’d just blued everyone not in the Imperium and mined for 3 years, eve would be great. Such a shame Panfam aren’t good at diplo. Their leaders must be idiots to think attacking their neighbours was a good idea.
---
"Wormholes were ultimately dominated by the Imperium (Init)."
---
Excuse me sir. I think you missed something. Wormhole space is not just HK.
---
The only Imperium/Goons i met wormhole space, never showed up on their structure timers, always bluballed, cant fight a solo player, seems to not understand how effects in wormhole works, and spread all their RL issues in local.
---
They mostly fly T1 battlecruisers and battleships, they are good customers.
---
Wormhole space is still wild, independant and unconquered because unclaimable.
---
Wormhole space won the game.
---
Lol "make eve like WoW with instanced warzones"
---
How long have you been waiting? Did you just send in An application or die you talk to a recruiter?
---
FoF missiles 5
---
1 week would be okay, but atm there are guys waiting for 4 fucking weeks
---
Hello!      
---
So let me say about terrorists groups that our glorious nation is fighting.           
---
* (mostly) Caldari - those terrorists don't like when you shoot them with Kinetic damage, for some reason they also deal kinetic damage           
---
* Amarr - religious fanatics, don't like EM damage but also deal it.              
---
* Minmatar - slaves of the Amarr, sometimes show up but not so often. They like to blow stuff with explosive damage.             
---
* The ISIS CONCORD - thanks to system wide dampening effects Nation deployed around the Stain. CONCORD is concord within the Stain. Hit them with the biggest damage. They will try to do the same but with the dampeners online they have very limited capabilities.                 
---
* The usual groups like EOM or Rogue Drones - they also show up sometimes. Funny is that CONCORD pay you for killing them.          
---
Ships.    
---
Well, if you want to travel around T3 Cruiser.  
---
If you prefer to prestage ships in systems - then ceptor to move around and Gila/Rattlesnake for maximum terrorist elimination.           
---
Have fun
---
This is really bad advise. Joining a community makes the game a lot easier/faster to learn and you can always jump ship later if you don't like the community or if you want something else later.
---
It doesn't have to be a nullsec alliance but you should join some kind of community.
---
But... you don't need to invest hat many skill points in the infomorph skills to save jump clone cooldown within one citadel :)
---
Get fucked it idiot.  That's not what I meant at all.  EVERY other MMO had multiple instances because of this exact problem.  Also just a side note WoW is million times more popular and successful than EVE let's not forget that. Its dumb fucks like you is why EVE has never grown in years.
---
Talked in their channel and was told to apply on their site stfu and wait until they decided
---
I presume you're a new bro, and after trying several nullsec alliances I suggest TEST.
---
They live in a lovely and profitable space, far from big market hubs but if you're new it's not a big problem because their market is well seeded. 
---
In general they have quite easy doctrines (but you'll find the same in Goons or PH).
---
They have EXCELLENT services that will help you a lot, nice intel, a fantastic wiki that will help you a lot for fits and which skills train for each fit on each doctrine.
---
On this topic I don't know PH, but Goons have a lot of work to do, their wiki is good but 100AU far from Test one, and no Intel map.
---
One important thing to consider imho is that their space is safer and with less neuts moving around. 
---
Some "elite pvp" guy with hundreds of B in the wallet will surely consider this a bad thing because... well grr krabs.. but for a new bro this is very useful if not mandatory imho. 
---
You need time and resources to grown, you'll have plenty if fleets but you must have the resources to pay for your ships and your objectives.
---
This doesn't mean farm 24/7 like a bot, you still have Catch just in the neighborhood with plenty of pvp, but imho it's important
---
&gt; Moons are worth more than they used to be - just isn't passive income anymore.
---
That was exactly my point?  
---
The old playstyle of owning moons because you were able to defend them without actually having to live in the area is dead.  
---
Now you have to be there and actually mine every moon that pops. That means you need Rorq alts if you want to do it in a reasonable time. That means you need to be able to defend these Rorqs. That means you can't just deploy somewhere without taking on a significant hit to your economy.  
---
Once again, whether you think those changes are for better or worse, the old playstyle of wandering about the universe relying on passive moon income *is* dead.
---
Buy Implants to Concord, Sell them to Jita.
---
Check the price of implants, 150k SP + 150 Million, most of them are about 500M to buy at Jita.
---
Ohhhh i see, goonswarm is going to war tomorrow so they are probably just doing more security checks, and they could also have more aplicants that want to join the war
---
There's a tradeoff to be made when it comes to getting into these two. It's easy to get into Horde, ingame app and you're in. So is every spy and awoxer and you can't trust your corpmates. The waiting time to get into KarmaFleet means you have be patient for a while, but this ultimately raises the bar for awoxers and protects you once you're in.
---
Its not worth the wait
---
That is the pointno one understand's!
---
No Superblob want's and will realy kill the other superblop. This is the reason that we didnt follow goons south combined with the part of it, that we dont be blue forever when have goons evicted. Reddit was going crazy as fuck cause yeah you just say so and keep blue forever and poor goons bla bla bla... there are a shit ton of redditposts about just this.... but guess what. We didnt. We did what we told others in the first place. The desicion being Co2 the puching ball was dumb in my opinion and i didnt like it... id rather had shooten Sort GOTG and kept test and co2 bule ... but then we to had been a power to strong so no one would fight us anymore.
---
Goons just archievt this problem now that their weight is just too much for everyone. And so no one will fight them anymore. they can seriously move 2000 Titans to a location and have 2000 in reserve... but all they will shoot is structures or maybe a dreadbomb or two... thats it.
---
They do not give a shit about the overall health of this game ... so no ?
---
this is delightfully stupid
---
Purging inactive Players is normal.
---
Telling someone that all this chars get inactive because they joined PH is just a normal Stainguy post.
---
Just Ignore him. If you wanna do alot of Fleets with content for Newbies in Ships you can instantly fly...
---
Give Pandemic Horde a chance. If you dont like it, just go to search another Alliance.
---
But 70% of the Ppl stay in PH because PH is a good alliance ;-)
---
&gt; The fuck are you sperging on about you retard?
---
Says the sperging retard -.- ... calm down kiddo
---
This is absolute garbage... I love it... Take your filthy karma you fabulous bastard!
---
I'm aware.
---
I used to run them in a 2.5 bil mach. It took 4 minutes to complete a site.
---
Now, I run them in a 12 million isk vexor, due to the fact it takes 35 minutes to respawn.
---
A-Types EANM and Invul field will reach 3 bil easily with that massive nerf.
---
Than they could Tell me dont they?
---
That's not true. That's like saying you've tried every kind of Ice cream if you've tried vanilla.
---
There are more to Eve than the PvE you can take part of the first couple of weeks in the game, you just need to find something to do while you wait for skills to do more advanced things.
---
How much do you make in one of those sites?
---
/ballpark figure
---
It's very wild, depends on the sell price of the items and you have to take into account the price of the filament. On average I was making 40M per site, but you can get random skill books or filament that can be worth 100M+ so it's really random.
---
1:1300 is a fair rate, don't sell under 1:1200
---
If it have taken 4 weeks now there's probably something wrong that's making it take that long. They should politely ask a recruiter if there's something wrong with their application. Just make sure they don't make it sound like a complaint.
---
Buy land, buy land...fuck spinnin rims!
---
casino war to today would make a good volume 3 tho
---
Not necessarily, especially if it's your thing, but generally new people or new to nullsec tend to be pushed into big corporations no matter what. Variety ~~is~~ used to be one of the selling points of EVE.
---
The answers are always the same, its done when its done, and if u ask again u have to wait Even longer
---
Burn them all
---
Those sells really really slow though...
---
I dont care if the Corp is big or small, just want to learn how the Game works and Play with others instead of Solo all the time
---
Oh, is it? Thx for the info
---
Really nice video, thanks for uploading. Fuck the haters.
---
I think they're suggesting NPC buy orders at fixed price. Could be wrong.
---
the wristwatch is a nice touch.
---
ALWAYS
---
i do 'immediate sell' for these, the difference between sell and buy order is not much.
---
&gt; I know that there are a lot of "Corporations" that like to get new players but i think that that also is not different from what i have been doing this time.
---
It is so different that we might as well say that up until now you've been just playing an extended tutorial. Indeed, technically it's the same, you undock, do your stuff, dock again (one way or another), but if you are in an organised corporation, you typically have a **purpose**, which makes the game about 100x more engaging. Aditionally, flying in a fleet is very different from flying alone - people actually rely on you, especially if you're something more than just another DPS.
---
Hey Jester. I’m a bit late to the party. 
---
Te discriminative culture at the company has unfortunately been reported to me (I am not allowed to publicly say by who).
---
Many thanks for all your cards-on-the-table feedback.
---
Not fully true, people who take uncalculatable risks died out.
---
Smart people taking calculated risks rule the (economic) world
---
Well, but Karmafleet will most likely be on the winning side :P
---
Nah, what I meant is, that the Imperium is very awesome to watch when it is deploying. :)
---
Yea this was pretty good better than that meme fleet stuff
---
In that case I'd suggest to post a thread in r/evejobs while waiting for karmafleet, maybe you'll get even better offers.  Karmafleet itself is not a bad corp though, one of the most active in Goons.
---
Sell to buy orders.
---
Selling with sell orders doesn't really increase your isk/lp. You are making money .01ing orders which you could do for anything
---
I dont want to corp switch all the time
---
The devs actually did the opposite of some of these things:
---
&gt;*Decreased safety of large-scale deployment bases, preventing content-denial tactics
---
&gt;*Pretty much anything that decreases instantaneous force projection (teleportation)
---
&gt;*Depleting resources that force moving and spreading out, decreasing localized power
---
&gt;*Structure sabotage, siphon, hacking, and theft mechanics that punish structure overreach
---
Not anymore.
---
As the number of active players continues to decrease there simply won't be enough people to take you guys on.
---
I would hazard a guess that if you count how many players actively live in null sec, Goonswarm would have the highest number of players.
---
Those are some great looking screenshots, the Typhoon and Machariel look awesome. Makes me wonder if Id be better off grabbing two 27" monitors, first world problems.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Nice looking case, does it not getting annoying/loud with all those fans and RGB in your face?
---
so having enemies would cost me isk? sounds counterproductive to your original argument.
---
You do know that social Darwinism isn't a real thing right? The social sciences community has largely moved away from it ever being real. An argument can be made that it is in eve though because the devs created it to work like that, but I don't think that is what you mean.
---
Join the channel "concord lp"
---
Thank for tip I know am dumb will try 2 learn :Þ
---
Also, I don't have all the time in the world, and the discovery of the autopilot makes my life so much easier, so I don't see the negatives of using it for long distances &gt;.&gt;
---
Thanks, I appreciate it.
---
I’m going to have to look into that.
---
Currently I’m mining. I’m always going to make a boatload of money [I was ISK poor a while back but it’s ticking along nicely], it’s just not very fast. Why do I mine? I have a thing for having a great deal of ore in the hangar. Why is that? I do not know.
---
Gank miners, they love it!
---
LOL
---
With all respect for Icelandic people, the total population of this country is 300K. Learning a language spoken by less people than a small city is absurd.
---
CCP should move to a EU country or the US. I.e. in a trade zone with a strong and stable economy, with a stable currency, and most importantly, a place which is attractive for potential 
---
God knows how many talented people will not want to work for CCP simply for the fact it is located on a rock in the polar circle where the cost of living is 3 times western standards.
---
Leave out jump fatigue (Phoebe 2013), after its implementation EVE was at the healthiest state ever, most logged in accounts, most destroyed assets, most cap-brawls in Lowsec ever, regional resource control without a single force dominating ALL lowsec with infinite force projection
---
Pacifier with hypers is my go to currently.
---
I have an alt that still has SP from when they refunded Learning skills :D 5.5mil unallocated and not applied the stuff from this giveaway (or Christmas actually, still got that in my redeeming queue)
---
The queue for Avengers Endgame was too long so I went and sat in a public toilet for 3 hours instead
---
He has secret access to the decloacer module!
---
If you don't have something you're specifically training into, I think this is the right thing to do. Save the points for one of those "ow shit, I can't fly that moments", use a few points and continue with what you were doing
---
extract -&gt; sell injectors -&gt; RMT the ISK (the way of the Mango)
---
That's why i joined smaller ones i don't like big ones i felt always like a number instead of someone.
---
Define winning a war for a line member. If it means getting blue balled 90% of the time grinding structures, I honestly do not believe a new player would experience that as "Winning".
---
So u say other corps are shit? 😅
---
buy a webcam and some fresh garden produce
---
Yup, agreed.
---
Like I wrote elsewhere in this topic: CCP should move to a EU country or the US. (in a trade zone with a strong and stable economy, with a stable currency, in a country that doesn’t go bankrupt every 10 years) and most importantly, a place which is attractive for hires. Any EU country (except France, for obvious reasons) would do.
---
Lol
---
It's called a cyno, it's really hard to use.
---
I mean, Toni is one of the nicest guys in the game  if you aren't a shitbird. You being worried about Toni just proves you were going to be a problem.
---
EVE is all about pvp ;) so undock and explode spaceship ;)
---
What I'm saying is that karmafleet membership is like an action packed emotional thrill ride full of highs and lows and that horde membership is like spending 3 hours in a public toilet.
---
&gt; You'd have to be very careful in changing drone aggro. That kind of change could very easily make drones entirely unusable in PVE
---
Not really. Carriers have to deal with this already. This would really only impact AFK PVE.
---
Runescape? That is your goto? You want people with 15 years worth of skillpoints to start over. That is hilarious. You have utterly zero clue.
---
Yes i would play
---
But still I can’t understand why it takes so long to accept my app, it’s just a newbie account with many skill injections to start off well
---
Wow, sorry that you need your hand held. Did you try reading the MOTD of Public Karma?
---
Don't listen to this idiot.
---
They are just talking bad about horde because they are the enemy. It's just the usual bull@#$#. Just try whatever you wanna try and find out yourself if you like it or not.
---
That’s nothing about hand held, and yes ofc I did
---
It wasn't a "PanFam" thread, it was a bait post written by a goon.
---
As is the OP on this thread.
---
Really goonies, try harder with the shitposts. These ones are getting dull.
---
It’s not about holding hand, and yes I read it 😉
---
Why not France?
---
It’s a spoopy place... just like wormholes ;)
---
Bizz
---
Combat recons leaving local would be cool.  Local chat to region I'm more meh about because it makes it more difficult for fleets to collide while the main problem seems to be the initial tackle and small gang hunting.  Good thoughts overall though
---
Yep, because an all volunteer group should drop everything to handle your application. Fuck them actually getting to play Eve ever, it is all about you!
---
We are working as fast as possible, bringing on more people to the team all the time, but burnout is very real. 
---
How can you make the process faster? Easy, be truthful on the application, don't do shady shit, don't try and hide alts, don't be the guy with EULA violations.
---
Please add. Will duplicate everytime someone complains about it.
---
I don't even understand what he is TRYING to tell here.
---
Sounds just like another Thursday for us ;)
---
Karmafleet is going to get blueballed for a month while Horde will just wait and take the fights thay can win. See how easy that was...
---
Salt licorice? Interesting
---
what bpo is worth that much? Not a titan for sure. I thought T2 BPO's devalued thanks to invention?
---
It’s the name that shows up for your location in the in game map if you’re in any wormhole
---
So my app should be easy, 1 char no alts nothing special just a new eve player that invested money in the char to catch up a bit ...
---
Just putting affirmations there doesn’t give me a lot of understanding of what you mean...
---
Why would a passive Gila with High-grade Shield Slaves be in troubles in abyssal deadspace ? And IIRC, neuting will just wreck the capacitor of your ship, even more in T5. You simply won’t be able to run any booster or hardener, and I guess that’s when the ultimate buffer of Gila will come in handy !
---
Maybe it’s damage, but I don’t see where a passive Gila have less DPS than an active one...
---
What this guy is saying is complete bullocks u/stainguy is  r/eve's resident troll.
---
Inactive members are kicked buy you have to be offline for months. We don't do classes like eve uni, but said that is not your style. We do on the job training. 
---
We run a caretaker fleet 24/7 that is completely open coms, if you are unsure of any thing that's where to ask. It is mostly mining, but being we get pvp. Unlike others we fight back and dont just drop supers.
---
Our large pvp fleets normaly have a newbean coms, where there will be simi open coms. There someone will try and help you as much as possible.
---
Most fun - debatable.   
---
Easiest isk for a newbie? Probably.
---
Man, you guys take this far too serious.
---
Nevertheless, the organization of a war in the Imperium is impressive.
---
Thank you (and you even have the fitting name !) ! Since the terrorists can be so varied, I guess I’d have to take a ship with selectable damage, like a Tengu, or Loki/Legion with missile subsystem. I still need to train those however, and I’m closer to an HAM Legion than anything else !
---
I don’t know how I’d get the ships moved in those stations however... And well, if I pick a mission in one system and need to go through three systems since I don’t know where the mission will end up, it can be troublesome...
---
PvP is fun I guess, and isn’t there the most pvp?
---
I thought you could lower it to 5% with skills?
---
Then start telling people to not be cheap and buy plex with the money you earn during your coffee break.
---
mining.  
---
must.  
---
continue.
---
I blame Elo for telling everyone daily on Reddit about how botting was EZ
---
Have so much Isk that you don’t care if you lose them...
---
Beware what you ask for, you may actually get it but not in the way you thought.
---
Thats why you fit 2 cap batteries on a active tank
---
Which mean less tank overall...
---
His biased opinion of other corps aside. Goons do not like spys even more since they are going to war tomorrow vs NC and PH. Every person gets checked over and if you bought things or had isk come in from a strange place for a newbro it will be a red flag. I do not want to call it paranoia because that is just how eve works, every one is a spy and if you think they are not they are just a good spy. On the flip side PH give 0 fucks about spies, we check if you are on a black list of awoks and if not your in. Though this does end up with strange things like the people that we are fighting talk back to us in local because they are on our comms listening to us haha.
---
who the fuck still uses facebook
---
Pretty much this. 
---
Eve is a game where the people really do make the difference and I don't say this in a "Join a guild it's more fun" kinda way like most other MMO's. 
---
It's a sandbox and you have to come up with your own endgame and unless you really like the fairly limited single player stuff it offers, you do need to find a tribe that fits with what you want to do.
---
I'm pretty sure fighters for carriers are no longer auto aggro, only standard drones.
---
Where’s the context tho
---
Use it to go skill yourself.
---
Less tank ? Lol, I have 150+hp/s tank with neut ressist and also I have much lower sig than you, which means I will take less dmg.
---
So if u have a job and money to sink in a game you are redflaged? Maybe talk with the people? If a Corp have no time to recruit they shouldn’t be recruiting
---
Depends what KIND of pvp you want. 
---
I'd say for good quality (no blobs, individual pilots actually matter) pvp WHs have the most/best, followed by lowsec, then nullsec. YMMV.
---
Its like i'm back on Newgrounds
---
I checked those are actually 250k lp plus 250mil...not 150
---
Wanna try it all ☺️
---
You say that but I don't think he actually pushed F1 once, always a mouse click.
---
&gt; result : if you krab too much you start devaluating your own value/h.
---
...that only causes bots to devalue your value/h even more, which only pushes people towards botting.
---
yes, if you are a bot.
---
Make PvE work like PvP.
---
In order to be fair, maybe CCP should implement a bot in Eve for everybody. So the botters don't have an advantage anymore...?
---
Eve is a sandbox, it is easy to get lost in it. You have to decent on your own goals, do you want to fly super caps and one shot other ships, be a leader and run a corp fighting over objectives, pay it forward and help newbros learn the game and find their goals, learn to become a fc and command 100s of other pilots in battle. 
---
My personal goals right now is carriers, i get mine first next week. I also run care taking fleets, mainly mining but i take 90% of fights i can get.
---
If you are not in a corp, then that is where you start. Talk to others and be social. just like a teenager does not know what they want from life yet, you just need to get out there and try every thing and find your place in the world.
---
This comes up so often while it simply isn't true. 
---
There's a few reasons why people shouldn't join us but "You'll just be an F1 monkey" really isn't one of them if someone doesn't want that.
---
If you want to FC, you can from day 1. Sure we won't hand you the keys to the supercap fleet but no group will.
---
If you want to do more behind-the-scenes kinda stuff you can but it'll take some time. No other group will give you that kinda access unless you put some work in either.
---
We also have plenty of smaller peacetime fleets that just go out to kill stuff and / or die. 
---
Honestly the only few reasons people shouldn't join us is when they don't like huge groups, want to be on the underdog team or really think we're all assholes.
---
I doubt there's that much difference culturally between PH and KF so I'd say try both and see what you enjoy most, it's not like you're stuck with your choice.
---
Huh? I'm pretty sure it shouldn't look this way
---
This but stay in because they cool and realize friendship is the best capital you can own.
---
You aren't dumb and stop using anti bully psychology on me, I use it every day 🤣😊
---
The auto leaves you vulnerable to podders and gankers. If you aren't in an expensive pod, then it hardly matters, but then why not just self destruct next time to get back to your home station?
---
I hear you on time. I barely have any either. Explo makes good money but you have to love thay stupid mini game.
---
I hate that stupid mini game.
---
See you in New Eden
---
If you want it fast the dude is right. Check for the implants with highest buy order. Compare to sell orders make sure you’re not screwing yourself. The +5 Implants can go for 500mill Jita  a buy.
---
One of the ideas that I had was to force an ESS into the system if you want bounties. CONCORD isn't out in null sec, why the hell are they issuing bounties without a presence? No destructible ESS? No bounty. That gives hunters a choice of going after the ship, the ESS or both. 
---
It's not perfect, but it could make a difference.
---
It's all worth spending at least a good 6 months doing :) So much content out there, so little time!
---
Some task are not worthy, like in many cases having more pullers will help you to choose the most profitable missions.         
---
Remember that terrorist groups like caldari or amarr drop tags. You will find them in the wrecks ... and trust me you want to pick them up.
---
But you haven’t seen my fit, maybe we have similar signature radius.
---
That is max graphics at 3440x1440, capture of a portion of the screen. That is definitely how it looks to me.
---
Awesome atuff :) I was wondering about the status of this the other day. Sounds great :)
---
Go back to WoW if you love it so much.
---
I guess I’ll have to fly a bit in Stain to learn the ropes of the people living there and how to run nullsec missions :)
---
Maybe finally learn some nullsec PVP along the way too ! With the LP farm, getting Phantasm shouldn’t be so hard, and one day I’ll do my dream of fighting in a Nightmare !
---
&gt;Villlllllllllll**l**y
---
I am in ph i do not know goons exact rules but they try there best to keep spies out. Its not about having no time, the recruiters want to play the game to and not just do admin bullshit for the whole time they are longed in.
---
From their point of view, either you will wait or you didn't really want to join. A good member is also one that is patient whilst admins do there job.
---
[https://dredditisrecruiting.com/](https://dredditisrecruiting.com/)
---
Endurance and Prospect can be fitted to be virtue-only scannable. Thus, you can do mining missions in nullsec without much danger. Accept only gas and ice missions.
---
Classic
---
Thanks ! I’d still need to train up for Expedition Frigates then. What do you mean by virtue-only scannable, please ?
---
Also, how are ISK and LP payouts of high lever mining missions compared to security missions ?
---
3 types of eve players, so very true
---
The rest was a bit meh but hey I’m bias not gunna deny, have an upvote for not being a typical goon :p
---
You can really see the ramp up on the guns. Nice.
---
Aight 🤙
---
To combat probe the frigates, the scanner should have virtue implant set. Without it, no 100% hit can be made on them. You need 2 ECCM scripted sebos and some skills, most notably magnetometric sensor compensation to 3 or 4, i don't remember.
---
ISK/LP payouts differ based on sec status and faction, and on the Mining Connections skill, please check in sisi. I haven't done sansha missions.
---
You don't ask why it's taking so long. Just ask them to check if it's fine or if there's something you've done wrong. Often people feel like they are helping you and are more forthcomming with information and/or they actually notice you. Also, if they've already taken a look at your application it's more likely that they'll come back to it quicker. It's not a guarantee but that kind of question is probably not going to annoy Toni (and/or the other recruiters).
---
What if you never posted again?
---
True but around 4 weeks waiting time is way to high...
---
Projectile Rigging V
---
I'll get the chicken wings
---
&gt; the sov map would have looked very different than it does today.
---
No. The sov-map would look exactly the same, just with different names. So, assume MBC did press their advantage, followed goons and destroyed them after all. We would have the same, stale blue doughnut just in a different order. Sure, a lot of people just wanted to see goons gone, but a lot of them *wanted* goons to rebuild to have something to fight against.
---
Were they underestimating goons and the economic changes? Probably. Was it naive to assume goons would have learned their lesson and suddenly start valuing content over power as well? Definitely. But I don't really see how an EVE without goons would be better than what we have today.
---
No its actually dumb fucks like Hilmar.
---
Sorry my Friend, but You cant really pull this card when NC/PL had a very similar monopoly over the game for nearly a decade. What'd they say when everyone complained? "Git Gud that's how it is! We earned it!" After the **Entire Game** got together to kick the goons out of Deklein you now get to live with the consequences. In this case, the consequence was literally us becoming strong enough to fight the Entire Game.   
---
PS: LOL @ TEST being allies, we have an NIP but they do a better job hunting Delve than NC does.
---
The sad thing is, there are no fights Horde can win. 
---
RIP
---
Talked with someone and he said everything looks fine, so there should be no problem
---
This thread killed my sex drive though
---
Ph and goons are about to go to war this weekend, now is a great time to join. Goons are not here for good fights they are here to be the alpha and wave there massive dicks around. Goons are the bad guys, it is in there ethos. If this sounds like your play style then go for it.
---
Ph try and get good fight, they "try" and be the good guys. The war will be thought on our turf so expect lots of pvp in ph. So we will trying and tech you as much as possible about how to live in hostel space and not die 24/7.
---
Get off my fucking lawn
---
&gt; How else can that opportunity have been missed? The alternative view is, of course, that the opposition were incompetent and lazy. Who knows. We are where we are now.
---
Or, just maybe, there are still people in EVE who value content over power?
---
Awww poor baby.. 😪
---
I would like to set an appointment with this guy. He seems to be quite knowledgeable. 
---
I would be very interested in all those MLG protips how to find a hidden cloaky camper in his safe. Too bad i am not on FB to ask directly. :(
---
I am a goon
---
Kikis are great for small gang or goku fleets. If you want that then go for it. Other wise me personally skilling in to logi cruiser, getting a thanitos and almost at a rorqul.
---
Probably. Not sure the game would be though. 
---
I still think hoping for WWB to make null-sec more volatile and fractured was a good goal, even if it didn't come to fruition in the end.
---
More honestly, do you really thing Goons would let them try to rebuild somewhere? Whether Delve was a case of "enlightened gamekeeping for the good of the game" or "meh, lets relax and have some fun for a bit, we can always burn them down later" doesn't matter at this point. The lesson from that aspect is learned.
---
Also even if The Imperium did leave PanFam to rebuild somewhere they'd still need manpower. There isn't much of that left in Eve.
---
the wormhole tracker is not really up to date with newer corp unfortunately :(
---
It automatically pull data form a predefined set of wh corps :(
---
last time I checked it was concord capital lasers that were good. for 2M LP though.
---
Join them or test, if you wanna have the whole of Eve blue/frienemies, with no meaningful pvp.. This is why I’ve been considering on joining a WH Corp or the one that recently departed from legacy. 
---
Everyone in this game is so used to being under a super umbrella and being safe that it seems people have forgotten how fun it is to be in danger and what this game is all about.
---
Because your opinions are of course directly tied to the long term health of Eve
---
medium rails OP   
---
MAKE ZEALOTS GREAT AGAIN
---
People who get invited to things
---
Imagine printing and shipping taking months in 2019
---
Why, what platform is trendy now a days apart from IG.. I might be a little behind.
---
The unfriendly person here is you, expecting us to skip others to get to you. Probably best for you to look elsewhere, impatient folks don't belong.
---
I am sorry, We were talking i believe about empire building and the whole large groups. In no way did interpret those as fleets. 
---
That being said, yes, capital fights are boring, but that is more due to us, the players, we always stress the servers to the limit and due to that only ''n+1'' brawl kinda thing happen. Its not that a side will agree to only bring 500 and the other the same... its a wierd situation .
---
Obviously you didn't. The wait is explained there.
---
Quick! There's an EpIc RaId forming right now! Lololol FoR Da HoRdE amirite
---
&gt; Villllllllllllll**l**y
---
Never said u should skip but nevermind
---
Getting ship BPC (not even mentioning the hulls) with LP is not profitable in Stain.
---
"what if i find an unpiloted JF and need to inject into it so i can steal it?"
---
Maybe now yea, but last days there wasn’t an explanation
---
Higher on the street, and I know it's my time to go...
---
&gt; Villllllllllllllll**l**y
---
I know what I am injecting for asap. I don't have any implants because I die often
---
I actually dont play wow dumbass
---
Hahaha, that's exactly the mindset we need.
---
The MOTD has not changed for quite some time in regards to the wait.
---
Ah... Where do they come from then ?
---
You guys are still playing?
---
Sounds more fun than the game.
---
You need so much more in order to be at least considered an opposition. :D
---
Part 2: Send an email to non-logged in players 'hi, I'm CCP Mega, You have some time to talk to me?' and then get them to show you why they should be logging but don't.
---
Than there is no explanation, just a sentence about wait time
---
Wow, the abyssal sites are popular, everyone must love them. 
---
No, shit stick, they’re popular since they aren’t min maxed yet, so people are able to make more Isk. I’d guess the vast majority of PVE done in Eve is considered “needed” by the person doing it, rather than enjoyed. 
---
I like your idea.
---
\&gt; **Why not  do it again and help Triglavian to take over a part of higsec! Why in a  game like EVE you want to be a sheep that blindly follows the CCP's  shepherd**
---
Really, Triglavians taking over FW space would solve the problem with FW space.
---
You are actually being very entitled, recruiters work very hard and you are not the only person in eve. Wait your turn in the Que. Good riddance.
---
Ok so I am really hoping you guys can help me with this.
---
For the login rewards I am ONE day behind the scheduled so i will just miss out on the 1,000,000 skill points, is there anyway that I can still get it, like a support ticket or email to CCP? Unfortunately when I logged in today I logged in later than usual and since I live in NZ it was already the next day so I missed one of the days (I had already missed a few).
---
Please help, it will be crushing if I miss the million skill points.
---
Thank you in advance.
---
LOGI V
---
That is the answer you seek. There is a wait.
---
Maybe they do maybe they don’t I can’t tell, still it’s a joke to wait around 4 weeks 😉
---
U don’t get it i guess, nevermind...
---
This really isn't a bad idea, I like it. Some more player interaction not through the CSM and what the yearly(?) surveys they do. We have the CSM to represent us but it just seems to end up with a massive circlejerk with ccp almost every time.
---
My grandmother, but she's 98.
---
&gt;The idea is that they ask xx random player 'hey, you want to stream to CCP?' when they login.
---
Haha, how hilarious would that be. 
---
"Yeah, sure. So, I'm logged in now. Here's my SB, gonna press cloak now. Alright, see you in a couple of hours, if I feel fancy I'm gonna drop a Carrier on a Venture or something."
---
Yeah, the abyssal sites make money. You can even do it as an alpha as my corpmate baltec demonstrated.  
---
But why do you need isk?  What do you need it for?  What are you going to spend it on?  
---
Making isk to make isk to make isk to ... do what?  What is the endgame of game play they want after all that.
---
If you are planning to play alone, then find a goal, act for or against others... or for youself... that's Eve: find the gameplay you want to play.
---
With one month playing Eve, it is impossible to reach all aspects of PVP solo, PVP in gang, PVE solo, PVE with large fleets, Mining, Market, exploration, Planetary, Industry etc.... Talking about PVP, its much more fun in gameplay with a small gang or in fleet than solo.
---
My recommandation : Join a corp. I learned and realized what Eve really is since i'm in a corp.
---
My answer to all 6 is no.
---
Thanks.  I think they need some more random player interactions, finding out why they're doing the things they're doing.  Find out why people are doing certain things. :)
---
Tbf i honestly enjoy Abyssal sites. 
---
Yeh they get a bit samey after a while but they are far more engaging than any other PvE.
---
Starts at 15% isk sink to the empires, reduced by 10% per level of customs code expertiese.  Then you pay the tax to the corp that owns the thing, and that has no reductions other than sucking up to the owner for standings or nuking the thing and putting up your own.
---
This would be a lovely experience for them. Since sadly it’s real.
---
Now playing 10 hours of unadulterated synchronized Rorqual mining on 12 accounts simultaneously. 
---
Stay tuned, every 2 hours or so we are going to change moons, so that would be pretty intense. 
---
And there is a high opportunity we get to see bunch of booshers at least once at some point of our operation, so have your eyes peeled for them.
---
Abyssal sites are interesting game play, till you kind of solve the problem.   And even then, it can still get spicy from time to time.  'whoops, sent my gila drones too close to that tower'
---
Yeah, I'm sure they'll run into a few of those, though I think that's more rare these days.  
---
I think you'll have far more complaints about cloaky campers from the ratters they'll observe, it obviously aggravates you.  But they're never going to fix that problem because they're easy to counter, just set traps for them.
---
can you write up all Q's and A's in a nice long blogpost for future reading (and maybe add some stories of your own that are not question related)?
---
Yes I too like to make vague claims without explaining.
---
Getting Interplanetary Consolidation to V. Instantly more ISK.
---
You have different monitors and I find this offensive!
---
Just went to the eve-uni page, they say 10% base with empire.
---
There's like 4000 people in KF, it's the biggest Corp in the biggest alliance. Sorry if they don't bend over backwards for you. People are accepted each day, you just gotta wait your turn mate.
---
&gt; they’re popular since they aren’t min maxed yet, so people are able to make more Isk
---
Abyssal sites have been figured out to a science.
---
Nothing personal, kid....
---
dis gun b gud.
---
Be me : Apply all the SP without looking what's in queue.
---
Is this that guy from REQ?
---
If it’s so big, maybe get more recruiter? 😉😅
---
Not really. The benefit over 4s is so small that it takes around a year of optimal training just to recoup the cybernetics V investment. The real reason to get cyb 5 are omegas, t2/faction mindlinks and 05/06 hardwiring implants.
---
And that will lead tranquility to the serenity state, seems far away from exciting but you are right it's what is most likely to happen.
---
Now there are just not enough players, will and cash or interest to go after goonies ^^
---
Because as long as they are united they will restard to krab as soon as possible and push the thing further, not a lot of people are ready to commit for the pve level of goonies and that what make them powerful.
---
If I stopped winning eve I will go in wh or small alliance to avoid the tidi fests and boring 4h fleets
---
Same. They felt unique for sure
---
You probably make more profit on fast moving items like ammo, or implants. Also you guys are adorable :)
---
this... this is truly magnificent \*\_\*
---
Yes, but only if they actively banned multi-accounting.
---
What is there to explain? Numerical advantage is negated with area of effect attacks.
---
I love the stupid mini game!
---
Remember when all the cans used to eject and you had to try and collect the good stuff before it disappeared?  Now that WAS frustrating.
---
For that it should be able to contain items though.
---
check out this career graph ;) https://www.alpha-orbital.com/assets/images/post_img/eve-career-chart.jpg
---
and just because I'm curious, you are only over a month old and mined to a billion? flying a venture?
---
Right click on bpo, show in industry, the industry window pops up, select the station tab, select the station/citadel you want to price the research cost in, then select material or time research and the number of levels like you really are going to reseach it.
---
The reseach cost for the bpo in the station selected for the amount and type of reseach selected will be shown next to the time it takes to do that research.
---
The system and station/citadel you select will greatly impact the time and cost.
---
If goons did not think we will fight they would not be coming. If they just wanted to burn sov they would be hitting renting space not PH and NC sov.
---
lol I'm not gonna sit 10+ hours in a cyno fleet or in a belt just to wait for the afk-cloaker to come back and decide to make a move. 
---
If shit gets too annoying I'm just gonna unsub until things blow over.
---
Ah thats a problem with the Gila more than anything. 
---
Flying anything else and it requires a bit more effort.
---
But still, it keeps you on your toes, fuck even with a 3 bill fit my corpmate lost a sac cause he wasnt paying enough attention.
---
They become easy but one fuck up and you are dead.
---

---
What're the conditions to destroy a clone when clone jumping?
---
I feel ya. I was on holiday at the beginning of the event and will miss it by 3 days. I’m just gonna try not to worry about it.
---
cough Voltron cough
---
grandma
---
Whatever is useful but is off-remap and doesn't make your heart throb at the sound of it. 
---
Propulsion skills, capacitor skills, targeting, ewar and so on. 
---
In my experience, skills that get me into ships are easy to wait for, because there's a reward at the end of it. It's the workhorse skills that are tough on my patience. So for me it will be Repair Drone Operation V, and a small boost to Capacitor Emission Systems V. Because someone's got to keep shit alive.
---
&gt;  Numerical advantage is negated with area of effect attacks which damage multiple enemies simultaneously.
---
So is the AOE only applied to one side of the fight?  Otherwise I'd think if the attackers had AOE and a larger force, AOE would act as a force multiplier instead of an equalizer.
---
So, yeah, there's some explaining to do.  You can't just say "AoE.  Done, I fixed EVE."
---
You have a talent to write you should write a book or maybe just krab and never post again
---
More than someones opinion that needs his 40k lemmings to make his living of them, his opinions are tied to the well-being of his enterprise not to a game ...
---
Kid? Lmao
---
theres literally no point in waiting to use it, i just put it into minmatar cruiser 5 getting into them t3c's
---
ofc you just extract it and put it to ur new rorq alt
---
The fact that you even deploy proves you wrong...
---
So you took "Industrial Reconfiguration" to V
---
The most powerfull skil of all in todays EVE.
---
well, that's almost all LP market for you. You won't ever get fast and effective conversion with huge amounts
---
```Wormholes were ultimately dominated by the Imperium (Init)``` 
---
literally the funniest thing ive read today, imagine being this high on Spod
---
generally in an arms race you try something a little more effective than "look i made ANOTHER sharpened stick!"
---
The reality is when I was in a big bloc and this goes for the majority of members I could die the next day and nobody would care, first of all, because well the information likely never would have gotten out and because you get lost in the crowd quickly. 
---
Sure you might get your circle of friends but realistically most of the day's coms are so busy you really don't talk to people.
---
Well you don't seem to know about Stainguy, but he has this really cool idea about how it would be easier to move stuff to Stain
---
Ehhh, your idea 2 completely misses any mark to hurt bots.  If anything, it hurts actual players more than bots.  Players get every disadvantage from the change that bots do, but bots don't give a shit if they lose isk here or there, because they're not putting any effort in anyway.  It would, however, be frustrating as hell for a real player to run a full site for no payout, since as you yourself said, they can't fight a PVP ship, so they're forced to just leave it.  All this does is help ANY kind of hunter, it doesn't hurt bots in any way.
---
&gt; Hard to find some if u have to wait ages ...  
---
&gt; Heard of it alot but the time waiting is annoying   
---
&gt; Talked in their channel and was told to apply on their site stfu and wait until they decided   
---
&gt; True but around 4 weeks waiting time is way to high... 
---
So, you applied, joined the public channel, eventually read the MOTD of that channel that states there is a wait time, and not to complain about the wait time...
---
Your response to this was to come to reddit and complain about the wait time.
---
KF gets a lot of applicants. There were a lot of applicants in the queue before you applied. Your app will be reviewed when a recruiter gets to it. 
---
&gt; But still I can’t understand why it takes so long to accept my app, it’s  just a newbie account with many skill injections to start off well 
---
It takes so long because there are probably well over a hundred of apps in the queue at any given time (not a recruiter btw). The recruiters process them as fast as they can, but they also actually play the game, so it can take time for an app to eventually get through the process. Our recruiters are volunteers, and we thank them for thier efforts. 
---
In the time I took to type this, i could have made it halfway through a normal newbie app were I still in recruitment. It is a monumental waste of everyone's time to explain this to every new applicant, especially when it is literally spelled out in the public channel MOTD.
---
The short version then becomes "There is no estimated wait time, it will get processed when we get to it"
---
If this is unacceptable to you, then perhaps this corp might not be the best fit for you. 
---
If you can handle not being a special snowflake (for possibly the first time in your life), and manage to wait with maturity just like everyone else does, then perhaps there is a place for you with us.
---
TLDR: STFU and wait./s
---
abyssals are definitely min maxed already.
---
I saw the same question in last week's post and the answer was that there's 20 days to collect the 15 day rewards. If that's not true then a support ticket should do the trick
---
People with years on their main rs account did and now osrs is bigger than rs3. Eve could have a new engine and new players and itd likely be fun again
---
Yes, but those buyouts aren't going to be in the null system of choice.  Newer players would still have to pay someone else to haul them for them, while a botter would just collect an assload of them and bring them to market.  This literally hurts actual players just as much (if not more) than bots.  The change itself may have merits, depending on your views, but it has nothing to do with hurting bots.
---
Ok thanks for that update Captain Obvious
---
It's big enough, for anything else you want people who are able to broadcast anyway
---
You find the Pirate ship BPC as loot drop in DED Plexes (scanned down signature or escalation from anomaly). As they spawn from the most farmed anomalies most pirate ship bpc are farmed in these escalation plexes in Sov-Null
---
ok so we've moved from "one weird trick to killing botters" to weekly random updates which, don't get me wrong, sounds great but also sounds like approximately 500x the amount of coding ccp is willing to devote to this, or anything, in eve these days
---
I just fucking used them and regret it already. Always something better around the corner
---
Nah, boredom is a bitch.
---
Nope, your passive regen tank requires shield extenders, i am sure you have 2 at least. They will bloat your signature a lot, shield boosters do not alter signature, so an active shield tank per definition has a lower signature on the same ship.
---
a week of waiting to play when there are just as good options that will accept within a day lmao
---
Oh hell. I'd forgotten about those dark times.

SOURCE: Me
---
From my perspective I wouldn’t advise people to join any imperium alliance unless they specifically want to only rat. The PvP fleets are well letS just say ‘not good’, use the same 3  (boring) doctrines 90% of the time (jackdaws, caracals/ caracals and harpies), PvP is dis incentivised culturally so despite having ~ 1500 online nightly they struggle to get those people into fleet and you have FCs begging for logi or stand down.
---
you have api gated corps in horde though, there is no difference but the fact that getting in to horde is much faster
---
The frigate T5s are even easier to solve. You can multibox T5 darks with 3 good hawk pilots and ~200M in ships. Max dps max application no tank mwd lml hawks, all T2 fit are dirt fucking cheap, need no implants, can project out to 50-60km with guidances and kite out/slingshot out from webs and scrams. Literally the only things I’ve died to are bad piloting (boundary out too fast and the damage stacks quickly) and one really bad wave of small trig drones that I couldn’t kite.
---
You solve them by making them stupid cheap to lose ships in, you’ll always fuck up occasionally but if you’re pulling 180-200m out of a filament every 15 minutes you’ve literally broke even after 1, maybe 2 T5s on a bad roll of loot
---
One year of paying a wardec fee weekly, and one year of fueling a structure that can be shot. Unless you plan to get a few dozens of them and defend actively defend them often, likely not worth it.
---
But you could you know, talk to the owner. Back when I was in the HS POCO game, good customers had a rebate. Or you could even buy it.
---
Yes if you want to continue to play by yourself join some small shitbird operation.
---
We do reject spies, you're right.
---
Sounds great 😅
---
Gallente cruiser 5 here i come, now my VNI skills will finally be completed. :D
---
We're that girl that all the boys in school want to date, too many people calling at once so it's hard to hit them all back up. I'm sorry we so cute :(
---
API gated corps who get AWOX tackled by the non gated Corps. Great system.
---
I thought of it and ended up training it naturally as when I did as the newb that I am, there goes the free skill points wasted haha
---
There is tons of pvp in Delve, you just have to put down the spod rock and look. We get roamers daily.
---
Prob it’s for the most just cause of your region? I wanna join for pvp
---
That is the thing. The skillgain system is different. That is what you don't get. The idea is stupid.
---
Do you have drone interfacing 5? That shit takes 23 days..
---
Your advice is to burn out in 2-3 weeks because you have no social network?
---
I bet you're a blast at parties.
---
And the other half is useless
---
no. 
---
There are systems for only api gated corps, normal members can't enter. its no different from when a neutral enters system, or a renter for that matter
---
As long as you're not a retard you won't get awoxed, i can see that would be hard for you so i understand the confusion
---
Spend it all on Planetary skills and tell yourself you'll do PI every couple days and be rich.    
---
Then, never do PI again because it's fucking boring.
---
lol even better - thats camaraderie alright. Orrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr just unbelievably lazy.
---
Oh, I get it. You are a whiner that wants my team to burn themselves out even faster, or else you want more lax checks, which will never happen.
---
Bold claim to say you have been waiting 4 weeks. I have a feeling this is a case of someone waiting 3 days and is exaggerating right now. We do care about new players, but it sounds like you are an old bitter vet that is trying to sneak an alt in so you can just krab. Bye Felicia.
---
&gt; its no different from when a neutral enters system, or a renter for that matter
---
Keep in mind you are talking about PEOPLE FROM YOUR ALLIANCE.
---
I don’t PVE FYI. First time I went to delve I got blapped by a titan in a t1 destroyer. Last time I did something similar but I just got dropped on.
---
Lax checks? Burnout? Stop kidding 😂
---
&gt;Villllllllllllllllll**l**y
---
Maybe you should start
---
Krab? Felicia?
---
This is honestly far too complex of a question for reddit to answer. Both have distinctly different cultures. Really it depends on what you're looking for in the game, and if you're truly new any group is better than no group.
---
Anyone who gives you advice of being in a small group or doing some neutral group stuff is really doing you a disservice by  removing the best part of EVE from you, which is the community.
---
Obviously as a part of KarmaFleet's leadership I think we're the better choice, but I felt a non-biased answer would serve you better as a new player.
---
As far as I am concerned the event lasts until the 20.05.2019, therefore you should have a few days of buffer.
---
I'll give it to you for free: 
---
Just take 120 people in stabbers with oversized prop mods. Now you split up and everyone alings to a random direction until you have all directions covert and fly in a straight line with drones out. 
---
Only takes a couple months.
---
No i'm not, i'm not in Horde. 
---
There is nothing stopping people from taking the step up and getting api verified, its a good system
---
Yup, i have heavy drones 5 and drone interfacing to 5 already.
---
Only gall cruiser 5 missing from the important ones. I also only have faction drone specialisations on lvl3, but since dps gain is negligeable for the same train time (24d lvl4-5) i will probably not bother with those for now and instead be training for logi to be of at least some use in comming war. :)
---
Tomorrow I am going to undock over $1000 worth of ships to bring to war. We are pretty serious about protecting those kinds of assets. Stop thinking we don't work hard to keep the riffraff out.
---
That's slightly annoying
---
I can vouch that this source is creditable
---
Well, that could theoretically work. But for a system with 50AU diameter, i doubt 120 stabbers would be close to enough. 
---
Also, i think your time estimate is a bit off too. By a few years/decades. :D
---
Civilisations can go down and be rebuilt.  
---
There are a lot of ways CCP could "soft-wipe" (♢ invasions that destroy even highsec structures, BPO and skill point degradation, systems moving, gates being changed, destroyed and rebuild).  
---
We would need the ability to fight those changes ofc, so our decisions still matter (defending Jita 4-4 against the triglavians), but there needs to be some effort required.  
---
Just maintaining the current state doesn't make for exiting gameplay.
---
Lmao! I was thinking that... I’ve logged in, I’ve warped my orca to a perch over that guys Azbel.
---
I’ve cloaked. When that thing drops I’m going to steal it from under his nose!
---
Yeah, this to be specific:
---
https://www.amazon.com/Icelandic-Gammeldags-Old-fashioned-Licorice-12-3oz/dp/B07H75CHGL
---
Like I said, I swear this stuff is catnip to the Icelandic devs. They'd swarm the bowls.
---
I mean the structure thing is gonna hurt operations like this ( kinda why I never considered it a good idea in the first place as it fucks well the small harassment campaigns without really addressing the trade hub campers ). 
---
I mean a year of wardecs 52 weeks 5.2 billion give or take, like sure part of your motivation has to include fuck these guys as 5 bill really get's you almost any poco.
---
oh shit i forgot to log on
---
brb getting THAT SWEET SP
---
There are still wh/lowsec corps out there. Also, you can get your PvP fix without having to find "fair fights" - there aren't many gudfites left, but blops is still alive and well!
---
Goonswarm is by far the most trust worthy group in  the game. We always strive to be the best of friends and the worst possible enemy.
---
We dont break agreements and always stick to our word. Though this dosent mean some of our members wont scam you because it happens all the time, it is just our leadership wont scam you.
---
I appreciate where this question is coming from, but no. It'd be a huge document and I intend to spend this weekend having fun. ;-)
---
Spent it on Heavy Assault Cruiser V.
---
They have everything to do with each other. 
---
The 32bit client has a memory limitation so high resolution textures literally are not possible cause the 32 bit architecture cannot reliably support it. 
---
This is one of the reasons for client crashes during huge fights, people are reaching that memory limitation.
---
I can vouch the Toni's vouch is creditable.
---
man, almost like mine EVE shrine (mine with white interior)
---
Really looks like one is flipped upside down. Question is, which one is correct?
---
unplayable
---
I can vouch that NationalCelery's vouch of Toni's vouch is colossal
---
^^^^^^this ^^^^^^was ^^^^^^a ^^^^^^paid ^^^^^^review
---
Having been a member of KarmaFleet for 4 years now, I can tell you this isn't the case.  At least not in KarmaFleet.  You will only be a number if you do not mingle with the community.  Get on comms, say hello, type in corp chat, say hello.  Get to know your corpmates.  I can tell you for a fact this is how it works in KarmaFleet.  I'm willing to bet this is how it is in any other corp as well.
---
You can do other things while you wait...
---
I didn't realise people actually enjoyed the current state of the game
---
I can vouch that I am proud that Merk took the initiative to make this post.
---
As others have said, I have different clones for different purposes. The training clone rarely leaves the citadel, then I have an empty clone for hauling/ratting/scanning/etc., then for fleets I have an armor clone and a shield clone.
---
Not sure if you have seen the chinese server lately id say pibc should be your main worry.  They effectively destroyed the other server not only because of bots but also pibc from what it looks like forced everyone blue or death.
---
All the focus on the Agency seems to be an effort to chase the needle of the expectations that other MMOs put on their devs. EVE has always been built on players generally finding their own fun. And if these Invasion sites (to use an example) are similar to the previous Incursion sites, that's well and good. Boring and repetitive, but well and good for allowing players to find their own fun.
---
But if the Invasion sites are dozens of "go here, shoot things" and "more floating fucking rocks" that Yahtzee complained about in his review of EVE a decade ago, and if the Agency is just CCP devs trying to fill the player hopper with this kind of content... well, not only is that not what EVE is about, I don't believe that CCP has sufficient devs to keep that kind of thing going very long.
---
'cause after all, we already have this sort of thing, they're called null-sec anoms, and they do absolutely nothing to make EVE more fun.
---
It's the sort of thing I'd watch play out when I was a blogger. But I won't be around to watch it this time...
---
Well if CCP had listed to the last 2 CSMs, attributes would be gone and all skills would train at the same speed...better be the fastest speed too, lord knows they would fuck it up.
---
not in that alliance, if null sov is your game you have no options
---
Bet this is fixed before shield slaves are added
---
Well, you dont have to stay in Karmafleet (for example) forever. Just get used to everything, make some ISK and SP and look out for another corp. Maybe you already have made some friends
---
The crybabies such as yourself are the vast minority.
---
Just join ascee
---
Can’t unsee this now...
---
&gt; So is the AOE only applied to one side of the fight?
---
No, but if two fleets of 50 and 200 meet, and both apply AoE, then one fleet loses 50 ships and the other 200.
---
&gt; but the upside is that we live in the most active nullsec region for pvp.
---
Mainly because Goons are running fleets up there on the daily.  So, if you want to be hunted, join Horde.  If you want to do the hunting, join KarmaFleet.
---
You mean healed.
---
Riffraff? I don’t understand, maybe iam to new for it, best luck in the war anyway ☺️
---
Hope there will be videos to watch, want to see it if I can’t participate
---
Took me a moment, that's gonna drive me mad, even if I don't fly a sabre.
---
*swiggety swooty, that Azbel is now my booty!*
---
Depends on how much sp you have. At 150+ you start running out of things to train. Better to just hold on to it for a new skill at that point.
---
I love that! I may use that instead of “The Thieves Guild thanks you for your donation”
---
I can vouch for all above.
---
Wasn't the huge advantage on the archon blob whoever deployed the wrecking ball first, If i remember right (i played but was not a capital pilot.) 
---
Alot of times if your enemy had the wrecking ball formed jumping into them was basically suicide because of extensive grid load, and your enemy could make it worse simply by recalling and replacing drones.
---
As someone who processes SRP for the alliance, and KarmaFleet - KarmaFleet members can get both alliance and corporate level SRP.  Not every corp in Goonswarm has that.
---
The FB group is very toxic at times to everyone that isn’t in CODE. It’s fucking annoying explaining to them that hIgH SeC gANkINg iS nOt pVP!!!
---
Technically, it would be worth waiting for the few players that are on the threshold of crossing the skill injector sp ranges so they can get more bang for their buck.
---
I certainly hope the art team isn't responsible for things like programming or game balance.
---
Well what do you gain by waiting? They dont earn interest
---
Also im under 5m sp lol
---
I like pvp people, have you applied to this Kramalfret?
---
For the few time spend there:
---
Bounty on rats
---
Far from megacoalitions conflicts.
---
Small gang PvP
---
But, NCPL is making some cleaning there now. Independent small alliances are being be bashed and forced to choose sides tothe big Coalitions of the game. So...
---
Small gang will be gone
---
Population is gonna be higher
---
The last free lands are gone
---
I like Dronelands. Lore and stuff.
---
The certainty of punishment it's in itself protection
---
Unlucky lad.

Bots already run Abyssmals.  They just aren't that popular because Abyssmals are shit compared to pretty much anything else;  you have to sell the loot, and the loot itself is RNG (often averaging to shit isk/h once you factor in filament costs).  Mechanics wise, they're no harder than just running anoms.  
---
People act like they're something special, but they're really not.  They're effectively anoms with slight spawn differences, but basic Gila fits can just be scripted to loot the cache, orbit the gate, and drones kill everything in T3s for cheap. Can even do the same in T4s if you want to bling a bit.  There are like 5 different spawns total with different EWAR combinations that really don't matter to a proper fit.   After getting to know the possible spawns, these damn things are as boring as anom running.
---
Empires tend to stagnate and decay from within. The Romans where practically invincible for generations, even more so Egypt. They all thought it was going to last forever. History repeats itself (looking at you U.S.A.). Same will happen here, given time.
---
You are asking too much for a minmatar ship.
---
given the amount of people i talk to that also feel the same way, i dont believe you
---
If you want to awox other pilots, join Horde.  Otherwise join Karmafleet.
---
&gt; My subscription was supposed to timeout until later tonight
---
So you were wrong, fucked op, and now you're crying about it ?
---
You can all go vouch yourselfes
---
That most definitely was
---
You know, I'm kind of sad that the Imperium Eve book never got off the ground. Even if it was bullshit propoganda it still would have been an interesting read and would get people to join the game.
---
I've recently fancied the idea of ships jumping to a cyno landing in the abyss instead of a warp tunnel.
---
There they have to traverse a distance in the abyss before coming out at the other side, while meeting token resistance that might web/scram them.
---
Prop mods on caps would even start making sense.
---
Just swipe it
---
So, for the people that had stuff saved, when the new Trig ships came in they could instantly train into them and have T2 weapons weeks before anyone else.
---
CCP add new skills fairly often.
---
I can vouch for all of the above, but fsync may not have JDC5.  The rest I vouch for.
---
OMG A WHOLE WEEK.
---
u need horde cos we all no how to take care of ppl and we dont go crying to our mommies wen we get beaten in pvp and resort to capitals like karma do lol
---
Cheap and cheerful. Can kill frigates, can run from cruisers. What's not to like?
---
Its minmatar ductape is not an exact science
---
"and if u ask again u have to wait Even longer"
---
That is categorically untrue. That may have been said in joke but it is NEVER the actual case. I'm all for people being unhappy about the wait but telling outright lies is silly.
---
Have fun in horde then!
---
Thats not the point. If you were a bit less retarded you might understand why waiting a week for something you can have now is something people don't want to do.
---
Thrre is no difference for a linemember between horde, test and goons, so why wait when horde accepts faster.
---
Mouse click masterrace reporting in
---
Transformers Head... \^\^
---
I'm crying.. Boo hoo hoo. The subscription clearly give a date and time when it was supposed to time out. Which was 9:30 PM EST tonight. So I was operating on that time until I logged in after reset this morning to see it wasn't so.
---
As a 3mil sp omega my choice is easy - fitting skills+getting into stiletto
---
Yea, CCP told him to keep his hands off Eve.
---
I'M NOT RETARDED.
---
My mother had me tested.
---
If you do join one of the newbro-friendly large bloc corps, the trick is that you don't stay with them forever. They're great for figuring out what your personal niche in Eve is, but once you've got some stuff going for you it's best to start looking for another corp, particularly in a smaller alliance, that really lets you take that drive and do something good and meaningful with it.
---
In a smaller group your contributions matter much more and you can be proud of what you do rather than feel like just another drop in the blob. Eve is about your identity and your story, so things like mining are usually a means to an end for those sort of things. If you like mining and/or exploring as a pastime (which is totally okay) then there are ways to symbiotically translate that into something that benefits your corporation too.
---
Whatever you do, have fun doing it! :)
---
Reeeeee CCPlease
---
That makes less sense than Pineapple on Pizza.
---
horde? the good guys? bahahahaahaha thats the funniest shit ive heard its as bad as elo saying he doesnt have bots
---
That much sense? Muat be the most sense making fact of all time then
---
JDC5
---
Ill add them to the 1,5M u used SP I have lying around 'for when I need a skill fast', which never happens. 😬😅
---
Dont you try to reason with me you know better - THIS MACHINE IS FUELED BY EMOTION
---
...About 4 years too late.
---
Anyone with half a brain noticed that PL essentially quit Eve on the heels of WWB, and the rest of you have been beating (and gloating about) a corpse ever since.
---
And I say this as someone who endured the Brave/PL GE-Lychton-COUPBOIS gong show...err I mean evac. But sure, you folks sure showed them. I'm sure they are unconsolable as they queue up for another game of Overwatch or whatever the fuck they play nowadays...
---
this is probably the single worst piece of advise on this whole post. you are bad, and should feel bad
---
You want ISK because ISK is the only real indicator of your "level" or "power" or whatever. The biggest, toughest ships can be bought with ISK. Skillpoints can be bought with ISK. Omega clones can be bought with ISK. So of course you want a lot of it.
---
The problem is, this makes most people extremely risk-averse, meaning no PvP where you can lose the expensive toys. Those same people don't stop and wonder why they even bother playing. I sure hope they don't play for the absolute dogshit missions and mining and other PvE nonsense, because why play this game solo when there are much, *much* better single-player games out there?
---
OMFG, this so much.
---
I have 6 toons with maxed PI skills, don't even have a planet up.
---
Yep, very much this.
---
Hey you should stop eating paint and learn the definition of 'not just a'
---
yeah this.
---
From what I hear PH tend to like living in that moment where they have to run from the steamroller. KF have of late tended to be the ones doing the steamrollering.
---
Yeah I'm out of a lot of skills to train. I'm saving it for the Trig cruiser. I already have HAC 5, Recon 5, Logistics 5 and stuff. Still taking a wait and see once they are released how they do and how much they are brand new.
---
You can still get it if you go Omega again.
---
No dude, it's totally doable in a few months. Maybe even 2 days.
---
Slower than a frigate with a larger sig but comparable tank. Very limited engagement profile because of that. Not really useful for anything solo except for a straight DPS brawl kind of fight. Most fits either get kited by frigates or can't keep them tackled because most of them lack range control.
---
Notable exception is the Algos which is pretty good across the board. And Talwar/Corms for fleet fights of course. I've seen some pretty good Thrasher kills, but Thrashers do have the weaknesses described above. 
---
Corax is just a worse Talwar, no reason to ever use one.
---
Catalyst is literally just for ganking. The range on blasters is too low to really do anything else.
---
I thought about it. Finally extracted my proteus skills after years of just sitting there.
---
Calling you, and the search is a mystery
---
Sure, but they are still relatively new and intimidating to those that haven't been playing this game for years. Visit the various rookie and helpchannels sometime - the amount of questions and fear of abyssal sites is huge.
---
first, be sure your skill queue matches your attributes. if not,make a new skill queue, possibly remap to have a whole 1year SQ up.
---
Then, when you know your remap wont, change, put those SP in some skills that are in a group you that does not have enough SP to require a remap.
---
The last free SP they gave us I kept for the eventual lose of a T3C and put the skill back in quickly.
---
Not an option until I get enough isk ingame.
---
I can’t see it.
---
/never fly these anyway.
---
the spod must flow
---
My bait Abby has a decloaker
---
Unspent skillpoints are counted on your total SP count
---
I'm too much of a hoarder really, I think I still have like 7 allowed remaps I can use as well 🤔
---
I don't think you get the point, the reason you are waiting so long is because there are hundreds of newbies who applied before you whom recruitment is tending to.
---
It's not like we see an application and we accept them right away, we investigate the characters so we don't get shitlords/spies/awoxers among our ranks.
---
Either be patient of spread your wings to another party, it is as simple as that.
---
Or pay $15
---
Rorqs have been a positive addition to eve content.  They've been a huge negative on the economy, but an ISK maker that sieges is great design.  The problem is the scalability and safety under umbrellas.  The siege concept is worth emulating, though.
---
Join a lowsec group with lots of moons . Then do hauling for them because they are criminals
---
I support this product and or service.
---
Around Sept last year a NC bloc FC commented on a talk show that we (Karmafleet are in Imperium) were the only ones making major new plays in the nullsec war meta that year.
---
We just happen to do a lot of very different things very well all around.
---
If you paint yourself into corners that tends to make the game boring after a bit, and you're ignoring the other parts of the sandbox.
---
Join Brave Newbies,I kinda find them best for the beginners.
---
Given the quality of a typical themepark today, "Space EverQuest" is almost a compliment.
---
It was proof that you were toasting in vale prior to the fall of m-o.  You were committing 15 bil in assets to start attacking ihubs in vale.  You had also toasted the pocket on the other side of 2cg-sv. 
---
You had been cloaky camping and hotdropping anything that moved for over a month prior to our evac.  
---
You are disingenuous to claim that you were not in the first steps of an invasion prior to our evac.  Your plan was to farm us, harvest our super pilots, and 'worthy people' and then kick the corpse out to die in lowsec.  Your pilots are on record here, although I dont immediately have the cite, as saying that our evac fucked up your planned winters content.
---
And in the end you cant argue that our move was the incorrect one or the smart one.

hi i got an evemail too, this is what it said: https://pastebin.com/4niS5XvZ
---
Thats just because its a relatively large investment
---
:D
---
Even better:
---
Hell yeah here's my new Astero. Watch me spend 2 hours optimizing my elaborate no-tank gtfo explo fit, scooting around gathering mods, then dying due to drunkenly attempting a LS combat anom with a fit totally unsuited for the occasion. 
---
Nothing to learn here.
---
JDC V btw
---
That mail was sent yesterday. 
---
It is more cookie cutter system observations. See the arc  semiosis thread on the forums. Nothing new or special. 
---
Side note: just because one clade sends an email, it does not mean that all clades will send an email. There has been several occasions where only one or two sent an email.
---
Now that I have more information, I think 3 days of waiting isn't outside of the realm of normal.. a lot of unfair posts below considering your short wait time. Will still review your application though, because contrary to what you've said below, we are new player friendly.
---
There's channel "Concord lp" which specializes in these deals. They also have a mailing list you can join. The typical price is 1300, but I've also seen 1500 (I don't recall if that was a buyer or a seller though). That's the easiest way to convert LP to isk. You can also sort by buy order and do immediate sales. Sometimes it's worth it, but if you sort by ISK/LP, it is rare that you'll see something higher than 1300 in the buy orders. LP buyers are there for the long game and usually go by sell prices.
---
You can make more money by doing what the buyers are doing. If you're trying to convert the Concord LP to something useful (like converting it to Caldary Navy and transforming t1 ammunition into faction), you really have to do a little market analysis beforehand. Depending on what you choose, it might take days to weeks to even months to sell what you can acquire with LP. If you have patience and a dedicated market alt and you are willing to play the 1 ISK game (changing your price by 1 ISK at a time to be the first in the list). If you don't like market stuff and have no patience, just sell the LP to someone. Otherwise, here are a few tips to look out for:
---
* Look up the daily movement of the item. If the item only sells 1 unit a day and you buy hundreds of them, it will take you a very long time. Be wary of ammo. They might have thousands of sales a day, but if you're selling hundreds of thousands, it will still take you a long time to sell them all (been there, done that). Then again, you might have the patience to wait this long.
---
* Watch out for price manipulation. Look at the price history over the past few months and see if you can spot any unusual increase in prices. A high LP/ISK ratio might simply have been manipulated to be that high, and your actual return will be lower than expected, or take much, much longer than expected.
---
* Be ready to have to manufacture some items to get a better ISK/LP ratio. If you can source your own minerals, even better. Some items have small mineral requirements for the selling price, so often the cost can be ignored, but sometimes that isn't the case.
---
* Just in case you didn't know about it, you have a few tools available to sort ISK/LP:  
---
[https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/lpstore](https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/lpstore/)  
---
[/](https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/lpstore/)[http://www.ellatha.com/eve/LP-Stores-Isk](http://www.ellatha.com/eve/LP-Stores-Isk)  
---
Since you're likely going to be converting Concord LP to other LP, don't forget to multiply the actual ISK/LP ratio by 0.8 (for Empire factions) or 0.6 (Non-Empire, Non-Pirate factions). You can't convert it to pirate lp.
---
* You can use this website:  
---
 [https://nearest.ouroborus.org/](https://nearest.ouroborus.org/)   
---
To figure out the closest route from any system (Jita or Amarr typically) to the NPC faction you want to trade LP to. Helps with route planning if you have to exchange items, or when bringing a lot of valuable cargo back.
---
* After you've done all this research, you'll see that 1300 ISK per LP is actually a very reasonable price for all the work that's needed to make a profit by trading concord LP. Most items are way below that price, even for sell orders. If you're not a trader yourself, it's often much better to just sell to LP to a trader.
---
&gt; What's not to like?
---
Fitting. Imagine Destroyers that are like Battlecruisers - with a ~50% damage bonus on six weapon slots rather than 7-8 weapon slots eating up most of the CPU, PG and slot count.
---
Oh boo. That would be a darn shame if it were the case!
---
How do you get good pvp though? Sulk around something and hope another solo guy in a similar ship shows up?
---
The vast majority of pvp in eve is some dude or a handful of dudes getting gangbanged by a lot of gentlemen. How is that going to be lessened?
---
The very few solo pvps I've had were awesome. It's just ultra rare.
---
incursions still a thing?
---
XL Torpedoes V
---
130m SP now. Training Caldari Dreadnought V after XL Torpedo Specialization IV.
---
Absolutely astounding. I better update my buy orders!
---
Ah, new skills, i see i was kind of assuming skills dont change much
---
aw shame, it would make for a killer article for eve nerds
---
As someone who has spent time in both plus numerous other new player corporations i can unbiasly say that KarmaFleet is the only choice.  99% of the people who talk down Goonswarm hold on to a ten year plus old political agenda of grr goons.  Everyone in eve is allowed to go through cultural changes except GSF apparently.
---
Besides the plethora of financial and fun activities that KarmaFleet has one of the most under mentioned programs we have as an alliance is Gooniversity.  Not only do we have years and years of information to provide but we constantly provide classes to teach players along with giving them access to free materials to get them started.  Yes we are an enormous corporation, but that just means you're more likely to find people you get along with.  This place is ran like no other other organization in eve and you will not regret your choice joining KarmaFleet.  
---
Even if you join us and move on, you'll see that the amount of knowledge you'll gain about the game while with us is second to none.
---
Is it possible to do in game loans? I don't want it to be mistaken for real money trading. $15 in real money is not an option.
---
I never said that I wait for 4 weeks, just that some wait for that long and if it is worth to wait that time. Because I don’t wanna join and leave Corps daily. I wanna join a Corp and wanna be home if it fits. Wanna help that Corp in many ways as good as I can. I don’t wanted to be mean or anything. Just tried to argue a bit and see what happens 😉
---
As I said pm me ingame we can talk about everything u wanna know and I don’t expect instant invite, but I ask for some input. How are the chances to get in, etc
---
WH exploration is great.
---
Wish my alpha state allowed me to keep using my Astero :&lt;
---
Damn you CCP
---
Maybe make a ticket, for any issues they usually give out a day or two of omega time.
---
So if you say the time changed then they might throw you some.
---
Find a goal and chase it. For most, the goal is tribalism and killmails or ISK -- which is why most corp recruitment is about PVE opportunity and Killboard flexing. Some corps will have a more specific goal. Hauling frieght, exploration, role play, industry. 
---
Without a good aim, you will become lost in EvE.
---
They dont really. BNut you really do run out of things to train after a certain point.So its worth holding onto to them
---
Not if you leave them in the redemption queue.
---
Well, as Director of Recruitment I can tell you that everyone gets a fair shot. 
---
If it works out, hopefully you see the light. But I make no promises, naturally.
---
Why a toilet?
---
Maxed PI?  Like 6 planets and level 5 upgrades?  Christ.
---
I have 12 chars that do PI but most are at level 4's because the 5's are insane.
---
The LEDs are only a slightly blue off-white.  And, while they do bathe the room when it's dark, it's a soft light and not at particularly distracting
---
As for the noise, because the fans are only running at 600-800 RPM, occasionally 900 RPM after a long period of sustained load, they're actually quite quiet.  While the relationship between RPM and airflow (i.e. cooling) is linear, the relationship between RPM and noise is logarithmic.
---
I used to have only six fans inside an enclosed case, rather than eight on an open case.  They'd run at around 1200-1400 RPM to attain a similar or slightly lower level of cooling than I get now.  But, even though that's 25% fewer fans running at less than double the speed, it would result in about 2.5-4 times the noise.
---
It's all what you make of it? If you don't interact with the people, of course most people won't know if you are gone. So at least in a large group, chances are higher to make connections. Small groups tend to fall apart and go afk or separate ways, which brings you back to square one.
---
Get the stuff out of the redeeming queue - it has expiration dates. If you leave it in the queue, you will lose it.
---
Sounds like a reasonable thing to try. The issue is that if Omega time ends at restart on the day it is due to time out it shouldn't specify a time later that day when it's due to time out in the Pilot Services tab.
---
Not really practical but I'd really love for a ccp dev to see what a huge faff it is to try to find and kill a mining ship in a system with an athanor on each moon. There are so many problems with that interaction from the hunter pov that i'm 100% sure that no person from ccp has ever played it from that side.
---
actually the 5s make the most benefit. You see the resource much better so you have actually a net gain in raw resource extraction, you have the tiny more CPU to install more heads, and of course one planet more is just +20% raw income.
---
I had toons with different levels on the same planet and it was not even worth it looking at the planets of the toons in training.
---
We have an intel map fyi, it's called TACO.
---
First of all, EVE is not a themepark mmo like world of warcraft. The game isnt here to throw you attractions in the face. So now.. what has the game to offer? Discovering your very own personality, your idea richness and  adventurousness. EVE gives you the tools to create your own legacy. Invest in the game and you might become known across all of new eden. EVE's lifeblood are the people playing it, creating contend and drama like a theater with you as an actor.
---
And you can see how salty people are about afk cloakies as well in here too.
---
Holy shit that’s a wall of words, thank you 3000 my man, some of these I already know but still very useful!
---
Somebody might be willing to loan you the money for the PLEX, assuming you have collateral to cover it. Or maybe they're just generous and give you the money. Beggars in the hubs sometimes get money for nothing.
---
Oh no what have you done? I will never unsee this now.
---
It's maybe a skill issue. Back when I started my experience was that the Stabber was a disappointment compared to the Thrasher. The survivability seemed better but overall performance was meh. 
---
I don't remember the details. I used borrowed fits from local at the time. Looking back I think I had better skills for small guns than medium and that might make a significant difference.
---
I think I did L3 security missions in that half skilled Thrasher 3 years ago.
---
just finish your link alt, you surely have one right?
---
This is why I love war. New songs, new propaganda and new shit posts...and then teh REAL shit posts start from Naz.
---
   
---
    
---
Oh what a lovely day for a spot of war...
---
That's where I'm at.
---
Everyone told me to get PI alts because they're free money.
---
As it turns out, I don't give a shit about free money if it's that goddamn tedious.
---
I can remap come September lol. All out. 120m+ SP tho.
---
sound needs some work, otherwise its great
---
So this is what all the cowards do while they stay docked.
---
It sounds like player corps are just more of the same, but... they're not.  It's a whole new ballgame with only some of the same pieces.  EWar and logi, for example, are almost meaningless without corpmates or against other players.  The whole experience changes with other human players working for and against you.
---
Had a fender bender after a night of playing.
---
I'm 5 days out from t2 large Trig weps then working into some intensive level 5s.  Cov ops, HACs, marauders, tac logi for t2 triage, racial dreads, or racial carrier, etc etc.. How the heck am I supposed to decide?
---
The ?G? is due to using a slightly incorrect Trig alphabet which had a slightly different "Y" and duplicated "G" character.  
---
I inferred the extra punctuation characters seen here and not found in that file, I'm pretty confident they're correct and represent the period, comma and tac symbols.  
---
Well, that's 45 mins of my life I won't get back, thanks CCP.
---
Thrashers are good for running around, getting a couple of kills, losing the fleet and still being isk positive
---
I can tell you how it was before umbrellas and Intel-Bots covered 50% of Sov-Nullsec. You logged, joined Corp-TS, and did some daily chatter, meanwhile scanning the constellation for good Wormholes. If you found a nice Nullsec-Hole you jumped into some ships and went in. If you tackled something you often let it live as long as possible to trigger response fleets and fights. Or you took a quite cheap comp like some 20 Arti-Ruptures with 2-3 Scythes max. (look killable), went to a populated nullsec system (Stager/PvE-Central etc.) and bubbled the undock. Wait som 10 -20 minutes to give them time for formup and then fight the much bigger fleet ... fun times. 
---
Today this playstyle is 100% negated by a combination of Intel-Bots, region-wide Capital-/Supercapital-Umbrellas, or the PvE population being widely afk or even automatted.
---
Visit https://khon.space/blueprint/
---
haha you're on your own mate. Suppose the best way to decide is, what skills do you/your group need yesterday?
---
How the fuck are those things related
---
This is similar to where I am.  I have all racial dreads lvl 4 and all cap weps specialization lvl 4.  Same w/ racial carriers.  I could get a quick level 5 racial cap skills or use the SP on level 5 HACs, t2 triage, cov ops, recons, etc etc that bonuses all the races.  Hard to decide!
---
Feels like Razor in dronespace
---
so it completely eliminates any numerical advantage in fleet comps? Yeah, that's a terrible idea.
---
Find the interview with DJ for the real story, not from some lurker in the corner of the room watching everyone do the work.
---
Do you know how long is AU in kilometers? 
---
And do not forget, that ship speed is counted in m/s, not km/s . :)
---
It's a fair argument, a week is a long time for some people. But I'm not sure how to make it faster while keeping it secure, we get 30 or so applications a day.
---
Well europeans do
---
Yeh thats a fair complaint.
---
Racial cap skills V wouldn't get you halfway through the skill. They are all 3m sp skills.
---
But if he is red with horde he gets to go hunt horde, your space is perfectly populated to solo hunt in, you are not so densely populated that you are 100% guaranteed to get 10 titans dropped on your stabber like in Delve.. yet there are enough of you that you can find some targets. 
---
That said, gf and good welps horde.. its been fun going to your home region the last few weeks.
---
it's okay
---
Goons have really stepped up their propaganda recently... I really hope we see more of this!
---
Careful about the redeeming queue, they do eventually expire if not claimed
---
You get me.
---
Its not your fault its just how it is, horde is fast because they accept everyone clicking apply
---
If you want to go into a gated horde corp you need to have been a member of horde for a while iirc
---
If you were in a big bloc and did not join smaller subgroups that shared your interests, you were doing it wrong. Or your big bloc was shit.
---
It's a Minmatar ship what exactly are you expecting from something that has been build from scraps of rusted metal and a few blinking LEDs. Get real man lol
---
So, are you banned from the game?
---
These are great days we're living Bro's. we are big Jolly bumble bees, stalking New Eden with guns..
---
In my experience small groups are also full of people who don't think for themselves (not in any useful way anyway). 
---
Let say we have a group of 100 people in a corp, among an imagined 100 000 players total. Statistically speaking its very likely none of the 100 are among the top 1% in skill among the total population. If a corp is lucky they have more than 1 such person. But because of the Dunning-Kruger effect the less skilled can not identify the more skilled, because the less skilled lack the expertise to even recognize that they lack skill and expertise. 
---
People like to imagine that they can just make a group of only the skilled, by being skilled themselves (foregoing the idea that they might have Dunning-Kruger effect going on) they think they can recognize other  skilled people, but that is based on the wrong assumption that data is perfect in representing actual skill. Which it isn't. So for example people might look at the killboard of potential recruits, not recognizing that the player can only really play half a dozen different situations, and repeat those religiously and get great success with apparent complexity and different situations. That is rather like a chess player who slam the opponent very hard if six different opening strategies are followed a certain amount of moves. Does that qualify the chess player for the world championship? Probably not. But if he had the option to not drop in rating by disengaging from all chess matches where those six opening strategies weren't used (like we can disengage in eve whenever its not to our liking), then he could amass a record chess rating. All the fights not taken mask both the skill in recognizing that a situation would be disadvantageous to the point where a loss would result regardless (that it would be a check-mate as it were), but all fights not taken also mask the lack of skill when a player simply disengages from every unfamiliar situation. So a green killboard is literally meaningless as far as skill determination is concerned. There are people with green killboards who absolutely shine in every situation, then there are also those who simply disengage from and avoid all unfamiliar situations for lack of insight. And everyone of course thinks they are the former, because either they really are very skilled, or they are under the Dunning-Kruger effect. 
---
The difference in Goonswarm is that we don't care which you are, its a game, and it doesn't hurt the alliance if some random goon loses a ship taking a fight that maybe he shouldn't have, or taking a fight that maybe he is not skilled enough to deal with. We don't care. Go do stuff, whatever you want, and bring a hundred goons with you, have a laugh.
---
It is possible. But since you have to ask this question, I doubt you'll get one.
---
I'm partial to a cap boosted brick tanked neuting Dragoon for micro-gang stuff.

Honestly. Avoid Brave like the plague right now. It's kinda a shitshow internally and not very fun. Horde are far better organised and will take care of the newer player far better. Not sure about karmafleet.
---
dont forget a hotter ceo
---
Don't listen too much to the reddit hate mob.
---
Goons are where you want to go if you want in on the big fights.  They are also the place you want to go if you want to be able to make enough isk to eventually get into a cap ship.
---
You don't have to stay there forever, but between the free newbee ship programs, gooniversity, and the free skillbooks + implants it is a good place to go.  I am pretty sure they give out free salvage ships too.
---
PH will let absolutely anyone in, so it is so riddled with spies and awox alts that a not insignificant number of times their fleets have been blown up by people in their own fleet.
---
The reason it takes so long to get into KF is that it is the place people want to go.  Give the recruiters some time to review your application, and be patient.

Forgive me Bob for I have sinned, there's been over a year and a half since I stopped doing PI on 3 maxed toons.

I think you won the "most boring post" award for today.

Okay thanks ☺️

You know nothing Marcus Snow.

..."and not a bot to hear"... - love that line, cause in deployment, or in the Northern Drones you can't hear them cause Period Basis and Querious are too far from there and in the back(bone)-yard of Delve... where the new bot-armies are now life and work - for Mittani's wealth.
---
how much isk/h should i expect for just casually running null burners? single character, one or two hour sessions. relatively high number of agents available in close proximity. boosters optional, i'd rather not have to bother resupplying often.
---
just trying to figure out if it's worth importing a few lower end (some bling is ok) frigates and maybe a heavy hitter to clear in-between missions if needed, to pick up some lp every once in a while.
---
Unsure where verites at with that
---
It's voluntary. We don't get paid to do it, we don't get any advantages in corp, hell we still have to make our fleets or get purged just like any other member. 
---
So we take our free time, to instead of playing the game and enjoying it, going through apps to help new players get in and at the same time, act as the initial screen to avoid the drama/awoxers and general dbags you don't want to interact with.
---
If you get into KF, read up on it and join the team, the team is usually always looking for people to help with the task, not many people jump at the opportunity to do free work with their valuable time.
---
It’s okay, as I said u can pm me ingame anytime ☺️
---
And if someone feels attacked by me iam sorry, wasn’t my attention ☺️
---
Glad you enjoyed it, that's the great thing about music and poems, everyone gets their own message from it. Whatever connects with you, I'm cool with it! :)
---
I guess I would do that if u teach me what to do and how to do
---
It's still in the redeeming queue
---
My alt will finish her FAX training.
---
Don't know if we're still memeing or talking about depots but even at 250m3 a dst could carry over 200 of them. Just make them destroyable without any bullshit timers.
---
Actually really enjoyed this. Keep up the practice!

Thank you &lt;3

T2 sentry drones, I put that one off for far too long.
---
Decades feels too short, tbh.  Time for some quick rough math before bed.  =D
---
First,  we assume the system is a flat plane.  Treating it as a sphere doesn't make sense as warp points to make a safe with are roughly on the same plane.  Ignoring burning up or down and off-plane points like anoms means we are skewing the field in favor of the stabbers but makes our life much easier.
---
Next, let's assume the stabbers can go an absurd 10,000m/s.  They fly perfectly, never overlapping or checking the same space twice.  We will ignore the little bit of extra space checked when the search is first begun and when it ends due to the search area being a circle instead of a line.  Each stabber then checks 50,000,000 m2 per second.  (5000m "sweep" x 10000m speed.)
---
The area to be searched is a whopping (4.4x10^25)-ish m2.  Say we are happy with 50-50 odds of finding the camper and will search only half that area.  2.2e25 m2 / 5000000 m2 / 120 gives us 3.6e+15 seconds.  Oh boy.  Converting to decades leaves us with a nice, readable 11.6 million.  
---
I think we need more stabbers.
---
Not going to beg in Jita. Didn't even do that in real life when I was homeless. I might have enough collateral. At least going by estimated value.
---
What are the current profits for T3, 4, and 5 abyssal sites? I know that somebody did 50 runs of each a while back, but I also know that the market values of drops have changed significantly since then.
---
lil bit closer to a super

Will sell the 40m+ SP that my accounts produce, to buy PLEX to grow 45 more accounts above 5m SP (half of which it is already covered thanks to CCP rewards).

im itching to get this too.

How much was bots? And of that how soon til a new bot is online and taking that ones place. 
---
Til ccp really addresses the bot issue, the game really is broken.
---
I'm the creator of the spreadsheet you linked. As others have stated I use the EveMarketer API. That sheet will only update prices when an item is updated. Meaning if you insert all the items you want, and then just leave the sheet open its not going to refresh. 
---
You can force a refresh by typing a new item name in one of the rows, or you can setup an auto refresh in the gsheet settings (ask google for a guide)
---
There is no wait, if you pay the 5bil ISK processing fee, like the rest of us did.
---
sweet
---
Is the corax slightly less trash tier with the recent change?
---
how many fax alt is too many these days.   
---
i got a few too. :)
---
CHH H hHH  ugh it. dude. don't let it go stale.
---
Ah i see, wouldn’t be a problem but no thx 😉
---
nice. nyx or hel ?
---
can i let you nipple my nibbles for 1 ?
---
Thank you for doing the math, i was too lazy, bit yeah, my estimate was also "a bit" of. 
---
And considering THAT calculation is for 2d space.
---
Sometimes i forget how unimaginably crazy big the space is and it always hits me like a truck. :D
---
We always need more stabbers.
---
Fuck this. I'm not going to even risk my ship even going to an signal for a 50k payout. Also, Ghost sites. 
---
If you really want this, make some special cancer-null-sites.
---
"Content rich"

Plays EvE
---
Good one
---
Less weapon slots would allow for longer overheat also :)
---
If negating N+1 is a terrible idea, why do you complain about N+1?
---
I've got a whole stack of Lvl Vs sitting in my queue (like 6 mo worth). And I'm pretty sure if I dump all the SP in at once, it might finish off one of them. =(
---
Applied to an alt, used two extractors to extract and injected them to my main.
---
Gotta wash them before consuming.
---
Flair checks out
---
Amarr Cruisers V
---
Mmmm, Taco... Think I'm gonna take a detour to the store after work..
---
weapon upgrades V, amarr frigate V, recon ships IV and High Speed Maneuvering IV. Nothing too exciting, but should make certain situations easier, and i wanted to give the purifer a spin, been using a nemesis for too long.
---
you could get 2 medium level Vs done. almost. they are 760K each.
---
So you're saying I'm right, and you weren't invaded, you just moved.  Also considering WWB was the last time I played with PL in any real fashion all of your "you" statements above make it seem like *you* might not really know what you're talking about
---
hol' up.
---
There's an issue kind of like this on the Punisher. The window(?) lights on the front are uneven.
---
sweet. get that legion boi.
---
Fresh PVE server with optional PVP
---
War were declared.
---
Went right over your head.
---
Heavy Assault Missiles 5 and Heavy Assault Missile Specialization 4 so i can start building a 6/10 escalation Tengu. And because all the wormholers i talked to were like "T2 HAM doctrines."
---
get torpedo V and covert ops V. if you got noting else to do. you gonna need to get your rigging skills up for that fitting room. and go max max with a polarized purifier.   
---
or do something useful.
---
Fleet support skill that  need ze Charisma... Magus bby!
---
Training into a Tengu
---
Reminds me of the old days when gallente wore see through plastic clothing.

I kind of miss the alloys.
---
For verification purposes, please send a picture of you sticking a 3d printed rifter model in both private holes. 
---
Of course you will be well compensated.
---
legion, logi, tengu.  you just opened up an whole can of worms.   
---
and the sac. im in love with that ship.   
---
and why stop at 6/10. you can make the tengu do 10/10s easy. and for dirt cheap too.
---
Mindlinks always seem to sell

Large Hybrid Turret V, because apparently we're going to war. I'm sorry Caldari Cruiser 5, I'll be back another day...
---
The solar system map matches Mista, but Mista doesn't have a Station Hub like shown in the image, only a research station... or does that not matter. I'm a total noob in all this triglavian stuff.
---
Abyssal sites are min maxed, the problem is that the investment required vs the reward you get is pretty bad. 
---
Plus you can all ways get turbo fucked if you get bad RNG
---
I'm sure i will come to understand. But now i'm torn between going for T2 medium lasers and amarr cruiser 5 or T2 medium projectiles and minmatar cruiser 5.
---
☜(˚▽˚)☞
---
Ah right that works
---
Sorry, where do you see me complaining about N+1?
---
And I'm not saying fixing N+1 is a terrible idea, but a 50-ship fleet and a 200-ship fleet being equal literally makes no sense.
---
Simple and awesome
---
Damn guys sutch art and war hasnt event started yet can't wait to see and hear more of u guys in near future
---
personally [i had 20b worth of fun this week](https://zkillboard.com/character/94888963/ship/22430/year/2019/month/5/). hope next week will be as good as this one (◕‿↼ )
---
what do u wanna do ?     
---
medium lasers are pretty good on a legion. and they got a nice buff too.     
---
t2 projectiles are a easy choice for anyone who like to fly the loki or the HFI.
---
Recon Ships V

Who's your devil. Latch? huggun ?

I'm way too cool and edgy to use facebook. *deletes fb account

This could be hilarious...

Ok. So there was a ping about a fight on discord..... no that's not a bot tool..... It's a way of stopping eve players who don't mine or rat from playing other games and telling them something is actually happening for once... Yep, so all 200 hundred of us now sit in a Fortizar waiting for something to happen.... Yes, that's right we all sit here ... Well sometimes nothing happens and we all log off again ... no, this is just sub caps, the capital chars all log on somewhere else and wait in secret, we all pretend we don't know they are logged on because of spies ... no spies not pies ... OK, now we all follow this guy and he shouts at random people who are too drunk to follow instructions ... no that guy isn't drunk, he might be swedish ... ok, now we sit here in this system... no, we don't know why, spies might find out so no one here except for the FC has a clue what is going on ... OK here we go ... No, I don't know why the other side post all that crap in local either ... it's because they are goons I think, maybe its tradition?
---
Advanced industry V and then Capital Construction IV.
---
I've got a whole new market to explore now
---
Supers. and rorqs. only ever built rorqs. but dying to get my own super built.   
---
good luck o7
---
Which one of our campuses and activities did you enjoy the most?
---
Idea - abyssal deadspace, jump in mine the ore in time or die when it collapses.
---
As mentioned by other people in a previous thread, probably a leadership skill like Wing Command V. I can't see myself doing a re-spec just for that and shield command spec V.    :|
---
I'm on the haul to get my first nyx built, it's a damn chore
---
Well if you used the money wisely its not gonna hurt you. 
---
Problem is newbies rarely spend SP on things that are of the most importance.
---
That would be telling...
---
It's not a bug, it's feature
---
Cant speak for GSF, Bastion, TNT and LAWN, but for sure INIT and Test are killing eachother rorqual / super whatever we can.
---
I'm probably gonna end up going the amarr direction so i can fly the guardian.
---
 Nothing -  I have 2M SP unallocated now and I can never commit to using them for anything.  Maybe small energy turret but that just seems like a waste of time :D.
---
Destroyers are amazing, especially T3Ds. They're in a slightly weird spot right now thanks to assault frigates but overall they're some of my favorite ships. 
---
And yes, very competitive in nullsec.
---
main cap ships V 2 of my alts triage V and lesser alts into subcapitals
---
I hope the skills I took are fine, drones light missiles shield shipskills cpu powergrid etc
---
Been playing off and on for several years, entirely carebear. I'm at a point where I think I can sustain some pew-pew. 
---
I've trained up a fighting toon and am about to get my feet wet for literally the first time.
---
Wish me luck.
---
t2 cap guns. i mean.
---
&gt;use to compensate for the short-comings of the in-client tools.
---
The thing is I think a lot of the out of client tools work better specifically because they are out of client, like I wouldn't want to open eve everytime I wanted to see stuff like sov timers/structre timers.  That being said, there are certainly some things the client could do way better with the information that is displayed in client (e.g. the need to use an out of game tool to estimate prices because despite the client doing "estimates" it never is close to correct)
---
Dog, go outside.
---
When they removed nullification from the raptor, they modified the crow so that it is possible to be instawarp in it now.
---
Why isn't it cloaked?
---
On one toon I invested it in Doomsday Rapid Firing, another on FAX skills, but for my main I'm keeping it unassigned (along with the bonus points from other giveaways) in the vague hope that CCP eventually brings the AT back.
---
Great declaration of war. 
---
I loved the end "And not a bot to hear..." :)
---
At that time he was basically just a backseat person. Darius Johnson is the char you have to search if you wanna know what really went down
---
ⓝⓞ ⓤ
---
Yeh, those are all pretty good ones. Just don't forget the Navigation skill(people often forget these) and the missile support skills.
---
Every day is Friday afternoon at the Thrasher factory
---
not true. Frigate dark sites can be run with kestrels and hookbills (T1 trivialy, T2 can be done, T3 with high SP and piloting skills). the kestrel fit is like 5 mil, the hookbil about 20.
---
Yeah those are a thing now aren't they?  I figure the writing will be on the wall soon when I get into fleets and can't fly the doctrine fits.  But that is a good suggestion.  Thank you
---
i’m away from eve for a few days, but my Corp has just moved into a Wormhole for a week or two. I definitely look forward to joining them when I get back.
---
&gt; Villlllllllllllllllll**l**y
---
Starting up FW with a fresh Amarr toon, I've put it all in drones which is a category of skills completely off remap.
---
see you on the battlefield.
---
Eh the only reason i care(d) about bots was that they ruined the economy.   
---
I have very little doubt that the devaluation of isk ( or increase in value of plex) is very heavily related to the rampant botting and rmt that goes on within eve. Sure CCP say they care and banned a couple of hundred accounts recently, too little too late.  
---
Oh and since the Chinese have mass migrated to TQ this problem isnt going to get better.
---
So with the 2m+ SP I have that'll leave me about a week to 10 days. Not bad!
---
I watched the eve recommendation in ship masteries, all for me important ships are on lvl 3 and the ship skills to fly them most 4
---
I haven’t been able to log on yet but Logi V when I eventually do
---
Thank you, it doesn’t seem to work :(
---
Also what is « Markup » ?
---
capital ships V 😎
---
Sadly, youre more likely to find a unpiloted titan or super
---
Plex was around 500m in 2012. So it probably would be closer to 300m in 2009
---
good choice.
---
WWB ended.
---
1 year later: nothing of note happened.
---
2 years later: Imperium deploys north, kills some KSs.
---
3 years later: nothing of note happens.
---
50m hawks x3
---
hahaha that's just lazy as fuck.
---
"BoB them"..
---
Didnt goons win the war against bob?
---
Also answer. Grow your alliance till you can stand toe to toe
---
im doing t3 production atm. you have it easy.
---
I looked at t3 production. Said nope
---
Ah ok, you should be good then. 
---
Its just i've seen newbs get things like T2 Medium guns with zero support skills and people flying T2 ships without being able to use a lot of T2 modules. 
---
Worst caste i saw was someone who was flying pirate faction cruisers with both the cruiser skils at 2 and had literally all the navigation skills at 1 or 2.
---
Basically find the least boring way to make isk and then use the money to buy PvP ships and go try to blow somebody  else’s ship up.
---
just when everyone has been set on the course for five years, the cloaky camper warps to a safespot behind the line
---
CCP Sreggs iirc, left quite some time ago.
---
I got everything that I thought I need as „core“ on min 4.
---
If I missed some skills I can buy some inventors to fix it fast ☺️
---
Just join ASCEE, it's basically the same thing with quicker turnaround.
---
If I remember correctly, ships have to be in that 2000m radius at the tick.  I can't verify my claim from here though, but if that is true.... Rip your math :p
---
Don't forget the bhal :)
---
The spreadsheets man. makes you dizzy at times.
---
JDC V
---
Sort and Snuff are probably at the top of that list
---
I might get into t2 production eventually, I'mma just wing it. No spreadsheets
---
you are gonna loose your mid without it
---
You are the 2nd that said it.
---
I’m cool with it being a null-only phenomenon, given that system ownership is such a fleeting concept in who space.
---
My first thought is grr gon hat gon, but that is some good propaganda right there
---
It's not just the region. I don't PvE anymore at all. I wouldn't dream of leaving KarmaFleet.
---
Why does being isk positive matter? It’s not like when you blow them up their isk loss is deposited into your account.
---
yeah dw :) gonna grab it all tonight. its like 180 days from Christmas for that stuff so still got a while.
---
I would pve too cause iam new, but mostly just to get isk for pvp ships etc
---
Cybernetics V, so my +5s can make all my other training faster.
---
My first time in a wormhole I had a covops but hadn't trained the covert cloaking skill and had a normal cloak. This sounds dumb because it absolutely was.
---
I was like 2 jumps from jita and had no idea what I was doing because I was so new, so I went in and there was a sabre on the other side of the hole. I had no idea what a sabre was, so I tried to mwd=&gt;cloak trick (having never practiced this before) - proceeded to get bubbled and die a horrible death.
---
I learned a lot that day.
---
I did the same thing recently. It’s amazing. Be prepared to experience a whole different side of the game. Shoutout to all my corp guys who sat down and taught me as much as they could in the last month or two. Good luck and I hope the game takes on a whole new meaning for you.
---
Thank you guys for the advice. I really enjoyed the WH campus and null sec. I didn’t get around to do the LS, so maybe I should try that for a bit before I leave
---
Ok but now put cardi B on the track
---
OP isn't exactly wrong, then.
---
Thanks for the hardwork Toni!
---
Who flies ham doctrin when you can just use drekas?
---
I'll save them on my main for when I lose a t3c.
---
Alts just continue the training que
---
Goons haven’t had many fleets in geminate at all. 
---
And the real question is, would you rather fly halfway across New Eden for some content, or let it come to you?
---
Personally I like staying isk-positive because that's my metric of effectiveness. I don't get much joy out of nuking a 5m frigate setup in a 450m cruiser setup, as an example.
---
That is like when you do a bad number on your sideburns and look in the mirror when driving somewhere
---
If you *have a screenshot* of that date and time, you have a case and can legitimately complain to CCP for your million.
---
If you don't... Good luck.
---
Yep, I was in Init for a while and am not contesting that at all, you guys definitely kill lots of Test rorqs and Test has killed its share of your rorqs. 
---
But there’s a reason I said goons instead of Imperium there.
---
It doesn't matter in the end ofc, but it's one of those things people get hung up on in this game especially for krabbers learning pvp
---
Can't control that attitude unfortunately
---
Don’t forgot to drink your Ovaltine!
---
Unless you've maxed your slots, just use jump clones or ceptors for different markets imo.
---
Precursor cruiser 5, not that I’ve even tried the vedmak yet..
---
Not decided for my alts yet.
---
You can hear that from me too "EvE is doomed to the same destiny like Serenity" And I have no prferences for any of you sov-milking-anom-grinding mongs (ingame) I hate Goons as much as PanFam.
---
It isnt damage control for any side just stating the fact that today you dominate this game more than any entity in the history of EVE with grinding rocks in multiboxes for hours ... dayly. And that any other way of mattering in this game was patched away ...
---
Hard to get a screenshot after the account went Alpha. But it doesn't seem too difficult to verify that Pilot's Services gives a date and a time but you still reverts to Alpha at server reset of the day it's due to revert, but before the time Pilot's Services says it will. Easy thing to recreate.
---
no we dont
---
wew
---
Ty
---
It might be an easy thing to recreate, but CCP (and honestly every company ever) will generally not be bothered to do shit unless you shove actual proof in their face.
---
Literally everyone I know uses FB and has a profile
---
Got em
---
Ore (mined by ships) gets refined in refineries into minerals that are used when you build a ship from a blueprint. 
---
That's the very basics. You should pick up a shuttle or ammo BPO and go give it a try.
---
When you understand that you can look into bonuses / skills and all that.
---
With regards to industry I'll give you the same advice I give to all new players and how I started myself. Go build rigs.
---
BPOs are cheap and research fast and it's low volume (m3) so easy shipping.
---
Sales volumes are good cause almost all ships use them.
---
Homeboi there has either 0 engagement with his own alliance or a very low-effort spy alt.
---
it really isn't tho, isk efficiency is easily inflatable by blobbing just like most other metrics. the only one that's somewhat relevant is point efficiency
---
Idk why I never thought of just making one myself. I still have a diplomatic shuttle blueprint that’d be perfect to try with.
---
Me?
---
That's *my* metric of effectiveness. I don't blob. If I'm in a fight it's a handful of people at most.
---
Nah, Providence guy. Missing the mark more than a little bit.
---
I only have 2 clone slots sadly. One for implants, one for not risking a 4B pod. :(
---
I’ve been using a blockade runner to go back and forth because it’s got decent storage size, but it can get pretty tiresome to go like Dixie, to jita, to genesis, to amarr, for example. So having an alt in the further ones would be quite nice. Though I suppose I could do the same thing with an alpha account.
---
advanced weapon upgrades V, simply because it annoys me sooo much if I run into fitting issues because I'm missing 0.1 powergrid
---
Thanks I wouldn't have spent 45 min on it but it's nice to see. Looks to me like the description of a system and I'd bet it's where they plan on taking SOV.
---
It's also absolutely hilarious to watch hordelings tweak out over us "having a spy in their comms" when we our guys with horde alts aren't online!
---
Ah thx bud, found some nice stuff &amp; blogs about a 2012-CCP-AntiBot-Campaign XD
---
Good, you've already done more than most newbies then.
---
You dont get a 100% lignup on the ship, is why they are off
---
The NIP is about sov / structure,  not cap. But like i say, i m not in goon.
---
Shhhh
---
Im sitting on it but I realllllly want to cross train for a curse. Seems like a fun solo ship.
---
Had 5 alt with it, injected Sabre+deacon skill on my second sub alt, Large Hybrid turret T2 on my main subalt, T2 projectile turret for my soonTM nagflar, guns skill for my supers alt wanna be dread pilot, even more perfect skill for a rorq alt :D
---
What do you mean by double SRP?
---
EvE is Real
---
This is good if only the more expensive and skill required ships where good it would be brutal to new players.
---
Lately? I've had the man pegged for a turncoat since at least 2013 Fountain era.
---
Unsubbing is OP and an obvious exploit.
---
I doubt Hilmar even knows that Lowsec exists in this game ....
---
Sounds great. Can I join?
---
Ah okay good ☺️
---
Cringy.
---
You goddamn right it is!
---
Who wouldn't want to be the first actual space pirate in history? 
---
Damn that would be awesome.
---
Makes me happy tbh
---
Ted Cruz in EVE Online would be like serving a wedding cake in bite size chunks.
---
Only, he wouldn’t taste nearly as good.
---
I finished my golem and widow training queue, I'm still hoping the widow will get a buff after the ecm nerfs
---
The Alliance offers SRP and the Corp pays SRP on top of that.  There are even corp exclusive stuff like the trig ships that we covered the moment they came out.  It our Corp you cannot lose an Alliance doctrine ship and lose money, we always throttle our SRP to completely cover them. On stuff like Logi you make a ton of money.
---
Yes, if you send me your ISK I'll double them and return them
---
"Uh.. is this where we sign up for the goon circle jerk?"
---
Looking forward to this
---
Caldari Cruiser V on main and Caldari Industrial V on alt. No idea what i gonna use it for on my other alts tho. Probably just extract.
---
I never had one to begin with :D
---
Im going to use it for CPU Management 5
---
That's still ISK positive though
---
How do you ene translate Triglavian

Don’t discriminate my dude #beanlivesmatter

https://twitter.com/ccp_peligro/status/1126496159407792128?s=21 show me on the pie chart where the goonswarm bots touched you...oh wait...my bad. It’s the 16% of them that are in the north that I must’ve been thinking of.
---
Got any particular recommendations for a 6-7 man gang? I've been looking at doing t1-only roams just to see what we can get
---
Leave it unused for now.
---
Some day I will want to do X without waiting to train it. On that day I will use the SP.
---
hello windsigh, I appreciate you also living the blops dream, could you let me kill the sin please UwU
---
I undocked a Tristan earlier this week and zero goons came to kill it. I’m a complete newbean, it would have been so easy! 0/10 hunting skills
---
A machine in the guise of a man must not be suffered to esist. It is anathema to all of creation. That cringe factor you feel, are the scores and scores of robotic entities used by the Grey and Black skull to sustain their way of life. They do not see that He, The Spod Emperor, protects. He protects life, your life and mine, and our right to exist without the dread spectre of complete human gensoside at the hands of the machine intelligence. They play with fire for their own economic gains but are too ignorant and irresponsible to see that their actions would lead us down the path of total annihilation.

[Oh boy you gonna love this](http://imgur.com/a/XruaA)

I'm actually starting a new character today to try to learn how to do that! I figure getting a hauling account will help with my mining, and jetcan mining seems like a laid back introduction to alts.
---
Thanks for the reply, and congrats on your titan work! It's so cool that it's all paying off!
---
Email support, theyll probably give you it anyway
---
That’s because karmafleet is sucking up all the newbie isk! The money has to come from somewhere!
---
That's not true

---
Well sure, in one way of thinking. I guess my mindset is weird in this regard. Generally when I purchase and fit a ship I think of it as "already lost" in my head.
---
So if I outfit a ship for 450 million and then proceed to kill 100m worth of ships, I'd consider myself 350m in the hole still.
---
i am thankful for all the content creators in eve.
---
Merkelchon, how would you describe karmafleet culture?
---
Well this was actually a thing when POSes were around, you could kill SMA which would drop ships. It wasnt just once when Titan got dropped this way.
---
OP is a moron, but please no more instanced bullshit.
---
There is a guy in Dorkness that like to gank miners. He normally types back in local to us. It is funny when newbies complain about spies, "he is here for the same reason you are. We expect any old mupet."
---
Well, never buying that.
---
I agree that it doesn't really do much against botters (who have the hauling infrastructure to move this stuff to wherever it needs to go) but the effect of this on "low SP" players is almost negligible. Alliance hauling services could get me 500 million ISK worth of 15th Tier Overseer's Effects from null to Jita for like, 5? 10 million? That's less than most corp tax rates. Hell, you could operate a 95% buyback program, at a small profit, even if you WEREN'T a JF pilot, and still not touch the loss most ratters are seeing from taxes anyway. Hell, bump it up to 96%, and the ratters would be doing BETTER than before. And even if you did cause them a loss, it'd be a loss of like, 10 or 20 million at the MOST, spread over like a full 20-25 hours of ratting. Peanuts, by any measure.
---
I mean, that's assuming you're ratting as part of a sov alliance (i.e., one that has access to jump freighters. If you have NO access to jump freighters, and you're just maverick ratting in a VNI, then a) do you even exist? and b) why is it so hard for you to get your loot back through the same camps you pushed a goddamned VNI through? Explorers seem to manage it just fine, and they didn't find a way to get PVE fit cruisers out there without a jump freighter. 
---
Like I said, I agree that this...doesn't really hurt bots, just because it adds only a trivial step that most botters already go through. But whenever these discussions come up someone always makes some variation of the appeal to think of the poor widdle alpha players who just wanna make some ISK like the big boys, but are being bullied by us shortsighted omegas. The only way this actually makes things harder for a low SP "player" is if that "player" is the cyno or WH emergency scanner alt of someone who wants an AFK ISK farm that doesn't take time away from their main.
---
Here's the thing about VNI botting: if something ever IS done about it, and it's not even likely it will, that thing will ALSO remove your nice, easy AFK farm.
---
finished my Loki training

EVE is not like other games. It doesn't have "end game" content like other MMOs. It's a sandbox. When you were a kid and you got into a sandbox, no one told you build a castle like this or like that. You just used your imagination and built whatever you wanted. Right?
---
Eve is like that. It provides you with virtual tools to do whatever it is that you feel like doing within the confines of the game's rules.
---
Good suggestion. My hatred for those Mem-Will skills (Structure Doomsday Operation, etc) is great.
---
I tend to use free SP gifts to hit weird outlier skills that don't fit reasonably into the common Int/Mem, Per/Will, Cha/Int or Will mapping regime (looking at you, hideous Mem-Cha Anchoring).
---
Maybe those pesky but important drone Mem-Per skills.
---
I could have gone my entire day without seeing that, thanks.
---
&gt;  me paid for their drinks. I also bought a bunch of bags of the salt licorice which is total catnip to Icelanders and had full bowls
---
I don't know if it was a shitty thing to kick people for, I might have kicked someone for something similar if I knew that a person was being purposefully culturally insensitive or trying to start a juvenile based on nationality. 
---
That said, you and I are probably in total agreement, there was absolutely *no fucking reason* to publicly dox someone. That was a bullshit thing to do. 
---
That said, I just wanted to point out, I think, that the other side was no saint either. Like I straight up said up there, I would kick someone for making even borderline comments that were intended even remotely to sound like "I am better than you because my country/nationality/race/political system is better than yours."
---
Well, Karmafleet is like a welfare country, hard to get into(legimately), but you know, good place to get yourself if not filthy rich, at least some decent space living standards
---
Horde is, well, Canada
---
As of yesterday, the answer was "no".
---
I appreciate those who come to provi and actually fight. And dont run round for 30minutes talking in local. You are true heros! gf in local.
---
Cheap cpu implant. Otherwise you can compact DDA or DCU to make it fit. Dual rep is definitely required.
---
Nice... So sad i will miss this one. T_T
---
What’s your in game name so Bo can get you moved to the top of the list?
---
r/eve is still dominated by anti-Imperium rebels, worth remembering the next time you see "everyone" doing something.
---
I don't know if it was a shitty thing to kick people for, because I might have kicked someone for something similar if I knew that a person was being purposefully culturally insensitive or trying to start a juvenile fight based on nationality.
---
That said, you and I are probably in total agreement, there was absolutely no fucking reason to publicly doxx someone. That was absolutely a bullshit thing to do.
---
So when the people responsible want to hold hands and have a come to Jesus moment about how great the eve community is for supporting them, I am going to point out--regardless of how much I get down voted--that "yeah, you should not have been doxxed, but I am not holding your hand, asshole."
---
From right to left you could clearly see CCP became more willingly to design bigger ships throughout the years
---
Anyway, nicely done
---
So, once I got my Ender 3, I thought that it would be cool to get one or two eve ships 3d printed.. And that didn't stop at that lol. All the ships are to scale, 1000meters = 100mm, except for Machariel, which I printed at pre-size reduction :)
---
It's crazy how tiny caldari ones are and how increasingly big newly introduced ones are.
---
In the future I plan to paint few of them with airbrush. Hopefuly that doesn't end the same as with "will print one or two" plan lol.
---
In some corporations you will find expensive implants (inlcuding those mentioned above) to be part of some doctrines and fully SRP'd.  
---
Or have lots of ISK.
---
period basis somewhere? omist?
---
I can vouch for this flair.
---
Two man ships pls
---
its easy just you the alphabet converter
---
Buy PLEX
---
yup, indeed :)
---
Salty that your "leaders" are picking up and running? Yes, just a bit. I admit to some salt when it comes to my wars. I've spent the last year doing what buisy little bees should do. "Get more titans" "Get more Faxes" "Join Sigs and Squads" "Mine Delve for Delve" All in the hopes of the new war, new smug from Mittens. New verbal splooge from DBRB, Same monotone from Jay and everyone who sounds like him. That is what I want for my time investment, I am a drone, a warrior-bee, an Am0k. Fedaykin, and I do as The Spod Emperor of Goonking commands, in return this is my payoff, and now you cowardly cucks are giving up without even a fight?  
---
You got out thought by my commanders last war, you have a chance to prove you aren't pedestrian fortnight gamers, but actual elite strategists and tactitians. Instead of stepping up though, NCdotte is stepping out.
---

---
Thank you! We aim to please.
---
And you'll do that how? Loaning it back to me with interest :).
---
Pretty sick video. Well done
---
the dragoon is ridiculously slow, you won't be able to force anyone into its neut range, they'll just keep at long point range. You're also overestimating his neuting strenght it seems, it doesn't get any bonus to cycle time or neut strenght, just range(and not that much).
---
Now I'm jealous of horde beans.
---
what is a permaband hat?
---
More salt than even code could handle.
---
Woah. Nicely done
---
Should be 30days to be able to get it not 16days it is insane taight time window.
---
Where did you get the files to print? I’m pretty close to ordering a printer just to make Eve ships.. lol
---
I have 15 years of history in this game, I built the first capital ships with Emerald Sky and Corp 2, Once respected now completely forgotten. I got everything stollen from me and went to lowsec to pehvehpeh after being a carebear for years. I still have one of the first 10 moros ever built. 
---
Then I turned into a dirty no good evil pirate, and it was glorious, I treasure every single salt eve-mail with delicious carebear tears like a photobalbum of family pictures. That was all before I joined goons in 2010 with Am0k. No it isn't the fact that we happen to be on top or whatever, the loss of my story, all our stories, would make me never want to play this game again if there was a reset.
---
It's the story, yours, mine, ours that make this game a good game, because lets face it, on an actual playability level it is clunky and very much obsolete.
---
BY PLEX
---
And then theres the guys with 15 rorquals and doing it fast af.
---
&gt;can run from cruisers.
---
no they can't
---
I'm a day late but I'll probably put it towards Fighters V for those dank ticks
---
Join PH dude, I’m new to the game and having a blast
---
Im going to enjoy this
---
Excuse me, that happens to be a time-honored tradition!
---
The Rokh isn't quite the penis extension I always thought it was. Caldari bois must be hung.
---
train infomorph then
---
But if you don't get the sweet sweet pony icon is it really worth it? Are you really even in goons?
---
&gt;the only one that's somewhat relevant is point efficiency
---
which is also easily inflatable by blobbing.
---
Astronautic Engineering V

I took 15 days off of Light Fighters V. Now, in roughly two months, I will have perfect super skills. #ThisIsWhatA2006PlayersSkillQueueLooksLike
---
You put it into something off-spec. Like command skills.
---
It's a social media website, for people with social lives beyond the game. So in other words, none of us.

"I have no use for your attention. "
---
This implies you do want attention just not his.
---
Whom do you seek attention from? I am curious.
---
Was it ever revealed why Dust ended up on just PS3?
---
Was it funded by sony or did someone go full retard?
---
There’s already been a mutiny on board a space station, does that count? 
---
Granted it only lasted one day, but still, might be enough
---
TIL there’s concord LP
---
My understanding is if you're flying an Omega ship when your sub times out it doesn't kick you out of the ship in the middle of space, it just won't let you undock with it once you dock or use any omega modules
---
What he's saying is that there's a difference between an alliance dropping in a fleet, and independent pilots doing independent things.
---
If Hudders (for example) drops his Titan or some shit on my gang, with a few buddies, that's fucking Hudders.
---
If he drops an actual fleet, that's INIT dropping.
---
Conversely, if I brawl you, and then myself and a buddy drop our Nyxes on you, that's not the Alliance dropping it's fleet on you, it's a few bozos with nothing better to do
---
I got it about 2 week prior to the XVI Anniversary Celebration started but thought I had enough time in to complete the Celebration because of the end time given in Pilot's Services. I'll need to do some time in fc to be able to cash out the Insignia I've been hoarding in the meantime.
---
Jove space?
---
Ccpls fix logging out
---
Oh, newbro....just no, my heart feels for you.
---
So, like, I know you can't sell them because CCP is CCP.
---
But, if I was to *donate a sum of money to you as a charitable gift,* could you then send me a completely free and un-suable set of these?
---
thats a lot of duckets
---
I too would love to get the file for these hard to find high quality prints
---
The fruity ones.
---
One of us could probably do some work on this thread and post it somewhere for him, since he's already done the heavy lifting.
---
Google translate of course.
---
You might like them for their price and damage, and someone else (like me) might dislike them for their fragility, lack of utility, and slow speed. Even cruisers tend to out-run them.
---
[there you go](https://github.com/Kyle-Cerniglia/EvE-3D-Printing/tree/master/ships)
---
It is a good place to be. I will warn you though, I vouched in a friend and it still took 2 months and that was when we were at peace. Also, your exchange with Bo below probably isn't painting you in the most favorable light. I recommend patience and learning survival tactics while you wait.
---
lol, that took way longer to print than I am willing to do again. But you can get ender 3 for ~180€ and print them yourself :P
---
But when Hudders or ek tecnic or Cornak or whatever member of Test drop their supers on anything that moves, to the point that a large percentage of the time you take your gang out, you get dropped on by members of Test, it would be safe to say that Test drops supers on everything that moves.
---
Especially if Test we're using that fact to recruit.
---
So many favorites in there, if I had to pink one to paint myself it would have to be the Nightmare.
---
Everyone seeks attention.
---
You are seeking mine atm.
---
no it's not. if u blob u get like 1 point per ship kill where as solo kills are usually worth tens of points. so no, it most definitely isn't  easily inflatable by blobbing.
---
this is really cool! I just got my first 3d printer to print EVE ships myself haha. Question, did you print them with the base or did you attach the base afterward? If you printed them with the base how did you get the print to stabilize with all that overhang?
---
He mean the Bonus Room in the Gurista Extravaganza or the Angels Extravaganza L4's.
---
I didn’t want to attack someone if someone feels like this iam sorry
---
for me it's abaddon :)
---
Isk efficiency as a solo roaming pilot is one of the purest metrics of competence in the game, provided you aren't seal clubbing VNIs for most of it.
---
I want that Machariel.
---
i printed them separately. I have split some of them into multiple parts to avoid supports :)
---
Destroyers are cheap and lovely. T3Ds used to be pretty awesome back when people did solo/micro pvp even in null.
---
r/eve is the last bastion of anti-Imperium rebels and holdouts, which is worth remembering the next time you see 'everyone' doing something. The winners feel no need to cry on public forums.
---
3-4 dragoons all running 4 neuts each is still more than enough to shit on any cruiser's capacitor.
---
Sounds like you know a lot of Europeans.
---
Ah cool cool, ya I have been running into the problem where the supports really ruin the details of the ship. What glue do you use to fuse the pieces together?
---
Oo wtb Macharil!!! How much does it cost?
---
GOOD SHIT LIZZ...TRAIN ZARMAZDSSSSSS
---
Nah, you can do it as a team. theres always multiple cans at the sites and you can scan twice as many systems.
---
You gotta be careful with that one...
---
i need dat Rokh!!!
---
lmao u call it the purest the proceed to add exceptions to it, great job. no it isn't, you could be killing tons of other expensive shit that doesn't shoot back. like excavator drones, haulers, explorers, etc. the point system actually takes into account the offensive/defensive capabilities and class of ships, so it is the most relevant. isk is just that, isk. can be anything
---
This is actually pretty awesome, nice job.
---
I vouch the vouches that vouch the vouches that vouch this vouch.
---
to print? ~180€ for printer and then like 50cents for material lol. I cannot sell them to you though :)
---
now count the amount of kills you can get blobbing in relation to the amount you can get solo'ing, especially in fleets with bigger targets.
---
Aayyyyy
---
Karmafleet is recruiting

Are you on the EVE-friendly 3D printing Discord? https://discord.gg/QVBSEQ

Yep, it's PvE.

You seriously can't count those poor victims as players.

We dont have to fly half way across the galaxy to find content in your space.  The pure response of this caliber only further shows how limited play styles are in PH.
---
Oh. You don't know about stain guy. Welcome to the community. Hope you have some fun.
---
just regular superglue :)
---
Joined horde on my third day after coming back to eve (alpha). Had so much fun my first week I resubbed my old account and bumped the new one to omega. I would definitely join up with horde. Then if for some reason you don't like it, you can accept the karmafleet invite when they get around to it. Then you have some experience in both and can compare.
---
It's tough waiting for a superior group I know.
---
IIRC, pre-resizing, Caldari dreads were the size of other races' battleships.
---
Thank you ! 
---
Do.. I have to know who he is ? Never heard his name in the game :/

The point system is okay-ish, but is somewhat arbitrary and can be gimmicky.

---
&gt;Having been a member of KarmaFleet for 4 years now, I can tell you this isn't the case.  At least not in KarmaFleet.  You will only be a number if you do not mingle with the community.  Get on comms, say hello, type in corp chat, say hello.  Get to know your corpmates.  I can tell you for a fact this is how it works in KarmaFleet.  I'm willing to bet this is how it is in any other corp as well.
---
Well.. there have to be people online in your corp for this to be so. If you type hello in corp chat and no one is online to see it, does it matter? (kind of like the bear in the woods, I suppose) 
---
I've done small alliances and I've done big, same with corps. Something larger corps/alliances bring is activity. There is always something going on and someone online to talk or hang out with. 
---
As for always being an F1 Monkey - only if you want to be. There is always work to be done, you just have to find what you like doing and do it. :)
---
Owning a titan, which I did, now I don't know anymore..
---
5 solo kills vs ships of roughly the same class/fit cost are about 100 points, usually even a bit more. if you're trying to tell me getting 100 blob kills is that much easier than getting 5 solo ones to the point where it can be considered easy inflation, you likely solo very little/not at all and don't really know what ur saying
---
alpha account gets 17 market slots. you could use multiple alphas though. log in / out as needed can get tiresome.
---
it's not perfect for sure. but it's many times more reliable than flat isk
---
Just look at a map, unless you guys burn a jump clone you are indeed flying halfway across the galaxy to get to geminate
---
I vouch for the users.
---
THE MERCOXIT MUST FLOW TOO!
---
Mining missions provide less overall reward, however, they can be ran in the frigates mentioned above so you are risking a lot less. 
---
In general mining mission can be rather dull, even compared to security missions. 
---
A happy medium would be blitzing level 3 missions in a strategic cruiser to build standings. Use a nullified cloaky t3c for this. Once you have enough level 4 standing, blitz the burner missions. These are the high lp missions thst can be completed in a garmur. The garmur itself is one of the fastest ships around so moving in it is sometimes safer. If you get scrammed though, wave bye bye to it. Blitzing level 4 burner missions is some of the best isk you can make.
---
I never got free sp. I don't need it.
---
&gt;micro-gang
---
&gt;3-4 dragoons just for the neut
---
now thats a nice meme. 
---
the dragoon neuts aren't bonused for neut power or cycle time, any ship that can fit 4 neuts will have the same effect as a dragoon sans range(which isn't all that high in the first place, and nerds can just burn away). It makes absolutely no sense to assume the dragoon will be able to be in range of the target when its that slow, at that point just switch the 3-4 dragoons for 3-4 no prop blaster catalysts and just assume you'll be at zero every time.
---
This may be hilarious to you, but that administration is actually sadly in place.
---
This was just another reminder.
---
To become part of a team of highly skilled tightly knit pilots. Done. Now I can retire in peace

---
thats how things go when everyone left is basically an incompetent retard
---
&gt;It's a Vidya game the goal is to have fun you retard
---
i'm just asking about peoples' personal goals and you go nuts.
---
Every game has goals and objectives.
---
Since EVE is a sandbox, its up the player to decide, and that's what I'm asking about.
---
Much like Merk's voice, KF's culture is like a smooth jazz solo warming your soul. Maybe a little EDM in there as well.
---
Look the argument boils down to you saying 'just the tip' is not penetration.  
---
I would argue you are the one who didn't expect anyone would go dig up your dead toaster rorqs to prove you were putting the tip in.
---
Point is, even just the tip is penetration.  We pulled back when you started to invade after tribute fell.
---
Also, didn't you go all drama queen over pa buying ccp last year?  I distinctly recall you saying after your subs ran out in april you were done with this game.  What happened with that?
---
Going in abyssal dead space until I group all components, skills and blueprints to build every trigalvian ships by myself.
---
When I first saw the Nyx model and how carriers worked (pre citadel) I decided I need one.
---
Now years and years later I fly one :)
---
i thought in space international waters law apply's?
---
I wanted to be an annoying dick since day 1. Flying instawarp stilettos in stain now and lemme tell you this
---
Im having fun
---
&gt;Every single game has goals and objectives.
---
And the only goal every single game has in common is to have fun.
---
Its crazy CCP will not make toys or models they have people who love the ships. They are gonna miss out on a good deal of money. hell I'd pay 50.00 to 60.00 dollars plus shipping and taxes.
---
i've recently come back and moved back into wormholes, it's more chill and actually seems pretty active compared to a few years ago. have only been completely opressed by a blob once and can usually get small skirmishes or ganks on the daily
---
RIP I'm already maxed in leadership.  I'm prob going racial dread or carrier, or going with Marauder.  Either way, I'm fitting up a solo something and going out in a blaze of glory (or getting dropped on and blapped).
---
Mine an entire ore belt all by myself.
---
I like mining and building so that just seemed like a good fit.
---
but since EVE is a sandbox, different players gave different answers.
---
Not sure what you mean by 'markup', feel free to join my discord (linked in the forums post for an easier conversation
---
There are a lot of small operations that are shit. But there's also small operations that do not suck and is still independent of a null sec bloc. Sure, you don't have a supercap fleet thst can jump to save you, but you have a good group of people who want to play. Being in a smaller group means being more active and having a bigger part in the success of the whole. 
---
If you as a line member in goons decided to not show up for something, it doesn't matter. If 1 man out of the 10 in the group doesn't show up, it's a bigger deal. 
---
Being in a major bloc means that you don't have to be active if you don't want to. It's attractive to a large player base. For some people being part of a small operation and having to fight tooth and nail against bigger groups is their idea of fun.
---
We need a tabletop game like Battlefleet Gothic, but for EVE. CCPlease make a licensing deal with Games Workshop for Battlefleet New Eden!
---
And she has a wonderful voice :)
---
SIGs and Squads my friend.
---
Since it's a Vidya game though, the only real goal is to have fun.  Any other goal is to support that.
---
If it's not fun, what the point of playing?
---
Unless you actually are retarded.
---
You can. You just cannot cloak.
---
can you take your awful ideas and go away
---
the last people we want ccp talking to is gw
---
&gt;There is nothing stopping people from taking the step up and getting api verified, its a good system
---
You're right, it is an \*amazing\* system. I love horde... except for when I have to be on their comms... or discord... or in-game with them. But I love horde :D

Toss up between snuff and specifically sort dragon at the head of whatever coalition he is in at any given time. Snuff have a well earned reputation for backstabbing and in general being villains living in hollowed out volcanoes. Sort dragon has a long history of flip flopping loyalties to whoever is strongest at the time, regardless of the consequences on his former allies. Goons are also pretty close to a 1, having a long history of morally dubious behaviour from their original roots as simple trolls and scammers into the more modern goon's method of organizing targeted bans, "flipping" hostile leadership, and playing CCP against their enemies.
---
Most trustworthy? Tough to say. Test maybe, despite their propensity for spin, they tend to be very reliable when it comes to keeping their word. Black legion should be pretty high on the list as well as a more or less honest mercenary entity. Those are the only two that really come to mind.
---
Yeah, but, like, what if you worked non stop without breaks at all - not even for food.
---
Bet they could do it in 24 hours.
---
Not as many as the 16% NC harbors!
---
GW makes fantastic, if expensive model kits with great support for the both the product and the community. It's a far cry from the GW even 5 years ago.
---
ok, and me asking people about their personal gameplays isn't retarded. its just like AskReddit.
---
henlo fren. let me get all the footage for a gulnar-style video i plan on releasing this summer, then you're welcome to ultradunk my sin  (/◠‿◠)/ ✿ &lt;&lt; that's a cyno

You can also get turbofucked when you exit it and your trace gets scanned down by hostiles.
---
Made my day, Ty.
---
No, it's retarded
---
I understand what you are saying, but don't you also think that with the built up power structures in the game that it also drives people away because there is zero chance any newer group is going to compete with the coalitions that exist today..
---
The current coalitions are too successful for the game world to be a health sandbox.. There has to be some sort of outside check to rebalance the game or the population will keep slowly dying out..

mind explaining why?

I'm just curious about what goals other players set.
---
From what I've seen, no one hates on horde like horde itself.  There is a culture of blaming the victim and those around them for not doing enough.  Rather than helping them out of dangerous situations.  It's a totally toxic place where people try to keep the name of the alliance clean by blaming the person.  There may be good people in it,  they just stay quiet when it matters.
---
Would you recommend the Ender 3? I'm looking at getting a 3d-printer for home use and there are just so many options.
---
Funny thing is Mittani didnt do shit, he kust knows when to take credit
---
Become someone relevant
---
holy shit ok then don't die please :)
---
Yeah it's awesome intro to 3d printing if you like tinkering with it :) if you don't want to tinker, just print, then probably something like prusa mk3 is better option

---
Just ignore stainguy, he’s nearly as bad at posting as wallymarts and he does it way more often. Also ignore any posts by wallymarts
---
There is a huge difference between drone and fighter mechanics.
---
In this context, mainly that it's trivial for a carrier to avoid fighter damage from rats while still keeping them on field and fighting. For drones, however, the only real option is to pull them and redeploy, which will trash their overall damage output. And the risk of losing drones during that action is still very high.
---
Dumpster fire with the test batphone because you’re so shit on your own? What’s new there?

I want to be the very best, like noone ever was

*quafe green is CAPSULEERS*
---
Amazing! God the things I would do to get my hands on something like this. I've been building and painting models for 20 years now and it's all I've wanted to do since I discovered eve in 2009
---
I now can't stop thinking of a frigate-sized Phoenix. Omg that'd be the cutest thing
---
You using a POS or doing it all from one ship?
---
You can, 3d printers are cheap these days :) ender 3 requires bit of tinkering, but costs ~180€ and one ship price to print is like 50cents
---
What does senator Ted Cruz have to do with the administration?
---
2 ships of the same class for one kill is already blob, and it sure as hell works quite well for farming low effort points. And its pretty easy to get 100 kills in nullblob fights, especially once carriers are involved and fighters come out. You can also unironically farm shuttles in an alt, eject a shit ton of shuttles and just keep popping them.
---
Disagree tbh. They’ve been very helpful to me, giving me ships and showing me the ropes.
---
They have been trained my dude.
---
can u stop using this shitty br tool please thanks
---
Do what the elites do. Buy PLEX with your cc. Inject inject inject. Nyx or Rorq your way to free-play for life. You have been given the gift of Eve's most sacred truths. Make it worth something and don't join GSF.
---
I cringe so hard when you guys say Casino war... HAHA the fact mittens makes you guys call it that just so he can feel like he controls the narrative is hilarious.
---
I just installed Eve again after 3 years away from the game. Apparently the PLEX are 4.5 bil now... My main character pretty much only has trade skills maxed out.  Here's my question : Is it still possible to plex your account trading in Jita? As of right now I have about 10 bil and a freighter. So minus the Plex that leaves me with 6 bil. Can I expect to make more than 4.5 bil in a month with that starting capital?
---
nice, the original apocalypse :D
---
Oh boi I'm saving this
---
And anything AOC has to say on anything.
---
I see a couple dildos and a spatula.
---
Chimera was smaller than Rokh at one point.
---
sounds bout right
---
I decided to train into an Archon after about 1 month in the game. That was in 2013, and I was in an ally of the late Nulli Secunda, which used slowcats that time a lot. I was also salvaging after ratting carriers in my Noctis as my source of income.
---
I was not aiming to just sit in the hull, though. I was already remapped to int/mem, as I thought on the long run good support skills will pay off. As a result of the combination of the two, I trained JDC V on my main in my first year and a bunch of other carrier support skills.
---
It eventually payed off. It was a good goal.
---
I'd say E-UNI in case you don't know about them.
---
Absolutely, in Eve you learn by dying.
---

---
Poor little Rohk
---
test with their fleet data collection scheme
---
Because jump fatigue is not the way to restrict fleet deployments. It was attached to the pilot, not the ship, and it's moving the ship around so fast, uncounterably and cheaply that is the problem.
---
An AU should equal 93 million miles, or 150 million kilometers.
---
was that the entire supercapital might of FIRE?
---
did u really need to call the the rest of legacy to deal with 1 corp and their alts?
---
My first long term goal was to get the final blow on a Titan (checked that box).  Now my goal is to blow up as much stuff as I can before I get bored or run out of isk.
---
Even if I'm flairbaited, it doesn't matter but I gotta say it:
---
Irony someone in Provi calling others dumpster.
---
Possible? Yes. Practical? No. If you have to ask here? Hell no.
---
Same here! Shooting space pixels is fun, but propaganda pixels gets the blood flowing.
---
292 vs 99, titans vs dreads, must have been a close call

---
PLS, for the love of Bob don't use that ******* BR tool
---
About six months ago, I ran into an issue where we had a small fleet invading a wormhole, and while we'd remembered to bring a staging POS, none of us had both the anchoring skill and the skill to fly the DST that the POS was in. I was able to use the free SP from the difficulties with local chat to instantly inject Anchoring and plant the stick. Having a limited amount of SP flexibility can be extremely useful.
---
If you don't anticipate the need for flexibility, then the tradeoff is between the most immediate use (whatever you're training now) and the most efficient use (whatever you want to train but don't want to map for).
---
This is awesome. Almost makes me want to jump back in... but ive already got a job...
---
Yeah mine too. It's kind of nice to have some 'oh yeah I want to be able to fly that' emergency stash.
---
Can it doubble my isk?
---
You just have to add it as a filter on the video call when you demand their booty.
---
man you are one salty bastard for no rhyme or reason
---
I used it on my main but my alts will save for a rainy day
---
A huge part about getting good at solo PVP is learning what fights you can take and what fights you can't.  The smaller your ship, the smaller your engagement envelope, but the easier it is for you to control what fights you take and what fights take you.
---
As for the scarcity piece, it's natural for people to want to group together in some way or another.  To make good fights more frequent, you can try the following:
---
1) Just keep roaming and looking for solo fights
---
2) Fly something *slightly* bigger that can survive longer in the fights
---
3) Try to "string them out", i.e. kite away and only engage the ones that pursue piecemeal
---
It’s the only consistently functional br tool currently since br.in got screwed by zkill.
---
Delete your post about it lmbo
---
This is cryptic. What do you mean not practical? Is there a more practical way to plex my account with a character that only has trading skills and a bunch of ISK? And what do you mean if I have to ask here? Where was I suppose to ask to make it more practical?
---
&gt; Most fits either get kited by frigates
---
right that's what the 50% optimal range bonus all of them have is for
---
&gt; or can't keep them tackled because most of them lack range control.
---
they have damage, of course they can't keep a dead ship tackled  
---
in fact many fits will drop the scram/point for prop/web for range control and still get kills
---
i've heard this same bs some two years ago and destroyers kept getting the dankest frags since then
---
The benefit is multiple years of experience. Skill points don't matter, ISK does not matter.
---
A co-worker or mine has a 3d printer, and said if I could get him the files he could print stuff for me. Could you give me some direction on how to start that process for Eve models? It'd be great if the end result was similar to what you have accomplished.
---
&gt;That said, you and I are probably in total agreement
---
We clearly aren't.
---
&gt;I would kick someone for making even borderline comments that were intended even remotely to sound like "I am better than you because my country/nationality/race/political system is better than yours."
---
And what if their political system is genuinely better?
---
Kudos for the song and editing....gj.  
---
Although be careful comparing Goons and Mitani to GoT considering Season 8
---
Whore his ass IRL to buy plexes obviously.
---
I wish the Rokh wasn't so small.
---
great thing about AVDOTS they always excel at next time even after a feed. 
---
while they still do rarely, they have no number issue afterwards which is an outlier among any other ones.
---
A true fearsome group of people. They won't sadly do much against meta blobs, but you simply can not ignore them.
---
grrr gon bad gon grrr

You are missing a raven or a golem. Those two have different hull models.

Or at least buy some Preparation H.

Dropfleet Commander is a better match

I biomassed my first toon a week or so after getting Omega and started new as a Gallente going down the Droneboat line working towards a Carrier eventually, I'm still at least 6-9mo from that.

I vouch for the vouches, pilots, products, and services above.
---
They're pretty fun though I personally think several of them need changes to fit their intended use better, Algos for example is a droneboat but lacks the lows for effective tank + dda, I'd prefer if it was 5/3/4 with 4 hardpoints. I'm less familiar with most of the other destroyers but I've heard similar opinions from people about them.
---
I know Liz is wonderful person.
---
Wow getting downvotes for replying to the topic at hand... You guys are great 😂😂😂
---
Thank you. One more reason to pull the trigger and buy a 3D printer
---
hmmmm
---
Collecting all the PI and minerals needed to build an athanor...totally not worth it isk wise, but fun to experience as a primarily non-industrial player.
---
I think the title should be '**BY TEST with support by FI.RE** '
---
one single corp won [FI.RE](https://FI.RE) several times, then fight against the whole legacy plus FI.RE, glorious.
---
Tell me about it, I just got anchoring V :( My goal of building my own athanor has driven me to extremes I did not initially expect.
---
I like how the caldari kinda go for advanced tech and functionality rather than trying to make the biggest ships.
---
I personally love jump fatigue, it is what allowed my organization to grow into capitals and super capitals without instantly getting dicked on. In fact I wish it was adjusted to be more penalized when moving captials/supers more than a jump or two away from your staging.
---
It is currently far too easy to move super fleets, a battle should be won or lost before you can travel across the game.
---
And push them farther back while at it, looks dumb where it is at.
---
Op is a karma farming retard
---
Awesome work!
---
its just an unassuming question
---
I have no idea what your comment is in reply to.
---
*docks T1 ship worth 20x cost of structure into said structure*
---
Pilot a Chimera.
---
Also finance an Omega semi passively.

Along the way I have shorter term goals like: pilot a manticore and a rook.
---
Love it!

The sub is a meme now
---
To catch them is my real test, to dunk them is my cause.
---
If it actually shows the name of the deploying pilot in local it would be too useful for this thread.
---
Your going to spend a lot of time dialing it in. If your easily frustrated probably should look elsewhere.
---
But it is a great value and you will know everything about the printer by the end if you stick with it.
---
No. I meant future damage can be prevented. Unfortunately, a lot of the damage done I don't believe can be fixed without a massive re-write of code/mechanics as too much water has gone under the bridge.
---
Destroyers are fun to fly (I particularly like the cormorant with its range bonuses, you can actually apply at point range or fleet engagement range). But they are paper thin, have few slots for utility and they're slow, so they definitely have problems.
---
How on earth did you get that Praxis to print.
---
In a van down by the river
---
Jump clones and wormholes are a thing my friend.
---
Multiple accounts. Am thinking of doing the same thing
---
What settings did you use? Given the detail, there's a 0.1mm layer height? How did you handle supports?
---
I now need to see these rust skins with the rust over time effect fully applied.
---
Blindly hit apply as usual.
---
They did, but it was 120-130 Euro to have them shipped. so all in all it costs me 400 USD for an Apoc that i lost in a house fire 6 weeks later. :(

And to think, back in 07-08 when I started eve I thought the Raven was this massive beast. It looks like a baby compared to some of the others.

Or all you wrote ist wrong, who knows

exactly why i came to the comments, prints look great but ive wanted repaired meshes for so long :D
---
Done pretty much everything I wanted, accomplished almost everything I set out to do. 
---
I fought my way to the top of the Faction Warfare of three different militias, dual-boxed numerous incursions and blood FOBs, went to 6 different invitational ATs/championships, unified nullsec  under three major coalitions, and soloed an endless cloud of dead Drifter response battleships. 
---
It's a legacy any capsuleer would be proud of, yet it is one that raises an obvious question: 
---
Why can't I reach my long term goal of getting my wife to let me play more than two hours on the weekend?
---

---
Actual long term goal: I once tried to shake the Mittani's hand.
---
Actually i prefer that behavior...that way i can quickly see through whicj systems my alt has traveled when i do alt-tab

I miss my high sp characters. Never shoulda sold em

---
really? how come? i thought all marauders and pirate ships share the same hull of their counterparts, but different paintjob? What's different between raven and golem?
---
What's this I hear about CCP not letting Alphas do level 4 missions?
---
There's not a word about it on uni wiki or CCP's own clone states page
---
That Apoc probably had Minmatar saboteurs as stowaways :P
---
0.15mm layer height, all of them were cut-up in various ways to avoid supports which ruin details :)
---
I know it's not a concept beans are used to, but instead of traveling all that long way, you can deploy and stage elsewhere.
---
thats texas law your thinking about.
---
separate parts :) single layer stuff for maelstrom. had to model my own for tempest as the model was all whacky
---
Did you print them in PLA? If so, what glue did you use? I have some issues with that ;-)
---
The tutorial. Then the other tutorial(career agents)
---
PLA and regular superglue :)
---
same! The culprit is that old eve trailer with the Abaddon with the superweapon on it.
---
they don't really look good, and perhaps they should you know, do this as the default look instead of grabbing some more of that sweet mtx money
---
To Fly super capital ships without ever having to pay for the game by using passive income sources. It worked (started when Alphas became a thing)
---
Well if I am I'm sure CCP will figure that out.
---
I extracted the shit out of that. By the time I had extracted all of my accounts injector prices had dropped ~40m per unit. Lots of people had the same idea, it seems.
---
Bleh
---
There's still tons of fights to be had even under the most oppressive super umbrellas if you know where to look. The bigger problem these days is that small gangs aren't a threat to supers and rorquals so they have no incentive to dock up and come clear you out. This leads people to get into those ships, and each one that is generates less content unless you've got a whaling fleet or a dreadbomb.
---
You can still catch lots of VNIs and subcaps if you put in the effort, and those folks will dock up and try and give you a fight. Just fly shit that can mostly avoid the cap umbrellas, and be mindful of going into dead end systems.
---
Omfg yes. Gonna pring one this fall when I get access to my school's printer
---
You're expecting CCP to pay attention to 3rd party developers?
---
What year do you think this is, 2010?
---
/s but true :(
---
Nothing says best like having to run a cap booster just to fire your guns while being locked into one damage type.
---
But hey, you can at least pretend you're Gallente or Caldari a bit.
---
You mean the veterans who make a lot of money that gets taxed.
---
for me it's because i spent so much time flying it equiped tachyons, running L4's :) just loved that fat brick firing it's laz0rs
---
Can you commit to using ~2b? That's the net profit on 2m SP
---
train into basilisks for the upcoming war
---
Having a base in hisec and visiting low/null doing exploration can net you very good is for a low sp and isk investment. For the next step I would read up on abyssals and gear my training towards that. Requires more isk investment and SP, but pays alot better. Once you have some cash I would look into reactions
---
Agree. I don’t get why it’s so far to the front with the Sabre but right in the middle of the Naga.
---
damn, now I want to get my own 3D Printer too
---
I may or may not have flown a Nightmare named "Satan's Speculum"...

Smart. It’s a useful skill and required to fly many top tier doctrines, like feroxes and jackdaws
---
Sorry for Your house. I hope You have been able to rebuild.
---
Theses sizes look off. No way the Rokh is that small.
---
Also, despite what many say, goons also have smaller cultures that you can be a part of. While they are not separated by corporations like other entities, they exist in the form of Special Interest Groups (SIG) and Squads.
---
To do everything and quit.
---
They just nerfed carriers, supers, and HAW titans to make them less oppressive and easier to deal with.
---
They added triglavian ships, which are very powerful in a small gang setting but often not effective in a large fleet setting. Although some of those do need to be tuned down, for example the kikimora is insanely oppressive to other destroyers and a lot of frigates, even if they fit to counter it.
---
People only play eve bc their friends do. Their friends only play eve bc their friends do. Their friends only play eve bc their friends do...
---
So the kikimora.

What's a vouch and how much does it cost?

uselss. you can train a neural net to solve it in about 100 generations, just setup your net with a bunch of hidden nodes and feed in the pixel data.
---
Hell nvidia has an AI that can in real time turn a video, live video from night time to day time, or from winter to summer, snow / leaves and all, dont even mention the fake porn with ai putting fake faces over human faces live and you think capatcha will stop a half decently written bot ?
---
I like flying destroyers here and there, usually as support for bigger fleets, but for solo and small gang I much prefer cruiser and above. Solo battleship is what I wish I could do all the time, but unfortunately it means you get capitals dropped on you most of the time.
---
When I started I was kinda just shooting at the next thing I though looked cool. Very first goal was a Dramiel, which I got by the 2nd or third week. Next was a Cynabal then a Vagabond. When I moved out to null I decided to train into a cap (when not training doctrine ships) and chose the Chimera because it looked the coolest.
---
2 large skill injector for me

Now that is super cool!!!!

You think the average botter has the AI resources of Nvidia?
---
you think a neural net is hard to code?
---
You talk to 20k people? Impressive.
---
If you're managing to make some isk presently, I'd focus not as much on making a tonne more, but more on doing what you find fun.    Try out exploration (both hacking and combat sites), FW plexing/missions, or more industry stuff.  I have a limited appetite for industry so I only do the first couple steps then cash out.    Some people enjoy PI and min/maxing mining -&gt; refining -&gt; production etc, and if you find it fun, do it!
---
Perhaps pick a certain T2 ship and look at doing end-to-end production for it.
---
Nice flex, bro.
---
Yeah, it's a bitch of a train, but if you fly bombers pretty often, the damage boost is really significant
---
No thanks
---
One of the things goons/KF offers is this:  No matter what you want to do, there are people who have been ther, done that, and can mentor you along the way if that is what you want to do.  Want to solo or small gang?  There's a goon for that.  Want explo?  There's a goon for that.  Want big fleets?  There's tons of goons for that.  Want to learn manufacturing, station trading, hauling, there's goons for that.  Hell, I've even heard we have a few that can help you get into rorq mining if that's your thing. You name it, goons have done it, figured it out, and are ready to help you get into it.
---
America was never great
---
Mainly just a cloaky ship that I rotate depending. They have a hs static so I just drop loot off when it's a good connection.
---
Have an Movile depot as well in case I need to refit for pvp.

When i was playing we avgd 50k. So yeah

'Dat Marshall though
---
The Nightmare is all alone as the only v e r t i c a l battle ship

is it just me or does ted cruz look even more fucking stupid than usual?
---
My dev page looks nothing like this.
---
If you want one that just _works_, go with a Prusa (but don't get a multimaterial upgrade, or else you'll be like me and spend 50+ hours over the course of the year fighting with it to get it to function)
---
Deagress your faction titans?  DDoS and spamming cynos and ECM bursts to try to cause disconnects?  Yup - all of these things sound like fantastic examples of a "good fight."

To make this clear: while the reason is, that there was a lot of L4 Distribution Mission bots, it is a restriction for all types of L4 Missions.
---
Finally got around to making archaeology and hacking level five, put the remainder towards capital training for the first time. Both probably solid investments.
---
I upvoted this.

Are the models on scale with each other? Some look rather small compared to others!

He means its probably not practical to make the nessecary profits to plex successfully unless you are so rich that it already shouldnt be a problem to plex anyways.
---
MASTERY V OMG
---
It actually is.
---
Game lists Rokh as being 1025m on the long axis. Marshal, for example (to the top of it on the image) is listed as 1884m on the long axis. Abaddon would be 1254m long, and Apocalypse at 1550m long.
---
I joined KF 1 month into the game (no wallet injecting, brand new noob).  KF/Goons gave me a mentor, gave me free ships and skillbooks, helped me plan character progression into things that I wanted to do, etc. etc. etc.  
---
Yup - they just flat out don't give a shit about new players at all...
---
Indeed. The Punisher looks like it suffers from British dentistry.
---
The greatest day in American history is and always should be tomorrow.  Getting all weepy eyed over a rose tinted version of the past is how great nations start rotting.
---
I skilled up all the prereqs for ships I wanted to fly:
---
Propulsion Jamming V  
---
Command Burst Specialist IV  
---
Signature Analysis V
---
Now training recons, dictors and booshers in my skill queue.  I'm remapped to Perception and Willpower, and wanted to use SP for skills that would take me longer: I thought about Caldari Cruiser V but I can train that in less than 3 weeks.
---
Drone Interfacing 5, Gallente Battleship 4, Gallente Drone Specialization 3 and a couple days of 4.
---
I want to eventually own all the bpo’s for producing all capitals/super-caps/titans. So far I am 0% of the way there...oh well, eventually. 
---
I chose this as my goal because I like industry as a semi-passive income stream and capitals are the biggest baddest ships in the game.
---
Too bad that Minnie background is really shit for viewing ship models.
---
I wasted it in medium hybrid turrets V

Step 1: Hire someone to come to your house and relay all the information to you in real time as you play

Do you see alliance from Legacy? it were only TEST, check your monitor twice in next time
---
Hold right there. PLEX has changed since you last played. It is now handled as a premium currency and 1x PLEX costs 4.2 MILLION at the moment (not Bil). This doesn't mean 30 Days Omega costs that much, but you require 500 new Plex for one month, leaving you at 2.2bil per month, not 4+. 
---
As the prices spiked recently, it is at the moment really hard to Plex your account with playing alone. This means it still is possible, but not practical. The best way to Plex your account at the moment is paying it with irl cash instead. (making isk with trading is still possible as well)
---
Extracted most and sold them first thing this morning before the price dropped. Injected the rest on my #2 fax pilot for Triage 5 and finished getting up to Capital Projectile 5 to fly 2nd titan on main. Be all set when it comes out of the oven.
---
Gallente cruiser V to turbocharge the gila
---
i hope there is a ragnarok skin, more non-avatar skins are needed
---
Will do this. Will update thread when I have progress
---
.
---
That abaddon, god i love that ship.
---
Used it on my current queue. I'm training all faction battlecruisers to 5 for the moment. After that the lvl5 battleships skills and after that the Trig ships to 5. 300 days to go lol
---
My alt on electronics upgrade 5 and a bunch of shield/armor skills.
---
Great idea O.P. and it would be just as productive for the devs to install spy alts into the various corporations null, hs, and ls to get a true understanding of how the game is played.
---
 Lol quality shit
---
did i say this brawl? Check my stand on the title 'By Test'.  You need to improve your reading ability.
---
Thats some pretty dank fra...
---
oh, wait
---
Destroyers are also my favorite ship size. They are a great combination of price, speed and effectiveness. Especially when you get to Command Destroyers and T3Ds.
---
She's on the list
---
Nothing bad can happen to that account after publicly announcing it.
---
That’s some pretty... unfrag
---
Thanks, I Hate it.
---
I'm having fun still. Weird and unpopular. I'm aware.
---
yeah, the sizes are accurate (except for machariel) :) I was just as surprised with Rokh

Where can I get the CAD Models?

---
i want to build a sotiyo.

I really love the way Marshall looks. It's definition of spaceship :D
---
Yes all the Preparation H as prices might go up another 25% on GW stuff (as well as other board/table top games) thanks to the tariffs.
---
all of them are of same scale :) 1000m == 100mm. The only exception is Machariel, because I used the pre-downsize scale of it
---
you and me both, heh
---
I was talking about the markup column, what does it represent ?

dunno 'bout CAD, but [there are these](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bptav1/all_flyable_battleship_hulls_3d_printed/enx8mq4/)

Thats a good suggestion.  Sadly I have sufficient ISK wallet so the SP is worth more to me than the isk.  I just don't know what to apply it to yet.  I'm sure the jump gates will align and I'll be shown the way soon.

INIT will never backstab the imperium. Where would they go? They can't trust PANFAM, and they won't trust legacy. 
---
They can't live on imperium border if they backstab them, the only thing they could do is leave the imperium, but they would still have some sort of agreement as long as they live where they live 
---
Snuff isn't large enough to make any difference
---
Test won't flip sides, there is too much history between them and PANFAM to trust them
---
New weapons would benefit goons more than anyone else, n+1 will always be king when it is on this scale, and after injectors

Ah, some one make some Star Wars Armada type rules, and I’m game for a tabletop EVE game

&gt;  Just don't put 20b of blueprints in a travel ceptor.

I laughed.  [I cried](https://zkillboard.com/kill/72808960/).
---
See story above.  It was the idiot incident.
---
there we're never enough players on serenity to actually make a huge difference, aom has 1k+ toons, they would need at least 10-15 before they could start claiming sov without some sort of agreement with the local superpower
---
 hey, i am saying the war since avdot deployed on south, against legacy and fire.  If you just want to discuss this brawl , then i am ok 'test and fire vs avdot and alts'.
---
I also have an ender 3. If you're new to the hobby and you don't think you'll like it. The ender 3 is a great machine to learn. However you will spend more time tinkering than printing. After about 3 months with it I bought a prusa mk3s kit. This is hands down the best hobby grade printer you will find. You can either get it as a kit or have it pre assembled for a bit more. Once it's setup though the thing just prints. I never have to fiddle with it more than occasionally lubing up the rods after it's seen a bit of use.
---
So if you don't mind tinkering and learning a lot then I would say by all means go for the ender 3. It's an absolutely perfect beginner machine and every part of it can be upgraded at your own pace if you so choose. If you want something that's not going to take a lot of effort though then just skip the ender and go right for a prusa. Don't be like me and sink your money into a stater machine only to want something better later.
---
They "could" deploy to legacy, a coalition almost at their own size, instead of one 3 times smaller
---
There was that too, but i'm a long way off from that.
---
Finished my Destroyers training, it was just enough to get the two missing Destroyer skills to 5, Interdictors 4 and 2 Tac Destroyer skills to 4 and 3...
---
I really hope I can get back I time to claim it. Out of town on work...
---
In space you're above the law.
---
Literally.
---
I believe that is probably correct.  I've tried to fit one myself and never had much success.
---
Perhaps implants?  Don't really know myself, just that others seem to have success with it, and it is largely considered a go-to ship for travel.
---
I've also experienced first-hand many times that they are pretty much impossible to catch.
---
99,99% of the members are definitely very casual lol
---
not really, it would take a while to get enough rescources.
---
Mining battleships would be a thing for months, but yeah, it would eventually end up like today anyways. If CCP ever does EVE 2.0 they also need to make major changes
---
Red ones go faster!
---
Get a kill with every ship that can in the game. And like, have fun.
---
I hear a great goon past time is killing other goons!
---
for me, the upgradeability is the most awesome part of the ender 3 :)
---
Thank you very much...
---
Didn't even cue the Jeopardy theme on that one.
---
Hurricane foreskin skin when?
---
Dude. Are you 12?
---
One level below the options you put: They're a meme, i.e. 'Where is Razor?'
---
why would anyone want to do that though, its not fun to shoot ate someone that already lost. no one wants your enemy to dissapear
---
This so much. These skins already look amazing on the normal ships, a rag would be a fantastic sight with this skin.
---
So the Amarr are just trying to help the Minnies clean off their ships--it all makes sense now!
---
Solo kill on a titan
---
It's gonna be a trick
---
Can't be, this movie is already 12.
---
how do they have access to internet and online banking tho?
---
Keep in mind many GSF corps (other alliances do as well) shut down recruitment during wartime. It is worth the wait, you could always try ASCEE or another GSF corp. You will still be in Goons, get all the benefits, be able to participate in small/large fleets, have the best space in the game. Where you make your friends is not only in your corp, but often in our sigs/squads where your interests lie. Of all the ones out there, they are the best organized for putting you on track to becoming not only a great pilot, but comfortable in null, being self sufficient, and having a fat wallet to boot. Good luck with wherever you land.
---
Who's asking?
---
f\*cking hell, some nice propaganda, +10
---
Being able to defend infrastructure in space is a real concern. Ted Cruz is still terrible tho.
---
VPN/Tor. Its not that hard to get around national firewalls. Chinese people are not supposed to be able to play on Tranquility and yet they do.
---
And this is why the machariel is so good at bumping.
---
Better question is whats the best type of skills to use it on?
---
Sold it
---
I would put them right above renters and just under trash if they are still alive.
---
I wonder if any of the old diehard RAZOR hangers-on look at what we've built in Delve, and wonder, "gee, if we had just stuck with those jerks, we could be in the land of milk and honey, too."
---
Good catch. Thought that number seemed inflated but I haven't logged in for a couple months!
---
Is there a way to fix that though? Somebody will always be on top even if you start over. 
---
I think there is a lot of room for new groups to make a name for themselves. Sure maybe it would be hard for a new group to take SOV and start challenging the system, but from what I hear that part of the game isn’t a ton of fun anyway right? 
---
To be honest I’m no expert on null life, so I may be completely wrong and maybe there’s nothing enjoyable or worth doing in null, but there’s so many people there there has to be something to do. I live in wormholes so I’m largely separated from the problems of supers and bots etc. My day to day fights are still a lot of fun and you can punch above your weight with a good FC.
---
Lol , I’m sorry but that’s awful. Don’t quit your day job.
---
A corp I was in got a citadel stolen. Dude placed an alt spy in our corp. I didn't take it too personal, told him I'd move on to a new show, since he basically gave that corp a mercy kill. I also jokingly offered him a spot in my corp.
---
Oh man, I hope they put that on the Vargur too.
---
they had their land of milk and honey during the old northern coalition days though
---
Well, Vuk Lau did, at any rate. :V
---
Anyone else sense a tremor in the force? As if, suddenly, a group of lawyers wrote a cease and desist letter.
---
Awww. Ickle Raven. They should give it some more maneuverability and speed. Flocks of Ravens would be fun.
---
It may be shitty interner.
---
As the other guy pointed out you're way off on the cost of a month worth of PLEX. You were hoping for a near 50% return on investment (is more like 25%). Practical means without playing EVE as a full time job or having spectacular insight. Asking here means no insight.
---
Fucking Zodiac Killer.
---
Make a cast then try to pour some copper/aluminum models?
---
Y'all having super fancy shit and I'm sitting here dunking them into the magic 14
---
Try is in quotes. Just like any alliance PH puts it's need and wants before others. They are good when stood next to goons, who aim and want to be the bad guys ruling space. It is a video game, so I am sure living that fantasy is fun, maybe as much fun as killing Goonies.
---
We shall start with doubling isk
---
Nevermind PH or Karma. Just go balls to the wall and apply to PL
---
You don't need an IP harvesting tool. Just ask for my address.
---
I wonder how much he walked away with in the end.
---
&gt; Making isk to make isk to make isk to ... do what?
---
To make ISK, duh!
---
their leader once said during WWB "If I was leading the Imperium instead of Mittani it would turn better" 
---
Yup we saw that
---
The Magic 14 is love, the magic 14 is life...
---
If a bigger group with more ISK decides they want your wormhole, they will take it no matter how good of a FC you have. If you are a smaller group you can not keep up the fight around the clock, it's that simple..
---
Numbers + ISK always equal victory and the end.
---
Dude I miss your nosprey fleets
---
Join my corp bro. We are not scary.
---
it could be done, but I have no interest in that, personally :)

When i first launched EVE several years ago, i got convo from some GM i guess (my memory isnt so good) about how i enjoy and like their game. I will never forget about it, it made a huge impact on me as newbie.
---
Good video dude. Keep em coming!
---
Yea, ther the only main empire thats purely shield based, shields are a bit higher tech than putting a brick of metal in the way of bullets
---
Yep, even by reddit standards this is a crap effort.

Yeah that was my bad..I didn't realise the plex system had changed.. I saw 4,000,000, thought it was for one old plex and my brain decided it was 4 bil because that's the only way this would make sense. 30 days of play time is actually 2.2 bil. 
---
I ended up getting one (well 500..) since I'm pretty sure I can make more than that in a month playing 1-2 hours daily. Maybe not a lot more for the first month since i'm super rusty. But i'm 99% sure I would be at least able to break even which is still a good deal.
---
So I guess i'm back to Eve. (for the better or worse)
---

Christmas's is still some months away Mr ganker

Have you checked a killboard lately?  I'm most certainly not active, even though somebody put an extra 10 months on Graths account.  The rest of my accounts all expired as expected.
---
 Also you pulled out before we invaded bud, feel free to ask progod, he just didn't like the idea of TEST living beside NCdot and PL, so the very second he found out, he said Nope, unless you're pressing on with this TWO DEAD RORQUALS IS AN INVASION bullshit.
---
Missiles that allow them to deal damage types other than thermal letting them adapt to fighting other races!
---
Christmas is still some months away Mr ganker

You mad?

But taking control of someones static then becomes so much less valuable if defenders can simply pod themselves into a system to push out invaders.

I was going to suggest casting too.  I really like your idea of a copper ship.  If you try it then post it here I'd love to see it.

then why is over half of players from 5 years ago now non existent? in an era where alts are even more common?

Youre gonna die, but with a fleet youre gonna kill some enemies before you do! And almost always isk positive, my fav ship! 100km range, also great antitackle and bomber killers.

Thrashers on the other hand are gods for gatecamps. Sensors boosters and artillery, oh baby!

Hasbro has mtg and D&amp;D.. (and nerf, Jesus I would kill for a typhoon that fires nerf darts)

Amazing in fleets tho, cheap, range, and when you hit critical mass with numbers stuff is gonna die real fast. And a good fc will gtfo before the corms get tackled.
---
Given its relative size, I'm quite impressed with the Concord battleship. The Megathron however, which I always considered to be the most iconic one, not so much. The Lashak seems to eat that thing for breakfast and won't even get out of bed for the Caldari ships.
---
I wanted a Titan after watching a Scott Manley video. I'm fairly close to one now. I know it isn't really special, and I'll be looking to build further after acquiring one, but knowing that I'm close to hitting my goal is a great feeling

You say that as if the players couldn't just join a corp in the imperium. Newsflash, not everyone plays the game to find the best crabbing spot and jerk themselves off over their internet empire lmao

Completely irrelevant information for me but it sure did sound cool. 10/10 would listen again.

Yea, I really liked messing around with it. Eventually though I was like "I'm going to end up dumping 600 bucks into this thing..." So i bought the prusa... and then continued to upgrade the ender as well anyways lol.
---
i love you
---
NC. find this?
---
Is there any backstory to that? That’s a rather strange job 😂
---
Honestly that’s why I thought it was a NPC lol, is there any reason for that or is it just a RP thing going on?
---
If you’re decent with problem solving/working with your hands (and deciphering instructions that have been Google Translated from Chinese), I’d recommend a Prusa i3 clone. My gf and I bought the Anet A8, and it works surprisingly well. $155 on Amazon.
---
Wyvern, probably.
---
Nice, now do the T2 variants.
---
This is dumb question. 
---
But did the "Stain Gate" reached CCP office in any form?

I wonder sometimes if they use this "idea" when they don't need to know what to add.

Is Windstream like Comcast, only worse?

Went away from game for two years and had auto pay on still with no training.

I still wish they'd implement a new T2 battleship hull. Gib T2 rokh

I know they probably would hunt you down if you sold them. But the irony is, they’d be spending money stopping something they could easily do and MAKE money on

Keep it cheap and cheerful. If you want to go for some gang roams, hit up the Rote Kapelle public channel. They'll take you for a spin.
---
I can see what you're doing here, but a few notes. 
---
1.) Afterburner gilas have the advantage of not having the cap reduction. Stick with the ab. The neuting waves already hurt with just an ab  and they would be even worse with am mwd. Since you have no cap booster this is important. 
---
2.) Don't try t5 with this fit. You will die. You may get a few lucky runs but this fit has a low chance of surviving. With afterburner gilas you're going to face tank some damage because the enemies will be faster than you or will be able to hit you from range. 
---
3.) Use augmented drones if you can. The dps will save you on spawns like the tyrannos Or leshak spawns. 
---
4.) If you can spare some more isk, upgrade one of the damage amps to a navy amp and add a drone link augmenter. Some spawns will try to outrun you. 
---
5.)  Don't go for all the cans. An ab Gila won't be able to do it. Not even with an mtu. 
---
6.) Have strong blue pill, strong mindflood and agency hardbshell in your hold. If you're tank is severely breaking take hardbshell first. If it's still breaking, take the blue pill. If you get a heavy neuting wave and you're cap is dying too fast, take mindflood. If you roll the shield boost penalty, take hardbshell. 
---
7) thermodynamics skill. Get it to 5. Have nanite repair paste in your hold. Also get biology to 4 or 5 and the side effect ones to 4.
---
You've apparently never worked anywhere with technical debt spanning more than a year, much less a decade. :)

I support a COBOL product that's older than me. I know all about decades of technical debt. Let me reiterate, **a senior full-stack dev with brains** and what that constitutes. That means someone who knows their way about tools and product, not someone hired on a diversity quota, or for their good marks. 
---
Remember their original POS-code guy that passed away a while ago? Proper risk mitigation would have been hiring someone to work with him and training them to know the product and the tools used. Ergo CCP is mismanaged AF, and Hilmar and all middle management between him and the devs, except maybe Seagull should've been fired en masse back when they started their diversification fail march. 
---
To go back to your comment. For some shitty half-wit mids and juniors, I agree this change would take 6 months, and results would be similar to what we observe with Eve local.
---
Already deep in the logi life - literally never flown anything else in goons.
---
Always happy to help KF
---
Very impressive. I especially liked the parts where you orbit the anchor and press F1. The music didn't add anything to your video and I had to mute it immediately, however.
---
Logistics Cruisers V.
---
You’re probably dating a minmatar
---
No deals were made. The casinos got shut down in RL so the RMT funding tap got closed. No one was then motivated to follow Goons.
---
Well done! Are these done often and in real time?
---
I wanted to fly a stealth bomber and blow people up
---
Well I wanted to pay for sub with isk.
---
I could probably do it but every time I come back the price goes up and then I got a job...
---
Created 80 new cloaky campers and injected into stealth bombers.
---
Training up to Sabres, 7 days left and an easy train for Svipuls if I want.
---
SOON™
---
who?
---
Probably ~10$? Maybe less, I don't think I've used up whole PLA spool for them (1kg spool costs 15€)
---
So, uh, done? lol
---
Why they still havent started making money out of such things instead of dubming the game down- I have no clue :P
---
Goons on Reddit the last 24 hours: Fuck we've won Eve what is going to happen there isn't anything left to shoot.  
---
Goons in this thread: Join Karmafleet, its the only choice.
---
I hate it.
---
&lt;3
---
I don't know nothing about that :) but looking ingame, the scale reflects this, that rokh is that small :)
---
I left WOW after I got bored playing the economic game there. I set a goal to only ever play Eve if I could play for free. I plexed off the old 30 day trial back when PLEX was 400M per month. Right now I have about 14 months reserves.
---
Fact: Predictions are stupid and no one cares about this anyways. 
---
Carry on /r/Eve.....
---
You've already been blacklisted bro - Bo\_Hunt's a known cunt. Just saving you some time.
---

---
To fly a rorqual.. before they were cool
---
i'm special so i got my own special way of writing
---
Mine tend to follow whatwver they were closed with so if its max on closing it will come up max when you open it.
---
Secondly you can set it to fullscreen or fullscreen window if you like. Should solve your issue.
---
So, do we have any guesses yet for what these various properties mean? I recall from last time that 'belo-cherno scale' is suggested to be luminosity, but what about the others?
---
I would assume 'thermokinesis' is (the star's?) temperature. 'Protium transition' sounds like it might be hydrogen line strength in the star's spectrum, a proxy for spectral class? 'Liminal boundary' - star's radius? Outermost planet orbit radius? 'Profound matter' - stellar mass? But what the heck are 'porevitium trace' and 'immanence'?
---
Very nice, and to scale too - reads comment.. ok except the Mach which did look a little big :) .  I'm looking forward to seeing pics of the painted versions.
---
I feel like this was a failed troll attempt yet you stated two facts.
---
Back in 2009 I joined Eve Uni. Was told to not undock as we were at war and to train 3 months of learning skills before I could do anything. Left 3 days later and went to lowsec and learned to pvp.
---
They are more or less correct to what I have observed myself comparing the aforementioned ships in station, and side-by-side in space with some. Rokh is indeed smol.
---
Ok so just a basic : if you can make a decision tree it will be easy to make a bot very fast. All solution i see in this topic are easy to describe with decision tree... in less of 1 day all bot will adapt to change.
---
 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision\_tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree) 
---
I think a lot of people ask for change of gameplay with "it will nerf bot", but the truth is they don't care of bot. They just care of change a mechanic they don't like by using the botting argument. 
---
You're post is dangerous,  you want to help bot not nerf they. 
---
Let's think of the truth of why people bot (and you will see the answer is a lot different thant you think).
---
\-People bot to make task they don't want to make (easy to understand), or task they need a lot of manpower.
---
I could for be very schematic divid bot in 2 category: ISK/loot bot, and utilitary bot.
---
For ISK bot you have an unique root:
---
\-Economy of the game.
---
Just think people buy ISK on a RMT service who use bot , beacause they want to buy simething in game. PVP player (elit pvpv of the north with 16% botter...) use bot beacause they want PVP and not PVE/mining.
---
So if you want make solution maybe the first thing to check is economic model of eve, and nerf income will just favorise BOT: i need X Billlions ISK, before nerf it take me 20 hours, after nerf 30 hours. More People will buy isk on rmt site or bot (this post want that). I don't have a solution to change that (i have some idea, but they are "brut" idea, and if i post they it will be same as make a shitpost of Jintann quality).
---
For utilibot you have multiple root:
---
\-Need a lot of manpower to be one man fleet( i know some true player who realy one man fleet).
---
\-Need manpower to make intel.
---
\-Need to check X or Y or Z somewere and you don't want make it.
---
Answer to utility bot will be more harder, and if you want a fun thing, remove local will increase the manpower for intel needed and make people use more bot, yes easy way for exemple is to reduce the manpower needed for intel.
---
For the one man fleet thing, it's hard to change, unless you have a ship with a shitons of command who make it's hard to control 20 in same time, and make this ship enought powerfull to fight against a little fleet. Ho wait someone said to me it's call a carrier/supercarrier, HO WAIT NERF THEY ENCOURAGE BOTTING....
---
Conclusion:
---
You want nerf bot ? We go in the wrong way.
---
Jintann don't want to nerf bot he wants to help bot, and change a game mechanic for his convenance and use bot as an argument. Maybe CCP need to look Jintann and friend move... smelt like bot using somewhere...
---
You can paint all if those in one afternoon with an airbrush mate. They look great. I wouldn't mind painting them myself.
---
Or even a survey with a suggestion box. Would be  entertaining to read what non reddit eve players think about the game.
---
 "Who even are you?"
---
Finished Titan V on a couple toons, just let my mains skill queue just take the SP anchoring V and precursor battlecruiser v I think
---
yikes
---
We don't do that any more, thank goodness &lt;3
---
You're confusing ISK making with mass recruiting.
---
Don't underestimate the desire for folks to have their own name, even if they have to be a wholly subservient group. Pandemic Legion, for example, has operated under this principle for years now.
---
That’s not the best vision on him from u
---
What would you know? It's not like you're in charge or something...
---
No troll. Those statements appear contradictory, but the first statement is just a public facing one that Goons make. If you stay in Goons for more than a year or so as a newbro, you're basically someone who wants null ticks with Highsec security. Most Goons would shit themselves at the thought of dropping their super on anything that wasn't a rorq cyno in Delve, or a keepstar grid with TAPI blued.
---
I am not sure if I am a minority in this be the duet was kind of terrible. The vocals doesn't match well to me. Shoulf had just the woman sing or find a different male singer.
---
At like 2 weeks old me and a couple friends moved into a Wormhole. We set the goal to move our corp into C5 space and use capitals. 
---
Achieved it after like a year or two until we got evicted and took a break from the game.
---
I think it's just the ships it's next to making it look smaller than it is. If you compare it to the Redeemee and Typhoon prints, it's actually pretty similar (possibly bigger than the phoon).
---
Could you do it in the style of the shipping forecast
---

Everybody has been harping on them for years and years to do things like this, but their thick Icelandic skulls just won't let the idea penetrate.
---
You could contract a corridor service, like red frog or advertise in the haulers Chanel. If the rewards are fair you’ll usually get a taker pretty fast. Once it’s in jita you just sell it all.
---
I used it for fitting skills can't wait to make dumbass wacky fits.
---
If he didnt drop connection to the game itself and/or external comms I'm gonna say it's most likely the shitty chat system.
---
Issue a temporary contract for all the stuff to your alt, or to the public at a ridiculous price that they won't accept. CTRL-A CTRL-C the contract contents. CTRL-V into a text editor. Delete the contract. Go back to the text editor and delete everything that's a rig (since fitted rigs can't be reused). Then copy/paste it into https://evepraisal.com/ to get the Jita value of the entire pile. Take the Jita **buy** value, which is the actual value of the stuff you would get if you hauled it to Jita, then subtract 30%, then reissue the contract for all the stuff for that amount with a 4-week expiry. Your buyer will find it without assistance.
---
A lot of words that didn't really give much idea about what is coming.
---
Fuck yeah. Can never have too many marauder skins.

Lmao

Ok don draper

 What? You got blinking LEDs? Sweet ride!

I do it specifically to trigger people like you.  It is a game I play, thanks for playing.

---
I spent time in both corps, and I preferred Karmafleet even though I had to wait like a week to get in.
---
I see you chose the pre remodel phoon.
---
yup
---
To scan every scannable moon in game, starting in null, at least count I was at about ~32,000 scanned.
---
Get people to say "Oh shit, its :insert group name here:" still a work in progress. :)
---
It's a tribute to Lucy
---
Remember when NC killed those two MoA faction forts during the last war in order to deny The Imperium the killmails?
---
Imagine caring so much about killboards that you kill allied structures or LOL your own POSes to “deny” them to the enemy. What’s wrong guys? Could you not get your logistics guys to stop evacuating stuff in jump freighters long enough to unanchor these POSes?
---
Running T4 sites in a sub 500mil ship I would say challenging, but not impossible
---
For T5? Well, you definitely need at least 1b of investment to earn the payoff
---
Killboard green, lads.
---
The points system is by no means any more accurate than isk destroyed. Like i could go around on my main and have my alt follow me in a scimi/onieros/RR T3 and be 2v1 in every "solo" kill. Isk destroyed and points are both meaningless other than for personal feel good and self critizism. Using it as a personal metric is totally valid, but glacing at someones killboard only tells like 10% of the story
---
They are also really forgiving for new players (and vets alike!) to control. Compared to all other ships classes they generally have better firepower, tracking, and agility for the isk cost and the skill points required.
---
Eve is special BECAUSE it exists as a single instance, in which a player has to confront or otherwise deal with others playing the same sandbox.  The work and time put into the game have much more value when all the fruits of that labor are destructible, and having multiple instances where one can simply teleport to in order to avoid players outright undermines that concept.  The last thing we need in EVE is more artificially created safe spaces.
---
can confirm with covops 5 that i am closer to beating merk on tower kills
---
I have an ender 3 do yourself a favor and watch the various YouTube videos on how to assemble it. Some are very good and show you what adjustments to do now vs later. For bed leveling do opposite side corners front left then rear right etc
---
Wish they could write a piece of code that would perform an action whenever a character enters system.
---
Omg, link please!
---
Oooof, that's tough.  You gotta go with the abyssal oracle to be sure
---
Right?  I'm sure you've seen how much those damn X-wing miniatures cost for the tabletop game.  But the company that dislocates it's arm patting itself on the back for having risen from being a board game company can't figure out how to come up with a handful of rules and have the game manufactured in their newly beloved China.
---
Whats a guild?
---
1 pos mod = 1 csm vote for killah
---
I need to bite the bullet and finish torpedo spec V, get the bling implants, and pyrolancea db9. maybe some abyssal BCU's to boot. it's getting fucking ridiculous.
---
A VPN will not help at all when you have a paper trail. Or when you transfer money for that matter. Or when you have a tracking number given to you from the post office.
---
My god you shot some small structures!
---
What next, an actual moving target?
---
Fit plz?
---
Ate the ships balancing on the stands or did you super glue them on? That would be pretty incredible if they were balanced.
---
have you seen Fire in action? This is even odds for them
---
no
---
We have not won eve, eve is a game without a win condition.
---
Also KarmaFleet is not the only option, but it's a good one. Plenty of options out there for people to try different things and see what fits them best.
---
Like, what the fuck?
---
What up my Niglavians!
---
I'm sure packing up all that isn't bolted down and not contesting every time something like happens is exactly the kind of gameplay their members enjoy, and that's why they choose to live in Sov Null

Holding onto it. Itll prob go to subsystem losses
---
I wasn't about to either, but some enthusiastic corpies cleverly exploited my helpfulness :/  
---
I wasn't convinced this was anything more intricate than a bit of fluff/lore but I've seen a few forum posts where people are making tremendous efforts to pinpoint something and seem to be enjoying it, so it's worthwhile if it helps.
---
Goon circle jerk over killing pos mods in 2019, nice very cool and exciting
---
Yeah there's a direct 1:1 mapping between all alphanumeric characters and some punctuation (which may have been introduced in this new batch of material, I don't know, I haven't bothered decyphering Triglavian before now).  
---
Protip: Any crypto enthusiast will tell you, if you see two rows of symbols each with 26 individual characters on it, then it's probably that easy :D
---
Fun op, final blows all got 500plex and a Fedo.
---
tbh POSes and carbon have pretty much the same value...
---
This guy gets it.
---
This guy gets it /s
---
This is so cool. Why CCP doesn't offer this stuff is beyond me.
---
It definitely has nothing to do with the unanchoring citadels.
---
I don't even fucking know at this point.
