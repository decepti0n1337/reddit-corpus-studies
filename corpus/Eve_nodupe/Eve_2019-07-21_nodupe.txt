Why did you ignore the warnings that the invaded systems are extremely dangerous?
---
By being faster than a fat bot
---
Give me all your stuff and I'll double it.
---
they misread it as summer of hate, and turned off local
---
tbh as a hunter I would rather fight a subcap response fleet than kill your krabs. If the response wasn't cancer, I wouldn't bring cloaky evasive cancer.
---
Do you think i wasnt aware of that?  Im confused by this statement.  I am saying that to reasonably survive high sec runs i am forced to subscribe and not play.  The alternative is untennable and will inevitably end up in me losing all ships and isk.  Granted it is possible to get lucky each time.  Likely in the short term even.  I dont like gambling, and while i do take risks, and am responsible for recouping loss, a core mechanic of the game is forcing me and i fear other casuals to not play for periods of time (which shouldnt happen) or pay to skill up to where you can afford a big enough ship to survive doing so.  And at hundreds of millions per lost ship; not being able to even make 10 mil per hour means i would have to devote all of my free time.  A thing that would make me not a casual player.  Thus i feel like my style of play has been cut off from the game.
---
Two drops from June with local, two from July w/o.
---
Okay, so the main problem for you is the way you look at ships in eve. Believe me, we've all been in similar situations when we lost expensive ships. But for me, one sentence of a player changed my way of thinking at the beginning of playing - "ships are ammo, you are the weapon". That made me realize that loosing ships, even expensive ones are annoying but it doesn't annoy me so much that it makes me wanna quit. Even from the start I wasn't afraid of just going where I want no matter if I die. You lost your ship, so what? It's freakin space pixels. Also, you got into the mindset that highsec means safety which it doesn't. You have 7mil skill points so you can't say that you're completely new. Maybe eve just isn't for you. You're not the only one who looses expensive ships in stupid situations, but they just shrug it off and still play because at the end of the day you're trying to have fun. If eve is not fun then you really need to find something else.
---
no
---
&gt;  kick in the teeth to every playstyle except sov null.
---
yeah but I'm saying there is a way to do it without kicking everyone in the teeth. I moon mine in alts in NPC null. I don't miss the days of all moons belonging to a small number of pilots in PL, The original NC, goons, etc.
---
The problem is the Rorq, not moon mining. Make it less pricey and make it easier to kill.
---
not sure but its visible now
---
I commend your positive attitude about it all.
---
Can’t be that new a player if he’s figured out that ruse.
---
do not do it bad bot!
---
ah very nice I asked the mods to make it visible there was a button to contact them maybe they already reacted :)
---
No ive just learned from all those runescape scams and rust lol
---
Write somthing better shithead
---
If you are interested enough and have a thicc coat you will eventually figure out everything yourself, it's still just a game at the end of day
---
https://www.thealphasguide.com/
---
Most of it is still relevant. SOmeone else will probably come along with a massively comprehensive copy paste
---
&gt; If im not mistaken MER is always regional which means that spreading them out over different regions (which they prob would do anyways because of safety) could make the rise too low to be interpreted as significant
---
Because nullsec doesn't have multiple regions? :thinking:
---
This. They don't want to play with you, so they try to block/slow/annoy you with bubblefucked gates. If you want to get at them, then you deal with the bubbles one way or the other. If you don't want to counter their move, fine... but you better not expect to be able to get at them.
---
This sort of back and forth happens all over Eve. Cloaky? Kitey? Tanky? Docked up? Blob? These are all methods to avoid losing at PVP. If you bitch about them, it's generally because you want what you want but can't understand that others feel the same way and that the game is generally balanced when there are plays and counterplays... even if you don't love any given counterplay.
---
Alright.
---
Welcome to EvE. You’re gonna be fine :)
---
Yes, you're right.  I was joking.  Wormholers are always telling us nullsecers what our space needs.  I thought I'd return the compliment.
---
That may apply to you but that's not the reality for most hunters. I fucking miss the days where soloing a BC looking for a fight and being hunted by shit I can see. Many people who PVP want the quick gank and tears and avoid risk almost as much as a crab.
---
"I don't understand = I will give you a downvote."
---
16 letter/spacing correction for a sum total of 75 million isk, payable to Navi Unchosen, ingame.
---
If you're ever showing a newbie the B-R monument, you can technically say "I lost a titan here"
---
For what it's worth, as a Legacy dude that lost a dread today, I loved the content. Thanks for adding to my pile of Eve memories, OP!
---
That's awesome.
---
Rorquals were rare because you only needed one of them to boost a system. It was when they were turned into infinitely scalable mining apex ships were they mass produced.
---
I'll take 'ignoring the point that was just made' for 500, Alex.
---
always welcome to share that moment with you guys, thanks alot for coming! If we didnt kill their dreads it would feel alot worse! :)
---
Mine is arranged on the keyboard the same way it shows up on the screen, so 1234 is high slots, QWER is mids and ASDF is lows. Shift+hotkey or shift+click is overload, and the rest is mostly details. Oh and remap d-scan to space.
---
Ugh. If you wanna measure a change then you want the number to be significant. If the number is spread out across different sections and the initial number and the number of the change isnt large enough then you cant really do that. Not with our dataset.
---
Dude, come on.
---
Downvote the bot! Stop it!
---
Also: did it fail at removing it or what?
---
From what I've heard, they had a public Sotiyo in M-O or M2O, which is PanFam space, and anyone could produce supercaps there. Goons got tired of it so they're taking them all down now.
---
I've seen more.
---
When my post got blocked there was the opportunity to contact the mods about it. I used it to ask them to make it visisble as I felt first hand experience has always been valuable for this subreddit :) Seems like they reacted quite fast and made it visible! :)
---
Gotta say though, hearing the words "faxes get reps on that titan" as I loaded grid to see a bunch of titan wrecks was... interesting. It took me a few moments to realize exactly what grid we were on!
---
Saying something is perfect when it never was is lying. Lying says his arguments are wrong. Was there intel due to no local, yes. Was it perfect, fk no. You still had to d-scan, check zkillboard and so on. Nobody is gonna say that dotlan is perfect intel either because its got a delay. If they do, check them.
---
Thanks! If I learn how to properly paint plastic, I will post it again.
---
It's not impossible. You came out of warp, they took one second to lock you and 1 second to activate modules.
---
I'm guessing you were warping to a station and landed outside of docking range.
---
Your argument is flawed in that you're complaining that highsec is too dangerous but it doesn't really take much effort to be safe and not be a target.
---
Starting eve is hard. I gave up the first time. What brought me back was finding a good Corp with people I could play with.
---
Run a few of the starter missions, they’ll teach you the basics. When you’ve got a few mil and some ships you can toss around head to low / null sec.
---
Most new bros burn out pretty quickly running missions in highsec. 
---
I’d suggest finding a small Corp (the larger ones kinda suck :p though that can be debated) through PvP or whatever you want to do. Go get yourself killed in lowsec, ask the guy who killed you what you did wrong, and see if maybe they’ll take you into their Corp. 
---
If you feel bored/get tired of your current activity don’t feel afraid to try something else! Don’t let burnout get to you!
---
If you’re new, splurging $5 on plex so you can get going isn’t that bad of an idea. Just make sure you get at least 400 Mil (ish) for it.
---
Ah, nice. Stupid auto-bots :p
---
&gt;The reason everyone currently uses caps is because they are too good at too many things. They shouldn't be able to track anything below a battleship
---
Why not go even further, delete grams, all other light fighters, and make it so fighters can't track other fighters, only the carriers they're launched from. Or let's not. A situation where subcaps can just number up and shred a capital, whereas the capital literally can't track any of them unless they're in battleships is preposterous. Especially in the case of a carrier, that's supposed to be versatile, and the most well equipped of all caps to fight smaller targets (Doomsdays aside). 
---
I'm fine with Titans/dreads, hell maybe even supers not being able to track frigs well (maybe limit supers to heavy fighters only) but since a lone frig can stop a carrier from warping, you want to make it so the carrier literally cannot apply any damage to that frigate?? I genuinely don't understand this school of thought, am I to fly a cruiser alt with my carrier all the time just so I can take on someone in an ibis etc who wants to troll me? Must I equip a rack of neuts and ECM modules instead of FSU's and shields and hope he can't point from range? Must I multibox my own fleet or not own a capital? 
---
Capitals are supposed to be powerful. Nerfing them to the point where four distinct classes of ship are incapable of defending themselves from a couple of cruisers/frigs is madness. They're Endgame ships. They should feel like it. 
---
To address other concerns:
---
&gt; But everyone has a titan or 637838 Rorqs now
---
No they don't.  I only got my carrier a few months ago, after skilling for quite some time. Not everyone spends 1k to skill into a cap. It'll certainly be several years before I have a titan. I don't have a rorq yet either, considered getting one to see what all the fuss was about, but I'm in no rush. 
---
Most players don't own 10^3 caps. 
---
&gt;They're too hard to kill
---
Anti- capital battleships etc should exist (think stuff like the leshak and it's insane spooled up DPS), but making capitals useless is not the answer.
---
&gt;They make too much money
---
If I've spent months/years training up my carrier skills, of course I should be able to use it to make money. Carrier ratting is not an AFK activity. It's High APM. Some of us like to rat towards our sub/income, and don't/can't just pay for Plex with cash all the time to fund out gameplay. Why are people so insistent on this not being an option? 
---
Rorq income isn't a problem. It's the ease they can be multiboxed. Carrier income isn't a problem full stop. 
---
&gt;Muh bots
---
CCP should invest in a form of anti-cheat. That'll be more effective at removing bots than nerfing everything above a cruiser to the ground, deleting local, d-scan and the in game map, and making it so you have a 50% chance of instant death if you move your cursor over the undock button.
---
What’s a plex?
---
&gt; Eve will continue to hemorrhage not only players but entire alliances like Skill Urself who realize there's just no way to bridge the gap.
---
Plenty of ways, they chose to do none, over and over, the leaders quit and the rest folded into other alliances. 
---
You could and still can make change happen in game, you just don't have the stomach for it.
---
It would be nice to always logout n a win.
---
Not if the noctis pilot has half a brain/is properlyt tanked. I can't check right now, but a hull tank noctis should be at 30-40k ehp, you will not be able to break that with a few unbonused rlmls (as you need the covert subsystem). And as soon as you hit reload you are deep up shits creek.
---
To be fair, null is way more important to game health and WAY easier to understand and have opinions on. I lived in wh for about 6 months total I still barely understand it. Makes sense for spoopy dwellers to chime in on null sometimes.
---
Fucking shitty move bot
---
while i like instanced PVP in MMO's general, i would say they are bad for Eve Online. Thing is instanced PVP even in RVR games like Daoc, Warhammer Online, Guild wars 2 etc. is fun and appealing. In a sandbox like Eve where everything goes and people can build their own structures it would kill the whole roaming aspect and small scale PVP, and even destroy FW more than its already killed due to different factors. 
---
What could work and there iam with you is a tourney system where your 5man group can apply to which is held every 3month. The layout and fight order for the system should be like Dota 2 Battlecup, you risk the isk of your ship whats killed is gone like in rest of eve. And their could be even a tier bracket, once you hit the highest bracket and win they could a be a special tourney or something similiar to alliance tourney.
---
Dude, if hes using missiles then? And got webs? If its a PvP ship? Cause I have killed more than enough frigs with drones and rapid heavies. And Ive seen players kill far more than that in BS. So no. This is still not a discussion about fits.
---
And still, you can and should always defang a carrier. Thats the only weapons he has. If youre not doing that then youre doing something wrong and shouldnt blame the carrier. You should instead learn to fight it the right way. Ive killed carriers in small groups so what you are saying is bullshit dude.
---
Im being sarcastic dude. I was one of them.
---
Imagine being this incredibly lame
---
And neither is going away.
---
&gt; I am saying that to reasonably survive high sec runs i am forced to subscribe and not play.
---
It's absolutely possible... trivial, even... to survive in high sec as an alpha.  My alpha clones have had no problem with invasions.
---
I'm also going to tell you that, in my estimation, you would likely still have died as an Omega.
---
Trax Vanno has given me permission to claim his reward for him. 
---
May I know what it is before I accept?
---
:P
---
Oh I didnt know it worked for incursions as well. I guess everything can be botted.
---
oh I see! Didnt even think about that :D
---
Makes sense. Kinda scary that theyve infected everything.
---
Prove me wrong with hard data. Until then, you are incorrect, using anecdotal evidence to try and prove a point.
---
He wasn't tanked. He was wet tissue paper
---
Why not ask this here... Has anyone else had an issue with "today's" Cerebral Accelerator? I used it and my attributes each went up by ten as expected. I looked at my points-per-minute for the current skill, and they went up by 15 as was expected. However, the time to completion reported as if I was at "normal" attribute levels, and looking at the actual skill point increase per minute, the skill increas did not have the extra 15 points.
---
Just me, or am I missing something on how they work/report?
---
You don't have to imagine
---
thx man gotta keep the head up and make the best out of it, right? :)
---
I would buy it off u depending on how much it is. And what the skills are for him/her
---
The game has a i game menu called agency. It will help guid you.
---
Ok...
---
Plex is bought with real money but can be traded in game. 
---
It can be used to buy Omega time (omega allows for more ships and stuff). Buy skins, skill extractors (lets you change your skills), etc.
---
So the way plex works is people will buy it with IRL money, and sell it for in game money. People who want isk and can spend IRL money sell it, people who want plex but don’t want to buy it with IRL money buy it with isk.
---
Plex: premium currency (Can be bought for cash or isk)
---
Isk: lower in game currency (can be bought with plex, can buy plex)
---
Im also shocked. People dont wanna lose more isk than they make with PvE? Such brutes!
---
Excellent write up, Its Space Pixels at the end of the day, as long as you enjoyed the fight and learned from it, that is all that matters. Upvoted for positivity.
---
Wait so I could collect all my alpha sp then get all the omega sp?
---
I’m not.  You just can’t stand to be wrong
---
Mee! I'm a new player and I need isk please :D
---
Wrong? How am I wrong? You've posted nothing of any evidence to show you have a clue. I'm ok with being wrong, but I have evidence that shows you are wrong. Show me I'm wrong and I'll be fine with that.

&gt; blackout Is BAD for smaller groups, the blackout is BAD for newer players
---
It's bad for smaller groups who don't want to make an effort and who want a no-risk game. It's bad-ASS for people who are willing to take a risk and can put a little effort into knowing what's around them.
---
Do it CCP
---
That is the first really constructive post ive really read.  Thank you for that.  Losing ships hurts, but it is not game breaking for me.  I use ships as goals.  However, i do not see a viable path to those goals at present.   I tried mining, it is boring, and requires risky space.  Missions then.  Mining missions are boring and lead to invasion space for extended periods, so no.   So that leaves distro, or ratting but ratting for decent money takes money and skills i do not currently have.  So distro it is.  Though i come to find distro leads to invasion space the most, and the surround gates.  Impossible.  I could work other factions up, but again the time sinc is brutal.  9 hours a week is most of my free time, i have a wife and kids, and am involved.  What i am saying is that maybe eve isnt right for me.  It used to be.  I dont know if other eve players are in my shoes, but i think invasion is pushing me out mechanically.  Maybe it is just me.  I hope so.
---
1 hour 6 sec. Fucking idiot. OK, I'll listen to it all and see.
---
Is drones even worth training since the nerfs to interface 4?

Nah, I've just always wanted to say something about that. The amount of people that can't help but to make some lewd reference when naming their corp is quite sad, especially for a community that tries to boast what a high intelligence level its community has.
---
They usually mine/rat on the side or do occasional bursts of ultrakrabbing, a few plex.
---
They did it because they got tired of having supers gate into their cyno jammed pocket. Turns out, they will build a wall if given enough incentive.
---
Douche bag.
---
Oh, you are one of those. Can dish it out but not take it. Weak ass wanker. Can go take your own advice there dickhead.
---
Well, one thing I could suggest is just join a big nullsec block and rat away till your hearts content. Highsec is just not good isk in most cases. Also why not try exploration in null and wh's? It's not boring because you have to be alert all times plus you learn how to travel through space as safely as possible.
---
Not in the way I expected. I got the extra queue but not a multiple character cert, which I'd hoped to hold for a rainy day.
---
Begging people to log on for rage pings just to anchor on marshy and press F1 but totally not at all like the big blue fleets.   Like not at all you guys.  BB is different you guys.
---
Woah there’s a narrative here they’re trying to pass along as fact.  Get the fuck right out with your questions and shit
---
A titan drop in pursuit of content leads to dank frags and some lessons learned. I'm glad you at least had some fun, and I aspire to have your attitude when I get a titan one day!
---
Thinking about it from a real life perspective (yes, I know it's not the same) capital ships, say an aircraft carrier, do not operate solo. They require a fleet, they require support from smaller vessels such as a destroyer screen, anti-sub vessels and the like. 
---
Capitals should have weaknesses that a well rounded fleet should account and makeup for.
---
no they will gave you  cockroach bpo
---
&gt; On a related note: If I put like a billion bounty on him/her, will they actually get killed?
---
Waste of money. The bounty system has been broken forever.
---
huh
---
it's the language of poverty
---
it doesn't matter, if you see zero you can do whatever with impunity
---
A few things:
---
-Distro missions aren't good for much of anything.  I forgot they even exist.
---
-Invasions are in a limited area at any given time.  Mission objectives are generally within a fairly set radius of the mission giver.  Consequently, it's possible to just find a mission agent who will never send you into an invasion area.
---
-You can see where the invasions are with a map filter.  If you go run missions in, e.g., Lonetrek or The Citadel right now, you're not likely to end up in invasion space.
---
-Invasion systems show up as triangles on a plotted route.
---
-Only use autopilot if you're comfortable with dying.
---
I know that system. That hot mess of bubbles protected an isolated constellation for a group of Russians. They were good guys. Smeared a lot of pilots against those bubbles =)
---
but those aren't what i said
---
With it's low pricing for a year it's a great bargain!
---
unless you're a big tiddy newbie eve streamer collecting 8b a second in "donations" and nonstop talking

the amount of cloaky t3c traffic they get coming into that system from that gate all dem cans and drones ez decloaks
---
t. Megatron
---
more like fuck people who use t3 in hs
---
do you know what a perspective argument is?
---
In the former I'm explaining to you that bumping in and of itself does nothing, in the latter i'm explaining that you have the ability to stop bumping with very easy simple fitting or ship decisions, and even then it's such a niche activity bumping is super rare.
---
I'm arguing from your perspective, because you're incapable of seeing anything from any other perspective.
---
There is absolutely no way a 500m loki could clear top tier c3 sites (ie. forgotten recursive etc.) without being alpha'd unless warping in/out using range, basically taking an hour instead of 20 minutes. 
---
Really no cruiser is easy, even with +80 resists and 3 second shield cycles, getting cut into armor.
---
Ahh your just looking for flaws in an argument.  I see.  Well, no argument is perfect, and being accused of having a flawed argument is not an insult.  Troll better.
---
Its not 100-150m anymore. Its closer to 80-100m now.
---
Because it is a lazy plot device in fiction? It is a lazy device in game? When I found out about them in game I was horrified. This futuristic society with space ships and clones transferring consciousness technology with massive militarys not only has not discovered a way to detect a cloaked ship but has not even developed countermeasures. Lazy writing, lazy development, and cowards to take advantage.
---
Cloaks Online. It's fun!
---
Good fight from the bait dread &lt;3
---
post pod loss
---
I go wandering occasionally, I like space, it's chill. Decided to see if auto pilot could get from delve to jita and recorded it. Didn't see anyone else in space until lowsec, rats on a few gates that were pretty pathetic, did minimal damage or none at all.
---
Shipped into something more baity in Jita and was immediately ganked on the perimeter gate by Pirat. Gave them some money for doing something even though they are sub-human trash. Good job Pirats.
---
Pretty bad.
---
Since there was no alternative. This was CCPs plan, not some evil scheme hatched by NS. We just did what we had too since everyone else was doing it. If we hadnt, we could have been overrun by other groups who did.
---
And I can tell you this, I really dont think a lot of people would mind if this arms race were to end, its quite taxing.
---
You realize that what you're complaining about is how a sandbox is actually supposed to work, right?
---
Your complaint essentially boils down to "if they go to extraordinary lengths to set up the proper infrastructure and react appropriately, people can play the game the way they want without being plagued by the random killmail-farming idiots that prohibit most non-pvp activities in EVE".
---
If anything, it should be EASIER to farm in relative peace without having your gameplay experience ruined by random tards cruising around and hoping to luck their way into a free killmail from someone who is playing the game in a non-CCP approved way (meaning any method of gameplay that doesn't involve forcing others into one-sided fights).
---
The correct course of action would be to offer smaller groups and individuals better protection against killmail farmers, so that they can feasibly operate without needing a massive super umbrella to avoid being farmed into oblivion. I call this course of action "correct" because it allows would allow EVE to appeal to a larger number of potential players, whereas reducing players' abilities to avoid unwanted, one-sided pvp would only drive even more people from the game.
---
If you want more pvp action, then suggest and support ideas that promote balanced and consentual pvp - this kind of action creates fun for all involved, without driving people away from the game (battlegrounds, anyone?). If you simply want it to be easier to pad your own killboard stats and don't care about other players' enjoyment or the future of the game, gtfo - you are a parasite that CCP should have squashed long ago, instead of catering to.
---
Imbalanced and non-consentual pvp definitely have their places, especially in EVE, but they're currently choking virtually any other means of playing the game and forcing players into giant blue blobs in order to mitigate them. Super umbrellas are a symptom, not the problem, and if you "fix" them you only make the underlying problem worse.
---
she puts out, but only for C02 guys.
---
he was a saint, please donate him more isk so he can continue playing again :))
---
Pretty much.
---
Back when I was in scalding pass COW had their pocket bubbled like that.  They called it "looneybubble".
---
ok
---
When classss designed to kill other classes cannot accomplish the task, there's a problem.
---
After reading that im not surprised you died.
---
Also drops carrier on subs, then complains about 1 dread dropped on carrier.
---
The fuck?
---
GG though least you are creating content, always support that.
---
"Highest amount of rewards bar none in the entire game". This is a lie any way you dress it.
---
should apply for a "baited a titan" medal from your corp I did get one back in my days when i freshly moved into a nullsec corporation and was able to bait a blackops. It's a nice memory whenever I see it!
---
Welcome, newbro. o7
---
You don't have to use a bonused ship to have good usage of damps or td's in any fleet. You DO have to use a bonused hull if you want to use ECM though. When tho hulls that do get bonuses for ECM also happen to be almost all universally trash, it's fairly sad.
---
You kinda missed putting in the nerfs afterwards but sure.
---
I always thought regular cynos should have a spool up time and covert ops cynos would light instantly.
---
I do wh space when im feeling like a challenge.  Today i wanted to destress, and eve often had done that for me.  High sec mining and distro.   Also you should look in to distro 4's.  They arent bad for cash when you consider lp.
---
Question, since when is a single Dread out escalating?
---
They could fix that by making rorquals use fighter mechanics instead.
---
Or you know, just JC or DC places?
---
But Im not arguing against the JBs, im still shocked that there is no fatigue. And they can even move caps. Its way too much. But so is no local. Seems the only changes that are being made are extreme.
---
What happens at MY-W1V stays at MY-W1V.
---
&gt; When goons were reported in small stuff I took an active tanked nid to try to test its tank and maybe snack a kill or two
---
&gt;After I tanked for a while goons dropped 1 Dread on the carrier and it started to break. I felt kinda pissed about it as I expected them to be here for a brawl and we were forming to give them one. With the carrier dead they would move on and no one would get a good fight out of it. I kinda felt betrayed of the content I had been searching
---
&gt; The subcaps left grid and there was just the single dread left on grid. I wanted to Yolo the titan in out of principle as I felt they escalated on my carrier to an uneven level and I wanted to do the same to him.
---
so you felt betrayed that goons dropped a cap on the cap you dropped on their subcaps in the first place (and that could tank them)? and dropping a dread in a carrier is escalating to an "uneven" level? that's... interesting.
---
also did you ever think of like, asking their fc for an honor brawl if that's what you're looking for? if you're gonna get buttmad he doesn't want to wait for you to form like an honorable space bushido follower at least make him aware of it? 
---
&gt;  So I dropped and fired my DD knowing it was a risk but not expecting such a fast dreadbomb.
---
you were in a cap trading blows since the start, and they had dropped a dread already on you, and they're in range of npc null. that was not a fast dreadbomb mate, hell its debatable if it was even a dreadbomb(16 dreads lol). Seriously did you think they just happened to have a guy in fleet that just happened to have a dread sitting in curse? How is this not a gigantic red flag for you and the wranglers
---
i guess that's the level of titan pilots we have in general today v0v
---
I tried to avoid it, but where my limited faction 3s are currently exist in or around invasion space.  I could go grind 1s and 2s elsewhere i guess, though ive lived in the area for years.  Maybe try lowsec hubs for my l3s but again i was after low stress playing.  Something i had before but seems lost.
---
technically I didnt drop but gated and warped the carrier in :P I dont complain about the dread from the point of view like "oh man you are not allowed to drop a dread on a carrier" I was just planning to keep them busy longer and turn it into a nice subcap brawl and a dread didnt fit into that plan. If you can think of a subcap ship that could tank a 20+ fleet for a while to form stuff let me know I am always interested in exploring new options! Maybe a marauder? But I always felt like they are pretty much as expensive and with carriers roaming people are used to see them around because ratting ones.
---
Maybe the expiration date should be proportional to the number of adjacent bubbles within 100km? So 2-3 bubbles and they expire in 6ish days. 100 bubbles and you only get them for a few hours.
---
You're drinking that "nullsec should be dangerous" too much. It's already dangerous, players who live there make it safe. Flying a freighter is dangerous, having escort make it safe. Flying in enemy territory is dangerous, doing it in a cloaky nullified tengu makes it safe. You take you own safetuis, you don't bring something you can't escape with to an enemy territory, can I call you coward for doing that? Just remove citadels from the game, and poses also. Better, you can'd dock. Oh no, better, your ship explodes as soon as you enter nullsec. That a better idea, that's dangerous. That's how you sound.
---
it out escalated my carriers tanking possibilites for sure :P But I get your general point ;)
---
this is factually untrue, eve is literally the definition of a free-to-play game with subscription
---
Ohh dont take me wrong. Im a big supporter of someone creating content, and no issue with dropping a carrier.
---
Just the bit about the dread triggers me, but not so much that i actually care.
---
I hope you get another titan and yolo it again.
---
Otherwise whats the point, right?
---
&gt; This seems like an unpopular opinion here but, this is their space and it’s a sand box.
---
its not an unpopular opinion, and OP never said the ability to do that should be restricting or removed.
---
its the best way to get nervous and excited for sure. You really feel like something is on the line and not like "oh yeah I lost that ship let me mine another half an hour to get it back". Just make sure you say goodbye before you jump and you should be fine! :)
---
Well, what do you expect? You're part of the largest entity in the game that's blue to everyone. I also don't get shot when I fly around the area my corp/alliance holds.
---
You forgot about how I booshed your Leshak and bhaal off your apostle *wink*
---
But yeah, amazing write up.  I've had so much fun in fleets fighting over this astra. Thx for bashing. Thx for your determination. I'm glad you finally got it =)
---
(rp) Amarr slaver scum! Rot in hell!
---
nah I think I am one of the lesser aware titan pilots probably most Legacy Titans wouldnt have risked it and spotted the trap! :) The honor brawl might be a good option, never done it before or never done to me before though. Is it like a thing? Probably people would expect to be fucked over?   
---
I am aware of NPC Null but I frankly didnt expect goons to be that fast, now that I think about it calmly it makes total sense!
---
you bet your ass! The day I stop risking shit is probably less than a month before the day I stop logging in!
---
Hm.... I dunno about that one chief. Ask any of the many people on /r/eve and they'll agree with me.

Is your comment implying that I don't know how to pulse a prop-mod?

If so, then it'd be a fair call to make as I didn't mention it at all. I made an assumption that a person not knowing how to evade bumps *also* wouldn't know how to pulse.
---
This was a lot of questionable decisions made at every step here. Yet I still respect you for it. Most people would be super salty, come up with a ton of excuses, blame everyone, ect. Good on you for yoloing it and owning your mistakes, we all make them.
---
You are a shithead for dropping a nid on a small gang though :)

&gt; probably most Legacy Titans wouldnt have risked it and spotted the trap!

the first part? sure, but from experience the second is not really the case. Their wranglers? some yes.
---
&gt;honor brawl
---
&gt; Is it like a thing? Probably people would expect to be fucked over?

they can expect what they want based on whatever they decide to, but worse case you just get a no, or get your subcaps blobbed, so theres not much to lose.

So as expected, you are wrong. Gee, what a surprise.
---
Kusion discussion starts as 12:21 and ends at 1:03:00
---
In that time, discussion covers:
---
\* CONCORD response times
---
\* Preparing a system
---
\* How long CONCORD remains in system and how they despawn
---
\* Maximising the output of gank ships (and why - because they are all dead)
---
\* Motivation for ganking
---
\* Being able to bump autopiloting freighters and freighters that are not using webs (about 5-10 seconds discussion about it being possible, nothing more discussed)
---
\* Ganking freighters that are webbing
---
\* Advice to use Red Frog or use smaller ships and do multiple ships or Jump Freighters
---
\* ISK amount for Kusion to gank or not gank (lot of different variables and no one catch all number that makes you safe)
---
\* Are there any fits that Kusion can't gank (in Marauders he has failed multiple ganks, and in Arks and Anshars with implants and bulkheads)
---
\* Fitting options of freighters (cargo v tank trade off)
---
\* Nerfs to ganking since original emergence of suicide ganking
---
\* Belief that GMs may have teleported freighters in the early years, but doesn't know for sure, just suspicion and no admission at all from CCP (to Kusion or otherwise)
---
\* Bumping for hours - Kusion believes it is a little bit over powered, and says go petition the GMs and believes they will be on your side. But not a single case of that having happened, just a belief of Kusion. Hasn't happened to him at all.
---
\* EULA breaking - not something Kusion does. He hates bumping and just bumps for the minimum. Other guys bump longer and Kusion has no clue what their limit is, but bumpers/gankers work within the EULA so don't face any issue. EULA breaking tends to come from the other side. GMs have told them that they can't delay CONCORD for a significant period of time due to things like load on server node, etc. One example where everyone was banned for 30 days due to delay of CONCORD, but nothing to do with bumping (GMs have changed their ruling since that original ban)
---
\* Contract jobs (Kusion doesn't do it because of the effort required to move and variability in intel)
---
\* Burn Jita
---
\* Getting in ganking
---
\* Ganking for profit in fleets of multiple players, not just multi-boxing (how is ISK distributed)
---
\* Being kicked from Goons for ganking a freighter
---
\* Bans from CCP
---
\* twitch stream link
---
So no, you've still haven't proved the bullshit you are spinning.
---
A master of understaments you are! If you think that is special, I shutter to think what the word terrifying means to you.
---
Yeah, this is *not* a thing. It never happened. 
---
The people who aren't mentioning it are not morons. 
---
If you disagree, and believe this was patched in, point me at the patch-notes for it.
---
true I will give it a try when the situation fits! :)
---
Laughed harder than I should have
---
I was one of the TEST dreads that dropped literally seconds after you died, it was absolutely fucking awesome to have a brawl right next to the big memorial to B-R and I had been meaning to fly down there and check it out for a while and this was definitely a good way to check it out.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Sorry your titan died, glad you had a laugh and learnt something though.
---
Gf goons.
---
Literally this is a guy bitching for the sake of bitching. These same points have been made ad nauseum. We will see another Reddit Warrior come in next week and post the same ignorant drivel.
---
Seeing his positive attitude about the losses I wonder how many ratting/rorq alts he has to not care that much about such a big loss.
---
Hey, I helped kill you!
---
It was definitely a prime example of why I play EVE, not because we won the engagement, but because of the scale of the battle itself. 
---
I remember in comms when the Nid appeared on d-scan people were very confused lol
---
perfect reason to go there I guess! :D
---
Ranger Regiment, Space Monkeys alliance, GoTG. I dont know what larger groups these guys are attached to, but they are mostly independant small groups that have big brothers to call in time of serious trouble.
---
Flair checks out
---
Armarr Victor!
---
have you ever tried this shit? hard as fuck, give the guy some props
---
Thank you!!!
---
More sour grapes from the have nots.  The anti-nullbloc, anti-super umbrella crown will only be satisfied when supers are defensless and it takes three months of using them to recoup their cost.
---
Time of serious trouble = 5 man gang in their space. They're the larger groups with different names.
---
If you want someone to fly with for a few hours so you can ask all the questions you can come up with, let me know. Mentoring newer players is more rewarding to me than actually playing the game nowadays :P
---
probably less than alot of people that would rage about it! :P Yeah I rorq mined moons and super ratted to get the titan in the first place, but I dont have like an army of rorqs that make it back in a day or something stupid. Is there a tool that could monitor accumulated income over multiple toons over time? I would be interested to see how long it will actually take me to recoup the lost value.
---
Entosis them and they will show up!
---
&gt; I tried to avoid it, but where my limited faction 3s are currently exist in or around invasion space. I could go grind 1s and 2s elsewhere i guess, though ive lived in the area for years. Maybe try lowsec hubs for my l3s but again i was after low stress playing. Something i had before but seems lost.
---
Unless your standards are just totally FUBAR for some reason, getting them high enough for level 3s is usually pretty fast.
---
TBH, it sounds like you're carving out an extremely narrow box for yourself where you're only willing to operate in ONE locale, doing ONE type of activity that is mostly done in a particularly vulnerable hull.
---
Eve is a huge game with a done of different options available, and the occasional bit of adversity is to be expected - even in highsec.  If you're not willing to change *anything* about what you're doing then you're probably right and Eve isn't for you.
---
I be a lot more interested in seeing how many Nullsec VNI alts are training into haulers and battleships to mine in highsec.
---
Its nice to see such a scale without any TIDI or weird shit happening as well! 
---
I would expect people to be more confused when they saw the titan yolo in? :D
---
That sounds accurate.  I think the new mechanic is flawed but you are right.  I am only assuming that this will happen anywhere i go.  This was i think why i posted this post here.  I will try again.
---
Well I need to figure out all the mistakes to make sure I do at least a few less on my next titan drop, right? :D
---
Lol. Maybe you the tengu, perhaps 1-2 others if anyone else at all.
---
youre in fucking goons lol
---
I seriously expected a shitton of downvotes from people who think I wanted to make you feel miserable or whatever!
---
I applaud you for being a good sport! 
---
I was simply  wondering how many alts you have, because the most toons I ever had were 3 and I were FAAAAAAAAAAR away from being able to even buy a Super/Titan. 
---
And no I don´t know of any tool that would show you the  accumulated income over multiple toons over time. 
---

---
That's an "I'll face tank your kinetic super" build getting blown up from a severe case of "too cocky" on some bait. I would have had a hyperspatial clone (mix mids and highs to your price flavour) in with a 5% evasive manu as well. This thing goes about 10.5 AU from memory with the clone I had.   
---
 [https://zkillboard.com/kill/76160443/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76160443/) 
---
Hyperspatial optimised roamer, also getting blown up by bait. This one would have had an asklepsian set in it's head, with which it's little active tank is 100% safe vs ishtars and lower. That baby has a &lt;3s align time, 1000 dps, and 6.47 (I believe) warp with a 615 implant.
---
6AU warp is a good minimum breakpoint to aim for - it is a soft-cap. Warp acceleration and speed have no cap, but deacceleration does - 6AU.
---
Note I recommend having an alt that can fly an interceptor. 4 deaths in 5 you'll save your pod, even in null, so any time you fly a T3C on a roam without a head that cost as much as the ship, "doing it wrong" in my books.
---
Well it works until you get a bad server tick and get instalocked by a tornado. I just had to decide if i get a dst or br to haul my abyssal loot to jita, and i rather go the brick tanked way than relying on luck/ a perfect connection to not lose billions of loot.
---
&gt;minmy
---
The invasions will move, so there could be one somewhere else, say, tomorrow (and, similarly, where you are now might be clear).
---
You can see where they are by checking The Agency in game, or the in-game map.  
---
On the in-game map, click the gear icon at the top of the map, go to "NPC Activity" and select Triglavian Invasion.  Zoom out and the lit-up systems are where the invasions currently are.  
---
Personally, I would really recommend you look into security missions, or some other combat-oriented income source over distribution missions.  Distribution pays very poorly.
---
You could even make a "career" out of salvaging the wrecks of the invasion rats as they're destroyed by other players - the salvage can be quite valuable.  Yes, this will upset the invasion hunters, but that's fun too. :)
---
Use instadocks far from the main warp in.
---
Alternstively, just do your abyssals in Jita
---
I love to have someone insta drop on me , thanks CCP .
---
&gt; They're Cruiser hulls and you can't make it so they outperform T2 Cruiser 
---
Why not? Kikis practically do as destroyers.
---
Try freighter next time
---
FOR ALL THE ENGAGING GAMEPLAY!!!!
---
/u/ccpfalcon taking notes
---
The point I'm making here is that local doesn't provide perfect Intel. How about every dien voting explain why I am wrong instead of beibg upset I am not following the narrative.
---
finally a b-r levi dies, just 5 years late
---
You're the one making the point, I'm just suggesting a possible reason why your data might not say what you think it does. You've got no proof, or 'hard evidence' that a reduction in logins is bad for EVE. It's the quality of those logins that matters, and the overall activity level within the game.
---
Are you that desperate for attention that you post such a pointless video?
---
How can you kill supers? With Dreads, Supers and Titans.... Its not a mystery... Get some of those ... apply generously to target Supers... They die... 
---
The deeper problem is people seem to keep looking for a solution when theres no problem. 
---
You want to small gang PVP a titan/super fleet? Sorry... 
---
True problem is multiboxing rorquals.... its literally a mathematical equation... X Rorquals make X Amount of ISK/ore per Day... Need X amount of injectors for the next one... So every X days ... I get one more Rorqual... as the process speeds up as you go along... until your shitting out a titan a day.
---
Limiting multiboxing rorquals to like... 2 or 3... and this will balance out after awhile.
---
Bears. Crabs. ... Crabby bears? No... Unbearably crabby. Hmm.
---
... ManBearCrab. *Shrieks in terror*
---
It took me a while to figure out too, gave me a mini heart attack at first.
---
I got 3 as well :) But only 2 are able to mine/rat and stuff like that. The titan toon is just that basicely.   
---
The way I went at it is VNI ratting -&gt; Carrier ratting -&gt; Super ratting -&gt; double rorq mining belts -&gt; double rorq mining moons (all the time doing some market stuff on the side to speed up the isk generating and I ran my own 10/10 before I upgraded to super ratting after that I started to sell them). Never invested money into Plex but I paid most of my game time with real money so all the isk I got was basicely my income. I didnt have to pay PLEX with isk that often.
---
It's because the spaniard crew has been rorq and super ratting in that pocket.
---
exactly. bigger targets also mean more opportunities.
---
at this rate, goon posting is even more sub-human trash than highsec wardec corps
---
CCP should add the wreck to the monument just to show titan diversity :P
---
You could get content by leaving GOONS and joining literally any other entity in the game...
---
TL;DR, I rate 0/5 stars on Yelp.
---
Story breaks down when goons get praised for tackling well.
---
Wow.  What is your printer setup?  That print looks amazing.
---
There are already items like that in the DB. Mods installed in a Keepstar, which means residents will have to turn Local back on one system at a time.
---
Fits on force recon only. Problem 90% solved.
---
As the guy who was FC'ing the Goon fleet, it was a lot of fun. I didn't really expect to break a Levi so that shit made my month. Thanks for the content. Thanks CCP for blackout and the opportunity to do this moving caps without being scouted.
---
Thanks. In my quality settings for Cura, I set the line height to be 0.1 mm. That's supposed to give a good boost to the fidelity of the print. My printer is an unmodded CR-10s.
---
So even worse struc proliferation?

**FAIR AND** (equal) **BALANCE[D]**

Space Monkey Alliance? Those spineless players would dock up when someone would log into Star Citizen. Don’t pretend like they were creating content.
---
Here is how stations are named in Brave :
---
1) A group of people come together and decide they want to drop a station.
---
2) Based on their common goals and possibly in jokes, they concoct a clever name that is both amusing and appropriate.
---
3) Said group writes out a well thought out propsal to leadership about why they want to name this station the way they do.
---
4) The proposal is submitted, preferably in triplicate. One to Brave  leadership, one to Goon leadership, and one to Test leadership. We're not really clear on whose pets we are exactly, but reddit assures us that we definitely are.
---
5) n0rman names the station after a sex pun or, more rarely, a science fiction franchise. Even more rarely, both.
---
That Tengu does zero DPS. Anyway, there's another guy here having a go at me for playing it too safe, and you having a go at me for playing it too risky. None of us are wrong, none of us are right, just play the game however you want.
---
What it needs is the strat's bay
---
https://i.imgur.com/MmeRqyl.png

it is quite literally perfect, as it lets you know whenever a threat is nearby

*Laughs in Nullfied*
---
This is the kind of guy I want to fly with
---
Praise James.
---
Doesn't everyone who cries about null mean goons?
---
But if they acknowledge this how will they continue the circle jerk?
---
More anti-goon circlejerking.  Keep dreaming cause your vision will never be a reality.
---
&gt;I’d like to join a Corp that’s friendly to newbies
---
E-Uni has that covered better than anyone else. Basically the only thing that they don't do is SovNull. PVP is done less than PVE, but it happens. Of the six campuses, three are in high security space, so generally more boring (although great places to get started on industry). If you're interested in PVP (or more interesting content in general), E-Uni does a decent amount of stuff in NPC Null (Syndicate) and Caldari-Gallente FW space too. In fact, I can't think of a night where there hasn't been a Uni LowSec roam recently. The Wormhole Campus requires a bit more to gain access to (mainly Cloaking IV and the ability to fly doctrine, along with time in-corp, nothing too weird), though, and since it's not usually near Caldari-Gallente FW space, I generally don't encounter those guys very often (except occasionally when I'm doing exploration for ISK), but I have heard good things about them. They're just not as much of a hardcore wormhole operation as a C5 corp would be since the corp's focus is helping newer players learn about aspects of the game.
---
Pandemic Horde is definitely doing fairly well these days. Just announced that they are consolidating in one region and taking the Goonswarm approach. Building up as much as possible in a small area. They're now the strongest in their coalition.
---
You owe me 6 minutes of my life back. You can repay by posting your lossmails.
---
I will certainly remember for longer than a month! My first titan kill in a weird way xD Never was able to kill an enemy one so far... one day!
---
Thank you!  Strange that torpedoes are so bad a weapon, but I guess I just need to apply them to larger, slower targets.
---
If they want to burn a 30mil barge they're going to do it.  Your best defense is to always be orbiting, have your drones out, and insure your hull.  If it pops, you get most of it(minus fittings and cargo) back.  Do not afk mine in an exhumer(t2 hull), you will be much more attractive a target.  Mine in a group with an orca, they are more likely to try for a shitfit orca booster than your t1 broke ass.
---
So it tells me if they are active, if they are docked, if they are cloaked, and where they are in system? There is literally an insane amount of info it doesn't give that can be actively detrimental.
---
Honestly, the really only good option for krabbing as an alpha after CCP has nerfed/is nerfing alpha krabbing, is null/WH exploration.  Not sure where you're exploring but that Imicus can go into null (generally via wormholes) and make 50-200M an hour doing data/relic sites.  You'll likely die a lot until you get used to it, and not being able to cloak makes it harder as an alpha, but one good can literally pays for like 10 fitted imicuses.  You can even dump them in a random hostile citadel in system and asset safety it to avoid having to haul it back if you think you're gonna die.
---
Most other options are frankly pretty terrible without omega, but if you really want to you can PLEX pretty easily via explo, and then use that income to do what you want/stay Omega or just keep exploring for your $$.
---
Can i see ur fit and perhaps could u teach me how to do it? I wanna solo C3s but i heard it takes a 1bil isk rattlesnake ;(
---
That's a nice strawman you have there. Try arguing against the point made. I'm sure you can do better.
---
I thankfully have not lost a titan yet. Killed several now though. Sadly you weren't TEST. Fuck test forever...
---
Caldari master race. I upvote.
---
I didn't know this was a thing! My names on it! I might have to go visit! 😁
---
Might be lag between alpha to omega state.  Also, check your industrial skills, at some point freighters now require racial indy 5 where they didn't before.
---
why is that? is it like the goons vs test narrative or is there a personal level story to it?
---
They'll be service modules, which means you have to keep each one fueled for it to work. And it'll mean that many more Citadels to blow up later on.
---
They're FotM new content ships, just as T3Cs were when they were OP.
---
Every game that adds a new character has that issue. Trigs will see their balance pass, hopefully sometime soon.
---
TLDR version - I came back from a Afghan deployment and was looking for a new corp as my old one closed. I found a TEST corp to join. They scammed me of a Navy Apoc and my corpse collection. Kicked me from corp and said get fucked. So....yea. I would rather see them die than Panfam.
---
Long time elite player new to eve. 
---
I see the PvP is just as ganky as elite. Nice.
---
Most groups like that can snap form quite a few dreads actually.
---
If you have enough speed before impact everything fits ;)
---
What kind of setup would you recommend for an auto-cannon setup? I want to be able to fight most ships from frigates to BCs in the case I get jumped I don't want to be extremely limited.
---
Recon against for example Angels, is a pretty hard one, especially the first room. Aprox. 1000 dps if you can't kill them as they appear. And with 4.5mil sp and probably not a very optimized T1 setup, it's no suprise you got yourself killed.
---
I suggest you to read and prepare better for the next time.
---
http://eve-survival.org/missions/
---
Edit: and by looking at your setup, it's no wonder you had no chance of surviving the mission. It fails in so many areas that I don't have the energy to guide you ahead. I'd suggest also reading the gazillion threads about "Raven for lvl4 missions"... Rolling Eyes

Goon is safe in goon space. In other news water is wet. More at 11.
---
&gt; Is there a way to tell if where you are buying something inside invasion space? 
---
Right click on order &gt; location &gt; set destination
---
see if any triangles show up.
---
How much did this stuff even cost like 200m?
---
Carriers pop quick enough. I haven't seen much regular ratting carriers recently. They are either ratting in a supers or don't rat at all.
---
Its a bit about perception.
---
Free to play generally is interepreted to mean that the VAST VAST majority of content is available for free, barring (if its a decent game) some cosmetic items.
---
EVE isn't like that at all.
---
It may be by definition free to play, but that's not going to make people feel like that makes sense. It would then be described as a "pay to win".
---
you can't drop titans in high sec
---
&gt; "dont bother buying expensive ships until you can survive invasion, or are super rich"
---
No, just don't go into the invasion systems.
---
Good luck, My advice.. don't mine.. just join a new player corp for a while. r/evejobs

Kikis have insane amount of DPS though. For ship of it's size they offer very high firepower.
---
IMO, there are only two good responses to Kiki fleet. Proper Harpy fleet, or cap fleet with HAW dreads, carriers and maybe some Faxes. For sake of sanity, let's leave boson titans out of equation. Only bigger weapon system that could apply well enough are RLMLs. And they would require fielding rather expensive HAC fleet.
---
Manpower wise, cap fleet might be the most efficient solution. Isk-wise, Harpy fleet, but that kind of composition requires rather larger numbers. HACs are in the wierd spot, because they are aren't efficient in any way, at least as a counter doctrine.
---
I don't know any exact plans, but I guess they're coming with the next event or patch soon (TM). On the other hand, there's quite a lot of stuff (apparel and skins) that are listed on the market for quite a while, but haven't been seeded yet.
---
That structure's actually had that name since it was still an outpost.
---
Is it an any% speedrun?
---
Lol now you are just trying to pick apart every single inaccuracy.  You just replied to several posts arguing with whatever statements you see as "flawed".  Everything you have "refuted"; even the questions you ask are answered elsewhere.  You really are bad at this trolling thing.
---
It's not trolling to answer to comments and concerns, mate.
---
Nobody is out to get you.
---
Nobody treat regular caps as something special. They are just a ships, good in some things, bad in others. 
---
Effective, all ships in this game should be regarded as an something more akin to ammo. You use them, you lose them, you take another one and use it as nothing has happened.
---
And don't take it as something of display of power, or anything else.
---
From the perspective of attacked party, Kiki gang/T3C gang/whatever you want, is a problem that has to be solved. Be it cap fleet/harpy fleet/whatever other doctrine they are just a tool made to achieve the goal. FCs decide based on their own judgement which tool is the best for each situation.
---
&gt; probably most Legacy Titans wouldnt have risked it and spotted the trap! 
---
They wouldn't spot the trap, they are just cowards
---
This is what you get for flying a disgusting Caldari cowardmobile and not a hyperspatial rag ;)
---
jokes aside feels bad man you were one of the bright spots in Evictus for me, glad to see your chin up tho, just means now you can buy a real titan :)
---
Here’s something that will be quite useful: you will have ships. Many ships.
---
There are two things you want to know about ships:
---
a) you’re going to lose ships. Not if, when. Do not get emotionally invested in ships. One day you’ll undock and you’re not returning to the dock in that ship. Count on it. Don’t moan about it, don’t petition GMs. Get another ship, carry on. Not investing yourself emotionally will be extremely easy on your psyche.
---
b) being able to fly the ship \[having the skill to fly the ship\] and having the necessary skills to use all the modules that make the ship effective, are two entirely different things. Flying the ship but not being able to fit all the necessary modules to fly it effectively will make you go to a) really quickly. AND: even though you have all the skills to fly all the modules for the ship you’re flying, *will not prevent* a) from happening.
---
Those are the facts of life in New Eden. If you can live with that: welcome to EVE.
---
Is this something you can actually do? Because if so that’s honestly pretty impressive.
---
ThermonuclearTake: Supers just shouldn't have ever been in the game, and since we can't delete them, they should be nerfed into irrelevancy and hopefully forgotten about.
---
ah, the kind of content I kinda wish eve was.
---
but I am sure you'll find the second you undock, your solo roaming carrier is tackled by 20 bombers or 20 titans (or anything in between) and you'll be dead.
---
Nergal for the fucking win.
---
I'm currently saving my pennies to do just this. I've been working on the training for a little while. Went through many iterations of ships before I landed on these 9. Its not perfect but it'll be fun. And if it goes terribly, now any of killmails will have some background. I did this for a bit in an Orca and had a lot of fun, but I've always wanted to do it in a carrier.
---
I suggest fitting scanning mods instead of anti combat scan eccm sebos. It's very unlikely to get caught at a safe if you keep moving in a scanning frigate. By the time something lands on you to bubble, you ar e already at least 20 or more km off, then you make warp to your next safe. Fit your t1 scanner for agility, and it could be quite hard to get caught.
---
When you do not actually read what is written, and respond off the cuff to individual statements you are either ignorant or trolling.  I was giving you the benefit of the doubt.  There is a whole picture here.  Try looking at that.
---
Well. The game is translated to less spoken languages, even with a smaller player base than hispanic... But they don't translate to spanish...
---
So I did some googling (it’s been quite some time since I’ve last been active but the null arc blackout has caught my interest) and I can see how you could move the ships around ez with the 1000km3 SMB, but are you able to build new ships in the carrier, or is it something you have to make pit stops for? Because I’ve honestly never thought of this before (partially because I’m still a couple months out from flying caps iirc) but it sounds intriguing and hella fun.
---
Figure if nothing else I could just lol my way around wormholes and look for explorers to kill, unless wingspan shows up I guess.
---
Are you going to buy your next titan with your credit card or pop rats for 300 hrs of gameplay
---
Lol, love how you had to mention you’ve got a thick coat to toxic ppl. What a great reputation.
---
This game really is a special type of disease. You’ll go far friend!
---
Fly dangerous
---
They specialize in torpedo delivery not bomb delivery
---
I am.
---
It mostly seems like the whole picture is just mad about bad decisions.
---
I'm trying to figure out where in that there might be nuggets of reality but you have now pulled us into a meta discussion instead of actually responding to what is written.
---
this raven couldn't stand five npc frigates, but stand the test of time it did
---
eleven years and counting o7
---
They had subcaps, so i brought a subcap killer. They see my subcap killing cap and bring in a cap killer. Totes unfair. /s
---
Ravens and Slashers will be welped at will, so Ill be manufacturing in NPC stations and towing around researched BPOs with me. And honestly as long as I'm going station to station I should be just fine. Give it a thought... You can do this with any carrier. I just think the Chimera looks the coolest.
---
Im not familiar with FW.  Security missions are just more ratting.
---
Well, more condensed and more profitable.
---
But also, FW is nice!
---
You lost 5 ships in AFK combat. Dude\[ette?\], what are you even doing?
---
Zero analysis on fleet combat use of cynos. You simply focused on it's defensive potential, bringing friends to defend cynoing ship, but you forget about it's offensive applications such as providing entry point for a bridge'ing or jumping in and attack fleet. Changes you suggested would gut all kinds of offensive cyno applications.
---
You can't break those cuffs.
---
Gotcha. I didn’t think you could do industry on a ship but I’ve been gone a while and wasn’t 100% sure if they’d changed it. It’s something I’d like to do, for sure, but probably not for some time; not only am I lacking the skills needed to do it, but I’m pretty sure I’m fairly broke too. If I’m gonna go nomad in a carrier I’d like to have a decent cushion of isk to work with first.
---
And yeah, Chimera does look the coolest. Helps too that Caldari master race.
---
I heard they’ve expanded to all types of munitions. /u/wingspantt can confirm?
---
honestly dude, this is what eve has become about for the last few years. i remember the first time i saw a super carrier was when PL (i think) dropped 3 supers on a skiff, nothing else just a skiff, and we ended up throwing t1 frigs at them just to try get a killmail with a rev (sansha super) on it cause noone had seen one before. fast forward 3 years and now i get to join in as we drop 250 bombers on a ratting battleship. cause in eve there is no such thing as overkill....only under-commitment.
---
That's like half the population of Eve!
---
I always wished you could do this kind of lifestyle, I thought about doing it in WH space with an orca but it's just too easy to probe things.
---
I wish you could leave a ship in a safe and cloak it so you could actually live like this
---
Hunting veldspar asteroids for hours AFK... mind boggling!!
---
Test pets isn't really up for debate, goon pets is mostly following on from test tho
---
HOW DARE YOU BREAK THE NARRATIVE THAT PEOPLE WHO DON'T EVEN PLAY ANYMORE CREATED!
---
Most of hunters choose the prey that either can't fight back or cannot bring friends to help it. Taking a risk could make their killboard snuggly, and they don't want that.
---
Shooting structure is fun hahaha
---
#1 tip as soon as you are board with something you are doing do something else.
---
Forgot to say, take a bottle of bubbles, and blow them at them when they come after you!
---
Yes!! Too much downgrading from CCP and “rebalancing” it made it a joke... now the Loki has become a favorite... PLS CCP give us our Proteus back!! At least make it a worthy drone boat as a Gallente Tech III, it should be a super Gila!
---
I've been told they're test's pets and test are our pets so...ikd, petception?
---
Just park in NPC null stations, and WH space is pretty quiet in USTZ in particular.
---
that's why they spent 40 hours raging on a WH, because every time the rage rolled they ended up in panfam space :D It's better to hig Legacy and DeadCo every now and then so people have the illusion that they are not affiliated but when the situation arises, they are backed up by a HORDE fleet just randomly...
---
This is super cool original EVE content. Love the art style too.
---
Skins tend to appears in game a couple weeks or so before release, I think it's fair to assume these will not be event skins but store skins, due to them only being caldari.
---
Pretty sure the point is to jump the carrier around low or npc null stations and take out the other ships for fun. Done right, the carrier should never be at risk.
---
I summon you OP. Is the Astero really that dangerous. ? I solo explore in an astero.
---
They will adapt to the Dutch rudder.
---
As with 90% of the game your corp is what fixes this. 
---
If this happens in horde space(or any decent corp), I would ask in standing comms if one or two guys can fix my problem for a small bit of isk. I will end up with six dudes giving me an escort home. Most of them would tell me not to worry about the isk.
---
Next time when you set desto and there are triangles, you just have to bat phone some mates to bail you out.
---
They do, but people refer to it as an umbrella.
---
Then by your stance dotlan is perfect. Why do you need that perfect info? And yes it's provided in game but so was local so why not kill all of it.
---
Great story, and ships with a story are always great to hear about. 
---
But, really... These days, a ship like that is a drop in either partied bucket. 
---
The thrill of kills like these is kind of lost, when a dozen titans worth of kills happens against most entities in any given week now. 
---
I miss the days of storied super capitals being kills worth praising, but really this kill is worth no more than any other vet who made a mistake.
---
A bit of advice: leave your BPOs at home. BPCs are more than good enough and you can run as many as you want while the BPO stays safe and you can keep researching on it.
---
you make jokes but 3 years ago #1-3 would have definitely happened.
---
&gt;Then by your stance dotlan is perfect.
---
how do you figure?
---
&gt;Why do you need that perfect info?
---
i don't
---
&gt;And yes it's provided in game but so was local so why not kill all of it.
---
why not?
---
what's your point?
---
Yeah I’ve heard that there’s neckbeards in the game who just kos and do nothing but play eve
---
You can fit one to kill other relic/data running frigates quite well.
---
You're treating Reddit as one guy with one opinion. It is not, its thousands of people talking all at once. The only opinion you get is that of the poster you are reading at the time.
---
Yeah... but it sucks compared to the other T3s... CCP over balanced it into a joke ship... if you want a nice app for the proteus fast warp speed, watch Rist Ozuwara’s vídeo with a smartbomb equiped T3 cruiser... is fun to watch...
---
The Astero is actually dangerous, yes. Among the common explo frigates it has the widest realistic engagement envelope. You can wipe bombers off the field with a half-assed fit, and if you go for the shield kite fit you can murder VNIs.
---
why would you ever run T5s in jita? it's just asking to be ganked. go find a dead highsec system, then it will be safe
---
It's perfect because it perfectly provides the exact Intel it says it does. No question on if it's accurate. Your stance seems to be if the information is 100% accurate it is perfect so dotlan the in game map fit that definition.
---
If you don't need it we might as well remove it just like local then. Can't be providing people with free perfect Intel.
---
How does this work? Do you abandon your big ship to use small ones or get alts to run those?
---
&gt; assume i was talking bullshit like you are.
---
You don't need to project. You said some things that are outright wrong, either based in ignorance or exaggeration. That's just fact. If someone pointing that out to you is so annoying, then you should try to be more accurate in your tales.
---
The best way to deal with people saying outright wrong information is to clarify those details to get to the reality. THat's what I was doing.
---
&gt; You are trolling wether you realize it or not. 
---
That is not how trolling works, mate.
---
This meta discussion is funny, because I was debating offering you a couple hundred million isk to help you learn. But here you are just biting.
---
Considering 5m sp is not enough to unlock a vast majority of skills, ships, weapons, modules, or playstyles....
---
You might want to reevaluate that....
---
sorry not a WH corp
---
tl;dr: He couldn't out damage my repair, and I gave him advice on how to kill me in the future. We are friends now.
---
Trust me, they do more good than harm.
---
Love this art, gives me FTL feels
---
Nice chat.
---
That loki fit is pretty bad though....so much stuff to try to be cap stable that he can't do any damage.
---
Nah, only station things you can do in space are the same as what they were whenever you last played, which is refitting, and using clone bays. No industry without a station/citadel/POS still.
---
Jesus that last fight......
---
Nice video and fights, dude!
---
pause and restart.
---
To be fair, supers and titans were already out of control before injectors hit. All injectors did was amplify an existing problem.
---
I just use the Fkeys and move everything to the top row.
---
That is correct yes.
---
From frigates to titans, the shakes is the biggest killer in Eve.
---
I commend you for being a good sport and thanks for the good read.
---
Under the Kiki Tree
---
We rolled into RR space and a dictor caught a rattlesnake.  We rage formed armor kiki and I was out in a nano shield kiki.  We were about to break the rattle and then a bunch of sub caps came in and a nyx.  We fought for about 30 minutes and popped the nyx as they cynod in a bunch of carriers to save it.  We booshed out as soon as it popped and lost nearly nothing.  BR below.

GF bro. What an amazing time. Fuck yeah bro great attitude, I hate all the salt slinging, even if it is mostly for funsises it gets old. You're a quality fuckin dude.
---
29 Frigs kill a Super.. JEFFRAIDER SHOW
---
However, you are not lockable upon activating the cloak.
---
Months? I've seen people do it in minutes if they didn't spend to long creating their character.
---
Park in station
---
A stealth bomber can warp cloak and immediately lock upon exiting cloak.
---
So a rocket bomber would be your worst enemy as a frigate explorer.
---
It could potentially have you locked and tackled 2 seconds after decloaking.
---
also consider you can have 20 of these accounts and unlock all of those
---
also consider you don't even need to log in to play the game
---
also consider that 99% of in game activities are doable with free to play accounts, and 100% of meta activities are too
---
Im downvoting this, stop giving away our plans
---
&gt;If you don't need it we might as well remove it just like local then.
---
like i said before, i'm not against it, but you're ignorant if you can't see the clear difference between local, which is ACTIVE intelligence, and dotlan, which is statistical intelligence and only used in broad terms
---
Keepstars are fairly cheap in comparison lol
---
Man that was SO MUCH FUN. It made me so happy to be able to say OVERHEAT NOW LET'S GO FOR IT even though I wasn't FCing at all. Shout out to Daniel Sunkist Lennelluc and Wood Vulcan. Those dudes are daring and ballsy but also have ice water for blood. How lucky can a dude get coming back to EVE and having these kind of dudes creating content?! WE BACK BABY
---
I think the idea of a cyno is stupid to begin with, a "power source strong enough to lock onto" you mean like the FREAKING SUN IN EVERY SYSTEM? LoL
---
I mean come on, it shouldn't even be a thing.
---
&gt; But I got literally killed instantly.
---
Well, that definitely didn't happen.
---
Mind linking the killmail?
---
Armor Kiki? Nano Kiki ? What the fuck is all this “kiki”
---
Omega gets both...so I don't know what you are asking...?
---
Do you mean get the omega skills for the days you checked already as alpha?
---
Yes.
---
Days you totally missed? No, you still have to log in 7 times in the 10 day window.
---
Just buy a permit and don't mine afk.
---
Could someone kindly explain to me, like explaining to a 5 year old ,what is going on here and why... ?
---
1 ship per cyno? But still costs fuel? I am just spit balling, but I've always hated the 10 minute timer also.
---
I think the bigger question here is who uses a tengu to drop sins on a noctis...
---
Redundant. Just kill the poor thing with the tengu.
---
OH
---
i get it now thank you
---
The point I was making the entire time is it isn't perfect but you wanted to redefine that so I had to go with your definition. Beyond local the worst statistical information we have actually is zkill imo.
---
How much this cost In isk and what skills you need to do this? I'm also a bit intrested in this build but I'm nowhere near the skills required
---
That is a beautiful nyx fit. 15 possible slots for tank rigs/mods and not a single one to be found.
---
I am 1 week in as a new alpha player, mining ore with a venture with two mining lazer II's and getting 700,000 ISK per run. Although, that is a tiny amount compared to omega upgrades, it is teaching me about the game. Just keep the skill queue updated, log on early, add a few skills to learn.. and before you sleep etc.
---
Seems more like a job for Bomber's Bar and Grill.
---
you literally lost the real argument and your tryhard semantic argument
---
Pausing doesn't fix it. Removing and putting it back doesn't. Removing all and putting them back doesn't. Even with different skills it reports as if the "pre 15" is how they're timing. Logged out and back in.
---
It's not the biggest thing in the world; it's only 21.6k skill points. I just kind of started to focus on it and check all the formulas on skill training so it got me wondering if I was missing something in the formulas too.
---
Yea, i'm *sure* TEST collectively conspired against you to steal your shiny Navy apoc and corpses. There's dicks out there, sure, but blaming the entirety of TEST is irrational.
---
people still play that?
---
FUCKING BULLSHIT CHEATER HACKERS WHY DID MY SUPERCARRIER NOT KILL THOSE DESTROYERS GOT DAMMIT WHAT THE FUCK
---
This is far too wholesome for /r/Eve 
---
/s
---
Why is a loki carry torpedos ?
---
we laughed hard.
---
Kikimora
---
None of those are true, tho.
---
You can think that but if local was perfect Intel we would have never had people complain about afk cloakers.
---
you're calling content as 'being able to fly a ship' but that's not what content is
---
content is the ability to participate in certain activities:
---
what activities, in your mind, are impossible to do with only a free-to-play account?
---
Math
---
&gt;I'm part of Wangspin. It is a dedicated wormhole corp.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;So does that mean you guys have a wormhole base?  
---
&gt;No. We just roam.
---
Ouch. XD
---
Great attitude man. Felt that way when I lost my Aeon. Did better than I thought I would and was happy to use it. Also lasted like 2.5 minutes to the 16 second Hel that died on field with me haha
---
Words cannot describe just how much I want this to become a common playstyle. Carriers and carrier pilots are everywhere, let's split up the power blocs and blue donuts and all go nomadic. 
---
It's why I love wormholes, and orca life.
---
Valkyries do explosive damage. I'm assuming he wasn't using augmented/integrated.
---
Probably just poor skills, if both of you were perfectly skilled he would have enough dps with that fit to break you shooting any ammo type + t2 drones. It would suck and take a while, but it would happen.
---
It takes guts and a couple accounts but it's absolutely doable, and fun as shit. I did the same with an orca before and it's just nice to trot around new space every day. Part of why I love wormholes.
---
NO ITS A **SUPER**CAPITAL SHIP IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO KILL SOME STUPID TECH ONE DESTROYERS WHAT THE HELL THESE CHEATER HACKERS JUST MATERIALIZED, LOCAL WASNT WORKING, NEAR2 DIDNT PING ME TO LET ME KNOW I HAD DANGER AND THEN MY FUCKING NYX DIED WHAT THE HELL!!!????!!!!111
---
For solo ganking and also using HAM's, no. No it's not.
---
The astero is more a cloaky combat ship than an explorer, but not being able to fit an expanded launcher without crippling the fit kinda hurts it. 
---
Still, it's phenomenal for hunting explorers and getting cloaky tackle on guys in anoms.
---
Didn't think so.
---
I'm pretty sure most 100mn fits are super niche for kiting, and more often fleet comps to keep a fleet moving.
---
Well this didn't age well
---
There is a tool! jEveAssets
---
https://eve.nikr.net/jeveasset
---
When you arrive at the monument give their office a wave, they are always watching.
---
Now this was actually funny.
---
This is true
---
I did this play-style in about 2008/2009. Used to be in Deklein which didn't have any stations in the pipe that comes from Venal near the SE on Dotlan. Plopped a small tower, ran DED's from the Carrier using an Ishar if I recall correctly. Would never be able to get away with that these days lol :(
---
Yeah, I said it isn't. If you are even nano gang in a loki it will literally never work with HAM's, you will generally use arty. You get 38km range max with that fit which is a no go when you have 0 maneuverability. Plus he is solo ganking in a wormhole with a cloaky ship, literally no reason to not just use a decent mwd fit. The entire fit isn't very good, but he's obviously still learning, so at least he is out there. Good on him.
---
do you love me?
---
If I wasn't so attached to NJED I'd straight up start a corp to spread nomad carriers and orcas around somewhere like syndicate
---
yup. At least he tried.
---
Probably needed both lows to be BCS
---
Probably will be released in NES in the foreseeable future
---
Exactly , don’t fall for the hypocrisy they want easy hunt kills just as much as we want easy defending cap kills .... bunch of hypocrisy
---
Perfect skills would have broke him regardless of damage type here.
---
Until he fly,s a cap ... and then let the hypocrisy begin.
---
🙏 Amen.
---
Nah blame TAPI let's go.
---
As long as you have the easy button, it’s all good!
---
lol I was just making conversation cause it was something that I had heard of!
---
The booshing was a bit annoying but we just reshipped and came back :) 
---
   
---
  
---
It's a shame that the only time minnis untethered from citadel is when the 2 booshes happened - Quite disappointing in them for not actually participating in the fight.
---
10/10
---
that there is 100% accurate
---
forsenCD
---
&gt;semantics
---
You can move an orca around pretty well with mwd+cloak, if you're reasonably experienced moving around anyway. 
---
Once you get it safed, cloaky except for brief moments using refit, dumping ore or loot, or switching ships. 
---
You can assemble frigs in main cargo (with 2 cargo expanders) and move them to ship maintenance bay for alt to grab also. 
---
I play with 5 'mains' on as many accounts and 4 of them are orca capable. Very utilitarian ship for entire spectrums of playstyle.
---
Nexr eve invasion tour they will announce it.
---
There is no 100% safe  that is exaggeration.
---
Carrier is ~1Bil for the Hull, maybe slightly more if you aren’t in a major alliance, a Tengu is like 400mil absolute minimum, good fits can be 1-2bil, Astero is 75mil or so, assuming cheap fit, Raven is maybe 250-300mil?, Crane is like 200-300 mil, rest combined is maybe 250mil, you could probably do the lot for 2.5-5Bil
---
I'll be damned if Sig hasn't replaced it already. Even chatted with the guy who showed up to set it.
---
Go for it pilot! Leaving my old alliance and creating my first corp was the best EVE decision I ever made. Been flying with the same people for 6+ years now and it's always been a blast.
---
So disregarding anything that doesn't fit the narrative is semantics. So let's go to the basics.
---
If local was perfect Intel no one would have ever complained about afk cloaks.
---
Nah CODE likes easy hs kills , they love easy buttons too just like everyone else ... you filthy hypocrites lol 😝
---
great stuff man!!
---
I like you, hard work and dedication AND a positive attitude :)
---
Meh overstatement imo my pvp remained the same only thing is  , I spend more time doing actual none massive fleet pvp going after something just to feed is ....dumb.
---
My solo pvp , my roaming , my hot dropping , my space defense  my cloacky hunting all takes time to do , blackout hasn’t really generated a significant more kills.
---
Just more time dedicated towards it. 
---
Which can get boring as well.
---
*goon SIG

jeff
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
They needed us last night, for sure. They couldn't have had that fight without us.
---
And it does a pretty damn great job of it.  Except it doesn't know the value of titan and super hulls, so I had to edit that manually.
---
it's perfect to know when a threat exists in system.
---
Crab crab and more bs none sense again your generalizing , most real crabs generate 250 mil to 400 mil a hr , most of those that  are not botters and work for a Chinese sweat shop actually use the isk for pvp purposes , you don’t think I take a risk for dropping my nyx on someone in space ? 
---
Well guess what , I would like to have saved up enough isk to replace it because one day ..... that nyx will go boom !
---
And a well fitted super is easily 20 bn + 
---
I mean unless you just want to pvp in small stuff all the time and keep your risk below the 100mil mark , who the carebear now huh ?, me I like to try the game out in all aspects of it .
---
if you're at your keyboard, you can warp off before anyone can enter the site with you. that's 100% safety
---
Amazing idea. How feasible would it be to do it in a dread instead of a carrier?
---
shut up loser
---
Nobody cares. Go away.
---
Its actually one of the really disappointing things I've learned about the culture of the playerbase since I came back to the game recently. The amount of alt-right or just straight up racists on comms is fucking gross.
---
Not really. Just a bunch of no life neckbeards trying to be edgy for attention.
---
I don't see the difference?
---
No. The cyno is fine. The jump-drive is the problem. 
---
A ship jumps perfectly, or it doesn't jump at all. There's no middle-ground. 
---
*AND*, a perfect jump requires no effort from the jumping pilot. You just click undock, then right-click on the person spamming `jjjjjjjjj` in fleet. In an Umbrella fleet, an idiot is just as likely to reach the destination as the practiced, disciplined veteran. That's what makes Umbrellas such a problem.
---
He isn't planning on being in space very often.
---
You can just cloak your orca...
---
Torpedo deliveries, of course.
---
Yes, no racism, sexism, homophobism or any kind of bigotry are allowed in CODE. Unfortunately, many of the anti-gankers try and abuse this by using throwaway discord accounts to enter our public discord to spam racial slurs, but we usually eventually get someone to ban them and remove the messages.
---
So yeah we ban racism, but sometimes racism is found before our janitors can remove the comments.
---
if a cloaky camper doesn't kill ratters, they're not a threat
---
if they do, then they're a threat, and knowing they're there lets you know that danger exists
---
there are 5000 nullsec systems and maybe only 100 active pvpers at any given time, just go to another system and you're 100% safe again.
---
there is no excuse to have a loss.
---
Our corp doesn’t tolerate any of that, plus we try to avoid IRL politics, plenty of in game stuff to bitch and tinfoil about.
---
X if gay
---
&gt;alt-right
---
do people still use that buzzword unironically
---
Bah and they scream we pvp but yet they won’t put a 20 bn ship in PvP risk , the only way to make lots of isk to even be able to risk a lot of isk in PvP is trough crabbing , playing pve , unless mama credit card pays for your ship ... which I doubt most of us are that spoiled. 
---
I hate it how all the so called none carebears 🐻 act all big and mighty just to fly in space with there 50 mil ship and then criticize us cap pilots for putting real isk at risk ..... who,s the fucking carebear 🐻 now huh ?
---
You think I give a rats ass about your small gang ? 
---
No no sir every time I drop a 4 bn dread or a 22 bn super on content in space is me risking my isk that I worked hard to get from 0 sp just like you .
---
 I decide where and how to risk it , fuck you for thinking your not a bigger care bear 🐻.
---
Oh I’m pvp I fly a wolf around , look at all those care bears in the supers and titans.
---
Lol those guys that pvp in less then a 1bn ship are chicken shit imo and are bigger carebears then the crabbers that actual risk there isk in rorq or caps or shiny pve ships. 
---
But don’t mind the 50 mil wolf he ain’t no carebear lol .... lies and hypocrisy all over this forum.
---
These items are in the DB for a very long time and there is no official plan to actually add them to the game.
---
Eve is good.
---
&gt;These ships are oppressive. Dropping them, almost without exception, is an "I Win" button that only can be countered by the other side bringing more of them.
---
Would you say it's the old `N + 1` mechanics again? 
---
I believe it is, because the performance-gap between any two capital pilots is quite *small*. 
---
Why is it small?
---
1. Skill Injectors ensure that characters have IV/V in all relevant skills before sitting in the ship.
---
2. Not a great deal of useful variety in high-slot fitting. 
---
3. Not a great deal of variety in capital ships as a whole (more T1 frigates per race than capital ships per race). 
---
4. Jump and Warp mechanics very reliably put pilots of *every* ability at the same distance from the destination. 
---
5. An abundance of ISK for blingy modules.
---
I find the latest skins outrageous (specially some ones of the Triglavian ships). With the past skins one could like it or not but, in my opinion, they was well done. The new ones.. just have some lines or areas with 100% plain emission value, without any normal mapping in that zones or subtle variation ... Just put some bright things there and sell it.
---
*the moment you realized the guy had balls to fly a 2b nergal also has an ultra wide screen*
---
Someone was trying to do this, an Orca with two alts, then one day they tried to put up a tower in our obviously inhabited system, they claimed non-hostile intentions, we didn’t take chances though, caught the Orca, killed the tower, one scout alt got out.
---
This loot piñata looks amazing
---
It probably just doesn’t update skill times with temporary boosts.
---
GF, was one of the moroses, at one point we thought we wouldnt break you when TEST faxes arrived when you were in hull, turned it out we just managed it.
---
Tried that once and it didn't go too well, could probably do a better job now but then nobody would be there to rep NJED at eve meets. 
---
Might do it on an alt, though. There's an idea.
---
0SH-T, it's MY-W1V!
---
It wasn’t the sotiyo that was the issue, afaik. It was that they’re affiliated with NCPL
---
6: Because for some reason capitals are still practically immune to ewar
---
Joking that Hitler did nothing wrong automatically makes me a nazi now
---
A: Structure bash is a big NONO
---
B: You are talking about Wormholers which probably dont have hole to that region for the next timer without boring amount of rolling
---
Boring, downvoting
---
Realistically in EVE there's enough people that you'll come across some morons.
---
Some people judge others by the colour of their skin, some people think the world is flat. Ignorance is sadly a fact of life. 
---
Fortunately i'm in a position to start banning people whom try to give voice to their idiocy. So i have a tendency to publically shit on them from a great height when it comes up.
---
Who knows. I have a feeling this is going to be a longer term experiment. Something on this scale can’t happen every day, and they want all the data they can get. So they’ll need to wait and see like - how active people are, how many came back to stay, how many left, etc. and that data isn’t fast to collect.
---
&gt; There's dicks out there, sure, but blaming the entirety of TEST is irrational
---
On one hand, yeah thats obviously true. On the other it reminds me of that trailer for EVE where a player loses a frigate then dedicates himself to destroying that alliance by working up through the ranks and then stealing all their shit. Irrational, but very EVE
---
If your repertoire so limited you have to use a 'joke' from 20 years ago, then you are worse than a nazi.
---
That's because the little guy isn't going to undock his Rorqual when he can't see local. Duh.
---
Most people struggle with two accounts in a pvp situation, including me, let alone one of them being a titan underfire, what you were trying sounds like pro level shit. Good write up.
---
&gt; Goons did a great job securing tackle like really fast 
---
We found the spy!
---
So does local tell you if they are a threat or not? Your implication was that local always correctly tells you if something is a threat except when people pretend to not be a threat. How can that be perfect intel if someone can pretend to not be at threat.
---
Also source your numbers there because that definitely feels like bullshit.
---
I could never do this as I am an alpha clone. I *could* run around in a mammoth with a handful of rifters inside... almost the same.
---
Ironically I think I get ganked more in high sec than null
---
I wasn't even alive in 1999-2000 so IDK what jokes they told
---
This is why i keep checking out this subreddit :)
---
It is human nature, you got people all over the globe from all walks of life your going to have the human element. There's nothing any of us can do about it and no EvE won't go all 1984 because your feelings are hurt.
---
&gt;Also source your numbers there because that definitely feels like bullshit.
---
look at zkill
---
&gt;So does local tell you if they are a threat or not?
---
they are a threat if they're in system with you period, just go to another system
---
there is no excuse to ever lose a ship
---
Not risk adversity, those freighters should be dead doing what they did, only reason they aren't is because OP and friends are unbelievably cowardly.
---
^^^^it's a joke m8, cheaterhackers is a UALXB meme
---
IIRC from the previous event, yes. As alpha, you collect the alpha rewards. As soon as you upgrade to Omega, the Omega rewards 'unlock' (for the days you've claimed an alpha reward, and obviously for the rest of the event days), and you can claim them too.
---
sounds like you're an expert on the topic?
---
HTFU
---
Well there is always the bar under it, maybe hangout there for lunch with an eve t-shirt on ]; )
---
Use alt and log it out in deep spot
---
wtfk is an autopilot
---
Well you fooled me lol. Still a very fun read
---
So no actual source of a laughably low number.
---
And your point is you have to treat every afk cloaker as a permanent threat, which is what they want. Which makes local NOT perfect intelligence. These are people pretending to be a threat via the local mechanics. If it was 100% correct someone could not pretend.
---
Instant mjd on jump in.
---
its good to show a positive attitude, and that's the way moving forward,  
---
Though i must say I did get a good laugh going through your deleted threads

Maybe there is some hope for legacy members realizing they don't want to be goon pets, especially now that goons have permanent access to your JB network, which ruins the "we're not blue ingame" Meme that turned into a narrative
---
&gt;So no actual source of a laughably low number.
---
just look it up yourself, it was an estimate i made by looking at the active kills
---
if you doubt it, look at zkill and show me what you estimate
---
&gt;And your point is you have to treat every afk cloaker as a permanent threat
---
just move system lmfao
---
Botters are technically players, I suppose.
---
Having a no racism, sexism or slurs corp is definately possible. Just weed the shit out and you have a solid gaming community. Not saying its right, but by signing up to a major alliance, its almost a given which is pretty sad tbh.
---
Lol, like CCP cares about the lore anymore.
---
I like the idea though, would be a big boost to my old solo Griffin, Blackbird and Falcon fits
---
You are implying that people can fake being a threat via local but simultaneously saying local will always correctly tell you if someone is a threat. Do you not see the contradiction in this sentence.
---
Also don corleone has like 80 afks alts, so should we assume every single one of those is a threat. And if we should that rains havoc on your 100 number.
---
I like how everyone was having fun laughing at nullbears, but now that they reshipped into capital ships l33t PvPers start to complain about the lack of easy kills.
---
Plenty of people expected it to go this way.
---
That explains a lot.
---
I mean, I'm not sure how CCP changes caused this.  This idiot would have been caught a month ago in a pure krab fit.
---
Always keep in mind that you can't lose your ship. Anything you see on screen is property of CCP Games and they allow you to detroy their ships. It is more fun to detroy their ships piloted by other players ofc.
---
Did you know Karma Fleet is recruiting
---
This is a great point. Imo, the biggest issue with Eve, whats always held it back, is the notion of what Eve should be. Its like the original devs thought out a plan devised on a wet dream about a universe in which they could do whatever they wanted. A wild west in the future.
---
But they missed the fact that for one, the wild west wasnt the wild west, and two, people organised and made it evolve. So they created an inherently flawed game, dont get me wrong, I love Eve. But I absolutely get why people dont like it or want to put in the effort of start playing it. It tries too much to be cool and edgy by pandering to a playstyle that pretty much is griefing. And no one wants to be the idiot, the guy who tries out a game and gets fked because he didnt know the rules, since there is too much complexity and every loss hurts.
---
So Eve has remained a niche game and when the players tried to make it evolve by organisation... Well, here we are. The megaalliances that are getting shit for everything are the same one who did what CCP never could, they recruited newer players and gave them a home and an easy path to stay in the game. They held the retention numbers up, not CCP. And they made damn sure that you couldnt just roll in and do whatever you wanted. 
---
This is what people are butthurt about, the game evolving. 
---
And even tho I dont like any player leaving, atm, an entire segment, an entire playstyle of Eve could leave and I doubt the game would break. After all its evolved and tons of new players who like a more relaxed game has joined. If CCP really wants to improve retention they need to, once and for all, kill the notion of what Eve should be and instead focus on what Eve is.
---
Cry me a river, if you dont like how things are done just leave the alliance lol
---
Knuckles Cracked, Wife Beaten, Minorities abused. Yep, It's gamer time.

People don't like the truth, if they see it in chat they can report it. If they hear it in voice they can mute it.

Get back into eve and like drones. I get a vexor as it makes sense because muh drone boat. Put all my login event skill injectors into drones and gal. cruisers. Everything is going fine, and then I see theyre nerfing the hell out of VNI. So my cheerios are officially pissed in. So how often can I look forward to something being abused by other people ruining my fun?

* Never fly what you can't afford to lose.
---
* Don't fall into the trap of just doing one thing (like mining in Hi Sec) for an extended period of time when you're first starting. Try everything and figure out what it is you enjoy.
---
* Train your [Magic 14 skills](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/The_Magic_14) ASAP.
---
* Consider joining a new-player friendly corporation like Eve University to show you the ropes. EVE is infinitely better when interacting with other people (even moreso than other MMOs).
---
* If you play for a little while and decide you DO want to become a paying Omega clone, don't just buy a subscription. Take advantage of one of the various [DLC bundles](https://secure.eveonline.com/DLC/) to get more bang for your buck.
---
* When the in-game tutorials aren't clear about something, or if you get lost, YouTube and the Eve University wiki are your friend.
---
* The vast majority of players in EVE are friendly and willing to answer questions if you ask.
---
* Go through the entire new-player tutorial. You'll get a bunch of free stuff from it.
---
* After the tutorial missions, if you can afford it, the new player experience is infinitely better if you buy a little bit of PLEX and sell it on the market so you have some starting money to work with. You don't need a ton of ISK, but you start with practically nothing and having enough to buy some things right off the bat (like skill books and a couple basic ships) saves a ton of time in the beginning.
---
* Likewise, the $4.99 Starter Pack DLC that gives you 1M skill points will save you a lot of time in the early game waiting for basic skills to train. 1M skill points goes a long way in the very beginning.
---
If you chose not to ignore the 20% damage per level, it’s an incredible ship.
---
it was an amazing fight with a very cool backdrop of the B-R monument. Very glad i had just log in, barely had read my mails when the call for homedef came, jump in a boat and then shit start to get fun :)
---
Good AAR Mr.D :)
---
Mrhyde left on high note FeelsOkayMan
---
joining a corporation (it's like a guild) is the best thing you can do as a new player. the game is too hard to get into by yourself, but you'll learn very fast with knowledgeable people around you. be careful though, there are bad corps out there. if you don't like your corp, don't be afraid to simply leave. the most important thing you do is join a corp that is based outside of highsec. because the real content in eve is outside highsec, a lot of people quit because they stay in highsec. usually they convince themselves that they are 'not quite ready yet'. other than that, DONT do mining and you should be fine.

Are there any ships beside Gila that can do T4/T5 Abyssal sites effectively?
---
Why u suck tho? 😳
---
"as usual" still.. you fell for it

yes! long live the carebears and bots making triglavian ships a lot cheaper for us so we can blow up more of them :DDD
---
I'm the porpoise :)
---
HACs are absolutely efficient for this scenario (outnumbered home defense against 50 kikis) why? Because you don't feed them.
---
With 10 dudes:
---
6 eagles
---
3 booshers
---
1 covops frig
---
The eagles put out over 1500 dps to 140k+
---
A t2 fit eagle (before links, adc or heat) has over 150k ehp cap stable against kiki guns (50 Kiki's with meson can't even come close to alpha one eagle that isn't heating anything, hasn't popped adc and isn't getting links - assuming they can even get in range) 
---
The covops frig is hyperspatial quick align fit burning you warpins that you're staying aligned to.
---
You have 3 booshers for panic GTFO when you get outplayed, and links.
---
Plus you have ADC's you can pop for 16 seconds of 650k EHP.
---
Kiki fleet can't stay on grid with that, you eat the whole fleet in about 5 minutes if they do. You have tons of buffer to screw up as well. 
---
This is just one of a long list of possible ways to deal with being outnumbered without dropping caps.
---
 the eve uni wiki is a good resource for when you get stuck on something.
---
just remove ecm from the game and replace it with a mechanic that is not RNG cancer
---
Could you just copy this, paste it in the forums, and delete this comment?

Ok thank you big cool

They're just saying that shit for the shock factor. They dont believe any of it, they dont even understand it. It just makes them feel edgy and cool.

Not nearly as much as there should be

In my Corp adversity we maintain a politically correct, swear and racism free environment. We operate a rainbow  paper system which contains all the restricted words and topics and people are free to submit anything that offends them to the rainbow paper.

We already have a bunch of destroer-sized hulls: t1, command, interdictors, t3d

Why more? For what purpose?

you can fit up a rattle as an alpha that can do 99% of all pve easy. you are probably flying a garbage ship with a garbage fit
---
&gt;overdue changes
---
Well almost everyone I played with in black rise in 2015 quit due to getting rekt by snuff caps in FW space so FW cyno inhib would be cool yaya
---
I'm the standup XL cruise missiles :)
---
Yes I agree and do fit a med neut but what do you thin of tp ve te for larger guns vs smaller ships? I mainly use arty and autos.
---
that would be one of the least gay things said on tmocc comms ever
---
What I meant is, it's funny how you are the only one who feel the need to justify
---
It's not an unpopular opinion, but it is a silly opinion, but more in abstract, general terms.
---
Your argument 'it's a sandbox' can be applied to anything that may or may not be unbalanced in the game. It's a hollow argument
---
Except the rattlesnake would have warped out when he saw the dictor pilot hit local.
---
Yeah it'd be a huge shame to lose BPOs in a fight
---
So curious how did you have local if the was a blackout?
---
Where's that one doofus that was on here telling me that industrial ships are defenseless :D

---
couldn't they just, I don't know, use the sotiyo to build their cap there ? that would be high level trolling no ?  Instead of ruining everyones buy orders ~~ 
---
I suppose the next step is dropping a keepstar like the perimeter one ?
---
The best of the best need to be perfect shining examples of how great they are.
---
They should ban you from your corp and alliance just for using an autopilot. For posting the fact here... I don't know.
---
both are shit. TEs are nerfed and TPs are best used by ships with bonuses for it (and even then, long range webs may be better) - you also really shouldn't be comparing them, TEs are low slot modules and TPs are mid slot modules. compare a tracking computer to a target painter instead.
---
if you want to shoot small ships with medium arty then you want to kite them (20k+ away) and try to match your transversal so that you are able to hit them. https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Turret_mechanics - tracking computers can be decent too, but again, only for kiting, you don't want to use a TC on a brawling ship when you can use web + neuts.
---
you should not be using TPs, TCs or TEs on brawly t1 cruisers. it's a bad idea.
---
The porpoise, along with most of the other mining ships, actually gets very nice drone damage bonuses. It doesn't have a drone tracking bonus, unfortunately, but it can carry a few fits of lights so it doesn't really need it. If you fit it purely for combat, it's somewhat similar to fitting a Stratios. Fill the highs with neuts and do DPS with your drones,
---
For solo gank I have a cloaky Loki that fits 2 medium neuts, MWD, point and shield buffer.
---
It works great.
---
God yes, this too.
---
I love this. You can be anything you want, buddy.
---
That's a good idea, why not?
---
I worship your optimism ;)
---
Huh?
---
Are you suggesting that the blackout did this? I mean, probably made it easier, but this guy would have been catch-able outside of blackout too. The point is, he wasn't fully aware and didn't jump away as soon as something landed on grid with him. Easy to suggest that if he wasnt paying that much attention, local probably wouldnt have done much for this chap.
---
But hey, lets jump on the bandwagon of thinking blackout is the second coming and praise it eh?
---
As with everything in EVE, there's an asterisk to almost every statement you can make about the game. I'm going to point out the one to yours (sorry but I feel most people don't understand this, although I'm pretty sure you do).
---
The super umbrella doesn't matter anymore if your target is squishy enough for you to down it within an alliances response time, which usually is around 3-5 minutes. Granted, the number of ships in space that this applies to is steadily decreasing, but the blackout allows you to take your time, run the numbers, get people on and most importantly, strike at the right time. Compare this to before, when you had litterally seconds to make up your mind. Think about it, how many engagements have you been in before the blackout where you were denied a nice little fight because of timing issues?
---
Absolutely melts frigates
---
I've seen beaches where taking up that much space would be unacceptable
---
EVE's soundtrack is amazing. One of my fav songs is Steller Shadows: https://youtu.be/kS4tMpCbp1k

Question from a returning player.
---
What do you use these days wandering around WH space? Could you direct me to some decent fit I won't cry after losing? I have a (t)rusty astero, but was wandering if there's something new I should look at.
---
Thanks in advance.
---
This was always possible, even without blackout, it's just people are risk-averse, even when they call themselves PvP players.
---
No, T3 SHOULD be better than T2. It makes sense lore-wise, makes sense within what the T actually means. Putting them on par with pirate cruisers and below T2 is braindead.
---
Holy shit. I hope Ammar use decimal base numbers.
---
The chain of events which lead to the Nyx jumping in would have never taken place. 
---
1. Rattlesnake gets tackled due to no local
---
2. Spodumain Nyx jumps in to save Rattlesnake. 
---
Without blackout, the Rattlesnake probably never gets tackled in the first place, preventing the whole thing from happening. Ever since CCP introduced the Rorqual you saw this effect throughout nullsec, no more killable barges/exhumers meant no need to respond to players, hence the escalation chain of 'tackle procurer' 'response fleet forms to proactively defend miners/tries to save proc/gets revenge on PVPers that killed it' never happen, and less PVP is the result. 
---
You can also argue that the slower intel gathering of blackout, not seeing who was in local, their exact numbers etc. also probably contributed to the Nyx making a reckless decision.
---
The fights were good, but the music and spongebob cuts made it very hard to watch.
---
Poor hunter even Blackout wasn't able to save him.
---
would you go so far as to say that your values make you different
---
Great comment, but my post doesn't focus on the blackout. It focuses on the need for changes which actually address the problem of supercap and rorq proliferation.
---
As for the offer, CCP always has some kind of offer in summer to try to keep people subbed because it's when most people lapse their subs traditionally to go partake in real life.
---
Looks like he did it on porpoise.
---
Have you seen me complaining?
---
God that would be so OP.
---
Your question about target painters says that you do not yet understand fundamentally how the turret damage formula works.  In fact, of you are solo a 50% tracking bonus or making your enemies signature radius larger by 50% has the same effect, provided stacking penalties are not a factor.
---
Now, with the rupture, try web, scram, AB, and cap booster. Fit a medium neut.  Use dual reps. The medium neut is key here in shutting down propulsion modules to get better hits. Also, fly away from frigates with AB overheated.  That way, you create the smallest angular velocity to the frigs. If you are in FW and are running mediums, stay inside the medium about 30km away from the warp in. Any backup that is coming has to burn an additional 30km to get to you, letting you have more time with the first target.  You want to handle guys one at a time if possible.  Hope that helps.

I think you dropped this: \\
---
I know that you have a very selective perception but you did see the machariel fleet that just waited for us to untether while ignoring you right? What would have happend if we just attacked blindly? We´d lost a ton of battelships without achieving anything and just been feeding DHSJ.

There was no point in attacking you whith DHSJJ basicly protecting you.
---

---
I said it today alread,y somewhere else.

Drones!
---
Lazors!
---
E-war!
---
Just tracking disrupt one or two (or anti-missile) and make sure your drones are busy gnawing on the annoying ones. They won't hit you and die to your drones fast. :)
---
Doesn't work, if there's a 20 Jackday fleet though, but you can take on some frigates.
---
TD on the highest threat, which is usually the Assault Frigate. Lazors on it to make him feel special and sick your drones to the fragile stuff like Interceptors. The AF won't hit you and the fragild stuff will die soon. Make sure you have a large buffer tank or active reps.
---
Now get a buddy and another Arbitrator and let chaos descent upon your enemy.

Not dabbing -&gt; Dabbing ironically -&gt; just dabbing
---
No, its a stupid change, and the lack of a salvage sink will kill salvage prices. Making that beatiful region of stain absolutely worthless.
---
Example?
---
yes thats the point - ships can be fit to defend themselves instead of just being max krab and then whining that it's "defenseless".
---
So drink a lot of beer and entosis all over them.
---
That was a really good video, awesome!
---
Awww ye Minmatar supremacy &lt;3
---
Even worse its when you don't go for a procurer or skiff ball in a faction or assault frigate and they talk trash. its like bro, ur mining barge has battleship tank &amp; cruiser DPS, and you have a rorqual on grid
---
Blackout is aimed at botters, instant intel and afk isk printing. I thought that has become clear by now?
---
I did this around 2012-2013 when I was burned out, did it continuously for around a year. It was the same time my friends group also burned out (we lived and pvped together in a WH/C6), but I still felt like playing the game but doing something else. I'd move around to lowsec and npc null, to PvP with my subcaps, mine, and rat. I'd park up in a lowsec constellation and do some frigate PvP for like a month, then move somewhere else, do some more PvP against new faces, etc. It is really fun and I recommend it to anyone that can fly them, and especially if you are a long time player, a single carrier loss  shouldn't be a big deal ISK wise. It was just fun being able to engage with many activities in EVE, like mining and industry, among lowsec PvP, and of course it's not some sort of perfect  "ISK efficiency" with mining and industry, but I hate playing games to be perfectly efficient, it was just fun being at least \*self-sufficient\*.

What could possibly go wrong in FW with a scram web frig on warp in with a destroyer that sits at 20k and slaps you for 5000 hp?

I absolutely love these.

---
I have a sec status below -5.0. Currently I'm exploring and will eventually want to travel back through hi sec to trade. Will this be safe in a frigate? How fast will the police respond?
---
You clearly didn't read my post. The sandbox has been *shaped* by CCP deciding how it's supposed to work.
---
&gt;If anything, it should be EASIER to farm in relative peace without having your gameplay experience ruined by random tards cruising around and hoping to luck their way into a free killmail
---
I understand that you clearly want Eve to be Hello Kitty Online, but that's not the way it was designed and clearly isn't doing an awful lot for online numbers as the game continues its slide from the highs of 50,000 a day (all paying subs) to 25,000 including free to play.
---
&gt;If you want more pvp action, then suggest and support ideas that promote balanced and consentual pvp - this kind of action creates fun for all involved, without driving people away from the game (battlegrounds, anyone?).
---
We had one of those; it was called r32/64 timers and it drove massive multi-way battles to take control of the moons. Your side cried about them because they didn't take active krabbing, and now we have a dead lowsec with a bunch of moons that no one wants.
---
&gt;Imbalanced and non-consentual pvp definitely have their places, especially in EVE, but they're currently choking virtually any other means of playing the game and forcing players into giant blue blobs in order to mitigate them. Super umbrellas are a symptom, not the problem, and if you "fix" them you only make the underlying problem worse.
---
Supercapital umbrellas and rorqual proliferation forces giant blue blobs more than anything else in the game. If you want to mine, you have to do it under an umbrella. If you want an umbrella, you have to mine (ideally in Rorquals). There is zero incentive for a Rorqual miner to stay in any alliance which doesn't have an umbrella.
---
THIS IS EVE! well done
---
I like it. Find an exception and claim it as the rule.
---
I saw a dog with a hat. All dogs always wear hats.
---
Totally works. Especially for cowards who use a cloak for a crutch.
---
This would be a viable argument if concurrent logins hadn't been in freefall since 2014. It's exactly what Eve has become which has killed player retention, and what Eve 'should be' which pulls in new players.
---
the point is, you're free to choose how you want to fit your ship. if you want to fit max isk then you accept max risk. its almost like that's a core principle of EVE.
---
They have anchored bubbles on all the gates leading into this system. Bubbles prevent a ship from warping unless it is interdiction nullified (cloaky tech 3/interceptor etc). When you jump into this system to be able to warp you have to burn out of the bubbles or mjd. This is made harder by the fact that they have ships on the gates to catch you. The system actually has bubbles on all the gates and citadels so warping to them will cause you to land in them. Some are drag bubbles and some are at 0. Drag bubbles are set up in line with another object at a distance away from a gate for example and so warping to that gate will cause you to get dragged into the bubble. This is a great way to catch ships when camping a system
---
bro small ecm ships like griffin kitsune which have nice agility and small align time are still very viable but ships which are less agile like falcon , rook and widow are just useless
---
It's just a worse Comet...
---
On the other side you can't deny players who joined the game later chance to even up on what they can coubter vets more or less. Being able to smash newbros like flies because they could never catch up with the old PL and NC was not fun and healthy for the game either. Especially in the 0 fatigue era where you could project supercaps power indefinitely, everywhere on the map.
---
To me the current solution would be to make is, so that you can't dock supers again, go back to space coffins to prevent lagre groups piling up supers like they are fucking frigates. This would bring back what supers used to be - rare, less expendable and requiring skill to use.
---
that was the point of post , caldari has few ships which are like useless in 95% of situations and being a caldari main , it saddens me
---
Oh, you no longer lead PH ?
---
My best guess (and that's all anyone has) is that after the Rorqual changes, people would have run the numbers about how much ISK they could make, and there would have immediately been a market on the Bazaar for pre-trained Rorqual characters, similar to the market that used to exist where people just shat out dread alts with perfect skills for sale on the Bazaar.
---
Cue a bunch of people seeking money firing up alt accounts or MCTC, remapping, buying implants, and starting the Rorq skill train. About six months later the Bazaar would be inundated with Rorq alts.
---
Rorqs are better compared to carriers/dreads than to supers/titans because they could always be traded in stations. They also don't have a horrific training period to use effectively.
---
Rorquals should have stayed what they are - support, boosting ship, hut on grid, providing bigger bonuses to exhumers. Instead, the fools who made Fozziesov and citadels possible made the rorqual the main mining ship, rendering everything else useless for that task.

Replace the ancil and web with two large shield extender II if you prefer a buffer tank. Don't forget nanite repair paste, and to overheat as needed but not burn anything out. If a drone starts taking damage pull it back in and launch a fresh one.
---
thats a loki my man!
---
i'm not gobbins
---
You got wooshd pretty hard here mate, that's scalding pass. Its there to raise adms after stealing an ihub. This isn't your standard null krab porpoise chest beating when you come to him. Its the porpoise behind enemy lines. The eve equivalent of Porpoise Team Six.
---
black bird griffins and kitsune is no issue , the issue starts at falcon , the investment vs the result of ecm for these are bad. to the point that its better to bring a blackbird then falcon . also falcon rook widow have bad align time and are less agile to the point that a tackle ship can clear the distance.
---
Capitals should be fleet support ships, you 100% should need the help of smaller ships to track and kill frigates. There are these items in the game called stasis webifiers, they should be required for a carrier to be able to nuke an interceptor. 
---
I am sure you're in a large corp/alliance, surely one of your fellow alliance mates can bring a web bonused ship, to help you nuke the tackle.
---
EVE has never been about 1 class of ship dominating every other class, which is what it has become
---
thats was the point , we need to make more ships viable for game , above the cruiser level
---
The symphony performance is something I was really glad to be at.
---
There is no way you should have died there.  If the jackdaw was the issue you should have loaded meson and tracked it easily. Or if it was out of range just nuet out the porpoise or simply killing it. Tbh seems like bad piloting
---
you let krabs live rent free in your mind, which ironically you told olmeca a few months ago
---
It depends on your skills with TPs.
---
The increase in signature size from TP has the same exact effect as the increase in tracking speed from your tracking computer/enhancer.
---
But as people said use a web instead.
---
Depends.

---
&gt; I would have assumed that null sec generated more purchases
---
High sec still dominates total population base and logically that follows in pure subscription/dollar terms. Null comes close, and has a higher retention percentage vs high sec. So the logical path forward is to push high sec players into that 'end game'. Null battles also has strong word of mouth potential. You won't hear much about hsec or WH battles since in dollar terms they don't grab media headlines, but you will hear news about large null battles in mainstream media. It lures new players into the game -- large wars got me into the game as an example, and null kept me playing.
---
This is the coolest thing I've seen on reddit
---
That's StratOp level ;)
---
Astero is still solid and more or less the go-to exploration ship, assuming you're not an alpha

It does, but sharing skill links is a skakey basis for an argument...

I would suspect CCP is able to see how long Players are logged in over the course of the day.

Or how much interaction is going on within a given amount of Time.

did you know you can have these fights every day if your fc doesnt pussy out of a figh where he can loose more than 0 ships
---
Blackout is nice for BB 😁
---
How and where do you find the 3D Model for the ships? Thingiverse?
---
Have a nice day
---
Origamifreak
---
Tankiest frigate in the game tbh
---
Really nice man :)
---
I love the concept and may even try it out, but have to think how to handle loot since you don't have space for it and are bound to get it out in the hauler from where you gathered it rather than jumping to better connections to trade hubs =/
---
Online numbers are down 20% plex price is getting lower each day.        
---
Omega account number for sure took at least the same hit.          
---
CCP is trying to prevent even more people unsubing before this event ends.           
---
Is your finance team happy with the latest expansion /u/ccp_falcon  ?               
---
Observatory arrays will not recover all those lost subs, reinstating local will bring much more people back.          
---
Declaring no more blackouts will probably bring almost all people back.
---
I have it from a good source that CCP is doing this to fuck with u/stainguy and make him shitpost a bunch wondering about it
---
Yup. For example the guys you linked there have hilarious fits, and 20% k/d ratios, I linked two “cookie cutter” comet fits with pilots that seem 50/50, which is about average in FW plex pvp. 
---
Another factor is the perceived “threat level” of GNIs, or the skill / experience of the pilots in their ship etc. 
---
Btw bud I’m not trying to argue with you, just discuss opinions on a ship ) I love it to pieces, and think the nerf made it more viable for my specific wants, not saying I’m right! And I lost GNIs to comets plenty I’m sure.
---
If another ship activates a stasis web on you, it will get you into warp much easier. Has to be timed right but it can help you escape.
---
If you do not have an alt for this, you can sometimes get other players to help you. You need to first duel them (to make it legal for them to web you) and then start a warpout. They'll hit the stasis web when you area around 40% speed and you should instantly drop into warp.
---
My cat was dead, now it is alive. Thanks blackout!
---
I too get is scram/web range for no reason
---
wow nice going to look into it, thx!
---
I do something similar but my cyno alt then sits in my Nyx while I use other ships. Safely logged out
---
Without the blackout, that first rattlesnake they caught probably would've docked up while their scouts were still 3 jumps away
---
And I'm not saying it's a useless ship, but it was more strongly impacted by the ECM need than any other ship and they haven't done anything really to buff it... And it deserves a buff...
---
Did someone say the N word?
---
Agree with you there, ECM in general needs another tweak. Poor widow as well. I guess I kinda derailed this thread :) my bad
---
It's the bots and krabs that are gone, nothing of any value.
---
PLEX prices are going down but the volume of PLEX sold stays roughly the same. That means more people are buying PLEX for $$$ and less ppl krab isk to buy PLEX. The demand for PLEX might be slightly lower too as people no longer need 5 krab alts to stay competitive and they can just focus on using 1-2 characters for pvp. Those krab alts weren't PLEX'ed with irl money.
---
Overall the game is doing much better.
---
I really thought that picture said “sold”
---
of cause you can blame an alliance for some individuals but the story itself is rly fucked and I see why he would be angry then. Not so much at the alliance but at least at the corp or something and if you need to decide for a side might as well go witht he side where you know you are fighting against at least some guys you hate :D
---
Someone can't pronounce Gila. It's not like it's not named after a river, an enimal, a town and such....
---
not saying it was unfair at all! :)
---
Train dictor alts
---
the fact I wasnt able to move at the start due to doomsday helped them for sure :D
---
Each previous expansions increased online numbers, this one is the first one that lead to instant and significant drop.
---
I would love to see carriers or supers changed that way so you could dock and build things inside
---
I think the kool-aid has rotted your spod brain sir
---
Yes, the black out is the reason why the nyx died.
---
[You know it](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77906955/), buddy!
---
Rattle snake would have warped out when hostilities were 2 jumps out
---
when I started playing I decided that I am willing to pay the subscription of my account and when I entered cap level stuff I discussed with myself I am willing to pay up to 3 omegas. At the same time I set 3 Omegas as a hard boundary for myself and I never invested anything beyond that. I could pull a credit card but when I do so I wouldnt feel the same adrenalin when I drop my next titan...
---
Except no frigs will want to fight you.
---
it was a close call! I underestimated the speed at which it would drop through armor and hull tabbed to another toon at like 10% shield and when I tabbed back it was already hitting structure.
---
That's true!
---
I think i’ve experienced the same bug but a bit different. It has happened multiple times now but fortunately I haven’t been caught when it happened.
---
Sometimes when I jump through a gate my entire screen goes black. Its a soft lock for sure as i can still hear everything, i don’t think theres any way to fix it.
---
Hotkeys do not work either (as far as I know) so the only way to fix it is by restarting my client. This bug is really annoying. Especially when you’re flying 2B loki’s in deep hostile space.
---
I had to write the pings to the coalition while docking and deathcloning 2 Fax toons back to L-5, while talking to the subcap FC, while talking to the other guys that dropped we needed to get another supercarrier save as well and I was in a random discord conversation that had no push to talk active I am so sry for the people there they heard me talking about non eve stuff and then suddenly DREADS ON GRID and then me talking in 2 different languages in 3 different comms :D They must have been utterly scared xD
---
Yeah cause sth like 5k vni bots stopped logging in.
---
Look at regions like Paragon Soul, Detorid, Feythabolis, Branch, Scalding Pass, or the entire drone lands. Before the blackout every second system there had a bunch of 0,001 sec reaction time VNIs that kept krabbing 24/7. Now those regions are more or less empty.
---
Even that the online numbers might be lower than before, we have less bots and less alts online and more real people playing and enjoying the game.
---
It's the revenue that matters for CCP and I'm sure that's what they are measuring during this test and not the amount of RMT related bots that pumps up daily online numbers. If they keep up with doing good changes like the blackout, that make the game more dangerous and more pvp oriented, their revenue will just keep increasing.
---
Stabber with arty? But it only has the powergrid of a lemon
---
Give me your ig name and I'll give you the fit.
---
thx so much for coming you subcap guys were on point! Killed alot of the bubblers on grid and the Basilisks repaired my titan probably for more shield than my late Fax toons! :D
---
See, I would argue otherwise.
---
We can make kills like these amazing, but we marginalize it because the monetary value has changed over time. Sure, there are a dime a dozen of them in each major group, but that doesn't take away that it was a fantastic fight, wonderful content and many people had a fun time together.
---
I truly believe, if we attach that hype again to kills, that we can actually make it praiseworthy.
---
The big questions is: Which alliance is he from? :D
---
"Oh look the hostiles bring a roaming kiting bullshit gang that's really hard to engage by any means, making it very low-risk" - Roamers.  
---
"Oh look, we tried fleets but let's see if they want to fight something actually decent"  - Capital pilot.
---
it's a lot of PVP'rs too, people who cant realistically fund their shit half ass ratting to fund their PVP those who like actual fleet fights etc, only people to benefit from this is gankers and super cap umbrellas
---
They killed a horde hel.
---
goons can use our JB? I wasnt even aware :D The threads were not made by me just to clear about that I wanted to put up my own oppinion against them because I feel you really cant blame anyone for taking the opportunity to kill a titan!
---
I have never seen a need to ban it, maby not hang around assholes?
---
The inherent risk is with all ships, not just a t3c. The problem is many are used to using a cloak and nullification to pick and choose what engagements to participate in. That broken mechanic has conditioned people that risk is something they get to choose when to mediate rather than a real constant. Where the risk was to undock, it is whether to decloak for these folks.
---
Two people play chess, player "A" has invisible pieces you can only see for the short time you pieces are eliminated. Player "B" says how can he play. Player "A" responds: I put my pieces at risk just as you do, you can see them sometimes. They could be where I last played them. My chess set cost more it deserves an advantage. Adapt or die. Player "A" is amazed those carebears stop playing with him and his pieces.
---
It's got an 1,000,000 smb... Go for it! With HAW and a bit of liquid courage you can take your caravan and go after large vulnerable groups that you come across while roaming. Revenant would be my choice if I had to pick.
---
I think it is a question of viewpoint. To me and to alot of our guys that were there it is so much more of a memory and fun than any we jump 200 titans against 300 titans and trade DDs loss could have been. Its not as crazy as the first titans that died in the game but judging by my adrenaline level a day to remember for me for sure :D
---
If player logins was the ONLY data they were measuring- sure.
---
But the thought that daily logins are what they're actually tracking is silly, especially when the numbers are going to significantly be altered from bots and masse multiboxers not logging in, and meme 'walkout' protests.
---
They weren't going to measure those statistics anyway.
---
the flair says adversity but the brain says goonswarm
---
Typical CCP. Watch the issue develop over several years. Then get in a hurry to "fix it" suddenly. CCP movinv at a glacial pace, until it falls off into the ocean and ooops. Start over.
---
How the hell can you have had the most boring week? have you not participated in the fun fights vs WinterCo?  
---
the multitude of daily roams, blops and other kinds of fleets into WinterCo space?  
---
not to mention the multitude of Roams and drops made possible with the blackout?  
---
honestly if you had a boring week then i feel you ither did that to yourself or i feel sorry for evictus pilots.
---
If that 20% was botters, sure, we are all happy.
---
That's an up vote just because it's not about the Blackout
---
UR-W1V does?
---
If I had a titan to yolo in a region I d try and have eyes on dreadcaches in range. Although with the blackout they could be anywhere. Your mistake was assuming a goon dread would fly there alone.
---
heart rate: 200? xD
---
Well said shame the op didn’t specify action or comments and instead left it up to the readers interpretation
---
This guy W1Vs. :)
---
And thats why you have the Rorq, a ship that can do everything. But Im fairly certain you dont like that one do you?
---
And its a bit strange that you are comparing a PvP ship, which this was after being fitted purposely for that purpose, with a PvE ship.
---
I've never seen that. I've seen some people that should have a barricade around them while having on a bikini. I really don't need to see you in a bikini while 9 months pregnant or while weighing 300 pounds.
---
Using boosh doctrine makes it much more complicated. You didn't account for any logi, and you assumed perfect execution. If kikis had more boosher, they would have control over distance, which would mean the end for HACs. Also, I highly doubt that eagles would have perfect application against kikis in any situation when conditions would be other than perfect. 
---
Compare it to using capitals. 10 caps would push enemy of field faster. HAW Revelations/ some carriers, maybe 2 faxes. They are less dependent on each other, and they can shred through most things rather easily. Only thing that FC wound have to to do would be calling targets. And if situation goes south, you can easily escalate with even bigger stuff.
---
Lmao why did this get down voted
---
so much this  
---
the nyx pilot had no intel on our actual fleet size, and warped in just to clear the one sabre and ceptor holding tackle
---
Someone sent me a pic of a beacn in Vietnam just yesterday. No room to even set down. Didn't look enjoyable at all.
---
Are you really that retarded? 
---
1. You don't need to log in to claim your reward, only open the client
---
2. They won't look at the daily log in numbers when measuring the success of the blackout. There are lots of other metrics to look at, how long people stay logged in is one, pvp is another. I'll take 5000 guys roaming around instead of 30k krabs any day.
---
No, I'm not giving any1 props for flying high-grade snakes.
---
Covops destroyer when?
---
yes, we're happy.
---
Who cares about all the unsubbed krab alts
---
Well, thats PvP knowledge right there.
---
Porpoises get confused for Rorquals.
---
You forgot toaster gender check your spaceship privilege
---
Incursions give you 100m+ per hour totally risk free. there is no probablem funding your pvp as long as you're not a retard
---
Y
---
To be fair, if the changes stop here it will only reinforce the blocks, the blackout is a glorious thing but it needs to be followed up with ratting anomaly spawn rate nerfs, and super changes.
---
Nullblock space need more sources for drama, so fewer ratting sites that take longer to complete seems to me like a good change to make next.
---
im sorry can you help me find in the ship attributes where it specifies if a ship is a pvp or pve ship?
---
Most people with low security status use an alt to trade im hisec.
---
Yeah I meant solo accounting but that's definitely true.  With the blackout it's now a lot more plausible in null too
---
&gt;Are you really that retarded?           
---
If you login, you login.            
---
A lot of "free" sp will more likely keep you omega just so you can claim them.        
---
Even more free SP will do the same (the 2nd event)             
---
Went to alpha , again both events will keep you logging in.
---
any sugestions the Komodo seems to be over 400b with BPC and build costs, I want to stay shield for obvious reasons and I love missile and my skills are geared towards that as well.
---
Then run away shouting "Made you form!"
---
Ye no worries. Its in the fit mate. See, you can fit ships any way you like.
---
Here at code we gank week old miner and try to scam them out of the only money they might or not have we do good
---
I want to acquire a C6 farmhole, but I'm essentially going to be solo (with multiple alts), living out of an Astrahus. How likely am I to get evicted? Are there any C6 that are less in demand or that are less likely to be evicted?
---
is that 2b with bulkheads in lows or not?

PVE that takes up shit loads of attention isnt very good for folks who are mostly just interested in getting into fights, why bother going to fleet up with a bunch of krabs who take themselves far too seriously to shoot some rats when you could vaguely pay attention to a VNI on the other screen whilst pvping and having a target out in space for people to shoot? or a rorqual etc. instead now its stop PVPing pay sole attention to krabbing and have your cyno ready to drop the super fleet on anyone that comes near you. its pretty shit.

They dropped on PanFam the other week, with TEST waiting in a nearby system, so I'm not sure what you're talking about?
---
They didn't nab the kill due to a quick response, but they did drop on PanFam, so don't really know what to tell you....
---
&gt; only people to benefit from this is gankers and super cap umbrellas
---
Its funny how even in Delve I found more good fights than having supers or titans dumped on me since the blackout started. Its like all of the super risk averse krabs decided to not log in, and the only dudes that go out and krab are those that are willing to defend themselves/hunt the hunters/set up traps/etc.
---
so kinda like you're free to choose how you want to fit your ship, i.e. if you want to fit it max isk then you accept max risk?
---
We had a lot of moons and because of blackout our miner numbers werent as high as before. So more time needed for the guys left to suck them dry, but they kinda need to be mined because the taxes are important for the corporations. And as I was usually the person organising the rorqs I mainly did so for about 8h a day. Not bad isk but not the most entertaining gameplay. The roams I went with werent that crazy I know Gideon did some amazing retri roams but they were at like 2-6 in the morning my time mostly.
---
ccp wants you to pau syb with money instead of buying plex, so they kill the isk making and give reason to plex
---
Nope. The Intel doesn't need to be made more perfect.
---
Funny how since the blackout all the small gang brawls i've gotten in and around delve has disappeared and all there is now is empty systems or a cyno. this change has knocked out a lot of real people who did stuff, and gotten rid of tools there were to chase a gang outside of the umbrella so that we could have a straight up brawl. I'm not saying there arent any positives to the no local thing, but its far outweighed by the sheer amount of play styles it shits on
---
Did you have a cloak on your orca?  Also did you run mining drones on it or store a mining ship inside?
---
we had eyes on our war enemies and other places we were aware dreads might be. To be honest I didnt rly think about goons they have been in the region so rarely and literally never dropped a cap here for like at least a year. I didnt rly have them on my list. First dread should have been a large red flag.

All EVE ever needed was to be dangerous.

If it doesn’t feel like you’re juggling nitroglycerin and burning chainsaws while being shot at in a mine field, you’re not doing it right.

Too many people with risk aversion ruins this game. It’s not designed to appeal to everyone, it shouldn’t try to.

sounds about right :)

Offering sp in the middle of summer will output how many dedicated players can login at the lowest interest point during the year. As soon as the sp rewards stop a gradient will show how many could be driven to login via incentives. BDO offered a wide range of login incentives. Look for peak time login incentive, double sp boosters that last 1 hr or 50% sp boosters that last two hours every day; if they copy BDO.
---
Haha
---
Out of curiosity can you link me to some examples of small gang brawls you've gotten in to before the blackout?
---
&gt;and gotten rid of tools there were to chase a gang outside of the umbrella so that we could have a straight up brawl.
---
This reads "I lost my NEAR2 and perfect intel, and I have no idea how to drop on a roaming gang by myself, so I decided to dock up instead"
---
nothing is stopping you from still having that VNI on the other screen, its not like you actually cared if it died before. The whole point of VNI ratting is that it pays for it self quickly so you can just leave it to itself. Blackout isn't stopping this, unless you relied on bots reading local.
---
I don't mind protecting oneself from wind. "Claiming" part of the land bothers me yet... I'm a father of two (one is just 11 days old), I understand you ;)
---
You haven't fought good frig pilots if you killed them with drones or rapid heavies. Drones, you can outrun and HAMs won't do much damage if you go fast enough. Turrets similarly won't hit if the frig pilot keeps his transversal high. You probably have never fought a frigate who manually piloted his ship. Webs are pretty much the only valid counter that you mention, but not all BS fit them.
---
Unironically yes. It normalizes anti-semitism. This ain't the forum for that discussion though. "Its just a meme lol" is just a cover up for someone knowing their behavior is deplorable.

/remind me 420 days
---
Don't go there yet go to EVE Uni for a month or two to familiarize with the game and make great friends!
---
I don't like dropping caps on things, its not very engaging to me in the slightest, imho i'd trade having local back in exchange for supercapitals being removed from the game.   
---
we had stuff like this  [https://zkillboard.com/br/110423/](https://zkillboard.com/br/110423/)  where we would see a gang come through a system and start chasing them, as you could see 2 of us being in fat battleships, we had to chase them all the way from southern delve gate to gate through to period basis watching the local number go down as we entered the next system allowing us to make educated guesses on where they were going next this went on until we managed to get them stuck in a dead end pocket and then camped them till they tried to make a run for it, we managed to have a really fun fight there and it was the kind of thing that at the very least the group i play with enjoy, no caps were involved because I like having some level of risk to my fighting its what makes it exciting.  
---
since the blackout i havent been able to chase things like that anymore, the only action ive managed to get since is when ive gone to low sec to try to bait some content and small fleet on small fleet action. Ganking is kinda fun in small doses and once you actually find something then sure its kind of easier but imho its too easy now when its outside of an umbrella because theres not much counter play or risk to it anymore.   
---
the change has also killed off a fairly large amount of the social aspect we had before, now everyones bunched  into the super caps standing fleet comms where its endless sperg from one group and no ones really branching off to do their own thing, it's boring and feels empty and alone compared to what we have had. a lot of the dudes that ran with me doing the smaller gang stuff to supplement it instead of using subcaps like they used to are now injecting into supers and shit and just joining in on the umbrella rather than looking for the fun fights anymore. it definitly feels outweighed in the super cap and gankers favour.
---
I think that CCP has realised that if they don't accept the loss of subbed bot accounts, they will kill the game.
---
That doesnt mean much tho. I mean, you cant really know, like really really know, why people leave. Things change, the playerbase got older and so on. Shit changes, put simply. 
---
And my argument above is that its never gone that way fully. There are tons of things that need to be fixed in HS before we can even start to say that the game has changed. War decs for instance, cheap griefing and so on. You know these things honestly, I dont need to recite the list.
---
Fact is, Eve has stayed to the same principle ever since it got introduced, sure it might have become softer but its still the same ideology. And its not working. One could argue it really never did.
---
Am I saying that I belive in Rorquals or super umbrellas? No, those things are shit. Should people be allowed to use superiour force to shut down aggression? Fk ye.
---
But the game needs to evolve. It needs to mature. Needs to be a shitton more streamlined and lots of complexity needs to go. Otherwise it will remain a niche game and honestly, me and you would never have been talking about this if the game had 30k more logins/day.
---
Hi Redline
---
you're looking at it from a very narrow biased view bud, games not gonna last if you narrow it down to just a couple of playstyles. I don't pve at all and it is eating a lot into the environment that i play in as a pvp player. try to put yourself into other peoples shoes and think about the pros and cons from each of their perspectives.
---
scraping tools already exist
---
So all ships are one now right? Everything has to be baittanked? And according to your way of thinking?
---
Listen dude, for every purpose there is a tool. Would you use a hammer to screw? If you cant get something simple as that then I honestly dont know what to say.
---
I come from a land down under
---
What are you talking about? He just pulled some solid data numbers fresh out of his ass.
---
And honestly, when you finally have a ship that can do all things then you nonstop fking bitch about it. So its really no win with you guys.
---
looks like a nice fight was had. I looked thru your killboard and it seems like you've had a few smaller squabbles against invaders since the blackout (plus killing some fellow goons but i guess those were tank checks or memes or something?)
---
&gt;the change has also killed off a fairly large amount of the social aspect we had before, now everyones bunched into the super caps standing fleet comms where its endless sperg from one group and no ones really branching off to do their own thing, it's boring and feels empty and alone compared to what we have had.
---
So I dont know what comms you partake in, but the Romanians, Spaniards, and others that live around NPC Delve seem to not have this problem. Perhaps this is a personal issue that can be resolved by sticking to corp comms or find an empty channel with friends? IDK...
---
&gt;it definitly feels outweighed in the super cap and gankers favour.
---
I'll give you this, theres a lot more cloaky, ganky T3Cs afoot than before but they are fairly easy to kill if you bait and trap them. Worst case you get blops dropped on your Dominix but hey you looked at what fast freddie vonhole does and suddenly you get a 1.5b tick at someone else's expense.
---
Its almost as if a major mining entity stopped mining and deployed to war somewhere... wierd.
---
*sigh* this conversation is over, suitonia was right
---
Oh Hai will

Agreed in most cases but there’s some ships that just need reworks.
---
Then do it yourself

This one OP
---
Let's say I'm running sites with a Rattlesnake in a C3 WH. I suddenly get ganked and tackled. What ship can I use on my alt that will get my main out of trouble and help him escape?
---
Triglavian Blops first!
---
Don't play on your own, find a good newbie friendly corporation and make friends.  MMOs are intended to be social, you can play solo but by doing that miss out on a lot.  Pandemic Horde, Brave Newbies, Karma Fleet and Brand Newbros are all examples of corps/alliances out in null sec aim to attract and help new player.  I'd personally recommend Eve University based on experience though.  They have campuses across Hi, low and null sec as well as an active wormhole group and a dedicated mining campus.  It gives you chance to try pretty much everything to see what you like and have fun doing it.  Try and avoid getting sucked in permanently though, it's a great place to start but there's much more to eve.
---
Osprey Navy is basically idiot proof. 
---
Yesterday brace jumped 7 frigates into our home system from null to kill one of our confessors. I warped @ 20 before they jumped in, propped away while fragging kiki’s. I ended up getting 4 of them and using half my tank before the rest of our fleet landed and anyone not webbed bailed. 
---
TL;dr osprey navy issue is caracals ugly looking but pretty cool cousin
---
That's why I can't any corp that fits me. None of them have enough rules!
---
Never not take a fight. Also a reason why I like to fly nano most of the time. I can take every fight :)
---
create a neutral alt to haul your stuff. It's not the police the issue, but other players will shoot you down
---
from uniwiki: 
---
Once your security status drops to -5.0 or below (technically -4.95) you become an ColorTag-SkullOrange9.gif outlaw, also commonly referred to as "perma flashy".
---
It means anyone can attack you at any time without CONCORD interfering, even in high security space. It also means that assisting you would be a suspect offense, even for your own corporation members. That means anyone who needs to assist you would have to turn their safeties partially off to assist (yellow safeties), and in the process temporarily become a suspect for fifteen minutes.
---
I shoot blues because its fun :p not in the awoxing way more of a im bored wanna shoot each other? 
---
as for my killboard i think since the actual blackout started there is literally just that one hurricane kill and that was in low sec after having to bash a structure to get a response fleet, we fed bad on the whole but it was fun at least till they dropped faxes to save their canes. 
---
as for the comms, we went from a pretty full shared comms between my corp and another corp thats actually pretty large, the numbers went from being very high pretty much being able to run a decent 30-40 man fleet out of to being maybe 8 people logged in at any time and of those half the time they're afk, the rest of the guys ended up going to the standing comms and sit in their supers all day now waiting for something to drop on. 
---
as for the last bit personally I dont PvE at all, it's far too boring for me, but yeah basically it's turned from being something we can semi reliably do something about and actively restrain ourselves from hitting the I win button to something we have to work exponentially harder at to the point that if something gets tackled we don't want them having a chance to get out by that point so we light that cyno, that play style just isn't engaging to me so I struggle to find a reason to really log in at this point.
---
I'm curious what your thoughts are to what I said in the previous comment about how I would trade super capitals for having local back, do you not think that would open up more content without essentially alienating the majority of players?
---
The cynic in me says its a false experiment.  
---
\- Launch the "experiment" to gauge how we take it
---
\- Decide its popular but needs to compromise.
---
\- End experiment, announce intel structures
---
\- Launch perma-blackout with intel structures
---
**CCP Result:** we get blackout to keep the roaming gangs mostly happy and the industrial/part time players are happy with some intel structures.   CCP looks like the hero for listening to the community by delivering blackout but compromising to keep the other side happy.  
---
**Probable actual resul**t: another half arsed major change that doesnt work well and doesnt get iterated on again for the next 10 years.

To quote you, a on previous timers for this citadel “it sounds like a you problem that the 3rd parties didnt shoot us”

Didn’t realize it was two people just wanting a windblock and a territorial claim.  In that case yeah it’s a tad disrespectful especially being busy.
---
Dude, youve honestly tired me with this BS attitude of yours. 
---
You are spouting level A knowledge as if it were the holy grail of knowledge. Highly theoretical but not very practical. Like not all BS fits webs. Ye youre right, PvE ships usually dont. But if you fought and won against a PvP ship without webs then that guy most likely was an idiot. Because no one I know wouldnt use a web on a BS since its highly immobile and needs a method of killing smaller shit.
---
Because pubbie mcfuckstick is casually laughing about the matter.
---
little laugh never hurt anyone
---
I mean, do any of that shit in comms in the largest Alliance and be shown the door rather quickly.
---
Dude, this convo was over long ago. You and people like you will always bitch no matter what and try to force people to play the game you want. Like you are gods over something. Fk off.
---
“Other guys bump longer - Eula violations come from that”
---
You even summarized it yet continue to berate me.  
---
go fuck a rusty spoon
---
Literally the same can be said about you tho lmfao
---
Well, CCP can look at reddit and all and everyone saying they're having a blast with the blackout. I guess you can say it's more qualitative than quantitative data but it's still relevant data.
---
Could you also help with solo wolf rayet fit? What would you recommend on Confessor?
---
I've run into that camp a lot... they all agress when you crash gate if you just wait a second and then let you walk away lol
---
I’ve done nothing but shared info.  You went into personal attacks.  Cunt wanker
---
Once you finish with it I guess.
---
Nothing in that is evidence that you could ever petition to have an extended bump stopped. Nothing in that actually proves what you've claimed and it's never been a thing.
---
I haul every single day in highsec and have for years. 
---
You can't prove what you've claimed, simply because it isn't true and never has been true.
---
Yeah this guy is on the drugs. When I played my WH group always had a couple of guys rolling ECM alts in most of our fights, and outside of fleet fights ECM boats were applied religiously in gank rescues. Shit, I saw one of those guys snatch an expensive ratting boat from the clutches of a gank by rapid responding with an ECM ship. As a utility ship they're very useful for exerting control over the direction of a battle, especially when it come to breaking up logi or saving key friendlies via DPS reduction.
---
He's right in that neuts are very effective and heavily used in WH space, but when I played in WH neuts were fairly common on many line member loadouts for fleet fights along with dedicated neut boats when appropriate.
---
Lol, have you perhaps heard whats going on in HS? About all those new gila accounts? You cant seriously believe botting stopped. Like at all, that it even slowed down?
---
I mean, come on dude.
---
Have you heard me say one thing about how you should play the game? Like literally one thing?
---
Fuck off idiot. You started it. Go back and read the thread.
---
You started with the "talking out your ass" piece. So grow a pair of balls and take it back, dickhead. Typical fucking carebear. Useless thin skinned nob.
---
He is literally laughing at racism. So yeah, fuck you both.
---
Chicken or the egg, dude. One group might push the other into communal defense and umbrellas and the other might remain in cloak ass ships to avoid them. Both of them hurt the game in their own way.
---
And you need not solo, or have a BC comp. You might well get a super dropped now because we're so invested in having caps now. I'm still getting myself burned down in cruiser hulls, so there's at least one guy willing to fight you on poor man terms. I doubt I'm alone. 
---
I miss the subcap brawls of '08-'10 11. RRBS, Cane fleets, Garmon's ruptures, etc. TBH those were the days I had the most fun. I'd totally be on the delete caps bandwagon and happily sacrifice all of mine to get back those days.
---
And it's not entirely the fault of the hunters or the prey. CCP fucked BCs years ago with fitting nerfs and warp speed changes (oh and the goddamned tracking enhancer nerf) Undoing that fuckery would make my own life much more enjoyable.
---
https://evetrace.com used to sort of do it by tracking same ships and players in kills, but theyve since gone offline.
---
lmfao op didnt even specify actions or comments
---
Trading supercapitals for having local back would never, ever happen but lets entertain the idea.
---
Okay so no supercapitals, and we know that EVE players follow the path of least resistance when it comes to krabbing (or anything really but lets go with krabbing). Means you get subcaps back, and with the new VNI tweaks the ships du jour are now MJD Sentry Domis, Brick Tank Heavy Drone Domis, 100MN Gilas, 100MN Ishtars, and throwaway Myrmidons.
---
It also means it's extremely scaleable, easily bottable, afk grinding, all while having access to perfect, instant intel and programs that take advantage of that such as NEAR2. 
---
So now you've solved no issues: you have even more skillfarms, even more reason to train an alt army to keep up the dank ticks, plex demand continues to increase and inflates its price even more, and isk gets even more devalued as time goes on (almost like how it was until recently *gasp*)
---
No thanks, ill keep the supercapitals and rather have no local, with less overall krabs out, but more fights due to people fitting their krabmobiles with teeth.
---
Im one of the few goons against it. Blackout is popular with most because "lol just drop supers on everything"
---
Im fairly certain you log in dude. It is called a "daily login campaign" after all.
---
It 'might' be problematic as you describe ( I disagree, it's humour and alot more nuanced than that), but it does not make anyone a nazi. Please stop weakening that label.
---
Name the alliance.
---
why would I do that? I don't need the features listed above, but pretending that " Intel doesn't need to be made more perfect. " is a valid argument is stupid.
---
to me directly no. to ccp...well just read the eve-o forums :D
---
CCP has other numbers, Im guessing total logged hours across the entire server. Thats more relevant. But this login event will taint even those numbers and it will especially ruin any numbers we could get a hold of. Which is imo really shady.
---
I mean, you are laughably wrong. You are talking like Rattles were not getting caught before. You are wrong.
---
I'm not defending the old way at all, but you sure learn what causality is before claiming this would not have happened pre blackout, because it did. Quite often in fact.
---
Honestly they’re comparing the players response to this sp event against the past sp events.  
---
They measure blackout in other ways.  Posts like this really do evidence how shallow your real understanding is.   
---
Blackout is measured more obviously to us by the falling ADMs in space not covered by the mega coalitions.
---
Lol your mistake was trying to solo
---
ZKill says that is a lie.
---
Well, not really tho. Considering this sub is heavily in favor of one playstyle. Besides, why would u even go qual if you have numbers?
---
I see Wingspann is still putting in 0 effort to try and educate members about how to actually fit a ship, instead of just throw money at it. This one is particularly offensive
---
Had you not proclaimed it to be wrong while not giving credit for what others may have seen (talking out of your ass) I wouldn’t have called you out for that.  You then iterated with shameless gutter talk.  
---
Typical incel neck beard have to argue any other point of view.  I’d rather have a conversation with a vegan atheist than you.
---
Target pailters jave their place but not for t1 cruiser fighting frig gangs. For killing frigs with a t1 cruiser, stabber is the bait boat you are looking for. Character 'Laarz' has some nice bait fits on zkill losses for killing frigs in larger ships, mainly the stabber and ferox. Guy is good at what he does.
---
Your best bet is to be proactively defensive by scouting and keeping your loot on something not nearby and cloaked. Ideally you have dscan eyes on the wormholes and structures of the system so you know when something undocks, and if not that at least have combat scanners out so you can see when something comes in. 
---
Once tackled in a wormhole in a rattle that can solo C3 sites, odds are you can’t fight whatever’s coming for you, even with an alt. 
---
You could try bringing shield logi like a Scythe, but it’ll get primaried fast. And if you get bubbled you’re fucked. 
---
Another thing you could try is bringing instalock webs and painters. If you’re not getting bubbled and it’s fast tackle on you, then if you can kill that fast enough you might escape. You’d want something small, fast, and cloaky with some sensor boosters, a painter, and a web. The cloak so you can babysit yourself (but stay out of bubble range), the fast so you can reposition quickly as needed and keep up with the enemy, the small so you don’t get targeted and killed as fast, boosters so you can lock them up fast, painter and web so the rattle can actually apply damage to the enemy fast tackle quickly. Even if bubbled and stuck in the fight, this ship will help immensely with damage application from heavy (assault) missiles on smaller targets.
---
Huh. I didn't know you could fit both a 50000mn and a 500mn mwd on the same ship.
---
I was responding to the comment and memeing about the common response from miners when a frigate warps off from their Rorqual, unrelated to the OP. Feel free to bitch about everything though.
---
Bait porpoises have like 80k hull tank and neuts, add what is basically a HAW dread affixed to the moon in DPS and good luck
---
You know that's a sarcastic comment, right?
---
youtube_irl
---
Whatever.  I haul more than you.  I know that because it’s the internet and I can say shit that tries to make me seem more relevant to the conversation than reality.  Sorta doubt you even play honestly
---
If you're going to jump on the hate bandwagon at least spell my name correctly.
---
yada, yada...."I only called you out because..." BS. You did it because you're a dick.
---
As for who you'd rather have a conversation with, any atheist vegan or not is better than what you offer, and just like this discussion, much more factual than you are able to be.
---
Probably not if he's webbed+neuted by the Citadel.
---
The 3-month effect is due to the single largest producer of compressed ore in eve went to war and stopped mining. (imperium Deployment to kill tribute+)
---
as far as blackout goes I'd imagine it will lower output across null due to the shift in both risk vs reward and the change from excavators to augmented mining drones to lower risk with rorqs. (Comming from a CEO of an Industry corp in null) we lost 13 rorquals to them being sold off just prior to blackout as it's not worth the commitment onfield. id imagine most other industry groups are doing the same. 
---
option 3 eve is dying
---
Astero is fine and common, buzzards are cheaper and have better exploration &amp; scanning bonuses but you can’t fight in em.
---
There would still be carriers and dreads bud, people would rat with carriers that on their own or in small numbers are easy to deal with with a small amount of logi you can just defang them then murder them. Unlike titans they cant just nuke people on entry to system they cant just outright delete fleets theres more encouragement to send out QRF subcaps. This would also serve to lower the sheer amount of isk  being printed, id also advocate to remove excavators for this reason. 
---
Outside of the ganking sphere and looking at big null plays no longer would people like panfam feel the need to noncontest us because we can just outright outnumber their supercaps. And in the case of situations like in the deklein war last year a cyno jammer on a system wouldnt mean a stalemate of getting a big fleet to the gate and not entering because of boson traps the otherside.
---
On top of that theres a definite problem with people just beelining into supers and ignoring subcaps altogether. By removing the titans and supers people can be encouraged into getting into subcaps meaning more people about to have acheivable brawls.
---
People being tackled in subcaps even in the case of a brick tanked domi like you said if they cant call on supers to land on you you will at least be able to take on the QRF that comes to save it. You could have plays to tackle something with a couple of dudes but stick your fleet camping the way in so you can catch the fleet as its disorganised and running and the like.
---
Weak minds fear words. htfu
---
The problem was the Citadel that most likely neuted him dry, could have permajammed him too, while also wepping/scram.
---
The narrative! Must be maintained!
---
Sure you do mate. Your big space trucking head knows how much others haul.
---
Just another piece of unverifiable crap from you. Just adding to the pile.
---
I think that was an attempt to offset the dearth of people willing to mine at all and the fact that moons required activity. Back in the day mining was a passive (if I remember right) 200 units of a specific goo per hour and if the moon had two goos, you needed two mining rigs.
---
In the time that I am able to mine my moons, I am lucky to clear 100K units before the rocks despawn or about 2/3 of what passive mining would get me back in the day and that's spending a number of hours running three barges and a cap indy.
---
Enter the rorq. He can clear about a third again what my multibox fleet mines and on one account. That's just enough to get what a moon miner could take in a passive month. If the moon has two types, it will need a partner to clear both (assuming the pilot isn't a bot or an autist willing to spend all day on a moon) or the owner needs to set shorter cycles and mine more often.

I hate the idea of suggesting a new ship type but something in betwee, the two might be good. Take away a rorqs mining bonus, delete excavs and panics and make it a cheaper, better booster with an orca's mining ability and add a BD sized barge with a target of150-200Mil and the ability to outmine two or three procs (if they have the lowest yield, CBA to check). 
---
You would still have the ability to mine the moon out in a decent amount of time, and ALL of your miners are killable even under an umbrella although the roarq would have a better chance if the cap pilots were organized quickly and that's OK because killing an expensive ship with covert assailants should be a toss-up, not a guaranteed kill.
---
Mind you, my issue with the hunters being uncatchable should be looked into as well. I'd love to see jumping through a cyno disrupt cloaking or safe-logging for 20-30 minutes.
---
Poland?
---
You're both wrong in as far as you're convinced you KNOW how things would happen in a hypothetical situation.
---
This particular rattle tackle and subsequent fight may or may not have happened before the blackout. The fact that it did happen isn't proof it wouldn't have anyways. The fact that some rattles flown by other pilots in different situations, before the blackout, still did get tackled, and still led to escalations, also isn't proof that this particular time it would have been that way if there had been local.
---
Wow mittens you’re really out of it
---
It's in the description, ranges from 10k to 50k per 'challenge' so tha fully its gonna be kinda like the older events
---
UI Hasn't REALLY changed much. I stop playing every few years for a couple years and there's ways a bunch changed when I get back, except the UI. Sure some stuff is shuffled a tad but it's never taken more than about 20 mins to figure out what I based to do differently if at all
---
There are destroyers that already fit that description.  Look at the DPS on a Catalyst or Thrasher.
---
Yeah, you gotta be decent and stuff. For caps, you can be garbage and still win. That's why I say caps are the ez button. 
---
And cruiser gun tracking at 100km+ is pretty damn good application. 
---
6 t2 eagles put out more than 1500 dps cold, so there's is some accounting for sub perfect application - but it will be very good.
---
All of those numbers are skewed in favor of the Kiki's, kiki still can't stay on grid.
---
And you can easily rip through Kiki's with logi support with decent fc. Once you pick one to primary it dies in about 5 seconds if no one heats anything. 
---
And yes you have three booshers and a chocolate burning pounds specifically because you expect the Kiki's to be able to boosh as well. 
---
It def works, but again - you gotta be decent and stuff which is a problem for most.
---
Wait, are you complaining a damned porpoise is overpowered? 'da fuck you want? For shit to die just because you land on grid?
---
Don’t take fights on a citadel. It’s always a bad plan.
---
Which I have never used?
---
Imagine actually thinking this.
---
Could just but the tags to get a better sec status.
---
Why are you so angry?  You need a hug?
---
Not counting the at ships we have 4 t3c's, 4 recons, 4 bombers, 4 probers, 2 soe, 2 concord ships that can fit covops. 20 ships are really not enough.
---
300m isk/hr is not possible with hisec missions. You can hit maybe 100m/hr by blitzing level 4 missions in a very expensive Machariel. You can do 300m isk/hr by doing filaments in a (again) very expensive ship. The best way you can make money is through exploration in wormholes, or in null through wormholes. Wormhole nija gas huffing is also a very good way to make isk, you just need the 30mil gas harvesting skillbook.
---
Your best bet is to join a hisec corp, if you want to keep doing missions. You can join in on their level 4 missions, they'll teach you how to avoid beginner mistakes, etc. Just know that hisec missions are one of the worst thing you can do for income, except maybe hisec mining. You could also join any number of groups in other areas of space and they'll teach you how to make isk and move on to bigger payouts.
---
Welcome to Eve, it's a risky game. Any ships you get, you will eventually lose, be it to rats or players. You've lost space pixels, get over it.
---
It doesn't matter. CCP knows if you're actually entering the game or not. What you call it is literally not of relevance
---
We get Zkill.  Those #s will be interesting.
---
God you’re a nasty person.

After the ten minutes it took to lock him? He died because he got unlucky or cocky.

Oh likewise bro. Patiently awaiting your next "Nerf NS" post.

Only to nasty people.
---
Apparently killing VNI's is reddit worthy these days smh
---
You were the one mentioning VNIs. 
---
There is no playstyle you can't do now, that you could before. You just have to adapt.
---
You can usually travel through invasion zones relatively easily, it depends on what ship you fly. If you want to be 100% sure, just get one of those free corvettes you can get in any stations and fly through it. If you get through it without being attacked by a NPC, you're good to go.
---
Structure weapons and ewar 100% fun and balanced
---
I belive goons are already embargoing HS?
---
I like to keep everything in F1-F4, max up to F6. Mostly because I can’t see anything past F5 because of my UI setup. 
---
You can use Alt+F[x] for second row and Ctrl+F[x] for third row. 
---
Also, you can bind keys to cycle through targets. I have Alt+L/R arrow keys bound for that. 
---
W is orbit by default, use W+Click. 
---
Press Alt once to look at the currently selected target, Alt again to look at you. 
---
Shift + R recalls all drones to bay, Shift+Alt+R returns and orbits. F tells drones to engage currently-selected target. 
---
I also have some keys bound for fighter groups but I won’t bother with those unless you ask.
---
Don't pretend like anything besides sizeable BRs are worth posting in EVE 2K19

Yeah Stratios is a little bit above my budget for this adventure.
---
Since BattleClinic is dead, where should I go, looking for a decent Astero fit?
---
You literally attacked the guy by saying hes retarded because "You don´t need to log in". Im just saying that maybe dont call people retarded if you dont know what login means.
---
But CCP should know ye.
---
I'm exaggerating slightly but that was more or less my personal experience when I helped drop a fort in Impass. Well, 1-3 + 5 anyway.
---
Except Covetors.
---
&gt; It's the Krab logic. 
---
Dude, I like you for the most part and you were fun to die to in my provi days but this isn't a T1 frigate, it's a trig ship and it died because it got too close and managed to get scrammed long enough for the tower to start playing.
---
I know this because I lost a couple ships to a cap indy and an Ath over the weekend. This is the appropriate way for miners to adapt to the new paradigm. Complain about rorqs all day and I'll agree with you but this KM only shows the miner wasn't some whiny bitch crying to CCP to nerf hunters; it's an example of someone fending for himself... and winning.
---
Yeah. But in times like this I feel like we came from the zoo... Or Mars.
---
&gt; The point is, he wasn't fully aware and didn't jump away as soon as something landed on grid with him. Easy to suggest that if he wasnt paying that much attention, local probably wouldnt have done much for this chap.
---
Without local he had maybe 5 seconds to see the sabre on dscan, and another 5 on grid.
---
With local he'd have had at least an extra 10-15 while the sabre tried to work out which anom he was in, more unless the hunter is super lucky. He'd probably have also had intel from at least 2 jumps away, likely pasted into NEAR so he'd get an audio cue.
---
They also cannot instantly jump into any battle within a few thousand miles.
---
Here and EVEUni are okay, you can also browse the killboards for dead Asteros and look at their fits (just cause they died doesn’t mean their fit was bad).
---
Don’t be afraid to make your own, though! Use things like EVEUni as a source for ideas, work from there.
---
Did goons really export that much or is this the effects of rorq yield, Anom spawn, blackout?
---
In test space we’re paying roughly 105% jbv for ore

Or only allow use on specific ships(read: BS/BC). Possibly with spool too.

What are you looking to do? Sounds dumb to say it, but do that. Don't let the subreddit tell you how to play the game. Just make sure whatever you decide to do you commit to it, atleast for a while, and give it a real shot.
---
Seems like a plan for tonight ;) Thank you kind sir o7
---
Hey, just accept that you are awesome at what you do. And you don't have to be liked by everyone. I still like you, I still have found memories about ECMing your ships and blobbing you. EvE is easy after all.
---
Zkill says that some snakes were dying anyway. That doesn't mean that many were not saved because of local (or local fuelled intel channels) telling them to leave before they could create content.
---
Well, tbf there's like a dozen "little guys" vs the several thousand goons...
---
Good guys win again!
---
Dude, he's completely serious. If you're not 100% safe in hisec, you're either ganking someone or hauling way too much. Everything else you can prevent by piloting safely, doing your research and paying attention. Eve is not a theme park MMO like Wow and everything you've been saying so far implies that you think it is.
---
Even before invasions, hisec was dangerous. Heck, hisec was even more dangerous in the past because you had a lot more people in hisec, so you many more gankers.
---
Fat finger typo - fixed.

What’s a bandwagon that’s become the consensus understanding?  Every time you post it’s this same ignorant shit?

---
I played 2006 - 2011. Eve was always dying.
---
Look at all the dumbs blaming you for being in goonswam.
---
But this was just a temporary thing? Free intel is now back.
---
ZKill stats prove you wrong, but ok.
---
He felt betrayed! Outrageous.
---
First, debate is not simply calling bullshit and telling people they are wrong.  What you are doing is obstructing opinion.  You back nothing you say up with fact, just imply "you are wrong."  Do i have a few misconceptions?  Yes.  Am i wrong in my opinion?  I do not think so.  There is a larger issue here that you simply do not see.  You sound like you think you are smart.  You may even be a genius, but when you bait questions and make baseless statements your ignorance of people shows.  Instead of trying to see the overarching problem, you get stuck on minutia.  I say this not to troll you, but to try to help.  
---
Each person sees things from a different perspective.  Relativity is a thing.  The best way to deal with outright wrong information is not to tell people they are wrong, but to find out why they think that.  
---
Yes i made mistakes.  Names particularly get confused for me.  Im more of a faces kind.  Never forget a face.  Im a human.  Have to work with flaws.  You seem to want to shut flaws down.  People do not work that way. 
---
Also, most of what id said was opinion.  In a debate about opinion one would try to change the opinion.  Telling someone they are wrong is just hostile and will get you, well, here.
---
Hopefully you internalize some of this.  Might help your other relationships in life.  Likely though, you will just tell me i am wrong again.
---
Rattles got tackled and led to escalations before, to state that this wouldn't have happened if local was there is demonstrably false. 
---
Could he have gotten away? Yes.
---
Is no local the reason he didn't? Unprovable, therefore, cannot be used as a basis of fact.
---
Fyi, 2km/s is actually not that fast at all. If you go PvP with it, you will get caught up by frigates going easily at 3-6km/s.
---
I don’t understand why you are getting downvoted. Tats a super accurate description.
---
NoGo has been in corp for years, so he has the ISK and time to burn fucking around experimenting with new things.
---
We have standard fits that we try to push newer agents to before they go bur ING billions on ideas like "can I make a polarized Proteus work?"
---
He needs a highsec alt to buy the tags :P.
---
I just consider this to be our national "flavor". Sometimes a bit embarrassing, but to be honest, there is little we can do about it.
---
I kinda miss being DRF pets tbh.
---
Looking at ZKill there has not been a significant uptick in Rattles dying. So statistically there is no difference between local and blackout, so to claim this happened due to the Blackout is easily disproven.
---
For the record, I am for the local change becoming permanent.
---
Are you not seeing the joke or are you flexing because UR-W1V does put out?
---
Either one is just as bad as the other.

I'm getting started in T2 invention/manufacturing.  I've got 3-4 characters spread across three accounts to use.  I figured one would be a dedicated ME/TE/Copying research alt.  I'm struggling with the best way to organize the other 2-3 characters.  Is there an optimal way to focus each one?  Any thoughts from those of you who have come before me?
---
Thanks.
---
haha okay :)
---
Rest assured that should we ever take sov in http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/HV-EAP the station will be named HV-EAPetting
---
Nice!
---
You just do you boo boo.
---
Nullsec is a lot of fun with the Blackout in effect
---
This is all good advice.  I'd add on that you're most likely to get tackled by a Sabre in this situation, or possibly a Stratios/T3.  There will be more ships coming to gank you.  Assuming your first notice is the bubble going up/the decloak, and assuming you don't MJD out in time, you're going to want to get the scram off you ASAP so you can MJD away to safety.  The best bet there is probably a jam on the scramming ship.  This is all very low probability though.
---
Hmu ig and ill send you items and fit
---
Loogie
---
Edit a fucking vid man. I ain't watching that shit for vni kills
---
reading about this on polygon right now.
---
Without it sounding too crybaby I want you to know this whole thread and your responses have really turned me off this game.  If you make all these changes, null sec really isn’t gonna be worth all the work.
---
I know I'm a cynic after all these years of ccp doing exactly what you just said, but damn if you didnt hit the nail on the head.
---
Ccp totally has nerfed things hard in the past, then lightened up.on that nerf a few days/weeks later, making it seem like a good compromise when its not. 
---
Like how car salesmen quote you an outrageous price then "go talk to their manager" and come back with a price that is still outrageous but that seems fair compared to the 1st one...
---
Yeah unfortunately the vocal minority are throwing fits...  you can AFK rat or mine anymore... but nullsec is ACTUALLY dangerous now!  The blackout has been a great change.  Forces alliances to communicate and work together
---
Jita doubling services went legit last year.
---
Two corps and a Test diplo at the time, enough for me.
---
I honestly think they could make Black Ops covops and it'd be mostly fine. 
---
I'd love to see some Triglavian covops ships, as well as maybe some pirate versions of stuff like bombers, reckons etc.
---
Jesus Christ, that is a fabulous idea and I don't know how I did not think of it before. I don't care if people talk shit about you, you're awesome in my books and I need more wacky ideas.
---
Well when you jump jump jump scan finding nothing system after system a vni kill is definitely something to cheer about
---
You can tell people that until we are both blue and it wont matter how true it is.
---
 To them, using plex is "free" game time because they did nothing but play a game for the isk to get it, whereas a sub is them paying real money the probably worked for. So "to them" the idea that ccp would be doing something underhanded to make them pay is reasonable.
---
We know its not. If anything, ccp would be making it easier to plex because a months worth of plex is more money to them that a months worth of subscription. But you cant tell many players that.
---
It's cute if you want to rp, but in practice you will be much better off leaving most of the pve stuff/haulers, make your isk where it's efficient and just stuff your carrier full of pvp ships+replacement cyno ships+covops t3 for alt.
---
He’s got 150 reddit alt accounts too I guess.  I don’t care about fake internet points bruh
---
Depends on the amount of frigates, the types, and their reps though. 
---
I've moved away from RLMLs toward medium pulses if I know I'll likely be swarmed because 35 seconds of reload is ass
---
Oh it was our problem for sure. But you pretending like we wouldn´t fight you just because doesn´t hold up then does it?
---
Well, they didn't earn the nickname blobhawks for nothing :P
---
....however I agree with most of what OP said. I would tackle the cyno inhibitor a bit differently though. Personally I think introducing a cyno inhibitor module that fits to a HIC makes perfect sense (creates a disruption field with the same concepts as the unscripted warp disruption bubble - ya just can't light a cyno in it). Not only does it fit with the role of the ship, it also creates a solid risk vs. reward scenario (since HICs are objectively not cheap, but not expensive either). Additionally it gives a target to shoot at as part of the fleet action - nobody is left feeling like they have zero recourse unless you're a woefully unprepared miner that was only counting on your cyno to save you. I could go down that rabbit hole a lot more, but I'm sure you get the idea.
---
is that a goonspeak to put fucking as a suffix on everything?
---
Oh yeah. Interdiction nullification is an entirely different can of worms. I never really run nullified just out of habit because, when local was still in play, it wasn’t practical. If I found a target, I’d have to refit to kill it and by that point, it’d be gone because he saw me in local. I guess now I could nullify but it’s a pain. Nullification is, in my opinion, a stupid mechanic though because there’s basically no counterplay. You’ll never catch a nullified T3C even if you’re able to decloak it. Cloaks do allow you to pick engagements but I don’t know that I think that’s a bad thing. It enables small groups and solo players to engage against large groups and still be effective in hit and run tactics.
---
blackout is aimed at fozzie not getting lynched at the next player gathering for doing fucking nothing about the abysmal state of the game tbh
---
Its not all bothers. I know several people who quit or log in less, most being of the " if I wanted to live on a wormhole, I would have done that", mentality.
---
I dont care for the blackout but it is what it is so I'm still playing for now.
---
Call them up or email them and ask about visiting. I got to tour their building and it was really cool.  I saw some cool stuff that i cant talk about. They are a nice group of people. Also there are some good food places nearby and they are right next to a bar. The steak house was great.
---
I don't think we would tbh
---
the amount of people who would even bother with super ratting or rorqual mining if you had to train a character for it from scratch or buy one from the bazaar would be substantially lower than the number who do it in an eve online with skill injectors 
---
part of the problem is how well rorquals scale, and you can't ignore the interaction between scaling rorqual mining output and super proliferation
---
I realize there are no friends in the market but I’m looking for some info if anyone is willing to share. I’ve used Isk per hour for a few days and the SVR is a handy number but I haven’t seen it anywhere else. I’m curious is there is a way to search market orders by bid ask spread while viewing the SVR?
---
&gt;On the other side you can't deny players who joined the game later chance to even up on what they can coubter vets more or less.
---
you can and should, once you remember that this is eve online and not world of warcraft
---
Test has. And politics.
---
The phrase "jewing" meaning pve to make isk has been replaced by krabbing in pretty much all of eve too
---
sorry cant hear you, that goon dick down your throat is making it tough to understand you
---
That is quite incomplete without a Sabre, you n the Mrs needs to gets a bit busy &lt;3
---
How do I join eve Uni?
---
Yeah, right. I never played WoW, so I don't know shit about it, but in Eve Online, the small groups and the newbros were fucked.
---
Can you show me where they are? I looked in  CODE. but all I found were smushed turds circle jerking each other in a dark hole while giving each other moral support.
---
Bubble fucking a gate is a perfectly legit thing to do. Why would the devs get involved?
---
We can meme it until it bleeds :D
---
My fanboy-o-meter is ringing like crazy right now i wonder why.
---
The short answer is no, it can't work but a polarized Tengu is possibly viable for lulz if you fit triple damps
---
Would that be efficient though?  It takes the better part of an hour to build a frigate.
---
I'm pretty new at all of this. Do reactive armor and adaptive shielding give you better resistance to the current damage type over time, or is that just a fancy name for "a bit of resistance across the board?" Or am I mixing up two entirely different things? I mostly play shield tank when I fight, and it's nearly all against rats so I really don't have any clue what would be better or worse against another Capsuleer.
---
It's probably because they don't want stupid e-lawyering arguments over whether an edgy joke is 'racist' or not.
---

This is why it's important that CCP adjusts the game mechanics so it's practical to roam under a hostile umbrella.

Don’t those modules also appear on the killmail along with the standup missiles?

Dropping a carrier on a nano gang is stupid. Just use recons or T3Cs.

no the missiles display if the citadel did damage with them, same with point defence. The tackle mods only show if the citadel does 0 damage or didn't shoot for awhile.

Thank you very much!

You guys are being extremists here.  Yea hisec was never safe.  My complaint is about how much less safe highsec is now.  It's akin to mid or low sec now.  Jump in to the wrong system and you are insta-dead.  I simply think this is a bad mechanic.

It takes about 35s to lock a Vedmak in a citadel that has no rig or sig amps. Would be much faster if he had MWD running or was target painted by something.

Don't forget this one:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYNr82jHq1s
---
Why wouldn't it be? It's not like you have to be online or u docked to build that stuff
---
Orca vs thorax, the orca should have the mass advantage. Pulse your MWD while aligning towards something and you should be able to warp at the end of the cycle.
---
He's probably oversized prop mod fit so his agility is terrible and so if you can align to something opposite him, it's unlikely he'll be able to change his bump angle enough to push you out of alignment.

---
The krab logic relevant to this thread is a guy figured out if he could pin down his attacker long enough (assuming the attacker was dumb enough to get too close) then he might come out on top. That's the logic we should be encouraging.
---
It's like a dramiel pilot In 09 complaining that he di d to a bellicose who suckered him in and double webbed and scrammed him for the time it took for the cavalry to land. Pilots in Ships that outclass the victim get salty when they fuck up.
---
Except that the claim elsewhere on reddit is that krabs are staying docked, so it could be a similar number from a smaller pool, which would indicate they are easier to catch.
---
Yeah, keeping an alt is nessesary.
---
Don't back down now fuckhead.

they sure did not. so, is it a goonspeak thing to do that?

Ive been playing since 11. I enjoy the culture and meta of EVE. I want to be cute and rp. Something like being a nomad is the pinnacle of enjoyment for many of us.

First mind you that this is an alpha fit. You can even solo some of the c5 sites but it will take some time because you won't have the dps of a rattlesnake. Here is a spreadsheet on what will outrange you [spreadsheet link]https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FkduDTh3p-nr9p681LNgjcE5U-CY8EKrl1IPJmjB8hI/edit?usp=sharing) (note that some of the ranges i have changed because they weren't accurate on the wiki)
---
First bookmark a safe spot, check the spreadsheet and links in there, anchor there a mobile depot, drop the cargo and refit for ratting
---
You can only warp to 100km but you want 200km. So before warping to the site press ctrl + b and as soon as you see the enemy in overview, repeatedly bookmark your trail as much as you can so you can warp to them as needed to keep the distance
---
Launch drones and drop the other mobile depot from which you can load more drones from cargo in your drone bay. You will need to do this whenever you run out of drones. But it will take 1 min of standing still so do it at distance.
---
The wrecks will be so far apart that you can warp to them and loot without needing a mobile tractor unit. Warp to bookmark and back to wreck for the last ones. You only need 150km to warp
---
You will need two mobile depot and bring up to 380 valkyrie I drones. hammerhead's are cheaper but they are not as fast
---
I also pack a venture with gas harvester. I use this fit to clear Instrumental Core Reservoir in c5-c6 wh for the highest price gas and Log off there. When I find an exit I switch to the venture I carry in my cargo and drop all the gas there wherever it is
---
Whenever you warp (even to a bookmark in the same site) you will abandon your drones
---
Set the drones to focus fire so they won't change targets
---
They sleepers will only repair themselves when in combat
---
You want all the sleepers chasing you or else some will stay back and shoot your drones
---
I only recently found out you can fit 500MN MWD on battlecruisers and the gnosis really is one of the only ships that has the enough power grid. You can simply outrun without warping to keep distance but needs lots of capacitor modules. So I am still testing the build
---
If you have omega, that changes the game. You can fit drone control augmentor II and micro jump drive which i haven't tinkered with yet. I am sure it frees you up more modules to crank up more dps. A big step will be hitting 250km range, that way you can outrange turrets

Having plenty of isk isn't a solution to understanding PvP basics and why that fit neither a jack of all trades or master of any. I get trying things, I really do, but at least have some sort of direction
---
Kinda worse, actually. You know how pirates in Elite have to either coerce you into dropping cargo or extract it, or else they lose it when you get spaced? Here when you die, you leave a wreck behind, and all they have to do is scoop up all the goodies. Apparently not everything is guaranteed to survive, but there is no incentive for the gentleman pirate.
---
That reminds me. You remember Code? Well, there's a CODE here, and they're not pirates. They're more like a cult, and they specialize in just nuking miners, haulers, and pretty much anyone who doesn't look like they fight for a living. Put that alliance in your contacts with terrible standing so you see them highlighted in your overview.
---
Of course, you already know the drill from Elite, especially if you've done CGs. Everywhere outside of the hangar is a dangerous place. They have High, Low, and Null security in EVE, but they don't often think about how pretty much everywhere in Elite is Low/Nullsec.
---
don't let your non-bigoted nose bleed from that high, ser. \*tips delorean\*
---
I'm not complaining about the OP or anything to do with baiting, it's part of the game and completely fine, baiting is cool because it encourages PVP. I don't know anyone in this post nor was I commenting on either side I was just sharing an anecdote from the typical 'bait mining ship lol' to a post that shares the same sentiment.
---
Just like how it's funny how many Orthrus pilots type 'pussy' into local when a Atron warps off from them, the Rorqual situation is very similar - again, not related to the OP.
---
Something something for every purpose theres a tool. [Who are you to be so entitled to pretend yours is the right one?](https://youtu.be/EqkS1VI8pVc) (oh and don't worry, this also works the other way around, mining battleships are an actual thing)

---
Dunno. I'm not a goon and never will be.
---
That's a silly argument. That's like saying it's PvP when I interact with others in a dungeon in wow. We roll for an item, is that PvP? No, it's PvE. Just because you interact with other players doesn't make it versus that player.
---
If you are in a Nullsec group and you cooperate with others, lets say in a mining ops. Is that PvP? There are other players there and you interact with them but it's not versus them.
---
Eve is a sandbox MMO because you can choose to do what you want. Be it creating something for yourself or against other players. It is your choise and for a very large proportion of the player base, it's not primarily against other players.
---
To what end? Win more nonexistent tournaments? Esports sponsorships? There's literally no reason to crack down on people messing around.

Returning player after a four year break. 
---
I’ve had more fun in the last month than I did in the 5 years I played.
---
Then don’t try to solo things on a citadel? 
---
How would you suggest changing mining structures so that they offer something meaningful to the defender (who chooses the battlefield and gets to prepare it as best he can) and gives a reasonably prepared attacker (who chooses when and where to engage) a challenging target to hit?
---
I’m okay with needing to prepare a gang to kill some miners on a structure.

I do enjoy the irony in that the guy who started posting on reddit 1 month ago, has 9 posts on r/eve (4 of them being in this thread) and only started posting on r/eve coincidentally when blackout started, is accusing other people of using alt accounts.
---
You understand I wasn't being literal right?
---
It depends what you're shooting at and how fast you can vaporize it under scram+web. Niche, but does look possible in very specific cases.
---
What? Having a direction or goal for a fit doesnt have anything to do with that. If people love feeding shitfits I'm not gonna stop them by any means
---
I'm not complaining about the citadel? I'm just saying why it's not possible to kite solo on one.
---
Shhhhh... You don't say that about WHs!
---
Oh, honey... No...
---
oh wow that was quick, thanks a lot.
---
It’s one of the entrances to providence QBL-BV but there are multiple systems with them around nullsec. Mining ops tend to like to do this on gates to slow down attackers
---
Lol it gets worse, next is Vexor not even vni :)) them the ambush comes
---
&gt; But there should be a special anti-cap module so that my five man nano cruiser gang can *at least escape* against a titan!
---
No-one thinks a roaming gang should be able to fight a capital. But what they do think is that you shouldn't be able to drop a cap instantly onto grid and delete ships many classes below it.
---
Imagine there was a ship module that you could fit to a frigate, and which could instantly teleport a battleship onto grid, and that battleship weapons applied well to frigates. Sounds pretty ridiculous and would clearly ruin the frigate fight meta, right? But caps can do exactly that.
---
What did you expect when 1v1 is dead ? Caps and supers ?
---
Ah the cycle of COPE.

yeah i should join a pve corp, that's a good idea.

One VNI in system.  The other 20 ships are cloaky tengus.

you think they actually care about the results rather than just looking as if they're doing something.

PA dropped in to the office, so they're looking busy.

At least, until the hunters realize they won't find anything to hunt that doesn't have a support umbrella.

If you're doing business in highsec, check out using the Tranquility Trading Tower in Perimeter as an alternative to using Jita 4-4.
---
Dude, as a fellow alpha (returning, granted, from a multi year hiatus) who has moved on from hisec to npc null with half of the sp you have, you have to face the fact that you're just fucking terribad at this game, or crazy entitled.  I don't even know how many hisec systems there are, but there's loads, meanwhile there are three invasion sites at a time affecting like 4 systems each. You don't even need to move into a different empire (or REGION of an empire, for that matter) to avoid trig shit, so you should be well able to get l3s with your current faction while avoiding trigs. Oh, and day one knowledge is you don't autopilot anywhere. Literally nothing about the invasion makes any part of this game unplayable aside from maybe once a month having to avoid a couple systems. I'm reading this whole thread down to the bottom trying to figure out if this is done sort of meta troll to turn the drifter tears threads on their head.
---
&gt; but to find out why they think that.
---
But then you just call it bait questions.
---
No winning with people like you.
---
 Xerrasss, I accepted the invite and look forward to working with you guys. Thanks.
---
If I'm nude, then by definition it is a nude beach. Right?
---
Stop rolling yourself out? ;)
---
you can fit multiple ABs and MWDs as long as they all have different sizes
---
You cant tackle stuff on the ansiblex, they can just jump though even if pointed or bubbled.
---
the problem with concepts like "lowering the barrier of entry for new players to be competitive sooner" is that eve is a sandbox game built on the concept of personal achievement. anything you do to make eves limited endgame content more accessible and easier to achieve for new players cheapens all of the effort that veteran players put in to get there when it was more difficult. eve is not a game that enjoys a steady influx of new players, no matter how much ccp and the player base try to make it that way; eve is a game that lives and dies by the longevity of players who are addicted, for lack of a better term
---
injectors and other such measures aimed at making new players more competitive, faster, ignore the prime demographic of eve online
---
Nah, it’s Test
---
So you're just a hypocritical mouth piece then? That explains a lot.
---
carriers usually do 50000 MN for speed and 500 MN for align
---
I lived in Hawaii for a few years on Oahu. Waikiki beach would be slammed packed in the summer. I always knew if my own little spots to go where you cant even see more than 2 people for a mile. Was great.
---
I admire your honesty and your attitude. You are the kind of player Eve needs. GJ.
---
Don't you dare say that. I love my battle Porp. Such a good frigate blender.
---
Which one has the cyno fit? That one wins.
---
Wdym? Theres no gate guns in nullsec lol. Stop doing your stuff in lowsec
---
The reactive hardener shifts the resistance profile to adapt to the damage you’re taking. The sub-cap adaptive invuln shield hardeners just give some resists across the board, if my understanding is correct
---
Zkill at best is inaccurate as it only shows what is posted and not total
---
Let's not pretend you don't include goons in your rhetoric.
---
As if dropping a risk averse nano gang is less stupid when you fight an enemy. 
---
You drop the nano gang to fight against people in their home system. They drop their capital to defend against your tactics. Recons/T3Cs won't do much without critical mass, at which point virtually any nano gang will fuck off regardless.  
---
But a carrier suddenly reduces your kitey bullshit composition and makes it risky. Deal with it.
---
Summary - B L A C K O U T - The crew talks about the temporary(ish) removal of local from nullsec, the effect its had on their gameplay and how the changes in eve since 2016 has caused smallgang stagnation in nullsec. We then get into some recent fight summaries.
---
You doing this in npc null or ls? Also use an endurance for mining no? Its harder to catch and mines enough for making cheap ships
---
I bought my chimera in a random ls for like 700m
---
&gt;Capitals should be fleet support ships, you 100% should need the help of smaller ships to track and kill frigates. There are these items in the game called stasis webifiers, they should be required for a carrier to be able to nuke an interceptor. 
---
I disagree. That just makes a carrier easy prey. Why use a carrier at all, when a super has more health, DPS, and can't be held captive by a fucking ibis? If I want to fight other caps I use a Dreadnought, a Titan, or a super. All of these are superior at applying DPS to other capitals. If a carrier cannot apply DPS to anything larger than a battleship, and is the worst capital Vs other capitals, it serves no purpose. It can't siege to buff it's tank/DPS, it can't escape a lone frig, it will lose a 1v1 Vs any other capital. It's pointless. 
---
A carrier should exceed dreads, titans, supers in ability to target frigates etc. 
---
&gt;EVE has never been about 1 class of ship dominating every other class, which is what it has become
---
Carrier, supercarrier, titan, and Dreadnought are pretty much 4 classes of ship. 
---
That's like saying eve has become one class of ship dominating every other, because a t3c's will generally shit on almost everything in the game above or below them. Why isn't that a problem? 
---
&gt;Capitals should be fleet support ships
---
No. Every one of the four capital classes (5 if you count Fax) should not be fleet support and incapable of doing meaningful damage to small targets. That would force anyone who wants a cap to live in a big bloc, to make it worth owning. And even then it wouldn't be worth owning, unless you bash structures/brawl with other caps regularly. 
---
&gt;There are these items in the game called stasis webifiers, they should be required for a carrier to be able to nuke an interceptor. 
---
I'm of the opinion that a lone interceptor should be of no threat to a carrier. The interceptor should need numbers, or face near certain death. Sure, make it so a flight of dromis is a requirement to hit a frig, but having it so I cannot hit a frig at all, despite the multiple classes of drones and sensor boosters I can equip is a strange idea.
---
The second login event coincides with EVE Classic release.
---
I might have them do this weekly now lol
---
I always thought it would be cool if we could dock frigates and destroyers with carriers, spawn there, and borrow and fit ships from the hangar.
---
The current implementation just feels wrong, and it's obvious why nobody uses it for that.
---
blaming goons is one of the stages of grief.
---
Without context as to the racist thing in question, chances are even your very large nullsec alliance will be here also saying they dont accept racism.
---
Unfortunately for everyone on these issues, the exact line for racist and non-racist isn't well agreed upon.
---
Why would they? You and your goon masters would just blob them with titans or outnumber them 120 to 1 whenever they undock. I highly doubt they would want to feed any more to you and your goon masters.
---
Sure thing.  The point of that is to say that even a reasonably fast ship; one that i have personally outran fleets with before simply didnt help.  I was trying to illustrate strategy was applied.  I have admitted several times that mistakes were made here.  That other ships are faster is still moot when targeting is instant.  Again, talking about what i think is a bad game mechanic.
---
Send me some ideas and I’ll have them take a shot at drawing one of them

You asked one question, and it was about how much my ships cost.  Also; called it.

LS and NPC NS I'll see what is better an Endurance or a Procurer. You may be right. In which case I can throw in a Sabre and another frigate, maybe a bait Venture.

In negotiations, this is called Anchoring.

Fuck yeah they will. Racism, sexism ect. That'll have your ass looking for a new home pretty quick. We have a gay dude that makes a lot of gay jokes and we know we can joke with him, but we would never intentionally try and hurt him because of that.
---
Unwilling to risk losing your ship to get a kill. We got your point.
---
Well, you should go back and look at all those ? I used.
---
But you already called them bait questions....so....
---
You made up your mind before bothering to engage.
---
Here I was wanting to understand and help.
---
But you want to be angry and believe people are out to get you.
---
I would also  just use a combat astero for relics and data/ scanning and replace the cheetah with a kitey pirate frigate like a worm or garmur to kills vnis or brawlys you come across.
---
I think there is a break point when it causes too much lag the devs can delete it.
---
Not sure if it applies here.
---
Imagine an open bone fracture that is being treated by putting bandaids over it until you can't see it anymore.
---
Another user; who actually read, listened, and responded to what i was saying actually figured it out.  He pointed out that i was stuck in my home space, and simply upset that i could not play in that area when i wanted to.  Much like you just did, without the assumption that im just bad at this game.  How good or bad someone is at something is very subjective; to the best player, the number 10 player is bad.  End of the day; ive admitted where i am wrong, bit still think the invasion mechanic is just poorly implemented.  Agree or dont, it is an opinion.
---
While I agree that lack of active war fronts is clearly a deficit for the game, I would also point out that roaming is not really a quality alternative, despite the praises of those who are inured to it.
---
Roaming is just a crutch for the absence of more intense conflict-centered gameplay.  It had its heyday back in the long ago days before cyno highways were a thing, when breaking up gatecamps actually meant something.
---
Fit a covetor to defend itself. Post your km here. You'll achieve a second longer before you die, and you'll have to halve your isk/hour rate to do so.
---
Many ships are specialised for certain roles. The odd one that can be tanked/fit with neuts doesn't change that.
---
how does deploying somewhere and NOT mining make the volume of ore sales on the market go down? i'd expect the lack of locally mined ore means more ore bought on the market? or am I missing something?
---
&gt;Solo
---
How many alts?
---
Yeah I would say up to crussiers or bc
---
Jump fuel should have been a moon asset from the beginning.  That was always dead obvious that capital assets should rely upon possessing and holding territory.
---
You can do that with a star gate too... so just have someone waiting on the other side? 
---
With that said, I do not think you should be able to take an Ansiblex while HIC-pointed.
---
1 hence the cyno alt image in the upper left. Not gating a carrier through low and null with all this cargo.
---
Yea just did.  You make assumptions not ask questions.  I did respond to the one non-baited question you asked.  There are only a couple of reasons i can think of that you would ask how much my ships cost.  None of them are productive.  All of them lead to a pre-determined counterpoint.  That is by definition a baited question.  
---
Also; you are accusing me of something i have not done to other responses.  You should internalize that as well.  Is it something you are doing wrong?
---
Webs &gt;&gt; target painters for this application.
---
TPs better for making it easier to hit things that are too far for webs. You need to actually slow the frigates down.
---
Looks like your comment is getting more down votes than you can dish out.
---
People say stuff like this but I have never heard or read of anyone actually explaining a proper fit.
---
The cyno system is backwards.  Large vessels and stations should be porting smaller, fleeted ships to themselves, or between themselves.  
---
It makes perfect sense that if you land on a capital ship within a builtup domain, then you have to be prepared for a subcap reaction fleet, preferably up to some net mass limit.  That scales nicely.  It also allows capital ships to extend force projection.
---
The only thing capital ships need to be able to do is jump to a nearby system without having to rely upon a jumpgate.  They shouldn't need something as irrelevant as a corvette in that system to do it either.  New Eden is only around 100 ly across, and it shouldn't be that hard to figure out what the average distance between neighboring stars is in order to set a forced jump limit.
---
If you don't have access to a library of researched BPOs you'll need a lot of research slots, so train all of them for that. The specialized character is the one that does invention. And if you plan to make hulls, at least one builder has to have the advanced ship building skills.
---
That´s exactly how it worked for two friends of mine.

Low Sec = certain death for a newbie

It probably all depends on whether or not you are holding pizza.

Also; just realized that the "question" you asked that i did respond to wasnt a question, but a complaint about how i left information out.  Im telling you, it is your approach.
---
There's a few comments elsewhere in the post explaining why this particular combination of mods doesn't work well together. If you're wormhole ganking with a cloaky T3, the Legion is easily the best choice, and outside of T3 the Stratios is great

We should introduce our kids. Daughter is a contributing member of CODE.
---
Depends if sub rates and logins/playtime are in freefall.
---
There’s a lot of good advice already, but imma drop this copy paste message for newbies as well
---
This is a copy / pasted message, but fell free to answer it if you have any questions.
---
First of all, take the time to do the career agent missions. It will show you many things in the game (exploration, mining, industry, hauling, etc).
---
Then, well Eve is a sandbox, so you will need to figure out what you want to do. As a new player, you are not strictly limited, but what ever you do, Eve can be dull and boring, mechanics are complex at first because of the amount of informations you need to learn but once you understand them it's generally a lot easier. What ever you want to do, try to have fun or enjoy the complex interactions mechanics are creating, so basically don't grind isk for the sake of grinding isk.
---
- Want to explore the stars alone ? Buy an exploration frigate, a cloaking device and go around the stars looking for data and relic sties. Maybe join a wormhole corp and enjoy space where frontiers change everyday, and need scanning on a daily basis. There are some newbie friendly wormhole corps that can teach you the way of Bob.
---
- Want to join one of the large nullsec empire ? Join TEST, Pandemic Horde, Karmafleet or Brave. They are all well known newbie friendly corporation/alliance and they will give you free ships, a place in fleet, and people are generally willing to teach you. They also offer good opportunities for new players to make isk (exploration and salvaging mainly).
---
- Overwhelmed by large organizations but still want to join an active PvP corp ? Try and look for a small faction warfare corp or alliance, there are plenty of them and they will also guide you, get you a place in fleet and you will enjoy endless content.
---
- Want to settle in a bit more in "security" ? Run some combat mission in HS. But try not to do that, really.
---
- Want to become the space Rockefeller ? Look into market, region trading, and all the shit. You won't blow space ships but if you enjoy raw data, data analysis (like, real data analysis) this is your thing. Isk revenue is potentially infinite.
---
- Want to mine rocks and turn them into modules, ships, ammunition ? Start mining and industry. Pro tip, don't do it alone in HS you don't have a single chance, join Goons (= Karmafleet), nullsec have way more valuable ore and Goons are basically the safest most organized industry in the game. You can also join some renter corp but that's up to you.
---
- Want to build your own corp ? Build it with some friends, maybe to do industry, or PvE, or PvP. My 5 isk : FW is a really good way to make isk and have some fight for new players. Low class WH can also be interesting.
---
A short list of advice :
---
- [This is your bible](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page)
---
- Right clic EVERYTHING.
---
- Eve is a sand box, figure out what you want to have fun doing and don't bother what other thinks. There is no right way to play Eve.
---
- Faction do not matter. Pick one you feels seems cool and then ignore it for ever since you can fly any ship of any faction without any difference.
---
- Eve is also a dangerous game. Don't use ships you can't afford to loose. Both players and NPCs can wreck you quite fast, even later in the game when you will fly big expensive ships.
---
- People will kill you. No matter where you are, people can and will kill you, even in high security space. HS is actually the worst place to be, because you think everyone is friendly when it's really not the case. Outside, it's a lot more easier, everyone is your enemy.
---
- The very same people that will kill you can also be the same people that will explain to you why you died if you ask them. People in the game are generally friendly and don't mind teaching new players.
---
- Don't get attached to your ships.
---
- Eve shine when played with other people. Don't be afraid of recruitment policies, knock at the door, join a corp, have fun with others.
---
- Learn of your mistakes, don't get angry. If you died, it's your fault.
---
- r/evenewbies it's a good place to ask stupid question. r/evejobs it's a good place to look for a corp.
---
Dunno, haven't logged in since then because i was busy ~~working~~ crying, but I think I will adapt.

You can share it here, no need to be secretive about it

unless theres already a ton of plex on market but people arent buying plex in store
---
I've dreamt of doing this in wormholes. But am chickun.
---
Maybe a cloaky Rapier would do the trick of webbing down the initial tackle ship, or better yet, a cloaky arty Loki with dual webs so that he can clear the fast tackle at a distance?
---
&gt; My complaint is about how much less safe highsec is now. It's akin to mid or low sec now
---
See, when you say stuff like that it's extremely hard to take you seriously. As a whole, hisec is still by far safer than lowsec. They even put in a "Are you sure you want to jump in here, dangerous triglavians ahead" warning so if you jumped in something expensive or turned off the warning, it's kind of your fault.
---
The thing is, this is basically a non-issue, most people who live in hisec are still playing in hisec. If it was such a bad mechanic that would make people want to leave, they would have. You took risks and lost your ship, big deal. As others have said, your ship is ammo, it's expandable. That's why people have been reacting this way.
---
Like look at this post:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cfs3zr/br_titan_down_the_real_story/
---
The dude lost a Titan, the most expensive ship you could ever own, which will take months for him to replace. He takes it like a champ snd honestly, everybody commends h for it. That is Eve.
---
Unless you want to use the carrier for actual fighting, a dread is probably better as it has a much larger fuel bay and more cargo space.
---
I thought it was a fenir...
---
So many people claiming they love the proteus and 99% of the suggestions are trash. Jesus Christ.  
---
I would rather the proteus stay as it is then get a "damp bonus"
---
&gt; All of them lead to a pre-determined counterpoint.
---
The counter point of offering to pay for them?
---
No who is talking about "pre-determined" ㅋㅋㅋ
---
Wow dude, you played yourself.
---
No, because there are not a bunch more hunters. Nullsec is still dead. Same number pf hunters getting same number of kills does not mean it is easier. Did a few Waffles guys resub? Sure, but not enough to tip the scales.
---
Is there a way to bind a shortcut to overheat a slot?
---
DST cannot do the cloak trick because 25% of a MWD is not quite enough to get up to speed, but 25% of an overheated MWD can. But the time involved to get the MWD preheated with shift-click after starting the align is just a little too much.
---
Stabber became a top tier t1 cruiser With rebalance
---
I was speaking more broadly about the interesting choice of fits the corp runs. He definitely didn't lose it, but he's also not going to kill much besides the typical Wingspan target - Explo Frigates.

Freedom of speech lmao.
---
Another American who doesn't realise that his "freedom of speech" doesn't exist. But he's been told he has it so he'll reeeee about it online. You don't have freedom of speech at all. Talk to the police about how you support terrorism or child abuse. Or use your fun, "edgy" language at work. Try to use "freedom of speech" to avoid arrest or save your job. It won't work. 
---
This whole bullshit "freedom of speech" argument is simply a bunch of idiots who are upset their actions can have consequences. Be it online, or real life. 
---
I don't think any game should be a safe space for degenerates. Create your own private discord for that/scream it into the wind/ tell your therapist that you said a bad word and you feel good now. Just don't expect other people to put up with your shit. Gaming is better off without it.
---
I do agree that lowsec can be frustrating for newer players - especially those who's more immediate focus is making isk for advancement in SP / ships that they've never flown before.  However, I don't necessarily agree that it is a worse place for newer players than null.  
---
The main reason I think lowsec is better is the fc to line-member ratio in most lowsec groups.  Giving a new player pointers with the UI and helping them get accustomed to the game takes hours spread over days. Even after years of playing the game, most players will have holes in their understanding of game mechanics. Half of the dialogue that takes place in FW fleets i've lead is just talking about game mechanics / tricks with the UI. This isn't hard to do when there's only 5-10 guys in fleet just casually roaming around the area. 
---
 Newer players that go to null are less likely to get the attention they need in typical pinged fleets (you don't have time to explain how to make bookmarks when trying to marshal 100 men in bombers to kill an enemy super). I suspect many newer players are left to figure things out on their own.  While some may view this challenge as a rite of passage (lol nullsec pvpers are hardy because they had to figure everything out on their own!), my suspicion is that many of these players never actually figure most of the game out - which is why we see some increasingly interesting super fits on zkill. 
---
You're not wrong about the logistical challenges of being a lowsec pvper.  Even if you're not in FW, your sec status is probably garbage.  This will more or less force you to either use hauler alts or, more likely, an alliance shipping service.  This isn't really a challenge unique to lowsec though.  If you're a pilot in null you're _definitely_ going to have to either get a hauler alt or become antiquated with logistics services. 
---
Regarding isk making, you're right that null ratting is pretty dank as far as PvE goes, but for newer players ratting in subcaps, i'd argue that lowsec can actually be more profitable and safe than null. Belt ratting in the right section of 0.2 systems with an appropriately fitted ship will get you a few hundred isk/hr (highly variable from hour to hour) in clone / faction / mordus spawns.  You'll also have local to let you know when hostiles come in system.  The safety of null is the cyno and super umbrella - and if a hunter catches your VNI, you'll be dead before you can be saved.
---
It is correct.
---
Reactive armour hardners will provide up to a 60% single resist....If you take 1 type damage. 30 30 of 2... 20 20 20 if 3 and 15 15 15 15 of all 4 types being applied.
---
Again, not about the ship loss.  I thought you read the whole thing.  I enjoy the grind to bigger and better ships.  The issue came in when i had seen what seems to me like a bad idea stopped me from even acheiving that grind.  The main complaint here is that a core mechanic such as missions lead into this space.  The answer; wait or go elsewhere.  I can grind to l3s in other locations.  The time it takes to get to l4s is the problem; and is a very regional one.  Ive said it quite a few times now.  Im casual, and it is hard to justify paying to play when the same issue is going to innevitably happen again; cant play when i want to because: invasion.  While i still think the mechanic is bad, i was also in a headspace where all of the hours I'd put in lead to one thing; i cant play now without starting over.  I was wrong about that.  You are wrong about my motivations.  I see the mechanic as bad.  It could be refined, but here we are.

lmao assuming im american even tho no one talked about america or any country in general i believe in the concept of freespeech

Ok, I was thinking splitting the invention up by item or something among characters.  Sounds like I should have one that can invent all the things?

Low sec revamping would probably fix a lot of the perceived problems across the entire universe.

It’s pretty bad from an rIsk/reward calculus.

I just found this podcast last week. It’s great! Keep up the good work guys! There’s never enough EVE podcasts to satisfy my ears. And as a wormholer the small gang angle is very interesting. I’m already considering making that shield/neut Nestor as bait lol.
---
Is this 4chan?
---
I dont want you to pay for them.  I enjoy the sense of achievement upon earning them.  Also, touche, that is the one place that question could have gone that i did not consider.  Mostly due to, again, context and the five times i have said that i enjoy the grind.
---
Did you know without blackout you're not gonna find these fights because the Rattlesnake would have warped off when you popped into local.
---
People say this shit without realizing how damn dry null is and how risk adverse the targets are.
---
TBH i hate extra materialization not the basic income aspect.           
---
Like i don't care what player do as long it is a player.         
---
For me even stuff hitting multiboxing is good in long term as it will increase the real player numbers.
---
Lowsec is p good isk wise, decent anomalies, ded and unrated sites, missions including fw4 and L5, asteroid belt clone soldiers, mordus, moons to mine, ice belts, PI, uncontested relic and data sites, ghost sites... My point was that getting to these rewards is a real hassle if you are a new player and don't have the know-how on surviving non-hisec.
---
And judging a book by its cover.
---
I come and go.  And usually delete old shit after a while. Doesn’t make me less connected to what’s going on in game.

Cloaked scanner probes
---
👍
---
You are 100% correct. Between you and I and everyone else in the room ive been thinking this morning about buying a Caiman and doing this with a pirate dread for the novelty, and because of your point, the 12750 cargo space.
---
What do you usually talk about?
---
Look, i assume you are used to being the smart guy in the room, likely are usually, and i appreciate the offer.  I am just trying to help you at this point by showing you that your approach to this whole thing was bad.  Calling bs on someone is not a function of debate.  Debate requires two parties.  Simply shutting people down closes any opportunity for debate.  
---
Trolls use this mechanism a lot, which is why i told you that you were trolling, even if unwittingly.  
---
I know the value of facts.  However when you approach a misconception with the assumption that the other person is just wrong without even trying to understand or extrapolate, you become wrong yourself more often than not.  It is just a bad way of dealing with people.
---
i like turtles
---
Untwist your panties. I specifically have a gripe with mechanics that drive game breaking metas, i didn't complain about quality of life improvements like bookmarks and interface changes. As a side note some of there were also too much though...I got into the game through a guy who was perhaps the best cov ops pilot ever. He quit right after they made probes able to warp themselves. When i asked him why he just said "CCP made my skills obsolete by rolling them into a new user interface that any 3-day old rookie can use". This is the same feeling the general population gets regarding "capital ships online" (because let's be honest, sitting in a cap doesn't mean you're not a noob in the age of injectors, anyone can be a behemoth driving F1 monkey nowadays, with no real knowledge abot the game) and if it comes to the point where CCP is bleeding cash because of it then i'm sorry for you, but you're going to get nerfed sooner or later.
---
You entire argument so far has been "i have been grinding too long for these moving stations that teleport all over the place at an instant, please don't take away their overpowered status and ability to deal damage to every single smaller ship out there", which is something they didn't even have in the first place. 
---
Seems like you've just grown complacent really thanks to changes in the game that solidify your advantage. I think i'm not the one who has to HTFU, you just want your instalock carrier with perfect application even against cruiser sized targets and your HAW dreads that can kill frigates. Well, tough shit. It's unbalanced, it promotes power creep because there's not enough asymmetric counterplay to it and if your only response is "train caps yourself" you'll get called out on it. Repeatedly. And no amount of "sit down" is going to change that. Have fun arguing, cause i can keep replying for ever to arrogant snobs like you.

---
Those parties need to be communicating honestly.
---
So pointing out and clarifying the BS is EXTREMELY important. If we aren't based in reality there is no discussion to be had.
---
Literally any stable fit with a heavy shield tank would work. Go full cap rigs with some flux coils and a cap battery and you permarep x-large booster and permatank like 1k a sec with just t2 modules. For weapons go cruise missiles + gecko. If you pimp it you can even solo C5 sites.
---
Well it generally is Americans who don't understand that there is no such thing as free speech. 
---
Either way, I'm sure you understand my examples of why freedom of speech doesn't exist. Especially amusing are people who cry about free speech when they get banned when they use language the EULA of a game forbids. They signed a contract, just like they do for work, or other aspects of their life, and throw their shit out of the pram when they breach the terms, and have their access revoked, just like they would at work, or in any of the other aspects of their lives.
---
Range is good because it'll keep the alt out of the warp bubble if there is one, the Loki is probably a better bet but is also definitely more expensive.
---

whats the point of crabbing in null if you wont make profits

I got concorded FC, why?  Maybe you shouldn't chain up with people when you aren't at war with them......

Hey... Business is business right???
---
couldn't see anyone in null. came to hisec. still no fights. maybe pirat will
---
You are still just responding to individual pieces of the whole picture.  Again context matters.  What i said after that matters.
---
i see you are solo player/small(irrelevant) team player. In null theres potewntial fights every day that never happen cuz fcs are scared to lose some ships and just do not engage
---
C2? Passive gila is king. Get scanning frigs, rolling bs, maybe a salvage ship and boom easy isk.
---
yes but believe in the idea of free speech is different from the 1st amendment
---
You gonna take screenshots, or come \~\~feed\~\~ fight again?
---
This fleet feels dirty
---
reeeeeeeeeeeeee ?
---
"I feel like i am being left behind as a player" This is your perception within the game because you have chosen to not interact with any other parts of the game until they interacted with you. There are plenty of organizations that will accept alpha status but complaining that you, as a solo player, are not being catered to in an MMO is a perception problem. IMO go play a game like NMS, ED or X3 they all have the ability for you to never have to interact with other people.

No it's fine. Let them listen to the pvpers. Watch what happens. Things are already shifting towards a future they won't like, but don't say that or they'll downvote you as if it's a magic trick to make the truth go away.

Cynabal with a web and a neut is a really good option
---
Miss the part about not being skilled for ratting?  Also, give me an example of a ship that will shield tank 1k/s.  Bet you the build costs hundreds of mil.  Im doing sub 10m/hour currently.  Working on getting there was what led to the frustration.
---
This guy knows
---
In which V0LTA tries to be relevant by shouting "blue donut" and dropping troll citadels.
---
Someone should probably remind these guys that the last several groups to try this strategy (CO2, Triumverate and Black Legion) are now all vassals to blue donut alliances. Or at least what's left of them are.
---
So we should split our gang into 2 and have one part burn 8 jumps to the other side of this specific ansiblex? We would literally need to be able to foresee the future that some freighters are going to move through THIS specific JB at this specific time.   
---
Also, camping them is useless because they are always on grids with keepstars, so even if you tackle something, if you did not bring 20+ bombers (well technically 40 since you need 20 on each side) you will not kill anything in a timely manner before you get DDed or dropped or blobbed.  
---
You shouldn´t be able to jump when pointed/bubbled. Period.  
---
Also, you shouldn´t be able to anchor them on grid with a citadel.
---
Omg tru
---
On the other hand, somebody losing a bunch of BPOs in a crazy-ass self-reliant nomad carrier playstyle is exactly the kind of thing I want to read about on /r/eve after it happens.

Calm down satan.

No sane pvpers that wants a fight bubble gates like that lmao

Would 425 med acs work with dual webs or should I stick with 220s?
---
You are not wrong on that first point.  Later on in this thread it was pointed out to me, and i agree.  I simply was used to my region, and have worked hard to carve out my own space.  Going to play another game is a natural response, however leads to the death of MMOs.  I think the invasion mechanic needs work, and fear that due to this, more people will be lost.  However, it is not unreasonable to just go carve out a different area for the day or so during invasion.  That was a fact that i had missed while posting.
---
Have petitioned camps before, when hundreds of drones and cans literally froze my screen up, was told basically it's valid mechanics.
---
Alright, well, instead of going on and on about the same issue (I see the mechanic as fine, but whatever), I've got a solution for you: just grind the faction standings. If you're at 5 standing with say, Caldari State, you can get all of the level 4 missions for corporations belonging to Caldari.
---
I did it with my trading alt to lower Broker Taxes. Takes about 10 hours to get them high enough for level 4 missions. Follow this guide:
---
https://forums.eveonline.com/t/faction-standing-repair-plan-aka-the-plan/8008
---
And you'll be able to do all of the missions for a faction (so level 4 missions in 2-3 regions).
---
We live in Stain. You are wrong. Stop trying to push your imaginary “small groups are hurting” BS just so you can get local back.
---
What the fuck is this even?
---
Why use bots when kids exist?
---
Ahh lowsec, the place that shits on your security status (an outdated mechanic) and prevents you going to highsec ever again by -5. Brilliant anti-fun mechanic, pay up for expensive tags or grind for years to repair it!
---
&gt;fights 80 vs 280 with the enemy having a dozen or so logi shy than we have actual rokhs lol idiot feeders.
---
&gt;lmao fucking pussies won't fight 80 vs 400 lmao
---
&gt;i bet pirat would fight and totally not just dock up their 3 leshaks and 2 nestors to 5 drakes, that has never happened in the history of eve, I repeat pirat are a hardcore guild and have never docked 5 hg slave bs up to 5 drakes.

&gt;uhhhh yeah guys the other guys brought 120 feroxes and we only have 100 so we are standing down

The furst line implies the second line, because they are pretending to be a threat by using local, without local afk campers aren't pretending to be anything. One leads to the other. As for the number of pvpers it's literally something you made up so provide proof.
---
you're like the saltiest motherfucker I've come across in a while
---
cynos were already indirectly nerfed when fatigue was added. furthermore, you can just kill the cyno ship and ruin the whole operation or warp away before people jump
---
cynos have not been touched because there is no balance issue.

1 orca alt, 1 viator alt, pve/pvp alt(s), and 2-3 cloaky alts to sit off wh's with 'look at' zoomed in on holes for max noise if someone jumps in while you clear every site in system.

 Viator alt can double as one of the hole watchers, orca alt needs to be safed somewhere for temporarily decloaking to use.

Wasnt it fun the last time around tho?

You started it by directly insulting me

PIRAT sucks at pvp. We fucking dunked them (and their [terrible FC](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77922369/)) yesterday during stratop without breaking a sweat.

On a serious note, red koolaid is best koolaid.

Thank you.

No I'm in GoonSwarm and I'm incredibly surprised and disappointed that a small gang wormhole alliance didnt fight the 3 biggest coalitions in the game, like wtf, i wanted to get a good fight in my ferox.
---
so you have a guy in your corp with years and he still can't figure out why that loki fit is awful... thats a complete failure of anyone in wingspan to do any teaching.

You don't need all that in a C2.

Yes. You need all the science skills to invent all the things, and they should be at IV at least.

bro quit crying i cant swim, I'll drown

I'm in GoonSwarm and I'm incredibly surprised and disappointed that a small gang wormhole alliance picked a fight with the 3 biggest coalitions in the game, like wtf

wow only needed 150 more people than them

Now you  know 😅

You need at least 3 people to circlejerk fam

I reply omg your tearszzddshhshshshsnszjjsjs to every post making light hearted fun of my alliance, haha I laugh to myself in my bedroom. I have many friends.

You just need to know the right people.

Yeah make that 2 cloaky orcas
---
Imagine your reason for playing being mining.
---
How horrible.
---
Thats the plan then.  Thank you.
---
ur wrong, downvoted
---
seek help, friend
---
Why cloaky orca in a WH? What do you use it for?
---
Judging by the state of the Jita 4-4 undock, I'd say we are several orders of magnitude short of that...
---
If the purpose is to cause lag - not allowed.
---
miners believe the game would die without them
---
In reverse order:
---
If you could not anchor them on grid with a citadel, then people would simply use bridging Titans to move the Freighters. They would actually be even safer than they are now. And if that option was removed, then people would escort them with an Apex force on standby. No matter what, you are going to have to plan in advance and work hard to interrupt this kind of operation.
---
I don’t really have a problem with “cannot take the Ansiblex while pointed or bubbled.” It adds some good risk to using them. But if that happened, I would like to be able to set the jump cost payment to “always autopay.” Otherwise the gate itself delays you for a tick when you try to use it. That would require the camper to decloak and bubble before you landed on the gate. But the user shouldn’t automatically get blocked by the annoying pop up interface every single time.
---
If you don’t want to bring the right tools for the job, then you don’t get to kill freighters full of billions in moongoo. I don’t have a problem with this at all. You are acting like a “press button get phat killmail” type when you complain about having to camp both sides of a gate and wait for an opportunity. Eve rewards patience. It used to punish instant gratification seekers even more.
---
I’ve had someone camp my Titan move op for days on end until I finally outsmarted him and got past the choke point. I have camped a 6/10 or 10/10 an entire weekend waiting for a dude to finally attempt it in his 3b ISK Tengu. I would gladly watch a dude and gather intel on him for a week or two in order to kill a few freighters full of moongoo.
---
Will be honest, in the beginning it is hard. It really helps to start with a core of around 5 pilots total. Find a group of guys/gals who believe in your goals, or share the same mindset of how to play EVE. A group of 5 is the sweet number to do anything, imo. Then make a forum post, /r/evejobs post, and hangout in the recruitment channel and pick up extra people. Don't accept anyone, but at the same time you can't afford to be picky. Eventually recruiting becomes pretty easy as people will come to you, and you'll be able to be more selective.
---
why u still responding then
---
Where can I find a list of fits?

In particular I am trying to get a Drake Navy Issue fitted for 4/10 DED complex runs.
---
I think we are just in an eternal shit posting pendulum where you try way too damn hard and i don't try at all.
---
I though this would be some solo piloting coolness, but instead it was as bad as a dabbing fucking skeleton and footage of bashing structures
---
With the amount of data points they make available to the playerbase. I'm confident they could see much more than that. They could probably see the average number of clicks per player login against the number of ships dying.
---
Oh man HoMM3 is the best. Though could you contract your Eve stuff to MechaJeb Kerman on your way out, please?
---
There are thousands of try hard elite PVP corps with doctrines and homework assignments for people to join. There's only one meme delivery role play corp.
---
just sad to see, null sec shouldn't be this aligned :/
---
To be fair it was only 2 until we actually fought 80 vs 280 then Goons were called in.
---
Sounds good but Goon Legion Please Ignore...
---
The gate to hosec is that way -&gt;
---
Non-fw lowsec will eat you alive and spit you back to highsec a few times until you find something better to do or until  you stuck on its throat. Then you can become the (cloaky) hunter/hotdropper that killed you previously. Or you can die to boredom if you venture far out enough.
---
The shortcut is Shift + whatever F key is the module. There is also a shortcut to overload entire rack, check in in shortcut settings.
---
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeehhhhh calling v0lta a small gang alliance is really stretching it
---
Goons have been a part of the deal since the end of the Tapi - PH war. This is the content your alliance chose

Your joke is camouflaged by a lack of proper use of the mysterious comma.

Use the same email for all of them. Naming convention is easy too, grab a baby name book and click randomize on the last name. Thats even if you dont just go with three numbers random lastname next.  
---
The logistics of it would of course be a nightmare. Hell just to extract it all you would have to stagger them so they came out like 85-100 a day for extraction. My 20 pilot farm takes me 2-3 hours to get all logged in, extractors moved used injectors moved and logged off. A better computer and more standardized routine would speed that up but it would still be more than a full time job a week to manage the farm of 2500.
---
I'm willing to be you never FCd
---
That's a good point, I have another fit with arrays instead of sebos which would probably make more sense. I do use the lows for align time right now.
---
Chori/Cable Uta is RMTing harder than the Chinese VNI botters though. So there is some resemblance.
---
Reshipping and storage without any structures.
---
Totally correct. Only drop when there is 100% certainty that you will have enough supers to carry out the player versus player engagement. It is colossally stupid to do anything but ensure the absolute win.
---
That hurt to read
---
Hey that's me yelling....
---
there is a way to auto-travel right?  
---
It is slower than manual travel, iirc, but I forgot how to activate it.
---
i dont understand this. all the players and even big fc's complaining about a lack of content. complaining that structrue grinds are complete aids. but yet they all blue each other and bore their members to death with exact those aids grinds.
---
like cmon. pick a side, generate some content...
---
your name being in local is delayed until you talk. you are assuming that "delayed" can only refer to "a unit of time until you appear" rather than "until you perform a specific action". if they called it disabled local, then you would not be able to talk in local at all and you would not be able to subscribe to the channel.
---
Nah, Eve is fine. It's just a particularly lazy style of gameplay that is dying. Those players will either suck it up or bail out to hisec (where they belong). The rest of us are having a great time using the blackout to hunt each other, set up gate camps, and generally cause mayhem.
---
Thats not at all what I said? There's a difference between having doctrines and making sure your players know the basics of pvp. Anyone that fits a loki like that doesn't know the 1st thing about pvp, and if its been years and noone in the corp has thought to mention anything that either means noone in the corp knows anything about pvp either, or you just actively try to be bads.
---
Just wanted to say, I admire the way you owned your mistakes, and showed you also learned from it. You'll go far with that attitude, not only in Eve. Better (woah)man than I possibly am, and better than most, good on you.
---
Everybody should screw with the big guys. If more people did they probably wouldn’t be so big. The complacency is what allowed it to happen to begin with lol
---
Shouldn't have been fighting in scram range
---
YTA.  You poked the nest.  Don't complain when bees come out of it.
---
Yes, it fine time to drop and kill:-D and to hurt crabs)
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o996VUv4qP4
---
Our experiences are that its objectively better. Zkill represents the entirety of eve, but our play style was buffed and *our* zkillboard for *our* corp reflects that.
---
You are right. It can never be fact. And isn’t causality.
---
However what we can confirm and many other groups like this that the kills for groups like ours has gone up in a way that is positively *correlated* by the blackout changes. 
---
So maybe this one instance *could* have happened without blackout. But our overall experience that has been amazing since blackout has undoubtedly been enhanced from CCPs changed. And that is a fact.
---
There is no balance in playstyle. It is more risky to try and efficiently make money in highsec with a blinged incursion or level 4 ship than it is to use a capital to farm isk in null, at much greater rates.
---
&gt;but yet they all blue each other and bore their members to death with exactly those aids grinds.
---
Remember how cancerous it was when the big alliances were competing for market citadels?
---
Man, Bashing highsec scrubs is fun, I got to write Shitty Romeo and Juliet love stories about starcrossed space pilots that met while bashing a structure, their love forbidden because they were enemies with each other.
---
hypothetically, would loading one weapon with different ammo, just to proc a drop in resist, ever be worth it? Basically, just wondering if the 30% drop from 60% (single) to 30%/30% (dual resist) would make an impact on say the DPS if you have 1 out of 6 rails firing a different ammunition? Or one drone? Would the drop in raw DPS just not ever really make up for 30% less resist on main damage type?
---
YTA
---
You really need to watch people when they warp...so you know where they go...
---
I'm willing to bet I have FCed more than you have kills and losses. lol
---
And again, to use your logic from earlier, you can’t causily you can disprove that because all rattle deaths stay the same that our experience with this particular rattle wasn’t effected by blackout. Just because the stats indicate one thing, doesn’t mean the individual instance was one way or another. Just like how you said earlier our individual instance can’t be taken for a causal relationship that can be extrapolated to blackout as a whole.
---
You act like some kind of stats major here but you are clearly a retard lmao.
---
mad cause bad
---
cancerous? dont tell me shooting structures with 300guys makes more fun than all of them shooting each other..
---
as far as i remember, ppl had alot fun shooting each other and brawling it out in dirtcheap ships. atleast judging by reddit threads/posts
---
his wrong?
---
Thank God the subcap blue mwds don't have hefty cap penalties, I guess. Heh.
---
I love this, I've always dreamed of doing a playstyle like this and being near self-sufficient while operating in dangerous territory. Post some AARs when you get to flying it!
---
Use the map to set a destination, then undock, and press the A button to the left of your hp bars.
---
Its called Autopilot, and it will warp you 15km from each point and max speed burn you the rest of the way to jump/dock. It will not activate prop mods, though you always can if you have it up on a second monitor. You will die if you aren't in high sec or are at war.
---
"someone brought small stuff, I dropped a call on them... ... They dropped a cap on my cap, so I was pissed"
---
I'm glad you lost your Titan dingleberry.
---
Big lol at living in wh space without a sctructure in 2k19 xD 1bil for a damn astra c'mon.
---
If ur afraid someone will pop it, can always pay Holesale to defend it for you.
---
I looks at incoming damage and shifts to that. If you do like 800DPS pure thermal a have a few kinetic damage drones doing 80dps it will shift more to thermal resistance and kinetic. 
---
Now what this guy could have done was shoot thermal until the gardener would be full thermal resist and then reload to explosive for lots of damage. 
---
I am not sure if it would have been enough in this case though. He doesn't have any damage mods.
---
Ironic
---
Space is dangerous
---
you forgot wh space
---
Yea, it's where all the content is headed.
---
Keep the blackout! I love it
---
tbh the "dropping" player count is just people logging off their bots, and bot-aspirant types logging off. We have enough NPCs in the game, we don't need more.
---
How do you figure?
---
Null has done more roams and PvP the last few weeks than in years. You sir, are wrong. You just don't want to do the hard work.
---
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/147670/aw-some-coleslaw/
---
Saltonia is that you?
---
I can assume from your comment that... nope.
---
is this the new response meme to dumb posts? I like it.
---
Great episode, and I agree that I am more engaged in nullsec now with blackout. Getting some cool fights and love the mystery of EVE again.
---
If a pilot isn't actively losing ships, how would anyone possibly know how they're fitting ships?
---
so have a few blues shoot you with nearly no damage to get the attacker counter to go above the threshold and remove that debuff thing
---
Structure bashes aren't *that* fun when it's 100% whack-a-mole
---
LoL please post that.  I promise to Upvote
---
Haha yes you literally did say that you were upset that they counter dropped your cap after you dropped a cap on subcaps because you feel that they "escalated to an unfair level". Lord. You were in your own blue donut too...
---
No, it should not. T3 serves a different purpose than T2. T2 is specialized. It should be better at what it does than T3. That's the entire point of T2 -- to be **THE BEST** at what it does.
---
No it's an angry goon poster, check his comment history. This is his attempt of making fun of chori's post but its such a horrible post that you think it is actually against you.
---
You can start doing this much sooner and cheaper using a Deep Space Transport. Carry a modest fleet between NPC stations, find deals between regional markets; rat and explore; learn local politics, etc.
---
The aditional benefit of using a DST is it doesn't require a cyno alt to use. Because what's a nomad if they're not on the road?
---
Just don't forget to install a new clone when you finally dock :O
---
It's because he dropped a cap in blue space on roaming subcaps.
---
He was jumping into a fight he couldn't lose and then got upset when he could lose.
---
Oh christ its almost as if i know this and its fun to laugh at you?
---
I certainly will.
---
Haha Guys, I was sucking a dick and I got called gay. But jokes on them, I'm really heterosexual and I was just doing it to troll them hahaha they actually believe I'm gay now lmao.
---
Havent played in like 2 years wtf is that ship
---
Should so get a group together and do this!!
---
Yeah no implants is the only downside but the ability to ping around is great
---
For real dude seek help
---
So does she gank your haulers aswell?
---
YEAH THE BOYS
---
No, I pay my CODE Licensing fees like a good little capsuleer.
---
Places 0.1% tax havens in highsec to ~~give the community a cheaper alternative, not leeching~~ keep the promise Vily couldn't.
---
Surprised and having to shitpost every time your structures are being taken down by the entities behind the TTT.
---
True but i still think no local is a good thing for Eve but they should rework the way people farm in null sec, anom ratting is borring AF people farm them because it's a low risk/reward but now for subcapital farmer the risk is highter than the reward, you can't afk farm anymore &gt; people stop farming / playing  
---
that don't stop the capital farm under a umbrella but smaller alliance in null sec are fucked, can't protect themselve soo they just don't farm&gt;die if their people don't farm elsewhere (FW, explo, H-S abyssal....)   
---
if the no-local in null sec become a thing in the futur they should probably re-do entierely the farm in null sec, permanent incursion ? WH anomaly in Nullsec? (could force bigger alliance to spread) triglav invasion? IDK but anom ratting/mining just don't worth the risk anymore (a least for a small alliance)  
---
(and i farm in factionnal so it's not a complaint i don't own any capital and i don't even have a "perfect" VNI)
---
Not gonna lie, never expected Gevlon to be the prescient.
---
Will you light my cyno 4 me?
---
An unholy alliance has been created. The death bells ring for hisec.

Rent free

---
Yeah precisely that 😊
---
this is not a dumb post
---
No u
---
how do you know im in goons hmmmmmmmm
---
No one seems to notice the highsec system in the picture. The profits of the Test trading tower in Perimeter are split between, and defended by Imperium, Test and Horde. That is what this is. Removing competition. At a certain point people grew tired of highsec bashing, and that's when the profits were split. Test took it from Horde initially.
---
We came up with a name I think it was "The Beans and the Bees" where the Son of a Starlord and A Princess of a Wealthy rorqual pilot met while bashing some Highsec Structure. We didn't really write anything but the story would absolutely end with everyone getting Boson'd
---
wItHoUt InDuStRiAlIsTs YoU pVpErS wOuLdNt HaVe ShIpS
---
Honestly just delete pvp
---
So basically you will be earning 6bil just to plex 3 accounts, 2 bil/month each.          
---
I think you found new job at 0 (your local currency)/ hour.              
---
GJ i think.
---
Goons don't fight?
---
I’m saying can I make 6+ bill lol my bad for not thinking of that
---
You're irrelevant...
---
Tbf they wouldn't take my character because not enough solo wh kills. I went hunting in wh for 3-4 days saw 2 transport ships I just missed the bump on and burned out.
---
Came back to k-space for blackout and got kills immediately.
---
I know, but it shouldnt be a thing.
---
flying a cowardmobile is the wrong choice in the first place, Rag is a much better titan overall. Even a Komodo only really excels in 150 titanvtitan brawls where it can actually survive a retarded # of doomsdays. While you save for your new one change your skills to projectiles :P Missiles are a god awful weapon system, especially capital missiles
---
except they will be significant damage no matter who hits you with it and if you get hit with too many you die and or have pre applied damage making you able to be killed quicker.  You could make the damage unreppable by this specific weapon to prevent that.  Not seeing a downside lol
---
Of course business is business, but what are you actually trying to say?
---
I’m trying to say.... that..... business..... is business??? Lol
---
Peak EU and US time zones on a Sunday used to be 31,000 + so yeah &lt;25,000 on a sunday would be pretty shitty.
---
yikes.
---
again, that doesn't matter. CCP can see what you're doing.
---
&gt;  The death bells ring for hisec.
---
A few highsec structures is so far from the death bells tolling for high sec, it's hilarious.
---
No the Nyx died cause it was utterly shit-fit and we were able to keep it tackled and had just enough inhibitors to keep real help out of system just long enough for  u/jeffraider to kill it.
---
The barbarian hordes being displaced from their hearthlands and invading civilization is a tale has old has history.
---
I don't need to, cyno alt :-)
---
with that setup, you can make the 6 bil to plex all 3 accounts but it will keep you as busy as if you did a bit of extra hours in your job or took a virtual assistance gig on oDesk or something. it will become a job or sorts. 
---
but if it makes you happy... go for it!
---
&gt; No one seems to notice the highsec system in the picture.
---
Noone who? I'd venture most of us notice it, we think it's BS that groups like goons have actively worked so hard to remove content from nullsec, that they're driven to attacking things in highsec just to further safe profits.
---
NTA, you're not the villain, they are andh ave proved it many times in the past?
---
If you're going all technical here you are logged in before you launch your client. You log in when you're entering username and password. 
---
Maybe you shouldn't actually comment before you know what login means.
---
You would have never got their if everyone warped out because local and intel.
---
TL:DR in Eve no one knows your there
---
Oh of course!!! No disagreement from me on that point.
---
lmao, IMO CCP is shit, that doesn't mean they fucked up this time
---
This is quite literally the blue doughtnut from nullsec.
---
you spelled EUTZ primetime wrong
---
What?! Could it really be?
---
No?  That was awesome, do that more!
---
That's awesome. Hearing stuff like this is super encouraging &lt;3
---
Never forget brave trying to drop dreads on a 5 man frigate gang I was in on in HED.
---
Not sure what they wanted to accomplish.
---
I would suggest real job, it would be more efficient. 
---
Also I think managing PL in 3 accounts and 3 chars in each would take around hour each day and eventually it would be same as doing virtual boring sh.. job.
---
100% this, then they get mad at high sec for their own stupid choices and act all haughty about it even though they did it to themselves.  Its amazing the hypocrisy.
---
Eh, you're right, it's worse than just dumb, but calling it what it is would yield cries of 'that's ableist', so we'll leave it at dumb.
---
At least from tests perspective pirat is blue. I felt unbelievably dirty when I realized that but then I realized that the difference between PPD and pirat was that pirat are better at what they do.
---
Evictus best alliance
---
I've always felt like lowsec is one of the harder places to be as a newbie. Some of my points overlap with yours, but I'm going to list them anyway.
---
1) In lowsec it's harder to be useful in the usual newbie roles. Gate-guns eat smaller ships alive but are a non-issue to organized and more expensive setups. Interceptors and tackle frigates are much less useful in lowsec compared to nullsec because of that. 
---
2) No bubbles encourages the use of implant sets, which increases the gap between older and newer players. When you're fighting a punisher in your punisher and the other guy has a set of high-grade slaves and you don't, he's probably going to win.
---
3) Losing security status requires you to either buy tags every so often or never go to highsec on your main again. Also once you lose most of your security status, the gate-gun mechanics that were already more punishing to newer players become one-sided.
---
4) There is no viable form of isk making available for newer players when you aren't in FW. Lv5 missions are incredible, but they require a lot of investment to start. All other forms of isk making in lowsec are more dangerous and less rewarding than what you can do in nullsec or wormholes. 
---
I would say it is much better for a new player to go to nullsec, learn the game, get some initial wealth and some independent sources of isk and *then* think about moving to lowsec.
---
you mean still is? Kappa
---
Lowsec is just bad for making isk, regardless of how new you are. You can grind fw missions for good isk, i guess, but outside of that its nearly impossible. So if a new player goes there, and doesn't get told specifically how to start grinding the good missions, then he will have a very hard time making any money. Hisec is a little less reward, but a lot less risk, and null is more risk but also a lot more reward. Wormholes have different risk, if you are careful its almost completely safe, but you kind of need a good battleship to really make isk, so between that and the need for alts it isn't really new player friendly
---
As i have said before - 
---
 
---
"The security status is such a shitty mechanic, it only affects lowsec players. HS bears don't attack people there as it would mean they get concordokken'd. Code autists don't care, but they don't really matter because how hard is it to just train a new catalyst. Nullbears don't get sec status hit for agression, and constant anomaly krabbing just raises their sec status. WH spooky nerds don't take sec status hits but don't gain any either so whatever sec status they have remains forever. For lowsec, fw players engage their enemies free of penalties, only the pirates get fucked. Sure you can train up an alt that has 0.00 sec and does your hisec business, but it's a bit of a chore."
---
Honestly volta you should start asking for donations like code does to continue the war and just keep fighting outnumbered and see where ya get.  Can be fun anyway.
---
This guy fucks.
---
your a dumb post
---
I support local in wormholes :o
---
Loved it as always. Can’t wait to hear more.
---
Really enjoyed your video. Was getting a bit tired of all the faction warfare solo shit, but this was really interesting. Also thanks for sharing the fit in the end, that was a nice bonus.
---
Give him a break, it's Wingspan. A bunch of newbie solo players who clearly don't talk to each other ever.

I always liked  Nouvelle Rouvenor Hero :  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXO6zXNd\_yM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXO6zXNd_yM)
---
Wow and I thought Amak Boma posts were confusing
---
Agree.  "don't do anything, we can't win againt them."
---
Ok, I'll throw my thorax at them and trade it for their sabres.  Fuck doing nothing.
---
I thought you were smart, I guess I'm dumb
---
This is funny
---
What? Since when?
---
You're spreading out too much.
---
Yes, you can absolutely make enough ingame to pay for your plex if you're dedicated, skilled, or lucky. (The more of the first two you have the less of the last you need.)
---
But you have to ask yourself "ok, why do I have 3 accounts doing 3 different things?"
---
If one isn't paying for itself, why is a 2nd one being used?
---
Pick **one** single activity that pays for itself, minmax that, and then expand from there.
---
Mining is unlikely to plex your account (or any number of accounts) unless you're doing some rorqual shit in nullsec. Which, at the moment, might not be a great idea.
---
What did you expect would happen?
---
What a nice Xenon K :)
---
&lt;3
---
Dont log out, just alt tab and every 10 minutes or so tell the guy in local how angry you are at him. Maybe 15 minutes or so. Let him do that all day while you browse reddit or something. He has to be active afaik, you can be semi afk while shedding fake salt making him waste most of his day.
---
A booster can do the trick if the boosher does not get scrammed
---
I was just clarifying your bad clarification
---
Looks at flair...
---
No, test doesn't.  Per the head diplo slurs are not banned so long as you arent specifically targeted by them.  In that same no politics thread he said that he would be ok with nazi shit on the forums if they werent based in germany.
---
If we had an explicit ban do you think dharen would still be sitting around fleet 6 regularly dropping the hard r like an edgy 7th grader?
---
That's a lot. Seems easier just to call it Serenity.
---
Amen 🥰
---
IL-OL1! :P
---
Would you mind posting some STLs?
---
I wish that war had never ended.
---
I hear Tishu is recruiting.
---
I am a director of my corp. While my scope on alliance level is very limited (racism is dealt with quickly on ally discord), I'm cracking down on blatant in-corp sexism and racism and deal with the people accordingly. My corporation was founded under the mindset to embrace diversity of gameplay and diversity of people.
---
And yes, political topics are coming up from time to time, and while we may disagree on topics, we still have a debate culture in place.
---
grrr hat
---
Yet suit IS right, do you know the top speed of a porpoise btw ?
---
Since recently? Pretty sure zkb is back now.
---
And dumb speed
---
Maybe, JUST maybe, that was the entire idea of Eve. I like the idea of being behind on numbers and still come out on top. THAT is the challenge. Not lolwut let's CC myself into a titan and get along with the people that spend 2 years skilling into one. 
---
If you are a pure newbro group or a very small group, then maybe JUST maybe you have zero rights to own an entire region or constellation and you will have to work for it like everybody else.
---
There is no comunal fitting repository I'm afraid, your best bet is to look at zkillboard, look up the Drake Navy and see what other people tend to use.
---
My favorite will always be: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6htcLwR5jE
---
They’re talking about the bullsec blackout of local, not zkillboard.
---
Chimera was like the capital ship mascot befor eall those titans got into play.
---
Need the Southpark Mormon episode meme template here
---
Nein.
---
What's the point of the orca though?
---
I can't imagine any reason to bring it with you into the chain. You can just refit off a depot if you want to, blue loot is small enough to fit in whatever krabby boat you use and I don't really see any need to bring reships down the chain with you.
---
I also suspect legacy code. Can't remove POS code without removing local XD. It would also remove strain on the servers, 64 bit client suspiciously rolling out soon? I think it was a bunch of things at once, and my tinfoil hat can only be wrapped so tight.
---
I'm loving the blackout
---
Did not know. I would have guessed the Archon with how popular the slowcat doctrine was.
---
Tbh I don't think that volta has needed donations for a long long time...
---
Petipede :P
---
Oh lol
---
Also price* jeeze, you can lose 5 T3C for one black ops
---
if they are so rich, maybe should try with keepstar next time
---
Can't you pull bounty payouts from fleet reports?
---
They want general feedback, evolving gameplay and how players utilize/adapt to the blackout. Login numbers mean nothing, the lesser bots get logged in, the better it is for the game.
---
/r/ihadastroke
---
You should not try to plex your account with in-game isk for the first year. Find something fun to do (and people to do it with). Its all about having people to chat with on comms, jabber, discord, etc. The game itself is kinda sucky as a singleplayer game. Actually not "kinda" but "***really***". Its the people-interactions that make it fun.
---
Yea I have a fun little Corp that’s helped me and explain everything I just like being self sufficient in games and have fun doing it mining doesn’t rlly bother me too much
---
And we are now at 30,227
---
same
---
And its only temporary?

You need to run the database in a different container. See [https://github.com/exodus4d/pathfinder/wiki/Database](https://github.com/exodus4d/pathfinder/wiki/Database) for how to configure Pathfinder's DB connection and the spin up another MySQL container: [https://hub.docker.com/\_/mysql](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql)
---
Ah, yeah, I was just wondering if it was even correct in assuming forcing the shield to switch/compensate for more resist than needed would allow you to do more damage than say, just full thermal missiles or something. Had a hard time figuring out the math for it.

Hi
---
It’s on for an indefinite period of time. They may or may not change their mind.
---
Really? Subcaps are balanced? Okay fine come bring your Eagle fleet then. Or Ishtar fleet. Or your random t1 battleship fleet. You will get deleted by the current meta. The subcap balance was better yours ago before CCP did the entire "tiericide" bullcrap and changed bonusses on hulls. Minmatar used to be fast, a bit less dps and even less tank. Amarr the exact opposite. Caldari and Gallente would trade blows on certain hulls. Then railguns got buffed to insanity. 
---
The story of damage application based on hull size has been done so fucking many times already and why it is bad too. In case you failed to miss it, we have frigates, cruisers and battleships as the size classes. But every class has same sized hull type called destroyers, battlecruisers and.....nothing. So yeah, as you can see drawing that line is going to cause a myriad of shit. Just carriers are not going to delete your BS fleet, neither will just dreads. Fighters are easy targets, dreads need to go into siege to be applying so you just boosh out of their gun range. Drawing a hard line will push the game more into a capital warfare style (why bother with subcaps if they can't break capitals) and just bring enough faxes. By your logic a Titan would not be able to track a carrier because the class below a titan is a super. Does that make much sense to you? No single solution to this game is this simple. Ever. 
---
Your cyno suggestion is even more short sighted. Fine, I will not bring a frigate cyno. Let me bring this bricktanked command ship cyno and place it 250km off the grid, if I want to. Or just on 0 and have the first 2 capitals light a backup cyno. 
---
All your suggestions are in favour of the attacker. This has another downside. So I just pulled this entire region out of my ass with this \~50 dudes in my small alliance. Now I get attacked by a bigger alliance. See where this is going with your suggestions? We have 0 counters left because everything is based off x cant hit y and dumb shit like that.
---
If not enough people are running them, then no proving conduits appear.
---
yeah CCP should fix that, it is not so hard lol. It is really annoying that gate stops spawning around 13:00 Eve time, excluding US and east asian players from that content.
---
When u look at their max form vs a "just something to do" fleet roams of the coalitions. Ya. Most of the times FCS in imperium are pinging going "only the first XX pilots can come" other wise they get like 150 for a "fun roam"
---
Omen, omen navy, fit for speed and meme on frigates who try to chase, osprey navy is similar. Can also use ashimmu with long point-web, dual nos or neut nos if you're concerned about other cruisers.
---
If you think 3m pi each day and 20m mining each hour per character
---
Otherwise I suggest you do something else, assuming you live in hghsec
---
It won't be fun when you have to be mining most hours of your free time just to stay omega
---
Self-sufficient is boring, I could've never earned two titans and two faxes (with all the SP needed to fly those on four characters), if I tried to be self-sufficient. I would've quit long ago. Instead I bought ore others mined and turned it into t2 modules that I sold in jita (and someone else moved it there for me), and I used structures someone else had anchored for my alliance, all the while I spent the days on comms on a mumble server someone else had set up, and I did fleets someone else FC'd and scouted, while I just did the logistics role of space-healing. Relying on other people makes a whole lot easier and a lot more fun. You get a lot more out of it too (I turned out two titans in two years, with ever less effort, haven't mined or ratted in a year now).
---
They where trying to be nomadic, the tower was to park the orca when mining.
---
Read contracts twice, expect all other people (even your friends) to fuck with you for fun, prepare to loose your ship if you undock it!
---
PvP is enabled everywhere and all the time.
---
Read many Guides and watch content creator on YouTube etc. - stay with Destroyers and train into a Hecate or any other T3Ds!
---
don't fly what you can't afford to loose!
---
It literally says thrasher.
---
Lol then why the constant meme posts on Reddit? Sure seems like a relevance play.
---
Mine in highsec all the plants will be in null
---
Proving conduits are basically nonexistent in us and au tz
---
In that case, bump pi income per character to 20m/day
---
person who didn't participate detected
---
I'm sorry I only speak freedomland, language of cancerous comms and limitless slosh ops.
---
no, you?
---
hahahaha. you are funny man. I like you. THIS GUY FUCKS
---
+1 this is my fav.
---
Use the /s next time :p
---
I prefer to call it what it is: Goons and pets.
---
Well then you'd have to cover the cost of SP injectors for that harsh T3 loss mechanic...
---
"Cought" ushra'kan is recruting also "cought"
---
How do you fit all the ammo? I copied that fit in the video exactly, minus the abyssal stuff, and it cant fit that much ammo
---
wat?
---
"EVE is a PvP game, whenever you undock you consent to PvP!"
---
"Let's also implement pseudo-permanent penalties for engaging in PvP!"
---
I don't really see the purpose of security status from a gameplay perspective. Given how much emphasis the playerbase places on non-consensual PvP as a part of the game, shouldn't we be encouraging it rather than punishing people for it?
---
Yeah, it needs to go. It's an ancient mechanic thy punishes you for fighting in a space type that's meant for fighting. Madness.
---
mmmk
---
Or fly a Procurer? The mining barge designed to tank shit?
---
Below the Asteroids is forever in my heart
---
So they just need to fix the API to get rid of zkb.
---
as a general rule, i assume anyone who makes a post (not a comment, but a post) about anything that happened in game did the thing in game for attention
---
which like
---
i do pretty much everything i do in game, i'm just trying to get senpai to notice me you know?
---
Damn I wish I could have been there for it that sounds fucking epic! And good on you being a good sport, and looking at what happened objectively, thats how you get better! Sorry for your loss, but man you lost it the right way!
---
CCPlease: Make the upcoming small upwell structures allow for this kind of gameplay. I want an anchor I can deploy to allow me to leave a carrier behind temporarily.
---
1. it was cancerous to participate because literally anything in that much tidi fucking sucks. if you've ever wanted to feel like eve was an obligation and not a pastime, join a fleet that's going into a tidi fight  
---
2. it was also cancerous because jita and perimeter were completely unusable for uninvolved parties during all of the fights
---
I'd like to see a little bit of lowsec in every npc system.  
---
Essentially, you have sphere around every star encompassing the inner systems.  Beyond that is the heliopause.  Attempting to warp beyond this point prompts the player to accept the risk of travelling to unregulated space.  In the depths of space there are unplumbed resource and pve content, but no Concord protection, and limited factional npc protection.  
---
Back when we used to hear talk of infinite asteroid belts, I always thought it would be neat to have a beacon with a safezone radius around it.  Go beyond the green line, and you take your chances for wealth and glory.   
---
With the innovation of diamond NPCs, new options for having roving "town guards" seemed promising.  With the favoritism mechanics of the new npcs, new behavior for sentry turrets likewise seemed to promise new possibilities.  Anywhere you see diamond npcs or their installations, you should have some sort of faction-based security response.
---
I think the next intermediate step would be NPCs deploying citadels, and exhibiting persistent behavior towards players.  In lower security space, the boundaries should withdraw significantly, and security should simply be less.
---
cause its reddit and this place is trashier than sort's back yard?
---
I legitimately don’t think anything could be trashier than anything remotely related to Sort.
---
And that still constitutes ignoring the point.
---
Also, I'd like us all to take a moment to see the hypocrisy in criticising someone because they belong to a group who apparently always boast about their intelligence when A) you are also a member of said community and B) you were busy laughing at someone for being stupid, which seems to me like you too have a high opinion of your own intelligence.
---
Too many people need to be enough. Plus, sometimes only some players have an arena, the result is a situation where a person who has entered the abyss for the sake of PVP does not get the gate, and the one who came in for the PVE gets the gate, but does not use them.
---
Where do I put my app.
---
*This one is a keepstar.
---
Thank goodness for that, the old VNI was so weak in a brawling encounter with other cruisers
---
He is not wrong. Based on what I'm seeing and hearing, my estimate is that for every happy roaming PVP-er, at least 5 players will have left for lo- and hisec or stopped playing completely. You just don't want to face reality.
---
War Relics is awesome.
---
Auto-Pilot gets you killed!
---
If you're in highsec just set course and klick the Jump Icon in your "Selected Item" window, this way you can travel semi afk and still be safe after jumping through a gate and sitting inside gatecloak.
---
So usually you're only visible while aligning to a new gate and if you're inside a Taxi, like an Ares for example since its the most common one out there, you won't be risking too much. If you're only traveling through highsec and lowsec it might be a good idea to go for a Hecate-Taxi since they can get up to 20k ehp and still keep their &lt;2sec align while also having more cargo space.
---
It's great mechanics in terms of roleplay. Lowsec is a place for criminal scum.
---
No one has fun in Tidi Ferox brawls.

I really enjoyed your podcast during my drive today. Good discussion.
---
Saw it coming a mile away. Always thought it was a bit odd that they weren't at war with each-other considering they're meant to be eachother's' competition.
---
No. There are destroyers that have great dps, however, they aren't in line with the philosophy of larger guns, attack class.
---
Do I think we need these ships? Nope.
---
Do we already have destroyers with great dps? Yep.
---
Are you going to double down and argue your position anyway? Yep.
---
&gt; I understand that you clearly want Eve to be Hello Kitty Online, but  that's not the way it was designed and clearly isn't doing an awful lot  for online numbers as the game continues its slide from the highs of  50,000 a day (all paying subs) to 25,000 including free to play. 
---
Good job, you mindlessly regurgitated the standard kneejerk reaction to any criticism of EVE's pvp system.  You might want to actually read my post and try to understand it, so that you can make an intelligent response.
---
&gt; We had one of those; it was called r32/64 timers and it drove massive  multi-way battles to take control of the moons. Your side cried about  them because they didn't take active krabbing, and now we have a dead  lowsec with a bunch of moons that no one wants. 
---
My...."side"? I'm not sure what opinions and positions you're arbitrarily assigning to me, but I consider the change to moon mining to be one of CCP's worst decisions. EVE should be full of such "control points" that drive meaningful conflict and reward the players who are able to win and hold them.  If they're not going to give us back the old moon functionality (because that would be admitting that they made a mistake), they need to replace it with something similar.
---
&gt; Supercapital umbrellas and rorqual proliferation forces giant blue blobs  more than anything else in the game. If you want to mine, you have to  do it under an umbrella. If you want an umbrella, you have to mine  (ideally in Rorquals). There is zero incentive for a Rorqual miner to  stay in any alliance which doesn't have an umbrella. 
---
Er, no? A supercapital *umbrella* is a defensive measure, it doesn't affect other entities' abilities to operate without supers or Rorquals. It's the killmail-seeking parasites who force everyone to operate under umbrellas - CCP makes it easy to kill krabs who aren't protected by a super umbrella and offers killmails to incentivize doing so.
---
I wasn’t being sarcastic. I thought he was complaining about how hard it is to fight on a citadel grid, not simply stating a fact about it.
---
I also genuinely wanted to know what changes Suitonia thinks are needed when it comes to citadels.
---
Lies
---
The only thing this blackout has done, is manifesting the powerblocks even more. The blackout is a not thought out, and idiot approach, and I think CCP knows they pissed in their pants to solve a problem they themselves created
---
1. lies
---
2. Definitely not unusuable since there are npc stations there...
---
The first few battles were really fun, got a lot of kills and stuff, but it got lame pretty fast, also the constant reshipping was really tedious as no one ran out of ships.
---
Going there the fifth time to shoot feroxes at 50km in a sluggish tidi fest without accomplishing anything wasn't fun anymore.
---
Top man

Test has alot of former military personnel. It may be that the alpha males are a little more relaxed with politically correct BS because they can take a little ribbing. They also know how to put down real bigotry.
---
May I suggest a nice Beta Male Corp where you can all hold hands and share a secret.
---
Down vote away snowflakes.
---
You can't argue that homm3 is the superior game though.
---
From what I understand back in the most ancient days of EVE WCS were mid slot items that you had to manually activate. They moved them to low slot passive items in one of the very first patches.  
---
Seriously, go back and read the patch notes for the first couple expansions sometime. It was a completely different game back then.
---
No, you can't sidestep the point by using a different ship.
---
His point was you can fit any ship for tank instead of for ratting/mining. I told him to do it with a certain ship, when it cannot realistically be done
---
Start up video. Well VNI this could be interesting.
---
1. Team up with a Stratios on a Vedmak. Well this might escalate so that is why it is in the video. 
---
2. Mention Smartbombs, of the exact things the hull has a frikkin bonus for.
---
3. Kill Vedmak like it is big thing with having a Stratios buddy on grid.
---
4. Oh this video goes on for 1h17m? Fuck this.
---
Spoken like a true spodbrain
---
Good stuff!
---
Everything in jita is a scam
---
So did CCP
---
I hope you're being sarcastic
---
How about you play the game rather then just try grind isk by mining is fucking high sec
---
I’ll eventually move to null once we get that all set up but what’s wrong with mining?
---
Good Old Games would be my bet. It's the place for people that still want convenience but realize Steam is overpriced.
---
What happend exactly ? I dont understand it or i have not seen a backstory
---
What happend ? Whats the backstory   ? Did they kick your ass ingame or in real life ?
---
Cause then you cant be like me. Spending an hour refueling my cap, lighting a cyno, and discovering I'm an idiot for getting the wrong type.
---
Still better than sending newbie for your corp to get some fuel and he come back with fuel blocks ... and even wrong ones.
---
&gt; They won't look at the daily log in numbers when measuring the success of the blackout
---
Blackout and success can't really be used in the same sentence, less undocks then all of history, less targets and content then all of history. It's a better game for way less people unfortunately. 
---
Reddit is fake as hell yo
---
Haven't done that yet, but I did set the wrong ship in dotlans jump planner, and ended up being 1LY out of range from my cyno.
---
just leave them and join the my little pony alliance for every race in the rainbow
---
#idontinderstandengrish
---
Are you on crack?
---
No it's not, it is important that living under the umbrella with thousands of other people leads to resource scarcity.
---
Spoken like a true risk averse pubbie.
---
bad cause mad
---
Wow, that would be a great qol improvement 
---
Good post gob
---
Well that information helps and clears up one of the main problems :)
---
&gt;So Eve has remained a niche game and when the players tried to make it evolve by organisation... Well, here we are. The megaalliances that are getting shit for everything are the same one who did what CCP never could, they recruited newer players and gave them a home and an easy path to stay in the game. They held the retention numbers up, not CCP. And they made damn sure that you couldnt just roll in and do whatever you wanted.
---
This is a very good point. It would be interesting to see what portion of EVE's newplayer retention rate comes from newbies who join a nullsec alliance and learn the game under the protection of a super umbrella.
---
&gt; And even tho I dont like any player leaving, atm, an entire segment, an  entire playstyle of Eve could leave and I doubt the game would break.  After all its evolved and tons of new players who like a more relaxed  game has joined. If CCP really wants to improve retention they need to,  once and for all, kill the notion of what Eve should be and instead  focus on what Eve is. 
---
EVE would be a better game without people who play just to farm krabs and new players for killmails, but the problem is the system, not the players. As long as CCP continues to focus on enabling and rewarding this playstyle, there are going to be people who play EVE with the primary goal of padding their killboard stats, and they will continue to drive others (particularly newer players) away in the process.
---
I've said this before and I'll say it again - participation in the killmail system should be an option which can be toggled on and off, similar to world pvp in WoW, though of course with far more restrictions to limit the inevitable attempts to abuse the system (can you imagine the drama over awoxing if the awoxer didn't show on the blue killmails he or she enabled?). 
---
A few details about how I think the killmail toggle should work:
---
* Players can tell both in local and on overview who has KMs toggled on/off
---
* Having KMs toggled off does not affect players' ability to shoot you, kill you, or loot your wreck
---
* If a player with KMs toggled off dies, no killmail is generated
---
* If a player with KMs toggled off gets a solo kill, no killmail is generated
---
* If one or more players with KMs toggled off are involved in a killmail where the defender and one or more aggressors have killmails toggled on, the damage contribution from players with killmails toggled off shows up as "anonymous" and these players are not credited with any part of the kill
---
Obviously, there are a LOT of details that would need to be worked out and a lot of room for abuse that would need to be addressed. If properly implemented, however, this could go a long way towards mitigating the damage caused by all those years of CCP catering excessively to a single, toxic playstyle and driving away most of their potential customers.

Right because flair means everything. I mine a lot. That's why I just posted a couple days ago looking for a calc to buy ore in Jita.

I stand by my statement.

It's even more OP with the changes.
---
yikes quality, basically they made this 500 isk/u instead of 5/u banking on someone not realizing
---
HA! Did you forgot to mention the swarm of ECM drones and ECM by station plus neuted?? And he did got you to 23% hull.....but those station Jams..... oh ya and you forgot to mention they kept killing you while you mined that moon? Guess brave is so desperate for moon ores that even they kept dying they continued to mine :o but narrative gotta stay positive lol
---
I play the game. I don't boast about my intellectual ability to comprehend doing so. There's a difference. 
---
I don't need to have a high opinion of my intellect to recognize the ignorance in others. 
---
Stop with the Strawman arguments.
---
Easier to defang and less projection, but tanky as fuck.  As long as nobody brings a single small neut, or you have to run your prop more than one or two cycles.

Red Glowing Dust will always be my favorite song from the soundtrack. I remember a very long time ago I would be sitting in my dorm room playing it through my massively oversized speakers. It was super relaxing, and also funny to see everything in my room vibrating at different times as the bass found each of their resonant frequencies.

Highsec mining will have you quit the game of boredom long before you reach nullsec. It's boring and it's atrociously low income.

I have one inventor that can also build, plus 2 more builders.  Got up to 4 accounts my flow was pretty much log in deliver jobs, update spread sheets, decide what to build/invent, start 40 invention jobs, start 40 build jobs, cycle characters 40 more builds, cycle again and 40 more.  And of course repeat or skip character sets if you are doing longer/shorter jobs. 
---
every character has a research slot by default and it's really easy to add a few more if you need more copy slots. Can set a copy job to run for a week and have a ton of copies.    
---
Also watch your opportunity costs,  it's probably easier to just buy researched component bpos you can buy them at 10/20 for like 20-30 mil, in the time it takes to train the skills to research them and then doing the research imo it's just worth paying to skip.  Some guy is selling racial sets for ~150 mil, assuming you are using injectors or MPTC to train the skills that's going to be less than the ~1mil sp needed to do the research.  Likewise I bought a lot of my t1 inputs I'd rather pay some newb 5k per unit than waste slots building t1,  you should be make millions building t2 stuff where you save maybe a 100k running t1 jobs

Are you okay?
---
Do you hunt? 
---
I've been hunting in eve since about 2015. I can assure you damn near everything, or at least so much of it that it isn't worth your time has an umbrella. That was before the blackout. It was getting worse before blackout. If it continues to get worse because of the blackout, then it didn't change the path of the game anyways.
---
You could suicide a dread bomb in delve, but thats just a consequence of hunting under the umbrella. Black ops battleship meta was dead, and Olmeca has already went into depth about that. Much of the hunting I used to do is dead, or extremely, extremely difficult and not worth the time until blackout came along. 
---
I don't care if it does make eve worse in the end tbh, because to me and players like me (yes I've spoken to them) the game wasn't worth playing for much longer. If this is just a momentary reprieve in the death then thats fine, but what I \*will\* tell you for certain, Waffles was more fun in June than July, and more fun in July than June, and we are continuing to love what is happening.

Thanks for the video, was hoping to see what it's new repping potential would be like. Did you use Asklepians or no implants? Sorry if it's answered in the video, can't watch with sound since I'm at work.

Don't you have to have tether rights? Or can you just not deposit when you have an aggresion timer?

Same reason Californians keep voting in democrats. Then flee California for Texas or Arizona and vote democrats there. They seem to like destroying themselves.

I use both a cloaky Legion and a cloaky Tengu. I use each for different ship engagement scenarios...

I didn't claim someone thing so I don't need to estimate. If I came up with a different estimate you would insist I had to prove what I said. Either defend what you said or admit you made it up.
---
My goal post hasn't move the entire time, I have since the beginning said local is not a perfect intel tool. You claim it always tells you if a threat is there, and also people can pretend to be threats in local. That literally means local isn't actually telling you if they are a threat.
---
I flew it like I will fly it in TQ. No implants. Only with a standard exile booster.

Low sec got f*cked by risk adverse peons in Supers and titans dropping frigate gangs at the gate. Thats why everyone has stopped going there. Faction Warfare needs some love as... does anyone actually take faction warfare seriously anymore or have 2 factions essencially given up right now? Anyway in short Low Sec used to be amazing for the game now its just devoid of content.
---
Heh no politics from me on this sub sorry
---
He's bragging about Sisi killmarks in the post title. I don't know why you even bothered clicking on the video :/
---
&gt; Either defend what you said or admit you made it up.
---
i already told you it was a rough estimate based on the number of kills i saw in 2 hours on ZKILL, how do you still not see that? If you doubt the legitimacy of the number, you can go ahead and do your own research to assert your own guess.
---
&gt;said local is not a perfect intel tool
---
le epic semantic argument
---
&gt; You claim it always tells you if a threat is there, and also people can pretend to be threats in local.
---
i never said this statement, nice try again
---
Hm I don’t know what narrative I’m trying to put forward here, except that bait worked. I had been mining the moon a while hoping someone tried to jump on me. I didn’t have any ECM drones out nor did any of the miners as far as I’m aware of, so I don’t know what you’re getting at. And yes, of course we used the jams on the athanor, it’s a great way to keep trig ships from ramping up damage. Unfortunately, it was fit for anticap so it didn’t apply well to the Vedmak as you can see. And yes, getting a hull-tanked ship to 23% hull and bragging about it is like getting killed by a gila but getting him down to 25% shield lol. 
---
“They kept killing you while you mined that moon.” Um what? No I didn’t die until I warped it to a gate fight later to see how it would do as a little heavier tackle than the frigates we had, and I didn’t mind. It was still a good fight and a test of its capabilities. The vedmak pilot didn’t do much wrong, he just took the bait and was a little slow to get distance from me and let me get into scram range. I said gf in local and was met with silence. 
---
And yes, they tried to jump me again later with a bomber fleet and we also killed them again. (There were three more bombers that didn’t get on there I think...)
---
https://zkillboard.com/related/30000700/201907211400/

---
ESH. its eve. we are all assholes.
---
Can someone explain what is it about, the picture isn't great on my phone
---
How does not being able to jump create content?
---
No one has been able to show that this was caused by Blackout. The retarded one is you good sir.
---
Good news, friend! With high sec citadels you get both at the same time! Double AIDS for everyone!
---
"someone argue with me so i can push my agenda and feel justified!"
---
haha remember that ONE time that one supercap didn't have the right fuel to jump out?
---
Only, if you look at ZKill, kills HAVEN'T gone up as you claim. Which only makes your argument pathetic. Sorry for you.
---
Correct he was neuted and jammed by the structure, but not webbed. Unfortunately the missiles don’t apply very well.
---
So you guys sucked that bad before? Others were getting kills the old way, why couldn't you guys?
---
yeah.. nullbloc people are bad man
---
If they run out of fuel after midding, somebody goes to bring them some more and it's the wrong one?
---
Or maybe your hyper rag jumps in too late because you've never used it and it has the wrong fuel in the bay, so the hostiles get a proper dreadbomb / fleet formed before you jump in?
---
Etc etc.
---
Not saying it happens a lot. Hell, it's probably super fucking rare - but it *might've* mattered / will matter in the future.
---
Either way I support the change. Just wanted to mention the other side of the argument for the sake of painting a more nuanced picture.
---
Because learning to read in a complex space game is too much and we want to resort to crayon written instructions.
---
Why do you think it's across so many alliances? Because 99% of nullsec characters want nothing to do with high sec structure bashing.
---
Thanks for that detailed answer!
---
I’ll wait some more till I field that expensive Loki, although I would really love to fly it - But right now I can’t afford to lose it so I’ll follow that #1 eve rule. 
---
I’ll start with my previous list and add a passive Gila - Let’s see what awaits me!
---
I dont think ecm was ever considered Bad in fleets. Its more the small Gangs and solo were it really sucked when you were perma jammed. 
---
In the current Meta ecm ships in fleets arent any worse or better then they were before but noone brings them in big fights since it means less dps and now in small fights they are also dead meat
---
sounds about right
---
I wish that athanor applied at all. But you can see it barely did any damage. I was just able to hold him down long enough to whittle him down while neuting him out with a full high rack of neuts.
---
Let's just go with the example of a logistics cruiser (t1 or t2). They are pretty shit outside of their context, which is holding together a group of (probably differently specialised ships) in a small gang or fleet. How is it so incomprehensible/abhorrent that a capital ship should require a similar group context to be of value?
---
Operation Meteor basically.
---
Can confirm, we neuted and jammed him, but no web. He just lost the range control battle in the first few seconds.
---
My fit: https://zkillboard.com/kill/77949224/
---
Don't know about aggro timer, but no you don't need tether/docking rights to deposit.
---
As*
---
This is pretty much inevitable in any MMO game. A core group of people who have been actively playing for longest will emerge at the top of end game content with all the best stuff and nobody else can ever catch up. It's just in EVE that actually matters because it is an inherently PVP game, so even the act of trying to catch up is punished.
---
Gotcha, I know from mining that if you use a mining burst and get the red aggro timer it won't let you deposit until that ends. Good to know though that you can do that anywhere.
---
Not what your asking for exactly. But there is a pretty new podcast that recently got started focused on small gang stuff. 
---
I know your looking for video, but maybe this will help too for the ride to work or something:
---
https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/10/id1468916642
---
Two cloaky sabres with cynos, a blops and some 
---
Bombers and alot of partience or good Intel. Get to work. With the improved local changes no one will know you're there until you spring the trap.
---
What do you mean? The people who normally are mining the ore that would be transported and sold in high sec, are not doing that. That means there's no ore to buy and thus much lower sales.
---
Which ships would you run in a DST out of curiosity?
---
how much dps were you doing in that?
---
But I’m colourblind.
---
Love the idea, love the art. How did you get started doing pixel art?
---
So, by your train of thought, for every happy roaming PVPer at least 5 other people are happy too... sounds good. If they're happy, they can go be happy in whatever sector gives them the most pleasure. Why grudge them it?

https://pastebin.com/F2iefnnc this fit tanks 1.1k/sec stable. The only reason this fit has faction modules is because alphas cannot use all T2 modules. If you would use only T2 modules the fit would perform exactly the same. If you complain about the cost of the fit, you can make 200mil/h as an alpha in t1 scanning frig that costs &lt; 5 mil. Also it is not my problem that you aren't skilled into the rattle, im just saying it's very easy to do PVE as an alpha if you don't fly garbage fits.

This is a bit contrived, but I think post Blackout might be more accurate.

The active roaming population is the most likely to have ZK set up.

Botters, and the most loss-averse ratters, are the least likely to have ZK set up, and the most likely to not log in during Blackout.

It's not hard to understand, CCP made this with this nonsense blackout.
---
People here talk a lot to nonsense like blue donught, but they don't think that is the last thing that nullsec people and alliances want.
---
In fact nullsec alliances are the only player groups in the game able to do any serious war or action... And they did (look at the campaign in the north, tapi/frat war in the south).
---
Have you seen any other big action in the game?
---
CCP made possible the unthinkable, different alliances which NEVER thought to act together are now doing this.
---
This stupid move by CCP have created two things:
---
- a massive reduction of active players
---
- a huge coalition between null blocks (even between enemies)
---
Good job CCP, another huge nail in the coffin
---
Btw I'm an alpha too :D
---
So how do I read the spreadesheet (is everything with something red next to it not doable with this tactic) ? Is the basic idea that I can outrange anything less than 250km of range? 
---
Is the tactic to sit really far away from the sleeper site (as far as u can control the drones) next to a depot and launch drones to send into the site to deal some damage. Once a drone dies u drag another from ur cargo bay into ur drone bay and relaunch a new one?
---
I don't get ur first step, wdym refit for ratting? And also how can u carry a venture with you as well? Do depots allow u to change ship too (sorry I'm quite new so idk)?
---
Also how can u run away from the sleepers if ur sitting still next to ur depot?
---
Which fit out of the 2 should I be using?
---
Thanks :DD
---
No, 9 was the intended target, 10 is too many.
---
Go back to the start of all of this, that is literally what I said in the beginning , and now you say we are just debating semantics.
---
Unusable because even basic station activities either break or take forever during tidi. Something you’d know if you’d ever actually been involved in a tidi fight.
---
Why the fuck would you take a fight on a station you mouth breather
---
If you delete pvp, the goons win.
---
&gt;tbh the "dropping" player count is just people logging off their bots, and bot-aspirant types logging off.
---
This is such an overused trope that repeating it makes you look ignorant and intentionally uninformed at this point. Its a lot more then "just the bots" not logging in at this point. I have logged in my pvp character only since this experiment started. That means three less characters for you and everyone else "loving" the blackout to try and kill that aren't bots and I'm not the only one. This idiotic justification of writing off everyone who doesn't log in as being a bot is stupid and low IQ.
---
Link SA acct plz
---
If you want to be very careful, use another machine on a different network since they could identify you by hardware.
---
But this assumes they'll care enough to do that
---
Wish CCP allowed for name change with PLEX. What's the point of not having a name change feature in the era of alts and skill injectors.
---
&gt;" theres already a ton of plex on market  ...   but people arent buying plex in store "  
---
&gt;How the fuck do you think all that PLEX got on the market in the first place Einstein?
---
thing is there is plenty of ore on the market, noone's buying it
---
They have in the china server.
---
There are a few reasons to object to having them, but then they'll go and let you exploit GMs to get one anyway, so yeah they should. Character names should be shown in corp history so that you can still be traced.
---
and this is exactly why i decided not to join a null bloc after resubbing
---
it identifies as a loki you bigot
---
You're telling people who undock, fleet and do stuff to generate content. 
---
Reddit actually thinks like this btw
---
What higher-tier content that the game provides and was developed for do you have for several hundred users? 
---
Solo high-sec missions? Sweet.
---
Gotta reply to the comment
---
Maybe... because... fucking get this guys, it's gonna be nuts... they're NAME CODED.
---
Welcome to a game that implements features without the player base to support it.
---
Not really. If you want to slow people down when they take gates in order to force a fight, you need tons of bubbles. This is barely anything,
---
Its got a drone bay right? These drones can be pocket sand ec300s or a flight of lights right? Medium slot for a shield extender, 3 rig slots for shield buffer. 
---
Hey look a covetor that can, by all definitions, defend itself. It shit defense but it can.
---
Smart people just choose the less afk Procurer tho
---
Is anyone else severely depressed in the knowledge that English is a dying language?
---
You bubble gates like that to get fights you can win against unprepared hunters. Just like hunters want fights against unprepared pve ships. This is Eve, there’s no reason to expect anyone to play fair
---
Oh, I'm a pubbie myself. Fuck SA. I'm just not risk averse.
---
If you’re really determined to stay “not so blingy Minmatar,” a Cyclone should work fine as well. Might have to dig a bit for a fit or come up with one on your own though.
---
Jita is on a reinforced node 23/7. If a normal node tried to handle Jita things would not go so well
---
Have been and you're not unable to.
---
\&gt;local is removed? better uninstall since eve is now too scary
---
imagine being this much of a pussy
---
So why are you calling out other people for being pubbies you mango?
---
Also whats your definition of risk averse cause your entire eve career has culminated with one solo kill and a majority of your pvp is done in fleets numbering in the hundereds, whilst being in the largest virtual empire in the game with some of the safest PvE zones in the game.
---
Wow, you found the ZKill of one of my characters. Bravo Zulu. 
---
No fuck off twat.
---
who said I was that pilot? I was cloaked nex to you turds with 6 bombers but they decloaked first...so much craving for attention?
---
Self-sufficient is the biggest newbie trap in the game.  You start doing the most boring shit first and never get out of it because this game is too big for that.
---
because that's where 90% of the activity nowadays in the game occurs?
---
I guess I’ll just pack one and try it out!
---
When I say you it means: why would anyone take a fight at a station.  Ergo, ur still a mouth breather
---
&gt;Let's just go with the example of a logistics cruiser (t1 or t2). They are pretty shit outside of their context, which is holding together a group of (probably differently specialised ships) in a small gang or fleet. How is it so incomprehensible/abhorrent that a capital ship should require a similar group context to be of value?
---
His point was that capitals should be fleet support. I disagree. A dread, super, carrier, fax and titan should not all fill the role of giant, slow, expensive logi. What role would carriers that can't apply DPS to subcaps serve in the game? Command bursts? May as well drop a rorq on field instead. Carriers have none of the benefits of dreads, titans or supers. Maybe a carrier can tag along to subcap brawls and they can refil ammo from its fleet hangar before it dies. 
---
&gt;edit: further, your comment about a capital ship requiring support limiting them to big bloc only really just makes you seem naive and inexperienced.
---
Cute. How would you go about using a capital that can't apply damage to anything but other capitals? I'm curious.
---
What are small groups going to use one for? You would only ever need a cap to fight other caps or bash structures. If your enemy has more caps, you may as well leave your own at home, they'll just be a liability otherwise, and your T3C's can't be hurt by their caps. 
---
You're saying a cap should need other ships to fulfil its purpose/be effective. I'm saying once something like a carrier relies on other ships, and can't apply damage to anything but a cap, it will serve very little purpose.
---
Supers and titans can still rat safely under an umbrella. Same with mining rorquals. Everything else is just trying to replace itself before it dies, including normal carriers
---
So why get mad when the player owned station neuts you to oblivion?
---

---
Paid name changes just make old articles erroneous, CCP lets you pay to change your name - just not $20, instead the price of the injectors. 
---
Same dummies say EVE isn't P2W. Except you can buy the best ships/fleet/skills or ISK directly through converting plex. That level of stupid actually exists.
---
is he?
---
Yes?
---
Yeah just calling you out for being dense as usual
---
Excuse me sir I don't think that is the kind of tone you want to take with someone who solo'd the ender dragon in 14 minutes.
---
You undock, hit jump while still session changed, now you're lockable/content.
---
Or the fact you pay for all of your accounts with same credit card.
---
Jesus you guys crave for attention so much that you think I am that pilot? lol....oh man oh man oh man!!! I was cloaked watching the fight kiddo...want more attention? lol
---
That's a silly reason since most null sec pilots in the big block alliances don't participate in the highsec stuff. For TEST, it's a sig of people that want to. There's plenty of reasons not to join a null block, but that shouldn't be one of them.
---
Found the Vedmak's alt
---
I'm unsure if you realise but RL fuels are all colour coded for the most part.
---
AVGAS, 100/130, 100LL
---
MOGAS
---
AVTUR etc etc
---
&gt;and now you say we are just debating semantics.
---
because you are, because in your mind, perfect is everything, not 'all that is needed'
---
local is all that is needed to never die in nullsec.
---
Cause this is the exact behavior I’d expect from a former CSM and “community elder”. 
---
Yup.
---
Lv4 blitzing is 250/h done properly. Need ascendancy.
---
So you think high sec should be safe?
---
WoW Classic will be here soon for you.
---
Because you just keep adding random things, and I guess no one ever died when local existed.
---
Salt mining
---
well, not just that in particular, but the amount of structure bashing in general for no real purpose. its not fun and it doesnt feel like achieving anything either.
---
And we cater to the lowest common denominator. Your point?
---
Pretty sure everyone gets a gate I'd the number of abyssal filaments being run is high enough.
---
Just unsub already jesus you whine alot
---
&gt;and I guess no one ever died when local existed.
---
i never said that
---
But also companies that make decisions based on profit are lambasted for being anti-consumer.
---
No need to drink Mittens kool aid
---
But hunters are the ones on the killmails as well and they are likely to be on zk.
---
Plus corps may have it set up.
---
Honestly my 6 years old nephew can do a better argument than this...
---
Would you pay to play a game that give you no fun at all?
---
You must be stupid to do that, don't you think?
---
Eve rules of engagement are the same since the beginning of Eve, local in null is one of those, without it null is no more null, it's some kind of wormhole space (without the income and the ease of defence of wh space).
---
I will never played in WH, and I don't want it because it's an entirely different game that I don't like. Why should I renew my subs if the game I love is gone?
---
Thousands of players are asking the same question, and even if you are a 6 years old elite pvp you must understand that with this loss of players Eve will not change, Eve will shut down.
---
Spec one of the alts into a scanning-fighting char. Go WHs with that scanner, run relics etc. Train it further, then either start doing fighting sites in WHs or do incursions in HighSec. 1 hour a day = easily make enough ISK to plex all 3 accounts without the need to PI/mine for hours every day for the same income. Then you can mine as much as you want, not as much as you need. =\]
---
Just looking at the fits in pyfa, how much dps should i be aiming at. And also is it correct that the 2nd fit only uses a tiny amount of PG?
---
my dps values are at about 187 for the 2nd fit, and 174 for the first fit. I'm just confused about why would u want to use the less dps fit lol
---
So like what are the different advantages/disadvantages of the 2 different fits Uve given me?
---
My point is it literally doesn't affect you in any shape or form, and it'll be cool if it actually became a thing because it'll make sense.
---
A space game trying to have some actual science stuff behind it, it's good stuff.
---
If you prick your ears and concentrate, you can hear a sucking sound as the few actual humans therein are swallowed up into Delve, building our tax base more and more. The bots just die I guess.
---
Indeed they do not. There's some serious whack there.
---
He's in TEST
---
I bet your 6 year old nephew can form better sentences then you too.
---
Init posting please ignore.
---
awe! you so cute calling others with names...I mean you brave after all arent you? hence why you acting like 12? :p
---
No?
---
&gt;But hunters are the ones on the killmails as well and they are likely to be on zk.
---
Fair point.
---
Fake news; Gewns are not on this list and they are the #1 botting alliance 'cause I nanoroamed through Delve and everyone docked when I was 5 systems away.
---
...I don't even know how to respond to that, because nobody I know in leadership is EITHER what I'd call an "alpha male" or "former military personnel", so put your stolen valor and your edgelordery back in the bag.
---
I mean at least I can read at 12 year old level
---
This is great content, and been part of my inspiration to restore Dreddit's small gang core.
---
Gimme a month or two to sort things out I think imma do this

This is sadder than the fucking *Notebook*

I wonder if it has anything to do with maintaining their economic truce as it relates to the Tranquility Trading Tower of which they all get a dividend from? :thinking:
---
We're undocking in 30 seconds! Bring fuel for entosis!! Hurry! Hurry!! Rrrrreeeeeeeeeeee!    ...oh shit :(
---
Yeah but the risk steps up more than double.  It’s just a general risk reward calculus that ccp needs to evaluate
---
seperating FW players from the pirates in this context is not even necessary because at least 50% of FW fights will be against neutrals most of the time and FW players trade sec status for faction standing hits which are even harder to repair
---
Well it’s a little more complicated than that but grrr goons for sure
---
"A t L e A s T I c A n R e A d" you just sounded like that spongebob meme....

You’re so adorable

Good.  trading shouldn’t be 100% and deserve nerds ccp plz delete docking etc etc

am i doing it right reddit?

I was under the impression (obviously incorrectly) Mogul was PL affiliated

There’s one thing we can all agree on:  Volta can suck a dick and We enjoy a great bukakke now and then

Playing Minecraft and editing my own texture pack back some 8 years ago. I realized how much I like putting a color exactly where I want it, and it's clean and precise. That set it off and I did some LudumDare Jams with some programmers. Since then I've done it for ISK.
