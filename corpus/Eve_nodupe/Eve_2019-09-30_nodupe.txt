for example I could say "Goons are friends with PL because they once work together to burn one of Lenny's assets"

you can but this is both dumb and wrong historically

your argument is spurious.

Finally, someone to evict us. Please, come and end our gaming addiction.

Signal Cartel is very wrongheaded. Sparing capsuleers from the consequences of their own poor planning is not the way to improve New Eden.
---
Normally I would agree. But this is how they took over the entire Chinese server. I think the mega coalitions are learning from the chinese
---
Don't you need a super to krab in a c6?
---
This baby can fit so many pet alliances in it.
---
They had some blues, not nearly as many as test. Their blues also weren't nearby or on call for big timers. If a major frat/test super fight had every broken out, you had better believe goons would show up, but would panfam?
---
Ah, too bad. You must be on the end of the loop or have degraded lines.
---
you are a terrible player versus player player. you are an excellent house of cards online player though.
---
We'll just blob in frigates and destroyers now that Kikimora is cheap.
---
Inshallah Frat's new staging system will be Jahannam
---
I wonder where all that money came from. It really makes you think. Didn’t AoM migrate from Serenity just a few months ago with practically nothing? They go from being poor space immigrants to buying out a large Chinese alliance for trillions in that amount of time...
---
Am I missing something here or should I adjust my tinfoil?

That is of course what always happens. Monocle didn't happen and they've never given up on a game.
---
They didn't pay that much if they got it via RMT. Just sayin'.
---
im pretty sure im good at pvp too. 
---
In the end i both appreciate the sentiment that i can play "house of cards" online well, but i am also curious as to what differences in action you think i could have taken at different points. Over the course of the last two years or so it has very rarely felt like i have had much control over decisions. Much like someone paddling down a raging river, i can tilt the boat slighty and "win" by keeping us afloat but rarely ever felt like i could just change course without truly killing everyone or getting everyone within the coalition killed.
---
Isn't SLYCE in their coalition too, and they're blue to Horde (or they were a couple of weeks ago).
---
So yeah. Blue fucking donut. Why can't you guys be friends but also blow each other up? \^wormholerbtw
---
I said it was possible, not that i expected to happen. I still have some hope, okay???!?!
---
i really dont care dude, you can play your game your way and stagnate or whatever, or maybe you genuinely enjoy being in your current political win condition. i thought u were some great FC even from the goon days, but you're not really good at the pvp aspect of this game - as in, you're not good at individually piloting your ship and being mechanically good at the game. you're good at organization and getting nerds to follow you. if that's all you want, then great, objective achieved and you get a +1. if not, i'm in amamake, bring whatever and lets smash.
---
Please yes
---
Yup!
---
I just broke my partner's box spring, badly, and quite honestly in a completely G-rated way.  I definitely could use some doubloons to throw at things at the moment.
---
For a second there I thought this was about PL
---
Ugh, so i have to crab now :(
---
A Conoco bloke is trying to recruit me? Are they good?
---
Hey vily, remember when you joined pl and raged that we had your tears on our forum? Even went as far as demanding that we delete your leaking? You're a clown
---
I believe it was bought with ISK but people are posting the RL cash value.
---
&gt;as in, you're not good at individually piloting your ship and being mechanically good at the game. 
---
any particular thing makes you think this?
---
no not really.
---
Spy and Corp theft
---
I don't have any plexed alts atm. One char experience :)
---
If goons are "blue" to legacy, then PL/NC/Horde were "blue" to Frat.
---
PL/NC make shitty allies, news at 11.
---
It's almost like that's a big part of how they got into this position.  But oh how they whine about anyone who says you reap what you sow.
---
if you anchor a mobile bubble and then unanchor it does its decay lifetime until it despawns reset? So if I reset my t2 bubbles once a week I can keep using the same set forever rather than need a new set each week.
---
&gt; If a major frat/test super fight had every broken out,
---
It's a long fucking way to Detroit from 1DQ in supers. The fight would have to be planned at least multiple week in advance.
---
i do actually! I remember saying those leaks were a bit like beating a dead horse if i recall. I don't recall demanding they be taken down and since i've asked for you guys to cough up the thread so many times and you don't have it I also know there is nothing to back up your sentiments. Also they weren't leaks from me, they were from someone else in the corp but certainly you remember that too ;p
---

please fight.  we love content  ;)

Aiming to bring ya some really great stuff
---
I've been working on that. The AU tz is pretty rough. I've played games in that tz as well. We used to call it "the night crew" since it was like working a graveyard shift in a game.
---
Well it's not really a surprise when you consider that for some time now CCP has been focusing their efforts on attracting and retaining new players by nerfing mechanics that older players were attached to. I'm particularly thinking of the addition of F2P and injectors, which lowered the perceived value of well-developed characters. Sunk costs were what were keeping so many of us in the game.
---
This is high quality shitposting and it pleases me, thank you.
---
You've never had good pulled pork and it shows my dude.
---
The culture difference is just bizarre. If the RR situation happened to an EU/NA alliance I bet there would be a mass exodus of corps and line members. But a Chinese alliance, probably nothing gonna change. We will see.
---
I might be wrong here but I'm fairly sure legacy + goons + russians is going to be a slightly better bloc than pandas + horde and their pets
---
No
---
We still fight each other, we just won't evict.
---
WTS "Mining Coalition.", it has a parody of the MC logo.
---
I mean it's almost like people in wormhole space prefer to fight over not fighting, so when there is no way to organically get a fight they will just ask the other guy's hey you like shooting spaceships we like shooting spaceships let's undock and shoot some spaceships.

Alright. That makes sense. I checked the sov map yesterday and thought it was really weird to see them listed as GotG and on the other side of PanFam from the rest of GotG when I knew that they were blue with Horde.

i dont remember the last time someone brought a garmur tbh. Current flavor is comets or daredevils.

Well, it is EVE. Why not take the direct route if another party is agreeable? It isn't like there aren't any historical examples. Louisiana Purchase for one. This might actually describe the bulk of the Middle Ages. Just buy the people and land you need and only fight the ones you have to. You could fight for it, try treason and espionage, or just buy it.
---
Seems legit.

Lol I understand this I was just asking so if anyone had a good solo roaming small scale fit they could share and I could use and wanted it to be bling as possible
---
Well I for One Think It Would Be Great Content. Nothing Like Sweating A Hog On The Pit! "Lets Bankrupt Hogs" Cleaning EvE Of Bottom Feeders.     **#bankrupthogs       #hogscracklen          #pigsinspace**                                                **Sponsored:**    By a eve player online  Bringing Low Sec To High Sec.   Agreed...!  Got ya some really great stuff for them to.....
---
Just takes a few guys to blast em buddy :)
---
the thing about hs wardecs/pirat is, noone really cares about hs wardecs..
---
the best ''counter'' would be a HS corp that likes to do hs wardecs.. basically the exact same like pirat. but since that playstile is pretty boring/aids noone does it. (completely ignoring that they prob would blue each other)
---
so why should i as a null/low/wh resident or even a hs miner go out of my way, ignore the playstile i like and do hs wardecs? since there is basically nothing that stops them from docking (which they always do when outnumbered). it is simply not worth wasting time on an activity i dont like.
---
so the easiest way is just ignoring them. and hauling with a neutral char which nearly everyone has anyways
---
It'll definitely bring epic loots those Pirates are all fitted in shinies you can make 100s of millions off their bodies!
---
Yes that should work
---
Me too, sabres are delicious
---
Nah, that post is over on the Albion forums.
---
Even karmawhored with a confession comment, next level 4d redditing here. :D
---
That's all well and good you can do whatever you want in Eve. There is actualy great stuff about killing these guys besides catching a loot box worth 400 mil. 
---
You are also providing a valuable service to your fellow player and in doing so earning much plus respect within the community for being such a vigilant bearer of justice. 
---
If you don't believe it is worth your effort to assist this movement thats ok. But remember not even neutrals are safe from pirates.
---
I don't normally aim for "high quality" but I know when to take a compliment. Thanks!
---
I'd be surprised if it hasn't happened before.
---
This is quality content.
---

---
Been playing the game since 2005. I always was pretty invested in the meta.
---
First time ever I have no fucking clue what people talking about. Tranquility needs a wall, and Mittani has to pay for it.
---
Whats not to be intorested in ya its eve and its a call out to people who have had this done to them. Its not right for you to make it nonimportant becouse it does not effect you. But you said your self you have seen it so why not call to arms pilots who would like to stand up with others.   I think its a good content builder and good community building. Keep It Up Buck ....! It open for people who want to join not for why you should not join I am Shure they have something on Reddit where you can post that stuff at.......
---
lol.  many have tried.  we look foward to seeing you again soon debes
---
I'm just wondering if this "private channel" is really your ass.
---
Sources or it didn't happen.
---
No, I think is diplomat decisions are weak sauce. But I'll give credit where credit is due because it's a fucking game, and if I see someone who's decent at something I don't mind letting them know
---
Oh shit they’re coming? I better start playing again
---
Not possible. This was all planned at Mittani's BBQ and it's not possible that someone with more disposable income than good sense would drop that much on a video game. That's only for soccer mom's playing Candy Crush.
---
&gt; catching a loot box worth 400 mil.
---
i mean, yes. the exceptional bait every now and then happens. but its extremely rare and just results in them not taking the bait a second time. if im after isk there are better ways to do that.
---
&gt; respect within the community
---
well.. for me and most of the players. fun is more important than gaining ''respect'' while doing an activity that is just shit.
---
&gt; But remember not even neutrals are safe from pirates.
---
what do you mean by that? as long as you dont have wardecs you ARE safe from pirat. and since you cant be decced if your corp doesnt have a structure, the tiny part that got annoyed enough but couldnt care to shoot them in hs just moved all their structures into a holding corp...
---
EDIT: dont get me wrong. i dont like pirat either and i wish all the best, luck and hopefully ''fun'' with your goals/project. but history has shown that stuff like that doesnt really end with fun for the involved parties.
---
And more to the point - over our dead bodies
---
We don't have to bait Pirates, Pirates bait themselves with their incredible egos! :)
---
Pirates camp gates
---
Sprinkle a bit of blow on the tip, will help with the burning.
---
Confirmed where? On a server that is just as bad as this one for ruse cruises?
---
Probably just acknowledging reality instead of being a dick for the sake of being a dick.
---
Slyce got kicked some months ago
---
It was alive an hour ago, idk about now though
---
&gt;  Sparing capsuleers from the consequences of their own poor planning
---
When CCP does this by making the game easier, then you're correct. Players doing stuff like this are just cool, and they are providing a sort of content.
---
I enjoy Player vs player content it is some of the best stuff out there. These fellas are at war with tons of corps and alliances. There is no reason we can't all work together to check these fellas on their mistake.
---
It's not like it's any big deal to lend a shooter to the cause especially if you just chillin anyway dog. 
---
We gonna always be shuttin them down thats the entire point to be an unpredictable fiasco. 
---
We are seeking creative and ambitious pilots!
---
I dream of a full neutral reset of everyone not legacy. Give the goons a proper fight
---
Considering the goons northern armor fleet made it to ualx before the server died. It could make it from 1dq pretty easily especially with it being blue ks chain the whole way
---
"some stuff"
---
  Hmmmm
---
wow you sound like you have been around to bad history does not match.. Try.....?  Your from low sec your getting pushed out to High.     To funny love reddit...:)
---
Lol, ya nothing to see here
---
Well with TEST and Goons supporting them it's pretty obvious they aren't going anywhere.
---
i mean.. if you want to do that and if it is fun for you. go at it! i wish you all the best.
---
pirat has decced most of the big ns alliances. they could easily go at pirat. but again, since you cant force someone to undock. the chances to get content out of them is extremely low.
---
in 0.0 there are structures, ihubs, beacons, cynojammers, bridges and what not to force someone to fight. but even reffing them, they end up in blueballs most of the time...
---
so once again, for the majority of the players it is simply not worth the time and effort for the amount of content you might get out of an activity you dont like anyways.
---
Goons have purchased elo, N3 has purchased elo. He can be bought with any combination of isk, chicken sandwiches or cocaine.
---
Isn't it where coalitions/alliances typically go to die?
---
2 weeks of Goons doing hole control before they fuck off and we set up shop right behind them. Goons are F1 monkeys, nothing more.
---
After losing two Keeps and trillions in assets.
---
They got their shit kicked in, no need to try and chest beat like HK is some group to be feared. They talk a big game, but are 100% unable to back it up.
---
I leveled one character on my WoW account to 120 this expansion and three others to 110 last expansion. Even though I'm no longer subscribed and I therefore have a trial account which caps out at 20, I shouldn't have those characters locked until I resubscribe. Because I paid for that.
---
/s
---
With goon support
---
The other odd thing was that we lost a stiletto as well but the wreck was in a bubble 800km away from the dread and other stiletto. 
---
TBH, of all the things about Keepstar DDs and upwell jump gates I like this mechanic use the most: there is a play that requires a degree of coordination (moving the stiletto into the correct area and DDing it), a couunterplay that should be fairly reliable (bringing turret ships to blap the ceptor) and doing it properly either way is basically guaranteed at least one dead ship.
---
You’re forgetting about tidi and max jump fatigue. Goon supers could be there in under 2 hours, which under max tidi is what, 6 minutes?
---
You cant.
---
Try not being such a degenerate and instead invest in OTM SPY FDs.
---
Used to use them for cynos. Today they're scouts.

I don't need a recording of your incompetence. I do exploration every day and am collecting a fortune. Seeing all the other comments here you are literally the only one not able to earn good money with it, so must be on your side. I know, blaming others or the game is easy, but please just stop.
---
Can confirm I bought $700 in plex CONFIRMED you can buy plex
---
Moozh for CSM, Exo was a mistake.
---
Wait I’m 5 days or so into eve and bought $700 of plex right off the bat :o
---
Did eve finally come to end? Blue donut is now complete  and nullsec is left with nothing but krabbing. GF, was fun while it lasted o7
---
Thanks. I try to avoid going into wormholes so I'm safe for now.
---
Who’s this Elo
---
&gt; Player vs player content it is some of the best stuff out there
---
could be my words. the thing with pirat and ''player vs player content'' is, that it basically never happens if you show up with something that could fight them. they arent interested in fights. they want ganks.
---
and once again, since you cant force them to fight it ends up with no ''player vs player content''.
---
so why should i/everyone else get out of my way, play a playstile i dont like and get no content out of it when even more content is at the doorstep i already live?
---
Unsung to tell ccp how much I dislike their decisions
---
That was implied.
---
Tbf a good cbickenchicken sandwhich is pretty good
---
lets be real here. he wasnt even that good of an FC. Anyone can blueball or helldunk when you have absolute numerical superiority + batphones + backup batphones. It's how he was taught, and it's how he's played.
---
Vily's skill comes from organizing nerds into actually following him, which is legit a remarkable achievement. He's got a shit ton of charisma, kool-aid sales skills, and organizational skills. IIRC he was the main driving force of rebuilding TEST's supercap fleet from like 10 supers and 3 titans to what it is now.
---
Vily's character flaw, though, comes from his strength. He won't fight on even terms for the sake of playing a video game; he'd rather play house of cards online instead of eve online. On the other hand, you have PGL who will take a fight, and will take a risk, even if it means losing an entire dread fleet and cutting a deployment short. Luckily, Seddows moreso follows the PGL school of thought than the Vily school of thought.
---
Ah but who the fuck am I, just some rando nobody, slightly buzzed after a fantastic Bears win at home against a divisonal rival, talking trash on a public forum full of equally retarded nobodies.

---
Edit: Wait are you a soccer mom?
---
Really tells you something about the Chinese. No idea what that is, mind you. But it’s saying something alright.
---
Well man it's actually pretty easy to shut them down and get engagements out of them. 
---
There is a lot of activities that leave them exposed to taking loses. They want to escalate fights we wanna escalate fights. Really when it comes down to it this is going to be a constant source of gameplay and pvp. I really don't see what your issue with it is.
---
Well, that is too bad :(
---
Yeah, the stiletto was in the process of warping off when the DD triggered. I suppose it got 800km in warp before the next tick landed, killing it.
---
I'm lucky there wasn't any attempt at screening my ceptor, otherwise it'd have made for a less amusing video.

I used to use a phoon. Could tank and finish any missions I threw it at with slight fit changes. At 200M it's pretty inexpensive.
---
Cruise with domination XL booster, amp, and specific hardener gives abt 500 tank against angels and north of 700DPS. Drop the hardeners for X type EM and Therm and you can tank Sanshas to the tune of 522DPS. Basically, you just have to switch drones and hardeners and you are RTG for the next mission.
---
It can probably be improved on. It's a super old fit when I had lower skills and I haven't run a mission in years.

28 days is not anywhere near long enough to really grasp eves content.

Alphas are a great addition and they should allow players to log on multiple alpha characters. As well as their Omega characters.

They should allow for ingame mechanics to counter bot/drone account combat. This is not only good for CCP but good for the game as well.

Why are you putting that in quotes lmao. They were kicked out of their hole. That's what an eviction is you plonker.

You're confusing one button -&gt; multiple clients with one button -&gt; multiple keystrokes, or one button-&gt; repeated actions.
---
CCP security team members, in the past, have explicitly stated that the second is fine. Specifically, they used an example of f1-f8 to activate a rack of smartbombs as allowable. Can I find that thread? No. But no where in the current rules or posts on the topic does multiple keystrokes on a single key come up.

yeah, disposable structures not even worth as much as their most used ships with timers across atleast 2weeks.
---
structures like they already lost... remember the great fights they provided? yes, me neither
---
the north got steamrolled, structures worth trillions got destroyed without any real fights. so why should all of a sudden a structure worth a bill provide fights by a group that isnt intersted in fighting anyways?
---
We are back to Null sec care bears being able to rely on third party programs to cheat the system. Whether or not we are better off probably depends on what group you are with. 
---
I wish CCP would delay log reading so that real time programs would not be viable to use.
---
With CCPs lack of seeing things through or lack of planning, players from the carebear side to the elite pvp side have both been burned. I hate this company.
---
And intel channels would just move to jabber or discord and tools would be changed to read/get information from them for the same end effect.

maybe because the content is extremely shit or nonexistent compared to what they can already get where they live...

This hasn't been widely covered due to the salt floods, but high-sec players suffered greatly as well due to the Drifter and Incursions attacks that lead to the blackout. Interbus transports were being destroyed all over, leading to a massive shortage on pacifiers and nappies. DED's need to divert manpower to combat this also caused a massive disruption to scheduled nap times. It's been a difficult time for high-sec residents.
---
None. All nullsec requires some sort of diplomacy meaning that everyone is connected at some point or another.
---
If only there was an abyssal fitting tool.

Imagine I have a rifter fit that is 5 over on cpu. I want a tool that looks at currently available abyssals and spits out groups of items that would let the fit work. Like a -3 CPU scram  -2 CPU mwd without going over on PG. Add in some requirements for the mods (like no more than X cap use, at least Y point range).

Check out the server, I'm sure somebody can advise you. IQ trading is a thing there apparently.

Every single alliance is at some sort of tenuous peace with each other? No one in the entire universe is trying to take something by force from someone else?

If A blues B, B blues C, C blues D

Q: Are A and D blue?
---
Assuming this is accurate and there is a way to confirm it, will CCP just do nothing and all part of the sandbox kinda narrative? This whole thing just smells like one step down a really toxic path for the game.
---
Nah, that's Etherium Reach.
---
Not a random timer.... 2 keepstars and a sotiyo were on the line.
---
I'm on the server. What I want is an automated tool to do this computationally difficult task. For a rifter it's not so bad. For a battleship it's a nightmare.

your number of targets has gone up.
---
Not sure what you mean. I’m not looking to join a corp. How am I supposed to see these alliances standings?

tbh we should have a major brawl, the 4 biggest coalitions fighting each other and in the end the coalitions disband and the remaining alliances pick places to settle

Hi Powersv2,

While that may be true, my issue is with third party programs like I referred to in my post.

Don't let me. It's an eastablished fact now. The official declaration form the former CEO of RR is hanging in Chinese forum now 🤷
---
Absolutely.
---
Nah pal, they won't consider your offer if your coalition can't strike Winter Co.🤣
---
I listened to the FC YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME.  The FC DIDNT EVEN SAY SHIT.  Some dumb bitch on the side did about saying "i will find until the end ree lol" in local before a 100 man fight along with all the other spam.  DO YOU REALIZE HOW INSIGNIFICANT THAT IS.   Only some dumb bitch with a hard on for control because no one likes her would say something like that.  And only some white knight cuck like you would defend it.

Yes, I know that death is in highsec, but I was doing both highsec cans and wormhole cans to try to see if there was any kind of difference in the quality of content and there was; Highsec cans had 5-10k in loot and wormhole cans had 20-50k, with the exceedingly rare lottery can dropping a couple million in loot.
---
As a curious onlooker, is this something that the people in Ranger Regiment want/ed?  
---
I have zero knowledge about the corp/alliance RR, but for some reason my initial reaction was for them to just drop corp/alliance and reform after taking this guys money.

Everyone is trying to survive to the best of their ability. They will withhold combat in order to protect themselves as they should.

Though they must come out of the station in order to participate in any combat. You really not making any sense because any time they are engaging in their content they are exposed to defeat.

I'd say let's go evict them, but that would require waking up at 5 in the morning every day to shoot structures
---
So, uh, I guess let them be or something
---
That's not a war that's housekeeping

The chances of your alliance ever fighting GSF in another war hinges on whether or not your leadership like Vily, PGL, etc. are willing to do anything risky.

Seems to me if these are the numbers afterr adding local back to nullsec, imagine how high we can get the pcu when we add local to wormholes.  After all, we tried it their way and it failed miserably.

The information from Chinese Post Bar said that RR will not have some big changes or leave Dead Co. This acquisition is just a personal action for that female CEO to fight against the haters in Chinese Post Bar because a lot of haters from Winter Co said a lot of dirty words to her. That CEO(Little Rabbit Lu) said she will not change the direction or the decision from the former CEO. Seems RR gain a huge amount of ISK without any cost.
---
From what I see opinions are conflicting. Someone just make fun of the Rabbit. Someone talks about AFK. Someone stands for the decision of their Chief inspector and former CEO. RR guys aren't burning dollars in this game, but the Rabbit is on the contrary. Her donation to AOM is 550b isk. I du know how much this time. Rumors say it's about 5 G US dollars.
---
They actually dropped since literally everybody is either using one of these that alerts them 5 minutes before you're even in system or one of the returned bots that are literally everywhere.  Couple that with now response fleets only undock when they have a definitive counter to your comp and numbers.
---
But nice try.

The website mutaplasmid.space (linked in original post) does allow you to do exactly that. It can browse all currently posted contracts in the game for abyssal mods, and you can use continuous sliders to choose what stat ranges you are looking for. Need a scram with &gt;10km range but &lt;25 cpu? you can search for that. An MWD with low pg, cpu, and good speed, but don't care about sig? you can search for that. A damage control with exactly 24.75 cpu, 53% EM, 50% therm, 44%kin, 51% explosive resist? well, you might not find that exact specific module, but you can sure search for it. Give it a whirl, it works pretty well. And if you can't find what you are looking for, that is what the discord and in-game Abyssal Trading channels are for, as people have stashes of mods far beyond what they can post to contracts.
---
The problem that I had was the the combat just wasn't any fucking fun. Unlike any other MMORPG I have ever played, your starting skills are pretty close to your final skills. That is pretty bad by itself, but none of the rotations ever felt very interesting to me. I think I would rather watch my character hit something in Old School Runescape than mash the same5 keys for the entire time I'm doing combat in the game.
---
I'm confused what do you want to do?
---
It does it for single modules, not groups of modules or fits. Groups is a much more computationally difficult problem. I've spoken to the dev and it's not going to happen on mutaplasmid

What I heard is that the Rabbit buy RR just want to let all RR players help her to fight her haters in Chinese Post Bar from Winter Co(which fight against AOM). She has said in RR alliance that the former executives will still manage and control the alliance.

Indeed they want to strike Winter Co from North and South. The rabbit is not a FC who can lead the fleet to victory. And to placate the most people of RR they need to maintain the management.

Yeah, that's the counterplay: bringing anything that can kill the ceptor, though a prophecy could provide a hardened version so maybe a dirt cheap scram frig might be needed as well.
---
This could be a good guess. But as I know, RR is busy fighting against NC and the pets of Panfam in Tenal. In a short period, it seems very hard to let RR fight against Winter Co. And a very interesting thing is that Winter Co is blue to RR now. If Rabbit want to keep her words, RR will still keep blue with Winter Co. But I think RR and AOM are fighting together against Winter Co in Chinese Post Bar now.
---
While the previous comments about lag management are probably the biggest points for keeping you alive, there is a low-slot module, the Warp Core Stabilizer, that inhibits warp scramblers and disruptors.  (Basic) warp disruptors put one 'point' of warp disruption on you.  (Basic) warp scramblers put two points of warp disruption on you and shut off your MWD, but not an afterburner.  Some expensive faction variants apply an extra point.  Each WCS you fit adds a point of warp core strength.  If they have fewer points of disruption than you have points of warp core strength, they cannot prevent you from warping off.
---
However, it is very common for explorers and similarly furtive targets to fit these, and so most dedicated hunters either shell out for the extra points via faction modules, or equip multiple disruptors/scramblers to get around this.
---
It is also worth noting that each WCS you have fitted reduces your targeting range significantly, and the stacking penalty is severe.
---
Botters are back, there's more reason for them to PLEX up and log in again. If I still cared enough about this game I've had bought a bunch of PLEX when all of the bots were in blackout mode.
---
I have absolutely no idea about what impact the blackout had on non-cheating players. Might have been a downswing, might have been an upswing, might have been basically no change. There's no data publicly available on it.
---
As long as asset safety and citadel spam remain as-is there is no prospect for a turnaround in the game's fortunes.
---
That's what I think
---
I was being sarcastic and presenting how the same idea would work for a different game's trial account in order to show how ridiculous it is.

You know you fucked up if NC. is your last hope for a free and dangerous EVE.

Those regions are mainly populated by PVP-focused alliances who aren't part of the krabbing-focused blue donut.
---
PL isn't for sale, its in a landfill
---
Don't forget afk multibox ratting.
---
I'm sure there's a way.
---
No. The bots are set to react to changes in local. When you jump in, they leave.
---
Praise James that this isn't going to get you that much of the good stuff.
---
But I thought not having local destroys the game. Or maybe it doesn't.
---
Expect drunk nerds.
---
What will that do?
---
The blackout says your wrong. The second risk was introduced into nulls fluffy sea of blue the bid alliances screamed like banshees. They have the highest reward with the least risk. That risk meant they couldn't just run bots safely and afk farming was a no-go.
---
I know

&gt; not gonna come into a thread of goons and fact check
---
"i refuse to fact check anything, despite claiming there were incorrect facts"
---
sure thing.
---
honestly nuking asset safety would be the easiest way to instantly start a war
---
Honestly, I doubt goons are prepared for how boring wh evictions actually are. They aren't fun at all and you're stuck in a single system for a week or more with very little to do except stare at a wormhole. Goons have historically been good at "weaponised boredom" but evictions are far more tiring and boring for the attacker than for the defender. My bet is they'll do one or two evictions and never come back to wh space.
---
I guess that's why they needed that 2 tril RMT isk.....
---
&gt; It's true that incoming wormholes show up as a signature and you know someone just jumped into you if it formed a new connection.
---
i was under the assumption that, from my days in wormholes a few years ago, that the connection (k162?) spawned when some one warped to the entrance, not jumped it?
---
just like how gas site sleepers timer starts ticking when you initiate warp, not when you land on grid?
---
i'll admit it has been about 3 or so years since i was living in wormholes, things may have changed.
---
Shame this is down the chain from numerous shitposts, dinobrains will bury it based on the above.
---
Do you really expect anything different from these guys? 
---
They admit how they don't actually understand any mechanics starting at 20 minutes.
---
This looks like the close second. Great video btw. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ui7ZTlfNngc

&amp;#x200B;
---
did you just assume his ass is private?
---
Ungrateful git.
---
I understood this reference.
---
It would probably start a war of back and forth evictions until one side got tired. Goons have the numbers but that won't help if you can't get them inside the hole. If goons really put their minds to it they could consolidate C6 space but they haven't really shown any interest in doing that so far.
---
Was a thread about that a couple days ago how AOM bought 2 tril isk from an RMT bazar. Fuck me and I just resubbed... 
---
I already knew this was gonna happen soon the Chinese started flooding into Tranquility.
---
While Russian botting and RMT was limited. The Chinese are on a whole different level. 
---
2 years and this game's becoming like Serenity.
---
To counter jams.... Oh...
---
It seems this player did the same action to VENI VIDI VICI also, which is the pet alliance belong to Northern Pandemic (or Pamfam), very interesting thing, I really wanna know what will happen next lmao.
---
I never even thought of people just buying out an alliance/corp. Im so used to thinking of corps as another name for guild, but it really is different.
---
Botting isn't mentioned...how funny.
---
Is a lot of countries, its literally criminal.
---
nice fake
---
[let's just add a special case](https://youtu.be/P0AVmBVAAnk?t=956)
---
go kill ejected shuttles then
---
I find this super fustrating too, especially living near an active NPC pocket. But the people that staged those bombers or dreads staged in that system did the work to get them there. Those ships are there because a player or organization put the effort and for fruits of their labor is dropping on us when we decide to PVE. Now if I wanted to pve near that NPC station I made sure to check the NPC pocket and make sure the hot droppers aren't online.
---
My issue was that they could see if we were out ratting without even undocking by looking at the map and see that system was red due to the large amount of rats we killed.
---
&gt;I wonder where all that money came from. 
---
Lots of millionaires in China, powered by American demand.
---
They reported blue bots and Sort wanted to give some of their space to other renters (botters)
---
Visible disgust @ amount of blue structures on that overview
---
I will admit that I am legit looking forward to seeing how Chinese FCs and fleet comps fare against EU/US FCs
---
What's worse being goon pets or chinese pets I hope they give sort and his few remaining sycophants in darkness a couple of systems to rat/mine in at least.
---
well, A nice start.... Let's see the track of history.
---
Eve sure is a weird game
---
Give all blops techs 2 resists, problem solved even more now that they can actually tank things.
---
eh, That's a bit unrealistic.  It's closer to 20-120/site, sometimes more.  
---
But yeah, sometimes a single can is worth 100M+
---
well seeing as how the most successful move they've ever made was hiring an eu/us corp to lead their army....don't hold your breath
---
There are two big donuts, one is led by Goons, it's associated 'members' are Test, brave, other  Legacy members, FiRE, Deadco, INIT, AoM etc. It makes up about 75-80% of null. Their politics mostly are about krabbing and empire building (blue up what you can) for the past few years.
---
You have another donut that is PH, NC, PL and WinterCo. They make about 20-25% of null. Their politics have been mostly about content and enough income to sustain content levels for past few years. Consequently and so inherently, they aren't as big as the other donut. 
---
It's really a battle of ideologies, krabbing vs content. 
---
Serenity 2019 vs Tranquility 2015
---
Yeah true enough, you could do all the major structures in three days. But, is there even a point then? All the active members will just move assets to the smaller structures or log them off so not really a massive loss to the corp. Unless loot is the main objective (and judging the rhetoric here it isn't) bashing a few structures down doesn't really achieve much, except to bore the attackers.
---
in that case go to nullsec.  I can regularly make 100M+ from 4 relic sites, and that's &lt;1 hour.
---
RMT in Serenity, use that cash to buy Plex in Tranquility. No way for CCP to trace that.
---
That's bs, like AOM said they'd not join blue donut. It's all diplomatic talk.
---
NC. plays 4D chess and let goons form the ultimate blue donut, now only Krabs undock.
---
Bought RR for free if you RMTd it. (Serenity RMT).
---
No, there is actually something called the Fountain Curse.
---
Hope ya'll grow strong. Good luck!
---
INIT isnt goons? Fuck we've been upgraded put us back
---
Logoff in highsec in an NPC station, once you decide to extract skills, you move your character to a nearby player owned structure, do the things and go back to npc station and logoff for a month or so...
---
This changes literally nothing, lol.
---
Good luck, new blood is always good for the game :)
---
I can only hope it'll lead to more conflict and more fun
---
high secs greatest threats are suicide ganks, low secs are wh’s, faction pvp, gang roams, null secs risks are 100man fleets, wh’s, actual wars to control space, getting dropped on. blackout proved that if you stack the odds vs one side, your ONLY going to have one side. blue donuts are player made, players working together, it’s not concord saving your ass, it’s Players, mind you shit dies, players aren’t perfect, players aren’t always there. take your weak comments somewhere else. go run some lv 1 missions with your battleship in a 1.0 system with your concord donut. oh and wh space deals with no local, consistent random holes, huge fleets looking for shit to kill, usually heading into null, sleeper sites, and loot box structures which is a good reason why they make hella isk. yea kid  higher risk = higher payout.
---
They were all bots and AFKers yes. And now we got 30% of them back which makes sense.
---
Ohhh, so its an investment... Gotcha... lol...

Will be shocked to expect anything bold from TEST leadership given the past few years.
---
Probably slow-pace invade Drone regions like Detorid, whenever there will be risk of even fight, will call in 80% of null. Probably glass Malpais and Etherium reach. Panfam will blueball, make it cancerous and boring, pack up it's assets and leave the area and not feed content like FRT did. Only entosis content for a while initially and then weeks of structure bash content.
---
Plenty of space empty space to go live in and fight another day.
---
Unless TEST/GOONs split occurs, there is nothing happening. And if eventual TEST/GOONs split does occur, and if TEST initiates it, they wouldn't do it without backing from Panfam or they would still need Panfam to be alive so GOONS won't initiate anything because if someone was to make a bet, Panfam would choose to be on Legacy's side rather than Imperium.
---
However if Goons initiate it, then that'll leave TEST to scramble and throw away the leverage to Panfam.
---
Best play for Panfam is blueball, deny coalition level content and survive. 
---
Best play for TAPI is to grow its blue list big enough that it can challenge GOONS or get into a winnable cold war and Panfam would be a key to it. Panfam's internal political mechanics are also vastly different from past with PH effectively becoming the lead player instead of PL or NC. So there is a room for relationship, we see small signs of it, with Hisec keepstar deal, PH acting as escrow for Detorid keepstar deals etc. Let's see. 
---
Best play for GOONS is to ensure no third parties becomes big enough that when combined they can challenge Imperium, so Mittens will support and push TEST to hit Panfam which is the only third party that when combined with Legacy can challenge Imperium and Vily might just go along with it because TEST has yet to make a bold political play frankly.
---
Offcourse, all of this has baseline assumption that TEST has ambition to become the no.1 dawg in the yard like GOONS, PL, BOB etc before it. But so far that ambition has been lacking or perhaps camouflaged for the long game.
---
If TEST kills Panfam, then it'll simply have no one to turn to. Same time next year, camping Jita with Pirates would become more interesting than flying in 100% blue null.
---
There we go! I know my post was kind of vague and I was attempting to examine a complex, dynamic system with a simple framework. But I still think it provides some value - be it potentially purely entertaining - or perhaps assurance that CCP is indeed doing their job of catching RMTs semi competently.
---
For at least a few years now the way it works is that the sig appears when someone jumps the hole. If you warp to it but don't jump, after a number of hours it will eventually spawn on its own depending on the type of hole.

Tried to PC you in-game but I just pulled the other post and was about to pull this one. I literally just signed with a group but if it does not work out for whatever reasons I got you info in game!
---
What’s the old way vs the new way?
---
A: "Only for strategic objectives"
---
Not that different from what happened in the earlier days of EVE.
---
Basically the losers sold vital structures to the victors and RR changed alignment for money (?).
---
AoM (Legacy-aligned) and Winter Coalition have their history of enmity and it got carried over to TQ, which is why AoM went to Legacy instead of WC.
---
There were like 10 of varying affiliations and sizes in 2014, let’s go for even more!
---
Like honestly he is not wrong ... but he is wrong }:&gt;       
---
How long players say/did not play in WH space due to lack of "local" ?       
---
CCP ~tries~ to implement no local in EVE ... players quit in huge masses             
---
On the other hand, based on CCP data 30% of population play in nullsec, 5% of population play in WH space.             
---
If CCP was willing to do a risky implementation for 30% population, why not try to do the same with 5% ... **but for sake in a bit more smart way**.                
---
Lack of local in WH space is something that makes this space different and people need different gameplays **and not current CCP approach** that is constantly removing some gameplay and some players engaged in it.               
---
CCP need to rethink what was the goal of WH space and if those goals cannot be reached any more - create new one.             
---
But for sure it cannot keep current status of **safe farmlands** where you can just cut off yourself from rest of New Eden to farm in peace.
---
I am going to blame IAC and ExIAC members for been too drunk to stop this from happening.
---
A) You forgot the part where you were going to list your original solution that no one has ever heard in the past year: "Give Widow's the old ECM"
---
B) There's nothing wrong about a ship being underpowered. Its not ideal, but its not game breaking.
---
C) The real problem is all BLOPs are kinda lackluster when deployed as more than a bridging ship.
---
Fighters drones and ships jammed in the old way couldn't target anything.
---
Wait, let me sell them some titans first.         
---
At this rate i will not use them before eve dies.        
---
Kid will be happy from new toys.
---
Yep. For the first time in 10 years, I’m considering unsubscribing depending on how things go. All this cheating is killing the game. I’m tired of hearing about AoM, botting, backdoor RMT deals, meme loss mails from RMTers, people buying alliances, high sec mining bots, and what clearly goes on in Period Basis. 
---
Once you realize that you’re paying massively inflated PLEX and injector prices so that China can operate RMT farms, you become less interested in logging in. Once you realize that skill injectors and ISK can be purchased on a black market site for a few US dollars each, you stop caring about the game and realize just how many people are cheating to advance themselves.
---
In the near future, when all the honest players get tired of this bullshit, Tranquility will become another Serenity.
---
As a wow player it always amuses me that people think the csm is a wholly bad thing.
---
Honest question what are muricans?
---
I snorted.
---
I wouldn't call Winter Co. an alliance adhering to the "content" ideology though. They are empire builders through and through.
---
Americans
---
What use does an EVE player have for social benefits?
---
Game feels as dead as ever, only difference is now I see 10 ishtars tether up at the same time now.
---
No one wants to fight, they just dock up and wait for NEAR2 to give them the all clear to krab again.
---
I’ve already unsubbed 10 accounts and letting my last one run dry.
---
As a Chinese player, I don't like this thing happened... It's just so weird.
---
Yup, Goon gonna invade the drone region test follow them and wipe everything, Panfam deny content (they can't win anyway)   
---
but i don't think Panfam or WC gonna help Test if Goon invade them, WC hate Test more than anything else, Panfam will loss a shiton of asset and not gonna risk anything else, if war happen between Test/Goon Pandafam will certainly invade Legacy and take some juicy moon in the old WC territory + tenerefis/immensea far from goon in undefended space   
---
there no interest for Pandafam helping Test, maybe eventually if they plan to bait the supercap fleet on a KS timer but that's risky AF, nothing will change you can't win against goon if you play fair
---
&gt;I have absolutely no idea about what impact the blackout had on non-cheating players. Might have been a downswing, might have been an upswing, might have been basically no change. There's no data publicly available on it.
---
Might have been an upswing?? 
---
I see you've trained mental gymnastics to V
---
Literally half the forums were people saying they'd leave, and it was a stupid change. Does this not count because it's an opinion this sub laughed at?? Are those people no longer real players because their opinion differs from yours??
---
Elo wins fights he doesn't win wars. However people conflate one for the other.  He is a damn skilled tactician though.
---
Lmao mad
---
I thought it was Syndicate where coalitions go to be born and die.
---
Ok google it.        
---
Like you are aware that Americans apply the same way to people living in Canada or in Basil ...
---
CSM was an excellent idea, it's a "safety valve" for playerbase to vent their frustrations by voting for people who think will represent them and who in reality have basically no power whatsoever.
---
So basically, like a democracy
---
&gt; }:&gt;
---
the fuck is wrong with you
---
A carebear that doesn't want to die is a cheaterbear
---
Opinion: You should keep your posting to r/leagueoflegends and don't worry so much about the CSM.
---
I read this as 10 dollars and thought "What a waste of money". Now I realise its $10,000 and I'm like......SMH
---
Can you be more precise?
---
Yes.
---
*big bang theory laugh track*
---
\_CSM gives players the illusion that they can steer CCP\_
---
I don't doubt there were real players who didn't like it. Hell, they might have even been a majority of the anti-blackout feedback.
---
Of course the people complaining would have included some of them - as well as every RMT seller, every bot cheat, and every member that could be mobilized to complain by alliances that endorse that sort of cheating.
---
As per my original post, I do not possess the tools needed to analyze the forum posts and eliminate the cheater aligned posts. Were they 15% of the anti-blackout posts? In that case blackout was a failure. Were they 85%? Then blackout was a success.
---
I can't tell which it was, I don't have the relevant information. 
---
Neither do you. Asserting otherwise is Mental Gymnastics 5.
---
Blackout definitely got people back into the game on day 1, lots of people I hadn't seen play in years came back early on. 
---
What isn't up for debate is that the game was in a terrible state prior to Blackout and bold action was needed - even if this specific bold action was a failure.
---
Your internet connection isn't the problem. Shitty hardware is the problem.
---
But mostly, dscan, watch local, don't sit at 0km on a Poco in a c5.
---
So basically, an Asian Mintchip bought your alliance. Got it.
---
Yeah better, because being part of the blue donut and whining on reddit about no war is dumb af
---
While that is geologically true, "Americans" usually means USA.
---
You usually don't think about people living in India or Russia first when someone mentions "Asians".
---
And speaking of google:  [Murica](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Murica).
---
lol what kinda faggot plays albion
---
&gt; I already knew this was gonna happen soon the Chinese started flooding into Tranquility.
---
Because the Chinese invented mass botting, the Chinese made the game f2p(which is a botting death sentence) and the Chinese introduced skill injectors so that you can make bots as easily as possible?
---
The Chinese may be more open about it but if you think all that wasn't already happening under wraps you're delusional
---
the biggest mistake was CCP creating Eve not the CSM being ignored by CCP just like all their players
---
I think there are few players of any kind who actively want to die. 
---
Doesn't make them cheats.
---
Is Villy already PM’ing him back and selling one of his pet “alliances”?  Ao many to chose from...

---
It's not a secret to anyone that null is the safest place to carebear. "There's no bear like a null bear." Blue space is just high sec 2.0. God help you if your waiting for Concord to save you.
---
It doesn't matter that null blob alliances have made null safe as it is. It's the hypocrisy of claiming the risk equals the reward. It's like the CSM's hypocrisy of "caring about the little guy, the small alliances". They don't care about that at all.
---
Best enchants in New Eden?
---
I thought it was 100k?
---
&gt;As per my original post, I do not possess the tools needed to analyze the forum posts and eliminate the cheater aligned posts. Were they 15% of the anti-blackout posts? In that case blackout was a failure. Were they 85%? Then blackout was a success.
---
Cheater aligned posts?? I doubt botters are logging in with all alts on deck to say that the blackout is bad.
---
&gt;Blackout definitely got people back into the game on day 1, lots of people I hadn't seen play in years came back early on. 
---
So they came back just to leave again?
---
&gt;every RMT seller, every bot cheat,
---
Plenty of bots in high sec that have always been there. They don't care for null or the blackout. Also most players are not RMT sellers, or bot cheats. 
---
&gt;What isn't up for debate is that the game was in a terrible state prior to Blackout and bold action was needed - even if this specific bold action was a failure.
---
I mean the blackout didn't make it a less terrible state. It just meant it was less enjoyable for many players. Personally a cannot be fucked playing a game where I need to spam D-scan ad infinitum. It's not fun gameplay, at all. It's fucking tedious. I don't live in a wh cause I can't stand doing it constantly. 
---
I'm happier now that this isn't a requirement for literally any activity.
---
Just about real life money, and that's what the managements of the alliance always want from day 1, finally they got what they want and cashed out in a easier way.
---
or rather: vily enjoys blueing up the entire game
---
Panfam isn't gonna pick goons over test over some moons few regions away lol, let alone anything else. Plenty of under utilised resources in their existing sov.
---
pls go feed midlane or something
---
But then we'll have to post "HERE'S MY SIMPLE SHITTY WAY TO FIX Y" instead
---
…. You lost me when you started in on wormholes.
---
&gt;With the amount of ISK you can make doing L4s and 5s
---
How much do low sec L4's pay then?
---
scythe awesomeness that I think many people overlook is that logi drone bonus, coupled with t2 logi drones it's amaziiiing! It is a bit of an sp investment for the t2 drones though (not a huge investment but still)
---
Yeah, that was a ridiculous idea by CCP.
---
Reducing the only PvE fleet content in high sec by that amount was unnecessary.
---
Well, worth note is your earlier comment where you said that your getting freash sites with 4 cans.
---
 They don't spawn with 4 cans... So these aren't fresh sites...
---
Not bad, not bad...
---
Can confirm
---
I won't call em through and through empire builders, definitely they have a higher propensity towards that side compared to rest of Panfam, but no where near say someone like Goons. They provided and engaged in more content in this Detorid war than goons did for entirety of WWB frankly.
---
Just moved in? Wasn't that two years ago?
---
Tbh INIT is defacto fighting arm of Imperium, the spearhead you may say. But yea, politically you're pets.
---
don't worry boy we won't let ccp nerf you!
---
Well it is hilarious and even it will be more hilarious if CCP allow it to happen.
---
Oh sorry I forgot a human is only allowed to enjoy one video game per lifetime.
---
Whilst I don't disagree, the problem with a "how about you just don't" approach is that people are unlikely to pay for accounts which are an isk drain, it's just not an appealing design. Here, pay me 9.99/month to lose ISK (supers are usually flown on alt accounts).
---
So what you're effectively advocating is reducing the number of accounts online, which is what we're seeing post-cyno changes, a smaller sandpit, but less caps around within it - that could be a perfectly justifiable intentional design, but it does mean less money going to CCP to improve the game and less juicy targets for NPSI groups like Bombers Bar to hunt.
---
I'd prefer some other approach, keep caps/supers as that dream new players strive for, it's the reason i got hooked, but diminish ratting and replace it with other null only pve activities which require caps. Make those pve activities reward something other than ISK - maybe DED/officer related modules, trig related BPC / mats, some new LP type currency or some kind of fuel block for a new IHUB which powers local within the system.
---
go outside and you can earn something called money
---
&gt; So they came back just to leave again?
---
Because the blackout didn't solve the actual problems of lack of conflict drivers. EVE is in an awful state right now, and bold attempts to fix it are needed.
---
Reddit is such a reliable source.
---
&gt;Personally a cannot be fucked playing a game where I need to spam D-scan ad infinitum
---
There's always hisec then. I truly don't mean that as an insult. If you want safe ISK literally go do incursions in hisec and you'll get most of the same cash with even less risk than being a nullbear. I guess you can't match the income of afking 10 rorqs but that's a playstyle that flat out *shouldn't exist*.
---
Null is still supposed to be pvp focused/riskier, and thus have greater rewards. If you want the shinies then you also have to accept the risk of getting ganked. I've only been playing for about a month (actually started during blackout) and I manage to get around jspace and null as a solo player just fine. I've lost a few ships (combined with loot it's at least few hundred million ISK), but I've also made billions exploring. That's a pretty good risk/reward ratio and I'm not complaining. Buying a cap doesn't entitle you to have it paid back just because. A multibillion dollar press will drive nails pretty good but y'know, hammers exist and are much more suited to the task. If anything caps should be viewed as a corp/alliance level investment to act as a "big stick"; line members self funding multiple titans and the injectors to train alts for them is madness.
---
Now you're catching on
---
i am sorry, can you explain it a bit?
---
If he has 6 Mil to his name right now he's a very new-bean. Not really fit for a Stratios Explo ship yet.
---
Finally got brave enough to try and pvp. After hours traveling though low sec and faction warfare zones I finally got some action and my first ever kill!
---
Maybe try "Pancakes" if he wants to stay in PanFam.
---
Sweet, cal navy vs cal pirate ships!

How drawn out was it, or was it over fast?

The only thing I got from this video is that mittens swears a lot and hates CCP. For someone so invested it’s a shame people seem to hold him in high regard.

If people want to come PvP in wormholes the k162 is waiting
---
I think [Large Collidable Object](https://imageserver.eveonline.com/Character/91072482_1024.jpg) was first.
---
If someone bought had bought PLEX for this, they must have been selling it off for months to get enough ISK without crashing the market right?
---
Nice
---
It was over relatively quick, but to me it seemed like an eternity lol.
---
&gt;There's always hisec then. I truly don't mean that as an insult. If you want safe ISK literally go do incursions in hisec and you'll get most of the same cash with even less risk than being a nullbear. I guess you can't match the income of afking 10 rorqs but that's a playstyle that flat out shouldn't exist.
---
Reduced safety and spamming D-scan are entirely different things.
---
I'm happy for reduced safety. I will not however, play a game that requires me to spam a button till I get carpal tunnel in my limited free time. That's not my idea of enjoyment. 
---
Also I bought my first rorq mid blackout because someone was selling it cheap, not sure whether to sell it or use it, I don't even have excavators. The main isk generation in terms of PVE I do in null are carrier ratting or explo. Neither of which can  be AFK'd. Stop assuming everyone has ten rorq alts or plays AFK. I sure as fuck don't, and the same goes for 99% of the playerbase. It's a shitty meme on this sub, and has little basis in reality, play a little more instead of parroting this subs bullshit.
---
&gt;Null is still supposed to be pvp focused/riskier, and thus have greater rewards. If you want the shinies then you also have to accept the risk of getting ganked
---
What shinies? 30mil ticks?? Lmao I can do that in high sec. There is fuck all reward bar explo in null, unless you have a super etc. 
---
&gt;I've only been playing for about a month (actually started during blackout) and I manage to get around jspace and null as a solo player just fine.
---
..I never said I couldn't get around fine? I said I cannot stand needing to mash a button till I get RSI. D-scan simulator isn't fun.
---
&gt;Buying a cap doesn't entitle you to have it paid back just because. A multibillion dollar press will drive nails pretty good but y'know, hammers exist and are much more suited to the task.
---
This has absolutely no relevance to anything I said? 
---
&gt;If anything caps should be viewed as a corp/alliance level investment to act as a "big stick"; line members self funding multiple titans and the injectors to train alts for them is madness.
---
I've seen only 4 titans in game in the years I've been playing (5 if you count an NPC one). If you're truly a new player, you shouldn't concern yourself with things are years away from you, and have no impact on you. You can't form a balanced opinion.
---
Personally I'm not close to a titan at all. However from what I've seen in game, they absolutely are strategic assets, and significantly rarer than this sub implies. You're not self funding multiple titans unless you've been playing for many years, or have a credit card you aren't afraid of using.
---
Reeee
---
How about make a valid point instead of a quip.
---
You can Call them "imperial legacy of the dead fire mango"
---
Worst part is, even with all the proof in the world, CCP won't do anything and ban China botters because of the bitchslap player count would take in the face.
---
Still better than the Post to Win game in this sub.
---
meh...... more like eve's a dead game tbh....
---
When pl paid isk to evac their super fleet after b-r was that pay2win?
---
CSM as an institute is good, most of the time.
---
CCP listening to players is bad, most of the time.
---
Classic disinformation campaign.
---
What did he say?
---
Yea eves dead, firesale our aliances and lets play second galaxy-oh wait they also getting donut already
---
I've interacted with almost every group on that list at one time or another, banderlogs and conifers always impressed me favorably, I'd advise steering clear of rote kapelle and gang bang team, they're kindof assholes.
---
Someone buying CCP and banning the accounts of everyone shitposting on r/eve
---
Is this some sort of flex? Most of the player base is employed and able to purchase isk. They just chose not to because they have an IQ
---
&gt;that could be a perfectly justifiable intentional design, but it does mean less money going to CCP to improve the game and less juicy targets for NPSI groups like Bombers Bar to hunt.
---
What's good for CCP's wallet in the short term isn't necessarily good for the health of the game. Speaking as a new player I ran screaming from null corps because they just want you to max efficiency rat/mine and then maybe get blapped in a frig (which won't happen often because everyone's blue to everyone else and all the "real" fights are cap spam). If I felt I could make a difference in null as an individual player in a small corp I'd be all over it, but as it is I'd be the +1 in an n+1 fleet at best.
---
&gt;I'd prefer some other approach, keep caps/supers as that dream new players strive for, it's the reason i got hooked
---
It's also part of what drew me in. I remember reading news articles about the subterfuge and effort involved in building the first titan. It took an entire alliance months to build just one, it was a huge deal. Now it's "oh another one of the hundreds of titans that [LARGE NULL BLOC] spodded for". If anything capital proliferation has robbed caps of their mistique and luster, and thus their draw as an end game doomsday weapon you work toward for years.
---
My dumb attempts at a fix are as follows:
---
-make it so you can't inject cap skills
---
-take panic off rorqs and give them back old cynos, making them much squishier but also easier to actively defend. maybe buff ehp if this makes them too squishy initially.
---
-make caps and supers bad at "punching down". no more HAWs, no more bosons. carriers could still retain an anti subcap niche but their effectiveness would probably have to be tweaked. this would most likely kill super ratting but if it's not all the way dead then gate the anoms.
---
-as compensation, make caps harder to kill with subcaps, and make them the premier platform for structure bashing: give them the unique ability to burn through the first reinforcement timer with reduced damage. low power structures only get one timer which caps are able to burn through.
---
-limit citadels to "strategic locations" (moons, planets, sun, etc). Don't let them be on grid with gates and other infrastructure.
---
These are probably terrible as I'm new and most of my knowledge about sov null is secondhand but that's my best shot for fixing this mess and moving caps into a a more strategic niche as a corp/alliance level sov tool.
---
So what you are saying is that Horde historically, is just NCdotte's abused stepchild? Thank god for Stockholm Syndrome eh. :P
---
sure you are. but not that one.
---
I du know if it's their bloody payday. Update info says that the committee of RR will spend all this "investment" in game for alliance affairs.
---
If you are searching for more action around Black Rise, try Nennamaila and the area around there. Always a few boys around there looking for fights (be careful with solo, small gang is much more common these days (and a lot more fun imo))
---
Also gz on your kill ;)
---
In fact twacp will allow this happen only if there's no RMT in the whole process of "investment"
---
It's just a alliance have a new shareholder. A shareholder with tremendous amount of dollars in Master Card.
---
Because EVE is a science fiction game, and not science fact game. ;)
---
*Geekmode: engaged*
---
Lore wise though, I think you should read range as "effective range". While most charges would travel near infinitely the practical application on target would be limited by the ability of the offender to track its target; beyond a certain range it be so unlikely to reasonably calculate to track targets that even though the charge would make the distance, chances of hitting that target would be near to non-existent.
---
As mentioned earlier, lasers do diffuse after a while and even projectiles aren't immune to gravitational forces and matter particles in space (yes, even space contains some matter), but that would render charges ineffective at much larger ranges than listed in the game.
---
*Geekmode: disabled*
---
The principle argument remains (and this argument I've made in the Battletech community as well) that sometimes facts get in the way of game balance. It's a trade-off to sacrifice some realism in order to have better balanced gameplay.
---
Thanks for the tip! Unfortunately I have no one to fly with and I'm nowhere near skilled enough to take on multiple people. But, if I'm roaming in the area, I'll definitely give it a shot!
---
"effectively brought"
---
Literally unreadable
---
I hate this statement,  what i have seen from this war it's not true at all.
---
I mean. EVE is a Pay to Win in essence, the only difference for me is that even if you P2W a Titan, if you Don't know what you do, you will lose it. When I played ArcheAge, I remember of a guy named Kong who threw 15K at gold Farmers and 15K at Trion and wasn't banned because of the 15K he gave to Trion. That game was really an ugly P2W.
---
At least in EVE you can get bitchslaped.
---
Serenity here we come
---
Minecraft, bro.
---
Maybe someone enjoys slapfights, I dunno. People were taking part in conflict imitations for years now.
---
And personally, at this point I think the better question is "why would you play EVE?".
---
Obviously none of us truly understand the one China policy
---
RR is full of bots anyway.
---
You my friend see right through this fool. 2day old reddit account. Reeee
---
But if 5T was the paymet - who sold the other 3 T.
---
SC are good people.
---
I have joined a FW Corporation around the area about half a year ago and it's been a blast! I can only encourage you to do the same and try out small gang PvP. There is a lot of interesting people and a lot to learn from them!
---
That's not how elections work. That's not how any of this works.
---
you must be an older retired player, they killed combat refitting years ago
---
reactive plus flex is a good combo post combat refitting nerf
---
So do the RR linemembers get a cut from the buyout? If my CEO sold the corp to a non corp member i'd want a cut. If i didnt get one id go somewhere else.
---
We (or at least the folks I know) are not complaining as much as we point out that the rest of you all have it easy.
---
* Gates? We only have temporary connections you need to scan down and bookmark. Out of probes? You're fucked.
---
* Intel? Well, everything is bait, so let's go balls deep.
---
* Asset safety? You mean loot piñata. (not to mention brutal reinforcement timers)
---
* Cloaky camping? You mean not knowing what kind of nasty is in system with you.
---
* Local? Well, I'd have to give you that... we end up talking to ourselves a lot that results in all sort of crazy. ;)
---
People living in wormhole space choose that lifestyle. And although I don't think others have to live it, I can't help but laugh at some of the salt created when the Chaos era hit. Wormholer BTW. :)
---
&gt; Their consistent, bad-faith insistence to fail to acknowledge that characters consume subscriptions and plex and therefore a higher character count in Omega state is more valuable to CCP than a minority of actual human beings also amuses me.
---
I, for one, am more amused by people who suggest that CCP's well-being is the only thing that matters.
---
I can't guess which local genius of r/Eve made this piss poor alt account but man is it low effort. Biomass this one, try again.
---
Stay Frosty is recruiting, we are a smallish group of lowsec pirates that enjoy solo PVP, ocassional small gangs or fleeting up to kill a big target and have no activity requeriments.

Join the in game channel EVEOGANDA for more info if you are interested.
---
Welcome back o7
---
I can taste the salt right there...
---
Play the game and find out
---
&gt; "why would you play EVE?"
---
i kinda agree. 
---
without meaningful conflicts taking place, the game feels hollow.
---
you have no real reason to do much in eve if big [or several simultanious] conflicts aren't taking place as almost any activitiy that you can think of either feeds in to, or is fed by, conflict.
---
Never whined about no war, been at war all year...
---
You can join any Faction in the war, even if you are Gallente. If you are Gallente, and don't need Gallente Space you can just join a Caldari FW Corp for example. Otherwise you can do it like I did and try it out with an alt first before deciding completely.
---
&gt; So basically, the Chaos Era concepts actually work, without all the salty bitches crying about their sandcastles... 
---
Risk vs reward.
---
Vermin
---
It's low effort, but the kid there is buying (rmt) the shady dude 5trill, which is what AOM used to buy sov from RR or something like that... idk, something like that comes from a few posts today, I started to stop giving a fuck recently so didn't really read all that in detail.
---
Oh yeah. They are content providers because you could farm them...
---
Mate. It's not that they didn't want to build their empire, Goons-style. It's just that they couldn't.
---
I honestly had no idea you could do that, that gives me so many options! Thanks so much for the info! And I already know I'd like it, because I tried it on my first character (before this one became my main).
---
After all United State-n is too long and sounds like German
---
No problem! If you still have questions, feel free to ask ^^
---
What is AOM?
---
So wait is little bunny Chen Chen?
---
The null alliances I've flown with definitely dont want you to max rat/mine. They usually view such players as parasites. They require pvp fleet attendance first, outside of that you're free to do whatever you want from a pve perspective.
---
I think the horse has already bolted, most null players have cap accounts. I personally have 1 subcap main and 3 cap accounts (Fax, dread/titan and super). Blackout for me meant reducing 4 accounts to 1. That genuinely isn't best for the health of the game, PCU dropped from 30k to 20k, CCP recognised that and swiftly pulled the blackout.
---
We need caps to die and cap pve to not reward isk - but still make them good for something else the sandpit will lose too much sand.
---
&gt;hertz ONLY refers to the 'refresh rate' of your cpu's brain.
---
Here i refer to the cpu's brain, its brain. so the apostrophe is correctly used.
---
&gt;once cpus get to 2Ghz, and 4core.
---
here i refer to the cpu getting to to something, or any cpu of the many getting or doing something. no apostrophe as not needed.
---
&gt;all in all threads, silica architecture, and motherboard bus speeds are more important to look at when thinking about CPU's
---
here is a little on edge of truly correct or not, i could say i was referring to the stats of the cpu in question, this would mean the apostrophe is needed. (add stats at the end of that sentence)
---
you could say i was referring to you thinking about any cpu or multiple cpu/(s), to which the apostraphe would be incorrect.
---
my writing skills arnt 5star, but theyre not as god awful as some people do. its reddit not write-it, it was very readable.
---
What's so bad about that one? Whichever one "that one" is... eve or league.
---
Well, I guess I do have two more: Would you recommend I join a human FW corp or one of the npc FW ones. And if human, any recommendations? (Maybe a slightly more casual  one?)
---
Everyone involved in this massive and flagrant RMT operation can seriously go fuck themselves with a spiked club, from the linemember that has proof and keeps silent to you Bitch in the North.
---
Seriously, you are most of what's wrong with MMORPGs in general.
---
Im not sure if youre tying to meme or not, but on the off chance that you have some mental deficiency from your parents being related: people from the united states are called americans, sure you could mean elsewhere but its literally the same thing as saying german or russian. If you ask me what a kraut, im going to say "germans", not "a person from the country known as germany"
---
By that definition, no game is not pay to win.
---
I could pay the best pubg players to carry me. Does that make pubg pay to win?
---
Catus isn't wrong though. Vily is one of the most risk averse big alliance level leader/FC in the game if not the biggest risk averse in the entire history of the game.
---
Can only judge him on his actions. Blue's and or back stabs anyone in the game to save himself/group. Has stated he farms his isk in the most secure space in the game. His actions speak louder than he can try and scream that he is not a donut maker.
---
Just like democracy.
---
As a system it's great.
---
A government listening to the unintelligent masses is a bad thing.
---
&gt;I’m tired of hearing about AoM, botting, backdoor RMT deals, meme loss mails from RMTers, people buying alliances, high sec mining bots, and what clearly goes on in Period Basis. 
---
Are you sure you have 10 years in the game?
---
The only new point in your example is Army of Mango.
---
Botting, backdoor RMT deals, RMT meme losses, buying of alliances, and highsec mining bots, all existed a hell of a long time ago, and occured on the very top end.
---
Chinese gonna Chinese. That's why we need to keep them on separate servers - their culture is simply so bad. Botting and hacking is just acceptable over there, do we really want those people playing on our servers?
---
Definitely a Player owned one. Corp structures are a lot better and some corps even have logistics for transporting items etc.. Well, for what Corporation I can recommend I might be a bit biased ;) I am part of The Pannion Domin (Caldari FW) as a recruiter and I can very much recommend :P. PANN is consistent of about 70/30 EU/US TZ and we mainly fly small gang around Nennamaila. (No mandatory fleets, no minimum playtime or anything, so very much casual)
---
incorrect , CCPs worst idea was changing the amount of characters per account  from 1 to 3 and for incentivize alternate accounts
---
Most people who have 10k to blow generally dont treat it like it's their own 10k to blow.
---
Right after the low sec and high sec gates to Stain.. amiright
---
One of the worst things that TAPI have ever done was to harbour AoM because after these actions buy AoM they have now painted a giant target on TAPI's back from a goon point of view.
---
Damn I don't play Eve anymore but you can poach me for Squad. Does it go on sale usually? It's too steep for me currently.
---
wow...maybe you just wait until your kkk head is dry and you can hide your face ....
---
Don't worry, I definitely detected no bias whatsoever :p. On a serious note however I'll seriously check you guys out, seems right up my ally! Thanks again for all the tips and info!
---
&gt;AOM bought 2 tril isk from an RMT bazar.
---
I did so such thing 😂
---
I have to ask, who takes paper and pen to a meeting about internet spaceships? Maybe just me, but I don't take a paper and pen to RL meetings, let alone to the most serious of business like this.
---
pay to own an alliance, how in any way is this 'winning, or pay to win' lol
---
Well, this isn't even a thing for anomalies? Literally nothing slows you down there. At least this would require raising standings on a bunch of alphas and waiting out 4 hour timers.
---
Agreed, i still play, but pre blackout/cyno changes i paid for 4 accounts. Now i only pay for 1 as the 3 cap accounts are not as compelling.
---
Well sure, I'm actually with you on that, I just figured multiboxing was such a sacred practice that I would be insane to object to it.
---
Now now, that’s not how you speak to a fellow Goon.
---
I mean, dude, I used to belt in Esoteria in a t1 passive shield regen fit myrmidon... honestly if you're having issues with minmatar t2 resists, just skill up or... idk, this is laughable.
---
VNI gets 15m  ticks at 1-2m SP, you know?
---
Most people tend to qualify a game as Pay to Win when players can pay to get advantages other people can't have or need way more game time to have.
---
For exemple, people qualify the shop of games like Black Desert Online or Guild Wars 2 as Pay to Win while they are mainly constitued of QoL improving items. The only game I encountered being really Pay to Win was ArcheAge where achieving best possible gear was near to impossible if you didn't pay because of the chances of an upgrade not failing.
---
So in the end, if you are bad at PUBG and get carrier, you'll still be a baddy even if you are whatever rank you payed to be carried.
---
No.  You just need me.
---
Moving to WHs and then complaining about no local and having to dscan is stupid.
---
Being an null resident and suddenly being told to move to hisec because of a controversial change is not the same thing. 
---
There are arguments to be had, but that is not one of them.
---
A "fellow Goon" huh?
---
Change your flair then... I would still say what I said though. Don't matter if you're a Goon, a Panda or a Dino...
---
Is it players or characters?  I mean 16,000 is really a small number when you consider how many alts will also be logged in.  So how many actual people are on the server?
---
Well my first assumption was that this relates to native American ethnic groups ^(but it is used in negative way) and i was wrong at least partially.
---
So then EVE isn't pay to win, aside from the alpha/omega thing, which can get confusing considering it was subscription first, not free first.
---
Alright racist person. Calm the fuck down.
---
Yeah, the CSM has more become about representing your coalition/alliance rather than representing a playstyle.. that's what's wrong with the CSM, not a lot of candidates have the right mentality about it.
---
I know plenty of people who RMTd 1T+ individually to Chinese alliances, and ISK sellers aren't exactly rare right now.
---
I'm watching this from far away, but it's hard to argue that frat won this war. But I won't dispute elo having won fights along the way.
---
The statement is of course a bit simplified, but from what I've seen I wouldn't call it untrue either.
---
Everything is true in the logs except the RMT of course, of course, and no botting allowed by CCP.
---
Where those people get isk?
---
Selling 10k+ worth of ISK in a dying game with RMT value plummetting 😬😬😬😬
---
I am certain the introduction of alpha status did nothing to exacerbate the botting problem. At all.
---
i know a couple of groups in hisec that mine ALOT of stuff. like 100bill a month kind of lot. you want details?
---
Do to legal reasons Chinese players should play on their own server. Its not about being racist so shut up with this cheap argument.
---
I've only just poked my head back in after years away from the game but this reminds me of this happening a looooooong time ago.
---
Some guy dropped thousands of real money on buying in game money. 
---
He spent it on fancy toys and mercs to cut him out a piece of space.
---
The kidney dried up, he couldn't defend himself, his pay to win empire died as quickly as it came into being.
---
How is this any different?
---
If you don't like that someone has bought success in eve, get some friends and go break his toys.
---
A lot of this reads like you just want a d-scan macro added to the game? Which I fully support, my wrists could use saving too.
---
&gt;Stop assuming everyone has ten rorq alts or plays AFK. I sure as fuck don't, and the same goes for 99% of the playerbase. It's a shitty meme on this sub, and has little basis in reality, play a little more instead of parroting this subs bullshit.
---
The problem isn't with the 99% doing their thing, it's with the 1% spodding their brains out, running 10+ alts and doing things like super ratting. By the same token as telling me to mind my own business, if you're not abusing those mechanics why do you care if they get nuked? I know for a fact that those whales do exist (esp in the big blocs), and the resulting steady accumulation of resources has resulted in isk inflation (making other everyday moneymaking methods less effective if you're trying to plex) and sov null stagnation as the big blocs churn out more and more structures and caps that can't really be contested with anything other than more structures and caps.
---
&gt;What shinies? 30mil ticks?? Lmao I can do that in high sec. There is fuck all reward bar explo in null, unless you have a super etc.
---
Then why live in null? If you get the same money in hisec it's much more convenient to base there and have easy access to hauling and market hubs. Why would people pay to rent systems and protection from the blocs if they didn't turn a healthy profit in doing so?
---
&gt;This has absolutely no relevance to anything I said?
---
The post wasn't a personal attack? There is a general attitude of "If I can fly the big ship, l should fly the big ship". During blackout there were panic posts all over the sub about how no one could possibly safely repay their multibillion farming caps. One of the first things I got hammered into me was to not fly something I couldn't afford to lose multiple times over. Those people still could have undocked in something smaller/cheaper and made some isk while not being 100% efficient, but no, if they couldn't rorq mine or super rat forever safely then they'd just quit the game entirely in a fit of pique. As they were the same people who either paid ccp directly or generated large amounts of demand for plex for injectors and alts, their loss was felt the hardest by ccp's wallet and they rolled over.
---
&gt;Personally I'm not close to a titan at all. However from what I've seen in game, they absolutely are strategic assets, and significantly rarer than this sub implies
---
During blackout goons blew up multiple of their "own" caps for flying stupid. This implies that a) caps really aren't all that rare or special if multiples of them are getting fragged by their own side without crippling themselves, and b) you can be very very dumb and still get to sit in an "endgame" ship and rake in the dough. Neither of these conclusions are particularly flattering to the state of caps and the game in general. More generally, I've seen estimates that goons alone can field 1000+ supers. That's a lot of work and dedication that's clearly paid dividends, but it also points to an ever increasing concentration and consolidation of wealth and power into the hands of a minority of players. That's the point of empire building yes, but it's also resulted in 2 stable mega-alliances squeezing everyone else out and by extension killing a major part of the game.
---
Check out aggressively average, they are a ustz alliance based in lowsec just outside of horde space they are very active there’s 2 corps worth joining there that I know of,
---
one is boennerup Banden which has some really good ustz pvp vets good pilots and FC’s 
---
The other is mostly sober those guys aren’t as experienced  in general but they are game in ustz and there are a lot more of them 
---
I just left boennerup banden due to tz differences as I’m a eu player and that is a deadzone for the alliance, but I’ve flown with those guys for years and they are a great group you should definitely check either one out 👍
---
Army of Mango, PIBC on TQ
---
I just joined horde, horde let you do your own thing which is great! you just havent learnt what that is yet.
---
try going to lowsec (amamake isnt far away) try some 1v1 frig pvp. it can be alot more fun. message 'Jenna Jaggernaught' if you want some dude to do it with, that toon should be in a corp called burning napalm
---
Gave me a chuckle at work.
---
Have an upvote
---
its not horde thats the issue, small gang and solo pvp is still available, but horde cant give it to you, you gotta get it. join up with some buddies and start doing it as simple as that.
---
Hate to break it to you but Fraternity bought 2T+ ISK that I personally know off, presumably more from other dudes too, while setting up their alliance in its current form.
---
XIX also RMTd the vast majority of it's income back when they were on top of the rental scene - notice how they ran out of isk after losing like 3 fleets when they got invaded.
---
Oh and if you want to go super far back, PL and all the similar groups sold some of their income ages ago... Hydra fc man GARMON industrialized C6 red giants on release and made enough to start his own business... Everyone's done it.
---
AoM are nothing new - just more of the same.
---
Technically you compare apples to pears here. America is a term you could use as short term for two continents but is usually used for one country/federation. I think almost anyone would know you mean someone is from the US when called an American.
---
Germany is a single country however you look at it.
---
You don't say someone is an European and expect anyone to know from which country he is, though.
---
tbh, RR probably sells upwards of a trillion per month, so itll probably still pay off.
---
Yep, easy.  Just me subs on 6 accounts has cost 9k
---
it's still bizarre, corporations in eve are nothing like real corporations and they are basically guilds tbh
---
Thats an entire different matter. His reasoning however is racist.
---
how is asking a community which has completely different botting culture to go play on their own server racist?
---
Racism? Stating facts isn't racism. Calm the fuck down with your SJW talk. This isn't an American university, or some other PC-shithole.
---
 Stating facts isn't racism. Calm the fuck down with your SJW talk. This isn't an American university, or some other PC-shithole.
---
No, it isn't. Now STFU and GTFO.
---
So war is over?
---
You are racist, respect other countries/people law scumbag.
---
It's kinda funny that people think that you could contain them on a seperate server, if they want to play on TQ, they will play on TQ.
---
The solution is to log in and kill those bots, not posting about it on reddit hoping someone else will solve your problems for you.
---
The war was fun so legacy won all hail Brave.
---
God damn.. Eve has to be dead when this is still a thing /o\
---
Eh I just run exploration in catch and during autz it's like a free land of money lol. So far made about 800mil in just 3-4 hours it's kinda nuts
---
The way that guy worded it is retarded so i'll try to explain what he couldn't because he has brain damage or something. They do have a different gaming culture over there. Chinese are highly competitive and sadly some take it to the extreme of "winning by all means necessary". That they have to play by rules now they didn't have on serenity (or rather weren't enforced - yes, even less than here) doesn't help that case. Shoule they be separated from the rest because of that? - no, but it is more likely that they will break *our* rules, and understandably not few people are unhappy with this (especially after seeing what happened to Serenity).   
---
  
---
It **is** a problem that should be approached, and just silencing everyone with the "racism"-bat isn't helpfull. But i do agree separation isn't the right thing, that's what the Chinese governement trued for long enough itself and it resulted in their culture being very alien to us, which obviously isn't good.
---
Read my other post in the thread.
---
You're retarded
---
I'll agree that blackout was heavy handed, but the general expectation of safety in null is/was too much. I already have to mash dscan as a neutral flitting through and it's annoying but not the end of the world. What is an acceptable level of precaution to force people to take? Towards the end of blackout groups were already adapting by revising fits to be more survivable and pulling together standing defense fleets. It's not that adaptation was impossible or especially onerous, it just required a moderate change in playstyle. If that change was not enjoyable then isn't it reasonable to not continue living in null?
---
&lt;3
---
If kiddo like you say so.
---
Dont you know?
---
They were lucky and got a few T2 BPO's when they first came
---
Welcome in the 1984 novel geopolitical reality.
---
Yes because getting killed in a subcap without being able to do anything is sooo much fun.
---
Getting killed once in a while while you feel like you're making good isk can be very exciting. I lost my most expensive ship yet just last week. Very Exhilarating. I had made enough money to replace it the day before so it wasn't a bad loss. But if you're grinding boring af anomalies for 50M/h and you get killed as soon as you've made up for the previous loss over and over again because some elite pvp hunters uncloaks their loki or whatever, condemning you to run even more of the same boring shit... How can you not get fed up with it?
---
Blackout was good for people like me who don't rely on subcap ratting but for anyone who's trying to was trying to make isk and doesn't have skills for a capital ship or the money it was game killing. When I first moved out to null didn't have enough money to buy ships for fleets. I could go with a FyF frigate but even though the official policy is that you can use them every fleet I joined I felt that the FC just wanted the regular doctrine ships and nothing else which made me stop going on most things because I felt like a waste of space.
---
You might think people got fooled into hating blackout but you're wrong, most of the leadership in Goons loved it to begin with until numbers dropped.
---
Black ops doesn’t scream “iron clad wall of ehp for brawls”
---
Imagine a tank.  Now imagine an assassin.  You didn’t imagine the same thing for both right?
---
He is specifically stating their gaming culture. 
---
Now that said, a widespread acceptance of cheating to get ahead is by no means limited to any one culture either. 
---
They came here to dominate our server the same way ("Serenity is done, what to do now? I know, TQ is still a challenge").
---
This issue is too complex for one right point of view (like excluding whole groups), but botting in TQ is also now... perhaps not a profitable endeavor for CCP to fix with big sweeping actions anymore.
---
West of Geminate is already on fire by Goon SIG or claimed by local pirates . Try Kalevala Expanse instead.
---
1. but i liked being able to repec my old mining stuff into pvp stuff. why remove that?
---
2. no, all this does is force people to use that keepstar in perimeter even moreso.
---
3. this is dumb, players being able to return or not is what has kept the weak heart of eve pumping. remove any returnability and youll loose huge numbers.
---
how about, skill extraction is allowed once per year, up to as many extractors as you want but it can only be in one go per year. once a skill is extracted, that skill cannot be trained and must have the SP injected to replace lost skills. 
---
then, limit injection. theres no reason anyone should be able to inject more than 20 injectors. 20injectors allows lower sp new players to iject into ALOT of cool stuff should they need, it stops people injecting into capitals with fresh toons, im sure other figures could maybe be refined on this if thought about further.
---
Unfortunately unlike bots, most players don't play 18 hours a day.  
---
Kill a bot and 600 more take its place
---
but it feels like...#us first!
---
&gt;  if they want to play on TQ, they will play on TQ. 
---
Not really. 
---
&gt; The solution against bots is to log in and kill those bots, not posting about it on reddit hoping someone else will solve your problems for you. That goes for all bots. 
---
That has to be one of the dumbest things I've read today.
---
That's like telling people who play FPS games that the "only solution against hackers is to log in and kill those hackers".
---
Fuck off, lol. I have absolutely no responsibility to do anything against bots.
---
unlimited time, not skill count
---
I laughed
---
Its right move that Pearl Abyss CCP bring two servers to one server. More chaos and stuff to dyeing game.
---
Favourite spice is pubbie tears. How do I mine these for slow cook?
---
Losing years worth of effort sucks and I can sympahize. I think the main issue is the tension between the fact that some ships are just better than others and having a game where everyone can contribute and have fun. My understanding was that traditionally eve handled this in two ways:
---
1) Better ships were rarer, making them harder to make and/or buy. This limited their proliferation and kept them special.
---
2) Ships were specialized so that even if others could fly a "better" ship you could still excel in your chosen niche. 
---
Those are both out the window. The huge null alliances can field large fleets of caps and they're generally effective enough at everything that there's no real reason to run anything else. Even counters like stealth bombers could be crushed under enough caps, and the big blocs definitely had enough caps. This lead to n+1 doctrines where numbers mattered most, as everyone was already flying the strongest ships in the game.
---
space is completely dead for hunting powers you’d notice that if you actually undocked outside of delve
---
You mean GSM? GOON STELLAR MANAGEMENT?
---
3, 2, 1, "The Chinese should be region blocked"
---
"You are racist"
---
"It's their culture so it's not racist to say that"
---
Gimme a break. Try saying that to someone else in real life and think how cringy it is. Why does it have to come down to this? Gross generalisation of groups, ethnic or not, is just showcasing a lack of critical thinking. Let it be the Chinese, the Russian, goons (grr), NCPL... Ironically, for all the "SJW" "PC" being thrown around in this sub, /r/eve is deeply indulged in identity politics.  
---
For everything we can take from real life politics, we chose arguably one of the most toxic aspects. No regrets on winning EVE, at least for now.
---
errr you kinda need to go back to translator school m8
---
The ones using various 3rd party applications to avoid interaction with other players.
---
No.
---
&gt; "It's their culture so it's not racist to say that" 
---
Stating facts is not racism. Only SJW retards would ever think so.
---
Region lock China. In all games.
---
No, people are just mad now that they've found out how they've been heckled for being krabs by even greater krabs.
---
lol keep feeding AT ships you fucking retard
---
So you joined QFC?
---
Gatecamp is bad ... m'see ... you better stop wasting your time taking drugs all day being a lazy lokilo on the gate. Move back to your local school and go learn to do a real job like exploration or industry or mining.
---
naaah im kidding :D
---
He used the word!
---
But then it's not free.
---
Lmao “Chinese culture is diferente from ours and they will lickly fuck our servers like they did to theyrs” 
---
“STFU RACIST YOU CANT CRITICIZE NON WHITE PEOPLE REEEEE”
---
Good luck have fun :D
---
What? how? Why?
---
Your racist for treating chinese people diferently from whites both cane take criticism stop white knighting
---
Hmm, I think you're right.
---
dream your dream ... and maybe you will wake up one day finding out that all the things you are calling facts are more or less  **improper generalization** .... in realation towards an ethnic group is nothing else than  discrimination ... O/
---
Ccp added a small amount of shield buff and in the era of hacs ur not gonna see to many uses in terms of the rooks/falcon/blackbirds they are way to slow for those fleets and honestly even feroxs dont really survive in n+1 so they are not really applicable.
---
How ever the scorpion if a high slot was dropped to a low slot u would see them used a lot more in terms of bs fleets ecming enemy logi would still be beneficial. 
---
In terms of the widow as long as the current ecm mechanics stand imo its benefits should be rebalance to maximize dps and to drop the ewar bonuses.
---
In terms of blops unless ur a small gang shooting a super/carrier ur bombers should be n+1 and a few webs/target painters should be able to handle fighters quite nicely.
---
Goes for like 15 or 20 during steam sales
---
Lmao what stop white knighting
---
It's not racism, it's true, they have a poor culture towards tourism as well, documented cases of Chinese tourists sitting on beaches and then burying it, they have poor manners on public transport with spitting and sneezing. Places where Chinese tourists frequent often have their cleanliness standards fall because of it.
---
&gt;Provi are Test pets, and by extension goon pets, and therefore part of the donut.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n5E7feJHw0  
---
Seriously though, Provi-bloc is the only truly neutral entity in the game due to their Not Red Don't Shoot (NRDS) policy.
---
A large portion of Karmafleet is staged out of a highsec system but does all of their content in Nullsec. That means they're Highseccers then?
---
The argument that stating facts is not racism is often used by racists to defend their racism.
---
Ah yes, a gamerbro. The single most misunderstood creature in this universe.
---
No, it isn't. It's entirely factual. Chinese gaming culture is more permissive of botting and cheating than US or European gaming culture.
---
Coke lots of coke, and don't skimp on the hook....aaa
---
actually clueless
---
lol ok krab
---
&gt;It's kinda funny that people think that you could contain them on a seperate server, if they want to play on TQ, they will play on TQ.
---
Banning Chinese IPs from accessing TQ and giving them a separate server would solve 90% of the problem.
---
Downsize any expectations you might have of RL reflections of persona's you have met in EVE thus far.
---
I don't blame the Chinese, I blame CCP.
---
Take actions, find the bots and ban them automatically. Pay some developer for that.  A bot works with patterns, make a program to look for patterns , check the timings, it's quite easy to differentiate a man from a bot. Don't let CCP make you believe it is complex, they just don't want to pay a developer.
---
The bots will adapt , and your detection program should adapt too, so it is not a one shot thing, but it is necessary for the game to make this effort.
---
Tbh when someone say American the first thing that i think is someone from ethnic group native to America, same for German. Russian is bit more distinctive as you have multiple ethnic groups in Russia that were conquered over the time.
---
Ironic that you are so vehemently anti racism yet are also anti American
---
Wait who is getting to burn them now to the ground?
---
When I've noticed who posted this, it became much more hilarious and sad at the same time.
---
I love how people are trying to spin this as racist.
---
It's not, but there is a confusion between "Chinese Eve player's culture is so bad" and "Chinese Eve players suck because Chinese culture is so bad".
---
"Every argument I don't like is racist", the child's guide to arguing on the internet.
---
TBH i could say "it does in totalitarian China" but for sure someone will jump out out of the bushes and start to call me racist so i will just stay quiet
---
Ok but who will they fight or who will fight them?
---
Large-scale trends can hold true even if they break down on the small scale. Just because not every Chinese player engages in botting or other harmful practices does not mean that Chinese players as a whole do not have a systemic problem with botting and other harmful practices.
---
The infrastructure like citadels and IHUBs usually doesn't disappear. Granted, the timers are going to be cancer.
---
Nice.
---
Already korean buyed this game.
---
from umbrealla-protected maximized multibox farming setups running the equivalent time of 2 full time jobs per week ...
---
Grats.
---
If you want to find a 1v1 frigate fight in less than "hours," fly something other than a worm! Lol.
---
Because some people need help validating "progress". Yes yes, I know it's decidely un-EVE but seriously, does it matter to you? Especially considering you didn't even know it existed.
---
The general problem with too much safety across the board in null comes from citadels. We used to have a balance between station systems with high QOL for crabs that made excellent targets and one giant warp to that could be bubbled and systems with POS to safe up/live out.
---
Most bigger groups used those POS systems to crab but not to stage out of, so there was travelling all day that could be interrupted, pipes could be camped and had to be defended.
---
Next capitals/supers/(boson) have to earn less. For that i would suggest to rework rat composition and spawn points to be less convenient for big ships.
---
Subcaps should earn more but be less multi boxable. Easiest way to do the latter that comes to mind is to make drones not aggressive towards rats. You have to actually do something but that should come with higher rewards. Perhaps increase ISK for smaller rats or smaller sites.
---
Mining should be fleets of barges with a booster imo. Even one off grid rorqual per system would be an improvement over the current system imo. At least it puts ships without invulnerability on the field.
---
&gt;3, 2, 1, "The Chinese should be region blocked"
---
&gt;"You are racist"
---
&gt;"It's their culture so it's not racist to say that"
---
&gt;Gimme a break.
---
Except that the original statement isn't racist. Nobody is saying that Chinese players should be banned because of their race, that would be retarded. We are saying they should be banned because of actual, demonstrable, significant trends towards the use of botting, RMTing, and other harmful practices as compared to the general population. Behavior which is legitimised and encouraged in their gaming subculture at a far greater level than in any other region's gaming subculture.          
---
           
---
&gt;Gross generalisation of groups, ethnic or not, is just showcasing a lack of critical thinking.
---
Deliberate ignorance of demonstrable trends is, ironically, an even greater demonstration of a lack of critical thinking.
---
&gt;No regrets on winning EVE, at least for now.
---
Your unearned moral superiority has been noted.
---
Ok, noob question incoming: Why? I mean it isn't that high tier of a ship.
---
No. Sorry but you should field some risk of loss when jumping on a capital, jamming fighters out was overpowered. You can blow them up just fine, even though you might sometimes lose a ship or two. Enough risk aversion ideas.
---
I haven't seen anything about staff numbers being reduced. Do you have a link to that info please?
---
&gt; Banning Chinese IPs from accessing TQ and giving them a separate server would solve 90% of the problem. 
---
Because there is no way to get around an IP ban...
---
&gt; devs need to attack the root cause of the problem 
---
The root cause is not bots from whatever country, the root cause is scalable resource generation that is easily automated and multiboxed. Touching that would probably generate as much screaming as the moon changes and blackout. Do I want CCP to do it? Hell yes!
---
&gt;	completely different 
---
You say that like people haven’t been mad about Russian botting since 2003, and as if EU/US never do the same. The cultures A.) have very little to do with it and B.) are mostly the same once you remove the language barrier
---
I'm deeply convinced that CCP is totally fine with Omega botting. Just take a look at L4s, bots could run them as Alphas and it got nerfed, why ? Cause Alphas don't bring money to CCP. At the end of the day, I'm 100% sure that CCP is telling themselves "Yeah they bring money so who cares".
---
Finding bots would be so easy if they wanted to. Just look, when I was at m peak of ratting like an autistic fuck, it was doing at max 7 to 8 hours of ratting per day, by hand. This is a number that pretty much noone would inflict himself. Bots rat 23/24, CCP just needs an algorythm that detects unusual Numbers of hours spent ratting. Then, they should check the player's chat logs to see it he talk to his corp/alliance/private.
---
If you crosscheck these two things and they are positive, you already have a solid 90% chances of them being bots.
---
CCP just doesn't want to take acts, Hilmar Always saw EVE as short term profit. It was the case with Citadels, with injectors, with Rorquals and it will ever be that way, sadly.
---
This isn't a "biological fact", *that* would actually be racist. It is a *factual observation about their gaming culture*. Which would be very different from a generalization about their culture as a whole, but even there, there is an observable and not insignificant sample of people who think it is okay to cheat to get ahead in things like academia, or who are willing to employ nepotism in hiring or contract bidding practices.
---
These observations still aren't racist unless they are being used to justify hatred or discrimination. Not wanting to let someone ruin something you enjoy and care about because of values differences about respect for rules, isn't racist. Not in the slightest.
---
Speaking of which...
---
Carbon is such a meme among explorers, but I've never bothered to learn what is it used for. What requires it?
---
&gt;Because there is no way to get around an IP ban...
---
Hence why I said 90%. Serenity worked, at least until the economy collapsed and CCP decided it wasn't worth it to maintain a separate server.
---
Well, it is true that the logged number is raising, but I wonder if it will still raise until October or if it will stabilize to this level.
---
For the moment, zero corpmates who stopped playing because of the Blackout did come back :(
---
well done! feeling them shakes?

it is the higher tier of t1 frigate that not many engage, that and garmur. Everyone will engage you in a rifter or some other t1 crap, worm is a different beast

No and ignore those saying it's dying. People have been saying it's dying since it was released. If you fancy trying it try it. As several others have said, get into a player corp quickly and you'll have more fun and learn faster. I've been playing for over 10 years on and off and I'm still having fun with it.

Both are buffer fit so it should be quick.

Just join caldari.

Or stop going to squid space.

What would I remove though?

us= you and me not USA ... but ...

i am afraid you are right  my friend.  One more reason to focus the blame on CCP and not finger point the Chinese or any other group. There is a breach in the system and people will abuse it, this is human nature.  Fix the system, or you will lose the players.

What's squid space?
---
Starting it off with a bang dude! Not even a flimsey Slasher or something, a bigbro navy hookbill rightaway. Good job dude!
---
So they start forming TQ after Serenity, little rabbit lu was "Queen of the North" already on Serenity, some kind of PIBC-Governor of the North while PIBC-Main-Staging was in Delve.
---
Alli is fine ...
---
&gt; It is a space where major Chinese EVE player blocs would post announcements (some fake) and spin narratives.

So entirely unlike /r/Eve then. We all know r/Eve posters are pillars of honesty!

It's all about making them think you are taking them all on, and then outmaneuvering the blob and picking on solo targets that got too interested ;)

If they spend the majority of their playtime playing in highsec then yes they're highseccers.

That's a completely separate issue. Botting has always been rampant and uncontrolled, it's just the characteristic of the botters that have changed.
---
It has always been a problematic and endemic issue, and in the context of the meta game has always been around too, which was the point I was addressing for the above chain poster.

Ah yes, Brother and Sister Mona Lisa. Been trying to grab their Jackdaws for a while, but man thats a tough job.

given there are a 118 system with no respawning sites the income downgrade for the average member would not be worth living there.

you might get 300 dudes that have farm holes if you take them all with 2 or 3 dudes per farm hole, so you get a lot of roll take hole control bash a GSF structure and GSF doing the same to other entities, while C6's might be you best bet as rage rolling is the least painful, it's still gonna mean rage rolling.

Thanks! I literally jumped out of my chair when I killed it!
---
Squid is a racial slur targeting Caldari.
---
I think it's because Caldari and Calamari kind sound the same, but I don't know.
---
Personally as NC member think I would put an alt into goons and shoot testicles.  I would not waste my time defending test 
---
I have respect for goons, even if its not the way I play the game.  I have zero for test
---
Stay on topic here, enough of the 'muricans :)
---
elected? I lmao, so do the founding fathers maybe
---
Ah, thanks for the clarification ;).
---
I was talking about C3s and wormhole sites not abyssals. Fair point about abyssals. Also, I said "good tank" not "max tank".
---
I mean its 1dq, we built a ball out of factions forts there just because we can.
---
This is what I hoped you meant when I read it but it needed to be clarified
---
Even Olmeca would disagree with you.
---
Guys I talked to in main server who admitted to Botting were all Serbian. Should we region block them too?
---
CCP has no real obligation to listen to the player base at all. They could decide to replace all ships with cutsie Anime characters and there's fuck all we could do about it. (Except stop playing. But lets be honest here: we wouldn't. (But then, I'd probably like that change...))
---
The CSM has no power, and it inevitably ends up with some unfortunate candidates, but it's in no way a bad thing for CCP devs to be physically interacting with and essentially forced to at least pretend to care about player opinions on occasion.
---
It makes it a lot harder to ignore people when they are sitting right in front of you.
---
I could go on about the intricacies of Chinese culture, which far advanced our own, even the Greeks by a thousand years. They are proud, and trained from birth in the idea of the State and their role in it. 
---
In effect, the Chinese *ARE* the Caldari. But I digress. 
---
What’s important is not *our own* ideas of the Chinese, but rather *their* ideas of us. 
---
I would argue that it’s not so much the individual Chinese player that’s the problem, it’s more their government. Serenity was a free for all but very slowly started becoming a tightly controlled PvE-fest, with a mere two massive main groups set blue to each other. Why? I’d argue that it’s the cultural part of the equation. They know how to tightly bond and work together to achieve unity and make massive gains. 
---
But the government. Yeah. A non Chinese can easily go to China these days, but once you land you are under intense scrutiny and tracking by the Chinese intelligence branch of the PLA. Yep. Your chatty tour driver is probably at least an informant or maybe even an intelligence agent. The point is they trust no one. They are highly intelligent and driven to be the top dogs, and they have a long history of doing whatever it takes to get there. Lying. Cheating. Stealing. If it’s your enemy, *there are no rules*. 
---
Chinese hackers and botters are sometimes trained by and work for the military intelligence sector. It’s in their interest to develop and test these programs in whatever setting they can, and what better than a server on an international MMORPG game? By carefully herding along the eventual death of Serenity, they can move in force to Tranquility. In my mind, I’d say it’s gotta be the wealth of personal information they can glean from a group of people through the framework of the game. And while RMT is heavily punished on their side, they turn a blind eye if a Chinese does it over here. So now Pearl Abyss, a Chinese company, is the parent company of CCP. They’re more than happy to make a few million a year, but having another are of Western civilization to expand their cyber capabilities is what drives them. 
---
Anyway, that’s my opinion.
---
He's joking :)
---
Actions were taken... to make botting easier, with the introduction of skill injectors and then alpha accounts.
---
&gt;That's why we need to keep them on separate servers - their culture is simply so bad.
---
Because only the Chinese bot, right?
---
lmao
---
New CEO would have a difficult time with that

The worm is the strongest frig allowed in the novice and everyone knows it

Isn't that what they used to call the leaders of the group that destroyed Serenity?..

I'm getting kind of nervous now.

&gt; Black and latino people cant be racist sorry
---
that´s a pretty racist thing to say
---
In Soviet Russia, leader chooses you!
---
*(That's fine, FYI. The Russians DGAF)*
---
&gt; which has completely different botting culture (completely inacceptable to us)
---
You're delusional if you think westerners don't bot. A week doesn't go by without some western corp or even alliance getting accused of mostly being a bot farm.
---
Ah, never mind then, carry on, don't mind the sound of wooshing over here :p.
---
You listed QFC members. Did you just go to sov.space and list off their "neutral" groups that they refuse to update?
---
Goon SIGs basically got fucked in the last couple of weeks, as PH started to invest into getting them out
---
And didn't want those other constellations anyway
---
Wait there's already one in space?
---
No, but i simply asked 'WTF is this?' as wtf is this.
---
Not sure off top of my head, but I could PLEX an account just off of high sec L4s if done with right corporation. The real ISK is in the LP.
---
That was probably a random untrue statement but if you want to tinfoil it a bit:
---
AOM, once it reaches the strengths it had on Serenity, would make TEST the main power on TQ. TEST may have blued them early for that possibility (+ there is so much null space that it's cost free to just give it away). But so far, I don't think we've seen the level of mining in the TEST/AOM regions that Goons currently enjoy and it is minerals that make Titans, not ISK.
---
A rich fuck bought alaska off russia and then gifted it to the us. Hate how history is being rewritten to say The US government were the ones who footed the bill.
---
OBLIGATORY DREDDIT IS RECRUITING
---
Goons and PH 😉we fight each other wherever we can 😄 so not part of that“blue donut“(which never existed)

I'm not quite sure why I didn't get to joining you folks back then.

Oh well. I'm definitely not de-winning EVE though.

---
Unfortunately we do not have a version of Abyssal music available on our sound cloud :/. It's slightly different than our other tracks in that it dynamically changes and doesn't have a beginning and end like the older music in EVE so it's a bit harder to simply upload it as is.
---
I have a better solution. 
---
We should region-lock China in with Brazil until one or both of them agree to shape up.
---
If anything its jingoistic by definition, but racist is a hot word now.
---
You are either pretending to be naive - which makes you stupid - or you are genuinely ignorant.  Either way, shut up.
---
Can you explain me something?          
---
Like how do you get Chinese characters in EVE that have no Chinese localization on TQ?
---
Waffles are recruiting, we could use more EUTZ players to be honest but East Coast USA isn't bad at all.  We live in a C2 with a C5 and null static.  I will vouch anyone that flies nano battleships.
---
Wouldn't it just fall back to people buying and selling characters?
---
I don't think that the Chinese intelligence service cares about mining ISK.
---
Jingoistic* racism has to do with a race, not nationality or culture.
---
What's the deal with bots these days?
---
"*...There's one place I want to bot, since I left Serenity*"
---
Im so sorry for your intellectual disability. Can't help bot's spaming "retarded", "racist" on reddit. Let's hope they will fix your AI soon enough to have adult conversation.
---
I don't think that Dunk is rich enough.              
---
TBH i wonder if Aryth could just buy the RR.
---
Just look at the level of the current bots and tell me you cannot see the difference. 
---
The first version of the bot detecting program could be very simple too.
---
Of course the bots will adapt, That is why i say you have to pay someone full time for that. But there will always be ways to make the difference, it is just a matter of will from CCP.
---
It's because the word "racist" provokes a visceral reaction in people. By branding a person or argument "racist" you can get a lot of people to uncritically reject them or their arguments without actually thinking critically about them. The word "racist" is the last hail mary of someone who knows they can't contest a point on its merits.
---
Where do they wanna run to? They are trapped in Deklein ... if scam, they will have to run to HS, as Mango will eventually just burn the space down and take it anyway.

&gt; The first one is legit and debatable, the second is an idiotic generalization. But [/u/Blazed9000](https://www.reddit.com/u/Blazed9000/) shouldn't play on the ambiguity like they do if they wanted to be clear. 
---
No, you should just stop being a retard, that's all.
---
Chinese GAMING culture is cancerous, utterly fucking cancerous. Why? It must come from their general culture, that's how things work.
---
There's no ambiguity, both things are connected.
---
It gets harder and harder for me to defend brave with every passing week. I knew it was downhill from bluing mangos but i never imagined it would be this bad.
---
So I've just started playing after a long hiatus.
---
Alpha clones from my perspective seem like a decent idea, I can pootle about and see if I can be bothered to play again. 
---
What proof do people have that bots are abusing them?
---
We have a lot of them as eve is old game so it was plenty time to create them.       
---
PVE is also veeeeery predictable and most of the times it also follow the  same rule like PVP "hell dunk or blue balls".
---
Not anymore man. With it being every other word you hear, its lost its impact. like the word fuck. It's just commonplace now.
---
Sounds like a good operation to me, invest in a heavy bot alliance (just look at the MER before blackout, And the next one after blackout is lifted is going to be awesome for them pretty sure) and RMT all the money generated by the bots until you start making money from the initial investment.
---
This is so sad, burn guardians of the botters.
---
Ouais ouais, logan pls !
---
I won't bother responding to your comment because /u/mineus64 already destroyed you.
---
I made so much isk on the goo changes even without knowing it.
---
&gt;find the bots and ban them automatically
---
This isn't effective. Either the false-positive rate will be so high it will drive people from the game or the false-negative rate will be so high that there's no point to the system at all. Especially in EVE, where bot behaviour and player behaviour are hard to realistically distinguish. 
---
Sure, bots tend to play the game continuously for hours on end, but if CCP starts banning characters that play for too long each day then hundreds of legitimate players who simply play for anomalously long periods of time will be unfairly banned while the botters will just rework their bots to only play for short periods each day and just run more bots at a time. Reducing the length of time to trigger an auto-ban just sweeps up more legitimate players in the net.
---
So are people writing their own bots? Cant CCP block them or sommin?
---
Rule One of programming: That which is easy to conceptualise is rarely easy to implement.
---
Are you actually stupid enough to think that the only people who can be racist are whites? Or are you just trolling?
---
&gt;90% chances of them being bots
---
A 10% false-positive rate is *wildly* unacceptable.
---
Holy fuck, I've not seen anyone be *this* disingenuous in a long time.
---
I don't know, from your comment it seems I was rather 100% correct =)
---
I'm not here to judge cultures though. I mean, none beside /r/eve's of course, the finest of all.
---
It's not random, it's logical in that TAPI/AoM are pretty much the only "power" that is a threat to the goons. Not the first time test will have stabbed them is it.....
---
This is an ignorance of demonstrable reality so great it makes me concerned for your well-being. It is absolutely demonstrable that Chinese gamers engage in illegitimate practices in gaming at a rate that is statistically significantly higher than that of the average player.
---
Because a huge part about solo PvP is looking engagable. Especially in FW it´s more of a pre-fight mindgame between the parties involved and if both parties come to the conclusion that they have sufficient chances of winning the match-up they will comit to the fight. A worm is and instant deal-breaker for 98% of the solo stuff you will come across.
---
"Group X bots more than average" is not the same as saying "Group Y does not bot". Stop deliberately misrepresenting people's arguments you disingenuous hack.
---
If CCP cared for what remains of this game and its integrity, they'd block all connections from China. Sorry, but their culture of win at all costs including cheating cannot be allowed to destroy what's left of this game.
---
As a co-founder and original CEO of Signal Cartel and now in a "behind the scenes" leadership position, stories like this make me really proud of the community we've built around a fairly difficult play style (neutral, peaceful explorers). I think I'm most proud that we teach new players to "boldly go" into the most dangerous places and help equip them to do so. In January, it'll be five years since Signal launched and I'm still surprised at the positivity we get from the New Eden community. Many thanks!
---
CCP isn't new to fighting bots. There is a mix out there of well written bots, badly written bots and players that behave like bots. For human eyes they all may or may not immediately look like bots, but to distinguish them scientifically is incredibly hard.
---
CCP has stated in the past that they have been surprised by how "autistic" some real humans farm in this game.
---
&gt; I don't know, from your comment it seems I was rather 100% correct =) 
---
Nope. 
---
&gt; The first one is legit and debatable, the second is an idiotic generalization 
---
The first one is 100% legit, and so is the second one. Stop being an SJW cunt, and start fighting the problem.
---
The Chinese are the problem, and we solve that problem by getting rid of them from our servers. They can go bot, hack and do all that other cancerous shit they love to do, **on their own servers.**
---
Your saying white people are inferior to blacks and latinos thats racist as well
---
You remember Ferrogel 2008 ? Creating the most valuable R64 reaction out of nothing with a POS-Bug ?
---
You're right, but I think that the AoM thing and alpha bots may just be bringing the issues more into the light. Naturally, you could have found accounts of botting and RMT, but the average player who doesnt visit reddit wouldn't know it. I personally can't recall running into quite so many bots pre-Ascension, so it could be that while the underlying issues have not changed, they are simply more visible now.
---
While the last few paragraphs are a bit tin foil hat-y, the "their ideas of us" nails it. It's why Chinese tourists are often the worst when visiting foreign countries or why Chinese gamers go batshit crazy at "Taiwan numbah one". Sinocentrism is a defining part of their culture.
---
Which is unfortunate, and would provoke some reflection and soul-searching in those who overused it...if it weren't the case that they overused it due to a lack of critical thinking skills.
---
As flattering as this is, you really should compose your own arguments rather than falling back on the arguments of others. If nothing else, it's more intellectually stimulating.
---
Thank you, I'll look into the kind of equipment being used on me and see if I can counter it (relatively) cheaply
---
You know that certain NC and PL directors/leaders paid their rent via RMT.
---
Just sayin.
---
Show me quotation. You are probably addicted to word racist, can you use any other words or your dictionary is so poor?
---
Don't misquote me fuckhead. 
---
Try reading what people actually say instead of just seeing what you want to see.
---
&gt; Just take a look at L4s, bots could run them as Alphas and it got nerfed, why ? Cause Alphas don't bring money to CCP.
---
No, lol.
---
They removed alphas access to lvl 4s, cause alphas are easy to replace, and for distribution missions, you'd need maybe a day of skill training.
---
So CCP could ban those bots, and next day a new set would already replace them.
---
What that makes no sense at all
---
I know right .
---
This is the internet, friend. I don't have to do anything. And in any case I've written enough arguments about this, I have no need to repeat myself to these utter morons.
---
yet hes telling truth
---
Trolling of course, if someone is calling unknown person a "white knight" on internet its just stiupid. People are abusing populist words to hide their lack of education. 
---
Or its a simple troll bot, spaming reddit to get new data and make some real people mad.
---
Ugh, another botter.
---
Quite recently i found a bug that let you make 20bil in 5minutes.       
---
Reported to CCP in 10 minutes it was fixed already but i cannot say what it was.
---
I mean... they have rooms full of prisoners that are tasked with Gold mining in WoW all day, that they then sell off. I'm sure that they would do the same with Eve
---

It does not work this way.          
---
Especially with alpha accounts as you can just cycle your VM and have next bot running in 3 minutes.
---
&gt;I’m not going to just feed ships to a super.
---
Clearly you're just a risk-averse wormhole idiot that can't handle a fair fight. /s
---
I'm sorry, but since when is an individual responsible for crimes of his surroundings?
---
&gt;What if they don't want to?
---
Then they can bloody well play another game. This is EVE, you consent to PvP the moment you undock.
---
Nah.
---
yeah man, i could be bought for the low low price of one popeye's chicken sandwich right about now
---
can't fuckin find them anywhere
---
The whole test pet thing is just HTP propaganda dude. Sure they'll come shot them if that's an option, but then why wouldn't they. 
---
They are down in provi practically every day shooting provibloc dudes. I'm not sure why HTP thinks they wouldn't be a well.
---
byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
I don't think you know, at all, what any intelligence community is interested in.
---
Worm is just so much stronger than Hookbill, it's not even a contest.
---
Banning bots doesn't do anything though. They will just roll over to the next account.
---
What you really need to do is find all the ISK laundering structure beneath and identify all the brokers, etc. The problem is, detecting and tracking those networks before you can ban them takes a long time and during that time, the ISK and items might have gone through the universe a couple times, so you can't just roll everything back.
---
To really do this task, you don't need one developer, you would probably need around 50 and convince them to leave their well paid former jobs, which is tracking those transactions in the real world.
---
Saw this pic on social media, saw it has "EVE" in it. Thought "abuse this pic on r/eve somehow!".
---
Then thought "Hmmmm, who might have bought something 'forbidden' in EVE recently...", knowing the answer in advance. Rest is history ;)
---
the sides were set before that, ncdot and frat have been blue for years
---
by that same (stupid) logic, you don't lose fights, you lose wars?
---
China isn't a race you dipshit. If I was racist I'd said fuck all those cheating Asians. But hey, Japan is cool and chill guys to play and chat with. Korea is cool. Vietnam.... Idk if they even play but they are cool. But Chinese gamers and their 'winning by any means' ideology. Yeah..no. They ruined allot of good survival pvp games aswell and I've been on the front line to have gotten the taste of Chinese aimbotters and shit lile that. They went from server to server to purge the servers from any non Chinese.
---
Tbh what is going on in Period Basis.       
---
Thats like next door and apparently i am not aware about something.
---
&gt; CCP has stated in the past that they have been surprised by how "autistic" some real humans farm in this game.
---
considering it's some of the most basic and scripted PvE in any MMO on the market - and the game automates most of it for you (auto cycling modules, aggressive drones, etc)
---
how the fuck is it a surprise that activities that can be done with 3 inputs per hour are done for hours on end? the game bots itself half the time.
---
Because we all prayed really hard?
---
It is a system of one man one vote, the CEO is the man and he has the vote!
---
Western pussies just got out-botted, out-exploited and out-EVE'd.  
---
That's why they're so salty towards the Chinese.
---
The Chinese are region blocked in many games because they ruin it for everyone else. There are 1.2 billion Chinese people, I think they are fine on their own servers.
---
/devcommand trollbot shutdown -f
---
&gt; Then, they should check the player's chat logs to see it he talk to his corp/alliance/private.
---
given that almost all of my eve related communication happens on jabber/discord... talking in channels proves nothing. shit, other than fleet chat i don't remember when i actually typed anything in to an in-game channel in the last couple of years.
---
if i had separate isk making and pvp characters like many people do - i'd argue that my pve character would've never used an in-game chat channel in their existence.
---
&gt;they don't truly go after each other
---
There's a couple of factors that go into that. Evicting someone is a giant PITA and unlike nullsec there's no meaningful territory to be gained from it, because holding multiple holes is logistically difficult. Additionally, it's better to keep your opponents alive and well to give you more content than to fuck them over and risk them not coming back. The same is largely true in nullsec, as many gains as Imperium might make against PanFam or as Legacy might make against WinterCo., neither side of those conflicts will ever seek to completely wipe out the other.
---
Frank please Don't be a baltringue !
---
But my mom says I'm special
---
ok, well demonstrate it without just citing general statistics. Give me proof that the Chinese players of EVE Online, on TQ, are botting at proportionally higher rates than the general population
---
It’s the same person
---
I used to play I  2013, people said it was dieing back then too
---
Though TBH at this point we might as well be.
---
Because they got reuploaded multiple times with lower res versions and so on. So the real numbers would be probably 3x as high
---
Yeah, but there’s anti-cheat methods that’ll detect bots decently.   Once you hit an unusual level of farming, display an unusual window that asks a trivial question.  But don’t block the UI.  Either the player responds quickly to the new window (pass).  The bot detects something has changed but doesn’t know what to do, and docks up (fail) or the bot merrily continues clicking buttons (fail).
---
Fail three times in a month and you’re totally a bot. 
---
CCP currently has the ability to run arbitrary python on the client.  All of these windows would be dynamic server side, so the client won’t have fore-knowledge of the window contents, so bots can’t code for the situation.
---
You are actually braindead
---
&gt;(not to mention brutal reinforcement timers)
---
Adding to your list: Want to kick someone out of their space, necessitating a multi-day op? Better seed scanners in their hole, and hope they don't get scanned down and die or get rolled out before they can scan a route in for your guys.
---
The individual you call a "dumb bitch on the side" is one of the people in charge of the NPSI community you were flying with.
---
It's entirely her prerogative to decide whether your behaviour was or wasn't welcome. How unfortunate for you not to realise that.
---
If you aren't happy with her rules of conduct, I would recommend you create your own NPSI community and ree all the things.
---
Guys I checked, he's right
---
If I weren't broke I'd gild this.
---
Are you serious?
---
Cheating is culturally acceptable in Chinese gaming circles.
---
I am pretty sure SortDragon is just a Bot.
---
Your argument is actually a great demonstration for why PCU is a completely shit metric. You used four accounts. But only one was likely active doing anything in space.
---
Super cap proliferation killed anything besides turtling in a massive alliance.
---
How long did you thing about it?
---
if that time is like 18 straight hours - i feel we should ban those legitimate players for their own health.
---
honestly - i don't care how legit it is, playing for 18 hours straight is just not good for you even if you aren't breaking any rules.
---
please sleep, shower, and move around a little.
---
Pretend as though killing rolling ships just isn't a thing.
---
Asteros have surprisingly little mass.
---
there is only one Queen in The North, sorry, that moniker is currently occupied.
---
Education bad
---
Brave is a very poor alliance.
---
well ccp blocked them from running/spawning lvl 4 missions https://www.eveonline.com/article/pn66sg/security-update-q1-2019 "After investigating further, the decision has been made to place all level 4 and 5 missions behind the requirement to have Omega status, to assist the fight against RMT and botting."
---
If you are part of a population that cheats in online video games at a significantly higher rate than the general population and you are upset about the fact that your population is being separated from the general population in order to improve the playing experience of the majority, maybe your response should be to try and encourage other members of your population to cheat less.
---
I have felt this way, or I used to for a long time but if you look into it, even Goon CSM who everyone loves to grrr at will argue against their alliance's best interest if that interest is harmful to greater EVEs health.
---
Surely CCP could detect a client running in a VM.
---

RMT?
---
&gt;Legacy people are down in provi practically every day shooting provibloc dudes. I'm not sure why HTP thinks they wouldn't be targets a well.
---
that's called sustainable farming

Aww, couldn't copy/paste your npc garbage for this comment too?

None of the groups I listed currently live in Querious. Did you just make up some random shit and call it an opinion?

Mad because I'm right? Stay mad, SJW. We feed on your tears.

Rote is pretty good these days. I think the elitist assholes moved to Integritas

Lol
---
lots of scoots, lots of venture, a pair of RR BS, industry, PI  
---
WH btw
---
"play"
---
i think you have this false idea stuck in your head that’s ruining your game for you. look at all those 2.0 space deaths, rorqs, supers, carriers, zkill itself must be a lie to you aswell, none of its real to you lmao. it must be the blue alliances controlling that as well. go ahead pretend like concord doesn’t one shot hostile gank fleets, those catalyst don’t even exist. you must be so terrified you don’t undock from your uncontestable highsec station where no one can push you out of. all players are perfect and are just waiting to drop on you lol. it must suck to be too afraid to play your game. oh look zkill reports more ship deaths, krabs ganked, fleets going head to head, hunters and whaling fleets preying on those who think they’re safe or just not giving the attention the gambit deserves. it’s ok none of it exist in YOUR GAME, it’s a sandbox where you’ve decided not to create, destroy, or undock. it’s ok, sit in your corner and cry about playing your own game, oh look zkills reported more content being had by those willing to contend and create content. careful don’t look, the truth could hurt you, it’s almost like undocking and actually playing your game.
---
Just check google/ github. Game can be easly injected with pythoon scripts, there are no buildin defense mechanics to prevent memory leaks. I would tell you can easly create a bot after few months of programming.
---
There are beta bots to runs abbysal sites as well for 3 months now or even longer :D
---
Make this subreddit better by banning people who post "how to fix eve!" posts.
---
Seeing lots of players that didn't want to triple box gate watchers coming back.
---
The sov was for renters before. Some month ago we start to put the main alliance here too. So now there is one part for renters and one part for I + IM.
---
In no way WC will take our sov.
---
Chinese is a nationality not a race smart ass
---
Yes, yes. Provi are sheeple, farmed by all, etc etc... We are all very impressed by your very cleaver and original blah blah.
---
Even tho that logic kind of contradicts the concept that Provi would become part of the doughnut. We are by far the most reliable source of content down here. If anything TEST ought to be motivated to kick RC out, since they seem to be on a mission to destroy Provi and a get a PanFam supported super-capital shitstorm set up here.
---
You'd be the expert on botting chinks
---
Full loot plus insurance would create even worse killboard padding
---
Ah ok gotcha thank you.
---
Yo, I know a lot of people don't end up reading the minutes, because it's nearly 30,000 words long - So I've taken up the task of reading it all out in a way that'll allow you to put it on in the background whilst you work.
---
Hope you all enjoy :)
---
Dunk wants to build his castle too, but he's using  mashed potatoes instead of sand.
---
Why youtube?        
---
No one is using it.
---
Don't CCP search Google and github and block the things they find though?
---
I'm not a programmer so I'm clearly missing a lot of knowledge there.
---
I just memed about you guys getting farmed. 
---
What I didn't expect was a torrent of sperg about Panfam, Test, and supercaps.
---
Good job.
---
Soo just run 4 bots 6 hours each and you are undetectable? See it isnt soo easy to solve.
---
Yes imperator!
---
[Sure](https://tagn.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/whogetsbanned.jpg).
---
Pan-Intergalactic Business Community, primarily Chinese alliance, active for a year and a half, responsible for as many all-time botting bans as Kids With Guns Alliance, active for four years and Initiative Associates, active for ten years.
---
Fraternity. Treasury, primarily Chinese alliance, active for almost two years, responsible for just 1% fewer all-time botting bans than Northern Associates, active for almost ten years.

Still way more than EVE uses
---
it’s almost like a specific group of people were attacked
---
That's an anti-cheat method that will take maybe a week to defeat. There's a limited number of possible questions, a library that can be checked in a very short period of time. You'd have to devote dev resources to updating the questions regularly, which would detract from other developments. Finally, there's no guarantee that this won't result in an unacceptably high false-positive rate.
---
If you are part of a population that steals and murders at a significantly higher rate than the general population and you are upset about the fact that your population is being separated from the general population in order to improve the living experience of the majority, maybe your response should be to try and encourage other members of your population to steal and murder less. 
---
Is your argument that segregation is ok because it's just a video game or do you think we should ship minorities back to Africa too?  I don't think separate but equal worked out all that well for the states.
---
Shoot panfam for sure! Break the nip with goon caould be fun too imo.
---
It's a toughie cause the day of the changes we saw the same bots back in systems. So how many actual players can back vs how many brought their bots back online will be hard to navigate.
---
Tell that to the people saying that OC is racist.
---
It's almost as though you don't know what context is.
---
lol
---
this is the sort of shit that makes this game.
---
real money trade, selling/buying isk whit real money
---
You can attack the game at various levels.
---
1. Python scripts probably best way to get simple bots.
---
2. Memory injection takes more time and is about chewing raw data and geting some code in.
---
3. Hardest way would be making standalone program to take control over game client. Safest way, cause they can detect it only by behaviour analysis.
---
CCP is years behind other game companies at fighting bots/scripts. They even failed at .txt log files reporting ingame activity.
---
Ah, fair enough
---
A big part of the problem with this is that destruction of ships and modules is the main way in which raw materials are sinked out of the game.
---
Wormholers are generally more racist towards the chinese than anyone else therefore all wormholers are racist and should fuck off to their own racist server. If you disagree youre being a disingenuous racist hack
---
If there is no other effective solution then sure.
---
There are several ways your post is retarded, and I'm struggling to figure out which is most egregious.
---
The bot is a program running on your computer, using your keyboard and mouse to perform actions in game. They can't block specific programs because it all just looks like player actions on their side. Sometimes it looks like very precise actions, but that still doesn't mean it's a bot. And the better bots vary their actions so they don't look too much like bots.
---
Just emulating your reasoning there bud. Its cancer by design
---
&gt;at a rate that is statistically significantly higher
---
Tbf so do black people IRL but if you suggested the same thing (moving them all off your country) people would certainly assume certain things about your beliefs..
---
&gt;They went from server to server to purge the servers from any non Chinese.
---
Remember, kids, it's not racist if it disadvantages *certain groups*.
---
They weren't referring to the behaviour itself but rather for how long some players do it. Iirc this was about players farming for 14+ hours a day.
---
1st of all, these Sleipnir dudes will be faggy kiters for sure, so Dunk won't engage them but start whining
---
the dream would be real
---
Cheating at a video game is nothing to be proud of.
---
Sometimes when alliances get out of control. Real world money is the only way to rein them in. Hence Casino War perhaps?
---
Trigger Happy. Independent. 
---
Fuck me, those guys pay Snuffed Out to force out some shitty alliance in Tribute, that doesn't even play the game.
---
I think the term "European" probably applies to most of the US population.  Indeed probably all of the Americas (Brazil, Argentina, etc.).
---
And unfortunately a lot of Western developers let it go unchecked or even play into it rather than moderating against it, like they do with Euro- or Americentrism. There seems to be a perception that Sinocentrism is okay but Euro- and Americentrism isn't.
---
C6 Sites spawn 4 days after they are cleared in any C6 right?
---
Who doesn't just casually buy an alliance?
---
&gt;"Group X bots more than average" is not the same as saying "Group Y does not bot"
---
vs.
---
&gt;Wormholers are generally more racist towards the chinese than anyone else therefore all wormholers are racist
---
🎵One of these things is not like the other/one of these things just doesn't belong.🎵
---
“hey you’re different don’t use our things, go back to where you came from, we don’t want you people here.” idk if it sounds like a duck, walks like a duck, and looks like a duck, it’s probably a duck. just like this post is probably racist, incites prejudice, and shows how hypocritical people are. Guess what, there are plenty of home grown botters and they should all get banned, players who play the game shouldn’t be harassed because you think ALL of X group is an X. botter or not simply looks like another killmark to go after in my eyes.
---
hey I liked mashed potatoes, especially when there is gravy on it
---
Thankfully, EVE is a video game and thus is devoid of those concerns.
---
You've spent a while being awfully pedantic throughout the thread. I think I've done a good job of summarising it.
---
No, you said something entirely different and tried to play it off as the same thing.
---
Yes, yes, I'm sure that happened to you, once. There's a bogey man cloaked on every wormhole, I guess.
---
yeah, but if i only have to do 3 inputs per hour then you can pull a 14 hour session as there's minimal chance of burning out.
---
i don't need to take breaks if i have 20 mins between inputs being required, i have plenty of time to make food, take a piss, whatever.
---
Ok, racist wormholer
---
How to crash the economy with one simple change.
---
Glad to know you concede my point.
---
They got scammed so hard.
---
I get what you're arguing for but you can find tons of stats on hacking by Chinese players. 
---
Another game I play, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, has a stupid amount of hackers who are mostly Chinese. To the point where they advertise their streams and sites in their names to sell more hacks because they can get back into the game instantly after a ban and continue hacking. 
---
And just to give an example, this is one of the more popular Reddit posts on the topic which explains some of the reasons why it's so popular and normalized: https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/azwj51/as_a_chinese_player_i_feel_obliged_to_explain_why/
---
Why the fuck is CCP allowing this to happen? This is the most blatant RMT I've ever publicly seen in this game.
---
Yeah it was that last one which I was talking about. If you were referring to the stats, then you missed a word. If you weren't, the apostrophe is wrong.
---
Yeah cool.
---
How did you do the italics?
---
No matter, you can put it on whatever. I have Align on A and double click for targeting. Point is you can already do a lot of these things in the game.
---
True, completely forgot about the talks between Vince and frat, goldfish memory.
---
The Russians who just took over 03 in Detorid will never bot.  Also , Test and Goon have no botters ( I checked).
---
Did you include that important identifier in your opening post?
---
Self afflicted poverty, they have more tools, space and backing than 95% of null alliances.
---
Except it's a fact that in Chinese gaming culture its accepted to "win by any means necessary" which includes botting. So while yes people from all groups bot, the Chinese do so at a significantly higher rate.
---
From a certain point of view, it's both. What most people picture/consider as the Chinese of China are more specifically the Han.
---
Yeah.  People cheered when they did this.  u/maldoror told us how great the Chinese were and null was dying for content.
---
I'd like a new instance with all the broken shit fixed. It's not going to happen though (maybe the new instance not the fixed broken shit).
---
Soon you'll find yourself doing stupid shit like this.  [https://br.inyour.space/?s=3705&amp;b=8714478&amp;e=111&amp;t=vvr](https://br.inyour.space/?s=3705&amp;b=8714478&amp;e=111&amp;t=vvr)

What do you mean "no one is using it"?

Yeah, Western EVE is totally legit.
---
CCP plans covered by CSM summit are so sad. Nothing to be hyped again.
---
Right so, what would they rather do: buy 5t of Plex from ccp or offer RR dies half of the sum that would've cost in real currency?
---
How would ccp ever prove the later? Not at all. If this wasn't the cheapest option for them they wouldn't have done it that way
---
If they don’t play the game, why are they in sov null? That’s a waste of space
---
Honestly all the chinks should be slaughtered. The yellow peril contributes nothing to mankind and exists solely as a plague.
---
We dont want these newbros taking bad fights... we are going to let them krab up to 60m sp and then may consider undocking.

If he was botting he would probs have more than 23,000 isk
---
I'm out of the loop with whatever is going on with Serenity, can somebody please fill me in?
---
TBH if the sleips have logi the likley outcome is 20 dead thoraxes and no dead sleips.
---
IMO nanos and overdrive injectors should be removed from lows and moved to a midslot module, so tank is sacrificed for mobility and not DPS.

After years away I come back to Eve. I try to go roam in my favorite PVP Jaguar, only to find out its a missile boat now. What confuckery is this?
---
Can people link some good solo pvp ship fits that are current with the current meta?
---
The main Serbian leader tried to take a "hands off" approach to botting and other stuff and ccp ended up banning him.
---
Since local has been back i've seen a lot more people on comms and doing things in game, permanent local isn't the best solution however it is better than black out
---
Besides the fact, that this statement is super sad by Dunk, it doesn't change the fact, the being logi is a profession that many players love and excel at, so taking that away would simply just suck for a lot of pilots (combat refitting triage anyone? :( :( :( )
---
And only because you take logi away doesn't mean that eve players not also change what they take out in a fleet.
---
Nano armor, I’m into it.
---
Bots are back in town
---
They were not 100% kicked out of their hole and were back in Rage (their hole) within days so...sssshhhhh
---
Are they arty or auto sleips? Are they blaster or rail thorax?
---
&gt; No regrets on winning EVE, at least for now.
---
Holy fuck, I am with you on that. I don't give a fuck about the post itself, but the comment section is a fucking cesspit.
---
I'll bm this post to link the comment section in the next "r/eve community = best gaming community ever" thread...
---
So... shield ships are the same speed as armor?  You do get the balance is shield has speed and dps, armor has hp, cap-passive resists and lower sig.  If people aren't using armor it's just because ~95% of null pvp involves running away from a defense fleet.  As for reducing the hp of shield ships... why?  I haven't ever heard anyone complain about the tank of a nanofleet...
---
What is it with r/eve and false equivalencies this morning?
---
Simply incorrect. It's kind of funny people think the detection is based on what that post talks about - it's not. There are ways to avoid detection, and at some point it may turn into cat and mouse, but if CCP really wanted to tighten the screws and maybe accept losing some legit players, even serious avoidance can be dealt with to some extent.
---
However, we recently heard about bots warping pods back and forth for hours at a time, so CCP isn't even picking the low hanging fruit in terms of automated detection yet.
---
what? why? how are you going to find the nodes to reinforce WH SOV?
---
Go for it, since armor is inherently slower with plates/trimarks if you want buffer. Thin buffers combined with delayed reps will make nano armor a lot more fragile than current shield nano.
---
OTOH, Armor HACs will be able to maintain their tank while sacrificing some tracking computers for extra speed to sig tank with.
---
They want it to seem impossible so their bots are safe.
---
7-8h is pretty common.
---
People used to farm 18h a day, sleep and eat in downtime.
---
PA didnt do this. They forcibly brought their own server to the point of stasis by outbotting everyone else.  When there was nobody left to blue, they moved to TQ to start over.
---
"X group is responsible for a disproportionate amount of botting" =/= "Y group does not bot"
---
They don't. There are several very good open source bots that read memory for actions. There are also several paid OCR bots that read the screen instead. Their are mining bots, ratting bots, abyssal bots, mission bots, hauling bots. The open source solution I mentioned above pretty much allows you to create any bot you want. 
---
I found all this out with 15 min of Googling.
---
&gt;but to distinguish them scientifically is incredibly hard.
---
Sure, mate. When your bot runs 24/7 for 8 months, it's very hard to tell if it's a bot.
---
There is at least the drone lands which are not yet part of the blue donut
---
A-Fucking-Men. Hookers and blow is a far better investment.
---
You think the problem is bots that run for hours?
---
&gt;characterized by extreme patriotism, especially in the form of aggressive or warlike foreign policy.
---
Your use doesn't match that. Jingoism is about showing you're better at everything at their home by force.
---
How about you pull an effective 8 months session?
---
if you want to know what i think - read my post.
---
Yeah when I think China I think Han or temporary organ containers.
---
Uhhhh, Serenity shut down awhile ago....annnnd that's about it.
---
that doesn't even make sense.
---
WC would either pick goons or 3rd party. Tapi is on the top of the shit list as far as I can see.
---
It’s really hard to get a read on panfan, in the current day, old panfan would have definitely finagled a way to get goons to work with them to shoot tapi. Honestly the biggest issue is all entities that matter already hold all the space they need/want. Time to start deleting systems and regions tbh.
---
They seem to be a collection of people who have no clue what they're doing, and then recruit newbros and don't train them to survive. Then said newbros gets constantly murdered by other players and then ragequit.
---
Just my personal experience.
---
It would be very effective, and if you start to look into where known bots connect from, you may actually consider doing something about vpns. But they are not serious yet.
---
&gt;bots tend to play the game continuously for hours on end
---
Months.
---
&gt;while the botters will just rework their bots to only play for short periods each day and just run more bots at a time
---
Check where they connect from. Check average account baseline of "known" human players (I know they already have this info).
---
Does it matter? Read my fucking post.
---
&gt; It must come from their general culture, that's how things work. 
---
Their GAMING culture is bad, because their CULTURE is bad.
---
Chinese culture in general endorses cheating. You've very clearly never taught in China.
---
Yes my mommy didn't cook me Tendies enough and abandoned me.
---
Lemmie know where you plan to be roaming in this thing...
---
one of those "if you can't beat them, Join  them" acts it seems.
---
I'm sure you have the data what % of Chinese players are/were botting to back it up.
---
100 bots banned from 1 "player" or or 100 bots banned from 100 "players" make the same average, but vastly different % of users.
---
Instead of 4T, could we trade bbc for a cntz fc?
---
At this point I'm not even reading any replies.  You're pretty upset over a picture of a pepe and some upvotes.  This place really is a salt mine.
---
Baller.
---
It didn't say democratically elected, so it checks out.
---
Yes and why shouldnt they? It would be extremely short sighted if goons would only go for their own interests, because after all the shit also goons wanna have fun in a game a fight other in eve. Who shall we stomp on if noones left?
---
Its nice to see when all of the toxic people gladly stand up on a soapbox and proclaim in public, for all to see, just how toxic they are.
---
No, employees never get money from corporate takeovers.
---
Nothing different here.
---
grrrrr Chinese
---
grrrrr Russians
---
In reality however, 90% of "Russian bots" are just krabs who don't like speaking English so they don't engage in PvP that much, and 90% of "Chinese RMTers" are just rich IRL so they don't mind spending thousands of $$$ on Plex (legally).
---
In my experience, it's Americans that are cancer in this game. Nearly 100% of them refuse to speak any language other than English and are toxic as hell generally. I mean look at the official EVE events and where they are hosted, look at major alliances and who leads them (spoiler: it's Americans in, like, 70-80% cases). Yankees basically hold the entire game hostage and yet they still act like they are the ones being oppressed. It's pathetic honestly.
---
Except nobody wants a rotting corpse
---
Are you seriously trying to take the moral high ground by comparing region blocking a culture in a video game to forcibly relocating actual humans in real life?
---
Calm the fuck down.
---
That's because Geminate is renter space, and west Geminate is useless for krabbing. So obviously its pretty easy to take. Even during the Test invasion back when Horde was active in gem, we gave up the western bits pretty quickly, just because they were too hard to defend and no one used them in the first place
---
what really gets me is when people try to control others actions.  that's what makes me snap.
---
Also made a chart yesterday: https://i.imgur.com/G0PxNLO.png
---
The interesting thing: there is a small mid-summer "pit", which apparently happens every year (the prediction curves you can see are scaled averages of 2012-2018 with 2016 omitted because reasons; curve 2 likely more accurate). 
---
The blackout started roughly in the deepest point of this pit. Hilmar declared it an absolute win roughly in the end of July, when the curve was going upwards - *because it was recovering after a yearly dive*.
---
Which leads us to these conclusions: 
---
a) CCP could not predict something that a bored spreadsheet-wielding dude could
---
OR
---
b) they knew and deliberately started the blackout in yearly minimum to spin the following **natural and predictable** growth as the blackout being successful. They just did not expect it to reverse and dive a fucking 5k.
---
You buy gold?
---
*BRBRBRB JAJJAJA!*
---
Start from the beginning, ban the obvious bots:  
---
\-humans cannot react consistently in less that one second.
---
\-humans cannot repeat 100 times the same actions with the exact same timings (at 1/10 of a second).
---
I believe you can get rid of 95% of the current bots with that already.
---
Maybe Mittens might let them have the parts of Querious that's outside of 1DQ umbrella range since QFC fell apart.
---
He loses both
---
&gt;What is AOM ?
---
Its me :D
---
if you think they're such a problem, maybe you should do something about it.
---
I think he was being modest.
---
healty
---
lmao who put the thread in contest mode?
---
I am mad because my team is not winning the video game right now. I am the OP.
---
Where are they connecting from? VPNs? Whats the average common number of accounts per human? CCP knows this.
---
A Brave FC has to ask someone else before he engages?
---
I believe we're talking about things in political and strategic context TODAY.
---
And you're talking about 2 and half year old gotg tactical content deployement. If we fast forward a few months, you also deployed next to Geminate to cuck our sig deployement against GoTG, remember? Even Stevens I'd call it. Stop playing victim.
---
The difference is "we" understand how damaging it is and there is more value in keeping the game healthy.
---
Dont let the space door hit you in the ass on the way out.
---
sadly not we're a league of legends club now
---
And out of context.
---
People farming raise inflation. People quitting decrease it. All in order.
---
I don’t think it’s about a side winning and losing.. the game is just in a bad place
---
But you're putting that under "caps", which is nonsense. The reason for all of that is just because the Blue Donut has **tens of thousands of players**. It doesn't matter what ships are required for a task, there are countless people that can fly them. Caps have nothing to do with that.
---
If you make caps suck at subcap warfare but introduced a new subcap ship that was awesome at it, everyone would be flying one in a few weeks. The resources (and players) are the reason it's possible.
---
Yes, Caps are generally better at most things than most subcaps, but not all...they're slow, they take forever to lock, they take forever to warp, they're easily caught if not careful, they can't handle specific types of engagements (that are easy to exploit), and they don't have a lot of "utility" skills (aside from FAX).
---
Are there too many caps? Sure. Is that the main problem? No.
---
I don't want their botting culture to become the new normal, thats it. Nothing racist about it. Should I embrace chinese botter culture in a game I loved? No, fuck off where you came from.
---
Get fucked.
---
my gaem no healty sir
---
Sure it does. Bots do it regularly and are not caught, although CCP is catching some of them lately.
---
&gt;They don't
---
Why not? Seems like it'd be the first step in them fighting this kind of thing.
---
&gt;I found all this out with 15 min of Googling.
---
What did you search for because whe  I've searched for "eve online bot" in the past all I've found is people complaining about them and sites that seem like a good way to experience credit card fraud.
---
ah yes, welcome to the real game
---
This guy gets it.

Show me any EVE-Alliance thats run non-totalitarian...
---
Yeah right ....
---
So you tell me if i take this ship no one will bother me anymore \*Carebear Starts :3\*
---
Go for B or C squad hookers so you can spend more on blow.
---
Is that so bad? If people want to effectively pay a fee to have a list on a third party website look more green, just let them. 
---
If loot was increased from 50% (do I have that right?) to 75%, there would still be a chance that the loot dropped could total to some pitiful portion of the total value of the destroyed ship.
---
I guess I don't really have an argument *for* it, but I can't think of any good ones *against* it.
---
I'd just like to point out how funny it is that nobody cares about the noraus logs about botting and the ridiculous amount of titans FRT got in a couple of months but everyone's up in arms about "muh game" when AoM does something suspect.  
---
Totally not targeted concern-trolling.
---
Im so glad you agree the earths flat! Look at all these round earther scum lords downvoting you, uneducated fools.
---
Get fucked
---
Doesn't look like a titan. Can't be a goon.
---
See that’s what I’m talking about. Why is that necessary?
---
You must mean botters are coming to the game right?
---
Plex do nothing with currency. When you pay to another player for your PLEX, the ISK remains in his wallet, don't dissapear with your PLEX when you PLEX your account. If you buy directly to CCP, ISK doens't matter.
---
And if CCP wanted a "real economy"® they dind't activities which refund directly in ISK for them. In "real economy"® new currency comes from a debt or from a goberment's money printer.
---
Can you please list the 70-80% of alliances so we can all have a collective laugh
---
We've used Telegram since at least 2017 when I started going.
---
The future is you'll continue eating shit for the next few years and you'll keep concern-trolling about the "muh health of the game" on reddit, it's gonna be great.
---
On serenity you might have that title but on TQ its been taken for a while. Also welcome to TQ where the real Queen of the North is in the actual north. As in Canada. GL with that though.

Rise up like last time then. Oh wait, you don't have that dank RMT ISK to fund you anymore, nevermind.

The imperium's position is the result of that place, not the cause.
---
This would have been perfect from the start but going from how super ratting is now to that would of course make everyone mad.

HAHAHA IT SAID BEE DAE GOONS XD
---
Aww.

Do u actually believe the stuff u spew out? Asking for a friend.
---
The point is, if HTP came to blow up the provibloc keepstar, then Test would come to save it. Doesn't matter what the line members shoot in their off time, when it comes down to it Test would save provibloc
---
Lol!

if it isn't true then it shouldn't be difficult to post something that directly contradicts what i'm saying, should it?

I'm embarrassed for you.

Doesn't the Myrm have unnaturally high EM resists though?

What does the British Broadcasting Corporation have to do with Eve?
---
Leave brave my dude, it's what we all did. Blueing mangoes was the last straw for me
---
Eve is fine. People just don't understand the game is about empire building and macroeconomics. Getting people to log in for ops is a problem for people below my station in Eve. I am the querns.
---
I know in Spanish if you say “americano” it means north/south/central america, but saying “persona de estados unidos” means US american
---
Makes sense since the language is prevalent throughout the continents, but still cool. And someone would for sure know you meant the US when saying ‘murica lol
---
Oh, you get italics when you encapsulate text with the asterisk (\*).
---
Not flex people were just freaking out over someone spending what they considered “a lot” on games and hating on it when in reality if you do have a good career it’s not even remotely close to a lot of money
---
Who would even want an alliance that couldn't even beat GOTG and lives purely by seal clubbing small lowsec groups?
---
...Most sites do.  I think there's a scant few that spawn with five, but most are 3 lower tier and 1 upper tier, and are usually just dumpsterfires.
---
What, did they change it in the last two years to have more cans and bolster the drop rates?  Because I do remember a few years ago people pushing explo hard, and I came to the same conclusion that it's better money to cherrypick ABC instead of doing wormhole explo.
---
Or you know just bot. The blackout ending was a sure fire sign from ccp how they feel about bots. Don't piss anyone off and you are kosher.
---
1bn is $3 today rmt China site. So welping cheap fit titans is now a $100 experince which is not bad for a weekends play time.
---
There is one thing that keeps me here. Spoopy is about as far away from the rest of brave as i can get while still being inside. And that thing is the main motto of the alliance: stay classy. 
---
I deal with enough screeching and reeeeing and people calling each other retarded in the rest of my internet interactions. It's a nice change of pace being in brave and not dealing with that.
---
Mittens and the rest of goons leaderahip whining  about black out was a confirmation of this.
---
I was Hulk first, ratting second.  So most of my early SP went towards industry.

28000 and change is the peak for the last 24hours, say people have on average 5 accounts, that's 5600 bums in seats.. that's fucking pathetic.
---
The evictions I remember typically had the aggressing fleet just remain in the target system maintaining hole control at all times. Seeding secundary (and tertiary) scanners is just a backup plan in case shit goes sideways.
---
Provi Bloc is kinda LEGACY align , not sure we can call them independant.
---
I fully appreciate how your ego allows you to simultaneously be a condescending cunt and also "im just line memeber durr"
---
I guess ~~people~~ PL liked Brave better when it was getting farmed by PL.
---
Anything is possible in Eve, but my question becomes whats next?
---
Pandafam have their own Donut though. From Cobalt Edge to Cache and stretching to eastern Geminate.
---
Day to day you don't really know which is why everything and everybody gets accused of being a bot at some point. You have to try and create exception cases and see what happens.
---
Pods warping back in after their ship explodes (though this may be pod scouting).
---
VNIs (in days of old) staying in the same anom for ages after you kill all their drones.
---
Too many commands in one go if you are watching something - mass cyno lighting or panic activation was something you saw sometimes, mass drone recall too.
---
Your main issue is you need to be watching the behaviour as it progresses. By the time everything is arriving in the POS / tether you've missed the difference between bot and 1/2 alert player. Even "everything arrives at the same time" is a poor yardstick since the anoms they were in were probably at difference distances from the POS.
---
Post hog
---
I hope youre paying attention CCP. This is literally how eve dies.
---
Its not just the same sort of situation that occurred on serenity. Its the same people doing it.

Hey, you're welcome to bring those faggy kitey shit to Horde content pockets and we'd keep sending waves and waves of actually brave blue eyed unvilyfied, PvP hungry newbeans in thier cormorants and slashers and whatnot  (no caps and srs bsns shit) at you without bitching about it at CSM.
---
The best vetted information can be found over on the Talking in Stations Discord.  Sourced news channel.
---
What are you, an NBA player?
---
Isn't that what I just said?
---
CCP does no real attempt at stopping any form of client injection or binary fuckery which gives bot developers the ability to do whatever the fuck they want.
---
If CCP ever stopped being lazy they could use their existing mechanics to nuke most bots. But they won’t because it’d affect their login numbers.
---
Oh sorry , I misread one word.
---
Are we conveniently forgetting the time TEST showed up to save the HTP (read: PHEW) Keepstar in Camal?
---
You also seem to be making a rather massive leap between them showing up to help maintain the status quo (which benefits them) and Provibloc somehow being part of their blue doughnut. It's nonsense.
---
Obviously Legacy doesn't want HTP (and their PanFam buddies) to get a proper foothold in Provi, as that would place a hostile super-capital group right in their back yard. So turning up to these batphone contest timers - where HTP+PanFam are going up against Provibloc - on Provibloc's side just makes sense.
---
half those alliances are feeders and vacation homes for panfam.
---
Thoraxes are practically free if you don't care about KB.

I think even Brave liked Brave better when it was ~~getting farmed~~ being hardened through battle by PL.

---
Well if it doesn't matter why did you delete your post? I don't get it, if it was a fine assessment of chinese culture, why throw away such precious analysis ?
---
Those two aren't related, though. I can project an absolutely officious attitude while simultaneously being at the bottom of my org. If you mistake my attitude for actual authority, you're a moron and need to have your reality forcibly honed back to true before you hurt yourself.
---
What happens when you DD someone...
---
as they warp away?
---
as they microjump?
---
as they get bridged/cyno away?
---
This seems like the kind of tactical knowledge you wouldn't want to post on the internet for everyone to see.

lmao this sounds stupid af
---
not my point
---
I think your definition of who's what-seccer is wrong but you do you.
---
&gt;How come CCP can't detect them?
---
They can detect a great deal, but for about 16 years, they appear to have put close to zero effort into it. The result is as you see - bots run for 8 months straight and not even flagged.

Pick up your eyeballs and look at their killboard. They’re actively trying to get a foothold in Vale
---
Why do you think they're not doing anything about it?
---
And problem is client recieves alot more data then a player sees like there was an exploit to detect local during blackout, that's just one of many such shit, more shit goes on at memory level.
---
What does permadeath character mean exactly?
---
Hey, I know PUBG has a fuck ton of Chinese hackers, and I despise them. But you are mixing two problems.
---
Let's assume this subreddit is right and a lot of Chinese players are botters. Then do we have a *botter problem* or a *Chinese problem*?
---
Any reasonable guess will point out that we have a *botter problem* --- Chinese players themselves are not problems, until they bot. Unless, you want to argue Chinese players are a problem *even when they aren't botters*; then I think it would be totally fair to call you a racist.
---
It's worth noting that if you substitute "Chinese" with any other groups that are not Russian, your comments will be pretty much unacceptable even if the circumstances are the same. It's especially easy to demonise an ethnic group when they are not well understood and their government is antagonistic to yours. Will you really argue CCP should ban Americans if a majority of bots come from the US? I think not.
---
You can argue that by banning Chinese players you can alleviate the botter problems effectively, but at what cost, and is this truly moral? FDR instituted the Japanese internment camps that might have stopped Japanese espionage, but it became one of the most glaring examples of human rights abuses by the US. It's the same here, only less effective: many Chinese players are already using VPNs to access EVE, and region locking them will do little.
---
Yeah this theoretical impossible to win scenario sounds like shit. Drop haw dreads send them home or maybe create something more fun by doing so ;)

Looks more like 23b to me tbh

This is pretty cringe

Just not a priority until recently. Same reason it took 15 years to realize wardecs were killing new players. They don't seem to care until shit hits the fan. Senior management appears generally uninformed or uninterested as long as revenue comes in.

" CCP Rise backs up a little bit and asks what their gut feeling would be about affecting engagements when disabling remote repair. Overall Innominate and Aryth would think that this would make more fights happen, they would be having a lot of fun and even knowing if they lose they would come out ISK positive. CCP Fozzie says that in the past they would see that people would find ways to mitigate fights not because they're afraid of losing but rather because they are afraid of feeding without getting kills. "  
---
" Dunk Dinkle raises a concern about being outgunned when defending and that this would remove one of their force multipliers. With this change, he believes that he would take fewer fights whereas ExookiZ and Aryth believe they will take more fights. Vily does point out that this may result in nano-crappery coming back. Aryth asks Dunk Dinkle if he would engage 20 Sleipnirs in 20 Thoraxes, he would come out ISK positive by just killing three of them. Dunk Dinkle doesn't want that, He wants the hostiles to get the hell out of his system. There seems to be a very unhealthy state enabled by the logistics to go into a fight and lose nothing and  destroy everything. "......

The post is funny and I am not arguing against it. But man, the comments... I wonder how many of them will dare to say those to their IRL friends?

But it wasn't a gate camp. We were out hunting waiting for your ceptors to grab tackle :D
---
It's pretty sad to see a person so devoid of an argument that he has to plug his ears and scream "You're stupid! You're stupid! You're stupid!" over and over.
---
Let's be fair its more like a squeal.
---
EVE is one of the few games where you can have a lot of fun with Counterintelligence.
---
Bear in mind RMT requires two parties; both a buyer and a seller.
---
You could theoretically look at the price per $ of illegal ISK to draw a correlation as to whether the demand for illegal ISK has increased (it is a safe assumption to say that the number of botters has increased over time).
---
If you find the price of illegal ISK has remained the same, or increased, then that *may* be an indication that RMT activity is on the rise (its a single variable though so it's difficult to pin down).
---
I think this is cool.  Thanks for sharing!
---
I think it's more memeing on an alliance that has shifted from one ideology completely to another. 2015 BRAVE was all about undocking, being in space, fighting, welping, regardless of whether they won or lost. The "This is Eve" trailer with BRAVE comms chatter shows the attitude of BRAVE of "fuck it let's just try" of the time https://youtu.be/uqoxRcP5kbo?t=50
---
The 2017+ BRAVE is indistinguishable from any other empire building alliance that tries to actively avoid PVP for PVE content whenever possible. It's essentially no different than FCON/SMA or an alliance with similar aspirations.
---
BRAVE is relevant and often used as an allegory to what has happened to the majority of Nullsec. There used to be a point in time when alliances undocked Caracals when a 20 man newbie alliance brought destroyers to their space instead of dropping supers on them or BOSONing them. And one of the most iconic, passionate, enthusiastic new player alliances becoming a cowardly, diffident, hanger-on to the status quo that actively admits they are stagnating but doesn't have the heart or the courage to attempt change is probably the saddest space opera story we have in New Eden.
---
Welcome to 2019 where we don't like it when people bring content to our house. We just want people to GTFO so we can grab in peace.

You will find most Low Sec PVPer will use cheap frigates with the idea that they will most likely loose their ship. If a ship that is 6 times as expensive shows up on D-Scan you can always bet they will warp off. In this case the hookbill decided to play his hand.

Then they must have toned down the rats a lot, since I tried ratting in Esoteria when I was temp deployed down there for a while, and the rats would nearly two-shot me and push me out of sites in hull with no real effort.
---
context?
---
&gt;one of the top comments here literally is just saying Chinese should be region blocked
---
And that wasn't racist. Context is key, my dude.
---
&gt;I should note that your words are not something you would dare to casually say in real life these days due to changing social trends.
---
Cool, IDC.
---
why not just save the site and carry some salvage drones or salvagers and refit at a nearby station?
---
Wow that link is very detailed and helpful. Thanks for the info!
---
There's nothing inherently wrong with feudalism as long as it's being run by a non-corrupt government. There's pros and cons in any system of government. Biggest problem with most of them is that they're being run by people and people suck.
---
Yep thats why its "nothing to see here citizen, move along"
---
70/80% by mass m8.
---
I was actually pretty impressed with the level of dedication and professionalism from the players I spoke with- both here and elsewhere. I was DoD for a while, and I found that many of the players had a better understanding of OPSEC and counterintel than those doing it professionally (even when there wasn't that overlap).
---
Pandafam isn't goon/test donut but i wouldn't really call them not a donut given they occupy a solid third or so of NS
---
Jesus dude you really do need to grow up. You sound like an immature child who can not handle even a mild criticism.
---
That’s what I said
---
Rmt confirmed
---
TIL, not wanting to evict someone means you are allied with them
---
Go to Branch/Deklein and the chance you are with a bot in system is like 50%, outer passage and omist seem to have just started again the bots.
---
Haven't looked in detail in the other regions, but give it another 2-3 month and then its worse then ever before i would say.
---
haha, I'll live :) 
---
You might enjoy this- it's the formerly classified history of OPSEC released by the agency: https://www.nsa.gov/Portals/70/documents/news-features/declassified-documents/cryptologic-histories/purple_dragon.pdf
---
Despite the redactions, it does a good job outlining both the history and the process itself.
---
Thank you!!!! Take this gold!
---
Also if you wanted to add bling as possible implants because gotta get that tiny % advantage and make our pod worth a lot on zKB
---
This whole smallgang blobbing in Plexes is really unhealthy imo. If everyone is solo, finding a decent fight is easy enough. If people suddenly group into smallgangs of random sizes, a) the solo players feels left out (i know just get a fleet, but sometimes solo can actually be fun imo) and b) 2 out of 3 gangs cant engage each other because differing sizes or ones a complete kitchen sink and the other expects them to come into a plex that half the fleet cant even access.   
---
If you are looking for them good fights, then forget everything I said before. That shit is superfun, 10 on 10 t1 dessies in a small or something. But this whole blob the solo guy is just lame, in my opinion.
---
Lol that is a lot of fucking bullshit right there based on an Indybro/Logibro answering a random fleet engagement question. 
---
We actually have a policy against ruining fights with caps. We only drop yolocaps in Catch if there's no FC to form normal ships otherwise we let the FC fight in T1 cruisers or dessies or whatever. 
---
We have crabbing space in Impass. That's the whole fucking story lol. How hard is that to get and oh my god how hard is it to get over?
---
I'm saying it's a shit argument.  It's on CCP to design and implement anti cheat systems that work, not for them to just blanket ban a subset of humanity and hope for the best.
---
lol Sounds about right
---
If bots primarily abuse VPNs they need to be banned.
---
Eve wouldnt seem to have enough players for there to regularly be 100+ accounts connecting from one IP.
---
Couldn't you cripple those alliances by just having cloaked afk alts in those systems?
---
good point, thanks.
---
Lol test pilot says he’s good at pvp, he must be high as fuck
---
Yeah it's important to realise this isn't Brave being singled out (though Dunk's log is still pathetic), it's "holy shit what has the game come to, _even Brave_ don't want to PVP anymore"
---
The Dinkle seemed to be the most self-serving of them all.
---
I did that myrm ratting in 2012, so no idea when your deployment was. :)
---
probable that most of those accounts are mothballed cyno accounts?
---
Thanks! I was pretty terrible at the game itself, but the security programs I got to see were impressive.
---
&gt;  but saying “persona de estados unidos” means US american
---
No, man. It's Gringo.
---
A little bit....
---
While botting was going on, they also formed the big blue donut.
---
Eerily similar to what's happening today, atleast Imperium donut doesn't actively encourage botting, just ask their members to look the other way.
---
can confirm, am American, most Americans are revolting
---
https://youtu.be/MsqWnYE1pdQ?t=734
---
Sure, but that would be a massive investment of characters and time. Also there is plenty of empty space which is available to rent, so on long term they would just move to the next area.
---
Most likely ( nobody really knows ). 
---
Historically no entity has had control of all of c6 space to really test it, but it seems a likely theory. 
---
The biggest issue is that C6's don't scale so more toons doesn't mean more money, there is a fix income coming out of your c6 and that's it all of the C6 space still has a fixed income per hole, something nullsec doesn't have.
---
Chinese region locking has way more to do with server latency and local law than it does for botting concerns.
---
Test let Frat farm isk for 6 months before going to war with them in March/April, then act surprised that they have 300 new titans. Compared to AOM which was entirely new players to the server 6 months ago and yet now have a super fleet
---
Sure. Now lets get a baseline.
---
How much will sappo sell test for? Does it come with vily, Pgl and dran?
---
How much will mittens sell goons for? Does is come with init/tnt/bastion?
---
Sounds like an old school Wormhole Nomad who didn't do their research. lol
---
You guys take this serious from someone called Susi :)
---
You look like a world leader who got drunk after the summit and face planted down a set of stairs to hit the frozen cake with candles in it.
---
There used to be a time when your alliance had time to farm and still go out on roams. Brave's problem is one they have developed unto theirselves. They have turned GE-8JV into a fight club where 20 fleets a day go to fight them. 
---
The plus side is they dont have to go far for content. The negative side is those 20 fleets when they dont get content from Brave come to reddit and other places to reee about how they cant get fights and Brave wont undock. 
---
Maybe it's time for those groups having their daily visits to calm it down a bit so Brave can have some breathing room then come back in a month in order to have fights again. 
---
It's up to the content creators to manage their farms properly. The farmers have to cultivate the land, animals, and crops correctly to get the best yield for their activity.
---
is that a fat joke?
---
Our Chinese friends were never supposed to play on TQ since the Chinese love freedom so much they want everybody else’s too!
---
Should i waste braincells on an origin flair or just sip my tea and go on with my day.
---
I'll go with option 2.
---
Watching the npc kill graphs on dotlan also helps. It smells fishy if the stat stays completely stable for more than 2/3 of a day, killing the same amount of NPCS for hours. 
---
Sometimes you have spikes in there when a human player actually starts to rat in same system, but the fallback to the bot level is easy to recognize, like in this pic: https://imgur.com/MYp5KK6
---
i own a titan, but i still pvp in battl herons, incursus, and 20-30mil frigs, worms, garmurs, succubus', dramiels are still a bit scary for many
---
That's one of my favorite parts too.  I spent most of my time in a bigger newbro group helping out with this type of thing and we had a lot of it to do, so it was something I enjoyed.
---
"We have a policy" doesn't mean it never ever happens if people feel their fight was ruined by yolocaps they can complain to leadership.
---
&gt; IRL friends
---
Something tells me eve players that cry about Chinese people probably don’t have very many of those
---
Tell me your J number and I'll show you.
---
well honestly... some bad blood and betrayals would help the game curing ;)
---
Today, too many alliances are caring alot about their word. i'd say that is one reason for the stagnation
---
Yes all the “players” have come back. Hooray the game is fixed.
---
But but but would you rather be murican or canadian?
---
Don’t waste your time looking for any real answers here.
---
Ask someone in game as this sub-r is generally not too helpful
---
So... you had a pirate frig and killed a faction frig!?
---
Congratz on your first solo kill, now try killing a T2 frig in a T1 frig!
---
Wait, are you implying CCP has the power to bring back the dead?
---
I want BOB back
---
See, the bots are coming back.
---
fit an incursus for the price of a worm like this and well see who wins :D
---
This is how it looked like in a typical morning traffic in front of wormhole N766. Damn traffic control, always making the life hard.. Finally, we just couldn't take it anymore.
---
Ive flown the sentinel just to be left alone. No frigate is going to fuck with that ship.
---
Pretty cool.
---
I do feel like it's often overstated in EVE especially the counter-intel side of things in a "well this one time..." kinda way. I think where the EVE community really excels in regards to opsec is just the boring day to day understanding of "need to know basis" at all levels.
---
Personally my favourite counter intel situation ever was sitting on comms giving a small group of dudes a mini fireside update of where we're at, then hearing from someone else that their spy was sitting in the channel relaying what I was saying to a similarly sized fireside over in the enemy's comms. Just kept talking like nothing was happening, but dropped a bunch of false flags about what we were planning, waited about an hour until the channel had cleared out, and caught the guy still relaying by process of elimination.
---
Good pick, you dont exactly have an excess of brain cells to go around.
---
Enjoy your tea, sweaty
---
&gt; I wonder how many of them will dare to say those to their IRL friends?
---
I hope not many, but after some of these comments... I am not quite as confident as I would have been before.
---
rep fit and buffer fits often end up having the same ehp..... maybe a rep fit can go a TINY bit further if it gets some reps off after charges (shield or armour ancil) but generally the fights the same amount of tank on each.
---
&gt;pretending bots ever left
---
lol.
---
Thats just the way we as players treat it - but there are lots of tools in-game that can make corporations in Eve act like corporations. Whether users make use of those tools? Well no, of course not. Who the fuck wants to roleplay being an employee
---
No point fighting it just quit like the rest of us let the botters and the blue donut have its farms and fields
---
🤔
---
PANN are good dudes.  We also live in Nenn and they are fun guys to fight against and occasionally fight with.
---
one day youll start flying the jaguar and realise you can take on t1 destoyers +1 t1 frigate at the same time and win. trust me, firgates get insane amounts of fun fights in FW space...
---
Nice video with beautiful shots ! Good job !
---
The thing is you do that, and you also send fake messages as well, where the "click the UI" button is hidden.  There's a lot you can do to this space.
---
I do understand what you're saying though, and it's a cost-benefit ratio.  Just saying it's something they could do, and even basic protections will help out a lot.
---
You also rotate the question pool every few weeks.  The questions are just a basic style of capcha.  Send the question as an image, and have the image say "Press the green button!"
---
Leave wormholes alone. Wormholes have been blessed by CCP never fucking with them.
---
What the fuck is this image? 
---
* It has no solar system. This could be in fucking Venal for all we know.
---
* It has no date. This could be from 2011.
---
* The number of NPCs being killed are extremely low. We have a system in Delve with [close to an order of magnitude more NPCs being killed.](https://i.imgur.com/GLQpEVa.png) (Granted, I didn't put a date on this either, but it's what I pulled as of the time of this post.)
---
So can you clarify for everyone that Catch is not infact, for good fights. It's for pre-arranged fights. Thanks.
---
I got about a third of the way through reading the minutes before I wanted to kill myself, so maybe I'm not exactly the target audience here but - how many people really want to listen for 3 hours?
---
When I clicked through I thought this would have been a usual 10-20 minute summary analysis which would have been really neat, vs straight reading the minutes. Still holding out hope for a good summary analysis video.
---
when im solo in FW space. and a 10man frigate gang comes in, i get my battleship out and go crash into them.
---
back in the day when you could roam from jita into nullsec, run into a 6man gatecamp of frigs to cruisers. that was the fight you literally went for. trust me battleship 1v1's are boring as fuck. but the battleship comes into its own in FW space for things like this.
---
its fine if you dont mind whelping a few domis/hypes/ravens/rokhs/tempests.... i mean most the time you can fit them so with insurance you only loose 100mil? hell assault frigates are about 100mil each fit.... youll have some insane moments trust me, 2/10 go amazing, 2/10 go ok ish. the other 6/10 go dreadful
---
Hey I remember helping with this when you originally posted here, glad to see how it turned out!
---
isn't the status quo the point of the donut
---
so maintaining it means you're part of it
---
I'm sorry this offends you, but you're part of the donut. if you were a relevant entity you'd have been removed
---
&gt; What the fuck is this image?
---
attention seeking.
---
Nisuwa has some good solo pvp
---
But that would make then dirty crabs.
---
i’m sorry bud, the migrations happening, we already have botters, huntem, prepare for the new wave
---
That's awesome- great application of canary traps and strategic misdirection! 
---
I think Eve is probably better at OPSEC than most gaming communities. Maybe because there's actually something tangible to lose! Oh, my poor poor little ship, lol.
---
I remember you specifically- thanks for all your help! I feel like the live presentation was better than the text, but I wasn't able to record it :/
---
No but there's a difference between dropping yolo caps on a fleet engagement and dropping caps in standing fleet. As I said when we have an FC forming a response whether it was arranged or not you're obviously not allowed to ruin their fun by dropping caps on the enemy fleet. We're literally doing what's best for us which also happens to be the best for good fights.
---
Which clearly isn't the case in your video as I explained. 
---
We have people who want to fight in subcaps. We have people who have haw caps and want to use them. We make the best of it. Once again sorry if that's so hard to get over.
---
consider the fact you used the lowest DPS drone (warrior) against a shield buffer so into his HIGHEST resistance. and still won. thats how strong the worm is :)
---
love solo pvpers no matter what theyre in. so well played for becoming one of us
---
But then they'd be able to just kill anyone that calls them that.
---
Alts, friend. Explo alphas are powerful.
---
Can we just elect CSM with coding knowledge and then just have them work in the CCP building for a week in Iceland?
---
TBH more would actually get changed.
---
I'm tired of seeing meetings and nothing coming out of them.  A LOT of changes the playerbase wants is as simple as "change this variable" or "find the timer logic that runs the citadel code and change a few pieces of that".  Easily done in a weekend.
---
It sounds like they are running out of money to pay employees anyways.
---
It is in period basis, it is in fact 2 Ishtar bots making a baseline of 180 NPC-Kills per hour. The spikes are "human".
---
Botters love systems where they are mostly alone, so the heavy farmed sytems in Delve with 10k+ kills are not the ones to look for.
---
The date is 30 mins ago on dotlan.
---
Considering that this bot runs 16-18 hrs per day as of dotlan stats, the setup is making 1.6 Billion ISK per day (conservatively calculated), and (what is f.e. the reason Fade/Deklein/Tenal systems nobody lives in all have an Ishtar/Myrm-Bot of GWU running) it keeps the ADM high.
---
\*Jizz in My Pants starts playing in the background\*
---
link killmail please
---
Hard to know since CCP keeps that OPSEC now.
---
There’s much more I could say in support of this take, but the dilemma Lowjack identifies is exactly what Horde ran into in Geminate. If leadership’s idea of managing the space is for it to be a 24/7 thunderdome then you’re collectively and individually never going to develop the logistical underpinning that Eve unlike many other games requires for success. No one can sustain that tempo of operations — which is why Horde moved again.
---
And of those 20 fleet rolling through, only one or two (the ones run by Bjorn) are actually looking for a fun fight where both sides can come out saying, ‘Wow, I really enjoyed that.” The rest are looking for ganks or feeds and the problem is everyone involved knows that. Too bad for leet PVPers that the sheep after a while don’t go willingly to the slaughter.
---
I disagree with that. BRAVE has Impass as their designated farming area, based on the MER they are among one the top 10 richest alliances in the game based on income per GPP (prior to blackout). The average line members income has increased by about 3x since 2015 thanks to globalization of the VNI, now Myrmidon meta and citadel expansion which massively boosted capital PVE. 
---
They don't need breathing room in Catch because they farm primarily in Impass. And it's not like BRAVE doesn't have both the opportunity to make significantly more ISK through the changes to capital PVE but also has access to one of the most easily defensible regions in the game thanks to it's density and chokepoints. 
---
https://i.imgur.com/anjpoPw.png
---
You literally only need to control 2 systems (H-6 and 9I-) to be able to stop all traffic into Impass from subcapitals. Not to mention these 2 systems are right next door to eachother. And based on the density of Impass from central Impass you can jump caps to every single system in Impass. https://i.imgur.com/NSjWSTV.png It's half the size of Delve geographically speaking if you ignore the northern pipe in. On top of that, Impass is literally a pipe in, connected to a central constellation that then has single chokepoint exits into all of it's pocket. It's so damn easy to camp in anyone who roams to Impass because if you control the centre you can restrict all movement in/out. 
---
The nearest NPC stations require you to go 18+ jumps from central Impass. 
---
IMO the problem BRAVE has it one of identity. They are no longer content first but farming first. The issue BRAVE has is their memberbase farm, get caps and all the wealth they could need, but then BRAVE is reletively passive and doesn't actually have anyone really doing anything offensive, and when you have billions of ISK, endlessly flying cormorants or caracals in pre-arranged fights with goons in catch loses it's appeal. On top of that their position in Impass has them surronded by blues. They have to literally go 20 jumps to Querious or to Curse to find the nearest non blue entity. So they have a history of bleeding members to TEST who actively engages in campaigns rather than only being that of a defender.
---
well like all of your posts, literally no content, just sperging your negative to the world
---
Machariel.
---
Real shame, would have liked to see it but oh well ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Why fit an Incursus, go straight for a T3D Hecate it will be cheaper than a Worm too tbh.
---
And it will deal more damage... way more.
---
Their infrastructure is blue to one of two halves of the server.
---
but wont be allowed into a novice,
---
all in all t1 battleships cost us the price of a worm after insurance. not sure why more people dont just go whelp them xD
---
Any suggestions on where to ask in game?
---
I figured here people would likely have names not linked to their accounts so would talk more freely.
---
Truly the hero we need, but not the one we deserve.
---
it makes me sad to see books that dog-eared.
---
Welcome to EVE Endgame. Where you dont conquer space/enemy alliances by fighting with pixel spaceships but just outright buy them. And if you dont have enough ingame ISK you just use your credit card and buy more ISK. Next goal: chinese alliance CEOs buy Goons from Mittani, then he can finally buy his own yacht in southern france ;)
---
and yet, i still post more worthwhile content than you.
---
vOv.
---
I'm trying to go green; I'll likely recycle it sooner or later, lol

At least they did not log in during blackout after the 1st losses due to broken scripts. At least in Fade/Deklein/Tenal. Now they are back.

---
I come to /r/eve for only the most nuanced discussion of race
---
It's about as racist as saying all white people are white. Racist by definition, but still true.
---
Boring, no one cares.
---
well ... distorted perception. His posts are a large variety of "No U" spiced up with some"I know everything better" (without proof)
---
or maybe it's J101222 or J102111...can't remember
---
He's talking about Eve's lore? Or is it a fiction? How many pages ?
---
&gt; Well if it doesn't matter why did you delete your post?  
---
I didn't delete my post, you utter fucking retard. You're literally commenting on it. What the fuck is wrong with you?
---
well if i don't know everything better, you're welcome to post proof to the contrary.
---
seems every time i ask people to do that, they are suspiciously silent.
---
70 trillions for Goonswarm. Init, TNT and Bastion DLCs all for 40 trillions.
---
Yes. Region lock China. From everything.
---
players: this game is so stagnant ccp wtf change stuff
---
ccp: changes stuff
---
players: no dont
---
Don't be racist : every bee is yellow
---
I’m Dave.. I post shit and when u say anything contrary to what I say then I ask you to show me proof
---
That was .... beautyful ...
---
That is pretty indicative I agree. Might be some debate about what is natural variation and unnatural stamina but the basic idea is sound.  I guess you start with the obvious ones and refine the criteria if you run out of low-hanging fruit.
---
The worm will still win
---
I haven't looked at actual numbers, but just from memory I'd say most pilots are in a ship. And carrier rescues aren't super common, but not too infrequent to see caps either. It definitely gets interesting when you need to find a path out with very large holes all the way. Sometimes after we find the lost pilot it can take days for a viable exit chain to form.
---
75 chapters 657 pages.  All based loosely on the events of the Empyrean Age.
---
He may have checked the dudes kb saw no pvp kills and thought he might get an easy kill.  If he did he thought wrong.
---
you say that as if it's unreasonable for somebody to be able to provide evidence when putting forth an argument.
---
You can preselect systems to visit by that, then check them. There is still a chance that this line is actually done by a guy afk-ing 2 clients in his office, and 16 hours work is nothing special in China.
---
Can I set income from corp taxes from production NOT to master wallet division?
---
sry for bad English

---
&gt;  maybe I'm not exactly the target audience here but - how many people really want to listen for 3 hours?
---
I'll say that I just read the highlights but this would have been my choice of consumption had I known. I drive 45 minutes to and from work every day and consuming podcasts etc has become the norm for me since its an hour and half of my day where I don't accomplish anything anyways.
---
Oh hey, a summary of the eve community.
---
This, but with more autism and screeching.
---
Please tell me how Im a feeder for panfam?
---
&gt;  check the timings,
---
I used to bot. Random delays are sprinkled in everywhere to avoid this particular signature.
---
Edit: Just to be clear, each delay would delay for a random amount of time within some range, not that there were fixed delays randomly sprinkled in the program.
---
The fights in Catch arent pre-arranged unless FCs are arranging them and not telling their member base.
---
How bout this Dave.. take your
---
blue to them toon there and sit for a few hours and see there is ishtars perma running sites. Then try to interact with them and get back to us with ur findings
---
&gt; Legacy people are down in provi practically every day shooting provibloc dudes
---
Blue where it counts, red where it doesnt matter
---
waiting for your argument still ... except no u
---
Probably should use light missiles on that Worm. Not sure why you think projecting out to 10km is worth additional 30ish DPS.
---
Seriously, what changes can the entire EvE community agree on? Where's that list?   
---
I need to see the list of changes that literally everyone wants to see happen.
---
&gt;Intergalactic Space Hobos
---
I dont even know who you are
---
sure. let me head over to the system in the screenshot and... oh right, it doesn't have a system name in the screenshot...
---
yeah as if the entire chinese economy isn't based on stealing another company's idea
---
I kinda love the hilarity of someone lecturing Brave on good fights whose alliance's concept of Elite PVP is camping Signal Cartel
---
All u are doing is saying that he’s wrong with nothing to back up ur statement. How is what ur doing any different than him?
---
I'm new to EVE...what changes/bugs is this reffering to?
---
not me
---
It’s almost like some people want Eve to be Rifters Online, not respecting the idea that end-game players want end-game content. I don’t understand that mentality. Back in my World of Tanks days it was understood that someone of my experience level should be playing Tiers 9 and 10, and experienced guys who ran around in T-127s seal-clubbing noobs in Tier 3 matches were looked on as pond scum.
---
My argument can be seen some posts above answering the goon reddit fire brigade (aka querns).
---
And yes graphs like this are a 99% proof for botting, show me the "AFK-Ratter", that manages to keep a 16-hr-stable line at 180 kills per hour. Its only 99% as there seems to be no limit to the autism people farm the static rinse&amp;repeat PvE of EVE.
---
Brave 2015 was farmed to death.
---
Where are the Achuras of yesteryear?
---
you're going to have to be more specific.
---
which argument are you waiting for?
---
&gt; I've seen only 4 titans in game in the years I've been playing (5 if you count an NPC one). If you're truly a new player, you shouldn't concern yourself with things are years away from you, and have no impact on you. You can't form a balanced opinion.
---
As someone who owns 2 titans, this is bullshit, people can have valid opinions about them just fine regardless of whether they own them yes / no or a relatively new player. EVE isnt as complicated as some make it out to be
---
&gt; Personally I'm not close to a titan at all. However from what I've seen in game, they absolutely are strategic assets, and significantly rarer than this sub implies. You're not self funding multiple titans unless you've been playing for many years, or have a credit card you aren't afraid of using.
---
They arent rare
---
My bad I thought I was answering Dave not u lol I know there is a bot problem
---
That's provided both are near max dps.
---
Against active tank, every lost dps is worth more.
---
BoB is back, it's just called goonswarm now
---
Change would to should*
---
Try running through Provi in a non-nullified, non-instalign boat with anything but a Provibloc tag after you’ve killed something there and see how far that gets you.

Thats a pretty cool presentation. Reminds of the one I held a year ago, I hope you won't mind if I use yours for my possible next one as it seems much more refined. Great work.
---
P.S. EVE v DOD was a fun comparison that got a chuckle out of me. :P
---
Why are Amarr blowing up Caldari
---
hmm I mean since it’s prob going on in a third of period basis u can prob just pick any system with npc kills on dotlan

Give me half of these and I'll resub
---
Please do! No credit necessary, use it as you see fit. And thanks :) 
---
Lol, I got a few solid groans from the audience with that one.
---
I am pretty sure arguments of players, even the most autistic ones, went a bit beyond "change stuff"
---
It increases the cost of their operations therefore making it more difficult for them to be pathetic players.
---
I did visit Provi a couple months ago , nice place to a get a fight.  But I don't understand the point you want to make here. I never said it was a death region.
---
Go troll elsewhere, you obviously just here to stirr up shit make fun of others while not recognizing you are making yourself look "funny" ...
---
Yeah, except it's 20 ramjags and scythes every single time, much fun
---
if you get 2b in kills and only lost ships worth 400m you just need to reship. The attackers would leave because they'll deem it not worth it. One of the most fun fights I've been in we took 50% losses, disengaged, reshipped and took another 50% losses and reshipped again. after the second time we reshipped they left becauseeven if they'd killed more ships but they'd also accrued heavier financial losses.
---
Fights like these boosts morale. Cowering in a station, hoping the baddies will go away lowers morale.
---
Some of them are and then it'd usually say so in the ping. Pre arranged simply means the FCs talked to each other about a time and maybe numbers and shiptypes.
---
NRDS only lasts until you join a Spectre Fleet roam. Then you’re fucked in Provi for life.
---
let me go and see what i can see.
---
That’s actually the Minmatar.

It's a quote from the CSM minutes.

if you can be made fun of so easily, maybe you should consider posting some higher quality content?
---
Maybe it shouldn't  - at least it was *read*, which is what books are for.
---
If it's about people needing to treat books with a little more respect : well yes, that too.
---
i would have assumed you are smarter, the statistics show clearly there will nothing happen before 18:00 ET
---
edit: actually its more like 19 - 10 ET it seems even
---
What class are you moving to?
---
Remember the last time Provi was under actual threat of being evicted? TEST supers deployed to save the region.
---
Well I cannot post your desired p0rn from office.
---
I think it was
---
How’s that different now ?
---
Not what he’s saying. Yes, everyone talks. No, that doesn’t make them allies, any more than the US and Russia having a hotline makes them mates (ok, bad example currently, but roll it back a few decades).
---
And PAPS are PAPS.
---
Define "good".
---
They do seem to be resisting an eviction attempt from Holesale, which is moderately impressive for a corp I'd never heard of before.
---
Clearly, people who ask for a ready check as QOL change are just maniacs.

I have to go to the gym in like 30 mins, if i park my character there now i can take a look when i get back, or in the morning.

Yes, everyone was pro "change stuff" no matter how stupid or lazy, you really captured it.
---
a creased spine is a sign of a well read book.
---
but that poor book has just been abused :(
---
Uhhh I think you can get that data through ESI. I know you can for individual players.
---
I’m not so sure about that. I’ve seen some cracks between them over tactical matters. Let’s just say INIT and Goons don’t always have the same idea when it comes to who to fight.
---
Correct the context adds a lot more details. Dunk is saying he has no desire to take a fight he will guarantee lose because it will be isk positive. That is not a fun experience to him.
---
"sisi" was used to make this.
---
I'm guessing.
---
I'm looking at the official list of QFC members. 
---
They are getting fights up there, good for them. Doesn't make them independent of the QFC.
---
Which half? The half you agree with? What about everyone else?
---
Nullseccers wanting their umbrella back?
---
Doing more than changing a 0 to a 1 is a bit above CCP’s pay grade
---
Mittens and the bigreddumbass get WH facts wrong for 20 mins and act like idiots.
---
23 Trillion isk confirmed

You can't see standings of alliances you aren't in.

That was such a good book

Phew/htp are blue to pl
---
When I was in Brave, dudes have said time and time again that we had too much space than we knew what to do with. I recommend sticking to Impass because it’s less of a cancer trying to defend it than catch and you can see the ADM’s and notice that we didn’t do shit with the rest of the space. But GE holds a lot of sentimental value for Brave, especially the older dudes and leadership. Also your pretty on the nose with the last bit about why dudes leave for Test.
---
&gt;	You have another donut that is PH, NC, PL and WinterCo. They make about 20-25% of null. Their politics have been mostly about content and enough income to sustain content levels for past few years. Consequently and so inherently, they aren't as big as the other donut.
---
Also within that they’ve been hobbled by internal rivalries. Back in Horde’s Pure Blind/Fade days there was a lot of fighting going on with ostensible allies GOTG, enough to build up resentment among Horde line members about why we’re NIP to them and oh by the way what genius gave the smaller of the two groups the better space. So, fast-forwarding a year, I imagine the eventual turn against GOTG had a lot of popular support from the Horde line.
---
Try Provi.  No caps there.
---
"None of the groups I listed currently live in Querious. Did you just make up some random shit and call it an opinion?"

I was in spoopy for a long time too. Trust me when I say you're better off in another small corp. I miss the guys, I really do, but being blue to literally half of the Galaxy means you can't do shit if you like to PvP.
---
Edit : Rae and asilthar leaving really hurt spoopy, but the final straw for me personally was cags blueing mangoes even after we were specifically told they weren't going to be blues.

It was

In my case I’ve been doing Angel/Wh sites and on bad days I still make 50+mil and hour. No idea what this dude is saying about high sec mining being better than 0.0 explo or wh exploration.
---
I'm just going to play devils advocate.
---
I really think Legacy code is a bigger issue then we realize.  One of the reason they don;t fix stuff we want them to, is it will take too long and too much resources.  So they band-aid.
---
Its why i firmly believe CCP is working on an EVE 2.  Not a EVE sequal but a complete and total rewrite that will be released as a huge expansion, but it will basically be eve 2.0.
---
This rebuild and repair phase keeps feeling like they are hitting road blocks and can;t be ambitious because of it.

Yes. Thanks for linking it.

This is the most  widely used Chinese bot
---
From Tranquility to Serenity, all Chinese null corps have members use it to some degree, no matter they are from PLA, ENPL, WC, AOM or RR
---
Wherever are Chinese ratters and miners, there is this bot
---
This a million times over this.
---
"Fix force projecttion"
---
ccp: sure
---
"Wait no this sucks!"
---
 
---
Next
---
Fix sov!
---
"wait no..." 
---
wash rinse repeat
---
Well.  Turning off “only rat in capitals under supercapital umbrellas online” would definitely have an effect on humans in subcaps able to play the game again
---
Typo fixed: krab not grab
---
How about the fact that some ammos don't have unique icons? Or that grapples and webs have the same icon? 
---
How about that there's no functional way to sort abyssals in inventory?
---
Or that you can't make a combination courier-exhange contract? Or break a courier and then reassemble it.
---
There's tons of easy stuff they could do. The icons thing could be fixed by an intern in an afternoon.
---
honestly, no you probably won't. Fuck off
---
Interesting point - what would you say if I made a similar claim about American gaming culture? I.e. the overt racism and insane levels of misogyny? Or sometimes even Nazism? Remember the hullabaloo over Wolfenstein 2? Must be something cancerous about American culture?
---
Why you heff to be mad?
---
But no not alt just made it :)
---
Was told lots of salt to collect from F1 monkies on the subreddit :D
---
First rule of EVE. If you ever find yourself in a fair fight you fucked up.
---
You'll have more fun in a high sec Corp. Till CCP fixes null, HS/LS is a lot more fun.
---
so report them
---
Its always the same, if not pre-arranged, than at least a Goon-Fleet comes to V-3, waits politely at Zero at the GE Gate (signalling they won't kite so Dunk does not rage) and then wait until some Brave Junior forms something to fight them. Its meaningless, disposable and no fun, except maybe for the 1 real noob still in Brave that gets his 1st killmark on his Atron.
---
I’m saying my TEST tag would count for jack and shit if I rolled through Provi in anything engagable, mostly because I once flew a hunting Sabre in a Spectre Fleet roam the FC diverted there after not finding much content up north. It’s easy to get on their KOS list and most folks if they’ve ever activated their guns anywhere in New Eden should figure they’re on it and act accordingly.
---
The ones that won't hold still while he shoots them.
---
You'd find that most players would wholly accept those changes basically as is, over the current state of the game. That's why it was such a well received post. But instead of understanding that you made a stupid comment to try and imply the guy referencing it is only looking out for himself. Stop being an idiot.
---
None of those things apply in the same scale as it does to Chinese gaming culture, and thus, your claims would be invalid.
---
There is no such thing as "insane levels of misogyny" in western gaming culture. (inb4 gamergate, which wasn't about misogyny)
---
&gt;  Must be something cancerous about American culture? 
---
The only thing that's cancerous about American culture is the food that they eat. I'm not American, thank fuck.
---
&gt;Horde can't give it to you
---
Standing fleet begs to differ, although it does have rather a lot of chasing kitey bullshit.
---
It didn't leave?
---
Brave has been shit tier for about 2 years
---
Well they are amongst the Top 10 in income according to MER.
---
Curious, why do you firmly believe that? You seem to be giving them a fucking amazing amount of faith based on basically nothing.
---
&gt; unless FCs are arranging them and not telling their member base.
---
there ya go
---
I think he meant steer clear cause we'll probably kill him dead unlike the rest of the list.
---
And that's the simple stuff.  Add on top the complex stuff that CCP has sorted needs doing but isn't shiny enough to warrant the time - corp, alliance &amp; asset management, missions, sov/ security etc....
---
Have popped worms in a Merlin. Go Omega. Magic Merlin is the shit. Other races have awesome frigs too but I'm caldari for life.
---
Great book to read while you wait for a ping
---
No it wasn't.
---
It is!
---
People shit on you but you realized being "Goonish" and surviving is better than being old school TEST and getting farmed by PanFam. 
---
It sucks that the only way to currently thrive in EVE (sov null) is the Goon model.
---
No. That's not even close to how that played out mate.
---
PL had already taken Provi at the point TEST deployed. We were still fighting them, sure, but Provibloc had already re-staged to low-sec and PL had control of basically the entire region. TEST elected to not get involved, knowing that PL had no intentions of staying past the time it took to remove the faction fortizars, and were no threat to their assets.
---
TEST only deployed when it came time to grab the faction fortizars for themselves. PL ran for the hills the moment TEST showed up, and TEST were too busy toasting stations to have much thought to spare for Provibloc members reclaiming the sov. They didn't want it anyway, so they didn't much care. As long as we left each other alone to do our respective sov grinding, everybody was happy with the situation. (Well, almost everybody.)
---
For from our perspective, TEST's deployment really only sped up the process of us reclaiming the sov. PL would have buggered off eventually, and we would have retaken it, but this just gave us a really nice early window to get that done.
---
So can you clarify to shut the fuck up. If you don't like how someone else plays the game that is a YOU problem not a THEM problem. Or let me insert a MC meme circa 2007 "Sorry were not playing your version of EVE"
---
&gt;This was in TQ at our previous static. We dont really use Sisi, which you can obviously tell from the quality of our friday fleets
---
Okay fair enough. Went and read the video description. Thanks for correcting my assumption.
---
There's definitely some comparatively easy changes that have near-universal support (by my estimation):
---
- nerf Jags
---
- nerf kikis
---
- nerf rorqs
---
- buff Proteus
---
- buff med ACs
---
- buff BS in general
---
- remove attributes (HEY CCP, WANT TO IMPROVE THE NPE, THIS IS A GREAT START)
---
- nerf citadel timers
---
- impose limits to citadel spam
---
Solving bigger problems like nullsec botting, asset safety, cap proliferation, sov stagnation etc is more complicated but it would be nice if they demonstrated *some* desire to fix it.
---
Lol neat. Makes the video cooler to know that. Thanks for sharing
---
I frequently report bots, so yes I will, just need to gather some log entries ingame for undeniable proof. But dotlan npc kill stats like this are a 99% hint to bots. Even people that afk-farm with 2 accounts are not that stable over 16-18 hrs dayly.
---
I thought something happened to it when they came for the cynos.
---
Oh but geopolitic don't work like real life in Eve Online. Like Dead Coalition will shoot the Imperium members in their space without hesitation , but they will work alongside the Imperium anytimes to shoot down PandaFam.
---
My point is Provibloc is align with Legacy in the greater picture of the New Eden politic and they will be strongly dependant of their help if a very big boys will step on their space.
---
Go for it
---
Awww the whiney krab is back, well so blackout removed is still not enough for your safety? You really want to play EVE or Hello-Kitty-Online?
---
Hmmm, let me think how we krabbed as Newbros, without an umbrella, without a multiple 10k-blob as backup? Just me and 2 friends beltratting in Curse or in hostile Sovspace ... (no infinite respawning Anoms back then, and Colossals were Sigs you had to probe, good old days)
---
1) its the logical thing to do.  but as its ccp..
---
2) the new mmo job stuff in london seem to be eve based, though it could be something else.
---
3) the lack of 'big stuff' the past few years.  it honestly feels like they shifted focus to rebuilding things.
---
I'm prolly wrong, but who knows.
---
Yes, massive update. Getting skins, more skins, a few really expensive skins, some cheap skins, a couple ugly skins, and lastly some other skins. 
---
All available in the store.
---
Conjecture, conjecture, insult, insult. Yep, I'm definitely still on /r/eve
---
I very much doubt the Jita 4-4 model from Echoes is going to be the same one they use for 4-4 in real EVE. It looked very minmatar-esque. Like a rusty double-length Fortizar.
---
So are you suggesting they never make QoL changes?
---
Probably because you don't hang out behind the dumpster with us.
---
Yeah but funnily enough even though they all say different things they all agree that ccp is doing it wrong, whatever they change. People have literally been begging ccp to remove local in null for a decade, and then they do, and then people complain and say ccp has killed the game, and that they should have done those OTHER things that people have asked them to change
---
"most players" i certainly wouldnt, speak for yourself
---
You forget that we hobos live in Placid/Solitude. We just tend to mess with 0.0 because it's fun.
---
The problem with caps is there's no anti-blob mechanics in them the way there are with subs.  No matter how many subs you bring, I can wipe them with a few bomber squads if I'm good and/or you're not careful.  There's no analogous threat to caps, the only thing that can kill caps in any numbers is more caps.
---
Even though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death, we will fear no evil, for Bob if with us.  
---
It is our hope that Bob is pleased with our sacrifice, and may his whim serve us well in the next chapter of your journey through the dark void.

That's because you're in TAPI and wouldn't know what to fucking do if the game stopped being Farmville, because goons haven't spelled it out for you yet. Moron.

If you're interested in lowsec PVP/ faction war give me a shout.
---
Useless comment after useless comment, still r/eve HAHAHA SEE I DID A FUNNY TOO
---
\&gt; i dont have an argument so i must trash talk you for your flair
---
ok try again tho, and for the record i dont even rat in null, and goons arent blue to test
---
I'm going to go with you're wrong. Not that I want you to be but CCP hasnt shown any behavior exhibiting they know how to manage their game or company.
---
Yes it requires one additional character.
---
Stay Classy
---
Yea games in a shit spot now. Hunter has even less tools than before black out lmbo
---
&gt;someone referenced most players but I am not in that group therefore I should be heard and vocalize that i, am indeed, not most players!
---
Fuck right off.
---
&gt;goons arent blue to test
---
Good meme
---
&gt; when a human player actually starts to rat in same system, but the fallback to the bot level is easy to recognize
---
Couldn't this also happen with just, say, 4 people living in a system that are in mostly different timezones.
---
Overlap is just when they are all on, and then it goes back down to 2?
---
not really
---
Ok now i know who will by my neighbour.        
---
We will be most annoying people on street and kids will be crying just by looking at our homes !

Sorry mate, INIT is actually two DLCs in one for 65
---
30mil ticks still equals 90m in an hour. you'd have to get quite lucky to do that in exploration (mind you, you might indeed get lucky and get that and more in 1 can). theres also the fact that this is paid to you in liquid isk - most other ISK making activities in null/wh's have you needing to haul+sell stuff, which incurs its own penalties and risks - theres many an explorer who's spent many hours scanning and doing cans only to lose it all to a sabre on a gate - thats not a risk ratters face.  
---
i also think you are exaggerating the difficulty of spamming d-scan. if you are ratting, you are presumably already microing your modules etc, adding one extra key press into the routine really isnt that onerous...   
---
that said, i agree that if the blackout were to become permanent, id expect d-scan and what not to be refined from a gameplay perspective. the interface is total trash, and theres no reason not to automate the 14.3/360 scan to a certain degree, making the directional part more about pinpointing where people are exactly.
---
Do you have literally any source on your claim that "most players would wholly accept those changes basically as is, over the current state of the game" other than that people on /r/eve upvoted it? No
---
I mean, good luck. I wont beat around the bush, we're better than you in basically all regards.
---
I agree. Most of the hurf and blurf seems to come in the form of “classic eve, let’s go back to the old school days of kitchen sink roaming”. 
---
Like any developing system, going backwards is not the answer. So rather than whine about how we used to play, we need to fully account for the current situations, economics and politics and move forward from there.
---
WTS recons!
---
TBF, they gotta replace the fleeing *Western players* with **someone**. /s
---
I would say most of our requests from pilots in pods tend to SD if we don’t have an immediate route to them. Understandably pilots are only willing to wait if they’re trying to save something. An interesting thing is what is valuable depends on the pilot. We’ve had pilots in 3B ISK ships SD and ones in 200m ISK ships wait. Pilots in pods are usually willing to wait if they have a ton of implants.
---
the question is.... Does some one in brave need to ask someone else to become an fc 1st before there allowed to FC a fleet.
---
Or
---
Can any one form a fleet and fight people.
---
I mean, cynos on Battle cruisers, Command Ships (not destroyers), and battleships would be good..
---
Could you try and have a more useless post =P
---
Nope, the curve clearly shows that there is some setup running that without any break (peeing/eating/smoking) is killing 180 NPC/hr for 16 hrs straight, and that every day. I know there are many players that like to farm PvE Content, but even the most "autistic" is not that stable. The spikes however are human players additionally ratting for a short time. If you want to see high but not botted curves you can check Delve main ratting systems. The graph looks much more indifferent and spiking (up or down). In fact a horizontal line in NPC kills for more than 10 hrs and dayly repeating is a 99% indicator for a botting setup.
---
Edit: A Lot of Droneland-Systems were looking like this for years.
---
Because carriers exist, tbh
---
I can't disagree with most of this. From a 2011 ish perspective:
---
Safe POSes weren't that uncommon but were really alliance only facilities. They had to be BM'd in advance and you didn't give out passwords unless you really had to. Safe'ing up in a JB POS often turned out to be a bad choice due to the standard password each alliance had.
---
People preferring station systems for the safety and convenience factor was still a noticeable factor. Camping the entrance to somebodies "only station" to catch the returning defenders was already dying out. Bubbles on stations to catch people who were running was still a thing but more habit than regular success I think.
---
&gt; Obviously Legacy doesn't want HTP (and their PanFam buddies) to get a proper foothold in Provi, as that would place a hostile super-capital group right in their back yard. So turning up to these batphone contest timers - where HTP+PanFam are going up against Provibloc - on Provibloc's side just makes sense.
---
so you're just a meatshield region without any of the benefits, nice.
---
Not nearly to the scale they could. The issue with ammo icons, or asb/cap booster, etc have existed for years, in some cases all the way to alpha. And to think, that's something an 11 year old could fix with 2 minutes in paint.
---
Correct, your comment was useless. I'm glad you're catching on.
---
The cyno restriction would have worked as somewhat of a balance if Blackout was still in effect. But now, with no blackout, that is a major advantage to the PvE crew.
---
C'mon CCP, make hunting less punishing again..
---
I know its useless to fight bots and RMT, It just gives me a good feeling, I am selfishly doing this just for me.
---
Having not tried every alliance in the game I could not say brave is better or worse than anyone else. The thing that keeps me around is probly the "culture" more than anything. For the most part everyone is easy to talk to. if someone starts some rant about politics or any other heated topic they are reminded and it's over. Another huge plus is you can basically do what you want. Within reason. The thing others have hinted at is you basically have two very different alliances in one. Brave catch and brave impass. I think it is a fight for what one is currently braves true identity.
---
Provi is the king true pvp system all you jokers that say you want to fight small gang / sub cap are doing it wrong if you are not in or around provi just check the killboards it’s some of the most active space for real pvp Sev3erance should be on this list.
---
Anyone can form a fleet, without an actual FC backseating there is no SRP however anyone is allowed to form and FC, their fleet might be taken over by an actual FC if it turns into a stratop level problem though
---
What about a system that flags suspect behavior and let a human check it? 
---
Like a volunteer GM who warps in cloaked, checks on the guy for a minute and might try to trigger some unusual bot behavior or just try to talk to the person. 
---
Give the volunteers some free shit like a Concord ship or some special skin or sth.
---
CCP are always show proudness for their modifications in EVE, even when we are telling them how bad they were. Obviously, it means that it will take time and probably a change of personnel so that it will be corrected, if it can happen.
---
Just the missile nerf of Quantum Rise took 4 years. Capital Proliferation was predictable since the skill requirement nerf of 2011 so we are close to a decade and still not corrected.
---
They don't take lessons from previous errors. Citadel Proliferation was predictable using the situation of the Stations at this time, as they were rare at first but progressively they were built nearly everywhere. 15 B each is a steal for so much features, more useful than a Titan. Obviously, we would see citadels everywhere in numbers.
---
And I think that CCP consider us as children, unable to maximize our efficiency in making ISK and exploiting the game mechanisms. Sadly, we are players with decades of gaming behing us, so we are nearly specialists for that.
---
But I sometimes wonder how much hours a day they really work. Two ? One ? To be so slow to realize and act, they probably don't work...
---
I came up with brave during D06 days.  We undocked for everything.   I lost a ton of atrons and other cheap t1 ships.  Feeding was demoralizing.
---
Not true.
---
I think the game had a lot more potential for fun back then. There is too much isk being generated. I think a lot of issues come from the lack of isk sinks. It would be nice to see the big corps actually need to work for things again and worry about income. Though I imagine even with isk sinks a problem would still arise from CCP selling isk for real money.
---
CCP already controls all of the ISK faucets and sinks. Why would they need a controlled reserve currency?
---
Go read the minutes
---
All people need to do is check the killboard ranks to understand that the whole provi is sheeple thing is a flipping joke. We have some of the top pvp corps in the game in provi.
---
1st Goons showing signs of hospitalism due to inappropriate keeping for the species EVE-player ...
---
Thanks chris!
---
Sure, the other person can always fuck up badly. They could burn out all their mods, or forget ammo or dc in the middle of a fight.
---
That doesn't affect that the worm is far stronger than an incursus and any of the t1 frigs by a large margin.
---
Pretty simple to no join a pirate organization for a roam .
---
I've been thinking of joining a wormhole Corporation to rat and maybe mine and was just wondering what most Wormhole corporations ask in return in terms of helping out. I assume defense for sure but didn't know if lots had some kind of other requirement like helping with manufacturing ect.
---
Well, a decent counter to this would be if the cyno inhib locked the system. But it lit up on the overview system wide. So, you can come kill it and get a fight.. but you would have to jump rescue troops to the next system, gate into prepared bubbles also being a fight point then warp towards an anom by which at this time would most likely have a chunk of bubbles. Even if it's a smaller group, you could still task someone to drop t2 fast anchoring deployable bubbles on gates if you can't bring sabres (covert hot dropping).
---
i mean i thought PL was in the bazaar to buy an army for themselves. Get it now?
---
the good half :)
---
in theory, you'd have a team at CCP that would look over the changes and select a few that were technically plausible for testing etc.  and then after testing and feedback, they would either implement the changes or scrap them. 
---
instead, we get untested BS that just goes live.
---
I 2nd that.
---
I got it in German and it offers a lot of background story about the happenings of that time.
---
With all due respect, a lot of the wealth that built the west was stolen from elsewhere. If it was not the East India Company it was slavery and whatnot. I doubt that the Congolese had much say in the acquisition of the uranium used to make the nuclear bombs that terrorised innocent Japanese civilians in 1945.   
---
Let's not pretend that the Chinese are the first to steal from others in order to grow their economy/country; the West perfected that art.
---
To pile on to the already large number of responses, would you want to pick a  fight with the great Kali? Because the worm if the great Kali.
---
Lets all take a moment to thank TAPI for enabling AOM.
---
They're currently sitting at just over 630mil in Jita, dropped since Blackout ended. At the end of August they were over 800mil. I found one for sale in a wormhole freeport for 350mil when the Jita price was 800mil. Bought it and evacced it for a good profit!
---
I'm sorry, I didn't realize your disability was so severe, allow to to explain better.
---
CCP has a very long history of implementing changes that they don't think through and have been repeatedly told are bad ideas. A major reason for his is that they don't play their game and don't listen to their appointed player representatives. A million other bad ideas from outside of CCP have been proposed and a majority are amazingly even worse than the half assed Band-Aids CCP tries to throw at the game.
---
That post was a very comprehensive list of suggestions that are generally well thought out and solve the actual issues with Eve in it's current state. While all other posts are downvoted to oblivion and brigaded with retard comments, this one surfaced. It was widely received by the community here to be a much better list of changes than CCP has done or planned. 
---
That is what led me to make the off the cuff statement of "Most people would be down for that." I didn't realize this statement would have to be fact checked against the dwindling eve playerbase to determine if, infact, a majority of players would prefer it. Next time I use a figure of speech on the internet I'll make sure to label it so dumb fucks like you have an easier time understanding
---
The irony is strong with this one
---
" I think we'll hit above 30,000 players by the end of October."
---
we're never breaking 30k again.  hope for 25k, plan for 20k.
---
It's almost like it's easier to make bots than ban them. They're banning waves of bots but at that point the damage is done. All they can do is react
---
Can you tell me what the bad half are and why? Would love to know.
---
So you're saying they stole our idea to steal shit? Typical.
---
Ive been saying ccp needs to make a bot to find and ban bots or make them prema red flashy so they cant dock or tether.
---
provide proof or evidence.   screenshots, names, etc.
---
otherwise your post isn't helpful.  just saying "those people are botting" doesn't exactly help.     
---
and how do you know they a bot,  and not a player afk mining?
---
for sites, i've spent 4 years doing lv 4s in highsec(college...not much spare time), and got called a bot plenty.   wasnt a bot, just someone who liked watching the turrets shooting.     so how can you prove its not someone like me?
---
i not saying your wrong. as your likely correct.  but the post isnt much help without identifying specifics.
---
Don't forget they're all *limited time offers get them now*
---
that's a bit of a stretch IMO.
---
but even if i agreed with this logic, 'they did it first' isn't a defense.
---
Thank you!
---
It's sad to see that dropping caps is the standard "content" in Eve
---
Spoiler : Skins.
---
Lol we made a list. Most people don’t know the guys living behind the dumpster.
---
No problem! This sub is a toxic shithole, so I'd be weary. Just find a good group and have fun
---
Source: am toxic shithead
---
Its almost like people have different opinions, and some of them are stupid, crazy I know.
---
Just ban everyone with no RP name imo
---
He said half.
---
No u
---
I swear if I catch you cherry picking I will hunt you down
---
It's actually been the opposite for us. We have been consistently using t3ds for almost every single pocket defense. I don't think we have had a single capital or capital fleet drop on us after blackout and in turn, every single FC has called for subs only/first except for that one oops where we may have bridged to the wrong system and then they were on standby and not used.
---
Reportedly, most CCP devs that play are in a medium-sized wormhole corp.  And a whole lot of their designs make sense if everyone was in a medium-sized corp.  
---
Citadels would be valuable assets, and you couldn't afford to plop down Keepstars like mobile depots.  
---
Rorquals work extremely well if you can only fly about two at once.
---
You also couldn't build dozens of titans at once, blanket a region with jump bridges, drop a few trillion on buying an alliance, and so on.
---
After the T20 incident, they're understandably reluctant to get involved in the big blocs, but they seem to have a big blind spot on how their changes will be used when you have bloc-level resources at your disposal.
---
that's why the good old "things players have been asking you to fix for the last decade" is so useful, it gets upvotes from everyone because they can all just imagine their own shitty idea in there
---
Bots didnt leave when blackout hit. They moved to random hs areas and ran lvl 4 abyssals in a 400 mil gila for 18 hours every day uninterrupted
---
Most of our pvp is in Syndicate.
---
I was probably a bit too vague. The standard of what"good" content is largely boils down to using caps for a majority of players now.
---
Do they come as an enema?
---
Nerf citadel's and rorquals. There's two
---
Except things don't get fixed they just get changed to a different bad
---
Not really, if you look at kills it's almost split between LS and. Null.
---
brave blued mango? ahahahahahahhahahaaha
---
no, your contributions are worthless
---
Says a random Goon with infinite isk and 385778 citadels and supers 😑
---
The Old Ways of Eve.
---
Very nice slide for EVE
---
Then bring hyenas/huggins/rapiers/lokis to web the jags up before they get close.
---
Ahh yeah, you’re right.
---
No, I got what you were saying. I'm not disagreeing that that is what happens all too often. I've been VERY happy with all of the response fleets and have been jumping on as many as I can, because it's been great fun taking 30-40 dudes in Jackdaws trying to beat off 70-100 bombers/cmd/kiki/logi.  We have had a couple great fights and a couple hard fights. I have over 100 of that ship+doctrine in stagings that I'm selling at straight cost from Jita because it's great fun.
---
point proven
---
Despite the Party in China will deny, China is Turbo-Capitalism at its best. No money for the "working class".
---
this \^
---
And then they all leave and create a new alliance. Get scammazed
---
fair enough
---
ITT crab mentality
---
It was a CSM session about a question if he would engage them if Logi was removed. So no Logi.
---
So, if I disagree - then clearly I'm wrong.
---
Yes let's resort to personal attacks
---
You know what else was (ACTUALLY) unanimously agreed to be a good idea for ccp to implement? Removing null sec local, and then they did, and then the players got mad that they did, and the login numbers plummeted, but yeah let's keep listening to forum posts
---
You must not know about Legacy code. Shit like this always seems easy, and it never is
---
It is the same person, she was PIBC "mayor" in the north of Serenity. The Serenity Reskin of TQ has begun, thanks to Goons and TAPI for harbouring the people that managed to kill Serenity Economy in just 7 years of total existance with blatant botting and RMT.
---
Finally all the players are returning after blackout ended. So good ccp rolled back the change so that we can all live and talk to each other again.
---
&gt;from a goberment's money printer.
---
What exactly do you think ratting bounties are?
---
They change the wrong stuff 😑 . Like citadels spam needs to be addressed what does CCP do. "We adding .7cpu to some rando bs frigate no one cares about except the 53 people in Jebis discord.
---
Dude I was replying to said entire Chinese economy is built on stealing from others. I replied by telling him that British &amp; American economies (and the West, generally) got where they are today because of theft. It is not a defence of anything; more like those who stay in glass houses... Pot calling kettle black.  
---
It's like how the west wants to preach to everyone about polluting and climate change yet its their deeds that got us here. Now that others are doing the same to grow their economies they start pretending they care about the environment and whatnot, and want to police everyone else. [And stuff like this](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/28/treated-like-trash-south-east-asia-vows-to-return-mountains-of-rubbish-from-west).
---
that's a bit of a stretch&gt;&gt;&gt; facts don't care...
---
I would gladly add some Tazer to your spiked club.
---
ship balancing is apparently the wrong stuff, even tho half this subreddit is complaining about not enough balance patches
---
I really liked PLs process of having a word randomizer in their forums for official posts, so the release would be essentially written with various places that would have acceptable words swapped.
---
So that every user would receive a different version of the release.
---
So if it was publicized, they could immediately identify the leak and purge them.
---
Except we don;t know what they were built on top of or how they work in the code.  For examples, timers could be linked to old pos code and can only be done cretin ways, it could very well be they can;t change how timers work yet, because they need to remove what its built on top of.
---
While the citadels and timers are not legacy, they could easily be built on top of legacy code and not a totally re-write.  Also there could of been interaction with legacy code that was unexpected when they try to change something.  An example, back in red moon rising, CCP made a random change to pos' and broke mining.  Like utterly broke it.  
---
Just because its not legacy code doesn't mean it doesn't interact or work on top OF legacy code.
---
This was a QOL negative. We still get our saves out, I think our success rate is higher as we don't face Rorq pilots who botch their cyno or not notice inhib. Hope this changes as I can't be fucked to train my cynos to recons.
---
all these flavours and you choose beep beep boop beep
---
No one is confused on the issues that Eve has in 2019. Id argue more players are actually coming to the same conclusions more often than not now. The problem lies in CCPs inability/unwillingness to fix it the right way.
---
&gt; Why?
---
Simple Answer: The Worm has the highest DPS/tank ratio of any frigate.
---
Longer answer: Stupid high DPS/tank ratio, selectable damage type (on both drones and missiles/rockets) great application, etc.
---
Consider this fit:
---
    [Worm, MAINLINE - - - Scram Rocket]
---
    Drone Damage Amplifier II
---
    5MN Y-T8 Compact Microwarpdrive
---
    Republic Fleet Medium Shield Extender
---
    Rocket Launcher II, Scourge Rage Rocket
---
    Small Anti-EM Screen Reinforcer II
---
    Small Core Defense Field Extender II
---
        
---
    Acolyte II x2
---
    Hobgoblin II x2
---
    Nanite Repair Paste x150
---
    Caldari Navy Inferno Rocket x1000
---
    Caldari Navy Mjolnir Rocket x1000
---
    Caldari Navy Nova Rocket x1000
---
    Caldari Navy Scourge Rocket x1000
---
13.5k EHP and 309 DPS heated.  Granted I'm cheating a bit since
---
1. You wouldn't be using the Rage rockets on other frigates
---
2. You'd probably be using a faster drone than the Hobgoblins with less DPS on other frigates.
---
But the numbers illustrate the point that the Worm is dummy strong.
---
I honestly wanted JFs to be able to jump to covert... I mean, I am biased. I have 5 prospect hunters that can also sit in bombers.
---
No, I am not saying that. You're the one saying it.
---
With the above said, CCP could believe changing timers is incorrect and the way it is now is the best.  We really just don;t know.  
---
I agree with the majorty that assest safty and timers needs ot be tweeked (no asset safty in medium structures period, timers should be linked to stront)
---
Nothing really about super or Titan balance, which sucks.  CCP Fozzie needs to break his mentality of we arent going to change cyno jammers because hes plain wrong on them.
---
Cyno has turned into strategic asset you have to think about where to place. It's not a simple "save my ship" or "shit out dreads when in doubt" button anymore
---
And ships are much more engageable now
---
Ok, I laughed in 010101001110
---
That wasn't even remotely close to "unanimously agreed on" by the playerbase as being good lmao. There was a minority that wanted it, and a majority that reeeee'd the game into the ground when CCP realized PvE alts is what keeps the numbers inflated and game alive.
---
Yeah
---
They started "outsourcing" at least in the systems on the frontier. GeminiWhaleUnited now holds all their ADM-Bots for not populated/used systems
---
Hell dunks or blue balls is infinitely more fun.
---
That sure hasn't been my experience.  While it's not a new player friendly group, I've found rote to be much more humble than most other competent small gang groups. They but some amount of effort into weeding out 'edgelords' and similar, and the worst fleet experiences I've had since joining have been joint fleets with allies.  I haven't had any issues with people in Rote.
---
How so?
---
These types of conferences can always do with a presentation or 2 that aren't hyper-technical, but a bit fun and get you thinking about your activities in a different light.
---
&gt; Can you tell me what the bad half are and why? Would love to know.
---
give me a test server and a team and i could figure it out.  not rocket science.  literally how most games are developed.  You start with a bunch of ideas and test them.
---
funny how how something everyone agrees on suddenly becomes "a minority wanted it" when it's no longer a good idea
---
&gt; Nope, the curve clearly shows that there is some setup running that without any break (peeing/eating/smoking) is killing 180 NPC/hr for 16 hrs straight, and that every day. 
---
How do you identify this compared to just 2 playesr swapping out for 2 other players?
---
Except it hasn't. This hasn't changed our defensive capabilities at all. It has immensely changed our perceptions of what potential threat a hostile fleet has, because as long as they have zero recons with them- they aren't escalating. Perhaps that's a positive if more people are willing to then take the fight in subcaps on even terms rather than escalate, it could be a good thing.
---
There will ALWAYS be ship balance crying. It comes in cycles. You will never have a perfect meta
---
I get what you are saying as I've been in the same boat. Since I've done the continuous ratting for hours on end. 
---
But if you ever go out in small gang PvP roams from wormholes it happens more often than you think that we run into bots. So much so that when we jump into the system you immediately have the guy warping off. We always kill and report them because you are able to figure out the exact timer between warping to safety and continuing with ratting.
---
If you jump and warp to the site at the exact time their timer runs out you land at the same site at the same time.
---
I have a copy of The Burning Life in my car. 
---
I miss the days CCP put that much work into their lore.
---
These are different bots, they are still present now, but the ones in Sov-Null, that stopped after they died repeatedly to broken scripts are back now. Sure there is Bots in Hisec, and yes Abyssals gave Hisec Bots a boost, but all other Hisec botting is much less profitable while it is NOT safer than in deep Sov-Nullsec. Maybe ask yourself why Imperium currently is funding a large scale campaign to gank Hisec-Moon-Miners (Orca-Bots and also real players) and paid PIRAT to remove all the Hisec Athanors. It is a deliberate plan since years now to make Hisec less secure than Nullsec to drive people into the mass corps in Nullsec.
---
Can we clean the shit stain...?
---
No dipshit, a majority never wanted local gone in null lmao
---
Also, I don't think the onus should be on the players to find the evidence and statistics for the things that are breaking the game, we can only do so much.
---
The onus are on CCP to protect its player base from that which would inevitably hurt them and their legitimate players.
---
Make corporation limits smaller and eliminate blue tags. Player groups need to be fractured and decisions need to be removed from the hands of less than a dozen people and placed into the hands of hundreds.
---
Goon Forums &gt; Space GBS &gt; Goon Meets
---
Don't have the game in front of me atm, but there is a menu slider (Esc) that allows you to move your ship's center by 10%.
---
Also, you should be able to shift+C and eliminate auto-tracking whatever you click.  If that doesn't work, check your shortcuts menu after pressing escape.  I think it's under the Navigation tab?
---
yes they fucking did, where were you 2010-2019?
---
lmao you're perfect for tapi
---
&gt;As someone who owns 2 titans, this is bullshit, people can have valid opinions about them just fine regardless of whether they own them yes / no or a relatively new player
---
Can have an opinion on something you know fuck all about eh? Well I can see why the commenter above thinks everyone has 10 rorq alts.
---
&gt;They arent rare
---
This is relative. But they're absolutely more rare than this sub makes out.
---
And you will never have a perfect game, so ccp should just stop making updates to it at all
---
 \&gt; i dont have an argument so i must trash talk you for your flair 
---
again
---
&gt;And that thing is the main motto of the alliance: stay classy.
---
There are other groups that do that better while also being at least somewhat more competent tbqh
---
ustz retards feeding, nothing new. and how is this relevant?
---
From my experience in gaming-industries: The faces you see telling you about how "awesome this new shit is" are not necessarily convinced themselves. They are TOLD to say what they say and in what way to say it.  
---
If you see a gaming-company openly and honestly admitting "We fucked that up, sorry, we ll see that we get it fixed." then CELEBRATE that, cause that is pretty rare.  
---
And that dudes you see usually DO work their butts off. Mostly with stuff invisible to the customers and usually senseless monkey-tasks, documentation, the 3rd daily review for some aloft helicopter-manager about how the product is doing in which they are not allowed to lie, but not allowed to write "Thats been bad." either.
---
There must be something they can do. I understand that it can hurt the player base if they do something intense but getting rid of the infection that has spread from serenity will have to take a little pain on our part. Like all infections require in order to be healed.
---
Trash fc he said...
---
All ccp genie had to do was not listening to powerhouse members in the csm
---
ITT: nullbears throwing the word "fag" around like it's the 1980s
---
Yeah but hunting for large targets has become a bit easier now since you can be sure the ship itself wont shit out response fleet and there can be some counterplays against dedicated recon. We have yet to see how it will play out on larger scale, but imo everything being able to cyno in was a cancer tier mechanic that had to be removed
---
And thats a LIE! Rags do not "explode" they just fall apart into a cloud of Rifters.
---
"He did it first" is not an argument.
---
Not just a shield, no. Even in Legacy's eyes we would be more than that. And I don't really mind them thinking of us as a shield as long as they leave us to do our own thing, which they have.
---
Here are the changes I think would be more beneficial.
---
1) remove drone mining yield bonuses. (But not drone damage boosts)
---
2) add the ability to bridge (and jump) subcap mining ships to industrial cynos
---
3)allow rorq to fit industrial cyno generator
---
These changes keep the mining support ship play style in line with combat ship progression while also not allowing them to literally inhale anomalies and moons in a few minutes.
---
Got called a boter so many times because I Multiboxed mining barges in high and null just because I used fleet warp.. or I Klicked so fast that because of the server ticks two or even three clients activated the lasers at the same time.. you can’t call everyone a bit just because he knows how to run multiple clients or even use a game mechanic like fleet warps :)
---
31% efficiency when outnumbered 3:1 isn't trash, but to answer your question, no they aren't &amp; never were.
---
Lololol get rekt snuffbois.
---
&gt; o much so that when we jump into the system you immediately have the guy warping off.
---
except players do this as well.   the moment you see red in local you align out and leave.
---
and you tend to go back once red is gone.
---
Yea, I'm not disagreeing. But a few more medium to larger size ships might not be a bad thing. Re: t1 BC/BS.  I'm all for not putting them on capital ships or anything nullified.
---
There would be a break in the line. The line we see says that there are 2 Ishtars running for 16 hrs without break at the same killspeed. This excludes f.e. even a short break, or another player with different skills or setup.
---
But I said, it is "only" 99% proof of botting. To verify the last 1% you have to visit the system and check the behaviour, like stopwatch rewarp timers and other stuff.
---
If you think of the situation of chinese gold farmers in other games, then maybe this is human, but EULA-breaching too. Think of an office where 1st shift rats 8 hours, and then 2nd shift takes over same account without interrupting them.
---
This so much. I feel like the player base are fucking idiots and don't know how to design a fun game either. There are problems from Eve but taking some random guys advice on the internet is not how to further your game.
---
yeh saw the slider thing, but that just pushes everything over to the left. 
---
I 100% remember changing the shift C tracking position in the past though. So when I click on something to track my ship isn't in the way of me seeing what I'm tracking (not sure if i'm explaining it well lol)
---
pvp.
---
Basically no wormhole corp will accept you if you say you don't want to actively pvp.
---
Who?
---
Didn't they do one of the things players have been wanted for a decade and it nearly killed the game?
---
Life is pretty good all in all, great iskies to be had ice mining as always.
---
Jame's little Code monkeys are always good for a laugh, nothing beats watching some salted little children shake their fists at you from Caldari space but to afraid to venture into real space because unsurprisingly pissing off literally everyone is not a good idea.
---
Lotta wars going on, lotta lines in sand being drawn, lotta pissed off Chinese and Russians. So business is booming.
---
Other than that thanks to the absolute pants shitting that went on with the nullsec blackout I've been making stupid amounts of isk off exporting Tritanium.
---
The cyno changes seemed to have made local cap/super cap superiority even more oppressive defensively while severely limiting their offensive potential. For lowsec groups such as myself it makes solo drops pretty easy but getting a counterdrop organized is a lot harder unless your prepared before hand which isn't always possible. The large groups have adapted quickly by having a permanent recon alt sit next to rorq or supers so that any drop is suicide for the attacker. 
---
Not really sure what CCPs plan was here. Caps are now less useful offensively and much more forgiving to use defensively.
---
Whoa now, GSF isn't BoB, BoB lived in delve, insulated by legions of subhuman pets, and had an egomaniacal lea— oh
---
No a majority never ever did. What on earth gave you that idea?
---
Losing 20 ships to kill 3 is probably less fun then than doing nothing, losing often can be disheartening.
---
This guy definitely doesnt code hahahaha
---
Well ignoring the obvious issues because of upsetting the megablobs forced this current condition. Look at what happened with blackout. All the null block whining and quitting. CCP has to cater to the Goonie goons
---
Except for Perimeter, right?
---
Stop allowing VPN connections? Kind of a blunt instrument though
---
&gt; This excludes f.e. even a short break, or another player with different skills or setup.
---
But of course, most ratters would be using very similar setups with similar skills.
---
And where would the break in the line be? AFK ratting isn't so tough that someone going for a piss would stop the flow.
---
You’re retarded what divides us is you hate people who don’t kiss your ass and play your way you manbaby.
---
The real world won’t treat you with the kiddie gloves this game does
---
Botting/scripting is a problem in every single game on the market that isn't single player. It's not just Eve my dude. To expect CCP to be able to just wave a magic wand and stop it is not a real expectation. The sad thing is, botters will always be one step ahead by the nature of the game. All CCP can do is try to keep up to the best of their abilities.
---
Everyone needs to make money to fund their wars. vOv
---
"He's telling off others after reaping the benefits of doing the same thing earlier" is though.
---
&gt; Serenity's players are moving over to TQ and doing the exact same things that killed their server. It's even the exact same leaders doing it. Botting might have been allowed over there but on TQ it isn't allowed.
---
Imagine believing botting on TQ started in 2017.
---
Bots aren't killing the game, infact I'd argue they're probably not even a big deal. It just feels like that because CCP has deleted every single PVP activity besides hunting ratters and sitting in tidi with 800 of your closest comrades.
---
Ah now I understand, In the EVE you play all Characters are injected to the same amount of Skillpoints ... then you are right and there should be no difference. Hence if it is players that really played and skilled EVE for years its unlikely /s ...
---
Pretty new to the game (about a week in), so sorry for highjacking your comment, but:
---
Null=dangerous space
---
Local=local channel which helps you to know if players are in your vicinity
---
Correct?
---
So... Gankers wanted to be able to gank without people seeing them in local and immediately warping off?
---
If that's the case then I can understand why the "gankees" are salty about the change.
---
We aren't in the QFC, we just have some Querious. Delve bunnies just haven't taken it back yet
---
&gt; "He did it first" is not an argument
---
I know. It's called the two wrongs fallacy in logic, which I know a lot about. Despite that, I am pointing out a double standard. My argument is that if we are going to argue that the Chinese or whoever are thieves/cheats, giving the example that he gave, then it's only fair to point out that Americans too are thieves/cheats using his exact example. We can only make a fair comparison once we know that stealing and cheating is something that both societies/countries have done, and is not exclusive to the Chinese. 
---
Another argument could be that the west lowered the accepted standards so its ironic for its people to accuse others of things they perfected.
---
The Chinese are using VPNs to connect to TQ because Serenity was shut down. They are now migrating in such numbers that large alliances have formed with accusations that they are continuing to bot like they did in Serenity since it wasn't against the rules there. Now a former EVE-Serenity leader paid equivalent $10,000 USD in isk to buy Ranger Regiment which is widely accused of botting en mass. The Serenity faction that eventually dominated their entire server is the AOM/RR group allies to TEST+GOONS while the opposition is the WC group which is friends with Panfam. Both sides are accusing each other of botting/rmt here and on their respective Chinese communities.
---
yeah, that´s why people prefer playing rl these days. kinda non sensical to play a game that bores the shit out of anyone more ambitious than a bottom feeder drone.
---
I'm popping in to say...yea. 
---
I started playing in Trinity era (loooong time ago) and boys were present then. I haven't even paid attention to the game in years but all this recent drama has me poking around again. ,An the game has changed (I quit after Jump Freighters were added, got one, a mom and a dread and just quit)
---
100mn afterburner ishtar fix everything
---
Jesus, most of those suggestions are either completely self serving or utter trash....
---
Fraternity is pretty much dead at this point. All the other Chinese groups are aligned with Legacy and Goons and these would never tolerate botters. I find your post borderline racist tbh.
---
some were reships.
---
Scan the chain. Be proactive in looking for content. If people want help in some sort of PVP and you're online and in the chain, it's no longer time to rat.
---
Don't worry about mining very much. The only time when it's better than Null is if you find a connection to a shattered system. Moons are the same as in 0.5, you're sometimes going to find good ore anomalies, that's about it. For low-risk, low-effort ISK, Rorquals in umbrella space are still your best option.
---
The NullBloc propaganda is that wormhole ratting is vast quantities of risk-free ISK, but that's not true. If you know what you're doing and are paying attention, you can be pretty safe, but if not, you can lose a lot of ISK pretty quickly.
---
61 vs 20 with one logi.  At least they took the fight and arent flying t1 garbage?
---
&gt; we fight each other wherever we can 
---

You are one pretencious cunt, arent you?
---
Best EVE book I've read so far.
---
Guilty as charged. I don't know an equivalent saying in english, so i went with what i got.
---
Reeeeeeeeeeee F1 reeeeeeeeeee
---
is relevant because it seems FE+Reverberation is the new power house of EVE.So far they swapped the floor with Rote, PL, Snuff, Theran (that's easy) and Init (I believe)'s ships  using their mighty gilas.
---
Unfortunatly the target tracking square cannot be moved anymore. it always point upper right of center. i miss this feature, like the view of your char inside station
---
&gt; It's almost like it's easier to make bots than ban them.
---
It doesn't help that CCP made eve a botter's wet dream. PVE that's extremely easy to automate, perfect intel that lets you know when a baddie is near by, characters that can be replaced in under an hour.
---
Skill injectors are what made eve botting the menace it is, and it's such a cash cow that they'll never remove them.
---
Man, I should tell my coworker, she identifies as being ethnically Chinese.
---
Like you, entitled manchildren who scream for free wins are pathetic in games take that shit to your protests rl, leave it out of games
---
if you want to beat people, do it with skill not by crying and screaming “op” because you lose
---
Perhaps it's the lack of gloating on reddit, that made those events fly under my radar. 
---
Anyway, i'm sure test or goons would respond, that Test would have been fine hadn't Frat brought panfam in. Those kind of conversations usually leads nowhere.
---
few reships.
---
You say that but legacy has showed up for multiple structure defenses I'm provi in the last 6 months
---
&gt; Can have an opinion on something you know fuck all about eh?
---
The fact that someone doesn’t own them and/or is relatively new doesn’t mean he/ she cant have a valid and informed opinion about them. In fact I know plenty of veteran titan owners who arent the brightest around. Let’s avoid shallow gatekeeping.
---
&gt; This is relative. But they're absolutely more rare than this sub makes out.
---
Yes it is relative and we are entering an area of authenticity and perception here, but most serious null blocs field significant amounts of titans and supers. Just because they arent thrown at everything doesnt mean a large number is on standby. I know this from my own experience. They are by no means a veteran ship anymore.
---
You either have a mental retardation, or you are a  dirty troll...
---
And just so you know, I find this quite amusing, so I doubt you can annoy me through reee
---
Removing attributes. Ccp even acknowledged they, the csm and the wider player base want them gone.
---
Chinese culture IS bad. The openly cheat on their SATs, in business, on video games, in politics... anything they can cheat on, they will. it's a part of their culture. The vast majority of Chinese people believe that if you don't cheat, you're stupid.
---
Exactly.
---
Tiericide, more frequent balance passes, UI improvements and chat stability are all things we can all agree on, right?
---
So you hate people with mental disability...
---
I understand that botting didn't start then. It was just a lot less prevalent.
---
The amount of confirmed bots we run into when doing small gang PvP is a lot more frequent than you think.
---
And I would argue that yes, they are ruining the game. I understand the other things aren't that nice but many people like the changes being brought about.
---
The high price of plex relates almost directly to the amounts of isk that bots generate. That shit is ridiculous. With the amount of isk they generate they are very effectively making the value of isk decline. 
---
There isn't enough thongs being destroyed to keep up with it.
---
Ah, this one actually plays eve for more than a reason to shit up reddit.
---
\#CCPLegacyCode
---
hush now. your spodbrain isn´t designed to handle that much exitement.
---
Well you asked for one everyone would support.
---
So british racist. Brixit means brexit
---
Hah, needed a good laugh, just blew coffee out my nose
---
Changing to a different bad is not fixing. If they could do it right, and be consistent, and introduce balanced and consistent new things, then it wouldn't need fixing in the first place.
---
Not surprising, the number of EVE players with a defense background is quite high, just in our corp we have several, some active duty, from armed forces around the world. 
---
One of the better known FC's in the game is a RL O-4 (might be O-5 now), he plays when he's not deployed. Also I've been told a certain Chinese FC is a RL PLA officer, and then there is the whole story about Vile Rat and his legacy in New Eden.
---
That's not the point I was making. I understand players do that as well. But players don't return to the site after a precise number of seconds or minutes. Players tend to vary.
---
When getting caught, players also do things very differently to a bot being caught. I do enough PvP to know the difference by now.
---
Did Init really have any issues of an "offensive campaign" though? You blued up pen is out and snuff which controls cloud ring &amp; Goons in delve obviously
---
The only real people dropping in fountain was GBT, DPCI and some snuff dudes (weird relationship you got there.) And this was from NPC fountain which took lots of prep and moving shit from Aridia with the assumption that those dreads were gunna die.
---
Any type of small gang was met with supers and titans once they jumped J5A. Not to mention that one guy in init that would roll around in a bait tanked domi just to drop is haw dread every second he could. 
---
No amount of change from ccp is going to change the fundamental problem which is that you are blue to half the game. Seriously. You want more local content? Take the plunge and reset some people. It's not like it will kill you. If anything it will give your guy's something to do instead of tagging along in whatever snuff op is happening in some proxy war.
---
I did, you're right. Best answer so far!

---
Brining back dead people is the whole point of the games respawn lore. And don't forget podding yourself to get to a new home station.  Two rules broken. So now their are only two rules.
---
I agree except nerf kiki. 
---
Though your list won't come close to fixing things, it's some good shit
---
y u hurt me liek dis
---
ccp: changes random stuff  
---
players: no dont change random, change broken
---
FIFY
---
You are literally the first person I've *ever* talked to that thinks the Kiki is even remotely balanced. I'm curious to hear your reasoning.
---
Ok lets grant everything you've said is true, do you think you'd care about bots nearly as much if randoms on null were undocking gangs and small fleets to fight your gang? What if there was structures you could attack to make them come?
---
Also not what I'm doing. There is a distinct difference between what you do and what the bots do. Do enough PvP and you will realise it quick enough.
---
Could put a cap on them, though.
---
I'ma keep it 100 with ya chief, the only thing WHers are better at than any other eve player is spamming the d scan button and holding an undeserved air of superiority.
---
volta are actually good pvpers though so the shade you're throwing doesn't really fall on them
---
Obviously that's not what I'm saying.
---
But people using dedicated alts will most likely be using similar setups.
---
Most ratting vexors are similarly fit, and on dedicated alts, the matter tends to be most efficient SP allocation, which results in similar skill lists.
---
This isn't difficult, my dude.
---
k, can you give some system examples or corps.   that way other players can look into it as well.  put more pressure on CCP to act on the individuals
---
if you feel they are bots.. report them. 
---
ccp will weed them out. complaining here wont fix it.
---
and your data is a bit wrong.  serenity died not due to botting but due to ccps contact with the Chinese company that ran eve ending. they started coming after they had no updates for 6 months.
---
bots made there economy suck however. though that could also be classic supply and demand but still.
---
We probably all want to see:   
---
access-list bookmarks #legacycode   
---
pos towers and modules removed #legacycode   
---
comprehensive corp roles #legacycode   
---
more options for standings-settings #legacycode

Imagine getting mad about getting a fight that 90% of this game wouldve just blueballed instead :joy:
---
Nice!
---
Wait what we are calling banderlogs impressive now?
---
&gt; web the jags up
---
the "up" here is redundant, if you really want to use a two word expression (where the single word expression does the job perfectly), "down" would be a better choice.
---
You obviously don't bot
---
&gt; if you're grinding boring af anomalies for 50M/h
---
... then you should question why you are doing that. Why do nullbears have an expectation that they should do 'boring af' gameplay? It's a game, play it to have fun! Do DED and combat site exploration or something which is more active, has higher payouts and isn't boring.
---
Rote people seem cool, fought them a couple of times recently. They don't sperge like 14yo in local and understand the concept of not ruining a good and fun fight.
---
The first one is actually coming, but ya I'd agree that all of those would be nice.
---
They have MG mimesis set and some skins. I guess that will be it on sisi.
---
Sounds like it was a step in the right direction, hopefully not the last one. Would be nice to have every day small scale PVP all over the place without it instantly escalating to capitals.
---
soooooon^(TM)

"Read to tatters" :)
---
You are going a long way to steal Dreddit's Newbie ship hangars.
---
I'm not a fan of newbro tackle. A newbro can be much more impactful in a Maulus than an Atron.
---
Doesn't that mean that it's a matter of priorities then? He doesn't seem to be against balancing as much as balancing while there's bigger issues to be addressed first.
---
I don't see what would prevent CCP from having both a dedicated balance team and a team for major gameplay issues.
---
not really.  People will sometimes do that, but most fights are spontaneous.
---
But certain fights are just common.  Like goons bringing a t1 cruiser fleet to ge- happens so regularly, the active fcs get a feel for who the enemy active fcs are, so if like a moa fleet gets reported in intel it'll be like 'oh that's X lets form for them'.  
---
Also goons do this thing where they have known enemy fcs set to red standings so they know not to headshot.  I know brave fcs have gotten convoed by goons asking to do that as well in the past.  So while it's not prearranged, it's not unexpected either.
---
&gt;It’s almost like some people want Eve to be Rifters Online
---
I do actually, that'd be awesome.
---
The was the most tangible "political" impact of blackout, for me - with the VNI/Myrm/Ishtar bots restricted to turtling up in a single system, ADMs tanked in Fade and Dek, and GOTG lost a number of systems in Fade. They were getting systems RFd in south Dek on a regular basis - another month or two and some lucky USTZ timers, and we could have made a more substantial dent. Now, the 23/7 Ishtars have ADMs back up above 4 across south Dek. There's a bit more human activity and more carrier/super activity (both human and not) post-blackout, but mainly confined to the NW corner.
---
&gt;Noraus contemplated the possibility of moving to Fountain, but Mittens did not approve of the plan

that's like asking a mechanic to repair your car engine but instead of fixing it he puts on a broken jet engine... i mean yeah it's great but that's not what I asked for... and after all that it still doesn't work...
---
Yeah CCP build a bot wall and make the bots pay for it pls
---
I think you’re vastly underestimating how complex things like this can be. You can’t just take a huge interconnected code base ecosystem, change things in a weekend, and deploy it on a system that tens of thousands of people are using. Any change, if done properly, takes time to plan out, execute, and test. Granted I know where you’re coming from about things taking way longer to get fixed than is necessary, but a week/weekend is ridiculous. 
---
Sorry, I just get PTSD flashbacks whenever I see someone say something like ‘it’s just software, it’s no big deal, we can fix it in a day.’

You were too slow by 5 hours: https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/db2qju/meanwhile_on_the_forums/

Players don't get feedback on bot reports: players complain on reddit.
---
Players do get feedback on bot reports: Players complain on reddit.
---
Lol. Its actually worse than that. They want to gank people using cloaky ships which you have no detection against and kill you then cloak up again. Their argument for this is that there would be more good fights this way.
---
And ofc, dont forget that they then return to their place of making isk which basically is risk free according to their own CSM member. Ofc, they make shittons more isk there than players in null make. 
---
But we are ruining the game by not accepting these terms.

Currently 3 boxing minor conduits sometimes with a 4th dedicated salvager.
---
1 orca booster w/ 3 mining ships (various skill levels)
---
1 main tank and dps with 2 logi for fighting 10/10 deds unless just 2 or 3 t3 fighters to make it quicker doing null sites.
---
Sometimes paired bomber groups.
---
Sometimes exploration with 1 or 2 recons or t3's as hidden back up cuz I'm not interested in a fair fight exploring, we are strictly competing for resources.
---
Have tried to dual box on roams as either dps or logi but it's hard and I'm not good.
---
Got the gang (4) trained up on PI, in planning stages for making the mats to build trig implants and maybe an advanced material or 2.
---
On occasion just taking my main out on roams or doing abyssals while the other 3 play cards in station.
---
4 subs paid cash, no bots scripts or multi key bindings, no farming isk to pay for subs just doing whatever strikes my fancy atm. Started with 1 like 13 years ago I think and got the 4th just last year.
---
Just sayin', there's a lot you can do.
---
Getting farmed by PL in Catch was shit, it was a shit experience and very unfun. It almost made me quit the game. There is no way to spin it towards "getting hardened", at least not when you were on the receiving end. It was just shit.

---
What do you care? You are a wormholer, and part of the 'community' currently producing 25% of the wealth generated in the game. 
---
I totally understand that botting is an issue, and that it could have negative effects on the in-game economy; however, it is not new to the game, and this did not just happen because people from China switched servers. You can talk all you want about Chinese gaming culture, or what was allowed on Serenity, or just call people dirty Asians, but all of it stinks of racism and Orientalism--again botting and RMT did not just pop into existence because Chinese players came to TQ. 
---
And at the end of the day, Wormholer, besides all of your salt here, how is this *really* affecting you? Other than higher plex prices, which you could mitigate by spending real money, it probably has had zero effect on you at all. 
---
Okay, now down vote r/eve because if there is one thing I know for sure about r/eve its they sure do not like it when people tell them to not be racist.
---
you mean doctrine you yoinked from centi after they mogged you lmao
---
Depends on the need of the fleet. Both are good
---
they actually do undock for the most part. Sometimes it's a blob and other times it's just people looking for some pew pew. and yes i would still care so much for there being bots because the effect they have on the game is far more pronounced that some people would like to admit.
---
October is the deadline for PA deal, no more patches m8, CCP will be restructured after that with Hilmar getting fired/quitting and the staff being slashed yet again... all you'll ever get now is skins, skins, skins...

Thanks for clarifying!

?luckily? i do report bots frequently when i run into them during roams. I also only do so if I'm 100% sure they are bots.
---
xix and friends have been turbobotting in drones for a decade before getting memed out by skillu, and some of them prob were still renting there, a that's one vety well known group. What changed wasn't the bots
---
You're right, but unfortunately the CSM minutes made it clear that CCP's security team knows significantly less about the game and its mechanics than players know.
---
Except that not what happens.
---
Using your analogy, one of two things is what happens.  
---
1) You go to the mechanic and you tell them your timing belt is broken and needs to be replaced.  The Mechanic loots at the car and says no you have a blown radiator.  You still insist the timing belt is whats wrong, and demand it be replaced.  The mechanic does as requested and your car is still broken.  You then blame the mechanic for his sh*tty work and wonder why he never fixed what you told him to.  (This is where CCP has data players don;t, and because of this, the player has no idea WTF they are talking about)
---
2) Your car has a broken engine.  You tell the mechanic you think the engine is broken.  The mechanic agrees and replaces it with a rebuilt engine. (which is all you can afford)  You get pissed because you think your car no longer runs like it used to due to the type of ending installed.  (This is when ccp agrees and changes a feature to something that will fix what the perceived issue is, but on budgets they can handle based on the amount of work that would be needed to replace the whole thing)
---
Sh*t gets fixed.  Just because you personally think its crap, doesn't mean stuff was not fixed.
---
Also using a car analogy to describe a video game and how it works is stupid.
---
In case anyone wonders why blackout didn't work.
---
Can't believe they lost 3 battleships to 60 dudes
---
Kikis die to webs
---
Are you taunting CCP telling them their cyno changes have made it harder for people to offensively move into your space?
---
Yup the problem with super logs lists like that is there is something that appeals to everyone so they ignore the awful suggestions because what they want is also in there.
---
then.. you did your part.
---
Ok no more good fights ) I came for good fights with the motto " I will take any fight" but now we'll see what happens :^) мои друзья
---
I was sharing a perspective.
---
**THIS** is the problem. They're not "fixing" the things the players complain about, they're just breaking them differently.
---
When did they ever "fix" things people complained about? Like name a time the playerbase was complaining about something and CCP just "fixed" it, instead of changing the game in a way that they don't think it'll be a problem anymore.
---
They're attacking the symptoms, not the issues.

Ah forgot to mention the guy with 7 grups of smart bombers(paladin+3 apoc navys combo)im not sure they are bots but somehow this guy  manage all the grups.

&gt; It just feels like that because CCP has deleted every single PVP activity besides hunting ratters

yup. I do so frequently. I also frequently hit the report button.

Yes, you used to be able to move where the tracked target was viewed. Moving anything on the tracking camera is not possible anymore.

Fighters drones and ships can still lock the ship jamming them while they are jammed. This turns ECMing someone into a volevolenteer ntary to be primaried button. Which for the widow and its meek defenses leads to it dying.
---
Whoops. I never actually go over there, so some of this list is me kinda just guessing
---
So this is somehow news? Bots relocated during the BO and then relocated back after it? I mean, can we stop with the narrative of bots leaving instead of real players? Like you guys have pulled this shit for 2 months stating CCP knows the real numbers so the PCU doesnt matter.
---
Guess what, CCP stopped the test. Why did they do that? Hint: Their numbers correlated with the PCU, players stopped playing.
---
At this point I dont really get what you are trying to prove. Like the case is already over, you were wrong then and you are wrong now.

I actually never minded getting a super dropped on me.  It was exciting to see an Aeon or a Nyx and run for life in my destroyers or cruisers.  I've only been on grid with a titan maybe twice and they're a thing to behold.  I figure the few pilots in the region that are ratting or mining should be able to use what they have to defend themselves and their space, and if our wormhole gang of 10 or 20 is too much for five people to fight back and they wanted us out, dropping caps is the answer.  Maybe I'm the minority here but I don't like CCP messing with NS mechanics.  The Ron Swanson part of me doesn't like the government doing much governing. XD

I was killing them and chasing, all those gila's bot were just warping around and logging off if u use combat probes. All full drone fit, no missiles, warping gate to gate.
---
&gt;I understand that botting didn't start then. It was just a lot less prevalent.
---
Jesus fucking christ no it wasn't, botting was widespread in the drone regions and in the south during the heyday of the DRF and Stainwagon/Southern Coalition. When PL kicked SOLAR out of the drones in 2013, large swathes of Solar Citizens offered PayPal payments to hold their systems that many of them had held for years. R.O.L. was filled with RMT and botlords, so was RED and XIX. 
---
What is different **NOW** is that the upper bound of isk that a single character can make is vastly more than it was before. 500m/hr Hel ratting did not exist in 2012, which is why they all used Domis, Ravens, etc., shit that cleared maybe 60-80m/hr at most. Now with Rorqs and Hels and shit, they can bot and rake in billions by the hour across multiple chars as opposed to needing 40 to crack that same amount in c. 2011 cash.
---
Before it was the specter of the Chinese botting, it was Russian/Eastern European. The guys who used their vast sums of wealth to literally buy caps in lowsec in the days of perfect reprocessing, jump stacks of them into the dronelands, and melt them down for parts to build supers. If you think *at present* the botting is any worse than it was back the, your account is not old enough.
---
&gt; faggy kiters
---
What's the reference here?
---
Just because they're bad at it doesn't mean they aren't trying
---
&gt;are back now. Sure there is Bots in Hisec, and yes Abyssals gave Hisec Bots a boost, but all other Hisec botting is much less profitable while it is NOT
---
lol, yes, totally right. Hitting hi-sec moon mining is a giant conspiracy to get ~~you~~, ~~no moon miners~~, EVERYONE to move to Delve. You sure have our number.
---
Test were assisting at the beginning of PL's invasion, I remember us blueballing them until they stopped coming to timers. It was shortly afterwards that the full might of the super fleet arrived (all 11carriers of it)
---
I totally agree this sucks. And also, comming from a forward facing animal with forward facing eyes and forward moving legs I can attest to the fact that a camera that doesn't pan forward during warp is an abomination...
---
I unfortunately wasn't born with a silver spoon in my mouth that allows me to pay for plex. I've only been able to play the game effectively due to plex. It's becoming a constant grind these days to just keep my accounts active.  
---
With regards to the accusations of being racist, its far from that. I don't mind players from serenity coming over. What i do mind is the large trove of botters coming over from serenity. The legit players are welcome anytime.  Sure we had botters prior to that but they were far fewer than they are now and were a tad easier to mitigate and control.
---
The stop playing thing worked pretty well to get CCP to change course on Blackout.
---
nah dawg, blackout was a bad thing and tanked the player count /s
---
Probably because CCP has a habit of making the most low-effort bandaid changes that target symptoms rather than actual well thought out solutions to problems, because that takes work.  That's almost ALWAYS going to end badly, but CCP keeps doing it.
---
We confirmed it through being able to figure out the program's timers to the exact second.
---
I love it!      
---
People cannot leave alt on a WH just to hear if someone jumped in.
---
There's no bonus points for that.
---
so riddle me this. how do other MMOs, lets take WoW for example seem to be doing fine? yes they have "bad" expansions from time to time yet they manage to win back quite a few subscribers with "good" ones every so often. CCPs player stats are on a curve going down since like 2012 with intervals where it either goes down a little slower or faster... the only "spike" upwards is around the time when Omegas and Alphas became a thing, so it's artificially inflated...
---
I would say that the number of bots is a lot less then we want to think it is. Are they affecting our economy? Yeah sure.. but it's not their fault we are not getting any PVP like ur pointing out. There is no longer any reasons for players to attack each other. There is no reason for conflicts or wars. CCP has slowly removed conflict drivers that we had and replaced them with mechanics that don't create reasons for conflicts or fights.
---
is on ur back courtyard...just fucking chines botss all over pb
---
Eve Online Sanderling
---
Pretty much.  For most of the "small gang FPS 360noscope  PVP retards", "Risk" means "I can kill you anytime with very little risk myself".  Then somehow they think targets are actually going to stick around in that environment.

I don't even krab anymore and only ever log in to PVP, even I see how stupid that line of thinking is.
---
if i knew this answer id be CCP Wolf
---
cloaks are for bads and pussies. are you telling me you get farmed by bads and pussies?
---
i know my dude...behind this bots is a cunt from pla,member of distins goonswarm federation...why all cunts criticizing black out was gsf or  a like?look at ishatrs,all are born in same day,same day joined pla alt corp...ccp got hes injectors buyed so ever1 is happy
---
If other corps stay classy i haven't seen it. Only like one corp the grey eagles wasn't absolutely vile in their interactions with me. 
---
And i'm not an elite wh pvper. I'm not very good i whelp a lot. I am terrible at judging my engagement ability against targets. And i get really bored roaming for hours and not seeing a soul. I don't think i could live the "ALL PVP ALL THE TIME" lifestyle.
---
for the PA deal?
---
also true.
---
Lol what? Seriously, stop spreading BS. FRT was never winning this war. They won fights from time to time, but they were always on the losing side of the war. And goons got involved heavily first after Panfam got involved and we were constantly fighting against twice our numbers.
---
In the end, what ended the war was the fact that we onlined a KS in their homeregion and that they declared war on AOM because those guys showed up with heavy doctrines and numbers, far more than goons ever did.
---
I joined brave back in 2013, a week after it was formed. I just don't want to hate it. It makes me sad.
---
You can't consider "3 stat changes every 2 years" to be actual "ship balancing".  That's the problem.  It's just shifting the OP for long periods at a time.
---
Instant gratification over long time rewards. Which is also why bots and skill injectors exist.
---
*Slaps the glorious Serenity server*
---
This baby can fit so much peace and definitely no human rights violations...
---
indeed. /s
---
I see what you did there.. re-stating what the OP said, but with more accurate words!
---
If they are out there i haven't found them. Other corps i've interacted with were absolutely vile in their interactions with others or me.
---
The Eos pilot is the most elite. Everyone else is just elite.
---
wish ccp got the balls to introduce that obesrvatories alowing local in nulll.player gona defend hes shit
---
the bot gona die quietly...every1 gona have hes content
---
reinforce obsevatorie==no local,profit for every1,either loot or pewpew
---
So how people reacted to the presentation? What kind of questions they asked?
---
Just because something can die doesn't mean it's not broken.
---
its like the video and the comment section are engaged in a cringeposting competition
---
The ones which make up the sprinkles on the blue donut, obviously!
---
Nah, it can be simplified further:
---
CCP does anything at all: players complain on reddit.
---
piupiupiupiu
---
no
---
I never asked CCP to go full retard. I asked them to be smart game developers.
---
No, that's just you being a bitter bitch
---
Unfortunately, that's not remotely how EVE is developed.  It's more "OK, so what change can we make with the least effort possible to look like we're actually doing something, without any forethought on long term effects?  Also no testing, ain't got time for that.  These 10 pages of reports from SiSi as to why this sucks?  They don't pay me enough to read these!"
---
As I recall, it had a secondary failsafe as a generated watermark. The wordswap would catch the copy+pasters and the watermark would catch the screenshotters...
---
Pearl Abyss purchase deal with CCP, CCP gets $$$ based on performance (number of subs/players etc). Hence why you had all those free SP months back to back for almost an entire year...
---
shield slave in the summer...of 2029
---
The fact they took the fight so outnumbered is mad respects.  Opinions on Snuff aside
---
I tip my hat to having the balls to actually fight a losing battle.  More balls than 99.9% of r/eve and eve combined
---
there is a fairly broad consensus where it concerns addressing capitals anti subcap powers and nerfing citadel timers and nerfing in particular the smaller variants of citadels.
---
Try goons in 2019, where Aryth complains that he doesn't have anyone to shoot with his supers yet remains NIPPed up with TEST and friends to prevent any real conflict.
---
Just start a war with TEST and maybe you goonies will actually have to fight for survival for once.
---
&gt;e of the real money trading though is nearly impossible to come by unless the involving entities decide to leak it themselves.
---
Liar. You are cloaked in Rens.
---
Icon fixes take away from them cranking out 10 skins a month.  Pretty sure more manhours go into SKINS for one month, than the rest of EVE in one year.
---
EITHER PICK UP A PITCH FORK AND JOIN THE ANGRY MOB OR SHUT UP
---
for real though this is the only logical reply to these illogical whiners
---
It's like the truth. With extra steps...
---
Yup, for shield slaves.  
---
hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha

i lol´d irl. god bless.

For real. 6 months in and Chinese bots already killing TQ. What a shock, who could have seen this coming *oh right literally everybody*
---
confirming ,all bots in period basis are back in business ,goon coffins getting fat
---
He sounds qualified to work at CCP, then.
---
Wow isn't doing fine. The game is suffering really bad and participation is dropping off a cliff and we aren't even into the content drought period. And it's a combination of change for changes sake (they took everything from legion that was good and changed it just enough to break it) and classic fracturing off just enough of the playerbase to collapse social circles.
---
Pick a random test renter there 90% chance there botting.
---
It doesnt provoke anything in me anymore thanks to any and everything being racist now.
---
EVE is one of the few games where OPSEC actually matters
---
posting in an epic gamer thread
---
what?
---
I mean fuck snuff ... but seriously making a reddit post for a fight u win 60:20 🤦‍♂️that’s even worse then being snuff
---
Interestingly those aren't separate events. It's amazing to me that people haven't realized yet that if you ask for panfams help that goons will join the other side so they can come kill them.
---
Dem shield Omen navys...so OP.
---
That's true, same as you and everybody else.
---
Imagine flair baiting in a serious discussion and thinking it gives you the upper hand in arguing.

in max 6 months if the game stay the same ,server gona have 20 k active bots.good luck with that...

They showed up to a few big structure timers, sure. But that stopped pretty early on. There was a Sotiyo timer about a month and change into the thing, the last major fleet Jin'taan FCd for us if I recall, which served as the last time TEST was around as well. We had another timer soon after that we had planned to defend in the same way, but had to forfeit entirely because TEST announced last minute they wouldn't show up anymore and our plans were kind of depending on them being there. They moved the caps they had staged back home following that.
---
That was also roughly at the same time the Provi defense fleets turned from standard warfare to a more guerilla type thing. We retired the Ferox and Abaddon doctrines we had been using and started using Jackdaws and combat ceptor fleets pretty much exclusively. We'd been getting nowhere with head-on conflicts, as we'd just hit a brick wall of T3Cs and FAUXes.
---
&gt; It was shortly afterwards that the full might of the super fleet arrived 
---
There was actually almost a 3 month delay between TEST pulling out of the conflict and them showing up to take the stations. With the exception of a few times they showed up with small subcap fleets, mostly just to whore on things or out of sheer boredom. - The invasion starting around new year, and the outpost removal happening late April (nearly 5 months later), TEST stopped getting involved in early-mid February and then returned mid April to grab the outposts.
---
SILVER SPOON IN YOUR MOUTH FOR $0.50 a day my god you stuck up whiney bitch.  You’re on the internet on your personal pc and want to play that card as if two fucking quarters a day is unreasonable gtfo and let the door hit your never spanked ass on the way out
---
You’re looking for a reason to cry over nothing because you can’t handle your emotions.  That’s fucking sad
---
Stop it and get some help
---
Wait the station view is gone too??
---
Uninstalling, as I type..... How could they do this..
---
biggest joke is adding notifications in the log for gatefires etc
---
Nullseccers hate people who fly fast, evasive ships reliant on not getting hit ('kiters'). And if you know what you're doing you can make a Sleipnir go pretty damn fast.
---
&gt;some cheap skins
---
I call bullshit.
---
They could start by having anti cheat software in the client. Or software looking for memory injections. Hmm.
---
prop to them taking the fight...
---
Only to "return for a LIMITED LIMITED TIME FOR 20% OFF!" in 2 months.
---
&gt;BH i could say "it does in totalitarian China" but for sure someone will jump out out of the bushes and start to call me racist so i will just stay quiet.
---
I am fine as long as you don't call it Communist China. It should really be "Totalitarian Capitalist Country With Marxist Slogans."
---
imagine still playing eve with your hands
---
You guys shit on us for not fighting you after we were already leaving because we had no logi left after sparring with FE, even though you refused to fight us on even numbers before then.
---
Don't complain about the same smack you literally dish out yourselves
---
Agreed
---
if i were american or european it wouldn't have been a problem. The exchange rate kinda fucks me over hard.
---
I know the whole kitey meta thing and people whining about it in general, but that phrase has been used several times in this thread almost like it's a quote from Dunk or something similar, that's why I was asking.
---
Which is yet again why we argued against it. Its only the morons that keep arguing for these changes because they dont understand what will actually come of it. This change nerfed the umbrella in a aspect but it also effectively removed the threat of others. The sum of this is just more boring shi and moving caps hell of a lot worse, especially in LS.
---
No one's pretending that China is the only country that steals. Just that they're doing it the most by a large margin compared to the rest of the industrialized world.
---
I guess China can do whatever the fuck they want because people like you will always defend them by pointing out past Western atrocities. Muslims in concentration camps? BUT MURRICA! BUT THE HOLOCAUST!
---
Also good to try both. Learn different flying skills.
---
As someone who \*has\* been around for a long time and remembers what it was like...it's way better now than it was before. Maybe it's because I was younger and I loved just getting into fights and losing most of my income in the process, but now I like to be able to relax and have spare money and ships so that if something happens I can get back into the fight or move on with my day without worrying.
---
It's okay you look like skull of pig already xaxaxa
---
WoW is a pve game, not a hardcore pvp-centric game. Its playerbase, while small compared to what it was at its peak, is still orders of magnitude largers than EVEs.
---
For example. Most wow players dont give a damn about mythic raiding. Even fewer care about the world first race at the beginning of each new raid tier.  And Method still hit 140k viewers on its world first EP mythic livestream. Only a very small percentage of WoWs players pvp and it still gets 30-40k viewers for the arena tourneys.
---
EVE, with its massive learning curve, its pvp focus, and its long-term return on time invested quite literally has no future in in the modern world of bite sized, easy access content and convenience features.  Even WoW has had to adapt and assume a seasonal cycle. In wow, people resub in droves to play new patch ***PVE*** content, then unsub until next patch. Eve not only has terrible pve to start with, but when is the last time anyone was genuinely excited about new pve features in EVE? The last pve feature they added was trigs, and they have been broken in one way or another from day one. Currently, they are camping newby systems and obliterating the very new players that CCP has been trying so hard to coddle.
---
While the elite-pvp nerds will screech, the only thing that will save EVE is compelling pve content. This is what keeps subs paid and pcu padded.
---
Its what eve completely lacks.  Its what eve desperately needs.  And its what CCP is fucking terrible at making.
---
Didn't WC have Panfam at their disposal?  You know PL , NC , Horde , Tri , Slyce and other assorted alliances.  Panfam also had GOTG till in the dumbest of dumbest moods reset them.  You know an AU/TZ force that could've added much strength to WC's dominant TZ. Panfam and WC make horrible strategic choices and then cry about the consequences.  Being tactically good doesnt amount for shit in a strategic war.  The sooner WC and Panfam figure that out the better.  I argued for that point for a long time whilst in panfam , so much so that my friends came to resent me for rubbing there noses in the shit they left on the floor over the years.  In the end I had to come to the realization that they didn't want to change or improve. It is like your alchohalic family member you can try to intervene for their benefit.  You can try to get them help or take them to meetings. However until they want to quit all your efforts are nigh.
---
Simple fix:
---
Okay, sorry, not a fix.... but an interesting idea regardless. 
---
What if CCP made isk a finite currency? ALL faucets MUST be tied to a sink. Not enough sink to compensate for the faucet activities? Faucet rewards are dynamically lowered until it balances out. 
---
On the one hand this would fix isk devaluation. 
---
On the other hand, it’s not a perfect way to suffocate bots. Since bots are more efficient than humans, then either the bots will drive out human competition in each class of activity (very bad), or bots will have to give up on lower payout areas and switch to more-difficult-for-bot activities. 
---
Another wild but probably stupid idea, is to flip the isk faucets and sinks on their heads. Make PVP more profitable, even more than PVE.
---
My favorite one is the people who think that eliminating drone auto-aggression will somehow stem the tide of botting. These players have to be very new. If they weren't, they would have lived through 2010 and 2011, where belts were bubble-fucked to oblivion and scoured by nullified tengu bots, spewing misl at rats instead of using drones.
---
Eliminating drone auto aggression is a fine thing to support and has plenty of legitimate arguments for it, but bots are not one of them.
---
It's pretty shit tbh.
---
That IS kind of nuts!
---
coincidentally wasn't that right about when Kinera left for TEST and you guys detached?
---
lol, really?  Who?
---
TFW in EVE 2019 you can literally use real money to buy corporations as a pet project.
---
But it took a whole few months before they started pushing towards Serenity 2, they really is are haz changed?!!/11/111!!!!!   ...at least that's what everyone told me when the same alliances that killed Serenity moved over here.
---
I mean its like one of the dumbest things I have ever seen in a game. And considering the info we are getting regarding how WHs actually work its such a fking joke that these cunts are even talking.
---
Reddit recently updated their anti bully stuff. (https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/dbf9nj/changes_to_our_policy_against_bullying_and/). We now autoremove nono words. Thanks
---
Or a Vigil when your flying with arty fleet. That's what I use to fly back when Canes where a front line doctrine for us/before I fell in love with flying logi.
---
That said trying a mix of everything is good, you find what you like and don't like.
---
It is literally the same people doing the same thing.  The fact that so many people swore this wouldn't happen when they moved over still confuses the fuck out of me.  As said before; people don't change much.  They're going to do the exact same thing they did on Serenity, and in a mere few months they're already pushing hard in that direction armed with their RL wallets.
---
I guess CCP decided they needed the bot players as much or more than the live ones. Whatever pays the bills.
---
Ye I mean, idk why I even bother at times. Think I would have more succes with flat-earthers than these people.
---
They are very very much pre-arranged. There's several FC discord channels where everything's planned out. It can be as planned as both FCs want (Some are like "Hey @Brave we are coming to GE- others are Hey @SpecificFC lets fight in T1 cruisers and down in HED-GP Planet 1).
---
based on what some of the people I know down that way, TRC isn't so much at 'war'  with CVA as they are 'farming' CVA.
---
This is fresh and original.
---
Silver spoon in your mouth? So, fine if you are living in the developing world, I will cut you some slack with that comment, since to you everyone born in the 1st world is probably born with a "silver spoon" in their mouth; however, if live in the first world let me be the first to tell you paying for Omega $15 a month (if you pay monthly).
---
You do not need to be born with a "silver spoon in your mouth" to afford to pay this; in fact, prior to the introduction of plex it was a pain in the ass to buy game time with isk on the forums, and I would guess 90% of the people who played the game paid that $15 a month. 
---
In any case, if you live in a first world country and really truly cannot afford $15 a month to play eve you are probably doing it (life) wrong.
---
It's pre-arranged, through a few FC discord channels.
---
CCP gives 0 shits about EVE, this has been apparent for a while.  The second they started implementing obviously broken shit to inflate numbers for a buyout is when it's official they stopped caring.
---
Perfect. Who knew it was such an easy fix to eliminate botting. Perhaps you should put in an application, you seem to have come up with the answer to a decade old problem.
---
Cloaky camp and blops drop on them to lower adms, it works on real people too!
---
Bot accounts still bring in dollars.     
---
That's the bottom line.
---
If you have a way to straight up disallow VPN connections to various services that doesn't involve exhaustively cataloguing known VPN hosts, then you could probably name your price at any number of companies. Or governments.
---
Developing country unfortunately. Though calling it "developing" is optimistic.
---
Anything for Galente?
---
Talk about having false ideas stuck in your head. XD
---
I thought it was amusing that CCP stated that the amount of casual farming in null greatly exceed what they expected to see during the blackout. It really wasn't much of a surprise to anyone else.
---
If your looking for the largest consistent numbers of player ships destroyed, look no further than high sec. Crushing null numbers on a daily basis.
---
The reason for this imbalance is actually that high, low and null sec spaces are kind of broken. Alliances have completely broken null though. That's not entirely CCP's fault. The blackout was a step in the right direction but CCP wasn't prepared to have such a massive number of botters and casual farmers log off in null. That scenario could only come about within the massive safe zones created by the alliances.
---
interesting. elite dangerous recently had a bug that broke VPN connections.
---
has parrotos and a sun emote?
---
yep, that'd be a brave post alright.
---
What?! God you lot are such pansies sometimes...those sleips are prolly a bil each and raxes are practically free, how is this even a choice? I'd whelp this fleet just for 1...I'd be pumped if we got 3! ...sigh. You've got to get into the whole "being immortal" thing, dying just mean you lost, it just means you haven't won yet!  :D
---
The cycle of life.
---
If you listen closely, you can hear the point barrel being thoroughly scraped.
---
What you are doing is extending my argument to ridiculous proportions and imputing wrong conclusions to me. I don't see where I defended China or anything that they do. (Although you could say that I argued that China can justify its conduct by pointing to similar if not worse conduct by the West.) I pointed out double standards and an extension of the norms set by the West. That is not the same as defending China, is it? 
---
&lt;Just that they're doing it the most by a large margin compared to the rest of the industrialized world.&gt;&gt;&gt;That is both false and funny. I doubt what China is doing reaches the extent of the theft and looting perpetrated by Britain, America, Belgium, France, etc. Just because they are not doing it as much as it is doesn't mean they are innocent of that conduct. There is history and you will not erase it.
---
Wait what’d i say
---
What the fuck?
---
Oh yeah. I forgot about that. Quite right.
---
Your comment was removed by AutoMod, did you by chance say SkillU's full name or something?
---
Whataboutism is defense by deferral.
---
&gt;Just because they are not doing it as much

Thanks for agreeing.

Not a huge EVE Redditor but when I see bots and call them bots, it's usually when I see 40 of the same ship warp to the same structure and redock at the same time. Then if I leave system, and come back, they do the same thing on a predictable pattern. The myrm/Ishtar bots are frankly hard for me to tell because sometimes they don't warp off until I hit the grid, which to me is healthy player behavior.
---
But then you bring another 20 and now there's only 7 of them. ;)
---
I don't even recognize this community anymore.  So effin sad.
---
stop projecting
---
depends on what winning is for you.  winning for me is more activity of any kind in WH space in any type of space C1-C6, dont care, i shoot anyone not purple.  some items that jumped out at me:
---
1.  thinking goons will go after bombers bar and evicting them from their C2 is ludicrous and shows the level of understanding goons leadership actually has (cause you know, you can form in Thera or Jita/Amarr and just scan holes?...). 
---
2.  Having more players talking or even engaging in WH antics is great. it means Kspace engagement is down and since everyone is blue to each other, have to find somewhere else to go pew pew.  will be fun to see more ships sitting in space where a WH used to be and likely asking who brought probes, what's a rollout kit?...
---
3.  do I make isk in more safety in WH space than I did in NS? I'd argue no considering I have holes popping up anytime, I'm sieged, I can't see local (Dscan if the sig happens to be within 14.3au), and I can't have an Ibis sitting Xkm off a gate that doesn't exist until just now, I don't have an alarm going off from 5 jumps away telling me of a neutral in our space.  Can I roll off my static &amp; rat for a few hours, sure and CCP is addressing that, at least from what I understand.  I cannot however, thanks to my ADM and upgrades in NS, warp to continuous sites (like Sanctums) 23hrs/7days a week.
---
all in all, I'm all for Goons doing whatever the fk goons wants to do.  Bring on the noise, let's get it started and hope you find our jsig.  So what if we get evicted, we find another WH and we do it again cause shit is meant to @ssplode.
---
The will fight the NPC Menace.  RMTqueen of the North needs a return on that investment.

there are other avenues to push the "china man bad" narrative
---
I briefly looked at that, and couldn't find any details other than "doesn't work via VPN." Their issue tracker didn't have any details other than the initial report. I don't know if it was because of it being a VPN, or if something like a huge MTU size was causing an issue, or what. It's also possible that a particular VPN host was being used as a middleman for a cracker or a (D)DoS and had to be blocked temporarily, hamstringing legitimate users.

---
Ok after thinking about this, i can actually answer:
---
WoW is a Theme Park
---
EvE is a sandbox.
---
There...  oh you want more?  ok..
---
WoW is equivalent to Disneyland.  You go there knowing what to expect.  You will get there, ride a simple ride (level up) ride another (lvl up) etc.  Work your way to be able to ride the biggest best ride of them all.  Then after you rode it.. you do it again... and again.. and again.  Nothing you do in WoW matters.  not a damn thing.  Space Mountain will always be Space mountain.  I can memorize the soundtrack, the intro video's know all the twist and turns by heart.  But it doesn't matter what i do, it will play out the same way every damn time.  Sure i could have the ride 404 (i lost) but it will ALWAYS play out the same.  Occasionally Disney (Blizzard) will change it up a bit, but Space Mountain Ghost Galaxy is STILL space mountain.  ALWAYS.   If you live in so cal and get an annual passport, after you have ridden everything 10000000 times, eaten all the food, seen all the shows (which don;t change no matter what you do) you will go, 'Hey this new place, Magic Mountain just opened, i'll check that out" and leave Disneyland for a bit.  Until Disney opens a new ride, then you come back and ride it a million times until you are bored.
---
Because of this, WoW updates are easy.  They know the exact outcome of everything.  They know how we will use it, how it will play out.  We have no free choice, you have to do the rides, you can do them in any order, but you MUST do the rides.
---
EvE is the equivalent of the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk.  You can go ride the rides in any order you want (high sec missions) and no matter what you do, they will remain the same.  You can go shopping.. but you can also open your own shop there.  You can stand outside a shop and try to double peoples money.  You can wonder the boardwalk for hours and do all this.  Which is easy to update and fix.  But... you also have a whole beach to deal with.  I could decide today i rode the Big Dipper 10000000 times and i'm tired of the same thing.  I see that group of guys on the beach playing volleyball, i'm gonna go see if i can join them.  Or i want to go swimming, or i want to build a sand castle, or i want to destroy all peoples sand castles.  You can play eve almost anyway you want.  This makes it hard to update eve.  As they say build a new ride, the guys on beach will scream 'my shovel is broken!' 'the sand is too rocky my castle is not as strong..' 'my bat is not breaking things fast enough!'  etc.  CCP has to balance this, the issue is, if they give a guy in the sand a new shovel that can dig up more sand then the old one did and  faster, they might see that shovel trying to dig up the boards in the board walk.
---
The point is, players in eve are unpredictable, and we don;t follow the rules.  This makes changing things really hard in eve.  As you may make one group or one guy happy, but piss off everyone else.  A guy who used to ride the rides in swim trunks now can;t could be a huge problem.,  but in WoW no one cares cause they all are the same.
---
Making new stuff is hard, as we don;t see the big picture and don;t know whats going on in the water vs the board walk, but ccp does.  Thats why making eve better is hard.  no one knows what will do it.  And when ccp try, people complain loudly, especially for the ceo who has zero to do with eve development to be fired.  
---
EvE players are the most hardcore babies in gaming.  And eve is a monster to develop.  WoW is peanuts compared to the crap we put ccp through.
---
This is a treasure I love you &lt;3
---
Okay, then consider slack cut for the silver spoon comment. Typically the people who complain about the cost of things like plex are Americans or Europeans with 100 accounts and it irritates the hell out of me. 
---
The eve players from the developing world do have a right to complain about how much shit costs--and not just how much shit related to eve costs.
---
You’re using a very narrow definition of a win condition. We’d take that fight every time and our win condition would be more isk killed than lost, our fun condition would be taking the fight in the first place, and just seeing how far we get. If you’re in that much cheaper ships, any kill is a victory worth celebrating.
---
If the entire fleet died and the enemy is still in your home being disruptive that means you lost. Being isk positive is little comfort when the enemy is still here and your only choice is log off or throw away more ships to entertain them. That is the point dunk is making. From a defensive point of view, being isk positive is meaningless if you still lost.
---
If only people started blowing stuff up instead of hording it
---
You mean the collection of alliances that add up to about half what goons + TAPI does?  Lmao.
---
BTW, did you finish yet or do you need to keep jerking it to your self-important prescience?
---
Also, WoW and other mmo's are struggling, but as most of them are bigger, and they have multiple servers, and you actions do not matter, then player counts means nothing.  Wow can lose 5M players of there (last i heard) 12M and be ok.  they can turn off servers and stretch this out until they make new stuff.
---
EvE can not.  Eve has maybe 1m people playing, and dips are notched because we are a weird lot that analazies every bit of data ccp puts out.
---
&gt; Am I just not seeing news/blogs from CCP in the midst of all the REE here?
---
It’s been quiet, but part of that is because EVE Vegas is coming up and that’s their big day to reveal anything they’re working on (or lack thereof). Same thing usually happens around fanfest too.
---
When you say 500m/hr hel ratting I hope you mean old numbers, only way to get close to that is be ungodly lucky with shiny spawns, without that you make ~300 tops
---
like this is client modification and this never comes alone.
---
As much as watching snuff eat a bag of dicks.... You did kinda blob them
---
That actually makes the most sense from any other sarcastic shit people have been posting. Appreciate it. 
---
You're probably exactly right though. I bet there will be decent hints at what to expect over the next few months after that event.
---
Anti-cheat software is always some of shady shit. CCP spying on people isn't the solution.
---
I/m also just goring to toss this out here unlinked.
---
There are two reasons why we will never see an eve classic.
---
1) EvE caster was so broken its not even funny.  Anyone who is looking back at eve when it first came out and going 'yea lets do that again' and a bit delusional.  It was frustrating as hell and had lots of broken issues.  was fun.. but lord was it a pita.
---
2) it will fracture eve player base to much to make it worth it.
---
how do you do fellow eve online players
---
Even that is still far and away more than what any individual char could generate on their own before 3 years ago. Skynet carrier ratting wasn't even that profitable unless you invested **A LOT** into the super itself.
---
Great but that's not dunks win condition, and that doesn't make his or yours wrong.
---
Managing that is really easy, all the smartbombers (apoc navy) are cap stable so he just warps in,has all the sb ships approach the ‘lead’ and tab through hitting F1-8 on all 3 then just shoot anything out of range with the paladin (I run a similar setup with 3 Machs and a nightmare)
---
Tethering should be on every station, only last for about 30 seconds on undock to account for load times.  
---
Otherwise if it's in space we're supposed to be able to shoot it.
---
Implying Eve is a PvP game these days
---
I was responding to your insanely narrow definition of fun in the preceding comment. The point is, throwing 20 thoraxes into a sleip grinder with some hope of bloodying their nose can easily be framed as a fun and rewarding thing, just as Dunk frames it as a loss/undesirable thing.
---
WoW and EvE are entirely different animals.  
---
WoW is not a competitive game for the most part, and the few parts that are competitive start with everyone on the same baseline.  There are also hard constraints on what you can and can't do in WoW.  In short, everything is scripted and the players have very little agency.  
---
WoW can also effectively reset it's balance/meta with every patch it puts out (and they often did through sweeping changes, not all of them good).  Whent hey do this it impacts everyone equally.   Everyone starts each new tier at effectively the same place.  This is because nothing has any lasting impact WoW can screw up, and no one ever 'looses', what you have is around forever.  
---
In EvE, there is no baseline to reset to. Players have agency over every part of the game from the economy, to territory, to resource generation.  EvE doesn't get the benefit of being able to reset everyone.  Meddling with the game balance, even breaking a part of it, has long reaching, and long lasting repercussions.   Everything can be lost except your character itself.    
---
This difference is both EvE's biggest draw and it's largest hindrance.   Another reason for player 'bounciness' is that in WoW you can skip an expansion.  In fact your entire guild can.  Come back when the weather is better and you're golden.   In EvE, your alliance takes a 'patch cycle' off, you can write off almost everything your alliance has worked for.
---
\&gt; That is both false and funny. I doubt what China is doing reaches the  extent of the theft and looting perpetrated by Britain, America,  Belgium, France, etc.
---
China systemically literally steals organs from entire demographs of people. To excuse their ongoing barbaric human rights abuses because of Colonialism from hundreds of years ago is just about the worst case of whataboutism I've ever seen.
---
Laughs in insta safe pos
---
It was very positively received- it helped that there were a few players in the audience! And they all got a pretty good laugh, hearing about how much trouble I had in the tutorial. 
---
Regretfully, I didn't end up having time for questions at the end (poor time management on my part).
---
You raise a very good point in the context of empire building, however it does not apply in the context of people who are just trying to play a game without others ruining it.
---
Odds are bots will just push real pilots out
---
They sounds like a plague who killed their host and are now looking for a new host.
---
"Capital Proliferation was predictable since the skill requirement nerf of 2011"
---
Earlier then that actually.  Proliferation started with the disaster that was Capital Sov and the pos being 100% indestructible in a capital system if you had 3 stations and owned 51% of the systems int he constellation.  BoB and some of the large alliances took advantage of this like crazy.  That is where proliferation started ramping up.  it just increased after that.
---
I agree, i have never been a large corp, and was only in ASCN for like a year, but CCP shout toss out the T20 rule and just have IA moniter there people and let them play.  This would give them a much better picture as to pain points.
---
Hell, PI was not adjusted until Hilmar tried to set up colonies and then went WTF is this crap?
---
Yeah, I see 8-12 on fresh sites. Never as low as 3-5, not on pirate sites in wh space. Can't comment about what it was like years ago.
---
Can someone explain what's going on for those of that have been out of the game for a few years?
---
I mean as much as bots are fucking it up ccp fucked it up more.
---
Real players aren't logging in as much, fix that
---
That must be recent. 2017 had 3-5 cans per site.
---
hey mr can't read my own post, check jester's number for average players.
---
Basically Exooki mentioned a bunch of stuff we want fixed (we being *most* wormholers) and these lovely smoothbrains insist that means we're all enjoying exploiting these things.
---
This probably explains the confusion.
---
"The right way" though... thats the issue.  Your right way, my right way, and ccp's based on what they know they can do, and what data they have that we don't, are not always the same.
---
Well the confusion still stands because even as far back as maybe 2016 people were hocking the 100m/hr exploration mantra, of which I still was absolutely confused about.
---
WoW has very well defined roles for its players, each having a specific "best" style of play and a uniform way of measuring success for each class. In Eve, there are no such things. Each person decides their style of play and what they deem to be successful in that style. PVPers measure success with a killboard that PVEers don't give 2 cents about. With that in mind, what makes the game better or worse is also an individual opinion. Anything that makes my play style easier is sure to really suck for you. That is the tightrope CCP has to walk. Their challenge is to maintain a game where 10,000 different people can play 100 different ways and feel the game is balanced as they work towards 1000 different ideas of success.
---
From the CSM14 minutes:
---
"CCP Burger kicks things off with a PowerPointand a round of introductions for the CSM and CCPers. This was a presentation that was shown to the company a few days earlier. The focus of the team into winter (2019) is split into 80% early retention and 20% veteran stagnation. The latter will also tackle the economy."
---
So only 20% of CCP work on "veteran gameplay" for the rest of the year. Dont expect much, citadels/sov/capitals/resources generation systems/etc will probably mostly stay as they are for the forseeable future...
---
For us our responses got better since leadership mandates that for Esoteria to be green there has to be a bridge titan undocked with at least 3 recons on it for response. No more "can I get an f-ing bridge titan? No? then carriers and supers jump" now its often bridging a response dessi fleet in with recons.
---
&gt;  Safe'ing up in a JB POS often turned out to be a bad choice due to the standard password each alliance had.
---
Countless supers died trying to hide in a 420 POS.
---
There are some points talking about a Gallente capsulear.  As well as a spicy sex scene
---
Not a common occurrence. Some random butthurt feminist is not usable as evidence.
---
Hunting the hunters is extremely fun :p
---
I wasn't around then, but I get sites on regular basis and can record their contents for you if you want. It's almost certainly the best way for new players to make Idk/learn the game unsupported right now.
---
If it's not racist, it's sexist; if neither mix of those apply it's whatever phobic...  People be bitches these days.
---
It wasn't. But feminists will use every opportunity to victimise themselves.

Sorry but this book has been a part of my life for sometime.  I wish I was able to keep it in better conditions.

No, but Chinese are very racist.
---
Shut up, China.
---
You may need to open a window because all that smarm might suffocate you.  Like no one knows this stuff.
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee wouldn’t know I’m not a scrub reeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Yep. 
---
And like another poster said, before alpha clones and injectors, EVE wasn’t like this. Of course botting existed before, that much is obvious, but it was mostly just Russians farming compounds in the drone regions. Now it’s everywhere and unstoppable because of the disposable nature of accounts. 
---
I bitch because I care.
---
We self destructed a bunch of capitals we couldn't otherwise get rid of from our wormhole.
---
I dunno man, not sure if that sounds as fun as grinding the world's most repetitive pve and then sleeping atop my hoard like Smaug. Wouldn't it ruin my life if some of my hard earned space pixels exploded?
---
I think its time to rename eve online to WOW, ohhh wait i think that name is already taken :)
---
My argument went over your head and that is okay. 
---
I am assuming that you are American? Shouldn't you be caring more about what your government does? You can start here: https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2019/country-chapters/united-states
---
Trust me, when my [British] government behaves badly I make sure to hold it to account.
---
It was in response to someone who used hell dunks or blue balls to define it.
---
Maybe in neutral space that fight might be fun for dunk, but in his home system a he ends up doing is losing the fight, and the enemy is still in his home being disruptive. The added bonus against him is they probably don't care about the few slep loses and will come to enjoy dunk feeding them, there by causing dunk to continue doing unfun things.
---
The point being framing what dunk said as some horrible attitude is stupid and should understand people play different ways.
---
And BOB?
---
We roamed to panfam space in nano shit a week or 2 ago and got incessantly dropped on by supers.  There's nothing like getting raped by supers and then thanked in local for bringing content and encouraged to "come back more often".   
---
I logged off in the middle of space and haven't logged back in since.  I don't think I ever will :).  Unpopular opinion: most of the players that remain in the game deserve the boredom they've worked so hard for.
---
Anti cheat software frequently causes headaches for legitimate users who fully meet all required specs.  It would certainly kill off all users of Linux and MacOS; Eve has quite a few of them.
---
Look at ZKill, StainGuy. Nothing but PIBC Dominix losses from *REAL PEOPLE*. 
---
Period Basis is basically a bot haven.
---
Sadly we are not elite anymore, our list of blue is only WANGS...leadership needs to step up and get on Vilys level.

there was a thread about that already last week, its in discussion to make a summay at least... got also 40ish mails today lol

Lol check out this guys post history. Im pretty sure theres a different reason he doesnt like the word racist.
---
We just have to wait and see I'm afraid. Until now we haven't gotten blessings or curses from BOB that would relate to our sacrifice.
---
If they don't make a BIG announcement in Vegas I think a lot of people (myself included) will just stop investing time in EVE (if they haven't already done so).
---
l u l
---
How many Brave atrons died to bring us this information?
---
this is being worked on/looked at.
---
CHAOS...
---
Some players think that Bob is god of wormholes..
---
You tend to learn a lot of things when you do a degree in history, politics and economics.
---
How many times have you seen of PanFam come down other then PL, like you could probably count on 3 fingers how many times NC. and Horde came down.
---
At no point was Panfam part of the war other then PL.
---
They have a dedicated krabbing region dude... what’s the point in having the other one if you aren’t gonna use it for content?
---
&gt; My argument went over your head and that is okay. 
---
No it did not, and now you are intentionally insulting my intelligence and that is **not** okay.
---
I pointed out that you are comparing modern human rights abuses by China to historical human rights abuses by other countries. I also brought up the fact that *even if you do this*, modern human rights abuses by China still far outweigh what was done historically.
---
**You did not address this argument,** and instead continue to use whataboutism to shift the argument away from China and onto other countries. In fact, that is how this whole thing started: you shifted the conversation away from China and onto other countries. Now you are shifting the conversation away from China's system organ harvesting and onto America's deportation of illegal immigrants, as though the two human rights abuses are even comparable. You might as well try and compare Tienanmen Square or the Hong Kong Riots to the *Million Man March.*
---
&gt; Trust me, when my [British] government behaves badly I make sure to hold it to account.
---
Your comments in this thread make you look like a Chinese state-paid Social Media shill. I realize that's not what you are, and so maybe you should take a step back and re-analyze your position.
---
Greetings, you seem to have just found the internet today. Welcome.
---
You seem to be ignoring that BRAVE doesn't own the entirety of Impass, we only own 1 pocket the rest is REQ, there are plenty of people who choose to krab in Catch and they are mostly subcap ratters and they are also the same people who are largely PVP in Catch.
---
This isn't really true though right. A small subcap fleet can have a counter escalation ready with a cloaked recon on grid.
---
Good for you
---
People who say “things aren’t different now” and “bots have always existed” forget that back in the day, China wasn’t a huge presence on our server. Skill injectors and Alpha VPN farms didn’t exist. So yes, it’s more common now. And yes, it’s destroying the game by making ISK worthless.
---
Those are the two major things that changed between then and now and it kicked off a cheating wave. Before, the Russians were content to quietly farm compounds in the drone regions. China does this on a whole other level and in every region they occupy. 
---
Before I hurt someone’s feelings, I’m not saying that *only* Chinese players bot - just that a huge number of them do, and that it’s impacting honest players.
---
100% agree
---
when I started playing eve (right before "this is eve") the big draw to me was how easy it was to get swept up in the politics, wars, enemies, and metagame. I loved it and it all felt so important. I remember watching muted streams of battles and cheering on my group at work like it was sports when I couldn't log in because it *was* so important to me at the time.
---
Over the years that part of the game was stripped away for me little by little as I progressed further towards bittervet. these days it is unironically just about the zkill for me and that is fine too, just not nearly as unique feeling as it once was.
---
Yea that shit is cancer. But then when capital projection gets nerfed everyone REEEEEE's in unison even though it pushes new and old players alike away from the game.
---
Has that not been fixed yet?
---
it's funny, i got a lot of downvotes the other day for pointing out how useless this automated message was going to be.
---
interesting to see i, predictably, wasn't the only one who saw it as a useless waste of time.
---
I could probably record myself too, showing my perspective. But people don't want that because "I dont want to watch you being bad at the game"
---
This strangely sounds like you want to be right, to be right. Despite the fact that I have seen dozens of groups after black out come down our pipe and not a single one had a recon in tow, secretly waiting to spring a trap- it is indeed possible. So, despite all of my personal experience that is helping to formulate my opinion I will accept that my own experiences are probably incorrect and I should go with third-hand theoretical. Sorry about that.
---
I really wonder if CCP actually thinks.  What did they think would happen with the same people that fucked up Serentity
---
But he’s not wrong
---
CCP during the years have invested a lot of time and money in projects that never saw the light and they had just to close them down. Maybe its time for them to create a new eden for those that  appreciate a good roam where your skills and fleet composition actually matters and not n+1, a server that is more limited to what you can do as a corp/alliance. 
---
This server would not be as big as the current server but enough so alliances can get small areas they can control which would end in more smaller alliances controlling smaller areas and it would generate more conflicts.
---
Bluing people would not be a problem since it would be people interested in pvp and not forming coalitions, for that we already have a great server.
---
Then players would simple log into the server that matches their interest and everyone would be happy, those that love to rorq mine 24/7 to build supers and titans and then brag how good they are and those that just like a good brawl and wants to keep their game much simpler and lets demanding.
---
Not my problem. That's up to CCP to get it refined. But then again I sont expect much from CCP
---
Eve is nowhere close to 1m individuals playing these days.
---
How about after 3 reports you are banned for 3 days while they review your files. Of course the reports are from your peers.
---
Hey Brave we are coming doesnt sound consensual at all.
---
Here I share some examples of objectively bad behaviour and you respond with her being a butthurt faminist. I don't have statistics sure but I'm pretty sure you're part of the problem
---
I have. It took me all of 10 minutes of research to figure out how to do it. Then again I am a genius.
---
We don;t know for sure either way.  As we have no idea how many accounts just sit there.. but you are prolly right, eve is most likely closer to 350k
---
Eve is dying this time for more reasons than bots. The player base is tired of undelivered promises, backing out of decisions, and refusing to address the actual issues with the game in favor of more skin and injector sales.
---
Is it wrong? Imagine telling the industrial barons of yesteryear a similar story. 
---
“Well you fat fucks have too much money and it’s not fair for the rest of us. So were gonna roll the world back. You must give up your railroads and Model Ts. You must go back to using buggies and horses.” 
---
You would be fucking laughed at. Same goes for here and now. It’s like a bunch of kids whining to mom about how brother has more candy than you.
---
Oh even less these days dude. Its probably 350k accounts but 100k actual players. Each with 5 injector farming toons and rorqual alts.
---
I have no problem hearing the hole flashes.
---
Exactly correct! Can't agree more! You really understand China!
---
This is so cute!
---
Nobody in EVE was ever elite, anybody saying that about somebody is usually braying because a slightly more organized group out thought them, something a rock can often manage.
---
"The Expanse" is, at the very least, helping fill my insatiable Firefly void.
---
fuck me I just upvoted an EliseRandolph post :/
---
So hold up. A smug post about a flaunted win, with 3:1 numbers, and a structure on your side? Props to Snuff for taking that fight.
---
I'm not saying we have lots of time during multi hour mission analysis briefs to think about other things, but my notebook says otherwise.
---
Lol I started to lose that spark when PL was farming HERO for content and by late 2015 it was gone for me. Took me til 2016 to actually unsub though
---
Honestly at this point I feel like CCP should just start a EVE 2. Start over completely. Keep original EVE going but announce a new direction. And not held back by old code.
---
And if they don't stop them in GE they will proceed to the krab area. I'm saying if dunk were to run into that situation in say wicked creek it would be a different story.
---
Good thing bots and not denieing all content with big blocs is killing the game....
---
You clearly haven’t put much effort into it. Brave is far from what I would call “classy” these days and there are many, many groups out there that are way less toxic and far more enjoyable to be a part of. Give somewhere else a try. Game’s finally dying, don’t look back with regrets.

that's the name the previous owner had given it before i stole it from them, back when safaris were a thing before ccp decided that you weren't supposed to have fun in high sec.

There would be a good sink but it seems nobody likes it. It's called pvp.
---
Should prob be rolled back/tested on SISI if it is a bug... That is why I think this is working as intended.

Please tell me it is fixed, someone please
---
Same old kid with guns argument. Kid with guns was immediately purged by vily as soon as proof was made that they were botting. Also they were never affiliated with legacy whatsoever and ended up being replaced by a newbro independent alliance.
---
Blackout's over, hunting ratters is back to being deleted again also.
---
"Got called a botter for playing 23-7 for weeks on end without any breaks, while always having perfect timing, on alignment or mining lasers, at any time of day or night?" Pretty sure you're a botter.

Did you ignore the first part or just have trouble understanding?

&gt; Here I share some examples of objectively bad behaviour and you respond with her being a butthurt faminis

Because she is? You can **ALWAYS** find bad behaviour, that's just how the internet works. Your post proves absolutely nothing, in fact **you're** probably a butthurt feminist.

Cheap username checks out. Classic jealousy directed at people actually using their space to the benefit of everyone in the game.

not sure what is so funny Sev3rance is ranked 44, CVA is 18 waffles are only a few slots higher then -7- at 39 literally in the top 50 pvp alliances in the game. I don't think its as bad as you might think. as far as I can tell the provi block is factualy pretty darn good.
---
He was joking.
---
I mean just go through NPC Fountain, you'll see plenty of those Tengubots still farming Serpentis faction ships and officers.
---
My first capital ship, a Nidhoggur called the "Built From Modules" was made entirely from reprocessed NPC drops from months of ratting.
---
The first and only kill it has is Zarvox Torald, who decided to "test the fighter's dps", sitting still in an active tanked Vagabond. Blap.
---
I have a proc that lit the cyno to destroy a drive by avatar.
---
Every snarl-word that has been overused lately has lost its effect. Rасist, sехist, even fasсist and Nаzi are so overused and diluted to the point that it's just white noise now.
---
I believe your intentions are pure but this is so easily misunderstood. People think legacy is harbouring serenity botters because of mango but vily has been very clear with them: at first sign of botting they are purged from the eastern side of the map. To be fair they are the best thing that happened to eve this year.
---
Most multiboxers also use input broadcasting, which is against ToS and makes your fleet correctly look like bots, because **at that point** they **are bots slaved to your input**.
---
They don't have BBQ'S though where said leader would wear a apron called "Cooking up a shitstorm" while actually serving bbq to people.
---
Well.. most of them don’t use input broadcasting because you will get banned for it within a few days ;) they probably use isboxer and tab trough all clients with a shortcut which is allowed :)
---
Aaah ok. This same mechanic I’ve noticed with ewar NPCs, I can always target the one jamming me. 
---
Wouldn’t ECM drones help? All they can do is target the drones but not you, right ?
---
This is true. GSF also doesn't have CTAs (yet)
---
What should they do then?
---
I'm sure even then it would be hardly difficult to just put the screenshot in and have a bot turn it to a text file.
---
That's why we're here, having this conversation. They disabled highsec wardecs and now fleets of exhumers strip mine highsec non stop. My old highsec Alliance has been reporting and wardec-ing **the same group of bots** *for years*. They are still around to this very day.
---
how about no
---
Are there apps then or websites that do it? I haven't found any yet.
---
Imagine taking one system from one day and just stating (with literally 0 other evidence) this is the case everywhere. There are bots. There were bots before during and after blackout. Two bots which for all we know have been in that system operating forever does not prove anything, it doesnt even hint at a conclusion. We have no system information to vet if these number have been consistent and no cross compare to a stagnant increase in New Eden as a whole.
---
Thank god we have players that jump to random conclusions because 1 system has bots...
---
Thank you! &lt;3
---
But why moving out ? 
---
Big corp = bigger wh ? 
---
Or because in C6/C5 you can bring cap to pvp ?
---
Just one - Manny Bothans. ;)
---
That's exactly what i was getting at. And it's true both ways, too.
---
You insult and make assumptions about a woman's political identity just because she shared some of her negative experiences in games. *This* is bad behaviour.
---
I guess my hunting tengu. Got dozens of cap kills and never died. Fell for baits twice, one time it got half the bomber fleet killed, but my tengu itself survived every time. Originally it was named ".", but i renamed it to "cursed." after i welped the bomber fleet with it.
---
Wait I don't remember that bit. Chapter?
---
Excellent, I chuckled ... and saved a copy
---
They’ve not directly deleted them I think... just didn’t make sure that there’s still enough reasons to fight. All the regions are the same now, there’s unlimited PvE everywhere, logistics/transport became too safe, the only passive income to fight for is Perimeter trade hub, you get to Nullsec via wormholes rather than gates, militia is more about farming than the storyline. There needs to be some sort of narrative to keep it interesting because at the end of the day it’s mostly Rock Paper Scissors in spaceships. It was the story that was interesting not pressing F1 and orbit.
---
&gt; You insult and make assumptions about a woman's political identity just because she shared some of her negative experiences in games. 
---
No, I state the obvious in a response to your pathetic attempt at "proving" something you can't prove, which you do in an even more pathetic attempt to save your dumb little whataboutist argument.
---
&gt; *This* is bad behaviour. 
---
*This* is the internet. Are you really fucking surprised?
---
Classic legacy hater resorting to bullying newbros  to make his point, I’m glad Reddit has a justice.
---
&gt; Kid with guns was immediately purged by vily as soon as proof was made that they were botting.
---
Despite numerous people even WITHIN the alliance raising doubts as to KWG's practices with regards to botting/rmt, leadership did nothing to try and investigate until it was plainly in front of them
---
&gt; never affiliated with legacy whatsoever
---
tell that to the wallets of the various people they paid off.
---
&gt; replaced by a newbro independent alliance.
---
AOM is there now and if you look at the alliance history of various KWG corps, you'll see a good chunk of them went to AOM.
---
U meen in t1 frig while we undocks its caps that's cute
---
Atleast they havent gone as bad as Runescape devs as far as I can tell. They finally said fuck it and purposely tanked the economy to devalue the work bots were doing.
---
Are u jellus
---
Well done, now ... go get another you steely-eyed killer :-)
---
Right
---
So they aren't ride or die allies?  Just whenever its convenient?
---
Why no. Its literally open season on their move ops. Snuffed would love that.
---
You could easily tune your broadcaster with a slight +/-1 second input lag and bypass all filters CCP may have. So no it won't get you banned
---
Little late bit we all know about u wh pubbies now how's that wh discord going
---
Repeating same fake news over and over won’t make them true. There are a lot of people out there that are jealous of the whole Legacy coalition and would rather spew rumours about botting and rmt to not accept the truth that is that we are just smarter and better at the game than these elite bittervets.
---
No, but there is a Reddit Eve discord.
---
Why does it need to operate on discord?
---
Joining a corp is in game, some corps use Discord for offline communication, pings, and voice comms.
---
I have the 2nd ikitursa built. So that's special to me. Friend has the first one built. Both have a fair bit of killmarks.  
---
(I built them both btw)  
---
Besides that I have a raven navy issue still. My first battleship I bought when I started playing. Its fit is trash and I havent updated it.
---
Is there already a list of all conflict drivers in Eve past and present somewhere?
---
Well not with isboxer afaik :) most of the people use it for window and cpu management
---
Agreed makes my head hurt
---
So they can fly out when everything goes to shit?
---
Brave has definitely undergone a significant culture shift since the times most people remember having positive interactions with them.  In my relatively short time in the alliance, I watched as the prevailing mentality changed from an aggressive pvp/fun focused mania to the same kind of 'just get enemies the fuck out of our space' annoyance you see in most other nullsec alliances.
---
As Suitonia mentioned elsewhere in this thread, 2017 was the turning point.  After the Fade adventure in DO6, the alliance moved to nearby Cloud Ring.  Despite initial successes taking sov and boosting recruitment with the resulting propaganda, it was almost immediately clear that PL was still going to crash the party (it really should have been clear before the move, but that's another story...).  As a result, leadership finally accepted TEST's offer to crash on their couch down in Catch.
---
It was around this time the shift began.  BE-FR - generally the first group of pilots to engage anything hostile in space - left Brave entirely.  While they had been split off at times before, they were by far the best example of 'always undock' when they were around.  Whether for similar reasons or by coincidence, several other aggressive and battle-hungry veterans either left or went AFK around this time as well.
---
Even so, Brave staging was still the place to go to get fights, and from February to July, GE-8 was easily the most dangerous system in nullsec.
---
But a combination of factors started slowly shifting the action away:
---
* Thanks to TEST + CO2, fights against NC/PL actually went well, and the existential threat that loomed over Brave started to fade a bit.  Not only did this make many members complacent, but more people began to join Brave just to be a member of a large anti-PL coalition (as opposed to joining for trial-by-fire pvp).
---
* The louder voices in standing comms were continually trending more toward 'helldunks or blueballs' than 'always undock'.  There were calls not just to try and directly counter what enemies brought, but often to not engage certain groups and ships at all.  Many veterans started to shy away from standing comms rather than continue to participate in the clash of cultures.
---
* Pandemic Horde was still growing in numbers, and everyone from solo/small gang pilots, to streamers, to npsi groups found it a lot more fun to head to Pure Blind and fight them instead.  You never had to worry about whether you were going to get a fight in 7RM, and if it was too quiet for your needs you could always poke C4C.
---
By August, 7RM had taken over the most dangerous nullsec system spot from GE-.  Not only was Horde on the rise, but kills in GE- had fallen to under half of what they were in May.
---
In that same month, Brave seemed to receive a significant boon by finishing in top 8 of the Alliance Tournament.  However, shortly after, a decently sized group of those very same AT pilots, along with other pvp-focused veterans and FCs - unhappy with the direction the alliance was going in, and disheartened by both the culture shift and leadership indifference to it - left Brave to form Parroto Social Club.  In the coming months, Brave would also lose its cap director (a turned PL spy) and two Military Directors.
---
While these were large blows to the alliance as a whole, what really sounded the death knell for the Brave of old was siding with the rest of Legacy against CO2 after the betrayal and subsequent gigx meltdown.  In doing so, Brave earned itself space in Impass, creating a safe home for its krab population and accelerating the process that has turned Brave into just another shitty nullsec alliance.
---
join all-out
---
We don't "think". We "know" that he IS the God of WH, and soon of all New Eden !
---
They still relevant??
---
Best way would be to hire a DEV team to work on AI to chew data. CCP doesnt know how to handle so much data, they make mistakes like blackout and lifting blackout, it would be better to give it a try.
---
AI is working on blizzard servers for a long time now. 5 years+ helping with boting and other things.
---
They could even make Isolation Ward to teleport suspects and check them. Simple harmless way to solve some problems.
---
What we see is they put a lot of man power to get manual control over bot reports, when report takes half of the year to get someone banned :D
---
I would start with reducing alphas bounty by 60% so new people can learn the basic but they need omega to actualy play the game.
---
Yeah that’s what I meant I want a place to talk to other corp members whilst I’m offline as I’m new and want to learn but can’t be on the game much
---
Dunno if newb or a new meta fit ...i mean he has a meme salvager on it...
---
help im trying to get a fight in fw but im dummy strong and everyone who sees me on dscan keeps warping off
---
Nothing to refute my claims :) nice! expected from test member
---
Oh noes. Etc.
---
Page 230 Chapter 29.  Between Lieutenant Korvin Lears and Captain Yana Varakova
---
That fit deserves to be on a killmail.
---
Because Snuff is scared of WC.
---
Ok, all corps and alliances I’ve felt with have Discords, many list their invite in corp info, you should post on r/EveJobs.
---
Also roaming in a battleship takes all fucking day, thanks CCP for 2AU/s
---
Okay so if I put 80bil of officer shit on a carrier can I dunk your fleet as long as it's less than 80 bil value? The value of your blops comes from it's ability to bridge and jump to covert cynos, not it's jamming capabilities or hull.
---
PS I don't fly caps anymore and am unaligned.
---
Ok thanks Also is there a major discord hun for either an official or unofficial eve server
---
I don't think you know how whataboutism works. And you get to "state the obvious" when you say she's a butthurt feminist and that gender specific bad behaviour is not more common than the regular bad behaviour but I have to go all scientific to prove a point. 
---
While the only evidence I show here is anecdotal, you got nothing. And since you immediately open with insults, you're part of that anecdotal evidence.
---
Can't break human rights if they're not humans
---
God I had a job like this. Literally a meeting every week that could have easily been explained via email. It was a privately owned company so the husband and wife pretty much did what they want despite having terrible management skills.
---
true
---
So before a major op, we could report the enemy?
---
r/Eve has one, I can’t find the invite right now, but there is not much help there at all.
---
Way better off talking in game with corpmates and the mining channel.
---
Yes you can but it really doesn't help as they will blue you cloaked afk alt in like a couple of day's you might get some kills but really the bots make there money back so quickly you can't pvp enough to really deal with it.
---
Passive moon mining was the big one.  Hell even being able to kite a POS timer into a better time zone.
---
$$$$ Pearl Abyss $$$$
---
Bots = Accounts = $$$$
---
Serenity bots = TQs CODE./GSF 25-man broadcast-input ganking fleets.
---
EWAR drones don't get bonuses. And any ship with a drone bay can fly ewar drones. So you don't need a widow for that.
---
You're describing something that didn't exist.
---
The only time the game was filled with people running 1 account was when it had less than 5000 players, in the very first year of EVE. It was not the glory days of EVE by a long shot, and people made alts pretty much from the get go, by the time revelations was rolled out in 2006 any serious player had alts. The glory days were 2009 to 2014, the 5 year span when PCU was above 50000 - and there were alts a plenty.
---
Here's an [example](https://zkillboard.com/related/30003356/200911210500/) of a fight 10 years ago in 2009, filled with alts. [This](https://zkillboard.com/related/30001985/201105282000/) is a super blob hotdrop in 2011, in the middle of the glory days, and [here](https://zkillboard.com/related/30045332/201301270400/) is another from 2013, plenty of alts and supers.
---
The supers isn't the problem, the alts isn't the problem, EVE had it's glory days when both were rampant. The problem is lack of balance patches, fixes and general care for the game. The best patches, that saw the game rise to its high water mark were Quantum Rise, Apocrypha, Dominion, Tyrannis, Incursion, ~~Incarna~~, Crucible, Inferno, Retribution, Odyssy and Rubicon. Look at what those patches did right if you want a key to success.
---
After that CCP did some mass layoffs, and began to focus on new games, messing up the development, finding other new ideas, rinse and repeat. EVE on the other hand began its long decline to where we are now.
---
&gt; If they are out there i haven't found them.
---
I'll try and look into it, is it literally just called that? is that their public channel?
---
They havent.
---
Bot numbers have rose again.  Actual players remain the same, only now its harder to find a fight since everyone runs at the first sign of neuts in local.  
---
No Krabs to tackle = no response fleet = no fights.
---
We would be part of the blue donut, but no one will give us a Keepstar. :( 
---
We asked DeadCo to give us one, but they said no. We're holding out hope that maybe the Imperium will, but they haven't transferred us their PB Keepstar yet. 
---
We're too poor to afford our own, but one day we'll be gifted one and then we can become serious members of a null bloc.
---
Harbour = more views, generally a better area = More expensive
---
Airport = Industrial area = cheaper.

a reason you dont find airports in built up nice areas.
---
Reddit recently updated their anti bully stuff. We now have autoremove nono words. Thanks
---
When are people going to learn, punishing players by introducing stupid tedious mechanics does not fix the game.
---
in English you say "compare apples to oranges", same meaning, different fruit
---
Wait so the blue donut is bad for the game?
---
I’m suggesting you look harder, that’s all.
---
Thanks for going the classy route with a disagreement arrow X-ray delta
---
wow is probably not the best game to use as a comparison...
---
I still own my very first noobship that I started the game with in 2003.
---
My megathron! Back when i joined eve a few years ago that was the first ship i saw un-docking from a station and i fell in love, Put all my skill points into getting into one, but then didn't do anything with it and stopped playing, came back joined horde and flew it, the only ship  i had up to c4c fade (still can't believe it got there) then for the next 2 years i flew many many fleets and many welp fleets and yet it still survived, its still in my hanger today and fly it every now and again, But when it finally gets destroyed ill be heartbroken.
---
I've got, or at least had, a couple of drakes with large rigs on them someplace. 
---
They were put together years ago before rigs came in different sizes and drakes weren't terrible. 
---
I should probably log on and see if they're still in station
---
Based on your name I ignored half of what you wrote.

Second one yes, first one no. https://www.humanbenchmark.com/tests/reactiontime/statistics

Sounds good to me.

&gt;IMO the problem BRAVE has it one of identity. They are no longer content first but farming first. The issue BRAVE has is their memberbase farm, get caps and all the wealth they could need, but then BRAVE is reletively passive and doesn't actually have anyone really doing anything offensive, and when you have billions of ISK, endlessly flying cormorants or caracals in pre-arranged fights with goons in catch loses it's appeal. On top of that their position in Impass has them surronded by blues. They have to literally go 20 jumps to Querious or to Curse to find the nearest non blue entity. So they have a history of bleeding members to TEST who actively engages in campaigns rather than only being that of a defender
---
This is spot on.  
---
One thing I wanted to elaborate on is that Brave has always struggled with containing the bleedover to other alliances - whether it be due to a lack of options for veteran players, restrictions on corporations and players moving between them, an absence of direction from leadership, or current day issues with content creation.
---
The top end of Brave leadership is notoriously terrible at engaging and communicating with rank and file alliance members, and harbors a type of paranoia (not entirely unfounded, but still over the top) that is incredibly detrimental to efforts to retain experienced members.  When Brave was independent, some of these members would try to work within out of a sense of loyalty, but now they can simply join the parent version of their alliance (TEST) and still be allied with all of their old friends.
---
I hope you convoed the guy and tryed to help him before he becomes the 86%
---
Sounds like working as intended and you dont like you cant use an alt with sound on to tell if people are coming into your hole.
---
&gt;eve feels empty because nobody wants to feed me free kills any more.

That's sweet.

CCP made a framework that ots could thrive in and fund a lot of stuff including paying the sub fee with it.

I've been flying the same tengu hull for about 2 years. It was the first one I ever bought, used originally for ganking, then as a sniper tengu, and until the end of the blackout it was repurposed to hunt supers.
---
I have a spare FC tengu that mostly collects dust, and some extra hunting tengus for the more dicey drops, but 98% of all my time in a tengu has been in this one hull.

which thrid party app makes rat bounties pay out more? i've not heard of this one.
---
or does it make you do more dps so you can kill rats faster? haven't heard of that one either.
---
cos, those are the only 2 ways to make isk faster. higher payouts, or faster kills.
---
lol thats a lot of people saying a lot of shit they know nothing about
---
Not a complete list but I wrote [this](https://blog.skyride.org/an-open-letter-to-ccp/) over 3 years ago calling out the changes they made to jump fatigue, sov mechanics and citadels. I also mentioned a bit about active moon mining well over a year before it got added to the game, back then the general consensus was still "ha, there's no way they'd be stupid enough to do _that_".
---
The stuff about jump fatigue will probably sound absolutely alien in 2019 as we're approaching 5 years since that was changed and they did significantly relax it since I wrote that, but I think the rest stands the test of time quite well.
---
I've seen the watermark (even wrote one of those into an alliance forum one time) or the magic 'random' number before. Not the word randomiser though, that's cool.
---
another huge meta change was social media, and smart phones, eve who, dotlan and zkill  that changed eve too
---
I'm gonna need to start smoking weed again if we cannot insult people Jibrish.
---
Anyone hiring with no drug test near me?
---
This really isn't true at all.
---
The GE- area was much busier in the past than it is now (2018+2019 kills don't even come close to the 2017 total).  The main difference is mentality.  For pilots with options, why go to GE- when you're going to get better fights elsewhere?
---
I contacted him, got no response. Then I checked his zkillboard and this was not his first time losing a Navy BC.
---
Skill injecting was a mistake. Before you would need to "incubate" the bot accounts, move from VNI/cruiser hulls up to bigger thingies. Getting banned wasted time, there was no way around that. 
---
Now if a botlord owns enough income he can readily inject new accounts after old ones have been banned.
---
Obviously it all assumes not-getting-every-acc-banned to work but even if you ban 'em all - starting from scratch does not induce a time penalty. You just sacrifice some of the real funds and carry on.
---
CENSORSHIP?!?
---
I remember being in a fleet of maybe 20 or 30 t1/named fit ships and getting into it with maybe 6x t2 fit ships and it being a fair and fun fight.
---
Not only that but the t2 drops covered our losses and some. 50+mil for a t2 damage control. 
---
I also remember everything being 0.0 and battleships first coming out.
---
just like it did in the blackout when they moved to other areas of space.
---
you don't just randomly give up your job and move professions because your boss tells you to sit at a different desk one day.
---
making a bot press F is impossible, mkay? That's why you need to press F in action games instead of just watching a movie.
---
Not everyone sees the game the same way as Tapi, where everyone has to be blue and blob the enemy lmao
---
so do actual players.
---
Fuck I hope they make a green one for Gallente.
---
Idk who downvoted you but i will upvote you to counter that. I hate that shit when people do it to me.
---
Oh I still remember the SBU's oh the fun dropping those things and see fleets getting rage pinged to kill the SBU's
---
Is this a suggestion or a leak.
---
why aren't they moving to the drone space they already have
---
Uuuu ... been on the cards for long time, was actually starting to think the move had been canned 🤷‍♂️
---
While bloc level resources and ability to spam the crap out of everything seems to slip CCP's mind, they don't seem to understand wormholes either. Exhibit A: FAXes. A single FAX completely ruins a low class fight (particularly as only one side can bring one), and they're pretty ridiculous in high class too.
---
re-add sound to wormholes when they shrink
---
re-add atmospheric sound to wormholes when they are half massed / crit
---
No problem, there's already a 3rd party memoryscraping app for that.
---
Didn't we have a blackout to prevent botting? It didn't take long for them to come back and you players to whine about it again.
---
Check out NoVac, they are legit the most easygoing C5 corp with zero tolerance for bullshit.
---
So reddit is even more shit? Nice.
---
You just have to wait 4 months of 'investigation'
---
The issue is they have this fucking ego about not making the same changes players suggest.  With their PR face on they love to supplicate us with praise about how we know the game as well as they do... and then they NEVER, EVER just put in the fucking change we suggested.  It's a bit like ordering a steak with carmalized onions and getting a steak with sauteed dog shit because the chef is a "professional" and then having the waiter praise your taste...
---
alts existed but they're more granulated now. People have alts 100% dedicated to ratting that never leave the system it rats in. The point I'm trying to make is that this means there is less and less actual traffic in nullsec. You don't even need two accounts, just skill inject a ratter on the same account as your main.
---
All of these little things just mean that we've gotten better at eliminating the need to ever be in any danger. And that goes both ways two, not just ratters. If a roaming hac gang comes through and you kill them all, that isn't going to make any sort of impact on their ability to reship and do the exact same thing the next day.

C'mon folks, you can upvote by clicking the **Up** arrow on the left.

This post is attacking me, i'm leaving reddit

---
That's like half the content on the subreddit though.
---
More Important, there seems to be a bug, which makes the WH sound disappear - You then have to reset soundsettings, to hear it again - very nice for living in a wormhole! 
---
As far as I can tell it happens in between logins, but it can also just stop making sounds while you are ingame.
---
Clearly they're only fitting the mods they need, taking a Jesuit approach to skew killboard stats. You may win battles with more fittings, but they win the war when they point out isk efficiency on Reddit and publicly humiliate scrub alliances like Snuff, unspoken, rote, etc
---
Lmao your feeling hurt there snowflake.
---
Yeah that's kind of the problem. I just asked if this applies to video game characters and groups. The sub exists to be a place to shit talk other Eve groups. If they stick to real life topics this will be no problem.. but that was already their policy. Since this is an expansion in scope I have no idea exactly what they expanded this to.
---
So, when and where do we move from here? lol
---
dont go to all-out if you want normal human behaviour, they are a 4chan heavy corp
---
Yup heard that they even had WoW goldfarmers set up in prisons to make some extra cash for their director or something like that.
---
I have a Hulk that has been with me through tenerifis, cache, etherium reach, period basis, querious, delve, fountain, and now is in tribute.

It has pretty much spiraled through Null SEC.

I have my highsec hauling Wreath that survived 4 suicide gank attempts.
---
r/eve: eve is dying! do something!
---
also r/eve: ban all the foreigners!
---
Dave, if all I wanted was free kills. I'd just set up a log off bubble trap and kill Ishtar bots all day. It's incredibly easy to do.
---
I'm interested in actual Player vs Player kills or losses.  I know it's an incredibly hard concept for you to grasp with [22 solo kills.](https://zkillboard.com/character/91039063/solo/)
---
unlike white men who are definitely not victimized by the mere existence of people who disagree with them
---
They wont because they risk something then   and also their krabs and bots will cry because its a bit unsafe and they cant stack their isk for no reason
---
As a dirty l5 runner, none of the gateless missions have really changed in a very long time. I do not run the gated ones much so I am not sure about that. However to answer your question, no reclamation has not changed but I have had a few instances in that one and in fortress where my overview did not show what I need to shoot at and I had to click stuff and zoom in and manually click it. Then 10 mins later I can run another reclamation or fortress and it's in my overview. I am unclear on why my overview sometimes bugs out on only those 2 missions on a few occasions.
---
If I am not mistaken there are a number of people who WANT to PvP.  I see them on Twitch all the time.  Stop getting mad because you can't go "Elite PvP" on mining ships and PvE players.
---
yawn. dude, no one gives a shit.
---
But that's not because of the cyno change. It's not like before subcap ganking groups were setting up traps with cap escalations all the time. Most groups don't have caps in position when hunting. Especially wormholers.
---
It's not like the hard part is having a cyno with your group and as soon as they made you require a recon people decided that was too much work to escalate. The part that is work/risk is having cap pilots in range while hunting in subs, ready to commit to grid and probably feed to the locals who probably have more caps.
---
I don't think people said, "Wait, we have to bring a 400mil cloaky recon instead of a 50mil frigate to cyno our 5b or 10b or 20b of caps in? Oh well screw that too difficult."
---
Except they didn't do what the players were asking for, both were broken ideas that didn't even attempt to deal with the problems the players were asking to be fixed.
---
People were complaining about Dominion sov and both how easy it was to defend while being AFK, but also how difficult it was to defend against a larger force. We were asking for what we started calling occupancy sov. A sov system wherein as long as you actively lived in your space, you could hold it against attack. 
---
What we got was a system where you had to always be in your space and defending it constantly to have any chance of holding it.
---
CCP missed the point of what players were asking for and ended up giving us exactly the opposite.
---
Force projection was much the same way. The complaint was about people moving massive capital ship fleets around the galaxy in minutes on short notice. Any fight of any size/duration would have a capital fleet cross the galaxy to get involved. This is what people wanted to go away. Instead, moving capitals around was made nearly impossible for anyone who didn't have a massive capital fleet, and the massive capital fleets took a week of planning and fleets to move anywhere. There have been numerous cases of entire capital stockpiles being self-destructed for insurance because moving them is too painful.
---
Again, CCP missed the point. Where people wanted capitals to not be able to teleport onto any fight in minutes, what CCP delivered was capital fleets being basically immobile. They sit parked at home, dropping on anything that moves knowing that nobody else can bring their capitals to bear.
---
These two changes, where CCP missed the point of what the players wanted, are major contributors to the current stagnation of nullsec.
---
They did -- they implemented the blackout, which chased bots out of nullsec. They also banned a record number of botting accounts at the same time. 
---
Then carebears threw a hissy fit and quit en masse, got the blackout reversed (which appears to have caused a lot of pvp people to quit), and now the game appears to be on the verge of actually dying. My money says the bounce back in player count is almost entirely bots.
---
The botting thing is a bit of a meme but not gonna lie, I have read a lot of entirely unironic and extremely racist stuff laid against Chinese people in just about every major group in EVE the last year or so. It really seems like as a community we're just chill with that and I'm not a fan.
---
Five years ago, when I was last in a null alliance and heard that 'our FC was negotiating with an enemy FC on their TS to set up a fight' that's when I knew the game had become total bullshit and entirely contrived.
---
Oh and the back-room agreements to allow the other to poach on their renter land without effective defense fleets forming in exchange for the same courtesy... Yeah, The game is contrived by a dozen or less fuckwads who think highly of themselves.
---
Break shit up. Cap corp membership and alliance membership at 25% of current numbers. Allow for a limited number of blue tags per corp/alliance.
---
Dissolve corps/alliances. More mutiny. Do something you worthless F1 drone fucks.

&gt;it's not their fault we are not getting any PVP like ur pointing out

Where did they say that? They said exactly the opposite

Chinese players are a problem in every game they play. Not just Eve. Find a hacker in Pubg, chances are they are in China.
---
Sounds like they're trying to turn reddit into a hypersafespace.  Isn't there already Twitter for that?
---
I have a Blackbird named Paul (after the Beatle) that I got my first ever kill with. I was the only survivor of two 4-5 man gangs that ran into each other on a gate. When the dust settled I was surprised to be alive. I left it in High Sec when I moved out to Null and its been there ever since. I should go dust it off...
---
The MER showed pretty clearly that bots left or didn't have viable alternate isk generating mechanisms. |
---
Sure, some real players also quit. But it's impossible to deny that blackout was the single most effective bot remover CCP has used in years.
---
\&gt; Caring about the opinions of **anyone** who posts on /r/SubredditDrama
---
Name a online game, and you will find Chinese bots. I like Chinese people, I have friends that are Chinese, but Chinese are notorious for botting in online games. Even my Chinese friends will tell you that. It's not racist when it's factual.
---
The difference is unlike ISK, abyssal materials are limited to the construction of a few select ships, and so if all the bots do the same shit in abyssal sites then the value of the materials tanks and the bots make terrible money.
---
It's definitely a thing but I think it's overblown, there's over a billion Chinese in the world so it's not surprising a large portion of hackers are Chinese because a large portion of gamers are Chinese. I wasn't referring to that though.

I'm talking about racial slurs, race supremacy, poking at their politics national pride with a big stick, and obviously making fun of how they look.
---
I'm happy to at least see your acknowledgement that characters and players are not the same thing.
---
Given the clear high levels of botting returning to null I think we have to question just how real a lot of those 'players' (and the 'players' lost to blackout) actually are.
---
My idea is widow doing ewar + EC-600 might be enough to keep dropping the target lock on it so it can avoid being deleted.  Just theory creating ways for it to be viable ... slightly :). I’ve read other posts saying to just ignore the fact that Widow has jam bonuses. It can be configured to do great dps, and can thrust around at full speed while cloaked. 
---
I realize this is off topic from your complaint, which I don’t disagree with, unless of course I’m the one being jammed :)
---
The widow is priced at 1 billion... so someone must believe it’s useful for something otherwise the market for it would plunge no?
---
It's simple enough to clear red status if you are willing to put in the effort.
---
I mean, CSM's creation was literally a PR stunt after CCP's corruption was caught red handed, sooo...
---
Well, maybe. We don't know for sure yet. But we have nuked some words in response to this that traditionally we would let through under specific circumstances.
---
Don't want to use this as a zinger but you must agree that this was hilarious.
---
I want you to regret saying this, so I'm telling you to go visit 9gag yourself for some hands-on experience. https://9gag.com/tag/eve-online/fresh

A strawman, how nice.
---
Good to see you've realised that you've lost.
---
11110101010000111 you mean.

yes, just look for the corp in game. There's a lot of people who like to shit fling against us due to exactly our strict rules of conduct regarding them, we have a white paper that governs conduct exactly to deal with these situations and some bad actors enjoy making fun of that. Being inclusive and chill is a top priority of ours, don't listen to the naysayers and just join our pub and have a chat, its in the corp description.

Wolf, took it out on a fleet had awesome fight was one of like 5-6 who survived named it survivor
---
Flew it out again same thing happened
---
After the third one I parked it figured best not to test it’s luck as it’s one of the few ships I have that has kill marks
---
I imagine on the back it says "my other atron is an atron"

BoB never died, [they just became NCdot](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/632866070/corporations).
---
It seems that reddit is moving away from being a website that assumes anonymity as a default. The enforcement of this rule doesn't seem to be intended for virtual entities included in games like Eve, but I can see how other communities would find a stricter no-harassment policy to be more valuable.
---
Guessing its still there for cloaky ships too then?
---
Pandafam caring about content ?   
---
What a fucking bullshit comment right there.  
---
Those guys just want to sterilize content for miles around them and krabs without been bother by anyone.
---
Turns out people don’t like to lose. Who would have thought?
---
I have a Taipan from a code card that I got from EVE Vegas. I got the code card by beating Chessur in the Blood Raider themed tourney CCP put on.
---
If two people jam the same target at the same time the target can lock both of them.
---
Also the Widow is made of the same components as the other Blackops battleships and Marauders. So that sets a price floor for it.
---
LOL! It so would!
---
Jesus christ it's slightly worse than Eve facebook.
---
Do you really want them to release another update? The last handful have been akin to playing russian roulette.
---
Im not sure if its the same hull, but, ive never lost an astero, and i wanted one really bad when i first started playing. So i now ALWAYS have an exploration astero with me wherever i live. RN its in wormholes where it belongs, but its special to me even if its not the same hull.
---
Yes!
---
New pirate implant sets! Tiercide! Navy Battleship overhaul! They will all be coming in **AN** October update!
---
I think both are good roles for Newbro's. However I do think that tackle is better at teaching newbros vital early game skills like identifying and targeting an enemy, orbiting an enemy, staying in range, and (most importantly) that it's okay to lose your ship when your ship is inevitably destroyed by your target so they can escape the tackle. 
---
After learning those lessons, then progressing to logi is a good secondary as it is definitely easier for a newbro to be useful to a fleet as logi then tackle.
---
It looks like it hurt the hunters more than the umbrella. It's worth throwing away a recon to save a supercarrier. But because the recon is dropping a defense fleet, it still has a good chance of survival. There are swarms of recons available in the defense fleets.
---
As the dropper though the math is different. The cyno ship is almost certain to die, so making an attempt on that supercarrier is very likely to cost you the recon whether you succeed or fail. The hunters are already the most sensitive group to killboard losses, it's one thing to throw away a stealth bomber, it's another to throw away a recon. We're seeing very little in the way of hostile cyno's being used for hunting now.
---
The cyno changes have definitely shifted the balance of the umbrella but in the wrong direction. They have all but removed the use of things like dread bombs and reinforced the use of mass bomber fleets as a hunting strategy.

Botting today is next to nothing compared to several periods in the past.

There were multiple times where botting enforcement was nonexistent to the point that players were openly discussing and sharing the bots.

I run most of the lower level combat sites with an astero. The blood annex is one i wouldn't bother with because it's got so much EHP for the potential reward.

Used to have one, my Inner Zone Shipping Imicus. I wish i had undocked it and gotten it killed. Because when SKINs were introduced they stole it from me and turned it into a regular Imicus. And it would have been more valuable to me today as a lossmail than the ship ended up being to me.

I mean, honestly, I'd play on a botting-allowed server, I think it'd be fun. But I code for fun and profit, so I'm not most players.

Wholesome post. Thank you

This is a fair point. People want their space to be secure and being a reliable source of fights does the exact opposite. They do not owe content to people coming to their space.
---
If you don't like it, go set up your own space and promise to fight anyone who comes.
---
Finally someone who agrees with me.
---
From your comments, it's almost like you've never played Eve.
---
Are you suggesting that CCP would plan something and never actually do it?
---
This is why I moved to WHs. Still has that old EVE feel. And while everyone is rich, you can still wage war and destroy groups (evictions). And there’s still good fights without the cap umbrella or big blue bore fest. I’m so glad WHs have ice and moo goo now. I find less and less reason to go to KSpace each day, except to sell shit.
---
every one knows ccp starting ruin eve from 2015-2016
---
If nobody was interested, those components would drop in price as well right ? Less demand. Actually nevemind the other blops ships would keep the component prices stable
---
That made me sick....
---
Because you clearly don't know the game.
---
Remember when reddit was about free speech?
---
Navy Ravens used to be OP
---
Not really an issue for a bot with next to zero operating expenses. Plus trig ships are pretty great and are constantly in high demand :) 
---
In jita right now there are around 40-50ish t2 fit gila bots, running t4 abyssals all day every day, with next to zero risk. Can you imagine how much isk they pump out? Must be mental.
---
A friend who quit gave me a stabber when he left, I keep it in jita as a memento
---
Easy to automate isnt the problem. PvE is tedious. The more tedious it becomes, the more likely someone is going to use a bot. 
---
Anything and everything can be automated.
---
Oh man. The wormholers are going to all get banned next time I post in one of their threads.
---
Your constant harassment has let me know you are a bully.
---
We will probably never get observatories at this rate.
---
Whoops, that's bannable.

Navy ravens are still super good, take a look at some  torp fittings :)

It used to suck for a while because they costed 900m, although they have stabilized back to around 300m

My old Raven, very first battleship I've ever flown, I remember my first time moving to null in 2015 and i welpt the Raven through 20 gates without a scout. Didn't run into anything thankfully. I believe the only thing i ever killed with it is a Vexor navy that was roaming in our space, guy I was with tackled it and i mauled it down. Now it sits in Jita, collecting dust.
---
Yeah but rattlesnakes are better now so yeah they're still good it's just that rattlesnakes out class them in pretty much every way

it's like bring banned from Eve, it's just setting you free
---
You mean the /r/jailbait days?
---
EZ solution fam, just get on our level.
---
subreddit drama is a cancer sub
---
The MER cannot show you that the bots left. You first have to know which ones are bots and which ones are players to be able to do that.
---
It was the most effective player remover CCP has used for years. Will bots get caught in it, sure. But your assumption is "some real players also quit" but most bots. If it was only "some" then CCP wouldnt have ended the test. 
---
I dont get why people are missing this. CCP wanted the blackout to be permanent, the only reason they stopped it was because it was hurting them massively financially. There is no way around this. It wasnt "some", it was a shitton of real players who left.
---
Yeh that is true
---
Turn on dynamic camera.
---
It will offset your ship from the tracking target.
---
True
---
Let alone what, 425 million dollars?
---
Neither of which would fix the main issue, which is that the game logs everything into plaintext files.
---
It's almost like people have different criteria for what constitutes fun and will play the game accordingly. We can't all build empires to harbour the questionably EULA compliant parts of the player base. ;)
---
This fit is amazing, it does it all. Without rigs no less.
---
No its just a blatant lie. I mean this sub is stupid on the best of day but like atleast keep the lies somewhat close to the truth, thats what real liars do. Like, the stupidity hurts me more than anything else.
---
I'm gonna join in, gonna make all 14 of my alpha accounts into bots. Is there a guide anywhere?

You just drove yourself into a corner. R/eve hates eve just as much as League.

Yes. I have to believe ccp can improve and iterate upon mistakes, or I might as well unsub now.

Perhaps others have reached that point. I am not yet one of them.

EvE's lore is half the reason I joined the game. It's just so *fascinating* and I want to learn more! CCPLZ revive Arek'Jalaan!

---
There seems to be a common thread that everyone wants Brave to simply feed. Invaders aren’t looking for good fights. Asking Dunk if he’d engage 20 sleips in 20 thoraxes is like asking someone if they would like to get kicked in the nuts.
---
Back to the forums lol
---
The MER showed nothing of the sort. Numerous specific pieces of evidence of bots relocating have been posted to /r/eve.
---
&gt; But it's impossible to deny that blackout was the single most effective bot remover CCP has used in years.
---
I'll deny it.
---
The reality is that the worst of the botters are the RMTer who have a massive financial incentive to adapt as well as the resources to do so and the economy of scale to accept losses. A real player is the one just leaving the game. The botters are the ones who just figure out what the next best thing is to bot. This can even mean just accepting blackout because who cares if you lose a couple of bots out of your army? You have the economy of scale and business drive to accept losses in a way few regular player's egos will tolerate.
---
Its also not racist because Chinese isn't a race, its a nationality.

Yeah a bunch of people there first harangued the reddit admins to close it down and when they didn't want to, started sending mails to internet media to put up pressure. I think they eventually folded because it just became untenable to advertising customers. That pretty much drives 99% of chance on the internet.
---
Bots are like the common cold. No matter how much you try to eradicate them, they *always* come back.
---
Arty or auto. Is this really a question?

Aw, c’mon guys, seriously?! 😭

I thought this subreddit was full of salt and memes (Caldari Non-Dank Issue) - so a sincere thank you for the gold. &lt;3 you guys. I’d blue donut you any day. Or redbox, your choice!
---
Good one. If you go into someones turf, you really shouldnt expect to make it out alive. That would be hardcore.
---
You don’t need to be cap stable. Most things will either die or kill you before cap becomes an issue.
---
Let the reckoning begin....
---
Warframe seems to have pretty good anti-cheat software, as far as I can tell.
---
So what, anyone that roams through panfam space is automatically looking to seal club PvE players?   This comment is pretty indicative of the butter brained logic that seems to have metastasized throughout the community.  Anyhow, I'm not really mad friend, because I simply don't play the game anymore.  Enjoy eve.
---
You may need to stop making them blue first.
---
But you assume CCP does right? So if the stopped the test then the assumption would be that their numbers were showing something they didnt like right?
---
There, thats your answer.
---
Highest possible, I actively run c3s in my tengu so at that or better
---
The question is incomplete. The math depends on more than just the ships involved.
---
If you're talking about my taking 20 thoraxes roaming in hostile space, I would happily crash 20 thoraxes into 20 sleips if I knew I could kill half of them. But the math changes when you're doing home defense. The goal is not to kill more than you lose, the goal is not to have a fun fight, the goal is to make your space safe and to dissuade them from coming back. The purpose of the fight alters the decisionmaking.
---
&gt; Actually nevemind the other blops ships would keep the component prices stable
---
Exactly. The way the market will respond instead is by not producing widows.
---
He's the exception, and also Exooki
---
If you want to daytrip C3 then the praxis is a much more cost effective option.
---
So I went to workbench that was posted earlier but how do I sift through the myriad of shit fits?
---
The issue is mods have to basically get policy decisions by looking at the mod logs themselves. The rules they post are often times far less strict in wording then they actually enforce. There are times I see "anti-evil operations" remove things that are just mind boggling. They also mute a huge amount of users in specific subreddits and we also can only guess as to why.
---
For the record anti-evil operations is reddit.com's admin account for 'bad things' - aka, manipulation, violence etc. The fact that users can't see this log makes it extremely frustrating from a mod perspective. You don't always know why you're removing something, only that the admins remove X and so you have to. This is something I personally get shit on for routinely so maybe I'm ranting.
---
This is why I stickied the heads up because we've got no idea how this will work in reality. Given that this is a shit posty / thunderdome subreddit it could impact us a lot harder than people realize - to the point of even quarantine potentially.
---
Yea there's not liking to lose and then there's not being willing to take a good fight. I don't like to lose myself but I'm willing to take an even fight because it is FUN.  
---
I'd rather have FUN and lose an even/slightly outmatched fight than blueball and fuck off cause there's a chance I die.
---
Stealth bomber fits pretty much follow the below layout.  Being cap stable isn't so important when your in a ship that needs to kill it's target and gtfo immediately.

---
...that is just goddamn *sad*.
---
Cap stable, from what I understand, is only important for ratting or certain similar situations. You could also be "virtually" cap stable, if your cap will last more than a few minutes for PvP fights. (12 minutes of cap might as well be cap stable, since the fight will be over long before you're capped out.) I am not good at solo/small gang PvP however, so my advice may not be the greatest.
---
Join the Bombers Bar Discord and or in game channel (igc: Bombers Bar), let them know you're a newbro and need help with the fitting there'll be a bunch of people helping you trying to figure out what fit will suit your purposes best. Cap stability is not a concern for all fittings i know (except a special one with dual damp/piont to solo barges without dying to drones).

Raising standings is trivially easy, and you dont need to wait out timers at all. Learn how fleets and missions interact, its fairly broken.
---
The main issue is feudalism offers far more opportunities for corruption, and far fewer for transparency/correction. Democracy offers better incentives for leaders to be responsive to popular welfare/concerns and not nobility/special interests. It really does work better (in terms of delivering benefits/quality of life to the majority of the populace). 
---
For the Amarr specifically, though, my issue isn't the neu-feudalist *civilian* government, it's attaching the military apparatus to the feudal elements of the government. Each House will have its own private fleets and armies, which will be the majority of the Imperial military. This causes problems, if you've ever played CK2 you'll have encountered some of these before:
---
1) Vassals can use their fleets to wage war on each other or the Throne
---
2) Vassal navies may not integrate well with each other; if they're headed by nobles from rival families, instead of Imperial-appointed commanders, they won't be able to fight in unison effectively when they need to work together. 
---
3) Vassals can choose not to provide their full power to the Throne in the event of an empire-wide military conflict, holding back to improve their postwar position relative to their rivals or because they don't believe in the cause. 
---
Catiz should be implementing a clean military/civilian governance split, with Imperial fleets assigned to each of the Houses but their commanders appointed and managed from the Throne. Their commanders should work in concert with the civilian governments of each Royal House, but be primarily loyal to the Throne. Instead, she's *merging* military and civilian governance in a way that, while it might streamline things compared to where they are now, will cause serious problems over the next 50-100 years.
---
Eve is much more than just PVP and trying to force everyone to do PVP when they don't want to is what's killing eve.
---
While it does happen to be near the airport, it would be fairer and more meaningful to say that the new building is near the University of Iceland.
---
I haven't seen a bot in weeks. Or that might be because I haven't logged into the game in that time. It could be anything.

Never fly safe, fly Brave instead.

No offense here but like you dont know what youre talking about. All your experience seems to have come from this sub since youre parroting it word by word.
---
Ive only met a handful of people who have +10 rorqs. Its a meme. And they are by no means safe isk makers and anyone who tells you that is an idiot.
---
Null doesnt have greater rewards for the  majority of players. Thats the issue.
---
Caps should be viewed as corp/alliance level investment? What you wanna turn back the clock 10 years? Can you?
---
What you and most have missed is that this is a 16 year old game. You yourself are saying youve made billions in a month. Do the math yourself. In 16 years you will have isk to fund multiple titans with ease. 
---
And like, you dont know the actual risk. Maybe try living in NS before saying how risky it is? Besides, its a sandbox. We mitigate the risk, we players. We defend ourselves from any who try to harm us. And thats somehow bad.
---
Which is why I recommended that professionals pick up the game itself. It's exposure and repetition, like anything else I suppose.
---
I have to agree. Defenders don't seem to be having any trouble using cyno recons, but their use as an offensive tactic has all but stopped.
---
General attrition in fights made them mutually enjoyable, even if you lost the strategic objective.
---
Huh.  Completely logarithmically correct.

Just let the chaOs taKe yOu. It is a ģOod PaIn.

This. For most players, running a set of hunters is pretty terrible gameplay. Unless you have a truly insane number of accounts, you just can’t do much to shut down an area to the point where you can hunt effectively. The potential targets simply move away. If you move to where they are active, then they move again or dock up. And you usually cannot do anything interesting yourself while you try that hunting style (unless you have even more accounts). Most afk hunters I know spend their time playing other games or watching movies while they occasionally check their afk cloakers. Or they are at work or asleep 90% of the time. This isn’t really even playing Eve.
---
In the past, I have tried a combination of three AFK cloakers, one semi-active hunter, and a solo Black Ops. This game play sucks. I had to be able to log in shortly after downtime. I would leave four scouts afk while I went to work. Typically, the targets simply avoided the systems where I had characters. Or they would try to figure out when I was actually active and rat when they suspected I was asleep or at work. Some days I would get kills by coming home for lunch, or waking up super early. When I got home from work, I would go active on one of the four scouts so as to have something to do during my couple of hours of available playtime.
---
Or I could try the occasional log on trap (this works pretty well with blue eyes). But most of the time, you simply come back home from work to see that someone has been ratting away one jump away all day. You jump the gate and try to catch him, but unless he’s not paying attention, you have a slim chance of catching him. Active hunting without blue eyes is really miserable gameplay. Anything a solo player can kill will have warped off before you can catch it (unless they fall asleep). 
---
Active hunting with blue eyes feels dirty. I usually develop Lima syndrome with the people I am hunting, unless they are so awful that being on comms with them is simply intolerable.
---
During Blackout, I could be somewhat active and watch systems to find people who were active. If I needed to check next door, the target would at least not know immediately that I had entered system. Or, I could log off my scouts and play on other characters for a few hours, without targets being able to see that I had logged off or on. I resubscribed one of my old accounts because of the hunting opportunities presented by Blackout. I unsubscribed it after Blackout got cancelled, because it was essentially useless.
---
From what I can tell, roaming is essentially dead. Nearly every group has a hell dunk or blue balls mentality. We used to get great small gang home defense content forming 10-15 man gangs to fight the roamers. Now, it’s a race to try to form subcaps before some idiot drops a handful of Supercapitals on them (and - except for in Delve - it seems like no one takes advantage of nearby NPC space to drop Dreadnoughts on them to punish them for being stupid). And generally the roamers simply moonwalk out. I cannot imagine this is very fun for either side. 
---
Finding non-terrible things to do in Eve gets harder every day...
---
Total lies I have seen Init it respond with caps in about 70 percent of its defense ops the only limiting factor is if a cap FC is online. It is the optimal strat but dont kid yourself about init giving good fights.

From experience he's correct, Vegas is soon so anything major will be held for that. I'm hoping it's a good one this year. Unlike 98% of the eve playerbase, I loved citadels, the capital changes and trigs so, I'm hyped.
---
Is this post infohazardous?
---
Subcap bomber fleets were buffed but overall nano cap drops were nerfed substantially. End result the umbrella space is as safe or safer with the changes. Only with blackout would this change have affected much.

That's incredibly bad sportsmanship.  Living in null includes accepting invaders are part of the game, both in the form of hostile incursions and hostile takeovers.  If your goal is to fundamentally demoralize other players that enter "your space", then you shouldn't be playing an MMO.  It's akin to playing a boardgame with a friend that screams, yells, and throws a tantrum every time you make an opposing move.  
---
What's even more strange, the people with this tantrum mindset have the audacity to complain about the lack of content.
---
Kinda splitting hairs there aren't you?

Fact.

A group? Guess people can't pick on groups of players = Alliances in this sub anymore.
---
 Mmm Goons love Goons?
---
No.  This is terrible.  Sorry.
---
Three torp launchers and a cloak up top.
---
You don't want a scram in the mids. You're a paper airplane.  Range is your friend. Use an afterburner, not a microwarp drive, to keep your sig radius down and your power grid available.
---
Lows should be all ballistic control units.
---
Fit rigs with overclocks if you need CPU, and maybe put a warp disruptor (NOT a scram) in there so you can lock a target down.  Keep in mind you're then committed to 20-24km range instead of 40-50km.  If you want a bomb launcher you may have to use arbalest torp launchers, also depending on your skills. Bombs are a different animal, though, so fly bombers with others to support you while you learn.
---
Well, I hope you get a clarifying response from the Admins soon.
---
Your posting quality has gone downhill ever since the lowsec gate was finally thrown in the bin
---
As a bad player of eve, nano shit is what pushed me out the door.  
---
I chased/fed countless nano gangs with newbie fleets.  Fun for them.. not for us.  In the end, not undocking was the most "skillful" thing we could do.  Same amount of fun (depressing, I know), but at least we weren't feeding someone.

You’re looking to seal club players, not necessarily pve though. If you weren’t you wouldn’t be going after newbies as an elite tier pvp player.
---
"we demand change"
---
  CCP CHANGES
---
  "WTF why are you changing things put it back"
---
  CCP PUTS IT BACK
---
  ".... we demand change"
---
Population has some to do with it, but it is also their culture supporting it. Like Koreans with RTS games. Its just a part of them.
---
Worst thing I ever hear that might be even close to racist is Taiwan shit. But no one is immune to political stuff.
---
NUUN is recruiting, just apply and i will accept tomorrow ;)
---
Listening to the players was a mistake from the start
---
Sorry for jumping in like this, but the people above who misinform you about the *actual* situation are heavily biased against literally anyone actually playing the game as intended.
---
See, when you're farming in the supposedly highest risk/highest reward area of the game, then *you should be at risk*. Fact is that the cloaky guy *is the only risk they have*, while still being able to *farm in some of the most lucrative space out there*.
---
The PvPers wanted local in null to be gone, *because the farmers always dock up as soon as someone enters local, meaning they're playing literally risk free*.
---
You need to check around all the facts of everything they say. They will come up with all kinds of bullshit, ripping things out of context, putting themselves into the victim position, calling PvPers sociopaths and many, many things more. They twist everything around, just so they look like they're victims who are being oppressed by pure evil. 
---
Have a nice day and don't burn yourself out farming for ISK.
---
You nerf rorqs you'll get a storm of mad krabs spamming the sub.
---
  Just go back to blackout wew lad were people upset.
---
They've always been around, NC/PL
---
Botting dropped significantly during blackout. I know all you nullbears hated it, but it did decrease botting.
---
Semantics are important.
---
Im not saying bigotry is ok, but all bigots aren't racists. We have different words for different definitions for a reason.
---
&gt;nano gang
---
  You were hunting krabs not PvP players m8
---
You blasted a poor, innocent, railgun-blaster fit, mining-salvaging, armor-repping shield-tanking, data hacking newbie??!!??!!??  Sssssssssshhhhhhhhaaammme...
---
on him, for not accepting your convo to learn what he was doing wrong.  Send him an evemail, with advice, not isk.
---
How did this not get censored??????
---
You fly kitey nano bullshit with 1:1 logi don't get mad when supers are the answers. No one likes fighting risk averse kiting trig dessies and garmurs.
---
OP, mixing meth and adderal can lead to brain damage. Much like the brain damage i experienced by proxy through reading this thread.
---
There's losing then there's not being able to catch slippery kiting bullshit with max logi. I'm happy to lose. I'd rather a close fight brawling on a gate over chasing insta warp inties and garmurs all day. I see a doctrine like that rolling around I don't even bother.
---
No, literally, Olmeca tweeted that he had the same views as you do going in, but has since seen what goes on, and admitted he was wrong about the CSM members.
---
In fact, Olmeca actually ran on the premise of pushing his playstyle
---
^ this man gets it
---
That is the right name and corp you linked.

Full quote:
---
&gt;" CCP Rise backs up a little bit and asks what their gut feeling would be about affecting engagements when disabling remote repair. Overall Innominate and Aryth would think that this would make more fights happen, they would be having a lot of fun and even knowing if they lose they would come out ISK positive. CCP Fozzie says that in the past they would see that people would find ways to mitigate fights not because they're afraid of losing but rather because they are afraid of feeding without getting kills.

He's got nothing else to live for, that Stain Gate was his (EVE) life mission.
---
Give it to me, and I'll double it.
---
Even just a rate limit of how fast you can inject would make a big difference.
---
Are you saying that one of options is obviously not viable? I'm wondering which and why?
---
I guess the only difference between monsters and heroes is what causes they decide to fight for.
---
Herpes?
---
Cause the 10k in isk was purchased directly from CCP.
---
So, what, at least 3 years of dust on that helmet?
---
Railgun-blaster-artillery*
---
Christ, even Reddit wants /r/eve to die.
---
I don’t have any of that bullshit going on. I have 3 accounts but thanks to changes made by CCP for the betterment of EVE as a whole, I no longer need three accounts at all. I can do everything I used to multibox 3 clients for with two. In fact, I find myself needing/desiring the second account less and less. When I started EVE, I stuck with a single account for years until it became apparent that to play the nullsec cap pilot game I was going to need my own mids (until I learned my way out of being a JDC4 scrub, at least). Queue the two accounts.
---
So on my anecdotal evidence alone, player counts were inflated even at their peak due to cyno alts and capital proliferation (great way to make money back then, but boy howdy did it screw up a lot of things for a lot of people).
---
I’m slowly reacclimatising myself to New Eden after a much needed absence which outlasted Precursor ships and modules, cyno changes, blackout and maybe I’m missing a thing or two but the UI changes and probe window seem much different to me from when I stopped logging in and subbing. There’s enough ISK left in the wallet to plex for a spell, and I have plenty of valuable loot and ships I could sell off to prolong my Omega status .. it just seems a shame to let over 100m skill points go to waste as an Alpha. Hell, it’s great to have accomplished the time grind of spending years with implants in and remapping to get max sp/hr so I won’t be that one strung out asshole without JDC5 on the weekly blops gang.
---
Anyway, fuck alt accounts. Low Player Count is either an opportunity for CCP or it isn’t. How they choose to slay this golden goose is entirely up to them.

---
The players removed content. CCP just helped.  
---
Every bluetral pet just wants to krab and krab to have lots of caps and supers and do what, exactly? Drop them on some upstart corp or 100 man alliance in Stain? Players are just as guilty as CCP.  
---
CCP certainly nudged the ball along especially in the past few years in first ignoring the power of Super ratting and rampant bots in the Drones, then over buffing Rorqs into meme territory, with the coup de grâce of failing to iterate awful citadel (sov too for a long time) mechanics ensuring safety in the ze krablands. The economist they had on staff left or was canned, probably because he was being ignored/CCP didn't give a shit when more alts meant more subscriptions. 
---
   
---
They waste time and effort on shit like this recent meme-mechanic like nullsec blackout (conveniently covering up their technical spaghetti code issues of local chat) instead of tweaks to citadels/asset management which could have immense immediate effects.  
---
Shit, motherfuckers could have given faction warfare a damn minute of attention and given some fun, easily accessible content to newbros to retain some people trying the game. But naw, these new skins will drive up that average revenue per account, fo'sho  /s  
---
CCP and the player-base need a look in the mirror. But that time has passed and leadership at CCP and in player alliances like the status quo.  
---
Not bitter. lol.
---
This is the answer I came here for.
---
actual trash sub
---
I love the comments that are like "I tried eve but everyone there is so mean and I could never get into it11!1!!"
---
Then shut the fuck up you have no dog in this fight
---
I guess dont complain when you lose every war then. I mean you can't have it both ways.
---
Imagine thinking i'm a fucking elite tier pvper.  Holy shit.
---
i feel personally attacked and harassed, and since you've mentioned wormholers before, I feel like this is repeat stalking.
---
Enjoy your ban!
---
&gt; Time to start deleting systems and regions tbh.
---
How about about the Rogue Drones finally *do* something now that they're a faction and start evicting everyone from the drone regions? Have them start picking off ratting supers with Incursion-level warships and then ramp up into an endless tide of metal, Zerging their way through everything in all eight regions and forcing out the players who have -5 standing with them.
---
Have Sansha's Nation decide to launch full-scale invasions of their old territories in Esoteria and Paragon Soul using ships incorporating Jove technology they stole from the Prosper vault in 3-CE1R, overwhelming the alliances there with sheer numbers and overwhelming firepower.
---
Have the Triglavians start migrating from Abyssal Deadspace en masse, fleets of World Arks and capital ships erupting from conduits and moving into Detorid, where the so-called "dead storms" rage.
---
There, now everyone has a lot less territory to work with. I doubt it will ever happen because the sheer amount of salt it created would eclipse the literal mountain of the stuff they have in Germany, but it's the best I could come up with on short notice.
---
All this shows is that Snuff have some balls.
---
IP ban China
---
Sadly many of the bots just do it through Sanderling.
---
Do what league did and tie each account to their QQ account or whatever.
---
Since injectors the amount of alts would have gone up though right? Just farm Skillpoint selling alts and more rorqual alts. 
---
Injectors turned EVE into a very complex idle number simulator type of game. Create more accounts to create more accounts to create more accounts all to sell SP.
---
today i shitfit a gnosis and scanned out a huge chain, i nerly caught 2 people and nearly blew them up (one of them twice)
---
one of the guys i started talking to while he changed ships.. i was bored and moved bakc into w space (he lives in ls)
---
i talked like 1h with him while probing, running a site, starting a fight nearly killing an astero, getting blown up by a legion and podded by a gang fielding a bubble
---
i said to the guy that theres so much action here (since there was lots of warp around, and i actually hunted the astero for a short time before that) and i cant talk. and he said theres no action.
---
i told him he should have come with me. he also wanted to really test his spaceship. idk what it was, it was some super expensive 200m hull with like 300km range weapons...
---
he never used it and really wanted to test vs me
---
idk why he just does exploration and farms. yeah i lost my newly bought ship. but damn it was an action. i feel sorry for the guy. i wish everyone would throw 1/20th of his networth into content dust every other gameplay hour
---
the other guy said that my ship is bad. i said my ship is great. it has +200 bonus to get a fight compared to some lame  "you cant touch me and cant see me and i wont fight you anyways" ship...
---
fuck why did i come back... to this game.
---
btw has any small max 5 - 50 player corp a place for a content generating alpha clone? (my last move before i quit eve 2 years ago spawned a naglfar epic battle after i bashed some dudes in our static)
---
preferably wh space (c3 or lower or cX with c3 or lower static) but npc null and ls also ok
---
So you saying you cant outsmart a few ratters? What happened to your leet pvp attitude?
---
